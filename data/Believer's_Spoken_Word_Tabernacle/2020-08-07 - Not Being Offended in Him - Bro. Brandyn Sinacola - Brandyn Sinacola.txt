a pretty good turnout for a midweek service so that's pretty good god bless you for it and just pray for me um as i was walking this way i was finishing notes up and kind of fell into that channel of inspiration today and i got about half of my notes done um just felt like the lord you know just took me this until this afternoon to really feel like i hit that channel and then um you know i'm putting stuff together and then it was just kind of like i might take you a different route midway so just pray for me and bear with me here but um you want to open with me to mark chapter 4. mark chapter 4. are you happy to be in the house of the lord mark 4 and verse 13. and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parables the sower soweth the word and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterwards when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some 60-fold and some 100-fold bow our hearts together tonight lord jesus we come before you god and lord i i'm your humble servant lord i can do nothing in myself but with what you lead me to do lord father this people came tonight to hear from you lord help me god to get out of the way i ask you to take my vocal cords lord open and close my mouth father let my thoughts in your heart lord your thoughts and my heart beat in harmony now speak to your people give them what they need father in the name of the lord jesus christ said o my spirit lord jesus amen you can have your seats i hope you all are doing well it almost feels like you know we should just ask you how you're doing and have a little time of fellowship first but get right into the word is this mike a problem brother or do i need to move it or anything are we okay okay all right just want to make sure so as i was praying and i was thinking about the service this evening i had two two main points come to my heart uh that i wanted to um sorry let me just get comfortable here two main points i wanted to bring to you tonight that came to my heart the first one was just about um divine healing it just kept seeming to pulsate in my heart and in my mind i just got kept having it real strong and so we're going to try to go into that a little bit and the the second thing is is the the hindrance of of being able to believe his word or just the fact that god's word is still true today and again just not exactly sure um completely of the direction i thought well maybe that has to do with that pulsating in my heart is that you know it's is how this relates or correlates with divine healing i'm not i'm not 100 sure standing before you i can't say but we're just going to preach and trust god so if you've got a question in your heart and i'll just say it like this if you pull i'll preach and i'll do my very best to get out of the way and and you get out of the way and you just trust god amen and that's that's what i'm doing here so i just want you to keep the scripture in your minds as we minister tonight in psalms 107 verse 20 says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions now this was profound to me because it's it's we we know that over in the book of acts when peter was ministering and and it says while peter yet spake these words they received the holy ghost while while peter yet spake these words he was they received the holy ghost so it was while the word was going forth so if you'll just take what you have need of tonight and you'll you'll you'll keep that in your heart and you'll keep it in your mind brother branham would say then then just just let the word minister to you your answer can come over the pulpit it just depends maybe on your expectation or what you're here for tonight really god can exceed our expectation you might not be expecting much tonight it might be that you know oh here's the young buck preacher visiting minister pastors out of town so yeah we'll relax a little bit but god even in if if your heart is there tonight god can can override that and he can speak directly to you so it's just it's just so profound because it's just as the word goes forward and really what it is is as i was listening on the way here brother branham was explaining and he said you have something deposited in you god put that in you before the foundation of the world that was in you and when that light comes in it and it strikes across your path that that it sparks that thing that god put in you and and your faith will come forward so why is it that the that while the word is being preached is because that's encouraging your faith it's because faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word amen but if you have need of healing in your body tonight the scripture proclaims that as the word goes forth if you'll just believe you can receive your healing if you're seeking the holy ghost if you just believe you can receive the holy ghost while the word goes forward what healed them the word the word he sent and may it be again tonight like the roman centurion came to mind when i was thinking on this you know the roman centurion he came to christ and and and uh i just i just um i just want to go ahead and read it matthew 8 and verse 7. you don't got to turn there i'll read it to you and jesus said unto him i will come and heal him talking about i believe it was a son or a servant you forgive me the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it when jesus heard it he marveled this is the response of jesus christ the god fully manifested in flesh and he marveled at the man's faith and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great of faith no not in israel skip into verse 13 and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so it be done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour i want to proclaim to you tonight that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it doesn't matter what's happened in your life in your past what you're going through now it doesn't matter what will happen in your future i'm proclaiming to you tonight jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever brother branham said this but the hour has arrived the last days are here when god promised according to malachi 4 that he would raise up in the last days and would turn the hearts of the people back to the original blessings and the pentecostal faith of the fathers and you can't deny it and you can't withstand it it says in another spot i call the same thing that peter did he called repentance of that generation i call repentance to this generation repentance towards god and come back to the original truth of the word come back to the faith of our fathers come back to the holy ghost because god cannot change god cannot change it when god said these signs shall follow them that believe he has to stay with that through all of eternity it's his word a little further down but jesus said this will be the identification these signs shall not shall these signs shall excuse me not they may be they will in all generations to them that believe in my name they'll cast out devils they'll speak with other tongues speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things it won't harm them a little further down heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils as freely as you receive freely give now i want to talk to you a little bit just kind of change gears just just slightly that man has successfully removed absolutes today anything that used to be an absolute man has questioned anything that used to be an absolute man is working to change and if i if i understanding it right they throw the term around right now they call it cancel culture they're trying to cancel everything that we once knew and create something of their own imagination to fit what's right in their own eyes i i listening to ex-army ranger and he just he said he said something along these lines and i don't know if it's true i don't know where he got it from but it rang true speaking of history man has gone from from god uh sorry man has gone from god says to reason says to what is truth to you get to define what truth is so now if there are two opposing views you both get to be right this is destructive and leaves no absolute this is what this gentleman said it's destructive and it leaves no no absolute today unbelief is running rampant it's running rapid and and i and this is just i guess what's been on my heart is because unbelief is running rapid it would seemingly be that god's word doesn't stand it would seemingly be that way because because of the unbelief it says that he went into his own city and and because of their unbelief he could not perform many mighty miracles he couldn't perform the works he was doing everywhere else because of their unbelief and unbelief the atmosphere is unbelief today and because of that atmosphere it it god god gets hindered brother branham would talk about the united states and he said they just they just have the hardest time believing god's word and if that was back then what is it today it's multiplied hell hath enlarged itself and it just seems like it keeps getting bigger and bigger and greater and greater luke 16 31 says my my and this is my words though one be raised from the dead they shouldn't be persuaded if they won't hear the prophet god sent to the age and the ministers god sends them now then they won't hear see something seemingly as miraculous as someone coming back from the dead i'll give you an example saul had samuel raised from the dead and afterwards i don't see any scripture that says he repented after that he didn't repent after that so even though someone was raised up from the dead who he knew that they died and he could identify him he didn't repent and didn't do nothing for his spiritual state just bear with me as i just follow the mind of the lord here brother branham says in one spot they don't want to see it they won't listen to it jesus in his journey here on earth he said well did isaiah speak of you you got eyes and can't see in ears and can't hear now in this day i've always thought that the that you know when it when the scripture talked about crucifying christ again i thought lord i don't want to crucify you again and i always thought that that meant something along the lines of when you when you sin or or when you're when you're doing something that that you know you know is is wrong and you do it anyway and i always think you know well maybe that's crucifying christ again or or you know something along those lines but listening to indictment when brother branham's indicting this generation for crucifying christ again he tells them he says it's because it's because they deny the effects of the word they they they deny and and they they take away from the people that the the manifestation and the vindication of the word of god and they they take that from them and they say well this this can't be for this day and and this is just my my personal opinion on it now is that the reason that they would say that is because they can't make it live because they couldn't produce it and because in their minds in man's mind if i can't produce it then it can't be true and by that by their unbelief they crucify the the effects of the word on the people the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word today will be made flesh and dwell among us there will be a people on this earth who the word becomes flesh in them jesus christ will live through them again through a many-membered body so it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't listen to me i don't care what your opinion is i don't care what my opinion is if it would be contrary to the word i tell you tonight the word is true i tell you tonight that the word will live in a people regardless of what this generation says regardless of what satan tells you about yourself the word will be made manifest because something's been deposited in you you didn't put it there i didn't put it in you jesus christ put it in you before the foundation of the world so it has to be so amen regardless of the atmosphere of unbelief god's word is true now let's just let's go back to our opening scripture and i'm going to i'm going to follow the leading of the lord i might take it a little slow because i'm just trying to be sensitive of what he wants so back to this opening scriptures the word is sown in the hearts of those whose heart is likened to a road or a path the first ground that the scripture describes it's like into a road or a path and it says the enemy comes immediately following the seed hitting the path and forcefully takes it brother branham used that word he says he the enemy would come and he would forcefully take the word the amplified says he takes the message that was sown in their hearts the message that was sown in their hearts satan comes and he swiftly takes it and i got to thinking about this and i thought well why would that be why would something like that happen and and i just thought well maybe it was it was through the way they were raised maybe they were raised in a home that didn't believe in god or they had a a poor image in a daddy on this earth and your image in your daddy is the image that you'll take of your heavenly father because that's your first image of what of what god is of what authority is in your life of of of everything your parents are your everything when you're little you might not feel that way today or or uh you know teenagers probably definitely don't feel that way but you know they they are they when you were little you might not even remember it but they're your everything my little boy walks around the house and and he doesn't say too much yet so you know pray for him if you would with me but he walks around and the one word that he does say is da and he says it like that cutest thing but it's it's the image and and i and and as a father i want to make sure that i portray a good image to it i want to be sure that i i portray a good image to my daughters listen dads if you don't date your daughters i would recommend that you do that and as strange as that might sound because i i heard a brother say it like this one time you know they his little girls um he had a number of them and they they always wanted to play house and they said well you be you be the daddy and i'll be the mommy and he said i'm not a pervert you know he said i'm not gonna do that but the so i hope that didn't offend you but but you know you do it it feels funny though real quiet that's all right i'll preach anyhow because i i know it's ringing true whether you say amen or not but you know it it just it feels weird you know you're like but it's you know i'm daddy i i am your dad and you're my daughter and it's not supposed to be that way but you know you're doing innocent things you know well here let me cook for you and you do this and you know and that and and you know if you don't date him somebody else will that's my point if you don't date them somebody else will and there's many situations and and there was one that i know of and and our pastor told uh you know told a young girl he said he said listen if you don't stop down the road you're going this is going to happen in this and this and this is where you'll be well sure enough that's where she's at today and it was a it was it to me it stemmed back from a poor home life it was constant fighting between mommy and daddy listen that's your sweetheart friends that's your sweetheart you're not it's not supposed to be a war zone in your home if it's a war zone i can tell you you're off the word you're not even following the message and you need to go back and and you need to you need to pray or something pray through because that's not the way it's supposed to be amen if if you if you didn't have a good image in your home then take my word for it there's a better way than what you were raised with amen brother branham said i believe is where i got this one from is maybe satan comes right after the word is sown and gives them a word contrary to the truth they just heard and it withers away puts a question in their mind they get caught in between two opinions and it takes the word away and chokes it out the next was stony ground ones who received the word immediately with gladness the scripture says but there's there's no ground to get rooted in so after a while their zeal fizzles out as the tests and trials of life come in and listen i believe that as christians we can experience each of these seasons in our life so i can tell you're listening tently and i just ask you to let me minister to you tonight i meant to say this before and i don't say it right now as we're going into this stony ground but i just just want to give my my sympathy and my thoughts um and our let the sanchez family know that we we were praying for you we continue to pray for you um you've all been through a lot and a lot of loss and i just want to tell you that from on behalf of brother paul and the church we love you and god will give you strength god will give you strength you can you can you can see it in your eyes god will give you god bless you probably a bad spot to throw that in right there i just felt that overwhelming feeling so the next was the stony ground notice the problem now in this situation is because of what they go through their heart becomes hardened what they use to live their lives after and correct everyone else and the critical be critical of everybody else they find themselves doing it they become offended at the word which is christ would you let me switch gears here a minute the english definition of the word offended means to transgress or violate the moral or divine law to do wrong to cause difficulty discomfort or injury dislike anger vexation hurt to cause to sin or fall jesus said in matthew 18 verse 7 says woe unto the world because of offenses woe into the world because of offenses but i want you to catch something here now i want to i want to focus on the on the hard heart i want to focus on the stony ground he says whoa because the test and trials came and the scripture says they were offended they were offended because of the tests and trials and jesus said for it must needs be that offense has come but woe to the man by whom the offense cometh luke 17 says it like this verse 1 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come but woe unto him through whom they come jesus said here that you actually have a need for offenses you have a need for offenses to come in your life you have a need for tests and trials to come into your life we live in a world of human beings that are born into sinful flesh with sinful natures and we're going to have offenses come we live in bodies of flesh that that live and die they get sick they they experience financial hardships that's this life and we're in this body and tests and trials will come offenses will come the greek uses the term in this this offended says to cause a person to begin to distrust and desert one whom he ought to trust and obey one whom we ought to trust and obey jesus in in the set of scriptures there he's talking about the little ones the little children and he says there you know the disciples are in a little scuff of who's going to be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus calls over the little children and sets them in the midst of him and he says except you be as these you won't enter the kingdom of god and our pastor was bringing out he said you know a child they just they just trust and obey like we said your your children's everything they just they have such an innocence about them they haven't had the testing trials that they just if you say red is blue they're going to believe you if you say white is black they believe you because because you're either everything they just you're they're absolute when they're young and notice the scripture the the the word jesus says you will be offended you will have offenses come that's a promise to you but its offense is is to begin to distrust and desert one whom you trust and obey jesus is saying these trust and obey me these little ones just believe i'm god they believe if i if the words that i tell them i can i can be free in the midst of these children because they just believe and that's the way we're supposed to be we're supposed to be as children we're supposed to believe god we're supposed to trust and obey we're supposed to believe his word when we hear it we're supposed to believe his word when we read it you're supposed to trust and obey god but these offenses come and the in the the danger is that they would make you distrust who you ought to trust and obey it's amazing to me that the ground is is hard and it's stony and the word of god couldn't take root but when bitterness comes when they become offended bitterness can take root so think about that a moment the ground was not was not ripe or or fixed as that it could receive the word it could receive the word when it sprouted when it was trying to take root in the life but the root of bitterness must have some strength to it to be able to penetrate the stoning ground you know some plants can you can throw them i i work for a landscape company and i forget what kind it was maybe a hosta or something like that and they they said yeah you could throw that on the asphalt or on the on the concrete sidewalk and they said it would grow it's just some plants are hardy like that take another one and you take it out of that soil that it's drawing its moisture and its nutrients from and you throw it on the on the concrete next to the hosta and it'll shrivel up and die it's just some something about that is is i don't even want to call it hearty maybe harsh is the right word because bitterness is so harsh in our lives bitterness will rob your joy bitterness will steal your happiness bitterness will bind you when you ought to be free but the but the the the difficult part about what jesus is saying and and what this what jesus is saying in our parable is it's the word that was being sown the seed is the word the word was sown and and it's not that they're just becoming offended at life and and they're going to go on with god they become offended at the word and that's and it's a detriment it's a terrible place to be i've been there maybe i've said these things here and so you forgive me if i repeat myself i've been there before i've been years ago i've had a bitter heart i had a hard heart i had it where i was coming into church performing my duty of being there going out to the car and just hoping nobody came and talked to me just just didn't want to talk to nobody became bitter at the man of god that was preaching offended by him offended by the ones who could help me the most who who would bring me closer to the word i became offended at them i took issue with them i became hard towards them i didn't want anything to do with them they walk in and you want to go the other way there's something wrong in your heart and i and i and i tell you that that maybe you could draw something from my life and and maybe see a reflection of yourself if you're there today god never promised us a flowery bed of ease god actually promised that this life would be full of tests and trials god promised god promised that you would experience sorrow god promised that you would experience life and you'd experience death god promised that offenses would come the the the thing about a a stoney heart or or offended heart and you you forgive me i just feel overwhelming feeling just now our pastor was was talking about this along these along this line too and he said you know it's it's so difficult because something inside can give up something inside of you can actually give up and you become offended you be you become hurt the tests and trials of this life are seemingly too heavy have i preached this before here is this okay okay all right thank you something in your heart gives up though nobody in here would know it you could be sitting here tonight you could even you could even take and and you know i just well i won't use that example but you can you can almost try to put on that smile and it takes all your effort but there it is there it is and here you are and you know everyone's gonna think you're okay and you don't really want them to ask you how you're doing and if they do you're going to just tell a little white lie and say i'm good i'm good fine oh everything's great because you've been around a little bit and you know the lingo you know the lingo and so you're you're expressing it here and i believe in positive confession i do believe in that don't get me wrong i don't want you you know if you're if somebody if every time someone asks you how you're doing and then they got to sit down and and wait an hour while you tell them all life's troubles you're not going to have to eventually they're going to stop asking you how you're doing but i'm just saying there is a sense of honesty that's okay to be honest about it's it's okay to say you know what i i'm i'm hurting right now it's okay to say and and i and i i don't remember the service but i i you know brother paul talks about the title of the service a lot brother barry when your retreat took a sermon and it was simply tile titled i'm struggling i'm struggling brother burley sorry i'm struggling it's okay to say you know i'm struggling right now and if you don't want to go into detail then just say just pray for me pray for me i'm struggling listen you're a part of a body here there shouldn't be any any looking down on somebody for being honest if that's where they're at that should be the time that you come together and you know sometimes they may not even watch you you should offer to pray for them right then but sometimes they may not want that and that's okay if you can't pray for them right then then take it take it in prayer later come come beside them in spirit come beside them and stand beside them hold them up lift them up they lifted the arms of moses and then the battle went on and they won the battle but sometimes you just have to say i'm struggling pray for me and lift your brother and sister up hold their arms up in prayer encourage them give them strength you'll you never know there there's battles daniel prayed for for you forgive me it's my my mind's going here and it's slipping my mind however many days he prayed and and and finally the angel came to him and what did the angel tell him said daniel i heard your cry the first time the first time you started praying i heard your cry the first time you uttered the words and you and you closed your prayer in the name of jesus christ he hears it but what was the delay in your answer what was the struggle with something in the spirit realm discouragement i believe is is probably one of the greatest tools of the enemy because if he can get you discouraged and distraught it's it's it's almost like you just lose faith and that's not to say that you're an unbeliever that's not just to put you down in any way but it's to say that you your faith just takes a hit you you you you just i don't know the words are just not coming but if you've been there you know what i'm talking about you just and part of you doesn't want to believe is that okay my help me lord it's just uh it's just discouraging and and discouragement can can can become offensive sometimes sometimes it's a hypocritical life that's been lived before you and and that's the image that you've seen and then you lose trust you lose trust in the ones that you should be able to trust you you why would you want to live that way when you have the hypocrite in front of you living like that and you you start i guess what's been burning on my heart is is to to have the realities of god to have the realities listen the reality of god is that if you're living a way that you shouldn't be the reality of god is to come in and change your life and if and if you've had a hypocrite image if you lived a hypocrite life god can change that god can come on the scene and he can quicken that seed that's in you and and clean up your life and you know sometimes sometimes we can become offended because we find ourselves living that way and we despise you despise the way you despise the way somebody is or something about them you maybe this is the example that comes came to mind was you grew up in a drunkard's home and you despised that thing you said i'll never drink like that i'll never do that and then maybe down the road in life maybe you find yourself doing that maybe you find yourself drinking or drinking a drunkard is an addiction maybe you find yourself addicted to something else maybe it's an addiction to pornography an addiction to to movies something that your flesh is is lusting after listen a lot of people blame god for things that's not god's fault are you with me is this too hard tonight you you james said god has not tempted any man but man is drawn away by their own lust and when lust conceives it bears sin and after sin follows death spiritual death but they become offended and they point that offense at god god why'd you make me this way remember the scripture says that the clay can't turn to the potter and say why have you made me thus sometimes friends it's your own lust that's that's that you're that's producing what's in your life and i and i say that not to beat you down i say that to tell you there's a better way and i say that to turn your offense off of god and turn it on to jesus not not not your offense uh and to take it off of god put your offense on the devil who's making you live that way but turn to jesus christ turn turn to god the very thing that you need and that you should be running to we we we all do it we run away from it but that's the very source of life that you need to go to yet somehow we find ourselves there too or will take the extreme opposite and and maybe you come from a legalistic background and it was real strong and hard and so bless god you're going to do everything not to be that way so instead you go and you're this way which is just as bad as legalism you're going to give yourself liberty because i never had these liberties but you what you need to do is instead of swinging way over here you need to come over here and find a balance a balanced life is is the best one you can live and if you don't know what that balance is ask god pray and ask ask father about it ask ask god to show you listen one of one of the things that's been striking my heart is if it's in here and god said live this way or i'd like you to i this is my word this is what pleases me and you don't understand it go ask the author about it go ask the one who wrote it if if if i authored a book and i gave it to you to read and you came back and you read it and you said i don't understand the point of this book you you have two options you can throw it in the trash and if i wrote a book you probably would want to do that or you could come talk to me and you could say hey and and in chapter 4 i didn't understand what you meant can you explain that to me and i could explain my thoughts behind it and then oh okay now i can now i can see what you're trying to say oh okay if i wrote you a check and you took it to the bank and it bounced or they wouldn't cash it what if it was five thousand dollars i would like five thousand dollars you would like five thousand dollars i'm sure but if you took it and it wouldn't cash would you would you throw it in the garbage i would expect that my phone would ring and you'd say hey brandon i tried to cast that check and it didn't go through what's going on and i and i would i would look into it i i could explain it to you i could maybe see things that you couldn't see the bank account where you're trying to withdraw the money from and i could say oh that's simple this was the issue go back and try it again it'll go through this is what you got to do let me see the check what bank did you try to deposit it at what did you try to apply your faith to what was the motive and objective behind what you were asking when you asked god to cash the check for you father you said through a prophet that i could cash this thing but it didn't work what happened and then what if he said what if he said that to you what if he said well what was in your heart when you asked it what was on your mind when you when what was what was your motivation what was your drive for wanting that thing why didn't you get that job that you wanted what was the reason that you wanted that job or maybe father i didn't get the job that i wanted what i i don't understand and then you find out that it would have kept you away from home and and some of our jobs do that they require us to travel and things but i'll tell you brother if your job requires you to travel and be away from home a lot let me tell you from experience you better you better make good when you're home you better be plugged in when you're home because because i'll tell you i've watched it i i've and i wouldn't want him to feel bad if he ever if he ever heard this but i watched it in my my own dad i told you before my parents are divorced i watched it traveling a lot and and let me tell you brother do we have any travelers here am i speaking to miss don't you don't got to raise your hand that's okay maybe they're not here tonight because they're traveling they'll listen later but i'm just telling you that that if you don't make good when you're home and you don't plug in when you're home when you're gone or maybe you're not traveling maybe you're just out doing other things because uh i don't mean to pick on the young married couple but you know you you want me time and so you're gonna go and you're gonna do these things because this is what you used to do well uh again i don't mean this disrespectful news flash two become one you're one now you're married you don't you don't go somewhere without your significant other not all the time sometimes and sometimes it's okay we'll balance that out sometimes it's okay now she says no you ain't going nowhere without her your sweethearts it's okay you don't want to go nowhere without each other and let me tell you something i had people tell me in the church that that'll end someday it doesn't have to end right it doesn't have to end i don't care how old you are it doesn't have to end listen the message came and in this message with all of its great mysteries it said she's your sweetheart he's your sweetheart you ought to enjoy being around each other but that's let me get to my point as you as you start going and it gets let me let me say it this way it gets easier to go it gets easier to be away it gets easier to the point to where you don't you don't want to come home because you've gotten so used to this lifestyle boy am i stepping on your toes tonight it becomes easy to do that it becomes easy to go it becomes more difficult to come home i i don't mean to tell what i pray is his testimony someday but he my dad would come home and he would he would sit in the parking lot at the airport and cry because he didn't want to come home and there was other things listen there was there was there was things on both sides there was things on both sides there was just there was a decision made that was the final decision kind of tipped it over the edge but but there's things on both sides that that would that would sister you ought to make it a home that he wants to come home to i don't i don't i don't i don't kind of chuckle i just it's because i just imagine in being in your shoes and hearing the minister say these things and i hope it's not too hard i'm not going to apologize one of the things that that i i saw in the scripture was jesus didn't appo the disciples came to him and they said you know jesus you were pretty harsh on the pharisees just now calling them vipers and and you're of your father the devil you i we think you offended them i didn't find where jesus went back to the pharisees and said hey i'm sorry one of the things that i found is is you can't apologize if the word offends now to balance that out brother branham would say he'd say i'm sorry if that offended you but i got to tell you the truth forgive me if i offend you but i've got to tell you the truth forgive me forgive your pastor when he's when he's blasting the word over the pulpit and and it's and it's getting down at a practical level because he because god knows what you need he can't apologize for that and he shouldn't apologize for it and you shouldn't want him to apologize for it there's something in in our hearts that says amen brother sam keep preaching keep preaching it no matter how hard it is it's not listen it's not it's it's not fun for a man of god to say these hard things because you love you love the people in your hearts for them but yet there's something in you and you just say if it helps them then i want to say it if it helps them then i want to minister to them but sis make make it a home that your husband wants to come home listen i i i set it up a couple wednesdays ago to a little church and i said i said listen sis flirt with him flirt with him he wants to be flirted with it's a need and a man that he needs to be flirted with and now i don't know i'm not older maybe that does fizzle out at some point but i wouldn't think that it would i would think that you you like to be sweethearts you know i i just i just can't imagine getting down the road and and not feeling like i'm on my honeymoon anymore is that is it is it a flowery bed of ease absolutely not you're gonna you're gonna have arguments you're gonna have disagreements you're you're gonna you're gonna have times when you don't maybe like that person very much you're gonna have times when when you offend them and they offend you i'm trying to remember our first argument i think i remember what it was and i would be telling them myself so we're just going to skip that i just let go say sweet things to her brother say say sweet sweet things to him sis he needs to know that you admire him and that and that he's your hero it might sound stupid and it probably is but that man needs to know that that he's he's your provider he needs to know that that he needs to know again it sounds odd but he needs to know that you find him attractive brother you better tell her she's pretty and eventually even if you don't you know sometimes see it eventually you'll see when when the the house is a mess and and she's had a stressful day in the in the in the kids are are going crazy and her and her hair isn't done or or she didn't she didn't get any time for herself no insist should be in your heart but know that that's it was her heart to do that but it just didn't work out that way but you should see the beauty in that you should you should listen one of the greatest things i think i've ever heard i believe it was brother tim dodd at a men's meeting and he said he brother branham come in to the home and and things were going just crazy and and it was all the house was a mess and the kids were crying the wife was crying there was people outside lined up everywhere and he said it was just chaos for the wife and she was i think she might have been over there trying to do the dishes and she's she's crying and she's had a hard day and kids are crying and the toys are everywhere and and brother tim said and brother branham did the most spiritual thing that could ever be done and he put one foot in the living room and one foot in the kitchen and he raised his hand like the angel in revelations 10 and then he grabbed an apron and he put it on he didn't say peace everybody be still daddy's home sis brother branham said put a bow in your hair when i get home he didn't say that what did he do he went over and he got the kids settled down he he got to play on blocks with them helping them build blocks and put it put it together got them settled and then he walked over to his wife and he just stroked her back a little bit and he said it and and probably i can't remember the quote fully but maybe he said it's okay honey i know it's hard it's been a hard day but he said the whole time he's praying in his heart saying father let my peace let my peace pass to her let her feel peace and then what did he do the most manly thing a man could do and he stuck his hands in the water and started washing dishes listen you might think it sounds weird but i think your wife is going to be attracted to that and then he started just talking and he said honey maybe we'll go down and we'll check out that dress you've been wanting to buy one of man's things that he hates the most is to go shopping but let me tell you brother sometimes she just wants you to go with her and i read this book um oh my goodness um i read this book one time and uh he's describing the differences in men and women and he says you know you know when a guy i'm trying to think like a guy has a hunting story or he goes fishing and and you know he wants to tell his wife about it and honey i caught a fish and oh i tell you it was real big she could care less about that well brother when when your sister's telling you about her shopping experience and and and my wife wanted the the link so i'm going to have a lot to live up to tonight because she wanted to stream and i'm not the greatest at this but i'll tell you what i'll tell you what i'm guilty of and brothers don't do this is is i'll have my phone out and she's talking and she's telling me about her shopping experience and i'm and i'm listening but i'm not completely listening and i'm just trying to you know i that sounds terrible i don't mean it to be that way but really what it's doing is you're trying to fulfill your duty and listen to her but listen she's wanting to tell the fish story she's wanting to tell you i got you know i look at the deals i got and you're thinking and you're you're spending money still so is it really a deal but she's telling you the sales and she's telling you what what interests her and and if if and this author was saying if you watch two women when they're talking about their stories and oh you know it's it's the tone of voice they're getting into it with them and you know oh and and i and i didn't get that sale oh you didn't get that sale oh that's terrible and that's how sisters talk so brothers let you know when your wife is talking to another sister kind of tune in and see what's that sister's response and how she's doing because that's really what your response needs to be you know you you take interest in in the in the things with one another and and we're just way off of everything that i had is is this okay amen but i'll tell you and and brothers she she needs a man who can lead in family altar if you don't do devotions young un unmarried if you ain't married yet get this established now consider this your your training ground for for for what marriage will be like later do your devotions get down and read your bible and pray make it a daily thing you might not be able to do that every day when you're married you husbands you you older ones you might not be able to do it and i don't mean this as a joke but you know you older ones you might you might fall asleep while you're doing it but you should you should still do it you get in trouble after that but but you should you should still do it you should still make that a part of your home especially you you younger brothers with young families make that a part of your home you might not get it every day but i'll i'll tell you this there's times that i've noticed when i don't pray with my kids before they go to bed they wake up with a bad dream but there's for whatever reason maybe it's because we're the priests of our homes but if if i pray for him and last night's an example and and listen sis you have just as much authority to pray for your children as your husband does i'm just i'm just i'm trying to help you out but i'm i'm just saying this because like last night my little boy woke up at uh 3 30 and my wife went up and got him and he was standing with his blanket and his teddy and he just seemed scared and i remember her bringing him down changing his diaper you know taking him back up and she told me today she said i laid him down and i prayed with him well he woke up an hour later and and he did the same thing he was he was crying real hard like something scared him so i went this time brothers you should do that give your wife a break i went up and i did that and and uh you know he was standing there and i thought and you know kind of the less compassionate side of the two i'm thinking i can get him out of that crib so i laid him down i i covered him back up i prayed with him and uh and before i left he he you know he settled down and he just kind of kind of like a piece came over him you know so brother she you pray with your kids pray with your kids i see these little faces you know listening intently on that they they want you to pray daddy they they want to hear from you sometimes um i gotta i gotta let you stand and bring it to a close you can stand to your feet sometimes you know daddy can't be around sometimes cis you know it's it's it's a bad situation life didn't go the way that you thought it should and daddy's not there i i you have just as much authority brother branham called you what was it the the the fifth gospel the fifth gospel you're ministering to those kids sis your your daddy's not home during the day who has them you do and you're ministering to them you're you're the image of christ in their life so we started talking about offenses and we ended up here but i i just i pray something spoke to you tonight i pray i i say that because it's all of those situations when life doesn't go the way that you thought it should you become offended you you you cis when he doesn't do those things you can become offended brother when she doesn't do those things you can become offended that's how we got there is your hearts can start growing apart and and and it's just the same with with your relationship with christ you don't you don't listen god answers every prayer god answers every prayer the disciples said father teach us how to pray and what was jesus response thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven so we don't understand everything we don't understand why life goes a certain way we don't understand why god didn't answer the way that we wanted him to and if you're not careful you can become offended by that but just know father has a greater picture than mine he's looking at it different than you can see he's he's looking at a big picture does that minister to you do you understand i encourage you don't become offended trust daddy trust daddy trust the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he'll direct your path you don't know what way to go you don't know what the next step is for your life ask daddy about it ask ask god listen he didn't only write this book it said your life was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world your life might not necessarily be in here completely but he also authored your life he's the author and the finisher of the faith go ask daddy about it one more testimony before i let you go going through what i did with my family um i i had a hard time with the word daddy because that was what was always that was the term that was always used with daddy daddy daddy loves you daddy does steady that we've we've got a a decent relationship now it's where the lord's restoring but i became that word that word was offensive to me and even when my [Music] sorry even when my kids would come and it's an awful place to be when your kids come to call you daddy and because they use that word it steps on your pain and so you close off to it you don't you don't really want to to go there because something happened in your life but one thing that that god told me was that i have a heavenly father and it says the spirit in us cries abba father which is daddy daddy and when i saw that i thought there is a real image of daddy that word isn't a bad thing there there is a there is a daddy there is an image of a daddy there's images in this church of real daddies there's images in this church of a real husband there's images in this church of a real mom and a wife there's images in this church of a teenager that's living in laodicea there's images in this church of someone who's who's single and holding to christ and loves the lord with all of their heart there's images god has placed in the body so if if you draw a fence from one of those images let god show you the real image that he's put before you is that okay amen let's bow our hearts lord jesus we come before you god and just fill in a real sweet spirit lord i i uh i got to about the spot that i thought you wanted me to turn and you turned it in a different direction than i even thought and sometimes lord it can feel like just rambling lord but i pray that with every word that was spoken lord that you would let it strike good ground father the one we didn't get to was good ground lord let let the hearts be tender to your word let let every word fall where it may maybe they don't need it for right now but maybe they'll need it in a couple days or a couple couple weeks maybe in a couple years lord though they'll remember something that was spoken tonight god i father you know my heart lord is to never say something that a pastor would have to get up and correct i ask you lord that that the shepherd over this flock would find everything in order i pray that the the people lord would would find application to the word for their life and lord i just asked you i asked them lord by show of hands nobody else looking that if they've become offended if something in their heart has given up because of the tests and trials of this life if there's things they don't understand desires godly desires that you've put in their heart but have yet to be manifested and and it hurts them then i just ask them to lift their hand to the lord to be real honest with you and lord i pray you'd minister to them god i pray they would have been ministered tonight but i pray you know the need behind that hand lord you know the hurt and the pain that's in the life you know the offense that's that started to take root lord god come into the garden and pull out the weeds of bitterness take out the malice and the in the envy and the strife the jealousies take it all out lord take the lust of the flesh and the pride of life root out the roots of bitterness lord get all of the root we pray till the soil father and let the nutrients be in it god that would cause the word to grow lord i i love you and i and i love your people and and i wouldn't say nothing lord to hurt him i pray it was a help i pray it wasn't just rambling i pray it wasn't just somebody standing up here talking to him for an hour but i pray that you would just let it lord it's in your hands now let it not return void amen let there be fruit come from the service give it to you in jesus name amen god bless you turn it over to the song leader if you need prayer we'd be happy to pray with you and i really do i i i felt
