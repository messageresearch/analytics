the satchel we - the winds of fate you can fly in a higher place do not struggle it's by great set your wings to the winds of faith let's all stand oh what's your need what's your crime i watch your mountain that's much too high speak the Word of God and by and by it will move or you will fly Oh set your wings [Music] do not struggle you spy [Applause] set your to the James of faith or just satchel through the winds of faith you can't fly in a high do not struggle boy it's fine [Applause] [Music] Joleen the wind Sophie what inspired words you know you think of the the eagle itself how brother Brad would tell us that story where he was up there in the mountains praying and how that that little chipmunk and that eagle had come down and landed in that little chipmunk begin to chatter chatter chatter at the eagle whether bam got to looking at it and the inspiration just struck him because everything that that little chipmunk was saying was things that really it didn't matter the chipmunk didn't hold any mystery for that Eagles life and finally you know brother bran just you know he gives the illustrations and dramatizing it as though that that little chipmunk was just speaking everything that was contrary to the authority that laid in that eagle these are miracles has passed and all those things are behind but there was an authority that lay within that eagle and just all he had to do was spread his wings and a little thrust and there was a current that could lift him I believe there's there's it is it is absolutely a lesson in a direction for our lives there's a lot of chatter that we can hear there's a lot of chatter that's going on we look in Psalms 27 the Bible as it speaks and brother bran would take that for the background to the rapture you know when you ever heard of a story and you hear a story sometimes it makes it different it has such a meaning when you see the background of those characters and of that story were surrounded the enemies all around us but like David said one thing will I seek after and that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever so the enemy swore and that he would get me but he says he stumbled yay he stumbled and fell amen whereas our confidence that it's in the Lord and you know what God has let us know in this hour what the real revelation breaks forth on our life is to let you and I know who we are the authority that's given to us as sons and daughters of God let me just say it like this as as the ministering of the word will come just in in and simplicity here tonight we have authority within our life to rise above and to lay everything else aside amen you believe that we have that authority listen when the word of God is coming forth the Word of God is here it sits the person of Jesus Christ to anoint our eyes and our hearts and what the word is speaking just obey a man you find liberty is within the Word of God amen can you say Amen tonight amen what at what authority is in the Word of God and in as children of God as believing sons and daughters of God we've got a lot to be thankful for we've got a lot to pray for but we've got also a lot to be thankful for and everything that God permits to come our way it is the making of a testimony every tests in every trial it's the making of a testimony in our life amen so we just we so appreciate the Lord for that good to have brother nd you're with us and whether the panel good to have each and every one of the rest of you and just so thankful to have brother Burley here tonight they take time out to to come by and be with us and we just we want to hear from the Lord amen that's who we're that's who we're interested in hearing from him and to know that God will take that vessel take the gift that God will step down inside that gift and speak to our hearts what we have need of and I believe that with all my heart that God knows our needs and he knows just exactly how to minister to our hearts so we'll just receive that tonight Lord just pass by my way tonight Lord take the men of God let him be so surrendered to you and in our hearts Lord I want to be so surrendered to you you know to get so wrapped up under the anointing of the word to wear that we are speaking exactly what the word is speaking amen you may have mountains in your life but remember it says say unto this mountain don't doubt in your heart and it shall be removed amen so we just we love the Lord tonight so thankful to be in his prayer and we just want to turn our attention to the word of the Lord you pull on the gift of God tonight I know that you're not that's not strange to you but pull on the gift of God tonight because God knows what we have need of tonight amen there might have been something you've had a question on your heart for years but to God he knows exactly he's the answer and he knows exactly how to answer that question amen so let's just let's turn our attention to the word of the Lord how many of you just ready said Lord passed by my way Lord I've come here tonight not to be a spectator I've come here to not to receive from God a man I want to receive from the Lord tonight amen I'm crying [Music] AVO oh say oh won't you hear my heart Oh Oh Wow Oh [Music] Oh [Music] oh my let it be a prayer Oh cried you said your say Oh My Jesus Oh say hallelujah oh won't you hear Oh Lord passed by my way to that Lord I need another church law [Music] Wow not your personal Oh My Jesus La Paz amen it's brother burly would make his way forward a cry you said [Music] say all make it personal tonight oh my say I say go whoa [Music] [Music] hallelujah can we go to the Lord in prayer good gracious Heavenly Father mr. song says do not pass the spine sometimes well God we can sit into a service and it seems like others could be being blessed and we're just sitting there the day we cry no hard lot don't pass me by I have needs too and all God I just believe that your hitch night and you can supply every one of our needs because you always hear the cry of your children as I was just making lord if you go into a hospital when there is a nursery is it well a bunch of babies crying while they're crying you can't tell if it's a black baby if it's a white baby if it's a Chinese baby if it's a Mexican baby you can't tell the difference it's all cried and I believe that we're here tonight God you can hear the cry of different individuals when we're all crying off for you you can discern each one of us to know which is crying so father we come in tonight hungry in our hearts and we're thankful for your grace and mercy and we just actually pray that you to speak to the hearts of your people tonight reacts in the name of Jesus Christ as we could meet everything and not hands and the church says Amen god bless you making musicians god bless you today to submit up this way I said it but reading I believe it's probably eight years ago I was longing it actually but we here by God's grace a man it's good to see brother end it god bless you brother while you have to be in the house of the Lord tonight man god bless you but saving for allowing us to be here and we'll just like just get on into the word you don't wanna preach to your young people praise the Lord I just it's been lately you know just been I guess I get stuck in a gear or sometimes and just like to share things Whittle but you know when the gospel go forth this for all of us a man and what I would like to minister on tonight it actually could go either way I had something else I was gonna minister as I walked out and then I began to think about a little thought so I'm just gonna want to go at this thought in my heart tonight if you will I like to invite you to turn to Matthew chapter 6 but I heard you talking about the Eagles that's some of my favorite service sermons to you know eagle they live quite some time someone can live up to 86 92 years old they say but one reason why they say the eagle clear so long it's because you don't use his strength to fly you know ego just go like this a couple of times and that's it because what happened to waiting catches him what makes him live long he'd know how to yield to the wind he don't flap a lot so he just spread his wings yield to the wind and let the wind carry him hey man so he don't wear out too much you know sometimes we wear out because we flapping flapping and flapping flapping flapping what we need to do is year to the holy spirit and let God carry us can we say praise the Lord and I'm so thankful for them amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 6 I want to go to verse 24 he says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the you cannot serve God and Mammon just read that scripture again no man can serve two masters well hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon I also had to go to Luke chapter 14 week fourteen and I like to go to verse 25 Luke 1425 listen there wasn't a great multitude with him and he turned and said it to them if any man come to me hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple I would like to hopefully we won't hold too long I would like to speak a simple little thought tonight no man can serve two masters Jesus made that very plain he said no man can serve two masters well you either will hate the one and love the others those are pretty plain words don't need no interpretation that means exactly what it says and I really loved that scripture because it makes them very plain you know in this time that we're living in a lot of things are happening a lot of things are taking place but I don't dwell on the negatives I do well over the positive because when you talk about everything that is going wrong so much you're actually giving the devil praise when we should be giving God praise praise the Lord you know we we we just want to just I'm gonna go to numbers Exodus 21 in a moment but I want to just kind of deal with these scriptures for a moment and I want to read something cuz I'm getting ready to do something that's quite simple but Brenham says in the message faith come not hearing he said just lift the meeting down here where I had 2000 after noon about a week before then and as many as 30,000 at that time he said I just don't sound the trumpet about it I want I want it to sound it up there so where it goes up there the Lord said we see it you know and so forth he's about that's it friends he's a God set some in the church to dramatize I was thinking about this one better Sam he was talking about but a brand of gated drama about the little children said he'd come in my mind he said God said Psalm in the church to dramatize Psalm to preach a fiery service others to pray for the sick but all these gifted brothers they're in the church for one purpose that's to unite the kingdom of God here on earth the Brotherhood see we understand there's different types of ministries and he said some dramatize some preachers pray for the sick and you know I've got different types of gifts and I'm the one did it I respect every gift of God make no difference who the Vesely as long as the gifts from God we think for forward wicked glean from it and I like to read it under Co he says he in Christ as the mystery of God revealed why do you hunger Church why do you thirst that it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you but you let so many things get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you know that your husband you let your children you let the cares of this world you let some pastor you let somebody else getting it out of you when you know that down in your heart you're thirsty hungry it's God trying to reveal it to you the revelation the last day is here now I want you to notice in this quote he said when he began to talk about you let so many things get it out of you he begins to say wife husband children pastor even the cares of this world that goes right back to the scripture that I read well we read in the Book of Luke 14 if any man comes to me hate not father mother wife children brethren sisters yay in his own life so we look at in Luke 14 when it talks about you now we understand I'm pretty sure we are mature enough to realize when he said hey father mother brothers and sisters that don't mean to hate that we think hey man not that you mad at him you want to do something to him that's not what he's saying what he's simply talking about you can't put them things before me give me say praise the Lord now then brother branham is talking here about how you're thirsting but you let things you let things like shoot the children wife take these things from you so now when you look in the Book of Luke I believe because what Jesus is speaking in the Book of Luke he's speaking of family relations that can actually be a hindrance in your life and I find a lot of time in Christianity that's what no hindered a lot of people is family they don't want to let go being the influence the family influence them in the wrong directions I find that happened to a lot of people and I kind of want to just maybe talk about those things because you know family relationships and people in the family sometimes can be trapped in your life where you can't move on and you have to be able to discern them can we say praise the Lord so no man can serve two masters I believe we all have to come to a time to even get started we have to be like Ruth the prophet of God said what help Ruth to even start on her journey she had made a clear-cut decision and every one of us have to have the clear-cut decision I'm gonna serve God regardless of what comes or what goes I'm gonna serve God amen when you get that clear-cut decision you have temptations and trials come down through the journey but your decision is clear and you're not gonna let nothing stop them you know even Abraham we understand that when God told Abraham it's missing the same thing you got to leave your house family amen he's talking about family again so it can tell you it can see that it can be hinder it sometimes with family trying to serve the Lord if we're not careful but you know one thing I liked about Abraham we understand how the prophet of God taught us Abraham did not do everything exactly what God told him to do he told him the one thing he did do he left his country but you ever noticed in a story of Abraham when he had his father with him he had his nephew with him god never said why did you do that why did you bring him with you and God never said today for him do you know why the main thing Abraham did he started walking he left his country and he started walking so by him just walking God knew would have to be dealt with later on so Abraham done the right thing indeed we understand the story how God virtually got rid of daddy got really nice you but Abraham did the right thing he started walking that's what I try to encourage people whatever you do it's a statement that I use at my church I actually I can't remember the second who posted I think Paul I posted it he said if you smoke and go to church if you drink and go to church if you listening to where the music go to church if you're cursing going to church if you drink an alcohol go to church because what the devil do when people got those problems in life they say there's no need for me to go to church so ain't going to go to church until I can stop doing it if you can stop doing it you don't need God so if you go to church and bring the problem in the church you into a place where you can be helped can we say praise the Lord so honey current people keep pressing on keep pressing on and that's where Abraham did and we watch Abraham life little by little God was changing things and i'ma tell you one thing I love about it you know when God had to separate a lot from Abraham because strife begin to come between them but that separation when it took place I like how the scripture says it it said when life had gold did God speak to Abraham but do you notice in the scripture the one that caused the strife and so forth got out of Abraham life the when God got Abraham what he wanted him he sent him to go get back to rescue it so that's like God deal with us you know I encourage young people you know you saw maybe in public school and you got jobs and stuff but I encourage you Wilfred I don't think God want us to be Hermits and state to ourself and not do nothing but I encouraged and wherever you doing wherever you're going if you into a place where you can't keep the right atmosphere just leave I tell my son the same thing he like to play basketball all over the streets as a son that's fine but when you can't control that atmosphere get out of it can we say praise the Lord so sometimes you know you have to be careful with your hanging around and what you do if you're not strong enough in your spiritual walk there's certain things you can't go in certain places you can't go because it's going to be a hindrance to you can we say praise the Lord but I do believe as we go in Christ I can go anywhere I want to go because kicked nobody influenced me can we say praise the Lord I come to a place in my life I can't no can't nobody influenced me in the wrong way I don't permit that because I know who I am can we say praise the Lord so I do not encourage too young people you find your strength in the Lord and you know what you can take and you know what you can't take a man let God elevate you let God help you grow he'll help you I promise you Danny Amen man it's already eight o'clock brother praise the Lord you know since I've been passionate I got a little long-winded you know my you know how your family they don't know how to correct you like your own family now we brother you all y'all ministers you know how it is your wife catch every mistake you say and then you know how it is oh maybe I have to be honest with you when my wife say Amen that really excites me huh cuz you know this is good this is good it encourages me I mean I love amens and so far but with my wife just saying I said that's alright because I know I'm better enjoy that cuz soon as I say something wrong she's gonna remind me sometimes you preaching it and I'm like something wrong and need I said I said look she you know I play at all of them that's early edition yeah when I get it right she I appreciate that I really do I'm trying to relax some spirit I was uh you know I was looking at some stuff on the internet or people I wanted to know why people leave the message I'm interested why did you leave so I could learn from that that's what I do and I was my wife said what are you doing I said I'm just looking at some things here I just want to know what people leave a domestic what you doing there I said I'm a pastor and I want to know because when I learned things from why other people do things then I can see somebody else go in that same direction I can pick it up because I'm learning him I said you don't need to be caught up in that stuff I said I'm not caught up in it she's a bird I wanna tell you something if you get caught up in there that stuff something you know right now I'm not gonna follow you she said you leave this message I will not follow you she said I will move back home to my ot and I'm gone and I said god bless you sister that's right she said she said I don't know what's wrong with all the other sisters when they hugged the lead and they follow him she's I'm not one of them Bernie that tells me she has a revelation she's not following me she's following Christ can we say man you know brothers and sisters I can't explain everything I don't think none of us can but I'm here to tell you it's what I could explain the cloud or I can't explain it sons wonders and miracles it's not why I'm in the message it's the word you can show me false about brother better in life and there might even be right but it ain't gonna change my opinion about it it ain't gonna change my opinion about the message cuz some things we just don't understand can we say praise the Lord so I be honest with you it's only three types of groups in the message there's a group in the message that make brother Brandon more than what he was there was a group that take away from what he was but there's a bride know exactly what he was and and what I find the ones that make him more than what he was that's where your deity doctrines come from the one that takes away from what he was those are the one that capitalized on his mistakes but the bride says Elijah a man of like precious passions so you have to be a balance can we say praise the Lord but it is the word what caught me it is the word that's keeping me how many you believe we tie truth well Ruth type us because a bride is not a type you're the original so Ruth types you we don't type her let me make sure I make sure that right but you know but think about it when you read the story about Ruth when you go over there and you're going I think as Ruth chapter 4 when you're going and see Ruth talking to Boaz you middle boy I said who are that my daughter she said I'm Ruth right and didn't voice revealed to her the mystery of redemption what he's going to do is that right but if you notice when Ruth left bow ass she went back to Naomi and then they all he said who are that my daughter Ruth did not identify her name is Ruth cuz now she been revelaed something been revealed to her so she just said she just told what the man had done she wouldn't worry about her identity she was not identifying what boy and some promise he's gonna tell her can we say man so I say Who I thought my daughter my response is I can only tell you what the message what Christ has done for me that's all I can tell you you can't take away my testimony this message changed my life [Music] it brought me from the streets brought me from being a thug brought me from being a liar it changed me so all I can do is testify what the message done for me sometimes I see sons gonna go out there gonna defend the message it saddens me when I see people try to defend brother Brennan you can't defend the Prophet God does there remember the Hat brother branham it on the stage but I barely said I'm not a healer he said but if the gift is in question God will answer for them see I don't have to go around trying to prove that brother Branham was a prophet God vindicated him if you want to prove the message live it he'll mean it yet we've been in the grocery store walking around in the grocery store and I apples they say an apple and an apple say hello you I'm an apple did bananas say hey I'm a banana carrots say hey you're my carrot anybody ever been in the grocery store and that happened to you know do you know I you look at the fruit and you know exactly what it is so I don't have to go around trying to prove the message is right I just live what the message is because the message is not win Brenham the message is Christ I hear a lot of times he'd say they have to measure they left the message they left the message a whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa no they left Christ that's what they left can we say praise the Lord button sisters I'm just so thankful for a revelation I'm not interested in camps I'm not interested in personalities I'm interested in seeing the life of this gospel in people live that's what interests me I'm not interested how good somebody can quote I'm not interested I'm good they can relay scriptures I'm looking for life that's what I'm interested in can we say praise the Lord and I'll be on there with your brothers and sisters I'm just so thankful that we can see and such a time as this it's manifest in time every fruit every every seed is now coming into fruition because it's harvest time and we're going to be seeing more and more and more things but a believer can't be shaken can we say praise the Lord I think one message is really good to listen to in such the time as this is three kinds of believers I listen to it on the way of the road how is its explaining things I said this is just perfect he said I want to start with the believer because really the other ones don't matter the believer is what's matter and a believer believes can be said for instant law so many things are happening brother sisters but we can't this is not the hour to be discouraged you remember in the Bible when Jesus began to talk about things that's gonna happen to the earth in the war it takes her a groovy picture and then he says look up your Redemption draws nigh it's the sad picture didn't I said look up your Redemption draws nigh so when we see all these things going wrong we have to be excited cadet letting us know we're that much closer to home ain't earned walking around sad and confused no sad I say praise God you know what my soul don't have no joy nobody just like Paul was saying turning back from the word is no joy in that it saddens me but you know what that could have been me if God is not keeping me that's why we don't trust in ourselves and our ability with Justin he that is within us is Christ in me the hope of glory can we say praise the Lord actually what I'm going to preach in just a few minutes I'm just relaxing my spirit been a long time since we've been here in the scripture we reading with Matthew 6 Luke 14 I believe when Jesus was caught in these scriptures I believe Exodus 21 was in his mind and I want to show you what I believe that and you're looking to do it scriptures it is perfect now I'm going to do something I read that quote about dramatizing for a purpose because that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna need some help I already don't picked out who's gonna help so you might wanna but it's simple but if you catch anything catch them thought many really I don't see many good people fall you know people even dementia some people are good people that's leave but when I begin to talk to some women sometimes it's things that they have in their life they have now overcame and they've been going year after year struggling and fighting with the same thing but never got delivered and it pulls them back you know you read a quote the prophet of God talked about as long as we in this flesh we're gonna make mistakes and we're gonna get you didn't get sticky and flesh sometimes I hear people quote that quote sometimes and they wear it out mistakes mistakes mistakes wear it out I tell my church look if you're gonna make mistakes make new ones make new ones because if you keep doing the same thing over and over and over that's actually not a mistake there's somewhere in your life you need some deliverance in that area that's not a mistake the rebirth say I'm just I'm gonna preach to the young people in a minute yes you stand right there you stand right there if I walk or what your brother Sam you there do me one favor I might say something that sounds hilarious but it's not to beat us because you can laugh too much in the service it can break the anointing well are you with me I'm dramatizing better Samuel I believe with all of my heart if I'm walking and I come across and I was the trip and hit him extremely hard trip he was forgiven it's about Sam him sorry he said no problem it might hurt him but he said and what if I just get up can I go she first was a mistake but now he might say whoa oh brother burning something something oh you all right you understanding what I'm saying about mistakes and then custom to keep doing the same thing over and over it has to be some deliverance somewhere you know what I believe in total deliverance that's what I believe in that's what he taught that's what I believe God want his bride to be totally delivered she a mother let's go to Exodus 21 I want you to watch the scripture very carefully Exodus 21 and I want you young people to listen we talking about no man can serve two masters but our you study the Bible history about masters in the Bible's they had tricks that they do to keep people trapped and what we have to understand even when we were young as we were growing up the devil could start trying to do things in our lives to put things in our lives too later on even we become adults and become traps things that we can't break because it wouldn't put there in young hood in our young age so I try to talk to young people about certain things about traps not even just young people even adults how the devil could have something planning and if you ain't careful you can fall into it then it becomes a struggle and hard to get over it it really needs some deliveries so I just want to talk about some of those things if you look in Exodus chapter 21 we want to go to verse 1 we're going to read 1 to 6 now these are the judgment which thou shalt set before them if they'll ban Hebrew serving six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him if his master have given him a wife she had borne him sons and daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters he shall go out by himself and if the servants are playing they say I love my master my wife my children I would not go out free then this master shall bring him to the judges he and he shall also bring him to the door or to the doorpost and his master shall boil his ear through with an awl he shall serve him forever did you notice the language in the description they talking about husband wife master now if you go back to Matthew 6 and Luke 14 it's the same language husband wife master you can't serve two masters so that's why I feel when Jesus was saying that extra 21 was on his mind and it was a purpose for them and we want to just turn it I wanted to show you a simple drama this is very very simple but it's a message in are you with me but then you I mean you in your life to come up please I hope anything gonna I'm not gonna embarrass now sister I need you to sit right there for but thing I need you to come right here just to stand right now I want to show you something in the Bible times a young man can get in trouble can get in debt can get in bondage but there was a law that he could work for seven years to clear his debts and then when the seven years is over he could go free the children of Israel was very aware of that law now Nathaniel I'm gonna use him as an example I need one more person I guess I'm usually better in that's your son you know it won't be offensive when you got to family matter you know man but Arendt I need you to spend right here now this isn't the thing you he don't got into some get he need to get out of it he knows the law of Israel now we gonna call him master Randy this is a master Randy so now he knows the law he know that he can go sell himself to master Randy for seven years to clear his debt then he can go free so now here going his been you I want you to walk up and say hello master Randy he's shaking hand say master Randy Messer Andy I got into a little trouble and I understand the laws of Israel that I could come to you and work to you with for you for a while and that could be free that is correct and what can I do for you son now he said I want to work I want to work for me I can give you a job miss shake hands now and then you go and work so I work and just walk around like I want y'all to catch the story he's working now master Randy's looking at him said what a fine young man we're fine young man now you're done wit by master any little I really like this guy I really like this guy now he's beginning to think hmm he's really been possible he's very profitable and I don't want to let him go let's see I gotta think of something he single and I do have a young girl and I already own yes if I could get those two together I can do something I know your genius cherry now this is master Randy

know what's happening by him just getting eye contact something and now giving a picture in his mind are you with me now say charity I understand he goes to such a certain message Church and I want you to go visit all right now you in church CID night sitting trick like you worship this crappy there now charity when you go to the church I want you to just go in and then you just thought praise like this don't say nothing just go do it clapping you the end game wish [Music] all right just come on back he got no idea but the master is doing behind the scene it looks so innocent he don't have a clue all right now sit down and I want you to come back McDaniel now you see the thing I really like you Daniel I really like you you're doing a very good job but now charity I want you to just walk by again because what don't happen the master done told her when you see me talking to this young man I just want you to pass by but don't see nothing see it's a trap now he's standing here I didn't know charity you come in now he gonna stop her it's a charity here what a surprise you was talking to me and then thing we just talking but then you do you know charity charity do you know anything no

happy everybody happy he said no charity charity I'm gonna go talk to Messer man and they goes master Randy he just doing like this so Natalia comes master Andy Master Andy I really appreciate you I really appreciate thank you for allowing me to get myself on track today but you know today is the seventh year toodle-oo according to the law you are correct when you say you're free to go you're free to go whoa whoa hold on you say you are free to go you are free to go but if I remember correctly I remember correctly okay you came by yourself you leave by yourself if you came if you came with a wife you can take you can take her with you but if I gave you a wife she she belongs to me ain't you and the children you can go you can go but they can but what if you want them if you want them choose to stay you can choose to stay you can you can what so we're gonna have to go through another step you have to be mine soon you do you want to go three man you do you want to go free if you do so the choice is yours freedom without them your choice freedom without bundage or bondage with them she's true he Jew you can't serve Pikachu he can be free you see that's what the devil do he's put traps in your life and even God want to deal with you some things you could be so embarrassed about can be free but I gotta make these things right I have to straighten this out that becomes a trap that's why don't fall for the devil okay look how hard to make a decision because reality struck and we can get ourself into them bangs young people for not careful at a young age the right choice you look at them say I'm sorry I have to go you see in the book of Ezra he done the same thing they married strange wives and they was put to the test do you guys want to be free they said we are willing to put away I was strange wise and our children they beaten in the book of Ezra but look at the pressure now see that's what I brothers and sisters do that which is right dude that which is honest don't let the devil get you in traps because this would be the same result pressure thank you let's give him a hand no man can serve two masters but I am so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ he can wipe all that clean through repentance but the traps what do you think ability I'm said I've got the Catholics promise that you will make keep your children Catholics traps of the master brother promised you a raise your children Catholic Catholic all of those attract we can go on and on and on with all kind of traps there's boy traps there's girls traps it's traps but you got to be able to discern when the devil time set something there because you are the one got to make the decision and make the choice we all frame our agency though we need to be careful of our decisions traps of the master can we get a lot of hair [Applause] let us pray Heavenly Father well thank you for your grace and mercy traps sometimes I even look back in my own life and see some traps but the devil had done but I made the right decision is just as trusting you confess what I need to confess put it on the blood and press on cut for your children mercies and grace and the forgiveness that you have given us but lord I miss to see so many young people get chopped to it so many things their friends their music their movies and has chapped their hearts and chopped their spirits and they just can't break through certain things but because the plans that the enemy had put there but Lord I'm just asking that you just take this simple as a thought tonight and we just let it be impact into our hearts then we can be more mindful other things when the enemy tried to set the snare before it's just in you to deliver us from these things god I love you people I love the young I loved all I love your bride and I just trust you take these simple little things of God just minister to our hearts we thank you for your grace and mercy in the name of Jesus Christ brother make that Nathan I didn't embarrass you guys there it's just a drum tell me what although that would reach down his hand and would do this for me [Music] wait for me [Music] one worthy to live and I'm not fear to give the man all the cross he had my name in his will he said that I I could see won't he say he said that I I could still go free Oh tell me what kind of a man won't reach down here's fan - this for me just for me so unworthy to live and I'm not fear to kill the man all and my name [Music] and he said that I could call free I wonder tonight in the presence of God we could be honest with the Lord those of you that know you were here and the service and no doubt at all that I don't have one doubt at all I haven't talked to brother Randy emprender Nathanael today or anything I don't know what was preached there on Sunday but I've got a good idea that it's right in line and these things right here brother Burleigh I haven't talked to him I don't talk to the man of God whoever's gonna preach I don't even talk to him one of what I've been preaching about I don't tell him I didn't talk to him I don't I don't get into fellowship matter of fact even today I hadn't even it was just a text to brother burly called on Monday it was simply a call about how's the weather look that's it I purposely do not talk about anything you say why because God's bigger than that God already knows what our needs are God has a way of coming around and taking things and making it so personal to our lives that you know one thing for sure that man that brother standing right there he doesn't know you good let me say to you the God who come down and use that gift tonight no she he knows every aspect every part about your life we talked about the predestinated will and the plan of God you realize that can't be defeated and in that as God deals with our hearts that's his mercy and His grace the things that were said I'm not going to re-preach it but I think it's very clear of what was said when that offer was made right here you seen the trap but the offer that was made when the seventh year would come that was known as a year of Liberty where brother Nathanael in acting that out whatever he had in his hand rake hole shovel everything he had been doing I don't care if he had been building a wall as brave if Master Randy if I could say that was had him building a wall and here he was he went to bed that night and fun man I've got more of this wall I got a build but when that seventh year that day that morning dawned he never had to look at that wall and say but I got to finish this out no it's finished it's finished let me just say this to you tonight he said on Calvary it is finished we've got authority tonight to lay everything down you don't have to ask that master you've been in Slate you don't have to ask him no no no you have a promise that has been made real right now I tell you I take this opportunity right now because it's true a mistake is not something we keep on going around in the circle that's not a mistake you say for the semi I need deliverance Liberty has been sounded don't walk out of here and keep building on that same wall but you said right now what was said in the very beginning of this service you make a clear-cut decision don't keep building that wall don't keep laboring in sin if you need a touch from the Lord tonight ask God he's right here matter of fact he's not just here he's right where you're at whatever you have Nina right now a confession laying it not just something just to free up but to go free say Lord right now tonight if you haven't made a decision and make a decision and here tonight for the sake of the gospel you we looked at on Sunday giving my all it's not enough just to come to church it's not enough just to know about the message that's not it that's not what the purpose is it's to know the author and I can tell you tonight by personal experience of what he'll do for your life he will change your life so completely to where it's not something you struggling but where God's grace is living through you where the very desires are changed you might say brother sin no that's that's that's that's pretty simple that's the reality and they will then let us not forget if God's done that work in your life you you ought to be right there in saying Lord is there anything in me am I laboring in certain areas and I'm wasting your time am I wasting your time think about one brother Brown went beyond the curtain of time he comes back he said lord have mercy often Here I am 50 years old and I've not done anything for you Lord it's kind of amazing how he could make that kind of a statement but you see it grips our hearts because we realize Lord it's so much more so much more I wonder tonight as we bow our heads I wonder how many would want to be remembered in prayer tonight we want to pray god bless you god bless your hands he sees your hands and your hearts all Jesus oh how precious he is how precious he is hallelujah he gave his word for you he sent His Word to heal his people how many would like to add to that and say Lord I want to consecrate myself afresh I want to redeem the Time Lord things that maybe with its we look at us they just it's taken time but I want to redeem the time Amen god bless your hands I've got my hand up Lord I want to redeem the time as husbands as daddy's is Mama's wives so I don't want no traps I don't want traps I don't want to present stumbling blocks that with stumbling blocks for me let's pray together and right now we're going to our Heavenly Father the same the same one who came right there to our hearts Lord Jesus what I cannot pray on behalf even though that I would pray for your people but Lord we're praying together Lord through this service here tonight I set their Lord at the very beginning and I marvel at just how personal you are nor do you know the needs you know the needs Lord Jesus may we receive it in that manner that trapped like it was spoke of here tonight he would try to hinder in the mind condemnation our Lord things would want to just try to close or call it to pull back but Lord you've come to speak to our hearts and may we Lord heed to your voice here tonight I believe our hearts have been inclined to your voice tonight the Lord behind every hand is my brothers and sisters we're putting together in this Lord God Lord Jesus we stand Lord in the name of Jesus Christ against every unclean spirit Lord there's no devil no master that can stand Lord God in your presence and father's we stand here tonight Lord in your presence your God taking charge lord over every unclean spirit Lord I pray father if there is any fame Lord the Lord would be hindering any habit Lord father in the name of Jesus right now the name of Jesus Christ Lord may they be loosed Lord God Satan you've got to turn him loose Granite Lord may their heart Lord making that decision I walk alone I walk alone I don't need these things that have come about my life they've only come to try to take me away and take away from that decision that I made that decision was not something that I came up with but it was the impression of the Holy Ghost upon my heart the Living God I want to serve the Lord with all this with enemy I want him to have every part of my life I'll lay it down everything I lay it down under the authority of the call of the word in Liberty Oh in the name of Jesus Christ Satan you're defeated do you believe it right there right where you're at right in your heart you settle it right now it's finished it's finished in the name of Jesus Christ Granite Lord those in need of the baptism of the Holy Ghost father I pray tonight God that Lord that you'll feel every one of them Lord God may their heart Lord God may it be the Lord within that consecration that I've got to have you more than anything else in this life Lord I've got to have you Jesus granite Lord father every hand that Lord was lifted there's hands Lord but God as our hands say Lord forgive me for time that's been wasted I want to redeem the time traps of things that were mentioned family other things that comes up things that don't necessarily look or seems sinful but anything that gets between us and you it becomes a god it becomes a God Lord we love our families we love each and every one but Lord God let there be nothing put between us and you because when it's put between us it's put before you or in the name of Jesus Christ right now why don't you just say Lord align it the right way the line of overcoming is God first family second me last and everything else let there be nothing nothing that hinders say Lord forgive me if there's anything that has gotten in the way maybe it's things it's not as I said that maybe it's not sinful and it's things it just got caught up in and all of a sudden your time your time throughout the day you don't have time seemingly for prayer don't have time any any time here there to get into the Word of God you say Lord I want to redeem the time help me Lord Jesus this is his desire it's his desire Lord granted right now father's your children this is the desire that you stir in our hearts help us Lord to be more sensitive for the more that Lord that we stay in your presence because our our own abilities cannot catch these things Lord the discernment is not of our our natural senses and Lord as the scripture tells us Lord as we're staying in fellowship with you eating upon the meat of the Word of God then our senses become exercised to discern good and evil Lord Jesus we want to have a fresh consecration tonight Lord giving our all or Jesus father we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ for your glory father amen I want to live the way that he wants me [Music] could we stand together until there [Music] this is a prayer [Music] there's just no mourner could never ever the law whoa the way that he wants me to live and I want you give until there's just no more to you I want you love chill that's just no boy for I could never ever out love the Lord I want to live I want to live the way he wants me to or when I want to give him a fuss to speech surrendering but I want you love chill there's just no more love for I could never ever out the law falling in love with G Jesus falling in love with Jesus [Music] us falling in love with G it was the best thing I've ever done Oh falling in love with Jesus Oh falling in love with Jesus Oh falling in love with gee Jesus was the best thing ever ever done in his arms in his arms I fear protected in his arms never disconnected [Music] protecting there's no place side [Music] falling in with geez [Music] falling in love falling with Jesus was the best thing [Music] protecting it is all never did it is uh protected there's no place I'd rather Oh gee Paul and [Music] this thing [Music] [Music] falling in love with Jesus it was the best thing I've ever done [Music] and this is very simple but it's very true turn your eyes upon Jesus look for yet his wonder [Music] for face and the thing [Music] we'll roll straight strangely dim of his glory and brain oh let's turn Oh eyes upon Jesus Oh hallelujah yes Lord it is wonderful face and the face will grow straight in his glory and grace you know I think of that scripture in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says concerning Moses he chose he chose not to be taken with the pleasures of sin for a season but rather the Bible said he endured as seeing him who was invisible and he had respect unto the recompense you know that word respect means it doesn't mean like we think in our language that word respect means he had a mental focus his mind was set on the prize the Holy Spirit had so come into his heart to set that focus and I say to you just as a just from my heart you see things that even where you look at a lot of times when we see it all around us you see people start out in athletes and they think ma they've got years and years and some of them you find after two or three years some of them don't even make it a year and yet this is what they have labored for their entire life and I don't care if they had an opportunity to play for 13 15 whatever how many years it's just a season it's like that I look back I'm 44 years old and I think my goodness just 26 years 26 years ago seemed like that it just seemed just like that [Music] I tell you give every moment give everything you've got to Jesus every part of your life everything give it to you give everything to him don't you love him tonight let's just bow our heads father thank you tonight Lord thank you for you your word that you spoke to our hearts thank you Lord but the man of God you're serving brother burly as he came in what it's happened those of us as ministers we know what that's like many times you feel like you're going to preach something and all of a sudden things change you're writing down scriptures that are coming to you Lord that's what the ministry is all about it's not about preaching what we want to preach it's not about a good sermon it's about you coming on the scene and that hearts and lives are touched by you and drawn to you thank you for your word tonight Lord every person in here and every young person oh god may they see the love and care that you would take your servant tonight and you would wait till it comes to walk

heart this is my seventh year I'm going free I'm going free I'm going free I'm gonna take the word of the Lord this is my set of the year I'm going free Lord God may they never take their eyes off of you but may they as the song would say falling in love with you and just keep falling in love with you and just watching Lord God as the word is working and just casting things out Lord dismantling
