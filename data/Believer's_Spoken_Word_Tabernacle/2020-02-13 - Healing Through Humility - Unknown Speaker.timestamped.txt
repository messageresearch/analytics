[21:42] a promise we have and we see that we see
[21:45] that that day is moving in amen there's
[21:50] been a rising of the Sun it's a very
[21:53] dark world it's the darkest time there
[21:55] is but that day star has a rose in our
[21:58] hearts Amen to herald the day that's
[22:01] coming amen and I'm glad this is not
[22:04] what we have to look forward to I'm glad
[22:07] that we have that reality that which God
[22:10] has prepared for us to look forward to
[22:12] it really gives us comfort in the midst
[22:15] of tests and trials is to look to that
[22:17] and to know truly when we stand there on
[22:20] the other side in that day as Paul said
[22:23] that trials he said at that time he said
[22:25] the those things he said it's not worthy
[22:28] to be that glory it's not worthy to be
[22:31] compared with those things that where we
[22:34] suffer now it's not even worthy to be
[22:36] compared and I'm sure when we get there
[22:38] that day we'll say the toils of the road
[22:40] there were nothing and yet we feel like
[22:44] we feel the effects we feel the
[22:46] suffering we feel all of that in these
[22:48] bodies but you know sometimes God allows
[22:51] those things he permits nothing can come
[22:54] our way unless he permits it but it's
[22:56] always those are just reminders we're
[22:58] not fully home yet
[23:02] amen in our soul we're already there
[23:06] amen we're living under the effects of
[23:08] that land amen well we just love the
[23:11] Lord tonight and we want to just turn in
[23:13] our Bibles here if we would to second
[23:16] Kings chapter 5
[23:24] and verse one is where we want to just
[23:28] begin and we'll read a free verse of
[23:29] scripture and then we'll just let you
[23:31] have your seats
[23:38] now naman captain of the host of the
[23:43] king of syria was a great man with his
[23:46] master and honorable because by him the
[23:49] Lord had given deliverance unto Syria he
[23:52] was also a mighty man in Valor but he
[23:56] was a leper and the Syrians had gone out
[23:59] by companies and had brought away
[24:01] captive out of the Land of Israel a
[24:04] little maid and she waited on naimans
[24:07] wife and she said unto her mistress
[24:10] would God my lord were with the prophet
[24:14] that is in Samaria for he would recover
[24:17] him of his leprosy and one went in and
[24:22] told his lord saying thus and thus said
[24:25] the maid that is in the Land of Israel
[24:26] and the king of Syria said go to Golan
[24:31] I will send a letter unto the king of
[24:33] Israel and he departed and took with him
[24:35] ten talents of silver and six thousand
[24:40] pieces of gold and ten changes of
[24:43] raiment and he brought the letter to the
[24:46] king of Israel saying when this letter
[24:48] has come unto thee behold I have
[24:51] therewith sent naman my servant to thee
[24:54] thou mayst recover him of his leprosy it
[24:58] came to pass when the king of Israel had
[25:00] read the letter that he rent his clothes
[25:02] and said and my God to kill and to make
[25:07] alive that this man does send unto me to
[25:10] recover a man of his leprosy
[25:12] wherefore consider I pray you see how he
[25:16] seeketh a quarrel against me and it was
[25:19] so when Elisha the man of God had heard
[25:22] that the king of Israel had rent his
[25:24] clothes that he sent to the king saying
[25:27] wherefore hast thou and thought my
[25:30] clothes
[25:31] let him come now to me and he shall know
[25:35] that there is a prophet in Israel let's
[25:39] just pause there
[25:42] Amen maybe you have a need you want to
[25:44] make known to the Lord tonight amen lift
[25:47] up lifted hands and more just pass by my
[25:51] way

[26:01] portion of the service Lord we're want

[27:32] speak to our hearts in a personal way
[27:34] tonight Lord take your word and just
[27:36] deliver to us Lord we pray in the
[27:39] precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[27:41] god bless you you may be seated
[27:44] I wondered if we could let's just resume
[27:50] reading there in verse nine it said so
[27:57] naman came with his horses and with his
[28:01] chariot and he stood at the door of the
[28:03] house of Elijah and Elijah sent a
[28:06] messenger unto him saying go and wash in
[28:10] Jordan seven times and I flesh shall
[28:12] come again to thee and thou shalt be
[28:15] clean but naman was Roth and went away
[28:19] and said behold I thought he will surely
[28:23] come out to me and stand and call on the
[28:27] name of the Lord his God and strike his
[28:29] hand over the place and recover the
[28:33] leper are not abdomen far part rivers of
[28:38] Damascus better than all the waters of
[28:40] Israel may I'm not washing them and be
[28:43] cleaned so he turned and went away in a
[28:47] rage notice these words that are
[28:49] descriptive here in in in in this
[28:52] portion he's Roth and he goes away in a
[28:56] rage these are not just things that are
[28:59] just internally but sometimes you and I
[29:02] both know there's some times people can
[29:04] keep we say a gain face they can keep
[29:07] their face everything is just right but
[29:08] inside it this was not the case here and
[29:13] his servants came near and spake unto
[29:16] him and said my father no watch this if
[29:20] the Prophet had bid thee to do some
[29:22] great thing wouldest they'll not have
[29:24] done it
[29:25] how much rather then when he said to the
[29:28] wash and be clean then he went down and
[29:31] dipped himself seven times in Jordan
[29:33] according to the saying of the man of
[29:35] God and his flesh came again likened to
[29:38] the flesh of a little child and he was
[29:41] clean and he returned to the man of God
[29:43] he and all his company and came and
[29:45] stood before him and he said behold now
[29:47] I know that there is no God in all the
[29:52] earth but in Israel now therefore I pray
[29:55] thee take a blessing of thy
[29:58] and I just in my heart just just really
[30:02] just meditating on these things when I
[30:04] walked off the platform last Thursday
[30:06] the Holy Spirit just met me and just
[30:08] spoke to my heart there with on this
[30:10] this portion of Scripture that we're
[30:12] reading and I just you know just
[30:15] meditating on it and saying Lord what
[30:19] would be the direction we've been
[30:20] dealing with healing there's much ground
[30:23] even to be covered and to me it's been a
[30:27] real when I say a refreshing it's been
[30:30] refreshing there's things that God has
[30:33] continued to open and make so personal
[30:36] when it's come to healing and things
[30:38] that we haven't even got into yet but my
[30:40] heart's desire is that that it would be
[30:43] a blessing and a help to our lives and
[30:46] to our walk because sometimes we can all
[30:48] be honest here and if I could say it
[30:50] like this we can all let our hair down
[30:52] in the sense that there's a lot of
[30:54] things that's very simple but yet if you
[30:56] try to explain it you can't explain it
[30:58] it's just like when we deal with faith
[31:00] healing is the same way you can try to
[31:02] explain it but yet the reality is you
[31:04] finally get to a place and say you know
[31:06] what I just I'm just I just look to the
[31:09] Lord and it just comes to this place of
[31:11] what it is we we are all depending on
[31:13] God there's things that many things that
[31:17] we can look at and I believe that God
[31:19] unfolds things to you and I and has he
[31:23] unfolds it it's not that we would become
[31:26] more knowledgeable as far as in our mind
[31:29] but then when we but the reality when
[31:32] God teaches us things it's to position
[31:34] us and in the positioning of us it's
[31:37] that we might become more ulid we become
[31:41] more aware of the domain that is given
[31:43] to us as the sons and daughters of God
[31:45] this is where brother Branham would take
[31:47] us in the message adoption he said
[31:49] there's a need for preaching preaching
[31:50] reaches out and it takes ahold of the
[31:52] center and brings that center unto God
[31:54] he said but then once he's come then you
[31:56] need the teaching of the word to
[31:58] position us and establish us I'm
[32:00] grateful to God God has done and he
[32:03] worked in both ways in this hour and God
[32:05] has brought to us his word and and truly
[32:08] it takes more than just a man to bring a
[32:11] teaching it takes a whole
[32:12] goes he's the true teacher of the church
[32:14] he's the true evangelist he's the true
[32:16] prophet he's the true apostle it takes
[32:19] the Holy Spirit to work through his
[32:20] gifts to minister to our lives but I
[32:22] want to deal with this thought tonight
[32:24] on healing through humility we were
[32:28] looking at some thoughts last week and
[32:31] looking at things of based on on the
[32:34] authority of the word and sometimes we
[32:37] we hear things and sometimes we we can
[32:39] be within ourselves it can be do I go up
[32:42] and get prayed for and we can find we
[32:45] can find things that where we see in the
[32:47] scripture they shall lay hands on the
[32:49] sick that's still the scriptural order
[32:51] then we then we have this of the Roman
[32:54] centurion and we say well Jesus said I'm
[32:57] not found so great a faith in all of
[32:59] Israel his faith was all that that man's
[33:01] faith was already at a point he did not
[33:04] need his faith to stimulate it anymore
[33:06] it was ready to receive it but there are
[33:08] times that within all of us and they
[33:11] just say it in this manner God's faith
[33:13] never wavers our faith can waver
[33:18] that is why that we need the help of
[33:21] Almighty God we are regarded as sheep
[33:24] and we need the Shepherd and the Bishop
[33:27] of our soul to minister to our lives and
[33:30] to bring to us as brother Brown would
[33:33] say he put gifts in the church to
[33:35] encourage our faith to stimulate our
[33:37] faith he said all of those things are to
[33:40] go together that all the attributes of
[33:43] Jesus Christ could be made manifest in
[33:45] the body of Jesus Christ I'm glad he
[33:48] knows what I have need of and it's
[33:50] something that that as I said that when
[33:53] we look at this with humility it's
[33:55] things that I want to be and I'm sure
[33:57] you do as a as a believer I want to act
[34:00] upon all parts of God's Word because as
[34:02] we were looking at it last week you can
[34:04] never come to a place in the word and
[34:06] say well we're beyond laying on of hands
[34:08] I think it's very clear and if it was
[34:10] and I pray that God make it clear of how
[34:12] that the brother branham was going
[34:14] through that in the scripture and
[34:15] bringing it to you and I that it never
[34:17] was to do away with with a laying on of
[34:19] hands but it's to bring the whole part
[34:22] is that our focus is placed
[34:25] on the Lord Jesus Christ it's not upon
[34:29] any man's hands it's not any monies it's
[34:31] not any man's hands that heals you it's
[34:35] your faith in God and God's the one who
[34:38] does the work and to be honest you know
[34:43] I'm a just God just go ahead and say it
[34:45] you know talking with some of my
[34:47] brethren you know and we were just
[34:50] talking and some of the brother and we
[34:52] were when some of my African friends
[34:54] were here visiting you know and some of
[34:56] the things you know you go through we
[34:59] learn things as we go along in our
[35:01] journey you look back and you you look
[35:03] back over your life and you've learned
[35:04] things and we ought to be growing
[35:06] brother Branham says you know he said we
[35:07] first started out in the meetings he
[35:09] said you know we were like a person
[35:10] swimming we you get done he said but
[35:14] eventually you'd grow he said you get to
[35:16] a spot you can make those strokes and
[35:18] you're not tired
[35:21] we need that wisdom of the Lord and you
[35:23] know I think of how the brothers we were
[35:25] talking about he said we used to pray as
[35:27] though we were the ones saving the
[35:28] people he said we used to pray as though
[35:31] we were the ones healing I'm where we
[35:32] prayed as though we were the ones giving
[35:34] the Holy Ghost he said no we just pray
[35:35] God's the one it's his work and those
[35:39] little things like yet it just you know
[35:40] it resonates in your in your heart
[35:42] because that's truly what it is it's
[35:43] just it's it's it's God doing the work
[35:46] so I want to look at this thought here
[35:48] healing through humility and when we
[35:51] look at this whole part when we look at
[35:53] humility humility is that which God
[35:57] desires and humility will always draw
[36:01] God on the scene and it was humility to
[36:06] accept the will of God his path to
[36:08] accept the healing and the or the
[36:11] leading of the Lord the Scriptures go on
[36:13] let me just go through a few scriptures
[36:15] here the first Peter 5:5
[36:17] it says you younger submit yourselves
[36:21] unto the elder all of you be subject one
[36:24] to another and be clothed with humility
[36:27] for God resisteth the proud and giveth
[36:31] grace to the humble humble yourselves
[36:36] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[36:38] that he may
[36:39] Sault you in due time casting all your
[36:42] care upon him for he careth for you
[36:46] James 4:6 it says he giveth more grace
[36:50] God resisteth the proud but giveth grace
[36:54] unto the humble we all want grace verse
[37:00] 7 this this verse of scripture so many
[37:03] times this first part is left out and we
[37:05] go right to the latter part but the
[37:07] first part you can't have the latter
[37:09] without the first submit yourselves
[37:11] therefore to God this submission here is
[37:14] is that of where voluntary attitude of
[37:18] where we bring ourselves under the Word
[37:21] of God Lord your word is true you know
[37:25] you and I both know you cannot it's not
[37:28] up to your eye to choose the way or the
[37:32] path or the leading or even how our
[37:35] healing comes it's not the pathway is
[37:38] not in our hands to choose you we see
[37:41] that even I think was very it's clearly
[37:44] laid out before us in the scripture here
[37:47] submit yourselves therefore to God
[37:49] resist the devil and he will flee from
[37:52] you verse 8 says draw nigh to God and He
[37:57] will draw nigh to you say how do I do
[37:59] that it's very simple anything that
[38:02] would be between you and God's Word from
[38:05] being fulfilled in your in you in in
[38:07] your life just say Lord forgive me
[38:09] cleanse me brother Brown would say it
[38:12] just this simple in the in the message
[38:14] gyrus healing and irises daughter
[38:18] brother Bram comes to the latter part of
[38:19] that message is getting ready to start
[38:20] into the prayer line he said right now
[38:22] remedy everything within your heart he
[38:24] said maybe you say in your heart brother
[38:26] BAM I've been a little critical of you
[38:28] brother Brown he said but why don't you
[38:29] you said you just say in your heart said
[38:31] Lord forgive me Lord brother branham's
[38:33] my brother
[38:34] I love brother Branham he's a he's used
[38:36] he's used of you just that simple just
[38:40] that simple it doesn't mean to say to
[38:41] you it doesn't take long drawn-out
[38:44] prayers repentance is something
[38:48] confession is something that can be done
[38:50] in a moment's time
[38:53] sometimes even a person can go so long
[38:57] and what it is they're not wrestling
[38:59] with God they're wrestling with
[39:00] themselves but to know that God is
[39:03] present and to realize that the drawn
[39:06] lines are gone if there's anything that
[39:08] comes up at all and I say it just even
[39:10] while the ministering of the word is
[39:12] going going on don't wait till the end
[39:14] relinquish it right then right then in
[39:18] your heart these are some things we'll
[39:19] look at here tonight draw nigh to God
[39:21] and He will draw nigh to you Psalms 34
[39:26] verse 17 the righteous cry and the Lord
[39:29] heareth and delivered them out of all
[39:31] their troubles verse 18 the Lord is not
[39:35] into them that are of a broken heart and
[39:37] save it such which be of a contrite
[39:40] spirit many are the afflictions of the
[39:44] righteous but the Lord delivers him out
[39:46] of them all Psalms 51 17 the sacrifices
[39:51] of God are a broken spirit a broken in a
[39:54] contractor and me just be very specific
[39:56] with this and on this what we're
[40:00] speaking of a broken heart and a
[40:02] contrite spirit is not self condemnation
[40:07] humility I think it's a very good
[40:10] statement that has been made humility is
[40:13] not thinking less of yourself it's
[40:17] thinking of yourself less let me repeat
[40:21] it humility is not thinking less of
[40:24] yourself it's thinking less it's not
[40:27] thinking less of yourself
[40:28] it's thinking less about yourself where
[40:32] you're not the one in the forefront
[40:33] you're not the one then it's always
[40:35] everything's about you
[40:40] that's humility so we understand because
[40:45] sometimes these things can get confused
[40:47] and oh I'm a poor Christian I'm a
[40:48] portrait that's not humility that's not
[40:52] humility humility is is where simplicity
[40:56] remember as a son and daughter of God
[40:57] God deals with our heart and quickly in
[41:00] our heart to say Lord it's not just in
[41:03] the times of repentance but it's always
[41:04] having
[41:05] open heart Lord lead me and guide me and
[41:08] direct to me don't let this be about me
[41:13] don't let it be about me o God thou wilt
[41:19] not despise I love that in this
[41:21] scripture isaiah 57:15 for thus saith
[41:24] the high and lofty one that inhabiteth
[41:26] eternity
[41:28] whose name is holy I dwell in the high
[41:31] and holy place with him also that is of
[41:35] a contrite and a humble spirit to revive
[41:38] that word revived there deals with
[41:40] making oh the spirit of the humble and
[41:43] to revive the heart of the contract ones
[41:46] what a paradox in the scripture dwelleth
[41:49] I who is holy dwelleth in a high and
[41:52] holy place but yet notice what humility
[41:55] that he would come to revive the spirit
[41:59] of the humble to revive the heart of the
[42:02] contrite ones that's what real power is
[42:06] humility is real power hallelujah and in
[42:12] this you you realize that here was such
[42:15] a contrast even when the Lord Jesus was
[42:18] here and throughout and even in even in
[42:21] the world
[42:22] anybody that has many times any sort of
[42:24] a reputation or people want to make a
[42:27] reputation or they want to just let you
[42:30] know they know you and I both know we're
[42:38] not ignorant you can tell when people
[42:39] have an air about them almost like
[42:43] they're a little bit better
[42:44] I know a little bit more I know that's
[42:47] not humility humility is even when
[42:51] everything that can be known but is
[42:54] there a heart behind it is there a heart
[43:00] behind it is there a heart that's
[43:02] governed by the wisdom of God in that
[43:04] moment to know what to do this is where
[43:08] we have to continue think God to
[43:10] continue to grow look at this in Isaiah
[43:13] 66
[43:14] thus saith the Lord the heaven is my
[43:16] throne and earth is my footstool
[43:18] where is the house that you build unto
[43:20] me and where is the place of my rest for
[43:23] all those things hath mine handmaid and
[43:26] all those things have been saith the
[43:28] Lord but to this man will I look even to
[43:32] him that is poor and of a contrite
[43:34] spirit and trembling at my word humility
[43:39] draws the attention of God we've been
[43:46] reading from Exodus 20:5 and I'm not
[43:48] going to read back over that scripture
[43:49] but this is where we've been drawing and
[43:52] the inspiration coming from where God
[43:54] would one of the places that God would
[43:57] make known one of the compound
[44:01] redemptive names one of his compound
[44:03] redemptive names as Jehovah Rapha I am
[44:05] the Lord that healeth II but remember as
[44:08] God revealed that the need was the water
[44:12] is bitter and God showed Moses a tree
[44:15] and he was to cut that tree down and put
[44:18] it into the water there had to be
[44:20] something that he did this is a part of
[44:24] this is where it comes down to it
[44:26] requires humility to the word Moses
[44:29] could have looked and said what in the
[44:32] world but you see look these are things
[44:35] that what we realize when the
[44:38] inspiration is moving you and I can look
[44:40] back at that and say that's a type of
[44:43] Calvary because on the tree person is he
[44:47] hung on a tree he was wounded for my
[44:50] transgressions we can see our lives was
[44:54] filled with bitterness but because he
[44:58] became me that I might become him by
[45:02] grace the bitterness of my life now is
[45:05] made sweet in my soul I deal with
[45:09] bitterness maybe in our flesh and our
[45:11] spirit from all sorts of things that
[45:13] comes up sicknesses but yet that
[45:15] sweetness is what's able to provide for
[45:18] that bitterness we can see that as a
[45:22] type but you see they didn't see that
[45:24] and say well this is a type what I'm
[45:26] doing they didn't see it in that way but
[45:28] you say well then how were they doing it
[45:30] they were
[45:30] - the same inspiration that you and I
[45:33] are under tonight and you and I take
[45:36] courage and take faith within that they
[45:38] were walking under the channel of
[45:41] inspiration in that hour hallelujah
[45:48] David is moved and we these are familiar
[45:51] Scripture you're David cries out bless
[45:53] the Lord O my soul and all that's within
[45:55] me who forgiveth forgetting all all his
[45:57] benefits who forgiveth all thine
[45:59] iniquities who healeth all that diseases
[46:02] and it's very important I am the Lord
[46:04] that healeth all thy diseases it is him
[46:07] that healeth all our diseases it is him
[46:11] this is why here take of how when
[46:15] brother Branham would draw our attention
[46:17] over and over from the early all the way
[46:19] through and he would he would just let
[46:21] you and I know because he had people
[46:24] that were calling him a divine healer
[46:27] well he's a divine healer brother brands
[46:28] are not a divine healer he said if you
[46:31] preach salvation are you called a savior
[46:33] no we're pointing to a finished work is
[46:39] that right this is why this is why any
[46:43] man that claims to have in his hands
[46:45] that will if I'll have power in my hands
[46:47] to heal you I'll lay my hands on you
[46:49] Miliband said you remember that person
[46:51] is telling you something that's not true
[46:53] because there's no one in the world can
[46:55] heal anybody healing comes only from God
[46:59] Almighty and think of it in John we can
[47:04] go John 5:19 here is the Lord Jesus he
[47:08] even Jesus Christ
[47:11] he didn't even claim to be a healer are
[47:14] you with me he didn't even claim to be
[47:16] here remember when he went in healed he
[47:19] just just did not do that on self-will
[47:22] he said in John 5:19 I can do nothing
[47:27] remember when that was healed on this on
[47:30] the Sabbath day he did not just go over
[47:32] and heal the man how the self will know
[47:35] he was governed by the will of the
[47:39] Father my father worketh an
[47:42] I work as hitherto so it was not a no it
[47:45] was a submitting of his will to the will
[47:48] of God I tell you that's victory right
[47:50] there that's power right there that's
[47:52] restoring what was lost that's restoring
[47:55] what was in God's mind is where I will
[47:59] is surrendered to his will he said I
[48:03] said the son can do nothing in himself
[48:05] he only do that which the father sees
[48:07] him drew hallelujah
[48:12] so I brother branham would ticket pick
[48:14] it up I think in 64 1964 Christ
[48:18] identified the same in all generations
[48:19] that we had the wrong slant regarding
[48:22] prophets he said it was never he said of
[48:25] that a prophet that they themselves did
[48:28] anything it was God using that he said
[48:30] we've even had the wrong slant on the
[48:32] body of Jesus Christ he said it was not
[48:35] the body doing it it was God in Christ
[48:38] Jesus said I can do nothing it's my
[48:45] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[48:48] works been said of a son of God didn't
[48:52] claim to be a divine healer how much
[48:53] more could a man said no man can do what
[48:57] Christ has already done program was
[48:59] asked a question what's your opinion on
[49:00] medicine brother Bannerman you know in
[49:03] many places still he answered but he
[49:05] comes back around he says look I'm the
[49:07] Lord that he loves all that diseases the
[49:08] Bible can't lie God heals by medicine
[49:11] God heals by love God heals by
[49:14] understanding God heals by care God
[49:16] heals by prayer God heals by miracles
[49:19] the whole thing God heals that's all
[49:23] there is to it
[49:24] he's the healer there's no medicine no
[49:27] medicine you could take will build
[49:29] tissue an antibiotic it only attacks
[49:32] those cells that's there it only attacks
[49:35] that which is there in your system is
[49:37] that right life is the healer that's why
[49:41] you could have a cut and here you die
[49:44] they could put all kinds of penicillin
[49:46] and everything else on that cut it'll
[49:48] never heal why life is the healer the
[49:52] penicillin and nothing else does the
[49:54] healing
[49:56] is the healer now look at this with
[49:58] naman naman here is a situation the
[50:05] sovereignty of God you can't look at
[50:08] this and other situation in the
[50:10] scripture even when it comes to your own
[50:11] life and not see the sovereignty of God
[50:15] that here in this captivity here so
[50:18] literally you ever thought about the
[50:19] young girl who was taken captive and
[50:21] here she is a servant in the house to
[50:25] naimans wife she might be wondering why
[50:27] am I here
[50:28] Here I am taken captive you know Here I
[50:32] am and in a situation I meant but let me
[50:35] just want a message we could preach on
[50:37] that she did not let her condition steal
[50:40] her joy she still knew there is a God in
[50:46] Israel I might be in the land of Syria
[50:50] but God knows right where I'm at she was
[50:54] still a testimony and a witness no
[50:57] matter where she was at and she's the
[51:00] one when she's seen the condition in
[51:02] naman she said would to God that he
[51:06] would go there to the Land of Israel
[51:08] because there is a prophet there that
[51:10] could recover him of his leprosy now
[51:14] somebody could read that or hear that
[51:16] and they could get the wrong thinking
[51:17] but to her she knew exactly what she was
[51:20] saying
[51:20] she knew that he was not the man but she
[51:24] knew God was press and fair in that
[51:27] Ministry of Elisha is that right that's
[51:31] what she was talking about he tried all
[51:37] the doctors think about this he tried no
[51:40] doubt he tried all the doctors how do I
[51:43] get better Neiman had a secret about his
[51:45] life a mighty man of Valor but he had a
[51:47] secret he had leprosy in his life let me
[51:53] just tell you something no matter what
[51:54] the secret is in your life you can look
[51:56] like a fine person and a good person and
[51:58] everything's right but is there a secret
[52:00] in your life is there a secret there of
[52:06] leprosy that needs to be healed
[52:10] God is the healer amen
[52:17] think of it she had such a witness in in
[52:20] her life not think of this
[52:22] there's not one case I'll read the
[52:24] scripture here in a moment
[52:25] there's not one case that this little
[52:26] young lady could point to and say
[52:28] there's been many cases of leprosy
[52:30] healed that was in any case that she
[52:33] could even point to now we're going to
[52:36] read that in the scripture in just a
[52:37] moment there was not one case that she
[52:40] could say you know there was this
[52:41] particular man I know or there was this
[52:43] one in Israel there were no cases of
[52:45] anybody else ever being healed of
[52:47] leprosy but you know what that didn't
[52:50] stop her from having a testimony say the
[52:53] Lord God can recover him of his leprosy
[52:58] because she believed there was no
[53:00] disease crater crater then God you and I
[53:07] if I say like this privileged spoiled I
[53:11] don't know if I would say it but many
[53:13] times God has has has made known so many
[53:17] things before you and I and I know I
[53:19] don't care what else other disease they
[53:21] come up with but many of the things that
[53:23] even the you and I can go through and
[53:25] don't Google it Google is not the
[53:29] prophet of the hour come on somebody oh
[53:33] I'm getting a little ache here I'm
[53:36] getting a little crook here I'm getting
[53:37] a little pain here what could this be
[53:42] wrong thing to look at what do I need to
[53:47] look at if there's anything that's gone
[53:49] wrong you first need to look to the Lord
[53:52] I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills
[53:55] from winds come in my head my help
[53:57] cometh from the Lord because the first
[54:01] thing you know you're going on reading
[54:03] that junk and then you'll start talking
[54:04] about it at the dinner table and
[54:07] claiming that stuff and the more you
[54:09] talk about it your body will obey your
[54:12] confession
[54:14] [Applause]
[54:17] that's a little bit spilling over there
[54:21] he packed up many he was going to go by
[54:24] his healing he packed up gold packed up
[54:27] raiment but God was letting gonna let
[54:29] him know you can't purchase healing with
[54:32] your own goods
[54:34] you got to purchase it with a measure of
[54:36] faith that I give you don't have what's
[54:41] needed to purchase and release this
[54:43] healing but God had dealt to every man a
[54:45] measure of faith is that right so all
[54:48] the glory comes back to God
[54:51] oh ma but he made up his mind you know
[54:54] brother bran would say it like this he
[54:56] said he wanted to vine healing the way
[54:59] he had his mind he had made up in his
[55:01] mind this is the way that I'm gonna get
[55:03] it he shows up and here there's the
[55:09] Elijah you know a license you're sitting
[55:11] in here maybe y'all can't see it back
[55:15] there so maybe I'll do it up here here
[55:18] is Elijah maybe he's back there where
[55:20] brother Drake is that and he lashes back
[55:21] in his in the cave there brother Brent
[55:24] said he was reading the Bible reading
[55:27] the scriptures he was just back there
[55:29] and your cell phone was silenced it was
[55:33] turned off then okay nothing gonna
[55:34] distract me from my time with Jesus
[55:36] hello somebody come on now Elijah didn't
[55:41] even get up out of the chair
[55:43] he sent a messenger to go tell naman
[55:48] naman got an attitude
[55:51] you don't know who I am you don't see my
[55:55] ranks you see my rings

[56:09] Bible study god help us to have grace
[56:13] for the pastor that way preach brother
[56:16] Samuel I think I will think about this
[56:21] here he sent him in there and here
[56:25] Elijah didn't even go out to him I
[56:28] wonder what people would have said
[56:30] regarding Elijah
[56:31] he's stuck up God forgive me for saying
[56:36] that but that's no you know this and
[56:38] that but you know what God knows what
[56:40] needs to be done he got a pack naming
[56:42] down a little bit
[56:44] Neiman's coming in there and he's trying
[56:46] to approach God as though we're eyeball
[56:48] to eyeball were level to level
[56:50] God said mm-hmm I'd well on the hind
[56:53] holy place I bow down to you grow
[57:01] repeated God and Amon got an attitude he
[57:06] got rough he went into a rage this to me
[57:10] when I look at this here this there is
[57:13] no way when we read here in the
[57:15] scripture let me just read in the
[57:17] scripture and then I'll preach for just
[57:18] a moment Luke 427 this is the testimony
[57:22] of the sovereignty of Almighty God of
[57:26] what took place in this time in the
[57:29] scripture we're reading about and Jesus
[57:32] points out the election and sovereignty
[57:35] of God and many lepers verse 27 were in
[57:39] Israel in the time of alias or in lie
[57:43] Elisha the prophet and none of them was
[57:46] cleansed look at your neighbor and say
[57:50] none of them none of them was cleansed
[57:55] many were in Israel but none of them was
[57:58] cleansed saving naman the Syrian let's
[58:02] be honest you and I looking at that
[58:05] attitude we might have thrown him out on
[58:06] his head you get an attitude you're
[58:11] getting rough you're in a rage but what
[58:14] mercy of God he's a Gentile what mercy
[58:18] of God how many others came to Elijah
[58:21] and they came there brother answered
[58:24] brats thousands of lepers in that day
[58:27] and not one of them were cleansed but
[58:30] here is a man that came up there and he
[58:33] had a thought he's going to come out and
[58:35] he will salute me and he will put his
[58:37] hand on the place and pray for me in the
[58:40] name of the Lord God of Israel he will
[58:42] put his hand on the play
[58:43] you know recover me of my leprosy and
[58:45] God lets me know that I it is not your
[58:49] thoughts that I'm coming to but you have
[58:52] got to think my thoughts hallelujah Oh
[59:00] glory be to God sometimes it's written
[59:03] friends the problem is it isn't the word
[59:06] of God it isn't well glad you haven't
[59:08] healed me yet it's about Lord let my
[59:10] thoughts let your thoughts become my
[59:13] thoughts and you can plan that across
[59:17] the board within anything there's a lot
[59:19] of things that we can fake well it
[59:21] didn't happen this way it's loaded in
[59:23] Scripture Jesus did not come and do what
[59:26] jumps are they ought to do but that
[59:28] didn't remove who John was it did not
[59:31] change are you with me it didn't change
[59:34] but you see all the while even here with
[59:37] name and what mercy of God there's no
[59:42] way in the world that God can heal can
[59:45] heal namin when he's mad and he's upset
[59:50] holding the grudge against somebody come
[59:52] on now help me preach he can't do that
[59:55] you see but God's desire is to heal him
[59:57] or what mercy think of his mercy for you
[1:00:01] and I you and actively man leavened his
[1:00:05] wife in my head but God said I've got to
[1:00:08] change the atmosphere in this person's
[1:00:12] life let me tell you something God is
[1:00:16] more determined to heal you than you are
[1:00:19] he's more determined to save you than
[1:00:23] you ought to be saved he's more
[1:00:25] determined to fill you with the Holy
[1:00:27] Ghost than you're determined if we got
[1:00:32] what we deserve he'd wipe his hands and
[1:00:34] walk away he would say you're ungrateful
[1:00:37] but God knows just like in Genesis 1
[1:00:41] where it was dark and void their needs a
[1:00:44] change of atmosphere so he sends his
[1:00:47] word to bring healing to our lives
[1:00:50] to change the atmosphere hallelujah what
[1:00:56] mercy do we deserve it
[1:00:59] no no but God who is rich in mercy he
[1:01:09] has changed the atmosphere hmm
[1:01:16] many of them came but they weren't
[1:01:19] healed you're where when you read in the
[1:01:24] scripture in the Prophet Elias Elijah's
[1:01:28] ministry many things were done with
[1:01:34] symbol the ax head we've lost the ant
[1:01:38] said he said bring me a stick he put it
[1:01:42] in the water it didn't need the stick he
[1:01:45] could have said come the stick was a
[1:01:48] symbol it's active faith my sons are
[1:01:54] going to be taken captive what movements
[1:01:56] what must we do
[1:01:57] go borrow a bunch of vessels though al
[1:02:01] is coming but you're going to need
[1:02:02] vessels and you're gonna have to pour
[1:02:04] you see the Ministry of Elijah how it
[1:02:08] types the Ministry of Jesus Christ in
[1:02:11] his body it's the same ministry that was
[1:02:15] in Elijah in Elijah it is active it is
[1:02:19] the word being active in our lives
[1:02:25] remember when the Lord told him brother
[1:02:30] Branham an angel the Lord spoke to him
[1:02:34] he told him he said the only thing you
[1:02:36] have to do he says you're gonna pray for
[1:02:40] sick people and get them get them to
[1:02:44] believe you to believe you be sincere
[1:02:50] with your prayer and no disease would
[1:02:52] stand before your prayer I'm gonna read
[1:02:53] this he said now that doesn't mean my
[1:02:56] prayer has anything to do with it it's
[1:02:59] the people's faith
[1:03:02] he's always listening this he's always
[1:03:05] had an object somewhere for people to
[1:03:08] look at something he said the brass
[1:03:10] serpent the water in the Pool of
[1:03:13] Bethesda John five why was that water
[1:03:16] why there's no virtue in it it was just
[1:03:19] something for the people to do to step
[1:03:22] in Jesus went and spit on some mud and
[1:03:25] made a little cake and put it in a man's
[1:03:27] eye he didn't have to do that he didn't
[1:03:32] have to make put the mud on the man's
[1:03:33] eyes he could have said receive your
[1:03:36] sight eyes would have been created we've
[1:03:38] seen that in this very he didn't have to
[1:03:43] do that another man's ear split and
[1:03:47] touched his tongue where he spit and
[1:03:49] touched his tongue he didn't have to do
[1:03:51] that
[1:03:51] it was a symbol he said naman was
[1:03:55] supposed to dip seven times in the
[1:03:56] Jordan what he didn't have to do that it
[1:03:59] was just a symbol that the Prophet give
[1:04:02] him to do something to do and now watch
[1:04:06] how he brings this something for you to
[1:04:10] do God send some of us forth to do
[1:04:14] certain things
[1:04:15] he's breaking over into the ministry and
[1:04:17] when we see that God has proved what he
[1:04:20] said he was to that person and then God
[1:04:23] testifies the thing that the person
[1:04:26] testified of that makes it truth then we
[1:04:30] believe it and get well so what is it
[1:04:35] that God requires of us to do is to
[1:04:38] believe to believe what he has done in
[1:04:43] this generation and what are you still
[1:04:46] doing let me just say it very closely
[1:04:48] you may not you look at the story or the
[1:04:51] account of John five and looking at the
[1:04:54] Pool of Bethesda and you're reading it
[1:04:57] but to realize that itself was speaking
[1:05:00] of even when you in your heart you know
[1:05:03] the Spirit of God maybe you know can't
[1:05:05] even identify it in that term but you
[1:05:08] know there's something that's caught a
[1:05:10] hold in me right now there's
[1:05:12] something there's one who's speaking to
[1:05:14] me it is not that man who speaking to me
[1:05:16] and you recognize that God's presence is
[1:05:19] personal what is that it's the same one
[1:05:22] who sent the angel to trouble the water
[1:05:25] it's time to step into that don't try to
[1:05:28] figure it out is it for me I wonder if
[1:05:31] he made a mistake no it's in your heart
[1:05:33] and you know he's talking to you
[1:05:35] that's a supernatural experience robbed
[1:05:38] by a supernatural God it is a sin to
[1:05:41] disbelief it's to act upon that and do
[1:05:47] what he is asking you to do it's soul
[1:05:51] it's so real that if you don't you only
[1:05:55] become more hard once again you know he
[1:06:03] makes that he makes the same statement
[1:06:07] he says he told me if I'll get the
[1:06:09] people to believe when and then he said
[1:06:11] when I ask you to do something and you
[1:06:13] don't do it to God that is you don't
[1:06:16] believe it no matter what I tell you to
[1:06:19] do now those of you and all of us should
[1:06:24] be listening to the message that God has
[1:06:27] sent us in this ayah but you'll hear
[1:06:30] times on the platform go rejoicing the
[1:06:33] Lord make you well brother brems said I
[1:06:36] just can't say when they come up there
[1:06:37] you're healed there's a time where
[1:06:40] healing is pronounced their faith has
[1:06:42] already brought it brother brems said
[1:06:44] it's a supernatural something he said
[1:06:46] that God allows me at that time to
[1:06:48] pronounce that healing because it's
[1:06:50] already done and then you hear other
[1:06:51] times go on your way with dosing what
[1:06:54] they're rejoicing and sometimes you say
[1:06:56] go on testifying about it they're not as
[1:07:00] far as of where we're in that it sense
[1:07:03] it was a miracle right there they're
[1:07:05] walking off of there and it is based on
[1:07:07] will you rejoice will you testify of
[1:07:11] your healing I mean you're saying like
[1:07:16] this get up of a morning and straighten
[1:07:18] up your tie and say I'm healed
[1:07:22] you might be standing crooked in the
[1:07:24] mirror and you said I'm healed by his
[1:07:28] stripes I'm healed and all I'm talking
[1:07:32] about why is it he's the high priest of
[1:07:37] our confession he's a rock hey friends
[1:07:44] every one of us know you get around
[1:07:46] negative people it's a negative
[1:07:48] atmosphere let's speak the positive
[1:07:53] truth of God's Word Oh hallelujah you
[1:08:00] don't name it name and he had that
[1:08:01] leprosy until he obeyed muddy down there
[1:08:07] how bad you want heals
[1:08:09] he might have struggled with you know
[1:08:13] what he said there's rivers up here it's
[1:08:14] a lot better God didn't say up there God
[1:08:17] sent her out here and he he had to be
[1:08:22] spoken to
[1:08:23] hey if he'd asked you to do some big
[1:08:25] thing you'd have done it God's dealing
[1:08:28] with pride aren't you glad God deals
[1:08:32] with pride he knows just how to tap down
[1:08:38] our pride I mean you know you're not
[1:08:41] gonna get a special crown because you
[1:08:43] never took a Tylenol only thing you're
[1:08:46] doing to making yourself miserable now
[1:08:47] now if you can't take it that's fine
[1:08:50] but you understand what I'm saying these
[1:08:53] are not things that when we look at
[1:08:55] pride you can't choose the way that
[1:08:58] healing comes but our faith is in God
[1:09:01] God heals by all those different avenues
[1:09:05] oh mama
[1:09:09] brother BAM bringing this around here
[1:09:11] and this is where I want to bring this
[1:09:12] down to he deals with how he said you
[1:09:15] know many times he said people are more
[1:09:18] or less they're going after the gifts
[1:09:20] instead of the giver he's talking about
[1:09:26] many things then this particular message
[1:09:28] on divine love he's talking about even
[1:09:30] with healing he said we were left off
[1:09:32] the key the main key and we've rushed
[1:09:34] the door and it goes in and he deals
[1:09:38] with he said now the gift that I've got
[1:09:40] in my life right now
[1:09:42] no gram said I'm trying my best with the
[1:09:45] gift that God has given me to let you
[1:09:48] see that he loves you love produces
[1:09:55] faith Galatians 5:16 faith worketh by
[1:10:00] love love is a trust the scripture said
[1:10:11] in first John for there is no fear in
[1:10:16] love but perfect love cast out fear
[1:10:20] because fear hath torment he that
[1:10:24] feareth is not made perfect in love we
[1:10:27] love him because he first loved us I
[1:10:31] think it's fitting in humility that when
[1:10:36] fear wants to make its approach that we
[1:10:40] can say Lord let love rise in my heart
[1:10:44] that perfect love don't ask fear do you
[1:10:48] think you can leave it cast it out Jesus
[1:10:53] never said ask Devils to leave he said
[1:10:55] cast him out glory be to God hallelujah
[1:11:04] perfect love cast out all fear
[1:11:11] hallelujah run withdraw and let me just
[1:11:17] lay these these parts in and he was
[1:11:19] dealing with this he said the idea isn't
[1:11:21] for you to touch me you need to touch
[1:11:24] him and he says the main thing he's
[1:11:28] telling the people as you're sitting
[1:11:30] here in this service and these are very
[1:11:31] important words the main thing is to set
[1:11:35] with an open heart and say Lord Jesus I
[1:11:38] believe the next statement very much
[1:11:44] like that he says if you'll just sit
[1:11:47] there and say Lord
[1:11:48] Jesus I love you Jesus Christ draws near
[1:11:55] no to set with an open heart and belief
[1:11:59] do you realize friends that is we're
[1:12:01] setting we're coming we're sitting right
[1:12:03] here whether words coming forth
[1:12:04] you realize healing itself can come
[1:12:08] right as the words coming for our faith
[1:12:12] can raise to that level we're even that
[1:12:16] goes beyond our thinking about our own
[1:12:18] face how many times that brother branham
[1:12:21] here under the inspiration concert or
[1:12:23] you didn't know you had that much faith
[1:12:25] did you
[1:12:25] but God already healed you it's
[1:12:30] tremendous but it's to set in a humility
[1:12:34] and say Lord I love you brother Brown
[1:12:40] takes this and I'm coming I'm gonna
[1:12:42] close on this brother branham brings
[1:12:46] here there's a man by the name of mr.
[1:12:48] cross and I want you to listen to this
[1:12:51] thinking about the little woman who was
[1:12:54] their captive in Syria would to God
[1:12:58] would to God but naman my lord that he
[1:13:03] would go to the Prophet that is in
[1:13:05] Israel he could recover him see she has
[1:13:11] a revelation of what she's saying
[1:13:13] naimans approach he's looking just at
[1:13:16] the man that God knows how to open his
[1:13:23] sight here's a man by the name of
[1:13:27] brother Kraus brother Ram speaks of it
[1:13:28] in a message divine love I've often
[1:13:30] thought about this many times the Lord
[1:13:33] is really quick and it to bring this out
[1:13:35] today this brother had been saved in in
[1:13:40] in in brother Oral Roberts ministry he's
[1:13:42] a fair friend a brother branham's friend
[1:13:44] of Oral Roberts and he will own one of
[1:13:47] the greatest plow companies or plow
[1:13:48] making companies in America and he had
[1:13:51] been saved Ram said he had received the
[1:13:54] new birth but he said one day he
[1:13:56] developed a sickness
[1:13:58] he said now you know you can put your
[1:14:01] trust in the wrong thing he said if
[1:14:03] you've got your trust in a man or in
[1:14:06] your church or in your organization you
[1:14:08] better take it off right now and put
[1:14:11] your love to Christ it won't work now he
[1:14:16] loved the Lord he developed the sickness
[1:14:18] and he loved the Lord now watch what he
[1:14:20] says here now
[1:14:21] and he said well oral brother Oral
[1:14:24] Roberts orals his representative so I'll
[1:14:28] just go to oral so he developed a
[1:14:31] serious trouble in his body and he goes
[1:14:32] out to dinner with brother Roberts
[1:14:34] he tells brother Roberts his testimony
[1:14:36] he said brother Roberts I've got a
[1:14:38] serious kidney condition brother Roberts
[1:14:41] said well the Lord will take care of
[1:14:43] that he walked over and prayed for him
[1:14:46] he said now don't you feel better yeah
[1:14:47] he said I I do feel better just after a
[1:14:50] few hours I was back again he went back
[1:14:53] to Hall Roberts two or three times again
[1:14:56] well he said it well he wouldn't do no
[1:14:59] good and the man gave the testimony
[1:15:01] brother brems in a meeting and brother
[1:15:03] branham heard him give this testimony he
[1:15:06] said what's the matter he said I know
[1:15:09] what I'll do I'll go down and stand
[1:15:12] before brother Branham and he will tell
[1:15:14] me my prophecy just exactly what caused
[1:15:17] it are you listening so he goes to
[1:15:22] Shreveport where I was trying night
[1:15:25] after not to get in the line couldn't
[1:15:27] get in the line no card he'd get a card
[1:15:31] but then he never get called to come in
[1:15:33] the line so I went from there to Mexico
[1:15:36] that failed him you know he says he goes
[1:15:40] back and he said to everyone he goes
[1:15:42] back after this he's tried to get to
[1:15:44] brother Branham and after this to
[1:15:46] everyone that he knowed this man brother
[1:15:49] Krause he gets to everyone he knows that
[1:15:50] was preaching divine healing and he had
[1:15:53] them pray and lay hands on him it didn't
[1:15:55] do no good he would be like here he's
[1:15:59] come to hold Roberts he comes in - you
[1:16:01] know - brother Brannon he couldn't get
[1:16:02] to brother branham get in the line so he
[1:16:04] goes through you know you don't have
[1:16:06] this maybe let's say it's on his phone
[1:16:08] he gets his contact list and the
[1:16:10] grouping is divine healers
[1:16:12] or those who pray for the sick and he's
[1:16:14] going through there he calls this one
[1:16:15] sends a text to this one hey when's your
[1:16:17] next meeting gonna be I want to be right
[1:16:19] there

[1:16:21] go to this meeting hey I'm gonna be
[1:16:22] right there I'm gonna go to this meeting
[1:16:23] it would look like by the statement they
[1:16:26] are God's representative but God is a
[1:16:29] jealous God he will not share his glory
[1:16:32] with no one you with me even though God
[1:16:39] works through that ministry God will
[1:16:43] share no glory with any flesh it's all
[1:16:48] God so he went to male brothers the
[1:16:53] doctors did some tests on him and they
[1:16:56] told him you've got one chance out of
[1:16:58] 10,000 of ever coming off the table he
[1:17:02] said I guess this is it I want you to
[1:17:05] really hone in right here so he goes
[1:17:08] home and he prays he said Lord Jesus you
[1:17:12] knowed my walk beforehand you know my
[1:17:14] walk now you know that how I've tried to
[1:17:17] live for you I've done everything I've
[1:17:18] testified the businessmen across the
[1:17:20] country I've give my entire life ever
[1:17:22] since I become a Christian four or five
[1:17:24] years ago to serve you here it has at
[1:17:27] the end of the road this is what's very
[1:17:29] important I love you Lord I've only got
[1:17:34] one way out now and that's maybe if I
[1:17:37] could have the operation I'm just
[1:17:39] trusting you he went back told the
[1:17:44] doctor he said sign me up for the
[1:17:46] operation and he went to go to sleep in
[1:17:51] there preparing him for operation he
[1:17:54] said well now Lord you know I love you I
[1:17:57] want you to know that I love you and I
[1:18:00] have to if I have to down the operating
[1:18:02] tally on the operating table I left you
[1:18:06] with all my heart
[1:18:07] the Rebbe said he went to sleep under
[1:18:10] the ether the anesthesia praising the
[1:18:13] Lord because he loved him love had come
[1:18:17] to its end he loved brother Roberts
[1:18:20] brother Roberts as a man he loved me I'm
[1:18:22] a
[1:18:23] he looked out their brethren brother
[1:18:25] Valdez and many of the others they were
[1:18:27] men but then when he found out that all
[1:18:29] the men had failed he only had one thing
[1:18:32] to look at that was Christ that's the
[1:18:35] one now he's on the right track was not
[1:18:41] all Roberts's representative he was was
[1:18:44] not brother branham the prophet of the
[1:18:47] age is represented he was he is was not
[1:18:50] brother Valdez a representative he
[1:18:53] indeed was but you see God can see where
[1:18:57] the focus is that if it was focused upon
[1:19:01] if I can just get to this man if I can
[1:19:03] just get to this man it's not the man
[1:19:06] you need to get to its get to Jesus
[1:19:09] Christ understand this is the same thing
[1:19:14] that happens with people if I can just
[1:19:16] go to this church I'll live a victorious
[1:19:18] life maybe I need to go to this church
[1:19:21] I'll live a victorious life correction
[1:19:23] you need to get in Jesus Christ and then
[1:19:26] you'll live a victorious life so when he
[1:19:32] was in the operating room he said Lord
[1:19:36] if I die I love you with all my heart
[1:19:41] they say I've got one chance out of
[1:19:44] 10,000 the best doctors in the world one
[1:19:47] chance out of 10,000 let's think about
[1:19:49] this bill joy here he is he's going
[1:19:51] under that anesthesia good I love you
[1:19:56] yeah if I die from this operating him he
[1:20:01] didn't know he was coming out of that
[1:20:02] operation alive he didn't know that this
[1:20:05] sounds like the Hebrew children here in
[1:20:09] Lee sounds like Daniel they didn't know
[1:20:11] what was going to happen but what he
[1:20:13] said is I love you I love you with all
[1:20:18] my heart
[1:20:23] and when he woke up from that operation
[1:20:27] the whole room was lit up with the glory
[1:20:30] of God
[1:20:31] the doctors were astounded at the glory
[1:20:34] of the Lord that filled that room
[1:20:37] Wow because one of his children think of
[1:20:41] it he dwelleth in a high and holy place
[1:20:44] pundants ended and was worshipped by one
[1:20:49] of his children one of his children
[1:20:52] better that was wounded there in his
[1:20:55] body but that didn't stop his praise I
[1:20:59] love you if this is my end I love you I
[1:21:04] just want you to round Lord I love you
[1:21:08] and the glory of the Lord filled that
[1:21:11] room where the branch says see he got
[1:21:15] normally and well within just a few days
[1:21:17] he never seen anything take place like
[1:21:20] that he said but what it was when the
[1:21:25] lung when divine love had been projected
[1:21:28] in the right direction
[1:21:34] what was the Ministry of Malacca for
[1:21:37] that to turn our hearts get it in the
[1:21:40] right direction
[1:21:44] aren't you glad that you can recognize
[1:21:46] the God of Elijah aren't you glad that
[1:21:50] you can recognize that that same God he
[1:21:52] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:55] aren't you grateful that when you can
[1:21:57] hear the Ministry of Malachi for that
[1:22:00] who you see is Jesus Christ why others
[1:22:03] see just a man but you don't see a man
[1:22:05] you see Jesus Christ and others look at
[1:22:09] and say well that's brother Branham
[1:22:11] that's brother Branham know what you and
[1:22:12] I we know we don't see that or we don't
[1:22:15] see brother rather what we see is Jesus
[1:22:17] Christ it has made this Bible become a
[1:22:20] new book to you and I
[1:22:22] why divine love is in the right
[1:22:25] direction it can be so close it's God's
[1:22:31] representative it's God's prophet but to
[1:22:34] recognize naman had a testimony
[1:22:37] I'm coming before God's prophet but his
[1:22:40] approach was not in humility but God
[1:22:45] knows how to work with us to bring us in
[1:22:52] the right direction aren't you glad
[1:22:55] about that but the joy he just takes
[1:22:57] that scope and says it's a little off
[1:22:59] right here let's tighten this right off
[1:23:01] aren't you glad for that brother Dave he
[1:23:04] just tightens it right off and says now
[1:23:06] you're hitting the target I'm so glad
[1:23:09] about that there's not one of us here in
[1:23:13] this building tonight that at some point
[1:23:15] in time or another haven't been like
[1:23:17] mainland oh maybe you weren't rolfe or
[1:23:19] maybe you weren't in a range but there's
[1:23:20] some times where you've questioned why I
[1:23:23] thought it was going to be like this I
[1:23:25] thought it was going to be like this now
[1:23:27] listen to me take your thoughts and put
[1:23:31] it in the hands of God if you came and
[1:23:34] were prayed for and you went out and
[1:23:37] said how I'll feel no different I
[1:23:38] thought put your thoughts in the hands
[1:23:41] of God and you stand upon what God has
[1:23:44] made known to you if you came and you
[1:23:47] stood here for prayer or in your seat
[1:23:49] you said lord I receive it however God
[1:23:52] dealt with you you stand on that little
[1:23:55] salmon you don't know my symptoms
[1:23:56] symptoms are the biggest liar it is the
[1:24:00] biggest enemy of faith I'm not saying if
[1:24:06] you get worse like you know for example
[1:24:07] you might get worse hear you after
[1:24:09] you're prayed for and then you've got to
[1:24:10] call an ambulance don't struggle with
[1:24:12] whether to call an ambulance or not go
[1:24:14] ahead and get in the ambulance and say
[1:24:15] thank you Lord for my healing don't be
[1:24:19] defeated don't let the devil try to
[1:24:20] defeat you because all healing comes
[1:24:24] from God
[1:24:25] I hope it's a big help and I really mean
[1:24:42] that with all my heart because there's
[1:24:45] so many different ways that when we come
[1:24:46] and we approach things within healing
[1:24:48] but I my heart's desire is lord knows
[1:24:51] where we're at he knows what we're going
[1:24:52] through he knows what we will come
[1:24:54] through but I said god help us to be so
[1:24:57] zeroed in and help us that this would be
[1:24:59] it it would just help us that our faith
[1:25:02] would increase within him wants me to
[1:25:06] dip in the Jordan seven times I want to
[1:25:08] do that the dipping in the Jordan of
[1:25:10] seven times is to do and be in obedience
[1:25:13] to what God is telling you to do my
[1:25:18] healing is gonna come that way sometimes
[1:25:20] the way our healing comes but the Bram
[1:25:22] talked about a man in greatest battle
[1:25:24] ever fought the man had a dream he
[1:25:26] thought it was brother brems said joki
[1:25:28] and he came in told brother Branham the
[1:25:30] dream for the Rams had come to find out
[1:25:32] what he thought was joking was the very
[1:25:34] answer for his wife's healing sometimes
[1:25:39] the way that we're thinking about things
[1:25:41] I think it's safe to say we can say lord
[1:25:43] help me to think your thoughts there's
[1:25:48] nothing wrong to have expectations
[1:25:50] friends then let our expectations be on
[1:25:53] the Lord
[1:25:54] it's like Noah I love how brother Ram
[1:25:57] brings that would Noah Noah got in the
[1:25:59] Ark and he told his family he said get
[1:26:01] ready God's just set the door it's gonna

[1:26:10] said it's coming tomorrow y'all get
[1:26:12] ready no rain did that for seven days

[1:26:35] and now you have said this daddy this is
[1:26:40] where brother brems says it in conflict
[1:26:41] between God and Satan

[1:26:52] and told me to build this Ark it's gonna
[1:26:56] rain and we're in the place of safety I
