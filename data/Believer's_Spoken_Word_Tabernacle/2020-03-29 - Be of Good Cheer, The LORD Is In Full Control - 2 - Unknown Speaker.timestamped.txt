[34:48] perfection
[34:49] were in that week our salvation comes to
[34:52] its end where we move from this this
[34:56] life into that next life into that body
[34:58] that is waiting for us because not only
[35:01] did Calvary within the atonement it's a
[35:04] dual atonement
[35:05] it was the atonement for our soul and
[35:07] the atonement for a body and we
[35:10] experienced the effects and the
[35:12] realities of that here in our soul we're
[35:16] to know that he had forgiveth all our
[35:19] iniquities he brings a reality and a
[35:22] release in our heart from that old
[35:24] nature we've been set free and then
[35:26] while in the course of this time he made
[35:29] a promise to us that hew he lifts of all
[35:33] diseases so that covers the gamut of
[35:37] everything no matter what pandemic or
[35:39] whatever comes we have the promise of
[35:42] assurance in the Lord no matter what new
[35:45] name new want no 1 acronym they come up
[35:47] with we have the promise God has it
[35:50] fully covered amen we know that none of
[35:52] these things could have happened if
[35:54] there would not have been a fall in the
[35:56] beginning and any sickness or anything
[35:58] that God permits to come our way Satan
[36:01] can do nothing even in bringing what we
[36:04] have experienced and see even how that
[36:08] this has brought not only our nation but
[36:10] many other nations to a standstill and
[36:13] has brought us to a place to where where
[36:16] we are were gathering like this to try
[36:19] to comply and to help and do our part
[36:21] even as the citizens of this nation that
[36:24] we are part of but we recognize that
[36:28] there is a great reality wherein that
[36:32] Christ himself has made a way that we
[36:34] can be free first of all from the
[36:37] greatest plague and the greatest plague
[36:39] is death spiritual death is to be free
[36:43] from sin
[36:45] amen and we know that that's the last
[36:47] plague to strike the land and that left
[36:49] leg is striking the land I'm talking
[36:51] about spiritual death it's been striking
[36:53] the land that's the most severe splegg
[36:55] there is his spiritual death and so we
[36:58] thank God for a provision that's been
[37:00] made a man through Calvary and how truly
[37:04] our eyes have been anointed to look and
[37:06] to be caught in that blood stream where
[37:09] we can be identified as sons and
[37:11] daughters of God in this hour I want to
[37:15] say here the the this afternoon we
[37:21] certainly love and appreciate each and
[37:22] every one of you I want to say thank you
[37:25] mom I want to say that I appreciate how
[37:29] that the different ones that have come
[37:31] here to be able to man the different
[37:34] position so that we could be able to

[37:42] appreciate brother Brian holdren brother
[37:46] Brian's work in laboring throughout the

[38:01] given him that it's we it's been a

[38:12] Brian you know it's just uh just a real
[38:16] wonderful brother he and sister Susanna
[38:18] and their family and we just appreciate
[38:20] them for that there's things that
[38:21] they're even working for with me right
[38:23] now or some other things and one of the
[38:26] things that I want to do in coming up
[38:30] here this coming week someday I don't
[38:33] know exactly what platform I'm going to
[38:34] use but I would like to maybe just have
[38:38] a little bit of a an informal time and
[38:41] I'll be doing this from my home or I'll
[38:44] just entertain questions and answers
[38:47] pertaining to these things right here
[38:49] that we are dealing with I believe that
[38:51] God has been answering a lot of
[38:53] questions that even are not set forth or
[38:57] maybe haven't been set forth but maybe
[39:00] one thing without me really elaborating
[39:02] on our preaching about it today we
[39:05] recognize that within it that where
[39:08] their head there has indeed an
[39:11] announcement of plagues and and that
[39:13] from the Book of Revelations from
[39:15] revelations 8 and we recognize all of
[39:18] those things even when we look at that
[39:20] within Egypt and we know that there are
[39:23] plagues that are coming upon the earth
[39:25] that will come upon the earth and that
[39:27] will fall upon everyone without the
[39:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost do I believe
[39:33] that this is that no I I don't but I
[39:35] don't have the word of the Lord on that
[39:37] but I can't say that that's what this is
[39:40] because I believe God gives us the
[39:42] strength in the anchor that in the midst
[39:44] of no matter what comes my faith and our
[39:47] faith is to rest in that God is our all
[39:51] sufficiency no matter in any situation
[39:54] the main thing is is to be in Goshen and
[39:56] Goshen is a type of Christ to be under
[39:59] the blood that's the main and most
[40:01] important thing within this I think
[40:04] we're wasting energy if we're trying to
[40:06] figure everything out God has given us a
[40:08] clear promise light has come to us in
[40:11] this hour and I'm grateful for the Holy
[40:13] Spirit that he is the one who delivered
[40:16] to us the word in this hour and he's
[40:18] present to bring it together and to
[40:20] enlighten us in every step of the
[40:22] journey I'm so grateful that one of the
[40:25] things that to me it wasn't just a song
[40:27] that brother Branham was singing at the
[40:29] end of the message leadership the
[40:32] brother Branham at the end of that song
[40:33] at the end of that service if you'll
[40:35] notice he sings a song god be with you
[40:39] till we meet again and that is truly the
[40:43] reality is God is veiled in his bride
[40:46] that same the same age of the Lord the
[40:49] same Holy Spirit the same God is here
[40:51] with us so I want to and I'm going to
[40:56] look at doing it
[40:57] perhaps on either through a certain
[41:03] instrument that I use for the youth
[41:06] meeting on Friday night we had a
[41:07] wonderful youth meeting but it was all
[41:08] over the over the platform that I used
[41:12] the zoom platform and I was able we were
[41:14] able to see one another's faces and I
[41:16] was able to interact with them and we
[41:19] had a nice Bible study and just a real
[41:21] wonderful time fellowship around the
[41:24] word of the Lord and so we certainly
[41:26] look for that once again
[41:29] and I would say this to you if those
[41:32] that are part of this assembly I know
[41:34] myself I don't have a Facebook account
[41:36] and I'm not planning on getting one but
[41:38] if there is someone as you are here a
[41:41] part of this assembly because this
[41:44] particular streaming thing that I'm
[41:45] going to do where I greet the assembly
[41:47] this is just for the local assembly I'm
[41:49] not going outside of the local assembly
[41:52] I'm staying just confined here so if you
[41:55] have some of you that have not linked up
[41:58] into Facebook yet I want to encourage
[42:01] you if if you and your spouse or
[42:02] whomever do that for not only this time
[42:05] but also for even announcements that'll
[42:10] come and I know like I said not
[42:11] everybody has Facebook but we have to do
[42:14] we'll do the best that we can and we're
[42:17] gonna try we'll let you know hopefully
[42:19] by tomorrow by way of email on how that
[42:22] we're going to approach that and just to
[42:25] have a little bit of time where I can
[42:26] kind of kind of just greet you and talk
[42:28] to you and maybe there won't be any
[42:30] questions and that would be fine it
[42:32] would be fine as well but there be some
[42:34] things we can just have a little bit
[42:36] where I can just just deliver a little
[42:39] bit of a direct connection with you I
[42:42] certainly miss all of you my I miss all
[42:45] of you
[42:45] we we're so that's the hardest thing
[42:48] that within the midst of this as my wife
[42:50] and I were talking is just we just we
[42:53] just miss being together with the rest
[42:57] of God's children it's nothing that does
[43:00] my heart good
[43:01] you know I just I love being together
[43:03] and that's something that the love of
[43:05] God puts in your heart amen as we see
[43:09] that the brother BAM told us from the
[43:10] love of God is in your heart you can't
[43:11] wait for the church doors to open you
[43:13] can't wait to get together with the rest
[43:15] of your brothers and sisters so we're
[43:18] just certainly looking to the Lord and I
[43:21] don't know exactly you know I don't have
[43:24] anything of a date for us or whatever at
[43:27] this time but without any further ado
[43:29] I'll you know be able to speak to you on
[43:32] some sort of a platform and I'm kind of
[43:34] looking at this to be on Tuesday
[43:37] Tuesday evening that I can kind of just
[43:40] be able to just address you a little bit
[43:43] and it'll be more informal I'll be in my
[43:45] office at home so may the Lord bless you
[43:48] and I'm so thankful that God's provided
[43:51] all of these different avenues for us we
[43:54] want to remember and the prayer requests
[43:57] we want to remember sister Shirley crest
[44:00] that the Lord had just continued to move
[44:01] for her she's been dealing with a lot of
[44:03] pain and they have been continuing to
[44:05] move her surgery back and so we want to
[44:09] we just want to ask that the Lord would
[44:12] just move down for sister Shirley and
[44:15] God would relieve that pain
[44:18] and so we just we want to just bind our
[44:20] hearts together with that also for
[44:22] brother Mark Schaefer in the time of his

[44:56] before you in your hearts and also for
[44:59] our brother Gabriel that God would just

[50:19] amen
[50:22] hallelujah I want to go to Acts chapter
[50:28] 27
[50:29] I just just felt just to go ahead while
[50:37] we would this was still so fresh in our
[50:38] hearts and our minds just the Lord just
[50:41] seemed to press some things up on my
[50:46] heart and I want to just move to verse
[50:51] verse 20 and just read there and when
[51:00] neither Sun nor stars in many days
[51:04] appeared and no small tempest lay on us
[51:09] all hope that we should be saved was
[51:14] then taken away but after long abstinent
[51:19] Paul stood forth in the midst of them
[51:22] and said sirs
[51:24] you should have hearkened unto me and
[51:27] not have loosed from Crete to obtain
[51:29] this harm and loss and now I exhort you
[51:33] to be of good cheer for there shall be
[51:36] no loss of any man's life among you but
[51:39] of the ship for there stood by me this
[51:42] night the angel of God whose I am and
[51:46] whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou
[51:50] must be brought before Caesar and lo God
[51:53] hath given thee all them that sail with
[51:58] thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer
[52:03] for I believe God that it shall be even
[52:08] as it was told me
[52:10] howbeit we must be cast upon a certain
[52:15] Island amen may God bless you bless the
[52:19] reading of his word
[52:21] I want to continue with that the title
[52:26] be of good cheer the Lord is in full
[52:28] control
[52:31] but I want to draw your attention here
[52:34] in the scriptures and as we recognize
[52:40] that perfect peace what perfect peace is
[52:46] is to have the governing of all things
[52:49] under the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[52:52] it's to let every one of our five
[52:54] natural senses see taste feel smell in
[52:57] here and every spiritual sense
[52:59] imagination reasoning conscience memory
[53:02] affection to let all of those be under
[53:05] the governance of the holy spirit all
[53:09] our abilities all our skills all the
[53:13] understanding he has given us is to be
[53:15] brought into submission to him and that
[53:19] is our responsibility and that is where
[53:25] we are to arrest every thought or bring
[53:29] every thought into captivity all the
[53:33] natural senses which God he has given us
[53:37] the natural senses in order to contact
[53:41] our earthly home
[53:44] and yet within that he never placed that
[53:48] we would be led by our natural senses
[53:52] neither are we to be led by our
[53:55] spiritual senses but it is to be
[53:58] governed by the holy spirit or rather
[54:00] that's sixth sense that faith that faith
[54:04] of God that is deposited in our lives
[54:08] now as we were looking at in this even
[54:12] on Thursday that very as Paul let him
[54:17] know you should have listened to me
[54:19] you should have hearkened to what was
[54:21] being said and we recognize that you
[54:26] know many times we are in the face of or
[54:29] we have been or will be in the face of
[54:31] individuals that are more trained than
[54:34] what even we are even where you know
[54:39] when someone would be maybe in a
[54:43] situation medically and everything where
[54:46] the medical doctors what they have wrote
[54:48] they have diagnosed by the symptoms and
[54:51] the knowledge and everything and even
[54:53] according maybe to all of their machines
[54:55] they can look at all of that and they
[54:58] make a declaration but yet within it we
[55:02] have a choice will we allow that of
[55:06] their abilities and thank God for it we
[55:09] don't shirk that at all but we realize
[55:11] that we also have another report we know
[55:16] that like brother Branham would say it
[55:18] like this for the RAM called doctors
[55:20] God's agents we know that they're God's
[55:23] agents God has allowed him to tap into
[55:25] that in order to help suffering humanity
[55:28] let me just say it like this maybe for
[55:31] you or I let's say for your eyes that it
[55:34] was something where we did not need
[55:36] doctors or there was not a channel we
[55:38] would go by a medical way still for
[55:41] somebody who does not know God in that
[55:44] way or have access to that place if
[55:47] there is something that could be
[55:48] available to help them in our hearts as
[55:51] a Christian as a believer we do not want
[55:55] to see humanity suffer
[55:57] this is why we even reach out and we
[56:00] have within us to give reason of the
[56:02] hope that lies within us we have within
[56:05] us as Peter said sanctify the Lord
[56:07] always in your heart that you might be
[56:09] able to declare it what is within your
[56:11] bosom to be able to lead others we the
[56:14] desire within our heart truly when God
[56:17] has ever touched that live and what God
[56:20] means to you and I we know that we
[56:22] cannot give it to somebody else but all
[56:25] if it was in our ability to open
[56:27] somebody else's eyes we would do it if
[56:31] it was in our ability to heal somebody
[56:33] we would do it but we but what we can do
[56:37] and what we do have is access to the one
[56:39] that has done it in us the one that we
[56:42] know that is able and and willing and
[56:45] ever-present to fulfill his word so even
[56:49] in this our natural leadership our
[56:51] natural or our natural senses our
[56:53] natural abilities this is why and that
[56:57] you know even when I had spoke to young
[56:59] people in some meetings before and even
[57:02] here in our local youth meetings but
[57:06] even when in the other places where I've
[57:08] been to mention to them that listen you
[57:11] might have an education that ranges into
[57:13] a PhD level and your pastor may not have
[57:17] even a high school graduation he may not
[57:20] even have even a high school diploma but
[57:22] what you have to realize is God has
[57:25] allowed you to come to that ability that
[57:28] you have those skills have been refined
[57:31] that he placed within you but never
[57:33] substitute the leadership of the Holy
[57:36] Spirit for your natural abilities it's
[57:38] always to bring us into that place to
[57:41] submit under the leading of the Lord
[57:43] that it's not a Doctorate submitting to
[57:45] a middle school education but it is our
[57:48] lives submitting to the authority of the
[57:51] Holy Spirit that's where this age has
[57:55] failed they have looked at things that
[57:58] you know remember they feel so rich and
[58:01] they have need of nothing there's got to
[58:03] be such training what school did you
[58:04] have from are you qualified never has a
[58:07] school qualified a man
[58:08] it is God that qualifies that man God
[58:12] does not call the qualified God
[58:14] qualifies the called it's God who does
[58:17] the work
[58:18] hey man it's God who'd who makes the
[58:20] calling so within this it's our lives
[58:23] that have a continual direction that we
[58:26] find to come under the leadership of the
[58:30] Holy Spirit our reasonings and our our
[58:32] imaginations and the reality is that for
[58:35] all of us we all face that battle over
[58:38] and over even in every different
[58:41] situation you even face that battle who
[58:46] in someone where the enemy would try to
[58:47] come into your mind and maybe somebody
[58:49] walks walks by and they didn't shake
[58:51] your hand and immediately the enemy says
[58:53] I see what that person did and this and
[58:56] brother BAM says you'll find yourself if
[58:57] you start entertaining that you start
[58:59] acting differently toward that brother
[59:02] so we understand it's constantly to have
[59:05] to bring it in line with the Holy Spirit
[59:08] we need and for that we need God's grace
[59:12] so I look back at the scripture here in
[59:16] in in acts 27 and where the scripture
[59:20] when Paul would write this is the third
[59:22] day he went and there was neither Sun
[59:24] nor stars in many days appeared and no
[59:28] small tempest lay on us and all hope
[59:31] that we should be saved was then taken
[59:34] away you see Paul look remembers we were
[59:39] saying on Thursday God had wrote his his
[59:42] his word in the heavens there are things
[59:45] that even when we come in through times
[59:48] where we are praying and we are looking
[59:51] for the will of God in a situation and
[59:53] we don't get a direct answer and we're
[59:56] looking for God we know we have direct
[1:00:00] precious promises but we're looking and
[1:00:02] saying Lord what is your mind in this
[1:00:06] situation what we're asking for if we're
[1:00:08] actually asking God it would you reveal
[1:00:11] that this situation that it's past it's
[1:00:15] over with that's what we're asking is
[1:00:17] for direction for his course you see
[1:00:20] they had taken a core
[1:00:22] in sailing this ship and the course the
[1:00:26] time and everything by not heeding to
[1:00:29] the word of the Lord they come into a
[1:00:31] trouble a situation because they did not
[1:00:34] heed the counsel and so within it Paul
[1:00:39] Paul's declaration was all hope that we
[1:00:44] should be saved was then taken away
[1:00:47] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:00:49] regarding this he said Paul was just as
[1:00:53] scared as the rest of them
[1:00:57] it might be hard to swallow but maybe
[1:00:59] get your glass of water next to you to
[1:01:01] help you walking about with chains on
[1:01:04] him
[1:01:04] any minute the old ship would capsize
[1:01:07] and go over that'd be the end of it no
[1:01:11] moon and stars 14 days and nights her
[1:01:14] pitching back and forth in the storm no
[1:01:17] way to hold it nor nothing but little
[1:01:20] Paul thought perhaps he'd pray through
[1:01:24] all hopes was gone he was a man known as
[1:01:28] I blow travel put this in here he was a
[1:01:31] man no matter how much he was acquainted
[1:01:34] with God all hopes was gone
[1:01:38] Paul did not know what the outcome was
[1:01:41] going to be gone had not told him you're
[1:01:43] gonna go to Rome and you're gonna appear
[1:01:45] before Caesar God had not told him that
[1:01:49] he didn't know the outcome in this
[1:01:52] particular situation he was a man as as
[1:01:56] James would describe subject unto like
[1:01:58] passions such as we are and and we are
[1:02:02] aware and if you're not aware fear
[1:02:05] itself it brings paralysis it can
[1:02:09] absolutely paralyze faith what fear does
[1:02:12] fear itself and let me just say breach
[1:02:15] just for a moment here fear works in a
[1:02:18] manner as the enemy would come it works
[1:02:21] in a manner to close off like you take a
[1:02:23] person that deals with anxiety or if
[1:02:26] you've ever dealt with it into such a
[1:02:28] place it can so take ahold of a person
[1:02:31] to where it literally like just hijacks
[1:02:34] their brain to where they don't even
[1:02:36] know what to do or to try to process and
[1:02:38] you could say don't worry that won't
[1:02:40] help them a bit it won't help them to
[1:02:42] unfold all of them but if it comes to a
[1:02:45] place to where things itself that they
[1:02:47] should be thinking about or doing
[1:02:49] they're not able to do that are you with
[1:02:52] me it paralyzes fear paralyzes faith
[1:02:57] when we were made to be open and to be
[1:03:00] led by the Spirit of God the Bible said
[1:03:03] that the sons of God are led by the
[1:03:05] Spirit of God that is a promise that
[1:03:08] belongs to sons and daughters of God to
[1:03:12] be led by the Spirit of God so Paul was
[1:03:16] given grace to be able to actually as
[1:03:20] Weber the member said he was scared as
[1:03:21] the rest of them it gave him grace to be
[1:03:24] able to pray through in the midst of
[1:03:27] that hour now listen Paul didn't know
[1:03:31] how this journey was gonna fare prior to
[1:03:34] speaking to the Lord direct prior to the
[1:03:36] Lord speaking to him directly
[1:03:37] however after the Lord spoke to him
[1:03:42] he then had a course of faith that was
[1:03:45] set God let him know personally you're
[1:03:48] gonna stand before Caesar
[1:03:50] so Paul knew whatever happens from this
[1:03:53] moment cleared at the time I'm standing
[1:03:56] before Caesar nothing is going to stand
[1:03:59] in my way there's nothing that can
[1:04:01] hinder this Paul knew that was the word
[1:04:04] of the Lord let me remind you every
[1:04:07] vision is sure and the Prophet would be
[1:04:11] clear to let us know in the Hebrew
[1:04:13] series he deals with it a lot but you'll
[1:04:15] hear him mention it throughout the
[1:04:17] message he said there's not a vision
[1:04:20] that heals you the vision only declares
[1:04:23] and make you aware of the presence of
[1:04:26] God and it makes you aware of the
[1:04:29] surance that we have in the Lord he said
[1:04:31] you must have faith in what he said how
[1:04:34] many times brother bana step away and
[1:04:36] say now whatever he said whatever he
[1:04:39] said do you believe it so the vision has
[1:04:44] been spoken the vision we must have
[1:04:47] faith in the vision God has given us a
[1:04:50] vision for this hour we must be certain
[1:04:53] in that vision and you must know
[1:04:55] personally that you are a part of this
[1:04:58] vision that's going to be something that
[1:05:01] you have settled in your heart and the
[1:05:03] vision I'm talking about is the vision
[1:05:05] of the word the vision of Christ I'm
[1:05:08] talking about abiding in him do you know
[1:05:11] that you are a part of him and his life
[1:05:15] is in you and you are in him Paul knew
[1:05:20] now let me just move a little bit Paul
[1:05:22] knew by revelation now let's just let's
[1:05:25] just divide this Paul knew by revelation
[1:05:28] he belonged to the Lord that was not his
[1:05:31] fear he knew where he was going
[1:05:35] should the Lord choose to take him home
[1:05:38] if there the ship would have busted
[1:05:40] apart Paul knew where he was going he
[1:05:43] known whom he had believed he knew he
[1:05:46] knew I was chiefess of sinner Amen but
[1:05:49] what is what his mercy did for me Paul
[1:05:51] that was not his fear
[1:05:53] his fear was not about once he a child
[1:05:56] of God or not did he belong to the Lord
[1:05:59] there was no fear in that but notice in
[1:06:03] every situation and you know what must
[1:06:06] speak across the whole entire assembly
[1:06:09] as well I've been with people before
[1:06:11] their spouse or they have went into
[1:06:13] surgery or different ones and you know
[1:06:16] what there is an uncertainty or a
[1:06:18] settlement
[1:06:19] now sometimes it's before I get there
[1:06:21] sometimes it's before I talk with them
[1:06:24] that is not anything that you're any
[1:06:27] less or any week that shows we are still
[1:06:30] in our humanity and unless God gives us
[1:06:34] direction we do not know are we going to
[1:06:38] come out of this or come out of that or
[1:06:40] come out of this but we know one thing
[1:06:42] that God keeps us through all things
[1:06:47] amen so by the way this was of course
[1:06:50] this course must be our course of faith
[1:06:53] as well we must have a clear course let
[1:06:57] me just say it for every one of you
[1:06:59] you've got to know where that you're in
[1:07:02] the ship and where is your testimony
[1:07:05] taking you you've got to know by the
[1:07:08] testimony of your life I'm telling you
[1:07:11] you know by the life you live you know
[1:07:14] if the love of the things of the world
[1:07:16] is in your life you've got a testimony
[1:07:19] that's taking you not into the presence
[1:07:22] of God not into the joys of the Lord
[1:07:24] it's taking you away and you want to be
[1:07:28] very quickly and very sound to say Lord
[1:07:30] I want to exchange for a real testimony
[1:07:36] we've got to know this is an hour you
[1:07:39] must know that you're in Christ you're
[1:07:42] in the ship and then let me just say
[1:07:47] this to you this is a light thing that's
[1:07:49] going on right now a very light thing
[1:07:52] compared to what's coming in the
[1:07:54] tribulation if I can describe a like
[1:07:57] this this is a to think for what's
[1:07:59] coming and yet there my I've had some
[1:08:01] two things and they might in my be even
[1:08:03] less than a toothache
[1:08:05] I'm not saying that to make a lot of it
[1:08:07] but in the tribulation it'll be things
[1:08:10] one right after another after another
[1:08:12] after another the judgments of God being
[1:08:16] poured out this is why it's be sure that
[1:08:19] you are accounted worthy to escape all
[1:08:22] those things that are going to come and
[1:08:25] our worthiness is by the blood of the
[1:08:28] Lamb
[1:08:31] hallelujah this is why Paul would know
[1:08:34] in situation that Paul would come into
[1:08:38] he would speak even in Philippians of
[1:08:42] how that Christ shall be magnified in my
[1:08:44] body whether it be by life or by death
[1:08:49] oh my so God had given divine revelation
[1:08:54] to Paul Paul would see that indeed he
[1:08:58] was going to stand before Caesar this
[1:09:00] was the course of Paul's faith his hope
[1:09:05] was clear see they didn't have any hope
[1:09:07] all hope was gone
[1:09:09] but now by this direct revelation
[1:09:12] remember all of these three abideth
[1:09:15] faithful Faith Hope charity not Hope
[1:09:18] first remember we were dealing back in
[1:09:20] the first part of March with the helmet
[1:09:22] of salvation hope is not the first hope
[1:09:25] comes after faith faith is the substance
[1:09:28] of things hoped for you have to first
[1:09:32] have the faith and in faith brings
[1:09:34] expectation you see it brings a clearer
[1:09:37] direction
[1:09:38] Paul can let him know hey be of good
[1:09:40] cheer and this is the reason he wasn't
[1:09:44] just telling him hey you guys cheer up
[1:09:46] hey you stop being so sad hey sup
[1:09:48] looking down remember Paul wasn't even
[1:09:50] that way Paul himself the angel of the
[1:09:54] Lord spoke to Paul and said fear not
[1:09:58] these are not words that are just words
[1:10:01] to be minced around God told it to
[1:10:04] Joshua he told it to Gideon he would
[1:10:07] tell it even to Elijah when Elijah was
[1:10:10] there in the cave the fire going out
[1:10:12] consuming man more would come up I would
[1:10:15] go out and God told him fear not to go
[1:10:18] down now before a.m. he would walk down
[1:10:21] and face am not in fear not wondering
[1:10:25] whether his life was going to be you
[1:10:27] know in jeopardy he knew God had spoke
[1:10:30] directly fear not and that's the same
[1:10:33] way the Lord spoke to Paul he addressed
[1:10:36] fear not I'm telling you right now there
[1:10:39] is power in the present revelation of
[1:10:42] this vision that's been unfolded in this
[1:10:45] hour to break the fear the hold of fear
[1:10:49] and to dismantle every little bit within
[1:10:52] a life we're a life itself can
[1:10:55] hopeless but there is power in the word
[1:10:58] to break that hole and give you a clear
[1:11:01] course of faith sometimes people wonder
[1:11:06] about what am I gonna do this if I give
[1:11:08] my life to God what about my wife what
[1:11:10] about this or what about that let God
[1:11:12] take care of that that's only a trap of
[1:11:17] the devil to get y'all worried
[1:11:19] put your faith in Christ it was three
[1:11:29] days they've been tossed about no Sun no
[1:11:33] moon no sign of the Sun kind of sound
[1:11:37] like the resurrection
[1:11:40] kind of sound like the resurrection
[1:11:43] didn't know what was going on right we
[1:11:47] had hoped he had been the Redeemer but
[1:11:49] then he showed up he had an appointment
[1:11:53] with them it's the same way it sounds in
[1:11:55] our lives when all hope is gone yeah and
[1:12:02] I'm not talking about where we're
[1:12:04] worried about this one or a loved one er
[1:12:06] are they you know seal I'm not talking
[1:12:08] about that I'm talking about even when
[1:12:10] we go through situations those things
[1:12:13] yes could worry as if somebody isn't
[1:12:15] ready to go but the things even within a
[1:12:17] situation where we don't have maybe a
[1:12:20] direct word lack but Paul had in the
[1:12:23] sense that you're gonna stand before
[1:12:25] Caesar right just like exactly one
[1:12:28] brother Brandon remember how many times
[1:12:29] when brother down brother dal was
[1:12:31] getting ready to pass away but remember
[1:12:33] the Spirit of God it wasn't because
[1:12:35] brother brother Branham had an affinity
[1:12:37] where brother down no and because
[1:12:38] brother branham he showed us that
[1:12:40] clearly in the message that this gift
[1:12:42] was not based on his control or the
[1:12:45] affinity that he would have with
[1:12:46] individuals
[1:12:47] it was strictly under the governments of
[1:12:49] the Holy Spirit and remember he spoke to
[1:12:52] brother down the Spirit of God moved
[1:12:54] down and said Behold and we held that
[1:12:56] they would meet again and notice how
[1:12:59] that here they were brother Branham
[1:13:01] pulling up brother Dale pulls up outside
[1:13:03] of the tabernacle and as brother Browns
[1:13:05] getting ready to walk in brother now
[1:13:07] brother now now comes out and shakes his
[1:13:09] hand and brother Branham takes that
[1:13:11] example and he says see he says how the
[1:13:14] natural person would think that these
[1:13:16] things are just arranged he said but
[1:13:19] it's not arrange its divinely
[1:13:22] orchestrated by Almighty God he was
[1:13:25] showing you and had the simplicity of
[1:13:27] how sons and daughters operate the word
[1:13:30] goes forth we walk we believe it and
[1:13:33] looked for God to arrange everything in
[1:13:36] order in other words when the
[1:13:38] handkerchief has to be there whoever's
[1:13:40] got to put it there will put it there it
[1:13:43] is
[1:13:44] that arranges all the pieces of the
[1:13:47] vision in his time that thus sayeth the
[1:13:50] Lord might break forth well glory be to
[1:13:54] God the Lord gave him a vision Paul was
[1:13:58] not worried third day Paul took a long
[1:14:05] abstinence what a good example for us
[1:14:09] sometimes we stay too much talking about
[1:14:11] the problem student making an abstinence
[1:14:13] and getting away and seeking God so this
[1:14:17] is where submission to the leadership
[1:14:19] this is where power comes in this is
[1:14:21] where the power of God will move in to
[1:14:23] dismantle fear because fear comes when
[1:14:26] you're out here residing within these
[1:14:28] outer realms and trying to figure it out
[1:14:30] and process it but to come before the
[1:14:32] Lord he can come right there and settle
[1:14:35] you and I in every situation after the
[1:14:38] word of the Lord came forth
[1:14:39] behold be of good cheer there's not that
[1:14:42] there's no harm gonna come to any man's
[1:14:44] life the ship is going to be lost but
[1:14:47] every man's life is going to be
[1:14:49] preserved safely aren't you glad that
[1:14:52] we're in this ship this life of Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ aren't you glad that he gave his
[1:14:58] life for you and I that you and I could
[1:15:00] come safely into the fold he made great
[1:15:04] provision for you and I that in a time
[1:15:07] like this that you and I could have the
[1:15:09] abiding peace and the comfort of the
[1:15:11] Holy Spirit and I'm telling you it's not
[1:15:13] just something right now and this time
[1:15:15] but it's hand of how you're doing it I'm
[1:15:17] living every day like I live every other
[1:15:18] day I'm trusting in the Lord every day
[1:15:21] of my life I trusted him for my
[1:15:24] necessary food I've trusted him for
[1:15:27] every direction he has provided all of
[1:15:30] my needs I'm not just talking about in
[1:15:33] the past few weeks he has provided all
[1:15:35] of my needs throughout the years of my
[1:15:38] life he is faithful to his word Matt
[1:15:45] didn't mean that that ship all of a
[1:15:47] sudden when the word of the Lord went
[1:15:48] forth
[1:15:49] I like how brother Adam will go into it
[1:15:51] and really putting it and we we see it
[1:15:53] in the scripture but brother bran would
[1:15:54] use the words like he said that ship
[1:15:57] just pitching as hard as it ever was he
[1:16:00] was just rocking and reeling but it
[1:16:03] didn't bother Paul faith is positive and
[1:16:12] that's why I've said that this
[1:16:13] positivity of where faith itself makes
[1:16:17] it stand and to see that win you know
[1:16:23] doctors and things like that brother BAM
[1:16:26] could say they could stand there and
[1:16:28] they say you're gonna die in the next
[1:16:30] hour but he said if you knew that she
[1:16:33] was going to get well he said it
[1:16:36] wouldn't matter if you were all covered
[1:16:38] over with cancer or eaten up with
[1:16:39] leprosy that wouldn't scare you one bit
[1:16:45] why because you knew you're going to get
[1:16:47] well right
[1:16:50] now Paul Paul had lost you know he had
[1:16:53] lost all hopes I mean this this must be
[1:16:55] the end
[1:16:57] I mean how many brothers you know
[1:16:58] brother branham even talked about him
[1:17:00] he's on the airplane I mean however how
[1:17:02] many times the airplanes he talked about
[1:17:04] you know diving down and creaking and
[1:17:06] cracking and everything else and my
[1:17:08] goodness you know but the bill you know
[1:17:10] and different things you've been on them
[1:17:11] been in situations like that before you
[1:17:14] don't know if this is the end or not
[1:17:16] right but we're not fearful in that we
[1:17:20] don't know who we are
[1:17:21] now what God gives us direction here you
[1:17:25] see he said me of good courage this when
[1:17:29] we when we look at this this ship was
[1:17:31] going to be wrecked somewhere you've got
[1:17:33] to be cast upon an island now Paul
[1:17:36] remember when he told them he told him
[1:17:38] eat they didn't eat it one till fourteen
[1:17:42] days later think about this from the
[1:17:45] third day to the 14th day right
[1:17:49] it wasn't until eleven days later that
[1:17:52] eventually they began to eat the Bible
[1:17:56] said once that they saw Paul eating
[1:17:59] brother branham said it like this he
[1:18:01] said after that vision broke he said
[1:18:05] Paul started making sandwiches he said
[1:18:08] Paul was walking up and down there and
[1:18:11] he was eatin one sandwich after another
[1:18:13] sandwich telling them be of good cheer
[1:18:17] movement senator madam ins sharks and
[1:18:20] everything else following the boat he
[1:18:22] said but Paul was walking in the midst
[1:18:24] of it he had a sure word of prophecy he
[1:18:28] could eat in the midst of that time we
[1:18:32] have received the show word of prophecy
[1:18:35] and man we have received of the Lord and
[1:18:39] for you and I it is not hindering our
[1:18:42] appetite but all the word of the Lord is
[1:18:45] so precious we are privileged to have
[1:18:48] this secret place in Christ to have this
[1:18:51] secret food that God has stored up for
[1:18:55] us and God Himself breaking to our
[1:18:58] hearts for this hour that we're living
[1:19:00] in well he is our encouragement Oh glory
[1:19:05] be to God now to think of this
[1:19:12] think of this here in the scripture
[1:19:19] huh
[1:19:22] we have promises of healing in the word
[1:19:25] as in Sim and without me taking the time
[1:19:29] as an assembly we have been laboring and
[1:19:33] preaching in these promises from back in
[1:19:36] the back in the December time going
[1:19:39] promise after promise where God would
[1:19:42] tell us in the book of Proverbs chapter
[1:19:46] four it spoke of how that not only would
[1:19:50] his word be health to our soul but it's
[1:19:55] health to our body he told us to take
[1:19:58] that word in he told us and that and the
[1:20:02] Lord that he loved me he let us know yes
[1:20:06] sickness will come but I'm the Lord that
[1:20:08] heals you he told us in Exodus 23 I will
[1:20:12] bless your bread and your water thank
[1:20:15] God for that consume and there's a lot
[1:20:17] of junk in our bread and water but he
[1:20:21] said I'll bless your bread and water if
[1:20:23] we look to him and said Lord all things
[1:20:26] on a busy brief Thanksgiving in prayer
[1:20:27] amen I will bless your bread and water
[1:20:31] and I will take sickness from among you
[1:20:35] amen and Deuteronomy 7 he reiterates
[1:20:38] Exodus 15 we find description as a of 53
[1:20:42] by His stripes we were healed
[1:20:45] is that right in the very center of the
[1:20:48] Bible Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my
[1:20:50] soul and all that's within me forget not
[1:20:53] his benefits who forgiveth thee of all
[1:20:56] thine iniquities who healeth e of all
[1:20:59] thy diseases we have the promise and
[1:21:02] songs and Mandy one but when the
[1:21:05] pestilence or whatever would come don't
[1:21:07] be afraid Amen we have the promise as it
[1:21:10] proceeds on down that Nina not show any
[1:21:14] plague come nigh thy dwelling oh where
[1:21:17] is it be safe in Jesus Christ we have a
[1:21:22] promise and if we are in Christ in crash
[1:21:25] every promise is yay and amen and this
[1:21:29] is why but the word that God has sent to
[1:21:33] you and I in
[1:21:34] this our remember what Paul said it
[1:21:36] shall be even as it was told unto me God
[1:21:41] has come in this hour and confirmed his
[1:21:44] word
[1:21:46] his presence that indeed he's the same
[1:21:48] yesterday today and forever on the
[1:21:51] constant war and the unchangeable God
[1:21:54] every promise I made it is sure all
[1:21:59] these are the sure mercies of David and
[1:22:02] this is why the Prophet could stand
[1:22:05] there in the message perfect faith and
[1:22:07] he'll talk about the vision of the
[1:22:09] little boy in Finland and how the vision
[1:22:12] was announced years before it ever took
[1:22:15] place
[1:22:16] are you with me now when brother Branham
[1:22:19] was standing there and he came upon that
[1:22:21] little boy remember how brother Bram
[1:22:23] tells it he doesn't know that it's that
[1:22:26] vision he walks around and he says to
[1:22:31] brother Jack morning he says it's the
[1:22:33] place kind of seems familiar
[1:22:36] he's looking at the background or the
[1:22:38] setting of it still doesn't know but it
[1:22:43] isn't until after they pull back the
[1:22:46] blanket dozin asked him to read on the
[1:22:49] Flyleaf that brother Branham makes this
[1:22:52] statement he said there wasn't a demon
[1:22:55] out of hell that could have stopped that
[1:22:57] little going from raising up let me tell
[1:23:01] you there's not a demon out of hell
[1:23:04] that can stop or hinder the word of the
[1:23:07] Lord sayeth the Lord is sure I am sure
[1:23:11] it shall be even as it was told me this
[1:23:17] is why and that's in that message
[1:23:19] brother Ram said the vision that has
[1:23:22] come forth
[1:23:23] he said death couldn't hold that little
[1:23:25] boy he said that was God speaking
[1:23:28] through a vision and he picks up the
[1:23:30] Bible he says this is more than the
[1:23:32] vision he says if this word if this word
[1:23:36] has told you something then you can have
[1:23:39] the same confidence then what's going to
[1:23:43] happen
[1:23:43] you understand God you
[1:23:46] and move through that of a profit there
[1:23:48] was a message that was to be delivered
[1:23:51] in this hour to restore the same faith
[1:23:54] to the Saints of the Living God to
[1:23:56] restore that same Bible faith not for
[1:23:59] people to believe in the Bible people
[1:24:01] already did believe in the Bible a good
[1:24:03] Baptist will believe in the Bible they
[1:24:05] can now quote many of you but that's not
[1:24:07] what it is it's to have the same Bible
[1:24:10] faith because it is the same life of God
[1:24:13] that would be operating in the Church of
[1:24:16] the Living God
[1:24:17] and that's where brother Branham would
[1:24:19] take us in this part with Paul he said
[1:24:21] Paul was so charged full of the Holy
[1:24:25] Ghost and he said oh God may he have a
[1:24:28] church in the end time
[1:24:30] that's so charged with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:33] what brings the charge of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:36] oh brother
[1:24:37] it ain't a key of G on the music it
[1:24:39] ain't that at all
[1:24:41] what brings the charge of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] in the church is the real baptism of the
[1:24:46] Holy Ghost that is poured out through
[1:24:49] the revelation of a word it brings a
[1:24:52] charge in that life where that life can
[1:24:54] never be the same again it is
[1:24:57] transformed by the power of Almighty God
[1:25:00] this is what it does to you so then
[1:25:07] we've got promises we'll go to Santa
[1:25:13] when I'm praying for my wife or I'm
[1:25:15] praying for my husband I just need a
[1:25:18] direct word from the Lord you've got it
[1:25:20] right here
[1:25:21] has this been made alive to you now we
[1:25:25] don't maybe you don't have direction or
[1:25:27] direct such as within so many days
[1:25:30] they're going to raise up but you can't
[1:25:32] make that happen anyhow but the thing
[1:25:34] that we can do and show such great
[1:25:36] respect and admiration to the Lord is to
[1:25:39] take him at his word that's the greatest
[1:25:42] compliment that we can take a promise of
[1:25:44] God and stand there and say Lord I don't
[1:25:47] need a special vision to let me know
[1:25:49] that this is for me I'm one of your
[1:25:51] children I'm born of the very life I am
[1:25:54] from your loins I
[1:25:56] the royal seat of Abraham there is a
[1:25:58] covenant that you have made with me
[1:26:01] there are promises that you've given me
[1:26:03] now this situation is before us and I go
[1:26:07] in the name of the Lord to meet this
[1:26:10] uncircumcised devil oh yes when we pray
[1:26:18] for the sick we're not we're not coming
[1:26:20] out with just hope no we're praying with
[1:26:25] faith they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:26:28] and they shall recover the pair of faith
[1:26:31] shall save the sick and God shall raise
[1:26:33] them up we can have confidence that's
[1:26:38] what the real working of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:41] does it brings confidence back in the
[1:26:43] word now faith
[1:26:51] and they just bring this down that don't
[1:26:56] mean I'm stopping faith doesn't make us
[1:27:03] act irresponsible God told Israel I've
[1:27:08] given you the land but there was a
[1:27:12] pathway in an order you see faith has to
[1:27:15] find the course even when God had told
[1:27:18] Joshua there shall not any man be able
[1:27:22] to stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:27:24] life this is why when Joshua was out
[1:27:28] seeking for the will of the Lord
[1:27:29] concerning Joshua Jericho
[1:27:31] it was not the mid you say to you like
[1:27:34] this it was not a question whether
[1:27:36] Jericho was going to be overthrown
[1:27:39] that's not what he was praying about
[1:27:41] Lord are you gonna but it was not the
[1:27:44] prayer he was going to seek the will of
[1:27:47] God in that situation this is the
[1:27:51] leadership of Joshua the Holy Spirit
[1:27:54] moving through the adopted sons and
[1:27:57] daughters of God what the maturity is is
[1:28:00] not us running errantly on our own
[1:28:03] leadings no the charity is where we
[1:28:06] recognize I can do nothing without him
[1:28:09] I do nothing but what I see the father
[1:28:11] doing first then that doeth the son
[1:28:14] likewise so he told Joshua with this and
[1:28:17] I said as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:28:20] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[1:28:21] forsake thee so Joshua's faith was
[1:28:25] settled in the Lord and he sucked look
[1:28:29] what this happened he sought the counsel
[1:28:31] of the word through Eliezer in every
[1:28:34] situation if you recall in in in in in
[1:28:37] the scripture I think it's in numbers 27
[1:28:39] and where God gives a direction in
[1:28:42] numbers 27 is numbers odd numbers 27
[1:28:45] where he gives the direction of there
[1:28:47] shall be a man that shall go out before
[1:28:49] Israel he's telling Moses put some of
[1:28:51] your honor upon him that the children of
[1:28:54] Israel might have that of you know the
[1:28:55] confidence and he and he shall not go
[1:28:58] forth without conferring with that of
[1:29:00] the Urim to Mum and that of Eleazar the
[1:29:02] priest see within this
[1:29:04] of the leadership of the spiritual
[1:29:06] joshula just not operate and say I've
[1:29:08] got the message of Moses I can just do
[1:29:10] what I want no but the spiritual Joshua
[1:29:13] recognizes authority and leadership you
[1:29:17] see the Roman centurion the reason the
[1:29:19] word could have an effect is because he
[1:29:22] can recognize when he was standing in
[1:29:25] the presence of one who had a greater
[1:29:27] authority for a present situation it was
[1:29:31] not that Jesus was a great learned
[1:29:33] military man this guy was a great learn
[1:29:36] military man but he said I'm a man under
[1:29:39] Authority I know what it means to say go
[1:29:42] and they go come and they come and what
[1:29:45] was he doing he was recognizing there is
[1:29:48] aware that is present that can address
[1:29:51] the certain situations and that's
[1:29:54] exactly what the spiritual Joshua does
[1:29:56] that has been brought into the land of
[1:29:59] promise by one spirit we are baptized
[1:30:02] into this body
[1:30:04] it recognizes we must be under the
[1:30:07] leadership of the Holy Spirit not our
[1:30:10] feelings not our leadings but under his
[1:30:13] leading that's victory this is why
[1:30:18] brother Brown would say that a man
[1:30:20] that's been able to conquer himself out
[1:30:21] of humble thyself a man that's been able
[1:30:23] to conquer himself has more power than
[1:30:26] the man that would run and scream all
[1:30:28] over the building
[1:30:28] but the RAM was not in dealing away you
[1:30:31] know what worship what he's talking
[1:30:32] about is the greatness of humility is
[1:30:34] being able to conquer ourselves Oh glory
[1:30:40] do you realize Jesus oh my I'm a priest
[1:30:44] can I preach this for a few moments well
[1:30:46] there's not enough of you here to stop
[1:30:47] me and you better not turn me off either
[1:30:51] but Jesus notice how the Lord Jesus in
[1:30:55] humility the Bible says he humbled
[1:30:57] himself unto death and became obedient
[1:30:59] even until the death of the cross notice
[1:31:01] became obedient unto the death of the
[1:31:03] cross he prayed brother Ram would tell
[1:31:05] us in souls in prison now Jesus prayed
[1:31:07] to dodge the cross is that right he knew
[1:31:10] as he said in John 12 now is my heart
[1:31:12] traveled
[1:31:14] right here he felt the encroachment of
[1:31:16] fear coming around because of the death
[1:31:18] not because of who he was but because of
[1:31:21] what he knew awaited but remember here
[1:31:24] he was willing to drink his cup do you
[1:31:27] realize what that means Jesus did not go
[1:31:30] - did not go to Calvary because he was
[1:31:32] sick of living are you with me he did
[1:31:36] not lose his will to live that's not
[1:31:39] what he went to Calvary he loved the
[1:31:42] sunsets brother Ram told us he loved the
[1:31:43] sunsets
[1:31:44] he loved his brother and he loved that
[1:31:46] fellowship that communion he had with
[1:31:49] him but he knew in order to bring about
[1:31:51] the perfect oneness and real true
[1:31:54] communion there had to be an all
[1:31:56] sufficient sacrifice that the life
[1:31:58] inside of that blood might come in them
[1:32:01] and bring them in him that they might be
[1:32:04] one even as high and my father are one
[1:32:07] so that they would be he did not go
[1:32:11] because he was I'm tired of living I'll
[1:32:15] tell you this world that would have been
[1:32:16] a selfish reason he did not take his
[1:32:19] life because he was tired you know what
[1:32:21] what's the use of living no that's not
[1:32:23] what Calvary was or girl would be to God
[1:32:27] you know and it goes to show you and I
[1:32:29] let me preach a little bit if the enemy
[1:32:31] is trying to snatch away from you the
[1:32:33] joy of living you've got a right as a
[1:32:35] son and daughter of God because our
[1:32:37] husband the Lord Jesus Christ he never
[1:32:40] went to Calvary and defeated the devil
[1:32:43] because he was tired of living he went
[1:32:46] to Calvary he endured for the joy that
[1:32:49] was set before him made God by the
[1:32:51] Spirit of God come into your heart and
[1:32:54] renew the joy there's a reason to live
[1:32:57] the reason is more than your job it's
[1:33:00] more than your family although they need
[1:33:02] you but there is more than that there is
[1:33:05] that to serve the Lord and to be
[1:33:08] available to God and a let the joys of
[1:33:11] the Lord enter into your life
[1:33:15] so Satan is telling you there's no use I
[1:33:18] say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:21] get behind me Satan you rebuke him he
[1:33:27] came that we might have life and have it
[1:33:29] more abundantly
[1:33:38] when they came to the note you know even
[1:33:40] in the land that had to be under that
[1:33:42] leadership
[1:33:47] pride is what calls some of the men who
[1:33:50] went and spied out AI the next city so
[1:33:53] we don't need to take everybody there
[1:33:55] don't don't don't throw them don't
[1:33:57] trouble everybody it wasn't because
[1:33:58] everybody that they won matter of fact
[1:34:00] there wasn't everybody that did Jericho
[1:34:01] it was God but God wanted everybody in
[1:34:04] the same March God wanted everybody in
[1:34:08] time the God had wanted everybody get
[1:34:10] back in step God wanted everybody in
[1:34:12] step but what caused that to where men
[1:34:15] see see how sin would pervade there in
[1:34:18] the body what did it do it caused him a
[1:34:21] sin of pride would cause them to say we
[1:34:23] don't need to we don't need that much
[1:34:26] see what they were looking at they were
[1:34:28] going back on and they were leaning back
[1:34:30] on a word instead of making sure that
[1:34:33] their heart was in line with a God who
[1:34:34] gave the word then when their heart is
[1:34:36] in line their spirits in line their
[1:34:38] minds in line their attitudes in life
[1:34:40] when everything's in line with the God
[1:34:42] who gave the word then the word will
[1:34:43] come to pass now the Bible says here in
[1:34:46] acts 28 1 and when they were escaped
[1:34:50] then they knew that the island was
[1:34:52] called Malita and the barbarous people
[1:34:55] showed us no little kindness for they
[1:34:57] kindled a fire and received us everyone
[1:35:00] because of the present reign and because
[1:35:02] of the cold and when Paul had gathered a
[1:35:05] bundle of sticks and laid them on the
[1:35:06] fire there came a viper out of the heat
[1:35:09] and fastened on his hand when the
[1:35:13] barbarians saw the venomous beast hang
[1:35:16] on his hand isn't it incredible this
[1:35:19] beast could have bit Paul and nobody
[1:35:22] else would have saw it but God let it be
[1:35:25] declared in the presence of them all
[1:35:28] this venomous Viper was hanging on his
[1:35:32] hand when he had raised it up they said
[1:35:36] among themselves no doubt this man's a
[1:35:39] murderer whom though he have to escape
[1:35:41] the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to
[1:35:45] live and he shipped off the Beast into
[1:35:47] the fire and felt no harm
[1:35:52] howbeit they looked when he should have
[1:35:56] noticed the natural inclination of hope
[1:35:59] who against hope who the hope was when
[1:36:03] he should have swollen or fallen down
[1:36:06] dead suddenly
[1:36:09] I wonder if they were just all sitting
[1:36:12] around like this y'all got room in your
[1:36:18] your place to bury see this is what the
[1:36:22] natural course would have been these
[1:36:26] individuals and Milito are the multis
[1:36:28] people they understood this when this
[1:36:31] type of a bite took place by this Viper
[1:36:34] that this is what's going to happen the
[1:36:36] band's gonna swell up you know a
[1:36:37] fixation things through the nervous
[1:36:39] system and they're gonna fall dead this
[1:36:42] was the expectation but little did they
[1:36:45] know that this was not his end there was
[1:36:49] a greater power that was working in
[1:36:52] Paul's body than the power of just his
[1:36:55] natural immune system there was a
[1:36:58] greater power Paul had been shot up with
[1:37:02] the vaccination of the holy ghost
[1:37:04] brother he was immune to anything there
[1:37:08] is nothing that could touch his life
[1:37:10] until the purpose of God had been
[1:37:13] fulfilled he knew that there is nothing
[1:37:16] present nor anything to come should have
[1:37:23] fallen dead suddenly but after they
[1:37:24] looked a great while and so no harm come
[1:37:27] to him they changed their mind and said
[1:37:30] this was a God notice lowercase G little
[1:37:35] did they know indeed he was he was a son
[1:37:38] of God redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[1:37:40] and Alou you think of this now here the
[1:37:44] scripture now let's look here Paul
[1:37:46] himself this was not spelled out in
[1:37:50] every part of the vision are you with me
[1:37:53] now
[1:37:53] he was spelled out you're going to stand
[1:37:56] before Caesar what that let him know is
[1:37:58] they're going to be shipwrecked and
[1:38:01] you're going to stand before Caesar but
[1:38:04] he did not know of all of the things
[1:38:07] that would come in between but you know
[1:38:10] what he didn't worry about it because he
[1:38:13] was walking in the one who was Alpha and
[1:38:15] Omega he's walking in the a man which is
[1:38:19] the Soviet of God so here Paul would
[1:38:22] have a
[1:38:23] confidence within the word think of it
[1:38:25] the pulsation of the word within his
[1:38:27] life remember the Great Commission was
[1:38:29] given to that of the apostles they were
[1:38:32] they were there holding that revelation
[1:38:34] by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in
[1:38:37] their life and they themselves there
[1:38:38] would be a dispersing or a taking of the
[1:38:42] gospel we understand that there had to
[1:38:44] be some persecution that would arise in
[1:38:46] Jerusalem to actually cause it to
[1:38:48] further disperse and bring that that
[1:38:50] gospel into other people's lands and
[1:38:52] among other people and yet we also know
[1:38:55] that that happened the Apostles and how
[1:38:57] that they would go packing that a gospel
[1:38:59] it was to bring the good news but yet it
[1:39:02] did not mean that within what they were
[1:39:04] carrying though it was the good news
[1:39:06] though it was a present reality though
[1:39:08] indeed they were men of God who had been
[1:39:11] born of the Spirit of Almighty God yet
[1:39:14] there would they still were walking in a
[1:39:17] body that was still waiting to be
[1:39:19] redeemed there would be times and
[1:39:21] situations that they would come up on as
[1:39:24] Paul would recall in many times he would
[1:39:26] call it perils P er ILS many perils at
[1:39:30] times where your hunger and thirsty and
[1:39:32] your you know beaten and shipwrecked
[1:39:34] three times and on and on that Paul
[1:39:36] would speak about now notice this is
[1:39:38] what Jesus said in mark 16 17 and these
[1:39:42] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:39:46] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[1:39:50] shall speak with new tongues sad thing
[1:39:54] about it is I think we only think about
[1:39:57] this terms of Scripture if there's only
[1:39:59] a case that arises of this sickness but
[1:40:01] you realize when you pray over your food
[1:40:02] you're casting out Devils I'm not just
[1:40:07] talking about from the grocery store but
[1:40:08] from a lot of these individuals no
[1:40:10] Doubt's have been serving and cooking
[1:40:11] our food for a long time come on
[1:40:13] somebody
[1:40:14] I mean a lot of these things when things
[1:40:16] that I've been studying here for over
[1:40:18] the past week and weeks and so forth you
[1:40:20] find that a lot of things even in Europe
[1:40:21] there was a lot of things because of the
[1:40:23] uncleanness among the people
[1:40:26] now notice this in my name shall they
[1:40:29] cast out Devils they shall speak with
[1:40:31] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:40:36] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[1:40:39] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[1:40:44] on the sick and they shall recover
[1:40:47] oh my in Psalms 91 13 now she'll tread
[1:40:51] upon the lion and the adder the young
[1:40:54] lion and the dragon shall trample
[1:40:56] underfoot I always think a brother
[1:41:03] Daniel you know when he would give this
[1:41:06] example in the camp meetings
[1:41:09] he would say some were called some are
[1:41:15] sent and some just packed up their bags
[1:41:18] and wind what this is speaking of
[1:41:23] is to know God has purposed when he let
[1:41:28] him know you're gonna walk through some
[1:41:30] places but I want you to know I'm with
[1:41:32] you you might get snake-bitten but
[1:41:37] you've got an anti-venom
[1:41:40] you got an anti-venom you are right in
[1:41:43] the center of my will he didn't tell us
[1:41:47] that every circumstance surrounding
[1:41:49] would be perfect nor was he advising
[1:41:54] them to act carelessly are you with me
[1:41:57] this is why brother Branham when he's
[1:41:59] asked the question you know there's a
[1:42:01] person that asked brother Branham a
[1:42:03] question about the snake handlers oh man
[1:42:07] my dad preached at one of those Church
[1:42:10] one time he said he couldn't figure out
[1:42:12] why in the world when he preached on
[1:42:13] mark 16 he said they like the tour the
[1:42:15] house down he said I knew I seen some
[1:42:17] boxes sitting up here he said I don't
[1:42:18] know what the box is worried you know
[1:42:19] thought they were offering tithing boxes
[1:42:21] or whatever more kind of glad they
[1:42:24] didn't open them things but notice
[1:42:29] the rambling sound like this he said now
[1:42:31] if we try to tempt the Lord into
[1:42:34] something we're in for it he said I
[1:42:37] don't think the Lord means for us to get
[1:42:39] a bottle of arsenic and see if we could
[1:42:41] drink it to prove that we got faith he
[1:42:45] said no more than you bring me a snake
[1:42:47] and I pick it up that it would show you
[1:42:49] that I have faith he said to what I do
[1:42:52] believe is if I am baptizing people or
[1:42:56] doing the work of the Lord or out in the
[1:43:00] jungle and the snake bit me I'd walk
[1:43:04] right on in the name of the Lord I
[1:43:07] believe that's what it meant
[1:43:13] see brother Adam you know he would go on
[1:43:16] and he would tell us he said now you
[1:43:18] know I don't believe in tempting God or
[1:43:21] push trying to push God into anything
[1:43:31] but Paul when he got bit he just shook
[1:43:34] it off
[1:43:36] I mean you know it's just as simple as
[1:43:38] this right here I know that God is my
[1:43:40] healer but I still got health insurance
[1:43:46] yeah I don't know how many individuals
[1:43:48] you know at times has told me brother
[1:43:49] Sammy can you tell me about that plan
[1:43:51] you got because truly if something
[1:43:52] happens to me it'll really sink me the
[1:43:55] reality is is because the cost of it
[1:43:58] all it takes is one situation we're not
[1:44:00] promised of they'll never be any
[1:44:02] situation we're not promised that we
[1:44:06] can't put things together and say this
[1:44:07] is no you can't do that God and Trust
[1:44:11] these things to us
[1:44:15] it's just like you know I've heard where
[1:44:17] people who individuals will would leave
[1:44:20] their doors open and I would often I
[1:44:22] looked at Maleficent well I said I you
[1:44:25] know I think we live in an ok and said
[1:44:27] community I said but ain't no way in the
[1:44:29] world I'll leave my door open
[1:44:32] no way Wow luck it we don't you don't
[1:44:35] you trust God
[1:44:36] I do trust God but God trusts me with
[1:44:39] what he's entrusted to me come on
[1:44:43] somebody it's just like I trust God that
[1:44:46] God's gonna keep my automobile my
[1:44:48] outermost bill is gonna last they don't
[1:44:49] mean that I don't take it for regular
[1:44:51] maintenance of oil change and tire
[1:44:52] rotation and do the other stuff come on
[1:44:55] now that God ain't gonna do that for me
[1:44:58] God ain't going to come down and say
[1:45:00] same they don't worry I got your house
[1:45:01] buddy I'll lock it for you know God has
[1:45:04] entrusted that to me there is a
[1:45:06] responsibility that's given to me it's
[1:45:10] just like in the washing of my hands oh
[1:45:13] brother Samuel there you go getting
[1:45:15] carnal now I'm not getting carnal I'm
[1:45:18] just being real this is laid out in the
[1:45:22] scripture for us clear back in the Book
[1:45:24] of Leviticus faith does not act in a
[1:45:30] manner of irresponsible
[1:45:37] he just shook it off he shook off the
[1:45:40] snake he wasn't all excited now this is
[1:45:42] where I want to draw you down to he
[1:45:44] wasn't all excited in its head oh lord
[1:45:46] help me help me help me to do it Lord he
[1:45:49] wasn't
[1:45:52] but neither did he say bring me that
[1:45:55] snake he never tempted God this is what
[1:46:01] I love but he had faith in God to
[1:46:04] overcome the snake bite just say it like
[1:46:09] this you know very well like brother
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:15] Giovanna Prakash they sent me pictures
[1:46:18] even you know yet where they're working
[1:46:21] in the leper colony he'd been doing that
[1:46:23] for years on end nobody could walk in
[1:46:27] there and say be close brother Prakash
[1:46:29] goes in the leper colony I'll go in the
[1:46:31] leper colony you better know God's
[1:46:32] tending you in there if God sends you
[1:46:35] there he'll keep you are you with me you
[1:46:40] better know what you're doing you cannot
[1:46:42] go out that's why the scripture said
[1:46:44] thou shall not tempt the Lord amen
[1:46:48] because when God leads you somewhere it
[1:46:51] isn't that there ain't gonna be pearls
[1:46:53] and things come your way just like
[1:46:55] sometimes when you've been overseas and
[1:46:57] sickness would come our way but God said
[1:47:00] I'll give you faith to overcome it you
[1:47:07] know brother Branham was quick to say it
[1:47:09] he said I'm not saying those people
[1:47:10] don't got faith he said they can drink a
[1:47:12] saline and arsenic he said they drink it
[1:47:14] and they go right on he said they got
[1:47:17] faith but he said don't prove nothing
[1:47:21] and don't prove nothing bill Simon what
[1:47:24] are you saying
[1:47:24] where I just say it like this if I know
[1:47:26] there was a whole place where a bunch of
[1:47:28] people had the coronavirus guess what
[1:47:30] I wouldn't go well brother Sam you don't
[1:47:33] have faith no I have wisdom
[1:47:35] remember what Martin Luther Omaha had
[1:47:38] one plan on sharing this today but
[1:47:40] Martin Luther said in the time when the
[1:47:42] plague hit the area in Europe he said I
[1:47:45] shall fumigate the place I shall take
[1:47:48] all necessary medicine
[1:47:50] I shall avoid others and I myself will
[1:47:53] be sure not to go where others are that
[1:47:56] I might infect them or they might infect
[1:47:59] me and Martin Luther said this is a
[1:48:01] god-fearing faith for it does not act
[1:48:05] recklessly so don't prove anything
[1:48:12] Oh huh so brother Samuel what would you
[1:48:17] do if somebody sees so help me Jesus
[1:48:19] find the next hour of the story it's not
[1:48:21] out of fear because these bodies these
[1:48:25] bodies are still under the curse of sin
[1:48:32] but brother Ram said you just be real
[1:48:34] sweet humble Christian and live the life
[1:48:36] and then God will take care of the rest
[1:48:38] of it this is why brother Branham would
[1:48:40] make this statement and I've got got to
[1:48:42] labor on a couple of these points this
[1:48:44] is why he would make the statement in
[1:48:46] the message to token and he deals with
[1:48:48] this thought of how he says we and knew
[1:48:51] us and the word had become one husband
[1:48:54] and wife have been united together he
[1:48:57] said then when the word we and the word
[1:48:59] become one he said then every promise
[1:49:01] belongs to us
[1:49:03] it obeys you when they win you say to
[1:49:05] the hand hand go it'll be you he said
[1:49:08] but then you want to watch what you do
[1:49:12] you would want to put your hand in a
[1:49:15] fire just to say see me do it
[1:49:18] oh no but if there is something in that
[1:49:23] fire I got to reach for it it'll obey me
[1:49:28] see not reaching in the fire because I'm
[1:49:31] going to prove and I have got faith in
[1:49:33] this time no no that's not faith faith
[1:49:36] will always act in humility and
[1:49:38] accordance with the Word of God but
[1:49:41] faith remember what they think there's
[1:49:42] not something that's just loose and
[1:49:44] haphazard faith finds the perfect will
[1:49:47] of God and moves in it if there is
[1:49:51] something in that fire I got a reach for
[1:49:53] it it'll obey me
[1:49:55] you see you want to watch what you're
[1:49:59] doing may God help us may God help us
[1:50:06] I'll tell you if there's one thing about
[1:50:07] it I think you know that I know there's
[1:50:08] many in the Assembly they're already
[1:50:10] very cautious and I and I appreciate all
[1:50:12] that and one thing about it it's just
[1:50:14] even taught me to be a little bit more
[1:50:15] cautious on things we can be a little
[1:50:19] bit more cautious on things and take
[1:50:21] certain precautions and take take things
[1:50:23] some things a little bit more seriously
[1:50:26] and I'll talking about worry I'm not
[1:50:28] talking about fear I'm talking about
[1:50:31] where faith is operating in the right
[1:50:34] direction
[1:50:36] now this is where the scripture and I
[1:50:38] really am I'm trying to bring this down
[1:50:39] here this is where the Scriptures deal
[1:50:43] we're here in in first John 4:17 here in
[1:50:46] is our love made perfect that we may
[1:50:49] have boldness in the Day of Judgment
[1:50:52] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:50:57] just as he is seated in power and
[1:51:00] authority he by the Holy Spirit the word
[1:51:04] is seated in power and authority over
[1:51:08] sin in our lives we are a reflection on
[1:51:13] earth what he is in the heavens is that
[1:51:16] right the moon is the reflection of all
[1:51:19] the Sun is in its absence so we have a
[1:51:23] boldness in judgment we already know we
[1:51:26] have passed from death unto life and I
[1:51:28] say for everybody that's what you have
[1:51:31] to know that is indeed when your love is
[1:51:35] made complete there is no fear in love
[1:51:41] but perfect love cast out fear because
[1:51:45] fear hath torment he that feareth is not
[1:51:49] made perfect in love notice notice the
[1:51:52] dividing of fear paul had no fear in
[1:51:56] terms of security in his salvation but
[1:52:00] to know what is going to be the outcome
[1:52:01] in this situation he did not know that
[1:52:04] but he looked to the lord who gave
[1:52:07] direction in a presence that you're a
[1:52:09] situation that was not conducive for a
[1:52:14] time of prayer if we would look at it in
[1:52:16] a natural funneled out here was I mean
[1:52:18] the boats rocking and not only take the
[1:52:22] boats Rocking
[1:52:22] Paul's happen to battle beyond all of
[1:52:24] his mind is that right but you see
[1:52:28] there's an atmosphere but Paul was able
[1:52:31] vibe from that charge of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:34] in his life was able by the grace of God
[1:52:37] to move in that situation now you see
[1:52:40] where here we are now look we've got to
[1:52:43] go out and I'm going to say this to you
[1:52:44] the reason I believe the Lord would lay
[1:52:47] this so heavily upon my heart because
[1:52:48] whatever day that they would hit the
[1:52:51] resume button and then they would say
[1:52:53] that it would be
[1:52:56] you know good or it would be fine for us
[1:53:00] to be able to congregate together again
[1:53:02] I believe these things apply just as
[1:53:05] much as I believe that there's things
[1:53:07] that we can do a little bit better on as
[1:53:10] people and become a little bit more
[1:53:12] alert on I think if there's one thing
[1:53:14] about it if somebody hasn't been a
[1:53:16] faithful hand washer before I hope to
[1:53:18] goodness that you're a faithful hand
[1:53:19] washer now because you can be a carrier
[1:53:22] I mean let me just tell you right quick
[1:53:25] there's not been the first time that you
[1:53:27] might say well brothers saying how could
[1:53:29] that be at a church dinner hey brothers
[1:53:31] and sisters I know of a church dinner it
[1:53:32] was a big old meeting and people had the
[1:53:34] church dinner and everybody there got
[1:53:36] sick
[1:53:38] message Church or a church that was
[1:53:41] under it
[1:53:42] you see it didn't anyone just being it
[1:53:45] was something within the food however
[1:53:47] the food was cooked for one or more
[1:53:48] brother Sammy does that make you
[1:53:49] concerned do you worry that no I don't
[1:53:51] worry I've known that for years
[1:53:53] but I do believe that within wares of
[1:53:56] many things were ignorant of and I thank
[1:53:58] God for it but I do believe that we have
[1:54:01] to apply ourselves take necessary
[1:54:04] precautions
[1:54:09] I believe it's very very important we
[1:54:13] see yesterday where our governor
[1:54:14] actually he didn't he said I can't
[1:54:16] enforce it but he has put it in place he
[1:54:18] recommended right now
[1:54:19] he said if you ain't doing streaming for
[1:54:21] your churches you need to be doing it or
[1:54:23] whatever he said don't be coming
[1:54:24] together because they just do as a
[1:54:27] church that just got quite a bit of it
[1:54:29] but here's what here's what it is
[1:54:36] and for somebody to take to think well
[1:54:38] we're in the message that now did that
[1:54:41] that I mean the cancer comes and other
[1:54:45] things come and so forth and on and on
[1:54:47] and on and on and on
[1:54:49] the reason that notice the reason that
[1:54:53] things would bring a scare the reason
[1:54:57] that it hurts like Bill Graham talks
[1:54:59] about he said when you're frying your
[1:55:00] egg of a morning and he said the grease
[1:55:03] pops out of the skillet he said the
[1:55:05] first thing you do is reach for that
[1:55:07] bottle to settle it he said but remember
[1:55:10] it's not the grease that burns you it's
[1:55:14] the fear so God doesn't want us to walk
[1:55:18] in fear notice that Viper latched on to
[1:55:20] Paul's hand when Paul here he was he
[1:55:23] didn't even know it he cuz he felt no
[1:55:25] harm he left off he felt no harm there
[1:55:28] was that of the word that was present to
[1:55:31] combat that situation there was a
[1:55:33] perfect love that was present that could
[1:55:36] overthrow that fear that's why brother
[1:55:38] Ram could say when that grease pops on
[1:55:40] you
[1:55:41] he said you're full of the Holy Ghost he
[1:55:43] said but if you left he said fear that's
[1:55:46] when Satan steps in
[1:55:50] this is where perfect love cast him out
[1:55:54] oh this is an hour of casting him out
[1:55:59] this is an hour where he's to be he's to
[1:56:03] be cast out for God hath not given us a
[1:56:05] spirit of fear but a power of love and
[1:56:08] of a sound mind so we thank God for His
[1:56:13] mercy he delivers us from the confusion
[1:56:16] of not knowing who we are but to know
[1:56:21] who we are you see with knowing who we
[1:56:24] are and this is where brother brand
[1:56:26] deals with in that part of the quote
[1:56:28] knowing who we are it brings an
[1:56:31] atmosphere and the situate creates by
[1:56:35] the brem says you're the one who creates
[1:56:36] the situation then it's an atmosphere
[1:56:39] that's created
[1:56:41] now much that we could say about that
[1:56:46] with our minds about what we're giving
[1:56:49] ourselves to but I think it would be
[1:56:51] fitting in this time and I rather than
[1:56:53] put this off till Thursday I thought it
[1:56:56] would begin just press of the Lord to go
[1:56:58] ahead with us today and that's why I was
[1:57:01] bringing it God knows our needs he knows
[1:57:05] that no doubt that there's there has
[1:57:07] been those that's come in contact with
[1:57:09] people that's had this virus and to know
[1:57:14] that sometimes that can be where the
[1:57:16] enemy can try to play upon that upon
[1:57:19] people's minds and we understand that
[1:57:22] and we realize that has nothing to do
[1:57:24] with who we are as a son and daughter of
[1:57:26] God but this is where that I'll tell you
[1:57:29] I'll tell you to be honest with you I
[1:57:32] think this is a time when I look at this
[1:57:34] island that they were cast on when you
[1:57:38] look at what took place there was more
[1:57:40] healings that took place after this
[1:57:42] because the people saw the working of
[1:57:45] the Lord
[1:57:46] after this they wintered there for three
[1:57:50] months they were stranded on this island
[1:57:54] is that right you know an island is a
[1:57:57] place that's surrounded by water it's
[1:58:00] separated from the mainland and God has
[1:58:04] a way in times like this of bringing us
[1:58:07] on an island he said you know I want to
[1:58:10] just separate you unto myself a little
[1:58:12] bit now I know and I thank God that
[1:58:15] really for our church right here we've
[1:58:17] not been touched like other churches
[1:58:18] when it's come to the workforce because
[1:58:22] there's some churches right now in the
[1:58:23] states in the states that have really
[1:58:26] been touched that their churches have
[1:58:28] been really the people in there or out
[1:58:30] of work they don't have the and I think
[1:58:32] one thing for all of us that are able to
[1:58:34] work some of you are able I know they've
[1:58:36] given you permission to go into your
[1:58:37] some of you to your job in your office
[1:58:39] and work others of you there's been so
[1:58:41] many that have went to their stay at
[1:58:45] home and they work from home I tell you
[1:58:47] what in all these things we need to be
[1:58:49] thankful we need to be thankful because
[1:58:51] we're learning we're certainly not
[1:58:52] better no more than anybody else
[1:58:54] God don't love us any better than
[1:58:56] anybody else he loves all his children
[1:58:57] but we just want to be thankful to the
[1:59:00] Lord and be mindful and keep them in
[1:59:02] prayer in those different states and you
[1:59:04] know some of those are in where the hot
[1:59:05] spots are right now in those areas but
[1:59:08] you see nonetheless this is an island of
[1:59:11] opportunity it's an island of
[1:59:13] opportunity that where and and I would
[1:59:15] say it very clearly please don't tune me
[1:59:17] out at this time if this is one thing
[1:59:20] out of this all set your heart in a
[1:59:23] course that I'm going to get closer to
[1:59:26] God
[1:59:27] don't feel your time your time with
[1:59:32] idleness don't feel it with the same old
[1:59:35] stuff don't fill it up with more junk
[1:59:40] but let let let it be more time that and
[1:59:43] I know as I said some people are still I
[1:59:45] think I just talked with you know some
[1:59:47] different ones some brothers are still
[1:59:48] going into their places of employment
[1:59:51] and different ones you know that I know
[1:59:54] of and I understand that not everybody
[1:59:57] maybe they they don't have their hours
[1:59:59] or as so forth hasn't changed but I
[2:00:02] would say that regardless if it's one
[2:00:04] over it's two or if it's throughout the
[2:00:06] family let us take this island of
[2:00:09] opportunity that that we have been cast
[2:00:12] upon because remember it was an island
[2:00:15] that John was cast upon and John was on
[2:00:19] that island he said I am your brother
[2:00:21] now we know that John was cast upon that
[2:00:24] Island the Isle of Patmos it was not it
[2:00:27] was simply as it was it wasn't notice
[2:00:30] John never said it's because that they
[2:00:32] thought I was a religious fanatic or
[2:00:34] they thought I was a nut John did not
[2:00:36] even mention their accusations John said
[2:00:40] I'm here on this island for the word of
[2:00:44] the Lord the patience of Jesus Christ
[2:00:47] that's why I'm here and to a believer we
[2:00:53] know why we're all not the island called
[2:00:56] Malita but we are on this island we're
[2:00:59] gone all the way through the Scriptures
[2:01:02] we're gone even when he came down into
[2:01:04] and to Egypt he wanted to bring his
[2:01:07] people out on a three days journey in
[2:01:10] the book of Hosea chapter 2 speaking of
[2:01:13] Israel even of her time that's coming
[2:01:16] there in that of the 144,000 but yet it
[2:01:19] still applies I will allure her into the
[2:01:22] wilderness that I might speak
[2:01:24] comfortably with her
[2:01:26] God uses these times when the nation of
[2:01:31] Israel was in a time of distress famine
[2:01:34] was upon the land yet there was a little
[2:01:37] woman in therapist who was sustained she
[2:01:43] was part of the vision there was a man
[2:01:46] by the name of Elijah
[2:01:47] he never had any want for food as a
[2:01:50] matter of fact he didn't have ever he
[2:01:52] didn't have ready eats he didn't have
[2:01:54] all that he had something better
[2:01:55] he had that of the crows to deliver his
[2:01:59] sandwiches believe me it was without
[2:02:02] money or price and the menu was just
[2:02:07] what was needed in that hour hold
[2:02:09] there's an oncoming storm on the horizon
[2:02:11] oh he could look here's another one
[2:02:14] ever-present water from the rock KOCO
[2:02:17] repeated on there was that which was
[2:02:20] delivered to him in that time we are
[2:02:23] cast on an island of opportunity and we
[2:02:29] know our destiny that's the question for
[2:02:33] every one of you do you know your
[2:02:34] destiny you might be on this island of
[2:02:37] opportunity right now but this might be
[2:02:39] the opportunity for you to fully
[2:02:40] surrender your life to God and really
[2:02:43] get serious and say you know what I'm
[2:02:44] not making excuses no more I'm not just
[2:02:47] saying well I don't understand all this
[2:02:48] you know the message and I understand
[2:02:50] this but you know what I just no no ask
[2:02:52] God to reveal it to you say God help me
[2:02:55] to die to myself he requires obedience
[2:02:58] to his word get down and obey his word
[2:03:00] ask God to take the love of the world
[2:03:03] out of your life let it be a time than
[2:03:05] when they were on the ship getting rid
[2:03:07] of things like we talked about on
[2:03:08] Thursday night let it be a time where
[2:03:10] there's things of baggage that you've
[2:03:12] been carrying for years it might not be
[2:03:15] sin per se it might be grudges and hard
[2:03:19] feelings and unforgiveness and this and
[2:03:22] that get rid of it it doesn't matter
[2:03:26] it's weighing down the ship this is an
[2:03:30] island of opportunity that we've been
[2:03:34] cast upon to draw closer to the Lord
[2:03:37] spend more time in prayer with God
[2:03:40] not just until the quarantine is over
[2:03:42] but make a real declaration within our
[2:03:45] let it be something in our heart and I
[2:03:47] believe you we begin to see my I've been
[2:03:50] allowing the enemy to take things away
[2:03:52] from me that belong to me
[2:03:55] there's promises to be obtained in this
[2:03:58] hour you see we're not just looking as a
[2:04:03] people of God well I I wonder when this
[2:04:06] is going to return back to normal I
[2:04:07] wonder when we can get back to normal
[2:04:10] you know pharaoh had that attitude over
[2:04:13] and over and I'm not gonna preach on
[2:04:14] that today but favor always had that oh
[2:04:17] I've had old attitude Oh take it away
[2:04:19] and huh we've sinned we've done wrong
[2:04:22] soon as God removed it he was back to
[2:04:24] his old ways again they want to be like
[2:04:27] Pharaoh you want to get on the winning
[2:04:31] side you want to make sure you get in
[2:04:34] the ship with all your heart soul mind
[2:04:37] body and strength don't just give God
[2:04:41] your strength God wants more than just
[2:04:45] ya coming to church God wants more than
[2:04:48] just an association around this message
[2:04:51] you can't take any other way any other
[2:04:54] way it's like getting on a lifeboat well
[2:04:56] I'll just you know I'd do a lot for the
[2:04:58] church you know I help out you know the
[2:05:00] brothers are I open the door or I do
[2:05:02] this
[2:05:02] that's a lifeboat you need to get in the
[2:05:05] ship and say God fully baptized me in
[2:05:08] the body you don't have to depend on
[2:05:11] what you do for the church or I'll do
[2:05:13] this or I do that you don't have to
[2:05:15] depend on that because that is not
[2:05:18] salvation there is only one name that
[2:05:21] you can be saved and that's the name of
[2:05:23] the Lord Jesus Christ there is a known
[2:05:25] place that salvation is in and salvation
[2:05:28] is of the Lord and in the midst of this
[2:05:33] time it's a time to really consecrate
[2:05:36] ourselves because listen not to show
[2:05:38] back up when the doors resume and you
[2:05:41] show up with the same dragging and
[2:05:43] bagging and lugging around the same
[2:05:46] things you've been lugging around up and
[2:05:48] down and in and out and do I have it or
[2:05:51] don't I have it or do it this or do i
[2:05:52] dad or do our this it's time to release
[2:05:55] that baggage it's time to get anchored
[2:05:58] in Jesus Christ I say it from the bottom
[2:06:03] of my heart we're given a time this
[2:06:06] island is an island of opportunity
[2:06:13] brother Samuel I want to spend more time
[2:06:16] with my family we ought to huddle him up
[2:06:18] right next to us let them know of the
[2:06:21] promise let them know there's a greater
[2:06:23] plague than coronavirus that's already
[2:06:25] been going through the land hey man that
[2:06:29] goth angels already been going through
[2:06:31] the land spiritual death is moving in
[2:06:37] church after church after church but yet
[2:06:39] death no life medalists may win not may
[2:06:45] god help us have a balance i i'd give
[2:06:49] this unction from my heart within it
[2:06:51] that our hearts not be charged with
[2:06:54] foolishness let it not be filled up with
[2:06:57] more things that bring emptiness and
[2:07:00] bring more unbelief and invite fear but
[2:07:03] you need to be filled with the love of
[2:07:06] God you need to keep yourself as joob
[2:07:08] said Joseph building up yourself your
[2:07:11] most holy faith keeping yourself in the
[2:07:13] Holy Ghost the love of God amen this is
[2:07:18] an hour of great consecration of great
[2:07:20] seriousness I believe that was on my
[2:07:26] heart that's my prayer God turn every
[2:07:31] life upside down I prayed this for every
[2:07:35] Ford if the ones that I can know and so
[2:07:38] forth and so on god I don't care what
[2:07:40] you got to do take peace lord until it's
[2:07:43] a full surrender lead them to a place of
[2:07:46] desperation to where they're willing to
[2:07:48] die to themselves and be born anew in
[2:07:51] Jesus Christ they don't know that you're
[2:07:54] the only place of safety Lord God bring
[2:07:58] them to that place of humility where
[2:08:00] they're willing to lay down their own
[2:08:01] will I tell you that's how we ought to
[2:08:04] be praying in this hour we ought to be
[2:08:06] desperate with that for our children
[2:08:08] ought to be desperate for one another
[2:08:10] how to beat this is an hour of
[2:08:12] desperation
[2:08:13] it's an hour to look there is a
[2:08:16] certainty of on coming judgement and
[2:08:18] mean that's every man and woman boy and
[2:08:21] girl must know
[2:08:22] whether standing in Jesus Christ amen to
[2:08:26] be certain that you are in the coming of
[2:08:29] the Lord amen
[2:08:31] don't let your millet yourself be
[2:08:33] consumed with knowing the ins and outs
[2:08:36] I'm not saying to be ignorant there can
[2:08:38] be things that we can know about the
[2:08:40] virus there's a lot of things that I've
[2:08:41] study that goes beyond that in this past
[2:08:44] week with with things that's been
[2:08:46] dealing that different ones down through
[2:08:48] the ages have dealt with have just been
[2:08:50] in steady on that it's not to be
[2:08:52] ignorant of it but neither are we to be
[2:08:55] consumed with it don't let it be
[2:09:00] everything you talk about and everything
[2:09:02] you hear and everything this and
[2:09:05] everything that well I can't help it
[2:09:09] it's all over my post then you might
[2:09:12] need to defriend
[2:09:14] or you might need to get rid of that
[2:09:18] note we've got a choice what we're going
[2:09:24] to submerse ourselves in we submerse
[2:09:27] ourselves in the things of god it brings
[2:09:29] life it brings strength it brings
[2:09:32] stability it brings hope and I believe
[2:09:36] with all my heart this is the hour as
[2:09:38] we're living in this time we need to
[2:09:41] take this opportunity that we have we
[2:09:44] need to make good use of it
[2:09:46] amen may God my heart's desire is that
[2:09:51] it'll make hearts and lives more
[2:09:53] appreciative I've come into the house of
[2:09:56] God you know make more of a
[2:09:58] determination to come to the house of
[2:10:01] God than it is to use an excuse and and
[2:10:05] when the reality of it is I'm preaching
[2:10:07] straight from my heart you know when
[2:10:09] things are an excuse but don't make your
[2:10:13] soul don't make excuses for that come to
[2:10:17] the supper come and eat of the Word of
[2:10:20] God it'll give you strength it'll give
[2:10:23] you overcoming power it will bring to
[2:10:26] you that everlasting life amen
[2:10:30] be of good cheer the Lord is in full
[2:10:35] control and I just say very clearly if
[2:10:38] you don't know the Lord or if you've
[2:10:40] been coming here to the church or maybe
[2:10:41] somebody listening in and not even a
[2:10:43] part of this you make sure your life is
[2:10:45] right with God and if it's not right
[2:10:47] with God you don't have to wait till the
[2:10:49] quarantines over there's been a
[2:10:50] quarantine that's already been broke
[2:10:52] through Calvary the blood cell was broke
[2:10:56] that can bring you in where we were
[2:10:58] isolated and kept off from the blessings
[2:11:00] and promises of God but now through him
[2:11:02] by the ringing of the veil the Holy
[2:11:04] Spirit brings us in what we were
[2:11:05] isolated or quarantined off from but now
[2:11:08] we can have access into the presence of
[2:11:11] Almighty God what do I have to do
[2:11:13] obedience and obedience begins with
[2:11:15] repent and if you've repented the next
[2:11:19] thing is be baptized in the name of
[2:11:20] Jesus Christ you say I can't get to the
[2:11:23] water right there but God knows your
[2:11:25] heart you let your heart be aligned with
[2:11:27] God and that's what even repentance is
[2:11:29] and obedience goes even as I've told the
[2:11:31] young people on Friday night it's the
[2:11:33] simple little things you do it's not
[2:11:37] just coming to church that's part of it
[2:11:40] but it's about you obeying the Word of
[2:11:42] God it's about reading the Word of God
[2:11:44] it's about praying it ain't about the
[2:11:46] quantity it's the quality
[2:11:50] make yourself available Oh
[2:11:55] let's pray let's pray father how think
[2:12:03] for we our Lord oh we're so grateful we
[2:12:07] have that resting abiding peace and you
[2:12:10] know your God we're trusting in you then
[2:12:13] as you would give us leadership
[2:12:18] direction in this our Lord we realize
[2:12:23] that you speak and give us a counsel
[2:12:28] also within your word Lord I pray that
[2:12:35] you would help us to be even more
[2:12:38] sensitive more more sensitive to even
[2:12:41] those things that you've put in our
[2:12:43] hands to control
[2:12:46] there's things Lord Jesus that you've
[2:12:48] put in our hands for us to do
[2:12:52] nobody else can do it for us
[2:12:54] we have to do it there's things that we
[2:12:58] can pray and ask you for because widows
[2:13:00] in the way in the world we can do it or
[2:13:01] anybody else can do it but you're able
[2:13:03] to do it
[2:13:05] so lord help us help us as we walk in
[2:13:08] this life even from the simplest of
[2:13:11] things about our life help us to
[2:13:13] recognize the Lord you've placed us here
[2:13:16] with the care for things Lord help us
[2:13:20] the Lord God I pray that Lord in the
[2:13:23] midst of the time in the hour we know
[2:13:26] that Lord even when we would come back
[2:13:28] together Lord whenever that time would
[2:13:31] be I don't know but I'm certain Lord
[2:13:34] that there will be things that maybe we
[2:13:37] would be a little bit more cautious
[2:13:38] which is not altogether it's not bad at
[2:13:41] all
[2:13:41] it's not a lack of faith
[2:13:44] that we would wash our hands or or we
[2:13:47] would make sure if we're running a
[2:13:49] temperature that we make sure we're not
[2:13:51] going to come to the house of God if
[2:13:53] we're sick deathly sick or something
[2:13:55] like that
[2:13:56] we understand that Lord we're not
[2:13:58] proving our faith to anybody
[2:14:00] the Lord I'm also aware that when that
[2:14:03] time would come as your children even
[2:14:05] before we come back together in together
[2:14:08] in the church even as we're going out to
[2:14:11] the stores different appointments that
[2:14:13] different ones have to go to treatments
[2:14:16] that they they are in the middle of
[2:14:18] Lourdes were walking our faith is in you
[2:14:22] we're not going out and doing anything
[2:14:24] because we are proving that will nothing
[2:14:26] can touch me no that would not be faith
[2:14:31] that would be tempting you but Lord when
[2:14:34] we come back together again when that
[2:14:37] comes about I'm certain Lord God that
[2:14:41] there will be thoughts and different
[2:14:43] things that could come or come our way
[2:14:45] maybe Lord depending on where things
[2:14:47] itself and where the virus where it
[2:14:49] would be pervading or whatever more
[2:14:51] maybe there would be some Lord that
[2:14:53] would make certain decisions would we
[2:14:55] think any less of them not one bit not
[2:14:58] one bit
[2:15:00] all over asking for Lord is you would
[2:15:03] help us in the midst of this time
[2:15:06] because one thing that we know Lord God
[2:15:08] that when you've given us true faith
[2:15:11] true faith will never run down the
[2:15:14] actions of somebody else it just rests
[2:15:17] in you so Lord we thank you for that
[2:15:20] Lord we just we ask Lord that you would
[2:15:23] guide us Lord we're thankful for the
[2:15:25] vision of the word then Lord that we are
[2:15:28] seated in oh god I just I thank you for
[2:15:31] this peace
[2:15:33] Lord God you've provided I know I'm not
[2:15:36] the only one that can say this but
[2:15:38] you've provided
[2:15:40] or Jesus more than what Lord God who
[2:15:44] could ever imagine Lord you are faithful
[2:15:49] help us or Jesus help us we need you
[2:15:53] Lord we need your strength I pray that
[2:15:56] God is I pray every hour Lord Jesus help
[2:16:02] them help the medical professionals help
[2:16:04] the medical science Lord help those the
[2:16:07] Lord God that are trying to look and
[2:16:10] bring things together for a cure yes we
[2:16:12] know we know Lord we know for certain
[2:16:15] that that you are the answer but Lord
