[42:58] hold one another up in prayer let's go
[43:00] to the word thank you
[43:02] musicians I want to go into uh the
[43:06] scriptures here this morning and I want
[43:07] to go to Psalms 5
[43:11] 45 and uh no doubt it's a little bit of
[43:15] a different of a scripture reading
[43:17] but in my heart here the
[43:20] other uh the other morning and
[43:24] um we have uh we came through such a
[43:28] wonderful time there last week in
[43:30] service and um and I just um when I came
[43:34] back in here on Tuesday there's thoughts
[43:36] I couldn't just couldn't get off my
[43:38] heart and then I you know you just wait
[43:40] on the Lord just to build if there is
[43:41] something to it and and then on Thursday
[43:44] when I um it just seemed to really come
[43:46] that much more stronger so I just want
[43:49] to really lay in this morning just some
[43:51] direction on even on how we move forward
[43:54] when God has done something like that
[43:56] for us and things have been exposed and
[43:59] complexes and holds have been broken and
[44:02] uh I just want to just want to move
[44:04] forward on that here this morning so in
[44:08] Psalms
[44:09] 45:9 it says King's Daughters were among
[44:13] thy honorable women upon thy right hand
[44:17] did stand the queen in Gold of
[44:20] ofer hearken oh daughter and consider
[44:26] and incline
[44:27] thine
[44:28] ear forget also thine own people and thy
[44:34] father's house so shall thy King greatly
[44:38] desire thy Beauty for he is thy Lord and
[44:41] worship thou him just skip to verse 13
[44:45] with me the King's Daughter is all
[44:50] glorious
[44:51] within her clothing is of rot gold and
[44:57] she shall be brought unto the king in
[44:59] reignment of needle work the virgins her
[45:03] companions that follow her shall be
[45:05] brought unto thee and with gladness and
[45:08] rejoicing shall they be brought they
[45:11] shall enter into the king's Palace amen
[45:16] may God bless the reading of the word as
[45:17] you're being
[45:20] seated I'd like to just speak to you
[45:23] here this morning for a few moments on
[45:25] operating
[45:27] by the law of
[45:29] freedom and I want
[45:32] to kind of draw your attention back to
[45:34] that beginning of the verse maybe some
[45:37] of you still have your if you have your
[45:39] Bible open if you don't that's fine but
[45:41] if you'll notice that that whom it is
[45:44] that would even write this by
[45:48] inspiration it's not David but it's that
[45:51] of the sons of
[45:53] Kora and if you think about it for a
[45:56] moment these
[45:57] these would be of individuals that would
[45:59] there would be linkage and
[46:02] traces back to that very one of their
[46:06] great great great great great great
[46:07] great great grandfather that rose up
[46:10] against the message of the
[46:12] hour and yet he that within where
[46:16] they're standing for them and this is
[46:18] not the only one those of you as a Bible
[46:20] reader you know that going through the
[46:22] Psalms you will find in many cases where
[46:26] inspiration has moved upon that of the
[46:28] sons of Kora and I want to say it in
[46:31] this way as we even look in light and in
[46:33] view of this uh chapter I find it so
[46:36] fitting that for them to be able to
[46:39] express in many of the other writings
[46:41] that your scriptures that you can refer
[46:43] to that they themselves had to be able
[46:47] to look past and overcome their own
[46:51] birth they had to be able to look past
[46:54] all of the negative Heritage that Sur
[46:56] surrounded them and God gave them Grace
[46:59] and you know how God gave them Grace is
[47:02] because they honored the word of God
[47:05] there's no other way for Grace to be
[47:07] transmitted into our lives you know we
[47:10] Grace is is is meant to be a reflection
[47:13] in our life something that truly we
[47:16] don't deserve we can never ever Merit
[47:19] the grace of God that's why it's Grace
[47:21] but Grace is what you and I would
[47:24] receive and accept from God and tell you
[47:27] it's truly in many of the times when we
[47:29] think about it in our own lives we look
[47:31] at our own lives we we see ourselves
[47:34] many times in the mirror and we know our
[47:37] shortcomings uh we know our mistakes we
[47:40] know all of those things about us and
[47:42] yet the word of God as it would pulsate
[47:45] and move in our hearts it just stirs
[47:47] within us and it causes us to believe to
[47:51] look Beyond even our own circumstances
[47:54] and our own conditions and it's things
[47:56] that even even as God would deal with
[47:58] our lives that you know even yet here
[48:00] this morning that the Lord is still
[48:02] bringing out of our lives and is still
[48:05] building our faith and still causing us
[48:09] to recognize who we are I mean many of
[48:13] us can Fellowship on this that you know
[48:15] we went for a long time and it doesn't
[48:17] matter if you're raised in a message
[48:19] Church raised in a church or not but
[48:21] everyone has to have their own personal
[48:25] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:28] coming to church is a wonderful thing
[48:30] but it's got to be more than Church
[48:32] there's got to be a personal experience
[48:36] with the Living God to where that God
[48:39] brings a real change on the inside and
[48:43] he he change he takes away every all the
[48:45] desires of the world and he gives us a
[48:47] strength and there's a real newness of
[48:50] life and and then how that God would
[48:52] even work from that part because you
[48:55] know it all starts with even God
[48:57] beginning to make known to us who we are
[48:59] that we are Sons and Daughters of God
[49:02] and you know I can remember when God
[49:04] began to deal with my life it wasn't at
[49:06] that moment that exactly my flesh or
[49:09] that I begin to turn in the ways of the
[49:11] Lord but God begin to deal with my heart
[49:15] and there was things that begin to be
[49:17] spoken and said out of my mouth and I
[49:19] would say I know I'm not going to be
[49:21] this way forever I know someday I'm
[49:24] going to serve the Lord it was odd for
[49:26] that to even be said even considering
[49:29] the direction and the way that I was
[49:30] even heading and even in that night and
[49:33] so forth but you know it was something
[49:35] about it that would just you know God
[49:37] was dealing with my heart did I fully
[49:39] realize it no I didn't but it's God that
[49:42] begins to deal with our hearts and
[49:44] begins to make known what rightfully
[49:47] belongs to you and I to let us know that
[49:50] you and I we were always a son and
[49:53] daughter of God and you know it takes
[49:54] the word coming with divine grace
[49:57] to build our faith to be able to believe
[50:01] what the word is saying and to accept it
[50:04] and to begin to act upon that word that
[50:06] that takes a real
[50:09] Supernatural uh h h h a leading and move
[50:13] of God to come upon our lives and so
[50:16] these are things as I would want to just
[50:18] say is that when we read this as the
[50:20] text and the scripture would admonish um
[50:24] here o of the queen and I want to just
[50:26] put you and I in this verse of scripture
[50:29] right here hearken oh daughter and
[50:32] consider and incline thine ear and
[50:35] forget also thine people and thy
[50:37] father's house so shall the king greatly
[50:40] desire thy Beauty for he is thy Lord
[50:43] worship thou him now when it speaks of
[50:47] forgetting thine own people the queen is
[50:51] no longer standing in her own country
[50:53] that's good she's no longer in the land
[50:56] of of her own Nativity right she's she's
[50:59] in places that no doubt she never
[51:02] imagined that she would be but she's
[51:04] standing in the very courts of the king
[51:07] and how the king would express to her in
[51:10] that time to forget thine own people now
[51:13] he wasn't talking to her as though in a
[51:15] manner just you know just block it out
[51:18] of your mind but this word forget means
[51:20] go de even goes deeper is that you are
[51:24] not the same person that you were when
[51:27] the word found you and the same word
[51:31] that brought a transformation in your
[51:33] soul and changed your nature is the same
[51:37] God that will lead you to tear down
[51:40] every other altar in your life it'll
[51:43] lead you and guide you to take down
[51:45] every other excuse every other place
[51:48] where there's been hurts there's been
[51:50] wounds that have caused certain
[51:52] responses in our lives this is what the
[51:55] grace of God will do as we hearken to
[51:59] the word of God I tell you I want to
[52:01] give his word preeminence above my
[52:04] thoughts I want to give it because his
[52:06] word is the final say the Bible said
[52:09] that that in the presence of the king at
[52:12] his right hand is fullness of joy It
[52:16] also says that with a king's word there
[52:19] is power and so we want to receive the
[52:23] word of God and to even think how did
[52:25] God would come in this hour through a
[52:28] message and would begin to announce and
[52:31] declare to you and I I want you just to
[52:33] listen to this he he says concerning the
[52:36] Bride of Jesus Christ her righteousness
[52:40] is his righteousness her attributes are
[52:43] his own glorious attributes her identity
[52:46] is found in him what he is she is to
[52:51] reflect what he has she is to manifest
[52:54] there is no f in her she is all glorious
[52:59] within and without from beginning to end
[53:03] she's the work of her Lord and all his
[53:06] works are perfect in fact in her is
[53:09] summed up and manifested the Eternal
[53:12] wisdom and purpose of God how can one
[53:16] fathom it how can one understand it
[53:19] though we cannot do that we accept it by
[53:22] faith for God hath spoken it am yes sir
[53:27] so the thing that that we lock in upon
[53:31] what the word is is speaking concerning
[53:34] our lives and that's what we want to be
[53:37] attentive to is how the word is speaking
[53:40] over our hearts and our lives and say
[53:43] God be it unto me according to Thy word
[53:46] and let us rise to that of the word
[53:48] taking the word above our own feelings
[53:51] above our own thoughts above our own
[53:54] circumstances because the word of of God
[53:57] is more true it's real it's sure it is
[54:03] greater than
[54:05] symptoms yes it is I want you to think
[54:08] of this here brother Brown deals with
[54:10] this here of how that you know he talks
[54:14] about how that you know with the
[54:16] ministry and how that life has has come
[54:19] about and you know a lot of things he
[54:22] talks about he can remember in the early
[54:24] days how things were and he speaks of
[54:26] how that you know he he remembers a lot
[54:29] of those things when the gifts and
[54:31] things were manifesting and you know
[54:33] through the first Parts in his ministry
[54:35] and he said but how that Ministry has
[54:37] come higher and Gifts has multiplied he
[54:40] said but somehow or another I I just
[54:41] wish I was back like I was at the
[54:43] beginning in the first place and he said
[54:46] you know uh sometimes we we you know
[54:49] just forget a lot of things that that
[54:51] they we ever learned and I I think it'd
[54:52] be a lot better and he's dealing with
[54:55] how that through time there's a lot of
[54:57] things that can accumulate and things
[55:00] can happen that work to try to
[55:02] discourage and break
[55:05] confidence I I want to just say this to
[55:07] you very clearly Satan's objective is to
[55:10] try to break confidence in the word of
[55:14] God you see if he can get you to doubt
[55:17] your weapon he's got you
[55:19] whipped you've got to believe your
[55:21] weapon and let me just tell you your
[55:23] weapon is not your feelings right
[55:27] the weapon is the word of
[55:29] God the Lord Jesus when God came down
[55:33] and became one of us he brought it to
[55:35] such a place he was at the weakest point
[55:37] after 40 days and you know why he did
[55:39] that he did that he was just a show but
[55:42] he came there to show you and I that
[55:45] even in the time of greatest of weakness
[55:47] in facing Temptation and test that there
[55:50] was a strength that you and I could hold
[55:52] to that's greater than our feelings he
[55:55] said brother Ram said like this God
[55:57] brought it down to the place to where
[55:59] the weakest
[56:01] Christian could take the word of God and
[56:04] begin to stand on that word and Satan
[56:07] will not have any place to
[56:09] [Applause]
[56:12] stand Hallelujah you ought to just get
[56:15] some Elbow Room right
[56:16] now because let me tell you it's it's a
[56:19] word of God that would begin to dispel
[56:22] the enemy you begin to entertain God's
[56:25] word entertain the promises of God you
[56:29] begin to speak the word of God and I'm
[56:31] telling you the devil's not going to
[56:33] hang around oh he'll try to linger a
[56:35] little bit but you just let him know if
[56:37] you're going to stay here you're going
[56:38] to get an
[56:41] earful if you want to be an ease dropper
[56:44] go ahead and stick
[56:46] around you want to get on this party
[56:48] line go ahead and stick around but I am
[56:50] going to stand upon God's word you said
[56:53] brother Samuel that sounds like
[56:55] foolishness it ain't foolishness the
[56:58] Bible said in Revelations 12 they
[57:00] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[57:03] and the word of their
[57:06] testimony we know exactly where we're
[57:09] standing on God's word that's right
[57:11] hallu Hallelujah and this word that you
[57:15] and I have been given in Revelations 19
[57:19] it speaks that as we have been called to
[57:22] the married supper of the Lamb a word
[57:25] that has given you and my confidence to
[57:27] accept the wedding garment the adornment
[57:30] of the righteousness of the Saints and
[57:33] be adorned with that and be called to
[57:36] the marriage supper of the Lamb let me
[57:38] tell you what's calling you and I the
[57:40] true sayings of God Amen let me tell you
[57:43] what's breaking Gloom and doubt and
[57:46] darkness and unbelief true says of God
[57:49] you say what are you talking about true
[57:51] saying I'm talking about God's thoughts
[57:53] what God thought and what he spoke here
[57:56] in the word man is tried to get a hold
[57:58] of it and I don't necessarily say that
[58:00] man meant anything wrong but unless God
[58:03] brings a visitation in a generation how
[58:07] can we know God's thoughts we're
[58:09] confined to man's isms and man's
[58:12] wonderings and man's recitations of the
[58:15] word but when God comes down he himself
[58:18] is the word and he speaks his word
[58:21] across the generation and there are a
[58:23] people that are ordained for that word
[58:26] word to strike our hearts to absorb it
[58:29] and become Sons and Daughters of God
[58:32] there's nothing else that can bring that
[58:34] reality out of our
[58:37] Lives Hallelujah now I want you to think
[58:39] things accumulate time things build and
[58:43] brother BR says it like this he says I
[58:46] think the road to God is through the
[58:48] path of humility and service I think
[58:52] there's nothing no better in the world
[58:54] to lift us up to Christ than that he
[58:56] said you get to see carnal
[58:58] impersonations and so forth it dolls you
[59:01] and puts something in you I wish it
[59:04] didn't do it he said but I think it gets
[59:06] you in the state of complex when you
[59:09] should not be there you should just keep
[59:11] all things away and move
[59:15] on let me just settle it like this right
[59:17] here there's always going to be carnal
[59:21] impersonations right you might have say
[59:23] well I've been let down by preachers but
[59:25] let me tell you if one a man that gave
[59:27] Ephesians
[59:28] 4 God is the one who gave Ephesians
[59:32] 4 that is so good you might have say
[59:35] well you know I had this said over me or
[59:37] this was prophesied over let me tell you
[59:39] man didn't put that in the church God
[59:41] put it in the
[59:42] church and Satan only wants to try with
[59:46] to try to bring carnal impersonations
[59:48] this is why that he works upon
[59:51] situations to try to bring uh doubt
[59:54] concerning the word of God when people
[59:56] can look and they can see a person's
[59:58] life and oh they were professed to be a
[1:00:00] Christian this one was to be a a
[1:00:02] preacher this one said they were a
[1:00:04] prophet and this one and that and you
[1:00:06] know his whole point he likes let me
[1:00:07] just tell you something Satan likes to
[1:00:09] put poster people
[1:00:11] up and try to put that up as though that
[1:00:15] that is an example of God's word that is
[1:00:18] no example of God's word this is why the
[1:00:21] word of God must be taken deeper than
[1:00:24] our minds it's got to be more than just
[1:00:27] something we agree with it begins there
[1:00:30] but it's got to go to the depths of our
[1:00:32] life to where it brings about a change
[1:00:34] and the word of God is what's burning on
[1:00:36] the inside of
[1:00:38] us then we've got real Christians we've
[1:00:41] got real Believers with a real
[1:00:43] experience and it's not us trying to
[1:00:45] impersonate something but it is Christ
[1:00:48] himself reflecting his own life through
[1:00:51] us hallelujah we've got to we got all of
[1:00:54] those things like that the prophet has
[1:00:55] given some direction that really applies
[1:00:58] to all of our Lives I want you to watch
[1:01:00] that last part of that quote this gets
[1:01:02] you in the state of complex in the realm
[1:01:04] of thinking and trying to deaden and
[1:01:06] trying to take away from the
[1:01:08] supernatural but it shouldn't be there
[1:01:10] you should keep all things away and move
[1:01:13] on yes now let me just say it keep it
[1:01:16] away and move on don't just keep it away
[1:01:20] cuz you're still where it's
[1:01:21] at keep it away move
[1:01:24] on that is so keep it away move on two
[1:01:28] things now the scripture tells us thou
[1:01:31] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:01:34] mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:01:36] trusteth in thee amen Philippians 46 and
[1:01:40] 7 be careful for nothing that's don't be
[1:01:42] anxious but in everything by prayer and
[1:01:47] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:01:49] request be made known unto
[1:01:52] God whatever your need is that you have
[1:01:56] upon your heart here this morning right
[1:01:58] even while the word's coming forth be in
[1:02:01] in prayer and supplication is where
[1:02:03] you're letting your request be made
[1:02:05] known to God prayer begins with
[1:02:09] worship supplication is where you begin
[1:02:12] to release what it is that desires on
[1:02:14] your heart and here's how you do it with
[1:02:16] Thanksgiving amen because it's
[1:02:19] finished if we can recognize it's
[1:02:22] already a finished work God doesn't have
[1:02:25] to come down and take one more stripe
[1:02:29] sir let me just tell you something
[1:02:32] Calvary was
[1:02:34] sufficient when he went to Calvary he
[1:02:36] said it is
[1:02:38] finished right there at Calvary he broke
[1:02:41] the Devil's
[1:02:44] Back
[1:02:48] Hallelujah he went to the lowest parts
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:52] Hell Hallelujah and you know why you say
[1:02:55] why because he had all the past present
[1:02:58] and future sin he was our sin
[1:03:02] Bearer he took all the sin and he bore
[1:03:05] it right there you know what he did he
[1:03:07] put it right back where it
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:12] belongs let me tell you something you're
[1:03:14] your body your life your heart your life
[1:03:17] your mind is not a fit place for
[1:03:19] unbelief that's what the word comes to
[1:03:21] do to cast it
[1:03:24] out Hallelujah
[1:03:26] and he rose on that Easter
[1:03:30] morning he took Satan's Keys away to his
[1:03:33] own house right is that right Satan
[1:03:36] don't even got the keys to his own house
[1:03:39] let me tell you something he came and he
[1:03:41] announced the
[1:03:43] victory hallu is that right and when
[1:03:47] that Victory itself was announced and
[1:03:50] they themselves were rejoicing in that
[1:03:53] victory of the word it brought forth
[1:03:55] victory iory then in their lives when
[1:03:57] they went in the upper room and as they
[1:04:01] themselves were filled with the same
[1:04:04] Holy
[1:04:06] Spirit and they came out speaking in new
[1:04:08] tongues you know what they came out they
[1:04:10] came out it was understandable Jesus
[1:04:13] Christ is Lord he is risen he is exalted
[1:04:16] he has conquered every devil every
[1:04:19] sickness every disease every habit he is
[1:04:22] the mighty conqueror they spoke in other
[1:04:25] tongues
[1:04:26] [Applause]
[1:04:29] Hallelujah you might say here this
[1:04:31] morning I'm hearing you sp I'm I'm
[1:04:33] hearing you but I'm not hearing you out
[1:04:35] of the tongues oh yes you are you are
[1:04:37] hearing me speak of the glory of God and
[1:04:40] the mighty conquerer you're
[1:04:43] understanding it and that's what took
[1:04:45] place on the day of Pentecost how hear
[1:04:48] we every man in our own
[1:04:53] tongue you are hearing God personally
[1:04:56] for your own life you're hearing God
[1:04:59] personally speak to you he's revealing
[1:05:01] himself I am thy Redeemer I am thy
[1:05:05] savior I am thy Lord you are the Sheep
[1:05:09] of my
[1:05:10] pasture
[1:05:12] hallelujah oh I think you need a new
[1:05:15] [Applause]
[1:05:19] tongue
[1:05:22] Hallelujah Oh Glory that is so and the
[1:05:26] peace of God which passeth
[1:05:29] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[1:05:32] and Minds through Jesus Christ the
[1:05:36] prophet said while we're here I want you
[1:05:38] to get all the superstitions away from
[1:05:40] you I want you to get settled down and
[1:05:43] make yourself subject to the holy spirit
[1:05:45] that God can move through you and bring
[1:05:48] the benefits of his
[1:05:51] Blessing now I want you to look here in
[1:05:54] the scriptures in Exodus 14 now I'm
[1:05:58] going to I'm taking from here and I want
[1:05:59] to build forward now in Exodus
[1:06:03] 14 here Israel has come out they've been
[1:06:08] delivered from the hand of
[1:06:11] Egypt God sent a word that he promised
[1:06:16] through Abraham God sent God rose up a
[1:06:19] man by the name of Moses that's right is
[1:06:22] that right he got him separated God
[1:06:26] anointed the faith that was in his heart
[1:06:29] right is that right right and God then
[1:06:33] sends him back now sends it word he
[1:06:36] sends it with with by a prophet and it's
[1:06:39] accompanied with the pillar of fire
[1:06:41] that's and then when Israel think of it
[1:06:44] how am I going to get out of this Egypt
[1:06:46] a strong military power how am I going
[1:06:49] to get out of this situation where I'm
[1:06:51] all hemmed in and seems like isolated
[1:06:54] but God
[1:06:56] brought it down to the Simplicity of let
[1:06:59] every man take a lamb to his house and
[1:07:03] taking that lamb it spoke of the Lord
[1:07:06] Jesus Christ it's taking him for your
[1:07:09] life taking him for your situation and
[1:07:12] they had to slay that lamb and take the
[1:07:15] blood of the lamb and they had to apply
[1:07:17] it on the doorpost right here and above
[1:07:21] they did not put it on the threshold cuz
[1:07:23] you never walk over the blood you're
[1:07:26] always to come under the blood you see
[1:07:29] when you come under the blood that's
[1:07:31] where there's
[1:07:33] Victory so they walk out of there but
[1:07:36] then God stirs up this with
[1:07:42] pharaoh and you think about it you think
[1:07:44] my I mean here they were rejoicing man
[1:07:48] thankful I tell you praise God we're
[1:07:51] we're on our way and we don't have to
[1:07:52] worry about any more slime pits or
[1:07:54] anything else wonderful thing but God
[1:07:57] was also arranging he had already
[1:08:00] arranged a moment to take care of their
[1:08:05] pursuers let me just tell you something
[1:08:07] the things sometimes that you can look
[1:08:09] at in your life like they did at the Red
[1:08:11] Sea that you can think what in the world
[1:08:14] am I up against how is this situation
[1:08:17] maybe this is something that has
[1:08:19] occurred again but if you'll just be
[1:08:21] still and look to God God will take a
[1:08:24] situation that looks so Bleak to you in
[1:08:27] your eyes but he himself will manifest
[1:08:30] his glory and he will consume your
[1:08:35] pursuers are you hearing me this morning
[1:08:38] God God knows what he's doing he's a
[1:08:40] faithful General he knows how to lead
[1:08:43] his people now I want you to notice when
[1:08:45] they came here Moses speaks he
[1:08:48] prophesies and then he tells them in
[1:08:51] verse 14 the Lord's going to fight for
[1:08:53] you right and you hold your peace right
[1:08:57] in other words what you're seeing the
[1:08:59] Earth trembling from their from their
[1:09:01] horses hold your peace don't say
[1:09:05] nothing now you said Brother Sam I
[1:09:07] thought we believe in confession we do
[1:09:10] but God also knows for you and I when we
[1:09:13] need do not utter anything that's
[1:09:17] contrary hold your
[1:09:20] peace and here's what God told Moses
[1:09:24] speak unto the children children of
[1:09:25] Israel that they go forward you see
[1:09:30] that's where the real true reality of
[1:09:33] the word of God it should be causing you
[1:09:35] and I to go
[1:09:37] forward not
[1:09:39] backward forward because we're pressing
[1:09:42] on notice Paul said I'm pressing toward
[1:09:45] the mark that is before me we're in a
[1:09:47] race is that right there's a Finish Line
[1:09:50] there's a goal in sight so the word
[1:09:53] comes to encourage us that we move
[1:09:58] forward now let me just read this part
[1:10:01] to you uh I want to come back into this
[1:10:03] uh quote and I want to draw from this
[1:10:06] particular quotation that I read from
[1:10:08] last week where remember the little
[1:10:11] sister that was you know she was just uh
[1:10:14] encompassed with fear and a complex and
[1:10:17] that was about her life and you know
[1:10:19] when God moved down and broke that broke
[1:10:21] that hold she even asked the question do
[1:10:23] you believe I'll be well and and and you
[1:10:25] know brother BR said I certainly believe
[1:10:26] you will and he said what it was of that
[1:10:28] complex that had you so it had it was
[1:10:31] wrapped around you but the power of it
[1:10:34] just broke Hallelujah now watch what the
[1:10:36] direction that he gives her I I know I
[1:10:39] mentioned this but I'm I'm drawn back to
[1:10:41] this he told her just keep believing
[1:10:47] right press right
[1:10:51] on go
[1:10:53] forward speak
[1:10:56] yeah see the it's it's already been
[1:10:59] broke from around her life now she's got
[1:11:03] to leave right where that's at right you
[1:11:07] understand you we can't continue to
[1:11:09] dwell and and dwell within that this is
[1:11:12] part of God's Direction and how we
[1:11:14] operate by the law of freedom I I'm
[1:11:16] getting to that point this is where we
[1:11:18] keep believing press right on go forward
[1:11:22] and speak because of what God has done
[1:11:24] for you the same God that breaks the
[1:11:27] power of the complex is the same God
[1:11:30] that will give you strength to stand
[1:11:32] there day after day and press forward
[1:11:34] and keep speaking to it I don't care if
[1:11:38] the devil takes your voice you can still
[1:11:40] lip
[1:11:41] it hallah cuz let me tell you it ain't
[1:11:44] the strength of your voice that backs
[1:11:46] the devil
[1:11:48] up it's the faith in your heart that
[1:11:51] Satan has to recognize
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:57] Hallelujah you just go on and be well
[1:11:59] everything will be all right notice
[1:12:01] stand right up to
[1:12:03] it you're all right the blessing's on
[1:12:06] you if you'll just keep going I want to
[1:12:08] just say it
[1:12:09] freedom is going to require something of
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] you Freedom requires something of you
[1:12:18] notice the direction in Paul Stand Fast
[1:12:22] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[1:12:25] Christ hath made yes free and be not
[1:12:30] entangled again with the Yoke of
[1:12:34] bondage that means to stand firm to
[1:12:37] persevere so it's it is in our we have
[1:12:42] been entrusted to maintain our
[1:12:45] Liberty you believe that this is what
[1:12:48] Paul is saying don't don't get entangled
[1:12:49] back don't get caught back don't don't
[1:12:51] get don't get drawn back but stand fast
[1:12:54] in the Liberty where with Christ have
[1:12:56] made you free that's where we're to be
[1:12:58] drawing from now let me just say it to
[1:12:59] you like this with freedom will require
[1:13:02] something of us I want to remind you
[1:13:04] that the prophet he tells you and I you
[1:13:07] must keep the spirit of Revival in you
[1:13:11] amen good prach yeah that that's an
[1:13:14] that's an obligation he says You must
[1:13:17] stay in the spirit of Revival now think
[1:13:19] about this if he's telling us you must
[1:13:21] do that it shows there's going to be
[1:13:24] oppositions that are against
[1:13:26] us and let's just be honest there's
[1:13:29] sometimes where it's not something
[1:13:30] that's alog together it's just the enemy
[1:13:32] coming and running everything down
[1:13:34] sometimes he just wants to drop a little
[1:13:37] something your way but I want you to
[1:13:39] remember Queen I want you to look where
[1:13:42] you're
[1:13:43] standing so what are you talking about
[1:13:45] here Psalms 45 the queen she is all
[1:13:48] glorious with it I want to remind you
[1:13:51] where you're
[1:13:53] standing remind you you are in the
[1:13:56] presence of the
[1:13:58] king Esther you did not bring yourself
[1:14:03] here you were summonsed by a love
[1:14:07] letter that pulled upon your life and
[1:14:10] you submitted to the cleansing and the
[1:14:13] sanctifying you submitted to the
[1:14:15] adornment of the word look where you're
[1:14:19] standing come on friends I think it's
[1:14:22] time that we as the scripture say
[1:14:24] forgive get th th thine father's house
[1:14:27] we need to forget and say and
[1:14:29] immediately when you see going into that
[1:14:32] same way and that acting about things
[1:14:34] and going about it we need to take the
[1:14:37] authority of the word if the word has
[1:14:39] told you and I when you feel you have an
[1:14:42] inferiority complex or some sort of a
[1:14:45] complex take exactly the
[1:14:49] opposite is that
[1:14:51] right then then if the word is speaking
[1:14:53] to us about that
[1:14:55] God is not going to come down and handle
[1:14:58] us like a puppet but he's entrusting you
[1:15:00] and I as Sons and Daughters of God but
[1:15:03] what matters is is whether we're going
[1:15:06] to rely on our
[1:15:10] feelings or go according to how we've
[1:15:12] always
[1:15:16] done come on friends just stay with me
[1:15:19] now right now notice what here we are
[1:15:22] looking at this law of Liberty James
[1:15:25] says in James 1: 25 lay apart all
[1:15:29] filthiness and superfluity of
[1:15:31] naughtiness and receive with meekness
[1:15:33] the engrafted word which is able to save
[1:15:36] your souls be ye doers of the word and
[1:15:41] not hearers only deceiving your own
[1:15:44] selves for if any be a hearer of the
[1:15:46] word and not a doer he is like unto a
[1:15:50] man
[1:15:51] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:15:55] for he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[1:15:57] way and straightway forgiveth what
[1:16:01] manner of man he
[1:16:03] was but who so lookth into the perfect
[1:16:06] law of Liberty and continueth therein he
[1:16:11] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[1:16:14] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[1:16:17] his
[1:16:20] deed very
[1:16:22] simple the word of God is is a clear
[1:16:25] mirror and God comes right through his
[1:16:28] word and he makes things known to our
[1:16:32] lives now I believe as we'll stay in the
[1:16:36] spirit of God I believe that as we're
[1:16:38] staying in step with God I believe that
[1:16:40] God can speak to our lives while you're
[1:16:43] reading in your devotion I believe that
[1:16:46] I I I believe that while you're
[1:16:47] listening to the message at home God can
[1:16:49] speak to you staying in that
[1:16:52] channel right and it doesn't cause you
[1:16:55] as an individual to go off on your own
[1:16:57] but you see we're we're lined up in a
[1:16:59] channel where God can speak to us is
[1:17:02] that right but when we look at this what
[1:17:05] James is talking about is when we have
[1:17:08] seen
[1:17:09] ourselves and then going away and
[1:17:13] forgetting what manner of man that we
[1:17:15] saw in the mirror now if you look at
[1:17:17] this last verse here in verse 25 the
[1:17:20] word does not just come to point out all
[1:17:24] of your
[1:17:27] deficiencies all right it don't do that
[1:17:30] you see this is why that we don't need a
[1:17:32] new mirror God himself he unfolded his
[1:17:36] word in this
[1:17:38] hour right because if man gets a hold of
[1:17:41] the same Bible that you and I have and
[1:17:43] they'll take a hold of that and they'll
[1:17:45] put scriptures here and scriptures there
[1:17:47] and and it and it has things looking in
[1:17:49] a way as though well this is a Christian
[1:17:51] and this is a Believer but reality of it
[1:17:54] is a Christian is one who has repented
[1:17:57] of their sins that have been baptized in
[1:18:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:18:02] are looking to the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:18:05] their
[1:18:07] salvation and then it leads us into a
[1:18:10] place to become a spirit filled
[1:18:13] Christian is that right you shall
[1:18:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but
[1:18:19] God he unveils the mirror and here he is
[1:18:22] uncovering it so that you and I are look
[1:18:24] and not just seeing our deficiencies but
[1:18:27] the way that we see our shortcomings is
[1:18:31] because there's a clear image of the
[1:18:34] perfect one the unveiled God who is
[1:18:37] standing in our midst and the word
[1:18:41] Hebrews 4:12 the word is quick it's
[1:18:44] alive it is powerful it's sharper than
[1:18:47] any two-edged sword it cuts us under
[1:18:51] separating the bone from the morrow the
[1:18:53] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:18:56] intents of the heart it's Christ the
[1:18:58] unveiled one who is standing before
[1:19:02] us and we see our weakness we see our
[1:19:07] need but here's what's important what we
[1:19:11] do after we see what we see that's
[1:19:15] right and you know what that you know
[1:19:17] where that comes in that's where Freedom
[1:19:19] requires something of us it it requires
[1:19:22] something for us Stand Fast in the
[1:19:25] Liberty it requires something of our
[1:19:28] life of our walk to be a doer of the
[1:19:31] word it end about our
[1:19:33] feelings there sometimes here here we
[1:19:36] are we come out of this oh it's
[1:19:37] wonderful in this atmosphere right here
[1:19:39] but when you come out of there tomorrow
[1:19:41] morning you may not feel this atmosphere
[1:19:43] right but what are you going to do
[1:19:45] then well I got to get back to another
[1:19:47] atmosphere don't let the devil lie to
[1:19:49] you like that you you don't got to Chase
[1:19:52] from atmosphere to atmosphere and you
[1:19:53] become you from here to here to here and
[1:19:56] you're looking for some kind of Russ and
[1:19:57] build up but let me just tell you the
[1:19:59] Bible says the word of God is not the
[1:20:02] even in thy
[1:20:03] mouth are you hearing me friends you see
[1:20:05] what the devil likes to do and people
[1:20:07] can chase here and Chase there and Chase
[1:20:08] there and it's it's chasing about
[1:20:10] atmospheres and feelings but you let me
[1:20:12] just tell you something God has built
[1:20:14] you and I to be able to live Victorious
[1:20:18] right where he's placed
[1:20:19] [Applause]
[1:20:21] us brother B tells us he said God's not
[1:20:24] one he's not strong in one area and weak
[1:20:27] in
[1:20:30] another see this is what builds our walk
[1:20:33] as a Believer is not our feelings I love
[1:20:36] to feel God's presence am man I love it
[1:20:39] like I feel it when I when I come in
[1:20:41] here what I feel right now I love that
[1:20:43] but there's days I don't feel
[1:20:44] [Applause]
[1:20:45] [Music]
[1:20:46] it that's true there's days I don't feel
[1:20:50] worthy I'm because of anything I don't
[1:20:52] feel worthy some days it feels like well
[1:20:55] he's away from
[1:20:59] me my my
[1:21:03] my but you see this is where our
[1:21:05] feelings is not what we're based upon
[1:21:08] let me try to get here
[1:21:10] somewhere looking into the perfect law
[1:21:12] of Liberty as we look into the word the
[1:21:14] word itself staying with that word even
[1:21:17] as we leave out of the house of God it's
[1:21:19] staying with that word whatever word
[1:21:22] that God has given you
[1:21:25] you take that word and you whip the
[1:21:28] devil every day of the
[1:21:31] week are you hearing me tomorrow morning
[1:21:35] you whip the
[1:21:36] devil so good I'm going somewhere don't
[1:21:39] worry now you see this here operating by
[1:21:43] the laws of
[1:21:45] Freedom you know brother Ram would give
[1:21:48] this examples over and over it's like if
[1:21:50] you had you know well this over here we
[1:21:52] had a field over there that used to have
[1:21:54] soy beans in it and I don't care you
[1:21:57] know we had if we had an artisian well
[1:21:59] on this property right here and that
[1:22:01] might be burning that crop up I've got
[1:22:04] water here that crop needs
[1:22:06] water but it'll do me no good to scream
[1:22:10] at the top of my voice water get over
[1:22:13] there it won't work but there is a
[1:22:18] law there is a law of gravitation that
[1:22:21] can take that which is here and put it
[1:22:24] over there
[1:22:25] and there's a law that God has given
[1:22:28] that will break that will bring what you
[1:22:31] and I have need of in our life and that
[1:22:33] is the law of faith is so good it'll
[1:22:37] it'll cause the word it'll bring it from
[1:22:40] where it enters in and we say Amen to
[1:22:43] the word of God and man it's wonderful
[1:22:45] it tastes good but remember you got to
[1:22:47] take it on down right it's good right
[1:22:50] here sweet as honey but down here is
[1:22:53] where it gets
[1:22:55] bitter it ain't the word that's bitter
[1:22:58] it's the word itself that is going to
[1:23:03] work against parasites in your
[1:23:07] life the word is going against things in
[1:23:10] your life I'm telling you it's power in
[1:23:12] this
[1:23:14] word you take the word in and it begins
[1:23:17] to work those things out in your
[1:23:21] life Hallelujah yes sir this is why
[1:23:25] don't lose sight of the
[1:23:28] vision what Vision you talking about the
[1:23:31] word what God has spoke to your heart
[1:23:33] and when that word strikes into your
[1:23:35] life you take that
[1:23:37] word no matter what no matter how you
[1:23:40] feel you take that word and that
[1:23:44] promise let me just say this to you like
[1:23:47] this Joseph I could read this but I'm
[1:23:50] not going to Joseph was down in Egypt
[1:23:53] let me tell you he didn't ask to be down
[1:23:56] there that's that's right he could have
[1:23:59] he Joseph could have played the victim
[1:24:01] mentality
[1:24:03] card Daniel could have done the same
[1:24:05] thing come on friends they could have
[1:24:07] said hey why am I here it ain't my fault
[1:24:10] I'm not the one who asked to be down in
[1:24:11] Egypt my brothers threw me down in a
[1:24:14] pit took my coat did this did
[1:24:19] that let me ask you this right now if he
[1:24:22] would have had that kind of an attitude
[1:24:24] now not saying that he didn't have those
[1:24:26] feelings are you with me I'm not making
[1:24:27] cuz we ain't making nobody Superman here
[1:24:30] we're not reading Marvel Comics we're
[1:24:32] reading the
[1:24:33] Bible and the Bible doesn't highlight
[1:24:36] man it highlights God in
[1:24:40] man he had to battle thoughts when he
[1:24:43] laid there on his
[1:24:45] bed he did not understand what was
[1:24:48] taking place as a 17-year-old boy God
[1:24:52] gave him a dream but he had no idea what
[1:24:55] he'd have to go through before itd come
[1:24:57] to pass but you know what it was what it
[1:25:00] was it had was no problem with the dream
[1:25:03] God had to bring the man in a fit
[1:25:06] condition for the dream to come to
[1:25:08] pass you see there's no problem with the
[1:25:11] word but it's God working out to bring
[1:25:14] his people into a place for the word to
[1:25:17] come to pass and you know what it's the
[1:25:20] word working the whole
[1:25:21] time you know what it's working in
[1:25:23] Joseph life that Vision was working the
[1:25:26] whole
[1:25:29] time
[1:25:31] Hallelujah good well he laid there he
[1:25:34] cried wept no doubt at night you think
[1:25:37] feelings didn't try to come back to him
[1:25:39] come on he was human it's just like when
[1:25:41] somebody's done you wrong or said
[1:25:42] something or whatever more don't tell me
[1:25:44] you say oh brother Samuel I've forgiven
[1:25:46] him let's just be honest and stop
[1:25:48] pretending you can forgive somebody but
[1:25:51] let me just tell you sometimes you can
[1:25:52] have feelings come back but you have to
[1:25:54] go contrary to those
[1:25:57] feelings are you hearing
[1:25:59] me all right now when we see this he had
[1:26:02] to deal with all it but here's where it
[1:26:04] comes down to this is what I want to get
[1:26:05] to with
[1:26:08] Joseph when he came out to appear before
[1:26:11] Pharaoh he came to a place to where when
[1:26:15] that famine was was was was was revealed
[1:26:18] of what was going to take place going to
[1:26:19] be seven years of plenty seven years of
[1:26:21] phantom here Joseph came out and in the
[1:26:24] midst of the time of the Gathering in of
[1:26:28] the vision of the word of the
[1:26:31] preparation for the vision to be
[1:26:33] fulfilled there was a union that came
[1:26:37] there between him and that Gentile
[1:26:41] bride are you with me and out of that
[1:26:44] and out of that Gentile bride notice
[1:26:47] what took place Joseph is able to
[1:26:49] declare out of his own life that here
[1:26:52] through Manasseh God hath made me to
[1:26:56] forget that is so good you you
[1:27:00] understand it it wasn't just something
[1:27:01] and then it came in but now it became
[1:27:04] fruit in his life forgiveness was now a
[1:27:08] fruit forgiveness was something he could
[1:27:11] put on his knee forgiveness is something
[1:27:14] that he knew he experienced in his life
[1:27:17] how did he experience it by a seed
[1:27:20] coming into a bedding ground and it
[1:27:22] coming forth and now forgiveness
[1:27:24] something that no doubt he was looking
[1:27:27] for and asking for and longing for it
[1:27:29] became an
[1:27:31] expression in the union that is so good
[1:27:35] and not just that of forgiveness but God
[1:27:38] would even through Ephraim which means
[1:27:41] he hath made
[1:27:42] me to forget or be fruitful rather in
[1:27:47] the land of my Affliction do you notice
[1:27:49] how that came amen he didn't say God has
[1:27:52] made me to be fruitful and then no one
[1:27:54] born after that God has caused me to
[1:27:56] forget it was that
[1:27:58] forgetting forgiving forgetting that led
[1:28:02] to
[1:28:03] fruitfulness you see sometimes in our
[1:28:05] life where things stall are you with me
[1:28:08] now sometimes when the power of a
[1:28:10] complex things are broken things are
[1:28:13] moving around our life but yet from that
[1:28:15] point what we do from that point matters
[1:28:19] what matters is is Lord I this word I
[1:28:22] want to see this word come to to pass in
[1:28:24] my life cuz sometimes we can go for a
[1:28:27] day for two for a week and all of a
[1:28:29] sudden we sense things starting to come
[1:28:31] back around us but remember you can't
[1:28:33] stay where you're at you've got to keep
[1:28:36] moving on with the Lord right God gives
[1:28:39] us Grace to do that is that right now
[1:28:42] here he comes into that place he's
[1:28:44] actually got to take that in and you
[1:28:46] know sometimes where the things listen
[1:28:48] let me just say it like this sometimes
[1:28:49] where it is where persons and people can
[1:28:52] get into a situation and they're looking
[1:28:54] at why am I so fearful why am I so
[1:28:56] afraid let me tell you what what happens
[1:28:58] perfect love cast out all fear and if
[1:29:01] you see what it is if you've fallen out
[1:29:03] of love this is a direct quote he said
[1:29:06] when you've fallen out of love with the
[1:29:08] Lord Jesus you cannot overlook your
[1:29:12] brother or sister's
[1:29:14] mistakes and so sometimes watch how the
[1:29:17] devil is he is he is a guy of diversion
[1:29:20] he wants to get us focused on this and
[1:29:23] the real reality
[1:29:24] of our full deliverance and maintaining
[1:29:27] Liberty is dwelling more in the love of
[1:29:31] God that will absolutely dismantle fear
[1:29:35] and will birth in our life a real Spirit
[1:29:38] of
[1:29:40] forgiveness sometimes the very things
[1:29:42] that's hindering a person from the word
[1:29:44] going on in their life is a lack of
[1:29:47] forgiveness come
[1:29:49] on but this is why the spirit of God
[1:29:51] comes to expose these things I I don't
[1:29:54] know about you but I this is how I feel
[1:29:56] in my heart when the spirit of God just
[1:29:58] begin to deal with my heart on Tuesday
[1:30:00] and some different things and then on
[1:30:01] Thursday as I come in oh my I just begin
[1:30:04] to just more the things just seem like
[1:30:06] it exploded and continuing because for
[1:30:08] what purpose we just don't want to have
[1:30:11] just a wonderful service and then we go
[1:30:14] from here but we want to see God he
[1:30:16] broke holds upon lives God himself broke
[1:30:20] complexes now we want to walk with the
[1:30:23] instruction of the word to keep going
[1:30:27] forward thank God for his Deliverance
[1:30:29] don't you I thank God for coming and
[1:30:31] breaking and speak into our lives but I
[1:30:33] thank him for his instruction in his
[1:30:35] word as well too my my let me see where
[1:30:38] I'm at I I know I got some places I want
[1:30:40] to get to here in just a moment but
[1:30:42] notice when you look at all of this this
[1:30:45] these parts within it here we want to
[1:30:47] have the right confession that's what we
[1:30:51] want to have the right confession now I
[1:30:53] want to remind you the prophet when he
[1:30:55] goes into this here an eagle stirreth up
[1:30:57] his
[1:30:58] nest and this whole part right here
[1:31:01] where brother Brown remember I I read
[1:31:03] this to you last week brother Bram talks
[1:31:05] about how somebody who's been sick for a
[1:31:07] while or had a condition in their life
[1:31:09] for a while and he said sometimes he
[1:31:11] said they can build up a complex
[1:31:13] especially if they've been sick for a
[1:31:14] while and he told us he said now don't
[1:31:16] resent it I'm getting ready to tell you
[1:31:18] he said but don't resent it he said you
[1:31:20] take a child that's been petted and that
[1:31:21] child becomes to rep place it just wants
[1:31:23] to be petted it builds up a complex you
[1:31:26] can't do nothing with that child until
[1:31:28] you shake him right
[1:31:30] good you see what God God God not God
[1:31:33] didn't come down and and he's not and
[1:31:35] he's not shaking us out of meanness he's
[1:31:37] got to shake us out of our own
[1:31:41] thoughts come on we can get a world that
[1:31:44] we start living in right we live in our
[1:31:47] own little
[1:31:49] world we built a complex around we've
[1:31:52] got our own currency
[1:31:54] we've got our own exchange rate you got
[1:31:57] to show up to our booth you got to
[1:31:58] exchange your money for our money we
[1:32:00] live in our own little world what can do
[1:32:02] that a
[1:32:04] complex and it's a spirit yes it is it
[1:32:08] can so hinge a person
[1:32:11] in but God comes to break that open let
[1:32:14] me tell you the same God that came down
[1:32:18] and he and he broke that Veil on that
[1:32:20] Easter morning they tried to seal him in
[1:32:23] they shut it up they said they made sure
[1:32:26] with the Roman seal but he broke the
[1:32:29] Seal of
[1:32:32] man they put guards to watch it over his
[1:32:35] life let me tell you something the enemy
[1:32:37] has said you'll never get free you'll
[1:32:39] never be well but the spirit of
[1:32:43] [Applause]
[1:32:44] God he is the one that makes real that
[1:32:48] he has triumphed over every
[1:32:52] principality over every devil over every
[1:32:57] habit
[1:32:59] Hallelujah glory be to God he shakes us
[1:33:02] from our own way of
[1:33:05] thinking is that right talks about how
[1:33:08] we getting that self-pity and everything
[1:33:10] else and he said we're in a pitiful
[1:33:12] condition right then when you get the
[1:33:14] pity in yourself you want everybody to
[1:33:16] pity you you want to pity
[1:33:18] yourself I like how I said and I read it
[1:33:20] to you last week he said I hit that spot
[1:33:22] one time
[1:33:24] he said when I had my
[1:33:26] breakdown but he said I read a book by
[1:33:29] FF Bosworth called Christian
[1:33:34] confession I love that
[1:33:36] book he said I read that book and he
[1:33:39] said that's where I heard an eagle
[1:33:41] scream it broke that from around his
[1:33:45] life now let's look at that let's look
[1:33:48] at that principle for a little bit this
[1:33:49] morning everybody all right let's look
[1:33:51] at that that principle here just a a
[1:33:53] little bit here this morning now now I
[1:33:55] want you to notice this the Bible says
[1:33:57] he's the high priest of our profession
[1:33:59] that means our confession what you say
[1:34:02] he is that's who he is you say well I'm
[1:34:05] not a very good Christian he can't
[1:34:07] intercede on
[1:34:08] that cuz that ain't what he said well I
[1:34:11] don't think I'll make it he can't
[1:34:12] intercede on that but if you go to start
[1:34:15] saying if got before us who can be
[1:34:18] against us he can go to work on that one
[1:34:21] that's his word
[1:34:24] oh one day I'm going to be healed he
[1:34:25] can't intercede on that but he'll work
[1:34:28] on your life until where you're ready to
[1:34:30] come to that place and it moves in your
[1:34:31] heart to say by his stripes I am healed
[1:34:34] on one of these days I'll be delivered
[1:34:36] he can't go to work on that but he'll
[1:34:38] deal with your heart move on your faith
[1:34:40] to where you can begin to rise and you
[1:34:42] see yourself as a free person in Jesus
[1:34:46] Christ I am
[1:34:50] free glory be to God see this this is
[1:34:53] where our faith has got to be turned
[1:34:57] loose when our faith now watch this here
[1:35:01] I think I think I'm in the right place
[1:35:03] no maybe I'm not there we go when your
[1:35:05] faith says that you're going to be uh
[1:35:07] you know the same as your sight and the
[1:35:09] man had a red tie and a brown suit over
[1:35:11] there your faith is the substance of
[1:35:13] things hope for the evidence of things
[1:35:15] you do not see there you are you believe
[1:35:17] it and you can't you can't accept it
[1:35:21] until and now until you believe it and
[1:35:24] you've got to believe it before you act
[1:35:27] you see what I mean he said people stand
[1:35:29] on the platform and well I why don't why
[1:35:32] don't something happen it can't happen
[1:35:35] until you first believe it accept it and
[1:35:39] confess it that's called a b
[1:35:42] c you've got to accept it believe it and
[1:35:47] confess
[1:35:48] it everybody knows algebra youve got
[1:35:51] them letters called variables right but
[1:35:53] you You' got to learn your ABCs and
[1:35:55] you're learning these ABCs accept it

[1:36:00] take those three simple principles and
[1:36:03] you can have the biggest problem in
[1:36:05] front of your life that is filled with
[1:36:08] variables but it makes no difference

[1:38:37] complex the Bible said let the redeemed
[1:38:40] of the Lord say so that's right I am my
[1:38:44] beloveds and he is mine Hallelujah the
[1:38:47] Bible said I'm the apple of his
[1:38:50] eye Psalm tells me that know ye the Lord
[1:38:53] that we are his sheep or his people the
[1:38:58] Sheep of his pasture it is not us that
[1:39:01] have made oursel he hath made
[1:39:04] us on and on we can go I can do all
[1:39:06] things through Christ who strengthens me
[1:39:09] that's I want you to think of this the
[1:39:10] word will defeat the enemy I want you to
[1:39:14] think about this in terms this scripture
[1:39:16] here just really came to my heart so
[1:39:18] strong so strong there on Thursday
[1:39:21] morning and this is dealing with Samson
[1:39:23] I I don't have time to read it but this
[1:39:25] is dealing with Samson and I want you to
[1:39:28] I want to remind you Samson was a
[1:39:29] Nazarite unto God and here was
[1:39:32] Philistines that came around him and and
[1:39:34] there arose a need and the Bible said he
[1:39:38] saw a new
[1:39:40] Jawbone right right and he went over
[1:39:43] what God pointed out he went over and
[1:39:46] picked that Jawbone
[1:39:48] UP And with that Jawbone he slew a
[1:39:52] thousand Philistines
[1:39:54] you talking about a paradox how God
[1:39:57] could keep that Jawbone together their
[1:40:00] har their helmets made out of I don't
[1:40:02] know what but he was able to hold
[1:40:04] together but I want you to notice what
[1:40:06] slew the enemy a Jawbone of an
[1:40:10] ass and God hath anointed you to speak
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:15] word come on friends he's given you he
[1:40:19] put a word in your mouth amen your
[1:40:22] language is not the same language that
[1:40:24] it used to be your language has been
[1:40:28] changed it's been changed by the spirit
[1:40:31] of God when God has taken a hold of your
[1:40:33] life it's a new Jawbone and God right
[1:40:36] through that anointing your heart and
[1:40:38] coming out through your life will slay
[1:40:41] Philistine after Philistine after
[1:40:43] Philistine after Philistine after
[1:40:46] Philistine I'm talking about Philistines
[1:40:48] even of Gloom of
[1:40:50] Doubt even when a person would walk up
[1:40:53] appear and accept salvation and they
[1:40:56] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their
[1:40:58] savior they say Lord I'm laying down my
[1:41:01] life I Repent of my sins Lord I want to
[1:41:04] walk on with you they at that moment
[1:41:07] with faith in God's word are to rise up
[1:41:10] and to rise in that place and begin to
[1:41:13] testify I am
[1:41:17] saved are you hearing me it'll work the
[1:41:21] word works yes remember freedom is going
[1:41:25] to require something from
[1:41:27] us it's going to require
[1:41:30] something
[1:41:32] right Hallelujah now let me just move on
[1:41:35] here I'm coming I'm coming I'm
[1:41:38] coming I know some of you the locals
[1:41:40] begin you don't even believe me anymore
[1:41:41] but I'm
[1:41:42] coming I'm coming the tray tables
[1:41:44] straight out they hadn't even they
[1:41:46] hadn't come down the aisle to collect
[1:41:47] the little cup shed we're we're getting
[1:41:48] there
[1:41:49] though this is powerful death and life
[1:41:52] are in the power power of the
[1:41:56] tongue I'm so glad that he don't
[1:41:58] intercede When We complain and we get
[1:42:01] into a place and say Lord I just ain't
[1:42:02] no good I'm just no good I'm you know
[1:42:06] what I'm glad he don't accept that
[1:42:08] vow but as our husband he dis anals that
[1:42:11] vow every time he said that is not who
[1:42:14] you are oh glory be to God don't you
[1:42:18] love the Lord oh I just I just give up
[1:42:21] no no no no no he can he cannot begin to
[1:42:23] act upon that you know why cuz you
[1:42:26] didn't start
[1:42:27] it Hallelujah you can only stop what you
[1:42:31] started but the Bible said he that have
[1:42:34] begun a good work in you shall perform
[1:42:38] it unto the day of Jesus Christ but
[1:42:40] death and life are in the power of the
[1:42:42] tongue this is why Paul writing to
[1:42:45] positioned Believers in
[1:42:48] Christ let no corrupt communication
[1:42:53] proceed out of your mouth now that might
[1:42:55] sound like a little Sunday school
[1:42:57] scripture to you and I but these are
[1:42:59] positionally placed Believers in
[1:43:02] Ephesians that he had to remind them
[1:43:05] don't say things of corruption out of
[1:43:09] your mouth you know what that means
[1:43:11] right down here in the Judgment seat get
[1:43:14] it stopped right there every thought
[1:43:16] that comes in bring it to the Judgment
[1:43:18] seat of Christ bring every thought into
[1:43:22] cap acity and bring it in right
[1:43:25] there are you with me you know what I
[1:43:28] mean word words create an atmosphere
[1:43:29] don't they sometimes even the thoughts
[1:43:32] you get to thinking on something long
[1:43:33] enough man I mean it just creates just a
[1:43:36] Gloom it can create such a I mean it can
[1:43:39] be as sunny as it is outside but we can
[1:43:41] get in our own little cloudy
[1:43:44] world Listen friends I'm talking to all
[1:43:46] of us right here this morning but these
[1:43:49] are the times where we have to take the
[1:43:51] word of God and let me just tell you
[1:43:52] something H let us not be too big
[1:43:55] because when we talk about having an
[1:43:57] individual walk with God you got to also
[1:43:59] keep that in perspective you are not on
[1:44:01] an island by yourself we are a body of
[1:44:05] Believers that's why we had prayer
[1:44:07] requests one for another this is why we
[1:44:09] pray for one another this is why that
[1:44:12] even when one is going through something
[1:44:14] the Bible tells us when one suffers we
[1:44:16] all
[1:44:17] suffer and just so you understand
[1:44:20] it God's not having the rest of us read
[1:44:23] your mind right the Bible said let them
[1:44:27] that are sick call for the Elders of the
[1:44:30] church so let's just bust out of that
[1:44:33] little world right there our pity World
[1:44:35] well well nobody did this and nobody
[1:44:37] let's just bust right out of that thing
[1:44:38] and say wait a minute here I've got to
[1:44:40] obey the word the Bible said if there be
[1:44:42] any sick among you let them call for the
[1:44:45] Elders of the church amen let us reach
[1:44:48] out to one
[1:44:50] another let us reach out and pray and
[1:44:53] and take hold of God's
[1:44:55] word my my y'all believe
[1:44:58] this Hallelujah may maybe some of y'all
[1:45:01] maybe Heaven's going to be a full of
[1:45:02] islands you have your little island this
[1:45:04] one has their little island and we'll
[1:45:06] just boat from one another nope that's
[1:45:08] not how Heaven's going to be I'm
[1:45:11] sorry I'm sorry it's not going to be
[1:45:13] that way at all and you know what right
[1:45:15] down here right now it's not us acting
[1:45:17] something out you know sometimes the
[1:45:19] Bible tells tells us in the Book of
[1:45:21] Jonah that many times people people
[1:45:23] forsake their own
[1:45:26] mercies things where God himself is
[1:45:29] calling upon us and to reach out listen
[1:45:31] let me just tell you something we should
[1:45:32] not be we should say you know what I'm
[1:45:34] going to put my ego to the side matter
[1:45:36] of fact I'm going to run my ego through
[1:45:38] the blood of Jesus Christ I'm going to
[1:45:41] call upon God I'm going to reach out to
[1:45:43] somebody if I am going through
[1:45:46] something I want to reach out if I need
[1:45:49] prayer I want to reach out
[1:45:53] I know I know I know I know I know that
[1:45:55] that that's simple I know that but
[1:45:57] sometimes it's such the simple things
[1:45:58] like
[1:45:59] this that we fail to do
[1:46:05] yes watch this let me let me try to
[1:46:07] bring this down and close
[1:46:09] here brother BR said healing is not just
[1:46:12] something that you say well I believe it
[1:46:15] I believe it that's all right if that's
[1:46:18] the best you can do I love that it's not
[1:46:21] just something you say but if that's the
[1:46:22] best you you can do just mentally just
[1:46:25] say well yes I see it I believe it I
[1:46:28] accept it then if you accept it on those
[1:46:31] basis keep saying it over and over say
[1:46:36] it out loud say it over and over just
[1:46:39] keep saying it I'm Healed I'm Healed say
[1:46:43] it until actually you believe it and
[1:46:46] when you believe it then something's
[1:46:48] going to take place
[1:46:53] if you accept it that way then let's say
[1:46:56] it over and over and over and then
[1:46:59] eventually it comes and it kicks in
[1:47:01] where we believe it you know what
[1:47:04] happens it drops from here down here and
[1:47:08] the subconscious the man that's the man
[1:47:10] down there in the engine room that's the
[1:47:11] one who actually runs the ship anyhow
[1:47:13] right it ain't the guy out there in the
[1:47:14] Crow's Nest the guy up in The Crows Nest
[1:47:17] is given all these directions but the
[1:47:18] guy down here in the engine room he's
[1:47:19] the one that's controlling whether it's
[1:47:21] going forward or not right yeah true is
[1:47:23] that right so notice here don't never
[1:47:27] have a negative testimony every time you
[1:47:30] confess I still feel bad today you go
[1:47:34] straight straight back in the same rut
[1:47:37] that you was in the beginning there's
[1:47:38] not a man or woman in here that's
[1:47:40] baptized with the Holy Spirit but would
[1:47:42] start your confession I believe I lost
[1:47:44] the Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from
[1:47:46] me you'll go right down you'll never
[1:47:50] live above your
[1:47:54] confession my my my my my notice this he
[1:47:58] Hebrews 3:1 and he quotes a scripture
[1:48:00] profession is confession to sitting at
[1:48:03] the right hand of the father to make
[1:48:04] intercessions upon what our confession
[1:48:06] he can't do nothing for you until first
[1:48:09] you confess he's done it when you've
[1:48:12] accepted it now I wasn't saved I'm not
[1:48:14] saved tonight because I get happy and
[1:48:16] Shout that isn't it I'm not saved
[1:48:19] because the gift of God works through me
[1:48:21] I'm saved because I have met the
[1:48:23] conditions that Jesus Christ required
[1:48:26] from me I'm saved according to the Bible
[1:48:28] not because I feel like I'm saved Satan
[1:48:33] can whip you around the stump on your
[1:48:36] feelings but he can't when it's thus
[1:48:38] sayith the Lord he can't wait a cross
[1:48:41] there that'll defeat him right watch
[1:48:46] this when you believe you were saved
[1:48:48] sitting right in your seat and you
[1:48:50] accepted it and you begin to conf
[1:48:52] confess and tell people you were saved
[1:48:55] you kept on saying I'm
[1:48:58] saved now I don't know about you let me
[1:49:00] just let me just let me just speak my
[1:49:02] heart when God first got a hold of my
[1:49:05] life that that that morning over there
[1:49:07] right next to them dog cages in your
[1:49:09] basement and what I had just come out of
[1:49:12] from the
[1:49:13] previous
[1:49:15] stuper you know to come out of there
[1:49:17] there was so much doubt that wanted to
[1:49:19] swirl around my mind you'll never break
[1:49:22] free of this you'll never get out of
[1:49:24] this you'll never get out of that this
[1:49:25] and this and this all those things were
[1:49:27] swirling around but you know it began
[1:49:30] just simply right there I'm
[1:49:33] saved I'm
[1:49:35] saved and you know what that very thing
[1:49:38] it worked out righteousness but you know
[1:49:40] that same principle works right now in
[1:49:42] my life the same principle is what works
[1:49:46] in your life right now for healing right
[1:49:49] it's the same principle coming out of a
[1:49:52] complex it's the same principle you love
[1:49:57] him oh
[1:49:59] my brother BR says you know people
[1:50:01] eventually say there ain't no difference
[1:50:02] in you but you believe there was and you
[1:50:05] kept with your confession and after a
[1:50:08] while it worked righteousness all your
[1:50:10] neighbors and everybody knows you're
[1:50:11] saved now because you believed it and
[1:50:14] you confessed it see that's the same
[1:50:17] thing about your your healing you accept
[1:50:19] him as your healer renounce your
[1:50:21] feelings right it's not by your feelings
[1:50:24] it's by faith say you're healed believe
[1:50:29] you're healed act like you're healed
[1:50:32] here's a key associate with those who
[1:50:36] believe in
[1:50:38] healing and God will bring you right out
[1:50:41] to a perfect soundness of health and
[1:50:43] will not
[1:50:46] fail you can't look at your
[1:50:49] symptoms goes on talking about this very
[1:50:52] next statement for a person who is in a
[1:50:55] wheelchair and that can seem like man
[1:50:57] I've been here for all this time but you
[1:51:00] know to God he goes on to says it right
[1:51:02] there in God's eyes your condition in a
[1:51:05] wheelchair is no different than a
[1:51:07] toothache to God right I say Lord help
[1:51:11] us to see what God sees help us not to
[1:51:15] look in where the conditions and where
[1:51:17] we're at but God help us to see as God
[1:51:21] sees how many say Lord I want to move
[1:51:23] beyond my feelings I know it's simple
[1:51:26] friends I know it's simple but when the
[1:51:28] power of things are broken you begin to
[1:51:30] feel God coming down and just with
[1:51:32] things that he's discerned within our
[1:51:34] hearts and our lives and during this
[1:51:36] time of renew things would be broken you
[1:51:39] want to walk on with God Amen with the
[1:51:41] victories that God has given what God
[1:51:44] has done and begun in your life you've
[1:51:46] got to walk on with him you've got to
[1:51:48] take that word and keep confessing that
[1:51:51] word
[1:51:52] I know every one of us including me
[1:51:55] including me I think brother Trevor put
[1:51:57] it so clearly right here when he had to
[1:52:00] take the word of God by confession for
[1:52:02] his own healing when he couldn't even
[1:52:04] turn his
[1:52:05] head and through the first part of last
[1:52:08] year it's those are not those are not
[1:52:10] the things that we we Delight in we look
[1:52:13] every one of us including me when I've
[1:52:16] been sick oh I would have loved for
[1:52:19] something to have been a
[1:52:21] miracle right here but we've got a
[1:52:23] promise I'm the Lord that Health
[1:52:26] thee and healing itself is not a miracle
[1:52:29] though when it takes place it is a
[1:52:32] miracle but a miracle is something that
[1:52:34] happens right then and
[1:52:37] there that's good but healing says they
[1:52:40] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:52:43] shall recover didn't say when didn't
[1:52:47] give a timestamp on it as a matter of
[1:52:49] fact when the when when the when the
[1:52:51] gentleman in John chapter 2 not the
[1:52:53] Roman Centurion but in John Chapter 2
[1:52:56] when that he had he had a servant that
[1:52:58] was sick and the Lord Jesus he actually
[1:53:01] wanted Jesus to come to his house Jesus
[1:53:03] said I can't make it there he said and
[1:53:05] then finally the Lord Jesus said if thou
[1:53:07] believe he said I believe he spoke the
[1:53:09] word and the Bible says on his way back
[1:53:13] his servants met him and said hey hey
[1:53:17] he's healed and the question that he
[1:53:19] asked what hour did he begin
[1:53:23] to
[1:53:25] amend when did the healing start to take
[1:53:29] place when did the fever break when did
[1:53:32] things begin to take place let me tell
[1:53:34] you something God working in your life
[1:53:38] yes sir come on and in my
[1:53:40] life it takes simple obedience to God's
[1:53:44] word amen and it begins to amend as
[1:53:48] things are broken stay with it keep with
[1:53:51] it and press sing right out and you know
[1:53:53] what then you'll be the one standing as
[1:53:55] a testimony as a testimony of what God
[1:53:58] has brought you through anybody know
[1:54:00] what I'm talking about testimonies of
[1:54:02] different things to where you're
[1:54:04] actually able to pray I mean when you
[1:54:06] can enter in for other people that are
[1:54:07] dealing with certain conditions and
[1:54:09] certain things like that you're able to
[1:54:11] enter in and really pray for them
[1:54:13] because you have passed through that way
[1:54:16] and God has brought you through and you
[1:54:18] can actually sympathize and enter in
[1:54:21] with them
[1:54:25] oh God help us let's bow our
[1:54:35] heads oh Lord

[1:54:54] it's a truth it's a
[1:54:56] truth God is

[1:56:23] encouragement Lord to be able to
[1:56:26] understand that and walk on that we need
[1:56:29] we must operate by that law of
[1:56:32] Freedom Lord in order to move in like
[1:56:35] that water from one field to another
[1:56:38] field there's a law of
[1:56:41] gravity or the same way father for the
[1:56:44] word of God working in our lives it's a
[1:56:46] law of
[1:56:47] Faith you brought it down so
[1:56:50] simple that if Lord
[1:56:52] Jesus even if it's
[1:56:55] something for us Lord to where it's just
[1:56:58] something it seems like at that moment
[1:57:00] we just can't seem to
[1:57:03] grasp Lord I want to be simple and
[1:57:05] humble
[1:57:07] enough to take that
[1:57:10] word and to confess it
[1:57:14] Lord that
[1:57:16] freedom healing is
[1:57:19] mine Deliverance is mine

[2:00:26] God May that Lord be what strikes the
[2:00:29] hearts help us in our daily life Lord we

[2:00:41] reports negative
[2:00:44] headlines nothing's ever positive even
[2:00:46] when it come comes to the weather
[2:00:49] instead of saying partly sunny it'll say
[2:00:51] partly cloudy
[2:00:53] God help us
[2:00:55] Lord here we
[2:00:57] are walking Lord in a negative World

[2:01:07] I pray that the light that has Shone in
[2:01:10] Upon Our Hearts here this morning may we
[2:01:13] walk forward with that confession in our
[2:01:15] lives may we take that word that Lord
[2:01:18] you would drop our way Lord God when we
[2:01:21] feel
[2:01:23] insufficient may we look at what you
[2:01:26] have said about
[2:01:28] us as our text this morning said

[2:01:35] daughter incline thine
[2:01:38] ear Grant it Lord I

[2:01:45] you Minister Lord continue even after
[2:01:48] the service has commenced Lord may we we
[2:01:52] take these things Lord God and walk
[2:01:55] forward Lord into Liberty I
[2:01:57] pray in Jesus precious name
[2:02:03] amen I want to remind you
[2:02:06] that
[2:02:08] Samson the Bible says out that same
[2:02:11] Jawbone he laid in was laid down he got
[2:02:15] thirsty he was just totally wiped
[2:02:20] out but God directed him to go pick it
[2:02:23] back up and God clave a hollow place in
[2:02:28] that jaw that's so good and out of there
[2:02:34] came forth water to refresh him
[2:02:37] Hallelujah the very same thing that
[2:02:40] brought the enemy down to their to their
[2:02:44] knees that that wiped them out became
[2:02:46] the very same Implement that God worked
[2:02:50] through to bring ref refreshing the
[2:02:53] Bible says his Spirit was revived it was
[2:02:59] renewed I believe I believe the word of
[2:03:02] God does that and not only do I believe
[2:03:04] it I know it
[2:03:06] works amen but sometimes I want you to
[2:03:09] listen to me sometimes as we go when we
[2:03:11] go through that sometimes within that
[2:03:14] we're our feelings we can seems like it
[2:03:16] seems like nothing's taking place and it
[2:03:18] don't seem like anything's happening but
[2:03:20] let me just tell you something don't
[2:03:22] turn loose of the word of God that's
[2:03:25] right amen because that word of God will
[2:03:28] see you
[2:03:29] through brother Bram tells us about a
[2:03:32] woman I didn't didn't read it to you but
[2:03:34] there's a there was a woman who she was
[2:03:37] her her husband own a big a big Factory
[2:03:40] there in
[2:03:42] Jeffersonville and she had a need in her
[2:03:45] body and and she came running to brother
[2:03:47] BR brother Bram I need you to pray for
[2:03:49] me so brother Bram prayed for her
[2:03:52] she said thank the Lord I I feel good
[2:03:55] she went on for a few days thank the
[2:03:57] Lord I feel so good and all of a sudden
[2:04:01] her surgeon called her because they were
[2:04:02] supposed to do a surgery and that
[2:04:04] surgeon told her said are you ready to
[2:04:07] come in for the surgery and she said
[2:04:10] well I I don't know I don't I I I think
[2:04:13] everything's everything's fine
[2:04:14] everything's
[2:04:16] okay brother BR said when that surgeon
[2:04:19] said okay then I'm not not going to do
[2:04:22] it and this is
[2:04:25] it somehow within that
[2:04:27] part something she had to have
[2:04:29] entertained her then a then a feeling
[2:04:32] came back to
[2:04:33] her she began to feel a little bit
[2:04:37] sick and when she then all of a sudden
[2:04:40] she she called and said hey go ahead do
[2:04:41] the surgery go ahead go ahead put me
[2:04:42] back on don't don't you know it was
[2:04:44] within the same time brother BR said
[2:04:47] when they went in there to do the
[2:04:49] surgery when they opened her up up it
[2:04:52] wasn't nothing to be
[2:04:54] found it was
[2:04:57] gone brother BR said what it was he said
[2:04:59] she just wasn't instructed on how to
[2:05:02] hold on to her
[2:05:05] healing you and I both know this that
[2:05:07] when all of a sudden when you're healed
[2:05:10] God touches you there's things that God
[2:05:13] can do for you even from what he did
[2:05:15] last Sunday whether it was in Physical
[2:05:17] Realm spiritual realm but you'll fight
[2:05:20] battles right after that is that right
[2:05:23] you'll fight battles right after that
[2:05:25] but let me just tell you something when
[2:05:27] after a person that God has come and
[2:05:30] brought healing that that the thing
[2:05:32] itself they may get sicker but it is no
[2:05:35] sign that they've not been
[2:05:38] healed are you hearing me
[2:05:41] now but that's the time to hold
[2:05:44] on that's a time that when all of a
[2:05:47] sudden maybe certain feelings and
[2:05:49] certain things come back but that's a
[2:05:50] Time to hold on right yes that's a time
[2:05:55] when just simply you don't have to
[2:05:56] explain everything but it might just
[2:05:58] simply be hey brother Dave will you pray
[2:06:00] with me
