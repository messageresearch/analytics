we are we just are so thankful to be in the house of the Lord this morning so thankful to be gathered with each and every one of you whether you're here or you're streaming and we just are so thankful for God's mercy and we just want to just turn our hearts to the word of the Lord and what the Lord would have for us this morning and just just looking to the Lord with such expectation we can see certainly within it there are things that we are indeed living in trouble sometimes if you happen to have forgotten in any way this world's not your home and it just becomes so so evident within it I'm grateful to God that there's a greater influence that's taken hold on our lives I'm telling you this this message I'm not gonna preach on this today this message is not the thoughts and ideas of a man in the opening of 1962 in the profit he's gonna preach the message influence he's out there I'm in the mark-up of Ally in Arizona and he makes this statement he says all he said if the people could realize no remember the the Angels have not even come in visitation yet but he says oh if the people could only recognize what has happened he said here this mighty one is coming oh if they could only recognize what he's going to do the whole opening of the seals is Christ taking the seals off himself it's him being unveiled to his children and you know that you know what that is to come fully to come under this word is to come fully under the influence of the Living God then we're thought to be awed boss not that we make ourselves odd it's not that at all but we're thought to be strange but you know the reality of it is but it's God so true when he's so moved in our lives like that then we realized this world is not my home I'm just passing through here we have that same urgency as us as it has a son daughter of Abraham as our Father Abraham had where he met Melchizedek and he begin looking for that city it's got to be around here somewhere hello clover feet of God don't you love the Lord oh I tell you God is so good we just want to just look into the word of the Lord first Peter chapter 2 verse 4 first Peter chapter two verse four and I just want to begin reading there to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men a chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones then look at this tying of a family a living stone he said a living stone precious and chosen of God and then it speaks to you and I as lively stones its Christ and his bride ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where and to all so they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people the reality of it is we didn't know we were we didn't know we were but he knew he and it takes him to make us aware of who we really are that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy I'd like by the help of the Lord to continue that thought stability in the midst of instability but I want to really lay up on this here this morning never ashamed never ashamed let's just bow our heads in the water prayer precious heavenly father Lord even during the time Lord of the prayer requests we've Lord know that it was mentioned for Lord unspoken requests that were upon the hearts of your children and these requests that are spoken and unspoken Oh God they are all opportunities for you to move Lord for you to make yourself known Lord in these situations and times as different ones Lord with Lord I'm going through of surgery and think of our sister surely Lord your God we want to remember her in prayer your God that you would just ministered to her Lord your God sister Suzanne keener Lord's he just Lord been dealing with that pain from her back and down through her leg Lord I know what that's like Lord God I asked that Lord that you would minister to her in a special way may the angel of the Lord just visit Lord their place right now Oh God may you just touch Lord in her back Oh God that discomfort Lord that would press upon that nerve and send that radiating feeling Lord that burning Lord crawled down the leg we ask in the name of Jesus Christ or God that you'll go to that need Lord for every other request Lord for every need every one of them are important Lord every one of them whether they're spoken or unspoken and Lord we're just lifting them all the Lord before your throne this morning for every heart for every life that's here we need you more we ask that you would just come Lord anoint us and may we move as one unit this morning a speaker and hear together we give ourselves to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless yous your being seated it's so good to see you in the house of the Lord and I'm sure by now we certainly don't mind mind any inconvenience that is through this trial that we've been in and and are in and it really calls us to put things in perspective but I want to deal with this thought this morning on and begin to see how far we get and looking at this on never ashamed these are things that it is that it may not mean too much to you but just want to let you know these things God dropped and brought weeks ago but these are things sometimes you know you you you sometimes your thought might look at something and think well and I believe I believe we're beyond that to even to where the enemy can come and say well you know this is being studied and this is being ministered but you know God knows what we have Nina there's God knows what we have need of there's however far in advance God wants to lay something out I've had that happened but just to see because sometimes we come into events in our week our weekly time and sometimes we're looking at that but I just say this to you God knows exactly all the events that will transpire all the tests everything that we will go through in a week or in a month or in a year and he prepares us to be able to face that battle so when we look at this in the scripture to take that thought and just ask that God will just help us to let it just resonate in our hearts never ashamed and I want to just draw from this in first Peter 2:6 or we read it says wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded that word confounded means to be Dishonored disgrace to put to shame make a shame to be ashamed blush with shame one is said to be put to shame who suffers repulse or whom some hope has been deceived we've not been deceived i'ma just say it in this part here we are and this is a really when this stone this which God has placed in our life it's the foundation a life cannot even begin to grow the virtues within a life temperance nullity can't even come out without a foundation otherwise it becomes as the Prophet said you're putting peacock feathers into a black bird you've got to have a proper foundation and there's no other foundation Paul would speak of that foundation and that foundation is not a doctrine it's not a belief it's the person of Jesus Christ the living stone the rock as David would refer to him he is our place of foundation of where we are resting and are anchored within this hour so when we find that if our foundation of what we're resting on in whom were resting in is in him then were never ashamed because every expectation is to be passed through him so when we come into this air in the scripture there's been things that I will just say it like this so maybe it'll help you to kind of begin to move along with me there's been times of things where we thought certain things and our thoughts did not translate out that way there's been certain things that we have believed and it didn't come the way that we had believed not don't let the enemy unsettle you on that John the Baptist was anointed by God speaking indeed concerning the Messiah and he's standing in the water and what John had spoken was exactly the Word of God and the unction by the prophecy but John had a different thought on what should be done by the Messiah and what was it that troubled him his thought was not the word where did he get his thought well he was looking at the word but you see he John John did not put it in a manner to say Lord if this is your thoughts okay you'll bring it to fast but just of my thoughts oh my I don't want it and but you see even as a believer God lets us see at times the humanity part I'm talking about the scriptures because this is what you and I deal with every day this is why I believe it's very important as the Prophet when he was speaking to just a group of ministers in taking sides with Jesus he was very clear I take it very personal and I this is a principle I've stood on not to put anything out to the church that is my ideas I'm talking about even if it's a collection of quotes you understand because that just brings troubling we're not we've god has not asked us to try to form or fit things or trying to figure out well I want to figure out what this is going on I want to figure good that's that's not what our calling is about not to get off on Thursdays services but a gift is not a knife where you cut your way into things a gift is to get yourself out of the way and every one of us we need that that that is where we need in our life god help us to get out of the way because even in our makeups and how we are sometimes where some could be more inclined this way some can be more inclined this way that's why we need the balance of the Holy Spirit that's why I think God I'm not resting in Samuel browning I'm resting in the stabilisers that's been put on the ship in Joel chapter 2 verse 23 this remember it not only speaks of God bringing back Zion the Bride of Christ into our homeland of the Holy Ghost but it also speaks of when God will gather that of the remnant so these they have a compound meaning verse 23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with oil and wine can you say amen to that that's exactly where we are in Christ and I will restore to you the years notice I will restore men can have a desire for it but remember like David you've got to follow God's proper channel for this restoration to come and he says I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cake Orem and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great army which I sent among you think of this here God is letting it be known this army that has come among you I have sinned it this totally takes away the minds of the people like oh my goodness you mean God would would send and permit evil yes just as much as you are I as a parent or are charged and commissioned by God to set boundaries for our children hello somebody to bring correction when it's when it's needed because if not where's it gonna be in the future come on somebody you see what you see in a literal word little form right now it just becomes a big reform if you allow them to have where there's no boundaries right now to where there's no you here you don't encroach on other people's face they'll keep on doing that this is a charge God's given us it's the same thing then you find them here in the floor and here they are is temper tantrums and whatever more when they get older they'll be throwing temper tantrums on their wife or their husband or this or that but it's in different forms it's all about still getting their way now that teaching of it doesn't give them the new birth the teaching is not the new birth but the teaching is necessary like Moses bringing them to the river and Joshua comes to take them over see they learn there's boundaries in God's word boundaries where others could not cross over that's free all of this what it comes down to is is that God as the Prophet would Express to us and the unfolding of God's character God's not a great big dodi grandfather where his kids can cram all around him and all over him and he sees no wrong that they're doing that's not God God he is not only and him being a God of love it's not just something where he comes down to embrace us he corrects us when we're wrong that's his love that comes to you and I that's not you see the concept of the world and the way everything is always gone it's so far from that they look at love just lets me do what I want to do get by with everything that's love that's not love and those who allow you to do it and call it love it's not love on their part this is I told a man the one time he's talking about Allah you know I went to school and you know they got on my kids and and I went to her and I just I tell you I just told him this and I told him that and I looked at mr. brother you know what your problem is your love is selfish you didn't even you didn't even go and consider what they were talking about and ask them and consider that your children I'm not even give you didn't consider that they themselves could indeed be doing something that's wrong don't worry it's nobody here you say how there could be a selfish because remember when you got to bring correction sometimes that can cause some feelings come on we've all been there I didn't feel real lovely when my dad and tan my hide he always told me I'm doing this you know this hurts me worse than you I didn't believe it didn't believe it it comes to this point see these principles they run within God's Word and God allows he has permitted this right here the locusts the canker him the caterpillar and the palm worm all to come and Bend and eat away this this tree clear down to the stump - what - the life which is the heart of the tree you see it shows that within this God has permitted this encroachment because they are not really holding the standard that God has required by his word I tell you there is no greater protection than a life that stays hidden in Christ brother Branham was very clear when he says if he says in the nation's he talked about in Sweden in different places when they had the wars he said when they had things like that going on they were praying and praying in the streets and praying he said telling you he said but once after a time that war got passed then he says you find things just start laying laxing back he says the same thing here in America we wouldn't even need bomb shelters he said if the people still were holding in prayer and looking to the Lord and listen brother branham ties it in here in in um jessabelle religion and he ties it in that there was a man clear back in the Latin Elena there was a late 20s I know his name I just can't think of it off the term in my head they hold a dinner with a memorial dinner that the presidential candidates are at every single time when an inauguration that man was a declared Catholic and brother Graham says that he said was trying to get in office back then he said but the Pentecostal people got together and they prayed and God heard their prayer let me just say this very clearly this nation is beyond redemption but why has God moving on the hearts of the Pentecostal people in that hour and it was God moving on them to pray and say God intervene we're not gonna go along with this we're not gonna accept this I don't care what this man can promise to do for us let me just say to you very clearly that right there is God moving because there was a message that had to be delivered here in this time there were people there were names that were on the book that he already redeemed but he needed to make Redemption real to you and I it is God that is at work he's been at work I mean just it and this is why that even in this time you can look and think why are we not gone already why are we not caught away already it's because they're still lives names whether on that book hallelujah they're still names that God is coming to make known redemption for come on now there's still young people to save and feel with the Holy Ghost amen there's still family members that need saving and feel with the Holy Ghost let me tell you something God is still in the saving business hallelujah he's still in the saving business as a parent let me just say to you like this has a parent stand steadfast in the word where the enemy could try to come and where you could have done that you should have done this you should have done that there's no parent that's perfect and anyone that thinks they are says they are you need that demon of pride cast off of you it's no we're not making allowance everything but where we know we know the ground that we're standing on we know what belongs to us hallelujah wow I didn't know that was all between 25 and 26 and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied are you satisfied this morning I'm satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel I love that and that I am the Lord your God and none else this is not for the nations this is not for the world out there you shall know that I am in your midst and I am the Lord your God you know that's an expression to sons and daughters of God that God loves to make himself known to hallelujah and we love we love for him to make himself known Lord Jesus we've invited you you don't got to go setting there you don't got to go set in the corner we've invited you in this service we want to welcome you we want to we want to kiss the son lest you be angry we want to wash your feet the hardened none else and my people shall never be ashamed think of this scriptures here as we said this is also prophetically speaking of the regather of Israel it's called moving sovereignly to put such a desire in their heart to go home it's called that orchestrating that when that of the bride is caught away in rapture and then that of Moses and Elijah moving there upon those two witnesses that are ordained and chosen by God there there that they're there to be made ready to put into action think of it that word let me just say it to me of that word at that moment they will preach the same baptism of the Holy Ghost to that of the hundred forty-four thousand it follows the same water for you and I in order for us to see him to meet him in the air you've got to have the token you've got to have the seal God would not allow anything to happen to Israel when the wound the wars were going on it won't the winds the right hold the winds until I have sealed my servants and God declares in the Book of Isaiah they shall know me they shall know my name that Jehovah of the old is jesus of the new so where the Prophet would pick up in the coming of the Lord in the opening of the church ages and say just as they have come to know his same power that makes them ready in preparation to look for him when he comes to reveal himself physically in crop preform to the Jews you see you would not know him in corporal form if you don't know him for who he really is who dwells behind the veil you see this is why it's important to know him then you'll recognize him no matter what veil he uses you'll recognize Jesus you come to know him in his same power his same nature is same characteristics what is it it's the God restoring everything that the enemy has eaten away and yet word comes in such a measure it comes in such a reality of the Living God till it causes the people of God to stand upon God's promise that is against every scientific ideal [Applause] my people shall never be ashamed God building a faith in the hearts of his children in this hour where we are believing change then are thought to be impossible my people shall never be ashamed God has sent to us a message that announced to us the rapture is on my people shall never be ashamed because we've met him we come to know him it went deeper than the veil that he was using whoo it's a clear expectation see the word it brick puts them into a clear expectation the same as it's doing for you and I now then let me read it some scriptures here in in in the Book of Psalms because they who put their trust in him will never be ashamed I'm gonna make this statement here before I read this first verse of psalm 62:5 our expectation must be from him and of him that means as as the Church of the Living God we're to recognize in this hour that there are things you might have feelings you might have dreams you might have everything itself is to be proven by God that doesn't mean doubting it but there's certain things just as things Roth had spoken to me I said Lord if that's you you bring it to pass it's the same thing with dreams sometimes I don't even know what he would God has dealt with me with in truth does it mean that God will continue I don't know that's up to God but the reality of it is I know I'm not trying to make anything out of it if there is something to be made out of it God will make it out that's what I found personally see this is where the whole parts of it that when he deals even with the nine spiritual gifts let it be proven before it's out before the church are you asked me we want to stabilize these things so psalm 62:5 we want our expectations must be from him and of him so here psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he has put in my heart when I'm expecting he's put it there these are not my ideas this is his thoughts my soul is waiting on hill or glory he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god he is an ever-present help in the time of trouble he's a refuge for us hallelujah I find this so striking here this is the very bank of scriptures that the Holy Spirit would direct the Prophet to read and preach the message to loan alleluiah this is a refuge because it told us in that message when he preaches that twice there's gonna be a lot of things he said going on and you get your eyes he said but keep your eyes lift up your eyes you're a speaking to the seeds and the sons and daughters of Abraham that like Abraham you've had a promise keep your eyes on the promised Abraham gonna miss Mount Moriah if he hadn't had his eyes lifted up Mount Moriah is God's grace provided for the sacrifice a man he is Jehovah Jireh enrapturing grace amen keep her eyes being looking to what God has shown to us and remember the Bible so and Abraham got there he solved that mountain it was not something he was trying to look missing he saw that Mount is something within him that it radiated brother Aaron it was the same way when the wind Amon came walking down the road that day and Here Come three men brother Bram said when Abraham being spiritual he knew there was something different about that man being spiritual you know there's something different about this message this message is not an addendum to moody or Calvin or Knox or cine or any other great men they're not taking nothing away from them but God sent a message in this hour [Applause] hallelujah a word that he has come and delivered and backed up and he's still backing it up [Applause] lets us know we've got a place of refuge verse 8 trust in him what's that say at all times it isn't always easy because of the circumstances but this is admonition trust in him at all times this ain't just talking about when times our home

and safety and what does it do it's trying to stabilize the world come on friends this is where it trust in him and all that this is not a scripture for just a valley this is at all times because the things that you and I know of look the things that we see those things are not eternal but that which is unseen is eternal that's why we've got to be tied so tied to him because there's a lot of things that are around us whether it sounds good or it sounds bad whether it looks good or it looks bad we've got to have our tie in him hallelujah it's as if this scripture applied even in the church you got to trust in him at all times even when it seems like things are going good or when there's things were the enemies trying to work and divide and then to all these other you gotta trust in him at all times this is a believer a believer a believer just doesn't come to church when everything's bad there some people don't even come when it's good now I'm not talking about right now during this

it didn't say get on Facebook and tell everybody your problems then going to edify and help the rest of the people well I'm just trying to st. help this is the scripture you want to scripture God to come on the scene you got to follow a scriptural order he's not the god of Twitter he's not the god of Facebook come on preach preach preach heed the God of Instagram he's the god of his word he's giving us prescriptions in his word God travels the path of his word his sin his message to messengers to clear that path that he's coming down you know and he says I'm coming down this path over there's boulders there's all kinds of objects in the way that are hindering I send my messenger to clear the way cuz I'm coming that way as though sealing up the eastern gates gonna keep out the Messiah as though the devil trying to seal your life with a lot of gloom trying to put a lot of condemnation trying to put a lot and point out your failures and your sin and your enemy James under there is nothing that can keep got back from fulfilling his word and when a heart is hungry enough that's a heart that's desiring for God to come in Alleluia trust in him at all times pour out your heart before him God is somebody is a refuge for us Psalm 64 10 the righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust in him the summon you don't know you're not reading what I'm reading you're not looking at what I'm looking at you as you remember Kaiser that's the problem it's what you're looking at it don't mean that the Syrian army ain't damn that they're the one gays - come on let's pretend this ain't here let's have real faith and pretend that's not faith but the hazeh look at it this is where it takes the leading of the Holy Spirit to be able to discern and know that God is an ever-present God devil can try to blow his hot breath come around brother Bram said with a spooky spirit he called him the big ol Goliath comes around with like a priestly you know it priestly he's offering things up it wants to offer up your failures he wants to offer up all the reasons why you can't stand but your sacrifice didn't change me I'm connected with the living sacrifice that changed my life that released on the inside who I really was the whole time hallelujah the righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall trust in him and all the upright and heart shall glory Nahum 1:7 the Lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him vivianne he knows where we're at on the meadow when him wouldn't great when great Momma Eagle takes us down there he knows where we're at I said he knows where you're at when you're on the job hallelujah he don't lose sight of your sister Rita he knows exactly where you're at he knows exactly the encroachments and the advancement of the enemy but his people are trusting he's on the scene I hope I can say this without anybody getting offended anybody taken his wrong way Jesus don't drop his children off at day care I hope nobody gets offended by that don't take it the wrong way I'm just trying to tell you he don't try to get you out of his hair he ain't he don't need somebody to take care of you he brought you forth he's big enough to take care of you hallelujah he sent us a rapturing message he's big enough jump back it up and to bring it to pass [Applause] hello that gives real stabilizing he's a stronghold and stronghold as a place of refuge but shame that was a place that the Philistines were David was in that garrison that struggled they couldn't get there David was in that stronghold it's a place of refuge God has given us a stronghold and that stronghold is in Christ remember before David ever had moved into that of Jerusalem he first built up Zion he built up the other strongholds that were fortification points coming to Jerusalem and God has prepared and built his church he knoweth them that trust in him Oh glory verse 8 o taste and see that the Lord is good you know Jesus so interesting you tasted here can he can sometimes even take it like an airplane come on now we'll be preached on Thursday he'll turn every stone he'll use every gift he'll use every channel use everything so that you and I might come to the realization of his love and that it's for you o taste and see that the Lord is good oh this is talking about more than just going around Costco and Sam's Club sampling this was talking about really taking it in blessed is the man that trusteth in him have me trusting in him oh you're blessed somebody says well how's this gonna come out I don't know this God's gonna bring it out how can you trust because it's not with these eyes that I'm looking through its these eyes right here well lay out the steps have alright I don't I don't have those steps to lay out I just know what he said in his word so when there's a step that's coming forth then I'm sure he's there to give me a little bit of inspiration to take that step notice blessed is the man that trust in him the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate Psalms 37 39 the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble and the Lord shall help and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him so we're talking about never ashamed talking about a balanced life I'm not gonna I hope I'm not going to read the quote to you again out of Christ revealed in his own word I've read it a few services where the stabilizers have been put on the ship and that whole point is so that the ship for those it's inside the ship we gave that example if this was the table and my drinks and dinner and whatever's on the table the stabilizers that are beneath the water I don't even know that they're moving I don't even mean the waves can be rocking and reeling up but those stabilizers that are beneath the surface of the water it allows that which is visible to remain steadfast so that we're not chasing our stake across the table and then chasing the officer Costello so we're not using this right here and we're not chasing this way you saying what are you saying that God stabilizes we're not trying to chase things down but I have to try to chase things down was stable you know what that New York that allows me to do rather Dave when we're stable it allows me to eat I know some of you're like yeah we got it you said you got that it allows me to do what I'm supposed to be doing it's not up to me to have that pump oh is that pump going does the pump recognize the wave well I wonder how this way or is this way how how much these orange arrows topically on these big cruise ships it's it's all things that are sensing even the waves how they're coming so that the people on the inside they're not in there worried huh who's gonna catch the wave oh this wave is so big great fearful waves but we're inside he serves all-you-can-eat sake I take another one medium-rare filet mignon go ahead put a second one on while I get the one you're gonna bring could I have a little bit more drawn butter yeah and limit for that lobster tail making you hungry and we need a little bit more rolls and some butter right here too you say brother Joey here's what's going on on the outside of the ship big waves big waves are rolling here we are on the inside can I have a little bit more this could I have a little bit more of this could I have a little bit more of this you don't say I'm brother Trevor could have a little bit more in this hey by the way I never will need a refill I gotta I need to wash this Lobster down it's getting look at it outside how in the world are you able to eat like that you ever had people tell you that man you don't know what's going on like if people have man I'd say I'm so tore up I can't eat boy I wish I had that problem I never been that tore up fix me in the opposite way when I get tore up I want to tear it up but here y'all in the midst of it and here we are but Dave what we're doing oh we're eating that spiritual food the tools and Ravens are dropping oh we got waiters all right we got waiters that provided for us just what we have needa there's a WaterBrook we're we're tapped into the Brutes shareit here we are we are just taking in and here we are while on the outside if you could look out the window and they had one of those buoys out there that thing would be popping and everything else was going on but here you are in the midst of it whoo bad storm out there but man this thing's good I don't know buddy check out on me right now I can't help Who I am if I had better examples and if you think I need something you need to pray for me I just have to be Who I am balance life it's a balance walk so we're not we're not walking like like this you know it's like they talked about with people with a pelvic tilt when all of a sudden they'll go to maybe kneel down or squat down things will go a certain way now how to balance right sometimes that out of balance those things can affect everything in your in your body you say when the world is having the snap and some bones back in place have to do with sinus infections your heads not connect not disconnected you don't take your head off at night put it on the dresser everything is connected the body is connected among the Church of the Living God everything is connected that's why you can't just have a bone out of place it's got to get back in place oh my goodness all this man it's a good Lord balanced life a balanced walk with God it takes the help of the Lord I'll tell you I said I take the help of the Lord because in our first birth it's imbalanced that birth come to imbalance everything what have you did it brought us away from being equal with God it brought us away from from that reflection of the image of God it threw us out of balance just as the earth was thrown out of balance in the days of Noah see so then it takes Claude to bring us back in balance back in line the earth will have its day but because the earth is out of balance right now and spinning at that 23 and 1/2 degree tilt God is going to bring it back up right what that's its original standing oh my god didn't mean for you to be bowed over like this as far as like knuckling down to the devil but in our hearts we submit to the Lord but in our hearts when we've submitted to the Lord the upright we just read trust in the Lord he brings us back into that place remember Esther came before the king but the Kings extended his golden scepter what wilt thou estra Alleluia ask according to the authority that's been vested in your life by the word you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will it shall be done balanced life balanced walk her the beginning to drive you look years ago and my dad was teaching me hey you know dad you know he like hey I don't want you running through every juggle then watch oh yeah don't put the brakes on when you come into a hole you know all those things yeah I understand that somehow that same vocabularies come out what I'm alluding to is that over time hitting them chuckles like that here throw a car out of line that car can still drive on the road but you ever seen them go down the road and they're going down the road and here they are like like this and then especially seeing them big vans you know like this you're like see you got to get in a certain position so it looks straight all out of line what did that continual heating of chuckles let me just say this you're not gonna be able to avoid every juggle especially if you live in a hurry it lightens you up a little bit you're gonna know your car's gonna have to go in for an alignment oh brother Samuel that's $70 unless you know you've got the skills like certain brothers have in the church but otherwise that $70 for alignment will save you a whole lot more of hundreds later on because when it's out of line it puts pressure on everything now I brother joy could come and give you a whole whole series on all this right here I'm not gonna try to go there but what I'm saying is is that we need all of us by the help of God a continual balancing sometimes we can get to look into things and we'll we'll go we'll go and if we keep going keep going and it's not checked pretty soon here we are we're going right down the road like this and for anybody to see us in the right way they've got to get turned in crooked too but the stabilizers have been put on the ship look another band says stay in the word these are the admonishments of the Holy Spirit to our life he didn't say try to figure it out he said just stay in it let God bring it all together but how I've encouraged you get in it stay in it listen to the message get into it ask God Lord reveal yourself to me read your Bible and pray pour your heart out before him see it's not to make ourselves on because any time when it becomes an idea and brother branham would use these kindest types of terms when we go to make ourselves odd we end up drawing ourselves out from everybody else and somehow another that spirit comes along and that spirit gets up on people that everybody's wrong except then then they go to separating and getting off to their self and the Prophet said that's exactly what the hounds of hell want to do I mean look at those lions and everything else when they come into a herd little an you know what I'm talking about they come among you know it's a big old group of them water buffalo it's enough to try to get one of them guys you know I mean they have to find and they look for a weak one then they try to do a tactic of spook the herd and when they spook the herd is somebody paying attention they'll get him isolated see the devil's tactic he wants to spook first try to bring fear and then get you off balance is to be balanced not tilting you know remember the old the fulcrum in the middle garlock's are just balance just weights right all this right here here comes down there's got to be we want our lives to be equal with the Word of God meaning that what the word says that's what we are that's what's being reflected and you know what the beautiful thing we don't have to try to manifest it it's who we are it's who we are it's like some of you right now if you haven't had it happen you just wait if God Terry's you get older there are certain things that I would poke fun at my dad about and this and that and now I just hear coming out of course I see a whole lot more my mom come on that's with her nothing wrong with that mom balance is to be balanced not tilting you know somebody's walking like this I remember one time some of you remember when I had a time a boy that went one part of my my back from my lower back it pulled me over like this and I was walking down I had to walk down the halls like this the one day it got so bad by the time the school went on it pulled down on this side through this leg that nerve just Oh and I'm walking like this I can't even hardly I can't sit down you know how it is you go to sit down it's like I'll just stand because if I go to sit down it's just it's the spasms or work you're out of line when you somebody walking like this something's not right something's not right so this is why Paul would say walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind never have a balanced walk with God so Lord you balance me out we need his help we need his help all of us do so rather than the balances that we would be in Lang with his word his thoughts his spirit we're in it is him stabilizing us and God has given us his word by his Spirit that we might stay stable so when they look at this here let me just go and begin just to just a few moments here to take us in look at look at something here in the word of hear a setting that we all could be very familiar with in second chronicles chapter 32 verse 1 the Bible says after these things the establishment thereof Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah and encamped against the fence cities and thought to win them for himself and when Hezekiah saw the Sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem he took counsel with his princess this is what has the kind did Pig saw that Sennacherib was purposed to fight against the city said what is that it's discernment I'm telling you brothers and sisters we need discernment Satan's a sly devil that's not glorifying here it's just saying let me just put you to this point but the RAM tells us in the first seal he said he can outdo any of us but he can't outdo the holy ghost this is what he did he saw the advancement of the enemy so he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city Hezekiah is one of the last Kings before they are carried away in exile here comes this advancement into the land he gathers his council princes of mighty men he says stop the waters of the fountains which are without the city and they did help him so there was Martin that was gathering much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water hezekiah saw the encroachment of the enemy when he saw it he called his captains and his princess which is bring a time he got together the Watchmen are you with me he got together the Watchmen and the Watchmen then there's a gathering of the people with what now what Hezekiah has saw perhaps the people could not see it but even if they did he wants them to be able to see it through God's eyes and so here's what they're gonna do they can't stop that of the kings of Assyria these advances that are coming this king is like he's over here in this land right now but he's sending he sent he sent and where I'm coming to you next Israel so he sends these people with messages I'm coming to get you next so he sees the advancement and brother Brian here's what he says cut off their water supply then come in the land but I don't have to entertain them the devil can send all kinds of thoughts but you don't have to entertainment all sorts of things can come your way you can cut off the water supply water is that of a source of life and refreshment you don't want to refresh the enemy's thoughts catch them out catch them out cut off the water supply what do you mean brother Samuel quit giving your time to the things of the world cut off the water supply where the devil's been saying this the devil's been doing this and this is being said and that's being said cut off the water supply I'm somebody no matter how how the devil comes you'll come to a person who's sick and tell them huh look are you feeling your body how long you been on this how long you been on this medication how long is this going on huh what should I do cut off the water supply sometimes cutting off the water supply means cutting the umbilical cord to Google preach brother send think a will last time I checked Google's not God [Applause] and I might be setting that brother Scott but I don't want to set brother Scott up but if I had something less and real question about ask brother Scott you say he's a he's a you know he's a podiatrist he's a an orthopedic or but he also remembered that's a specialist he knows all the other groundwork but even in that he'd get tired of me bugging him brother Scott what about my big toe brother Samuel now it's your big toe lastly was dumb this fella there's some news on this but there's gotta be get ready change his name to Luke they call me Paul [Laughter] amen amen but we want to cut off the water supply to the kings of Assyria cut it off let me just leave you with this and it would just stop here for sake of time this is a very important scripture and he strengthened himself this is what Hezekiah did he strengthened himself he's seen the enemy's advancement so he takes necessary action now what I'm going to read what I'm going to read here we have no account and second chronicles and second Kings and Isaiah 36 Isaiah 37 we have no account that God told him personally to do this what he's going to do but there are some things God's already told us you see friends this is where it comes being established in the word and we are to know the word if people say well I was sick nobody called me you didn't follow the scriptural order come on say a man the scripture says let them that are sick call for the elders of the church will you do kick that devil up cut cut off the waters of black nobody cares about me it had called me I was sick nobody brought me a chicken noodle soup that saltine crackers nobody nobody cares kick that devil now get out of here I'm a part of the body of Jesus Christ in whom the same black dwells that came down and moved upon my life get out of here you're not getting no more water look if you stand there as parched as a dog no more water this is Scripture if there be any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church remember we want God to be the god of the way then we have to follow the way for god to be the god of the world you're not getting no more water and you've tried to get me out of balance where I'm often my thinking nobody loves me nobody cares about me woo you need an alignment may not be high cutting it might be bone cracking he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken you know what this did it caused Hezekiah to reflect where are the areas of my life that had been broken see this is discernment he sees the enemy coming addresses what addresses cut off the water supply get the people together let's cut the water supply off so he cuts the water supply off but then now the word he stands there he knows who he is he says Lord what are the places in my life he's not listen in reality we know the areas that need to be built up listen friends even coming out of and here we are and you know lives are having to resume life's going on but as the Spirit of God has and I wouldn't believe just here I think all around there's no just hitting a resume button I'm gonna be just like I was before you're either gonna be closer to God or you're further away and that's a daily walk is your life for the gospel he says if we fail to walk and follow him daily not only the spiritual day but daily we take on an organizational life what does an organization or life do always looking behind but see he's not just the God who was behind us he's before us he's leading us somewhere so he saw the areas that needed to be built up maybe your prayer life needs to be build up build it up oh god I want you to come down and build on my prayer God he you know you and I both know what areas we let down we need to build those areas up why because we're surrounded like David said in Psalms 27th the Hinderer Hall shouldn't camp around about build up all the wall that was broken and it raised it up to the towers high that's a lot of working and another wall without I saw the enemy's advancements and he went into building and repairing you know if that shows brother Brian right in the midst of the enemy's advancement this is where here's the ship the ship's it's just staying stable here we are building up Lord I've been relaxing this Lord help me get built up see where our focus becomes is on him who is there to strengthen us and repaired meal in the City of David that's a strong and made darts and shields in abundance I just stopped here he's making preparation Shane he's not saying you're nothing to these Kings that ain't nothing to it no there's something to it there's something to this virus haha there's nothing to it let me just tell you a greater virus the same virus there's something to it something to it you see I'm not even going to move into this party today but there are statements that brother Brandon himself would make he says you have a cancer and you want to say oh it's not a cancer he said oh no it is a cancer but what's he doing he says but you must recognize that that God who is in you has already over comment you don't get anywhere with the enemy's advancements by trying to pretend it's not there that ain't faith faith is not pretend I want pretenders out there Joshua and Caleb never said yeah you all lying man there ain't no Giants or not a giant's there there's giants they balanced it they took this give me this these giants that are there but you know what you're not gonna sink us down we're gonna put the card right here and here it is to meet the enemy God's more than a match this is rockin with balance in our life what is it it's stability so when we're going down the road we're not like the van [Music] thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for his revealed word in this hour to keep us balanced aren't you grateful for that because all of us need that and that's what we're trusting in we'll just stop here may God help us each and every one no matter where you're at in your life or your walk but to understand there's a besieging the enemy is all around us more deadly than coronavirus and all that but we're besieged from the day you come out of your mother's womb you've been besieged and then it gets into a certain time in a life and the enemy makes an encroachment you can look in your life and say Lord this test or this trial what we're facing or what I'm facing right now what's before me what should I do first of all cut off the water supply I know I know they didn't have it like that before but they they cut it off so there's no water going out there first of all cut off the water source we're the same ability no I'm telling you to make his stay if it's a second if it's a minute if it's five minutes you make his stay uncomfortable I've been through some places and traveling I felt very uncomfortable felt very uncomfortable some places I've walked walked into before very odd please let me tell you something you know how you make the devil feel uncomfortable it's not but you've got to remember a chapter you've got to remember a quote you could just simply say lord I trust in you that will back the devil up he wants to come again chug another water stone right in there cutting off more water he's redeemed me yeah but you ain't never had pumps like this but he changed me look at you still claiming you're healing when He healed me cutting off his water supply let me tell you something you are anointed to be a serpent bruiser cut off that devil's water supply and when you cut off his water supply as you're doing that you build yourself up get the shield out maybe your shields got brittle you need to get it dipped or back down into the water so it'll quench them fiery darts you need to get it be need to get some monoi oil put up on that shield letter let's English that you need to get built up the Arsenal get prepared the areas that maybe has been torn down to God God give me grace to repair this give me grace to repair the areas that need to be repaired let me just tell you something like that that humility yet draws him on the scene God didn't build the wall form but he gave him the strength to do it to where they could focus on what they needed to focus on knowing that the enemy's advance was there but here they are making ready making ready may God help every one of us if you're not ready this morning this would be an awesome time to get ready this would be the right time to get ready it's the right time to strengthen ourselves let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord oh how we need you more Jesus Lord are you taking us in your word hearing it Mohnish tuss in our lives showing us O God and I believe you spoke Lord you're speaking to the very depths of our hearts God I pray that he has your grace is given right now Lord may every heart every life that we take lord the opportunity to strengthen ourselves Lord it's not in our own strength it's not in our own abilities what Hezekiah was doing would be equivalent would be just like as we would take the pathways of your word that we were looking at if there be any sick among us let him call for the elders of the church let him anoint him with oil if they've done any wrong any sin confess that God's from God's grace is forgiveness it stands but the prayer faith be made God shall raise him up [Music] Lord a life that's here maybe this morning that they know they need to be strengthened there's also in your word it's two things Lord when you call a life to yourself that as an individual we must do two things we must do we must repent and we must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you're the one who comes and does what no man can do you're the one who comes and caps off our life father I think of here in the scriptures we see these things may we in Lord humility may our focus upon every one of us here this morning Lord where we can look and see walls that need to be repaired or [Music] letting down in certain areas in those wall walls a protection that of the word let it be built back up may we take that you're not gonna do that for us you won't pray for us you're gonna read our Bible for us you won't listen to messages for us this is what we this is what we do but Lord we give ourselves to you that's part of the scripture pour out your heart before God lay our hearts open before you because you are a refuge you're our refuge Lord I pray this morning if there's one that's out from under the protection of the blood of Jesus Christ if they're out from under that blood said I pray this morning God if they don't recognize it the Lord help them to see that the encroachments and advancements and the besiegement of hell is all around us your prophet as he sat there in that JC Penney store it came back to him [Music] from when he was just a boy and he almost died here he wasn't he was going to hell falling down through that blackness there was no place to catch him he said at that time all the awfulest moaning and groaning and he saw those women their painted face [Music] Lord all of that as we see that paint even in the natural science even says it produces cancer you are not you are not to give something to us that would harm us but it's even something Lord to where it's it all even speaks into the spirits is it's a covering is to try to make a person tries to make themselves something Lord God if there's any Lord spiritually that are painted up Lord may they let that may they let it go then they say Lord I'm not gonna pretend no longer I'm not gonna put on no longer I'm not gonna act a part no longer I want to be the one who can come and act and live through me lordy sit there in that JC Penney store [Music] believe it in nineteen sixty three sixty-five one of those times and he spoke and he's hearing that same thing going on when those women got off of that elevator and he says there were those women I saw in him [Music] or did to me it speaks this is an hour we don't have to put anything on its that's a deadly time we
