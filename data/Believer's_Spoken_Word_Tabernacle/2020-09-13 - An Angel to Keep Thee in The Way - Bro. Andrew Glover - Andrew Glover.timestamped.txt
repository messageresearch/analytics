[35:08] amen it's just such a wonderful and
[35:10] awesome time and
[35:12] out there no it's not it's a terrible

[35:17] grandest time to ever be living
[35:20] it's the greatest hour amen oh the the
[35:23] hour for the bride of jesus christ it's
[35:25] not going to get worse it's only going
[35:26] to get greater
[35:28] amen greater and greater and greater
[35:31] and i'm just so thankful for god's grace
[35:33] in this hour his mercy
[35:35] amen and you know when we look at that
[35:37] in in this song that we're singing
[35:39] brother branham would tell us it's so
[35:40] fitting he would say it like this and
[35:42] it's the rising of the sun he said that
[35:44] little eagle that was down there in that
[35:45] barnyard he needed to hear more than
[35:48] just stories about an eagle
[35:51] he needed to see
[35:53] one
[35:55] that was just like him
[35:58] and that's what we need to see
[36:01] we really can catch a hold of that of
[36:03] what this message is it's jesus christ
[36:06] revealed to our hearts
[36:10] this is not doctrine it's not theology
[36:12] it's it's not just teaching this is
[36:15] jesus christ revealed in power and glory
[36:20] and it reveals to us of who we really
[36:22] are
[36:23] amen we're on our way back home
[36:26] we've met our melchizedek
[36:29] amen we're going home
[36:32] amen
[36:33] glory be to god so let's just pull on
[36:35] the gift of god the service this morning
[36:38] and then the lord willing here again
[36:39] once again tonight at six o'clock and i
[36:41] can tell you one word that just has been
[36:44] moving on my heart even as we were just
[36:46] meditating on some things yesterday is
[36:48] the word investment and you know we
[36:51] there's there's things that sometimes uh
[36:54] as individuals we can or people can
[36:56] invest in and whatever you invest in is
[36:59] what you esteem to be a value
[37:01] you know sometimes a person will give
[37:03] their money and invest and they'll
[37:04] invest in this
[37:06] certain thing maybe it's something they
[37:07] buy for their house or whatever you have
[37:10] if you have a fixed a value that that
[37:12] was worth all of that money all of your
[37:15] blood all your sweat and everything that
[37:17] went in to obtain that there's an
[37:19] investment you made there's a part of it
[37:21] and i think that all of those things
[37:23] that you and i know of that many times
[37:25] they they are precious to us but there's
[37:27] something that is so far greater and
[37:29] that is eternal life there's something
[37:32] that's so much greater and that is what
[37:34] god is doing amongst his people and what
[37:37] what is added to our life there's an
[37:39] investment and i believe this morning
[37:41] i'm talking to
[37:43] wise investors
[37:45] i don't believe i'm talking to people
[37:46] that just you know like they say the
[37:48] money burning a hole in your pocket i
[37:50] believe i'm talking to people this
[37:51] morning that you have a wise investment
[37:54] and i say this morning and throughout
[37:56] this day let's so invest ourselves and
[38:00] just in prayer even while the word's
[38:02] coming forth and then throughout this
[38:03] day let's just pour ourselves into this
[38:06] and say god you pour yourself into me
[38:08] lord
[38:09] we've got needs here there's needs right
[38:12] here among us and there's not one person
[38:14] that doesn't have a need but i'm
[38:16] grateful that there is a living god
[38:18] that's here among us the only true and
[38:20] wise living god

[38:25] than all of our needs

[38:32] sister moriah glad to have them here

[38:36] morning god has put that gift in that
[38:38] life that he might come down and use and
[38:40] that it might minister to you and i
[38:43] let's pull on that gift

[43:18] god speaking this morning and he was
[43:20] talking about the
[43:22] power of a believer hearing from god and
[43:24] he said when you hear from god nothing
[43:25] will shake you from what you've heard
[43:27] from him
[43:28] what amazed me was he said if the lord
[43:30] spoke to me and told me it was going to
[43:31] rain
[43:32] he said i wouldn't have no problem
[43:33] getting an umbrella and walking out even
[43:35] though the sun was shining and i began
[43:38] to think about that of how that when you
[43:39] hear from god amen nothing
[43:42] past present or future will shake you
[43:44] from what you heard from him so it may
[43:46] not look like it's possible to get a
[43:48] deliverance this morning or possible to
[43:49] get a healing but if he spoke to you all
[43:52] things are possible to them that believe
[43:54] this morning how many believers do we
[43:55] have here today
[43:57] amen let's just buy our heads together

[46:55] here in the book of exodus the 23rd
[46:56] chapter
[46:58] how many has come to have church today
[47:01] amen i tell you i believe the spirit of
[47:02] the lord is among us amen
[47:04] in the book of exodus the 23rd chapter
[47:07] i want to look in the 20th verse
[47:10] exodus 23
[47:12] and verse 20.
[47:15] i've been studying here some time on the
[47:18] voice and
[47:19] of god and as you go through the message
[47:21] of the hour studying on the voice it
[47:23] amazes me how many sermons brother
[47:25] ramtis back to exodus 23
[47:28] in exodus 23 verse 20 the bible here
[47:30] says
[47:31] behold i send an angel
[47:34] before thee notice not behind thee
[47:37] but before thee
[47:38] so the angel is going to lead you
[47:41] to keep me in the way and to bring me
[47:43] into the place which i prepared
[47:45] beware of him and obey his voice
[47:48] provoke him not
[47:50] for he will not pardon your
[47:51] transgressions
[47:53] for my name is in him
[47:55] but thou shalt indeed what obey his
[47:58] voice
[47:59] and do all that i speak
[48:01] then i will be an enemy unto thine
[48:03] enemies and an adversary unto thine
[48:05] adversaries
[48:06] from an angel shall go before thee isn't
[48:08] it amazing the angels going before them
[48:11] shall go before thee and bring me into
[48:14] the amorites now notice here
[48:16] you would think if the angel the lord
[48:17] was in front of you leading you he would
[48:19] lead you away from the enemy but he
[48:22] leads him right to the enemy
[48:24] unto the amorites and to the hittites
[48:26] under the perizzites into the canaanites
[48:28] the harvards the jebusites
[48:31] and i will cut them off
[48:33] thou shalt not bow down to their gods
[48:35] nor serve
[48:37] them nor do after their works but thou
[48:39] shalt utterly overthrow them
[48:41] and quite break down their images and ye
[48:44] shall serve the lord your god and ye
[48:46] shall bless and he shall bless thy bread
[48:49] and thy water and i love this and i will
[48:52] take sickness away
[48:54] from the midst of thee
[48:56] i will take sickness away from the midst
[48:59] of thee we ask the lord this morning to
[49:01] add the blessing
[49:02] to the reading of his word as you may
[49:03] have your seats here
[49:05] for just a few moments this morning i
[49:07] want to by the help of the lord to speak
[49:09] to you here out of this scripture and
[49:11] some time ago i was actually we were
[49:13] here on a thursday night and we left
[49:15] here and went over to brother
[49:17] jim schumacher for some meetings there
[49:18] with them and i was studying there in
[49:20] hebrews chapter 12 and it's amazing how
[49:23] that one little word or one little
[49:26] scripture will open up so much to you
[49:28] and as i was studying there in hebrews
[49:30] 12 the bible there paul speaking said
[49:32] see
[49:32] that you refuse not him that speaketh
[49:34] and i've just been uh studying here some
[49:36] time on the voice of god but this
[49:38] morning i want to take another portion
[49:40] of this out of exodus 23 maybe not so
[49:42] much the voice but i want to speak to
[49:44] you on an angel to keep me in the way an
[49:47] angel to keep me in the way and there
[49:49] the bible says amen that god would send
[49:51] an angel before them and they shall obey
[49:54] his voice now we know it's important to
[49:55] do three things it's important to
[49:57] receive the voice of god it's important
[50:00] to believe the voice of god amen but
[50:02] it's also important to obey the voice of
[50:05] god there's many that will receive it
[50:06] there's many that will believe it amen
[50:09] but where the real battle comes is when
[50:10] it becomes time to obey what the voice
[50:13] is said amen and the voice of god is in
[50:15] that angel now we know that all bible
[50:18] believers believe in angels can you say
[50:20] man all
[50:21] scriptural bible believers this morning
[50:23] believe in angels and i i think of how
[50:25] that when we begin to speak of angels we
[50:27] should be aware amen that even right
[50:29] here this morning there are angels in
[50:31] our midst right here in this building
[50:33] this morning though you may not be able
[50:34] to see them though you may not even be
[50:36] able to feel them amen there's angels in
[50:39] this building this morning now the bible
[50:41] says in hebrews 13 2 be not forgetful to
[50:44] entertain strangers amen for thereby
[50:46] some have entertained angels unawares i
[50:49] i think of how abraham there in the
[50:51] bible amen just laying the foundation
[50:54] here he actually entertained amen the
[50:56] angel of the lord abraham entertained
[50:59] the angel of the lord now brother says
[51:00] it this way amen in a message of super
[51:02] sign he said i received some mighty fine
[51:04] christmas presents a movie camera many
[51:07] other things guns and things that people
[51:09] love me they give me how i appreciate
[51:11] that but all this eternal life this
[51:13] blessed assurance that christ lives in
[51:15] us that his fullness dwells within us
[51:18] and makes us rise and act different he
[51:20] said because when you do that you become
[51:22] a fugitive to the things of the world
[51:25] you become a pilgrim you reckon yourself
[51:27] dead to the things of the world and
[51:29] alive in a new life now you're an alien
[51:32] in the world you're an alien because you
[51:35] have professed plainly by your action
[51:37] that there is a city whose builder and
[51:39] maker is god see and you no longer care
[51:42] for these things of the world he said
[51:45] but we're a heaven-bound people looking
[51:47] for a city amen who's builder and maker
[51:50] as god we are abraham's seat because we
[51:53] have believed on the lord jesus christ
[51:55] and have died to the things of this
[51:57] world and have been raised in the
[51:58] resurrection of his likeness he said to
[52:00] walk as abraham did amen seeking a city
[52:03] to come talking god taking god's word
[52:05] calling everything else contrary amen to
[52:08] entertain angels in our home amen like
[52:11] abraham did the messengers of god that
[52:13] brought the message oh what a time amen
[52:16] professing that we don't want no more of
[52:18] the world we want him and him alone amen
[52:21] he is our savior amen then what that
[52:24] tells me is in the last days amen
[52:26] there's going to be another people on
[52:28] the earth amen that's going to receive a
[52:31] message but that message is not going to
[52:33] come ain't meant to tell them get
[52:35] comfortable where you're at and get more
[52:37] relaxed react but that message is going
[52:39] to come and it's going to remind them
[52:41] amen that there is still a heaven amen
[52:44] there is still a city whose builder and
[52:46] maker is god and i just want to take a
[52:48] minute in here and tell you this morning
[52:49] there's a lot going on in this world
[52:51] amen there's a lot of shaking there's a
[52:53] lot of variety there's a lot of
[52:55] confusion amen but there is a people
[52:57] here this morning amen that is not
[52:59] shaken amen they are not moved amen they
[53:02] are not nervous because they have
[53:04] received a message from an angel amen
[53:06] that said there's still a land amen
[53:09] beyond the river i don't know about you
[53:11] amen if all we had was this world this
[53:13] morning we've got every ride ain't meant
[53:15] to sit here defeated if all we had was
[53:17] the future of the political system we've
[53:20] got every right to be defeated this
[53:21] morning but we received a message they
[53:24] meant to come with a capstone revelation
[53:26] that there is a future home amen and
[53:29] somebody's going to go to i don't know
[53:31] about you but i feel the angels of god
[53:33] here this morning reminding me get your
[53:36] eyes off the things of this world get
[53:38] your eyes off the democrats get your
[53:41] eyes off the republican and get your
[53:43] eyes back on the land amen that is
[53:46] flowing with milk and honey get your
[53:48] eyes back on the land where the streets
[53:50] are paved the gold and the walls are
[53:52] jasper hey this is not my home amen i
[53:56] didn't come to stay here we're going to
[53:58] leave here church don't you forget that
[54:01] no matter how dark the night gets no
[54:03] matter how cold the trial comes we're
[54:05] going to leave here one of these
[54:07] mornings because god should an angel
[54:09] amen to lead us out of here amen we do
[54:12] not believe in the worship of angels but
[54:14] we do believe in the ministry of angels
[54:17] the bible says in matthew 18 10 take
[54:20] heed that you despise amen not one of
[54:22] these little ones for i say unto you
[54:25] that in heaven amen there's angels to
[54:28] always behold the face of my father
[54:30] which is in heaven amen there is angels
[54:33] in heaven amen there is angels on the
[54:35] earth now notice here he said you see
[54:37] when i speak of an angel i do not mean
[54:39] the worship of an angel does everyone
[54:42] understand that no you don't worship an
[54:44] angel you worship god see not an angel
[54:47] but it's the ministry of angels amen
[54:49] amen in this morning church we are under
[54:52] the ministry of angels i believe that
[54:55] the angels of god they watch over us
[54:58] amen i believe that jesus said there is
[55:01] angels always behold the face of my
[55:04] father which is in heaven amen the
[55:06] prophet of god said the ministry of
[55:07] angels amen was in the old testament he
[55:10] said it was in the new testament as well
[55:13] amen that god would send angels in the
[55:15] message what is the holy ghost given for
[55:17] now in this age that we're now living
[55:19] this age is beyond pentecost pentecost
[55:22] settled itself in organizations and
[55:24] started taking a whole lot of
[55:26] organizations amen but we are this and
[55:28] we are that that's just nature he said
[55:30] see but the church has moved on it's
[55:32] gotten into greater more powerful it's
[55:34] the restoration of the guests and many
[55:37] people amen many pentecostal people does
[55:40] not believe in divine healing he said
[55:42] they don't believe in the ministry of
[55:44] angels and the powers of god amen see
[55:47] why god had to call it pride out of that
[55:49] amen because when it was in the
[55:51] beginning amen he'll be in the end and
[55:54] whatever denies what he was in the
[55:56] beginning will be dismissed from him but
[55:58] there'll be a pride that'll come out of
[56:00] that confusion and they'll stand i feel
[56:03] like preaching here and they'll stand in
[56:05] the middle of a god-denying world in the
[56:08] middle of the supernatural divine world
[56:10] and they'll still say i believe in
[56:12] angels amen i'll tell you this morning
[56:14] church there's some people here today
[56:16] you can call us crazy you can call us
[56:18] fanatics you can call us holy rollers
[56:21] but we're not a part of that nonsense
[56:23] amen god called us out that we could
[56:26] stand not upon the rock of gibraltar but
[56:28] upon the rock of ages and declare we
[56:31] still believe in the supernatural
[56:34] elements of the living god in this
[56:36] generation
[56:38] i'm not ashamed of a church not ashamed
[56:41] of my supernatural beliefs i'm not
[56:43] ashamed to stand and say that god still
[56:46] heals the sick i'm not ashamed to stand
[56:48] and say that god still cast out devils
[56:51] i'm not ashamed to stand and say that
[56:53] god still feels with the holy ghost can
[56:56] i tell you something else i'm not
[56:57] ashamed i'm not ashamed to stand and say
[57:00] that god sent a man in this generation
[57:03] by the name of him
[57:04] with a message i'm not ashamed to stand
[57:07] and say seven angels picked him up and
[57:10] revealed the health i'm not ashamed amen
[57:13] to say the same pill of fire amen that
[57:16] led moses and then paul is here leading
[57:18] the church this morning oh let me shout
[57:21] it with everything within me i am not
[57:24] ashamed of the supernatural element of
[57:26] jesus christ
[57:29] oh we've got a lot of people that's
[57:31] ashamed of it amen they want us to get
[57:33] quiet they want us to get formal amen
[57:35] they want us to get real real real
[57:37] traditional amen but let me just go
[57:39] ahead and preach to you this morning i'm
[57:40] not getting that way
[57:42] i'm not ashamed
[57:43] amen i'm not to say i believe god still
[57:45] speaks in tongues yes sir
[57:48] i believe god still feels with the holy
[57:50] ghost i believe god amen still dances in
[57:53] the spirit
[57:55] i believe god still does everything that
[57:57] he did in the book of acts he is still
[58:00] doing here this morning let me say it
[58:02] again i am not ashamed to be in the
[58:05] bright
[58:06] age i am not ashamed they meant to be
[58:09] preaching under the pride anointing i am
[58:12] not ashamed they meant to be walking in
[58:14] the bride like oh this ain't
[58:16] denominational light this is messiah
[58:19] light this is bright light they didn't
[58:21] come to leave us where we're at but it
[58:23] come to take us work on or dang for us
[58:26] to go
[58:27] ah it's all coming forth of the holy
[58:29] spirit he said to this great church is
[58:32] being filled up and chugged
[58:34] full hallelujah of the great powers of
[58:38] almighty god until it's got to a place
[58:41] until the very works that jesus done has
[58:44] manifested itself right here in the
[58:47] church now amen friends what god done
[58:50] then is what's being manifested now
[58:54] and there ain't no devil can stop it i
[58:57] ain't no demon combined there ain't no
[58:59] unbelieving spirits that can stop the
[59:02] ministry of angels in this generation
[59:06] oh what is an angel believe says an
[59:09] angel is a servant he said is that all
[59:11] right he said they are his servants
[59:13] another place he would say what is an
[59:15] angel an angel is a messenger he said
[59:17] get your dictionary you'll find angel
[59:19] means a messenger some of them are
[59:21] heavenly messengers amen some of them
[59:23] are earthly messengers amen that god
[59:26] dwells in to bring his earthly message
[59:29] then the angel is not god amen but god
[59:32] is him the angel amen amen the angel is
[59:35] not god amen but god is failed in the
[59:38] angel he said in those messengers angels
[59:41] of the lord amen they're messengers to
[59:43] you and they're standing there with
[59:46] their hands out to obey what god has to
[59:49] say amen another place he would say
[59:51] notice now when anything is going to
[59:53] happen on earth amen then first god will
[59:56] send a messenger and that messenger is
[59:58] anointed by an angel he said now there's
[1:00:00] minor angels and there's major angels he
[1:00:03] said now sometimes he said like gabriel
[1:00:05] who is a major angel he said when he
[1:00:07] comes something major is getting ready
[1:00:09] to happen he said gabriel come from
[1:00:11] heaven and announce the first coming of
[1:00:13] jesus and gabriel will announce the
[1:00:15] second coming amen i want you to catch
[1:00:17] something here that angels true angels
[1:00:20] amen do not move upon their own accord
[1:00:22] amen but they are sent by god
[1:00:26] then what they're doing is they're being
[1:00:28] sent forth from the presence of god
[1:00:30] exodus 23 verse 20 said notice behold i
[1:00:33] amen which is god will do what will send
[1:00:36] amen an angel before thee amen see now
[1:00:40] look here remember it says the word we
[1:00:41] have just read was god said to moses he
[1:00:43] said the people were there in bondage he
[1:00:45] said just like today we're in the last
[1:00:47] days and he promised that these signs
[1:00:49] and wonders would be done in the last
[1:00:51] day
[1:00:53] he said so god raised up a man by the
[1:00:55] name of moses had he born in the world
[1:00:57] for a specific purpose he said moses
[1:00:59] never performed one miracle it was the
[1:01:02] angel of god that went before moses it
[1:01:05] was a pillar of fire at night in a cloud
[1:01:08] by day even see god delivered the
[1:01:11] children of israel when they were in
[1:01:12] bondage and they couldn't help
[1:01:14] themselves he said and today god's
[1:01:16] people are not in bondage spiritually
[1:01:18] for they're delivered by the power of
[1:01:20] the holy spirit no man has to stay in
[1:01:23] bondage of sin any longer because the
[1:01:26] holy spirit will bring him from bondage
[1:01:29] amen of sin now notice here but the
[1:01:32] people as children are sick and needy
[1:01:34] and some of them are cancer ridden and
[1:01:36] tubercular and heart trouble our beloved
[1:01:38] doctors of this earth can find no remedy
[1:01:40] for and it's multiplying it's getting
[1:01:42] greater and greater all the time they
[1:01:44] meant sickness is heaping greater and
[1:01:46] greater and some of them things that the
[1:01:48] doctors know not how to control and the
[1:01:50] people have cried since chile for years
[1:01:52] and years amen for god to restore the
[1:01:54] church again amen his gifts and signs
[1:01:57] and wonders i guess there's a hundred
[1:01:58] here tonight let's pray that prayer well
[1:02:01] when the children of israel of god began
[1:02:03] to cry down in egypt god sent them down
[1:02:05] a deliverer and vindicated this
[1:02:08] deliverer by signs and wonders don't you
[1:02:10] think god amen could do that tonight
[1:02:13] just the same
[1:02:15] are you hearing me amen if god could do
[1:02:17] it for israel amen then god can do it
[1:02:19] this morning amen if god could hear the
[1:02:22] cries of two million people amen and say
[1:02:25] i am come down amen to deliver my people
[1:02:28] and i believe here this morning if we'll
[1:02:30] begin to cry unto god in the same god
[1:02:33] amen that delivered israel will come in
[1:02:36] this building this morning and will
[1:02:38] deliver his people
[1:02:40] yes sir if you're sick amen and can't
[1:02:42] get well and the doctor can't help you
[1:02:45] don't you think your father is here for
[1:02:47] you and can he send gifts he said now he
[1:02:49] did then and i believe he's just the
[1:02:52] same today he always makes a way
[1:02:55] anybody a witness here today that god
[1:02:58] always makes a way when there seems to
[1:03:00] be no way when there is no way possible
[1:03:03] somehow or another god comes down and he
[1:03:06] makes a way
[1:03:08] now what amazes me is how israel was in
[1:03:11] bondage they were sick they were being
[1:03:14] beaten they were slains they were being
[1:03:16] tormented they were being oppressed all
[1:03:18] this around them and they're praying
[1:03:20] asking god amen for a deliverer he meant
[1:03:24] to deliver them out of that condition
[1:03:26] and here comes a man named moses and
[1:03:28] they look at him but because he didn't
[1:03:30] come the way they thought he would come
[1:03:32] then they missed him but he would stand
[1:03:34] there and say this way i am the answer
[1:03:37] to your prayers amen moses could stand
[1:03:39] there and say what you've been praying
[1:03:41] for quit praying and start rejoicing
[1:03:44] because what you've been praying for is
[1:03:46] now standing before you in fulfillment
[1:03:49] then a prophet would bring that to this
[1:03:51] day and say there's hundreds of
[1:03:53] cancer-ridden and tuberculosis cases and
[1:03:56] people's been praying for years that
[1:03:58] somewhere somebody would pick up the
[1:04:00] bible and would believe that god is
[1:04:02] still god and his word is still the word
[1:04:05] and he can still heal and a prophet is
[1:04:07] standing before them and saying what
[1:04:09] you've been praying for is before you
[1:04:11] tonight amen can i bring back to today
[1:04:14] amen what you've been praying for what
[1:04:17] you've been asking god for it's not

[1:16:03] i pray this morning i know this may be
[1:16:06] as simple as simple can be but i pray

[1:16:16] would raise up and say give me my
[1:16:18] mountain
[1:16:23] yes sir god amen always had ministering
[1:16:27] spirits
[1:16:28] i believe in them
[1:16:30] i believe
[1:16:31] in the ministering spirits sent from the
[1:16:34] presence of god
[1:16:36] the holy spirit
[1:16:37] ministers
[1:16:40] lead the church
[1:16:42] guardian angels

[1:16:51] guardian
[1:16:52] angels
[1:16:54] guardian
[1:16:56] angels
[1:16:57] that watches over us
[1:17:00] see that's why i got to praise god
[1:17:04] it's because i know
[1:17:05] if it wasn't for him i wouldn't be here
[1:17:11] [Applause]
[1:17:14] now people tighten up on that well he's
[1:17:15] going to get pentecostal that you're

[1:17:20] because the ones you're worried about
[1:17:22] ain't protected you know
[1:17:25] the ones you're worried about haven't
[1:17:27] provided for you
[1:17:29] the reason why you're here this morning
[1:17:31] is because god sent a guardian angel
[1:17:36] come on church when moses got down there
[1:17:39] in egypt and realized that he swam down
[1:17:42] a snake and crocodile infested river
[1:17:45] you better believe he's going to give
[1:17:47] god some praise you know why because he
[1:17:50] had ever right to be dead he had every
[1:17:53] excuse not to be there but god sent an
[1:17:56] angel
[1:17:58] god sent an angel and he went through
[1:18:00] crocodile rivers and the promise of god
[1:18:02] said that and then an old crocodile
[1:18:05] would get real hungry and he would sneak
[1:18:07] up there in the basket and he said he
[1:18:08] would smell that and he would say man
[1:18:10] that smells like a good meal but you
[1:18:12] know what i believe i believe with that
[1:18:14] angel when that when that crocodile put
[1:18:16] his nose against that basket i believe
[1:18:18] there was an angel there that touched
[1:18:20] that nose and said back up there's a
[1:18:22] condition on him
[1:18:24] back up he was born for a specific
[1:18:26] purpose well hear me this morning church
[1:18:29] come on church even some of you know you
[1:18:32] shouldn't be sitting here this morning
[1:18:33] you should have died in your past life
[1:18:36] you shouldn't be alive this morning the
[1:18:38] devil should have got you even hail
[1:18:40] should have consumed you but there was
[1:18:42] an angel
[1:18:45] there was an angel around you and when
[1:18:48] the day will come in to sniff your life
[1:18:50] when the devil come in to take your
[1:18:52] testimony there was an angel that
[1:18:55] smacked him on the nose and said i'm
[1:18:57] reserving them for a bright age
[1:19:01] for a rapture

[1:19:24] testimony there's an angel
[1:19:30] there's an angel watching you when you
[1:19:33] was in college and some old liberal
[1:19:35] theologian some old liberal philosopher
[1:19:37] tried to talk the power of god out of
[1:19:39] you there was an angel there that
[1:19:41] touched that doctrine on the nose and
[1:19:43] said back up that's a manifested son of
[1:19:46] god
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:53] i feel angels in here this morning you
[1:19:55] say by the end why are you feeling
[1:19:57] lighter because i feel demons backing up
[1:20:04] an angel here
[1:20:05] ah brother andrew there's only a
[1:20:08] guardian angel for the preacher there's
[1:20:10] only a guardian angel a guardian angel
[1:20:11] for the deacon well then there's only a
[1:20:13] guardian angel for the prophet well let
[1:20:15] me tell you what the prophet said
[1:20:16] everyone has a guardian angel
[1:20:23] according to
[1:20:24] the scripture
[1:20:26] ah now before god sends a message to the
[1:20:28] earth god sends angels sometimes as
[1:20:31] messengers to the earth to bring his
[1:20:33] message do you believe that
[1:20:36] do you believe god sends angels
[1:20:38] and let's look through the scriptures
[1:20:40] here real quick at the ministry of
[1:20:42] angels amen in genesis 16 7. i'm just
[1:20:44] going to read these quickly the angel
[1:20:46] lord found hagar found her by a fountain
[1:20:48] of water and told her to return to syria
[1:20:52] and submit herself into her under her
[1:20:54] hands now we know hagar is not our type
[1:20:57] but i want you to notice something the
[1:20:59] angel of the lord knew where hagar was
[1:21:04] do you realize in genesis 19 15 that the
[1:21:06] angels of the lord hasten lot and center
[1:21:09] eyes amen take my wife and my two
[1:21:12] daughters which are here let's thou be
[1:21:14] consumed in the iniquity of the city and
[1:21:17] escape for that life
[1:21:20] god sent an angels to lot and tap lot on
[1:21:23] the shoulder and said launch you better
[1:21:25] get up and get out of here
[1:21:27] are you catching it in genesis 22 11 do
[1:21:30] you realize abraham took isaac upon the
[1:21:32] mountain what did he go up there to do
[1:21:34] to offer him you realize there was an
[1:21:36] angel appeared amen
[1:21:38] and called unto abraham and said abraham
[1:21:41] stay thy hand
[1:21:44] right before he slew isaac had abraham
[1:21:48] not heard and obeyed the voice of god he
[1:21:51] would have killed the promise but he
[1:21:53] heard the voice and the angels stopped
[1:21:56] him and said there's a ram here
[1:22:00] in first kings 19 5 the bible says that
[1:22:03] elijah was really tired amen he had been
[1:22:06] preaching he had been laboring real hard
[1:22:09] they've been against all that all that
[1:22:11] all that nonsense that they have in
[1:22:12] jezebel and the bible says that the lord
[1:22:16] told elijah to go to a juniper tree and
[1:22:18] the prophet of god said he went up there
[1:22:20] and he told his angels he said i want
[1:22:22] the angel that's got the softest hands
[1:22:26] and the best cook to go down to the
[1:22:28] juniper tree and i want you to find my
[1:22:30] weary servant and i want you to stroke
[1:22:33] his brow i want you to fix him some corn
[1:22:35] cakes i want you to minister to him
[1:22:40] well brother andrew that's real good
[1:22:42] amen that's your good but that changed
[1:22:44] that that's elijah and this soft angel
[1:22:47] salt handed angel went over and struck
[1:22:49] the little servant of god on the ground
[1:22:51] remember if you've done your best yes
[1:22:55] brother andrew that's elijah that's not
[1:22:57] me but remember if you've done your best
[1:23:01] then god still god angels
[1:23:04] yes sir in order
[1:23:06] he loves you just the same as he loved
[1:23:09] elijah in daniel 3 and verse 28 the
[1:23:13] bible tells us that god sent his angel
[1:23:15] to deliver the three hebrew boys that
[1:23:17] they would give them sin they would not
[1:23:19] give themselves over to the idolatry of
[1:23:22] the day in daniel 6 22 daniel testified
[1:23:25] that god had sent his angel and shut the
[1:23:28] lion's mouth that they would not hurt
[1:23:30] him in mark 1 13 jesus was in the
[1:23:33] wilderness 40 days tempted of satan and
[1:23:35] the angels ministered unto him in luke
[1:23:38] 16 22 amen the bible says that there was
[1:23:41] a beggar named lazarus and that man died
[1:23:43] notice and was carried by angels
[1:23:48] there is an angel
[1:23:50] i know we can't shake hands and
[1:23:52] breakfast hey but look at somebody next
[1:23:54] to you and say there's an angel
[1:23:57] there's an angel
[1:23:58] brother brian there's an
[1:24:00] angel i'm trying to behave this morning
[1:24:03] brother there's an angel here there's an
[1:24:06] angel there's an angel with you in your
[1:24:08] birth there's an angel with you in your
[1:24:10] life oh come on church there's an angel
[1:24:13] with you in your death
[1:24:15] yes sir and then you look in acts 5 19
[1:24:18] how the angel of the lord by night came
[1:24:21] down and opened the prison doors for the
[1:24:24] apostles that they were thrown behind
[1:24:26] all right if there is an angel
[1:24:30] can i preach to you for a minute the
[1:24:32] same angel that was in your past is the
[1:24:35] same angel that's in your present and
[1:24:38] that same angel has already been in your
[1:24:42] future
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:47] he was in your past he's the reason why
[1:24:50] your past didn't consume you
[1:24:56] oh come on church
[1:24:58] well bless god brother andrew i have you
[1:25:00] to know right now i want no cigarette
[1:25:03] sucking whiskey drinking i was a message
[1:25:05] believer from the time i was born
[1:25:08] but you know what there's an angel
[1:25:10] because there's been people sent message
[1:25:12] churches that's not been consumed by
[1:25:14] alcohol that's not been consumed by
[1:25:16] drugs but they've been consumed by false
[1:25:19] doctrines
[1:25:22] but the reason why you are not it's
[1:25:26] because there was
[1:25:28] [Applause]
[1:25:29] oh god i hope you hear me this way you
[1:25:32] ain't got nothing to praise god for
[1:25:34] you're out of your mind you've got
[1:25:36] something to praise him for this morning
[1:25:38] you shouldn't
[1:25:48] don't you touch my lips
[1:25:54] i'll tell you why i'm here this morning
[1:25:56] it's because i memorized all the quotes
[1:25:58] i memorized all the sunset mountains and
[1:26:00] i memorized all the cliches no there's a
[1:26:03] lot of people done that but they're not
[1:26:06] here this morning but the only reason
[1:26:08] why that you're here this morning is
[1:26:10] because there was an angel
[1:26:17] there was an angel
[1:26:18] there was an angel that could not amen
[1:26:22] let you go that way because he had done
[1:26:24] being in your future
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:27] oh god
[1:26:29] in your future are you all hearing me
[1:26:32] don't you see why i heard him say this
[1:26:34] morning in future home he said let me
[1:26:36] draw brother i i i'm all scattered but
[1:26:39] i'm just going to preach amen he said
[1:26:41] let me draw it for you he said here's
[1:26:43] those pharisees and here's those priests
[1:26:46] and here's all those all those
[1:26:48] attributes he said and here's the woman
[1:26:50] at the well he said see he said she came
[1:26:53] from there therefore she could recognize
[1:26:56] him because she had representation to go
[1:26:59] back there
[1:26:59] [Applause]
[1:27:02] when the vindicated word of her day
[1:27:05] crossed her path she had to believe it
[1:27:08] because she believed it
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:16] there those pharisees
[1:27:19] those pharisees they saw the vindicated
[1:27:22] word and it didn't move them he said you
[1:27:24] know why because they didn't have no
[1:27:26] representation there
[1:27:28] hey
[1:27:29] but the reason why she was so happy is
[1:27:32] because an angel had admitted her future
[1:27:35] and had done seen her there
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:41] oh do you know why that guardian angel
[1:27:43] won't let you quit you don't know why
[1:27:46] that guardian angel won't let you give
[1:27:48] up do you know why that guardian angel
[1:27:50] won't let your bad days outweigh your
[1:27:53] good days to the point you give up is
[1:27:55] because he's done seeing your spot at
[1:27:58] the
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:12] he's going to
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:17] [Applause]
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:35] and he's already seen my future
[1:28:45] go ahead and praise god
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:55] [Applause]
[1:29:05] the angels
[1:29:07] [Applause]
[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:21] oh god
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:30] that's real nice but that ain't
[1:29:32] scripture
[1:29:36] my bible says that the angel of god
[1:29:39] stood before paul
[1:29:46] i don't mind telling you i'm feeling
[1:29:48] them outdoors right now
[1:29:52] the angel stood before paul
[1:29:55] and said paul you're going to be
[1:29:57] shipwrecked
[1:29:58] you're going to go through 14 days of no
[1:30:01] light but don't worry
[1:30:04] [Applause]
[1:30:06] will be no lives lost
[1:30:09] you will make it
[1:30:11] you will make it
[1:30:13] who was paul he was the messenger of the
[1:30:16] age
[1:30:17] are y'all catching me this morning then
[1:30:19] when paul got on that ship and all of a
[1:30:21] sudden they were sailing and it began to
[1:30:23] storm paul didn't get nervous he went
[1:30:26] turned on be not afraid in his eye
[1:30:31] hey when the when the first bit of rain
[1:30:33] began to fall paul didn't get nervous he
[1:30:36] went in there and turned on the future
[1:30:37] home
[1:30:39] see he was in his presence but he had a
[1:30:42] future
[1:30:45] oh i know this is simple but here my
[1:30:47] heart this morning and when the storm
[1:30:49] began to rock the ship and paul was
[1:30:51] sitting there maybe someone began to get
[1:30:53] nervous and knock their knees and say oh
[1:30:55] paul what's going to happen paul didn't
[1:30:58] get nervous he just kept on praising god
[1:31:03] all of a sudden this broke apart
[1:31:05] and there they are and they're all
[1:31:07] scattered out there on the sea
[1:31:10] but paul never lost height of the shore
[1:31:14] he never lost height of the shore
[1:31:17] because an angel
[1:31:20] said paul
[1:31:22] you're going to be shipwrecked now i
[1:31:23] want you to catch something paul gets on
[1:31:25] the other side
[1:31:28] you imagine paul gets over there and he
[1:31:30] gets over there and he's looking around
[1:31:32] and he might be singing oh won't we have
[1:31:34] a time
[1:31:37] when we all get over yonder
[1:31:40] maybe he was singing they'll be dancing
[1:31:42] at isaiah brooks they'll be dancing on
[1:31:45] the hills of glory
[1:31:47] and that paul was shouting you imagine
[1:31:49] some of these other guys come up on
[1:31:51] broken pieces
[1:31:52] come up on broken boards and there was
[1:31:54] paul over there just praising god they
[1:31:57] said paul what's wrong with you don't
[1:31:59] you see what we just went through don't
[1:32:02] you see what we just survived oh why are
[1:32:05] you so happy paul said before it ever
[1:32:07] happened i met an angel
[1:32:12] and that angel said paul there's going
[1:32:14] to be some shipwrecks there's going to
[1:32:16] be some people leave the message there's
[1:32:18] going to be some preachers tonight of
[1:32:19] indicated word there's going to be some
[1:32:21] families and friends that you love
[1:32:23] dearly that's going to throw up their
[1:32:25] hands and say it's nothing but cannon
[1:32:27] fighter but don't you be shaking paul
[1:32:29] because you're going to make it
[1:32:31] [Applause]
[1:32:33] right there's enough to praise god for
[1:32:35] an hour we're going to make a
[1:32:39] fall by church
[1:32:39] left side some may fall by our eyes but
[1:32:42] we've heard an angel say
[1:32:46] oh the angel
[1:32:48] that was in the past
[1:32:50] was the guardian angel in the present
[1:32:52] was the guardian angel that already seen
[1:32:54] your future
[1:32:56] see then what are all these
[1:32:58] can i have just a few more minutes
[1:32:59] what are all these they're all
[1:33:02] ministering spirits
[1:33:05] the bible says amen notice here are they
[1:33:07] not all ministering spirits sent forth
[1:33:10] to minister for them who shall be heirs
[1:33:13] of salvation see then what is the word
[1:33:15] ministering means it means to be
[1:33:17] employed in the ministry
[1:33:20] then these angels are employed by god to
[1:33:24] see that you get there
[1:33:27] [Applause]
[1:33:29] but what do they do
[1:33:31] they bring you the word
[1:33:34] notice here ministering spirits sent
[1:33:36] where from the presence of god what to
[1:33:40] do
[1:33:40] minister his word and the greatest
[1:33:43] bounty ever fought the angel lord even
[1:33:45] his picture hanging here on the wall has
[1:33:47] got science stumped everywhere what does
[1:33:49] he do
[1:33:50] stay right with the word amen cut every
[1:33:54] devil
[1:33:58] let's say that together cut every devil
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:03] yes it does
[1:34:05] what is it
[1:34:08] it's the ministering spirit
[1:34:11] sent from the presence of god to anoint
[1:34:13] the speakers of the word
[1:34:16] what that stays with the word
[1:34:20] and he confirms the word with signs
[1:34:23] following and brings jesus the same
[1:34:25] yesterday
[1:34:27] today and forever notice here what's the
[1:34:30] matter though it's in our minds we open
[1:34:32] our minds to things and say well now i
[1:34:35] don't know whether it could be or not
[1:34:37] maybe if i feel better tomorrow oh don't
[1:34:40] have one thing to do with that now
[1:34:43] notice here there are true angels and
[1:34:45] there are false angels
[1:34:48] can you say amen amen now if you'll
[1:34:50] notice here both types of angels have
[1:34:54] characteristics
[1:34:55] in the book of revelation 22 verse 8 and
[1:34:57] i john saw these things and heard them
[1:35:00] and when i heard and seen i fell down to
[1:35:04] worship before the feet of the angel
[1:35:07] which showed me these things then saith
[1:35:09] the unto me see thou do it not for i am
[1:35:12] thy fellow servant and of thy brethren
[1:35:15] the prophets and of them which keep the
[1:35:18] scenes of this book notice the next two
[1:35:21] words worship god
[1:35:24] god has always used angels in his work
[1:35:27] but god has had angels to every
[1:35:29] dispensation and i want you to catch
[1:35:31] something here god always sends his
[1:35:33] warning
[1:35:35] just the same just the days before the
[1:35:38] coming of the lord jesus god always
[1:35:40] makes a preparation so he sends an angel
[1:35:44] notice here and a true angel would not
[1:35:46] stand to be worshipped right there is
[1:35:49] the first characteristic of a true angel
[1:35:51] he will not stand to be worshipped all
[1:35:54] right the second characteristic is a
[1:35:57] real true angel will come and vindicate
[1:36:01] this scripture to the dot he won't
[1:36:03] change it he won't water it down he
[1:36:06] won't add to it he'll only vindicate
[1:36:08] what's already written then the third
[1:36:10] thing is a true angel of god will bear a
[1:36:14] record
[1:36:15] of christ
[1:36:17] hallelujah a true great mind will bear
[1:36:20] grace and a true spirit of god will
[1:36:23] manifest jesus christ if it doesn't then
[1:36:26] it don't answer to the year of famine
[1:36:28] but it says and i defy the devil
[1:36:31] hallelujah
[1:36:32] and all of his works
[1:36:35] it's the hour of the church's
[1:36:37] deliverance and they're sitting under
[1:36:39] creeds and nominations and fleshing and
[1:36:42] going on till they don't know their day
[1:36:44] but rise
[1:36:46] all right right you that sleep
[1:36:49] amen
[1:36:50] and shake yourself
[1:36:53] and call on god
[1:36:55] amen it's the hour of the church's
[1:36:58] deliverance
[1:37:00] amen can i give you a fourth
[1:37:02] characteristic of a true angel
[1:37:04] the fourth characteristic is he will
[1:37:06] testify that the bible which is the
[1:37:08] written truth the written word is the
[1:37:11] truth
[1:37:13] now i i'm i'm trying to hurry here
[1:37:16] but i want you to catch this there's
[1:37:17] many characteristics of false angels
[1:37:20] right amen but but i just want to give
[1:37:22] you the the number one identifying
[1:37:24] characteristic of a false angel
[1:37:26] galatians 1 6 i marvel that you're not
[1:37:29] so soon removed from him that called you
[1:37:32] into the grace of christ
[1:37:34] unto another gospel which is not another
[1:37:37] but there be some that trouble you
[1:37:42] and would pervert the gospel of christ
[1:37:45] notice here but the we
[1:37:49] are an
[1:37:50] angel
[1:37:51] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[1:37:54] you than that which we have preached
[1:37:56] unto you let him be accursed
[1:38:02] and paul was so determined that he would
[1:38:04] say as we said before so say i now again
[1:38:08] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[1:38:11] you then that ye have received let him
[1:38:14] be accursed
[1:38:15] then bluebeam says what is it he said
[1:38:17] the angel of the lord that comes to me
[1:38:20] never takes me away from the scripture
[1:38:23] the angel that you see in the picture
[1:38:26] never took the prophet away from the
[1:38:29] scripture
[1:38:30] then what is the identifying
[1:38:32] characteristic of a false angel
[1:38:35] hallelujah
[1:38:37] to lead you
[1:38:38] away from the word amen
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:45] so this morning
[1:38:46] if a false angel come in here and said i
[1:38:48] want to tell y'all something the ark
[1:38:50] never did happen
[1:38:54] well you screw your shoulders back say
[1:38:56] i'll tell you right now bless god
[1:38:59] i'll take you over to kentucky and show
[1:39:00] you the replica
[1:39:05] the angel is not going to fight you on
[1:39:08] what's already been fulfilled
[1:39:15] he's not going to try to lead you
[1:39:18] away from what paul done or what peter
[1:39:20] done what's he going to do lead you away
[1:39:23] from the vindicated word of your hour
[1:39:26] see the problem of god said that's what
[1:39:28] israel needed was a way out of egypt and
[1:39:30] god provided them a prophet with the
[1:39:33] vindicated original word are you hearing
[1:39:36] me all right now let me read this to you
[1:39:38] brother and praying says may now they
[1:39:40] repent come quickly to you and be filled
[1:39:42] with the oil and the wine and be changed
[1:39:45] from that denominational robe of cain's
[1:39:47] death unto a snow white robe of eternal
[1:39:51] life given out by the bridegroom and
[1:39:54] then they'll go to the wedding supper
[1:39:56] someday in the vindicated word of the
[1:40:01] resurrection
[1:40:05] i don't have time to get into all this
[1:40:06] let me let me let me listen this way the
[1:40:09] leadership of god
[1:40:10] the god the guardian angel the leader of
[1:40:14] the way is follow the vindicated word
[1:40:18] of the hour by the holy ghost
[1:40:22] now i want you to catch us here because
[1:40:24] eve's interpreter is the false
[1:40:28] angel's chief
[1:40:31] now the bible says the serpent was more
[1:40:33] simple than any beast in the field verse
[1:40:35] 4 and the serpent said to the woman you
[1:40:37] shall not surely die all right god will
[1:40:40] not now some churches says we don't
[1:40:42] believe this but we believe that god
[1:40:44] will never judge the world by the church
[1:40:46] he judges it by jesus christ and jesus
[1:40:50] christ is the word he'll judge the
[1:40:52] church by the word and if this is the
[1:40:54] revelation of jesus christ for all ages
[1:40:57] and for this age he's revealed in this
[1:40:59] bible what he would do in this age and
[1:41:02] when we see it do it
[1:41:04] right
[1:41:06] i can preach there all day when we see
[1:41:09] it do it
[1:41:10] when we see him do what he promised to
[1:41:13] do
[1:41:13] not a virgin
[1:41:16] birth hello
[1:41:19] not a virgin birth that was 2 000 years
[1:41:22] ago
[1:41:23] but what he promised to do today what he
[1:41:26] said he would do today that's what he is
[1:41:29] today and many times people say well i
[1:41:32] don't believe that well you've got eve's
[1:41:34] interpreter again
[1:41:38] right
[1:41:39] eve's interpreter amen was lucifer
[1:41:44] and satan now he said he would exhaust
[1:41:46] himself above the most high he would
[1:41:48] ascend above the clouds and the stars he
[1:41:50] would sit there like god be above the
[1:41:52] most high he has succeeded in carrying
[1:41:54] out his threats he has certainly had a
[1:41:56] marvelous success in carrying out his
[1:41:58] threats by the people letting him
[1:42:01] explain away in every age the value of
[1:42:05] god's promised word to that age that's
[1:42:08] exactly how he's done it so when an age
[1:42:11] comes and god sends an angel to lead
[1:42:14] that age and the devil comes in and says
[1:42:17] that's not the way it's supposed to be
[1:42:20] then they believe eve's interpreter and
[1:42:22] leads him out of the way now amy can i
[1:42:24] have just a few minutes here am i
[1:42:26] holding too long
[1:42:28] if you look with me in revelation 1 in
[1:42:30] the in the patmos vision the bible says
[1:42:33] remember says it this way before we read
[1:42:34] there they put him on the owl for two
[1:42:36] years and while god had him out there
[1:42:38] along to himself he wrote the book of
[1:42:40] revelation as the angel of the lord
[1:42:43] revealed it to him so john goes to the
[1:42:46] isle of patmos god sends an angel his
[1:42:49] angel comes and reveals the book of
[1:42:51] revelation to john and john writes it
[1:42:53] now in verse 10 of revelation 1 i was in
[1:42:56] the spirit on the lord's day and heard
[1:42:58] behind me as a great voice as of a
[1:43:00] trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the
[1:43:03] first and the last what thou seest write
[1:43:06] in a book and send it and the seven
[1:43:08] churches which are in asia under ephesus
[1:43:11] smyrna pergamus thytyra sardis
[1:43:14] philadelphia and laodicea and i turned
[1:43:17] to see the voice that spake with me
[1:43:20] and being turned i saw seven golden
[1:43:23] candlesticks
[1:43:26] and in the midst of the seven
[1:43:28] candlesticks was one like unto the son
[1:43:30] of man now i want to skip down here to
[1:43:32] verse 16 and he had in his right hand
[1:43:35] seven stars and out of his mouth with a
[1:43:38] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:43:40] countenance was as the sun it shineth in
[1:43:42] his strength and i saw him and i fell at
[1:43:45] his feet as dead and he had his right
[1:43:47] hand upon me saying unto me fear not i
[1:43:50] am the first and the last amen now
[1:43:53] notice here in verse 19 write these
[1:43:55] things which shall have seen and the
[1:43:57] things which thou are and with through
[1:43:59] things that shall be hereafter past
[1:44:02] present future
[1:44:03] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:44:06] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[1:44:09] seven golden candlesticks the seven
[1:44:12] stars are the angels of the seven
[1:44:15] churches and the seven candlesticks
[1:44:17] which thou saw us are the seven churches
[1:44:20] now notice here he had in his right hand
[1:44:22] seven stars remember those seven stars
[1:44:25] are the messengers to seven successive
[1:44:28] church ages
[1:44:30] they are not called by name they are
[1:44:32] just set forth as seven but it's one to
[1:44:35] each h
[1:44:37] from the ephesian age on down to this
[1:44:39] layout of sin age each messenger brought
[1:44:42] the message of truth to the people never
[1:44:45] failing to keep it with the word of god
[1:44:48] for that particular age each one held on
[1:44:51] to it amen each one held on to it they
[1:44:53] were steadfast in their loyalty to the
[1:44:56] original light as each age pulled away
[1:44:59] from god his faithful messenger
[1:45:02] hallelujah
[1:45:04] would turn that age back to the word
[1:45:06] their strength was from the lord
[1:45:09] and i'm not going to preach all day but
[1:45:11] stay with me their strength was from the
[1:45:13] lord or they could have never stemmed
[1:45:16] the tide these angels were not floating
[1:45:19] downstream they were swimming upstream
[1:45:23] oh god have mercy they were not swimming
[1:45:26] down they were swimming up
[1:45:31] i can't read my notes for catching
[1:45:33] inspiration don't you see they weren't
[1:45:35] going down they were going up what are
[1:45:38] we doing we're not coming
[1:45:43] we're down up
[1:45:45] the angel didn't lead him down they was
[1:45:47] already down but the angel let him up
[1:45:51] oh come on church if you're down this
[1:45:53] morning there's an angel in this feeling
[1:45:59] [Music]
[1:46:03] oh they were truly yielded to him and
[1:46:05] kept him by his own kept by his
[1:46:07] omnipotence they were denounced by the
[1:46:09] organizations and they were held in
[1:46:12] mockery but they kept to the true word
[1:46:15] all right amen
[1:46:17] i gotta close here in a second
[1:46:22] but we'll say paul swam the tide
[1:46:25] we'll say martin swim the tide
[1:46:27] we'll say columbus swim the tide we'll
[1:46:29] say luther swam against the tide well
[1:46:31] let's not just leave it there because
[1:46:33] we're in an age and we need an angel too
[1:46:37] but in the days
[1:46:40] [Applause]
[1:46:41] [Music]
[1:46:44] when he shall
[1:46:46] begin to sound
[1:46:48] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:46:51] when he shall begin to sound when you
[1:46:54] hear his voice you are closer
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:47:00] you are closer when you hear that voice
[1:47:03] you are closer to home than you've ever
[1:47:06] been for seven successive church ages

[1:49:36] you say with andrew i don't know about
[1:49:38] that i don't know what's happening i'll
[1:49:40] tell you what those seven angel
[1:49:42] messengers were sent to do they were
[1:49:44] sent together the elect
[1:49:48] i've got a three-part sermon right here
[1:49:49] in one i'm trying to tie it up they were
[1:49:51] sent to gather the election
[1:49:56] behold
[1:49:57] i
[1:49:58] god send an angel
[1:50:01] to do what
[1:50:02] keep me in the
[1:50:05] they were sent to gather the elect into
[1:50:08] the way
[1:50:09] brethren said god sending forth angels
[1:50:11] together the elect from the four winds
[1:50:13] of the earth with our angels they are
[1:50:15] divine keepers behold i sent an angel to
[1:50:18] preserve thee in the journey amen in the
[1:50:21] way of holiness amen the way is the
[1:50:23] middle of the road now but the real
[1:50:25] church is a real same gospel right in
[1:50:28] the middle of the road it's not cold and
[1:50:30] starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a
[1:50:33] real good old warm gospel
[1:50:38] love of god going right down the middle
[1:50:41] of the road calling from both sides
[1:50:46] what am i saying god's provided way walk
[1:50:49] in god's provided way
[1:50:51] he has provided us a messenger the holy
[1:50:54] ghost he has provided us a word and if
[1:50:56] any spirit speaks conquer the word it
[1:50:58] cannot be the holy ghost
[1:51:01] now brother andrew what kind of road are
[1:51:02] you on it's a road that's been built by
[1:51:05] christ our lord the expansion that is
[1:51:08] made from earth to another land and the
[1:51:11] unclean doesn't pass over it then what
[1:51:13] does that angel do he keeps you in the
[1:51:16] way who is the way jesus said i am the
[1:51:20] way
[1:51:22] christ is the way he is not a way it's
[1:51:26] the way can i make some devils mad and
[1:51:28] close amen christ is the way the message
[1:51:32] of the hour is christ
[1:51:35] then that tells me this message is the
[1:51:38] way
[1:51:42] brother andrew how am i going to get
[1:51:45] from here to over there how am i going
[1:51:47] to get from here there it's real simple
[1:51:50] [Music]
[1:51:52] god sent a message it's called the way
[1:51:54] just walk in it amen
[1:51:59] well then that's too simple for me well
[1:52:01] the product of god said this way well
[1:52:03] brother andrew i i don't know if i can
[1:52:04] walk in this message i don't know if i
[1:52:06] can follow this angel messenger he's the
[1:52:08] absolute to the believer and if christ
[1:52:11] is your absolute you're tied to him and
[1:52:13] if he is your absolute and you're tied
[1:52:16] to him then you're tied to the word now
[1:52:18] now this tells whether we got the right
[1:52:20] absolute or not see if you can read it
[1:52:22] in the scripture something that christ
[1:52:25] has ordained us to do and because of
[1:52:27] some twisting around if someone would
[1:52:29] tell you that was for the disciples or
[1:52:31] someone else then you don't hold on to
[1:52:33] that then christ is not your absolute
[1:52:36] here's where i want to leave it that
[1:52:38] person listen here that person who led
[1:52:41] you out of the way is your absolute but
[1:52:46] if that word christ still holds see then
[1:52:50] he is your absolute and we mustn't let
[1:52:54] anything stir us out of the way of the
[1:52:57] word
[1:52:59] a true angel will lead you in the way he
[1:53:01] will tell you to stay in the way but a
[1:53:04] false angel will tell you there's
[1:53:05] another way but my god said my ways are
[1:53:08] not your ways for my ways are higher
[1:53:11] than your ways amen they've been trying
[1:53:14] to find ways to get there but god sent
[1:53:16] seven angel messengers to seven church
[1:53:19] ages to lay out the way of christ
[1:53:22] unfolding himself in this last gentile
[1:53:25] age
[1:53:32] and
[1:53:33] to keep thee
[1:53:36] in the way
[1:53:39] and this is where i'm done
[1:53:41] and to bring me
[1:53:44] to a prepared
[1:53:47] place
[1:53:51] can i tell you this morning he's not
[1:53:54] working on it right now
[1:53:59] maybe i preached up the first 30 minutes
[1:54:01] he's not working on it now
[1:54:04] it's already
[1:54:09] see to bring me to a prepared place to a
[1:54:12] stable place to establish place to a
[1:54:15] fixed place to a place that's been
[1:54:17] arranged to be restored
[1:54:22] then what are you saying i'm saying our
[1:54:24] god is a god of preparation before god
[1:54:27] does anything he prepares it god prepare
[1:54:31] god's preparation has been absolutely
[1:54:34] ridiculous to the natural mind because
[1:54:36] the natural mind cannot conceive the
[1:54:38] things that are of god can i tell you
[1:54:41] something of how god all right i'm going
[1:54:43] to close right here
[1:54:44] god prepared he prepared your coming
[1:54:47] he prepared your being here
[1:54:50] but he also prepared you're leaving here
[1:54:54] you say brother andrew what are you
[1:54:55] talking about god prepared a sacrifice
[1:54:58] for abraham on the mountain when goliath
[1:55:01] made his boast god already had a man by
[1:55:03] the name of david prepared to take care
[1:55:05] of him the bible says noah prepared the
[1:55:08] ark to the saving of his household god
[1:55:11] prepared the prophet isaiah for the days
[1:55:14] of his prophecy in the days of israel
[1:55:16] after 400 years of being in bondage god
[1:55:19] prepared a sign of deliverance for them
[1:55:22] god was the sign of deliverance to
[1:55:24] israel and god was the sign of judgment
[1:55:27] to egypt oh can i go a step further the
[1:55:30] lord had prepared a great fish amen to
[1:55:33] swallow up jonathan
[1:55:35] amen see he's the god of preparation all
[1:55:38] that was done in your coming here all
[1:55:41] that was done before you got here but
[1:55:43] when you got here what was done was a
[1:55:46] foreshadow of what was going to happen
[1:55:48] to you when you got here to get you out
[1:55:50] of where you are to take you where you
[1:55:52] should always have been
[1:55:54] [Applause]

[2:00:12] i'm reminding you
[2:00:16] i'm reminding you you didn't start here
[2:00:23] you came from god
[2:00:27] there was a guardian angel with you
[2:00:31] watched over you in your birth
[2:00:34] prepared you're coming here
[2:00:37] when you begin to get older
[2:00:39] watched over here
[2:00:43] watched overs in our running days
[2:00:46] when we was running from god
[2:00:51] brother andrew i went running from god i
[2:00:52] sit in the message church where he was
[2:00:54] just running from god in the messy
[2:00:55] church all right amen
[2:00:59] running from god
[2:01:02] but there was an angel watching over
[2:01:04] here
[2:01:08] said brother andrew that angel was only
[2:01:09] with me when i was out in the world and
[2:01:10] then i got saved that angel he don't say
[2:01:12] no
[2:01:13] see that same angels right here this
[2:01:14] morning amen amen
[2:01:16] prophet god said angel will meet you and
[2:01:18] bring you to the seat you're sitting
[2:01:19] here
[2:01:24] i got to preach on angel the other day
[2:01:25] at home
[2:01:26] and where we're at right now we got a
[2:01:28] church building's too small for all the
[2:01:29] people we got to social distance so
[2:01:30] we've got a
[2:01:31] campground we can spread out in there
[2:01:33] six feet apart
[2:01:35] and the state orders are you got to set
[2:01:37] families together so when they they went
[2:01:40] over and got that building and arranged
[2:01:41] it they actually put seats together and
[2:01:43] then they put name tags on the back so
[2:01:44] one would say like for us the glovers or
[2:01:46] ones say this so it's it's already
[2:01:49] arranged
[2:01:50] i got preaching on that about angels and
[2:01:52] i said you know the bible says the
[2:01:54] prophet god tells us that angels
[2:01:55] actually will meet us at the door and
[2:01:57] escort us to our seat
[2:01:59] now you're preaching you feel something
[2:02:00] come back at you
[2:02:01] and i said well wait a minute you're
[2:02:02] saying we're under there and no way that
[2:02:04] could happen because they arranged these
[2:02:05] seats
[2:02:07] the deacons and the pastor come here to
[2:02:08] range you see i said let me just tell
[2:02:10] you how crazy i am
[2:02:13] i'm crazy enough to believe that when
[2:02:14] they was arranged in these seats there
[2:02:16] was an angel leap
[2:02:19] that's how crazy i am because i believe
[2:02:21] in the supernatural hallelujah
[2:02:23] i believe in angels i believe in the
[2:02:24] ministry of angels
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:27] i believe there's an angel here this
[2:02:28] morning
[2:02:31] i believe the reason why you're sitting
[2:02:32] here clothed in your right mind
[2:02:35] hallelujah
[2:02:37] is because there was an angel
[2:02:40] there was an angel around you
[2:02:43] they said no no you've gone too far back
[2:02:45] up devil
[2:02:47] i've got a prepared place for him
[2:02:48] hallelujah
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:52] you love him this morning amen
[2:02:54] hallelujah
[2:02:56] you believe that angel was in your past
[2:03:00] you believe he was in your presence
[2:03:03] you believe he's already been in your
[2:03:04] future
[2:03:08] you ever listen to some of the prayer
[2:03:09] lines
[2:03:12] it amazes me
[2:03:14] brother branham will say
[2:03:16] now i'm here
[2:03:18] but i'm really not here paraphrasing
[2:03:20] he would be his body would be there
[2:03:23] but he would leave and go into another
[2:03:25] dimension
[2:03:29] a dimension ahead
[2:03:31] or he would go into a dimension behind
[2:03:34] and he would say
[2:03:36] he was bit by a dog as a little child
[2:03:38] that fear has followed you all your life
[2:03:41] and he would bring him all the way from
[2:03:42] the past the president say that's why he
[2:03:44] got that fear on you now but then he
[2:03:45] would go in the future
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:47] and say but the thing left you you're
[2:03:49] going to be well go on your way to
[2:03:50] rejoice
[2:03:53] brother i ain't even got time to surface
[2:03:56] the ministry of angels this morning
[2:03:58] but if you don't believe in nothing else
[2:04:00] but this you remember there's a guardian
[2:04:02] angel watching over him

[2:10:02] would you begin to give him some praise
[2:10:04] here

[2:10:09] well jesus
[2:10:10] for this church
[2:10:18] [Applause]
[2:10:26] hallelujah
[2:10:28] you say brother andrew
[2:10:30] i think all this praising god's a little
[2:10:32] foolish
[2:10:34] david said for he shall give his angels
[2:10:36] charge
[2:10:37] over thee
[2:10:40] to keep me in all thy ways
[2:10:43] brother member said each night of course
[2:10:44] the holy spirit is here wherever you go
[2:10:47] he's always there you never get away
[2:10:49] from him david said no matter where he
[2:10:51] made his bed god was there because the
[2:10:54] angels of god are encamped about those
[2:10:56] who fear him he said in our country down
[2:10:59] south we've got luke's they've got a lot
[2:11:00] of colored people that's very spiritual
[2:11:02] and they come to my meeting sometimes
[2:11:04] and they used to sing a little song for
[2:11:05] me i remember they used to sing an old
[2:11:08] kind of sister and sing it all day all
[2:11:11] night
[2:11:12] angels
[2:11:14] are watching over me my lord amen now
[2:11:16] listen what a problem god said he said
[2:11:18] so i always just almost had to time my
[2:11:20] hands to keep from running the meeting
[2:11:23] just jumping up and down and screaming
[2:11:25] and running all over the place now you
[2:11:27] didn't think i did that did you but i do
[2:11:30] he says i don't but he does it in me
[2:11:36] i believe if anybody felt the way i did
[2:11:40] they'd do the same thing
[2:11:42] it's just an experience yes sir it sure
[2:11:45] is you say but andrew how could brother
[2:11:47] branham give god praise and say it was
[2:11:49] an experience because he knew what it
[2:11:51] was like to be ready to go over the
[2:11:53] falls and be killed in a drowning flood
[2:11:56] but the angel stood there he knew what
[2:11:58] it was like to pick up a gun and tried
[2:12:01] to commit suicide but an angel was
[2:12:03] [Music]
[2:12:04] there don't know about you church but
[2:12:07] when i get to talking about angels i
[2:12:09] can't help but feel shouty i can't help
[2:12:12] but feel crazy i can't help but feel
[2:12:14] like giving god some praise because i
[2:12:17] know there's nothing i could have done
[2:12:19] or you could have done to bring me to
[2:12:21] where i'm at today and i also know
[2:12:23] there's nothing i can do to get me to
[2:12:25] the place he prepared but he's got an
[2:12:27] angel

[2:22:02] many times we search for decisions and
[2:22:04] we look for things lord of what to do
[2:22:06] but god
[2:22:08] you make it so simple and so clear
[2:22:12] dear god there's an influence that comes
[2:22:14] lord
[2:22:16] lord when isaiah came into the temple
[2:22:18] that day
[2:22:19] he had been under the influence of
[2:22:20] uzziah
[2:22:22] that influence had limited him
[2:22:26] he had rested upon uzziah
[2:22:29] leaned upon that arm
[2:22:31] but dear god
[2:22:33] that didn't take away that isaiah
[2:22:35] belonged to you
[2:22:37] he was ordained to be your prophet your
[2:22:39] spokesman
[2:22:41] lord jesus when he came into the temple
[2:22:43] that day to worship
[2:22:46] it was different it was more than just a
[2:22:48] church service
[2:22:50] that day
[2:22:52] lord god he came to the awareness
[2:22:55] that the lord is in his temple
[2:22:59] his hind lifted up in his train filled
[2:23:02] the temple
