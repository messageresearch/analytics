[21:22] this song was requested again that I
[21:24] sang on
[21:25] Thursday uh just singing along with me
[21:28] but I did hear a quote this morning that
[21:30] brother Bram said they just spoke to me
[21:33] about how much we need the Lord in this
[21:35] hour the little boat as it dashed across
[21:38] the lake it must have been about the
[21:40] time that Satan must have raised up and
[21:42] said oh I've caught him caught them
[21:44] alone without him now it's time to
[21:47] settle the score with them for they had
[21:48] been casting out demons and so forth so
[21:51] I'll just settle the score that's when
[21:53] Satan can settle the score when he finds
[21:56] that you've been off without Jesus
[21:58] that's when Satan will get the church
[22:00] when you got so interested in something
[22:02] else besides prayer meetings when you
[22:05] got so interested that's your you're
[22:07] supposed to have the natural growth
[22:09] instead of a spiritual growth then
[22:12] remember Satan's on his Road he caught
[22:14] you without him but oh God my prayer
[22:16] wake up the church again in oldfashioned
[22:18] all night prayer meetings wake up the
[22:20] people a spiritual atmosphere it takes

[43:53] we had both the time when brother Benny
[43:55] was here and then even been in the
[43:56] meetings and amen she's been here a few
[43:58] other times as well and taken care of
[44:00] some some duties and business and things
[44:02] and also want to welcome uh Carlos and
[44:07] his wife and family God bless you good
[44:09] to have you here with
[44:11] us or I guess I should say
[44:16] carito that's actually how it's
[44:20] wrote so but we welcome you good to have
[44:24] you this morning and uh also uh sister
[44:27] Kylie and and her daughter God bless you
[44:30] welcome Amen brother ion's daughter
[44:33] granddaughter good to have you all with
[44:34] us and
[44:36] um so we want to just look here in the
[44:39] word of the Lord here just uh for a few
[44:41] moments this morning and just truly
[44:44] trusting the Lord will just help us and
[44:47] just to speak what he's placed on our
[44:48] hearts let's begin reading in uh verse
[44:52] 15 and when one of them sat at meet with
[44:56] him and heard these things he said unto
[44:59] him blessed is he that shall eat bread
[45:03] in the kingdom of God now you realize
[45:06] bread is the staff of Life bread
[45:09] actually speaks of God's own
[45:13] life and you think about the hour that
[45:16] we are standing in in this time we we
[45:19] realize we're standing in a moment um
[45:22] that you're seeing that the entire B
[45:26] ible it was written for this moment
[45:29] where we are seeing in time the
[45:32] scriptures and everything points to this
[45:34] hour and God fulfilling this moment and
[45:38] so when you think about the scripture
[45:40] there's a scripture in Isaiah that says
[45:42] seven women that speaks of churches
[45:45] would take hold upon one man and that
[45:48] one man is Christ but this is what they
[45:50] would say to him they would say to him
[45:54] we're going to eat our own bread and
[45:56] we're going to eat we're going to wear
[45:57] our own apparel but just let us be
[46:00] called by your name to take away our
[46:02] reproach but you know when God does
[46:05] every anything you know first of all he
[46:08] doesn't come according to any of our
[46:10] demands he's made a way and it's up to
[46:13] us to whether or not we'll accept his
[46:15] way and I think it's very clear that our
[46:18] way is always the wrong way his way is
[46:21] always the right way and so the blessing
[46:24] is is when we you're United with Christ
[46:27] well you not only take upon his name
[46:30] which is his life which is his character
[46:33] uh which is the bread but you also
[46:35] become adorned in his word and so it's
[46:38] just a privilege to be United with him
[46:40] so in verse 16 there it says and a
[46:44] certain man made a great supper and bade
[46:47] many and he sent his s his servant at
[46:50] supper time to say to them that were
[46:53] bidden come for all things are now ready
[46:56] I'm going to let you have your seats and
[46:58] ask the Lord to bless the word as you're
[46:59] being seated I don't want to keep you
[47:01] standing but I would do want to continue
[47:03] to
[47:05] read
[47:06] so a certain man in verse 16 made a
[47:09] great supper and bade many and he sent
[47:13] his servant at supper time to say to
[47:15] them that were bidden come for all
[47:18] things are now ready and they all with
[47:22] one consent began to make excuse the
[47:25] first said unto him I've bought a piece
[47:28] of ground I must needs go and see it and
[47:31] I pray thee have me excused and another
[47:34] said I have bought five yolk of oxen and
[47:38] I go to prove them I pray thee have me
[47:41] excused and another said I have married
[47:44] a wife and therefore I cannot come now
[47:49] all of this is writing of the supper
[47:52] it's the preparation and in the
[47:54] Fulfillment of God's
[47:57] word this was expressing even in the
[48:00] ministry of the Lord Jesus when God was
[48:02] standing here in Corporal body and what
[48:06] was being provided uh to restore back to
[48:09] man a rightful relationship the price
[48:13] would be paid and that man might become
[48:15] a full partaker of the very life of God
[48:19] like he had in the Garden of Eden and so
[48:22] it's a provided notice a certain man
[48:24] made a supper so this has been provided
[48:27] it wasn't anything that that they had to
[48:30] do it's God simply fulfilling his word
[48:34] and then God would send out the call and
[48:36] you one thing you find as we read
[48:37] through this Parable which we are
[48:39] familiar with is God doesn't make
[48:41] anybody serve him as a matter of fact
[48:44] even even lives that have come into a
[48:48] surrender to the Lord and been born of
[48:50] the spirit of God God still does not
[48:53] make us do anything it's not something
[48:55] that he's making us do but the spirit of
[48:57] God works on our life for us to yield to
[49:00] him and then him coming and doing it and
[49:03] there and so when we look at this here
[49:06] you find that many things were offered
[49:08] there of I've bought an ox and I've
[49:10] bought some ground of married a wife and
[49:13] all of those things and then it goes on
[49:15] in verse 21 it says so that servant came
[49:18] and showed his Lord these things and
[49:20] then the master of the house being angry
[49:23] said to his servant go out quickly into
[49:25] the streets and Lanes of the city and
[49:28] bring in hither the poor and the maimed
[49:31] and the Halt and the blind that's a
[49:32] that's a healing
[49:35] campaign right verse 22 and the servant
[49:39] said Lord it is done as thou has
[49:42] commanded and yet there is room and the
[49:46] Lord said unto the servant go out into
[49:49] the highways and hedges and compel them
[49:52] to come in that my house may be fill
[49:55] filled for I say unto you that none of
[49:58] those men which were bidden shall taste
[50:01] of my supper now I just say it in this
[50:04] way you know it's just like around your
[50:08] table sometimes when we have a family
[50:10] gathering we have to go and borrow
[50:12] chairs from the basement and other
[50:13] places you know and put them around
[50:15] there but at God's table every chair is
[50:19] already been placed Hallelujah before
[50:22] the foundation of the world so God is
[50:25] Not not looking around and and hoping
[50:27] that he has enough seats or hoping that
[50:30] he has enough uh garments and hoping no
[50:33] God knows exactly how many and as a
[50:37] matter of fact it it's him that has to
[50:39] move and does move upon the hearts of
[50:42] his children of whom those places have
[50:45] been reserved for before the foundation
[50:48] of the world God doesn't keep anybody
[50:50] out neither does God Drive anybody in
[50:54] but God simply sends his his word and
[50:56] his word is what will bring a call upon
[50:59] the hearts of the people that is even
[51:02] greater than our own
[51:04] Rebellion it is greater than our own
[51:07] desires it becomes greater than anything
[51:11] else around us and we can't get away
[51:14] from it and so when we think of this
[51:18] here brother Bram when he preaches the
[51:20] message is your life worthy of the
[51:22] gospel and that's where drawing much of
[51:24] the inspiration this morning here and
[51:26] throughout the cannon of the scripture
[51:28] but he's in prayer when he's beginning
[51:30] this message is your life worthy of the
[51:32] gospel and he's he's stating the the
[51:35] reason for it in prayer for this
[51:37] particular uh service he says so many
[51:40] has asked me is the Christian Life a
[51:43] life of church service is it helping the
[51:47] poor and the needy or is it a constant
[51:50] member is it a loyalty to the church and
[51:53] such questions now listen listen if
[51:56] people are asking questions there's a
[51:59] reason questions are not just we don't
[52:02] think up questions unless they come from
[52:05] Reflections upon the heart and you think
[52:08] in this hour there if there's a question
[52:11] then there is an certain answer to that
[52:14] question there even no matter what even
[52:17] the question might even be upon your
[52:19] heart there is a certain answer and that
[52:23] certain answer comes from God and God
[52:26] Alone no matter what the situation is so
[52:29] we can take this this rest and I want to
[52:32] just read if I can going into this
[52:35] moment of Revelations 3 and verse 14
[52:38] because here we are we're standing here
[52:41] at the End of the Age we're standing in
[52:43] a very awesome hour and an awesome time
[52:46] where the Bible would say that the let
[52:48] us be glad and rejoice for the marriage
[52:51] of the Lamb has come and his wife hath
[52:54] made her self ready it would speak of
[52:57] what a blessing it is to be called to
[53:00] the wedding supper to the marriage
[53:02] supper and it's we are called to that by
[53:05] the true sayings of God you see we're
[53:08] not being assembled to a man to an
[53:10] organization to the thoughts or the idea
[53:13] of a man but these are the true sayings
[53:15] of God God has brought back once again
[53:19] and brought back a people in whom the
[53:22] word of God is their absolute not just
[53:26] carrying around the Bible and saying
[53:28] well it's my absolute but I don't know
[53:29] about that scripture uh God I think it
[53:31] means this I think it means this then
[53:33] the word of God is not your absolute but
[53:36] God in himself God himself did this not
[53:39] by a debate not by not by coming down
[53:41] and reasoning us into it and and saying
[53:44] words but God himself vindicates his own
[53:48] word to be the truth God does that it's
[53:51] God who just settles all disputes amen
[53:55] it just goes to show you the grace of
[53:57] God that no matter how much even when
[54:00] the Lord Jesus could stand there and
[54:02] speak to those Pharisees but they had
[54:05] nothing within them to hear what was
[54:07] being said there was nothing in there to
[54:11] catch that spark of life no matter how
[54:14] much was Vindicated and I tell you if
[54:17] this if there's something in your heart
[54:19] a desire to serve God and you might say
[54:22] I'm not I I know I'm not where I need to
[54:24] be but 's a desire in your heart to
[54:27] serve God you are a blessed people this
[54:31] morning God can work with the desire as
[54:34] a matter of fact he put that desire in
[54:39] you and if you'll trust him he'll lead
[54:42] you to a place of
[54:46] fulfillment the Bible says this in verse
[54:48] 14 so we're we're speaking of this
[54:51] uniting and the angel of the Church of
[54:53] the lady oans right this is where we're
[54:55] standing these things saith the amen the
[54:59] faithful and true witness the beginning
[55:02] of the creation of God I Know Thy works
[55:05] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[55:09] would thou W cold or hot so then because
[55:12] Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I
[55:16] will spew thee out of my mouth does not
[55:19] value uh an in between life we don't
[55:22] want to live an in between life we don't
[55:25] want to live even even between God's
[55:27] Will and our will we don't want to live
[55:28] between that we want to live fully to
[55:31] God's will because the in between is
[55:34] where that God says that I I I would
[55:36] rather you're fully hot or you're fully
[55:38] or you're fully cold don't live an in
[55:40] between life and I just let's just be
[55:42] honest here any that lives an in between
[55:45] life that is the most miserable place to
[55:48] live amen that's right it's miserable
[55:52] right is that right you might say well
[55:54] coldness with would be miserable well
[55:55] that's true but listen it's very
[55:58] miserable to know that you're not being
[56:00] whom God has called you to be and it's
[56:02] kind of in between but God's desire is
[56:05] is that our lives would be burning with
[56:09] his own
[56:11] life and this in this hour the amen is
[56:15] speaking this message is the amen is the
[56:18] Christ is the so be it the faithful and
[56:22] true witness from the beginning of the
[56:24] creation of
[56:25] God verse 17 because thou sayest I am
[56:29] rich and increased with goods and have
[56:31] need of nothing and knowest not that
[56:34] thou art wretched and miserable and poor
[56:37] and blind and naked what's the condition
[56:40] of the saes trusting in uncertain
[56:43] riches trusting trusting in their Works
[56:47] trusting in their Creeds trusting in
[56:50] their
[56:51] dogmas this is the condition of it
[56:54] notice I counsel thee to buy me gold a
[56:57] character that's tried in the fire that
[57:00] thou mayest be rich and white rment that
[57:02] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[57:04] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[57:07] anoint thine eyes with isav that thou
[57:10] mayest see how many's ever had that
[57:12] matter in your eyes you know you wake up
[57:14] and you can hardly get your eyes open
[57:16] you had that sometimes it happens in the
[57:18] in the in this time of the year and you
[57:20] and you have to have it washed off it
[57:23] takes a nice hot cloth and that's what
[57:25] the Holy Spirit comes to do is to remove
[57:27] the matter whatever it is that where we
[57:30] can't see clearly straightly the Holy
[57:33] Spirit comes to anoint our eyes now
[57:35] notice as many as I love I rebuke and
[57:39] chasen be zelous therefore and
[57:43] repent behold I stand at the door and
[57:48] knock If any man will hear my voice and
[57:51] open the door this is personal yes he
[57:55] stands and he knocks at the door and if
[57:58] any man hear my voice so it's hearing
[58:01] him what he saying and it's something
[58:04] that's very personal to a life and to a
[58:07] heart I will come into him what a
[58:10] blessing and will suck with him and he
[58:13] with me and we'll have Fellowship we'll
[58:15] have communion now I want you to look at
[58:18] this brother Bram says in this message
[58:20] is your life worthy says when God sends
[58:22] the Holy Ghost and knocks at a heart
[58:24] man's door and he deliberately turns it
[58:27] down sometime he's going to turn it down
[58:30] for his last time and then you won't be
[58:33] a privileged character you can sit I
[58:36] want you to listen very carefully you
[58:38] can sit in a church and listen to the
[58:40] gospel and agree with the gospel you
[58:43] might do as much as to say I know it's
[58:46] right but never put your finger on it to
[58:49] help it yourself you just listen to it
[58:51] and say I believe it's right that's just
[58:54] sympathizing with it we don't want to be
[58:59] sympathizers brother REM said I could
[59:01] say I believe that's $110,000 that don't
[59:04] mean I got it I could say that's good
[59:07] cold water but refuse to drink it you
[59:10] know what I mean and this is eternal
[59:12] life and to refuse to do it one day
[59:17] you'll cross the line between judgment
[59:20] and mercy and then you won't have the
[59:22] privilege to come and receive it and
[59:25] this is where brother B says to you
[59:27] people that are here and I'm responsible
[59:29] and other ministers are speaking to if
[59:32] it's
[59:33] right if it's right if this message if
[59:37] this word is right we owe our whole life
[59:40] to
[59:41] it what more could you ever find that
[59:45] would be more of a benefit to you than
[59:48] to know that you can have eternal
[59:51] life you can have everything that this
[59:54] world world has as a matter of fact I
[59:56] just stood just just days ago stood in
[59:59] in a in a home that was built by one of
[1:00:02] the founding uh uh men of all the things
[1:00:05] within the nation of the the builtmore
[1:00:07] home and stood there walking through
[1:00:09] that massive structure and looking at it
[1:00:11] but you look it's the emptiness at the
[1:00:14] end of the day where all of this has
[1:00:16] been uh built by the Vanderbilts and all
[1:00:18] that and at the end of the day where and
[1:00:21] all what does it really matter right
[1:00:25] it's a structure that's just a memory
[1:00:27] that somebody built and and somebody
[1:00:29] made a right decision of investment and
[1:00:32] all of that they profited in this world
[1:00:34] but when it came down to their soul and
[1:00:37] it came down for the real purpose that
[1:00:39] God had them here upon this life they
[1:00:42] missed
[1:00:44] it hallu they missed
[1:00:49] it you see eternal life is not about
[1:00:52] what you can do it's about accepting
[1:00:54] what God has already done for
[1:00:58] you the Rich Young Ruler he came face to
[1:01:02] face with the person of eternal life and
[1:01:04] a matter of fact he knew he needed
[1:01:06] something he knew he lacked something
[1:01:09] and yet he was keeping all of the Ten
[1:01:12] Commandments but when he stood there
[1:01:14] face to face with the Lord Jesus and he
[1:01:17] he knew this is where I need to get to I
[1:01:20] I need to get here this is who I need to
[1:01:22] talk to this is who has the answer for
[1:01:25] my life and when the answer came it
[1:01:28] touched an area in his life that he
[1:01:32] loved
[1:01:37] more God did not override what he loved
[1:01:43] right he was given an
[1:01:46] opportunity and he turned around and he
[1:01:49] walked away
[1:01:53] sorrowful what a decision you know the
[1:01:55] later account of that man is he lifted
[1:01:57] up his eyes in hell he thought
[1:01:59] differently
[1:02:01] then in Hell the Bible says in the Book
[1:02:04] of Job it's nakedness there ain't no
[1:02:07] such thing as buddies in Hell there
[1:02:09] ain't no such thing as family getting
[1:02:11] together in hell every man is naked
[1:02:13] there's no clevering in other words
[1:02:15] there's nothing to hide behind man knows
[1:02:18] oh my how did I get here I've sinned
[1:02:21] away my day of
[1:02:23] Grace and that Rich Young Ruler you say
[1:02:25] brother Samuel I don't think we should
[1:02:27] preach that way that's the
[1:02:29] bible let me just tell you just as sure
[1:02:32] as there's a heaven there's a hell
[1:02:35] there's a heaven to gain and a hell to
[1:02:39] lose we don't we don't want to go we
[1:02:42] don't want to go that way the Bible says
[1:02:44] in the Book of Proverbs that the her
[1:02:47] ways the ways to hell they are a steady
[1:02:53] decline right we don't want to go that
[1:02:55] way
[1:02:57] no but notice and I want to just say it
[1:03:00] in this way and I'm just I'm just going
[1:03:02] to take my moment just times on this
[1:03:04] right here within the few moments that I
[1:03:05] have before me every your walk and our
[1:03:08] walk with God is not a collective
[1:03:13] Affair in your family it's between you
[1:03:17] and God as an
[1:03:20] individual are you hearing me it's not
[1:03:23] we're not going go in upon one upon
[1:03:25] another even the prophet speaking just
[1:03:27] hear it again the other day when he's
[1:03:29] talking even of his children he's not
[1:03:31] granting even his children to pass right
[1:03:34] he said they've got to be filled with
[1:03:36] the same spirit of God have the same
[1:03:38] experience that I and their mother have
[1:03:41] so it's not just well I love brother
[1:03:42] brandom I'm going that's improper
[1:03:45] placement that's right Amen to really
[1:03:47] love in the right way is to see and
[1:03:50] recognize that it's Christ and you are
[1:03:53] in love with Christ Christ because a man
[1:03:56] did not die for you it was not his blood
[1:03:58] that was shed for you that's why the pro
[1:04:01] that's why the word could say if you
[1:04:03] receive a prophet in the name
[1:04:06] characteristic of a prophet you receive
[1:04:08] a prophet's reward if you receive a
[1:04:11] righteous man in the name of a righteous
[1:04:13] man you receive a righteous man's reward
[1:04:17] is that
[1:04:18] right you see those are uncertain
[1:04:21] grounds those are things that are just
[1:04:22] tossed up in the air I don't want we
[1:04:24] don't want want to take our chances
[1:04:25] that's not listen for for a a a a desire
[1:04:29] within a seed of God there is something
[1:04:31] that you yourself cannot rest on
[1:04:34] anything that's uncertain because there
[1:04:36] is something in you that come from God
[1:04:39] that the only place that you find rest
[1:04:42] and where your Authority and your
[1:04:43] confidence is in the word of God and
[1:04:46] when you see your life Dev tailing with
[1:04:49] the word of God there a certain
[1:04:52] place why cuz you're part of
[1:04:55] him so it's an individual
[1:04:58] Affair this is why the Bible could say
[1:05:00] two will be in the bed one taken one
[1:05:04] left right it's a it's an individual
[1:05:08] Affair now I do believe collectively we
[1:05:11] are baptized individually and we are a
[1:05:14] part of the body of Jesus
[1:05:18] Christ so a Christian Christian's not a
[1:05:22] tool the prophet would reference said
[1:05:24] like this it's not a a tool of some
[1:05:27] mechanical organization but he said a
[1:05:30] Christian is to be Christlike and a
[1:05:34] Christian cannot be a Christian until
[1:05:37] Christ comes into the man and the life
[1:05:40] of Christ in him then it produces the
[1:05:44] life that Christ lived and you do the
[1:05:46] things that Christ did now watch just
[1:05:49] how very simple he says this he says
[1:05:51] what am I talking about is a personal
[1:05:53] relationship to
[1:05:55] Christ and what is it is your life
[1:05:58] worthy of the
[1:06:00] Gospel now even a relationship itself
[1:06:03] when we think of that word a
[1:06:05] relationship it's where where you have
[1:06:08] two or more uh objects people so forth
[1:06:13] that are connected but there's a way of
[1:06:15] being
[1:06:15] connected when God speaks of a
[1:06:18] relationship he's speaking of himself
[1:06:22] dwelling in US amen remember the Bible
[1:06:26] says many Matthew 7 will come to me on
[1:06:29] that day and say have we not preached in
[1:06:32] thy name cast out devils in thy name
[1:06:36] spoke with tongues and he will say
[1:06:38] depart from me you workers of iniquity I
[1:06:43] never knew you never had a
[1:06:48] relationship yet they were Anointed with
[1:06:51] a genuine spirit of God but they never
[1:06:54] submitted to it right so a
[1:06:58] relationship is like when you think of
[1:07:00] it and I please bear with me a moment
[1:07:03] but you know there's sometimes where
[1:07:05] there's things uh uh parts of your body
[1:07:08] that you can lose as you age or an
[1:07:10] accident so let's say somebody loses a
[1:07:12] leg well then you know thankfully they
[1:07:15] have things now that they can give you a
[1:07:17] prosthetic leg and you can put that on
[1:07:19] but that leg is not a part of you you
[1:07:22] can take that leg off and lay it
[1:07:24] down it's something that if you decide I
[1:07:27] want to go to the kitchen and leave that
[1:07:28] in there or whatever more or for anybody
[1:07:30] that has false teeth you can take them
[1:07:33] out and just leave them there in the
[1:07:34] bathroom or next to your bed and go
[1:07:36] anywhere you want but you don't do that
[1:07:38] with your teeth that's come in
[1:07:41] you you can't do that with your leg your
[1:07:44] original leg wherever you go it's there
[1:07:48] so it's not just connected because
[1:07:50] connected things can be laid down or
[1:07:53] laid as side but the Bible said the
[1:07:55] marriage of the Lamb has come it is a
[1:08:00] union in other words it's not what we
[1:08:02] take off and put on but there is a
[1:08:06] union we don't want to just be the false
[1:08:09] teeth we don't want to just be the tupe
[1:08:12] or the prostetic leg we want to be a
[1:08:15] member of his body by spiritual birth
[1:08:19] and the Bible says by one Spirit we are
[1:08:22] all baptized into this
[1:08:25] body is that right so this is where the
[1:08:29] Lord Jesus as he would speak of the
[1:08:32] coming of the Holy Spirit he would spend
[1:08:35] the time to express to the Believers of
[1:08:39] what was coming in John 14:15 he says if
[1:08:42] you love me keep my Commandments and I
[1:08:45] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:08:48] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:08:50] with you forever don't you see if you
[1:08:52] love me and this is to to me what is
[1:08:54] incredible because this love right here
[1:08:56] is not our love and yet his love coming
[1:09:00] fully in is the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:03] Ghost but you know for you and I to even
[1:09:06] move in the direction of the word and to
[1:09:09] even repent it has to be his love
[1:09:12] reaching out and influencing us for us
[1:09:16] to recognize not just that I'm wrong
[1:09:19] he's right he's what I want he's my
[1:09:21] desire if you love me keep my
[1:09:24] commandments so it's God working to
[1:09:27] bring his children to their rightful
[1:09:29] place and as think of this as you're
[1:09:32] yielding to the spirit of God it doesn't
[1:09:35] matter it doesn't matter right now where
[1:09:36] you're at here this morning but if
[1:09:38] you'll take this consolation what
[1:09:40] matters is is keep moving in the word
[1:09:42] and as you're moving in the word the
[1:09:44] spirit of God is interceding on your
[1:09:47] behalf I will pray the comforter
[1:09:51] Hallelujah my my my my my
[1:09:54] and he may abide with you forever even
[1:09:57] the spirit of Truth so notice he's the
[1:09:59] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:10:02] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:10:04] knoweth him but you know him for he
[1:10:06] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:10:08] there he was standing in a Corporal body
[1:10:12] identifying himself as the god of Truth
[1:10:15] the spirit of Truth and he says in verse
[1:10:17] 26 the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:20] whom the father will send in my name he
[1:10:23] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:10:25] things to your remembrance and
[1:10:27] whatsoever I have said unto you this is
[1:10:30] what he becomes he not only guides you
[1:10:33] into a place and brings you to a place
[1:10:36] of birth but then he will teach you and
[1:10:40] guide you and he will work in your life
[1:10:42] to bring you from infancy into full
[1:10:46] maturity we have received the spirit of
[1:10:50] adoption which leads us to full sunship
[1:10:54] amen hallelujah hallelujah it's the
[1:10:58] privilege of having the tutor within us
[1:11:02] verse 26 of John 15 when the comforter
[1:11:05] is come whom I will send unto you from
[1:11:08] the father even the spirit of Truth
[1:11:10] which proceedeth from the father he
[1:11:11] shall testify of me and in verse 27 and
[1:11:15] ye also shall bear witness because you
[1:11:17] have been with me from the beginning So
[1:11:20] Not only would those who were chosen
[1:11:22] ordained with Witnesses when the
[1:11:24] resurrection would come and the life of
[1:11:27] the comforter the spirit of truth that
[1:11:29] was dwelling in behind the veil of the
[1:11:33] Corporal body almighty God would now
[1:11:36] come into their lives and their lives
[1:11:39] would also be a witness and a testimony
[1:11:43] by the transformation in their lives
[1:11:46] that the sacrifice the atonement has
[1:11:49] been made I was included and I have
[1:11:53] received the necessary Authority and
[1:11:56] power to rise as a son and daughter of
[1:11:59] God you become a witness in this hour
[1:12:02] the spirit of God coming to you is a
[1:12:04] present day witness of the mercy of God
[1:12:08] you become a present day witness of that
[1:12:11] day on
[1:12:13] Calvary
[1:12:17] hallelujah hallelujah John 16:13 I know
[1:12:21] these might seem redundant but Jesus
[1:12:22] spent much time because this was the
[1:12:25] purpose that he came for is to restore
[1:12:28] that relationship between God and
[1:12:32] man hallelujah how be it when he the
[1:12:35] spirit of Truth has come this is what
[1:12:36] he'll do he will guide you into all
[1:12:39] truth hallelujah for he shall speak of
[1:12:41] himself and whatsoever he shall hear
[1:12:44] that shall he speak and he'll show you
[1:12:46] things to come he shall glorify me for
[1:12:49] he shall receive of mine and shall show
[1:12:51] it unto you so he will not glorify an
[1:12:55] idea he will not glorify a Creed he will
[1:12:58] not glorify our ideas he will only
[1:13:01] glorify himself and he is the
[1:13:04] word all things that the father hath our
[1:13:07] mind therefore said I that he shall take
[1:13:10] of mine and shall show it unto you so to
[1:13:13] live a worthy life of the Gospel is to
[1:13:17] live a life where it is absolutely
[1:13:22] displaying God's own life amen where
[1:13:25] it's no longer I that liveth but Christ
[1:13:29] that liveth in
[1:13:32] me this is why the prophet could say the
[1:13:34] only way to live a worthy life how many
[1:13:37] want to live a worthy
[1:13:38] life
[1:13:40] okay is to let Christ notice to let
[1:13:44] Christ and his word which he is the word
[1:13:47] reflect itself so perfect in you till
[1:13:51] God vindicates what he said in the word
[1:13:53] for Christ died that he might present
[1:13:56] himself before God a sacrifice and it
[1:14:00] returned back in the form of the Holy
[1:14:02] Spirit to reflect his through his people
[1:14:07] to carry on his work reflecting himself
[1:14:10] through you to fulfill his promised word
[1:14:13] in these Future Days so the only way
[1:14:17] that we can live a worthy life to me and
[1:14:21] I believe to the rest of us
[1:14:23] i i i rejoice in this because it's not
[1:14:27] my worthiness it's his worthiness and I
[1:14:31] don't say that Loosely we we should
[1:14:33] understand it's not said Loosely that we
[1:14:35] just go and live any life that we want
[1:14:37] to live that's that shows you haven't
[1:14:39] received God's grace when you've
[1:14:41] received God's grace then you are so
[1:14:44] appreciative of what he has done for you
[1:14:47] and done in your life that you gladly
[1:14:49] want to please him and do what he said
[1:14:52] do because the grace you received is the
[1:14:55] comforter is the spirit of truth you're
[1:14:58] no longer left as an orphan amen you're
[1:15:01] no longer left in a state of wondering
[1:15:04] but the spirit of God has come down and
[1:15:07] claimed you as one of his
[1:15:09] own Hallelujah and the spirit of Truth
[1:15:13] is there as the grace of God to lead us
[1:15:16] and direct us into all the word and I'm
[1:15:20] not just talking about the Mysteries I'm
[1:15:23] talking about every purpose and all that
[1:15:26] God desires to bring forth out of your
[1:15:28] life amen because it's a personal
[1:15:34] relationship is that
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:39] Hallelujah so here there's no other way
[1:15:42] a Christian of today is to receive
[1:15:44] Christ into our lives amen let his word
[1:15:48] be the truth place it in our heart and
[1:15:50] and that the fruit of the spirit upon us
[1:15:53] and fulfilling every promise that he's
[1:15:55] made because he don't have no other
[1:15:58] hands but your hands and mine he don't
[1:16:00] have no other feet but our feet the
[1:16:01] Bible said he said I'm the vine you're
[1:16:03] the branches so I want to just say it to
[1:16:06] you like this I've taken a little bit of
[1:16:08] a of a journey to get here even to let
[1:16:11] lay down my title that don't mean I'm
[1:16:12] going to be much longer but what I want
[1:16:15] to lay down to you is just the thought
[1:16:17] of priorities and excuses right and I
[1:16:21] want to speak just a few moments on that
[1:16:23] of priorities and excuses now that's not
[1:16:26] I I I just I had to lay some of that in
[1:16:28] before I would give it and I want to
[1:16:29] just say this right here in this hour we
[1:16:31] are living in a time just as down
[1:16:34] Through the Ages but in this hour here
[1:16:38] we I'm not responsible and neither are
[1:16:40] you for for for back there in isua
[1:16:42] Street Pentecost I'm not responsible for
[1:16:45] Wesley back there or or Luther but what
[1:16:48] we are responsible for is the message
[1:16:51] that has come in our day in our
[1:16:54] generation and the message itself is not
[1:16:57] books it's not tapes but the message is
[1:17:00] Christ
[1:17:02] himself it's him coming in and producing
[1:17:05] and living out his own life because the
[1:17:08] Church of the Living God you and I are
[1:17:10] the womb of allmighty God that betting
[1:17:14] ground that his word will find that's
[1:17:16] ferle in this hour that will not kill
[1:17:19] his working that will not kill his word
[1:17:22] that will not abort his ways but a womb
[1:17:25] that will say Lord let my life bring
[1:17:28] forth Jesus
[1:17:30] Christ I don't want to alter him I don't
[1:17:33] want a surgery before it's born and
[1:17:35] somehow alter this DNA I want to Bear
[1:17:40] Jesus
[1:17:44] Christ just in a density just in
[1:17:46] incidentally so you would understand
[1:17:48] even in this that's not a onot deal and
[1:17:51] done that's an ongoing desire in the
[1:17:54] life and a relationship between a
[1:17:56] husband and a wife that's why the
[1:17:58] prophet could stand at the end of the
[1:18:00] Statue of a perfect man he said I pledge
[1:18:03] this morning until he said I will see
[1:18:05] every one of these virtues moving
[1:18:08] through this little old stature of mine
[1:18:10] he said I don't care if I don't maintain
[1:18:12] my house don't maintain my family don't
[1:18:14] maintain my job he said there's one
[1:18:16] thing I want to maintain and that's
[1:18:19] Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ
[1:18:21] Hallelujah I'm telling you this message
[1:18:25] was delivered with an
[1:18:30] urgency a
[1:18:33] relationship it's a priority am there's
[1:18:36] a lot of things we can make
[1:18:39] priorities but when it comes down to it
[1:18:41] what really matters is is looking at
[1:18:44] have we made God's priority our
[1:18:48] priority that's what matters we have a
[1:18:51] choice then the and the priority is in
[1:18:54] this hour is the
[1:18:56] rapture that's the priority for my life
[1:18:59] that's the priority for my family that's
[1:19:02] the priority for this
[1:19:03] church Brother Sam you ought to let up a
[1:19:06] little bit I can't it's burning in my
[1:19:08] heart the priority of this
[1:19:12] hour
[1:19:14] hallu I might have to step on your toes
[1:19:17] but say out show me thank you Lord God
[1:19:20] for dealing with my life
[1:19:23] we don't want to become a soft easy lazy
[1:19:27] Lal seeing group of people
[1:19:31] am that even though everything that
[1:19:33] takes place is they're worked up into a
[1:19:35] frenzy or they're given some
[1:19:37] intellectual pet talk to massage the
[1:19:40] psyche of their mind you need something
[1:19:43] that will resonate in the depths of your
[1:19:45] soul and'll change your life from Death
[1:19:49] To Life it'll give you a backbone it'll
[1:19:52] give you a hire in your life to please
[1:19:54] the Lord and to serve the Lord that's
[1:19:57] what this supper does
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:00] [Music]
[1:20:05] hall
[1:20:06] hallelujah hallelujah we don't want
[1:20:10] forms forms of
[1:20:14] godliness Hallelujah I want to just let
[1:20:16] me read this quote to you the message
[1:20:18] love this I've just been meditating on
[1:20:20] this one for
[1:20:21] weeks
[1:20:25] love it's got to be God's love friends
[1:20:28] it can't it listen it can't be just our
[1:20:31] love our love will not our love will
[1:20:34] never meet the Mark it's got to take
[1:20:36] God's love and the only way that comes
[1:20:38] is by the Holy Ghost and the only way
[1:20:41] that that love comes to the place that
[1:20:43] God ordained it to be is through US
[1:20:45] submitting to even when we have received
[1:20:47] it and asking God and yielding to that
[1:20:50] word until it comes to a complete
[1:20:52] perfection in
[1:20:54] us are you hearing
[1:20:56] me look at this love makes you do things
[1:21:00] and when the church gets the real love
[1:21:01] of God in their heart they'll do things
[1:21:03] they'll not be ashamed watch this Christ
[1:21:06] doesn't want you know he he he's it's
[1:21:08] not so much to be loyal I want you to
[1:21:10] listen these words Christ is not after
[1:21:12] to you be to be loyal he doesn't want
[1:21:14] your
[1:21:16] patronage I think brother Dan daisley
[1:21:19] he's gone home to be with the Lord but I
[1:21:20] never forget the statements he would
[1:21:22] make you know brother Dan they had
[1:21:23] Wednesday night service and two on
[1:21:25] Sunday and brother Dan said you know he
[1:21:27] said the the people he says that U you
[1:21:30] know that love love the church come on
[1:21:33] Sunday morning the people he said that
[1:21:35] love the pastor come on Sunday night and
[1:21:38] the people who love God come on
[1:21:44] Wednesday come on
[1:21:46] now oh brother Samuel you know all we
[1:21:49] need to do is show our stand for the
[1:21:50] resurrection you're not following the
[1:21:53] word there's too many quotes when the
[1:21:55] prophet talks about laying out a church
[1:21:57] and missing church he talks about when
[1:21:59] other things get ahead of the prayer
[1:22:03] meeting come on oh Sam I don't want
[1:22:06] watch I Love Lucy good I hope you don't
[1:22:09] watch Susie either but anything you put
[1:22:13] before the word of God and assembling
[1:22:16] yourselves together is a priority that's
[1:22:19] out of line that's right now I want you
[1:22:22] to understand listen friends because
[1:22:24] there's some things we can make certain
[1:22:25] modifications we oh you know I'm let's
[1:22:28] just say about that about coming to the
[1:22:29] house of God oh I I really got to start
[1:22:31] coming to the house of God but you got
[1:22:33] to see there's a symptom what is it that
[1:22:35] has caused that or allowed you to get to
[1:22:38] that place to where it doesn't matter if
[1:22:40] you're here or not you don't care and
[1:22:42] you can say well I'll catch it later on
[1:22:44] I'll archive it you need to look at a
[1:22:47] symptom don't just look at what's here
[1:22:51] what is it is there something in my life
[1:22:54] that I haven't received is it something
[1:22:56] that I've left my first
[1:23:01] love it's evaluation
[1:23:04] time well just think in a little bit
[1:23:07] we'll be able to shake hands over
[1:23:08] [Laughter]
[1:23:13] dinner I love the Simplicity I love the
[1:23:16] Simplicity of this
[1:23:17] statement it isn't so much to be loyal
[1:23:20] he don't want your patronage
[1:23:26] now I believe if there's something in
[1:23:27] your heart you'll be loyal to Christ but
[1:23:29] it's not just being loyal to a church
[1:23:32] it's being loyal to him even when you're
[1:23:34] outside of
[1:23:36] church in every situation you're loyal
[1:23:39] to him because I am his witness I am his
[1:23:46] representative the longer you serve God
[1:23:48] the more mindful you become of that
[1:23:50] that's part of maturity in your life
[1:23:52] that's right that's why there's certain
[1:23:53] things that you watch as you'll submit
[1:23:55] God can correct you even on certain
[1:23:57] things things maybe from the job or this
[1:23:59] or that but you what you say well God
[1:24:01] corrected me listen the only one that
[1:24:03] can be corrected is the spirit of
[1:24:06] God if it's not a child of God it'll
[1:24:09] Buck at it and kick back at it and well
[1:24:10] you don't understand what they done to
[1:24:12] me you don't understand this but if it's
[1:24:14] a child of God when the spirit of God
[1:24:16] points out wrong it doesn't matter who's
[1:24:18] done wrong they might have been wrong
[1:24:19] wrong is wrong but if the spirit of God
[1:24:22] it out there is a heart on the inside
[1:24:25] and the spirit of Truth has brought
[1:24:27] forth a child a lamb that's able to be
[1:24:31] led he know he want this is what he
[1:24:34] wants your
[1:24:36] fellowship that's what God wants us to
[1:24:39] have fellowship with
[1:24:41] you that's what that's what his desire
[1:24:44] is that's
[1:24:45] right let me just look at this just for
[1:24:47] a few moments here on excuses you know
[1:24:50] what an excuse is
[1:24:54] sometimes we look for
[1:24:56] them now let me just so I can ease you a
[1:24:59] little bit sometimes if we don't want to
[1:25:02] go
[1:25:03] somewhere oh my
[1:25:06] oh I see there snow coming in the
[1:25:10] forecast go I I I think it's probably
[1:25:14] best that I don't
[1:25:17] go but you see that becomes an excuse
[1:25:21] but that's not the real reason that's
[1:25:24] only a covering for the real
[1:25:29] reason when the Lord Jesus is speaking
[1:25:31] of this Parable let's just look at it
[1:25:34] here for a moment they were being
[1:25:36] invited Israel was being invited to a
[1:25:38] spiritual Feast Pentecost they were
[1:25:41] being invited to the place to where God
[1:25:45] the spirit of Truth would Unite with man
[1:25:49] in a real Union and they rejected it is
[1:25:54] that right they turned it down notice
[1:25:58] the prophet has says how that they
[1:25:59] turned down the spiritual Feast Brianna
[1:26:01] go to that uh quote 39 there and I'm
[1:26:03] just going to read the last part if I
[1:26:05] the last part on there where I have
[1:26:06] those asteris notice he says they the
[1:26:09] spiritual Feast of the Lord and they
[1:26:10] won't do it they don't want to do it
[1:26:13] that's that's the first thing it it they
[1:26:16] don't want to do it they've got other
[1:26:18] things to do and they find excuses so
[1:26:21] they have other things things and they
[1:26:23] prioritize that over what's the most
[1:26:27] important
[1:26:29] thing notice if they would have accepted
[1:26:32] brother Bram goes on to say if they
[1:26:33] would have just accepted that but he
[1:26:36] says then 2000 years ago Israel turned
[1:26:39] down the invitation to come to the
[1:26:41] wedding supper they turned it down and
[1:26:42] went into judgment but as Jesus said
[1:26:45] they stoned and killed the prophets that
[1:26:46] was sent to him by making excuses and
[1:26:50] now the excuses they made in each day so
[1:26:54] the influencer of excuses has never
[1:26:57] stopped it's still
[1:27:00] there and I want to just say there's
[1:27:02] nothing more important than the day of
[1:27:04] visitation of the word of God there's
[1:27:08] nothing I I can say this very clearly
[1:27:10] there's nothing in your life right now
[1:27:13] that's more important than entertaining
[1:27:16] Jesus
[1:27:17] Christ nothing is more important there
[1:27:20] no matter what it might be nothing is
[1:27:23] more important than entertaining him
[1:27:27] Hallelujah this is why when the Bible
[1:27:30] could say of a certain man you know here
[1:27:33] in in Luke 9 I I'm just going to have to
[1:27:35] phrase to these paraphrase some of these
[1:27:38] he said Lord I'll follow you wheresoever
[1:27:40] you go Jesus said the foxes have holes
[1:27:42] birds of the air have Nest but the son
[1:27:44] of man hath not where to lay his head
[1:27:46] and another said follow me and he said
[1:27:48] to another follow me but he said Lord
[1:27:50] suffer me first to go and bury my father
[1:27:53] Jesus said let the dead bury the bad
[1:27:55] dead but go thou and preach the kingdom
[1:27:57] of God my Lord it sounds like he don't
[1:28:01] care it's
[1:28:02] deeper he's letting them know don't let
[1:28:05] put
[1:28:07] anything before obedience to the voice
[1:28:10] of
[1:28:11] God no matter how close the tie is
[1:28:15] another said Lord I'll follow thee but
[1:28:17] let me first go bid them farewell which
[1:28:19] are at home at my house and Jesus Jesus
[1:28:22] said no man having put his hand to the
[1:28:25] plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:28:27] kingdom of
[1:28:30] God it's there's only one way it's
[1:28:33] forward and when the Lord Jesus is
[1:28:36] expressing this right here you if you
[1:28:39] read in the T days of Elisha remember in
[1:28:41] the days of Elisha Elisha it looks very
[1:28:44] much that it's it's contrasting this
[1:28:46] scripture right here because in the days
[1:28:48] of Elisha he you know he he burnt
[1:28:50] everything he burnt the plow and
[1:28:52] everything else then he offered up The
[1:28:53] Oxen and then he went and followed but
[1:28:56] it's saying the same thing don't let
[1:28:59] anything be undone don't let anything
[1:29:03] hinder you in obeying the
[1:29:08] Lord
[1:29:10] hallelujah you know these things right
[1:29:13] here we've read even in the opening part
[1:29:15] of the supper you know I've got oxen I
[1:29:18] need to break in I've got a piece of
[1:29:19] land I need to get ready I've just
[1:29:21] married
[1:29:22] wife there a lot of scriptures these
[1:29:24] individuals could could even pull up
[1:29:26] places from the Old Testament but I want
[1:29:28] to just tell you that there is none of
[1:29:31] these things even what we read here a
[1:29:33] person's father died and he wants to go
[1:29:35] bury him a person that you know let me
[1:29:38] go let me just go tell the people in my
[1:29:40] home farewell you can look at that and
[1:29:42] say what's evil about
[1:29:44] that there's nothing evil about it are
[1:29:48] you hearing me now there's nothing evil
[1:29:51] about it it is isn't altogether evil but
[1:29:53] it is something that is getting in the
[1:29:55] way of obeying
[1:29:58] God in Luke chapter 17 the day we're
[1:30:01] living in right here in this hour as a
[1:30:04] compound hour as it was in the days of
[1:30:08] lot right as it was in the days of Noah
[1:30:11] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[1:30:13] of man is that right what did they do
[1:30:16] they did eat and they drink now you know
[1:30:19] there's nothing wrong with the eating
[1:30:20] and drinking you you've got to have
[1:30:22] certain Necessities to sustain your life
[1:30:24] is that right and they builded houses
[1:30:27] they married wasn't nothing wrong with
[1:30:29] somebody getting married although they
[1:30:31] did have the given in marriage right
[1:30:34] right living as though they were married
[1:30:36] which is wrong it's sin is that right
[1:30:40] that's called fornication living outside
[1:30:43] of the marriage covenant my my how do we
[1:30:46] get here that's why listen this is why
[1:30:49] that we do not believe in that and
[1:30:51] according to to God's word that is the
[1:30:53] Bible said it's not good for a man to
[1:30:55] touch a
[1:30:57] woman that's why we don't kiss around be
[1:31:00] the first kiss is right here at the
[1:31:02] altar come on now we don't try one
[1:31:05] another out and see if we can kiss good
[1:31:08] I'm going to preach it wrong we're not
[1:31:10] here to treat and see about this and
[1:31:12] let's see if this works out come on
[1:31:14] friends that's the way the world does
[1:31:16] things but you have an access to pray
[1:31:19] and ask God for his will for you
[1:31:22] [Music]
[1:31:23] life because if you've really been
[1:31:26] redeemed you don't want your own choice
[1:31:28] you want God's
[1:31:31] choice because anything outside of that
[1:31:34] of living any other kind of life is a
[1:31:36] life of
[1:31:41] fornication Hallelujah now look at the
[1:31:45] days of lot they ate drank bought sold
[1:31:47] planted builded verse 28 they you know
[1:31:51] those things are not not allog together
[1:31:54] evil but what it is they become occupied
[1:31:58] with the cares of
[1:32:02] Life they were so occupied that God's
[1:32:06] day of visitation and their opportunity
[1:32:08] went right by
[1:32:11] them they were so wrapped up in I wonder
[1:32:14] how many of them said you know what next
[1:32:17] weekend I'm going to make some
[1:32:19] preparation but then something would
[1:32:21] come up oh this field oh this field
[1:32:24] what's going on Weeds are coming up
[1:32:26] that's called
[1:32:28] distractions that's called putting that
[1:32:31] when that priority becomes above the
[1:32:34] priority of obeying God's word don't
[1:32:36] ever expect the crop to
[1:32:39] flourish you can't go disobedient to
[1:32:42] God's word and expect the crop to
[1:32:46] flourish is that all
[1:32:48] right well the amens are getting fewer
[1:32:51] and fewer
[1:32:54] but even thus shall it be when the son
[1:32:56] of man is revealed notice let me just
[1:32:59] say it like this when we when we look at
[1:33:01] this of Disobedience there is an order
[1:33:04] there is an order of priority and the
[1:33:06] prophet would say this clear I believe
[1:33:08] from 1959 he would pick it up in 1963
[1:33:11] again and tell us that the order of
[1:33:14] overcoming is God
[1:33:18] first that's just not our thought but
[1:33:20] that's his word my heart says Amen to
[1:33:23] every word of God it's not making
[1:33:26] excuses or exceptions for the word of
[1:33:29] God Oho boy this is
[1:33:33] tight I can go
[1:33:36] slower that's first the second is family
[1:33:41] and
[1:33:42] others and your last selfish laugh
[1:33:45] that's the order of overcoming because
[1:33:47] that's what he did think of the Lord
[1:33:50] Jesus God come down and become one of us
[1:33:53] he put obedience to the father's word
[1:33:56] above everything else when they told him
[1:33:59] Lazarus has died come on down here he
[1:34:01] wouldn't go until he had the word from
[1:34:04] the father even when John said hey I
[1:34:07] need to be baptized to you he said
[1:34:09] suffer it to be so it becometh us to
[1:34:13] fulfill all
[1:34:16] righteousness he put the word of God
[1:34:19] first when he was tempted and was hungry
[1:34:21] turn these stones in the bread he put
[1:34:23] God's word before his own
[1:34:28] desires are you with me now then when in
[1:34:31] that would not stick he's taken upon a
[1:34:33] temple and he said cast thyself down in
[1:34:36] other words offered Supernatural
[1:34:40] gifts but he took the father's word amen
[1:34:44] that's the truth come on now he took the
[1:34:47] father's word now let me move to the
[1:34:50] second place the family he put his
[1:34:52] family he put the family of God not
[1:34:54] above the word of God but he put the
[1:34:56] family next he put others next he even
[1:34:58] looked upon the multitude that were
[1:34:59] hungry and said we need to feed him he
[1:35:01] looked at the ones who were sick those
[1:35:03] who were there when he came down to the
[1:35:04] pool of Bethesda and he stepped over
[1:35:07] this one this one this one to get to
[1:35:08] that man that laid there he put others
[1:35:10] before
[1:35:13] himself he was
[1:35:15] last so much so that the greatest
[1:35:17] victory that was won was in Gethsemane
[1:35:20] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:35:22] done and he did that that we might be
[1:35:25] partakers of his
[1:35:31] life the Bible said remember Lot's wife
[1:35:34] look at these words Luke 17:32 three
[1:35:37] words remember Lot's wife so Jesus wants
[1:35:39] us to remember something now one of the
[1:35:43] things that's
[1:35:44] very interesting within it even when you
[1:35:46] read Scholars and different things like
[1:35:48] that is within it because when you
[1:35:50] remember she would they were given a
[1:35:53] word to depart and lot lot could have
[1:35:57] went anywhere you realize this lot could
[1:36:00] have went anywhere lot could have said I
[1:36:02] want to go back down to where my uncle's
[1:36:04] at but he left from where his uncle was
[1:36:07] at you know why it was too straight it
[1:36:11] was too hard he didn't want to live that
[1:36:14] way he didn't want his family brought
[1:36:16] under I don't want my family brought
[1:36:18] under that judgment I don't want to be
[1:36:21] judged listen if the word comes to judge
[1:36:24] something in our lives it's for our
[1:36:28] good amen we'll either allow the
[1:36:31] Judgment of the word to pass upon our
[1:36:33] life now or we'll stand there on that
[1:36:36] day and have to answer why we spurned
[1:36:40] the spirit of
[1:36:43] Grace I want you to think of this lot if
[1:36:46] you could talk to him
[1:36:47] today lot did you realize what it was
[1:36:50] going to cost
[1:36:52] you when you made that decision and said
[1:36:55] this is too
[1:36:58] much this is this is too much I mean
[1:37:01] here we are Barren land all this is
[1:37:03] around here what's he doing relying on
[1:37:06] reasoning and you know what when you
[1:37:08] want to find something listen to me very
[1:37:10] carefully that's why if you don't come
[1:37:13] to a place of a real birth in Jesus
[1:37:15] Christ you'll find somewhere you'll find
[1:37:18] some church you'll find some theology
[1:37:20] that'll fit
[1:37:22] what you
[1:37:25] desire you'll find
[1:37:27] it but I want to thank lot I wonder if
[1:37:30] we could talk to him today lot what
[1:37:34] happened I just started out with facing
[1:37:36] my tent in the wrong
[1:37:38] way before I know it I'm the mayor in
[1:37:41] I'm the mayor in
[1:37:43] Sodom you see sin will overtake you just
[1:37:45] like that you don't have limiters on it
[1:37:48] it's not like the microphone that they
[1:37:49] have compressors on me limiters on how
[1:37:52] much can come out it's not how it is sin
[1:37:54] you can't limit it sin you can't control
[1:37:58] it there's only one thing and that's to
[1:38:00] receive and yield to the spirit of God
[1:38:03] on the
[1:38:06] inside remember Lot's wife what did she
[1:38:09] do they were told and lot didn't say let
[1:38:12] me go down to my uncles he said let me
[1:38:13] go over here over to or is it zone or
[1:38:16] zor let me go over here actually means a
[1:38:18] land of
[1:38:20] wandering let me go over
[1:38:23] here instead of going to the place he
[1:38:25] knew he could get
[1:38:27] help sometimes people know the place
[1:38:30] they need help and they know they need
[1:38:31] help but their own Pride keeps them back
[1:38:34] from
[1:38:35] it let me tell you something that is
[1:38:38] only a trick of the enemy that pride is
[1:38:41] a awful hoty ungodly spirit that wants
[1:38:44] to keep you back from the real life that
[1:38:47] God has for
[1:38:49] you Hallelujah
[1:38:53] remember Lot's wife brother Brown tells
[1:38:55] us like this he says what she did he
[1:38:59] says lot act Lot's wife actually he said
[1:39:03] had more of an excuse than what many of
[1:39:05] us would have because she turned because
[1:39:09] she heard her children and grandchildren
[1:39:12] screaming from the
[1:39:16] Flames shows you that they had some kids
[1:39:20] that were there not just the two that
[1:39:21] went out with
[1:39:24] them what was it her family well you say
[1:39:27] brother Samuel surely surely surely you
[1:39:31] mean God would hold that if anything
[1:39:33] keeps you back from believing one word
[1:39:36] of God it can keep you out of the
[1:39:39] Rapture it'll keep you out of a
[1:39:42] Victorious Life One Word all she did was
[1:39:44] turn and look back she didn't even start
[1:39:46] walking
[1:39:48] backwards but you know what it was she
[1:39:51] started out as an overcomer she had left
[1:39:54] Sodom come out to follow the
[1:39:57] message but she never got it in her
[1:40:00] heart her heart was still tied back
[1:40:03] there and that's why she turned back
[1:40:07] listen friends this is a moment of
[1:40:09] evaluation when listen this isn't just
[1:40:11] something of saying well I need a fresh
[1:40:13] refilling of the spirit of God we do
[1:40:15] need refilling of the spirit of God but
[1:40:17] you also have to consider and look at it
[1:40:19] have I received the real necessary
[1:40:22] experience that God promised in this
[1:40:25] hour where the love of God would burn in
[1:40:28] my heart for Him and for his
[1:40:35] word oh God help us I tell you friends
[1:40:38] this is my priority yes amen I don't
[1:40:40] care if you get mad at me I don't care
[1:40:42] if you get upset at me but you'll thank
[1:40:44] me if you stand with me there on the
[1:40:46] other
[1:40:47] side Hallelujah and matter of fact
[1:40:50] you'll pray for me even right now Lord
[1:40:51] God don't let him cut no corners Lord
[1:40:53] don't let him take no ways Lord I want
[1:40:56] to stand there on that day Lord why
[1:40:58] because that's your priority my priority
[1:41:01] it's the priority that Jesus Christ
[1:41:04] would be preeminent in our
[1:41:06] lives I don't want to make excuses for
[1:41:10] it
[1:41:18] hallu this is where you have even the 10
[1:41:21] spies I'm coming
[1:41:23] down the 10 spies that went over
[1:41:26] familiar story we're here we we hear but
[1:41:28] these spies went over with Joshua and
[1:41:30] Caleb now Joshua and Caleb had just as
[1:41:32] much family as they did right but they
[1:41:34] went over there and they saw the
[1:41:36] obstacles that was before
[1:41:40] him and when they saw the
[1:41:43] obstacles immediately when they came
[1:41:46] back they brought up an evil
[1:41:49] report and when they brought up that
[1:41:52] evil report notice what they did in
[1:41:55] numbers
[1:41:56] 14 they put the blame on their
[1:42:01] families if we go over there our wives
[1:42:04] and our children are going to be
[1:42:08] prayed you know why they could say it
[1:42:10] that way because they didn't know God
[1:42:13] that's right they didn't trust God they
[1:42:16] didn't love God oh you know friends
[1:42:18] think about think about how many people
[1:42:20] listen I've long enough to hear where
[1:42:22] people say I don't want my kids around
[1:42:24] that Doom and Gloom message Doom and
[1:42:26] Gloom the coming of the Lord is upon us
[1:42:30] but you see what it is if you don't have
[1:42:32] the token yourself it's hard to believe
[1:42:35] for the supernatural for your family
[1:42:37] that's right but when you have
[1:42:39] experienced the supernatural I'm not
[1:42:41] talking about gifts I'm not talking
[1:42:43] about prophesying I'm not talking about
[1:42:45] shouting I'm talking about the
[1:42:47] supernatural that changes your nature
[1:42:50] amen that's what I'm talking about
[1:42:52] that'll align you with the word of God
[1:42:54] that'll tame you from a wild man to a
[1:42:58] lamb that's what I'm talking about
[1:43:03] amen but it's presented to every one of
[1:43:06] us and it's incredible how what they
[1:43:09] said they said let us make a captain and
[1:43:12] go back to Egypt so it wasn't that they
[1:43:13] didn't want leadership it's just they
[1:43:16] didn't want the leadership of the hour
[1:43:19] right they didn't want the leadership of
[1:43:21] the word they didn't want God's provided
[1:43:22] way you know what they forsook they
[1:43:24] forsook every blessing of God they
[1:43:26] forsook the blessing of God for their
[1:43:28] own lives and for their families they
[1:43:31] made a
[1:43:33] choice for their own
[1:43:36] desires true and they made for their own
[1:43:40] unbelief they made their families their
[1:43:46] excuse oh brother Samuel I tell you I
[1:43:49] ain't going back to this this church or
[1:43:51] I ain't going back to this church be
[1:43:52] careful that you're not making somebody
[1:43:54] else and what's happened an
[1:43:58] excuse oh brother Samuel this just this
[1:44:01] just so disappointed me this just listen
[1:44:03] to me tell you something how do you know
[1:44:04] it's an excuse you know it's an excuse
[1:44:06] whether or not your life continues to
[1:44:08] tally up with the word of God or not if
[1:44:11] it doesn't tally up with the word of God
[1:44:13] you've got a homemade
[1:44:15] excuse and it's an excuse that'll keep
[1:44:17] you from the life and it'll keep you out
[1:44:19] of the rapture the Rapture is the most
[1:44:22] important event right
[1:44:25] now and the only way going into a
[1:44:28] Rapture is to have the Seal of the
[1:44:30] Living God and when you have the Seal of
[1:44:33] the Living God you don't become a
[1:44:35] complacent bystander that's like sitting
[1:44:37] on the plane waiting for everybody else
[1:44:39] to go on remember when the spirit of God
[1:44:42] comes into your life he starts like a
[1:44:44] small white button the prophet said in
[1:44:46] this same message he said he comes into
[1:44:48] your life he said about the size of the
[1:44:49] fingernail
[1:44:51] and he
[1:44:53] grows pushing out all unbelief he pushes
[1:44:57] out and I love how the prophet says it
[1:44:59] he says the more that you can yield to
[1:45:01] the spirit of God the more you'll become
[1:45:04] unman unsner likee and the more
[1:45:09] Godlike that's the promise I will walk
[1:45:13] in my people you love
[1:45:18] him may God help us
[1:45:23] the Bible says there's a way that seeth
[1:45:25] right to man but the end thereof is the
[1:45:28] ways of death right even of times to
[1:45:31] look the Bible said a prudent man looks
[1:45:34] a far off and considers his ways the
[1:45:36] decisions made today what will it lead
[1:45:39] to
[1:45:42] tomorrow you know when that trumpet
[1:45:44] would be sounded in the land of Israel
[1:45:47] when they heard it it was their
[1:45:49] opportunity
[1:45:51] to go
[1:45:52] free now the Bible tells us and I'm
[1:45:56] closing
[1:45:57] here that if a man was come into a
[1:46:00] Hebrew servant was come into slavery
[1:46:04] because he owed a debt and if he came in
[1:46:06] there by
[1:46:08] himself he could only leave by
[1:46:10] himself but if he came in there with his
[1:46:14] wife then they both left
[1:46:19] together
[1:46:21] so whatever accumulated through that
[1:46:24] time of bondage his
[1:46:27] master would say hey here's a here's a
[1:46:31] here's a woman here's here's one could
[1:46:33] be your wife and he marries that woman
[1:46:36] while in
[1:46:37] slavery then there's children you know
[1:46:40] what the enemy is doing he's setting him
[1:46:43] up to put a hold on his
[1:46:44] life Satan listen friends if you if
[1:46:47] there is something let me just
[1:46:49] understand me if there's something
[1:46:50] something in your heart that's not moved
[1:46:51] for your family then something's wrong
[1:46:54] but if that if you allow that to
[1:46:56] determine whether you will fully obey
[1:46:58] the word of God then you're
[1:47:02] wrong are you hearing me and here here
[1:47:05] was here was the whole sound that
[1:47:08] man when the trumpet sounded he could go
[1:47:11] out but the wife that he married in
[1:47:13] there and the children brother Samuel
[1:47:15] what are you saying are that my husband
[1:47:16] or that my wife what I'm saying is is
[1:47:18] that whatever happen has come from the
[1:47:21] world cannot come into
[1:47:24] Christ can God bring a whole family in
[1:47:27] sure there's Witnesses right here but
[1:47:29] you see what the enemy will do is to put
[1:47:31] things that'll put a hold upon people
[1:47:33] how many people have you seen I know how
[1:47:35] many I know people that I've watched and
[1:47:37] witnessed even advised don't get married
[1:47:40] don't do this don't do that and they'll
[1:47:42] go ahead and do it and they're no longer
[1:47:46] here why
[1:47:48] value of a wife
[1:47:50] life or brother the Sam are you saying
[1:47:52] somebody's not I'm not saying nobody is
[1:47:54] elect or non-elect I'm just saying for
[1:47:56] right now right now is an opportunity
[1:47:58] right now is a serious moment right now
[1:48:00] for every decision that we
[1:48:03] make but to look at some how things can
[1:48:05] become such a place that would pull upon
[1:48:08] a person's heartstrings that people will
[1:48:11] actually relinquish their stand with God
[1:48:14] for
[1:48:18] flesh let me ask you how can you help
[1:48:20] your family if you're not standing where
[1:48:22] you need to
[1:48:23] stand it's like a man standing on a
[1:48:26] slippery slope and wanting to pull
[1:48:27] somebody else out that's drowned you
[1:48:29] need to get your feet on Solid Ground
[1:48:31] you need to get your life grounded in
[1:48:33] the word of God lord I I want to be a
[1:48:36] lot I want to be a help then first let
[1:48:38] your life be grounded in the things of
[1:48:40] God let God work through your life and
[1:48:43] say Lord I just want to be an instrument
[1:48:45] let God work through you then let him
[1:48:48] have the rideway let him have the all
[1:48:50] within your life let him have
[1:48:53] everything and even when it comes down
[1:48:55] to things in our life that he'll touch
[1:48:57] in our life you don't want to make
[1:49:00] excuses for it
[1:49:02] right I'm like this because my daddy
[1:49:05] that's an
[1:49:08] excuse oh brother
[1:49:10] Samuel I've heard people tell me and say
[1:49:13] brother Samuel I tell you what I you
[1:49:16] know I would come there but it's kind of
[1:49:18] hard you know for coming there because
[1:49:19] of so so and I just tell them just like
[1:49:21] the prophet said that's an excuse the
[1:49:24] prophet said when you say something like
[1:49:26] that you're more than a hypocrite then
[1:49:28] what the person who's
[1:49:31] there that's pretty straight but that's
[1:49:33] the truth you see there's no excuse
[1:49:35] there'll be no excuse accepted on that
[1:49:37] day God's not accepting any excuse right
[1:49:39] now well Lord I I would go there or I
[1:49:41] would do this or I would do that there's
[1:49:43] no excuse It's a mou between you and God
[1:49:47] it's God changing your life not your dad
[1:49:49] changing your life life not your mama
[1:49:51] changing your life it is about you and
[1:49:53] God
[1:49:55] personally and you ought to have such a
[1:49:58] Resolute that if Mama don't go if Mama
[1:50:00] don't get in line I'm going to serve
[1:50:05] God if my husband don't my wife don't
[1:50:07] whatever I'm going to serve God with all
[1:50:11] that's within
[1:50:12] me I'm going to stay there if I don't
[1:50:14] have the Holy Ghost I'm going to stay
[1:50:16] there till God fills me that's going to
[1:50:19] become my number one
[1:50:21] priority not more hours on the job more
[1:50:24] hour this more Ambitions here that's my
[1:50:26] priority to be filled with his life and
[1:50:29] when you get filled with his life then
[1:50:31] he becomes your all priority decisions
[1:50:34] you'll make then will be based upon him
[1:50:38] first
[1:50:40] am and anytime you get away from that
[1:50:43] you'll get
[1:50:49] corrected
[1:50:50] priorities and
[1:50:52] excuses we want to have the right
[1:50:54] priorities
[1:50:58] right well brother Samuel I've got a job
[1:51:00] or I've got let me tell you something
[1:51:02] friends if you've got a desire to serve
[1:51:05] God and there's something right now
[1:51:08] that's keeping you away or it seems it's
[1:51:10] in the way don't nurse that thing right
[1:51:14] begin to call on God and ask God to move
[1:51:16] for you but you know what God might ask
[1:51:18] something out of you to see how Resolute
[1:51:21] are you right
[1:51:22] now listen friends we can all say well
[1:51:25] if it was if I had this if I had this
[1:51:27] how many times there's been times I've
[1:51:29] prayed for people they've asked me to
[1:51:31] pray for them so they could be in the
[1:51:33] house of God on Thursday
[1:51:34] nights I'm just speaking plain right
[1:51:37] that's and I need a job I need this or I
[1:51:39] this and it don't happen let me tell you
[1:51:43] something it's not about what you'll do
[1:51:45] when you get there or when I get this or
[1:51:47] when I get that it's about what are you
[1:51:49] doing with what what you have now what
[1:51:51] are you doing with your time and your
[1:51:53] life that you have now because if things
[1:51:55] if you're not serious with where you're
[1:51:57] at now and willing to dedicate where
[1:51:59] you're at right now and sacrifice
[1:52:01] everything you could have every day of
[1:52:02] the week

[1:52:18] excuses I don't want I don't want one
[1:52:20] finger to be pointed to me on that day
[1:52:24] and say Lord I would have but he didn't
[1:52:25] tell
[1:52:27] me that's right I love you too much for
[1:52:30] that but most importantly I love him and
[1:52:33] then that lets me love you the right way

[1:52:50] right now of straightness this is an
[1:52:52] hour where things have been so blurred

[1:52:57] where the word there needs to be such
[1:53:00] straightness and Clarity why because you
[1:53:03] got to make a clearcut
[1:53:05] decision amen and I'm telling you this
[1:53:07] morning if you're here and you're

[1:53:20] you spoke in tongues I don't care if you
[1:53:22] prophesied I don't care if you prayed
[1:53:24] for the sick I'm asking you if you don't
[1:53:26] have the Holy Ghost or a life that'll
[1:53:29] line up with a word you make sure that
[1:53:32] your life lines up with a word where
[1:53:34] everything will punctuated with an
[1:53:38] amen is that your

[1:54:10] every sin that does so easily beset you

[1:54:20] Christ or I believe brother 's a prophet
[1:54:22] it's to know him that's what this
[1:54:24] message is about it's to know him in a
[1:54:27] personal relationship by the baptism of
[1:54:31] the Holy Ghost you can know the word you
[1:54:33] can know every letter you can know every
[1:54:35] word you can know every dip thong you
[1:54:37] can know everything and still miss
[1:54:40] it you've got to know the
[1:54:45] author Hallelujah that's what's
[1:54:48] important is to know him and I
[1:54:52] pray I'm finished I've been finished but
[1:54:56] I pray that this word may it not depart
[1:55:00] out of our
[1:55:02] hearts I pray that even as we would
[1:55:05] leave from this place here in a in some
[1:55:08] short time I pray may it not depart May
[1:55:11] there not be one rest that strikes your
[1:55:14] heart until you've experienced that rest
[1:55:16] with Jesus Christ amen that's what's
[1:55:19] important
[1:55:21] yes that's what matters don't let family
[1:55:23] hold you back don't let anybody hold you
[1:55:25] back it's between you and God if any man
[1:55:30] hear my voice and will open the door I
[1:55:33] will come in and S with him and he with
[1:55:37] me and you know as you as you are being
[1:55:40] partaken notice what does he do he does
[1:55:43] to you like he did to Abraham he gave
[1:55:46] Abraham the bread and the wine right
[1:55:50] that's what he did on the day of
[1:55:52] Pentecost and you know as we take that
[1:55:54] word in our life that that experience
[1:55:57] that Living
[1:55:58] Word when it starts out like that of a
[1:56:01] little the size of a fingernail little
[1:56:04] white button but as we take that word
[1:56:06] and eating that word what happens
[1:56:09] there's a growth taking place on the
[1:56:11] inside it's growing growing more and
[1:56:14] more into His Image you know it kind of
[1:56:17] becomes like a little boy that comes out
[1:56:19] there in the garage you know and they'll
[1:56:20] do things you know with you I don't mean
[1:56:22] to pick on Paul and Ben they came around
[1:56:24] the flow flower beds a little bit to a
[1:56:26] certain size but but Zach right here was
[1:56:28] always right there right behind my side
[1:56:29] and this guy would go out there and get
[1:56:30] tools in the guard in the garage and saw
[1:56:32] things and everything else and but he
[1:56:34] was always right out there you know how
[1:56:36] it is sometimes where a little boy or or
[1:56:38] maybe sometimes even a little girl get
[1:56:40] right next to and they see what Daddy's
[1:56:41] doing or they see what mama's doing and
[1:56:43] you'll catch them they have their baby
[1:56:44] doll and they're they're putting it in a
[1:56:45] certain way and putting you know the
[1:56:47] blanket around it or here the little boy
[1:56:48] will get he'll get that Hammer you're
[1:56:49] like no no no no not the real one here
[1:56:51] take the Fisher Price one instead you
[1:56:52] know what it is they're only they're
[1:56:54] only trying and just to to do what the
[1:56:58] image that's been set before them that's
[1:57:00] why it's important we want the Right
[1:57:02] image set before us we want Christ set
[1:57:04] before us we want Christ in US set
[1:57:07] before our families because let me tell
[1:57:09] you no matter what hurts what strains
[1:57:12] what complexes whatever we've

[2:00:19] your resurrection and the fellowship of
[2:00:21] your
[2:00:22] sufferings and where that life Lord

[2:00:27] hearts I pray dear God that you'll break
[2:00:30] back every Veil Lord every spiritual
[2:00:33] Veil Lord every unclean Spirit Lord God
[2:00:36] that would try to take the word and try
[2:00:39] to turn it and twist it Lord for it to

[2:03:12] praying Lord God grant it
[2:03:16] Lord Oh Lord God May there not be one
[2:03:19] Heart Lord that would look at it in a
[2:03:21] way of any harshness yet Lord love is
[2:03:28] corrective Lord God you know when we
[2:03:30] need
[2:03:31] correction times we need to
[2:03:34] repent not just the sinner Lord but
[2:03:37] there's times Lord in our life Lord as
[2:03:39] we're called to
[2:03:42] repentance maybe it's not even something
[2:03:44] we've even said out
[2:03:46] loud but a way that we've Act Ed from a
[2:03:50] wrong motivation on the
[2:03:53] inside oh
[2:03:56] God help us Lord I
[2:03:59] pray God May Lord lives and hearts Lord
[2:04:03] vessels Lord be open to your presence
[2:04:07] Lord may you pour down lord God into
[2:04:10] lives and hearts vessels Lord that are
[2:04:13] poured out and open to you to say
[2:04:17] Lord I want to be filled with your
[2:04:21] spirit I want to be filled with your
[2:04:23] life as every head is bowed I wonder how
[2:04:26] many hands would go up across the
[2:04:28] building and say
[2:04:29] Lord that's what I want
[2:04:33] hallu maybe you want a
[2:04:37] refilling the same one who feels also

[2:04:45] Spirit Grant it to your
[2:04:47] heart is there there one here that's
[2:04:49] never surrendered your life to the Lord
[2:04:51] Jesus
[2:04:53] Christ and you want to surrender here
[2:04:55] and say Lord I want to give my life to
[2:04:59] you I've kept
[2:05:01] it and I've been the one working on
[2:05:05] it but what a mess it
[2:05:07] is I want to put it in your hands
[2:05:10] Lord you'll never find any satisfaction
[2:05:13] in any marriage you'll never find
[2:05:14] satisfaction in a job you'll never find
[2:05:17] satisfaction in money the only place of
[2:05:19] real satisfaction is in Jesus
[2:05:23] Christ that's the only one that can
[2:05:25] satisfy your
[2:05:27] life
[2:05:29] Hallelujah that's a scripture when they
[2:05:32] asked Peter that day what must we do to
[2:05:34] be saved he said
[2:05:36] repent that means to confess your wrong
[2:05:38] and turn from it and be baptized in the
[2:05:41] name of Jesus Christ that's what this
[2:05:43] baptismal tank is up here for is to take
[2:05:46] upon his name be identified and and you
[2:05:48] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:51] if you've not walked into the Waters of
[2:05:53] baptism given your life to the Lord
[2:05:56] that's where you're at right now
[2:06:01] hallelu let's take these needs before
[2:06:04] Him
[2:06:07] Father Lord
[2:06:09] God what a moment
[2:06:13] Lord lives the Lord Jesus with one
[2:06:16] purpose there's one desire
[2:06:19] hearts Lord to be surrendered to you
[2:06:22] lives Lord God vessels to be filled with
[2:06:25] your spirit
[2:06:27] Lord Lord God to where you come and you
[2:06:32] take away the desire for the things of
[2:06:34] the
[2:06:34] world Lord when the new birth is
[2:06:38] come though we walk in this same
[2:06:41] flesh that we have now become
[2:06:44] United with the real family
[2:06:47] tree
[2:06:49] and that we are closer to you than we
[2:06:54] are to our natural
[2:06:57] family because we've been born again our
[2:07:00] desires have
[2:07:02] changed now Lord as you spoke your word
[2:07:04] Lord for hearts and lives and where the
[2:07:06] hands have been lifted up that Lord I
[2:07:08] want to be filled with your spirit I
[2:07:10] want my life to be a consecrated life to
[2:07:13] you I pray that God you would come down
[2:07:16] burn out every desire Lord burn out
[2:07:19] everything that's unlike you Lord God
[2:07:22] may your Holy Spirit Lord just move Lord
[2:07:24] in such a place may they look to you not
[2:07:27] look to their own attempts their own
[2:07:29] trying their own failings but may they
[2:07:31] look to the God who has spoke to them
[2:07:34] Lord God and knocked at their heart's
[2:07:36] door Lord may they Lord God draw their
[2:07:39] Confidence from your
[2:07:42] voice as they've invited you
[2:07:46] in granted Lord may they not rest day or
[2:07:51] night may that be the
[2:07:53] priority until they see and have that
[2:07:56] rest
[2:07:59] within that they're identified with
[2:08:02] you Lord there were other hands my hands
[2:08:05] Lord I had both of mine up I want a
[2:08:08] fresh
[2:08:11] refilling Lord one thing that I have
[2:08:15] found is that's what I need not just
[2:08:18] once a
[2:08:19] month I need it very often Hallelujah I
[2:08:23] need a refilling Lord because Lord that
[2:08:29] refilling keeps the stickers from being
[2:08:33] sticky that refilling like your Prophet
[2:08:36] when he put it in the message ashamed he
[2:08:38] said we must stay in his presence in the
[2:08:41] spirit of God if we don't we start to
[2:08:44] get
[2:08:45] dry that's when we start to get
[2:08:47] complainy that's when we start start to
[2:08:48] get all these other things Lord
[2:08:52] God grant it this morning Lord a
[2:08:55] refreshing from the presence of the
[2:08:58] Lord oh Lord God a
[2:09:02] refreshing or to where anything that's
[2:09:04] come into a life that's hindered May the
[2:09:07] spirit of God just move
[2:09:09] and washing everything all the trash up
[2:09:13] onto the
[2:09:14] shore Lord these are your children we
[2:09:16] are your children father
[2:09:19] these people Lord my brothers and
[2:09:20] sisters they've not come here they could
[2:09:22] have had other things that they could
[2:09:24] have done today but they've come here I
[2:09:27] believe they love you
[2:09:29] Lord I believe they love you like I love
[2:09:31] you they Lord the desire it even
[2:09:34] shows Lord God may you take us on take
[2:09:36] us
[2:09:37] deeper Lord in every one of our lives a
[2:09:40] relationship just like a relationship
[2:09:43] between a husband and a wife your
[2:09:44] Prophet said just like that love would
[2:09:46] grow between a husband and a wife he
[2:09:47] said that's the the way that Faith grows
[2:09:49] between you and God it grows and grows
[2:09:52] and
[2:09:53] grows Lord Jesus Grant it in our lives
[2:09:58] Lord or those that are sick in their
[2:10:00] body not able to be here others that
[2:10:02] might be sitting here and sick would you
[2:10:04] touch them Lord touch those Lord that's
[2:10:07] been suffering Lord some even from
[2:10:09] operations and procedures they've had
[2:10:11] done Lord father even the pain to be
[2:10:13] able to sit Lord I'm asking God that you
[2:10:16] would just move down for them Lord
[2:10:18] may you just touch them Lord let them
[2:10:20] know your love and care oh God granted
[2:10:25] Lord we
[2:10:27] pray in the name of Jesus
[2:10:31] Christ amen could we
[2:10:34] stand
[2:10:37] Hallelujah if you'd like prayer this
[2:10:39] morning you know we'd be happy to pray
[2:10:40] with
[2:10:41] you if you got a need on your
[2:10:45] heart and I know we got the dinner
[2:10:47] planned and I I know we have that plan
[2:10:50] but this is what's more important that
[2:10:53] that can wait out there I I don't listen
[2:10:56] I don't I don't mind if I got to eat
[2:10:57] cold chicken even if I had to eat cold
[2:11:00] rice cuz I've done that but I don't want
[2:11:03] to miss what God has for me I don't want
[2:11:06] to miss what God has for us do you this
[2:11:10] this is what's more important this
[2:11:12] supper is more important than that
[2:11:17] supper what a privilege in this
[2:11:20] hour what a privilege even from a young
[2:11:23] person to an old person a life where the
[2:11:26] spirit of God can come down and give
[2:11:29] strength to cause young people to live
[2:11:32] an overcoming
[2:11:33] life it can take middle-age old
[2:11:37] all and give a real power on the inside
[2:11:41] it's a love
[2:11:43] affair there's many quotes that I know
[2:11:47] there's many that I read but if there's
[2:11:48] one that you remember remember the one
[2:11:50] where he says God does not it's not
[2:11:52] about our loyalty or our
[2:11:56] patronage he wants our
[2:11:58] fellowship because you know what when
[2:12:01] it's just loyalty or patronage that's
[2:12:03] about
[2:12:04] us that's about when we feel when we
[2:12:07] feel what we like it's like you go to
[2:12:09] your favorite restaurant until they're
[2:12:11] no longer your favorite restaurant let
[2:12:14] things start changing all of a sudden
[2:12:17] what you think about
[2:12:19] changes right I know I know some of you
[2:12:21] no longer go to some of the same
[2:12:22] restaurants what was that
[2:12:25] patronage but when there's a love affair
[2:12:28] a love he wants us that we would love
[2:12:30] him not with our own love but with his
[2:12:32] love to say Lord I Want to Love You But
[2:12:36] Let It Be Your Love
[2:12:38] Lord your
[2:12:40] love that's what he provided that's what
[2:12:42] Calvary provided that we might have that
[2:12:46] Fellowship because a fellowship ship is
[2:12:48] even
[2:12:50] when things ain't going the way we want
[2:12:52] it to
[2:12:53] go when there's a dry time or a cool
[2:12:56] time in the
[2:12:57] church you're still in love with
[2:13:00] [Music]
[2:13:01] him cuz the prophet told us he said God
[2:13:04] will allow depressing times to come
[2:13:06] around us he'll allow cool times he said
[2:13:09] to even come in the church to see what
[2:13:11] are you going to do about
[2:13:13] it he'll allow
