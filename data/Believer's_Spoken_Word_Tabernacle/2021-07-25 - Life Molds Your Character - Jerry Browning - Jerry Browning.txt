was our father and we're his children amen he never lost sight of us and man even in whatever family and whatever way that we come god never lost track of his seed amen he'll not lose one and just as with you know i want you to think about it that even as brother branham would dramatize that of the mama eagle mama eagle knew what time to go searching she knew what time when it was time that that little eagle would be there god knew this was our time amen the holy spirit came and searched us out in this time we've we've not followed cunning device fables amen the message that god sent to us in this hour it has fit us like a glove amen this is the word of god that god has spoke for us we're we're not out of season we're in season amen to the world yeah we're we're out of season with the world but i'm glad about that i don't want to fit in with the world if we fit in with the world there's problems but in the wonderful we haven't had to make ourselves odd brother aaron we haven't made ourselves odd it's the word that has come to us that has brought the separation amen brother braham said the reason abraham separated from lot was because of the promise that he was holding amen so we're we might be oddballs to the world but we've not made ourselves odd amen it's his life in us that makes the difference amen we're just so thankful to be in the house of the lord once again and amen so glad to have uh brother jerry and sister mina here with us and i just was expressing to brother jerry i said um we're just we're just always happy as a as a church and as an assembly uh i know he's my brother but i don't say this because he's my brother i say it because i really appreciate the gift that's in his life and how that how that he allows the lord to use him i stood with him in in the foreign fields and watched when he's ministered there to young people ministered there to you know to older ones when we're able to be together in service like that and just watch how that god will come down and he just surrenders that gift and i really appreciate that with all my heart because as a church we're edified and when i when i i look for things when i pray and i look for brothers to to bring in and brothers to minister to us i'm not after names i'm not after see who we can get in here this i i don't i don't look for things that way i want to see where how is the church edified and so sometimes that's why you see ministry coming back and there's things that i can see and look at and because it's about i want to see the church edified if i looked at it and i you know the way i look at it if i took my my children to a doctor and that doctor didn't help him very much i'm not going back to that doctor just simply put i want i want my children to be helped and so i believe that that's how god feels about our lives amen and i just so i appreciate that and brother jerry lord willing will be here um ministering on thursday as well i want to welcome brother joshua amen i got that right amen god bless you welcome brother amen amen sister mary bill god bless you good to have you with us here too amen and if i miss somebody else here you just have to forgive me may god

do you all know how to play that do you know how to play [Music] why don't you come lead us in there i want to sing it but i don't feel [Music] confident oh this joy that i had the world hadn't given me this joy that i [Music] world had give it to me [Music] this joy that i have the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away this peace that i had the world didn't give it to me [Music] [Applause] the world didn't give it to me [Music] [Applause] [Music] the world didn't give it to me oh the holy ghost that i have the world didn't give it to me oh the holy ghost that i have the world didn't give it to me the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away this word [Applause] [Music] the world didn't give it to me [Music] joy [Music] [Music] the world didn't give it to me the world hadn't given the world and take it away [Music] when i think of how he came so far from glory came and went among the lowly such as i to suffer shame and such disgrace on mount calvary take my place then i ask myself this question who am i [Music] who am i that [Music] [Music] that he would pray not mine will thine lord the answer i may never [Music] he'd go for who am i when i'm reminded of his words i'll leave thee never [Music] just be true i'll give to you life forever and forever i wonder what i could have done [Music] to deserve god's only son to fight my battles [Music] [Music] [Music] am [Music] am i that he would pray not mine will thine lord [Music] to an old rugged cross he'd go for who am i or to [Music] who am i [Applause] amen praise the lord we're thankful to be here this morning amen just stand with me and we'll go to prayer before we turn to the scripture this morning heavenly father lord we come before you now at this time and we're asking for you to lord come and anoint us father with your spirit lord jesus we're just sinners saved by grace we're so thankful of your grace dear god lord we ask that you to anoint us this morning that to you would come and speak your words to the people dear god for we know that your words are life and they are eternal lord and that they would be a blessing and help to the people their god we pray and ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i'd like to read from romans chapter 5 verses 3 and 4. not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations worketh patience and the word patience there in greek means endurance and endurance experience the word experience there in the greek means approved tried character and experience hope which is faith brother branham says in thirsting for life said life is a great thing life molds your character you maybe see that i'd like to minister take that for a text this morning life molds your character our character is molded by the things we go through in this life the trials that we face the tests that we go through they all mold our character now is the time for a character to be molded your character is not molded after the rapture it's molded before you go in the rapture because you got the right character amen the prophet said we should judge our character how we are now would tell us how we would be in the days of moses how that we react to the word today we would have reacted to the word in that day moses was criticized by many in that day many that were supposed to be his brethren criticized him are we critical you see we can judge how we would be then god told moses said separate yourself from them i'm going to swallow them up because of their character but you know moses said the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from out of your midst like unto me in other words he would be of the same character that moses was remember when they spoke to jesus they said we know moses he said if you'd known moses you would have known me because moses spoke of me if they'd have known the character of moses they would recognize that character in jesus christ it was a godly character brother branham says i believe that your character identifies you in that same message right after he says that he's praying and he says father god come tonight i pray and help us help our unbelief forgive us our shortcomings so you're having the right character doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes in this life it doesn't mean that you're not going to fail from time to time it doesn't mean that you're not going to have faults because we're not perfect yet that's one of the things that i believe satan comes and really tries to beat us up over is any time we make a mistake any time we fail anytime we slip up while he comes and tries to point a finger at us but remember when the tax man was after brother branham and brother branham said told me when he called said tell him i'm not in here and he stepped out the door technically he was not in there but the holy spirit told him he lied now watch his character his character was that no matter what it was going to cost him he called back up the irs man and told him i lied i had my wife telling you i wasn't in there and i was there so that showed his character now he lied but his character showed and that he made it right you may make a mistake you may do something wrong but the real character of christ is you'll make it right as soon as it's pointed out to you as soon as you become aware of you'll say father i'm sorry i didn't mean to do that please forgive me we're we're not going to take a special course when after the rapture in order to get our character right for the millennium brother branham said in future home he said it's a transplanting it takes what's here and he puts it there so all of your molding all of your changing and all that it has to go on now he said if god could take elijah and raise him up after 2 500 years and transplant him back on the earth to to show up there on mount transfiguration then he could do it again with the bride he's seriously in redemption by the by judgment i just want to point out these things maybe you're very familiar with them but if you're not then this will make you familiar with them he said when jesus comes again with his bride to reign on the throne of david his father in the millennium he'll come with her then as king and queen so you're not going to take a special tutoring on how to be the queen once the rapture takes place you're getting that tutoring now you're finding out how to rain now you say how am i doing that i'm not reigning over anyone yes you are you start out by reigning over yourself you start out by reigning over this flesh how do you think you're going to reign over flesh likeness if you can't reign over flesh like this now he says everything in the bible is in trinity you're a trinity body spirit and soul you have a trinity a kitchen a living room a bedroom he said you may have eight different rooms but the bedroom but the only three you're living in and we find out the coming of christ is in a trinity he comes first to redeem his bride he comes next to receive his bride he comes next with this bride as king and queen to reign through the millennium everything's in a tremendo trinity we have a mortal body a celestial body a glorified body three stages brings us back to our perfection again like in eden he says in questions and answers he says now the next thing is the translation of the church and then the return of moses and elijah the millennium reign upon the earth with the bride and groom for a thousand years and then the judgment bar and then total annihilation of sin it'll never be no more at that time now the seals never ended time time or seasons until after the millennium it still be time until after the millennium he was asked a question said does the millennium have to do uh with the have to do with the 1000 years he says they lived and reigned with christ 1000 years it will be 1 000 years upon the earth because 1 000 years upon the earth is only counted a time for a parable like god as one day 1 000 years upon the earth there's only one day with god as god counting time so it's the sabbath day when the church will no more labor against sin and satan is bound for a little season a thousand years because all his subjects are in hell and the church that's on the earth is redeemed in the right in the presence of christ so he has nothing he can work through so it's not a chain as i said it's a log chain it's a chain of circumstance you know what the chain of circumstances he's saying first of all all of satan's subjects are in hell second of all you're in a glorified body that can't be affected by sin that can't be affected by sickness that can't be affected by death he's bound by circumstance he's helpless and hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of his subjects he says again in question answers you asked the question the church age ending and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered in have we already entered into tribulation periods no no no i wish i could just have more time on that the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets in upon israel then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennial reign after that comes the white throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and new earth and the new city coming down out from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together so you see the timeline of events the rapture takes place that's the translation of the church then then the two prophets appear in israel and the tribulation period sets in upon the earth upon the foolish virgin and then comes the end of that time and then comes the battle of armageddon when we come riding down out of heaven with christ and then then the millennial rain sets in for a thousand years at the end of the millennial reign is the white throne judgment and it says that that after the battle of armageddon that the dead lived not until the thousand-year reign be completed then at the end of the thousand year reign the sea and the earth and everything will give up its dead and all will come before the judgment seat of god except for the bride who's already in the throne [Applause] and then after the judgment then satan is thrown into the pit where the false prophet and beast and then sin is annihilated then we ascend back up into heaven and the earth and the heavens is burnt over with fire and then there's a new heavens and a new earth and then the holy city of jerusalem comes and sets back down upon the earth now nowhere in that timeline is there time for you to get your character molded when we come on the scene in the time of the millennium with christ to reign as king and queen we've got to be already ready and fit to reign when we leave here in the rapture we're already fit to reign so that's why you go through your trials now that's why you face your difficulties now that's why you're tested and tried now that's why you suffer temptations now it's because this is the time that life is molding your character [Applause] now in the book of revelations chapter 2 verse 8 it says unto the angel the church of sumerian right these things saith the first and the last which was dead and and is alive i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i have known the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life every age goes through tribulations and it's not the same for every age times change satan changes but god doesn't change because god delivers us out of them all but as the times change and satan changes his tactics a little bit trying to do like he did job trying to push you until you would curse god that's what he tried with job he said i'll get him to curse you to your face i'll keep pushing him until he's had all he can take but i want you to know something he god said my grace is sufficient for you amen we've learned that all we need is to find grace amen so every age suffers its tribulation and paul says in hebrews chapter 10 verse 32 said but called to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated you endured a great flight fight rather of afflictions partly once you were made gazing stocks both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions to them that were so used for ye had compassion of me and my bonds and took joyfully the spoils of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring substance cast not away there for your confidence which has great recompense of rewards in other words don't cast away your confidence because you're going through trusts and trials don't cast away your confidence in other words when you start going through things maybe facing death in the family or whatever it may be you know don't start questioning well does god really love me if god really loved me i wouldn't be going through this i've heard people question god that way does does god not love us it has nothing to do with the love of god [Applause] god is molding you you're going to face tribulations so don't cast away your confidence because you're going through them [Applause] for ye have need of patience i think we mentioned this thursday night for you have need of patience that after you've done the will of god you might receive the promise so after you've done what was required of you to do then have patience deliverance will come freedom will come just have patience the blessings are on their way the blessings are just on the other side of the tribulations listen friends i would rather face my tribulations now than to be here during the three and a half years and face those tribulations for yet a little while and and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him now he says partly why she became companions of them that were so used and brother branham says in the smyrna church age he says based on that he says the mere association of kind-hearted people with the true believer might well bring death in return for their kindness now i remember brother branham speaking about there would be those that would receive eternal life in the time of the white throne judgment because they were good to the bride not because they knew the truth and thought well i can't walk in that way but if i'm kind to somebody i'll make it no they didn't know the truth and yet they were being kind yet they were doing great things for you we had a man became a friend of mine and here back in may he was murdered and he became a friend of mine and he did work on our church put a new roof on our church and and didn't charge us over a mount for it and he went above and beyond he made the rafters look like the original rafters on the church you know because the church he said was a historical site and so he made him look just like that he spent extra time and designed the roof on the back of our church and and then he came and he put a roof on my house built me a roof over my deck he put flooring down in my house he built closets in my house he put new trim work up and he did all these things you know and he went above and beyond doing all these things and and he was just uh real kind to us as a as believers and as a church he didn't go to church himself he didn't see anything but uh then may the 8th i believe it was he was he was murdered and uh you know i thought he did everything he did without knowing the truth and i thought maybe perhaps on that day it'll be taking into consideration what all he done for our church and for me but god says here when he's speaking to the sumerian church he says i know your tribulations but does he hold back the tribulations does he hold back the persecutions no he simply says i know of them and he says i'm not unmindful of your suffering brother brahm said this puts a stumbling block before many people because they say how could god be just and loving and just stand by and watch his people suffer the bible israel questioned god in this way in malachi 1. and it said and god answered back to them said i have loved you saith the lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid his mountains in his heritage to waste for the dragons of the wilderness but did that mean that jacob didn't face trials did that mean jacob didn't face some hard times did that mean jacob wasn't misused and done wrong no brother branham says you see they could not figure out god's love they thought god's love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care and god said that his love was elective the proof of his love is election no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen under salvation because god had chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to death as he did paul he may commit your suffering as he did jacob that's his prerogative he's sovereign but it's all with a purpose everything you go through is with the purpose god has a reason for it he's not just you know letting things happen he doesn't know what's going on with you and you know he has to be made aware of it no he's aware of it and he lets it because he's serving a purpose when you look back over your life and look through some of the hard things you've come through and then you look where you are now and you see there was a change that happened in you because of what you went through [Applause] your faith grew it changed you your outlook changed your view of things changed perhaps your compassion changed [Music] where you were able to be more compassionate to others instead of sitting there and watching somebody else go through and say boy i'm glad it's them and not me you're more compassionate amen it's with a purpose he if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in us we went through that on thirsty he put strength in us when i'm weak then i am strong amen you see he himself suffered talking about christ now he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered in hebrews he's referring to hebrews 5 and 8-9 where it says though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him he's brother branham says here again in plain language the very character of jesus was perfected by suffering if suffering perfected the character of jesus then how do we think ours our character is going to get perfected unless we go through some suffering and according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection paul says in romans 8 and if children then heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us compared to what we're going to compared to what we're going to have the suffering is nothing it only lasts for a season anyway it doesn't even last for a thousand years it lasts for your lifetime here and that's the end of it it's over then that's why we're looking forward to the ending of this life you know i i said to my mother yesterday i believe it was i don't remember how i got on the subject but i said what about people who don't have a belief of something after this what if all they think they have is this life only we were we were talking about my father and we were thinking about him and where he is and i was saying you know i had mixed emotions about the new house because my dad never even got to enjoy it i says but you know my mom doesn't have any memories of him there and and i said but he wouldn't want to come back here from where he's at and i said but what about people who don't believe in that where they think this life is the end of and i said no wonder many of them live the way they live because they're living this life like this is all they've got man i'm so glad this isn't all i've got i'm looking forward to the ending of this life but people that they don't want to see the ending of this life they want to hang on to it because they've got nothing to look forward to and the reason they have nothing to look forward to is because there's nothing in there for the word to speak to there's no seed there to respond to the word so all they've got ahead of them is judgment i'm glad that when you receive eternal life you've passed from death and to life you've passed from the judgment amen not to come ever into the judgment we're being judged now brother branham says judgment starts at the house of god we're being judged we come here and judge ourselves now by the word that comes forth hallelujah james says my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing so faith worketh endurance and the bible tells us those that endure to the end shall be saved not those that give up part way along the way when i was in the army and especially in germany and every friday we would go on a 10 mile run and our uh platoon sergeant called it tour the town because we ran around the whole town of gelnhausen and come back to the to the post you know and uh i would watch we uh our barracks was on top of the hill there and we had to run down the hill uh down to get to where the street was and i would watch there'd be people same ones always fall out by the time they got to the bottom of the hill and start their walk back up the hill to go on back up to the barracks and then there'd be some that would wait until we actually got down on the street and got a little further on down where they thought nobody would look and then they'd fall out and walk back to the post but you know what they felt they thought they nobody will know what they they failed to realize i guess maybe because they always done this that we formed back up into formation after we got back and so the platoon sergeant was able to look over and see who endured the run and only those that endured the run got his favor we can't fall out now if the going might get rough it might get hard but we've come a long way we've already come a long way we've already come through a lot of rough now i know some of you you're young and you're thinking well i feel like i've just got started well think of it this way the 11th hour worker gets the same page so if you've just started your run your race in this race it's okay you're going to win the same prize just stay with it now why why does he stand by and let the suffering go on this is why unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer the rain listen to this the reason for this is character simply is never made without suffering the character of christ is what he's talking about not the character of this world but the character of christ to have that character it's you don't get it without suffering he suffered and it perfected his character if jesus character needed perfecting then so does ours and he goes on he says character is a victory not a gift now the holy ghost is a gift salvation is a gift you don't do anything to earn that but character you're going to have to overcome things for you to be considered an overcomer as the bible says that he would grant with the overcomer to sit with him in his father's throne in order to be an overcomer you've got to overcome something brother branham says he doesn't pull you up through a pipe and you come out the other side and say i'm an overcomer you wouldn't have overcome anything but he allows you to face things and go through things and they're hard but paul tells us he'll not put on you anything that you're not able to bear and you might come through times where you think i think i'm reaching my end i don't know if i can go any further but you will because there's something in you that won't quit when i would go on that run in germany do you think my legs didn't burn at times you think that it did they didn't hurt at times they did but i pushed on because i wasn't a quitter [Applause] we're not quitters we're not going to quit we're going to keep pushing on why because there's something in us i pushed on because i was a soldier first of all we push on because we are soldiers of the cross that song says he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb hallelujah he never promised victory without fighting but he said help would always come in time hallelujah praise the lord a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic remember when satan took jesus upon the the pinnacle and he said cast yourself down and then he told him said look at all the kingdoms of the world if you'll bow down and worship me i'll give them to you jesus replied back with the word i shall worship the lord thy god only but see he could not take the kingdoms without suffering he couldn't take because that would have been satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and is set down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are light up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation it's temporary suffering temporary tribulations hallelujah remember he knows what you're going through he was tested and tempted in every way such as knowing to man so he knows what you're going through he's been in this kind of flesh he's felt the temptations of this flesh he's felt the sufferings of this kind of flesh so the prophet says he reproves with long long suffering and gentleness and mercy and he chastens with nail scarred hands he knows your suffering he suffered amen paul says in hebrews chapter 12 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then you are bastards and not sons furthermore we have fathers of our flesh which corrected us and gave us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father spirits and live for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our prophet that we might be partakers of his holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceful fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby brother branham was praying and the message of our hope is in god and as he was praying he said and thy children many are weary and worn been pushed about all for their own good their teaching their child training to bring them up in the admiration of the lord trials worth more than silver or gold but as it's written no chastisement is pleasant for the time being but finally when thy church comes to have its training then they will be placed as sons in into the inherit of god which shall inherit all things and be equal in powers and blessings as the son of god brothers to him look what all he went through and we know he experienced hunger we know he experienced weakness we know he experienced tiredness but he was tested too and tempted then came down to the time of suffering where they took and beat him with a whip a cat of nine tails which if you don't know what that is it's they take and on the splayed out ends of the of the whip they put uh like sharp razor blade almost like material that will rip the flesh every time the whip hits him and a crown of thorns placed on his head not gently his beard plucked they would hit him and say prophesy and tell us who hit you and you know what the outstanding part of it is he took it all in silence he never complained he never screamed out at them he took the suffering friends he was not unaware of the suffering he was going to go through beforehand that's why he prayed in the garden and said if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done he knew the suffering he was going to face he even told the disciples and he says i'll be forsaken by all remember peter said i'll not forsake you he said yes peter even you will forsake me before the has crowed you will have denied me three times i'm thankful he finished the course i'm thankful he took it the king of glory came down to be tabernacled in men not as in the form of an angel but is in a form such as we have he left the ivory palaces came down to be one of us he became me so that i might become him hallelujah hallelujah you know when you become new converts as soon as you come to christ something's going to happen you're going to start facing things things are going to start happening to try you to try your faith and it's it's not god trying you to see are they going to take it and make it it's proving it to yourself because if you were told when you came to christ you're going to face this test you're going to face this trial you're going to go through this you're going to face this loss you're going to face this death you say oh wait a minute i don't know about this but you don't know everything you're going to face you would say oh i couldn't go through that but you do go through it you prove it to yourself when you come out on the other side of you say well i didn't know if i was going to make it but i made it [Applause] you know i know we speak against being proud pride but that's the pride of this life but i'm proud to be a christian amen i'm proud that i've made it through everything god has took me through not proud in my own abilities but it was god that gave me strength when i was weak hallelujah it was god that brought me through but he has confidence in you see he has more confidence in you than you have in yourself today they talk a lot about whether you have self-confidence or not but he's got confidence in you think about when the devil came up before the throne of god and god said have you considered my servant job there is none like him in all the earth he had confidence in job the devil said you've got a hedge around him remove that and i'll get him to curse you to your face god said i've got confidence in him that you won't be able to do that because he's my son my seed is in him i don't care what you throw at him you can't take his life now satan but you can take everything else and i've got confidence in him see what it means for god to have confidence in you he knows you're going to make it amen many times the devil comes to you and says man you ain't going to make this rapture look at you what a mess you are sometimes but god's got confidence in you he knows you're going to make it and therefore he said i will present to myself a church without spot or wrinkle why because he's not dependent on you he's dependent on himself and we're depending on him we're not depending on ourselves he's got confidence because he knows what's in you that should give you confidence today i can make it no matter what satan throws my way because there's something in me [Music] every son that cometh the god must be scourged and tried and tested brother branham said preachers let the congregation get by with anything today what they need is a little child training what we need is preachers that will preach the word and tell us the truth about it and tell us we must be born again and bring us on the basis of the shed blood of jesus christ the son of god and introduce all the good things that god has got for us we need preachers that will tell us if you've got the character of christ then this is how you will act this is how you will live job said i wish there was somebody that could put one hand on god and place the other one on man and be a spokesman between a daze man he called him the prophet said a worthy one who could stand in the breach and put his hand on a sinful man and a holy god and bridge the way together and we've got that jesus christ he's our advocate hallelujah he put his hand on a sinful man and the other on a holy god because he knows what it's like to go through the things you're going through because he went through them but he can put his hand on a holy god because he'd done it without sin hallelujah praise the god hallelujah job was coming through all this and not understanding what was going on job says i will offend no more whatever i've done i won't do it no more see that's showing his character he began to search his life it's just something i did and then when he come down and he's asking god and god said where were you where were you job when i created this world then job comes down to his revelation of the end and says though the skin worms devour my body yet in my flesh shall i see god and not another but i'll see him for myself hallelujah abraham says god hasn't promised a flowery bed of ease but he's promised a lot of mountains he's but he's promised the grace to go over every one of them watch job when he went through his trials and testings every child of god first has to be tried and tested in other words they have to be trained like child training take some whipping straighten up you know how to act then how to conduct yourself as a christian god gives you a little bit of whipping once in a while turns you around a few times you know what it's all about sometimes lays you on your back so you can look up but it gives you the grace to go through paul says in second timothy persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch and iconium and lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me hallelujah yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions but god will deliver you out of them all yes amen hallelujah peter said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing is happening to you but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be also you may be glad also with exceeding joy if ye be reproached for this for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god rests upon you and on their parts he is evil spoken of but on your part he's glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer as a thief or as an evildoer as a busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obeyed not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as into a faithful creator if we suffer because of the will of it be the will of god then we commit ourselves our souls unto him for his keeping brother branham said speaking of what i just read to you about what peter said said thinking not strange beloved when fire trials come upon you for it's only done to prove your faith that's more precious to you than gold look when you get sick sometime how is it the righteous suffer god does it in his for his own glory turns right back around and heals that and starts a testimony hallelujah when he allows sickness to come on you there's a testimony down the road coming when he allows you to to lose your job there's a testimony down the road coming because you're going to get another job god's going to give you one hallelujah i have never seen the righteous no forsaken nor his seed begging bread hallelujah i've quoted that for years but i can quote the first part of it now i was once young but now i'm old remember how elisha was tested to see if he would stay with elijah elijah says we've come here to the school of probably stay here when i'll you know i'll come back bye nope as my soul liveth i'll not leave you [Music] he said what do you want he said i want a double portion of your spirit he said if you see me when i'm taken up you'll receive your request elisha remember he was plowing in the field and he left the plowing behind and went to follow elijah and elijah constantly tested him to see if he could get him to stay nope i am not stand i am going to get that double portion of your spirit i'm staying with you no matter what right elijah went up there to the river and the river parted horses fiery chariot came down sweeping down out of heaven elijah throwed back his mantle stepped on that chariot and ascended elisha picked up that man and went back to the rivers mode and said where's the god of elijah and the waters parted and he walked [Applause] across brother branham says in jehovah jericho every time that man really steps out to serve god he goes through testings god gives you a little training child training it is not very pleasant the bible says for a while but it yields forth peaceful fruits daddy used to take me out behind the house with a strap of leather about like that and got some good old-fashioned child training it's too bad our children don't get it today the trouble of it is use cigarette smoking cocktail drinking pitcher show running mothers run around on bar flies and things and letting babysitters take care of your kids instead of you being a home taking care of them like god gave them to you that's what caused all this stuff to get in that's exactly right no wonder we can't have faith how can you associate with things of the world and try to associate with christ god calls for separation then trials and testings come the bible said if we can't stand by the trials and testing then we become the illegitimate children bastard children the bible calls it and not the children of god we if we can't stand the trials and testings so there were three israelites and they were in babylon and there was a statue an image erected and the image was the image of daniel one of their brother beltazar and they were commanded when you hear the instruments play everyone's to fall down and worship and you know there were some there were some agents of the devil that had it in for them and they brought this to the king and said let it so be a command that if no one if they don't worship that they get thrown in the fiery furnace the king says all right i can see that i agree with that and send then them same ones come to him and said hey there's three down there that's not falling down and worshipping this image that you've erected he said bring him here he said i'm going to give you another chance we're going to play these instruments again and when you hear them play you fall down and worship this idol and they said king we're not careful to answer you in this manner in other words we don't have to take counsel we don't have to go we don't have to pray about this we already know the will of our god we're not going to fall down and worship it so he said you're cast them into the fiery furnace and heat it up heat it up many more times hotter cast them in the bible said it was so hot that the men that went down to cast them in and killed them and they cast them in see they were tested here's the thing they were going to die no matter what the way they looked at it if if we fall down in worship then we're going to die a spiritual doubt [Applause] yes sir but if we don't fall down in worship and our god doesn't deliver us from there then we're going to die but will be delivered out of your hand and will not die spiritual death [Music] so we don't we don't have to be careful in answering you this threw them in there and then king nebuchadnezzar looks over in there and he says hey wait a minute how many men did we throw down in there anyway [Applause] amen he said didn't we throw three in there he said yes o king we threw three in there shadrach meshach and abednego and he said well i see four down there he said and they're unbound they had bound them and thrown them in there he said they're unbound and they're walking around down there and the fourth man is like the son of god [Music] he commanded them take them up out of there and you know what the bible says the bible says the fire had burned off their bonds but the bible says that not even the smell of fire was in their clothes not even the smell of fire and smoke was on their clothes god protected them through the fire hallelujah hallelujah fire had no power their hair wouldn't sins neither were their coats chains nor the smell of fire on them hallelujah hallelujah you know when we're tested when we're tempted we can take our stand there was a man in the bible and his name looks like job bets but it's pronounced yabets and he's only mentioned in two verses of the bible and it says he was more honorable than his brother it's in first chronicles 4 9 9-10 and his mother called his name yahbet saying because i bear him in sorrow and yahweh called on god of israel and said oh th thou would has blessed me indeed and enlarge my coast that thine hand might be with me and thou wouldest keep me from evil that it may not grieve me and god granted him that which he requested enlarge my territory god let me take more domain over this flesh enlarge my territory let me reign more supreme in this life the bible says he to them that received him he gave them power power to become sons you know the character of christ and i'm closing where's brother doug the character of christ a lot of times people get his character wrong they think of sweet jesus but you know he came down to the temple one time brother ritchie and he saw them in there making money off the people for them to come and buy animals to be sacrificed for their sins and they were exchanging money and he come down there and he took he sat down over on the side and he began to breathe the whip and he did it while he was just looking over all this and it was vexing him his righteous indignation was rising up within him and then when he got finished braiding that whip he stood up and he kicked them tables over and he said my house is to be a house of prayer and you've made it a den of thieves and he ran them out of the temple that's the character of god amen run the devil out if he's come what come and and brought something in on you this way run him out if he tricks you over here and you look and you say oh i've got some besetting sin that's hanging on to me run him out of there that's the character of christ hallelujah the character of christ is to correct and the character of christ is to be corrected hallelujah amen as they come to the instruments amen brother brian you know that song through the fire help me sing that song amen hallelujah amen so many times things i could not [Music] understand many times [Music] weakness [Music] as i look at all the victories the spirit rises up in me and it's through the fire my is made strong he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and hue would not be

encouraged you know if you think of how god would take so much time paul in his ministry peter in the ministry i was dealing with some of these actually very much the very same things there on wednesday evening in michigan and you find paul would would be moved by the spirit of god to admonish the children of god when they're going through tests when they're going through trials and peter would say think it not strange i'm glad that god would be mindful to deal with our thoughts about things sometimes our thoughts on things can be a little bit off but god lets us know don't think it's just something strange it's an opportunity of proving aren't you grateful for that aren't you grateful for his grace amen amen hallelujah let's just sing let's just sing god is so good [Music] is so good god is so good my god [Music] answers frames [Music] i love you [Music] he is [Music] he's oh soon he's so good to me yes god is so good oh my god oh my god he is so good oh he's so good to me amen amen we're just going to be dismissed in a word of prayer amen let's just take you take this with us this is a comfort of the lord to speak to our hearts letting he lets us know he's mindful he's not as brother brad would put it he's not an onlooker he's right present there right with us walking right there amen heavenly father we thank you this morning o god for your word lord instruction lord and direction to our lives lord we just are so thankful that god that you would be so mindful as down through lord the scriptures lord and how that you would take paul you will take peter lord jesus even as you were here in your earthly journey you would let the church of the living god know that lord there would be tribulation in this life to let him know that there would be suffering how paul would make a journey there in the book of acts to exhort the church of the living god of how that lord they must press through lord tribulation and great persecutions lord but we're also mindful of how that paul could write that in the midst of these times this is where we receive comfort dear god help us lord as children of god to be yielded that lord that same comfort of the holy spirit
