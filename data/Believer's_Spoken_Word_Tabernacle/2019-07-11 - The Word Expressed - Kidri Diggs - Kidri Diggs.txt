Amen God come and he sought out each and every one of us it wasn't by mistake it's not by accident that we're here tonight this is by design amen and I believe that don't you I believe God knew before

be here it's good to see everybody you know like brother Samuel said we certainly appreciate all of you all and you know I just love this when churches come together you know it's a it's a wonderful thing cuz it's only just a glimpse of what heaven is gonna be like you know it ain't it ain't gonna be no Envy over there ain't gonna be no we do it this way you do it that way they're gonna be none of that you know what else it ain't even gonna be no thoughts of of confusion you don't even have a bad thought over them think about it you see somebody singing a song you don't have a thought that I wonder if that's a bride song it'll be it's gonna be a haul we all gonna be bathing in the glory of God amen but you know we love the Lord and I like like brother Samuel said you know it it seems hot but this ain't hot you know I just come back from doing a youth camp in Massachusetts and it was a real youth camp on a campground and what no a condition of none of that stuff with no area for cold water just like we were drinking out the lake but the atmosphere was wonderful I mean God God just can't I you know the first night I preach hope y'all don't mind but the first night I preach I was just hot and tired so I said I'm I'm going to bed so I went to bed and they say we'll go around the campfire saying she's know what woke me up the young people singing around the campfire it was so powerful and projecting to the came all the way up to where my cat when my room was I could hear his like it was outside my window and I was like man this is something special you know so I said hey man suck it up you have to get myself in the right frame of mind because like you said you know we spoil you you know if it ain't got no AC or no heat when it's cold it's like do I really want to be a part of that but I think sometimes God does that to see if we really want it you know so we appreciate the Lord and it's good to be here how many glad to be in church amen we thank God for all the music we certainly appreciate you let's just have a word of Prayer and we'll get into the Word of God and again I appreciate brother browning a man for and I want us to come amen and and even brother Randy will be with him tomorrow so we certainly appreciate him also let's pray if you have a need you can acknowledge it to the Lord by an uplifted hand Lord Jesus father here we are Lord him were here together with gathered around the revelation of Jesus Christ nor we're not gathered around preachers or singers but we're gathered around who you are to us O Lord and as we sing you are our worship Lord you're our peace Lord you're you're the reason why we leave our homes Lord Lord and father we thank you for just allowing us to come and be in an atmosphere of saints of like precious faith as Lord you see the hands that are lifted to you but know most of all you see what's in our heart you see the intent behind the raising of the hand Lord and father we pray that you just move by your grace Lord and Lord let our desires Lord and the things that we think about be according to your perfect will nor nothing Lord we don't want anything Lord that's that's not your perfect will for our life nor for we know that it will just utterly fade away like vanity if it's not your perfect wheel blow we printed you a blessed this church Lord all those who are here Lord God and the saints of God that come from far and near and they let the word Lord have the preeminence in this building Lord no God that will be lifted up out of our flesh Lord will have communion with our mighty God tonight Lord that no circumstance no situation I'll be able to stand before you without you dealing with it Lord so let our faith arise and let the enemies be scattered and all we love you and we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray in the church say Amen church say Amen again hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's go to the Book of Isaiah 55 you know and I'm uh I'm probably not gonna say anything that you haven't already heard but that doesn't mean that it's not meant for the service you know cuz sometimes we can hear things and we were like well I heard that before and we don't take it with a sense of urgency so let's not do that listeners let's say that whatever said tonight is for me amen this doll is for me Isaiah 55 and let's um let's start at first six you have a say man the Bible says seek the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the LORD now you notice that didn't say said Isaiah he said saith the Lord hallelujah so Isaiah is speaking first person on the behalf of God the Bible says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain coming down in the snow from heaven and return if not tiller but water of the earth and making it to bring forth and bud then it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth now before I go any further look at what I said type that verse of scripture when he said he said the word coming forth is just like the rain coming and when the rain comes down it comes out with a purpose to bless the seed it comes down with a purpose that whatever it falls on that that life might come for so the rain coming forth has a purpose to deal with that seed life and he said so is the Word of God will it come forth there's a purpose behind it hallelujah so share the word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return Oh youyou unto me void the rain doesn't go back up in the sky neither does the snow gap go back up in the sky but it has to accomplish the reason why it fall hallelujah he said in its shell he said it must accomplish that which is prosper and it shipped it must and it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it hurry let's go to st. John 10 st. John Jim chapter st. John 10 and I just want to read off let's go to verse 34 and then we're gonna read Malachi 3 and you can have your seat st. John 10 verse 34 the bible says jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said Ye are gods if he called them gods unto whom the Word of God came has the word come to us somebody talk to me has the word come to us we have the word a man we have the unleavened bread of God and now the Bible is backing it up by Jesus Christ he said that the Word of God came to they have called you gods oh my isn't that wonderful if if he calls them gods unto whom the Word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken hallelujah say of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent in the world that blessings because I said I am the son of God if they're not yet the works of my father believe me neither I do not the works of my father believe me not a man Malachi 3 and I was worried verse 6 Malachi 3 and verse 6 oh my you know just see a scripture and get excited about it hallelujah if you go on through anything tonight I want you to put your trouble in this verse Malachi 3 and verse 6 put your situation in this verse verse 6 the Bible says for I am the Lord I changed not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed they made a lot of blessing of his word you can have your seats amen by the grace of God I want a youthful subject tonight the word expressed but my inspiration for the stock is is in the form of another statement God's thought process you know if you think about it Church what what would it mean to you and I if we could just see what God was thinking you know right now in the service if we could just know what God was thinking about and we knew this thought process if we do what was on God's mind you know Church I'm gonna make that very clear tonight we already know we already know what God is speaking because we have his word God doesn't think outside of his word because the prophet of God says God is perfect so when he he wrote the word or he spoke the word that was it he doesn't come back and add more to what he had already had to say God doesn't grow in knowledge and wisdom hallelujah what he said it was perfect he don't have to come back and say oh I left out something for my brother's trial I left out something for his trial no he gave enough in his word with he spoke in the first time so gosh Oh church we have what God would think about in every situation we go through right here all you gotta do is find out your situation according to this Bible and you know how to move hallelujah but church when we look at it and we'll just think about God's thought process and what it means to have the expression of God's Word now we know that the prophet of God said that a word is a thought expressed but before it got you a word it was on God's mind haruya now listen let's go before there was ever anything cream and let's just look that God was just there all by himself and we know that the Prophet said before then he was just God eternal hurry he was just there holding all space by himself you know it's crazy to me that we have people on the earth that don't believe that there's a God he's done too much to prove that he is a god oh yeah I can't speak for nobody else's life but I can talk about what he's done for me hallelujah and he's been good to me he's revealed perlier himself to me in a mighty way he's done things that I couldn't do my own my job couldn't do my mother couldn't do my family couldn't do but God did hallelujah so it baffles me when people haven't they've been deceived to say that you know all of this was created by a big bang church we're constantly having big bangs and earthquakes in and volcano eruptions and all these things but nothing else is being created from it oh yeah so where do they come off saying that in this space of time that there was a big old boom and all this came forward ridiculous no that was an eternal God hallelujah who had some things on his mind oh yeah he was sitting in heaven huh and he said you know I could just see it turn I just see God sitting in heaven in space holding all space in time all by himself and then God began to think table begin to say to himself right there in that moment God had sauce that holy God looked at it he said you know what there's not enough of me that's being revealed think about that church God began to look at all the earth and creation or even space just eternity and God is saying there's not enough of me on this plane listen to the stops how do you God knew that he was more than just eternal so God is now gonna take hallelujah the whole world the whole earth through the process of what he's thinking hallelujah so God so God is sitting there holding on space and time and God is saying you know what yeah I'm eternal but that's not that's not all of me he said you do what i'ma savior hallelujah but there was nothing else then these are God's taught for us so God said you know what I'm allowed something to be created that can be lost so I can demonstrate myself but even in that hurry God wouldn't satisfy consonants deal more to me to be revealed he said you know what I'm a deliverer so God had to let something get bound Wow so his thoughts could leave his mind earlier and move into an expression moving through a manifestation God had thoughts God sitting there and God's thought says he's thinking now God said you know what my thoughts are no good to myself because it is mine nobody knew what it was it would just be thoughts and I want to make this very simple what good are your thoughts just alone in your mind church we never hung Liu you know that we could fly in an airplane if the top brothers that is if the white the Wright brothers didn't put their souls into action hurry if their cells didn't become a word a word Express so when you see a 747 it's the south of the Wright brothers Haru you somebody caught their inspiration in hand and they taught what the Wright brothers was thinking about it hurry and they tapped into the same mind not a different mind but the same mind that's what Jesus said let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Church if you can pick up God's thoughts you can find yourself holier manifesting actions of a God you know if I can let's go back to what brother Samuel saying we're so spoiled think about denominations don't know what we know they'll sing songs about it i believe i can fly i believe i touch the sky i think about it every night and day spread my wings and just fly away i believe i can so see they can sing about it they can catch the inspiration but we believe it's going to happen [Music] holy we're not flying as angels no we're gonna be translated and sons and daughters of god hurry so this dimension can't hold us why because we're made up of a material hallelujah that cannot return to god void because the Word of God cannot return to God boy hurry up and read make up that part of God which is the word made manifest but you know what we've heard so much and we hid things like this it don't even excite us I just told you you can fly and we sit there like in an airplane Oh what is it the Delta 88 no I'm talking about in the dimensions of God oh yeah I don't know about you but I think about it every night and day and you know what I'm not looking to spread wings because they I'm not an angel honey I'm a son I'm not gonna need no wings huh huh the Bible said that I'm a god holy we look at one place where God hasn't have wings to step into other dimension oh let me excite you a little bit Church Holy Angels higher you can't sing songs you can sing they feel out of place when you worship hey man you seem so today that my god is awesome they don't know what it's like hurry to internship failure and then see a mighty God come in and show its awesomeness angels don't know nothing about that you know I know you sing the song here but you catch the inspiration in your mind you know in your thought process when you're going through something and maybe a song comes we make miracle work promise keep light in the darkness my god [Music] angels don't think they've never seen God as a waymaker holy when they look at God all they see is holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty but we because of our thought process we not only see him as holy but we see him as my key wonderful counselor Prince of Peace that's how we think about our jihad I think about him as a way makers and the prophet of God said o my church the prophet of God said if God ever told you something he has to make a way forward to come to pass oh but listen God was in his eternal space having a thought and I want you to catch that all God's thoughts were concerning you because he could've just stayed up there all by himself eternal that would have just been for him but he had thoughts of time and process concerning you hurly thoughts of time that would say hurry up there's going to be a day of resurrection hallelujah that all of your sins would be forgiven honey and there was going to be a time in eternal time it was going to be a situation of space and time where you was never had to be sick again if you don't want to I want you to catch what I'm saying now when Jesus went to the cross honey what was he doing he was going through the process of his mind that he's a healer hallelujah she Harley he knew Harley that he was the logos hello him you self existed he was eternal but he also knew that he was this great healer now when a Bible says I'm the Lord and I changed that I'm the Lord and I hear thee from some of your diseases talk to me church all of your diseases so in God's mind hurry God knew that age was coming he knew castle was coming he knew high blood was coming he knew tuberculosis was coming or whatever Graves disease he knew all that was coming and God said you know what I got a step in time so I could stop listen what I want I want you to see what was God doing he will stop it devil stops devil said I'm gonna make you sick God said no you ain't huh so not only haruya was he doing something for us but he was stopping the enemy from what he was thinking he was making the devil mine fall subject to the way that God would move Oh churches we looking we see Harlan that God hallelujah he knew all these things are gonna happen so God said you know what I have to make it wait huh but in God's thought process what I want you to understand see I want you to come along tonight I want everybody this is the because I want everybody to take these fake leaves off take off all your religious clothes put them on your feet stomp on them and let's have some church honey because what I want to do tonight by the help of God and your poor I want to create an atmosphere that says all things are possible huh because that's God stop rushing God God in his mind in God listen why how God thinks in his mind God is saying before he ever made this was written down God said that I'm unstoppable I think I got across to preach up in here y'all don't hear me I said my god I said my god he's unstoppable unstoppable my god in his mind hallelujah he believes her that he was unstoppable so he believed it he's spoken and once he spoke in her ear it came to us holy now is mine cuz God can't take it back hallelujah so I got a right to say to every sickness every trial every tribulation that my god is unstoppable unstoppable Oh Sheikh Abu he loud Paul under the inspiration to say who shall separate you from the love of God before I go any further I want you to catch the text as a process of the word listen the scripture says in 2nd Timothy 3 all Scripture is given by inspiration so let's go out the window Oh Isaiah wrote Oh John Matthew wrote Oh Scripture is given by inspiration oh well you know Moses say that Oh Scripture you say old Timothy oh scripture was given my god but listen why he gave it oh yeah because the scripture heard the inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness huh so the scripture hallelujah is there to make us perfect hallelujah that's why God expressed his word he expressed that whenever we read we got a right to believe that it'll do what it says now if yo if God has ever failed you what I want you to do I want you to get up and leave this building because you holding us up I want you to get up and leave no disrespect to you hallelujah but if you if you feel like God has failed you I want you to get up and leave because the Bible says he cannot fail I just preached a message on the character of God and what I did was I came out of Corinthians 13 dealing with love and the way it came about me and my daughter was sitting in the living room and she was reading and I don't know what she was doing was almost like she was studying because she was reading something and she came across this quote and the quote that was love it said that God he said that love never felt it I want you to catch this church calculate man love never felt and we know that God is love and then the quote said hallelujah love never faileth so if it fails that mean it was never God so you believe in something and it fails that mean it was never God in the first place because God never felt it honey since that's his expression amen the expression of God holy God knows no defeat there's nobody on the planet nobody in space nobody in the history that can ever say they got the best of God no you know what I'm doing tonight I'm talking about your God the one you serve the one that this message hallelujah brought us back to her took us away from armed religion and and seats and windows and all that stuff but brought us back to the mind of God and that's what we are when you read this Bible you're looking at God's thoughts concerning the matters of your life her Leah listen I wanna read something to you now to catch what I'm saying you got to have a revelation of God that's why when Jesus Jesus walked to the disciples he says who do men say they said this they said that some say John some say Jeremiah some say life and then Jesus narrowed it down he says who do you say see God always wants to know what's on your mind because what's on your mind you're gonna speak you know God always puts us in position for the real you to be on display cuz we can fake each other out we can come to church dress nice do all the stuff but what comes out of your mouth when you go through a trial that's who you really are when you're the trial oh god I thought I had the whole ego ha I'm fat that's what you really are a crybaby - y'all know God Hey - God don't like crybabies listen we got we got a message on this call why cry speak how do you Moses it looked like he was justified look like he had a right running the gun cuz it's big old see standing in front of him but then he runs to God he says all about what we gonna do just see gossipy shut up Moses stop cryin to me haven't I been with you all this time haven't I done signs and wonders better yet listen to God's mine Moses he comes forward and Moses he comes God says I've heard the cry of my people and I've come down huh Brahma sending you so where was God he stepped in Moses body see God's mind said hallelujah he can do it himself but he rather do it through you because that's gonna build up your confidence think about the church to realize in a situation or in a matter in a child that God is living inside of you God hariya is performing or defeating the battle because he's in you listen he tells Moses Moses Moses starts to cry listen to Moses thoughts listen to his thinking oh god I can't talk Oh God who should I say they send me oh god I did this Oh God God says shut up and then God says who made your mouth see you know what you know what God does honey right what God does he's talking to you and you can't believe that you belong on that place where he's at so what God does he never leaves you there he wants you to know where you belong so what he does he talked to you and talk to you until you get to a place to where you make a step to come up where he is that's God's whole thought process not to leave you down there but to show you you belong right beside him better yet he said I not only be with you but I'll be in you oh yeah thank you brother hallelujah see that's God's old mindset he can easily do it on his own but he wants to do it through you that's why he created us earlier while he created Adam and Eve because he wanted somebody there on the earth that represented him oh yeah the animals huh didn't represent him earlier oh hey honey it was a tight there was a shadow but it wasn't his image read your Bible hallelujah the animals wasn't created in His image Halle the mineral creation wasn't in his image hallelujah but then he made a man and he saw his refraction you a regenerated son and daughter of God is this thing God was thinking from the beginning his likeness this image oh yeah that's what he wants us to see ourselves amen now in order for you to see yourself like that you got to see who God is and God never fails God never lies God never worries Oh God thought processes I got to stop high blood pressure I got to stop stress I got to stop all these sicknesses that's that step that's coming in the body how am I gonna stop it by me living in them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost can stop any sickness you can stop any doubt you can stop any fever hallelujah do you stop anything that doesn't represent what God is already spoken hello oh my do you serve that God do you serve a god well you can say right now in your seat that in my situation all things are possible [Applause] let's read a little bit we almost there see what I'm doing right now I'm fighting through the atmospheres of knowledge those of you who got this message and you know it and you examining everything I said about what you've studied remember the Word of God hallelujah is given for purpose earlier God gave preachers for purpose don't give a for ministry for a purpose and one thing I realized especially brothers brothers can look at one another and be like well brother I already know that but one thing you might be missing is the gifts you might know it but do you have the gift we almost never see one thing about God God knows everything you're gonna go through so he allowed certain things to arise not only for that moment but for things to come she didn't God's process he said I need a man after my very own heart and just notice he chose a little boy a little boy named David who was very insignificant you know yet I believe six other brothers you know and they were tall and smart and probably wise and and looked like they were Kings but when God came holy his thought process is he wanted a man holy they had two good qualities one good quality that David had it was easy for him to repent see God didn't choose a man that would be easily hardened hi honey he chose a man that was wrong he will say Lord forgive me and let me suck Church that's why he told you [Music] that's what makes us brides because we have an ability to repent oh that's why Cain was not out of Sun honey because he couldn't repent he couldn't see his thinking was completely against how God would think and instead of saying Lord I'm sorry help me to grow he got angry because God didn't do his way but look every time David was shows his faults what did he do quickly quickly second thing about David there was no compromise when it came to his God's ways see I appreciate Solomon but it was a different book David and Solomon Solomon was like uh-uh what you would call a wise man he was a wise man but Solomon was like if there is a if there is a hostage situation you know and all of us a hostage Solomon would come in and negotiate he'd come in he said well you know I give you this if you kiss me that remember you had a thousand wives so he was good at it God builds him with a mind of wisdom to be able to negotiate and process things so Solomon he'd get in such situation he creates treaties and peace treaties and do all these things and for the sake of saying God was leading him and no doubt God was leading him he was one of the wisest men on the face of the earth but David wasn't like that Solomon Solomon hostage situation Solomon coming in and he want to see everybody survive David come in David come in and say I get you for you get me oh yeah David come in said i'ma get the sniper and whoever died yeah I hope they life right oh yeah David didn't come in compromising and I always liked the story look at his process look at David's mind where did it come from God he was a man of the God's very own heart and the way he thought about battle the way he thought about certain things was the very way God would react in that situation you know first you know we are probably with people we see somebody dancing the word by the Solomon [Applause] the word by the Solomon you go to David wasn't worried about who thought about what kind of dance he was doing even his wife gave him backlash did that stop David from dancing because his dance was unto the revealed word huh why was he dancing because in his mind wow it is mine he saw victory hallelujah his thought process was I need to shouting dance because now I got victory watch I see the Ark of the Covenant on his way back [Applause] [Music] so his thought process hallelujah was just like God would think because God represented the Ark of the Covenant earlier and David knew once this Ark is back we are unstoppable but his wife looking at it she looking at it on the French Oh King Keaney and danced out his clothes Soloman looking at on the flesh oh I wouldn't be that ain't a message dance what is the message dance what is the message song let me leave it alone fire fence some of y'all I know some of y'all got your own religion you know got our own way hi just how we doing don't bring that down south stuff up here y'all know in heaven it ain't gonna be no longer to the latitude and he gonna be no saint from the South same something off maybe don't say from Africa say from Canada it's gonna be holy children of God [Music] and we gonna be so into and if I break it down y'all gonna bring it down right with me then ain't gonna be no difference in our worship it's gonna be all one hot spell Jesus Christ I love God worship oh but you look at David's mind David had the mind of God and what-what-what's was strange to me you look at how he how he operated how David moved David went to neighbor and he came down at David say my soldiers are tired all these things give us some food and listen to neighbors stinking are giving nobody nothing i hain't seen David I ain't seen nobody I ain't doing none of that it got back to David David okay you gonna feed us imma kill you your brothers your mama your causes imma kill everybody in your family everything related to you going but I want you to catch the thought process of the bride honey he comes Abigail oh yeah she heard was neighbor heard oh yeah but there was a different manifestation behind her actions oh yeah because she heard what David said and she knew that once that word was spoken he cannot return voice and using that could change it was a repentant heart that's what the prophet of God said in spoken words the original seat he said your words your thoughts what spoken will meet you at the judgement he says you said something wrong it'll be right there the only thing that changes is if you repent before that Judgment Day and Abigail comes and she meets David has all her hands maids get all the food together why what does she do she tapped into David's thought process that's what the bride is able to do honey she's able huh - stand back God's wrath oh yeah that's why we're still in the earth but because we're keeping this world from being destroyed because God's children is still here on this earth hallelujah and Abigail meets David bow down her ear and all the hands maids they present the food and sell these these pleasant things these Pleasant words to Davis and David says I'm gonna spare y'all oh yeah what stop that wrath it was holding the character of a bride her thought process knew how to get mercy out of the King oh you thought process oh yeah for those of you who may have sick blood once your thought process should know how to get healing out of your king it should know how to get mercy out of a merciful God this will know how to tap into God's thinking no no me I'm about to close let me read something to this everybody all right how many feel like your prayers gonna be answered tonight half of you that's pretty good I don't know why the rest of y'all here cuz I also hope you ain't come to see one another we come together around the Word of God you know I want to challenge you tonight the prophet of God says that signs and wonders automatically follow so believer it follows the believer you don't have to do anything special all you have to do is be a believer hallelujah I was I was telling brother samuel testimony today that i heard from a brother who preached in our church from south africa and you may have heard it but for the sake of it might be somebody here not heard i'ma tell you once I hear your testimony i'ma tell cuz once it's spoken it has to go out and do and accomplish why it was spoken it can't return the Lord just bringing all kind of good stuff it can't return boy there was a young man in the Army in the military in Africa and he you know was a Christian and he had a UH tuna sergeants all that stuff and everybody made fun of him because he was a Christian you know on the daily basis they laugh and play jokes and tricks and all that stuff and one day they wanted to have a group a group joking I can't think the right word but they want to do it as a group play a big old joke on him so you want to make fun of them what we will say today bullying and you know church the pastor said you know what I'm gonna do it not cos I'm sorry the sergeant he said you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna give him a fake key to this truck and I'm gonna tell him go over there and crank it up and we and drive it cross over this field and we are gonna have a good cuz it's gonna be a fake key and then gonna work he's just gonna be sitting there doing like this cuz you know anything all Christians are gullible they think that's why we on the job they come to us and say wouldn't you like the work some overtime trust me when they coming to you that's because they can't keep nobody else to do it and [Applause] it's the devil motivate him cuz it's normally on your church hours but I think you just so gullible enough you think you ought to say no I got hallelujah God doubts he said I'm Jehovah Jireh he's my provider honey that's the whole reason why God told Abraham to go kill his son because he could see God was a provider who what came out of that trial hallelujah the only thing came out of that trial was Abraham raising his hands proclaiming that God is over diorama so God let us go through things so we can catch a revelation and our words can become material in that trial Abraham huh Leah his words became material in that trial why cuz he caught the revelation that God will provide you sometimes the only reason why you go through things is because there's a revelation there's a spoken word sitting on the back of your toe and you haven't thought about speaking it yet so god I'll allow you to go through a trial so I can come out if you don't catch anything I want you to catch spoken-word cannot return to God fine if it's God speaking to you now but this young man this particular day sergeant clubs he says he says all son I need you to drive this truck across the earth and young mr. okay sergeant young male scared he say oh I can't drive I can't drive he asked me to drive oh I'm so afraid so you know what he could do the only thing he could do you know what that is three Church you've done all you can do in a situation the only thing left to do is pray and believe huh Leah em and now I'll just pray and believe but give God worship that you believe was praying about don't play by something still worried about it that means you don't believe but if you pray and believe lack the spoken word come around your mouth of faith honey you praying for a loved one say yeah I know my child don't get the Holy Ghost that's why I'm here today because no matter how worthy I look no matter how bad the church people talked about me they cut my momma they say your boy Worley you got on gold chains he got on Jordans you look like a basketball player he might be a rapper my mama would say no I see a son of God oh yeah it don't matter what somebody in this church say about your child what do [Applause] you think about it you think about all the people that come to rehabs father see your daughter Holly your daughter Holly your daughter Holly he might say yeah she might be Holly but all the same she might be hardly any of those dining jerk who she might be harlot but she marriage to the general she might be harlot but the lineage of Jesus Christ is coming through huh who God allowed all that happened so he can show what he can do through the life of a hot forget God stop process hit a yo girl get caught up in prostitution so another young girl may be out here in the world 20:19 cuz know that God can still save you prostitution ain't strong enough if God won't you hooyah and then God puts a stamp on it not only did he save her he'll ever be a type of Christ in his pride I don't even save her but he left you had a whole whole whole everything about her the expression from her from that point on it all was a type of Christ look at the Sun she had boys who's the type of the kids may redeem whoa whoa and look at the kind of woman boy he chose her a more pipe but jeez how bright you can tell me you break something out of nothing he kept going get it did he call Jessie honey brother King gotta Jessie's house huh he took kicking game put him on the throne only to bring forth Jesus Christ all of that started with a heart so you can say what you want to say about me I know who are you y'all know I'm having a good time right but you know young man puts the key in the ignition he's filling with a feeling within the remember that's the wrong key and it goes in not only did it goes in but it cranks up the truck not only did he cranks it up he don't know how to drive he drives across the field you know how we would say he's looking at the whole platoon and we would say the joke's on you jack cuz you thought he was so gullible but what was he doing he was praying and trusting in his car see what's your thought process were you going through things and this young man he when he got across the field he paused it the sergeant came to him the sergeant was crying the fellas in the platoon they sitting in water eyes huh because all it was a part of the joke no they didn't feel sorrowful in anything in the young man says to the sergeant sergeant you know I hope I did everything right he said so I'm not crying because you drove that a car he said son I can't we gave you the wrong key we wanted to laugh at you he said but that's not the reason why I'm crying he said come on back over here to this truck he brought him back to the truck lifted up the hood and there was no engine in it now I don't know about you but that's the kind of god I serve my god can make things move that shouldn't move my god can make things be that's easy my god can make the impossible become possible in the midst of every critic sitting there watching don't give up on God he done yet hallelujah look Church I was in I was in London honey there's a young lady her name is Becky and she was fighting depression she bought 17 probably probably 17 at the time but she was 17 very gifted you know she was she's going to school you know playing on instruments on the band and they were playing whirling song you got to have collection she's playing worldly or playing worldly songs and something in her she went to a band teacher and she told him she said look now remember I'm talking about your thought process if your thoughts on the thoughts of the word of God God has to back you up huh and you know she was she was a teacher and she says you know what I can't play this kind music her heart would a little do it now that may not be the case for everybody but as for her she said I can't do it I can't I can't do it all and the teacher says to her she says you don't play what I tell you to play I'm a failure now it's kind of harsh when God's thought process and search she got real discouraged this Yetta she went came to school another day they was picking on her because she was dark-skinned did you know all the other kids making fun of her I wish she was my little sister she was my little sister and everybody was picking on her because she was dark-skinned I don't say I say you know what you do the next time they pick on you I want you to look at all I'm in a face and you say you know what you don't understand this right here the black of the berry the sweeter the juice I knew you already thought I was gonna tell in a fight the Bible says kind words turns away wrath but anyway two kids at school picking on her and then she hasn't arguing me about one of her sisters and that was the last drop she said you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna kill myself so she waited as she was alone at home and what made it worse was she wanted to go to a church with live ministry and her parents wanted to stay home on the tape ministry and she like nah dad dad it hurt I says like nah dad we want to be in Turkey for being alive service he's like you disrespect I want nothing to do with you you know so she got all this going on and says you know what i'ma do imma kill myself so she wasted nobody's home and she permits the killing herself then she triangles him and you know at that moment when she decided to do that God begin to think about her in the pastor hallelujah she came on the pastor's heart so the pastor start praying for her and her other sister hallelujah she came on her sister's heart and her sister start praying for at the very moment she was trying to kill herself and in that moment was she trying to kill herself she had prayer coming from this way prayer comes from this way and she said I don't know how but I lost the desire I lost the desire to try to kill myself so I just quit [Applause] my god is also and now she says know what honey God spared her life just in time for her to go to the camp meeting Holly so now she comes to the camp meeting and the Holy Spirit's moving you knows about four days hallelujah and one night I was preaching hallelujah and we was in that worshipping and a young lady Holly the atmosphere was like this I was worshiping one young one young girl say in the middle of her worship she open her eyes and she look up and the tent was open and she said she saw God looking down on us smiling I wonder do you believe looking down on you in this moment smiling at your thoughts smiling because he can see what's on your mind she said when she saw that she couldn't hold it no more she just let it loose and she just started worshipping God and praising God Church didn't move through the place like wildfire God allowed that to happen cuz Becky was there and the Holy Spirit started moving and Becky was sitting in service hardly this was right after I finished preaching and the Holy Ghost was moving through the place like he's done in several times when we've been in this church huh and the Holy Ghost started moving hurry and Becky started praying right down I see and she said Lord yeah I know that the Prophet said we're gonna have to come to the showdown she said lord I need to know that I have to overcome this demon of depression she said lord if you hear if you're moving Lord I'm I raised my right hand and I want you to come touch my right hand let me ask you something can he do it can he do it hold in the hood I said want to do it if you asked what'd he do it he said ask and it shall be given seek and ye shall find knock and the door shall be opened there's no age limit on the Word of God Church him in that moment she raised her hand and she said lord if this is you you're moving and I have overcome the powers of depression I need you to come touch my right hand she's specific my right hand and she said right after that I came and grabbed the hand and I said you are a daughter of God and you have overcome the powers of depression what's on your mind the night church who are you thinking about when it comes to your God I told that same testimony in Kerala hallelujah hallelujah and it was a young lady just foolish enough to believe that God can do it again I want somebody to say if he did it for him he can do it for me hallelujah if he did look at this to the woman in Memphis Tennessee I'm just like that shooter might young lady to service I told that testimony and she is going through all kind of stuff all kind of troubles wasn't really serving God but now she was in a place where she was tender and she wanted God to move in her life once she heard that testimony she was just foolish enough to know that if God did it for her God can do it right now in the service again so she prayed the prayer she was kneeling down and she was in the very back of the church the last row I'm a front preaching and she prayed a prayer Lord if you're the same God I want you to come have brother deeds like he did for that girl come put his hand on my left shoulder and pray for me I want to actually church won't he do it can he do it church holy now what I want you to realize I didn't know they were praying these prayers but who know God knew what was only mind God know what you thinking tonight honey and you know what church I was it searched all of a sudden I find myself in the back right where she is holy shoot bitters out some more people was praying with him now if that was me if it was me I would be like where look like everything's good she's got pretty she got people praying for she'll need me to pray but that was something pushing me put your left hand on so I put my left hand on her and I started praying just like she thought just like she acts for what did that do that brought her closer to God I'm saying that same God he's here tonight in the same service it was another young lady said lord if you did it for her you do it for me now I'm gonna do just like she did I will raise my right hand and Lord I want you to deal with my mind battles so she raised the right hand I came and grabbed on right hand and say i bind every mind battle you haven't right now in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] he's still the same God he do not change and for you young people might feel like well I'm the only one in my house you ever feel like you're the only one in your house serving God Church I know a young man right now hallelujah he was an only child he grew up going buck wild cause he was them cuz he's a miracle baby so he knew that he was special to his parents so he took advantage of that he did whatever he wanted however he wanted whenever he wanted and then one day he met a Christian he met a message believer hug but this just wasn't any old kind of message believer it had to be somebody that he would respect because he was a wild out teenager and this guy he met was a message believer who was a strong man this man could cost in competition he could drag jeeps down the road hallelujah so God's thinking was for me to get my seed this young man he has to meet somebody that he respects but this man is also had the Word of God so he meets this man hug not only that he falls in love with his stature he fell in love with his Christ not as young boy who was running but wild found himself following a strong man Christian cave is like that it seems like that's ridiculous but who won't tell God how to save his people God know what we're thinking so God puts the right thing in our path to get us to surrender oh yeah I didn't need I didn't need a man that can lift 400 pounds but this Mandy hallelujah all I needed was a tender sweet loving mother going down in there praying for me every night earlier but this young man didn't have that his parents was our Christians so god like him to me the Christian that was a strong man somebody that he would respect earlier he know what this young man got seen Holly he felt a feeling to the right her your channel he started living this message and all the stuff now his mother wasn't a Christian nor his dad wasn't a Christian his mother she had diabetes and she suffered from depression honey his father was an alcoholic but he was a hard worker and you look at this young man with the church faithfully serve God faithfully and one day he came home he was kind of sent cuz he's the only one in the family serving God you imagine you young person and you don't want it look like the parents should be taking the lead but maybe God won't use you in church haruya he comes home and one day he finds him a picture on the wall in his hands as for me in my house we gonna serve the Lord he he he had a Jonah nature at that time he said who put this picture up here I'm the only one serving God you ain't got no right put this picture up here he was upset you tell his mom's are you gonna put this up here and you ain't you ain't know y'all certain God with me now this brother that witness to him the strongman gave him like five message books he brought the books

say we have a false prophet this lady had diabetes suffer from depression who's always sick read all five books and that day she gave her life to the Lord [Applause] she gave her heart to God because she started to wondering what's happened to my son he's not the same disrespectful teenage anymore so she we're in his room sigh looking around and she found those books and she started reading the books soon after that hallelujah I saw notice her hands starting to grow out hallelujah her son noticed she got delivered from diabetes hallelujah the Sun notice she was no longer depressed not only

the crib and in the bed and the baby choked and died when she got back the baby was lifeless what's your thought process in a moment like that is it paranoia or is it that my god is able huh see your thought process is gonna bring forth the actions next so she said she she was looking at her child and she was thinking you know somebody else came inside we need to call an ambulance call damage she said before we called an ambulance we gonna bring Holly what are you praying nothing don't happen honey you'll pray again but this sister she took it to another place after she prayed hallelujah nothing happened baby was dead after she prayed nothing happened but then her thought process took her to the scripture hallelujah when when Lazarus was dead Jesus call his name [Applause] Wow will you go through trials what is your thought process hallelujah right there let me tell you something church if you're in a situation in the Word of God comes to your mind God wants you to speak that ain't just a good talk he wants you to speak that South is coming for that moment in church she she prayed nothing happened then the scripture comes when Jesus calls her name so she looks at her child and she says Elizabeth and the baby woke up [Applause] now this made some of you this may seem like this just good stories no this is the revealed word this is who you are sitting among tonight this kind of stuff follows to believe listen everybody all right can't get by five more minutes almost nine o'clock anybody can I get my five moment no I just need no no I'll buy five minutes five ten fifteen twenty twenty-five thirty quarters little sign I got a whole hour [Applause] huh I try not to be that long though listen before it could be a word spoken it had to be a thought because the world is a thought made manifest when God speaks now back in the beginning when God looked down through the corridors of heaven and saw all the things that were going to happen on earth see God already stuff God already saw it was going to happen so his process was okay I got to do this for that I gotta do this for that this for that this for that God was making a way for everything he saw did you ever sit and just draw a picture in your mind how often we do that now that's the way God did it perhaps at the beginning and then it seemed good to him so he's spoken oh my what he was thinking he spoke it earlier he wanted to see a man he spoke a man he wanted to see a lion he spoke a lion he wanted to see the earth he spoke of Earth and as soon as it was spoken it became a word and anyway when it became a word it was automatically a part of God because in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh he said the salt was expressed in the word now listen once God expressed his thoughts and made it word holy he can never take it back so whatever God has wrote in this Bible he can never take it back whatever God has said about you he can never take it back he says where I know the thoughts I have concerning you thoughts of peace and not of evil to bring you to an expecting Oh once it's spoken now it has to accomplish what God was thinking just that's what we had when you read the Word of God you need to look at and you say man it's just what's on God's mind God says you're the head and not the tail that's his thought process he said let the weak say that I am strong halu does his thought process hallelujah he said let the six am healed that's his thought process hey man find out what he's thinking about listen now this part is concerning you this is for everyone listen he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God see the word was God it was God it was his thoughts and and and his thoughts was with him always there god's thoughts is eternal as God is a man that ain't skim milk brother see here it comes here we go cuz toss was his word in the beginning that is in eternity now when the beginning first started time in the beginning was the word God's thoughts and the Word was with God and the Word was God see his thoughts is what he is now I will say something on shaky boots I want you to pull out your big old spiritual gloves and casteth whatever God thought about he spoken no whatever he spoke was what he was Amen now how many of you God thought about how many of you got spoken to exist so you are what God is because God is his thoughts you mean to tell me God all about me if he thought about you that's because you are a part of him and if you are a part of him that's why Jesus could say when you see me you see the father I hope you catching the church if God thought about you then because you are a part of him so when I see you I see God sure his thoughts is what he is that's you what your thoughts are is what you are no matter what you try to live by something else your thoughts is what you are now some of you might in your mind right now you might be thinking brother kind of long I'm tired and you'll become tired because that's what you're thinking but you sitting in the atmosphere you start having thoughts that I'm blessed it might be a little warm in here but I'm blessed booyah you know Bill Gates had half thoughts like I'm rich oh you know what I think sometimes President Trump is shocked he say I'm president half the time you realize it but he takes me down president I feel somebody picking up stones everywhere let me read like hallelujah but you are what you're thinking and you know I like I like to be relatable you know what sometimes I talk about sports they don't mean I watch sports all day but you know there was a time when I was sit down and watch a nice basketball game and I felt like I was a part of you know they got all kind of players nowadays but who they always try to mention the greatest player to the man named played in 20 years but he's still on everybody mind now that's what you call a legacy dribble the ball in 10 20 years but every great player that's relevant now it's being compared to men that played 20 years ago he left an impression on the game why don't we talk about Paul because he left an impression on the Scriptures why don't we talk about rehab because she left an impression why don't we talk about roof she left an impression why don't we talk about Abraham cuz he left an impression hurry up and tonight somebody should be talking about you because the God in your life should leave an impression on the service talk about Mike you know when I talk about go way back when they were playing since I was in Boston I went to the Boston Garden I went up there I looked around and everything your house prints out that count me so I said hey let's go look at this you know since I'm sightseeing you know and I went in and I went dad I'm I'm standing in the Boston Garden but all I could think about was Jordan I said I bet you you brother say I should have been think about Larry Bird no he didn't even an impression on me Mike made me believe that I could leave do you know basketball fan you know what I'm talking about you lost that night you and your mind you're thinking brother preach the word but I'm standing in the garden and all I can think about is Jordan oh and ain't none of his pitches around I got all these pictures of other people but all I can think about is Jordan the time when he played against the Celtics and he's gone six three hundred pound ban saying hallelujah behind that I'll forgive me please cause 63 he was dribbling doing everything and somebody interviewed him and they asked him what was going through your mind in that game his thought process was I won't stop now he was just a regular man like everybody else but in that moment because of his thought process he began to produce what he was thinking nobody could guard him nobody could stop him everything he threw up we need a basket why because of his thought process hallelujah show me your thoughts and I'll tell you you are I'm gonna read one more thing and then imma get out the way see even right now church what do you think we all got trials we got tribulations but the way we come out of it is being positive I don't care how sick you are hallelujah God is able I don't care how much you owe the IRS God is able I tell you another testimony you got money struck I know a brother hallelujah who had a business and he made a certain invention and the invention went sideways that he got sued you know for me as a dollars he got sued you know but he just kept praying and kept coming to church why because he said God is my peace so he kept coming even though he's being sued for me is he kept paying his ties honey in the church you know what happened while he was standing there believing God all these papers on the lawsuit coming here a brother that didn't even know him had a dream about him had a dream about him and even in the dream God gave him just brothers phone number don't tell me who I don't know who we serve in this place we return the would know wouldn't God we serve a god that can move when you need him the booth we serve a god I can speak what you need him to speak searching God gave this brother who didn't know this brother a dream about him and get his phone number and it mean God told him call him and tell him everything gonna be all right so he woke up he still had the phone number wrote it down cause her brother say hey brother my name is so-and-so you don't know me but God gave me your phone number notice he didn't say brother so-and-so a sister saw it so I had a dream last night concerning you and remember I don't know you so this ain't no prank call is that God gave me your phone then will ain't told me to call you and tell you that everything is gonna be alright hug the people that was trying to sue him God work everything all right and that brother didn't know nobody nothing now who go tell that brother God ain't real [Applause] sure let me close with this I mean II believe in God how many believe tonight that all things are possible if you don't know God you haven't given your life to God this is your moment honey we got a pool we got a baptism over here we can fill this thing up right now feel you fill it with water baptize you in the Holy Ghost I'll fall on you tonight there's enough power in here to defeat any sickness perlier i give you another testimony i know a brother who who's going through a lot of trouble he got tired of living and he took a bottle of pills and swallow tried to kill himself honey but because he was a son of God and God I had another thought about him hallelujah he just went to sleep and when he woke up he was sober that's the God we serve he thought when he went to sleep oh this is it I'm dying all he did was got a much-needed rest woke up beside the bottle saying what happened God happened let me come down to close come on musicians come on come on just come to sit in your seat amen listen I want you to catch this because I do everything I didn't say it tonight I want you to catch this God's thought process but I want you to have a certain thought about your God a thought that when it comes to our God all things are possible some of us are facing the greatest trials of our life but I want you to think on your God that he can do anything he's the god of a paradox don't blame nothing yet y'all just sit still for me I really want the church to catch this listen I wish our brothers could put it on the street listen it says if you witness to anything you're just as guilty as being a partaker of it so if we witness say oh yes they ought to have done this so and so be careful what you say because you're guilty the way your judgment goes if you can't decide don't say nothing just leave it alone then when you testify - you are a Christian then you're a guilty see if you say you're a Christian - whatever life you live you're guilty listen you're guilty of being a Christian and you must live to that listen to this church when God makes a promise in the Bible I see a man here in a wheelchair when God makes a promise he's guilty of that promise unless he brings it to pass I told you to catch that now if God makes a promise in the Bible every word that he said until that promise is for field according to your faith god is guilty now you might say how can God be guilty he can't because he's gonna fulfill what you believe listen Church he's guilty they're promised unless he brings it to pass now you might be standing here saying lord I need deliverance if God is the god of deliverance he must bring it to pass or he'll be guilty of not delivering you and I know none of us got a testimony that God don't keep his promises so I say tonight that whatever you believe in look for God to move because he can never be guilty ma listen God is guilty when he makes a promise he made if I say Lord you said in your Bible you say delight myself in the Lord and he promised to give me the desires of my life of my of my heart for I delight myself I serve the Lord I give him everything I got and God don't fulfill my desire that means that was that his word how can God never be guilty he'd only be guilty if he don't fulfill what he wrote and he'd never do that because he don't fulfill what he's wrote that me he wasn't God in the first place listen Church God is guilty when he makes a promise and the Scriptures are guilty until they are fulfilled I want you to find your scripture in the Bible whatever is pertaining to you and your situation and believe in God Harley believed in God in such a way until God has to move because if he don't he'll be a guilty guy Balaam was guilty because he had people that believed in him but he couldn't deliver so he was a guilty God the God of Syria a guilty God the God of the other other of the amory so guilty God the God of the Jebusites are guilty God why because he couldn't fulfill their desires but our God oh yeah he said I never leave you nor forsake you hallelujah with Elijah hallelujah met the Red Hill hallelujah my camera he said let the real God answer by fire holy pail turned out to be a guilty call because he couldn't answer but our God the great Jehovah he came down and he answered by fire and he's still the same car tonight God will never be guilty if you believe the Scriptures will never remain guilty if you believe cuz they have to be fulfilled I have a scripture and I keep laying before God I said Lord you said the Holy Ghost is unto me in my children okay so until I see all three of them filled with the Holy Ghost I'm gonna keep running back to God say Lord now I don't want to say you guilty but I don't see all of them filled with the Holy Ghost yet I say so until they feel with the Holy Ghost you owe me you owe me God all I'm doing is just believing what you said Lord you said now the Scriptures are guilty the Scriptures have to be fulfilled Lord you said if I pay my time I'll be blessed don't make this your big account can be negative 300 that's a lot if you paint your tires somebody believe with me I made that same statement right there in Canada and the sister saying and she confess right there in that moment what she needed in her bank account real faith confesses and then go look for it she confessed it got out of church pull up the app looked at it it was in the bank account [Applause] now can't you imagine in this service cool play me something else it's the same work whatever y'all think can you imagine I'm gonna believe in God tonight unanimously so we're all on the same Accord now can you imagine somebody walking out of here tonight saying that God is guilty because he couldn't do what they stood in need of I say you didn't pray to my god because my God is more than able hallelujah my God keeps all of his promises hallelujah he may not come when you want it but he'll be right on time hallelujah he'll never be guilty oh yeah you always show himself to be the supreme God the Lord of lords and King of Kings Church I went to the doctor a couple months ago cuz I had to renew my license I'm sorry for going so long but remember what we said we're creating an atmosphere tonight that all things are possible don't you carry that hurt out of here tonight don't you carry that pain that sickness out of here tonight don't you carry that doubt back to that situation tonight I want you to go out of here with God's thoughts Church I had to go to the doctor I went in there lady told me so

Dees how you doing I say I'm doing wonderful keep in mind and later just too many diabetes I said I'm good yeah I'm doing wonderful she say that's good everything going good I say everything going good all is well worst thing you could do is go through something and you started talking about the devil you started talking about oh I got this I got this eight I got that a guy got distance just happening to my family my children those my children to CC back smiling saying boy I got him on the ropes I got him on the roads I know I needed him do one more child and I'm gonna knock him out they're gonna backslide keep in mind he can't do no more than what God allowed in church doctor comes inside to us I'm doing good say everything I write everything as well he looks at our chocolate she says whoa Sam's right here you got diabetes I looked her in her face like I did her nurse and say no I don't she say where we just took a test and the test came back positive I said no I don't she says okay well just what we gonna do we're gonna take a blood test you want to get me going hallelujah measure my situation by the blood you want to get me excited you diagnosed me by the blood earlier and I'll shout so Hospital down and she tells me say okay what we will do is we're gonna do a blood sample I said all right she said we're gonna do a blood sample and Dean will see I say well you go get the Machine do whatever you got to do cuz I want to see what the blood see how many y'all know what the brother change the blood has never lost its power it don't matter where you act you don't matter what you doing and no matter what you heard the blood remains his home sir she walks out and she got me on that little table and I'm like Hannah right I can't might be still cuz I know I got the victory if she gonna examine me by the blood all she's gonna see is my sack that's all she's gonna see you see exactly by the blood she'll see red red which comes out to be white so she goes get the machine and I'm sitting on there and to calm down just a little bit so I can talk to my god hallelujah I was already excited don't get too excited that you forget to speak so I'm sitting in a hurry I know I'm already up there's blood and I said Lord okay I say father here we go now I know what kind of demon is trying to slow me down and it's a spirit called diabetes and I said Lord according to your word you said you gave us power to bind in power to loosen you've given us power over unclean spirits so I said Lord in the name of Jesus Christ I take authority over the spirit of diabetes and I commanded to leave this room notice I never confess to God that I had it he was on the outside trying to get in hallelujah but the Bible says resist him and he'll flee so all I had to do is resist in that moment and he got to running hallelujah so the doctor comes back here and she says okay here's the machine she she hooks me up sister brownie pricked my finger the machine goes off she looks at it and she's you're right you don't have diabetes I say I told you but now the doctor is confused she's confused so she started asking me questions like I was a doctor she says I don't know how you can have a positive test and did a negative test and as i sat there or either was I thought I left you know this is kept coming through my mind how can you have a positive and a negative at the same time and God began to rehearse to me he says very simple the spirit was there how do you know when you first went in the spirit was dead trying to find a house he said but what made the spirit leave what's your confession it was there Pulu yeah but when you started to say no I don't know I don't I don't have diabetes that spirit all you could do was stand there he had no house he had nowhere to go then you went in the back you prayed and you bind him so he had to leave completely no doubt you can go in a spear to be there but whether he gets into your temple is what comes out of your mouth and this is the clincher God showed me that but I didn't share that with the doctor but this is what the doctor says to me not my mother just the money what I said was a large sweetie it was the same thing again God don't change she says well mr. Dix what did you eat last night it was a little different this time I said sweet tea and some chocolate chip cookies and the doctor says to me y'all listen to me good the doctor says to me oh yeah cookies and tea will show up in your system like that and I said oh really so God gave me a little revelation I said okay if you look there and you saw cookies and key why don't you try to change the name to diabetes call it what it is it's cookies and key whether the name change into diabetes and I tell you your problem is something that you've done something you put into your life Holly did the devil comes with some extreme name that you can't explain to get you to believing in it you know I got I got a demon of stress on me no stresses call your job or your children something natural take care of that area in the spirit of leave that's all it is the prophet of God says before it ever comes the spirit you have to receive it as I thought many times we go to the dollar we go feeling pretty good and then we go in and say oh you got cancer and once you accept that thought cancer comes in your body that's how the enemy does he wants to talk you out of it but stand your ground get your thought process right stop letting it be a bumper sticker what would Jesus do let it become a lifestyle let it become a lifestyle come on sing that song how many of us believe in tonight how many
