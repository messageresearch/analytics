giving ourselves to you Lord that you may come and work or through the gift to be able to speak to the hearts lives of the people tonight we ask your God for your guidance part in for you to receive all glory in Jesus Christ name Amen [Music] I'd like to read tonight from first Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 1 through 11 I like the title this as a thief in the night but of the times and seasons brethren we have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape the ye brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief you're all children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night they that be drunken are drunken in the night let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and of love for in helmet the hope of salvation for God had not appointed unto us wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we shall live together with him wherefore comfort ye yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do may be seated I at the graveside the other day I mentioned some things and definitions on them the word sleep and it's used here in the first 10 as where it says whether we wake or sleep and that word sleep there means to be absent from this body but in verse 6 it says therefore let us not sleep and that's a different greek word that's used there but it means to yield to sloth and sin to be indifferent to one salvation so it's even though the same words used in the English language is two separate words in the Greek we I mentioned the other day that as the scripture in the previous chapter of first Thessalonians 4 that it mentions about those that are asleep in Christ and we mentioned about when Jesus had came to wood - the man come to him ask him to come and pray for his daughter he said that she's dead and the word dead there means has come to an end and Jesus said she's not dead she has not come to an end but she sleepeth and he we I said we use the words in the scripture sleep and asleep and sleep with them and these words because when you die or if when you depart from this body you're not dead you're alive somewhere and we that believe this message is sent I'm message we have a revelation of that that many don't have we there are many if you talk to the nominal Christians as I have there's many of them that they have questions on what what where do you go when you die they they know heaven but they don't know what it's going to be like and and they wonder if they'll know each other or whether they'll know one another or know their their father mother or their husband or wife or or these things you know but we have a revelation in this end time and we understand that realm a little more than what those that are without the prophet can understand we know that there is a dimension that's beyond what brother Bentham called the curtain of time and in other words that dimensions not dependent on time and I was thinking today that how many years that brother branham's been gone and I thought but in the dimension where he's had there is no time it's they've already stepped into eternity but coming back to this verse six therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober there are people that you preach to you talk to and they seem to be indifferent about their own salvation they seem to be so wrapped up in whatever whatever pleasures of this world that they have succumbed to they're so wrapped up in that and so wrapped up in what this body can feel and what this human spirit how it makes it feel and you know how it works on their brain or whatever else that are so wrapped up in that that they totally lay aside their own salvation other Benham said the way people live today is like as if Jesus is going to send them angels down to broadcast when he's coming and it'll be put in the local newspapers and on the news so that they'll have time to get ready but the thing is the Bible says he comes as a thief in the night and it's a it's a secret catching away I've seen pictures of graves split open planes crashing cars crashing always that doesn't sound very secret but the Bible says this is going to be as a thief in the night it's a secret come brother Branham said it's a secret catching away second Timothy chapter four someone bring me the water second Timothy chapter four verse eight henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not only not to me only but to all them that love his appearing I'm looking forward to the appearing of Jesus I'm looking forward to that day when he shall appear and we'll be caught up to meet him in the sky amen but you talk to sometimes two different people and when you mention to them about the coming of the Lord of the Lord's appearing they they look on it as a horrible thing you mean the world's coming to an end they don't want to hear about the world coming to an end to them that's a it's a horrible thing and I say tonight that in your heart if it's something that when we talk about the coming of the Lord if it's something that scares you then the thing is you're not ready if you're ready to go there's nothing scary about the coming of the Lord we look forward to his appearing those people are just living for the present day you're living from day to day just for the present life I remember brother branham talking about these different celebrities and so on that have all these mansions and all those things and everything and he said don't look at that he said they're having their millennium now but ours is yet to come and it's going a man and it's going to be a wonderful time of peace a man there's not going to be any worry and you know I say this today they've got it all over the news about this virus and all these things I'm not worried about that because the Bible says the plague shall not come nigh thee those plagues aren't for me they're for this world because they have rejected the Word of God the plagues never hit Goshen but it hit Egypt 1st Corinthians chapter 15 verse 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen we shall not all be separated from this body there will be some that are those that are alive and remain as the scripture in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 says and but though were in this body they come back a man in a different body we are changed we're all changed and it said in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the Trump side and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory bow death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory in the Old Testament Satan thought he had victory in death because the price of redemption had not yet been paid the blood of bulls and goats could not accomplish that and so and this is where the Catholics I believe would get their doctrine of purgatory is because there was a place called paradise where they were they were held captive the Bible says because the price of redemption had been paid but once Christ died then spilled his blood then he paid for their Redemption and that's why he had the authority to go into paradise and set them free he had the authority he already had the power but he needed the authority and he got the authority by shedding his blood giving his life a man he paid a debt he didn't know I ordered that I couldn't pay I needed someone to wash my sins away amen now I sing a brand new song Amen what is it Amazing Grace a man that can reach down and touch and pull up a sinner such as eyes amazing grades that out of families that never heard the word you to find their be one or two or or whatever they come out of that family that God opened up the truth to election you here tonight because God selection or the venom said this is how quick the rapture will take place because it'll be in a moment of twinkling of an eye he said just try to time how long it'll take your ID to twinkle that's just how quick the rapture of the church will take place I remember when I was a just a young teenager and I wasn't I didn't have my life dedicated to the Lord I used to if I couldn't find my mom I get scared maybe the rapture took place and I got left but if you have that fear it means you need to get ready this is the only morning you're ever going to get is right now on this side that he's coming there's not going to be a warning 30 days out that because the Bible says no man knoweth the day nor the hour that the son of man cometh but you should watch and be ready live every day like his coming the next moment you know in when Pearl Harbor was attacked you know that they tried to portray this being like it was a surprise but they had already been warned that the Japanese fleet was coming together and was drawing near but they ignored the warning they they didn't believe it brother Branham talks about how they had a big shindig the night before a big party and highly celebrated and all that you know and and then by the next morning he said those that were supposed to be on watch they've been out partying and they were asleep on the job and so when the attack come they weren't able to give out warning then because it was too late they were found asleep and brother Branham says that's the problem with a lot of churches they're going to be found to sleep on that day they're going to be found in a sleep of not really concerned about their own salvation they say they are but the way they lived shows you they're not and it'll be too late to cry out there we had a storm several storms down in Middle Tennessee here recently there's supposed to be storming tonight again but in that storm over on the north side of the city I lived in there was balls of hail that fell down out of the sky and they were about the size of a softball and my daughter that lives over in that area her and her husband got one and took a pitcher oh it's a week and held in his hand so we can see the size of it and I thought one day they're going away a hundred pounds falling out of the sky and you know when that begins to happen it's too late there's there's no time then you know in the Bible speaks about a rich man who had plenty of wealth he was clothed in fine linen and he lived very wealthy and it speaks of a beggar that sent in his gate begging by the name of Lazarus and he ignored that man he ignored that beggar then a time come both of them died passed from this life and the Bible says the rich man in hail lifted up his eyes being in torment and he said these flames are tormenting me he said have Lazarus because he saw him in the bosom of Abraham said have Lazarus dipped his hand in water and touch my lips because I'm being tormented in these flames never Adam said he likened him to the rich young ruler and said he had his opportunity he was given opportunity he had a desire he was looking and he wanted eternal life but he was more concerned with this wealth and couldn't let go of it he made his investments brother branham said down here on the earth instead of making his investments over there on the other side beyond the curtain of time and so when he come payday he got his payoff of what he had done in this life and that's why it said in hell he lifted up his eyes and remember he said said send somebody back I got five brothers since send Lazarus back from the dead the don't tell my brothers that they'll change their ways and not come to this place and the Lord said let he has Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said but if one comes back from the dead they'll hear him and he said no if they wouldn't hear Moses and the prophets and they won't hear one though he comes back from the dead but he streamed out he did he said don't let my brother's come to this place of torment and I say tonight that's not where you want to go that's not where you want your life to end up say well you're trying to scare us the Bible says in Jude 22 and 23 it says then if some have compassion making a difference on others save with fear pulling them out of the fire so if I can save you with fear it's alright it's scriptural it's not enough to join church brother branham said that rich young ruler was a churchgoer he said he kept the commandments from his youth and he said he still wanted to hold his profession when he was in hell because he called Abraham's father brother M said he might have had a grand funeral but it had some dignitary to speak for his funeral he had maybe the the best of the other town to be his pallbearers but in hell he lifted up his eyes James 5 19 20 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him let him know that he would convert the center from the air his ways shall save a soul from death and this word death here means the miserable state of the wicked dead in hell and shall hide a multitude of sins pardon me you know we're living in a time over the last days the Bible give us a prediction of what the last days would be a prophecy a promise of what the last days I would be he will be heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God said there'd be Janney's and Jam breeze raise up and there's a spirit of the last day that's on the people there's an anointing on the people in this last day there's two anointings one is from God the other is from Hell and the spirit of this last day you watch it work in politics and watch it work in the world watch it work within our laws it's this evil spirit of the last day to where it's it's making it to where if you say anything against you know gays or whatever why your hate speech that's that's that's hate Haiti but the Bible clearly declares that that is an abomination in the eyes of God and yet we see it gaining preeminence in the world and they're passing laws to make it legal and they're passing laws to make it against the law for you to say anything or not accept them into your myths some of these laws I speak of have already been passed out in the state of California it's the spirit of the last days brother Adam said if God doesn't judge this nation for that type of sin then he'll have to raise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize to him because that's what he destroyed him for it takes more than just hearing a good message from your pastor oh you can say all that was good brother Sam I really enjoyed that but did you take it to heart are you willing to become one with what was sad because as the Bride of Christ we're supposed to take the book and eat the book become one with it in other words and the Bible said that he would write his laws upon the tables of our hearts that is not just carried in a book bound one leather but it's carried him behind a veil of clash revelations 19 and seven says speaking about the Bride of Christ said she has made herself ready we've got to make ourselves ready sure God uses the pastor to get his church ready God uses the songs to get his church ready and God uses you to get the church ready and you know brother madam said if our pastor didn't seem to be doing right why would get us a new pastor and if the song service wasn't going just right well we'd say we need a new song leader he said but what about you as an individual how does your life tally up what are you doing to get ready amen God can use the past brother madam said the pastor words were deigned of God to see you through to the rapture God can use the pastor as long as people will listen and yield to what said sometimes we got to preach the same messages over again slap another title on there because they didn't get it the first time sometimes we got to no matter what the title is no matter what the text is seems like we keep dealing with some of the same things it's because God's trying to get you straight now God's trying to get his church ready and I always tell my church I said there's you know you might as well get used to one another because you're not going to have your own little corner in heaven we're all going to be together we're going to be together during the Millennium we're going to live together eternally so you might as well get used to one another now amen but LeBron said don't make a mistake that that rich young ruler made he said Lazarus laid his gate as a beggar but he said when the rich man was in hell he became a beggar and he was begging that he would just let his lips be touched with water where the BAM said you're going to beg some time or other everyone he said so why not beg God for His forgiveness now why not beg God he said to get all the starch in all the world out beg for mercy if you don't you'll end up like the rich young ruler the Bible says that Jesus spoke and said besides all this there's a great gulf fixed between me and these talking about the rich men in hell he says no man can cross that gulf either direction around said there is no repentance after death the time of repentance is now the time to get ready is now once you leave here you leave this body you're gonna raise back up the way you went down death doesn't change you if you go down righteous you'll come up righteous but if you go down unrighteous that's the way you'll come up and don't depend on your own righteousness because the Bible says that that is filthy rags in the eyes of God that was the problem that Paul had were talking with the Jews was the Jews had made their own righteousness there's some people that make their own righteousness by saying well I'm not as bad as that guy God doesn't have a scale or arms of sin sin is sin there's not a scale on lies the brother branham said the devil just twisted God's Word just a little bit to tell Eve a lie just one thing he said made the whole thing alive you know you were you were born with a thirst in your life david says as the heart panna that through the water Brooks soap in my heart after the Oh God as the deer pants for the water room brother right I'm gonna talk about being a hunter said you know the deer has been shot if he can get to the water brook why I can revive within seconds and he says that the hounds may be fast on his heels but if he can make it to the water he'll survive and that's what we need tonight we need to be like David there's no way I can survive without making it to Christ the living water of life he says the hounds are on the heels of every individual so you need to make it to the water Brook people say I don't want to go to hell but they're not yelling willing to yield themselves to Christ say I surrender at all come to the source of life there's a secret coming of the Lord we're waiting for it with anticipation because there's something in the air we've heard amen and you know I say this with all humility I mentioned earlier about those that are in the message have this revelation of the beyond more than anyone else you that have ever heard brother Browning's testimony you have a second look and what was beyond the curtain of time I believe their greeting I believe there's a greeting party waiting when someone crosses over and you know I think about when hope Branham was dying and you know she had two children two babies but when brother branham called her back she said why did you call me back she had a husband and children she didn't want to come back to this side after seeing the other so why did you call me back you know she loved her husband you know she loved her children but friends there's a love on that other side that goes beyond this filial love that's here filial love can get you into trouble oh but I got the love is pure amen hallelujah I've seen people hinder their children hinder the work of the Lord in their lives because of their filial love but if you're gonna Doppel of them you'll let God do whatever it takes to get them ready the Bible says be ready when such an hour's you think not the Son of man cometh all that don't go in Christ will come under the God's wrath and judgment please don't let that happen to you I don't want his judgment I don't I don't want justice I want mercy amen I want the mercies of God I'm not making a contingency plan for if I miss the rapture I'm setting my mind on making no contingency plan I want to go I want to be ready I want to make it I want to be there with all my brothers and sisters that I fellowship with in this life amen what a wonderful time that's gonna be the day of resurrection it's gonna be such a wonderful day I don't want to miss it hallelujah and I like that body changed too this over stinking rotten house I'm living in subject to diseases and sicknesses and so forth them things we have to deal with brother ma'am said sometimes people are crippled up with all these things in their spirit were crippled up because they've got cancer or they've got this disease or that other disease but God is here to bring deliverance he is a healer the Bible says he's the LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases that didn't leave any out but I've witnessed strange things before I prayed for an individual one time the head cancer they had just started coming to church maybe they started coming because they were scared of death I don't know I prayed for them they went to the doctor and the doctor couldn't find the cancer you think that would have done it for them you know what they did they left Church and went right back out into the world and you wonder why did God ever touch that individual brains they'll have to answer for it someday not me where the rim says I would rather be sick and be ready to go than to have my health and not be ready a man less tan Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord and we Lord given ourselves to bring this message tonight and Lord I don't know the hearts of everyone here and nor vast majority of the people Lord the lorda there's someone here I know that there's times you could come to a service and just speak to one individual or there's someone here that's not

myself away [Music] or give myself away sold me [Music] thank you for saving my soul [Music] [Applause] fool [Music] [Applause] Hey [Music] [Music] by grace salvation slowly every [Music] you know brother journey as he was ministering tonight my you know I can remember what it was like to set in services before the Lord really got ahold of my life and you know when we talk about that of getting ahold of our life you know the reality is just like what was spoke through the scriptures today God doesn't come down and take us by the shirt collar and drag us up to the altar because that would be God using force to get us to him but God's a gentleman he wants us to yield to his love that's being expressed he wants a heart that's yielded to him now there's things that God sometimes will do because of his love that he will not lose one that you have to get their attention in some way God will not lose one but what a what a what a thing to wear sometimes as I was saying I remember in years where my goodness there was something quite services I would set in fear would strike my heart I'd be afraid I'd look at those services and I thought many moments the Lord's gonna come and it's it's just hearing I remember those days but you know God made a provision because even in that God doesn't want us coming out of fear but he wants us even as it was said here tonight that we're aware there can be a yielding to him and say Lord I want to be ready now there's not one of us here that could make ourselves ready you realize that what a person anyone could come to this altar you could be in your seat and if there's one speck aspect that is as tiny as even the hair on one of my fingers if there's one speck that's not surrendered in that life it's not a total surrender but God draws us and he comes to bring us even to a place of total surrender then when it's total surrender then he moves down to complete that work that he started God fulfills every word can you say man what God promised in his word when God made the promise repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is certain every promise of God is certain so there is nothing that could ever be wrong with God's promises there was anything at all wrong I would say lord help me to see whatever it is that's hindering me from having having the promise portion that belongs to me because that is our allotted portion that's what the Holy Ghost is it's God's life amen that deposit that's placed within us it brings a full complete change and you know how it is I could never understand stand that I couldn't understand what it is that made a mom and daddy what it wasn't made him do how in the world could they they they they did what they did I thought surely they're they're neglecting themselves but you know what it was there were desires that I had within me because of an old man because of that old sin nature that was still there but all it takes all it took was God coming and drawing upon that into where that the focus became upon Jesus Christ and everything else there ain't nothing else that mattered nothing else mattered no friends mattered no pleasure mattered nothing else mattered when it got to that point right there God bringing me to that point where I didn't want nothing else I only wanted to be saved then that's what God come he started to work in my life and you know what he's completed it and yet he's still working on me I believe with all my heart these are things that we know we're living in a time we see here right now and I'll tell you I said this to the family the other night and we were together even at the dinner and then again at devotion I said you see the way people are acting right now people are fearful you say brother salmon ain't you afraid no I'm really not afraid I've got rest you say what happens if you get the revived iris I've got promises I got promises that doesn't mean I'm gonna be ignorant with things I mean I always wash my hands if you don't wash your hands you need to start I mean you know but but you know what I'm 44 years old and a long time I've lived a long time before they ever had hand sanitizer I lived a long time before they ever had Purell right whites think about right now what's it gonna be I'm glad I don't have to entertain that thought what it's gonna be when the tribulation strikes because right now the Spirit of God because the people of God are still upon this earth it's held intact but as soon as you take out in rapture it all turns loose and you this right here these little things like this they're doing they don't know how to control but you know why that virus it ain't something in a petri dish we're talking about a demon when we talk about a flu and they create a vaccine and they try to take care of this one we're talking about spirits those are spirits that mutate in those things that take place right there but we have a promise God made promise after promise he said I will put none of the diseases upon you that I put up on Egypt walk in my word said I'm the Lord that he'll I think God for a piece and this is what the this is what the Holy Spirit brought to us tonight if you don't have that piece don't leave out of here tonight you can have that piece you can have that assurance you can look and say well I've got to get my life all in order you can't get your life together it takes Jesus Christ to put your life together and it all begins we surrender to say you know what Lord I'm tired I'm just giving you ninety nine and nine-tenths I want to give a hundred percent God will take he takes that life that's yielded to him amen how many can say it's it's a it's wonderful to be a Christian it's wonderful to have that comfort it's wonderful to have that peace amen it's time it's time to get out of here it's time to get out of here you know it's just like this when we think about in the our we're living in and I'm not gonna preach he already preached tonight but I just look at these things and you say well brother sent me what what happens if things take place and this happens and and they listen brother branham promised us he said this right here in his word he spoke of how that that third pole would even come into even even into that full effect even in thought even in that time and let me tell you something the same God that fed Elijah when he was at the brook he still got crows come on somebody he's still God is still in control amen and see this is the rest we are not we feel this we go out we and this is why the thing right now and I'm just talking to you as your pastor don't get all caught up in reading all of that stuff it's okay to be informed but don't become under the influence of it amen we're not to walk in fear we are to walk in a perfect peace in a perfect God that's manifested perfect love bringing about a perfect faith we are to walk with that divine assurance amen let us
