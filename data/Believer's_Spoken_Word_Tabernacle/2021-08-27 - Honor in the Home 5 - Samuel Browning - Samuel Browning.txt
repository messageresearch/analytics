way lord help the people lord help us together lord that we can just step aside you can just step down lord we pray we ask these things more in the name of jesus christ amen if you would would you turn with me to first corinthians 13. okay now i should be i'm on okay all right it should be is it okay is it coming through okay all right let's just let's go here to first corinthians 13 let's just jump straight to verse four charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself it is not puffed up and doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not our own it's not easily provoked and thinketh no evil amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated as we just keep drawing from this as the lord would just inspire to our hearts there's many things when you look in the very first few scriptures and what is wrote there in verses one through three if if that is all that was required or the expectations for serving the lord well there probably would be many people who would go along with that from verses one two and three because those are things that a person you could see my people would be complimentary this person they sacrificed their life this person prayed for someone and they were healed this person spoke in tongues and god god uttered out you know just a tongue of angel and here it was interpreted my look at it that come to pass but we recognize that a christian walk all of these things are necessary to a christian walk it should be it will be a life of sacrifice but the sacrifice itself while paul was drawing this that it's not about self because you realize that a lot of times even within sacrifice sacrifice can be drawn but and it was it can be made known and it draws attention to self but real true sacrifice that's governed by love it never draws attention to self and that's one thing that paul is is dealing with here that this this charity the love of god is not a self-serving love it's a love that seeks the very the very best what is what is uh on behalf of the other person or the other individuals it's not about self and the reality is that when you and i come here into this earth here we come by the first birth the first birth is a very selfish birth it's always about self and we find ourselves even after the new birth has come it gives us and equips us with a power to rule over that first nature it gives us a strength and it's something that every day of our life that we have to bring that we have to bring that other part of our lives in subjection brother bran would say it like this in one place there when he's asked to explain romans 7 and he would speak of how that once that wheat life is entered into our life and it brings about a change in our life it's not a change of something that we are trying to do but now there's a new life that's set down in us and it's a desire for god's life to be brought forth in our life but yet we are still housed about with that old cockerborough nature and we've got to bring it subject all the time and our strength it comes from the lord this is why each and every day of our life we can never even of the things that we've been looking into in the word of god these are not things that are just when we can look at it in one way and say well it's an automatic in the life that's lived out of us and that is true there's a desire that is in our hearts to please god it's a desire to live for god and there are times in our life when there are things that are called for by the word of god and it rubs our first man in the wrong way it challenges us in a certain place and it brings us to a place to realize this is something in an area that i need to die more in my life lord i need your grace and your strength and my life just thinking of it the other day i was in prayer and began to rehearse different things of how brother branham would put it to me it's just so beautifully placed in the message three kinds of believers and brother adam you know he would talk about the tests and trials of life and he says i i don't pray that god would take the test and trials from me but i ask him for grace to go through him and when you think about that as brother brown would work with that in that message that the tests and trials that come our way they are they are predestinated from the hand of god to actually bring about a trying a molding a shaping it's for our good these are not things that has just happened to us but god has permitted it it's to mold us and shape us it brings us to a place of a dying more to ourselves it brings us to a greater realization there's a greater one on the inside that is greater than all of my feelings greater than all of my thoughts it's an anchor that holds within the veil and that's a place that we can draw from in our lives that when situations arise we we should never as believers shirk away from it but we should go to god in prayer and ask god and say lord give me the grace that i need in this situation or the outlook that i need lord help me to be in a place that what needs to be molded in my life can be molded in my life right now even of our feelings regarding certain things maybe an offense has come the bible said offenses will come and we need the strength of god in our life to take it to the lord in prayer not just say well it don't affect me we've got to be honest and real god will always respect honesty and that honesty is to say lord i am offended but god your grace is greater and lord that you would come and remedy that offense that wound in my spirit that charity could have the place in my life see this is why the bible says give no place to the devil paul would write let not therefore sin reign in your mortal body that said we don't want to allow a place of anything a thought a feeling of those things to come about sometimes it takes a period of time of praying about these things and putting it before god in prayer and i i believe that when we look at this in the scripture just little tokens how god would bring out to us even in these moments that you see the very first thing that we started with there in verse 4 charity suffereth long all of those other things in verse 1 verse 2 verse 3 all of those things are great things but if they're not governed by charity then it's not even reckoned up in the presence of god there's got to be a greater substance there than every bit of of signs and things that are all out here there's got to be something on the inside to where it comes down as the scripture said charity suffereth long there's a case that i can say not one of us here would raise our hand and say you know i want to be long-spirited because we realize that in order to be long-spirited it's going to be situations arise that require that in order for chant you see these scriptures we just read here are not scriptures that are expressed on the mountaintop they're expressed in the valley are you with me suffering long well they don't need to suffer long if everything everybody's agreeing with you everything's going just right they're petting you the right way there ain't no need to suffer because there ain't any suffering but it's when certain things come along our way that are we actually able to have let charity have its course in our life and let charity suffer throne because charity when charity suffereth long charity itself is not something that's waiting for the next opportunity to say ha ha i've been doing this hey i've been i've been i've been taking all this look what i've been doing i've been doing that's not charity that's us but charity suffereth long it doesn't build up records it's kind notice it it doesn't envy it doesn't vaunt itself and it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly this is a this is a big statement we've been looking at it does not behave itself unseemly even in those times that it things that you and i could feel like this would be merited and we've got rights you realize as americans we've got rights and we've got privileges but the privileges of sons and daughters of god the privileges of god it trumps every american right there's a lot of american rights we appreciate we're thankful for but when it comes to certain things because there's american rights that say well you know a person can live as a homosexual and everything else and really there's laws against it in the book in every local city but you see they look past all of those things but to realize there's a greater privilege that we have and that's the privilege of god we don't look at well i can live sinful we look at the privilege that i get to live a christian life i i'll forfeit every american privilege for that privilege to have my god-given privileges to serve god so charity itself must be what is there to direct our lives it's charity that moving within our lives that how that we see it it it brings about a real honor and that's what we've been dealing with here out of verse 5 that rather than acting unbecomingly but but rather acting with honor and you know the scriptures as we're dealing with this here of honor in the home and you know every one of us when we look at it here it's just like in a local assembly we get around one another long enough and we're going to see one another some faults and mistakes is that right we're going to know well this the wrong key or this is wrong or that we get around one another this is where it takes a lot of love it don't take a lot of love to go from here to there to there but it takes a lot of love to as you're staying right here with a group of believers in fellowship to be able to overlook one another's mistakes because we all have them we all have faults nobody has angels wings on now we all have our own faults and our own mistakes and we all need the grace of god that it would work as a relationship as a local body are you hearing me it's the same way with a husband and wife you know you know after you're married well now you're seeing where those curls come from those curls come from laboring and putting in the curlers and the hair so that when you showed up the curlers were already there or the curls were there you know everything now you know you're beholding all of these things you know to where that when he got you know uh when you seen him if he still had hair at least it was combed you know teeth was brushed and everything else was was good to go i mean his clothes look pressed and neat and as far as you knew he hung up his towel after taking a shower come on now oh my we're already getting quiet i mean you didn't see all those faults and all those things that are there you know and things laying in the floor you didn't see all of that you weren't even thinking about that you were thinking about that person are you hearing me tonight that's who you fell in love with they had the mistakes they had their faults all along oh my god did not choose you and i because we were mistake-free we were fault-free he never chose us because of that but i think our brother branham would turn and i don't know who the brother is but he said thank brother mike how that god would look clear from there in eternity and god would choose you and i and knowing all of our mistakes knowing all of our shortcomings but yet god chose us because our mistakes and our faults are not who we really are but we are who we are by the grace of god it's his choosing he chose himself and that's where we rest with him is coming back to that principle because when we you know in reality as a husband and wife and i just moved back and forth we did not choose one another because we fit one another's descriptives so perfectly are you hearing me it wasn't because well every t was dotted and every eye was doubted but there was something there was something that was unseen it was an unseen force it was love that drove you to relinquish other friends it was love that brought you to a place to ask her to marry you and it was love that brought you to a place to accept that that that a proposal from that man are you with me it wasn't it wasn't somebody having a gun in your back it was love that did that so love itself now let me just say that i'm saying it being very purposeful in this right here as he's bringing this to me that's something that can that we always have to be mindful of and say god don't let that love escape or leak out of my life and if it does we got to be honest with god and say lord i need a refilling of the love of god brother and sister i'm telling you we can never get too much of the holy ghost you can never even the things that we're bringing right here the teaching as it goes back and forth from spiritual into natural let me just tell you something you can never get anything out of the word of god just in your own measure like it comes when the holy spirit can actually move and energize our hearts in a union with that word he's the life giver of the word are you hearing me tonight there's a love of god that must move down within our life love you know how it is love causes people to do strange things are you hearing me level calls people you know a young lady can be in love and she's so caught up in thinking about him she'll put ice cream in the microwave and it goes in the freezer now you look at that and say how could that be because she's so caught up even though she's doing these things in her natural home but she's so caught up with thoughts about him and he's caught up with thoughts about her then then you begin to talk to him about the toils of the road they begin to look at tests or trials or things that's coming up there's a joy that's there my here in in ephesians 5 let me just read here from this a little bit and pull a little bit more in ephesians 5 and we've been reading through this and i want to i want to come back into this in verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he's the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now i want you to think god never left it to the church to purify themselves [Music] god never left it up to you and i because there's no way you and i could do this but he gave himself he didn't give a letter he didn't give a doctrine he gave himself because there's nothing can replace him are you hearing me brothers let me tell you something there's nothing that in reality within that home and in that marriage there's nothing can replace that position and that desire that god has for you and for that little wife he's given you nothing you say well shouldn't it be that of the lord yes the lord has first place because the husband is under that but nothing nothing can replace that god has placed you there as the leader of that home to be the one who is available to god to receive the guidance and leadership for that home for that for the direction within that on god never put that responsibility to that of the woman god entrusted that responsibility to the man that's the responsibility that is that is had so notice that within this that he gave himself it's him that has alone has that to have the rightful place in our lives to where everything revolves around our life i want you to think of this the real signification of the wife of the lord jesus christ is is that he has sought her out by his word by revealing himself and she it's revealed within her as she submits to his voice and his leading and becomes united with him so that her life expresses him this is why the church world is not the life of the lord jesus they'll go to a certain degree but they won't take all the word they'll take certain things but they want their own doctrines that's why god will not marry anyone who will not come fully to his word that's why the bible said in acts 5 acts 5 48 i believe it is that he giveth the holy ghost to them that obey him not their tenants of belief not their scroll on the back wall but obey him you know not too long ago uh i'm gonna i'm just gonna be careful where i say where i where i was but i was in a uh a denominational church and i you know you hear about a lot of times the tenants and i've read different things as well but you know i turned around and i was going out and i looked on that back wall and there was a banner of everything that they believed and it was a long banner and i took a picture of it it was a long banner of everything they believed so in order to be a part of their system you've got to believe what they believe but where did those beliefs come from now man can probe into it according to the light he has but when further light and truth is come we must walk on with the truth is that right this is why the bible would say that we're not to give heed to the doctrines of devils is that right how brother branham so so so uh specifically states that that trinitarian doctrine came straight from the pits of hell that's his words and it's exactly where it come because it comes satan wants to tamper with the word to try to get at the real relationship of god coming present in christ to be united with his people and i looked at that and that's one of the things that you'll see that separates for that of a wife i mean which one of you as a brother would have married your wife or would marry her if she says i'll go along with this but i ain't going along with that that's a futile mission oneness doesn't come after marriage it further develops but there's got to be oneness before marriage is that right this is why even when you look at how god brought all of them out of egypt there and he took him into the promised land or he he has them in the wilderness it was a proving time it was a time to see notice did god not know what was in their heart god knew what was in their heart but god said this time has been allotted to know what was in your heart the time let me tell you something the time did not do away with what was in their heart neither did time put into caleb's heart what was already there but time only manifested what was there all along and sometimes there are things that time itself has to manifest are you hearing me time has to manifest there's things sometimes we can look at something a certain way feel about it or think about it but thanks be to god we can put it in the hands of god and know for sure if we're trusting in the lord the bible speaks of how that god himself will lead and guide us into all truth and we can look to god for that you see these things as it came about there within israel it only manifests what was already in their heart the whole time and you know but then as caleb and them they came on in to the promised land it was manifesting the whole time that they were a part of that word through and through as a matter of fact when it came time for caleb to take his mountain he said he rehearsed what took place on that side of jordan he said i brought word again to moses according to as it was in my heart it was not just a word he had heard with his ears or a word that he had heard proclaimed or preached over him but that word had found a mark in caleb's heart and that was there in his heart the whole time and here was a uniting and manifesting even as god would declare that caleb my servant caleb he hath another spirit he hath followed me fully so there's a difference here when we when we look at that he gave himself how that the lord jesus gave himself and i want to say it like this he gave himself as our sacrifice but i want to work with this a little bit here and how god will just deal with this tonight but he didn't do it grudgingly this is a paradox how that a life can be lived in sacrifice and it's not grudgingly amen this is where peter would talk about even having hospitality to one another without grudging in other words you know up here and they're like oh welcome down here like oh no okay this is where all of those things as it puts in by love serve one another so how that love itself is is to be the prevailing one and how that christ himself is to be our life to where our life is wrapped around him this is our desire is to please him is that right this he's our life that's what paul said he is our life so to think his love as it says husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it out of his love for you and i he he renders out of his love it renders a respect it renders an honor this is something this this choosing of god it renders a respect it renders an honor to us now let me parallel that even to that in the natural you see it's something to wear he has sought out our rest he has sought for the place that we might have rest where we might come to a place of contentment of satisfaction that we might dwell and he the lord himself he does not like anything that upsets our rest whether it's a thought whether it's an accusation whether it's a trouble he doesn't like anything he stands there like nehemiah when they would come around the gates and they wanted to sell things on the sabbath day the time of rest and nehemiah told them you're not only not coming in here but you better quit showing up outside of these gates and these walls or i'm going to take care of you is that right because you're not going to trouble my people on their rest god himself because you sing why because where there is rest it speaks of contentment it speaks of satisfaction when there is rest there is joy there is delight there is service there is there is just a moving within our hearts it comes from a rest god uses us when we're at rest i mean you know as a minister that the things that even as i'd stand here i could we could god could get no god doesn't force his way down god could get nowhere unless there's a resting in him where he comes down and takes control within a service where he comes down there's got to be a rest which rest is based on that of trust and that of love he works to bring rest in our lives he doesn't disturb our rest he works to ensure rest because where there's rest there's growth is that right so he ministers he provides all that we have need of you see even in our life as we journey here god knows everything that we have need of in this life and in this journey and he's got every bit of it covered just like when we left egypt he's got everything covered they didn't have to find a clothing store they didn't have to find a shoe store they didn't even have to find a grocery store god said i am all that you have need of i've got everything covered so that you don't have to focus on all those other things all you have to do is follow the pillar of fire and i'll provide every thing that you got in need of when you need healing i am your healing he's there to protect our lives he's there to conceal our lives god does not disclose our faults as a matter of fact in in his presence and to think how that he works he works within our lives to to to not only to provide and protect but he works to conceal our faults he sets there as an advocate for you and i he sets there as our perpetuation to bring cleansing to our life his interest is not our faults or our failures he wants to conceal them now think about that in terms of of a natural husband the desire because remember we are his workmanship he conceals that he covers our weaknesses he knows our weaknesses if god right now came down in this assembly and said it started going down name by name i'd probably be preaching to empty pews and pretty soon i'd be out the door because god would lay out all of our infirmity he knows our weaknesses and we all have infirmities but he covers them he doesn't make excuses for him but he covers them he ministers to you and i he gives strength to you and i to where you and i can even come to him and we can can go to him as our high priest and say lord i need help i need strength lord i'm getting a little lacks in this he's not there to condemn us he's there to cover our infirmities and that powerful because there's many things in our life that there's things that you no longer have to deal with it's areas that are not weak there's areas of strength but then there's areas that you find yourself contending with over and over and over again and the devil wants to beat you up and say well you'll never get beyond this or you'll never get beyond this he wants to hammer you maybe about your prayer life or or this or that but god when we can go to god in prayer god is not there to hammer us over that but god said that's an area that you'll trust in me you'll rest in me i'll minister to you just exactly what you have need of god doesn't want us to be independent from him he wants us to be dependent on him my goodness always entertaining he entertains the best opinion now that don't mean that he don't call things out there's times he'll call things out but he'll move right down in the into a service and god knows how to speak to our lives in such a way that it causes us to reach higher and as he's bringing those things out he at the same time we know he's discouraging us in the wrong things hallelujah oh my how many say lord help me in that amen you know he he endeavors within that now you see within this as we were looking at in the scripture of ephesians 5 and i'm going to have to move here but there all through the scripture we find as we were looking at this where it would speak wives submit yourselves to the husband wives being in subjection to your husband and you'll find that all through this scripture here that how be it that that is a single duty of the wife but the single duty of the husband is to love him so what brings about the subjection love without the expression of love it doesn't come into full subjection because subjection is the result not only of love expressed but love received and now that same love is being reciprocated back to the one who expressed it so things sometimes as i think as house it would say that even when we look at that part of subjection that if that in itself would seem hard would seem difficult what makes a difference what made the difference for you from me let me think about our lives i mean let's just just face it here we are growing up in a message church i know not to do this don't do this don't do that we don't do this we do this we don't do that we do this we don't but that still didn't take care of the first master see i was born under that first master and so there's other things that i was doing doing out of fear well this is what i'm supposed to do and this is what but i really wasn't doing it in the right way so it really wasn't submission but what changes it is when god by his love began to knock on my heart that became personal not just somebody in here with a somebody with a green dress has got a headache nope he comes right down to your life and begins to knock on your door and says hey i've been noticing you i'm a little interested in you i like to get acquainted with you he singles you out and starts getting personal with you that's what the love of god does it starts getting personal with our life it starts changing the way you look at things you're no longer looking at like gotta do this and i gotta do that he begins to change in your life what's happening the love that's being projected it's now coming into your life and the things of the world the holds of the world the indifference of the world the bitterness of the world is being dismantled by the love of god amen that's a dying out that takes place so it's a spirit of love that christ-like love on the part of the husband that makes the duty easy you know i think of how you know when we look at many of these things and many of these parts brother adam let me just refer to this quote i don't have that up there but i have it here i just want to read it it's out of the message our restore saith the lord but says if you want to get close to god how many want to get close to god just get close to love it's simple isn't it just love god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength just wrap yourself in a bundle of love watch that man that you didn't like like you do you ever get around anybody you've seen nice people he said you couldn't hardly stand to be around them wow nice people but you couldn't stand to be around them now that's right he says i've seen people maybe that you know you just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that do you realize that you're sons of god the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you that either draws or pushes away that's a powerful statement but it's reality as sons and daughters of god you know a lot of times with men you know lord how brother branham spoke to that storm sometimes we got some storms that are a lot worse than anything any app on your phone alert air quality storm detected come on the holy ghost is a greater detector than any system out there it can detect there's a storm brewing pressure's building in the home there's a storm brewing there's a front coming in oh jesus but to think of the blessedness this is the simplicity of it that god gives us a grace that as a son and daughter of god to realize we have the authority to change that atmosphere to change that situation sometimes it takes changing our thoughts brother branham was thinking a certain way certain thoughts were crossing his mind regarding that man who was coming on the platform the maniac brother brown said it like this i chose to think different thoughts that was powerful god didn't give him different thoughts he chose to think different thoughts he recognized the battle there was a storm that was brewing and what was approaching and he began to have thoughts no doubt this man don't mean that this man's a good man no doubt this man right here he's you know he's a husband he's a father remember brother brown begins to enter in and that entering in goes beyond the situation that he's confronted with yes brother sister this is not just stories these are not i don't look at those things i look at that as application that shows me the quality of this life that god has brought to us in this hour if he did it through the messenger how much more will he do it through the bride is that right to people who can say god i can look to you lord that an atmosphere would be changed oh my the air that you live in to create a situation around you will either draw or push away so when we we look at this with love and i begin to just think upon that that moment and that of sacrifice and a lot of times with sacrifice when we look at that in the in the terms as we're saying moments ago sometimes we look at things of well it's things that maybe that would seem awful hard for us to do and there is things sacrificing is not something that's easy i mean if you give somebody the old raggedy shirt that you don't like wearing well you ain't made much of sacrifice is that right here i wanted you to have well you don't even wear the thing any much of a sacrifice so sacrifice it cost us something yes amen it cost us something it cost it cost in order for us to be united with god it cost him i want you to think of this because sometimes you know we think about this with love and think about serving let me draw you just to just a few moments here into this of genesis 29 20. here's talking about jacob i remember remember the story where jacob goes down and you know he falls in love with rachel and laban who does the same kind of stuff jacob does they're both shysters and laban says you can have her work seven years he works seven years realizes after the wedding night next morning it's leah oh seven years you know i just think poor leah you know but jacob wasn't going to leave without rachel and so he told him and when you see the bargain you know that laban made laban said seven more years notice what the bible says in verse 20 jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her what made the serving different love it was love that made it different what makes it different for you serving god the love of god makes all the difference in the world it's not something that i have to do it's the privilege it's the privilege to do it the privilege to minister to his name when he says something in his word it's a privilege to line ourselves with the word by yielding ourselves to him it's love that makes the difference is that right so love itself was entirely what was different so you know sometimes you know you think about it i've said this to you know others and i can appreciate when they can say i'm not there yet i'm not ready to depart you know for marriage or this or that and i can i can respect that because they're looking at oh my all the requirements and all the responsibility it is a responsibility but what makes a difference is when you fall in love when you fall in love you don't look at everything of oh i have to do this or i have to do that or i have to do this no love is what drives you to it there's an objective in verse 26 look what his love does let me pick up verse 25 and then come down to 26. husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word notice that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so she the bride is a reflection of him all that he has sown and placed within us as the bride of jesus christ that what we have received it's reflected back to him every his love and his care that which is given to you and i ministered to you and i it now reflects itself back to him so that we love him because he first loved us how that god ministers to our life and providing for all that we have need of this is why that god intended and i'm going to be very specific here god intended that a man would be the head the initiator and the leader of all things desirable proper and respectful that the very beauty of the wife would reflect the adornment of such love and carefulness god intended that that's god's order the world today its systems even some of the leading movements that were on the scene last year still around and about when i copied all i went into their site and copied their pretense and their objective is to break the family are you hearing me these very things that are out there these systems it's not the people it's demons they're anointed by darkness nobody in the right mind would have an objective statement to break the family unit we can trace right down in here in history every time man has come that way when it's coming to into communities in the 1960s it actually came in it from that uprising it brought divorce rates to all-time highs are you hearing me i'm not making things up i'm telling you when man starts tampering with things but god has a way god's intended that not only that man would be an initiator a leader but then that the children themselves a young girl she can look at that and know this is the kind of man that i need to marry the young man can look at that husband and say that's the kind of leader i want to be how he's leading this home the effect and the influence that comes forth in this home i tell you this is these are these are things that are big responsibilities the more and more than i stand i recognize more and more the responsibility nothing comes with autopilot nothing comes with autopilot god comes to guide and direct our lives look at let's look at this just for a few moments here here within this part within the scriptures here of how god would lay down his life in john 10 16 as the father knoweth me even so i know the father and i laid down my life for the sheep he's laid down his life what what drove him to this his love romans 5 8 but god commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us we weren't worthy of it we weren't oh they're doing everything that's what no this love is not a love based on worthiness this is the love of god first john 3 16 hereby perceive we notice these words perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren see it's an example when that light this is why paul would write in thessalonians beloved you need not any man teach you to love you are taught of god to love but what god has done in your life now it comes out in its express first john 4 9 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins look at this in first john 4 17 through 19 hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness that's confidence in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world and there is no fear in love you see it's it's not a fear has torment this is what it goes on to say but perfect love casts out fear fear is a horrible thing fear can try to come around and grip you i mean if outside in the world today fear is so thick but that's part of prophecy the bible said men's hearts would be failing for fear is that right and there's all sorts of what would a sphere come from uncertainty it comes from everything that's around but notice as he says there is no fear in love love is rooted in that fear fear or love is rooted there in god and now what does it bring about a confidence it's a confidence in him he that feareth is not made perfect in love this is dealing with the slavish fear this is not talking about a fear that if you get a doctor's report and all of a sudden fear comes up and oh my goodness what's that going to be so those are things that let me just say this to you that's a reminder you're still in this mortal body is that right it's a reminder even of things that goes around and you know here you are you know you're at work and oh my i was just around this person yesterday and what happened it's a reminder you're still in this mortal body but there is a god who is present with grace to cast out all fear we're not above but this is talking about a slavish where it's a fear of a dread of an uncertainty of a well i don't know but this the love of god brings a certainty in our life that though we don't understand everything else that's going on around us but we know in whom we have believed and that's what we're resting that's where our confidence within we don't have to know everything i don't have to figure this out faith is not god's told me everything that's going to happen and man i can rest in that faith is not sight faith is god said it and i believe it we love him because he first loved us think about what he did as he came down and he gave of his life as we were looking and he began to move upon our life and our life was washed with the water of the word what does his word do i'll tell you his word brings about a change in our life how many know what i'm talking about it continues it continues to eat away or to remove even thoughts that we have about our own self are you hearing me i feel insufficient here i feel his love it works to do what bring a cleansing remove those things within our life i believe we have access and as husbands as wives to an access to where the love of god because we all have faults we all have failures but there is an access we have within our lives that can actually bring about a strength in one another a confidence in one another a rest in one another i believe that with all my heart i know that to be the truth look at this in first in second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for the love of christ constrainteth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which lived should not live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again so we're not living to ourselves we lift for him it's our delight to live for him it's our delight to see that his program is advanced it's our delight to see him move and touch lives and touch heart and maybe it's something that we here we are we're just reaching out to someone being friendly being nice and here it is it's that life and has an effect upon them and here it's god moving to reach their soul we rejoice in that and say lord i'm thankful that i could be used for the advancement of your kingdom because it's him it's him that we want to see now brother branham he brings us down and i'm coming down here in the message token brother brown in the message token he preaches in jeffersonville there's many statements that brother branham will make regarding the home regarding the application of the token regarding this of how this life it comes down into the home and he says it like this he says uh you that's listening to this on tape you women men listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe me now it's time to quit fussing with one another and believe the message of the bible believe jesus christ and love and honor and respect one another man respect your wives you respect your homes bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one but for the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love one another love each other and believers should separate themselves from the world that's an effect of this of this lamb of this message you see it it has within it as we give ourselves to the word of god it it it changes it brings about the effectual working of the life of jesus christ let me just say this to you if this message only produces correct doctrine it's missing the mark and i hope you understand what i'm saying the bible never said that he would send elijah to turn our heads knowledge puffeth up but charity edified he came to deal with our hearts our hearts were in the wrong direction in the wrong thing notice what god came to get a hold of our hearts because when he gets a hold of our hearts then we'll see things differently [Applause] is that right he came to deal with the hearts it's it's the love of god that's what this message is it come to display the very heart of almighty god where man's doctrine where man denominations would not allow the love of god to have free course they shut it off from the people but god called you and i out and to express his heart to you and i and change us this is why we're not church members we are believers we're in love with the lord jesus christ hallelujah this is where this responsibility here moves down here let me just have just a few more moments i want to just get to this point in verse 28 so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself think of this how god in the beginning as we looked at it god in the beginning where he created maryland fema remember spirit and then he places adam here into the flesh body that he created and god lays him to sleep he opens up the side he takes out that part of a rib a part that was right over his heart and god begins to multiply sell on top of sale on top of sound he didn't reach over and get another piece of dirt he began to multiply from what was already present and then god goes in and in that surgery he separates masculine and feminine spirit and he places that feminine part which is the dainty part the left part he separates that from the burly manly part of the masculine and then god when he awakens adam adam looks and beholds and he says she's born of my bone flesh and my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man and god begins to go in and the rehearsal is of how that a man would leave father and mother and cleave to his own wife you see god even god was letting you know even that time there's going to come a fall even in those verses of scripture but to think of how that god how that he says they shall be one flesh how are they one flesh when you can see the female here and the male here it's because of the uniting of the spirits that unites together as one flesh with one purpose one objective one one motive everything is surrounded in a true oneness that's the same way it is with a real believer that's the real prayer that the lord jesus prayed for in john 17 that they might be one even as thou art in me that that same original life would dwell within us and here we would be united with him that our desire is to please him his desire his love his care his standard over our life his love his care i want to just leave you with these points the real point so what men to love their wives as their own bodies is that a husband should have the same care for the comfort of his wife as he has for himself the same care just like as a husband wants to be comfortable and i'm talking something in the natural but it should have the same care for his wife why because they're one so ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies he should regard her as one with himself to think of it in that way to think of it that way as he protects his own body i mean you know sometimes i get i get cold i come out of my office at home and i walk through another part of the house and because my office is a little warmer whoo i come out i put on a jacket i say i'm going to go outside and walk around for a little bit and get a little you know and it isn't that the house is freezing cold we don't keep it on you know freezer status or nothing like that but you understand what i'm saying it's time what do i do i don't i just go get a jacket i know what i have need of so how much more it's just like in the care how i would take of my own body when i'm cold or i get thirsty i go make myself a glass of you know lemon water or whatever you call a coffee go make another cup of coffee because i'm thirsty or i'm craving something i'm wanting something what's happening my body's telling me that right i mean there's nothing that comes out of my body hey samuel i'm cold if i start talking to myself like that i'll be committed right but there's things that i'm alerted to this is a need go get a jacket go get something to drink go get something to eat that's the kind of oneness between a husband and a wife to be that sensitive to catch those needs but something's not right well if there's something brewing don't wait for the lightning to strike are you with me if you know something if you see and it's not just about when lightning strikes but it's the care it's the taking care let's stand understand we'll just stop here when we're sick or we're suffering what do we try to do when we're sick or we're suffering i mean when you when you're sick hey man i'm i'm not feeling well i need to go take a nap i need to go to bed early i need to take something that helped me just to relax i uh you know so i'm not coughing all the time what we're trying to do we're trying to restore health that's the same way it is so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies there are sometimes where there's things that need to be restored sometimes things get a little weak or a little down hey all throughout this assembly think of it how many times have we been down or we've been weak how many times we've been discouraged but god knowing our time of need god will come and minister right to our need he might come in your prayer closet he might come in your time of devotion he might come right here right over the pulpit but god comes and he sees he takes account of our needs the bible says the eyes are roaming to and fro throughout the earth now you know god is not like us as husbands where we you know by the time you you know you get to brother gomez and brother chris carlos all these i don't call them older brothers but you know these these brothers have doctor's degrees they already know like brother dave he could know sister shirley what she's thinking he can know certain things and to get this right now because she's probably going to get cold or he already knows that but you see what's happened is there's things that's been learned over time it's how it is about our lives we never stop learning on how that we can please god we never come to that place say god help me help me as we learn to care and god ministers to restore our our strength ministers to us when we've we got a little cold he draws near to do what warm us a little bit but we got cold in our prayer life cold our walk with god but he'll draw near he knows they need a little warming so he'll come by his presence and he'll warm us not that we deserve it but he sees our need and god's got confidence is he ministering there to our need that that thankfulness within our heart it reaches right back out to him and say god thank you thank you for being mindful lord of my need thank you lord for ministering to me thank you for caring lord what does it do it raises within our hearts it doesn't cause a laxness it causes a greater fervor the love of god as it just it just further deepens in our life something that calls from us oh god i love you lord i love you more heavenly father lord this message tonight lord that this lord just here and there but i trust you lord to put it together lord we each and every one of us lord we want to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts for ministering your word to our hearts lord even over these past services and lord where we're able to get to we want to say thank you lord thank you lord for

to shape us to mold us oh god to guide us lord jesus we need you lord i'm confident lord that even lord the brothers different ones lord that as i said setting your older older brothers but i'm confident that there's not one of them lord but what they cry out to you and ask for you to continue to teach them lord lord jesus that's where lord god we stand is that you'll continue to show us continue to guide us lord that father is your word has expressed these things lord we believe your god that lord you are faithful to bring them about in our lives may our lives god be of an atmosphere and an error that is created around us that god it would push away sin but it would draw it would draw others to you lord grant it lord right here in this assembly lord right here among one another lord god grant it lord may the love of god just be so thick lord thick lord has honey it's just so sticking together lord god i think about brother branham when he's lord when he they had that rock box they would pour down that water that rock box had holes in it but there was only there was one thing that would hold when they poured that honey in there the honey would hold lord god we have the confidence lord in your life working o god in our midst lord it works it sticks lord god father forgive us lord of our shortcomings [Music] we want to tally up with your word papa help us lord we love
