[25:08] amen to receive from the lord tonight we
[25:11] we didn't come here to be seen
[25:13] if we did we really came here for the
[25:14] wrong purpose we came here tonight
[25:16] because we love the lord
[25:19] and we we desire to hear from him
[25:22] amen that's what we have need of tonight
[25:23] just just you know just a few words from
[25:25] him you hear brother braham say it over
[25:27] and over and over but it's so true
[25:29] brother brown would say just a few words
[25:30] from him will mean more
[25:33] than anything
[25:35] and that's exactly true just a few words
[25:37] and and that's that's all that matters
[25:39] and god knows the few words that you and
[25:42] i have need of you might have need of a
[25:44] certain few words i've got need of a
[25:45] certain few words but god knows exactly
[25:48] what we have need of tonight amen god's
[25:50] interested in just meeting and
[25:52] ministering to every need tonight amen
[25:55] so as we invite brother george i wonder
[25:57] we just couldn't sing that song only
[25:59] believe as our brother would come
[26:01] amen and just to take his liberty
[26:03] brother george enjoy having you brother
[26:06] amen amen
[26:10] amen
[26:12] and when we just couldn't stand and
[26:13] let's just sing this
[26:21] [Music]
[26:33] only
[26:35] me
[26:37] [Music]
[26:46] oh
[26:49] [Music]
[27:03] amen amen
[27:06] a real simple message only believe
[27:09] then say figure it out
[27:11] go ask a bunch of people just only
[27:13] believe
[27:14] something
[27:15] okay let's pick up our bible and turn to
[27:17] proverbs chapter 3.
[27:21] and
[27:22] it's good to be back
[27:24] it's good to
[27:26] see brother samuel and his family
[27:29] a lot of good memories
[27:32] and
[27:36] this won't be a shouting message but
[27:38] it'll be something that'll do you some
[27:40] good
[27:41] and if you don't say man that means
[27:43] you're listening so it doesn't scare me
[27:45] i'm never worried about the empty
[27:46] benches i'm not worried about the people
[27:47] that are here
[27:49] actually paying attention
[27:50] so proverbs chapter 3 and verse 1
[27:54] my son forget not my law but let thine
[27:57] heart keep my commandments
[28:00] for length of days and long life and
[28:01] peace shall they add to thee
[28:04] let not mercy
[28:06] and truth forsake thee bind them about
[28:08] thy neck write them upon the table of
[28:10] thine heart
[28:11] so shalt thou find favor and good
[28:13] understanding in the sight of god and
[28:15] man
[28:16] i trust trust in the lord with all thine
[28:19] heart and lean not to thy own
[28:21] understanding
[28:23] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[28:25] shall direct thy paths
[28:27] be not wise in thy own
[28:30] thine own eyes
[28:32] fear the lord
[28:33] and depart from evil
[28:36] let us pray father we thank you for this
[28:38] occasion we can be here together
[28:40] we thank you lord for life and health
[28:43] and all the things you've provided we're
[28:45] so thankful lord we're thankful we have
[28:47] a promise that we're leaving soon yes or
[28:50] just pray that you would bless these few
[28:51] words to your people
[28:53] let them sink deep
[28:55] and be something they could chew on for
[28:57] a long time help us now in jesus name
[28:59] amen
[29:00] you may be seated
[29:05] we do greet you in the name of the lord
[29:07] jesus and bring greetings from some
[29:09] other places i've been i'm not going to
[29:10] name wall but
[29:12] we do

[29:17] it's not next week it's not when you get
[29:19] ready when bills are paid the time is
[29:21] now
[29:22] and if we look over at the book of
[29:24] matthew real quickly
[29:26] matthew 24
[29:29] and
[29:31] you've probably read this many times but
[29:33] matthew 24 and verse 1
[29:37] and jesus went out and departed from the
[29:40] temple and his disciples came to him to
[29:43] show him the buildings of the temple
[29:45] in other words this was the biggest
[29:47] thing there was back at that time huge
[29:49] white
[29:50] beautiful building
[29:52] and they're you know regular jews and
[29:53] they're bragging on look lord look what
[29:54] we've done you know

[30:02] one
[30:04] there shall not be left here at one
[30:05] stone upon another that shall not be
[30:07] thrown down

[30:10] want a little pat on the back
[30:13] good job boys
[30:14] no he's given bad news
[30:17] and sure enough
[30:19] years later
[30:20] the romans came in
[30:22] and the stones are still sitting there
[30:24] where they landed you know
[30:25] the smallest stone weighs four tons
[30:30] and um we're going to go through verse
[30:32] five and as he sat upon the mount of
[30:34] olives so now they went from the temple
[30:36] over the mount of olives about 600 yards
[30:38] the disciples came unto him privately
[30:40] saying tell us when shall these things
[30:42] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[30:44] coming and of the end of the world
[30:47] and jesus answered and said unto them he
[30:50] doesn't give him just a straight answer
[30:52] he works around first thing out of his
[30:54] mouth
[30:55] take he that no man deceive you
[30:58] which means that there's going to be a
[30:59] lot of it coming along
[31:01] watch out you know
[31:03] for many shall come in my name saying
[31:05] i'm christ
[31:06] and shall deceive many
[31:09] okay go down to verse 23
[31:11] then if any man shall say unto thee no
[31:13] here's christ or there believe it not
[31:16] for thou shall rise
[31:18] um
[31:19] false christs
[31:21] and false prophets
[31:23] and they shall show great signs and
[31:25] wonders instruments that if it were
[31:27] possible
[31:29] they should deceive the very
[31:30] elect behold
[31:32] i've told you this
[31:34] told you before
[31:36] pay attention it's going to come to pass
[31:39] now there's a friend of brother rams
[31:41] called george lomza do you have along
[31:43] with the bible
[31:44] brother i need to get one it's uh it's a
[31:48] translated the scriptures translated
[31:50] straight from the from the aramaic
[31:52] and uh it's very similar just has a
[31:53] little more color
[31:55] he says in these last verses here of
[31:58] chapter 24 then if any man should say to
[32:01] you behold here's the christ or there do
[32:03] not believe it for there shall arise
[32:05] false christs
[32:07] and lying prophets that's interesting
[32:10] and they shall show signs and great
[32:12] wonders
[32:13] as to mislead if possible even the
[32:15] chosen ones
[32:17] behold i've told you in advance
[32:19] now i don't know if i wrote this level
[32:21] before this is a different one
[32:23] but this is the
[32:26] that still levels good
[32:28] you haven't poured up yet
[32:30] now this has got several purposes
[32:32] one is that you have something to focus
[32:34] on besides me
[32:36] but you remember to stay level in all
[32:38] your stuff
[32:39] and so we leave it here now if i see
[32:41] anybody nodding off
[32:44] get your attention
[32:46] it's okay they're cheap i can buy
[32:47] another one
[32:49] but um
[32:50] anyway
[32:52] um we're living in very dangerous times
[32:55] not just because they're out of your
[32:56] favorite stuff at the store
[32:58] but very dangerous time
[33:00] in this period of church history
[33:03] there's every kind of distraction every
[33:05] kind of deception
[33:06] you know you get out on the interstate
[33:08] they build all the stuff close so that
[33:09] you'll be tempted to stop in
[33:12] well you can only eat maybe two or three
[33:14] meals a day so you can't stop at all
[33:16] those places you've got to get where
[33:17] you're going you know
[33:18] and so
[33:19] um
[33:20] we want to know how to identify
[33:23] the dangers
[33:25] and to stay clear of the dangers you see
[33:27] we've got to stay balanced
[33:29] balanced in the scripture the promise
[33:31] that god gave the
[33:33] the uh
[33:35] you know giving scripture there through
[33:36] malachi he condensed it down to a few
[33:39] words but the bigger part of it is if
[33:41] you unpack it now he could have said now
[33:43] there's going to come a time and i'm
[33:45] going to send you know lamb of god and
[33:47] the church is going to start it's going
[33:49] to be 2 000 years but it's going to get
[33:51] off the rails but i'm going to send you
[33:52] elijah as you bring it back to the
[33:54] original and that's the time we got to
[33:56] live in okay
[33:58] and if we look at revelations 19
[34:00] yeah keep your hand keep your bible
[34:02] handy
[34:04] revelations 19 verse 7
[34:06] let us be glad and rejoice give honor to
[34:09] him
[34:10] for the marriage of the lamb is come and
[34:12] his wife hath made herself ready and to
[34:14] her was granted that she should be
[34:16] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[34:20] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[34:22] of the saints
[34:24] okay so that's in the near future
[34:26] that's coming up
[34:27] for those that are ready but in the
[34:29] meantime between now and then there
[34:31] shall arise false christs
[34:34] that's anointed ones
[34:36] very anointed
[34:37] that they can cause others to believe
[34:40] like a good salesman you know
[34:42] and lying prophets
[34:44] so everybody that's got a bible doesn't
[34:46] speak the oracles of god
[34:48] uh no
[34:49] no
[34:51] um
[34:52] and they the anointed ones and the lying
[34:54] prophets or preachers will show signs
[34:57] and great wonders explanations opinions
[34:59] and figure things out
[35:01] so as to mislead if possible the chosen
[35:03] ones
[35:05] so don't think it's strange when people
[35:06] just walk away
[35:08] they don't even tell you they just
[35:09] disappear sometimes
[35:10] so the time is now
[35:13] now in revelation 7 we have and forty
[35:15] four thousand and if you're in doubt
[35:17] what that means well then you go listen
[35:18] to the seventh seal it's real plain
[35:20] there
[35:20] uh of the tribes of israel
[35:23] there's not one more not one less it's
[35:25] an exact number let's see
[35:27] god is watching over his heritage very
[35:30] close he's in total control of all the
[35:33] details
[35:35] that's why you pour the color clothes
[35:37] you're wearing that's why you're here
[35:38] tonight you're not at the lake you're
[35:40] not at the theater you're here god is in
[35:42] control of these things and so amongst
[35:45] the jews there's great anticipation
[35:47] now not all of them there's you know
[35:50] just as many crazy people there's there
[35:52] is here
[35:53] but amongst the believing jews there's
[35:56] great anticipation
[35:58] any of them that you talk to oh the
[35:59] messiah is almost here
[36:01] and but first elijah they said now
[36:04] elijah will either be two steps in front
[36:06] of him or right next to him but first we
[36:08] will see elijah so they know that
[36:11] so god in his great wisdom and his
[36:13] foreknowledge has chosen
[36:15] and he's predestinated a number redeemed
[36:18] by the blood of the lamb now see with
[36:20] the jews we know exact number you know
[36:23] not one more and one less with the
[36:25] redeemed
[36:26] gentiles we don't know the exact number
[36:29] see
[36:30] but when you get there
[36:32] there will not be any extra chairs
[36:35] nobody's going to be standing around the
[36:36] wall wondering where the chair is it's
[36:38] all figured out
[36:40] and psalm 46 10 says
[36:45] be still
[36:47] i'm god i've got to figure it out don't
[36:48] need your opinions
[36:50] and so
[36:51] um
[36:53] the bride of jesus christ which is you
[36:56] well that's where we're going we're
[36:57] headed there
[36:58] so focusing closely
[37:00] uh we are a many membered body
[37:03] many languages many kinds of people
[37:06] called out of the confusion of laodicea
[37:08] for his namesake
[37:10] not
[37:11] to make the pastor rich not to have the
[37:13] fanciest church in town for his namesake
[37:16] you see
[37:17] so we're living in very dangerous times
[37:20] and anyone can read history they can see
[37:22] the
[37:23] history channel and everything
[37:25] and uh be thankful you live now
[37:27] it could have been a lot worse
[37:30] you know they didn't used to have air
[37:31] conditioning
[37:32] being used to have hot water
[37:34] hello
[37:36] we got it made
[37:37] yeah
[37:38] and so um
[37:40] we uh we're just glad that we live now
[37:43] instead of in the physical persecutions
[37:45] you know but the god of glory has us
[37:47] living here in these closing hours of
[37:49] church history and he has confidence in
[37:51] you that you have heard
[37:53] it's been revealed to you and you're
[37:55] going to stick with the program you see
[37:57] he's trusted you with the mysteries of
[37:58] the kingdom
[38:00] it's no small thing
[38:01] because if you have any relatives in the
[38:03] baptist church or the catholic church or
[38:04] wherever
[38:05] you can't share all the things that we
[38:07] know
[38:09] you can't get too far back past john 3
[38:11] 16 you know
[38:12] and
[38:13] but he's had confidence that you can
[38:15] live right here in the darkest part of
[38:16] laodicea and overcome the demons of this
[38:20] age
[38:21] because there will be overcomers
[38:25] and when we get to heaven and if they do
[38:27] hand out t-shirts it's not going to say
[38:29] survivors are laid to see it
[38:31] barely made it praise god no we're
[38:34] overcomers received
[38:36] so 2700 years ago the jewish prophet
[38:38] isaiah said
[38:40] he said here behold the darkness shall
[38:42] cover the earth this is future tense
[38:44] okay
[38:45] and gross darkness the people but the
[38:47] lord shall arise upon thee and his glory
[38:50] shall be seen upon thee speaking of a
[38:52] future time speaking of dark laodicea
[38:56] i know it's hard to you know get a
[38:58] handle on that because we all have a you
[39:00] know 500 cell phone we got you know 40
[39:02] thousand dollar cars and all no no no
[39:05] but it's dark late to see it okay
[39:08] we're in one of our darkest hours when
[39:11] matthew 24 24 that we just read is
[39:13] coming into sharp focus
[39:15] you see it's not with the pentecostals
[39:17] not with the mormons or anybody else
[39:19] it's people carrying this bible and
[39:21] these spoken word books that's who's the
[39:23] deceiving is going to come by okay
[39:26] so not out there but the same thing so
[39:29] how dark is it well i might have told
[39:30] you this before but
[39:32] you know if you live to get over 70 you
[39:34] get to repeat yourself so it's okay
[39:38] my kids you know they're bless their
[39:39] heart they're not kids they're adults so
[39:42] they'll catch me saying something or
[39:43] doing something bad
[39:45] i said okay well just wait you get this
[39:47] age see what you're like you know
[39:49] but how dark is it well in 1959 brother
[39:52] bran was preaching in the islands of the
[39:54] caribbean
[39:55] and he had some americans with him and
[39:58] one of them later said that he had four
[40:00] hours uh one day with brother branham
[40:02] and uh talking about a lot of things and
[40:05] he asked brother branham why do you um
[40:08] why do you say so much about 1977. well
[40:10] he's asking him the question 18 years
[40:12] before you know and of course been me
[40:15] i'd say well it's none of your business
[40:16] but that wasn't way deeper
[40:20] so brother brown said that he um
[40:24] he said as i was looking through the
[40:25] stream of time okay so he's seeing
[40:27] numbers yeah
[40:29] he said as i was seeing those numbers
[40:31] the stream of time
[40:32] it got so dark by 1977 i didn't see how
[40:36] anybody could live there
[40:38] well
[40:39] all the kids know that we're 44 years
[40:41] the other side now you know it's 44
[40:44] years
[40:45] uh more dark more corrupt more subtle
[40:48] and
[40:49] we're 44 years closer to
[40:51] catching away the bride the secret
[40:54] catching away we're not going to go out
[40:55] here in the blaze of glory oh wow there
[40:57] they go now we're going to disappear
[41:00] because this thing is so messed up
[41:02] they'll be glad when we're gone really
[41:04] yeah
[41:05] so they're going to say what happened to
[41:07] those strange people you know
[41:08] all that long hair
[41:10] oh they're gone yeah
[41:12] so
[41:13] uh you know they were following a
[41:14] prophet but as the redeemed and anointed
[41:17] bride of christ
[41:18] god has provided us with
[41:20] our love letter right here
[41:23] now all you guys that are over 50 years
[41:25] old remember when you actually wrote a
[41:26] letter
[41:27] you knew how to spell
[41:28] you could read your writing remember
[41:30] those days
[41:34] yeah you don't have to be 50. but
[41:36] but it wasn't immediate it wasn't
[41:38] immediate you have to write it line the
[41:40] envelope find the stamp and she might
[41:42] get it in a week or two
[41:44] and then it comes the answer i already
[41:45] forgot what you wrote but um we have our
[41:48] love letter right here it's up to date
[41:50] and god was gracious enough to send us a
[41:52] prophet to highlight the things that are
[41:53] for our time
[41:54] you know and um and we can even read
[41:57] between the lines yeah when you're
[41:58] reading your bible every day remember
[42:00] the four steps read your bible read your
[42:03] church age book listen to the prophet
[42:05] and pray
[42:07] guaranteed success
[42:08] so we read between the lines and another
[42:11] thing about this love letter
[42:14] you don't put anything on top of your
[42:15] bible
[42:17] it's on tape oh listen he says not even
[42:19] my books hello
[42:21] the few books there were back then so
[42:23] this is very important
[42:26] he's provided with a prophetic ministry
[42:28] with uh god sent gift of unquestionable
[42:31] accuracy you see
[42:33] there was no wondering no guessing i
[42:34] wonder if this is going to work tonight
[42:36] no no he knew exactly what he was doing
[42:38] right because he was plugged in you see
[42:40] and so
[42:42] only believe and the message is totally
[42:44] scriptural yes it's all these foolish
[42:46] questions that come out on the internet
[42:47] let's throw them away
[42:49] because you will get messed up
[42:50] see amen and he's provided him with all
[42:53] the instructions that we need
[42:55] to walk from here
[42:56] to the door of the resurrection amen
[42:59] he's preparing us for that time you see
[43:02] so there's some sitting here that will
[43:03] not see death it's that close it's not a
[43:06] hundred years away it's close
[43:08] and uh but he says one of these days
[43:10] there will be a sweep come over here
[43:11] like a breeze
[43:12] you know
[43:13] and then what
[43:15] somebody'll be knocking at the door
[43:17] and there's your dad yeah there's the
[43:19] ones i've been looking for you know it's
[43:21] real
[43:22] and uh and then you'll know that the
[43:24] the resurrection is in full effect
[43:27] the day of the lord
[43:29] and uh that's when the minister can
[43:30] retire
[43:32] so we don't have a retirement plan you
[43:33] got to keep going right yeah
[43:36] that's what i'm doing
[43:37] so we're um we're not going to retire
[43:41] that'll be the first day of the
[43:42] resurrection
[43:43] but there will be people coming to this
[43:45] church the day after the resurrection
[43:48] and pain playing church and beating
[43:49] drums and they think things are going on
[43:53] but some of us are going to leave you
[43:54] see
[43:55] so the redeemed of the lord are focused
[43:58] on that day that's where our focus is
[44:00] the day of our full redemption
[44:03] and we're focused on keeping in step
[44:05] with god's word and maintaining in
[44:08] balance
[44:10] i know you get tired of hearing that
[44:12] but see we got these nice cars out here
[44:14] they service very well especially in
[44:16] cold weather
[44:17] but that every wheel has a little piece
[44:19] of
[44:20] lead on it what about a dollar's worth
[44:21] or less
[44:22] if you go taking that off you're going
[44:24] to get it unbalanced right so you got to
[44:27] stay in balance okay
[44:29] now in acts 3 21 it talks about the
[44:32] restoration of all things
[44:35] including the restoration of the bride
[44:37] you see restored to her original
[44:39] condition as we were in the mind of god
[44:42] before he formed the planets
[44:44] now some people have time and money to
[44:46] restore an old car
[44:48] it looks nice but there's lots of money
[44:50] involved in that so to restore means
[44:52] that you were at some place and you're
[44:54] brought back to that and that's what
[44:56] we're into now you see
[44:58] so
[44:59] uh that's why we press forward with
[45:01] successful missionary work that's
[45:03] bearing fruit we don't pour money into
[45:05] things that don't work you see
[45:06] individuals converted to the gospel of
[45:08] jesus christ people that i could never
[45:11] get out there and visit but we have we
[45:13] have memory stick with messages on it
[45:15] it's on the radios on different things
[45:17] and so when they hear the message god
[45:19] calls them for repentance and baptism
[45:22] you see
[45:23] but our bible tells us
[45:25] that
[45:26] that special day
[45:28] will be preceded by a falling away from
[45:30] the faith an apostasy a rebellion it's
[45:34] in the bible okay we'll get to it so any
[45:36] departure any apostasy or rebellion
[45:40] always begins from the inside
[45:43] see when when when apple goes bad it
[45:46] doesn't start from the outside starts
[45:47] from the inside you know
[45:50] and so uh it starts with inside going
[45:52] out and takes as many as it can with
[45:55] them
[45:56] so that kind of
[45:57] activity
[45:59] doesn't begin way out there no but from
[46:01] within it's subtle it's engaging and
[46:04] it's very dangerous
[46:06] and none of us put together even are
[46:08] smart enough to combat it just leave it
[46:09] alone because god is not the author of
[46:12] confusion
[46:13] okay so don't ever think that you are a
[46:15] match for the devil because you're not
[46:17] uh just because you've read and you've
[46:20] memorized a few verses and so forth that
[46:22] somehow you can argue with the devil and
[46:24] his angels and his agents and a win with
[46:27] your logic
[46:29] no it doesn't work
[46:31] so they stay up day and night with a
[46:33] fine-toothed comb looking for the flaws
[46:37] what what day was that brother brown
[46:38] actually born what happened he's gone um
[46:42] and so they don't feed on the nutritious
[46:46] manna that we appreciate
[46:48] so jesus had to put up with the same
[46:50] kind of people 2 000 years ago
[46:52] matthew 22
[46:55] 15
[46:57] it says then went the pharisees now
[46:59] these are religious people they knew
[47:01] moses message perfectly without an ipad
[47:06] they didn't have movable press anything
[47:08] they had to copy word by word you know
[47:11] and a lot of people couldn't read anyway
[47:13] so here's these pharisees they had the
[47:16] attitude to prove it and says and they
[47:18] took counsel how they might entangle him
[47:20] with his talk in other words trap him
[47:22] with a question i've been around people
[47:24] like that so we still have pharisees
[47:27] today okay
[47:28] um
[47:29] and like those back there today we have
[47:32] people that they know the letter very
[47:34] well
[47:35] but zero revelation
[47:37] what good is it to memorize half the
[47:39] bible you've got no revelation
[47:41] that's right you know you buy a new
[47:43] pickup doesn't have no tires on it well
[47:44] you're not going anyplace you know
[47:46] so we still have the pharisees today
[47:49] and um if the message is not real to you
[47:52] i mean really real and in your soul then
[47:55] one day you will walk away that's right
[47:58] you enjoyed this fellowship
[48:00] and the scripture says if you've been
[48:01] here and you've enjoyed the preaching
[48:03] and you've enjoyed the music and you've
[48:04] enjoyed the communion and everything
[48:06] else and you walk away it's a one-way
[48:08] trip
[48:09] as much as you cry and scream there's no
[48:11] way back sorry
[48:13] so
[48:14] but for you to turn your back on the
[48:16] truth
[48:17] you have to misunderstand and reject the
[48:20] bible promises right okay there's the
[48:22] process
[48:24] two you must reject supernatural
[48:26] vindication
[48:28] and three according to hebrews 6 4
[48:30] the person is left with zero chances of
[48:33] returning
[48:34] god is the judge not me not brother
[48:36] samuel no
[48:38] we are only fruit inspectors so when we
[48:40] see bad fruit well then we give that
[48:42] lamb a little extra attention but when
[48:44] he keeps jumping over the fence well
[48:47] see ya we got better things to do
[48:49] there's a limit you know
[48:51] so over in john chapter 8 we have the
[48:53] scene where jesus is in early morning
[48:56] church before breakfast okay
[48:58] he's sitting teaching a group of people
[49:00] now first of all you've got to realize
[49:02] that the church back then wasn't like
[49:03] this
[49:04] the church back then was a was a small
[49:07] building by comparison but only the
[49:08] priest came in offered the sacrifice and
[49:10] everything the people were out there in
[49:11] the courtyard
[49:12] so he's over there in the corner
[49:14] teaching some people one day and a very
[49:17] um
[49:18] arrogant group of pharisees all men they
[49:21] showed up with this woman
[49:23] and they were holding her wrist really
[49:24] hard
[49:25] and she wasn't dressed right she wasn't
[49:27] her hair wasn't cold and they interrupt
[49:30] him okay
[49:31] and they put her right in the middle of
[49:33] the or get his attention and they posed
[49:35] a very loaded question
[49:38] and um
[49:40] uh they probably each had a few stones
[49:42] in their pocket because hey we're going
[49:43] to get permission here that we're going
[49:45] to beat the tardive you know
[49:47] yeah
[49:47] and um so they interrupt him
[49:50] and so they um
[49:52] they had they were very legal and they
[49:54] were very ready to judge
[49:56] and uh because the chair the pharisees
[49:58] job was to make jesus look bad
[50:00] somehow we're gonna trip him with his
[50:02] words because you know he says he's
[50:05] he knows and he says he's god but we
[50:07] know the letter of the law we know
[50:09] exactly what moses said
[50:10] and even until today they have church
[50:12] every saturday around the world and they
[50:14] read a portion of their spoken word a
[50:16] portion of moses
[50:17] it's clear until the day see
[50:19] and so um
[50:23] they start telling him how bad she is
[50:25] and everything he acts like he doesn't
[50:26] hear he goes down he starts writing in
[50:28] the sand
[50:29] and he heard everything he said
[50:31] so he comes back up
[50:33] and um you know they
[50:36] they wanted some help in fulfilling the
[50:37] law the literal words of their prophet
[50:40] and when they finished their accusations
[50:43] he raised up
[50:44] he heard it all
[50:45] he looked around i'll tell you what guys
[50:47] the one that is without sin
[50:50] the one of you that never you know
[50:53] stole anything never looked at a woman
[50:55] wrong nothing throw the first rock go
[50:57] ahead
[50:58] see they thought he was down there
[50:59] looking for a rock to help him he was
[51:00] just riding in the sand
[51:02] but now he's up here go ahead you know
[51:05] so then he went back and erased it but
[51:06] with those words they all began to slip
[51:09] away yeah verse 9 there in chapter 8 of
[51:11] john
[51:12] and by discernment he was able to see
[51:14] her whole life
[51:16] you know they brought her here to get
[51:18] stoned
[51:19] and
[51:20] this is her day of salvation she didn't
[51:22] expect this you know and so they
[51:25] one by one they start
[51:27] hot potato we don't want nothing to do
[51:28] with this
[51:29] step away
[51:30] and um the fact is she had
[51:32] representation in heaven
[51:34] and she had been on this detour we don't
[51:36] we'll find out her name we'll find out
[51:38] the whole story one of these days but
[51:40] she met the master you see she
[51:43] came and received life from the life
[51:45] giver
[51:47] and it turned her into a real lady
[51:48] overnight right then not not three weeks
[51:51] you know
[51:52] her heart was filled with joy she went
[51:53] away with hope to live a new life so
[51:56] that was her encounter with the master
[51:58] her chains fell off she was free
[52:01] so it's a nice story but have you had
[52:04] your encounter with the master or are
[52:06] you just you know brother brown said
[52:07] brother abraham said anybody can do that
[52:11] any ten-year-old can learn to you know
[52:13] memorize but it's got to be something
[52:15] living
[52:16] see
[52:16] right and so um or is it only in your
[52:19] head or because your mom told you
[52:22] see we still have a lot of pharisees
[52:23] today yeah we call them legalists
[52:27] so they had their prophet's message
[52:29] their their prophet's message they had
[52:30] it memorized perfectly but they were out
[52:32] of balance
[52:33] because you can have all the letter oh
[52:36] just perfectly you know
[52:38] with no spirit
[52:39] or you have all kinds of spirit and beat
[52:41] and beat and not know what he said but
[52:43] jesus told the woman there in john
[52:45] chapter 4
[52:46] uh god is looking for those that will
[52:48] worship god in spirit and in truth
[52:50] balanced
[52:52] see
[52:53] so
[52:54] these people they knew their prophet's
[52:56] message perfectly but they're out of
[52:57] balance
[52:58] so all word no spirit no revelation
[53:01] and um
[53:02] it's a word that they had memorized by
[53:04] constant repetition
[53:06] so we must worship god in spirit and in
[53:08] truth
[53:09] because your life
[53:11] you know here everybody looks nice
[53:13] some of them are smiling but
[53:15] you know
[53:16] um
[53:17] your life reflects what's on the inside
[53:20] how no matter how much you memorize i
[53:22] know people have gone through the ibeka
[53:24] system boy they memorize those verses
[53:25] every day and you see them a year later
[53:27] they don't know nothing
[53:28] because there's just memorization it's
[53:30] got to be real see
[53:31] um
[53:33] first timothy four in the lamb's bible
[53:35] says misleading spirits okay let's look
[53:37] at this in our bible first timothy
[53:40] chapter four
[53:42] um
[53:43] i already warned you that this one
[53:45] wasn't going to be a
[53:46] glory hallelujah but at least you'll
[53:48] know what it says
[53:50] let's see here first timothy chapter 4
[53:52] verses 1 and 2.
[53:54] now the spirit speaks expressly that in
[53:56] the latter times some
[53:58] okay some shall depart from the faith
[54:01] it's going to happen
[54:02] giving heed to what seducing spirits and
[54:05] doctrines of devils speaking lies in
[54:08] hypocrisy in other words you can't even
[54:09] lie right you know
[54:12] speaking lies in hypocrisy
[54:14] having their conscience seared with a
[54:16] hot iron
[54:18] now we don't use any hot irons today but
[54:20] i'm sure you've had a nylon rope you
[54:23] know when you cut it and kind of starts
[54:24] to frazzle you light a match to it it
[54:26] kind of binds up well that's what that
[54:28] means seared
[54:30] okay
[54:31] the llamas the bible says misleading
[54:33] spirits and doctrines of devils
[54:36] scofield says seducing spirits it's very
[54:38] very serious
[54:40] you better know what you're
[54:41] where you stand and having done all
[54:44] stand firm because the winds are going
[54:45] to blow like it did out there today it's
[54:47] going to blow some away you see
[54:49] so we do not engage in conversation with
[54:51] doubters negative people that was the
[54:53] fatal mistake that eve made
[54:56] everything was fine she you know
[54:58] she had no needs everything was provided
[55:01] but then mr slick come by
[55:03] and start talking to her
[55:05] and she listened
[55:06] and she might have responded we don't
[55:08] know but she might have said really wow
[55:11] how long you been here anyway you know
[55:13] and so she listened she got involved
[55:15] she tried to argue
[55:17] and we're still paying the price today
[55:20] spirits don't die
[55:23] jesus said in john 6 53 verily verily i
[55:25] say unto you
[55:26] if you do not eat the flesh of the son
[55:28] of man and drink his blood you have no
[55:30] life in you who so eateth my flesh and
[55:32] drinks my blood has eternal life and i
[55:34] will raise him up the last day so
[55:36] there's another promise
[55:38] john 6 53 the disciples were a little
[55:40] bit confused
[55:42] they were you know they were concerned
[55:44] you know but they stood steady
[55:46] see they didn't get in his face with
[55:48] stupid arguments what in the world what
[55:50] are you doing
[55:51] peter wanted to but you know sometimes
[55:52] he did
[55:54] you know stay quiet
[55:55] they did not understand what he said
[55:58] they were ordained to eternal life
[56:00] chosen by the lamb of god and i've often
[56:02] thought and you look at those guys lord
[56:04] is this the best you could find
[56:07] but they look at us well yeah it's okay
[56:11] and
[56:12] so they were chosen by him they stood
[56:14] steady
[56:15] believing that he knew what he was
[56:16] talking about okay they believed the
[56:19] supernatural
[56:21] they had seen unquestionable indication
[56:24] uh they believed the supernatural and
[56:26] brother branham was sent to us with a
[56:27] very simple message just listen he goes
[56:30] through these stories it's right there
[56:31] in the bible and he's not speaking to
[56:33] sinners he's speaking to sunday school
[56:34] people they they know their bible he
[56:36] could send up four thousand people well
[56:38] now i don't know the bible too much but
[56:40] i know the author
[56:42] how about that
[56:43] but we need to know the word also we
[56:45] need to know what it says you see
[56:47] and so
[56:49] um
[56:50] in hebrews 13 7 8 you know totally
[56:52] vindicated
[56:54] they don't stop to question or doubt
[56:57] a believer just believes it at the
[56:59] wedding of cana
[57:01] very interesting
[57:02] he was invited to this wedding
[57:04] and so it says right in the scripture
[57:06] that it was on the third day well
[57:08] sunday's the first day
[57:10] and
[57:11] monday is the second day
[57:13] and tuesday is the third day
[57:16] and so
[57:17] why is that because over in the book of
[57:19] genesis
[57:20] when the creation each day that's good
[57:23] but on the third day he said that's good
[57:25] twice
[57:26] so they chose that tuesday to be be
[57:28] married
[57:30] and to this day you know so they're
[57:32] there
[57:33] and he they ran out of wine
[57:37] they drank wine
[57:38] and mary got all nervous and uh
[57:42] what should we do whatever he says you
[57:44] do it
[57:45] they had these big old water pots there
[57:47] and fill them with water okay
[57:50] now try it well they're expecting water
[57:52] it was nice wine well
[57:55] he turned
[57:56] the water into wine
[57:58] okay and that's why they have wedding on
[58:00] tuesdays and so forth but you see at the
[58:03] branham tabernacle
[58:06] they have communion every uh
[58:08] first sunday night of the month and so
[58:10] one sunday night um
[58:13] there's the people there well one of the
[58:14] members at the church
[58:16] had a friend a neighbor that was church
[58:18] of christ his name was mr hill so mr
[58:21] hill
[58:22] you know uh was invited he always had an
[58:25] excuse but on this sunday he said fine
[58:27] i'll go with you so here he comes and
[58:30] see there's closed communion and there's
[58:31] open communion closed communion where
[58:33] it's just us and everybody stays away
[58:35] open communion if you say you're a
[58:37] christian you receive the blood of jesus
[58:38] christ fine you can have the communion
[58:39] with us you don't belong to the church
[58:42] so they have open communion and so
[58:44] here's mr hill and the member and all
[58:46] these other people and about then
[58:48] brother neville says to brother branham
[58:50] we're out of wine
[58:52] that's embarrassing those people were
[58:54] out of wine so brother bran says oh
[58:56] we'll just pray
[58:57] well this mr hill he thought this would
[58:59] be interesting so he keeps one eye open
[59:02] you know i mean the bible does say watch
[59:03] and pray
[59:05] and so
[59:06] his testimony until the day he died was
[59:09] that as brother branham prayed those
[59:10] little cups filled with wine
[59:12] from nothing
[59:15] see
[59:16] so the day of redemption is very very
[59:19] near we've had all these uh wonderful
[59:21] preaching we have all these miracles and
[59:23] everything
[59:24] how far away it's real close
[59:27] when when we the redeemed do our part
[59:30] and find the last eagle
[59:32] that's what we're trying to do that's
[59:34] why i travel to encourage people okay
[59:36] let's let's each one in our little
[59:38] circle
[59:39] be
[59:39] a shining light because god's program is
[59:42] right on schedule okay
[59:44] and uh spreading the gospel and being a
[59:47] beacon of hope isn't passing out tracks
[59:50] at them all no it's it's living a life
[59:52] you see so that people can see
[59:54] okay
[59:55] and um
[59:56] we want to get serious and say what he
[59:59] said well let's have a contest
[1:00:02] i mean it's in there you know
[1:00:04] brother abraham says in the new ministry
[1:00:06] on a sunday 1959 god knew that we would
[1:00:09] be standing here
[1:00:10] 10 million years before the world was
[1:00:12] ever founded now you've probably seen on
[1:00:15] your phone or a tablet or something they
[1:00:17] have the the sun and the
[1:00:19] stars and all these things all you know
[1:00:21] you can see the big picture
[1:00:23] well there was a time when that wasn't
[1:00:24] there
[1:00:25] now we put all of our effort to you know
[1:00:27] farm our two acres and do all the things
[1:00:30] but have you ever thought what keeps us
[1:00:32] together
[1:00:33] it's just hanging out here in space but
[1:00:35] why doesn't it fall
[1:00:37] and the moon comes out every 28 days and
[1:00:39] all these things happen perfect order
[1:00:41] you see
[1:00:42] so god knew that we'd be standing here
[1:00:43] 10 million years before the world was
[1:00:45] ever founded did you know that um
[1:00:48] let's say the infinite sea of god knew
[1:00:51] every fly every gnat
[1:00:53] every time they would bat their eyes and
[1:00:54] how much towel that would produce
[1:00:56] before the world was ever formed god
[1:00:58] knew all that
[1:00:59] every mosquito every cockroach all that
[1:01:02] you say well if he knows it
[1:01:05] then why are you preaching
[1:01:07] he says that's part of god's program
[1:01:09] preaching is his program
[1:01:11] okay so we established that when he
[1:01:13] looked upon the apostles he looked up on
[1:01:15] the harvest and he said the harvest is
[1:01:17] ripe and the laborers are few you all
[1:01:20] need to pray to the lord of the harvest
[1:01:21] he will send laborers into his harvest
[1:01:24] okay that's what he said
[1:01:26] and he says here well why would he
[1:01:28] why would he why would they have to pray
[1:01:30] to the lord of the harvest to send
[1:01:31] laborers into the harvest if the lord of
[1:01:33] the harvest was standing there knowing
[1:01:35] how it would be
[1:01:37] was that done
[1:01:37] thought of a question like that
[1:01:40] he says listen here god has so arranged
[1:01:42] that his program cannot move without you
[1:01:44] and me and as long as we're not doing
[1:01:47] what god leads us to do we're paralyzing
[1:01:49] his program
[1:01:50] but when the church
[1:01:52] moves by the anointing of the holy ghost
[1:01:54] then we're in god's will doing this
[1:01:56] program
[1:01:58] very simple you know
[1:02:00] preaching is his program his program not
[1:02:02] mine my brother samuel god's program see
[1:02:07] so we would do well to forget our little
[1:02:09] program
[1:02:10] and get in line and in step with his
[1:02:12] divine program works a lot smoother
[1:02:15] because the fourth elijah was sent to
[1:02:16] this generation according to god's
[1:02:18] divine plan to turn our hearts back to
[1:02:21] the original where we come from
[1:02:24] and so this glorious message that we
[1:02:26] have brother brahm said brother braham
[1:02:28] said
[1:02:29] wonderful but it's only the vehicle to
[1:02:31] bring us back to the open book
[1:02:33] see
[1:02:35] so the first church age messenger paul
[1:02:37] said over here in first corinthians for
[1:02:39] we are laborers together with god
[1:02:42] you are you are god's husbandry you are
[1:02:44] god's building according to the grace of
[1:02:46] god which is given to me as a wise
[1:02:48] master builder
[1:02:49] i have laid the foundation
[1:02:51] and another builds thereon but let every
[1:02:53] man take heed how he builds thereon
[1:02:57] for other foundation can no man lay than
[1:03:00] that which is already laid which is
[1:03:01] christ jesus
[1:03:03] now you've seen some of the houses and i
[1:03:06] see a lot of things in the neighborhood
[1:03:07] when i travel but
[1:03:09] it's the house of jackville you know it
[1:03:11] probably was a small house at one time
[1:03:13] and then they you know they got some
[1:03:14] money and they had it on more they added
[1:03:16] them back there and put a second story
[1:03:18] well be careful how you build this thing
[1:03:20] might crash one day you know
[1:03:22] so like paul says here he says we're
[1:03:24] labors together you are god's husbandry
[1:03:26] so who are these laborers together in
[1:03:28] the first sentence good question if we
[1:03:30] look real close at our bible 41 pages
[1:03:32] later in ephesians 4 11 through 16 it's
[1:03:35] all one sentence
[1:03:37] watch closely how paul structures his
[1:03:39] words it's one sentence and it's all
[1:03:42] done in love so you can read it later
[1:03:44] ephesians
[1:03:46] chapter 4 verses 11 through 16.
[1:03:49] but you see
[1:03:50] brother brahman says i believe there's a
[1:03:52] church coming into that perfection that
[1:03:54] ministry of perfection where the offices
[1:03:57] were apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:03:59] evangelists for the
[1:04:01] perfecting of the church those pastors
[1:04:03] and teachers and so forth will be so
[1:04:06] with the word until the whole thing will
[1:04:09] work right up to the coming of the lord
[1:04:11] and i believe we're nearing that time
[1:04:13] now i believe it is so
[1:04:15] yeah uh about 60 years ago see it's
[1:04:18] nothing god's time
[1:04:20] we're living now we
[1:04:22] already forgot what we had for lunch
[1:04:24] yesterday you know that's gone and we
[1:04:26] don't know what's going to happen
[1:04:26] tomorrow but we live now so today we're
[1:04:29] getting ready
[1:04:30] so these five ministries of ephesians 4
[1:04:32] they work in harmony okay and they're in
[1:04:35] balance nobody's fighting the other no
[1:04:37] it works in harmony just like these
[1:04:40] musicians now they do a good job
[1:04:42] and each one want to be you know in
[1:04:44] their place but if she's playing in a
[1:04:46] minor and he's playing an f sharp it's
[1:04:48] not going to work too good
[1:04:50] it's got to be
[1:04:51] together let's see
[1:04:53] and um
[1:04:54] so
[1:04:55] it's under one anointing
[1:04:57] anointing the word and spirit of god now
[1:05:00] all others out there whoever they are
[1:05:02] that are out of tune that seem to be out
[1:05:04] of balance they're attracting people to
[1:05:06] themselves because they are the most
[1:05:08] important person on the block you know
[1:05:10] and that's happening right here in 2022
[1:05:14] a lot of those people don't qualify for
[1:05:15] this verse you see but god is not
[1:05:18] responsible for their foolishness you
[1:05:20] see their tantrums and their
[1:05:22] explanations
[1:05:23] but individuals must appear on the scene
[1:05:26] to produce the fulfillment of each part
[1:05:28] of god's eternal word
[1:05:30] spoken by his prophets
[1:05:32] we
[1:05:34] spend a lot of time on the positive
[1:05:35] promises and building faith but matthew
[1:05:38] 24 24 we'll have a fulfillment
[1:05:40] somebody's going to do that you know
[1:05:44] and but some people say well you know
[1:05:45] the bible's so ancient and even the pope
[1:05:47] of rome that's the bible forget it we
[1:05:49] need a new bible
[1:05:51] yeah you're going to write at 86 years
[1:05:53] old i don't think so
[1:05:54] no
[1:05:56] it's antiquated
[1:05:58] we're smarter we live you know up on
[1:06:00] this time frame that's correct but
[1:06:03] we are smarter we're better informed but
[1:06:05] we're out of balance with god's program
[1:06:07] we've got to get back to scripture
[1:06:10] even martin luther said christ alone yes
[1:06:12] it's got to be scripture or forget it
[1:06:15] you see
[1:06:16] even brother branham says over 200 times
[1:06:18] back to the word well it might be
[1:06:19] important
[1:06:21] well
[1:06:23] in 1964 brother brown said if this all
[1:06:25] continues the way it is going right now
[1:06:28] in 50 years it'll be total insanity
[1:06:30] and that would have been 2014
[1:06:32] and some of you guys weren't even born
[1:06:34] back then right
[1:06:36] barely
[1:06:37] and so
[1:06:38] we're in that time frame total insanity
[1:06:42] i mean i got a nice run but i don't turn
[1:06:43] on tv because
[1:06:44] full of garbage you know
[1:06:46] and um
[1:06:48] so yeah we're in that cycle right now
[1:06:50] and that is why we see the horrible
[1:06:52] things happening around the world
[1:06:54] and it's also because we see the
[1:06:56] spiritually insane
[1:06:58] because we live in a pleasure mad
[1:07:00] laodicea
[1:07:02] and we must really concentrate on
[1:07:04] getting away from this sense-bound
[1:07:06] existence
[1:07:08] yeah that's a hyphenated word
[1:07:09] sense-bound existence brother brown
[1:07:11] speaks a lot about that too
[1:07:13] so just look at these figures now this
[1:07:15] is a few years ago in the last 10 years
[1:07:17] in a three year period
[1:07:19] we had 138 students have been shot dead
[1:07:22] that makes the news
[1:07:24] in the same time period
[1:07:26] 6 million babies were murdered by
[1:07:28] legalized abortion
[1:07:31] it's nothing but murder
[1:07:32] and now i just saw on the phone today
[1:07:34] that they've they've approved where you
[1:07:36] get your your abortion pills free in the
[1:07:37] mail no problem
[1:07:39] from now on
[1:07:41] it's it's insane that's just in our
[1:07:43] country who knows about the rest of the
[1:07:44] world
[1:07:46] so we don't have any business telling
[1:07:47] those other countries how they should
[1:07:49] run their country and human rights and
[1:07:51] all this business
[1:07:52] were we to
[1:07:53] shake the stick out of them you know
[1:07:56] so our messenger was brave and he
[1:07:58] entertained questions from the audience
[1:08:00] and in one question uh questions and
[1:08:03] answers on the seals he said the
[1:08:05] question was will the bride have will
[1:08:07] the bride of christ have a ministry
[1:08:08] before the rapture that's way back in
[1:08:10] 63.
[1:08:12] sure he says that's what's going on
[1:08:13] right now the bride of christ certainly
[1:08:15] it is the message of the hour the bride
[1:08:17] of christ sure she consists of me and
[1:08:20] samuel no
[1:08:22] consists of but stay here apostles
[1:08:26] prophets teachers evangelist pastors
[1:08:29] that's the bride of christ sure she's
[1:08:31] got a ministry great ministry it's the
[1:08:32] ministry of the hour and then he added
[1:08:34] this little piece it'll be so humble
[1:08:37] see we're not going to go out in big
[1:08:38] lights it'll be so humble but we know
[1:08:41] where we stand we're sure that we're in
[1:08:43] the word you see
[1:08:45] so there's only two forces directing all
[1:08:47] the activity on the planet tonight okay
[1:08:50] every one of you is listening or
[1:08:51] following a spirit
[1:08:54] or you know in every activity every
[1:08:56] waking moment either you're following
[1:08:58] god or you're following satan
[1:09:03] so we're free human beings
[1:09:05] humans make choices
[1:09:07] we regret some of the choices
[1:09:09] and
[1:09:11] this is a serious thing it's not a game
[1:09:13] and balance is not an option
[1:09:16] the message
[1:09:18] sirs we would see jesus you follow the
[1:09:20] scripture and see if the spirit follows
[1:09:22] the scripture any spirit that does not
[1:09:24] follow the scripture is a wrong spirit
[1:09:28] well
[1:09:30] just put that on the front of the church
[1:09:32] i mean that's that's his gospel
[1:09:35] any spirit that does not follow the
[1:09:36] scripture is a wrong spirit
[1:09:38] see
[1:09:40] that's right if it goes beyond the bible
[1:09:42] it's wrong spirit if it doesn't get to
[1:09:44] it it's a wrong spirit
[1:09:45] if the devil can't keep you from seeing
[1:09:47] the truth he'll push you overboard
[1:09:50] that's his business he'll he will go off
[1:09:52] on some fantastic or he'll keep you from
[1:09:55] seeing it all together but to stay right
[1:09:57] straight on calvary it always comes
[1:09:59] right back to the word every time see
[1:10:02] the bubble is always in the middle when
[1:10:04] it's when it's balanced
[1:10:06] would want to fall
[1:10:08] so the scripture says in james chapter 2
[1:10:11] that demons believe and tremble
[1:10:14] they know what the truth is you know but
[1:10:16] unfortunately we have people today
[1:10:18] that they they carry the bible boy they
[1:10:21] got their tablet or spoken word books
[1:10:23] you know they claim to believe and
[1:10:26] because they believe something and
[1:10:27] they're so calloused by sin and unbelief
[1:10:29] of ledocia that they don't know what the
[1:10:32] bible says and they never cry and they
[1:10:35] never tremble
[1:10:36] the devil's got them beat you know
[1:10:38] so god has a provided way amen
[1:10:42] and he says here in this other tape
[1:10:44] friends i've always tried to keep a
[1:10:46] balance of the road
[1:10:48] you get way off on formalism just as
[1:10:50] formal and ritualistic as it can be
[1:10:53] people grab that a lot and then if you
[1:10:54] don't watch get plumb over on the other
[1:10:56] side be just as fanatical as you can be
[1:10:59] but there's a middle of the road there's
[1:11:02] a true sound same gospel is preached and
[1:11:05] god moves there vindicating the truth
[1:11:07] straight as the gate narrows the way and
[1:11:10] few there be that find it that's right
[1:11:12] so it's not going to be crowds it's
[1:11:13] going to be
[1:11:14] individuals
[1:11:15] so look at these things here
[1:11:17] we have redeemed individuals who are
[1:11:19] waiting for the coming of the lord we
[1:11:20] believe all of us here okay
[1:11:23] and we're saved by grace believing and
[1:11:25] depending on the atonement of calvary
[1:11:28] that's not just billy graham's message
[1:11:29] don't get that crazy idea we all have to
[1:11:32] come to the foot of the cross
[1:11:33] that's where we start
[1:11:35] and so we have bride members that are
[1:11:37] paying attention to the ministry that
[1:11:38] god has placed in the body
[1:11:41] and neither you or anybody else can take
[1:11:43] out what god has installed
[1:11:45] i don't care who it is what the name is
[1:11:47] we've got to stick with scripture
[1:11:50] so as elect of god
[1:11:52] we are waiting in love for the promise
[1:11:54] of the age to be confirmed
[1:11:57] remember that from august
[1:11:58] we we are going somewhere we're waiting
[1:12:01] for the promise of the age to be
[1:12:02] confirmed she is watching for it she is
[1:12:04] part of that word and she's watching for
[1:12:07] her life not everybody else
[1:12:09] my life to manifest that word it's a
[1:12:12] direct quote
[1:12:13] and in hebrews 11 it says all these
[1:12:16] about 20 individuals having obtained a
[1:12:18] good report through faith received not
[1:12:20] the promise god having provided a better
[1:12:23] thing for us that they without us should
[1:12:25] not be made perfect so they are waiting
[1:12:27] for us
[1:12:29] see they're waiting for us to get
[1:12:30] balanced
[1:12:32] and um
[1:12:33] but so many are wasting time and money
[1:12:36] on foolishness because we still have
[1:12:38] three kinds of believers
[1:12:41] only in heaven there'll be no
[1:12:42] make-believers and unbelievers
[1:12:45] jesus told us in matthew 24 that there
[1:12:47] would come along those that would claim
[1:12:49] to be anointed
[1:12:51] and appear to be very special
[1:12:53] you know follow me single file don't ask
[1:12:56] questions i know the way
[1:12:57] but jesus told us in advance believe not
[1:13:00] such things
[1:13:02] it's in the scripture you've got to read
[1:13:03] your bible
[1:13:04] then a few years later paul came along
[1:13:06] and gave us
[1:13:07] the words in ii timothy i mean ii
[1:13:10] thessalonians
[1:13:11] right back here ii thessalonians chapter
[1:13:14] 2
[1:13:16] where it says um
[1:13:19] now we beseech thee
[1:13:21] wait a minute
[1:13:23] ii the psalms too right um
[1:13:26] now we beseech thee brethren by the
[1:13:27] coming our lord jesus christ and by our
[1:13:29] gathering together unto him that you be
[1:13:31] not soon shaken in mind or be troubled
[1:13:34] neither
[1:13:35] by spirit or by word nor letter from us
[1:13:38] because there were some false letters
[1:13:39] going out
[1:13:42] that the day of christ is at hand
[1:13:45] verse 3 let no man deceive you by any
[1:13:47] means
[1:13:49] for that day shall not come except there
[1:13:51] be some
[1:13:53] except there come a falling away
[1:13:55] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:13:57] of perdition
[1:13:59] so right here in 2022
[1:14:02] this day this scripture is being
[1:14:04] fulfilled it's it's coming into focus
[1:14:06] you see
[1:14:07] brother brown says in the great servant
[1:14:09] moses 1955 as moses went with that
[1:14:11] judgment sticking before him that same
[1:14:14] stick tonight to the church is jesus
[1:14:16] christ if those egyptians could have
[1:14:18] ever got that little stick out of moses
[1:14:19] hands they would have had him whipped
[1:14:22] and the devil
[1:14:24] when he can get the deity out of the
[1:14:26] name of jesus christ he'll have the
[1:14:28] church whip
[1:14:29] and we've got any number of people
[1:14:31] putting the deity of jesus christ over
[1:14:32] here over there somewhere else and they
[1:14:35] have no victory at all
[1:14:37] so come back away from the dangerous
[1:14:40] borderline okay the borderline of
[1:14:42] unbelief
[1:14:43] um
[1:14:44] eve didn't have any idea how far her
[1:14:47] mistake was going to take her you see
[1:14:49] and none of these individuals that have
[1:14:50] turned their back on the truth
[1:14:52] uh that we treasure
[1:14:55] none of them planned to go where they're
[1:14:56] at today
[1:14:58] they thought they had a better idea
[1:14:59] they're smarter they can go yeah we can
[1:15:01] no you're going down
[1:15:04] so it's already been predicted
[1:15:06] and it's not going to be smooth sailing
[1:15:08] the good times are behind us okay
[1:15:10] troubled waters are ahead
[1:15:12] and um
[1:15:14] we always thought yeah that'll be out
[1:15:15] there someday no it's now
[1:15:17] now is the time
[1:15:19] but i thought everybody carrying this
[1:15:20] bible and these spoken word books you
[1:15:21] know and they'd be worthy of our
[1:15:23] confidence don't you bank on it
[1:15:26] now there's a bunch of liars and all
[1:15:28] kinds of stuff going on discern
[1:15:30] carefully
[1:15:31] in these days with jesus they had the
[1:15:33] pharisees they knew their prophet's
[1:15:35] message just right you know
[1:15:37] and
[1:15:38] so we have things today
[1:15:41] that people are repeating
[1:15:43] scripture they're repeating things and
[1:15:45] calling for single file believers
[1:15:47] brother brahm never said that he said
[1:15:49] arm up that means all the way across
[1:15:51] make a sweep
[1:15:52] not a single file you know hitler tried
[1:15:54] that
[1:15:55] and so um
[1:15:57] but if we look at isaiah 46 and verse 9
[1:16:02] i'm going to go over here real quick
[1:16:03] we're not going to stay much
[1:16:04] longer let's see here
[1:16:08] isaiah 46
[1:16:11] and verse 9
[1:16:14] we have
[1:16:16] remember the former things of old for i
[1:16:19] am god and there is none else i am god
[1:16:22] and there is none like me
[1:16:23] declaring the end from the beginning
[1:16:26] and from ancient times the things that
[1:16:28] are not yet to come in other words
[1:16:30] future
[1:16:32] say my counsel shall stand and i will do
[1:16:35] all my pleasure
[1:16:37] god is in control okay
[1:16:40] god's map is all on one page he sees the
[1:16:42] whole thing
[1:16:44] paul wrote without controversy great is
[1:16:46] a mystery of in us
[1:16:48] in spanish he says
[1:16:49] unarguably
[1:16:51] great is a mystery of godliness but
[1:16:53] we've got people who've dedicated their
[1:16:54] entire life to prove you know their
[1:16:57] version of godhead and such no just
[1:16:59] leave it alone
[1:17:01] it's unarguably you know
[1:17:03] so the time is now
[1:17:05] for the fulfillment of certain
[1:17:06] scriptures
[1:17:08] it's the manifestation of every seed
[1:17:10] according to its kind in genesis 1 11 it
[1:17:12] says every seed according to its kind
[1:17:15] the baptists are producing more baptists
[1:17:17] we believe that you by coming here
[1:17:19] you're learning more word you're
[1:17:20] becoming more ready for a rapture you
[1:17:22] see
[1:17:23] scripture cannot be broken scripture
[1:17:25] cannot be stopped it's moving and our
[1:17:28] god is on time and he's all about
[1:17:30] balance
[1:17:32] and our canary brain can't interpret god
[1:17:34] okay
[1:17:35] god speaks to his anointed prophet
[1:17:37] and god fulfills his word on his
[1:17:40] schedule
[1:17:41] so
[1:17:43] the time is now
[1:17:44] when the prophetic word is in effect
[1:17:48] it's always been the case from the
[1:17:49] beginning from the very church first
[1:17:51] church age
[1:17:52] and um
[1:17:55] he says here in every age we have
[1:17:56] exactly the same pattern so it's going
[1:17:59] to repeat
[1:18:00] that is why the light comes through some
[1:18:02] god-given messenger in a certain area
[1:18:04] and then from that messenger that
[1:18:06] spreads out the light to the ministry of
[1:18:07] others that have been faithfully taught
[1:18:10] and if they've been faithfully taught
[1:18:11] they'll produce similar fruits and
[1:18:12] similar spirit but of course all those
[1:18:14] who go out don't always learn how
[1:18:15] necessary it is to speak only what the
[1:18:17] messenger that the messenger has spoken
[1:18:20] they add here they take away there and
[1:18:22] soon the message is no longer pure and
[1:18:24] the revival dies down how careful we
[1:18:27] must be to hear one voice be careful
[1:18:30] before we go jump into conclusions
[1:18:32] it says here
[1:18:34] um
[1:18:34] the for the for the spirit has but one
[1:18:37] voice which is the voice of god paul
[1:18:39] warned them to say what what he said
[1:18:41] even as peter did likewise he warned
[1:18:43] them even he paul could not change one
[1:18:46] word of what was given by revelation how
[1:18:48] important it is to hear the voice of god
[1:18:50] by way of his messengers
[1:18:53] there's always been a voice of god on
[1:18:55] the earth you see
[1:18:56] to say what has been given to
[1:18:59] them to say to the churches and
[1:19:01] according to
[1:19:02] galatians 1 8 paul you know had been
[1:19:05] with these people a few months before
[1:19:06] maybe a year he had taught them they
[1:19:08] come to repentance they were baptized
[1:19:10] now he comes back and he said i'm
[1:19:11] surprised that you strayed what happened
[1:19:13] here
[1:19:14] he said if i come back or if barnabas or
[1:19:18] even an angel comes out of heaven and
[1:19:19] preaches anything different than what i
[1:19:21] gave you over here by revelation let him
[1:19:23] be accursed
[1:19:24] that means go straight to the hot place
[1:19:26] you know
[1:19:27] so as ministers we're not innovators
[1:19:29] we're not trying to polish this and make
[1:19:31] it look different we're not looking for
[1:19:33] shortcuts we're not we're not dreamers
[1:19:35] we're not money gatherers we're just and
[1:19:38] we're not managers of god's bride
[1:19:40] when you see that step away from it
[1:19:43] we're not seeking to control everything
[1:19:45] we're just simply repeaters that's why
[1:19:47] you'll see me repeating what he said see
[1:19:49] and
[1:19:50] we are out here to encourage the bride
[1:19:52] of christ to stay with the program stay
[1:19:54] balanced
[1:19:56] and don't be looking over the fence you
[1:19:58] get in trouble you see
[1:20:00] and so our job is to make christ real to
[1:20:02] the people for the perfecting of the
[1:20:04] saints
[1:20:06] we are simply public servants
[1:20:09] to help you
[1:20:10] okay
[1:20:11] and so we got to stick with the
[1:20:12] blueprint we don't deviate you got to
[1:20:15] stick with it
[1:20:16] elijah says over here in the
[1:20:17] resurrection of lazarus
[1:20:20] he says lift up your heads redemption is
[1:20:21] drawing nigh get ready
[1:20:24] signs and wonders appearing
[1:20:26] this is 1950.
[1:20:29] signs and wonders appearing critics
[1:20:31] infidels waxing worse and worse
[1:20:34] yeah it wouldn't it never has been easy
[1:20:36] we've got to put up with them but we're
[1:20:38] not looking to them we're looking to god
[1:20:40] amen so watch what you put in your head
[1:20:42] you see
[1:20:43] so the time is now what are you focusing
[1:20:46] on what are you reflecting here in dark
[1:20:48] laodicea you see
[1:20:50] in 1951 the angel of the lord you
[1:20:52] remember church that you're living in
[1:20:54] the best day that you will ever live in
[1:20:57] right now until jesus comes he says it
[1:21:00] shall gradually and he changes it not
[1:21:02] gradually but rapidly get worse and
[1:21:04] worse
[1:21:05] well 1950 that was way back
[1:21:08] now here we are yeah very rapidly things
[1:21:10] are changing
[1:21:11] so when these things come to pass what
[1:21:13] are we going to do we're going to open
[1:21:15] up saying what we're going to do you
[1:21:16] know you call 9-1-1
[1:21:18] uh change churches yeah those people
[1:21:20] that
[1:21:21] no that doesn't work stay here and let
[1:21:23] your light shine let's see you call
[1:21:25] headquarters what should we do please
[1:21:26] help no lift up your heads
[1:21:29] your redemption is drawing nigh
[1:21:32] luke 21 28 when you see these things
[1:21:34] come to pass look up
[1:21:36] don't get involved don't try to change
[1:21:38] everything just look up
[1:21:41] so the flashing red light of his coming
[1:21:42] is another favorite message he says they
[1:21:44] have to call us bad names
[1:21:46] so get used to it
[1:21:49] they have to call the truth bad names
[1:21:51] jesus said whosoever speaks a word
[1:21:52] against the son of man it shall be
[1:21:54] forgiven
[1:21:55] yeah he said now whatever you guys say
[1:21:58] and do i'll forgive you no problem but
[1:22:00] when my spirit comes back it does the
[1:22:02] same thing one word you're off the list
[1:22:06] serious
[1:22:07] whosoever speaks one
[1:22:09] speaks against the holy ghost when it
[1:22:10] comes to the same thing will never be
[1:22:12] forgiven in this world see they have to
[1:22:14] do that there has to be a message like
[1:22:16] that to make the people make fun of it
[1:22:18] to show god's justice to condemn the
[1:22:20] whole world and destroy it
[1:22:22] while there is mercy and someone
[1:22:24] standing in the gap jesus christ an open
[1:22:26] door tonight won't you receive him
[1:22:29] wow
[1:22:32] over here in what is abraham and his
[1:22:34] seed do you know what god did he reached
[1:22:36] out with his hand and stopped it he is
[1:22:38] holding time in his hand for the church
[1:22:40] to make itself ready
[1:22:42] there are a few members yet to come into
[1:22:44] the body of christ maybe one of them is
[1:22:46] here today that's why i'm here that's
[1:22:48] why i'm led to be here not to try to
[1:22:50] persuade you i'm not speaking i'm not
[1:22:51] trying to say you know don't be catholic
[1:22:53] don't be methodist i ain't saying that
[1:22:56] but i want you to be filled with the
[1:22:57] spirit just remember i'll meet you on
[1:22:59] that day
[1:23:01] and these words will be a witness
[1:23:02] against you it's all on god's tape
[1:23:04] recording and with his great picture
[1:23:06] camera now this is 1961 they didn't have
[1:23:09] video cameras but he's talking about it
[1:23:11] on the big picture camera you know and
[1:23:13] you sitting and walking away and leaving
[1:23:14] it and you'll see your own self on that
[1:23:16] day in the mirror of god
[1:23:19] the gospel and power of almighty god is
[1:23:21] spread around the world and the
[1:23:22] separation time is now taking place when
[1:23:25] god is calling a bride and the devil is
[1:23:26] calling a church
[1:23:28] let me be part of that bribe
[1:23:30] so the time is now
[1:23:32] don't let another day go by until you
[1:23:34] get serious
[1:23:35] and like brother brown says the most
[1:23:37] important thing you can
[1:23:38] uh hope for the most important thing you
[1:23:40] can seek is revelation of the word
[1:23:43] that's right now we need to read it so
[1:23:45] we know what it says but it's got to be
[1:23:46] revealed to you so we're going to cut
[1:23:48] there because we can go on a long time
[1:23:50] with some other things but god knows
[1:23:52] what the needs are and i'm just glad to
[1:23:54] be alive and
[1:23:56] got breath to come and see you
[1:23:58] god bless you
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:21] enjoy it tonight
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:24] and i thank god for his word you know
[1:24:26] it's
[1:24:27] it's true you know as
[1:24:29] so many things we're living in a time
[1:24:32] where the scripture says in first john
[1:24:34] chapter 4 beloved try
[1:24:36] every spirit
[1:24:39] and i think that's a that's a very it's
[1:24:41] a very key
[1:24:42] key point
[1:24:45] to me
[1:24:47] you know i don't have any time for
[1:24:48] anything if someone wants to raise a
[1:24:50] question about this message
[1:24:53] don't have any time for you
[1:24:55] sorry
[1:24:56] because god's already vindicated it
[1:25:00] and
[1:25:01] for a person that wants to even try to
[1:25:03] straighten things out well god never
[1:25:06] called me nor any other minister
[1:25:08] to qualify this message in the scripture
[1:25:13] god's already vindicated it
[1:25:15] what god has called us to do as
[1:25:17] ministers
[1:25:18] is come under that same anointing of the
[1:25:21] word that's what samuel poured out upon
[1:25:24] david
[1:25:25] and david went in that word anointing
[1:25:27] and what it did
[1:25:29] it brought the strength of israel
[1:25:31] back into the camp
[1:25:33] and it was the strength of israel
[1:25:35] that defeated
[1:25:37] goliath
[1:25:39] i tell you the enemy in this hours i
[1:25:42] rehearsed that quote to you from the
[1:25:43] message the contest on sunday
[1:25:45] brother brahm says satan is getting more
[1:25:47] powerful and more powerful and more
[1:25:50] powerful
[1:25:52] but it only shows you an eye
[1:25:55] of what god
[1:25:56] is to us in this hour
[1:25:59] he is greater
[1:26:01] than any power of the enemy
[1:26:05] you know i look at that always in
[1:26:07] revelations 9 when it speaks
[1:26:09] of that king that one of the bottomless
[1:26:12] pit
[1:26:14] it was given a key to release all those
[1:26:16] spirits
[1:26:18] those demon spirits began to go and
[1:26:20] found channels brother graham tells us
[1:26:22] in face of the trumpets it found
[1:26:24] channels
[1:26:25] men like stalin
[1:26:27] hitler to work through
[1:26:31] and as it was moving and working to the
[1:26:34] tender hand of jehovah to bring
[1:26:37] israel put them push them back into
[1:26:38] their homeland
[1:26:40] but yet those same spirits
[1:26:42] are released
[1:26:44] against the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:47] you see the forces that we face now you
[1:26:50] know we we catch a little glimpse and we
[1:26:52] see how that things that rise up against
[1:26:54] israel rise up against israel because
[1:26:57] satan knows the prophecy as well as
[1:27:00] anybody does
[1:27:02] he knows the prophecy that god's going
[1:27:04] to bring them back and when that moment
[1:27:07] comes that that time everything is his
[1:27:09] days are numbered
[1:27:11] but i love
[1:27:13] the very next verse i love how
[1:27:14] revelations 10 1 starts
[1:27:17] it deals with them spirits been released
[1:27:19] in revelations 9 but the very first word
[1:27:21] of revelations 10 says and i saw
[1:27:25] another mighty angel
[1:27:26] [Laughter]
[1:27:28] oh i love that
[1:27:30] and i saw so
[1:27:32] above all of these
[1:27:34] spirits this gross darkness
[1:27:37] the mighty angel
[1:27:39] the holy spirit
[1:27:41] the fullness of the word of god the
[1:27:43] person of jesus christ is here
[1:27:47] in bride form
[1:27:50] he's here in his body
[1:27:53] there's a bride that's been anointed for
[1:27:55] rapture our eyes we we're not looking
[1:27:58] for another we're not looking for
[1:28:01] another message
[1:28:02] we're not looking for a
[1:28:04] you know another revelation out here we
[1:28:06] have found him
[1:28:08] and the reality we have found him is
[1:28:10] that what was drawing and we were
[1:28:13] longing for
[1:28:14] we tried this maybe went here in the
[1:28:16] world or tried this
[1:28:18] none of that could satisfy because we
[1:28:20] were built
[1:28:21] it was ordained
[1:28:23] that god himself
[1:28:25] would come
[1:28:26] and bring forth
[1:28:28] that place
[1:28:30] that he reserved for himself in our life
[1:28:34] and that temple is a temple not made
[1:28:36] with hands
[1:28:37] god has prepared that place for himself
[1:28:40] he's jehovah jireh and he's come
[1:28:43] to bring us to himself you realize
[1:28:45] nothing else
[1:28:47] nothing else when that revelation
[1:28:49] strikes there's nothing else that
[1:28:51] matters
[1:28:53] nothing else brother brown said it just
[1:28:55] as plain as this right here in trying to
[1:28:57] do god of service and shreveport he said
[1:28:59] once you have once seen the message
[1:29:02] you cannot see anything else
[1:29:07] because it's not our eyes it's not our
[1:29:11] oh i'll read into this and i'll study
[1:29:13] this
[1:29:14] all the study and not that study is is
[1:29:16] bad
[1:29:17] but all of that like it says there was
[1:29:19] in the book of kali ecclesiastes much
[1:29:21] study worries
[1:29:23] is we're we're trying to do something
[1:29:25] brother brahm brings us and tells us
[1:29:27] real quickly he says
[1:29:29] it will take more
[1:29:31] than comparing verse to verse
[1:29:34] to make this
[1:29:35] book real
[1:29:37] he said it will take an operation of the
[1:29:39] holy ghost now to me
[1:29:41] i'm thankful for that
[1:29:44] because my understanding is not based on
[1:29:46] my bachelor's degree or my bachelor's
[1:29:48] master's it's not based on that
[1:29:51] it's based on a revelation of the holy
[1:29:53] ghost
[1:29:54] and i'm glad so that means no matter if
[1:29:56] you
[1:29:57] high school drop out no matter no matter
[1:29:59] we're not supporting the literacy but
[1:30:00] you understand it's not based upon
[1:30:03] our ability you might say brother samuel
[1:30:05] i can't memorize scripture revelation is
[1:30:07] not based on can you memorize scripture
[1:30:10] but can you recognize the living god who
[1:30:14] speaks to your heart personally and
[1:30:17] deals with your life and it's this is
[1:30:19] between you and him that's a living god
[1:30:21] coming personally to your life
[1:30:24] that's a revelation to recognize who it
[1:30:27] is that's doing the speaking that it's
[1:30:30] god who's speaking to me and that same
[1:30:32] god who's speaking to me is the same god
[1:30:34] who's always knew me cared about me
[1:30:37] loves me and desires to be one with me
[1:30:40] and direct and order my life
[1:30:42] oh
[1:30:44] how beautiful it is
[1:30:46] to walk and to recognize this within the
[1:30:48] economy of god no wonder the scripture
[1:30:50] said behold all things have become new
[1:30:54] once he has come
[1:30:56] then you're no longer ringing and
[1:30:58] reading a letter
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] it just it just starts coming off the
[1:31:02] page
[1:31:03] or it don't all come together all at
[1:31:05] once
[1:31:07] no
[1:31:07] they don't all come together all at once
[1:31:10] there's things i i still said even in
[1:31:12] the morning
[1:31:13] in devotions
[1:31:15] there's times as i'm studying and man
[1:31:17] things just is impressing and i look and
[1:31:19] say wow
[1:31:20] wow
[1:31:21] my yeah it's like i've never seen this
[1:31:24] before
[1:31:25] what it is is that it just keeps going
[1:31:27] deeper
[1:31:28] and deeper and deeper
[1:31:31] and it's him
[1:31:33] it's him
[1:31:34] it's not prying
[1:31:36] it's just going deeper in him
[1:31:38] you know the reality of this this
[1:31:40] revelation that god has brought to us in
[1:31:42] this hour it was not a was not
[1:31:45] you or i having to pry things open
[1:31:48] but god in this hour through
[1:31:50] this revelation of jesus christ has
[1:31:53] opened
[1:31:55] took the lid
[1:31:56] off of that mountain revealed opened it
[1:31:59] up we have an access now
[1:32:02] there's an open channel
[1:32:04] there's an open channel of inspiration
[1:32:06] that we have for everyone it don't
[1:32:07] matter if you're father mother you may
[1:32:09] say brother samuel i'm a i'm a mother
[1:32:11] you have access to an open channel
[1:32:14] you guys say bro samuel sometimes when i
[1:32:16] put on the message i seem like i i you
[1:32:18] know i have to go back and rewind this
[1:32:20] or listen
[1:32:21] just relax

[1:32:34] i'm a witness to that i'm not just
[1:32:36] telling you that i'm a witness to that
[1:32:39] [Music]
[1:32:42] sometimes we're so tight on different
[1:32:44] things even when we're reading in the
[1:32:46] scripture
[1:32:47] just
[1:32:48] just read brother bran would tell us he
[1:32:49] says as a new convert
[1:32:52] he said
[1:32:53] read
[1:32:54] a chapter each night and just say amen
[1:32:58] say amen to the word of god
[1:33:01] whatever god has started wherever you're
[1:33:03] at in your walk with god no matter where
[1:33:05] it is at
[1:33:07] don't wait if you don't have the holy
[1:33:09] ghost he's here tonight you can receive
[1:33:11] him
[1:33:13] but recognize you can't make you can't
[1:33:15] make anything happen but what you can do
[1:33:18] is feed on the word
[1:33:20] and give yourself to the word and
[1:33:22] invites god to come
[1:33:25] and and always like brother ramsey when

[1:33:57] different from the holy ghost it is the
[1:33:59] holy ghost that has come to the church
[1:34:01] of the living god in this hour you take
[1:34:04] the holy ghost from the church it's dark

[1:34:09] clear can be he says you take the holy
[1:34:11] ghost away from the church it's no more
[1:34:13] than just a bejeweled corpse
[1:34:16] laying in a casket
[1:34:18] without the holy ghost
