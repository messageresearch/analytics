man our brothers got a testimony that he's gonna pray for you can be seated for a moment as may take just a minute but I like sister brownie I just like to give a testimony of praise and thanks to to the Lord just had a dilemma this week where my my work card check engine lights start coming on and started missing and stuff and so there's just just been a hectic week trying to figure out okay am I going to get this fixed or get a replacement or or you know what what to do and and it just really had me worn down and God just stepped in and a in a in a special way and ended up you know he just led me to do the right thing you know to to a replacement vehicle and you know it's it's not about you know a car yeah it's going to be dust and ashes someday and totally gone babe you know it's about you know sometimes when you know we're praying about things for maybe years or something and then you know God answers a scene and we can we can see that in other times it's like this where you're kind of blindsided by something and God steps in in a special way and leads and guide you in and you look back and you say wow you know he was with me the whole time even though my mind wasn't even you know honor he was there leading and guiding me the whole time and I just want to give thanks to the Lord for you know and when you just stop and think about it you know here's the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and the you know controls all space and time and matter he took time out of his day to to come and minister to me personally and make sure my needs were met that's just special to meet Saints I just it just says so I've had a song on my heart for last I just been seen at the last few weeks for some reason and I just like to sing a verse of it comes from Psalms 32 where you know King David just imagined him you know when he's pulled away in the wilderness and maybe King saw had him surrounded or something there was a certain inspiration that hit him and but he said singing to the Lord he said you are my hiding place you know and he wasn't dependent on his stealthiness or his abilities to to do anything and and I think it's it falls right in line with you know Psalms 27 at the rapture what we're facing nowadays when the enemy has to surround it but there's a hiding place that we run to and so the songs layout of my abilities to to sing but but it's just on my heart to sing and you are my hiding place you always feel with songs of deliverance whenever I am NOT free I will trust in you I will trust in you let the weak say I am strong in the strength of I will trust in you [Music] we just stand and sing with me you always fear [Music] whenever [Music] I will trust a I will trust [Music] let the weak say [Music] industry I will trust [Music] a man if

of the adjutant's he is a deliverer Savior he's a Redeemer amen I'm so thankful for all of that all that he is and you know to think of it if there wasn't needs that arose in our life then he would not be able to manifest in himself in that way but he loves to make himself known to his children they may God will election allow situations to arise like he did when he brought Israel out of Egypt he brought them out and God cared for them all along the way and just even as they cross the Red Sea they come across the Red Sea and they come he leads them to the waters of Marah it would look like why right after such a great victory after a wonderful service and here we are at Marah but God said I'm gonna take this opportunity and I'm gonna show you that I'm your healer let me just tell you it's more than just physical healing in our bodies sometimes we get weary in our spirit and he said I'm just gonna show you that always in the midst of a trial I'm always standing there he showed Moses there's a tree that's there cut that tree down and put it in the water I'll tell you what a privilege we have that no matter what situation it is Jesus Christ is present and when he when we invited him in and say Lord you're here president you're over this that changes and that sweetens the waters of ma I love that don't you when they had need they they they they had need of bread they had need of food but God took an opportunity like that to let them know that I am your provision I'll tell you I could go on my weak we could preach on that for but I just I love the Lord I love the Lord I know you do - I've just to me those are those are things in the word that I just take and I just hug right up next to my bosom amen so we just think God so much for His grace and mercy this morning and we just want to just turn our attention to the word of the Lord so if we could let's go to Romans chapter 4 and we would like to begin reading there on verse 9 in Romans 4 and after I kept you all so long last week I'm glad you came back you know III do say this from my from my heart you know I I never intend to minister that long and you might say by the salmon you just kind of say that no I I give them all but I know that if I'd said anyway everything that was in front of me that was here well we'd we'd be here a long time but I just want to say what it is that he sees that's needful to be said for this moment and and and so sometimes you know for myself I I just be honest with you I I don't like going that long because I pay for it I pay for it in a way that it just keeps going as far as within my body and and in my spirit but out what to me I I just I love God's people so I want you to understand I love you and and you you all were pulling last week as well as we were going through these things and so we just we just just so appreciate the Lord we want to just look a little bit more here today and I asked you to keep us in prayer if you wouldn't the wife and I'll be heading out to the meetings they're in North Carolina Lord willing we be speaking there and the service and the convention there but the Tim Hume so just ask that you would just remember us in prayer certainly coverage of prayers and whether Nathan Ericson will be here on Thursday as well as on Sunday so we want to just keep that in prayer and know that God is mindful of our needs amen Romans chapter 4 verse 9 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckon when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received I want you to notice these words and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had being yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believed though they be not circumcised that the righteousness might be imputed unto them also so Paul remember what Paul is dealing with here unto Paul was committed the mystery that had been hidden yet was laid down through the Old Testament prophets of how that God would take unto himself a Gentile bride circumcised being that of the Jews the uncircumcised being that of the Gentiles but notice how Paul led by the Spirit of God is bringing this that it would be by that of faith and God recognizing that faith and verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our faith father Abraham you see how that scripture says that who by faith who walk in the steps of our Father the steps of that faith of our father Abraham we're not we don't have a different faith it's V faith which he had I want you to watch look at that which he had what did he have that faith he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith a man so let's just look to the Lord in the word of Prayer you're this morning you've got a need on your heart why don't you just let it be known by an uplifted hand say Lord I received this morning I received my answer Lord I receive what I have need for you Lord Jesus you are Lord you have the ever-present God Lord you're the lovely one Lord in our midst Lord that has touched our hearts and lives and Lord Jesus how we just Lord so appreciate you Lord how we're thankful God how that you come Lord you peel back the pages of your word oh god you not only take the seals off of this book but you take them off of our lives Oh God that father you're the only one Lord that can do that Lord we love you and we praise you this morning God and just ask that Lord that in the sweetness of your holy spirit Oh God made the same rushing mighty wind just move Oh God not just in this building but Lord we know it came in the building where they were at first and then Lord it came Lord to every individual temple Lord that was seated in that building Lord with our hearts God filled with an expectation Lord as believers we ask that God that you would pour out of the Holy Ghost this morning Lord God once again Oh God a refreshing Lord for you know our needs Lord you know Lord behind every uplifted hand Lord and you're the dissolver of every doubt or God you are the answer to every question Lord so Lord for every need Lord God we come minute Lord to you and we believe that it is your will that that need or God would be satisfied in our lives so Lord God is your children Lord we plant that seed we water with praise we accept that Lord and we now claim it or God as our very own and we thank you Lord for the promises Lord that you have made to us Oh God for they are for us Lord we love you and praising our Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then God blesses your being seated I want to come back here this morning and I I want to to deal with the once again just to polish up a little bit on this on the the sign of circumcision and then moving right into that of the seal and we're dealing with the the the thought the promise of the Father and what is the Holy Ghost because it's things that if I can say it like this and we all I believe would agree there's so much to where that the label of Christian has been so cheapened and so weakened to where it does not hold the same value that it are used to hold and what I mean is you can even look at it and you know we're you know even within the currency that's on the market right now the dollar and everything else that goes on and there look and does it hold the value you know that that it always held and you know I think back in the in the in in in in in the Bible times where it would speak of how they would take a coin and they they would weigh things by this coin and and and they would put these weights on but they would begin to shave those weights down so that just in our terminology it might say a5 like like a five pounds on it but yet it really wasn't five pounds it had been shaved down to where it did not hold the same density and I believe that was all my heart that without the Holy Ghost we we are are helpless we we would not know where we are where we ought to be and where we are going without the Holy Spirit and so it all comes back down to us as the believer to realize the greatest privilege that we have as believers is to be born of the Spirit of God and to be led by the Holy Ghost and that's the greatest privilege that that we have as believers and we know that within us that there is a a great difference in a Christian and then a Holy Ghost filled Christian many times that we see and I want you to also take courage in this that where their hearts are listening to it now or later but you don't ever don't ever despise the small things or leave leave loose or look out and say well you know I've not arrived to this place yet but it's always something when you look at like a board that is in front of you and you want to know where you are and you know okay this is where I want to be then if you can see where you are then you actually begin to look at that there are checkpoints that you're going to cross in order to arrive at this place and I just say it like this and you know I know that malls are old-fashioned now but if you wanted to go through a certain store in the mall you're not going to get into that store unless you first get in the mall so they're first has to start alive that starts with repentance and I I'll just say it feel like this I don't discount that I don't look down on that but the Holy Ghost it calls us to a deeper walk because who is it that brought us to repentance is him himself and and he's the one that has already that starts to work in us you see that the the filling of the Holy Ghost the capping of the Holy Ghost is the capping of his work that's been going on all along so when we when we recognize this there can be lives that are in process and I think God for a life that's in process but but you know it's just like when it's in process we don't want to just let it set on the assembly line let's keep moving on in the things of God let's get to the place that God desires us to get to and I'll say it like this this morning and and trust that this Holy Ghost will just bring it clear it is all the work of God and it takes God and it is him that brings it all along into that place to where you just pray in your hearts I've got some ground to cover here but I want to to to hopefully get us to a place to where you can see and just revisiting these things are not new to many of us these things are refreshing but yet I want to revisit them just feeling led of the Holy Spirit to do that that it would also bring comfort to our hearts then it would also be that to where you can take that and and put it right in the devil's face and say take that to think of it first of all Abraham as we looked in the scripture and God had spoke to him and called to him even when he was down there in the midst of the condition that he was in down there and in Babylon or the earth of counties where he was at and the Word of God came to him and ministered to him and then as Abraham began to follow the voice and the leading of God then God comes around and comes in Genesis 17 like we looked at last week and he ministers to Abraham the sign of circumcision you see God now is taking the promise that he's made to Abraham Abraham has believed in that promise Abraham has walked and he has journeyed out of the land where he is come into the land of promise and now God after confirming the covenant of what that that he alone will do in Genesis 15 then God comes along and God tells him I want you to circumcise every male that is among you those that are born in the house and even those that are bought with money I want you to circumcise them and it will be a sign that the scripture says in Genesis 17 it would be a token of the Covenant it would be a sign and so we find that God's Word as it is ministered now that word it comes to become an actual sign that is reflected in was called to reproduce the faith of Elohim and when it came to that place he said then God steps in and he seals him and now it becomes the faith of Elohim now manifested through Abraham's life a pain that calls those things that are not as though they harm you see that's what the seal of God does the sign of circumcision it is that which you can say this belongs to me and I'll say it to you like this this morning as the son and daughter of God the word in this hour it comes to call sons and daughters of God and it comes to anoint our hearts to believe in the Word of God to believe despite all doubt and unbelief and every devil that's around us there is an anointing that has been poured out upon this generation and it is an anointing of God's Word the Holy Spirit to anoint sons and daughters of God to walk where Enoch walk to walk where Abraham walk to walk where Rebecca law to walk were Esther walk it is the anointing of the word a man that is capable to believer in this hour and he calls us to this place that Christ might fulfill every promise that he's ever made and make it manifest through the life of the believer a man we are under the anointing of the word in this hour we've been not a we're not anointed to fail we've been anointed for rapture brother we're not going down we're going up amen this is the anointing that's been poured out we've been not we have not been anointed with a vile soul was anointed with a vile a foul as judgment but we have been anointed with the Horn of the RAM hey Manon has been poured out God gave that anointing oil that word that came to the Prophet and now what did the prophet do he was told there is a man down here I want you to go and noid him and the Prophet had to be obedient to the word of the Lord it need passed by every one of those seven sons but it was the eighth son that he came and he anointed and remember when he was there to measure that anointing he asked he looked at every one of them and said man this is a good looking one this is a good surely the Lord surely this was the one but the one that he was too anointed was not in the house at that time but he asked where is he at there is one to match the word in this hour I'm telling you I'm looking at you this morning you're anointed for this hour [Applause] hallelujah the Holy Ghost has sought you out Natalia it is the heavenly father he knew exactly and knows exactly where you have been and he sought you out and drew you to himself this circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost this in the Old Testament types that now would become manifest God is showing in types it was a sign of separation and distinction from all other people it is the sign of the covenant to a covenant people amen and remember as I want you to I want you to listen this now for everybody remember it is the Word of God being received and acted upon that actually brings the separation in a life like fishing it actually listen to me now the Word of God being received listen though the Word of God can't do nothing for you if you don't receive it I believe it I mean I've asked you do you receive it you first got to believe it but then you got to receive it and then once you receive it you begin to act upon it not by feelings you act upon the word you have been leaved and received when you do that it brings separation let me just be very clearly blue BAM tells us just like this this is scriptural principles when you when you come and you receive the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior not just will I believe no have you made him your Savior then then you make a confession I'm a Christian and you confess what it is that you have received I have received I have believed he was he was bruised from my iniquity the chastisement of my peace is upon him by His stripes I'm healed he has borrowing my transmission then you confess cuz he is the high priest of your confession and as you confess it it works righteousness glory so to recognize that these promises that they are for us that it has come to us the Bible tells us in Galatians 3 let me read this now verse 13 Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree aren't you glad he brought judgment on sin nature he took within himself and he judged the Prince of this world he brought judgment on sin nature he paid the penalty and now he comes right back around with that same life and he ministers to you and I and removes the reproach of Egypt from upon our lives he listened to me he literally takes the condemnation that's over your life in the house of judgment he lifts it and puts it right back on the accuser that's what the blood of Jesus Christ tells it lifts it and puts it back on the one who is the originator of it hallelujah that's the shot knife of the world well glory verse 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ remember his hands were crossed when he blessed Joseph boys and that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith we were aliens strangers to the Covenant of promise but the Jews were blinded in the rejection of Messiah and the same way that they were rejected and dispersed John also said I will gather them in loving-kindness I will gather them I will bring them back home I will cause the places that are desolate to become fruitful alleluia God said I'll take away the reproach that had been brought to my name I will bring you back home aren't you glad that is a type that right there what God does you'll do with Israel he's in process is the same thing that God has done with us as believers we were outside of this land of promise but he has brought us back home why were we outside of this land of promise because they rejected holy ghost but he said I'll bring you back that land of promise is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the full Word of God and God said I'll bring you back to my self I will plant you in this land all the idols that have been set up in the slab they shall be cleansed they shall be removed the names of every other God I'll take it out of your vocabulary I'll give you a language that will be a pure language there will be my own utterance well blessed be the name of the Lord thank God for this evening light hallelujah glory be to God ah I felt like just preaching on them few scriptures this morning Oh verse 26 for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ Paul not just talking about being baptized which you should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ it's not an option you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins Booth's and I believe it right here but the Bible tells us in the book of Peter 1st Peter chapter 3 I believe it is that not walking into water baptism it is a sign that there is an inward work that has taken place you say God looks on the heart I agree we read now to Romans 4 but remember what God looks on the heart will come to a full expression out in the life amen baptized into Christ you y'all you all been here and heard me preach on this enough this word Bab baptized right here it means to change your cucumber to a pickle there's two baptisms the cucumber you baptize it how many in here can can vegetables before you know way back in the days now we just eat the pickles that's all right it's a lot of work man I watched mom and daddy do it it's a lot of work when they did that stuff but you know that in the brother Joe and they take that cucumber you you you dip that in that hot water and when you dip it in that hot water brother David comes right back got a cucumber again but you know the hot waters are necessary because after the hot water he gets an all you know open and then you can take that cucumber and you put it down in that vinegar that vinegar has the acidity and the chemicals within it it changes it from a cucumber to a pickle brother it can never be a cucumber again it has become a pickle you see though just water baptism a person could go on and remain the same but when they have been baptized by the Holy Ghost and that ties into the body of Jesus Christ he can never go back out you have been changed they might look at you and said hey you you look like you was a cucumber one time I used to be a cucumber but the essence and the flavor and the aroma on my life is no longer a cucumber I am a pickle this is the kind of pickle I want to be in the purple brings this around there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus what Paul saying all must receive the same promise and receive it in the same way God don't care how rich you are or how poor you are you've got to come the same way God don't cows much you are how dumb you are you've got to come the same way [Music] he didn't matter if it's a servant or it was a master you gotta come the same way they manage humility to the Word of God that is ministered to our hearts and remember what humility does humility or Asian power humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God first Peter and he shall exalt thee in due time is that right now let's look at this here a little bit in verse 11 and he received the sign of circumcision romans 4:11 a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised now a seal in itself it's a like a signet ring an inscription or an impression that would be made by seal it's also that which would be likened to that of the name of God of Christ stamped on their foreheads I'm Oh we'll get to that in a moment then it's it's the confirming or proving or authenticating of anything it is a seal a token or a proof in Ephesians chapter one now notice this in Ephesians chapter one let's just skip to verse 13 in whom speaking of Jesus Christ in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth so you got you have to you can't believe until you're first here well I've always believed the Bible but now the sounding comes personal to let you know it's not just a good book amen this is God's will being ministered to his children so the gospel has got to be sounded first once it's sounded then you you you trust you believe after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory let me just say it to you like this God is going to accomplish what he already foresaw he tells you before the foundation of the world in him even through all your mistakes all the mud all the muck everything that would be packed in you but he wasn't choosing the mud or the month he looked at the life that would be there and through the resurrection power he would raise up that life that he knew I'm talking about the same one that was there in the book of Job where it says that the sons of God that the morning stars shouted for joy why we shouted in knowing that our redemption is sure there is a lamb there is a way that is made for us to come back home rather when that word begins to strike our heart he begins to bring our rejoicing hey believing you might look and say I don't even have the promise yet but there's an anointing upon the word that's contacting with you like a deep callin to the deed and you believe that it is for you what's it doing the words calling your name out I said the words calling your name out fusions 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption now you know a seal talking about now the Holy Ghost being a seal you know a seal shows coming and going you know when you have to have certain papers that have to be have a seal put on their right they got a special device you you can't just you don't go by one of these like you buy a whole bunch you don't you got to go through training you got to be authorized and validated to use that seal that seal itself that is being administered it takes ordinary normal paper but when that seal goes up on that paper you can take it and though you may not altogether see it right away but you can feel it and know it's there come on somebody Amen there because it is a coming and a glowing Amen I'm glad that he preserveth are coming in and are going out amen he's a seal of our lives a seal itself it shows a seal shows ownership remember God would speak therein in Timothy I believe it's 2nd Timothy that the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal that the Lord knoweth them that are his so it is receiving the seal listen to me the seal is receiving that impression and you know you could take that you can take that sheet of paper and you could try to do all you want to do you're not going to get that seal out of that paper I know there might be all sorts of things they can do it's a we can get it back out of it but you understand what I'm trying to say that in itself they might be able to kind of mess with that but we're talking about the seal of the Living God and once God has put that seal brother he don't take back none of his words God don't say oops I made a mistake he don't take back his word you are sealed unto the day of redemption let me just say like this the seal speaks of a finished work you are part listen to me now you are part of the finished word of the true atonement of Calvary your destiny is set and yet we are being perfected by the Ministry of the word we are growing up into him in all things it's quite a paradox he is finishing what he finished quite a paradox in it the seal itself you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption you're not sealed till you make your first mistake and then you're unsealed come on somebody amen you are sealed unto the day of redemption and that seal is not something separate from God but it is God himself hallelujah that liquor fire that part of God that inheritance that belongs to you that life that you were intended to have that life now showing live God's own life it comes into your life and brother what does it do it seals you under the day of redemption the Prophet said it like this from eternity to eternity there was a breach in your soul and the mind of God but God came down and he filled the breach and that's what the Holy Ghost is it is the abstract - the title deed it is the seal that ties you back in it is there we put his hand on a holy God and a sinful man he does away with the chasm and that's what the Holy Ghost does it feels the breach let me move to this day because I'm preaching from learning this day that is why the Ministry of the breech had to come forward before the first seal could ever be opened hallelujah before these truths can be really revealed there must be a separated life that is tied into God and there's no one a church cannot tie his back who revelations 5 it was looking for one a strong angel on earth proclaiming oh maybe I'm just feeling this way but let him come forth or forever hold his peace you know I'm quoting now amen and here come forth the lamb not a portion not a greater power but here came the entire fullness of the Holy Ghost to come and visit the church the Ministry of V southern man and it never left the church when the Prophet we'll also see that Saint Son of Man is here with you and I he is veiled in his bride hallelujah and that being in us is the seal the seal of this message you understand me now you can look at a truth and you recognize God has sealed this he's vindicated it Apollo's preached that vindication of the seal that Jesus was the Messiah but a palace was not preaching the seal to come to the womb of the believer you understand he was preaching on the messenger on the messenger and he was preaching on all of these things but where it was essential if you miss the Holy Ghost you miss it all because he is the feast he is the Sabbath he is a rapture he is a Redemption he is our sanctification so it was necessary that the coming of that word when God sends a message it is a promise that when that promise comes that there is coming into the hearts of the believers when he went away he said if I go away I will come again and receive you unto myself he said I'll send back the Holy Ghost what was it in his coming he made a promise of his coming by the Holy Ghost that would call me in the lives of the believer and that coming will now be that message in flesh in the lives of the people we just say like this I need no proof that this message is of God God has vindicated it and he's vindicated it right here [Applause] you said he'd revealed it but remember by the venom in the seals he starts laying it in and the seals coming into the future home he said it must not just be by revelation it must be by divine vindication as well is that right it's a sign that God gives his chosen people to receive that sign is to be finished with the world and the things of the world it is in another place of the scripture and I'm just moving along it is in another place of the scripture once again it speaks of it is the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts the earnest meaning that is the money that is the downpayment to show that there is a full payment to be made amen the transformation of our soul the very the very new birth itself the baptism of the Holy Ghost all one in the same all right there within our lives it is that which brings the witness and the groaning within our life to be clothed upon not that we should not be clothed but we are longing for that house that is not made with hands but that which as Peter said is reserved in the heavens and we have received now on earth a wedding garment the divine invitation of the Holy Ghost than the entrance that's been ministered to us that we can stand there and say I waiting to receive my body hey man you know over and over when he sealed it you think sometimes how the experiences in our life how God takes us through experiences in our life and sometimes we wonder we may not even understand why we're in this experience we don't let me just say like this it ain't nothing about it maybe they feel spiritual brother branham worked in a railroad a railroad yard a rail yard he worked there for a period of time and what he watched was is those cars those cars had to be packed a certain way they had to have certain that they had the inspector would come along and he's the one that would inspect them cars the inspector would be the one to say this looks good right here well how did they know what would be good because the goodness of God lead us us come on somebody god don't leave you and I wondering like well I wonder what the Bible said the goodness of God leads us to repentance God leads us you understand and the inspector is the Sailor himself is the Lord Jesus is the Holy Ghost all one in the same you're with me now so is not it is not Deegan you don't got two different people you know like sometimes you can experience and work you got this one they got their mind this way and this one over here this way and you wonder you would think man if we can just get everybody together on the same page let me tell you something the same one who seals you is the same one that has dealt with your life in your heart all along whether he is over the Bible says in the book of Psalms he is over the work of his hands amen Paul picks it up there in the book of Ephesians we are his workmanship is that right soul in there has to come then a a sealing where the inspector looks at things and listen to me now that inspector knows that I've got to make sure that this is all tightly packed together because it's going to be a rough ride there's gonna be tests and trials that will literally shake your very insides there's gonna be tests and trials that would shake you to a place where you would say if that's the way it's going to be but there is a seal that'll hold you in the midst of that time when you could say I can't go on anymore but he says you didn't start this word you are my world and I finish all my words I have sealed you under the day of your Redemption draweth me to God I feel like running a little bit but I need to preach we're not just talking of somebody who's trying to make a little things to look good and get a promotion but you remember the greatest promotion that our Lord Jesus will have will be when he brings his bride in rapture and presents us unto himself a glorious church without spot wrinkle blemish or any such thing he has not left this to anybody else he said you are my responsibility I took the veil off your life it's on my shoulder the key of David I the mystery to your life I will not let you go talking about the seal now of the inspector it can't be loose can't be loose with bream said loose temper loose tongue loose talk about others dirty habits vile things vulgarity behind he can't seal it let me just say this to you like this there is transforming power in this word I don't have to go through the whole Bible to prove that you can look in the very first scriptures of Genesis 1 in the beginning God said he was it was an earth that had come under darkness and needed Redemption come on somebody it was void and darkness covered the deep well how did God address that situation God said and when God said the Spirit of God moved what did the Spirit of God do it moved to bring forth God's desire of what he had in his mind when he spoke that the darkness be pushed away that one is laying there might come forth this assignment what are you saying in layman's terms I'm saying as you receive the word you become the word how'd you let the word flow through you say how do I let it flow through you if it cut you say cut on Jesus cuz what's he doing he's cutting away everything that's not like him my flesh don't want to be cut off but my soul says Jesus cat away everything that needs to be cut away cuz I'd be honest with you I've found in my life where he dealing right now with some fine-tuned things he gets right down into the business on certain things and you know what within it various grace that he ministers to my heart I believe that he is able and I believe that within me is that overcoming power it's within you too brother it's in you too sister yes sir it's transforming power in the world alone that's why that the preach any other word will not produce the effect that God is calling for in this hour but God is ministering a word of acceptance an idiot's anointing our faith to believe the impossible it is anointing our eyes to be able to see ourselves as God sees us and not how we think of ourselves he does that work the Bible said what Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on her so it's to heed the voice of the Lord that's called you don't stop until you're safely in his arms remember who walk in the steps of the faith of Abraham the Bible said work out your own salvation with fear and trembling it's the cleansing of ourselves by the washing of water by the word that might seem kind of well I can't think of the word right now it might seem kind of you know contradictory and cleanse ourselves by the the water by the word well remember when to wash ourselves by the water the word the Prophet would pick it up an invisible Union and he would say that here has we come he said we can stand under that water and be washed by the water of the word brother let me tell you something what the washing of the water of the word does it bypasses your intellect it bypasses what you could put together or make sense of this word jesus said my words they are spirit and life and when that word is coming forth there are things that you may not even sense or feel that is actually being cast out right now and the word by your setting there agreeing with it it's giving the word preeminence and Dominion in your life and the scepter of the king is coming out on that pain that is there that is sought to trouble you the washing of water by the word it has within it rich inner to power glory oh I wish I could just preach this morning hallelujah because the Bible says you know even when you look and say well brother Sam a while like you harping on this and harping on that listen Heian harping on nothing but I will tell you a promise in God's Word the Bible said without holiness no man shall see God without holiness no man shall see God and I believe you in scripture here in the Bible it says in the Song of Solomon chapter eight verse six here is the bridegroom speaking to the bride set me as a seal upon that heart as a seal upon that arm in other words you're not just here upon your heart but let me be the strength of your life for love is as strong as death I hate to admit this Joss but it's the truth I look back you know online on my own computer at home and I'm there studying of the day brother Aaron sometimes here I'll come back in and I'll walk back in and a day or in the evening with me you know at different times I take a little get a cup of coffee I'll walk back in and I see pictures family pictures come up and pictures come up of some of you all too and some of y'all don't look the same as you did two years ago you said what are you saying death is working in us do you feel it every day well you might you know you look at this year and think man I feel differently I did last year this time but see you didn't fill it every day in every moment what was happening death is just taking over that's what the love of God does in a life it takes over love is as strong as death the Bible goes on to say in verse 7 many waters cannot quench love they try to get in that art but they can't get a tact they can't quench love neither can the floods drown it flags are gonna come waters travels try to quench it but who shall separate us from the love of God Joel would be the dog certainly notice the request set me as a seal on your heart he's telling her let me let me seal the womb that nothing else can come in let me seal it with my life let me put my seal upon it glory to God you know the Bible says I'm trying to get somewhere here amen you know the Bible tells us here that in the Book of Revelations that the seal of God it tells us that the seal of God that that seal is also it's also the it's to have the name of God you believe that now if you look here in in saw in Revelation 7 now this is speaking of 144,000 I don't have time to preach this now but but it's speaking of the 144,000 and how that they will be sealed talking about the Jews come on did you see the same Holy Ghost that you and I are receiving that is what the Jews were to receive and the Jews receive that God gave them a space of grace after they had rejected the Messiah you read in the book of Acts they went and here it was it started in Jerusalem why because God had made a promise and Jesus Christ is the minister of how the truth of the circumcision to that of the Covenant to the circumcision and it started there in Jerusalem remember God's promise in Ezekiel 9 you see how the scriptures all the prophecy it ties together in Ezekiel 9 it was a judgment that was coming and the seal of God was to be administered he did not tell them go out there into the streets he said I want you to start marking people in my sanctuary judgment is to be come there now remember there was judgment that come but before judgment come mercy came and the mercy of God ministered the seal of God God will not God will not judge the righteous with the unrighteous look how many scriptures that go all the way through that he couldn't even pour his judgment out upon solemn lot was down there God knew he was down there but he needed somebody to request prayer for him and Abraham had a desire he said aloud here for him started real big he narrowed it down Abraham knew Abraham listen to me Abraham's prayer went and shots in the dark he knew who he was praying for this is part of my family better this was a pair of a righteous men throw a beat of God he was standing there you know what Abraham was praying that prayer of faith because Abraham had a seal about his life he had a token that he could present with his prayer and God said that's just what I was thinking you with me so many times we talked about how to move this tree over here and Adam did this and denom did this and God said well that's just what I would have done Adam dramatizing it oh that that's just exactly what I would have called the giraffe that's exactly what that's exactly right and how many times God will say thank you for bringing that name before me a prayer he couldn't meet your need and my need without anybody else praying but God is interested that all the glory goes to him he'll bring a name to your heart and the name to your heart it'll be the Spirit of God that will move in your life to break forth an intersession for somebody else whoo glory hallelujah thank God for me it's a privilege to be a believer priest Alleluia to God amen to bring those requests you know just don't wait till well you know it ain't my prayer time that come to your heart you pray right there it doesn't matter if you're getting the mashed potatoes off the top shelf and target it stretch your heart say Lord John reach out there and touch the throne of God right there come on somebody the Bible said I would that you were praying always blessed be the name of the Lord hmm the name of God here it is they are a seal there in in the book of Revelation notice now in that same chapter revelation 7 I just got a skip reveling over of Revelations 14 1 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion this is after Melinda this is this is here you know here we stand in mountains there they stand on my design this is millennium time right here this is after Armageddon you understand God already sees this as a finished work and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him and hundred and forty-four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads they haven't received his name as of yet but they will receive his name what will be the receiving of his name the receiving of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seal of God because the fountain will be open in the house of David hallelujah and that cleansing and ministry it'll call them Jews to repentance brother it'll call them to repentance they will repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they will receive that same Holy Ghost that you and I have received and God knows each and every one of them he knows exactly where they're at and they will have their father's name written in their foreheads it will not be a red dot it will not be a stamp kapuna this is symbols I said it's symbols it's speaking of they will have the mind of Christ they will have the seal of God of the Living God upon their hearts when the nations are coming against them and they surround them and they take after him rather they'll have a peace in their heart what you do that passes all understanding hallelu and you see receiving the holy ghost makes way for them to recognize him when he comes to make himself known to his brethren that's why the seal of the Holy Ghost must be ministered in this time because we aren't expecting there's a literal Jesus who will come [Music] he's got the provided wedding garment he's got the ring he's got the shoes and he's got the provided meeting place where we are to meet him first asourian's for we shall meet him in the air having the name of God you see this same sealing angel that's talked about in Revelation 7 that same sealing angels the Holy Ghost a man clothed in fine linen you are clothed with the same garment he is crawled with the same seal of the Holy Ghost upon this message in this hour is the same garment that comes upon you what was on Elijah comes up on Elijah [Applause] whew growing amen it comes to the prodigal and the father tells the servants go get the best robe the best robe is the father's robe a church Road won't do it but it's the best room what is it it is the road of the Holy Ghost the seal it is the coat the Covenant of many colors God's chosen one God said you are always in my covenant now I'm confirming it to you oh he's just your pick daddy no he says I love all of you but this is where my covenant is tied up oh lord have mercy my covenant is tied up here God is tied in a covenant with Israel as is identified there in the scripture huh Oh Marty I don't know what to say I y'all forgive me for acting crazy but I hope I'm not I just having a good time this same seal the 144,000 are getting ready to receive their baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why I say to you now there's not another message there's not another day this is the day amen oh yes sir this is what God would tell him in Deuteronomy 28 he would tell him that the rest of the nations he said I'm gonna set you on high above all the rest of the nations remember how they get set on high by getting low they humbled themselves to the Word of God and God said in humility there is power he said I will lift you up in verse 10 and all the people of the earth shall see that thou are called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of thee brother the devil ain't afraid of me but he's afraid of the Angel of the covenant and we have the seal of the angel the Covenant he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you know my presence is always with you whether so ever thou goest do not be dismayed do not be afraid but be of a good courage and a good strength and they shall see the name of the Lord is upon you and shall be afraid I felt like just having a little [Applause] rather than I'm called this token the seal of God in the message desperation he said this is the capping of my message the capping of my message you see it's an abiding presence it's a seal let me just talk about that seal for a moment but the semi you've been high nobody we just want to talk a little bit more let's talk about it brother Aaron for security it's a security when he puts his seal on your life he's letting the devil know this is private property you once lived here but this ain't your house no more let me tell you what the Holy Ghost does it does just what Nehemiah did in the days of the ruther Sabbath that was going on when they returned back to Jerusalem they had a bunch of people that was wanting to come into the city and be selling fish and everything else and Nehemiah said I don't know none of that stuff going on in this city I want you to close the gates so they closed the gates and they shut the locks the bars the doors they did all that brother George then they come back around and they came by the outside of the wall Nehemiah said I'm gonna tell you one more time I don't want you in this city you're not coming here on the Sabbath and don't you be near the city if I find you near the city will kill ya what's God saying don't you touch don't you touch that which I sealed you touch and you pepper that what I sealed you got me on your hands let me tell you how secure this is he let this pass through seminaries he'd let this pass through a lot of people's hands he let it pass through they tried to burn it out they tried to burn men they try to do ever say but brother you can't kill the Word of God [Applause] they might have put all sorts of things on it but brother God has watched over his word when men have wanted to auction it off for a penny here or for immorality there and auction it off but the Living God comes around in this hour and he takes this promise of God's Word he begins to take the rosin bowl of the Holy Ghost the predestination of this hour and it strikes the court and you realize it's priceless it's priceless [Applause] the way it was in the hands of many and they were trying to look at it trying to read it the devil trying to pry into it well Joe here was the word stainer staring right in the face the words were right there but brother and he couldn't get into it he couldn't get into it this book the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah believe it's Isaiah 29 it's like that of a book that you deliver to a learned man or to a nun word and the unlearned said I can't read it cuz I'm not learned they delivered the book the Bible says into the hands of a learned and a learned man said I cannot read this book for the words of this book are the words of a book that is sealed he told Daniel in the Book of Daniel when Daniel have received their from Gabriel he had received that ministry from Gabriel that would pertain to the restoration of the Jews he told Daniel seal it up until the time of the end and when it's time when the seal is unfolded then understanding will come whether there's been a seal upon this book it's not a seal of a man it's not a sale of a seminary it's the seal of the Living God and God said it's sealed up until my people that are knighted for it in this hour and all day to receive this then I will tear the seals home and brother Dave when he toured the seals off this but the Greg he took the seals off our lives now we wonder why we were the odd bird wild chicken feed wasn't good enough for us something within is calling for fresh meat it was a deep calling to the deep hey man talking about security that's how secure the seal of the Holy Ghost is upon your life let me just refer to it the Bible says in first chronicles 16 the Bible says in verse 20 when they went from nation in a nation from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm glory be to God it's our assurance it's our protection that's what this seal is it is that when you go into battle and you're looking at a situation David did not look at how big the giant was David said he's uncircumcised David hound the owner gonna pierce that on their armor he's uncircumcised David knew that the Lord was his shrift the Lord is my light I will not be afraid no Hosts shall encompass me it des will have be confident glory be to God hallelujah David looked at that Philistine and said he's uncircumcised the rest and we're looking at the armor they were looking at everything else you see sometimes the problem that you're looking at in your natural eyes and your feelings it's all the armor and the size of it but if you can only look at it it's an uncircumcised philistine that standing there and God is on your side the seal of the Holy Ghost let me just try to bring this part of it down to a close I want you to think of this the sign of the circumcision was a sign that was given personally on the eighth day wherein every male child had to be taken and circumcised as a covenant sign the women were brought into the Covenant by the marriage Union to the male who had been circumcised this is why Christ here he releases his own life into you and I that we become identified in him in a covenant marriage and we are under the circumcision that is made without hands it is the Holy Ghost that has circumcised our heart to lay aside the surplus flesh even know if this eternal life is our inheritance we've got to be married to the man Christ Jesus in order to come into our inheritance is that right Boaz had to bring in Ruth Simone had to bring in Rahab it had to be those of the tribe to bring in two daughters of Zelophehad are you with me it had to be that to bring it in to the inheritance so this sign was a sign of confirmation I want you to just listen listen to me now here they they believe what God had said now even though this was a sign in their flesh once you think of this now I know I'm in a mixed audience but I want you to think of this the sign of circumcision was in their flesh yet it was hidden to the rest of the world they had clothes on is that right so it was hidden but yet it was evident to them they're abiding presence of the Lord was with them the sign and the seal is not so much for everybody else it's for you and for me it's that comforting presence even when I don't feel it yeah yeah I'm getting somewhere it was evident it is the same seal of God that comes on the circumcision of the heart of the believer made without hands it's a supernatural power of God that actually removes the first nature of the body of the sins of the flesh and removes that old nature and sets forth the new nature by the quickening power of God in the soul when that has fully taken place in the heart of man by the Holy Ghost the person walks with the faith of God you realize it is God's faith operating through you to believe what he has said concerning this power and you and me in it hallelujah glory be to God in the highest and there are fruits of the Spirit in our life we are fully in the Covenant the Word of God for our day because it's the gospel of our salvation the Lord has sealed his message and messenger with his seal his presence and he seals us by himself placing that seal of the Holy Ghost the light of the hour the vindicated truth the Living God is now living out vindicated truth through our lives it is caught hiding and revealing himself in simplicity it's a security the devil can look on that seal but he can't come to it brother bream says he can tease at it he can buzz at it and fuss at it well he ain't gonna remove the seal no he's just trying to trouble you but he can't get to it because there's a seal of God that forbids him to touch it it's God's private property and that's what makes a man walk boldly you understand what I'm saying it is that on the inside that the rest of the world like the sign of circumcision among the Israelites it was not out there for everybody else to see but it was something that they knew in their heart I'm not the same that I used to be I know that there is an effect that has come to my life the love of the world is gone my love is to the Lord Jesus Christ the rest of the world they get glimpses of it but rather it's important for you when you're in battle the devil might have come and try to whisper everything your way there's promises he's tried to take from you but you can spend like Shamgar and realize you've got a covenant you've got a sign of circumcision you've got a seal of the Living God that's there you can rise up and you can take one promise and beat the devil's brains out with it hey man Shamgar seen an ox cold it's one little itty bitty scripture but brother his faith in what God had confirmed in his life he knew even though I don't feel his presence but I know that I've been anointed by God I am an Israelite I am a son of Abraham I am a child of Abraham and the promises belong to me you're outnumbered Shamgar but there's more with me then there is against me because if God be for us who can be against us is that right brother Ram comes running around right after he preaches is it's the rising of the Sun now after I've done all that apologizing I certainly don't want to go ahead and do a replay and keep you another two hours but I'm coming down you're sealed unto the day of redemption sometimes it's a shaky ride these incoming look like that car will ever make it sealed yet yes from eternity to eternity whose names on the line whose names on the seal he got the Lord God on money by coming down and imparting his own life into you and hi brother it is the strength of the RAM that has now been inter woven in our lives like the RAM that was caught in the thicket there it is that Rama how we gonna make it out of here by the Rama how am I gonna overcome battle realm Amen what has led me to the realm the work that he done on me in the inside it has led me to this mountain right now I see that Ram how is this raps are gonna come it's gonna come by the RAM his strength he was caught by his shrimp hallelujah what was that Ram doing on that mountain God let you and I see what was squirrel's doing where they shouldn't be I'll tell you we are ordained for this mountain of the rapture Mount Zion belongs to us hello somebody Mount Zion belongs to us we've had on Mount Carmel it comes a Mount Zion it's the final showdown to the rapture we receive the kingdom which cannot be moved here is 12 everything else is being shaken it's shaken but brother he has packed himself into you and I it is him that is holding you and I you might feel like you're gonna come to pieces but remember you have been pied back in to the mind of God the seal of God ties you back in [Music] and let me tell you the words that was spoke right after it is the rising of the Sun he said now oh boy I don't feel bad now he said I apologize for that long message but I said I wanted to get that message true that you're part of this resurrection and don't you worry about it no more just rejoice over it there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it nothing eternally secured in the kingdom of God when God has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of your destination he said when that government puts a seal upon a package the railroad puts a seal on the door that car cannot be tampered with until it's reached its destination when God puts his seal upon a man and that seal is the Holy Ghost when he seals a man like that he's gone to his eternal destination never no more can he ever come back any more he quotes the food Ephesians 4:30 yes grieve not the Holy Spirit of God we're about your seal for all times he said now listen now the devil will punch at you and he'll say everything to you and accuse you and try to make you think that you're not but don't you listen to him [Applause] how am I gonna believe that we're better Samuel the devil telling me you know he said why are you leaving arguing with a defeated being he's a liar you understand where you're standing right now you've got a seal a sign a circumcision that's greater than even what they had in their flesh it has come to your soul and you know you have passed from death unto life [Applause] can I keep reading thank you I'm gonna keep reading this same quote he said but don't you listen to him you know you passed from death unto life you know the things that you once loved you don't love it no more you know you believed every word of God you've seen God working right among us infallible proofs that he is the great I am oh my he goes on in the message desperations after he has preached the message the token and it goes on and he says now he said without this token remember what the token is it is the life of Jesus Christ reproduced inside the believer hallelujah haha man oh man oh man I pray that the preaching of this word right here if you don't have that seal of the Holy Ghost I pray you so hungry for it I pray you say you know what I want that I need that brother and sister let me tell you without the seal of God you're not going in the rapture if you're not born again you're not going in the rapture and if you sit here in these services where the inspector is inspecting your life you say I felt the presence of God but let me tell you something if a tree falls over in the water it when it stands in the ground it's such water up and it's benefited but if that tree lays in the water the same water that could produce and Minister's strength to it will actually cause it to rot that's why the Bible could say in Hebrews four do not do this spot to the spirit of grace the inspector coming around and dealing with your heart upon this and saying hey you're a little loose on this and hey on this and hound that it's time to be serious the Bible calls it diligence with the things of God is to be diligent when the Holy Ghost is speaking to you and I because let me tell you something to turn it down and to reject it is to be a sentence to hell strong language but it's the truth you say I believe in God them it updates you on the scripture the Bible says in the book of James that death will be leaves and he trembles it's got to be more than just believing in God come on somebody that's what's the matter with this whole world it's Satan's religion live any way you want to live do whatever you want to do as long as you love God that is a delusion this world is under the spirit of a delusion because they received not the love of the truth and the love of the truth first asourian's to the love of the truth is the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ you can't say you love God and then reject his word when you reject his word God marks you as an enemy you don't have to be that this morning let me just tell you something the blood of Jesus can do for you what the blood of Abel could not do for Cain the blood of Abel could never take Cain and transform him but the blood of Jesus can take you old Cain come on I'm quoting the words from the message token he can take an old Cain because remember yeah he'll now outside is the King but on the inside is enabled and that Abel is Abel when Abel comes into it when the Holy Ghost comes on the inside then I am able I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me Abel is a [Applause] this old king this old sticky thing but they Gable on the inside says I've received the ability Amen I have come face-to-face with him like John did on the Isle of Patmos and love courage and ability has been ministered unto me I have seen his face his presence personally and I have been identified with him I am yoked with him and I believe that he is the performer of what he said gotta have that token you know when you go on an airline show up at the gate how many non talked about you flew somewhere before I don't care how much money there you go to the ticket you go right there to the gate they ain't dealing with that they want to know do you got the token well you know I'm just waiting don't be on standby you see here on standby just ruling pretty soon you'll be singing now what am I gonna do that the church is gone and I'm left sitting all alone don't be there like that take the grace of God God's grace and mercy to minister brother BAM after he talks about this token in the opening part of desperation he said now he says once that blood is applied to you and you're accepted oh my he says now now not just to know certain evidence you say brother Branham he said I feel it in your minds why will I know in other words how will I know he said look what were you and what are you you with me look to you it's a sign sometimes it's a whole lot easier for other people to look at you and they see the change in your life let me tell you something you don't go by reasoning you go by this sign that he's put on brother he didn't put that seal on your reasoning he put it on your soul look what you were and what you are there is how you know what was you before this token was applied what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after then you know whether the tokens applied and all these other things well they just go automatically with it it's the seal of the Holy Ghost the scripture said don't grieve it we've grieved it no dream would say it like this he said I want to be so sensitive till I will know the least little thing that displeases him but remember when he's grieved that little Dell flies up on the rafter but all that you have to do is become a lamb again in the death comes right back sometimes you know you might get all vexed and tied up with the situation frustrated you might feel you've got a right to be and maybe you do but that little devil on the inside says aren't you glad he let you know you said but there on the dam if there's something on the inside you know you ain't gonna argue it away but it's something inside you said Lord forgive me forgive me Lord a man like David would say create in me a right spirit Lord let me tell you what the real seal of God does you recognize that there is a fountain filled with blood you know that there's a washing of water by the word and you realize that there is that Laver that is set for you in the house of God with running water it comes out the bottom it's running water where you can wash your hands your doings and you can wash your feet your goings sometimes it's not even you need to be washed because of something you've done or you've said sometimes you've just been in situations that you just feel dirty because of where you've been if I know I'm talking about but thank God there is a Laver you can go and say Lord Jesus cleanse me the Lord cleanse me Lord and you washing your feet right there what are you getting ready for you're getting ready to enter into worship because your whole desire is to please him oh how much greater is this sealing than what they had received in their flesh this seal of God upon our heart our soul it's something that it remains right there that we know we have passed from death unto life I'm not who I used to be I didn't change my life he changed my life you understand me now you can sit down I just feel to go with this you're not Center and look at it and maybe it'd be like sister Bruce where sister Bruce said brother branham hi I don't have like a a certain place I can put my foot that I've received the Holy Ghost and brother banner takes her right to the word and he said sister Bruce he said normally he said a person would be just like this and he goes through he says but you're not he says what happened well what changed you she said Christ he said there it is you see you want your foot upon the word of God so your foot stands right there first one person it might take one person and they go through on their journey and this person here it is like in a moment of time God comes down and does everything right then and there but brother it is the same experience you are passing from death unto life and how you know is by the seal in your soul and that seal in the soul is his name it's the name of Jesus Christ hmm that is just like evening there just like him mm-hmm because it's the family name jesus said I've come in my father's name and we have come in our father's name we have come felt in the name of the Word of God he said his name is called the Word of God he said in John 14 he will send the Holy Ghost in my name we are brought forth by the manifestation of Jesus Christ his children do you love him I pray this morning you'll stand like Shamgar stand like David and I pray this morning if you don't have that I pray that you'll just stand still within your heart and say I'm the son of Abraham I'm a daughter of Abraham and I claim that promise these are the rights and the inheritance that's being ministered to me it belongs to me as a children of God I believe that it is for me I believe that I am justified in the sight of Almighty God I believe that he rose from the grave I believe that he died for my sins rose again on the third day he is my Savior here's my Sanctifier he is my redeemer he is my all and all turn your eyes upon Jesus when Satan wants to try to get you put your eyes and turn your eyes on Jesus the Prophet said that right there in that quote look at what you were look at what you are now you know it's important look at where you were look at where you are I've never seen a tree growing in your yard a bush or something when you're out there you don't go and look at it and say honey it grew a millimeter today but what you do is you keep watering it you keep nurturing it you clip back blooms or whatever has to be clipped back at a certain time and you keep nurturing you caught you cultivate the soil around it you take a picture of that then you come again next year come again the year after that then you look at what you see there compared to what you've come from you're looking at it everyday you don't see growth but you give some little distance you can look and say I look what I was but I look at what I am now this is what I am this is why God would tell them in the book of Deuteronomy remember remember don't you love him let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer or Jesus you're the same God this morning father you're the one Lord who inspects us you're the one Lord who seals us and Lord we just pray this morning that how you have sent your word and what I I tried to minister it Lord I never just in anything I never want anything to be complicated Lord wanted to be simple Lord I know that it takes you as simple as I could try to be but yet it takes it takes you Lord to break it to our hearts Lord I pray but out of it all Lord God if there's none a heart Lord that has been sealed I pray God that they would be so so hungry may they be so thirsty may they not rest day or night until Lord God they've received that satisfying portion and may they Lord believe recognize it's for him may they recognize you desire to give it to a more than they would desire to receive lord in faith we want to believe to receive it to act upon that word Lord I pray reach life that's here I know Lord I'm speaking to lives as well the God that has been sealed by the Holy Spirit pass from death unto life god they have that sign that seal on the inside of their soul lord like every one of us Lord at times we say it shamefully we've grieved you there's been things Lord even how your prophet would he would tell us this and we experienced it that God he would even tell us in the simplicity to where when you even get a thought a thought about getting even a fault not even saying anything then you entertain that foggy said the Dove takes flight lordy would let us know that even our thinking let alone our words Lord I pray this morning if there's any any faults Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart Lord if there be any faults that's contrary to the nature of God in our soul what I I ask what God that is your conviction of the holy spirit and we thank you for that conviction Lord I pray God that is every heart is sincere Lord God would call sin sin that you call CN Lord and stand upon that word say Lord forgive me Lord cleanse me forgive me Lord for taking that attitude or that falter speaking sharply that way Oh Lord granted I pray may you just move Lord upon that heart god you're so merciful you would tell us to grieve not that Holy Spirit of promise nor the desire that pulsates within our heart we want to please you help us Lord no wonder Jude would tell us keep yourselves in the love of God praying in the Holy Ghost Lord God we need a continual renewal we need a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost a renewing Lord God and I pray Heavenly Father may this morning God every heart just just be open Lord to receive that Lord if there's one that God would fill on their heart Lord to come in to pray here Lord I know that God you could done the work right there in the seat and I just relieve it in your hands because Lord we know whether they're in their seat or whether they come here to the altar they their faith has got to be in you Lord whether it's for healing whether it's for deliverance whether the Lord God is for the Holy Ghost the Lord I believe this morning that while we have the devil on the run I believe God it's time to take care of business so Lord may there not be one heart that's left outside of him under the blood may every life what I pray be drawn to you Lord in the simplicity and may God the hearts that Lord have been focused on the devil's teasing his buzzing is fussing at the ceiling I pray God that they recognize that they're not standing on their reason but may they stand up this morning in their heart like Shamgar stew that moment may they take that ox gold and their God may they drive back that devil nor they've been trying to torment their mind and their spirit Lord in trouble granite Lord God for their anointed Lord with your Holy Spirit Lord chase back Lord God the enemy try him out under landlord go in the name of Jesus Christ we have a covenant promise amen and amen hallelujah amen amen knowing that I would just didn't monitor don't let any of these moments pass you by but just let it wherever you're at just soak it in just soak it in take it in into your heart see God changing me Lord change me you know after God came down on Mount Carmel that day after God came and vindicated the sacrifice after that was all said and done Elijah said and these prophets of bail he said take every one of them and kill them you see new after God had already vindicated it courage rises in the hearts of the people don't let no profits or bail go back home with you cut them down right now you've been given authority the Word of God said cut them down you believe that he's vindicated his word
