[33:44] Lord and you know what the truth of the
[33:58] matter is is that he's never had a new
[34:03] thought concerning your eye
[34:06] he's never loved us anymore his love has
[34:12] always been the same you say well even
[34:15] when I was in the condition that I was
[34:18] in he still loved you but it's when in
[34:24] that time that finally through his
[34:28] drawing and our yielding that love takes
[34:31] control it's manifested in our lives and
[34:35] it overwhelms us no wonders Solomon
[34:39] could say in the book of Song of Solomon
[34:42] love is as strong as death many times
[34:47] you're her brother brems say try to do
[34:50] something to a dead person you won't get
[34:53] nothing out of that and he likens that
[34:56] to that of the love of God it's taken
[35:00] hold in our hearts the Holy Spirit we
[35:02] now are dead to the world to ourselves
[35:08] but we've been raised in the newness of
[35:12] life in Christ and aren't you glad that
[35:14] this same life the love of God in our
[35:16] hearts it's overcoming it's subduing day
[35:20] by day moment by moment just like when
[35:24] we look around here we can look at
[35:26] pictures of ourselves we see we've
[35:29] changed death itself just day by day
[35:32] moment by moment we see art we see a
[35:33] change but how much greater and how much
[35:38] more real and true is the love of God
[35:41] changing us transforming us pushing his
[35:44] way moving in our life as we're yielding
[35:47] he's grown greater and
[35:52] I'm so glad about that tonight aren't
[35:54] you aren't you glad to be here
[35:59] praise the name of the Lord let's just
[36:02] turn in the word if we could here to
[36:05] Exodus chapter 15 and read just a few
[36:11] verses of scripture tonight

[36:28] here out of Exodus 15 then sing Moses

[37:49] God just as you looked upon the
[37:51] multitude that day and saw that they
[37:54] were in need physically to be fed they
[37:56] were hungry and you would not send them

[38:54] just ask that you'll just take control
[38:56] in the further part of the service in
[38:58] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[39:01] and then God blesses your being seated I
[39:06] want to I want to draw your attention
[39:08] back to that of verse two and just
[39:13] really speak from there tonight when we
[39:18] look at this in Exodus 15 here the first
[39:24] the first part of their journey and God
[39:28] bringing them to a place remember God's
[39:30] the goal that God has even in leading
[39:34] them this way is to bring them to a
[39:37] place that their faith would continue to
[39:40] increase until the time when they are
[39:43] there at kadish and and preparing to
[39:47] cross Jordan that was the point of all
[39:49] of these stopping places along the way
[39:53] and the Red Sea was was very much a part
[39:58] of God's desire that he would make known
[40:01] his power in Redemption that God himself
[40:05] coming on the scene to manifest that not
[40:09] only he's a healer
[40:11] he's a deliverer that he's more mighty
[40:15] than what the mightiest army is upon
[40:18] this earth he's more mighty he's more
[40:21] mighty when we look at this and see it
[40:23] applied that he's greater than than any
[40:26] any devil any demon spirit any anything
[40:30] at all God is greater and so when we
[40:33] look at in the midst of this here day of
[40:35] Moses is moved by the Spirit of God and
[40:38] it begins to utter forth as he entered
[40:42] into the spirit as he begin to look
[40:44] brother brems says he looked and seen
[40:47] what was on the banks of the Red Sea and
[40:49] Moses got in the spirit when he
[40:52] all those dead Egyptians on there and he
[40:55] said Moses begin to sing a song when we
[40:59] realized this that this was not a
[41:01] previous song there no doubt were songs
[41:04] that they had sung but this song was was
[41:08] that of an inspiration of the experience
[41:11] of how God had revealed himself to
[41:14] Israel in the midst of this time and
[41:17] when you look at this this here the Lord
[41:20] is my strength and song and I want to
[41:22] speak on that thought for a few moments
[41:24] the Lord is my song because when you
[41:27] look at this word song here in the
[41:30] Hebrew that's used specifically here it
[41:32] deals with that of a melody so when you
[41:36] look at it it's not just the Lord he's
[41:38] in my song no he is my song he is my
[41:44] song there's no guesswork this song the
[41:48] main theme it's him and he is my song so
[41:52] it's not he's not just interjected every
[41:54] once in a while to make it feel like but
[41:57] he is my song and so when we look at
[42:00] this in the scriptures we realize that
[42:02] songs itself is not just in that of
[42:06] songs where notes
[42:08] and pitch and tone and harmony and all
[42:10] those things brought together but it
[42:12] also deals with a melody that God would
[42:16] place within the heart of our lives to
[42:19] where things themselves that would be a
[42:22] disconnected like notes you could have
[42:24] somebody in common you know maybe me and
[42:27] maybe some of the rest of us in your
[42:28] week might be able to pick out mary had
[42:30] a little lamb on this piano here but you
[42:33] know and you know how it is you pick out
[42:35] little songs you can put pluck notes and
[42:37] things like that but really that in
[42:39] itself and I don't mean to throw off on
[42:42] anybody if you're in piano lessons and
[42:43] that's all you know right now but I want
[42:46] to just say it like this that's in a
[42:47] sense it just plucking out notes but you
[42:50] know when you when you're able to move
[42:52] that and bring notes together and you
[42:55] know when you look at notes on a sheet
[42:57] music where or you know has it used to
[42:59] be in hymns you don't always see notes
[43:02] that are up here at the top of the of
[43:05] of the actual measure you or you see
[43:07] notes that they're up here sometimes
[43:09] notes come down and notes sometimes are
[43:12] beneath the measure of the line the bar
[43:14] lines then they come in the middle then
[43:15] they rise up you know what because you
[43:17] and me in our lives sometimes the notes
[43:20] go down sometimes the notes go up it's
[43:23] all part of how that within our life
[43:25] there's tests
[43:26] there's trials there's high moments
[43:28] there's low moments and yet within at
[43:30] all it's all part of the melody that God
[43:34] has to play out because when everything
[43:36] out of our life has a believer the
[43:39] melody itself is the Lord when it all
[43:43] comes down to it everything that we're
[43:45] we can say praise God I've overcome
[43:48] right here it's the Lord when we can
[43:50] look at it and say my I'm grateful for
[43:54] His mercy that bringing me through this
[43:56] test and trial it's been the Lord so
[43:59] when we look at it then we and ourselves
[44:02] have that true reality that as Paul
[44:05] could say Christ who is our life he is
[44:08] the melody of our life
[44:10] he is our song it's him that brings
[44:13] everything together and it's him that's
[44:16] the one that's highlighted in our life
[44:18] so I look at this within a song as we
[44:21] were kind of you know looking at some of
[44:22] this last week and you know we recognize
[44:25] that how that inspiration just like it
[44:28] did for Moses here there will be that of
[44:31] older songs that God will make known and
[44:35] more personally have more understanding
[44:36] than what it was years before even to
[44:40] those who wrote it as authors but yet
[44:43] then you'll find that inspiration itself
[44:45] will drop in an hour when God Himself is
[44:48] doing something and declaring something
[44:51] and I know sometimes you can look and
[44:53] you can think about different ones
[44:54] believers who have wrote songs and
[44:56] different you know assemblies and
[44:58] different ones that have wrote
[44:59] absolutely beautiful songs of what God
[45:01] has done in this hour the reality is
[45:04] that with some of those you can never
[45:06] sing them in any denominational churches
[45:08] whatsoever they would simply look at you
[45:10] and say what in the world are you
[45:12] talking about what are these things that
[45:14] you're speaking about and yet there are
[45:15] some
[45:16] that have been wrote that you know you
[45:17] could sing across within any of the
[45:20] denominations you know I never forget
[45:22] some of you were there when we were over
[45:23] here on route Road at that Baptist
[45:25] Church there and and the brother that's
[45:28] that's been there I had lunch with him
[45:29] here about a year ago or so and and when
[45:32] we were over there and brother Paul and
[45:34] sister sharing different ones and Lafon
[45:36] things they were singing songs because
[45:38] they had invited him there and the man
[45:40] had known them you know from singing and
[45:41] so forth and many of you can remember
[45:43] there that day on that dinner when we
[45:45] were there and brother Paul and sister
[45:47] sherry brother Isaac and they begin to
[45:50] sing he's the same God that's living in
[45:53] me and you know in the middle of that
[45:55] church right there I tell you the
[45:56] presence of God came down and you know
[45:59] it might have been a Baptist Church but
[46:01] they had a Pentecostal bully in there so
[46:03] I just had to stand in worship when
[46:05] there when the power of God not
[46:06] Pentecost my organization you you
[46:08] understand it's a joy in my heart I just
[46:10] couldn't contain it I've done the same
[46:12] thing when I went to other concerts as
[46:14] well it's just something about it now
[46:16] you know don't get down on me because
[46:18] that's the way that I respond I'm not
[46:20] looking down on you but I remember when
[46:22] the presence of God just come right in
[46:24] there when that song was being sung it's
[46:27] almost like the people they didn't even
[46:28] know what to do they didn't even know
[46:30] what had struck there but the power of
[46:32] God the Spirit of the Lord had so moved
[46:34] within that place in that time so we can
[46:37] look at inspiration is given within a
[46:39] period of time and it's all it's all
[46:41] given to that of the Lord and when you
[46:43] look at it in terms of songs you know as
[46:45] we said last week we don't want to be
[46:47] dogmatic with anything because the
[46:49] Prophet himself when you watch how the
[46:51] prophets approach with things the
[46:53] Prophet himself he stood on the word but
[46:56] he was not dogmatic and so when we look
[46:58] at this if we many times we have to step
[47:00] back and may get the wide-angle lens and
[47:02] begin to look at things instead of
[47:04] sometimes honing in on such little
[47:06] things and then we we look at it but yet
[47:08] you have to get the big picture remember
[47:10] in this hour when we look at the message
[47:13] that God has given to us brother Branham
[47:15] himself was not the first one upon this
[47:17] earth that ever preached cerfancy it
[47:19] wasn't the first time that
[47:20] predestination was ever ministered did
[47:23] remember it was truths that were lost
[47:26] that the Apostles had a rigid
[47:29] the minister remember this city is
[47:32] founded upon that of the 12 apostles you
[47:35] have the 12 patriarchs
[47:36] so it's not a new doctrine the message
[47:38] itself is oh it's something new no it's
[47:41] not brother BAM tells us if it's
[47:43] something other than what is already
[47:45] wrote here then it can't be right
[47:48] because John was told to seal up those
[47:51] things which you hear do not write them
[47:54] so it's not that of something that's
[47:56] adding to but my point is coming to it
[47:59] is that the ministry the message in this
[48:01] hour
[48:02] remember when Elijah went to the
[48:04] mountain there Elisha never picked or
[48:06] packed with him rocks up to this
[48:09] mountain he never you know packed so
[48:11] many rocks and said well I'm packing my
[48:13] own rocks to build the altar but
[48:15] remember when he got there he actually
[48:17] under the word of the Lord that was
[48:19] given to him he assembled what was there
[48:22] laying in disarray and it was an
[48:25] assembly of truths that had been
[48:28] scattered and when that assembly of
[48:31] truth was now brought back in order
[48:33] we now remember here brother Bantam
[48:35] never looked at it even though Calvin
[48:37] went so far off he never looked and said
[48:39] I'm not taking nothing from that man I'm
[48:41] not taking nothing from Calvin he didn't
[48:43] look at it that way brother Bantam knew
[48:45] that you don't get your eyes on an
[48:47] artist I mean or you don't get your eyes
[48:48] upon just something like that you get
[48:51] your eyes upon truth and so he was able
[48:53] to identify there is truth within what
[48:56] Calvin said there's truth and what our
[48:58] mean Ian said there's truth within those
[49:00] things and so it was the Holy Spirit
[49:03] identifying what its truth I say all of
[49:05] that to say this it's the same Holy
[49:08] Spirit that is here that helps you and I
[49:11] identify truth that is around this truth
[49:14] that is within songs truth that comes
[49:17] our way it must be the Holy Spirit I'm
[49:20] just reading here earlier today brother
[49:22] Branham talking about radio broadcasts
[49:24] of where he himself listened and
[49:26] listening to other ministers and brother
[49:28] band said you know what he said I was
[49:30] just listening to a radio broadcast here
[49:32] he said the other day he said in this
[49:34] attorney said something so profound and
[49:37] he said what it is he wondered why that
[49:39] those of the minister
[49:41] and layman why are they sitting around
[49:42] when the coming of the Lord is upon us
[49:45] you see what I mentioned within that the
[49:47] Prophet himself never purported himself
[49:50] as the only source of truth but he
[49:52] linked us identified us with the very
[49:54] person of truth and that is the Lord
[49:57] Jesus Christ we are people of truth
[49:59] we're not afraid we're not intimidated
[50:02] we're not fearful oh my goodness I I'm
[50:04] afraid I'll be deceit no sir the Holy
[50:06] Spirit operating in our life and we have
[50:09] been brought into a thinking man's
[50:10] filter so that we can pass the things
[50:13] through the word if it doesn't pass
[50:14] through the word song saying whatever if
[50:17] it doesn't make you through the word we
[50:19] don't want it it's enough for us because
[50:21] if it's not going to be edifying then we
[50:23] don't want that are you with me so when
[50:26] we look at this brother branham himself
[50:28] now here is a man that you each said
[50:31] that last week brother Branham he would
[50:33] tell brother Branham the phrase that you
[50:35] know about very well brother Branham you
[50:37] don't know your Bible real well blue
[50:40] gram said we'd if we differ in doctrine
[50:42] quite a bit and this man who brother
[50:45] Branham refers to in this that
[50:46] constantly tells him you don't got good
[50:48] grammar if you only knew the Greek
[50:49] that's brother booth-clibborn who
[50:51] brother Branham called his friend
[50:53] brother Graham called a dear friend and
[50:55] I make the point within it because
[50:57] booth-clibborn himself never from what I
[51:00] understand and read never came to the
[51:02] light of the messenger of the truth he
[51:05] passed away in 1969 in Oregon but yet
[51:08] booth-clibborn here he was able to come
[51:10] under the inspiration of Almighty God
[51:13] and write a song that brother Branham
[51:15] says is my favorite song probably most
[51:19] of you know what it is down from his
[51:21] glory and brother Branham many times
[51:23] different ones would sing it before he
[51:25] would come out to minister and this is
[51:27] just one of the times brother REM says
[51:29] my heart is thrilled that's my favorite
[51:31] song if you only knew the background for
[51:34] that song my friend composed that song
[51:36] booth-clibborn in a cornfield one night
[51:39] with his elbows out and on his knees out
[51:41] there in prayer God give him this song
[51:43] look what he says and I think it's a one
[51:46] of the matchless for this day notice its
[51:51] jailers it wasn't something that was
[51:53] just well it's gonna be all know it
[51:55] brings it up it's matchless for this day
[51:57] and brother brand goes on to say why
[51:59] when the deity of Jesus Christ is denied
[52:02] by so many formal believers that he was
[52:05] no more than just a man just a prophet
[52:07] he was Emmanuel so brother Branham we'll
[52:10] look at this song and say this song has
[52:13] such significance to me because it is a
[52:15] matchless one for this thing why because
[52:18] when Satan was working to challenge the
[52:22] very beauty of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[52:24] make him no more than all he was no more
[52:26] than just a prophet he was no more than
[52:27] just a man he was no more than just the
[52:29] second person in the Godhead but here
[52:31] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit would
[52:34] strike a man and brother Branham would
[52:36] speak of this over and over countlessly
[52:39] of how this song would meet and match
[52:41] the challenge of the age or day when it
[52:44] was coming against the very deity of the
[52:46] Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad that
[52:48] the Holy Spirit still inspires songs
[52:51] aren't you glad and the reality of it is
[52:54] that even though you may not be a singer
[52:57] but you still got us all and even though
[53:00] you might not be a songwriter
[53:02] there is still a song that has been
[53:03] wrote in your life and nobody can sing
[53:06] this song like you can somebody could
[53:09] try to sing it but they can't hit the
[53:11] notes like you can so when we look at
[53:14] this here notice how that David would
[53:16] would speak of this because we know that
[53:18] songs themselves they come from
[53:20] experience as songs are not just people
[53:22] sitting around and trying to come up
[53:24] with rhymes and or what word would go
[53:26] with this that you know there might be
[53:27] people that do that but songs that have
[53:30] a meaning for us that the Holy Spirit
[53:32] would press down upon they are from an
[53:34] experience that a person has been
[53:36] through in Psalms 28 verse 6 David said
[53:39] blessed be the Lord because he hath
[53:41] heard the voice of my supplications the
[53:44] Lord is my strength and my shield my
[53:47] heart trusted in him and I am helped
[53:50] therefore my heart greatly rejoices and
[53:53] with my song will I praise him now
[53:58] whether or not David has received at
[54:01] this point on
[54:02] song or not whatever song it was if it
[54:06] was a song that was already previous or
[54:08] it was new inspiration that was striking
[54:10] right then regardless it was his song I
[54:13] mean you know how it is you anybody else
[54:15] could come up here and the sole leader
[54:17] could sing on a hill far away stood an
[54:20] old rugged cross
[54:21] but in that service is just something
[54:23] about it that strikes your heart you
[54:25] said that's my song then they might be
[54:27] singing a special he thought I was worth
[54:29] saving and here they come to sing this
[54:31] song and you in the midst of that
[54:33] service it's something that it's just
[54:35] like this song it puts the very strings
[54:38] of my heart and you say that's my song I
[54:41] will greatly rejoice you see you are
[54:43] identifying with the words of a song
[54:46] it's just like how we identify with the
[54:48] word as it's coming forth in this hour
[54:50] we do not count it robbery to be greeted
[54:53] to be counted equal with God is that
[54:55] right we do not look and say why I
[54:57] shouldn't be the word no we say what he
[55:00] has said and once he's given us the word
[55:03] it's our word second samuel 22 verse 1
[55:09] David spake unto the Lord the words of
[55:11] this song in the day that the Lord had
[55:13] delivered him out of the hand of all his
[55:15] enemies and out of the hand of Saul and
[55:17] he said the Lord is my rock and my
[55:21] fortress and my deliverer the god of my
[55:26] rock in him will I trust he is my shield
[55:30] the Horn of my salvation my Hightower my
[55:33] refuge my Savior thou save us me from
[55:37] violence and I will call on the Lord who
[55:39] is worthy to be praised and so shall I
[55:42] be safe from mine enemies and David goes
[55:45] on boy what a long song but it is a song
[55:47] that's out of experience where David is
[55:53] singing the song now if you notice here
[55:55] in the book of Isaiah chapter 38 here is
[55:58] Hezekiah
[55:59] now remember Hezekiah God you know was
[56:01] was a pronouncing and had pronounced
[56:04] through the prophet Isaiah of where to
[56:06] set your house in order and prepare to
[56:08] die but how that the Hezekiah had turned
[56:11] his face remember to the Lord and he
[56:14] began to pour his heart out
[56:16] and before God Lord don't remove me
[56:17] until I've set my house in order
[56:19] lord give me an opportunity and so then
[56:22] we find that how that God sent the
[56:24] Prophet back with the word unto Him to
[56:26] let him know that God has indeed he's
[56:30] going to spare your life verse 17 look
[56:32] how Hezekiah speaks concerning this
[56:34] behold for peace
[56:36] I had great bitterness probably some
[56:41] maybe some of you were there tonight
[56:42] some of us have been there for peace
[56:44] I've had great bitterness but thou has
[56:46] in love to my soul delivered it from the
[56:51] pit of corruption for thou has cast all
[56:54] my sins behind my back
[56:59] [Applause]
[57:00] there's a song brewing here you're mine
[57:05] for the grave cannot praise thee death
[57:08] can not celebrate thee they that go down
[57:11] into the pit cannot hope for that truth
[57:13] the living the living he shall praise
[57:16] thee as I do this day the father to the
[57:19] children shall make known that truth the
[57:21] Lord was ready to save me therefore we
[57:25] will sing my songs to the stringed
[57:28] instruments all the days of our life in
[57:30] the house of the Lord now think of how
[57:34] Dave look how Hezekiah right sir we will
[57:36] sing my songs and remember Hezekiah
[57:39] worship had went to a mom in the
[57:42] tabernacle matter of fact the doors of
[57:44] the house of God had been closed but
[57:46] when Hezekiah came upon the throne then
[57:49] the doors of the tabernacle were opened
[57:51] they begin to move through the
[57:52] tabernacle and then worship itself was
[57:55] restored because Hezekiah realized it's
[57:58] not just enough to have the tabernacle
[58:00] open but David himself pointed singers
[58:03] with instruments and music that this
[58:06] itself would actually create that
[58:08] atmosphere he knew what warship was all
[58:11] about and sometimes you know how it is
[58:14] worship itself is not something that you
[58:16] just flip on like a switch worship
[58:19] itself is you must enter into it as a
[58:21] matter of fact brother Branham would put
[58:23] it like this
[58:23] he says you first have to get in the
[58:26] spirit and
[58:27] you get in the spirit then he says the
[58:30] Holy Ghost can heal you
[58:31] then the Holy Ghost can deliver you he
[58:34] said when you get in the spirit then he
[58:36] can fill you with the Holy Ghost
[58:38] but you see getting in the spirit is
[58:40] getting in the unction and the melody
[58:43] and harmony of the word to where that
[58:45] your soul is lining up with that word
[58:47] and then God is able to move and
[58:49] Hezekiah is identifying here that in his
[58:53] life at one time how his life was being
[58:55] lived to where that God who had become a
[58:59] secondary part of his life but in the
[59:02] midst of his life being taken away
[59:05] Hezekiah realizes that all these other
[59:07] things that I've allowed to put before
[59:10] him they're nothing for the rest of the
[59:13] days of my life Lord and because if I go
[59:16] to the grave I can't praise you in the
[59:18] grave but for the rest of my life Lord
[59:21] we're going to sing my songs with the
[59:23] instruments in the house of the Lord all
[59:26] the days of our life in other words
[59:29] Hezekiah said this song is on a
[59:31] continuous play there is not going to be
[59:35] a stopping of this song it's going to
[59:37] keep on moving because I cannot forget
[59:40] what mercy you have shown to me that you
[59:43] have raised me up and given me another
[59:46] opportunity I'm telling you here tonight
[59:50] you might hear you might not be really
[59:52] serving the Lord or even listening in
[59:54] but God gives you another opportunity
[59:56] and you and I could be sitting here
[59:58] tonight that how many times have we come
[1:00:01] up short but in His grace he gives us an
[1:00:04] opportunity he allows you an authorizer
[1:00:07] brother you talking about a song I'm
[1:00:10] telling you there's nobody that can give
[1:00:12] you a song like that except for the Lord
[1:00:15] Himself and it's not a little sad song
[1:00:18] but it comes out the Lord is my song
[1:00:21] because we know he's my Savior he's my
[1:00:24] deliverer
[1:00:25] he's my Redeemer David it goes on and
[1:00:30] says in Psalms 30 how will extol thee O
[1:00:34] Lord that word extol means to rise to
[1:00:38] put you high
[1:00:40] for thou has lifted me up and has not
[1:00:45] made my foes to rejoice over me o Lord
[1:00:50] my God I cried unto thee and thou has
[1:00:53] healed me O Lord thou has brought up my
[1:00:56] soul from the grave thou hast kept me
[1:00:58] alive
[1:00:59] that I should not go down to the pit
[1:01:01] sing unto the Lord o ye saints of his
[1:01:05] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[1:01:09] his holiness of what he alone can do
[1:01:18] right Billy Bama tell us like this in
[1:01:21] Mary's belief he says if we didn't have
[1:01:24] so many other things on our mind you
[1:01:26] know sometimes we'll come to church
[1:01:28] thinking about tomorrow I got to do this
[1:01:31] the next day I got to do this when we
[1:01:32] come to church we ought to lay aside
[1:01:35] every thought and everything of the
[1:01:37] world and enter into fellowship with
[1:01:39] Christ and worship meditating
[1:01:46] worshipping in our hearts and giving
[1:01:49] Psalms and praises to him let me just
[1:01:51] stop here I just feel just to stop you

[1:01:55] Satan's devices I know sometimes you
[1:02:00] might be Sunday morning paper readers
[1:02:02] but let me just say it to you like this
[1:02:03] when if you're having a little bit of a
[1:02:05] hard time it might be good for you to
[1:02:07] take a fast from the news and say I'm
[1:02:10] not even gonna let my mind be upon
[1:02:12] current events this is the Lord's Day
[1:02:16] I'm gonna give myself completely to God
[1:02:19] when I get home from church the
[1:02:21] newspaper will be there if it's not
[1:02:23] there there'll be the same news
[1:02:25] different people tomorrow you see
[1:02:29] sometimes we allow the enemy to rob us
[1:02:32] of our meditation looking at this
[1:02:37] checking that looking at this but you
[1:02:39] see have a fast come on somebody have a
[1:02:43] fast why because we're coming to the
[1:02:45] house of God this is not a tradition

[1:02:56] always trying to put things up you've

[1:03:00] notification and this and that in the
[1:03:02] other but you know what sanctify
[1:03:04] yourself and make ready for drug to move

[1:03:14] told them sanctify yourself on the
[1:03:17] morrow will crossing over Jordan you

[1:03:30] enter into prayer
[1:03:31] your a does it opens you up in a channel

[1:03:44] been like from the foundation of the
[1:03:46] world

[1:04:18] your name to be the one on it Lord
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:23] meditating this is our to enter in
[1:04:25] meditating and worshipping in our hearts
[1:04:29] this is before the music ever starts
[1:04:33] this is before the music ever starts how
[1:04:36] can that be
[1:04:36] if the Lord is your song he is the
[1:04:39] melody of your life you're coming out of
[1:04:44] your life already sets then atmosphere
[1:04:46] coming in here meditating worshipping in
[1:04:51] our hearts and giving songs and praises
[1:04:53] to him thinking of his goodness and what
[1:04:56] he means to us worshiping in the spirit
[1:05:00] singing spiritual songs making melodies
[1:05:03] in our heart
[1:05:04] even the
[1:05:04] said if there's any afflicted let them
[1:05:06] sing songs be happy be in meditation
[1:05:09] always expecting God at any moment to
[1:05:13] appear to you David goes on in that same
[1:05:18] song Psalm 30 and I'm not going to read
[1:05:21] all of it for sake of time but David
[1:05:23] begins to speak of things that if I read
[1:05:26] it you would recognize what I just read
[1:05:29] out of Isaiah where Hezekiah himself
[1:05:32] know what you think of this here has the
[1:05:34] class not plagiarizing Peter and Paul
[1:05:38] naresse I'm never plagiarized you see
[1:05:41] they were in tune with the same Holy
[1:05:43] Spirit and Hezekiah was not a man
[1:05:45] ignorant of god's manifestation through
[1:05:49] David's life how many times out of our
[1:05:52] life where we're praying friends let me
[1:05:55] tell you something many of the words
[1:05:56] I'll just say it that come out of my
[1:05:58] mouth and prayer are not new words they
[1:06:00] are words of things that God
[1:06:02] I've been reading or what I've been
[1:06:04] hearing and you find when you go along
[1:06:06] and that strength you wants the presence
[1:06:08] of God come down and he'll begin to
[1:06:10] guide you upon other needs and other
[1:06:12] things to pray for why because you are
[1:06:15] praying over that word and that word
[1:06:17] coming forward it's bringing you into an
[1:06:20] atmosphere because in his word is life
[1:06:22] his word is not apart from him his word
[1:06:25] is him maybe something you heard the
[1:06:30] Prophet say and you start in your in
[1:06:32] prayer you worship and you begin to go
[1:06:34] through and the Lord this just struck my
[1:06:35] heart Lord maybe I don't understand it
[1:06:37] all the way the Lord it sure struck me
[1:06:40] real good Lord how this was said right
[1:06:42] here Lord it blessed me how was reading
[1:06:44] this today Lord in the Psalms it blessed
[1:06:47] me I was reading this here you enter in
[1:06:49] with that right there because let me
[1:06:51] tell you something communion when you're
[1:06:53] entering in your community miss word and
[1:06:57] you watch how the presence of God will
[1:06:59] move right in behind that and you find
[1:07:01] David here these things many of them
[1:07:04] that we already read in Hezekiah in his
[1:07:06] prayer to the Lord you find him here in
[1:07:08] David's time but what's how what David
[1:07:11] says here as for his testimony
[1:07:13] of that you know from the Lord
[1:07:15] this experience verse 10 here O Lord and
[1:07:18] have mercy upon me Lord be thou my
[1:07:21] helper thou has turned for me my
[1:07:26] mourning into dancing you can't and I
[1:07:32] can't turn our mourning into dancing
[1:07:36] well come on brother Samuel just dance
[1:07:38] I need him come on somebody Val has
[1:07:44] turned for me my mourning into dancing
[1:07:48] Val has put off my sack loaf and girded
[1:07:53] me with gladness
[1:07:55] you know David he's been dressed for
[1:07:58] worship God has brought him through and
[1:08:02] to the end that my glory makes sing
[1:08:05] praise to thee and not be silent
[1:08:09] o Lord my god I will give thanks unto
[1:08:11] thee forever now over and over we hear
[1:08:16] the phrase
[1:08:16] a new song and we hear that by the
[1:08:21] phrase it's maybe many of your minds
[1:08:24] that go right to revelations 5 but I'm
[1:08:25] not going there tonight but you hear a
[1:08:28] new song and David will express this
[1:08:32] throughout the writings of the Psalms
[1:08:34] David will and also the other prophets
[1:08:36] were all so expressive in those times
[1:08:38] but we want to look at this tonight
[1:08:40] because as it goes on to say in Psalms
[1:08:43] 33 verse 1
[1:08:44] rejoice in the Lord O you righteous for
[1:08:48] praise is comely for the upright I want
[1:08:54] you to think of it what if the whole
[1:08:57] constitution of our life is sadness and
[1:09:01] sorrow and down what joy is there well
[1:09:09] both Samuel nobody's had it as hard as
[1:09:11] me these brothers and sisters they have
[1:09:14] had it harder and whatever they've had
[1:09:17] listen remember whatever has come our
[1:09:20] way it is common to man
[1:09:23] but God is faithful to make a way
[1:09:26] through it
[1:09:27] you know we don't want to extol our
[1:09:30] trial I lift up my trial in the highest
[1:09:34] praise Mel chair I want to lift up God
[1:09:37] in the highest priests this is where
[1:09:43] David said rejoice in the Lord o you
[1:09:46] righteous for praise is comely for the
[1:09:48] other now you know what David might get
[1:09:50] accused here he's just trying to work
[1:09:52] for people up David when trying to work
[1:09:54] nobody up David recognize there's
[1:09:56] victory in your circumstance it just
[1:09:59] depends on what you're looking at you
[1:10:02] can read the whole account of the exodus
[1:10:05] 15 where David himself takes that in
[1:10:08] Psalm 77 and he applies it to what he
[1:10:11] himself has just gone through in his
[1:10:14] infirmity he reaches back in the back
[1:10:16] testimony and said that is mine also
[1:10:19] it's what we're looking at rejoice in
[1:10:27] the Lord O you righteous for praise is
[1:10:30] comely for the upright praise the Lord
[1:10:32] with heart sing unto him with the
[1:10:34] psaltery and an instrument of Tim
[1:10:36] strings sing unto him a new song play
[1:10:40] skillfully with a loud noise for the
[1:10:42] word of the Lord is right and all his
[1:10:44] works are done in truth he loveth
[1:10:47] righteousness and judgment the earth is
[1:10:50] full of the goodness of the Lord think
[1:10:54] of that sing unto him a new song I think
[1:10:58] as one writer says like this fresh
[1:11:01] mercies demand a fresh expression of
[1:11:05] gratitude another writer would say it
[1:11:09] not necessarily a song unheard before
[1:11:12] but one fresh from the singers heart you
[1:11:17] see there's times a new song is just
[1:11:20] where indeed it is a new song it's a new
[1:11:23] experience there's a new thankfulness of
[1:11:26] gratitude you see more understanding has
[1:11:28] further opened but then there's also
[1:11:32] times of a new song where
[1:11:34] what has been wrote has now when the
[1:11:37] writers wrote because you realize songs
[1:11:39] themselves also contain prophecy within
[1:11:42] and we'll read some here tonight some
[1:11:44] that contain prophecy within them while
[1:11:46] we are waiting on that prophecy to come
[1:11:48] to pass we sing about it we rejoice in
[1:11:51] it it is the delight of our life in
[1:11:53] matter of fact it is the song of our
[1:11:56] life so sometimes their songs that's
[1:12:01] already been but it's my fresh
[1:12:03] experience in our hearts how many times
[1:12:05] their songs that has come back up to you
[1:12:08] because of something you've went through
[1:12:10] and many just has a meaning to you it's
[1:12:13] at the top of your playlist it's number
[1:12:15] one on your playlist number two and your
[1:12:16] play this number three on your playlist
[1:12:18] number four your whole playlist is that
[1:12:20] song why it's fresh in your heart now
[1:12:27] notice here notice david picking this up
[1:12:30] david here under the spirit of god here
[1:12:32] here he is this of a masonic promise of
[1:12:35] that would come through the very
[1:12:37] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:38] here he is in Psalms 40 verse 1 I waited
[1:12:41] patiently for the Lord and he inclined
[1:12:44] unto me and heard my cry now David is
[1:12:48] not just this this the Spirit of God is
[1:12:50] not just upon David just speaking of
[1:12:52] things in the future this is an
[1:12:54] experience for David as well you as me
[1:13:00] the Lord has heard me he brought me up
[1:13:03] also out of a horrible pit out of the
[1:13:05] miry clay and set my feet upon a rock
[1:13:08] and established my goings and he hath
[1:13:11] put a new song in my mouth even praise
[1:13:15] unto our God and many shall see it and
[1:13:18] fear and trust in the Lord this is
[1:13:20] exactly what took place at the very
[1:13:24] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:25] where he said I will declare thy name in
[1:13:30] the midst of my brethren I will sing
[1:13:34] praises unto thee you see in is now not
[1:13:37] loose prophecies but now the melody of
[1:13:41] the one who inspired Isaiah who inspired
[1:13:44] your mind who inspired all of
[1:13:46] down through time it has now come
[1:13:48] together in the Messianic promise here
[1:13:51] of Jesus Christ the true Messiah the
[1:13:54] true atonement what is it it is the song
[1:13:57] that is contained and has been wrote all
[1:14:00] the way down through now the notes have
[1:14:03] been put together you with me so now
[1:14:08] within that there's a song that's
[1:14:10] released because when prophecy hope Lori
[1:14:13] when prophecy comes together and loose
[1:14:15] ends are brought together it now brings
[1:14:18] forth not just a plunking of notes but
[1:14:21] it releases a song and when that song is
[1:14:25] released there's got to be somebody here
[1:14:27] to sing that song so when you look the
[1:14:31] Lord Jesus here he is the Holy Spirit
[1:14:33] now here he is in the midst of the
[1:14:35] church declaring this how is he
[1:14:38] declaring it he's declaring it by the
[1:14:40] manifestation of his life he has an aunt
[1:14:43] 'add men of God that Peter speaks of
[1:14:46] that BAE's men are declaring the truth
[1:14:49] of God by the Holy Ghost sent down from
[1:14:51] heaven you know what it is it's a lineup
[1:14:53] with a very composer of the sheet music
[1:14:56] the director and those are up on the
[1:14:58] earth it's now bringing together one
[1:15:00] great symphony that has a distinct sound
[1:15:04] that indeed Jesus Christ is the Messiah
[1:15:07] and the Holy Ghost has come there
[1:15:12] singing a song Oh does it have ups and
[1:15:17] downs sure it had ups and downs
[1:15:19] sometimes they were thrown in prison
[1:15:22] trial trials that went on then the Bible
[1:15:25] would say now had all the churches rest
[1:15:27] and throughout the region and then after
[1:15:29] rest rest recuperate get your breath
[1:15:31] trials are coming back again it was up
[1:15:33] and down with the notes but you know it
[1:15:35] wasn't like one uncertain sounds brother
[1:15:37] this is all part of the sounding out so
[1:15:44] prophesy even when you look and consider
[1:15:46] when it would speak here of even the
[1:15:50] Lord Jesus Christ and Isaiah would write
[1:15:52] of this and Isaiah 42 9 and it would
[1:15:55] even speak calling our israel's
[1:15:56] attention to what has taken place here
[1:15:59] with
[1:15:59] the invasion and how God brought the
[1:16:01] word to pass there and notice in verse
[1:16:03] nine behold the former things are come
[1:16:05] to pass and new things do I declare
[1:16:07] before they spring forth I tell you of
[1:16:11] them sing unto the Lord a new song and
[1:16:15] his praise from the end of the earth ye
[1:16:17] that go down to the sea and all that is
[1:16:19] therein the Owls and the inhabitants
[1:16:21] thereof now to think of this here think
[1:16:24] of Israel Israel singing prophecy
[1:16:28] prophecy
[1:16:29] every time when it comes time for the
[1:16:32] Paschal Lamb
[1:16:32] there's Pascal songs that they sing
[1:16:35] there's certain songs they sing at the
[1:16:38] Feast of Tabernacles certain songs they
[1:16:42] sing at this feast is it's certain songs
[1:16:45] that have been designated and wrote for
[1:16:48] certain seasons of time and you with me
[1:16:52] but nonetheless even though that Israel
[1:16:55] they do not see and did not recognize
[1:16:58] the fulfillment of it and even here when
[1:17:01] they were waiting on the Messiah before
[1:17:02] the Lord Jesus ever come they sung these
[1:17:05] songs it was identified this is with the
[1:17:08] promise here and how that song would
[1:17:10] have a meaning and an impact on their
[1:17:12] life think about it they just like you
[1:17:14] and I no doubt there were times they got
[1:17:16] down there were times they got gloomy
[1:17:18] and when they got down or they got
[1:17:20] gloomy God had provided song that would
[1:17:23] be able to minister to their spirit and
[1:17:26] be able to lift them up glory be to God
[1:17:31] you see this is where but the man talks
[1:17:33] about he said an old colored man he said
[1:17:35] that he knew that would set out beside
[1:17:37] their old he said up there where we
[1:17:39] lived in Kentucky he said up there you
[1:17:41] know it behind his house and he said he
[1:17:43] would sing you know certain songs at
[1:17:45] that time and he said it was a certain
[1:17:47] melody that that man would actually sing
[1:17:49] and he said he'd sometimes no doubt he
[1:17:51] said it's why I believe it's when he
[1:17:52] gotten weary he said that he would sing
[1:17:55] this song I will rise and go to Jesus he
[1:17:58] will embrace me in his arms in the arms
[1:18:00] of my dear Savior oh there are ten
[1:18:02] thousand charms but man so when he got
[1:18:05] weary he would sing that I would say no
[1:18:07] doubt that when he got into the first
[1:18:09] line he probably did
[1:18:11] feel like singing that song but there
[1:18:13] was something about it there that a song
[1:18:15] there's inspiration that's packed in if
[1:18:18] there of how that God Himself has so set
[1:18:20] it forth that it would move right around
[1:18:22] and you know he may not come out of
[1:18:24] there
[1:18:25] skip in and everything else but it had a
[1:18:27] meaning to him because this was a song
[1:18:30] that was a part of his life
[1:18:33] no differ from us their songs they have
[1:18:36] such meaning to us and to think of it
[1:18:38] for you and I look we're singing hymns
[1:18:41] we're singing songs we're even singing
[1:18:43] songs our inspiration has been given in
[1:18:46] this hour and because of God's grace and
[1:18:48] understanding you and I sing of it
[1:18:51] Redemption we're not just singing a
[1:18:52] redemption of God heaven Savin a pity
[1:18:55] party on somebody I'm coming down and
[1:18:57] hoping somebody will love him no sir we
[1:18:59] understand that the meaning of
[1:19:01] redemption it's God coming down to bring
[1:19:04] back to him what always belong to him
[1:19:07] what is that that's God's grace that
[1:19:09] whereby we sing it we sing it with
[1:19:12] understanding aren't you thankful to the
[1:19:15] Lord for that now no wonder hear that
[1:19:17] Paul you know would write as we refer to
[1:19:19] it last week Paul would write of how to
[1:19:22] let the Word of God look at this in
[1:19:23] Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ
[1:19:26] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:19:28] teaching and admonishing one another let
[1:19:33] it dwell in you richly let it be
[1:19:36] something that is nourishing it's
[1:19:38] releasing to you if it's something that
[1:19:42] you're taking and you're picking people
[1:19:44] apart it's not dwelling in you richly it
[1:19:47] is lifting you up and others down it's
[1:19:50] not dwelling in you richly but when it's
[1:19:52] dwelling in you richly it's a song
[1:19:54] that's coming out of your life where
[1:19:56] notes are coming together and uniting
[1:19:59] with that word and brother the life
[1:20:01] itself will speak of a life teaching and
[1:20:04] admonishing encouraging one another in
[1:20:06] souls hymns and spiritual songs
[1:20:10] lord have mercy so it means they had a

[1:20:36] this is the first church age messenger
[1:20:37] right he knows something about worship
[1:20:42] this is talking about everyday living
[1:20:47] come on somebody up here you know and
[1:20:51] the heavenlies are what remember this is
[1:20:53] everyday living
[1:20:54] this is warfare speaking Ephesians 5:19
[1:20:58] speaking to yourselves in Psalms hymns
[1:21:02] and spiritual songs singing and making
[1:21:05] melody in your heart to the Lord I tell
[1:21:11] you when you read some of the statements
[1:21:14] you know that Luther made Luther himself
[1:21:16] is known for three things Martin Luther
[1:21:19] Luther is known for the doctrine of
[1:21:21] salvation by faith alone he's known that
[1:21:24] belief that the scripture should be
[1:21:26] translated into the people's language
[1:21:28] thank God for that huh and he's known
[1:21:32] for the birth of congregational singing
[1:21:35] he felt that music was of God and not of
[1:21:39] man and he was determined to restore
[1:21:43] congregational singing in the German
[1:21:46] language to the church y'all ready for
[1:21:50] this next part so strong were his
[1:21:53] beliefs about music and worship that he
[1:21:56] wrote these fiery words next to the Word
[1:21:59] of God the noble art of music is the
[1:22:02] greatest treasure in the world it
[1:22:04] controls our hearts minds and spirits a
[1:22:07] person buckle-up who does not regard
[1:22:12] music as a marvelous creation of God
[1:22:14] does not deserve to be called a human
[1:22:17] being he should be permitted to hear
[1:22:20] nothing but the braying of asses and the
[1:22:23] grunting of hogs church age messenger
[1:22:28] are you with me he recognized the
[1:22:33] our music and the very important
[1:22:37] statement here music is not of the devil
[1:22:40] he is not the Creator he is a pervert
[1:22:44] come on somebody look what he does with
[1:22:49] his music it arouses all sorts of things
[1:22:53] sensuality and everything else all sorts
[1:22:55] of lust and sin and perversion but
[1:22:58] notice what God's music will do when
[1:23:00] God's music by the Spirit of God it gets
[1:23:03] you and I in condition for the word to
[1:23:05] come on the scene there's some times you
[1:23:08] and I are like it was when Elijah stood
[1:23:10] before Jehoshaphat we are in no count or
[1:23:13] humor for God to move in our lives but
[1:23:16] we need some good spiritual songs now
[1:23:21] brother Adam talked to us he said I
[1:23:22] really like those mellow songs but then
[1:23:25] there's also you got to read more than
[1:23:27] the message brother madam also
[1:23:28] identified there were times where he
[1:23:30] likes him snappy songs and this was a
[1:23:32] place for it well you say that's before
[1:23:34] service no if there's too many other
[1:23:36] quotes where brother branham is putting
[1:23:38] the balance well what does it come to
[1:23:39] brother send yo I don't understand the
[1:23:41] leadership of the Holy Ghost that's what
[1:23:43] it comes down to it comes down not to a
[1:23:45] dogmatic order it comes down to being
[1:23:48] may being on tune with the Holy Ghost if
[1:23:52] it's time in this service and the song
[1:23:55] service is nearer my God to thee and
[1:23:57] that's what the Holy Ghost is leading
[1:23:59] let's sing it come on now if the after
[1:24:03] service is every praise to our God let's
[1:24:05] sing it but maybe it might be that were
[1:24:08] this service it might be it as well in
[1:24:10] my soul in the in the prior service and
[1:24:12] then the after service it might be pass
[1:24:14] me an auto gentle Savior but it's same
[1:24:16] to what determines that he does he does
[1:24:20] not people's favorite songs he does this
[1:24:28] is his service it's not us ordering him
[1:24:31] what songs we want to sing see friends
[1:24:36] this is why the quotes themselves cannot
[1:24:39] be isolated you've got to take a
[1:24:41] wide-angle spectrum and how brother Adam
[1:24:45] himself would rejoice
[1:24:46] he said all he said those blacks he said
[1:24:48] I would go down there he said among
[1:24:50] brother Smith and the rest of them they
[1:24:51] would sing it's a highway to heaven he
[1:24:53] said they would get in there and start
[1:24:54] he said the chanting back and forth lift
[1:24:56] him up lift him up he said you know they
[1:24:58] have their own melody to it he said a
[1:25:00] wonderful thing I used to love to go
[1:25:02] down there oh my goodness I'm not alone
[1:25:06] [Laughter]
[1:25:11] you with me this is why it takes the
[1:25:14] discernment of the Holy Ghost so within
[1:25:18] this when we look at it here then under
[1:25:21] God's leadership and his direction of
[1:25:24] how that Luther himself would so set
[1:25:27] everything to where Luther actually
[1:25:30] wanted these songs to be printed now
[1:25:32] listen to me now
[1:25:33] Luther songs that were wrote these
[1:25:36] weren't just rambling words this was
[1:25:38] truth I hope you understanding me this
[1:25:42] was truth it was truth that had come in
[1:25:45] that hour and was made known and
[1:25:47] manifest in that time I tell you what
[1:25:49] right now
[1:25:50] if Luther was setting and hearing what
[1:25:52] you and I are hearing you talking about
[1:25:54] singing a mighty fortress is our God
[1:25:56] oh lord have mercy the Deacons would
[1:25:58] have to just Parral him and set him down
[1:25:59] Martin Luther man he would be I'll tell
[1:26:02] you what he'd be shot what a mighty
[1:26:04] fortress is our God they couldn't stop
[1:26:07] her out
[1:26:07] they couldn't destroy her they tried to
[1:26:09] kill this word they tried to take her
[1:26:11] down eat her to the roots but praise God
[1:26:14] she is restored she's standing on her
[1:26:17] feet brother he know that would break
[1:26:18] him in the midst of a course who knows
[1:26:21] he might write a new verse you say would
[1:26:27] that be a new song yes and no it is a
[1:26:31] song that was new then but now as the
[1:26:34] Spirit of God inspires it it was already
[1:26:36] declaring who God was then and Martin
[1:26:42] Luther here with him listened with hymns
[1:26:47] he wanted these to be at home hello
[1:26:53] somebody this is what I mean he wanted
[1:26:55] them to be used at homes
[1:26:58] and he encouraged schools
[1:27:01] to teach them to the children I don't
[1:27:08] mind saying this you know what I enjoy a
[1:27:10] lot of the phrasing worship I enjoy a
[1:27:12] lot and a lot of the spectrum of things
[1:27:13] as long as it's truth and not a bunch of
[1:27:15] mumbo-jumbo
[1:27:16] you're under with you with me I enjoy
[1:27:19] things that are truth that passes
[1:27:21] through the filter but I'll say it like
[1:27:23] this right here there are truths there
[1:27:25] I'm telling you there are sermons in
[1:27:27] those hymns let me tell you something
[1:27:31] one time my wife about three three or
[1:27:34] four years ago she was having a kidney
[1:27:36] stone attack you know a lot of times
[1:27:38] that's not the convenient time 2:30 3
[1:27:40] o'clock in the morning and we were
[1:27:41] praying there in the bathroom didn't
[1:27:43] know you know if I was gonna have to
[1:27:45] take her to the emergency room or what
[1:27:46] and at that time as we were praying you
[1:27:49] know we would pray we'd sing a little
[1:27:50] bit she got a hold of a songbook and she
[1:27:53] just started reading songs out loud
[1:27:57] and when she began to read those songs
[1:27:59] out loud I tell you the presence of God
[1:28:01] moving in there and then one note I'm
[1:28:04] that pain was gone you know why because
[1:28:10] there's a Holy Ghost that inspired them
[1:28:13] to write those words and that is truth
[1:28:18] that's why it's powerful you think about
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:21] some service is not just singing songs
[1:28:23] it's entering in and you can enter in
[1:28:26] you can get your healing come on
[1:28:29] somebody you see here it talks about
[1:28:32] about him them right here in Revelations
[1:28:36] 14 my my my let me try to bring this
[1:28:39] down here revelations 14 verse 1 here
[1:28:42] speaking about 144,000 and I looked and
[1:28:45] lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and
[1:28:47] with him 144,000 having his father's
[1:28:51] name written in their foreheads and I
[1:28:53] heard a voice from heaven as the voice
[1:28:55] of many waters and as the voice of a
[1:28:57] great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[1:28:59] harpers harping with their hearts and
[1:29:02] they sung as it were a new song before
[1:29:06] the throne and before the four beasts
[1:29:10] the elders notice they sung as it were a
[1:29:14] new song was it really a new song yes
[1:29:17] and no it was a new song to them because
[1:29:21] it had never become a melody before they
[1:29:24] had never recognized Jesus Christ as the
[1:29:28] Messiah so it is a song of notes that
[1:29:33] have been wrote down through the
[1:29:35] scriptures but now in this time here
[1:29:38] when he comes to them notice here they
[1:29:40] are brought in tune and in harmony now
[1:29:43] with the music sheet remember the two
[1:29:45] witnesses of revelations 11 and here
[1:29:47] when Israel they've already entered back
[1:29:49] into temple worship and here they are
[1:29:51] offering up all these sacrifices but
[1:29:53] then at that time Moses and Elijah
[1:29:55] appeared to them and what do they do
[1:29:57] they call them under the seventh trumpet
[1:29:59] they call them back to that true
[1:30:01] atonement and they point out this is him
[1:30:05] who the law and the prophets spoke of
[1:30:07] and there is a hundred and forty-four
[1:30:09] thousand of whom the song that was
[1:30:12] already laid out it that is to be
[1:30:14] inspired to them and it is a song that
[1:30:16] only they can learn nobody else can
[1:30:21] learn it because it's just their part
[1:30:24] and their eyes see it their eyes come
[1:30:27] open their eyes they recognize it and
[1:30:30] they themselves listen now what the
[1:30:32] Seventh Seal has been to us the
[1:30:34] unfolding and the making known of the
[1:30:37] true atonement is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:39] the true mercy see that same revelation
[1:30:42] strikes their heart and they are born of
[1:30:44] the same Holy Ghost that you and I have
[1:30:47] been born of in that our brother they
[1:30:50] learned a new soul Oh glory
[1:30:55] and no man no man can learn that song
[1:30:58] but the hundred and forty-four thousand
[1:31:01] which were redeemed from the earth
[1:31:03] nobody can learn the song but them you
[1:31:06] see their names Oh glory to God their
[1:31:09] names are wrote in the promises of the
[1:31:12] promised visitation to Israel their
[1:31:15] names are out there in that word Oh to
[1:31:17] see Israel gathering
[1:31:19] here coming back into the homeland but
[1:31:21] to think about it
[1:31:22] they're desiring to line up with the
[1:31:25] word there is a there is an intellect
[1:31:28] 144,000 that God is sending the message
[1:31:31] to when the Gentile church is taken in
[1:31:34] rapture and that message will be brought
[1:31:37] to them to bring them to the true
[1:31:39] atonement you're talking about a song a
[1:31:42] new song well it's like our new song to
[1:31:47] worthy is the lamb now you've gotta
[1:31:55] admit there's some songs that we used to
[1:31:57] know
[1:31:58] that's an lyrics you used to sing lives
[1:32:02] we used to live unbelief that used to be
[1:32:05] present but you see we've learned a new
[1:32:09] song it's not been taught to us by man
[1:32:12] but it's been taught to us by the mighty
[1:32:15] angel the Lord of glory the Holy Ghost
[1:32:18] the angel the Lord has come and saw the
[1:32:21] south and say hey you're part of my
[1:32:23] symphony you didn't know it but you're
[1:32:28] part of my symphony you're a note you're
[1:32:30] a life that's identified in descending
[1:32:33] what's he doing he's drawing that
[1:32:35] together that was already wrote in the
[1:32:37] music see what does it do it brings
[1:32:40] forth a new song for my life there used
[1:32:42] to be all sorts of things come out of
[1:32:44] our life unbelief in whatever more but
[1:32:47] there's a new song a new song that we
[1:32:51] have learned it's a song of overcoming
[1:32:54] grace overcoming power of supreme
[1:32:57] deliverance it's a song that I always
[1:33:01] was a child of God I am the son of God
[1:33:04] how eyes was a daughter of God we've
[1:33:06] learned a new song it wasn't good enough
[1:33:11] to change a few things we had to learn
[1:33:15] that song that we were a part of
[1:33:18] no wonder the Scriptures would speak of
[1:33:21] Israel here in Isaiah 12 in that day
[1:33:26] they shall say oh Lord I will praise
[1:33:29] thee this is Israel this is here after
[1:33:31] the gathering hear them sealing away
[1:33:33] thou was angry with me thine anger has
[1:33:36] turned away
[1:33:37] thou comfort us me behold god is my
[1:33:41] salvation i will trust and not be afraid
[1:33:46] for the lord jehovah is my song my
[1:33:51] strength and my song he also has become
[1:33:54] my salvation they will sing that same
[1:34:01] anthem now that was even sung back there
[1:34:04] in Exodus 15 oh my let me go on here let
[1:34:09] me just move on down here you know
[1:34:11] brother branham he makes it known very
[1:34:13] clear there's so many other things that
[1:34:14] would you look at Psalms there in the
[1:34:17] Psalms Psalms 96 Psalms 98 so many that
[1:34:20] that declare of the Millennium that
[1:34:22] coming time and the singing that is to
[1:34:24] take place but you know what we are not
[1:34:26] waiting to start rejoicing our singing
[1:34:31] and rejoicing are declaring has already
[1:34:34] begun worthy is the lamb to receive
[1:34:38] glory riches power honor and blessings
[1:34:44] but I'm talking about music he said you
[1:34:47] know there's something that's got power
[1:34:48] in it he said you know he's talking
[1:34:52] about wanting him to get music for him
[1:34:54] to play to take home with him he says
[1:34:56] because when I get down I get down a
[1:34:59] little low and I hear that it makes me
[1:35:02] feel good to hear good singing I'll tell
[1:35:07] you I know this is simple but it helps
[1:35:09] you it helps you here at James 5:13 is
[1:35:15] there is any among you afflicted let him
[1:35:18] pray is any Mary let him sing songs
[1:35:24] you know sometimes when we come in the
[1:35:26] house of God you don't feel merry and it
[1:35:32] is it's a sacrifice but let me just
[1:35:35] bring this down here if you are feeling
[1:35:39] merry then you just let the Lord flow
[1:35:43] through your life as you're singing
[1:35:46] songs and the Holy Ghost you can let
[1:35:49] your life be an insulator or a conductor

[1:35:57] a conductor come on somebody

[1:36:11] wonder what no sir
[1:36:13] I know God has something for me I'm
[1:36:17] expecting him to move this is not a
[1:36:21] spectator sport
[1:36:23] I am tired of this I am a worshiper I'm
[1:36:26] a believer priest I may not be able to
[1:36:30] play an instrument but I've got hands
[1:36:32] that I can clap hey man I've got a voice
[1:36:36] that I can shout to the Lord that I can
[1:36:39] praise him I know some hopeful you know
[1:36:42] some folks want to make out like they
[1:36:44] don't get excited and that's a lie if
[1:36:46] you can get excited out there about a
[1:36:48] ball game and everything else and shame
[1:36:51] on you for coming in the house of God
[1:36:52] and said here like start bumps on a loan
[1:36:55] if you get excited out there about the
[1:36:58] things of God brother
[1:36:59] you ought to get excited about the Lord
[1:37:01] inside of here ain't condemning you I'm
[1:37:06] just telling you right now there ought
[1:37:08] to be sending you check up on because
[1:37:11] sometimes people lie and they say they
[1:37:13] don't get excited that's a lie they do
[1:37:15] get excited well I don't get emotional
[1:37:18] let me get a sledgehammer on your toe
[1:37:20] and hit at one time well there you go
[1:37:26] you're trying I ain't trying to work
[1:37:27] nobody up you got to get in the spirit
[1:37:31] before anything happens
[1:37:36] and if there's any merry
[1:37:38] sing-songs so if you're not married
[1:37:42] don't get up and sing a song come on
[1:37:45] somebody we don't want that old loon
[1:37:47] through here preach brother Samuel I
[1:37:51] will we need somebody that's able to
[1:37:55] stand up and you know that is that Mary
[1:37:57] is when something has struck your heart
[1:38:00] God has done something for you and it
[1:38:02] might be a song that's familiar to us
[1:38:04] that everybody in the congregation can
[1:38:06] sing it without the words being up here
[1:38:09] but brother when it is an experience to
[1:38:11] you and you say this is my song tonight
[1:38:14] and you sing that song and the Holy
[1:38:16] Spirit comes right behind that I'll tell
[1:38:19] you it starts a channel and a flow of
[1:38:21] the Holy Spirit in the meeting just like
[1:38:24] it did there on the banks of the Red Sea
[1:38:29] here comes brother Branham out to the
[1:38:31] platform the opening of the message the
[1:38:34] darkest hour then Jesus come along just
[1:38:37] been a wonderful song that's been sung I
[1:38:40] mean that's got the people stirred up
[1:38:42] this is his first words my I know how
[1:38:46] you feel just like I do let's just say
[1:38:49] praise the Lord everybody praise the
[1:38:51] Lord
[1:38:52] that makes you feel like if you were
[1:38:54] dying you could go right on through all
[1:38:56] right wouldn't it that would make you
[1:38:59] feel like if you were dying you could go
[1:39:02] right on through all right wouldn't it
[1:39:03] seem like you'd just be fine
[1:39:05] oh brother BAM says I can just sit and
[1:39:08] drink a lot of that in and sit and still
[1:39:11] not be full he said that's really really
[1:39:13] wonderful old-fashioned gospel singing
[1:39:15] when I hear any names off the brothers
[1:39:17] and all those singing over there I'm
[1:39:18] telling you it's gonna be wonderful
[1:39:20] yes sir it sure will be just think
[1:39:22] what's this we have an opportunity to
[1:39:25] hear them forever when we get there
[1:39:27] won't that be wonderful
[1:39:28] I just love singing I think good
[1:39:30] old-fashioned singing like that is the
[1:39:33] backbone of a meeting whoa the backbone
[1:39:39] of a meeting is good old-fashioned
[1:39:42] singing because before the word can go
[1:39:46] forth
[1:39:47] the trumpeters the singers go forth
[1:39:50] first god don't want no dry warship he
[1:39:55] wants our heart in tune ready to receive
[1:39:59] from him you know what happens well
[1:40:03] here's what happens
[1:40:04] Exodus 15 verse 20 and Miriam the
[1:40:07] prophetess the sister of Aaron she took
[1:40:10] a timbrel in her hand lord have mercy
[1:40:13] where'd she find that tempering I don't
[1:40:14] know but she found it you see Moses had
[1:40:17] been singing it just stirred her up she
[1:40:22] grabbed a timbrel in her hand and all
[1:40:25] the women went out after her with
[1:40:28] timbrels and with dances imitators come
[1:40:35] on somebody they were not imitating you
[1:40:41] know what it was they were conductors
[1:40:43] they were yielded and the Holy Spirit
[1:40:46] got ahold of them - Miriam just happened
[1:40:50] to be a little bit more liberated
[1:40:52] brother them said she got a hot spell
[1:40:54] when she sold those Egyptians there on
[1:40:57] the seashore and she took out the notice
[1:40:59] she's not singing a different song
[1:41:01] she's echoing the song that the
[1:41:04] messenger has already declared in that
[1:41:07] time she's echoing that song it is a
[1:41:11] calling from her life and there are
[1:41:13] others who take up and they themselves
[1:41:15] are charts and they go right down the
[1:41:17] bank dear lord have mercy they must not
[1:41:20] been to church of christ Baptist this
[1:41:25] must have been real message believers oh
[1:41:30] brother Sammy no no no no no they must
[1:41:32] have been real believers you see Miriam
[1:41:34] answer them you see I know they're you
[1:41:36] know as a person now you may not even
[1:41:38] get out of your pew but you see you can
[1:41:40] tell friends even through the Ministry
[1:41:42] of the word
[1:41:42] you can catch when spirits are resisting
[1:41:45] and once and when there is a pooling
[1:41:46] going on you can catch even in the midst
[1:41:49] of a song service you may not have a
[1:41:51] voice any longer that could carry out
[1:41:53] maybe you know it again as you get older
[1:41:54] sometimes we got a call for you got a
[1:41:56] weakness you may not even be able to
[1:41:58] sing the full lyrics to the
[1:41:59] but your heart is in it and when your
[1:42:01] heart is in it God's moving right
[1:42:02] through that conductor and you know you
[1:42:04] may not seemingly be able to get out
[1:42:06] like boy you want to but you might say
[1:42:08] man in my heart I'm dancing right now
[1:42:11] my goodness right now I'm having myself
[1:42:13] a time right now brother BAM you know
[1:42:19] what he called it he said it was the
[1:42:21] Holy Spirit he said looked like it was
[1:42:23] catching from one to another on Miriam
[1:42:26] it was like Adams in a relay it was
[1:42:30] being passed from one to another to
[1:42:32] another what a difference it is when the
[1:42:36] Lord is my son the Lord is my son we
[1:42:44] come in here we may not know what songs
[1:42:46] that God's put upon the song leaders
[1:42:48] hard tell you the truth the song leader
[1:42:50] might think that he's got songs that
[1:42:52] God's put on his heart and maybe a song
[1:42:54] leader you know just like a minister
[1:42:55] lord have mercy if I preached everything
[1:42:57] I had up here I'd have you all here for
[1:42:59] a week the first time you got dinged Oh
[1:43:03] God gave all those song over all this to
[1:43:05] me but I don't have to preach it all
[1:43:07] tonight but if I can get in tune with
[1:43:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:43:11] he might have me sing one or two maybe
[1:43:14] three songs and say hey it's time get
[1:43:17] the man of God out here it's time for
[1:43:19] the word to come forth you see we're not
[1:43:21] interested in our program were
[1:43:23] interested in this and when you get to
[1:43:26] look again you might take one song to
[1:43:27] song whatever he wants to do whatever he
[1:43:31] wants to do because after all the Lord
[1:43:34] is my son he is my song you see you've
[1:43:42] got a song nobody can sing you now you
[1:43:46] don't know it we get to the other side
[1:43:49] you're gonna be singing a special to me
[1:43:54] right now get nervous don't worry you'll
[1:43:55] be changed
[1:43:59] you were changed but the song special is
[1:44:03] your life the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:44:08] that's come through your life don't you
[1:44:11] love him he is my soul
[1:44:16] he is my son Oh bless the Lord let's
[1:44:20] just bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus
[1:44:24] you are song Lord father we love you we
[1:44:29] appreciate you
[1:44:30] Lord how we thank you Lord God for
[1:44:34] liberty Lord where you have set us free
[1:44:36] Lord for Lord where the Spirit of the
[1:44:40] Lord is there is Liberty Liberty Lord
[1:44:43] you have set us free as sons and
[1:44:45] daughters of God that that Liberty that
[1:44:48] we might live as we ought to live Lord
[1:44:53] it's a melody in our hearts
[1:44:55] you're that melody you are song you're
[1:44:59] the delight of our life and Lord we
[1:45:03] every one of us we just want to be free
[1:45:06] want to be free in you we want to be
[1:45:09] sensitive to your presence we just want
[1:45:12] to worship your Lord or God and just
[1:45:15] giving of our lives Lord some might have
[1:45:17] a louder voice some might have a softer
[1:45:20] voice but father we want to be
[1:45:23] conductors we don't want to be
[1:45:25] insulators Lord we want the Holy Spirit
[1:45:28] to have the right away because we know
[1:45:31] that the Holy Ghost will never get out
[1:45:33] of order he's a gentleman he'll always
[1:45:36] be in order and Lord as long as we're
[1:45:40] looking to you and we're trusting you we
[1:45:42] don't have to fear Lord and father if
[1:45:45] anything would get out of order
[1:45:47] you're so faithful Lord to bring us back
[1:45:49] Lord so Lord you have desired rejoice in
[1:45:56] the Lord as David said for praise is
[1:46:00] comely upon his saints Lord Jesus we
[1:46:05] love you tonight may you just continue
[1:46:08] through the songs Lord that we would
[1:46:11] sing Lord and worship just continue to
[1:46:14] minister to the hearts and to every need
[1:46:17] right now Lord
[1:46:18] that's upon the hearts of your people
[1:46:21] if there's one Lord that maybe they're
[1:46:23] in a time of their life Lord every one
[1:46:28] of us would like to live in a time where
[1:46:31] all the notes are on the top bar of the
[1:46:35] measure
[1:46:37] but in order to be a song there's got to
[1:46:39] be low notes and high notes there's got
[1:46:43] to be the bass the treble in the mid it
[1:46:46] comes together even the pitch the tone
[1:46:51] the tempo and then as that begins to be
[1:46:55] set then there is harmony that comes in
[1:46:58] to add to that melody and bring it
[1:47:01] together or maybe one here tonight
[1:47:05] [Music]
[1:47:08] say Lord Locke David there may be Lord
[1:47:13] going through something if it's a
[1:47:15] sickness and it's a different type of a
[1:47:18] test or trial maybe it's a need Lord in
[1:47:21] their life but Lord God they believe at
[1:47:27] the notes the notes where they're at
[1:47:30] right now that it's all part of the song
[1:47:37] Lord God grant own strength
[1:47:42] father god help us maybe some of us Lord
[1:47:46] than notes right now in our life maybe
[1:47:49] they're up there right now but maybe we
[1:47:52] have such compassion Lord because to
[1:47:55] know that the notes you brought us F
[1:47:58] Lord out of the test or trial gave us
[1:48:01] grace to go through it father were
[1:48:04] trusting in you we're singing a new song
[1:48:08] we're singing Lord the songs of Zion we
[1:48:13] are the ransom of the Lord returning to
[1:48:16] Zion we are returning with songs of joy
[1:48:25] granted Lord there'd be one tonight Lord
[1:48:29] that note is low may like David said
[1:48:33] thou encompassed me about with songs of
[1:48:38] deliverance granite Lord made this fear
[1:48:42] a whisper in their heart
[1:48:44] I'm your salvation I'm your deliverer
[1:48:49] I'm your keeper granite Lord
[1:48:55] and may they take that Lord and singing
[1:48:57] that the Lord it's my soul he's my
[1:49:00] salvation granites and my father we pray
