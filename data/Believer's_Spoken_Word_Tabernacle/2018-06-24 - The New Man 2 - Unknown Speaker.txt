commit ourselves to you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ you happy to be here this morning man it's good to be in the house of the Lord we want to go to Colossians chapter 2 I just asked you if you but a Giri coming in here leave tomorrow and Lord willing gonna have him to speak here for us next next Sunday I asked you just to remember not only that service but the whole believers youth camp down there and I think it's in Indiana where they have it Lord willing we will be ministering there Sunday to services so you're just looking for the Lord just to move throughout that camp amen that God will just really really move upon the hearts and lives of the young people amen so we just we want to look into the word this morning let's look at verse 9 and we'll just read a few verses of Scripture and then we'll just let you have your seats Colossians 2 verse 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily verse 10 and ye are complete in him I love those words said by those sent me I see so much lacking in me right now but ye are complete in him so how do I move from lacking to complete and lets us know this is our resource there's nothing else that brought this change and light change of life within us and that completion every leaf every apple is already in that seed when the quickening power has moved upon that scene every leaf every attribute is already there every every virtue it's already there but it is him that brings forth this from our life ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in Baptism you don't bury people that are alive is that right I mean I hear stories about those things sometimes were but in reality you don't you don't bury anybody who's still alive buried with him in Baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I want to continue to look at this thought this morning on the new man I want to draw your attention back if you will to verse 11 where in that Paul would say ye are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ once you notice how Paul places this where this circumcision of Christ has actually brought us to a place of putting off the body of the sins of the flesh Paul makes it very very clear and very evident that there is been a change the first nature the first man he's died he's dead and Paul makes it very clear that this right here that has come forth has been borne by the circumcision of the Lord Jesus Christ but I want you to notice within this here as he says I've put off of putting off of this body of the sins of the flesh and yet I'm still looking at you in your body you're still looking at me in my body and yet this body itself is only a representation or it can only bear the image of the life that's on the inside of it so Paul would place it here that by the circumcision of Christ that by the indwelling of God's Holy Spirit the body itself is rendered powerless what you think of this it's rendered powerless we have received an authority over this vessel that we now live in we have received an authority within this now watch out brother brand places this here in souls that are in prison now he said now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit and when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are HID in God through Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit watch these words very closely now it wasn't your body died that it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's of the world anything that began has to end now watch I separates this so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when God breathed the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then so he's bringing it in that second part that we read of our natural birth so God here it's through and by the breath of life that you and I we come into this we come into this world and we know we're conceived between man and woman but yet it is and it is an act of God we're in that God Himself brings forth life but yet in order for us to have eternal life it speaks of a life itself that never ever did begin to really understand this this is something that goes beyond our minds and us being able to so place it or put things together because all that you and I remember from as far back as you can remember maybe you can remember when you know this certain little thing when you were four years old or some other times sometimes it's very hard to remember certain things and yet that's as far back as your memory in your earliest memory or what it can go to but yet within that part that has been deposited within our lives that when you and I come into this earth here think of it of how that God knew our I caller God knew our hair color God knew everything but yet the way that we came through and by the natural birth the way that this body came was not in the way that God intended for it to come because the way that it comes it still breaks down the way that it comes embarrassed of how the aging in the process it also packs within at every abstract it packs within that and this is why that when there is not only a need for the new birth within our soul but there is a need for this body to be born again so in the meantime how that the Spirit of God would move down and that seed as we've looked at it throughout the course of time that seed was placed within us when we took that breath of life that seed was laying there within us the whole time of God's choosing but then how that God would bring us to him and he would he made a way that you and I would be actually able to die to ourselves and that he would be able to raise up that seed that son that daughter that he sowed on the inside and to think of it that God did not kill the body God did not kill the spirit but it is actually the nature of the spirit that dies so there is a change that takes place you see that's why that we can look at things and there can be all kinds of changes that a person can do out here but those changes will fade those changes that can be made it it shows look at it even when you look at things that can be done where I will do this or I will do that but yet when it moves to the inside this is where it really has to have the beginning because the wreaths are not out here the wreath is down on the inside so it actually has to be routed out from the inside now look out the brother Graham goes on within this he says that nature that was in you by nature was of the world you were alienated from God you were actually an animal anyone knows that we are mammals that how many knows that we are mammal we are warm-blooded animal but that is what we are by our earthly creation but what made us different from other mammals that God put a soul upon us now the other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us were the only ones that does because we have a soul but see God in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the earth and brought up all kinds of animals from the very lowest to the highest and the highest animal come forth was man now to think of how that where Paul would replace this that by the circumcision that whereby we are separated from our first birth or our first Union and we are reborn or regenerated by the renewing of the Holy Spirit by that washing of regeneration remember in the scripture where Paul would would bring this down to it and think of how that once the fall had come that God made way that we're aware a person could come and be able to stand in his presence but the only way that that could be would be was there had to be a blood a life that was shed an innocent life and we see that clear back there in the Garden of Eden where God took that life of an innocent one and he clothed them with those garments so God when they were clothed with those garments think of it those garments themselves that they were clothed with were tied to what was spoke of in that was an innocent lamb that was there so their their clothing of what they were clothed with it's spoke of the innocency of that life that had been taken yet within animal life because animal doesn't have soul it is not a nature that is there to be able to come back upon the worshipper and bring about a real change and this is where that Paul would say in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 I believe it is where Paul would speak of how that all of those things they had a shadow they were a shadow and only thing they spoke of is they spoke of that true image that was to come but yet they were not the perfect image because those could only cover a man could you know a man would come and he would offer up the sacrifice but he left back out with the same desires within his life but once that through and by the shed blood where God became one of us then there is an atonement there is a debt that has been paid that the very life that was within the very body of the Lord Jesus Christ that life might come back upon the worshiper and this is why over and over even and through the scriptures of how that Paul would reach back under the inspiration of God and pick it up there and he would speak of how that where God spoke through David that when he bringeth his only-begotten into the world he saith unto him sacrifice and offering that would it's not but up body thou hast prepared for me there had to be there had to be a lamb a body that was prepared for him in order to come and to pay that price and know how that that you know it would go on to say in the scriptures in Romans seven for it would speak of how that my brethren ye are also become dead to the law by the body of Christ we're without the body without there being an offering up of the Lamb think of this God became one of us they had he had to become one of us that through and by he is offering up we could become dead to the law by the body of Christ that allows you and I so that you and I might be able to die to ourselves think of it like this of how the scripture says in Romans eight verse three what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so we are become dead to the law I love that that word dead means you become it's a loosened yeah it's rendered extinct and you know how it is even here in the state of Ohio they've got things that they put you know in their little booklets you you pick up for the new hunting season and they'll sometimes they'll update they'll move things from where it's on a watch list and from an endangered list and from a protected list and then they'll move it to a list that can be hunted and when you know it's on a protected list you can't hunt it because here they want it to blossom within this state so there's got a protection that's upon it I want you to think of this with what God Himself that's done within the life of the believer I tell you by the working of the Holy Spirit he is rendering extinct that first birth and he is continuing to work till eventually as we stand there on that day when this life has been fully developed in this life here and the transplanting it will be a rendering of extinction won't that be glorious there will not be any hole brother Brian why do you do this so brother just well why do you do this or brother done there won't be any of that because it won't be them doing those things neither will it be the buttons inside of me or you that's being pushed Laurie so the body he he became one of us that we might become rendered extinct or become dead to the law all glory be to God now let's look at this here just a moment on this on circumcision and the circumcision because when we look at it through the word we know that God placed the circumcision in many places of the scripture and I'm not going to read all of them I just refer to many of the places but to know how that God would even speak of it in the Book of Leviticus and of how that the manchild that he when he was born he was to be circumcised on the eighth day think of how that God God gave this to to Abraham and this this sign of circumcision was a sign in the flesh and I think of this Abraham already had faith all along are you listening he already had faith you see at God it comes to a place to where that God will recognize that faith and God has accepted that faith and then there's a circumcising there's a cutting away of the surplus flesh but notice it could not be done just any day it had to be done on the eighth day because eighth day is a new beginning and day is new life it was on the eighth day that our Lord Jesus Christ was raised from the grief on the first day of the week it's showing that through and by this was a tie that was pointing that by the circumcision of the Holy Ghost that without hands that God would bring forth his children better born in his house and that sign of the Holy Ghost the circumcision it places us within the Covenant of which we were always a part of it Isaac was always a part of the Covenant are you with me Isaac was always who God had in but notice there had to come Isaac had to come and then here had to be a circumcising in Isaac's life let me say it like this as the Prophet said in the message future hope you were always saved you will always say you are always a part of the Covenant but you had to come his provided way and the made of provided way so the you and I could come back and it's him bringing us back to where that we always were it's him it's him and he's breeding back sons and daughters of God the only way you can breed something back you have to have corresponding parts so here the see that lay within that life when the flow of the water of the Spirit of God the washing of regeneration the preaching of the word the ministering of that word it begins to draw and call the believer and it brings the believer from from where they are into a union with the Lord Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that he was raised on the eighth day so there was a circumcising so when Paul picks this up in Romans chapter 2 verse 25 he said circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law by circumcision is made uncircumcision now to think of this Paul is dealing with in throughout each one of these letters when you read you read as a Bible reader in Romans and Galatians and Colossians and on and on you find that each one of them there were Judaizers or others that would come around Paul called him in one place false brethren that were coming around and stirring up the people but what they were trying to do is take the people back to an Old Testament form of worship and remember this opening text that I read tiata cautions to Paul is dealing with the contrast between God's indwelling life whereby we are complete in him and he's contrasting that with others who themselves present unto God worship by their own and he is contrasting that to show that it's we do not worship God by our own will our own offerings but we worship Him through him by His divine will through him by the divine perfect sacrifice that brings us to that place because you and I have nothing to offer God the only thing that we can offer is our life and that's all he wants from us is our life then he himself imparts his life in us and transforms us in this life aren't you glad therefore verse 26 if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law now think a look out he's saying here if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfill the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dust transgress the law suppose dealing with it deeper because even in this time you know there are those that could say well I've been circumcised but Paul's letting them know that was given they're in a covenant this is a type this is a shadow but he's letting them know that still within your nature you might be circumcised in your body but your nature is still uncircumcised so he's letting them know there's been a change that has taken place this is not just a sign within the flesh but there is an actual change that takes place on the inside we're wearing that we as Gentiles who were of the uncircumcision but now through and by the Holy Spirit we have been circumcised or brought into the Covenant by the man Christ Jesus are you listening we have been brought in by marriage Union into the Covenant by the man Christ Jesus and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfilled the law judge D who by the letter and circumcision does transgress the law or he is not a Jew which is one outwardly Wow I tell you what man Paul is this must have been a stir I mean when he's making this known within this time he's wonder what it is he's not trying to put him down he's trying to show them a real true Liberty but they're still walking with listen whether or not these people themselves have been regenerated or not listen to me closely now if even when they have been regenerated if they still within their minds have not been washed and cleansed by the washing of water by the word although they have been renewed from within but if they're within the washing of water by the word to actually remove from them traditions and ideas that would still be there in that spirit realm we all know what I'm talking about we this is why we need that washing of water by the word it's to cleanse out our ideas our traditions we need that washing of water by the word and this is why the ministering of the word why Paul himself why would he deal with marriages why would Paul deal with all these things if it was so be that once you're born again you don't need any more instruction you don't need to be taught anymore but that is not true but the Spirit of God what to see ministering to he's ministering to the man down on the inside because many times there's things that we could be taught that if we allow that to be and things don't happen according to that way it will trouble us you understand what I'm saying it's just like certain things that people have to believe so sir service has to go a certain way and if a service doesn't go a certain way because it doesn't go a certain way or we've really not met God and see it is a tradition it is a form or an idea let me tell you something God meets you and I even write while the word is coming forth he'll meet you right there in your heart and in your mind God will deal right there in your life then there's other times that God may be at the end of a service it may be an altar call it's called sometimes maybe it's just the Spirit of God will move on your heart and you feel like you know what got to walk out of this seat right here and I'm gonna come up here and pray what that's God that's between you and God you understand what I'm saying it is a washing of ideas and this is where Paul while you say why would that be necessary because God is not just interested in you and I being planted we must be established not just planted for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God Abraham father of the faith was a Gentile who exactly right he was a Gentile but notice the designation became Jew when it were Abraham remember in the book of Genesis chapter 15 when the lot was taken captive it says he came and he told Abraham the Hebrew and the word Hebrew was a designation that speaks one from beyond one from the all glory be to God so Paul is dealing with this here but a Jew it's not one who is one outwardly but it's one who is one inwardly and he moves it to where it's the circumcision of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God I'm ask you this question there are things that can take place right here while the words going forth one tree even when maybe you're out you're going down the street you might be sitting in the car with your children or whatever more and somebody comes right across you maybe there's something that is said or done and there is nothing that is seen visibly but on the inside oh my how that Satan can suggest and it can work from the outside to the inside but that inside man when that white dog is strengthened up in the word that white dog can say get out of here I am NOT gonna get angry about I am NOT gonna get upset about this now who saw that man or God God solid your praise is of God there might be nobody that knows that nobody that knows what victories that you have over come this way where you've turned your head where you've refused to give in to this but your praise is not of men your praises of God because it is his righteousness that has been sewn into our hearts I guarantee it's in there it will reflect and manifest itself within our lives glory be to God galatians 6:15 for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature remember what Paul's dealing with you have people who were actually trying to compel others to become circumcised then Paul deals with it within the book of Corinthians cause you had those who were circumcised that they started feeling guilty and they wanted to become uncircumcised that's a study all in itself but Paul tells and let every man abide in his calling wherewith he was called he's letting it be known that it is not about your flesh it is the inward work of the circumcision of Christ for we Philippians 3:3 for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus you catch that not rejoice in Jesus Christ rejoice in Christ Jesus be anointed word we are of the circumcision who rejoice in the anointed word for our day we have been circumcised we have the word circumcised is separated we have been separated unto God oh my we're not just empty vessels but we are less 'old that had been circumcised put into service by the very power of God himself glory and have no have no confidence in the flesh can you say amen to that Paul here is the prophet of God but Paul was very clear we have no confidence in the flesh many of the times this is what gets us in trouble right here we put we start putting too much confidence in the flesh but God is there to help us to Humble us as a matter of fact he knows how that flesh itself it could just somehow it could rise but he will give thorns to help us aren't you glad for that but saying I don't need foreign spall headphones he needed him he needed him lest he should become POW well how in the world if he's been delivered and he's been born again how could he become proud it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your spirit that died Oh glory be to God notice here in the book of Joshua chapter 5 verse 9 here when they crossed the Jordan River remember here there had been a leaving out of a very important part of the Covenant they had left off circumcising the young but here at the crossing of the Jordan and as they crossed remember God told Joshua look at this now God tells Joshua to tell men to take these stones and make sharp knives out of them there were stones that were there those stones that they would have the ability but thereby they could be made into sharp stones aren't you glad that God can take the promise of the word that is laying right here it's stones that have been laying here but once you cross into the Jordan by the baptism of the Holy Ghost there is knives these promises absolutely sever you separates you from the world what is just words to others becomes separated what is just Jones you say that's the sort of the word it is quick and alive it has separated me from the reproach of Egypt so the new birth the circumcision of Christ here without hands this is how he could say to Joshua look at this and the Lord said unto Joshua he was not Joshua just circumcising it was there all of those men that were there but remember they were there under that direction and that word now listen to me now as they were under that direction in that word look it is not this man that did it and this man gave this one a birth and this one gave this one a birth and Joshua gave this one a birth and know that God says the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you you see it's God the holy ghost himself it is him that circumcise our hearts it's not a church it's not a man it's Christ himself personally that circumcised is us unto Him separating us from the world and bringing us into the Covenant of which we were always a part of now think of this here in Colossians chapter 3 verse 8 Paul said but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth why not one to another seeing that she have put off the old man with his deeds I want you to watch what he's just said put off these also put off means lay them aside throw them off as clothing that is no longer befitting so there happen listen to me now how in order for that to be it shows a separation within the individual and a divine authority to be able to put these things off reverse any when I put them off does it mean that I won't be tested on them no quite the contrary you will be tested on them come on now but there is a ruling power on the inside through and by that of the new birth that is we are feeding that new man that new man is strong but it's not ours our strength not our our own human servitude it's by his strength David said the Lord is the strength of my life that's the rapture chapter so seeing that you've put off the old man with his deeds and have put on or sunk into the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him we are a new creation in Christ Jesus dwelling in the same old temple but a new creation it's a creative work by his life moving up on that seat on the inside remember when God laid had him to sleep he opened his side he took out of his side of rib and God began to multiply cell on top of cell on top of sanity and then as it was brought forth in the completion of the body she had received of his life a life that was original that life notice in the body was a byproduct but the spirit itself was original are you with me and here when God divided there that masculine from feminine you see there was a part here that that had to be fulfilled and reflected and manifested within her life and that's the same way within your life and my life as a believer what you think of this what God himself as he sends forth his spirit he is actually separating what rightfully below to him there's only one thing that can separate what belongs to you think of it here is Abel here is King both of them are told and what is proclaimed that Adam and Eve both of them this is bull right here this is your father this is what's proclaimed but it is the sacrifice by divine revelation and how that the Spirit of God comes down upon that and Abel himself obtains a witness that he is righteous it is that revelation that breaks forth that Abel realizes that I am of God Abel recognizes that I am of Adam and Adam is of God and through that revelation it also takes the covering off of who his brother is what did that the revelation but even when it uncovered came to became Abel didn't rise up to kill Cain LA because that revelation that has moved with enables Hart you see it's something that takes place within our lives as believers that even though that you and I can look at circumstances sometimes and we are so tempted to try to look at it through carnal measures I'll correct this and say this and do this and yet you realize this is not how we're to live as believers and I understand you've got to pay bills and do other things but you understand I'm talking about things within families and other things whatsoever these are not things that can be handled by just natural means but we are people of God that have been born of a supernatural we have not been born of a supernatural that we might continue to live our lives in the natural realm as far as living here trapped but it's to bring a faith within our life to realize when situations arise that he is still the same yesterday today and forever - we're in a situation it'll look hopeless to our eyes but something on the inside will say God is still God that's the supernatural and it's a battle for us not to get trapped down here in these census then I'm gonna tell you a greater is He that's in you and you put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian Cynthia knew ond nor free but Christ is all in all doesn't matter your nationality where you come from doesn't matter your status in society what matters is once you've been born again you've been birthed into the family of God of which you were always a part of but you have just now recognized it and when you listen to me when you recognizes when you recognize it by the indwelling of his power it changes your conduct tempted to put things on but by the grace of God you have strength to put off things and you have strength to put on other things oh my believe in God brother Babbitt says you've got a soul besides your senses God never gives you those senses to trust him with God give you his spirit so that you will trust your senses is only to contact see taste feel smell in here but to you yourself is that spirit that lives into you watch I places this and when that's been regenerated and the old man died and the new man born again that is a part of God then you become a son and daughter of God and offspring of the creator then then you can believe the impossible things because you're made up of the miracle-working God you're a part of him glory be to God have not our sin theme brother brems says we have needs Lord as we go through the world this body is still physical still born of sin Sunday it'll be born of God but today it's born of sin glory so here being converted but yet still sitting in an old pest house but see God's not worried once that circumcision has taken place on the inside it equips you with strength to be able to bring this guy in subjection listen to me now it's not for you to go on autopilot you must feed feed that inner man if you don't feed that inner man you'll find weakness where you're trying to put things off and you say oh I cannot put it off it's where who are you feeding see this is where you recognize and realize I have no confidence in this thing I ain't making excuses for I am making no excuses for it whatsoever but I realize that inside of me there is a power I have been circumcised and separated or they might say this will come your way this is part of your family tree this is part of your family tree but you can stand there on the word and say but I have been been birthed into that tree of life and I can expect the strain of that life to move inside of me and access Authority to put off Romans 6 verse Warner what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death I don't believe that these people these believers sitting here I do not believe that they did not know this and were not taught this before they went through water baptism but Paul is making a point to them that to understand that when you were baptized here this was a testimony you see what real true water baptism is is to be a testimony that I am dead it's not just something to where it comes as part of a tradition or a formality will we come to this church and yeah you know somebody said all to get baptized this let me tell you something you don't need to go by somebody else's word you need to go by the working of the Spirit of God that moves upon your heart because if not you'll go into this tank a wet Center hour drive one you'll come up a wet one but there's got to be a change on the inside this must be such listen if there's such a determination to wear that a person if it can come to such a place of realizing that God who moved upon my heart that called me down through justification you know why God did that him his presence would let you know that he's a real living God who gives a real living experience that you might be like it was when they prepared to cross the Jordan they st. to fight themselves and made ready for the fulfillment of the promise because the promise is sure sometimes I know you know sometimes you think maybe some well but I think about you went too fast or I think you went too slow then because sometimes there's been situations I look at and I said why do you want to be baptized I want to know why do you want to be baptized because in some situations I want to know what's your background or my Catholic well you're not doing this out of rights this is not I go through this act and all of a sudden something's better no no this is not what this is hey brother Sam have you actually I've actually told people that and held off on things until and they themselves I would tell them you pray about it and you look my brother Samuel that's the word but I wanted to make sure because why there is a clear expectation it's not just to be baptized but the expectation is the real focus is to be filled with the Holy Ghost I'm telling you God can fill you with the Holy Ghost right where you're in your seat you can be sitting right there and the Prophet lifts it very clear in enticing spirits God can come right on the scene and do everything every night in one sweep so verse 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into his death into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life Paul's admonishing the believers this is how were to walk in newness of life what other words in verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death this word planted together here means born of the same nature of the same kind clung genital receiving of the same inherited genes if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection see what post hanging it into if we've been planted in the likeness of his death we shall also in the resurrection these mortal bodies will also be changed what's this this is very important verse 6 look at the very first two words here what's those first two words knowing this knowing this it's important to know this this is what Paul's saying knowing this knowing not because mama told me not because daddy told me not because the pastor told me but I must know this you understand I must know this within myself what about Samuel somebody that can see a real experience in your life so-and-so can see a real experience your life that's true but what I'm trying to point you to right here is that you must know this because when you know this then you have authority that when the devil can try to come and put things on he could try to put on faults try to put on accusations he can try to put on a lot of things but you have strength to know from the inside knowing this like I've said before we moved into our house and we're not about a year ago we still get mail from the people who live there I don't know how many times we keep a pen we keep pens in the car wrong address see we keep pens in the car they send us things about cruises I hate cruises I've never been on one the only kind of water I want is the one I take a bathroom when I take a shower I do not want to go out on the cruise now some of y'all might like that that's fine you can go out on the cruise but for me I don't want to go on a cruise but they keep sending it to my house now I got one choice cuz it'll say I won't say the name such as such or current resident no sir buddy current resident never requested this junk so don't just try to say well you know your daddy had this and you now no sir buddy no no they somebody said about cruises they send me stuff the catalogs that man I mean these things must cost a mint to ship against furniture I don't know if you can set on this furniture or not it sure don't look comfortable to me and ain't lazy boys and ain't couches that actually it looks like couches you might set on the end with a cup of tea and a biscuit now if you all like that style that's fine that's fine but for me I don't like them styles whatsoever what I'm trying to tell you they keep sending that stuff to the house and we keep writing you've got the wrong address and we put it back in the box and you know what it keeps coming but we keep putting it back we doing that for a year little by little they have stopped sending things credit cards and other things why because we refuse to accept it you understand what circumcision does it gives you the authority to say though I am in my natural of this family tree but on the inside I have no longer of that family tree wrong addressee don't be to God knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body look at this what's how hopeless is it that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin what does circumcising my heart have to do with deadening this everything because this right here came as a part of even that first birth but the circumcising on the inside it acts it absolutely separates you and as Paul puts in this right here our old man is crucified and the body that the body of sin might be destroyed that word destroyed means unemployed rendered idle there's factories all around us that's been idled when they've been idle they're a shell that's still there but there's no manufacturing going on on the inside it is only the remnant of a memory that was when you can look back maybe it's a steel mill in the background behind remember the days when this and that Marvin we were here here I remember all that but what is that it's memories of what was going on when it was active on the inside with people but now once it's been idled it sets there as a shell don't you realize when we have been circumcised by the Holy Ghost here we are a new man a new creation on the inside but this guy has been rendered idle this is recognizing our authority don't let him get employed put off there also don't let him get employed this guy hey man this guy you don't need Bernie Sanders they have $15 an hour this guy man this guy worked for peanuts he'll work for anything that satisfies him you understand this guy man he'll he'll jump I'll tell you what it's like you take somebody into a fight with you and you're in there and man you're getting ready for that fight and then all of a sudden this person sides with the other person you think wait a minute we ain't even been in here a minute and you're already siding against me your flesh will do that to you every single time your spirit will do that to you every single time that is why when you are feeding on the word it is necessary notice how the prophet words it and who is this Marquess today if you've never given yourself to feed fool a to fly above these things destroyed think about the sacrifice once you take the life of the animal as you're told once you take the life of the animal that body is no longer employed because the life has went out of it it's like the deer head that you all went together and had mounted of that buck that I killed out here you know you can look at that deer and I can sit there and I can look at it think back to the hunt and think back to all those things think back you know your all your love and everything that was expressed even within that but you know what I can relive all that in my mind but that thing is right there it's still it's not going around acting like a dear it looks like a dear but it ain't acting like a dear you know why it's unemployed because then I see this flesh or the skin or the hide of it yes but its life has been taken and all that you see is that hide that's there so you can see the hide and you can look at the hi no that was a deer oh that's a wolf where that's a fox or that's a Kyle or that you look at the covering or the outside so once that's been taken the life has been gone now think of this of how that that God would speak this through Paul let me try to hurry in romans 8 verse 10 if Christ be in you notice in you not on you in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness and if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you now in the Old Testament let me just come coming down here godly got many all the way through Redemption is laid out but to think of how when God would have it set forth with the tabernacle three room three room house and God would have it set forth that over the top there of the holy place and the holiest of Holies of how that God would make sure that over top of that in a time he told he told Moses in Exodus 26 verse 14 thou shalt make a covering for the tent of Rams skins dyed red not just RAM skins but they had to be dyed red they had to be soaked in that guy that red dyed red they had to have that which would speak there of one who has bore our sin ball our judgment it would speak fair of the precious blood of the Lamb notice this it would be a covering for the tenth of Rams skins dyed red and then right above that covering there was a covering above that of badger skins so the covering that's beneath the badger skins is RAM skins dyed red what's how the Prophet places this in the unveiling of God he says now I want you to notice he said that old veiled that hid the glory the old badger skins there was no Beauty to be desired of it neither was his flesh that's the reason people said a little old stooped over fella like that probably thirty years old and gray and his beard gray wasn't much to look at but Bible said there's no beauty we should desire him he didn't look like a king the old badger skin but all what was on the inside it looked like a badger skin on the outside and he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh our body hast thou prepared me but inside behind that body was the RAM of God it was the RAM that they had looked for when each of them had went to the mountain of their revelation and they with her just as Abraham they were looking for that rail they prophesied of that ramp but here in Jesus Christ here is the realm made manifest the Lord has provided for himself sacrifice here was RAM skins beneath the badger skins hey hey show us Jesus that came and saw mister he's just a man all they saw was badger skin but the elect saw Ram skins this is he who was spoken up well he said on a little bunch of holy rollers sitting together in a hot building like this they call them not much beauty to be desired but what's on the inside I'm sure it's veiled from many hearts outwardly listen to me now how outwardly it was nothing but all was on the inside what's inside of it then you see how do you get into it shaking hands joining no born into it dying getting rid of your old badger skin your old self to get into a new one forsake the old badger skin but hem eyes not still in a badger skin yes but I forsaken the badger skin here old self you're with me it's been circumcised cut away but here's the badger skin but remember if the Spirit of Christ be in you the Badger is dead the nature that lived behind this badger is dead glory be to God no wonder no wonder no wonder we are groaning and desiring to be delivered of this badger skin you realize when we have Pro truly been converted I've never had to repent one time for anything that my soul did wrong you with me never had to do that but I've had to repent plenty of times plenty of times for this time but I can't put it off and say Lord forgive me you know my old sorry flesh Lord no I say Lord forgive me I didn't go to sleep did you not everybody did but here notice I don't like I put these up there but just listen this a moment when you come in behind that badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creature and come into the presence of God then the word becomes a living reality to you you see friends we were to encourage one another but I cannot be your experience you cannot be my experience OMA as much as my wife and I'll have such wonderful fellowship around the world she's not my experience neither can I be her experience but we can't encourage one another now listen friends it's got to be something so real within you that it has become a reality to you that if everybody walked away it has been made alive to you and not just something that you say it's truth but your life says truth truth truth truth truth then the word becomes a living reality to you all of them then you're awakened to the Shekinah glory then the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever when we circumcised out of our old self Omaha Road Rash says you know behind that badger skin he said people can look and say well I can remember when that person did such and such and such as this man says that's what they was they are no longer that it's the badger skin that's still there but it's unemployed it's rendered idle amen Oh mom behind that badger skin in there oh he said the outside it looks like a bunch of holy rollers the old Badger skin but inside has this a kind of glory inside that by badger skin behind that human skin in there is the Shekinah glory in there is the power in there is the word there is the shewbread old friends this is the reality within our lives knowing this we must know this that reality that is within us in there is the power in there behind the veil is the power to live an overcoming life in there that life when it's circumcised its him living his life through you same same old badger skin but new life on the inside oh my you're loving this morning those skins brother Bama sent in one other place those skins he said was one time on a badger you've been around people they can remember you before God got ahold of your life I know some some folks in that's I think listen I'm gonna taste something you don't calm potato all the young people you don't need to go out in the world you know the grace of God no sir you don't have you don't have to touch one cigarette one drinker dude you don't have to know that to know God's grace no sir understand that very clearly but there's still a part about you that even when maybe you as far as a finger can never been laid on your life but there's a change it takes place and it's a change that you know about where this this word this life it is a life to you and you have received power on the inside and it's not just well I don't do this I don't no no this is a power to live out the will of God in this generation it's a power of the overcoming life that gives you the strength to reflect Jesus Christ let me tell you something it wouldn't matter if they put you in the midst of hell you'll still live in overcoming life but say me how can that be you tell me how Daniel did it right in the Babylon and Daniel didn't even have the Holy Ghost like we have it but it shows you Daniel was so purposed to the God that he met they put him right there in Babylon he lived right there around the throne but he made up his mind I will not defile myself with the King's wine and the Queen Kings meat and I believe God's got people that's been called out of Babylon that says I will not define myself with the wine of this world I will not eat of her meat but I will stand separate unto God and receive that new wine I received that meat that has come from God that meat not only what is too of a neat but that meet that sustenance it is in doing the will of God a strength they lived right there in Pergamus in the very seat of Satan I know how sometimes you're in the midst you might be surrounded by a bunch of unbelievers and there the mouths and everything that they say and they do but yet in the midst of it it is the power of God within your life that you are living and overcoming life standing right there what a miracle what a paradox because you want to know why you are not of this earth you're not of this world you've been lifted up out of this world and to the rest of them you look like a nut they don't understand how can you not give in to this you know I mean I've stood there and looked at a doorknob for how many weeks and I will not drink and I will not drink and I will not drink and I will not drink drinking is this and drinking is that I will not do this I will not do that but you didn't meet a doorknob you just went through the door you met the door Christ Jesus you didn't just look at a doorknob and repeat a bunch of says and it's a mind over matter but the mind of Christ has come and sought you out and lifted you and walks you into Liberty such a Liberty that you can say I can do it if I want to but I don't want to you mean you can't yeah but I don't want to I've been liberated this is a real Liberty not this kind of nonsense and trash they try to promote through our government this is the real Liberty let's finish Romans 6:4 he that is dead is freed from now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead diet no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord reckon yourselves have the regard think of yourselves thinking not robbery reckon yourselves once you think of this Paul when he makes this scripture putting off the sins the body the sins of this flesh in our opening text that word a putting off is a laying aside Paul would write through different places in the scripture and Paul would say for this earthly Tabernacle if it be dissolved we have a body in the heavens not made with hands Paul goes on through that portion of Scripture in 1st Corinthians 5 just speaks of it think about Peter spoke of this Tabernacle this body Paul said Peter could say like this he said he has showed me that I must shortly pull it off this tabernacle you see they realized this Tabernacle was not them they realized it was a garment that was given but there was an image of the heavenly that had moved on the inside and was pressing itself in morphing through to be shown on the outside and so they realized this body of flesh is only a visible form such as the Prophet would tell us in the message the Hebrews series he said william branham you have never seen him the only thing he said you've ever saw is this outside man that you called him and he said this outside man this veil keeps us he said from things that we need to see he said but one day he said a matter of fact the real william branham is invisible you've never seen him but yet when you would look look you would look at that bonding say brother Ram but what is it it's the character that is behind there that has expressed itself through that body but this body that you know it's Samuel browning and you put up put your name to it the authority that we have received through him by the circumcision of the Holy Ghost we have put off by the grace of God that old nature guess what we've received the earnest this body is gonna be changed this body is going to be born again to match the new birth in my soul aren't you glad in my soul by the new birth there is no deformities well here with me my soul is not susceptible to sickness when this gets born again there in not only will there not be any sickness but there'll be no susceptible it will come according to how God intended for it his job said I will wait I will wait and I will wait for my changed and when he shall call I shall come forth listen to this as that clothes things that are to be just want to share this with you I didn't I don't think I may have put it up I don't know this old earthly tabernacle here you know what it is this body it's like an old coat that you wear a coat that you once wear but now you have one so much better you don't use it anymore what do you do you're hanging in the closet before you've got one better you've got a better coat it's more up-to-date than the one you used to wear that's worn out what it is that garment you are the inside of that there that garment only done what it bore your image but you don't need it anymore now you've hung it up it's a rag and that's the way this old body is you it's more the image of the heavenly yet it is not you you are on the inside of that body you the Spirit of God is on the inside of that body that's what makes the outside come into subjection because the inside is pulling it pulling it yes there's a war but greater is he that I sent you the inside man is pulling it see it's bringing it in line with the Word of God one day that inside man will pull it right into a change you're inside you yourself your being this body is just an old coat some day what will you do with it you already says someday what will you do with it it was only a garment for a while this is locked their earthly garment this body you are real body your real self is on the inside of this old coat that you call William Branham or Suzy Jones or whoever it is some day you know hanging in the Earth's Hall of memory of you you'll put it out on yonder in the great but someday somebody will put a tombstone up here lies Reverend so-and-so Johnson so or so and so it'll lie there as a memorial of you that people just seen you in this and what you was your real you was on the inside of that but the old code itself just born the image of the heavenly what's happened the circumcision by the Spirit of God has been able to extract with us by the new birth what belongs to him and bring back sons and daughters of God and through him by that there will actually be a body that will come forth by God himself that will match this body if we die and those that have passed on in Christ they've entered into this the author me over there on the other side right now they've been busy they haven't been just sitting around they've been shaking hands not going through one another they've been shaking hands getting reacquainted it's like you when you go to a family reunion there's some people that get there ahead of you and then now with our communication that we have nowadays they're sending your text hey hey what router you're on where y'all at what mile marker what's it look like right now they're asking you those questions because they have already got there and when the rest of the family starts showing up something about hey hey we're rounding the curve yeah yeah we can see home I can see home bay there already hey come on let's get down here they're coming they come out of the house they're coming right down to welcome it's a reunion and there they are reunited together fellowshipping but then at his timing the dead in Christ shall rise they will come forth and their theophany and they will come back down here and take upon their body a glorified body hallelujah it will not be a body that has been brought forth by man and woman it will look according to how the members were laid out within his book there will not be any blemish there will not be any abnormality of sin there will be no mocking of that there and they will pick up their glorified body and we will take our glorified body for when we see them we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the very atoms of our bodies will change change on by his word his presence his life and we will take our glorified body to meet our theophany I say that with this what authority that we have right now not in the millennium we shall reign we're raining right now this is where we are to reign right now reigning over sin reigning over the world reigning over the devil reigning over the flesh it's a reign that's going on right now now look how this reign happens though this rain is not by brute force this rain is not by I tell you what hit no that that's not that's not how the body I'll tell you about it no that's not it the way the body is ruled is by the heart and submission to God the submission and humility allows the power of God to flow so the word is not given to us that we might somehow come forth by our own strength but it's submit yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of this message that God has revealed to us is the mighty hand of God it's the mighty hand of God yes it is this is God has revealed to us and I say to you now what authority that we have to live a victorious life knowing this that our old man is crucified you have Authority you have authority to live a victorious life you believe that this morning or Jesus what do we thank you what promise that God you've placed within our hearts but to think more of how that you have made it so clear to us that by this earnest money this earnest of the Spirit of God within our lives that is circumcised circumcised us from the body the sins of this flesh Lord I pray right now this morning I asked Lord by your mercy that if there's one here that's not ready I pray this would be the morning I pray this would be the moment that they would just let it be settled in their hearts Lord let it be that Lord God were they recognized that there's a settling there is an overcoming granite or Jesus and I pray and Lord make each and every one of us realize as Paul speaks to us midway through this chapter likewise reckon ye yourselves also dead but alive unto God through Christ Jesus or Jesus we realize each day Lord God we pack around this body Oh how many
