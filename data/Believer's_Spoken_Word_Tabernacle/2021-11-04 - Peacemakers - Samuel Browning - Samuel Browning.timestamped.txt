[33:37] [Music]
[33:47] is
[33:51] [Music]
[34:03] how many know that by experience
[34:06] amen
[34:07] those precious times
[34:10] when we're going through it they don't
[34:11] seem like precious
[34:13] times
[34:14] but you know those are the times that
[34:17] where our character is being molded
[34:19] and being shaped
[34:21] you know we come here and we receive
[34:24] instruction from the word receive life
[34:26] we receive encouragement
[34:28] but you know
[34:29] this doesn't mold us
[34:31] it's the yielding to the word that we're
[34:34] receiving remember john said it was
[34:36] sweet
[34:38] and my mouth was honey but when it it
[34:40] got down to practical outworking
[34:42] living out oils
[34:44] it was bitter
[34:47] but i'm grateful to god to know that
[34:49] there is by experience there is power
[34:52] in the word of god
[34:54] all we have to do is is eat it become
[34:57] one with it and say
[34:59] be it unto me lord
[35:00] the word has within it the power
[35:04] to transform
[35:06] our lives
[35:07] and our outlook and every situation
[35:11] is the same god tonight
[35:14] we're witnesses of that let's just
[35:15] approach him in a word of prayer before
[35:17] we look into the word tonight
[35:19] heavenly father
[35:21] what a privilege it is lord to be
[35:24] gathered here once again tonight
[35:27] how thankful we are lord
[35:30] just to be able to come
[35:32] and enter into your presence
[35:35] father to press beyond all the toils
[35:38] of the day and of the life
[35:41] to know that
[35:42] lord jesus
[35:44] it's in your presence where lord we
[35:47] receive such strength
[35:50] renewing refreshing
[35:52] even lord
[35:54] where
[35:55] we find how that we are looking at
[35:57] things
[35:59] when we come into your presence lord
[36:02] it's a testimony that
[36:05] ways that we never would have thought
[36:08] and lord
[36:09] of approaching
[36:11] maybe dealing with the situation or
[36:14] answering whatever it is we know that
[36:18] as your prophet told us lord and i
[36:20] believe that not only this apply for the
[36:22] new birth but i believe for every aspect
[36:24] of our life
[36:26] he said it was less than five minutes
[36:29] in your presence
[36:31] where moses was before that burning bush
[36:35] and he learned
[36:36] more
[36:37] than all the 40 years that he had before
[36:42] lord jesus
[36:44] our learning itself there's certain
[36:46] things that can serve within that then
[36:48] you give us the ability to learn
[36:51] but there's absolutely no way that our
[36:54] learning
[36:55] can give us strength through the trials
[36:58] of life
[37:00] our own learning our understanding
[37:03] can never ever meet the challenge
[37:07] but just a moment in your presence
[37:11] we're just asking tonight that lord as
[37:14] we are
[37:15] are gathered lord in the precious name
[37:17] of the lord jesus christ that
[37:20] lord right now through the building we
[37:22] just pray that god that that same pillar
[37:24] of fire with lord as licks or laying
[37:27] within hearts just to so move to unite
[37:30] our hearts into that purpose that lord
[37:33] let me just move beyond every barrier
[37:37] thought or doubt or unbelief whatever it
[37:39] is let me just i want to move into your
[37:42] presence tonight lord

[40:16] enough
[40:17] so amen let's just let's do that just so
[40:20] you can be aware and planning on things
[40:22] and praying about it
[40:24] amen
[40:25] matthew chapter 5 verse 9
[40:28] let's just read one verse of scripture
[40:29] and we'll let you have your seats
[40:31] tonight
[40:33] blessed are
[40:34] the peacemakers
[40:36] for they shall be called
[40:38] the children
[40:40] of god
[40:42] blessed are
[40:44] the peacemakers
[40:46] for they shall be called
[40:48] the children of god
[40:50] i'd just like to speak to you tonight on
[40:54] the peacemakers
[40:55] may god bless the word and reading of it
[40:58] as you're being seated tonight
[41:02] i just think as we've been looking at
[41:04] the thought of of the peace of god
[41:08] you know sometimes there's different
[41:10] avenues that we we approach and we look
[41:13] at in the word of god and you know you
[41:15] never know exactly
[41:17] the avenue of where things are going to
[41:18] take you but it all is
[41:20] every every avenue it all ties right
[41:23] back into the lord jesus christ
[41:26] and how that every scripture itself
[41:28] comes together it all it all weaves
[41:30] together
[41:31] for the same picture sometimes there's
[41:33] ways that how god will bring out in his
[41:35] word because the word itself is not just
[41:38] something of a picture that's just a
[41:40] two-dimensional
[41:41] it's three-dimensional it's a place that
[41:43] we can walk into remember when god would
[41:46] tell
[41:47] paul and paul would pray for the saints
[41:49] of god that we might know the depth the
[41:51] height and the breath
[41:53] remember when the man's eyes was healed
[41:55] in the bible and he said i see men as
[41:57] trees walking
[41:58] so god's word is meant to have a it's a
[42:01] perception and sometimes it's it's
[42:04] sometimes how god will take us and it's
[42:05] just
[42:06] our perspective and just having us look
[42:08] at things sometimes from a different
[42:10] angle and we all can testify tonight
[42:12] that that's one of the great blessings
[42:14] sometimes is when we actually can come
[42:16] to a place of looking at something maybe
[42:18] from a different angle looking at the
[42:20] same thing but god will have us look at
[42:22] it maybe from a different angle and
[42:24] that's what we've been looking at here
[42:26] is god's just been leading us through
[42:28] those different parts on the love of god
[42:31] and when we look at this scripture here
[42:33] the lord jesus here in the beatitudes
[42:36] and he would
[42:37] give this particular
[42:40] admonition that blessed our the
[42:42] peacemakers and we would know that just
[42:43] by that word alone the peacemaker it's
[42:46] one who would make peace and we know
[42:49] that within ourselves that you know
[42:51] there's a lot of things that you know
[42:53] you're a lot of times we remember as
[42:56] kids growing up you know and if there's
[42:57] little skirmishes you have between
[43:00] cousins or sisters or brothers and
[43:02] probably none of y'all had that
[43:04] but you know how it is mom and everybody
[43:06] else or dad or different ones try to
[43:08] facilitate things and get it together to
[43:11] where there's peace and you know tell so
[43:13] and so you're sorry and you know and you
[43:15] know how this is kids i remember
[43:16] teaching elementary school and you'd see
[43:18] that
[43:20] sorry you know it just and you you could
[43:22] say well that was really heartfelt and
[43:24] but you know you really wasn't something
[43:26] you know you're just trying to teach and
[43:28] direct them in the right way because
[43:30] um it's the right thing with peace and
[43:33] peace is how we were meant to live
[43:35] upon this earth
[43:37] because there's one thing that came to
[43:39] disturb peace and that actually brought
[43:41] the disturbance and that was sin
[43:44] unbelief is is the greatest hindrance to
[43:47] peace it's the greatest hindrance to
[43:49] peace itself being facilitated or put
[43:52] forth in our own life and the only way
[43:54] that you and i could fulfill this
[43:56] scripture here blessed are the
[43:57] peacemakers is if first of all there has
[44:00] been the peace of god that has come to
[44:04] our lives to where we are no longer at
[44:07] war with god
[44:08] you know a person could say i love god
[44:11] but they can still be at war with god
[44:13] because the bible says in romans chapter
[44:15] 8 that it says that the carnal mind is
[44:19] enmity to god and yet the carnal mind
[44:22] can look and say i love god i scribe to
[44:25] do this i'm going to do this and god
[44:28] said to do this and i want to do this
[44:29] and and that's all well and good but you
[44:31] realize that's even the grace of god
[44:34] that can even accompany a person by way
[44:36] of a new heart and a new spirit that
[44:39] actually then causes you then to agree
[44:42] with the word because the holy ghost can
[44:45] never come without there being agreeance
[44:47] to the word
[44:49] and you and i listen you and i could
[44:51] never bring ourselves to that place to
[44:53] where we come to a place of death and
[44:56] surrender that the new birth can come
[44:58] into effect in our life without the holy
[45:01] spirit working in our life to bring us
[45:03] to repentance and then through that new
[45:06] heart and new spirit where we begin to
[45:09] look at the word and agree with the word
[45:11] you know you can't get anywhere without
[45:13] agreement so the holy spirit remember
[45:16] he's the very peace of god because the
[45:19] peace itself is not just an attribute of
[45:21] god it's who he is
[45:24] because when we looked at that last week
[45:26] when it speaks of melchizedek it says he
[45:28] was king of righteousness and peace
[45:32] so as paul would write the god of peace
[45:35] so it's not just an attribute that's who
[45:37] he is he is he is peace itself as paul
[45:41] would write he is our peace
[45:44] so when we look at this it it reversed
[45:47] before we and i could ever be a
[45:49] peacemaker or one who loves peace or who
[45:53] seeks to make peace then we in ourselves
[45:57] are ones that must be occupied with the
[46:00] peace of god now let me just go out here
[46:02] just for a moment
[46:03] making peace does not mean compromise
[46:08] you see
[46:09] think of how the lord jesus
[46:11] uh let's just go here think how the lord
[46:13] jesus when he said in his word think not
[46:16] that i have come to bring peace but i've
[46:19] come to bring a sword that would seem
[46:21] contradictory to this statement when he
[46:23] would say blessed are the peacemakers
[46:25] but to understand he's not come to make
[46:28] peace with sin because sin is what has
[46:31] taken peace
[46:33] but he's come to deal with the real root
[46:36] of the issue the war the struggle on the
[46:39] inside where then a person is no longer
[46:42] striving to be pleasing to god but they
[46:45] have received the peace of god in their
[46:48] life and they are at peace with god and
[46:52] the war has ceased they are serving god
[46:55] now not out of letter but out of the
[46:58] spirit who gave the letter and gives the
[47:01] letter lie
[47:03] so it must be the peace of god in the
[47:06] life in order to be a peacemaker because
[47:10] it's not us going around as i said like
[47:12] between two kids and everything else we
[47:15] understand that peace itself this right
[47:17] here only comes by the word of god
[47:22] it doesn't come any other way let me
[47:24] just go on to say this the only way that
[47:27] the word of god comes into effect is not
[47:30] by our oversight of the word but by us
[47:33] coming into the word and when we come
[47:36] under the authority of the word then the
[47:38] authority of the word flows through our
[47:42] lives
[47:44] so to be a peacemaker
[47:46] there's so much that within this part
[47:49] and the scripture as if god will help us
[47:51] tonight as we see
[47:52] it's not so much of us taking a
[47:55] situation and moving over it as much as
[47:58] it is us ensuring and operating with our
[48:02] lives under the governance of almighty
[48:05] god
[48:06] because
[48:07] uh let's just go on here it just more
[48:09] just keeps on unfolding as i'm standing
[48:11] here and i want to just look here at the
[48:14] let me look read from the amplified
[48:16] bible if you don't mind
[48:18] and it speaks the same verse
[48:20] and it said blessed here's who's blessed
[48:23] those who enjoy
[48:24] invaluable happiness spiritual
[48:27] prosperous with life joy and
[48:29] satisfaction in god's favor and
[48:31] salvation let me just pause spiritual
[48:33] prophecy uh prosper prosperity spiritual
[48:37] prosperity is where the virtues of jesus
[48:40] christ are flowing through our lives
[48:43] how many know that amen because peter
[48:45] said if these things be in you and
[48:48] abound
[48:50] they
[48:51] make you that you should not be
[48:53] unfruitful
[48:55] and to realize that the flow of those
[48:57] virtues they come out
[48:59] even as we're working and moving in
[49:01] times that would be adverse to us
[49:05] is that right
[49:07] oh my
[49:09] blessed blessed now let's go to the last
[49:11] part of here
[49:13] so and satisfaction in god's favor and
[49:16] salvation regardless of their outward
[49:19] conditions are the makers
[49:22] and maintainers of peace those are two
[49:25] parts
[49:26] makers and maintainers
[49:29] you and i are called to this blessed are
[49:31] the makers and maintainers of peace for
[49:35] they shall be called the sons of god
[49:39] incredible jesus never spoke here in the
[49:42] beatitudes blessed are they who speak in
[49:44] tongues
[49:46] blessed are they who pray for the sick
[49:48] although all those parts are very are
[49:50] very important but remember as we've
[49:52] been looking at paul said i can have all
[49:54] of those things
[49:56] and without charity
[50:00] [Music]
[50:01] so you have we have a choice in this
[50:04] life here jesus is saying
[50:07] that when when you are known as a peace
[50:10] maker
[50:11] one who makes peace remember by the word
[50:15] that only comes by the word our
[50:17] authority as sons and daughters of god
[50:19] only comes by the word is that right
[50:22] so it must come through and by the word
[50:25] so to be that a maker and maintainer of
[50:28] peace then we are recognized as sons of
[50:30] god this may not seem it may not seem
[50:33] too glamorous to us but remember that
[50:35] part about not seeming too glamorous is
[50:37] a result of the fall
[50:39] the things many times that we look for
[50:41] and say my if this could just take place
[50:44] whoa wouldn't that be awesome and god
[50:46] looks at us and says that's so minuscule
[50:50] oh god if i could just walk on the
[50:52] water adam did that right
[50:55] adam did that before
[50:58] you see the things that you and i look
[51:00] at we look at so glorious and forget
[51:03] that what it is that manifests in these
[51:06] times here we are we were trapped in a
[51:08] fallen nature and god's grace has come
[51:11] to us to bring a rescue to that seed
[51:15] within us that then equipping it with
[51:17] the dynamic power in order to live a
[51:21] godly life that when situations around
[51:24] us are not matching the enoch condition
[51:28] our souls but yet we've been brought
[51:30] back into authority as sons and
[51:33] daughters of god to master those
[51:36] circumstances not the circumstances
[51:39] master us
[51:40] how many can say yes lord
[51:42] that's the truth
[51:44] you see you have to agree with the word
[51:46] let me just say this you have in order
[51:48] to the situation and circumstance that
[51:51] you might be facing whether it's illness
[51:53] in your body no matter what it is you
[51:55] must first agree with the word that the
[51:58] word is true thy word is true o lord
[52:03] and when you will go to agreeing with
[52:05] the word don't forget that liar who's on
[52:07] your shoulder just test him to the side
[52:09] and agree with the word you'll find it
[52:12] will bring strength into your life for
[52:15] the word to come to pass of what god is
[52:18] addressing and the need in the situation
[52:21] we're called as sons and daughters of
[52:23] god let me tell you something you know
[52:25] we're living we're in a moment in a time
[52:27] where you're either going to control or
[52:29] you're going to be
[52:30] controlled it's either one or other
[52:33] things right now things that uh just as
[52:35] a son and daughter of god when god made
[52:38] made man in the beginning in genesis 1
[52:40] 26 27 28 he made man to be a god upon
[52:46] the earth
[52:47] he was under god
[52:50] and he was given as the bible says
[52:53] the a charge and a commission to
[52:55] multiply to replenish to subdue and to
[53:00] have dominion over the fish over the
[53:02] fowl the heirs and so forth now remember
[53:05] this this godship
[53:07] over the earth as a son of god
[53:10] was was with that purpose to think of
[53:13] how that it was there was no evil there
[53:16] was perfect love
[53:18] there was a perfect understanding
[53:20] yes
[53:21] what was the control that what was the
[53:24] authority that was given was to be
[53:26] operated or lived by the word
[53:31] you know brother brown would dramatize
[53:32] it in in it was not in a manner for that
[53:35] authority to be uh you know fish don't
[53:37] swim here fish swim there no it wasn't
[53:40] meant to go around and telling things
[53:41] what to do it was meant with the purpose
[53:44] when god said he took that man that he
[53:46] created and then in genesis 2 he now
[53:49] takes that man that's in his image and
[53:52] places him in a flesh body are you with
[53:56] me and he puts him in the garden to keep
[53:59] it and dress it incredible keeping and
[54:02] dressing speaks of the presence of an
[54:04] enemy and there was no enemy known or
[54:07] present at that time yet satan and
[54:09] lucifer was working but you see god
[54:12] is entrusting his son with that
[54:14] understanding he places him in a garden
[54:17] to dress it and keep it that's where you
[54:19] and i have been placed you see for you
[54:21] and i we bypass come down here and that
[54:24] seed of god that attributes laying on
[54:26] the inside and now the holy spirit comes
[54:29] by way of the new birth to raise up that
[54:33] man horse or woman on the inside and we
[54:36] become a new creature in christ jesus
[54:40] and so it's not us
[54:42] exercising dominion but first it is god
[54:46] exercising dominion in our own life and
[54:49] we submit to that so then it's not our
[54:52] dominion it's god's dominion operating
[54:56] in the channel of a son or daughter of
[54:59] god
[55:01] and there's an authority
[55:03] that's given there because without god
[55:06] you take you take the holy spirit away
[55:08] from our lives we're no more than just
[55:11] like any other person
[55:13] oh sure you know people can be anointed
[55:15] and everything else but i'm talking
[55:17] about a life that where there is a
[55:20] mastery of circumstances not
[55:23] circumstances mastering us and we've all
[55:25] let me just put this disclaimer we've
[55:27] all been there where situations they're
[55:30] mastering us and yet our life is under
[55:33] the control of the master
[55:35] understand what i'm saying by mastering
[55:37] we're fretting we're worried we're
[55:39] fearful we're concerned and whatever and
[55:41] listen we can put away the angels wings
[55:43] because none of us are angels
[55:46] we've all been there i can't preach on
[55:49] that tonight but to understand as sons
[55:51] and daughters of god that these things
[55:53] come around but don't you let the devil
[55:55] lie to you and say well you wouldn't be
[55:58] dealing with this if you weren't a
[56:00] daughter of god or a son you put that
[56:02] liar on notice
[56:04] that your soul has been sealed by the
[56:07] holy ghost
[56:09] but you might deal with things in your
[56:11] spirit your mind your flesh even
[56:13] weaknesses in our body there's times
[56:16] when you know what my body might ache my
[56:18] soul's not aching
[56:20] [Music]
[56:21] my soul don't need motrin sometimes my
[56:24] hip needs motrin but my soul has never
[56:27] needed a tylenol or an aleve or a motrin
[56:30] are you hearing me now my body sometimes
[56:32] might need a shot or an antibiotic or
[56:34] one but my soul needs none of that
[56:37] because i've already received the toxin
[56:40] of the holy ghost and i'm at peace with
[56:43] god and you know what that does that
[56:45] causes me to seek after that peace so
[56:48] that it will permeate in every area of
[56:51] my life
[56:52] because i know as a son of god
[56:55] that that is what's given to me
[56:57] is for peace
[56:59] in this life
[57:01] so the son of god a daughter of god and
[57:04] here we come back into that place
[57:06] made in the very
[57:08] image of god
[57:10] and god places us here
[57:12] and to see
[57:14] of how that
[57:15] in galatians 5 22 let me just move to
[57:18] there
[57:20] paul would write
[57:24] paul's dealing with
[57:27] let me just give just a little bit of a
[57:28] background paul's dealing with
[57:32] where men have come into the church
[57:36] they're in galatia
[57:38] and they've wanted
[57:40] to try to take the people
[57:42] back to the keeping
[57:45] of feasts
[57:46] and rituals
[57:48] and as though that that is what
[57:52] is what stabilizes them
[57:54] and paul has to take you know when you
[57:56] read the book of galatians and he has to
[57:58] take it and remove it that it's not your
[58:01] righteousness
[58:03] because if it's your righteousness my
[58:06] righteousness we're in trouble
[58:10] because if we're still living on our
[58:11] righteousness then we have we are
[58:13] rejecting the righteousness of god that
[58:16] is by faith in christ jesus
[58:20] is that right so it's not the keeping of
[58:23] those things
[58:25] suppose speaking of paul was let me just
[58:28] say this paul was a man as the first
[58:30] church agent messenger you look how paul
[58:33] would minister in hebrews paul would
[58:35] would tell this in philippians in
[58:37] colossians thessalonica galatians
[58:41] look throughout all the scriptures
[58:43] and watch how the holy spirit will deal
[58:45] with we're going to look at some tonight
[58:47] it will deal with that of a rest among a
[58:50] believer in a believer's life the rest
[58:52] of the holy ghost that rest that were to
[58:54] enter in why because solomon was a type
[58:58] remember when solomon was was was
[59:01] ordained by god to build that temple and
[59:03] david was told by god your son shall be
[59:07] called a man of rest
[59:10] which it was a type of the coming of the
[59:14] holy ghost after the lord jesus would
[59:17] give his life
[59:18] now the holy spirit is the rest of god
[59:22] and in the life of the believer he is
[59:25] that man of rest that brings us into
[59:28] rest
[59:29] ruth could never be brought into rest
[59:31] unless there was a man of rest that
[59:33] could bring her into rest
[59:36] is that right
[59:37] so here look how paul's paul under the
[59:40] leadership of the holy spirit is placing
[59:42] the rest and because there were those
[59:45] who wanted to trouble the people and
[59:47] paul is going straight back to the word
[59:50] to deal with where the troubling is
[59:52] coming from
[59:53] and he says it like this the fruit of
[59:55] the spirit is love
[59:57] joy peace long suffering gentleness
[1:00:00] goodness
[1:00:01] faith meekness temperance against such
[1:00:04] there is no law
[1:00:06] that's wonderful in it
[1:00:08] there's no law against being meek
[1:00:11] temperance
[1:00:13] know what meekness is it's giving place
[1:00:16] where brother branham talked about how
[1:00:18] the man walking down the sidewalk and
[1:00:21] here he was just walking and i can't
[1:00:22] remember who was with a dwight moody or
[1:00:24] one of them and the man just walking on
[1:00:26] down
[1:00:27] get out of my way white moody just
[1:00:29] stepped off
[1:00:31] and he said remember the man said get
[1:00:33] out of my way you fool or whatever
[1:00:34] morton dwight moody just stepped off and
[1:00:36] says i i always do get out of the way
[1:00:38] for them
[1:00:40] something i don't have the rewards
[1:00:41] exactly right but you see he gave place
[1:00:43] brother brown said for some people this
[1:00:45] is the only millennium they're ever
[1:00:46] going to have
[1:00:48] don't get entangled up with them
[1:00:51] given place meekness the bible said the
[1:00:53] meek shall inherit the earth those who
[1:00:56] give place
[1:01:00] this world's not my home amen
[1:01:03] i'm not here to try to make it you know
[1:01:05] what i'm gonna i'm gonna be the well let
[1:01:07] me go on
[1:01:09] and they notice verse 24 i want you to
[1:01:11] notice the scripture and they that are
[1:01:14] christ's
[1:01:15] have
[1:01:16] crucified the flesh
[1:01:19] it's speaking of that old nature on the
[1:01:21] inside notice have crucified
[1:01:24] the flesh
[1:01:25] with
[1:01:26] the affections and left they're still
[1:01:28] there but it's been crucified
[1:01:30] they're not in here but it shows that
[1:01:33] part there's got to come a greater
[1:01:36] ruling part on the inside and we must
[1:01:39] live by that authority not be drawn out
[1:01:42] into these gates as soon as we're drawn
[1:01:44] our spirit we're defeated
[1:01:47] is that right as soon as we're drawn out
[1:01:49] in
[1:01:49] any from living back there in that
[1:01:51] presence we're defeated
[1:01:54] under the samuel but what a when when i
[1:01:56] have to approach something in the
[1:01:57] natural you don't approach it by your
[1:01:59] own things and say god i got this so
[1:02:01] i'll call you when i need spiritual help
[1:02:04] no no
[1:02:05] it's for every part of our life amen
[1:02:07] right he's every part of our life this
[1:02:09] is not a thursday and a sunday and when
[1:02:11] jesus when i need you i'll bring no
[1:02:14] he's our life
[1:02:17] he's our life we see so much of that in
[1:02:20] the world already with hypocrisy look
[1:02:22] where the world turned in 9 11. man
[1:02:25] everybody was going to church
[1:02:28] everybody become everybody under a
[1:02:31] crisis becomes religious
[1:02:34] but you see what about when everything
[1:02:36] else is going good
[1:02:39] what about some things are going your
[1:02:40] way
[1:02:43] come on now and then you see quickly
[1:02:45] then had just as quick as the church is
[1:02:47] filled up the churches start emptying
[1:02:50] yes
[1:02:52] is that right
[1:02:53] but it's a constant life that that's
[1:02:55] where a life of a believer because
[1:02:57] there's there's no very bridge to go
[1:02:59] back to i don't want to go back nowhere
[1:03:01] there's no desire there's no fear of
[1:03:04] going back in the world because the
[1:03:06] world has passed out of my life amen
[1:03:11] oh my
[1:03:12] if we live this is where i want to draw
[1:03:14] from here if we live
[1:03:16] in the spirit
[1:03:18] let us also
[1:03:20] walk
[1:03:21] in the spirit
[1:03:23] so if we're living there our soul
[1:03:25] we are placed and we're living from that
[1:03:27] court like you think of that drawing
[1:03:29] that we've had up weeks ago
[1:03:31] then let us also walk or this word means
[1:03:33] to direct one's life
[1:03:37] in the spirit
[1:03:39] first thessalonians 5 12. now look at
[1:03:41] this admonition we beseech you brethren
[1:03:44] to know them which labor among you
[1:03:47] and are over you in the lord and
[1:03:48] admonish you
[1:03:50] and be it and stand to esteem them very
[1:03:53] highly in love for their work's sake
[1:03:56] upon him to say worship them right let's
[1:03:59] just look at this for a moment but
[1:04:00] esteem them very highly in love for
[1:04:03] their work's sake and be at peace among
[1:04:06] yourselves notice how the holy spirit
[1:04:09] would have paul to join these things
[1:04:11] together first of all to know them that
[1:04:14] labor among you
[1:04:16] and are over you in the lord
[1:04:18] well as as placed by god as a leader but
[1:04:21] remember
[1:04:23] it's it's that where you recognize it's
[1:04:26] not brother samuel but it's the word
[1:04:29] you're not being led by brother samuel
[1:04:32] you're being led by the world
[1:04:35] hey israel could say well where is moses
[1:04:37] going but to understand they weren't
[1:04:39] really looking that it was flesh they
[1:04:42] knew that moses was getting his
[1:04:45] direction from the logos from that
[1:04:47] pillar of fire
[1:04:48] so it was not man's mind that was
[1:04:51] leading it was god what a blessing that
[1:04:54] is that is to stabilize the life of the
[1:04:58] church and then as we recognize that
[1:05:01] that part that it's god that is feeding
[1:05:04] us it is god that is leading us now
[1:05:07] comes that responsibility to understand
[1:05:10] that great value of the revelation how
[1:05:13] many appreciate the leading of the lord
[1:05:16] you appreciate the word of god the holy
[1:05:18] spirit coming right down and ministering
[1:05:21] to your needs i don't know how many
[1:05:22] times you know where we can fellowship
[1:05:24] and say my you know this was not known
[1:05:27] but god came right down the way and
[1:05:29] spoke right to my heart you see that's
[1:05:31] not man man can't do that that's god
[1:05:34] doing that and that's god working on a
[1:05:36] channel between you and him that you
[1:05:39] might rest
[1:05:41] and then through the value that god i
[1:05:44] value that channel not just that channel
[1:05:47] but my life being a conduit that your
[1:05:50] word can come to because brother ram
[1:05:53] said where there's a resentful spirit in
[1:05:55] a service he said the holy spirit will
[1:05:58] not reveal anything
[1:06:01] so it becomes the responsibility that
[1:06:04] not only for the ministry but for us
[1:06:07] together to be a channel and this is
[1:06:10] where the responsibility paul is
[1:06:12] speaking of be at peace among yourselves
[1:06:14] that we recognize hey satan's desire is
[1:06:18] to come and disturb
[1:06:20] peace
[1:06:22] is that right
[1:06:24] never comes in like a red horse rider
[1:06:26] but it comes into the white yeah
[1:06:28] right is that right
[1:06:30] that's why brother could even say in
[1:06:31] christ the mystery you put someone among
[1:06:33] you
[1:06:34] fellowship with you and so forth and
[1:06:36] then the test becomes
[1:06:38] that we're able to stand with the word
[1:06:41] are you hearing me
[1:06:42] this is why you see this is why as the
[1:06:44] prophet could say where he says at that
[1:06:46] time he said you stay with your pastor
[1:06:49] he's ordained to lead you through i'm
[1:06:50] not saying that to lift me up i'm
[1:06:52] talking about the word
[1:06:54] because the word does not take into
[1:06:56] account nor does it operate based on
[1:06:58] somebody's feelings here or this here
[1:07:00] that's not how the word operates
[1:07:02] remember a peacemaker is standing with
[1:07:04] the word amen
[1:07:07] is that right paul could even see how
[1:07:09] that the church was being troubled in
[1:07:11] galatia and paul could even make the
[1:07:13] statement that there are those who are
[1:07:15] troubling you i wish that they even were
[1:07:17] cut off from among you
[1:07:19] paul's desire and his love was for the
[1:07:21] entire body but when someone had rose up
[1:07:24] to bring trouble to the body let me just
[1:07:26] say this plain and simple there is one
[1:07:29] thing that matters more than anything
[1:07:31] else and that's the body of jesus christ
[1:07:35] that matters more than my feelings my
[1:07:38] thoughts or my ideas
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:41] is the body of jesus christ this work
[1:07:44] right here that god has entrusted me it
[1:07:47] matters the body matters not me not
[1:07:50] anybody else it's the body that matters
[1:07:53] and that's how we're to live our life
[1:07:55] it's the body of jesus christ
[1:07:58] first
[1:08:00] not my family first the bounty of jesus
[1:08:03] christ first amen
[1:08:07] hallelujah and my family isn't
[1:08:09] cooperating with that then it's time for
[1:08:11] the family to get straightened out so
[1:08:13] that it can cooperate with the body amen
[1:08:15] hello somebody
[1:08:17] i mean this is this is the reality of
[1:08:19] how where brother brown would warn how
[1:08:22] satan would come in very subtly to try
[1:08:25] to disrupt the program of god
[1:08:29] but you and i are charged with that not
[1:08:31] just brother samuel we are in charge
[1:08:33] with it you to recognize that channel
[1:08:35] and then also to recognize that within
[1:08:37] your own life
[1:08:38] brother bill can't do it for you when he
[1:08:40] song leads paul can i can't your husband
[1:08:43] can you can you're entrusted remember a
[1:08:46] dominion that's been given back to you
[1:08:48] as sons and daughters of god it is
[1:08:50] incredible how sometimes that we allow
[1:08:53] the enemy to take things from us that
[1:08:55] we've been given dominion over i will
[1:08:58] stand in my pray for the sick or i'll do
[1:09:01] this and we're going to take dominion
[1:09:03] over the spirit and yet then we'll allow
[1:09:05] another spirit to just enter in amen
[1:09:10] incredible
[1:09:12] but how can we give a little cow can we
[1:09:14] allow one is because
[1:09:17] with his flesh
[1:09:20] there's always a part within us decide
[1:09:24] whether you say amen or not it's true
[1:09:26] it's true
[1:09:27] i mean brother brown would have never
[1:09:28] had to say it in christ the mystery if
[1:09:30] it wasn't true that's right
[1:09:32] true right
[1:09:33] there's a part about us that's tribal by
[1:09:35] nature
[1:09:37] that's what we're dealing with
[1:09:39] the new birth don't take that out of you
[1:09:41] it changes your soul and gives you
[1:09:43] dominion so you're not living subject to
[1:09:46] the tribe of your family name but you
[1:09:49] are living according to the name of
[1:09:51] jesus christ for he has redeemed me out
[1:09:54] of all kindred nations and tongues
[1:09:58] is the kingdom of god first
[1:10:01] brownings are second amen
[1:10:03] third we'll have water a point you want
[1:10:05] to put you understand
[1:10:07] this is where paul could write in second
[1:10:08] corinthians 13 11. i better get going
[1:10:11] finally brethren farewell be perfect be
[1:10:13] of good comfort be of one mind live in
[1:10:16] peace i read this to you one last week
[1:10:18] live in peace and the god of love and
[1:10:21] peace shall be with you how many want
[1:10:23] the god of peace and love with us
[1:10:25] i want it with me i i need him i need
[1:10:28] him every day of my life
[1:10:30] so here's the quad here's the qualifier
[1:10:33] live in peace
[1:10:35] well in in is dealing with a place
[1:10:39] a position of where we're to live from
[1:10:41] now notice this word peace means to make
[1:10:44] peace i want you just to hold that now
[1:10:46] to make peace
[1:10:48] to cultivate
[1:10:50] or keep peace
[1:10:52] a harmony
[1:10:54] to be at peace so a person in order to
[1:10:56] actually operate you you might indeed be
[1:10:59] filled with the spirit of god but to
[1:11:01] actually operate as a peacemaker there's
[1:11:04] times where you and i both
[1:11:06] we have to go before god and we just
[1:11:08] this is not a one once in a while trip
[1:11:11] it's living in the presence of god
[1:11:14] now friends we we believe in prayer life
[1:11:16] we believe in getting into the word of
[1:11:18] god sometimes we're looking for we're
[1:11:20] looking for avenues of victory and god
[1:11:23] is letting us know you want to get
[1:11:24] closer to me very simple brother graham
[1:11:27] said read
[1:11:28] and pray
[1:11:31] and you'll draw closer to god has
[1:11:32] nothing to do about do you feel like you
[1:11:34] got understanding that day did you feel
[1:11:36] like something i don't know how many
[1:11:38] times in the morning with devotions when
[1:11:40] i'm going through certain things and
[1:11:42] devotions and maybe it's in isaiah or
[1:11:44] jeremiah because i have a plan that i
[1:11:46] follow each year and you know just so
[1:11:47] that i don't get in study mode because
[1:11:49] that's very easy to do and so when i'm
[1:11:51] looking at there's sometimes where i
[1:11:53] feel like my goodness i feel like the
[1:11:55] pipe from heaven is just wide open and
[1:11:57] my goodness there's streams flowing
[1:11:59] everywhere lord have mercy how am i ever
[1:12:02] going to minister this and minister that
[1:12:04] on top of other outlines here and this
[1:12:06] and that and then there's other times
[1:12:07] that i feel like
[1:12:09] is is there a pipe
[1:12:12] sometimes that has nothing to do with oh
[1:12:14] brother samuel you're not living where
[1:12:15] you should be no remember there are
[1:12:17] times for that that is times of proving
[1:12:20] grounds as well i'll tell you i'm just
[1:12:23] learned in those times not to get go
[1:12:25] down and oh my goodness what have i done
[1:12:27] i've learned in those times is just you
[1:12:29] know what just listen because god will
[1:12:31] give to me beyond what my conscience can
[1:12:34] actually pick up there are things and
[1:12:36] i've witnessed it where the holy spirit
[1:12:38] maybe i'm studying in another part and
[1:12:40] all of a sudden something will come back
[1:12:42] and sure enough it was in one of those
[1:12:44] days that i thought nothing itself
[1:12:47] didn't seem like any pipe was open but
[1:12:49] sure enough it dropped but it dropped
[1:12:52] beneath that conscience down to the
[1:12:54] subconscious in my life you see this is
[1:12:56] where our trust is in the lord oh my
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:00] this is part of our life this is part of
[1:13:02] the responsibility you know one one to
[1:13:04] go around and operate the world
[1:13:06] right now the world wants to go around
[1:13:07] and supposedly they want to make peace
[1:13:10] but they want you to agree with them and
[1:13:12] all we've got to make peace and you know
[1:13:14] peace in an incredible that the very
[1:13:16] symbol that they use for peace is a very
[1:13:18] blasphemy against the cross of calvary
[1:13:22] it shows a broken cross are you hearing
[1:13:24] me
[1:13:25] there is no peace outside of the lord
[1:13:28] jesus christ there is no peace outside
[1:13:32] of the gospel of the lord jesus christ
[1:13:35] none whatsoever
[1:13:37] this peace is not a temporal peace it is
[1:13:40] an eternal peace
[1:13:42] but it's amazing that this peace that
[1:13:44] house it would try to be operated now as
[1:13:47] we look at this it's to make peace how
[1:13:49] many know there's times to make peace
[1:13:52] when you make peace it shows that
[1:13:54] there's differences
[1:13:56] that's part of being a peacemaker
[1:13:58] there's times when you have to make
[1:14:00] peace
[1:14:01] right
[1:14:02] and then there's other times here's
[1:14:04] another part cultivating it
[1:14:07] this takes a wise steward right not just
[1:14:10] man woman too
[1:14:12] cultivating for those things that make
[1:14:16] for peace
[1:14:18] and
[1:14:19] keeping those things that you identify
[1:14:22] this is peaceful
[1:14:23] this goes well
[1:14:26] keep that
[1:14:28] so these are our responsibilities so
[1:14:30] we're not just aimlessly wandering
[1:14:32] around notice paul would write in romans
[1:14:34] 12 16 be of the same mind paul would
[1:14:37] write this over and over and over
[1:14:39] i don't believe he's just writing to all
[1:14:40] the sorry make believers unbelievers out
[1:14:42] there the real believers don't need no
[1:14:43] help no we need help with this we need
[1:14:45] reminded of it be of the same mind
[1:14:48] one toward another
[1:14:51] mind not high things but condensed sin
[1:14:53] to men of low estate be not wise in your
[1:14:56] own conceits
[1:14:58] notice skip on down to verse 18. or no
[1:15:01] lurid 17 recompense to no man evil for
[1:15:03] evil provide things honest in the sight
[1:15:06] of all men
[1:15:07] if it be possible
[1:15:10] as much as life
[1:15:13] in you
[1:15:15] live
[1:15:16] same word peaceably make cultivate or
[1:15:20] keep peace
[1:15:21] to be at peace in yourselves now you
[1:15:24] realize before we can ever be at peace
[1:15:26] with one another we've got to be at
[1:15:27] peace in ourselves
[1:15:29] so you see where satan comes to work is
[1:15:32] to get our peace
[1:15:34] all twisted up that's right think of how
[1:15:36] that this is if it be possible to live
[1:15:39] in a state
[1:15:41] with one's friends
[1:15:43] my goodness i mean there'd be no
[1:15:45] problems with it just me and me on this
[1:15:46] planet
[1:15:47] are you on this planet are you with me
[1:15:50] where do where do
[1:15:51] all of our difficulties come from
[1:15:55] not my dog
[1:15:58] not my pets
[1:16:00] human relationships
[1:16:03] are you hearing me
[1:16:04] how much that all these things even as
[1:16:06] we as pointing out here even earlier
[1:16:08] even when paul or peter would write
[1:16:10] adding to your faith adding to that real
[1:16:12] experience in your life and you're
[1:16:14] adding all the way up all of those parts
[1:16:16] that are packed in your life where do
[1:16:18] they come out in human
[1:16:21] relationships
[1:16:23] are you hearing me
[1:16:25] they come out in times where it has to
[1:16:27] show that there's something greater on
[1:16:29] the inside
[1:16:31] than just a person is all they've got
[1:16:33] this person is so peaceful
[1:16:37] there's a lot of people who there are
[1:16:38] very peaceful right there's people have
[1:16:40] such a peaceful spirit but it may not be
[1:16:43] that they've got the real peace of god
[1:16:44] on the inside
[1:16:47] is that right
[1:16:48] now notice when we look at this live
[1:16:50] peaceably with all men because this
[1:16:52] requires a laboring
[1:16:56] a laboring think of it a man who loves
[1:16:59] god must labor after this think about
[1:17:01] how that a man you know we can't we
[1:17:03] cannot have broils
[1:17:05] you know
[1:17:06] fusses and misunderstandings with others
[1:17:09] without having our own peace
[1:17:15] that's disturbed how many feel good when
[1:17:16] you've had an argument
[1:17:20] no
[1:17:21] probably feel lower than the pad
[1:17:22] underneath this carpet
[1:17:24] you don't feel good about it or when you
[1:17:26] there's been an exchange of words
[1:17:28] you don't feel good about it
[1:17:30] if you do
[1:17:31] you you you think you might need
[1:17:33] something
[1:17:36] you might you might need a touch of the
[1:17:38] real touch of the holy ghost if you
[1:17:39] enjoy that and that's how your life is
[1:17:43] because a real child of god does not
[1:17:45] love disturbance amen let me just say
[1:17:49] this to you it isn't just well this
[1:17:51] person they avoid conflict they do that
[1:17:53] but a real child of god is a peacemaker
[1:17:56] one who loves peace
[1:18:00] and who seeks after it not only in their
[1:18:02] own marriage not only in their own home
[1:18:04] but in the church of the living god they
[1:18:07] seek for peace
[1:18:12] oh my think about it
[1:18:14] you and i've come to a place if you've
[1:18:16] been born again of the spirit of god
[1:18:18] where the peace of god has completely
[1:18:20] set down on the very throne of your
[1:18:21] heart but how did that come about
[1:18:25] how did that come about
[1:18:27] think about it how did that go well well
[1:18:29] brother sam you know he went to calvary
[1:18:30] died and rose again and sent back to
[1:18:31] hollywood but how how did that come
[1:18:33] about where the peace of god is on the
[1:18:35] throne of our heart
[1:18:36] how did that come about
[1:18:38] if first of all started with his love
[1:18:42] ministering to us
[1:18:45] and drawing
[1:18:46] us
[1:18:47] dealing with us
[1:18:49] because he knows if i can just contact
[1:18:52] them
[1:18:53] this shadow
[1:18:55] this cloud
[1:18:56] this unbelief these attributes all that
[1:18:59] right there will be cast aside
[1:19:02] this is the power
[1:19:04] the peace of god what an atmosphere you
[1:19:06] know brother says it like this what kind
[1:19:08] of an atmosphere should we live in
[1:19:11] in a consoling
[1:19:13] soothing
[1:19:14] healing atmosphere we should live in
[1:19:18] with our hearts constantly in prayer
[1:19:22] let me say lord help me
[1:19:25] remember constantly in prayer doesn't
[1:19:27] mean you always have to be in your
[1:19:28] prayer closet
[1:19:30] because
[1:19:31] most of us realize by now
[1:19:33] sometimes the best laid plans that we
[1:19:35] have they get upset
[1:19:37] but this is where paul said pray without
[1:19:39] ceasing
[1:19:41] it isn't saying that we take away from
[1:19:42] those times we we seek for those times
[1:19:45] to get along with god but remember you
[1:19:47] can also be alone with god right while
[1:19:49] you're walking down the midst of a store
[1:19:51] you're in your car don't ever remember
[1:19:53] the circumstances it's not what dictates
[1:19:56] to you if you're in an environment and
[1:19:58] that environment's all twisted up what
[1:19:59] can you do you're able to slip away to a
[1:20:02] separate little room or slip away over
[1:20:04] there and say lord jesus you know the
[1:20:06] need for the moment lord
[1:20:09] oh my we're talking about sons and
[1:20:11] daughters of god
[1:20:13] with a deep love now notice here's the
[1:20:14] result of it with a deep love for every
[1:20:17] person we come in contact with
[1:20:19] notice
[1:20:20] every person we come in contact with
[1:20:24] hebrews 12 14
[1:20:27] follow
[1:20:28] peace
[1:20:33] make sure i get this right with all
[1:20:36] men amen
[1:20:40] and
[1:20:42] holiness
[1:20:44] without which no man
[1:20:47] shall see the lord
[1:20:49] now this is our responsibility
[1:20:52] the desire that we have the greatest
[1:20:54] desire when god has dealt with our life
[1:20:57] is that our lives would be a display of
[1:21:00] the lord jesus christ
[1:21:02] that it's not so much that people are
[1:21:04] are noticing boy they you know they're
[1:21:05] they're religious no but there's a
[1:21:07] display of christ about our life
[1:21:12] but sometimes you know family
[1:21:16] work and other times
[1:21:18] follow peace with all men
[1:21:20] then there's situations then that are
[1:21:23] not very peaceable
[1:21:25] but the scripture says follow pursue
[1:21:29] after peace
[1:21:30] seek that let that be the first
[1:21:34] priority because without that in
[1:21:36] holiness
[1:21:37] then they can see no reflection of
[1:21:39] christ
[1:21:40] through your life
[1:21:43] look how this reads in the amplified
[1:21:44] state strive to live in peace with
[1:21:48] everybody
[1:21:49] and pursue that consecration and
[1:21:52] holiness without which no one will ever
[1:21:56] see the lord you realize you can
[1:21:57] disagree with somebody and still be at
[1:22:00] peace
[1:22:03] to be at peace doesn't mean that people
[1:22:05] have to agree with you
[1:22:07] all right that's right is that right
[1:22:10] sometimes living peaceably it means you
[1:22:13] realize i don't need to engage them
[1:22:16] hello
[1:22:17] i'm talking about wisdom and realizing i
[1:22:19] don't want to upset i would not want to
[1:22:21] cause them to say something against me
[1:22:24] against the lord so you realize it's not
[1:22:26] a time of engagement what are you doing
[1:22:28] you're making peace
[1:22:31] you're not walking up there and saying
[1:22:32] well let's see what they're going to see
[1:22:34] today no that's not following after
[1:22:36] peace
[1:22:42] oh my because we want them to see
[1:22:46] that reflection of christ through us
[1:22:48] first timothy 2 1. i exhort therefore
[1:22:51] that first of all
[1:22:54] supplications
[1:22:57] prayers intercessions and giving of
[1:22:59] things
[1:23:01] be made for
[1:23:03] all
[1:23:05] men
[1:23:08] hello
[1:23:10] for kings and for all that are in
[1:23:13] authority
[1:23:15] why
[1:23:16] that we may lead
[1:23:18] a quiet and peaceable life
[1:23:22] in all godliness
[1:23:24] and honesty
[1:23:26] you appreciate peace
[1:23:28] i do
[1:23:30] i appreciate peace i appreciate peace in
[1:23:32] the church
[1:23:33] i appreciate peace in my home
[1:23:35] that isn't just something we know that's
[1:23:37] just
[1:23:38] it just you know something that
[1:23:39] magically happens we have to
[1:23:42] work at it
[1:23:44] pete this right here that paul is
[1:23:46] talking about he's not saying hey we'll
[1:23:48] just put this on autopilot it don't work
[1:23:50] that way
[1:23:52] because our humanness is not on
[1:23:54] autopilot
[1:23:56] are you here
[1:23:58] notice first peter chapter 3 verse 10
[1:24:00] for he that will love life
[1:24:03] and see good days
[1:24:04] let him
[1:24:06] refrain his tongue from evil
[1:24:09] and his lips that they speak no
[1:24:12] diet
[1:24:14] let him rescue evil and do good
[1:24:18] let him
[1:24:19] seek peace
[1:24:22] and ensue it
[1:24:23] how many seekers of peace
[1:24:30] you come into your house and you wonder
[1:24:31] why isn't this picked up you ain't
[1:24:33] seeking peace
[1:24:36] you you might as well get the trenches
[1:24:37] laid out
[1:24:42] right
[1:24:43] and let's just face it when we come from
[1:24:45] things of life whether it's our job
[1:24:47] whether it's things of life sometimes
[1:24:49] where things get that things and cares
[1:24:51] of life
[1:24:52] that get up on us burdens and sometimes
[1:24:54] things that we're entertaining i'm not
[1:24:56] talking about things sinful i'm talking
[1:24:58] about just in carrying burden sometimes
[1:25:02] and then things that we're entertaining
[1:25:04] this thought about or this thought about
[1:25:06] it and before we know it we're so in
[1:25:08] such a turmoil in our own spirit
[1:25:12] to where we're not looking at things
[1:25:14] as a son or daughter of god would look
[1:25:16] at it
[1:25:18] instead we're here we are and something
[1:25:20] is said or this is done but as the
[1:25:23] children of god were to seek peace but
[1:25:25] let me tell you something before i ever
[1:25:27] step foot in that door these are not
[1:25:29] buttons that we push
[1:25:32] these are things that god is telling you
[1:25:34] and i cultivate your life in my
[1:25:38] peace live in that place because you and
[1:25:41] i do not know the next moment we do not
[1:25:44] know the next time somebody's going to
[1:25:46] say something about us somebody's going
[1:25:47] to offend us so we don't have all that
[1:25:50] in control oh bless god brother samuel
[1:25:52] it'll just roll it'll just roll right
[1:25:54] off of me who do you think you're going
[1:25:55] to get to believe that
[1:25:58] it might roll off of your soul but it'll
[1:26:01] have to be dealt with in your spirit
[1:26:05] and in your mind so that you don't think
[1:26:08] of it every time that you see that
[1:26:10] person or their name is mentioned come
[1:26:12] on now we're preaching right down where
[1:26:14] the rubber meets the road we're talking
[1:26:17] about seeking peace but sometimes you
[1:26:19] think well brother samuel i walked right
[1:26:21] in i was seeking for peace but you
[1:26:23] weren't even praying you weren't even
[1:26:26] looking to god and really submitting
[1:26:28] yourself how did adam speak to the wind
[1:26:31] and say peace
[1:26:34] because where he was living
[1:26:37] you see this authority that you and i
[1:26:39] are given remember it's from him
[1:26:42] and it must flow
[1:26:44] for our lives
[1:26:49] let me move on to ephesians 4 2.
[1:26:52] with all loneliness and meekness
[1:26:55] with longsuffering
[1:26:57] forbearing one another in love
[1:26:59] endeavoring
[1:27:01] to keep the unity of the spirit
[1:27:04] in the bond
[1:27:06] of peace knowing paul is dealing with
[1:27:08] how that peace itself
[1:27:10] seeking for peace
[1:27:13] it invites the holy spirit remember
[1:27:15] brother rahm says when you go to acting
[1:27:16] like a wolf the dove takes his flight
[1:27:19] so you want god to come into the
[1:27:21] meetings god to come into your home god
[1:27:23] to visit you
[1:27:24] then remember this is very important
[1:27:26] endeavoring you know what endeavoring
[1:27:27] means how many know we're in a battle
[1:27:29] paul said put on the whole armor of god
[1:27:31] this word endeavor right here is one of
[1:27:33] a strategic military
[1:27:36] term
[1:27:37] it means to strategically in other words
[1:27:40] you're not just walking around you know
[1:27:42] with the head in the clouds we're not we
[1:27:44] recognize with all the endeavoring but
[1:27:46] where does this all come back to our own
[1:27:48] personal walk
[1:27:50] with god
[1:27:54] this is where our peace comes from this
[1:27:56] is where peace comes from in our home it
[1:27:58] isn't like oh if i could just be like
[1:28:00] brother shane and sister lily if i could
[1:28:02] just it's because
[1:28:04] of where they would live if you're
[1:28:06] looking at somebody else and saying oh
[1:28:08] if i could just be like that oh if i
[1:28:09] could you can yes you can because
[1:28:12] nobody's got super dna in here right
[1:28:14] it's a matter of fasting if you chest
[1:28:15] trace traits back through our life i
[1:28:16] don't care what your last name is we got
[1:28:18] a lot of junk all right yeah
[1:28:20] and if you're one for the holy ghost
[1:28:22] we'd all be in a mess
[1:28:25] come on now
[1:28:27] you know so notice within these things
[1:28:29] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:28:32] spirit in the bond of peace
[1:28:35] now look how paul would write of this
[1:28:37] here in romans 4 14 verse 17 for the
[1:28:40] kingdom of god is not meat and drink
[1:28:44] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[1:28:47] the holy ghost now remember there were
[1:28:49] those who as far as liberty they were
[1:28:52] able to eat any meat they wanted to eat
[1:28:54] whether it was offered to idols or one
[1:28:56] or more they weren't eating it as meat
[1:28:57] that was offered to idols they were just
[1:28:58] hey it's
[1:29:00] this is filet mignon man
[1:29:02] it goes perfectly with lobster let's
[1:29:03] just take it in it had no bearing to
[1:29:05] them but there was another brother who
[1:29:07] was a weaker brother or a weaker sister
[1:29:09] that that troubled them
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:12] right
[1:29:13] and so because it troubled them notice
[1:29:16] you had those that were going about with
[1:29:17] liberty and within that liberty it
[1:29:19] wasn't that they were condemned before
[1:29:21] god but now once this is brought to
[1:29:24] their attention because what is their
[1:29:25] liberty doing there is liberty between
[1:29:27] them and god god's not looking down and
[1:29:29] saying oh you shouldn't eat that filet
[1:29:30] mignon it was offered there on that cow
[1:29:32] that was offered to that i don't know
[1:29:34] there was complete peace between them
[1:29:36] and god but what paul is dealing with
[1:29:38] your actions is troubling the body
[1:29:43] and because of that troubling it's
[1:29:45] hindering growth
[1:29:53] now notice this verse 18
[1:29:56] for he that in these
[1:29:58] things
[1:29:59] righteousness
[1:30:02] peace
[1:30:03] and joy
[1:30:04] all three things in the holy ghost in
[1:30:06] these things servant christ is
[1:30:08] acceptable to god
[1:30:10] and approved of men
[1:30:12] so we're the man himself that could
[1:30:14] stand over there and say man why aren't
[1:30:16] you eating meat today
[1:30:18] well i just
[1:30:21] i don't want to offend
[1:30:24] i want to help my brother i want to help
[1:30:26] i don't i don't need that
[1:30:28] what i need is my brother more than that
[1:30:29] piece of meat
[1:30:33] hallelujah i need my sister more than
[1:30:36] that piece of meat
[1:30:38] are you with me talking about appetites
[1:30:40] now
[1:30:42] that fellowship notice where paul is
[1:30:45] getting the focus because that's what
[1:30:47] real true christianity in the heart of a
[1:30:50] believer not only as the word is first
[1:30:52] but with the word being first it also
[1:30:55] eschemes the body
[1:30:57] before itself
[1:31:00] because that's what
[1:31:01] the lord jesus did
[1:31:03] he esteemed
[1:31:05] the body
[1:31:07] he endured
[1:31:10] the cross
[1:31:13] despising the shame thereof for what to
[1:31:16] redeem
[1:31:17] the body
[1:31:21] let us therefore notice follow after
[1:31:24] pursue you know what this speaks you
[1:31:26] know it just shows me right here every
[1:31:27] time we've been reading this follow
[1:31:29] ensue pursue you know what that means
[1:31:31] but this is something we've got to go
[1:31:32] after
[1:31:33] all right that's what it tells me it
[1:31:35] tells me that going after it really has
[1:31:37] to do with samuel getting beyond samuel
[1:31:40] are you hearing me getting beyond self
[1:31:43] or that barrier or that well you know
[1:31:45] this is right or this is right or this
[1:31:47] but it's following after the things
[1:31:50] which make
[1:31:51] for
[1:31:52] peace
[1:31:53] and things where with one may edify
[1:31:57] another
[1:31:59] so paul is dealing with there's the
[1:32:01] wisdom
[1:32:02] to know what things make for peace
[1:32:05] and follow after those things
[1:32:09] to understand that how many can say lord
[1:32:11] i i want to understand that
[1:32:13] right i want to understand that i want
[1:32:15] to further understand that in my home
[1:32:16] i've not i've got everything figured out
[1:32:18] and here i am a doctor's degree no no i
[1:32:20] i'm preaching to myself as well
[1:32:23] i want to know those things that make
[1:32:25] for wisdom
[1:32:28] there are certain times that may not
[1:32:29] even be wrong but there's certain times
[1:32:30] maybe to ask my wife certain questions
[1:32:33] and then there's certain times that
[1:32:36] i know this this may not be the best
[1:32:37] time it has nothing to do oh brother
[1:32:40] samus she may not be under authority
[1:32:41] she's not a doormat
[1:32:43] and neither am i a dictator
[1:32:46] but it's recognizing look at god
[1:32:49] god knows even how to god could have
[1:32:50] came right out of fire david rider with
[1:32:52] bullets but instead watch how god
[1:32:55] approached it in a peaceful way
[1:32:57] there was this man
[1:32:59] and you know
[1:33:01] he sent down there
[1:33:03] there was this other guy had a nice
[1:33:04] sheep
[1:33:05] he sent down and took that lamb he had
[1:33:08] his own but he went and took that one
[1:33:10] what do you think about that
[1:33:12] kill the man
[1:33:16] nathan said
[1:33:18] got it buddy all right you're the guy
[1:33:21] you're the man
[1:33:23] you're the guy right now we're talking
[1:33:24] about what happened peaceably it opened
[1:33:26] him up
[1:33:28] if he would have come in today david
[1:33:30] what in the world are you doing like
[1:33:31] this
[1:33:36] but you see the word comes peaceably
[1:33:39] to open us up
[1:33:41] peace opens us up
[1:33:46] that's why many times when brother brown
[1:33:47] i'll just just go with this right now
[1:33:48] that's why brother graham tells us many
[1:33:50] times he talks about the pastor he never
[1:33:51] said the pastor was the eagle of the
[1:33:52] team
[1:33:55] oh the pastor you know he used to be the
[1:33:57] eagle no the pastor is not the eagle
[1:34:00] he's the ox
[1:34:02] that's right you know what the ox is
[1:34:04] oh it's not something it's oh boy it's
[1:34:07] soaring right now brother bam talks
[1:34:08] about you know the evangelists and the
[1:34:10] prophet and and of course they they have
[1:34:11] their own things that they deal with
[1:34:13] but an ox for the rem tells the ox
[1:34:16] is what he has
[1:34:17] the yoke
[1:34:19] four feet on the ground
[1:34:21] the pastor can only go
[1:34:23] by what's being shown
[1:34:26] god can give him insight
[1:34:28] but the life itself
[1:34:30] will paint the picture
[1:34:33] come on now
[1:34:34] it'll just show because it's four feet
[1:34:36] on the ground on whatever the light the
[1:34:38] fruit that's coming out
[1:34:40] shows whether it's been drawn from
[1:34:42] that's right
[1:34:43] and that's what brother brown talks
[1:34:44] about as a pastor he said patient
[1:34:48] sometimes he said the congregation says
[1:34:50] man why are you hurting up and dealing
[1:34:51] with this
[1:34:55] there's reasons
[1:34:57] i'm not here to explain that or go
[1:34:58] through that but there's reasons for
[1:35:00] that
[1:35:01] waiting for god's timing
[1:35:04] there's reasons for all because why god
[1:35:07] is a god of peace
[1:35:10] and there's times to approach and to
[1:35:12] deal with certain things and everything
[1:35:15] that is number one
[1:35:16] is the body
[1:35:22] in wisdom to understand those things
[1:35:23] that cultivate peace
[1:35:26] let me just try to let me just try to
[1:35:28] rap i'm going to wrap this up here
[1:35:30] so true peace in the home
[1:35:33] you know remember
[1:35:35] a peacemaker is one of god
[1:35:38] but true peace in the home is not one
[1:35:41] person getting their way
[1:35:43] whether it's a son or a daughter not
[1:35:45] with any piece well just let him do that
[1:35:47] man so everything will be at peace no no
[1:35:49] that's not peace that's called war
[1:35:51] that's right
[1:35:52] remember
[1:35:54] satan comes in by flatteries
[1:35:57] right
[1:35:58] the white horse rider come in i can't
[1:36:00] get to that tonight peaceably then what
[1:36:02] does the red horse rider do he comes to
[1:36:04] take peace
[1:36:07] all these things moving
[1:36:09] around and about this is why they're
[1:36:11] saying it doesn't mean we storm right
[1:36:13] out there is times within this part here
[1:36:16] true peace in the home is not one person
[1:36:18] getting their way sometimes where has to
[1:36:20] come this is where i'm making peace
[1:36:22] all right that's him how did he make
[1:36:24] peace
[1:36:25] okay
[1:36:26] how did god make peace with us
[1:36:29] did he send down commandments
[1:36:31] that didn't make peace
[1:36:34] he came himself
[1:36:36] the bible said he is our peace yes amen
[1:36:40] he tore down
[1:36:42] walls of division
[1:36:44] this is the scripture ephesians 2 this
[1:36:47] is him making peace
[1:36:49] tearing down walls things that were
[1:36:51] hindering him and no go zones no gun he
[1:36:54] tore those down
[1:36:55] how by himself
[1:36:58] self coming as our peace
[1:37:01] you see waltz could not have been torn
[1:37:02] down if it was not the god of peace
[1:37:06] but he came down to tear his whole
[1:37:08] purpose in tearing down those walls was
[1:37:10] to reconcile us
[1:37:12] back
[1:37:13] in fellowship
[1:37:16] when we were unlovable
[1:37:31] this is why when brother memory talks in
[1:37:33] greatest boundary fought and he talks
[1:37:34] about looking up into the sky
[1:37:36] and he says you see everything up there
[1:37:38] just moving around you know all the
[1:37:40] stars and the planets and everything he
[1:37:42] said all of that he said i looked in
[1:37:43] there oh everything is in its position
[1:37:46] and when it's in his position you know
[1:37:48] here it is it's it's showing the
[1:37:49] constellations and everything is just
[1:37:51] right and he says i thought of how that
[1:37:54] the beings are in the heavenly and how
[1:37:56] that is to be on the earth
[1:37:58] with the church of the living god
[1:38:02] and he says how he says that if if one
[1:38:04] member
[1:38:05] gets out of order
[1:38:06] it throws the whole thing out of line
[1:38:08] don't you see why the enemy wants to get
[1:38:10] after just one
[1:38:13] true why because if he can get one then
[1:38:15] he can break order sure this is why
[1:38:18] brother rem says we must strive to
[1:38:21] maintain
[1:38:23] the order
[1:38:25] of the spirit
[1:38:27] we must strive
[1:38:29] press
[1:38:31] go it's going beyond ourselves
[1:38:37] let me read this in closing
[1:38:41] galatians 5 14. i'm going to read from
[1:38:44] the amplified version that saved me from
[1:38:45] defining certain things and i just feel
[1:38:47] to read in these verses
[1:38:48] for the whole law
[1:38:50] concerning human relationships
[1:38:53] is complied
[1:38:55] within the one precept you shall love
[1:38:57] your neighbor as you do yourself who's
[1:39:00] my neighbor the one who's in need
[1:39:04] all right
[1:39:06] remember oh yeah brother brian read that
[1:39:08] up here on on sunday that presentation
[1:39:10] remember the one who was real righteous
[1:39:13] i'm like yeah i don't know what i want
[1:39:15] to taint my i don't want to taint my
[1:39:17] walk no they'll taint my life your
[1:39:19] life's already tainted
[1:39:21] it's a bad spirit it's already tainted
[1:39:23] don't matter how righteous is it out
[1:39:25] here
[1:39:26] it's already tainted in here
[1:39:29] you can only give to people what's in
[1:39:30] here not what's out here
[1:39:33] but here comes some here come the
[1:39:35] samaritan around he saw one was in need
[1:39:38] it had nothing to do
[1:39:40] with is this guy a samaritan
[1:39:42] it had nothing to do with
[1:39:45] is he one of my family is had nothing to
[1:39:48] do
[1:39:49] this was his neighbor is one who he saw
[1:39:53] right had a need
[1:39:56] who is my neighbor the one that god
[1:39:59] shows you has a need
[1:40:02] well who might who might that be who god
[1:40:05] shows to you oh i might die oh maybe i
[1:40:07] need to buy shoes and clothes no
[1:40:10] let me tell you what some of the needs
[1:40:11] are sometimes
[1:40:14] healing
[1:40:16] is a necessity
[1:40:17] in our life
[1:40:18] from when we're sick
[1:40:20] we get disease
[1:40:22] we get afflicted
[1:40:24] is that right right
[1:40:26] sometimes a healing
[1:40:28] healing is a process
[1:40:31] is that right
[1:40:33] but there's many ways let me just refer
[1:40:35] to a couple places many ways that god
[1:40:37] heals
[1:40:38] god heals by music how many knows that
[1:40:40] yes
[1:40:42] god heals my music
[1:40:46] god heals by medicine
[1:40:48] notice god heals
[1:40:51] brother braham says god also heals
[1:40:54] by understanding as well
[1:40:57] by reaching out and trying to understand
[1:40:59] of
[1:41:00] you know
[1:41:02] maybe this person's
[1:41:04] why why do you think this way
[1:41:06] why do you feel this way
[1:41:09] god heals by that way
[1:41:11] god heals by love and brother brown puts
[1:41:13] it like this and look away to jesus he
[1:41:16] said
[1:41:16] love he said that stretched
[1:41:20] out
[1:41:21] amen
[1:41:22] where's the longest stretch
[1:41:24] oh in that place that
[1:41:26] we've crucified
[1:41:30] stretch out
[1:41:34] right
[1:41:35] right
[1:41:37] but it's god
[1:41:38] who does the healing you see the god
[1:41:41] inside of you
[1:41:42] that same god that we've been talking
[1:41:44] about
[1:41:45] that has reconciled
[1:41:47] you and me unto himself not just paid
[1:41:49] the price he paid for reconciling before
[1:41:52] you brother gabriel could ever come to
[1:41:54] god
[1:41:56] sister amanda beforehand he already made
[1:41:58] a way
[1:42:00] and you know what he came with the
[1:42:02] gospel of peace you know what the gospel
[1:42:03] of peace is about
[1:42:06] it's already done all right
[1:42:08] it's calling you to what it's the gospel
[1:42:10] of peace
[1:42:11] calling you to peace
[1:42:14] he did that as as the son of god our
[1:42:18] sacrifice our perpetuation that that
[1:42:21] same peace might come into our lives
[1:42:24] that we might be at peace with god and
[1:42:27] be peacemakers one that even in seeing a
[1:42:30] need we lay down our own
[1:42:34] and now you can't help it
[1:42:36] if somebody when you call them
[1:42:38] into the way of peace whether they come
[1:42:40] or not that's not enough for you to
[1:42:41] decide
[1:42:44] you understand it's like if i tell paul
[1:42:46] paul come up on come on up here and
[1:42:47] let's make peace but i want you to walk
[1:42:48] up those stairs and paul walks up these
[1:42:50] deer no no you got to come this way
[1:42:52] there's a way
[1:42:53] there's a way back into fellowship are
[1:42:56] you hearing me
[1:42:57] there's a way
[1:42:58] you have to come the provided way
[1:43:01] you can't just come anyway but you see
[1:43:03] for in our lives we must have
[1:43:07] when we come to god
[1:43:08] god draws us unto himself
[1:43:11] that reconciliation has already been
[1:43:13] made and what's he doing the holy spirit
[1:43:16] is working to reconcile
[1:43:19] to reconcile what has already
[1:43:22] been reconciled
[1:43:24] the debt's been paid now the holy spirit
[1:43:27] comes to seek out those
[1:43:29] who are included in the party
[1:43:31] and to make reconciliation
[1:43:33] real
[1:43:34] praise the lord what does that the peace
[1:43:37] of god so you see to be a peacemaker
[1:43:40] it starts here first
[1:43:42] it starts here first
[1:43:44] and that's where satan
[1:43:47] wants to attack
[1:43:49] he'd love to keep a life separate from
[1:43:52] the peace of god he let me just say this
[1:43:54] he'd love to keep a person in a church
[1:43:57] referring to different things and maybe
[1:43:59] under religious but never ever come to
[1:44:01] the peace of god
[1:44:03] in their own lives that's a dangerous
[1:44:04] situation right
[1:44:06] it's a dangerous situation
[1:44:10] and then
[1:44:12] satan could not hand he could not stop
[1:44:14] those
[1:44:15] how how god has moved and their lives
[1:44:18] have been so changed by the peace of god
[1:44:22] and there's a peace but what he works to
[1:44:24] try to do
[1:44:25] is to try to hinder
[1:44:28] peace
[1:44:29] that's right in our lives
[1:44:31] because you know where there's not peace
[1:44:33] where there's
[1:44:34] turmoil where there's upset
[1:44:37] it's hard to think right
[1:44:40] when satan gets you out of your i see
[1:44:42] your groove
[1:44:43] you're in peace
[1:44:45] it's hard
[1:44:46] to meditate about the things of god
[1:44:50] are you hearing me that's true
[1:44:52] why
[1:44:53] satan's desire is to try to hinder and
[1:44:56] take peace
[1:44:59] well brother samuel i've got the peace
[1:45:01] of god down deep in my soul i thank god
[1:45:04] for that
[1:45:06] but there's many things here i can't get
[1:45:07] to tonight of where satan came in even
[1:45:10] to the prophet's home
[1:45:13] and his wife was filled with the peace
[1:45:15] of god
[1:45:16] but there were times where things came
[1:45:18] to take peace
[1:45:20] couldn't take the peace of god from her
[1:45:21] soul right but tried to take peace from
[1:45:24] the home sure
[1:45:26] and i say tonight
[1:45:28] we're peacemakers
[1:45:30] not compromisers
[1:45:33] all right we are peacemakers
[1:45:36] any ground that the enemy thinks that he
[1:45:38] can have we can just say it tonight
[1:45:41] it's not your ground
[1:45:42] and you can't have it that's right that
[1:45:45] ground is part of the peace treaty
[1:45:52] hallelujah oh let's just pray
[1:45:56] father
[1:46:00] lord thank you
[1:46:02] for your word tonight
[1:46:06] lord i i realize that
[1:46:09] as you've set your word here before us
[1:46:13] is to cultivate our lives
[1:46:17] but lord really you've been
[1:46:19] what you've done you've just reminded us
[1:46:22] of the authority
[1:46:24] that we have as sons and daughters of
[1:46:26] god
[1:46:28] in you
[1:46:31] lord no matter even sometimes we're
[1:46:33] situations and things that
[1:46:36] lord that we come in contact with
[1:46:38] sometimes lord it's just the menial
[1:46:40] tasks
[1:46:42] of life
[1:46:43] that sometimes just get overwhelming
[1:46:49] but father
[1:46:51] you remind us lord of who we are
[1:46:54] remind us of the authority
[1:46:57] that we have in you
[1:47:01] lord i pray that
[1:47:04] if there would be any spirit of
[1:47:06] bitterness or indifference
[1:47:09] in any life or god
[1:47:11] right now father in your presence may it
[1:47:13] just be laid down
[1:47:16] may our heart just say lord i lay it
[1:47:18] down
[1:47:19] i lay it down lord in your presence i
[1:47:21] don't want
[1:47:23] that occupying my life
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:27] i just want the peace of god to flow
[1:47:31] freely in my life
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] what i want to live
[1:47:37] live in that place called to me
[1:47:39] cultivate
[1:47:41] sometimes i'm called to make peace
[1:47:43] [Music]
[1:47:46] lord jesus
[1:47:48] other times we're called to cultivate it
[1:47:50] [Music]
[1:47:54] i think of how that you spoke in your
[1:47:56] word
[1:47:58] you not only said that your sheep
[1:48:00] know your voice
[1:48:03] but you said
[1:48:05] i know
[1:48:06] my sheep
[1:48:07] by name
[1:48:10] i think of that lord when i look at the
[1:48:12] stars david would write under
[1:48:13] inspiration
[1:48:16] how that every star
[1:48:18] has that certain peculiarity about it
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:22] it's a name
[1:48:24] the stars are named by you not man by
[1:48:27] you
[1:48:32] think about it lord of how that even
[1:48:35] where astrologers and different ones
[1:48:36] would even speak of orion and different
[1:48:38] ones that was not man first
[1:48:42] that was you that gave that in the word
[1:48:45] orion who holds the seven stars
[1:48:50] and lord to each one of those we could
[1:48:52] look at them i look at them lord at
[1:48:53] night sometimes on a nice summer night
[1:48:56] was clear outside my they all looked the
[1:48:58] same
[1:49:02] the lord each one of them have a name
[1:49:06] a uniqueness
[1:49:09] lord just as your sheep every one of us
[1:49:11] have
[1:49:12] a uniqueness
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:17] lord sheep
[1:49:19] but all of us have our own
[1:49:21] our temperaments
[1:49:23] make up our makeup
[1:49:25] we all have these lord the parts that we
[1:49:28] have to we deal with
[1:49:30] in our life
[1:49:32] but lord help us
[1:49:35] as lord your prophet would look at it in
[1:49:36] his own life and he would ask you the
[1:49:38] one day when he couldn't hit the
[1:49:39] squirrel in the eye
[1:49:40] and say god why did why am i like this
[1:49:44] and you responded to him and said i've
[1:49:47] made you this way
[1:49:49] for a purpose
[1:49:53] the lord he was all tore up about that
[1:49:56] everything had to be perfect
[1:49:59] he he couldn't enjoy just hitting that
[1:50:01] squirrel anywhere it had to go in the
[1:50:02] eye but you let him know i made you that
[1:50:04] way for a purpose now to think about
[1:50:06] that
[1:50:07] there could be a lot of things in his
[1:50:09] natural
[1:50:11] life
[1:50:12] where he could get tore up about it
[1:50:17] but lord from that moment i just
[1:50:19] happened to believe
[1:50:21] it didn't take away the battle but it
[1:50:22] gave brother branham grace as it would
[1:50:25] give each and every one of us grace to
[1:50:26] realize
[1:50:28] we're put here for a purpose
[1:50:30] even our temperament that yet it must be
[1:50:33] under the leading of the holy spirit
[1:50:36] it must be continually under your
[1:50:38] guidance or god
[1:50:40] or even the very things that you have
[1:50:42] placed within us to serve
[1:50:45] your purpose
[1:50:47] if we get it out on our own
[1:50:49] that's where we get weary that's where
[1:50:52] we get frustrated
[1:50:54] that's where we get down that's where
[1:50:56] peace
[1:50:58] seems like something that oh lord if i
[1:51:00] can just get back there lord help us
[1:51:02] tonight
[1:51:03] help us to
[1:51:04] realize
[1:51:06] the greatest
[1:51:09] the greatest privilege that we have
[1:51:12] and for every battle for every situation
[1:51:16] is that we would take our lives into the
[1:51:17] presence of god
[1:51:19] sometimes lord i know i know i'm
[1:51:21] speaking to believers here tonight
[1:51:23] i know how it is they do too
[1:51:26] the times the lord god won't get in to
[1:51:28] pray
[1:51:29] sometimes lord in prayer just don't have
[1:51:30] the words to say
[1:51:33] sometimes lord with even maybe things
[1:51:35] that's going on
[1:51:37] and it just it feels like things are
[1:51:39] closing in
[1:51:41] my we would give anything to have that
[1:51:43] rushing that moves in and oh my just
[1:51:46] feeling so uh

[1:52:31] peace himself down in the depths of our
[1:52:33] soul
[1:52:34] by the holy ghost
[1:52:37] sometimes lord

[1:52:43] in that spirit realm
[1:52:45] flesh
