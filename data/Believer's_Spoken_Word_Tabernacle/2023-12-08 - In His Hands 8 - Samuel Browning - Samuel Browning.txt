for your glory Lord Glory oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen hallelujah [Music] praise the name of the Lord amen I want to um just mention to you very very quickly um so brother Josh and sister Sharon they they weren't here on Sunday but they did arrive but everything when they when they remember they were supposed to arrive on Friday night and uh they didn't end up getting here till Saturday U I think it was Midday or right after that so we're thankful for that you know sure there's been little bumps along the road but um we're just thankful to the mercy of the Lord they ran into some things there when they landed in Boston and but anyhow God Made A Way and uh you know their bags they what it was every one of their bags uh were missing and uh so but the Lord just so mercifully just just moved for brother Jos and sister Sharon and know God just just moving on the scene on Sunday uh while uh you all would have been in the midst of the service is when I I'd got a text when I was getting out of the morning service where I was at that they just had got their bags all five of them so we thank God for that and so you know just just one testimony after another but we are so looking forward to uh uh seeing them and I want to with that in mind just kind of make mention to you uh there brother Josh way has they've you know plann something out for I believe it is December 30th right now he just confirmed this with me later today they moved it back and it's just a a gathering that they're are going to have and to invite all of the uh brothers and sisters from the church there's obviously some friends that they have that he has over there in Cleveland that is uh congales and uh the main thing I I I'm saying this and expressing it to you and I will say it again is because I think one of the things that we can never underestimate is the is the value of reaching out and welcoming someone absolutely I know it's true that I don't I'm not going to I'm not I don't I'm not trying to put on any hardship on anyone but sometimes I think that our thoughts have to go beyond ourselves sometimes and so you know I think it would be a very good thing as brother joshu and sister Sharon coming here the purpose was that brother Josh what he had extended you know it's a it's a wonderful time for them and uh an opportunity to be able to just talk with sister Sharon get a chance to get acquainted uh with her they're going to be sojourning here and I think that's a part of it that uh would be very good for us so that'll be on December the 30th and um so didn't reive a lot of amens on that but I want to make you aware of that sir you know uh so I I think that would be very good we sometimes the things that we in that part of it what's so important and I I'll tell you one thing that I love to see as a pastor I love to see that first of all when I hear and I I relay it to you you have ministers that come and stand here and relay it but then I have it in the back office then I have it later on of the of the the the commendations that are made regarding the love among the people the receptiveness among the people for the word of God that's right and I I really I appreciate that because that's that's what God has done that's who he is and I every time time when a minister stands here I said look we're just simple people we believe this message with all of our heart just preach the word just just just preach you you obey the Lord I I don't have nothing wrote on there don't go here don't go there CU I've Got Confidence the men of God I've invited in here they they they know their boundaries they know where things just like when I go other places I don't try to Pastor people when I go other places but I got confidence in God's leading that's right amen and I I want to see I want to see God's people helped yes and uh and so I'm so thankful for that so I also want to say that the other part of it is it goes beyond that is when you know I think it ought to be that when we have a visitor or visitors here it should not be left unnoticed to where we don't know their name that first begins with the deacons and then it travels all the way through to where it's something and I've watched different ones of you when I've been out here at the Times where purposely you walk over and you greet those who are strangers right and uh you know people that come into our midst and uh I think it's always good to be friendly and uh you know and I so I appreciate that with all my heart I know I know others do and so we never know friends we don't we never know of the life that we're going that is going to be touched by God but I'll say it like this right here we know it has to be God to touch a life it has to be God to position a life in the body but you and I are also called channels too that's right in order for that electricity as it comes from that pole goes back to that box there are wires throughout this building the brothers the brothers when they went through and were doing all this extra lighting in here you know how much more wiring I can't even just here alone and in the back that was run Brother Carlos would probably know off the top of his head but I mean a massive amounts of wiring but it doesn't matter how much electricity is here if you don't have a wire to connect One Source to another that's what we want to be we want Lord I just want to be a channel that you can flow through amen a channel that you can use that's where my concern is for is for his body amen so I just want to just encourage you in that and um just as we get ready to turn to the word and I want to say God bless you so so thankful for your prayers while we were away there on Sunday in services and the Lord was just so mindful of us and so we I just want to say thank you and we're so glad to be back home and um so let's stand if we could um I always feel like I'm missing some announcement if I could remember announcements like I can remember the word but I guess if I have my DS but uh some of you already know where we're going job 23 but I want to if God will help us here tonight I want to uh I want to try to tie this up here on uh with in his hands and getting into this place tonight so I in order to maybe to get to some points of it's not that I feel like I want to rush but I've got just a thought that I want to uh really work with here tonight um so in his hands and if I had a subth thought for it you can kind of keep in the back your mind is and I it is a secret work being revealed openly a secret work being revealed openly in job 23:8 job said behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him and on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him and He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him remember we looked at it last week his right hand that through all things it's necessary of that experience that we have with God and it is his hand that is holding us through it all and it is his hand that is is working and molding and shaping Our Lives even in many of these times like what job is expressing that we have no idea what is taking place what is being worked out but what's important is is he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing but he knoweth the way that I take verse 10 when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold and my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandment of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to read another portion of scripture out of Philippians chapter three to kind of tie in with this and setting the background as we're looking at this the left hand and the right hand Paul would say it like this but what things were gained to me in verse 7 those I counted lost for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but Dum that I may win Christ I just just to pause there for a moment if if I could say it in this way this this portion of scripture that we're reading it's like sitting under an oak tree where a life that has has come through many much of the journey and yet you find that within that this expression is Paul's expression is is that I want to go deeper I want to know him more and you begin to get a glimpse of how that Paul is living his life that Paul is living his life in a much uh deeper more mature way in the Lord and that is dealing with uh not so much of what is lawful and what's unlawful but dealing with what whatsoever things were gained to me if it was if it was something that was just to bring edifying to me or a furtherance to me and if that's all that it is then I don't I'm not interested in that the only thing I'm interested in is the furtherance of Christ in my life I'm interested in the furtherance of his word now I I don't believe that Paul was saying in there you know don't look for uh to put in for a promotion on your job that's not Paul was saying but Paul was saying let everything that I've learned to evaluate everything in that is this going to hinder the work of the Lord in my life or is it going to further the work of the Lord in my life CU sometimes the things that are spoken or said is you know if I can just get this job or if I can just do this my I'll be able to serve God more and sometimes sometimes the things that we look at just with reasoning it actually becomes a trap and an ensnarement and we find ourselves actually being tied up more instead of being more free that's why we need a discernment that goes beyond our reasoning we need we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit and also we learn these things as we go on we learn this within our life my wouldn't it be wonderful if we could just read this here tonight and say from this point on there'll not be another mistake that I'll make I don't have a song on this but I'm thinking of a title dream on verse n and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith I want you to watch this verse in verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings see notice right hand and left hand the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended ended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before and I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus let me just say it like this what Paul is recognizing is don't become encumbered with all your past failures right that's right because you can't move forward you have to receive the Forgiveness of the Lord his or Grace and overcoming and saying I'm going to look forward because if you look backward you're going to end up veering off the road you've got to keep your eyes on the prize and that's what Paul is saying I've learned to forget those things in the past Paul had received a real forgiveness from the Lord in other words the image of Stephen no longer haunted him that's now Paul now brother Ram tells us that what Paul saw there with stepen drove Paul to a place to where Paul even when he was forbidden to go to Jerusalem Paul said I'm going anyhow because Paul remembered was where stepen stood as a martyr and that had an effect on his life the rest of the day I don't believe that effect was that Paul walked around in defeat but it had an effect because Paul could see what he had I have also experienced is that right so here we're looking to what before us you you can never get anywhere with looking behind you you always got to go forward this is why brother Bram would use that over and over and I actually knew a brother here in the assembly that his rearview mirror he never used it he took that quote to another level he spun that rearview mirror and never used it you know well I use my rearview mirror that's right you know I know they we got all these camera Gadgets in the car but I still use my mirror the cameras are all right when I'm getting close to a bumper but other than than that my mirrors is what I like so there's a time to you see from the rear of view mirror you can see where you've come from but you can't drive by looking in the rearview mirror is that right this is why the scripture said looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen so then we look here in the scripture I want to draw from this this the scripture here in verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings be being made conformable unto his death this word conformable I want to just draw from this I I got to looking at at this here and this word it means to render like that is figuratively to assimilate or to make conformable unto to be conformed or received the same format so when things are are being assimilated are not things that are happening rapidly that's right you see this is why even as we come and we're setting under the word of God it's us sometimes we're the ones who get impatient but what's important is is that your lives are assimilating to the word that there is there is that which is not just accommod it's not accommodating but it's where it's assimilating little by little by little there is change taking place now remember everybody's journey is different yet it is the same it's a journey from Death unto life it's a journey from birth unto maturity but within the whole process this conformability is not something that we receive as a gift character is not a gift that's right it's a victory is that right there is an and to things to assimilate this is why that even there is the effect of the word that we are under and I'm just to you know let me just flow with this just a moment this is why brother brand could say over and over when in power of transformation of how he says that the Earth itself became a a beautiful watered Garden of Eden because it obeyed the word of God and came over around the Sun what happened it assimilated it moves sometimes the things that we maybe don't see but so you know what's hard for us to think back on is how that God begin dealing with our lives little by little by little there were things no doubt that God was working in our lives before we ever darken the church that's right or maybe you were raised in the message like I was but there were things that all of a sudden God begins to deal with our lives little by little by little there's things taking place why you see that's why this life this this Water of Life that we have in this hour it is only the water of the word that we have that will bring a rotting condition and break down that outer man in order that that germ of Life can come forth on the inside there's no other gospel there's because this is the only true gospel anything else will leave a man in his conditions and his sins and he might be a little bit better here a little bit better here but it's only the Water of Life that brings forth New Creation you say what do I mean by assimilate well one of the words to assimilate is to absorb and the prophet says in spoken word's Original Seed he said brother brandham if you're saying the world's rejecting it then why are you still preaching this word he said because if there's a son and daughter of God that's out there when they hear this word and absorb it it will transform their lives you're built to absorb it you're built to assimilate and this is assimilating conforming unto his death right so it's not something it's not something that's being molded overnight neither is it something that's being done openly it's things that God is working in the midst of our lives and I want you just to think of this this scripture BR pull that in Philippians 3:10 on the Amplified version I want to read this for my determined purpose is that I may know him that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with him how many say that's my desire that's I don't want to just be sitting around say I made it right amen no my desire is to know him more true and to and intimately acquainted with him perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of his person more strongly and more clearly and that I may in the same way come to know the power outflowing from his resurrection which exerts over Believers and that I may so share his sufferings to be continually transformed in spirit into his likeness even to his death amen think of it what the world and what Satan thought was the greatest as far as on Satan's kingdom was the greatest victory was when he was able to secure the Lord Jesus and take him to Calvary and the crucifixion to take place he felt the same way with Abel felt the same way with all of them down through time in each one of them he saw that light he saw that that part but notice here it comes to the very end of the life of the Lord Jesus and here he stands one of the most glorious moments is nevertheless not my will thine will be done this where it's coming to to that place and it wasn't notice this was a place that it wasn't in the midst of a crowd he went off a distance left his disciples and went off a distance without them right went a little further and he prayed three times even come back to wake him and say could you not stay awake with me right and one of the things that he mentions during that time regarding everything the flesh is weak but the spirit is willing we could stay in Fellowship on that tonight but we all know that's the truth the flesh is weak the flesh don't ever get any stronger right even when we come out of a wonderful service your flesh though your flesh maybe you know you feel uh joyful but it in the flesh that's getting that way maybe sickness has been lifted from your body but the real benefit of it is the Son and Daughter of God has been further authorized and strengthened on the inside because just given a little bit of time and this man on the outside and how the attack will come and want to try to Cave into it and maybe start filling down a little bit but that which is on the inside has been strengthened and nourished and buil up in the things of God but this this part here I I love the right hand of God all the power of his resurrection if not for the power of the Resurrection then where would we be without a real experience with God where would we be there is no character molding but now also Paul says and the fellowship of his sufferings now when we preach on the fellowship of his sufferings that's not you usually a moment that maybe would be all together like shouting the house down but I'll tell you what I've experienced that through each part of my journey there's times where I come through certain times and to understand God is a god of Seasons oh that's good that's real good he's a god of Seasons yes he is there's dry seasons wet Seasons Hot Seasons cold all the seasons and it's all a law of contrast that allows appreciation but I'll tell you what I found I have found such strength and such encouragement when a word has come when in the midst that I'm dealing with something going through something something right here in my life and how God will take and separate a man of God and things will be spoken in that hour God doesn't remove the trial but God's letting me know hey I'm with you that's right that's he does take me out of it but what is it there's a time of Fellowship it's a fellowship in his sufferings you know why notice the fellowship ship of his sufferings oh this all right it ain't about this is not about me going off on my own and then claiming well I'm suffering for the Lord no The Fellowship of his sufferings is Walking In step with his word that's exactly what it is it's Walking In step with his word and then notice in order we're not being punished suffering is not punishment suffering is so that the word might live in our lives hallelujah hallelujah oh I would love it if I came to the house of God and man just right away my someone is ministering man here comes the word now made flesh in my life no suffering but that's not how it happens it's true the word speaks to the Inner Man the Son and Daughter of God but we cannot and we will not as the Bride of Jesus Christ bypass trials and suffering as a matter of fact the prophet said in the samian age he says in plain language the very character of Jesus Christ was perfected through suffering and he has left his church a measure of suffering that we also with by suffering and having our faith in him will come to a place of perfection that's so good amen yes sir Hallelujah so these are a time as the word working in our lives in Matthew 6 I had these scriptures down but I I don't want to take and and and deal with the time to read the entirety of the scripture but all in Matthew 6 it starts out with first of all when you're doing Ms that means good deeds for others don't walk around and sound a trumpet hey everybody can I have your attention I'm going to give them $20 all right now there's a key in here it says don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing in other words you know it's saying be like God cuz there's times that God is working God's doing things in our life that we don't know what's going on that is true that's a real Godlike characteristic then he goes on further into this here he's talking about the secret that that part where the Delight it's just it's just unto the Lord let me read these two verses of scripture here out of Matthew 6 this is remember what the angel of the Lord referred the prophet too with that of the third pull and the furtherance of his ministry and let me just say it when we as we're reading this here in verse 5 it's all about with the opening of the word it's all about Christ on the scene a very a summary of it is you are the Tabernacle of the Living God you are his Dwelling Place amen that's what it's all about Christ coming in to bride form then let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come it's Christ now United in an invisible Union hallu this is why it might be a little bit ahead but this is why when the scripture says in Revelations 88 when and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven why because he come down the fullness of his Spirit the fullness of his presence that's why we are worshiping the lamb the angels are the Angels why is it silence because he's come down that's so good I know you understand understand what I'm saying the Corporal body is still there I'm talking about in the fullness of his word he has stepped forward the lamb himself was standing there in Jeffersonville holding the open book and the reality of it is the open book wasn't so much the prophet's Bible but the open book it's Christ himself standing in the midst of his people that's the whole seven seal the coming of the Lord Christ coming in you the House of Prayer this is why the angel of the Lord would take the prophet and brother BR said he's always scriptural in everything he says to me and he told him and said this will not be a public show that's right as a matter of fact he said you'll not explain this to anybody amen this is why when when we could listen to and I'll just say we because we've all been there listening to the seven seal message of what is it what is it and the prophet is standing there and he starts from way back here in the beginnings of the ministry and takes us clear up to where it is right now God and that whole part in the seven seal it's a walk on the road to emus it's showing that it's been him all along sir remember when Gesa was troubled oh oh look at all these enemies and Elisha said Lord open his eyes that he can see there's more with us than there is against us brother bam said God never brought the Angels down down he only loosened the seeing of his servant to see what was always [Applause] there oh don't you love the Lord yes sir oh is God working in Simplicity in a many membered body it's God operating through your life through your life see when we would speak the coming of the lord it's almost like and forgive me for saying like this but it's almost like thoughts of G in Gold but no such Simplicity such humility how God would so cond incend among a people and reveal himself and it's with a purpose remember that as he come to that place now the Bride of Jesus Christ is coming to being made conformable unto his death now I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure that there there's things that you've went through I've went through or are going through that we never would have signed up for no that's true we wouldn't have it's just the truth we wouldn't have that's right true right there's sometimes where there's PL times I remember one time uh years ago I got off on roads I thought my you know it's when you had to use the Rand mcnali Maps um we'll tell the young people what that is later but um you know where you had to plan your journey I thought man man this is a short route from here to here I'm going to take that route H I took that route and was in the early morning hours oh my the roads got narrow I was around mountains winding and where was this at on the map what I thought was a shortcut ended up taking me a longer time if I had just stayed on the major highway cuz it's sure went in the scenic route it was dark right right you know you know you're in the country when you're on a narrow road and you got to drive around and underneath you know big knobby tires of trucks and things like that you know some of you get that later I would have never taken that route right never would there's there's things along about even in our journey we would have never have signed up for but listen it's not saying that everything was a predestinated moment there are some things yes there were decisions that we made that we've had to learn from and God has given us Grace but yet there are things along the way that God knows we had to go through and have to go through in order to be made conformable unto his death so very true that's right my I said I was going to read this scripture Matthew 6:5 let me just read these two when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy clauset and when thou Hast shut the door pray to the Father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly I want you just to think of it in this in these terms then throughout the entirety of this chapter 6 I'm not going to read the whole entirety of it but this is what I want you to extract from that it's it's a walk of Faith because as it goes into the very next verses are of uh of of the The Lord's Prayer thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven then the next Scriptures it says uh forgive us our debt as we forgive our debtors see it's dealing with this is a a secret work it's God working there's things there's channels there's areas in our lives that sometimes we're even unaware that God this channel needs to be worked on that's so good but God sees our heart's desire is to please him so God brings us to that place to where our will is melded and surrendered to him because in his presence listen God does not come with his presence to intimidate his children right God does not show up with his might to cause his children to move back that's an Unholy fear but the presence of God it brings a reverence to know that he is near amenu he's my father he's here to he's here to move on my behalf he's here to strengthen me he's here to encourage me so he's seeking so it's submitting ourselves to him continuously seeking the help of the Holy Spirit to uncover all things or anything that would hinder his further working in our life to the most minute little fox to where secret sins no longer have a dominion over us to where all hurts and even the deepest of things working under the surface that prevent a real deep working of the Holy Spirit and his outworking in our lives is cleared out no wonder the prophet could say over and over over in perfect strength we need a fresh killing he said the Tabernacle needs one and I need one with it Hallelujah then he speaks of the oncoming Ministry of Elijah the furtherance he said oh God I need a further killing brother Brandon would ask for a refilling of the holy ghost images of Christ he says I want another refilling so I can be more of a servant like he was wow it has nothing to do with our feeling it has everything to do with to being more of a servant I I need more of him and I'll tell you right now I need more of him I I I need more of him to be more of a servant like he was more of that that channel those channels flowing through our lives I I think of it the more that I've looked at some of the you know the different videos and things of the Hamas tunnels and the network good Lord have mercy I said these people are tunnel rats I mean there's tunnels everywhere I don't know how they even have anything on the ground when you see the complexity of it but you know what the reality of it is is when I look at them tunnels that's nothing compared to like the channels in our lives and yet God himself goes right down and God's not putting SpongeBobs in our channels oh no that's true but I'll tell you what I'm glad that God will flood them he'll flood us with his presence what is it doing what what does that flood what does that Revival of the spirit of God do it washes out trash amen it's called moving down even in the the depths of our life sometimes Revival isn't altogether things that we can see on the surface there's things that God can start right here in a service and there's things that are going on and that things will take place in your in your life and God's working things out in our life listen do not contain Revival to a service Revival is not your favorite song on the piano Revival is not the favorite notes on the organ a Revival is a walk with God as a matter of fact the prophet said and how can I overcome we must never let the SP Spirit of Revival die Among Us that's true he said we must stay in the life the whole time amen keep life in you that's overcoming that's good preaching Hallelujah yes sir oh God flood every channel of my life amen hallelujah I just say it like this God is working here and there's a woman on earth if I can read first Timothy y 2:1 the Bible speaks let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection I will not suffer a woman to teach nor to abser authority over the man but to be in silence I look at that scripture I I'm not just looking in the natural but I'm looking at that as as a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ that's good where the Bri light of Jesus Christ is hidden away and she's coming under the word learning in silence but brother Samuel I I love just said that all Heaven is silent cuz he's here and we're in the time of worship oh but our silence is not a silence in the secret place but we've entered into the secret place and the curtains have dropped behind us to silence every other voice right good preaching are you hearing me yes well it's a time of silence for the world wonder what God says about this wonder what God thinks here wonder what this scripture mean what about this but in this hour the silence was broken God's thoughts concerning his word god thoughts concerning you where you have looked and said like Sarah Abraham did he say anything about me no not today did he say anything about no no not today did he say no not today did he say anything no not today then finally Abraham came back in the camp one day he said Sarah I've got a message from Elohim with you in it he said by Sarah you're going to have a son and he's the one my Covenant is with silence was Broken Hallelujah and God promised he would visit Sarah and he did Bible visited Sarah and performed just exactly what he said he did secret work in the tent that's right but here it became openly revealed that's right Isaac came forth you know what Isaac means laughter where the devil has tormented you what God does in your life you can turn around and laugh at him what look what God's done in my life look how God has changed my life look how God has turned my life around look at the promise I was looking for but God has strengthened me you are the one who gets the last [Applause] laugh no wonder Paul's cutting up when he's leading 1 Corinthians 14:34 I want to just drop these for few more verses and then I want to just just just pivot here for the last few moments let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak now obviously we we understand what Paul's talking about that the sisters are not getting up and taking a text and preaching it ain't talking about sitting there without worshiping I mean you Worship in your own way right you know if you're not a shouter okay you're a shouter shout I mean but but what it's saying we understand what it's saying here but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and if they they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church aren't you glad that you have access right to your husband right you don't have to come through a pastor God uses pastors it's true God uses men but this relationship is between you and him personally that's what the whole preaching of the word is all about not for you to become attracted to a man's personality but the whole preaching of the word is that our relationship with Christ would be deepened am we would be challenged in our lives like I read that scripture what Paul had said I want to know him deeper I want to know him more so while the world they're becoming numb the sad reality the ignorance of the working of the Lord and his people people I want you to think how many live in this community around us and don't recognize yet God is preparing a people for a Rapture it's a work that's being done in secret yet it's being openly declared through your life that is God is still working Brother Sam how can that be because you're being caught away from the things of the world that's so good and and and and it shows itself What's Done in secret is displaying openly that's so good what what kind of church are you a part of or what are you a part of see and then there's things where sometimes they're not even asking to say I notice there's a light around you uh would you would you mind to request prayer in church for so and so understand it's it's because in our lives though we walk in this world we're not of it our lives are are caught away our souls are caught away we're living in this life yes let thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven reflecting Heaven here on Earth I want to just just skip to this place here right here tonight and I want to go to the scripture in Psalms 105 and verse 19 and I know you can you can read all of this but I just want to hit just a couple moments on the life of Joseph in this scripture I want you to Psalms 105: 19 I think Bri and I gave you everything there but uh I just go to verse 19 until the time that his word came whose word God's word concerning Joseph that's good pre see it was God's word but once he gives it to Joseph it's Joseph's word that's right like when brother Bram Tex us he says when God said uh that you're your seed will bruise the head of the serpent he said see he said the woman has no seed but when God gives it to her it's her seed then so until the time that his word came the word of the Lord Tried Him on through the scriptures and I I know I referred to this last week I you can read it when you get home but in if you go through in Genesis 39 you find how that over and over and and this to me maybe I'm just a simple guy but these are things that have stood out to me over the time of here is Joseph he sold into slavery now we know it's a type but yet here he receives this this dream 17 years old when he receives this dream but he has no idea what he's going to have to go through in order for it to come to pass that's right it so oh it just must be time no it wasn't about time it was about God preparing Joseph for his word to come to pass through his life that's true and so God knows every Avenue every Network our channels and God is going to work all listen work all things to the place to where Joseph or you or me cannot glory in anything but him and so over and over in the scriptures what I I'm just drawn to and you can read this in in in Genesis 39 maybe when you are home over the next few days but this to me just it meant everything to me when I you know I'm looking at this of how the Bible would say even in the verse two and the Lord was with Joseph you'll find that repeated in the scriptures now look the Lord was with him Brother Carlos in in in a in a way of thinking before of what things sometimes that we look at when things are happening like what was happening with Joseph Joseph here he's not done anything to his Brethren but that we can see outwardly but yet here all of this God's getting everything lined up getting everything in position Joseph doesn't know what's taking place but what he does know is God has spoke to me and when God says it God ain't going to lie Hall I don't know what's taking place I don't know what's going to happen but I know this word is going to come to pass it may not come to pass the way I thought it was going to come to pass but it's going to come to pass the way God thought it when he spoke it and delivered it in my heart so what's he doing Joseph well if Joseph could come here tonight and stand up he could say to you and I God had to work out Joseph in order for God's word to be be fulfilled through [Music] Joseph remember remember when we look at Joseph's life brother br will continue to say this he said you only found one scratch against Joseph remember when he said to his Brethren he don't don't tell him your Shepherds tell them your herdsman right but over and over through the scriptures saying I love that the Lord was with him this is not just one time over and over through Genesis 39 and the and where Joseph was at the Lord blessed right I never forget I was just a young boy brother Bill you remember this you remember when brother Lonnie Jenkins came we were over there in the and brother Lonnie came and he taught on Joseph just a little boy I don't know how long young I was but brother Jo brother Lonnie he began to take this right here and there were people in the assembly at the time without jobs is that right different ones you remember different ones I like even even Keith was without one but brother Lonnie begin to pre begin to speak this and he said look he said when God has a work in an area he said God will bless that area and Bless the people with work he said because for his kingdom now I'm just quoting but I'm looking at not because I'm saying well I'm going to quote brother Lonnie I'm looking at the word and what I see is that God did not bless Pharaoh's house or Piper's house because it was Piper or Pharaoh God blessed it because Joseph was there Hall yes sir and I just say this right here I know we all can stand and agree and sometimes when doors close that's very difficult but but the same God who permits a door to be closed is the same God that opens another door you say how do you know that because he said I am the door he never said that I'm the dead end I'm the door any man that comes by me shall go in and out and find pasture amen that's a promise and I'm in his fold I'm one of his sheep I'm not made my own he's my shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not [Applause] want Hallelujah the Lord was with [Applause] Joseph now when I read these scriptures here I I see how it says in in in here at the end of verse six and it says and Joseph was a goodly person and well favored it had to have been that even though Joseph might have been going through times where he would cry cuz brother Braham said in Christ the mystery in that dungeon he suffered sure he suffered sure the Lord was with him yeah and he suffered think about remember the principle we're going through a test or trial we come out stronger but who's being strengthened and who's being deprived the inner man is being strengthened that's why Paul said though are outward men perish our inward man is renewed day by day why we need a fresh experience every single day though I don't know what's going on though I don't know how everything is going to take place but get out of your tent and go get Mana for the day go look to the Lord Lord I'm holding your word I'm standing on your promise I don't anything moving I don't hear anything right now but Lord I know you're working let me come back to that I'm just going to skip to this point right here and come back to this I want you to think of this you realize this let me just refer to this point each day the sun evaporates a trillion tons of water water is the only substance on Earth naturally found in three elements solid liquid gas think about it and yet as brother Brandon would say that over and over he'll say it like this in the message perseverant 1962 he says see he says we in American people we're always looking for something big bright and God don't do it something we're looking for something noisy he said God can draw more water with the sun in 5 minutes then we can pump out of a noisy pump in 40 days that's so good yes sir do you hear it right did you hear the evaporation now listen friends God's not against we're not we're not talking about or against noise but I'm talking about in the midst of our times where the left hand is working and job said I can't see him but yet you didn't see you did not hear the evaporation taking place today right but there was over a trillion tons of water that has been evaporated off of the Earth today yes sir what do you think about your life brother Samuel what did does that have to do with my life well you'll see in coming Services where God makes known to job job what I've been doing in your life and God takes him through the natural processes of life Hallelujah and let's him see all of these things that you look at with Seasons it's talking about your life all you talk about with the with the storms coming up the water evaporating the clouds it's about your life God takes job on a journey oh my sometimes you wish it could just the word of the Lord is so is so rich yes it it's encouraging to us I don't know about you it's encouraging to me it it it strengthens me God knows just what I need at this moment but here's what let me just let me just bring it down to this place I I want to read out of the message of prisoner uh there's a few other quotes I could read but I don't I don't need to read them here this could all be captured within this point even in the book of Acts acts 7:9 here it says it also regarding Joseph God but God was with him I think that's important we could read you could read your test read your trial read things are going on but I like the next part but God is with you but God is with you so all this is here in the front but God is with you Hall and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom that that word delivered means it's a word to root out so every time you know it wasn't God just oh no get him out of the prison get him out of here no Joseph had to stay in prison for periods of time that's right then God God [Music] said it's going to have to be a little bit more rubbed out of his life I got to let a false accusation come his way I got to let a lie be told on him and Piper's wife right right falsely accuses him right and he goes to prison and then the Butler and the baker wow the baker you know the dream that happened yeah right and you think the butler I wonder how many times the Joseph said I wonder if that guy forgot about me right right you know what it was God sealed his memory until the appointed time that's amen and at the right time oh that's right because why it was at that time that the gift in his life was needed amen that's so good yes sir so let me read this quote out of message a prisoner brother BR says in paragraph 167 I I want to just go through these parts and we're and then I'm finished he said I want to get to another character he says I see one by the name of Joseph he was an elected yeah he was an elected son he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ born a prophet a prophet and now he could see a vision when he was yet a little boy he saw a vision of himself sitting on a throne and his brothers bowing to him this last statement right here this this is a statement just pondered just looked at for years he felt like like he was a great guy yeah you see it took a prophetic eye that's right to see down there in Joseph in one of them tunnels ah little bit of Pride you feel like you're a great guy God said I'm not going to share my glory that's right with nobody so we got to root that out great point and I'm going to get you in position where I need you to be see God says see sometimes we're interested in ah I can get it out of this circumstance get out of this and God takes the very circumstances the things of life and uses them as we'll submit to him to work out things in our lives absolutely and yet it's not the oh my I'm not walking on water no but there's water being evaporated oh but look what brother said what did God have to do he had to do the same thing he did to the rest of them because Moses was a deliverer Paul was a deliver how Joseph was to deliver he saved his people from the famine what did God have to do to him he put him in prison put him right straight to the prison remember he was sold by his Brethren to an Egyptian and they sold him to Piper and Piper gave him a little bit of Liberty and the first thing you know that was taken from him man there's a lot could preach here and there he set in the prison what's that say crying crying God had to strip it all the time he was in prison listen this is what's important all the time he was in prison Joseph got on Facebook and let everybody know the [Applause] conditions come on friends sometimes I understand we talk with one another and sometimes there's things that we listen this isn't anything of shaming but I hope you understand that some of the times when we come into that moment right there jph himself while he was in prison God was stripping him down it's what you're looking to in those moments that matters it matters listen this is how honest I would be and I'm telling you as I would be because I Am Lord forgive me for my complaining help me Lord oh help me oh yeah why cuz complaining weakens Faith right yes sir oh oh my now listen if I get home tonight or have some other time and I have to and my back or my hip is hurting me I don't say hey honey I I tell you what when my hip is hurting me or my back is hurting me and she don't look at me and say shame on you Son of God you ought to speak to that thing no no that ain't complaining that just means you know what I need a nice comfy chair to sit down in maybe a little bit of Molin and maybe you know a tortilla with some ham and cheese in it so I can take the maybe that ain't real spiritual but that ain't complaining that's right complaining is where we're going and just talking and talking and talking and talking that's right he could remember that the vision said that he was going to sit on a throne and his brothers was going to bow to him because he knew that his gift come from God and he knew it had to come to pass my goodness this is powerful if we could only keep that in our mind and according to the word of God that in these last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these things that he promised he's going to do it he said he would and we're living in the time we're there he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now locked in with him Ram says you heard the old song then I'm shut in with god oh I said I want to be shut in with God it's where I thought about this being shut in with God nothing else you only move When God Says move you only do as God says do then you're shut in with God now watch this I know it's a long it's a long quote but I'm I'm getting down there I'm getting down there brother Bram says look he says he was thinking he became a total failure to himself all that he knew all that he understood and everything he become a total failure it didn't work he was put under a situation to where that nobody would listen to him he was a prisoner he was put in a situation unbelievers would not even believe his ministry was of none effect the people turned their head they wouldn't pay attention to him in prison what good would his ministry do now if you'll realize this in this quote brother brandham is also talking about where he's standing presently yeah that's right cuz he's just preached standing in the Gap and through this whole month of July he's continuing to request prayer that God would help me to be more humble to gain the feeling back for the people what good would his ministry do he might stand to the prison bars and preach to him walk up and down the street but he became a prisoner and God kept him a prisoner until the will got rolled up right and then he said here's my man brother Braham said Glory total failure finally God came to him in his prison like Paul and the rest of him he used I love this I love this statement he used the gift that he had give him to get him out of there what do you think is going to get you and me out of Satan's Eden is the gift that he's placed in our life what gift is that that soul that come from God the quickening power on the inside we have been raised up from Death unto life so what is it that not only getting us in a Rapture but in every situation of life it's yielding to the inside man it's yielding to the inner man it's yielding to the Lord and saying God work out every bit of feeling of greatness feeling of greatness see sometimes greatness itself isn't all together where we look at and say well I drive this better than this and I drive this better than this but sometimes just the thoughts that can move through a life can be well I'm a more of a Christian than they are let me just tell you what that's called Pride that's good sure everybody looks better in their own homemade mirror everybody's got their favorite mirror the one that makes them look like this size when they're right everybody looks good in their own sight but I want to know how I look in his sight that that's that's that that's what I'm interested in that right there keeps me busy right there my burden is for everybody but that keeps me busy let's stand there's a lot more to that quote but out of a message prisoners right towards the very end brother Bram I think one of the key things brother Bram said he constantly remembered he was born for a purpose I think oh oh God this is the thing to remember in the midst of tests and trials to remember that we've been born for a purpose God's got a purpose we're still here he's not finished with us yet brother Bram said in this part of it he said before his vision could be completely fulfilled he had to become a prisoner and then he could become a ruler when he come from prison house he become a prisoner to the word of God and only would say what God would put in his mouth then God moved through him I wonder about this vision of the word that we're we're under this vision is clear the Bible brother BR would refer to this out of habac he' refer to it when he's talking about Joseph here in Christ the mystery that we know that the vision must surely come to pass I believe it is I believe the vision is living out absolutely I I believe that I'm not I'm not looking for something way off down the line I believe I believe it's working out in our lives and I believe the real as the word is working through our lives as the word goes down and moving through the tunnels and the channels through our lives you know Israel has things that they'll go right over the Earth right over that of Gaza and they can detect just with that equipment that they have be able to detect that there's tunnels underneath they can detect that how much more does God himself know what lays beneath the surface in our life absolutely well you might say well brother Samuel I don't have nothing hidden from God I'm not saying that you do that's right because you know if you hide anything you won't Prosper but I look at another scripture where David would ask Lord do not let presumptuous sins have dominion over me you know what presumptuous is prideful don't let them have dominion over me right Lord search out every Avenue and every channel of my life in other words things that I don't even see about myself that's hindering your working in my life Lord I don't want them to have dominion I've got one that I'm I want to be under obedience to that's the word of God yes sir I'm asking as my husband Lord help me help me the word that I'm hearing here the word that's encouraging me I've got an access to you you're my husband hallelujah oh Lord change me Lord let that word just so work Lord let it let it move in the depths of my life I I want to know you more I want to know you more I want to know you deeper Lord think of this this very thing right here this is something to me that's just so powerful as D is Joseph he gets married but before his Brethren ever stand before him he's had two children he names the first he names Manasseh and Ephraim Manasseh means God hath made me to forget yes all the toil from my father's house Hallelujah you see it wasn't mind over matter but he received a seed of life yes God hath birthed forgiveness in my life Hallelujah I could never have stood there before my brethren but God has birthed forgiveness Amen in my life so good yes sir now I'll tell you friends you or me we can't we can't can't do the manasse on our own no but he can amen he can provide if we'll just provide the open womb say Lord let your word just so work and move in my life there's things that I I want to forget meaning forget in other words where I no longer hold any strings of emotion to that memory whatsoever where there's no ought where there's no grudge in other words no presumptuous sin reigning over my life what did God have to do to Joseph took him to prison because that one little speck he felt like he was a great guy what made him feel like he was a great guy he had received a vision of the word you see why God has to bring even tests and trials in our life we have received the most glorious message that's ever struck the face of the Earth yes sir and God knows you and me we need his help to stay humble so that he can use us yes think of it you me we didn't go sear searching for God he sought us out it wasn't us searching there was a longing but God put that longing it was God drawing Upon Our Lives but it was God who found you and I oh God when I when I look at these things and look at am in that right Lord just help me help me to become a prisoner like Paul could say prisoner ER of Jesus Christ that's that's what I want to be I don't want to be a prisoner in my feelings no more I don't want to be a prisoner in my feelings I don't want to be a prisoner a prisoner to My reasonings my thoughts I don't want to be a prisoner to the past of something in the past I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ let me just be shut in with you Lord let all the curtains of the world just just drop around me just drop around me I tell you friends I I believe with all my heart right here tonight that if there's anything there could be any hold any channel God knows in our lives he's not asking you to come to terms with it as far as find it in your life but he knows right where it's at but if we could just have that real open sincerity with him tonight to say Lord there might be something you do know about your life there might be something some something in your life maybe it's a besetting sin maybe it's something in your life that you say I just can't seem to get Beyond this I I it's just something it just it perplexes maybe it's a feeling maybe it's something from the past something you've experienced that there's no medicine by a doctor that can bring healing to it that's right that's good but he's still Jehovah RFA he specializes in going down tunnels and areas where Satan would like to terrorize you but he'll come down through there Glory Hallelujah he's the same God that can take take places in your life where the enemy has terrorized the same God who turns the desert into a blossom Hallelujah the same almighty God move right down into areas in your life then you might say Brother Sam I want it to be done like that overnight remember just let him start working amen right where you first start is it just just just surrendering Joseph didn't get where he was overnight but Brother Carlos for that to say he was goodly person well- favored Brother Ray that meant he wasn't walking around complaining saying can you believe she lied on me he might have felt listen he was human no doubt he had some of those feelings but if he would have kept that you would not have read this you would have read this is a guy nobody wants to be around cuz he's sure to bring everybody down how did he how did he live like this because he remembered the word that God gave himall I tell you friends let me just say it to you if God has given you two words that's more than enough to whip hell with yes sir it's more to than to withstand every tide of the enemy this is why you could take the simplest shortest scripture Jesus wept and preach and preach and preach with it Hallelujah because one word from him means more [Applause] than anything I just say Lord whatever your need is tonight Lord be it unto me according to Thy word am whatever it is here tonight Lorden I I accept that Lord dying to myself dying more to me Lord just daily in my life moving because we looked at that assimilating let letting the word just just be absorbed in our life less of me and More Of You Lord father thank you for your mercy tonight Lord through these past few Services I think it's been eight parts now where you've taken us on this Lord within his hands what I know from me and my life life from the very moment Lord when you dropped it on my heart I was out walking one afternoon many of these things begin to converge Lord as I was on a walk thinking about that of the left hand right hand you begin to speak to my heart some things even that I'd heard Lord and you begin to bring that together Lord I want to say thank you for being mindful of all of us [Music] Lord I want to say thank you Lord cuz we've not just come together Lord with Services Lord your children they've not come Lord here just to hear eight parts that's that's not what it's been about but Lord God it's you that they love we love you our desire Lord is to receive from you sometimes Lord we we don't get the answers that we're looking for but we receive strength to make another step we receive sufficient Grace for that moment Lord Lord there's things that you've showed us and you've taught us in here about our walk our journey our walk with you Lord how I thank you for moments of the right hand if there not be the right hand my then Lord God how would we know the left [Music] hand Lord just like you ask us to do do not let the right hand know what the left hand's doing you've asked us Lord that in our lives Matthew 6 the whole working of the word is a submitting of ourselves in your presence Lord right here in this in this gathering this meeting right here [Music] tonight there's a submitting from within Lord to the word Lord there's things that that you do as that you woo us to that place of submission you don't intimidate us you woo Us by Divine love it's true at times Lord you have to correct us and we thank you for that Lord Lord every time cuz we've needed it Lord whether we've liked it or not we've needed it father but Lord I pray that as we looked at this little bit with Joseph here tonight [Music] Lord Lord I can see myself I believe every one of your children they can see themselves now Lord you know every every channel you know every area of our life you even know right here tonight that maybe there's a need Lord for a manasse to be [Music] born Lord God where your grace moves down to bring such healing through an area of life to where Joseph could stand there at the end and say hey hey don't don't be angry don't be upset don't don't feel that way God sent me ahead of you this has all been with a purpose oh God help us Lord I Lord God I we can't figure out the things sometimes Lord I I think we realize that we see it more clearly now it's not up for us to try to figure out what's going on and what you're working out in our life but Lord we can see we sense it Lord Lord that there's things Lord that you're working out and Lord just like the sun would bring that evaporation of the water lord God I want to lay in the presence of the so N I want all the greenness of Samuel to be baked out of my life Lord to where Lord God every part Lord every fiber every area be comes into that place of the Golden Harvest Lord and that Harvest is where it Bears your your image your likeness help us Lord may you just move tonight Lord like you move for Joseph if there's any Pride Lord in any of our channels Lord root it out Lord we we want a lord God a fresh surrender here tonight Lord God any besetting sin Lord God father we give Lord to you tonight Lord God that you would root out Lord everything Lord that's unlike you father anything that's been a hindrance Lord Lord help us I pray father Lord God any root of bitterness Lord grant it tonight Lord May the Holy Spirit just move down through those channels Lord like Israel pumping that water from the Mediterranean Sea and flooding those tunnel networks Lord oh God let the Holy Spirit just just move down Lord in those channels in those areas places Lord like that song that brother Jerry would sing Lord there's a place in my heart that even I wouldn't go oh Lord God but Lord you'll take us by the hand and say hey I ain't asked you to go at this alone I'm going to go with you I want to go with you down that channel I want
