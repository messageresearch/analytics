[41:36] name amen and amen amen if you would
[41:41] appreciate the song service there if you
[41:43] would turn with me to job
[41:47] 23 and uh verse
[41:54] 8 I want to say just um been able to
[41:59] listen to a good pretty good portion of
[42:01] the service here on Sunday and might
[42:03] want to
[42:05] service you know I I tell you you know
[42:07] there things that I to me it's such a
[42:11] blessing uh a lot of times you can't
[42:13] explain everything that God is doing but
[42:16] you know it's such a it's a blessing
[42:18] because I I certainly believe that as a
[42:20] body of Believers we are benefited uh
[42:23] being able to have that CU I believe in
[42:26] a full work of the full five full
[42:28] ministry it's essential to our lives and
[42:32] uh it's all God but we we need we need
[42:35] God moving through different Avenues
[42:37] different channels God has every gift is
[42:40] so unique and that's what's so wonderful
[42:43] and God knows what just you know God
[42:44] knows just what we have need of you know
[42:46] because when you think of it uh I know
[42:49] for myself even if I'm here I don't I
[42:52] don't speak to a minister I because I
[42:54] don't want that done to me if I go
[42:55] somewhere else I I don't want to go if I
[42:57] if I think that a minister is going to
[42:59] talk to me I'll wait and I'll walk in
[43:01] when the song service is going I even
[43:04] though I'm the preacher there might make
[43:05] them a little nervous but I wait I I
[43:07] just don't I Want to Be Free when I
[43:09] preach the word of God and uh it's a
[43:11] little different here we you know us you
[43:13] know as a pastor well there's sometimes
[43:15] there's things that I know but you still
[43:17] got to wait on God but when God just
[43:19] brings other vessels into and and you
[43:21] know God is speaking right down our
[43:23] alley how precious that is isn't it it's
[43:26] God and and it's his love for you and I
[43:29] and it just it that's why that it's it's
[43:31] so necessary just uh uh God just moving
[43:34] even through that channel of a fivefold
[43:36] Ministry and so we thankful to the Lord
[43:38] for that I know you believe that but I
[43:41] just I just want to say if anything more
[43:43] just thanks be to God that we are able
[43:45] to have that in verse 8 of job
[43:49] 23 job said behold I go forward but he
[43:53] is not there and backward but I cannot
[43:56] perceive him on the left hand where he
[44:00] doth work but I cannot Behold Him He
[44:04] hideth himself on the right hand that I
[44:07] cannot see him but he knoweth the way
[44:10] that I take and when he had tried me I
[44:13] shall come forth as gold and my foot
[44:16] hath held his steps his way have I kept
[44:21] and not
[44:22] declined neither have I gone back from
[44:25] the command of his lips I have esteemed
[44:28] the words of his mouth more than my
[44:32] necessary food amen may God bless you
[44:34] and bless the reading of the word as
[44:36] you're being
[44:37] seated I'd like to read just one more
[44:40] scripture here before I begin to look
[44:43] there in that verse in job this is out
[44:46] of Isaiah
[44:49] 53:1 and it says yet it pleased the Lord
[44:52] to bruise him he hath put him to grief
[44:56] and when thou shalt make his soul an
[44:59] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[45:03] and he shall prolong his days and the
[45:07] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[45:11] his
[45:12] hand think of
[45:14] Isaiah caught up and seeing this
[45:18] hundreds of years beforehand but knowing
[45:21] what was required and that would be life
[45:25] it would require for our life it would
[45:28] require his life and we recognize that
[45:32] it was God that came down and God
[45:34] himself created the Tabernacle God shed
[45:38] the blood that was shed for you and I
[45:41] the pace the The Ransom was paid for us
[45:44] and to be able to recognize that to see
[45:47] that the very desire that God had for
[45:49] our life that that the very pleasure of
[45:52] the Lord shall prosper in his hands and
[45:56] there's no there's no greater place that
[45:58] we could be as a Believer than in the
[46:01] hands of God there's no place that we
[46:04] would rather be we want to be in God's
[46:06] hands and we know that in the hands of
[46:08] God God is molding us he's shaping us
[46:11] he's working even now in our lives and I
[46:15] want to just say that as we've looked
[46:17] here in the previous two services and we
[46:19] were just looking at that of the word of
[46:22] where that job said I know he's working
[46:25] on the left hand but I cannot Behold Him
[46:28] job being a prophet he had received uh
[46:31] Visions from God inspiration from God
[46:34] but as far as what was taking place job
[46:37] was not receiving any inspiration there
[46:40] was no vision there was nothing there
[46:42] was nothing at all and that was what was
[46:45] troubling job because job was looking
[46:48] for an answer but yet I I think what
[46:51] what's so important as we were closing
[46:53] out last week and looking at decision of
[46:56] how that God himself a prophet cannot
[47:00] pull things out of God brother BR said a
[47:02] prophet cannot do that a prophet cannot
[47:05] make God reveal but a prophet is an
[47:07] instrument that is used by God that's
[47:09] set aside and ordained and gifted where
[47:13] God can move down at that time and God
[47:15] will make himself known his will his
[47:18] vision his word in that hour and it's
[47:21] for a purpose it's not to highlight the
[47:24] man that message is given for a people
[47:27] of God will everybody want to hear it no
[47:30] but there is an elect people that will
[47:33] are ordained to hear that word and that
[47:36] word will find its Mark in their life
[47:39] now I'll just say it in this way there's
[47:41] a lot of things that and when we speak
[47:43] it in that way it would seem as though
[47:46] that every little thing is just exactly
[47:48] perfect or in far as when someone hears
[47:51] it why immediately at that moment their
[47:53] lives will turn but sometimes a life it
[47:57] will take God working on that life for a
[47:59] period of time to break down their will
[48:02] but needless to say every seed of God
[48:05] will come into position by the Holy
[48:09] Ghost there will not be one that will
[48:12] miss it and it doesn't matter how far
[48:14] that a person can run the prodical son
[48:16] went far away but he never got away from
[48:20] what God already fora of him there's a
[48:24] lot of things that can be entangled and
[48:27] you know and things within life but you
[48:28] know God knows exactly what is there and
[48:31] he knows every situation God knows how
[48:34] to work and to bring everything around
[48:36] so I I just I I rest in that reality of
[48:39] how that within this that God himself in
[48:42] the times that where we can't see him
[48:46] but it doesn't mean because we can't see
[48:48] him at that moment that he's not working
[48:51] just because we haven't heard from him
[48:53] or he hasn't made known to us this this
[48:55] is what's going on it doesn't mean that
[48:57] it's not working and I know these can be
[49:00] sometimes very simple or very if if I
[49:03] can say it in this way a very Elementary
[49:05] uh way of saying that but yet these are
[49:08] things that even in our walk with God
[49:11] that we need to be reminded of because
[49:13] the biggest part of our life of our
[49:15] growth is not something that is visible
[49:18] or we're seeing you know uh
[49:20] manifestations here and manifestations
[49:22] there but so much of our growth is what
[49:25] is done in the secret presence of
[49:27] almighty God as a matter of fact that's
[49:29] why when when we look at the opening of
[49:32] the word and the ministry of the third
[49:34] pool which is Christ coming in to a body
[49:37] of Believers tabernacling in his
[49:39] children that the Bible would always the
[49:42] the angel of the Lord would always point
[49:43] to Matthew 6 and speak of that which is
[49:46] done in secret shall be revealed openly
[49:49] that you know don't let the left hand
[49:51] know what the right hand is doing but
[49:53] it's a secret work that is taking place
[49:55] and let me just say it like this this is
[49:58] something that even in the midst of a
[49:59] service where God is expressing secrets
[50:03] to his children God is speaking lip to
[50:06] ear there are things that we could walk
[50:08] out of the service tonight no doubt we
[50:10] will there are ways that God would have
[50:13] spoke to you tonight that may be
[50:14] somebody else that God has touched them
[50:17] in a very certain way something was said
[50:19] to answer a need in their life or a
[50:21] question and you you stand there in
[50:23] amazement and awe but how that God God
[50:26] is able among a group of people to speak
[50:28] to every single need and minister to our
[50:31] lives so personally I'll tell you that's
[50:33] a God who cares that's a God who is a
[50:36] living God that's a god that is not just
[50:38] one who is confined within the walls of
[50:41] a building but he hears our prayer as a
[50:44] matter of fact he sees and he knows all
[50:46] about us he knows everything that you
[50:48] and I have need of and what's on our
[50:51] hearts and so when we think of this that
[50:53] it's God he is still still working and
[50:56] it's him that is moving even in these
[50:59] times and hours and sometimes there's
[51:01] things you know that when we look at
[51:03] this in verse 9 I'd like to just jump
[51:05] into it it says on the left hand of job
[51:08] 23 where he doth work but I cannot
[51:12] Behold Him you know if God let us know
[51:16] everything that he was doing when he was
[51:19] doing it it would not require
[51:22] faith it would not require us to trust
[51:26] but God works things out in his time and
[51:30] in his season and it's for a purpose and
[51:32] there's things that God will let us know
[51:35] and there's other things that God
[51:37] doesn't let us know like we said last
[51:38] week with with the prophets where God
[51:41] why would why would God allow you know
[51:44] brother Ram takes that with Jacob to
[51:46] stand there and he said to be dis do you
[51:49] know to be deceived and that's the words
[51:51] the prophet used to be told that your
[51:54] son has been overtaken by wild animals
[51:57] why would God allow that why if he's a
[52:00] prophet why would God permit that and
[52:02] you know I think we touched on that some
[52:04] time ago if Joseph if Jacob would have
[52:07] known where Joseph was at he would have
[52:10] went down there but it would have messed
[52:12] up the whole program of God but God God
[52:16] was working all the time and though when
[52:19] you know through every situation from
[52:22] Isaac even when Isaac was blind and we
[52:24] know the blessing Came Upon Jacob rather
[52:27] than Esau it was God who was working the
[52:30] whole time and so what's important as we
[52:33] were concluding in that the last time is
[52:35] like what job said at the end of this of
[52:38] our text tonight that job was standing
[52:41] right where God had revealed for him to
[52:44] stand there was decisions that he had to
[52:47] make in that moment would he listen to
[52:49] his friends would he listen to others
[52:51] around him or was he going to stand upon
[52:54] what God God had already revealed to him
[52:57] because that word he was able to examine
[53:00] his life and know where he was standing
[53:03] so here we find in the Scripture it says
[53:06] where he doth work and I want you to
[53:08] notice this word work here it means to
[53:11] do to Fashion to accomplish to make to
[53:15] bring about or produce it's this is the
[53:18] same word that the second time it's used
[53:21] in the scriptures this same word that is
[53:23] used it is in Genesis
[53:26] 1:1 and God said let the Earth bring
[53:29] forth grass the herb yielding seed and
[53:32] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[53:36] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[53:39] Earth and it was swn and the Earth
[53:42] brought forth grass and Herb yielding
[53:44] seed after his kind and the tree
[53:47] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[53:50] after his kind and God saw that it was
[53:54] good you know the Bible tells us in the
[53:56] book of Isaiah that he hath wrought his
[54:00] Works already in us that everything as
[54:04] we said with the apple and with the leaf
[54:06] everything that is in there to be
[54:09] released God has packed it already in
[54:11] the seed it is there it's not something
[54:14] that's coming from out of here in but
[54:16] it's what God is releasing what is
[54:19] already laying within that seed because
[54:22] that is the word so the word that you
[54:25] and I are receiving we are hearing it is
[54:29] the word that's giving Authority it's
[54:31] the same life of God that's giving
[54:34] authority to that inner man to come
[54:37] forth it's giving Authority for that
[54:39] word to come to pass it's there there is
[54:43] something very special that is taking
[54:45] place between the believer and God so
[54:47] this word to work where he does work but
[54:50] I cannot Behold Him that word work is
[54:52] the same word that's used in verse 11 in
[54:55] verse 12 on the tree yielding fruit now
[54:59] in our lives there are seasons just like
[55:03] right now we are preparing to pass into
[55:06] we're passing into the fall season some
[55:08] of the days that we have right now well
[55:11] you know they told us to prepare for it
[55:13] from the week previously you know get
[55:15] ready for some cold temperatures and we
[55:17] did have some cold times but then after
[55:19] these next few days it's going to get
[55:21] really cold possibly they look at that
[55:24] midweek next week snow on Wednesday some
[55:27] of the first flurries but you know
[55:29] there's Seasons that come even in our
[55:32] lives as
[55:33] Believers I'm sure that every one of us
[55:36] would love just to live in springtime
[55:39] we'd love to live maybe in summertime
[55:42] but there's all seasons itself are all
[55:45] necessary parts of our life and when you
[55:49] even look at fruit itself in order for
[55:52] fruit to be produced you know it it
[55:55] takes one thing that that we we know you
[55:58] know even from elementary school where
[56:00] there the flowers themselves have to be
[56:02] pollinated and in order for those
[56:04] flowers to be pollinated sometimes it
[56:06] takes some strong winds to blow that
[56:09] pollen right then there's other times it
[56:11] takes living creatures it takes that of
[56:14] you know of of bees moving and so forth
[56:16] and getting in there to the pollen and
[56:18] they transport it back and forth and
[56:20] it's God's provided way of how that all
[56:23] of that would you know come out and the
[56:25] flowers that are so breathtaking to us
[56:27] and we think my goodness how beautiful
[56:30] is that apple tree and the blooding the
[56:32] blossoming and and things but yet
[56:34] reality of that flower itself is there
[56:37] to serve a purpose that then once the
[56:39] germination has taking place then it'll
[56:42] you know it closes up and down there on
[56:45] on the bottom where there's been a
[56:47] germinating take place a fruit begins to
[56:49] form which the fruit itself is something
[56:51] that we would go and we pay money for
[56:54] but that fruit is only there that houses
[56:57] around the seed the seed's what's the
[56:59] most important part but the fruit itself
[57:02] it it comes around that and we know that
[57:04] even when you look at fruit trees and
[57:06] things like that I I've never raised any
[57:08] any fruit trees myself but you know here
[57:11] sometimes when I would talk with
[57:13] different ones and read upon this at
[57:15] times from studying on it that you know
[57:17] even with fruit trees there comes a time
[57:19] that's so necessary of cold temperatures
[57:22] there's a certainty even with the
[57:24] different variet ities of fruit trees
[57:26] there's a need at times for what what
[57:28] was looked at like a little bit of a
[57:30] coldness that would come about that
[57:32] would begin to set the process because
[57:34] fruit itself starts even in the process
[57:38] or the fruit producing stage in times
[57:41] when it's dormant and times when it's
[57:43] cold and it's necessary it's not a place
[57:47] that I'd say if the fruit tree could
[57:49] speak about it it's not something it
[57:51] would want to go through not one of us
[57:54] want to go through times of coldness now
[57:56] I'm not talking about where we are
[57:58] neglectful or we you know and we get
[58:01] cold on God but sometimes what I'm
[58:03] talking about is where there's times in
[58:05] our life to where it just seems like
[58:07] that you know you don't feel the
[58:09] presence of God like you'd like to feel
[58:11] it now you've got a choice during that
[58:14] time you can either manufacture it you
[58:16] can either be down about it or you can
[58:19] go ahead and praise him because he's
[58:21] worthy to be praised because just
[58:24] because you don't feel him does not mean
[58:27] he's not right there job said I know
[58:31] he's here I have went forward can't find
[58:34] it I've went backward but I know he's
[58:36] right here how do you know that job
[58:39] because he has revealed himself to me
[58:41] and he knows the way that I take he did
[58:44] not open the way and turn around and
[58:47] leave me as an orphan to find my own way
[58:51] but the same God who found me and
[58:53] delivered his word to my heart is the
[58:56] same God who promised he'd never leave
[58:58] me nor forsake me he'd lead me the rest
[59:01] of the way home so even in the times of
[59:03] coldness I'm going to worship
[59:07] God that doesn't mean I got to
[59:09] manufacture anything when Paul and Silas
[59:12] were in prison it was not a time that
[59:16] they felt like worshiping let me tell
[59:18] you the surroundings itself let alone
[59:20] what was on their body maybe the clothes
[59:22] sticking and the blood dried up it was
[59:25] not a favorable moment and a time but he
[59:28] is still even in the times of cold times
[59:31] oh friends you say well I'm going to
[59:33] wait till the warm time but you need the
[59:36] cold times you need the times in your
[59:39] life where the presence of God you may
[59:41] not feel it but he's still right here
[59:44] he's still working even when you don't
[59:47] feel
[59:50] it it's important Even in our walk with
[59:53] God that as we we learn that and listen
[59:56] friends there's nobody I don't think
[59:58] there's anybody more than myself and I
[1:00:00] probably to every other believer I love
[1:00:02] to feel the presence of God I love when
[1:00:06] the presence of God comes sweeping down
[1:00:08] but let me just tell you something I am
[1:00:10] going to stand right here if I did not
[1:00:13] feel his presence I would stand right
[1:00:16] here and deliver the word that he's
[1:00:18] placed on my
[1:00:20] heart if I don't feel his presence when
[1:00:23] I'm praying I'm still going to say Lord
[1:00:26] you're worthy Lord you're worthy that I
[1:00:28] would ask you for leadership this day
[1:00:31] you may not answer me this moment but I
[1:00:33] want you to know I need you I need you
[1:00:37] every step of the way there's decisions
[1:00:39] I don't even know about that is facing
[1:00:42] me but I want you to know Lord I'm
[1:00:44] asking you to guide me and when those
[1:00:46] decisions come up today may you be the
[1:00:49] source of influence of my life just help
[1:00:52] me to be sensitive in the times of of
[1:00:54] coldness
[1:00:56] [Applause]
[1:00:58] Lord oh my I think about it you know
[1:01:01] because you know when we look at in our
[1:01:03] life brother Brandon would say like this
[1:01:04] and getting in the spirit he said you
[1:01:06] know he talking to the Pentecostal
[1:01:08] church he said we get into such a place
[1:01:10] he said that we are are living in
[1:01:13] Mountaintop experiences he said but your
[1:01:15] fruit will freeze in Mountaintop
[1:01:18] experiences is that right now there are
[1:01:20] fruits now listen now there are fruits
[1:01:22] that will grow in the mountain but only
[1:01:24] at certain
[1:01:25] elevations we're talking about
[1:01:27] Mountaintop experiences I love
[1:01:29] Mountaintop experiences I believe we
[1:01:31] need Mountaintop experiences God gives
[1:01:33] us Mountaintop experiences but God never
[1:01:36] intended for our Christian walk to be
[1:01:39] from one mountain top to another
[1:01:40] Mountain Top to another Mountain Top to
[1:01:42] another mountain top so when you go from
[1:01:45] a Mountaintop experience maybe there has
[1:01:47] been just a tremendous set of meetings a
[1:01:49] tremendous service something that God
[1:01:52] has done or is doing in your life and
[1:01:54] then you look at and say where can I
[1:01:55] find the next Mountaintop listen the
[1:01:57] only where that fruit itself will
[1:02:00] actually grow and come about is in the
[1:02:03] valley but God didn't give you those
[1:02:04] Mountaintop experiences Just For Nothing
[1:02:07] God gives you those Mountaintop
[1:02:08] experiences for you to draw from when
[1:02:10] you come into those moments in the
[1:02:12] valley so they're not just for not and
[1:02:14] you know what the thing about it is
[1:02:16] that's wonderful with the Lord Brother B
[1:02:18] tells us about that with the Mountaintop
[1:02:19] experiences that you know that that
[1:02:21] people get into a place well if I don't
[1:02:23] shout I don't run I don't do this then
[1:02:25] somehow they feel like that something's
[1:02:27] not had but let me tell you as a
[1:02:29] Believer my victory is not based upon
[1:02:32] whether I run every service or I shout
[1:02:35] every service but my victory is where my
[1:02:37] soul is in Jesus Christ if I can rest
[1:02:42] right there there might be times that
[1:02:44] for running shout we're not against any
[1:02:46] of that but neither is it something that
[1:02:49] we have to have when we come to church
[1:02:51] because if it is it'll become a
[1:02:54] manufactured
[1:02:56] event is that all right we're not asked
[1:02:58] to manufacture fruit we're asked to Bear
[1:03:03] it oh glory be to God so here's another
[1:03:07] thing with fruit and and you know the
[1:03:08] producing of fruit that you know
[1:03:10] sometimes when there comes that that
[1:03:12] element of pruning that you know
[1:03:14] sometimes in backyard situations you
[1:03:16] know maybe individuals that are not
[1:03:18] really versed in it that you know would
[1:03:20] have the Orchards and things like that
[1:03:22] and how they go through them and you
[1:03:23] know when you look at it there is
[1:03:26] sometimes where they can do even an over
[1:03:28] pruning of a tree and when you go to
[1:03:31] overp prune a tree the tree itself will
[1:03:34] actually try to recover the actual bark
[1:03:37] and everything in the tree it'll start
[1:03:39] to grow even more profusely branches it
[1:03:42] starts to grow out even more of wood
[1:03:45] rather than fruit wood or wood in which
[1:03:48] fruit itself can come forth so it takes
[1:03:51] just the right amount and right balance
[1:03:53] in pruning to know what to prune off
[1:03:56] just how much to prune off I'm glad that
[1:03:58] God's in control of that I'm glad that
[1:04:00] God didn't leave that to me that I can
[1:04:02] come down to your life or you to mine
[1:04:04] I'm glad because we'd probably butcher
[1:04:06] one another up but I'm grateful for the
[1:04:08] grace of God that God knows exactly
[1:04:11] where to make that cut at you know
[1:04:12] because real pruning of a tree is not
[1:04:15] going out and getting your hedge
[1:04:16] clippers and just just blistering the
[1:04:18] whole thing and just you know chopping
[1:04:20] it all the way down or giving your nice
[1:04:22] tree where it looks like a beetle
[1:04:23] haircut but that is not how that trees
[1:04:26] and fruit trees are trimmed there is an
[1:04:29] AR to it there is a course to all of the
[1:04:33] trimming it's not just
[1:04:35] random and let me say it like this in
[1:04:37] our lives the way God deals with our
[1:04:39] life the test and trials are not random
[1:04:42] God's not handing you know just throwing
[1:04:44] out a bunch of tests and trials like
[1:04:46] somebody busted a pinata and and you
[1:04:49] know and Candy goes everywhere you get
[1:04:51] what this no every test and trial is ex
[1:04:54] exactly fitted for our
[1:04:57] lives now watch this when we look at
[1:04:59] this in John 15:1 the Lord Jesus spoke
[1:05:02] of this and he said I am the True Vine
[1:05:05] and my father is the husbandman so he's
[1:05:09] the caretaker our heavenly father is the
[1:05:12] caretaker every branch in me that
[1:05:15] beareth not fruit he taketh away and
[1:05:19] every Branch I want you to notice this
[1:05:21] every branch that beareth fruit
[1:05:24] he purgeth it so being purged is not
[1:05:28] punishment to be purged means you're
[1:05:31] bearing fruit am why does he Purge it
[1:05:35] that it may bring forth more fruit you
[1:05:38] see sometimes the thought process that
[1:05:40] when we look at fruit more and more and
[1:05:43] more we look at things just being added
[1:05:45] to and added to and added to and added
[1:05:46] to but yet the reality of more fruit
[1:05:49] coming forth God knows exactly how to
[1:05:51] get the fruit in Us and how that it
[1:05:54] would increase in our life he knows
[1:05:56] exactly what to prune off and to purge
[1:05:59] in our
[1:06:01] lives now notice in verse three now you
[1:06:03] are clean through the word which I have
[1:06:06] spoken unto you now truly a lot of the
[1:06:08] purging or the purging that even takes
[1:06:11] place in our life where the spirit of
[1:06:12] God will begin to work you know work
[1:06:14] with a life work with a heart begin to
[1:06:16] purge and the spirit of God coming to
[1:06:18] our hearts as we will receive the word
[1:06:21] the word will actually bring a purging
[1:06:24] in our lives you believe that it'll
[1:06:27] actually Purge out habits it'll Purge
[1:06:29] out desires it'll Purge out things now
[1:06:32] it won't overrule our will but if we'll
[1:06:34] receive that word the word itself has
[1:06:37] within it the cleansing power to be able
[1:06:39] to move through our lives and separate
[1:06:42] and absolutely cut away every habit
[1:06:44] everything that's unlike God that we
[1:06:47] might be fruit bearing Believers and I
[1:06:50] don't know about you but friends I I
[1:06:52] want the word to continue to to examine
[1:06:54] my life I want the spirit of God to
[1:06:56] continue to move through my life right
[1:06:58] now that's the privilege I have you have
[1:07:00] as a believer that the spirit of God
[1:07:03] would continue to move Upon Our Lives
[1:07:05] that our lives would continually be
[1:07:07] purged in his presence free from
[1:07:10] anything that would hinder his working
[1:07:13] am glory to God now I want you to notice
[1:07:15] this that every branch that bears fruit
[1:07:18] he purgeth it this word purgeth it it
[1:07:22] means to cleanse of filth of impurity
[1:07:25] from useless
[1:07:27] shoots to prune from guilt to expiate so
[1:07:32] purging itself it's working on on
[1:07:36] branches now remember he said I'm the
[1:07:38] vine ye are the branch right and when
[1:07:41] you consider it I want you just to
[1:07:43] listen to a few of these things when you
[1:07:45] look at with the pruning and purging
[1:07:47] because pruning and purging it's really
[1:07:49] it's really the same thing of what we're
[1:07:51] looking at here tonight now these are
[1:07:53] things remember on the left hand he doth
[1:07:55] work this time of pruning and purging is
[1:07:59] not the times that we are maybe seeing
[1:08:01] you know if I can say it in this way
[1:08:03] that would necessarily be the real
[1:08:05] shouting times yet for a Believer
[1:08:07] there's joy in our heart in the midst of
[1:08:09] Trials I don't know what's going on I
[1:08:11] don't know how everything's going I
[1:08:13] don't know everything that's working out
[1:08:14] right now but I know in whom I have
[1:08:16] believed you say what is that that's
[1:08:18] called faith and faith is what Masters
[1:08:21] every circumstance to master the
[1:08:24] circumstance does not mean you need to
[1:08:26] know how it's not about that it's just
[1:08:28] you trust God and you know that the Lord
[1:08:30] is working he's got everything under
[1:08:32] control I placed everything into his
[1:08:35] hands and I'm looking to him now notice
[1:08:38] in order for this I want you to think
[1:08:40] about this even when you look at some of
[1:08:42] the trees let me just give you a little
[1:08:43] bit of stats here when you look at
[1:08:45] certain trees and how that there is
[1:08:47] certain ways that you cut them there's
[1:08:49] certain angles you'll make on that tree
[1:08:51] when you cut that tree certain times of
[1:08:53] the years even certain things when you
[1:08:55] will cut that tree if you don't cut it
[1:08:57] just in the right angle then you got to
[1:08:58] put some sealant around where you cut
[1:09:01] that or else that wound itself you know
[1:09:03] can actually affect that tree I'm glad
[1:09:05] that God knows the right angle to take
[1:09:07] with you or I he might bring in a man he
[1:09:10] might use this gift he might use the
[1:09:11] pasture whatever it is but God knows the
[1:09:14] right angle to minister to our lives he
[1:09:17] knows the trial that's needed and and
[1:09:20] the right perspective in order to get
[1:09:22] that cut if it was you and I sometimes
[1:09:24] the ways think about it in our own lives
[1:09:27] of how that God has dealt with us and
[1:09:29] the things that he has brought forth of
[1:09:31] our life we would have never paired
[1:09:33] together that test or trial we would
[1:09:36] have never paired together maybe that
[1:09:38] sermon or that text but how that God
[1:09:41] came in such a way and he made such a
[1:09:44] precise cut in our life because he's
[1:09:46] interested in us bearing more
[1:09:49] fruit Peach and nectarine trees boy I
[1:09:53] like that them don't
[1:09:54] you I like them with crust on them
[1:09:57] peaches Peach and nectarines think about
[1:09:59] this after a growing season you got to
[1:10:02] remove 50% of last year's
[1:10:05] growth
[1:10:06] wow you might seem like
[1:10:09] 50% of the growth of the growth that's
[1:10:12] come about this is why when you look
[1:10:14] around you know we've been privileged
[1:10:16] around here to have Orchards all around
[1:10:18] us you can pretty much drive down Route
[1:10:20] too and you'll see burnhams you know
[1:10:21] there used to be uh the different or was
[1:10:24] over there with that big car place took
[1:10:25] it now and there's Millers out there you
[1:10:27] know uh in South Amherst and places
[1:10:29] around you look at every one of them
[1:10:31] apple trees you don't find trees that
[1:10:33] are
[1:10:34] ginormous right they're low you don't
[1:10:37] find you when you're looking at those
[1:10:39] trees you not only are you seeing the
[1:10:41] roads from where they planted them but
[1:10:43] if you've ever walked out there and
[1:10:44] picked apples you know you can walk
[1:10:46] right down through there you're not
[1:10:47] ducking underneath branches and you're
[1:10:49] you're looking at things if you ever
[1:10:50] stop and look at it you're looking at
[1:10:52] things that have been so meticulously
[1:10:54] cut and crafted in such a way because
[1:10:58] there is someone or a group of
[1:11:00] individuals there that actually are
[1:11:02] tasked with caring for those trees now
[1:11:05] when we go out there to buy the apples I
[1:11:07] don't go out there to look them guys up
[1:11:09] I don't say hey who are the guys that
[1:11:10] was out here pruning these trees out
[1:11:12] here who's the guys that was doing this
[1:11:14] here I want to thank them because there
[1:11:16] is some good apples for some good apple
[1:11:18] Cris I want to know where those guys are
[1:11:20] at no you and I don't think about that
[1:11:22] whatsoever when we go to the store and
[1:11:24] buy the buy the apples that have an inch
[1:11:26] of wax on them that even deers won't eat
[1:11:29] you know we go to do those things we do
[1:11:31] not think about all the pruning and all
[1:11:33] the labor that went into it we don't
[1:11:35] think about that all we're doing is
[1:11:38] enjoying the fruit but do you realize
[1:11:39] that the fruit is only one season but
[1:11:42] there has been multiple Seasons there
[1:11:45] has been things that has taken place
[1:11:47] there has been pruning where men have
[1:11:50] studied that tree that know that tree
[1:11:52] know that even that type or that variety
[1:11:55] and know exactly how to cut it that's no
[1:11:57] different between you and I because God
[1:12:00] said I know my sheep and I know them by
[1:12:02] name I know exactly how they're made up
[1:12:05] I know exactly the certain things that
[1:12:07] work out in their life and I know how to
[1:12:09] bring more of myself out of their
[1:12:13] life my think about this the Fig Tree
[1:12:16] the Apple the pear the plum the apricot
[1:12:19] they remove about 20% of last year's
[1:12:21] growth so sometimes we look at adding to
[1:12:24] as though that it would why would you be
[1:12:26] taken away why would you be taking away
[1:12:29] 50% of the growth on peach trees and
[1:12:32] nectarines why would you take away
[1:12:34] growth when we've just had a Fruit
[1:12:36] Harvest the scriptures tell us that you
[1:12:40] bear fruit he purges the branches that
[1:12:44] bear fruit in order that they may bring
[1:12:46] forth
[1:12:49] more I want you to think of this in this
[1:12:51] term some of the things that they would
[1:12:53] look at with pruning trees is to control
[1:12:57] the size like we said when you you go
[1:12:58] down the road and you look at them
[1:13:00] they're not real high up but they're you
[1:13:03] know they're they're aware that it can
[1:13:04] be reached with a ladder and you know
[1:13:07] the re they'll even they'll actually
[1:13:09] prune them in such a way so that it'll
[1:13:12] keep them in a place where it can be
[1:13:14] reached a place to where that you know
[1:13:17] that the size of it does not get Beyond
[1:13:20] itself for it able to keep up because
[1:13:23] they could let it go and just let
[1:13:24] branches go everywhere you could have a
[1:13:26] lot of fruit but the fruit would never
[1:13:28] come into the development that you would
[1:13:30] be used to you'd go out there and go to
[1:13:32] pick yourself some Granny Smiths and
[1:13:34] you'd say what are these green knots on
[1:13:35] the tree why it's because things was
[1:13:37] left unattended it knows they control
[1:13:40] the height of the tree God knows how to
[1:13:42] control the height in our life the
[1:13:44] height I'm talking about is to where
[1:13:46] that we don't get too big for ourselves
[1:13:48] God knows how to keep us in a place to
[1:13:50] where we're in humility where we're in
[1:13:53] for the presence of God because when it
[1:13:55] is in humility then God can move and
[1:13:58] work in our life this is why even with
[1:14:00] test trials coming our way the best of
[1:14:03] our ability to work and to say Lord I
[1:14:06] want to stay humble before you and we
[1:14:08] pray and we're looking to the Lord but
[1:14:10] yet God knows there are elements about
[1:14:12] our life that we need divine
[1:14:14] intervention like Paul had where Paul
[1:14:16] said lest I should become exalted there
[1:14:19] was given to me a messenger of Satan to
[1:14:23] bust at me lest I would become exalted
[1:14:26] God knows how to keep us down not beat
[1:14:29] down but keep us in a place to where
[1:14:31] we're looking up to him he knows how to
[1:14:34] control the size about our life I'm glad
[1:14:37] about that aren't you cuz sometimes
[1:14:39] maybe I would think that I'm not getting
[1:14:41] too big and God said hey you're getting
[1:14:43] so big right now there's not a fire
[1:14:45] trick fir truck ladder that can rink up
[1:14:47] to you I need to get you back down here
[1:14:49] where I can get on a step stool because
[1:14:51] that's the only place that I can really
[1:14:52] work with with your life oh my you know
[1:14:55] there's also that part where even that
[1:14:58] the growth the growth needs to be
[1:15:00] stimulated this is another benefit of
[1:15:02] pruning and purging to where that growth
[1:15:04] would need to be stimulated in in that
[1:15:07] of that fruit tree that it would grow
[1:15:09] what they would call fruit wood or
[1:15:12] branches or wood or more choots that
[1:15:14] would actually be valuable in the
[1:15:17] production of fruit but you know there's
[1:15:19] also you could leave that tree and let
[1:15:21] it be neglected and if you leave that
[1:15:24] tree and let it be neglected them
[1:15:26] branches will grow across one another
[1:15:28] this one coming across to block the
[1:15:30] light out from this one it'll become so
[1:15:32] intertwined now there's guys that
[1:15:34] actually want to argue about this and
[1:15:36] say you know hey you don't need to trim
[1:15:38] it back just let them grow but you know
[1:15:40] there's been different times for places
[1:15:42] that I talked to individuals over the
[1:15:44] years cuz you know I I like apples and
[1:15:47] you would talk to them and they and some
[1:15:48] of the things that they would tell you
[1:15:50] sometimes individuals that's bought
[1:15:52] houses and they themselves had an apple
[1:15:54] tree their beautiful apple tree and we
[1:15:56] actually trying to work on that apple
[1:15:58] tree to get it back into a place to
[1:16:01] where it would actually be fruit bearing
[1:16:03] and they've studied it out looked at it
[1:16:05] how you should make the cuts but
[1:16:07] sometimes when things have been so
[1:16:08] neglected and just let go where it's not
[1:16:11] been cared for it gets to a place to
[1:16:13] where when it's been that way it just
[1:16:15] starts to produce a lot of dead wood I'm
[1:16:18] glad friends that God just don't neglect
[1:16:21] us I'm glad that God don't neglect our
[1:16:23] lives I'm glad that God knows exactly
[1:16:26] what you and I have need of you say what
[1:16:27] do you mean by that I'm glad that God
[1:16:29] doesn't ask me L Samuel would you like a
[1:16:32] trial would you like a test I'm glad why
[1:16:35] because I tell him no because there is
[1:16:37] my flesh does not want test or trials
[1:16:40] yours doesn't either but God knows what
[1:16:42] we have need of and God looks at our
[1:16:44] life and says I'm not going to neglect
[1:16:46] your life I am going to work and bring
[1:16:49] out of your life exactly what I see in
[1:16:52] your life
[1:16:54] I'm glad he doesn't neglect us oh my you
[1:16:57] know and it all depends on one of the
[1:17:00] things that they'll talk about is the
[1:17:02] goals the goal that someone has with
[1:17:04] that tree what's the goal of it you know
[1:17:08] God has a goal with his tree his bride
[1:17:11] tree with with your life my life God's
[1:17:14] got a goal and that goal is that we
[1:17:16] would bear much fruit is that right
[1:17:19] God's Not Just satisfied where you and I
[1:17:22] could look back and say I take what one
[1:17:23] year oh my there was a bunker crop that
[1:17:26] came off by the grace of God I'll tell
[1:17:28] you about 15 years ago there was such a
[1:17:31] crop came off we had such an Apple
[1:17:33] Festival God don't want us living in the
[1:17:35] history God wants he's the I am he's the
[1:17:38] everpresent God and whatever that he did
[1:17:41] before he'll still do the same today and
[1:17:44] what matters is listen friends though
[1:17:47] time increases though their age and
[1:17:49] everything else but God never changes
[1:17:52] and God will allow circumstances and
[1:17:54] situations in our life to arise in order
[1:17:58] to prune and to purge our life because
[1:18:01] he's got a goal God is working on our
[1:18:05] character in our life I want you to
[1:18:08] think of this right here think of the
[1:18:10] scripture whosoever beareth fruit that
[1:18:13] Branch he purgeth it that it may bear
[1:18:16] more fruit read the end of job when you
[1:18:19] read the end of job God gave him double
[1:18:23] right of all that he had
[1:18:25] previously brother B tells us God was
[1:18:28] purging job for the purpose to bless
[1:18:33] him so purging is not something of
[1:18:38] punishment it's actually in order to
[1:18:41] bless us that God himself might be able
[1:18:44] to become more preeminent that his grace
[1:18:47] and that his reflection of his life
[1:18:49] might shine forth through more in our
[1:18:52] lives now he didn't give him any more
[1:18:54] children the prophet tells us He
[1:18:56] restored job the seven children he lost
[1:18:59] how did he restore them they did not
[1:19:01] come back upon the Earth but brother Ram
[1:19:03] tells us they were waiting in glory for
[1:19:05] him God revealed to job the sacrifice
[1:19:09] and what you offered up it has been
[1:19:12] sufficient and they're waiting on you
[1:19:15] over there job so job didn't lose
[1:19:18] anything if anything at all from this
[1:19:21] right here of this purging he's actually
[1:19:23] gaining
[1:19:25] amen oh my you see God will do that to
[1:19:28] bring us a little closer to him listen
[1:19:31] friends we can all just let our hair
[1:19:33] down tonight those of us that got it
[1:19:35] it's a figure of speech but it's true
[1:19:37] sometimes when things are comfortable
[1:19:38] about us we're not as diligent as we
[1:19:40] should be things are a little bit easy
[1:19:43] it's not maybe as diligent as we need to
[1:19:46] be but God knows exactly how to bring
[1:19:48] things around in such a way I I think of
[1:19:51] that listen to me what would that that
[1:19:53] mean think of the love of God when you
[1:19:55] or I do not even deserve for God to come
[1:19:58] round our way and for something to come
[1:20:00] around that will actually drive us onto
[1:20:03] our needs even in a greater Earnest than
[1:20:06] what we've been you know what that is
[1:20:08] that's the love and grace of almighty
[1:20:10] God absolutely nothing that you and I
[1:20:13] can take credit for but through that
[1:20:15] moment God is actually purging yes amen
[1:20:20] he's purging Our Lives what's he doing
[1:20:22] he's controlling our size prise God he's
[1:20:24] keeping us into a place I want you to
[1:20:27] think of it that even when you have
[1:20:29] trees I've looked at it when it comes to
[1:20:31] even the vines and the grape Vines and
[1:20:33] things like that sometimes you've got to
[1:20:36] provide the direction that they need to
[1:20:39] grow yeah you know you've done this for
[1:20:41] your tomato plants at times sometimes
[1:20:42] you just can't leave them just flop over
[1:20:44] you actually got to put the steaks and
[1:20:45] you twine it around you go out there and
[1:20:46] look at it put a bigger steak around it
[1:20:48] what are you doing you're providing
[1:20:49] direction for it and God himself knows
[1:20:52] exactly and he does provide direction
[1:20:55] for our growth this is why God has he'll
[1:20:59] Place himself he'll plac his word before
[1:21:01] us God will deal with our lives he'll
[1:21:03] deal with things so personally not just
[1:21:05] through the preaching of the word yet he
[1:21:06] does that but God has such a way that so
[1:21:09] personally that when we are in the midst
[1:21:11] of a purging time of a test or a trial
[1:21:14] where there isn't well we could say
[1:21:15] fireworks going on we're not seeing the
[1:21:18] right hand I cannot behold God God is
[1:21:20] not allowing me he's not telling me what
[1:21:23] he's doing but there's things that God
[1:21:25] is doing that it's actually bringing out
[1:21:28] and causing me to die more to
[1:21:32] myself why that more fruit could be born
[1:21:37] you know there's absolutely situations
[1:21:40] sometimes that we would absolutely every
[1:21:42] one of us would have avoided situations
[1:21:45] we could go back and say oh man you know
[1:21:47] we could try to retrace your steps and
[1:21:49] everything else but here's the result of
[1:21:51] it God knows every single moment what
[1:21:55] matters is what has come out of it in
[1:21:57] your
[1:21:58] life what have you what how have you
[1:22:01] given your life to the
[1:22:04] Lord God wants he wants the Harvest
[1:22:08] itself to truly be ma maximized in our
[1:22:12] life the other reason you ever seen when
[1:22:15] you go down the road and you see the
[1:22:16] trees I I remember always looked at this
[1:22:18] when I was on my way to work and I pass
[1:22:19] by there's a section uh there on route
[1:22:21] two right before right after you come
[1:22:23] across that big bridge in here and I'd
[1:22:24] always look at that section right there
[1:22:26] and you'd see them trees and I'd watch
[1:22:27] the guys get out there with the track
[1:22:29] tractor with the bucket on it and I'd
[1:22:31] see them out there and sometimes I can't
[1:22:32] help it when I'd ride by I'd look at and
[1:22:34] think them the ugliest looking things
[1:22:36] and yet I know them are apple trees you
[1:22:38] look at them and you think sometimes why
[1:22:40] are they taking out the branches and I
[1:22:42] mean it's like right here in the middle
[1:22:44] you know if you brought a hydran bush or
[1:22:47] you bought a rose bush or you brought
[1:22:48] something else and it was wide open in
[1:22:50] the middle you'd be having your honey
[1:22:52] Tak get back to the flower nursery with
[1:22:54] the receipt and saying I want something
[1:22:56] that's more
[1:22:57] full but you see the inside part of that
[1:23:00] tree is what has to be kept open in
[1:23:03] order to allow light to get down in it
[1:23:06] and these things where the branches are
[1:23:07] growing say it don't look pretty it
[1:23:10] don't look pretty when you're looking at
[1:23:11] it but there is a reason for all of the
[1:23:14] pruning that's going on that's how that
[1:23:16] God works in our life to make to ensure
[1:23:19] that the light itself would continue to
[1:23:22] pick penetrate down into the depths of
[1:23:24] our life that everything stays you know
[1:23:27] cuz sometimes there's things that can
[1:23:29] get in the middle of our life there's
[1:23:31] things that can become the focus of our
[1:23:34] life that's not the right Focus there's
[1:23:36] things that all of a sudden certain
[1:23:38] fruits can start coming out and we're
[1:23:40] looking at it saying what's going on
[1:23:42] it's what's going on in the middle of
[1:23:45] your tree and God wants to prune out the
[1:23:47] middle of that tree in order that what
[1:23:51] his image his fruit his life would be
[1:23:55] reproduced my my my don't you love him
[1:23:59] there's got to be that also the very
[1:24:01] other part that goes with that is for
[1:24:03] proper air flow brother Ram says that he
[1:24:05] would say it in this way he said
[1:24:07] sometimes we think when we're going
[1:24:09] through the purging that God is angry
[1:24:12] with
[1:24:13] us everybody ever felt that
[1:24:17] way I'll be honest for everybody here we
[1:24:21] look at it right I mean what's going on
[1:24:23] I mean I haven't I haven't heard from
[1:24:25] him I haven't felt his presence Hey
[1:24:27] listen as a believer that means
[1:24:29] everything to you hearing from him you
[1:24:32] might go weeks on end from not hearing
[1:24:34] from your best friend but not hearing
[1:24:35] from him it's troubling not feeling his
[1:24:38] presence it's trembling it causes a
[1:24:41] Believer to look and search and say Lord
[1:24:45] is there something wrong in my life and
[1:24:48] as Believers we come to a place to
[1:24:50] understand that when our hearts are
[1:24:52] really poured out before God if there is
[1:24:54] something in the way God will make it
[1:24:56] known but sometimes it isn't about
[1:24:59] things being in the way it's simply God
[1:25:01] wanting us to be opened up and realizing
[1:25:04] that without me you can do
[1:25:10] nothing why was God purging him he was
[1:25:14] purging him in order that job would
[1:25:16] bring forth the abundance of fruit and
[1:25:19] giving him a fruit a few
[1:25:20] trials God was proving that in the midst
[1:25:23] of conflict he was proving it to Satan
[1:25:26] that there is somebody who will stand
[1:25:29] steadfast in the midst of it
[1:25:32] amen I wish I had a diagram up here
[1:25:35] tonight I actually had it but I we
[1:25:37] things I didn't get it dropped to him
[1:25:38] back there and we had a lot was going on
[1:25:40] there but you know many times there's
[1:25:43] been some things and I I'll tell you a
[1:25:44] little story on
[1:25:45] myself my wife and now we've got you
[1:25:48] know we've got multiple hydras and
[1:25:49] things like that over the years but the
[1:25:50] first time we got this big hydr that
[1:25:53] well it wasn't big it was just in a you
[1:25:54] know it was a small one like this and
[1:25:56] she wanted one so bad and to me I looked
[1:25:58] at it and I thought cuz I already got it
[1:26:00] one time for how I trimmed the cherry
[1:26:02] tree now there ain't no fruit coming out
[1:26:04] of our cherry tree but I I you say what
[1:26:06] what did she do she pulled up and
[1:26:08] stopped and got out of the on the
[1:26:09] driveway and just looked at
[1:26:12] it now I'm the gardener around the house
[1:26:15] but when it came to that right there I
[1:26:17] thought oh man it just crushed me cuz I
[1:26:19] thought oh I hope I didn't ruin it I
[1:26:20] hope I didn't mess it up I was the guy
[1:26:22] who gave that we that cherry tree a
[1:26:23] beetle
[1:26:26] haircut you wonder where the rest of the
[1:26:28] Beatles
[1:26:30] at my wife just looked at it so when we
[1:26:32] got this hydran I'll tell you what I did
[1:26:34] she wanted one of those I looked at it I
[1:26:35] said honey CU I know you got to make
[1:26:37] certain Cuts you got to do certain
[1:26:39] things when you're trimming them and you
[1:26:40] know there's certain things they work on
[1:26:41] New Growth I said I'll tell you what
[1:26:42] I'll plan it for you but now I said
[1:26:46] you'd be the one to trim it would that
[1:26:47] be all right I said I'll make sure i' I
[1:26:50] make sure I've got you Sharp utens
[1:26:52] I'll sharpen them for you I'll make sure
[1:26:54] they're ready to go but if you'll just
[1:26:56] do the studying and the busy work and
[1:26:59] take care of it because I do a lot of
[1:27:00] other the fertilizing and things like
[1:27:02] that trimming up roses and things but
[1:27:03] you realize that some of that right
[1:27:05] there of going through and you study it
[1:27:07] of how you have to cut not all hydras
[1:27:09] are the same same way with fruit trees
[1:27:11] but there's certain ways that you make
[1:27:13] Cuts I wish I had that diagram up there
[1:27:14] because there's just certain ways it's
[1:27:16] not just going and just making just a
[1:27:18] flat cut all around there's certain
[1:27:20] things that's studied out and to think
[1:27:22] how that God knows you and I oh my
[1:27:25] here's a fruit time coming out in our
[1:27:27] life and we look at it say glory be to
[1:27:30] God and then look off of that branch and
[1:27:32] here's coming you know a shoot off the
[1:27:33] branch and here a shoot off the branch
[1:27:35] and here a shoot off the branch God just
[1:27:37] looks at it and he trims it back right
[1:27:39] here and trims this away right here and
[1:27:41] you and I can look at and say Lord what
[1:27:43] what what's what's going on what are you
[1:27:46] doing what's taking place Lord I don't
[1:27:49] understand what's going on he's pruning
[1:27:51] our Liv
[1:27:53] lives it doesn't always make sense to us
[1:27:57] when God is pruning away our lives as a
[1:28:00] matter of fact we don't always know
[1:28:01] what's taking
[1:28:02] place this is why brother Bram you've
[1:28:04] heard me refer to this quote here for
[1:28:06] time and time again where brother Bram
[1:28:08] says this regarding job I don't have it
[1:28:09] up there but I just want to refer to it
[1:28:11] he said regarding that of job that
[1:28:13] sometimes people think because that
[1:28:15] other people are sick but they've sinned
[1:28:17] no he said God does deal with sickness
[1:28:19] and sin by sickness but not in every
[1:28:21] case he said in this case with job he
[1:28:24] was not correcting him but he was
[1:28:26] bringing out the
[1:28:28] qualities of a
[1:28:30] Believer bringing out the qualities what
[1:28:34] qualities would be brought out in our
[1:28:36] life when we consider that the stature
[1:28:39] of a perfect man you realize every one
[1:28:42] of those attributes are already in you
[1:28:46] they're in that seed
[1:28:49] already true we have to come under the
[1:28:52] word for our day just as everyone had to
[1:28:54] come in the word for their day truly God
[1:28:57] makes indeed temples and Tabernacles of
[1:29:00] his glory but you realize that every one
[1:29:02] of those virtues in there Faith
[1:29:06] knowledge Temperance virtue godliness
[1:29:10] brotherly kindness you realize that
[1:29:12] every one of those there's a continue as
[1:29:13] the scripture says and adding to or
[1:29:17] increasing or
[1:29:19] enlargement it's continuing and you you
[1:29:22] know what when we think about it with
[1:29:24] patience patience itself is not just
[1:29:27] something you wake up in the morning and
[1:29:28] say you know what I think today would be
[1:29:30] a lovely day for patience to be added
[1:29:33] I'll take some more patience on my life
[1:29:35] you can't do
[1:29:37] that patience can only be added through
[1:29:41] circumstances that require death and
[1:29:44] allow patience to come
[1:29:47] forth requires of where we're trusting
[1:29:50] and looking to the word of God we're
[1:29:53] trust like Abraham was trusting in God
[1:29:55] and go for God to complete the work he
[1:29:58] had to be
[1:29:59] patient is that right Abraham had some
[1:30:02] failures on that right there but when it
[1:30:04] all comes down to it you find patience
[1:30:07] grew in Abraham's life it's the same way
[1:30:10] with faith faith is made to grow Paul
[1:30:14] would write to the Believers that your
[1:30:16] faith May
[1:30:18] abound right the prophet spoke about
[1:30:21] when in wings of a snow white dove and
[1:30:23] he would talk about where God had
[1:30:25] brought him in his life through the
[1:30:27] opening of the word and he said this has
[1:30:29] led me to a faith I never had before
[1:30:33] amen why it was growing our faith you
[1:30:37] see this is why we are we are Liv we are
[1:30:40] living beings we are living images of a
[1:30:43] living God working through us he's not
[1:30:46] just where we're sitting there with
[1:30:47] faith and virtue and praise God I've got
[1:30:50] everything you know Master this is where
[1:30:52] some of the things I don't want to get
[1:30:53] off on this but sometimes it's gotten
[1:30:55] off and it keeps people well I made it
[1:30:57] here and I've got up here and I've got
[1:30:58] up here it's not like that it's what's
[1:31:01] already packed inside of you and the
[1:31:03] spirit of God is what quickens that seed
[1:31:06] on the inside because if it's not then
[1:31:10] it's like as the prophet said over and
[1:31:12] over and over a black bird trying to put
[1:31:15] peacock feathers in
[1:31:17] itself then virtues are spirit-given
[1:31:20] virtues that must come out of our life
[1:31:24] by the spirit of the Living God what I'm
[1:31:26] trying to say is is only through times
[1:31:30] of
[1:31:31] adversity do they
[1:31:34] grow can we just look at a few things
[1:31:37] here I just want just have a couple
[1:31:39] scriptures and then we'll come to a
[1:31:44] close we're talking about the fruit of
[1:31:46] the spirit but let me keep let me skip
[1:31:48] Galatians 5 and let's go to Philippians
[1:31:51] 1 verse verse
[1:31:54] n I'm going to look at this word
[1:31:57] abound but this word abound it means of
[1:32:00] a flower that's going from a bud to full
[1:32:04] bloom I want you to look at this in
[1:32:06] Philippians
[1:32:07] 1:9 Paul said and this I pray that your
[1:32:12] love may
[1:32:14] abound yet more and more in knowledge
[1:32:20] and in all judgment
[1:32:22] now how can we can't just sit around and
[1:32:25] say you know today's going to be a day
[1:32:28] where my love abounds this is where the
[1:32:30] Love's going to abound I tell you today
[1:32:33] I'm going to really I'm going to set my
[1:32:35] mind to it and I'm going to the love is
[1:32:39] going to my understanding in situations
[1:32:42] is going to grow today my discernment in
[1:32:45] situations with love is going to grow
[1:32:48] don't work that
[1:32:50] way the only way that love itself May
[1:32:54] abound more and more in understanding
[1:32:56] and discernment is by
[1:32:59] experience it's got to be pruning that
[1:33:03] goes on in our
[1:33:05] life and let me tell you every moment of
[1:33:09] pruning is worth
[1:33:11] it every moment that we're dying to
[1:33:15] ourself because in order for love to be
[1:33:18] expressed you've got to have that which
[1:33:21] is
[1:33:22] contrary and sometimes it isn't
[1:33:24] altogether somebody in opposition or
[1:33:27] somebody coming against you know all the
[1:33:29] chapter on 1 Corinthians 13 but
[1:33:31] sometimes it's just situations where God
[1:33:34] is helping you and I through experiences
[1:33:36] in our own life Paul would say you need
[1:33:39] not any man teach you to love one
[1:33:42] another cuz you're taught of God God
[1:33:45] loved you when you were unlovable and
[1:33:49] even now at times when you don't don't
[1:33:51] deserve it God let you know it's not
[1:33:54] about what you deserve my love is
[1:34:00] unconditional is that right he's he's
[1:34:03] doing that so that you and I might learn
[1:34:06] that we that our love might reach
[1:34:10] out Lord amen well so and so don't
[1:34:13] deserve my
[1:34:14] love says
[1:34:17] who well they haven't been faithful they
[1:34:19] haven't done this they haven't done that
[1:34:21] so you've got conditional
[1:34:24] love now you see God is not going to
[1:34:28] neglect one growth in our life God said
[1:34:32] that's a branch that's growing across
[1:34:34] you got something growing across there
[1:34:36] we need to get that pruned out so light
[1:34:38] can hit that area in your life because
[1:34:40] it's got to bring forth It's got to
[1:34:42] manifest the love of God in every area
[1:34:45] and every part of our
[1:34:48] life I say Lord help us I'm glad he's
[1:34:52] the one doing the pruning aren't you
[1:34:54] yes cuz if it was left up to me and left
[1:34:57] up to you we would probably just have
[1:34:59] branches going every which way we would
[1:35:01] say why cut this off here why cut this
[1:35:03] off here why cause this one to go this
[1:35:06] way what but God knows exactly what he's
[1:35:08] doing he knows why when every situation
[1:35:11] comes across our life listen friends if
[1:35:14] there's one thing that we can learn
[1:35:16] don't wish away every
[1:35:18] situation Hallelujah don't look at every
[1:35:22] situation of why did so and so do this
[1:35:24] or why did this do this but sometimes
[1:35:27] God allows wrong to come your way to see
[1:35:29] what you're going to do about it and
[1:35:32] whether or not you're going to humble
[1:35:33] yourself under the mighty hand of God
[1:35:36] God's doing that to prune Our
[1:35:42] Lives now remember there's only two ways
[1:35:45] God's way and our way God's way is
[1:35:48] always right right our way is always is
[1:35:52] wrong you're right verse 10 why so
[1:35:58] understanding and discernment here that
[1:36:00] you may approve things that are
[1:36:02] excellent that you may be sincere and
[1:36:04] without offense till the day of Christ
[1:36:08] being filled with the fruits of
[1:36:11] righteous that means being complete
[1:36:13] which are by Jesus Christ un the glory
[1:36:16] and praise of
[1:36:18] God Philippi 1 Thessalonians 3: 12 and
[1:36:22] the Lord make you to increase and abound
[1:36:27] in love one toward
[1:36:30] another and
[1:36:33] toward all
[1:36:39] menoo that's just not buddies just not
[1:36:43] friends just not Brethren just not the
[1:36:46] people who even agree with
[1:36:48] us but toward all men
[1:36:52] friends love is not compromising love
[1:36:54] has a standard is that right but God
[1:36:57] make us increase and abound in love so
[1:37:01] here God knows in order for that to come
[1:37:04] to pass there's got to be pruning in our
[1:37:07] lives and pruning and purging God will
[1:37:10] allow situations to come our way test
[1:37:14] and
[1:37:16] trials to
[1:37:18] purges these are not that purging us
[1:37:22] these are not those times of oh the
[1:37:26] right hand where the Red Sea is
[1:37:29] parted yet it's his power it's his
[1:37:31] presence the whole time but it's not
[1:37:34] those times where you feel like maram
[1:37:35] grabbing the tamb bring and running up
[1:37:37] and down the
[1:37:38] bank in the midst of those times it's a
[1:37:41] time of us dying to
[1:37:44] ourselves but yet those are the greatest
[1:37:47] times when God's
[1:37:49] working it's when we're surrendering to
[1:37:53] him yielding to
[1:37:57] him dying to
[1:37:59] ourselves look at this in Psalms 92 let
[1:38:03] me finish with these three
[1:38:05] scriptures I I love these scriptures
[1:38:08] those that be planted in the house of
[1:38:11] the Lord shall flourish in the courts of
[1:38:15] our
[1:38:16] God those that are planted he plants us
[1:38:20] the Lord he's the one tendon to our
[1:38:25] lives verse 14 they shall still bring
[1:38:29] forth fruit in old age they shall be fat
[1:38:34] and
[1:38:36] flourishing so it's not just a season
[1:38:39] but it's a
[1:38:40] continual it's pruning that's going on
[1:38:43] that purging where those that are
[1:38:46] planted in the courts of the Lord still
[1:38:49] in the old age will be
[1:38:51] fat and
[1:38:52] flourishing that word that means full of
[1:38:55] spiritual
[1:38:56] Vitality verse 15 to show that the Lord
[1:39:01] is upright they are living memorials
[1:39:05] showing that the Lord is upright and
[1:39:07] faithful to all his promises he is my
[1:39:09] rock and there is no
[1:39:12] unrighteousness in
[1:39:15] him that's part of the
[1:39:19] purging on the left and he does work
[1:39:21] let's
[1:39:22] stand yet I cannot behold
[1:39:25] him but he's
[1:39:27] working yes the times like I said when
[1:39:31] they're going through comes into early
[1:39:33] spring that's when they're out there
[1:39:35] trimming trimming
[1:39:37] pruning that's the ideal time when they
[1:39:40] catch their first little glimpses of
[1:39:41] warmth in Spring that's when they're
[1:39:43] working on those fruit trees but how
[1:39:46] many of us make an appointment and say
[1:39:49] you know what I tell you what brother
[1:39:51] Brian let's let's meet up at Miller's
[1:39:53] right now we'll meet over there in early
[1:39:55] spring huh first thing you had asked the
[1:39:58] question of why did they get a new
[1:40:01] shipment of Amish pies come in CU they
[1:40:04] do get them out
[1:40:05] there what what what what did they get
[1:40:07] in CU you know there's nothing on the
[1:40:09] trees there's not even leaves who wants
[1:40:13] to go look at those trees right now
[1:40:15] there's no apples out there to pick but
[1:40:17] yet that time that you and I are not
[1:40:20] paying any atten attention to it are not
[1:40:22] drawn to it that's when some of the most
[1:40:25] important and is the work that's being
[1:40:29] done that we benefit
[1:40:31] from in the fall
[1:40:34] season so the times when you don't see
[1:40:37] God working you don't feel him working
[1:40:40] of course we examine our life we check
[1:40:42] our life but when you see when you don't
[1:40:45] you can look in the word and say Lord I
[1:40:48] by your grace I don't I don't see
[1:40:50] anything at least it's unbeknown to me
[1:40:52] but I Got Confidence you'll make it
[1:40:53] known to me if there is see listen
[1:40:55] friends God won't drag God won't lead
[1:40:57] you
[1:40:58] on God don't make you
[1:41:00] guess he wants Fellowship to be there
[1:41:03] between you and I but think of what the
[1:41:05] scripture says that I may know him in
[1:41:07] the power of his resurrection and the
[1:41:11] fellowship of his
[1:41:14] sufferings that Christ would make
[1:41:16] himself
[1:41:17] known to you and I he would Purge away
[1:41:22] I tell you what I want to do I said Lord
[1:41:24] just let me stay in that place that I
[1:41:26] can just those decisions we were talking
[1:41:28] about last week Lord help me just to
[1:41:30] stay in that place getting Lord God if
[1:41:33] it's it's me humbling myself more
[1:41:34] because there's always room for that
[1:41:37] help me Lord in the midst of these times
[1:41:39] I've never been there in situations
[1:41:41] where you don't know what's going on
[1:41:42] there's nothing you can even explain to
[1:41:44] anybody else there's things that you it
[1:41:47] seems like in your life and you know
[1:41:48] what I'll tell you this right now this
[1:41:50] is just experience coming through if you
[1:41:53] dwell on it very long it can get you
[1:41:57] down you start dwelling on what's going
[1:41:59] on and what's taking place you dwelling
[1:42:01] on it I'll tell you
[1:42:03] what you'll be you having the blues
[1:42:06] pretty pretty
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:10] soon brother Samuel what must I do those
[1:42:12] are times for decisions and remember the
[1:42:15] prophet told us that when we make
[1:42:17] decisions in the midst of those times
[1:42:19] that's overcoming
[1:42:21] even to make a decision as we said in
[1:42:24] times where maybe his presence you don't
[1:42:26] feel it like you felt it at other
[1:42:29] times he's still present amen he's still
[1:42:34] God when you don't sense his presence
[1:42:37] when you haven't maybe heard an answer
[1:42:40] from him maybe there's something he
[1:42:42] hasn't seemed like he hasn't spoken to
[1:42:44] your life in a while when you've
[1:42:46] examined your life by the word you've
[1:42:49] let the word examine your life that's
[1:42:51] why even we come to the house of God L
[1:42:53] friends even in the best of our looking
[1:42:56] at our own lives I'm glad that the Holy
[1:42:59] Spirit he'll come right by our way and
[1:43:00] God is so mindful he'll bring an
[1:43:03] examination on our life oh you know what
[1:43:05] it's like writing a
[1:43:07] paper you ever wrote a paper and you
[1:43:09] edit it you check it over how many ever
[1:43:13] wrote a paper
[1:43:14] before okay sometimes I mean the things
[1:43:18] you can write it over you think man this
[1:43:20] is is
[1:43:21] perfect I've went over this with a fine
[1:43:24] tooth comb then you give it to somebody
[1:43:27] else right and they start reading it and
[1:43:30] you realize words that you have filled
[1:43:33] in in your brain that you left out they
[1:43:37] catch places you should have put a comma
[1:43:41] they catch places that should have been
[1:43:43] a
[1:43:44] period they
[1:43:46] catch you see there's certain things
[1:43:48] that we look at and we can look and
[1:43:50] think everything is just exactly just
[1:43:52] right but God knows how to scan Our
[1:43:55] Lives say here's time for a pause oh
[1:43:57] this is a runon God knows exactly what
[1:44:00] he's doing in our
[1:44:01] lives every service we know this by now
[1:44:04] every service is always it's so unique
[1:44:06] you can't you can't
[1:44:08] reproduce and you wouldn't want to try
[1:44:09] to do
[1:44:12] that but you you want God to be free to
[1:44:15] move in such a way in every service cuz
[1:44:18] he knows what we have need of there's
[1:44:21] times we need our lives examined and we
[1:44:23] all we always do but we need that that
[1:44:25] part about our life because if there's
[1:44:27] something out of
[1:44:28] place then we want to be known about it
[1:44:30] but if we've examined it and then the
[1:44:32] spirit of God is coming down this way
[1:44:34] and the word's coming then you can stand
[1:44:36] there in the midst of that and say Lord
[1:44:38] I know my life I I I'm placed right here
[1:44:41] and the word has examined my life Lord
[1:44:43] then you're standing in a channel
[1:44:46] waiting for
[1:44:48] inspiration and you can stand right
[1:44:50] there with with faith and
[1:44:52] wait and no I don't see him I don't even
[1:44:56] feel
[1:44:57] him but he's my way maker amen and he's
[1:45:01] working amen he's working on the left
[1:45:05] hand he does work this may not be a red
[1:45:07] sea moment in my life but he's still the
[1:45:09] God who opened the Red Sea he's the god
[1:45:12] who's holding my life right now he's the
[1:45:15] god who's working all situations right
[1:45:17] around for his
[1:45:19] glory you believe
[1:45:22] that God is
[1:45:24] working let's just
[1:45:28] pray could we just pray together

[1:45:52] about it when we go to buy the certain
[1:45:55] Delicacies of fruit and things like that
