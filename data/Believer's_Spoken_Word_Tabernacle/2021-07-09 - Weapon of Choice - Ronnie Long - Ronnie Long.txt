good to be in the house of the lord tonight amen pray everybody's doing okay we thank you for the songs and and the music and amen it's just a good day to be a christian amen you know i i love it we can come we come to church uh no matter what the devil throws against us you can't take that away amen we have we have the power to overcome and we have the power to gather and we have the power he tried it for a season but here we are gathered together again amen and we just thank the lord for that if you have your bible if you turn to the book of joshua in the 10th chapter amen well praise the lord i was i was texting brother andrew earlier about the camp and he said it was a wonderful time and said that your pastor was tearing it up i know you probably missed him you'd rather see him but he's doing the lord's work we know there'll be great benefit from it amen joshua the 10th chapter i would just start at the 12th verse and then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sons stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilent and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is is this written in the book of is is not this written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day and there there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened to the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel and joshua returned in all israel with him unto the camp of gilgal but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at mecca and it was told joshua's saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at maccada and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them and stay not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god had delivered them into your hand and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of the slaying them with the very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into the fenced cities and all the people returned to the camp to joshua macada in peace and none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave and the king of jerusalem and the king of hebron and the king of jarath and the king of latchis and the king of eglon and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near and put your foot upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the the necks of them and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hang them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening amen may god bless his word and you may be seated tonight and i i know that this is probably a familiar passage of scripture to most of us believers and we've heard it before but i just want to maybe just talk for just a few minutes tonight on on weapon of choice we have a weapon that we choose and we're in a battle and we know that we're in a battle and we know that we're in a fight and and we can we can we can choose to lay down and take it or we can choose to fight back and we can choose to just accept what the devil has given us and and the report that he's delivered us or we can we can choose to seek another report and we can we can choose to to fight back against what what the devil would put on us in this age and the and the laodicea spirit that we have to fight and and the the discrepancies that we have to fight and depressions and and and we can choose to fight back against that because we've been given a weapon and that weapon is the weapon of choice and i just like this passage of scripture to bring this out because joshua has been commissioned and and we know we all know the story of joshua and how how he was commissioned by moses that you you're going to take this land and and he had the captain of the lord of the hosts with him and joshua the prophet would tell us became fearless in his testimony that that he knew that he was ordained and he was called and he was placed to destroy every enemy that was in their land and and no matter how far the boundary would go but he knew that that he was ordained to destroy that enemy and that he was ordained to overcome that camp and he was ordained to to take down jericho and he was ordained to take down every king of the land and so joshua became fearless in his testimony but i like this portion of scripture here because under a joshua ministry he calls his mighty men of war to come back because he has a need for them he has a purpose for them and i believe that's where we come in is is under the power of the holy spirit he's fighting all our battles he's he's already the war he's already promised a victory and we can read in the back of the book that he's already overcome but but but he wants us to put an action into it he wants us to put a purpose into it and and so joshua has already gone out and he's slain every enemy that they're coming up against and and yet these five major kings have run into this cave and they've hid and so joshua does a wise thing and he rolls stones in front of them as to starve them out and so there they are in a cave and and they're becoming weak and they're becoming they'll just open up the cave and and that's the way that we got to handle the devil you know if we keep feeding them the negativity and we keep feeding them the the the discrepancies that we have in our mind and we keep we keep feeding them the despair that we're in and we keep feeding them the woe is me and as brother jewel would say the wowzy woos if we keep feeding him that story then then he grows stronger and he goes bigger and and and he doesn't ever get weak in our mind but if we'll just roll a stone in front of him a little bit and just starve him out and then let the holy spirit guide us on how to handle him and and so he said chase after every enemy that we've conquered and follow them into the city because they will produce more of them and they will have children and those children will become our enemy and and so don't don't leave one don't leave one alive and many times our our affections get in the way and our reasoning gets in the way and we don't want to be hurtful to anybody and joshua didn't have that problem joshua was a man that knew where he stood and he he knew that that enemy is going to become my my child's enemy and that's going to become my wife sending me and that's going to become somebody in my church's enemy he said we must destroy every enemy out there but of course in our day we're not battling against flesh and blood but we're battling against principalities and powers and spiritual warfare in high places and and so we we want to let maybe you know the affections take over and we don't want to strike that thing so hard in the ministry but but realizing under a joshua ministry that it's our obligation and we're actually ordained to strike against that thing no matter how hard it is because it's gonna come back stronger and bigger than it was before and so joshua knew this and he would seek after these enemies and he would destroy them but but but tonight we want to just deal with the five and i know there's so much more we can cover in this but just in about 40 minutes if we could just sum up these five kings and joshua starves them out and he says it's time there's a time and a season for everything and many of us have had things that we've repressed in ourselves and and faith that we haven't been able to stand out on and prayers that haven't been answered yet but there's a time and a season for everything and and under the move of the holy spirit he'll direct us now it's time let's turn our attention to this cave and let's move the stone away and let's deal with these five kings in this cave right i don't think any of us in here want to leave anything undone in our life we know that that there's there's the king is coming soon and he's not coming for an imperfect bride or a partial bride or or just a halfway surrendered bride but he's coming for a perfect bride who believes a perfect word under a perfect ministry i believe we have that in this stage we've been delivered that in this age and i believe that we are that perfect church that's rising up and yes us weak in faith and maybe we don't seem like we fit the part sometimes but god thinks we do because god put it in us to overcome and so i don't really care what i think i care what he thinks and i i don't care what my narrative is i care what god's narrative is and so we find ourselves in the same condition as joshua's men of war and there they have these kings trapped in this cave and it's time to deal with them and i don't think we can probably get into this on a thursday night but it's time to deal with some things you know the devil has put a lot of lies in our life he's put a lot of untruths in front of us and he's put a lot of rocks in front of us and a lot of logs and he's jammed up our channels and i don't think there's probably one person sitting in this building tonight that hasn't had had the devil come to them and say you're not gonna make it right you know the rapture is gonna happen tomorrow and you're gonna find everybody's gone and it's not gonna be you and and you fell short just just short of the finish line right brother paul that's that's how he talks that's his dialect that's that's his move but there's a time to deal with that spirit there's a time to bring a confirmation in our life that we know who we are and and though though the world may fall away there's one going to make it brother brahman said you've got to possess that faith that it's you that that if there's just one if he's just going to come back for one soul for one believer it's going to be me i believe that that we are that church i believe it's not for another age coming i believe it's not we didn't miss it back in another age but we're right at the pivotal time we're at the finish line and so the devil's going to try to hit us with everything he's got with the hardest ammunition he's got and and the hardest the hardest battles we are going through right now don't look for a squeeze to come it's already here if you can't feel it then just hang out with us for a day or two and you'll see that the squeeze has already been happening to the it's forcing us into a position but under a joshua ministry everything's under control those men didn't fear those kings they they ran into that cave because they feared joshua and his men and that he hadn't lost one and that he hadn't he hadn't been defeated and he had never lost and he was never retreated he never backed up and i believe we're under the same headship in this age that we don't have to back up on what the devil tells us and and say that that prodigal is too far gone and and you just don't know what's been said and you don't know the situation there but don't back up on any bit of ground because you're under a joshua ministry in this generation that came to set the the wrongs right and to set the crooked straight into and to tie up every loose sin i believe that we know that we're in that time and it's time to deal with these five things brother branham would bring that out in the message uh uh the greatest battle ever fought right and the the you know we have the five senses right we have the five senses of the natural and then he would bring out the five gates or he would call them the five gates of the of the soul right and and he would he would he would tie this in together and so we just want to read can we read some quotes is that all right he says now in here there's there's one this is out of revelations chapter four part three now in here there's one two three four five attributes in this soul now you wanna write this down first one is imagination the second one is conscience the third one is memory the fourth one is reason the fifth one is affection now did you get them all if you don't then let me know and we'll get back to that see taste fell smear here smell here in the body that's open to the body but the soul is imagination conscience memory reason and affection is the senses of the attributes like the senses of the soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside because the soul only puts out an atmosphere of what's on the inside of you it takes the place of sanctification it sets in the same category there all right everybody got that that's what he said now to this gate there's there's only one gate and that's called self-will you're the boss of what goes in there and what does it do what is this the body must be washed the lava is sanctified here filled with the holy spirit here this becomes god's judgment seat again where god sits in your heart and if you do something wrong you say oh my i did wrong but i challenge you to let jesus christ come in here and try to do it one time now he's speaking of the doors to the heart remember that you you open every door to the heart and if you let jesus come in and the devil used to beat you up and remember he gives that scenario but i challenge you he says to let jesus and come in and then let the devil try that one time brother you'll be you'll be he'll be so condemned to back off and shake the head of that thing as certain as i'm standing here because he's holy listen i'm quoting scripture if you love them things that's the world things of the world it's because the love of god is not even in you how did how did it self-will why would you call that self-will brother brandon because it puts a man and a woman back again just like adam and eve at the garden of eden on what the two trees self-will this one is death this one is life self-will immoral free moral agency god placed the first man adam and eve right here on free moral agency he places you in the same place and the only way that you can get this thing fixed in here is your own self-will hallelujah your self-will and i know that we battle with this because i'm i'm in the same boat well it's not by my will it's by his and but the power of choice remember we're talking about the weapon of choice and he says you have to will to do god's will that might be a fridge quote you have to will to do god's will you have to get rid of your own will to let god's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart you have to will to surrender that to god god's not not god's not just going to come in and take it but it that's the power of choice that we have is to surrender ourselves and our own self-will and let god have his way and now that sounds real simple but that's the very thing that got eve that's the very thing that will get everybody that falls short but there is a people who will be able to surrender everything that they are to surrender every self-will and let i could ask everyone one by one and we could go through situations that we've been in and and see where our self will has gotten us and it hasn't gotten us in the right place it hasn't gotten us on top it didn't it didn't win us anything but but by now i think we've been through enough battles and we've been through enough heat and we've been through enough fire and we've been refined just so much that we know that our will is not going to get us there so our self-will has the ability to turn it over to god to turn over our imagination to turn over our memory and our conscience and our reason and our affections and say lord it's not my will but thine be done and i'm sure that the the that jesus there in the garden went through the very same thing that we're feeling now and lord if it be possible let this cup pass for me but he was ordained for that position in time he was ordained to to hang on the tree he was ordained to take the sins of the world and we're ordained to finish this word of god we are ordained to bring a culmination to everything that has been prophesied everything that has been preached everything that we are the fulfillment of the prophecy of god himself in this building tonight i believe i'm looking at fulfillments of god's word when god made a promise it's being fulfilled in this building tonight but because we are surrendering our self-will now he draws these five kings out to this one cave mouth and brother bam says that that is the entrance and it is self-will you'll never be able to overcome your imagination or your reason or or your your intellectual conception of something you'll never be able to overcome that without surrendering your self-will our weapon is choice can we read some more god when god made man the devil took his head and god chose his heart the devil through his imagination makes him imagine anything gives him intellectual conceptions of the scripture but god gets in his heart and leads him by the spirit makes him believe things that his intellectual don't know nothing about that makes me feel a little religious when i when i say that he says because there's things that we believe that are unexplainable and the devil wants to trap you in a corner and and demand that you explain how you believe what you believe and and and if you don't surrender yourself will you'll be stuck in that corner and you'll be stuck dealing with that cave for a long time but there's a time to deal with it we do not have to answer scientifically anything that the devil brings before us because we are not governed by the laws of this land i am not governed by these senses and these five gates and these because we have another sense and that sense is faith and it can override all of these senses when we apply all of our all of our focus and all of our energy and we apply all of our mind into that sixth sense it will overcome all the other five and all the other five natural ones in and though you can't explain how you were healed and how that cancer just fell off your body try to explain that to somebody you can't but but the problem is the devil's pushed people into a corner to try to explain a supernatural realm you tell me how that happened and and and if we don't if we don't know better we'll just back up in a corner and we'll begin to to back up and to back up and before you know it he's he's got the upper hand on us and he's he's overtaken something and all the while joshua joshua was standing there next to us saying just draw the sword just draw the sword i you've i've already defeated everything around him but you've got to defeat this one because it's in your case i i know that everybody in here is just as frustrated as i've been it's time to get the devil out of our cave it's time to get all of these all of these unbeliefs and all these doubts and all these regrets and and everything that we go through as humans it's time to draw them out of our cave and it's time to deal with them i believe we have the anointing it's on the earth right now i believe i believe the angels are commissioned to deal with these five kings that we have that have been living inside a body that is not theirs they have been driven into a cave that is not theirs and it's time to draw them out joshua said okay now now it's time and he said mighty men of war come and put your foot on the neck of these five kings i don't know about you but there's been many times in my life when i love to put the foot on this imagination when i love to put the foot on this you ever get into a situation maybe with somebody else in the church and before you know it you've you've built this whole story in your mind that that brother didn't brother paul you didn't shake my hand last time i was here so brother paul must really hate me you know i bet he's talking to his brother about me and i bet now ben doesn't like me and i bet it's just going around and you know what brother paul just didn't even see my hand out this example he always shakes my hand but you see that's how the devil works and then before you know it you can't sit there and be in fellowship and you can't be in peace in the church because there's something that's happened that nobody's aware of but you and that's how the devil works and then you'll withdraw i'll withdraw from paul and now i'm not going to shake paul's hand well now paul's going to think oh well he's definitely got something against me you see how the spirit of division works in a church and then before you know it the song leader is trying to have to plow through that spirit of division even to make some joy come into the sanctuary i know we don't deal with that here but i've just seen it happen in my life and then the pastor comes out and he wants to preach and he can't hardly get it get to preaching because there's so much contention between something that's not real but but the prophet taught us that the spirit of god will bring a true reality to the church it will bring a true reality to our mind that we can look at things how god sees them and we can look and say brother paul maybe you didn't shake my hand but i'm going to shake your hand anyway you know why because perfect love will cast out all fear i don't have to fear whether paul likes me or not because i know because i have perfect love for him and he's got perfect love for me and even though the devil would love to wedge himself in between us he can't because we have perfect love and if the whole church can get that unity amongst themselves what could we do for the lord i believe we all have a burden to do something for the lord it's the anointing of the age we want to get in the flood we want to get in the stream we see the power of god moving and it's anointing and it's placing and we want to be in that stream but perfect love has got to be our guide we'll never get there by our own will we've got to surrender it we've got to surrender that will there's a battleground for everything i just read that quote where brother branham said that the devil chose he chose the mind as his battleground in this context of scripture the mouth of this cave is the battleground it's our self-will the holy spirit is drawing it out it's drawing it out and it's our it's it's our obligation to deal with it amen we can't just let it get back in the cave because you know what it'll get back in the cave and he'll start getting stronger he'll start growing bolder i know this is pretty sunday school stuff but just what the lord gave me there's a battle front where they meet and test their powers where each army tested strength and against the other army a mutual meeting place now don't miss this when this great battle started on earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and the battlegrounds begin in the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of battle where where it was to begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind right simple enough right right you think we could just well i'm just not going to decide to do that i'm just not going to decide to to be weak in faith but it's just not that simple is it i think it's more of more of a personal thing maybe for me tonight but but the devil can work through people he can work through you and there's nothing i hate more than when i realize that the devil has worked through me and i've made a mistake and i've said the wrong thing and i've i i've i've maybe even even unknowingly turned a cold shoulder or or or said something the wrong way or or set something against somebody or and and when you get that realization that the devil has used you there's nothing more painful for a believer to know that i let him get the best of me i let him get the best of me but but there's a time to deal with it and i think we've all been through different scenarios and different things where we know that the devil has got the best of us but under the joshua ministry he's called out those five kings he said we don't have to let them back in the cave we don't have to let them back where where they where they can reside and where they can have peace and and and and i just want to point out that this is not their cave you know the devil doesn't have a domain he doesn't have a home he doesn't have anywhere to go he doesn't have keys he doesn't have a house he doesn't have anywhere unless we give it to him he must have something to work through he's got to have somebody to work through he's got to have lips to work through just like the lord's got to have feet to walk and he's going to have hands to lift and he's got to have voices to praise but the devil has to have the same thing so our weapon is choice who are we going to let use us who are we going to let use us and i know we're in here tonight because we want to do something for the lord we want to be in his perfect will we want to walk in his perfect glide and we don't want to miss anything that the lord has for us so our weapon is choice and so maybe we've let these five kings dwell in our cave and they've been in there for maybe 20 years or five years or just just a few years but it's time to draw them out and to deal with them and joshua calls his men back and he says put your foot on the necks of these kings now now the the devil has messed with you your entire life and he's used your memory against you and he's used your imagination against you but under this commission you have been given the authority to place your foot upon the neck of that imagination it's not it's not it's not just for another age gone by that we read about in the bible but it's right now it's today that we have the power under this message to draw those kings out of the cave and say it's time for me to put my neck on top of you it's time for a perfect church to rise up it's time for a perfect believer to accept a perfect word under a perfect prophet and decide that this is the truth i'm not going back and i'm not retreating and i'm not letting you back in that cave but i'll pull you out if i have to die fighting but i've already been promised that i will overcome you i will put you under my feet i will put you under subjection i will put you where you belong because i am anointed to do it in this age not in another age in this age the hardest stage the most evil age the darkest age i have been anointed you have been anointed to defeat every enemy that comes in front of you now i know we get high in faith and it sounds good but then monday rolls around and we we think oh we're back in the corner again draw that king out of the cave it's time to deal with it friends we don't have much time left and i believe it's the time he's got to have something to work through remember remember when when jesus was preaching his sermon and and he felt a pull in his heart and there was a crazy man praying and he crosses the sea and he steps one foot on the sea and the devil realizes my time's up i pray that the devil inside that has been warring in our mind would realize that tonight time's up jesus has set his foot on the shore time's up and see the devil's got to have something to work through he's got to have a power to work through a life source to work through he doesn't have life of his own he's got to work through somebody even if it's a bunch of pigs he's got to go somewhere why don't you put him where he belongs he does not belong in your cave he does not belong in your mind he does not belong in your home he belongs in a bunch of pigs that they couldn't stand them either so they drove themselves off a cliff too long have we made a home for the devil where he feels comfortable where we're scared to upset him and and we think that we're going to upset the devil but i say draw him out of the cave no more devil do you have a place in my home no more do you have a place in my mind god said i can have a sound mind the power of a sound mind to have faith in god's word you know the devil only has one weapon and it's unbelief if we can overcome his one weapon you already know how he's gonna you know if i have a sword you don't know exactly how i'm gonna come at you i might swing this way and maybe maybe throw a hook in there or maybe kick the devil's only got one one weapon you know he's gonna attack you on the authority of the word you already know where the battleground is it's on the authority of the word and i believe in our day with these eyes we've witnessed more things more authority in god's word than any generation before us i believe we have we have seen god in the miraculous but if he never did another miracle in my life i would know that there's absolute authority in his word i would know that this will defeat the devil anytime any place anywhere you just tried and see friends you just put this word before you as you go you know how israel did it first they would sing a song first they would praise the lord and then they would put the ark of the covenant out before him and they would go anywhere that they wanted to go you know why because there's authority when you worship the word our praises are not to worship some building or some wood or some stage or some piano is to worship the word which is him which is the one who came and he said it's time to deal with these enemies in your life you've been given the authority put your foot on his neck it feels good go ahead put your foot just yeah remember that devil that tried to get you to stop coming tonight remember that devil that's been asked you if you had a week like i had remember the devil that's been at you all week put your foot on his neck [Applause] when god walked with just man alone by himself he had favor with god but when man begin to multiply and begin to get others and others and others they begin satan having more of a range to work in this man might believe a little bit leaning that way and the other one a little bit this way then when satan comes in he just fires it on then it becomes this and that and imaginations begin to come great and then corruption sets in brother graham's talking this is in the message the ark he's talking about noah's day but i just i just felt that that was appropriate he's got to have something to work in and when it was just adam and god there was it was perfect harmony it was it was perfect communion he's got to have something to work through something to work in and he and the more that man grew and the more the intelligent they got and the more they built and the more they conquered and the more they the more they they got civilized the more smarter they got satan had a playground to work through but there's been a promise in our age to be restored to be restored back to where it was at the beginning when adam walked with god in the cool of the evening and he heard his he heard his voice and he felt his worship and god the creator who created all things by his power through his spoken word and everything that is is the word of god made manifest the entire word was made and how we do error when we try to ignore god's word or try to limit god's power by our own imagination how we do error when we try to limit god's word by our imagination i just that quote really dealt with me because it's me god's power is not limited god god's authority is not limited in his his ability to heal and his ability to save and his ability to reach out and catch that lost loved one his power is not limited but it's by my imagination that his power is limited and and i believe it's time to deal with that spirit so let's just call he says the first one is imagination let's just call imagination o king come out and joshua says come out of the cave and joshua doesn't do it himself he calls the men and he says put your foot on his neck where's authority i'm on top of him he can't work through me anymore amen and sometimes we just got to tell the devil you're not going to work through me anymore and you've taken my imagination and you've built this false narrative and you've built this impossible situation but what is that to god what is that to god in his power that he can't move that mountain and what is that mountain before god that it won't become a plane before him but take that imagination out of the cave and put your foot on top of his neck and say no more i'm casting down imagination it belongs under my feet it does not belong dominating my thoughts and dominating my mind but i'm gonna cast it down by the power of the holy spirit see without the holy ghost these things are not possible without a joshua in your life these things are not possible if you're trying to do it by your own will and your own abilities and trying to overcome by your strength it will never happen but by the power of the holy ghost the holy ghost has claimed dominion over that cave and he said it's time to roll away the stone and it's time to deal with these things that we've tucked away back in the cave and it's time to put them under subjection that's our calling in this hour amen limit god's power by our own imagination we don't have time to go through each thing and i know that everybody's well taught here and you know where these gates end up and but it's but but i believe in this age satan has brought a challenge to the bride of christ did these things really happen did the lord really deal with the prophet that way did those miracles really take place did those things happen exactly in that order in exactly that way and and and did did he really meet you do you really know the lord is this really the truth or or was that some and before you know it he's attacked every memory that you have of having a relationship with the lord and he's attacked he's attacked every everything that you found to be a foundation he's attacked well did that really happen did that really there and he'll try to he'll try to just just fog that memory a little bit i found that that was interesting that that was one of the one of the symptoms of kovid was to a memory fog because you see right at that time the devil was trying to bring a memory fog across the bride of christ and say well did these things really happen was that really the way it was but i believe it's time to deal with that memory spirit hallelujah amen i was there when it happened to me i was there kind of like job right remember he went through a little memory fog and he had found himself down in the slumps and down at the mouth of a cave of self-will and and and his friends were saying well that you know just give it up you know it wasn't what you thought it was why don't you just make make something of your life from this moment on and why don't you just would just turn it around it's not too late to turn it around but job knew that there had there was something that had taken place there was a relationship with with god at some point that he had that was so strong and even though satan came against his memory with everything he had job knew there was something that happened one time i knew i used to have a relationship with a higher being out there and i knew it came through his word and i knew it came through fellowship and and job had found himself there on an ash heap wondering is it real is is he really out there and then he's got his best friends to come and whittle down on that memory a little bit more say no that never happened or no that wasn't real or no you never felt that or you were just emotional or you were just caught up in the affections of what was going on and that didn't really happen and job just began to get foggy in his memory amen but what job didn't know was that god had commissioned satan to do that because god had so much trust in job that he said hit him with everything you've got he won't forsake me now this might not mean much to you looking at it like job but what about you tonight what about this church tonight god has had so much confidence in this group of people that he said hit him with everything you've got they'll not forsake me they might have a memory fog and they might go through a battle but they won't turn their back on me because i know what's in him because i know i met job and we talked and we fellowshipped and i placed a seed within him that he cannot turn his back on me job couldn't do it with all the demons in hell against him he could not turn his back on god because god was already in him god had beat satan to the punch what about you tonight why are you still here why are you still believing because god already put a seed within you that no matter how many demons no matter how much hell comes against you you cannot turn your back on god you cannot turn your back on the truth because it's already been planted in there that you will see it all the way through we will stop short on the finish line we will not stop just out of breath when we're almost there we will make it all the way because we know i was there when the sons of god shouted for joy i was there when the morning star sang i was there when the spirit came i was there when the miracles happened i was there in those dark times when i overcame you can't turn your back on it it's too late god already beat satan's doubts to the punch he placed within you the seed of victory and no matter the wiles of the greatest enemy could come against you you will not turn your back on god you might have memory fog for a season but you won't turn your back on god you might in your own mind say i i give up i'm walking away this is not for me it never was real but in your heart of hearts god got there first before there ever was a flesh before there ever was an atom before there ever was a a particle in the air god got to your soul first and he placed within there a seed to overcome every self-will and by overcoming every self-will we can overcome every imagination every reason it's in our power this is the time to deal with it if i get a little excited but in my mind walking up here i said this is going to be more of a teaching message but when the lord takes over amen no man has a right to preach the gospel no person has a right to call themselves a christian until they can go back to a certain time in their life where they could come on that sacred sands at the back side of the desert where they know that they have met god all the infidels in the world and all these intellectual giants taking the bible and explaining away all the days of miracles their past there's no such a thing as divine healing all this stuff like speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and gifts of healing and the baptism of the holy spirit now brother branham was preaching about this in 1960 what does it mean for us today they can slip in and take your mind and twist you in such a way until they can take that away from your memory they can explain it away i want you to get this and don't ever let it pass from you but if a man's ever stood on that sacred sands at the back side of the desert when he meets god face to face there's not enough devils in hell could take that away from him he knows he met god he knows he's had an experience he talked to god regardless of what the opposition is he can say from that time something changed me no matter what memory comes against you you have the authority to put that memory under your foot every condemnation every sin of the past every mistake every regret every memory that the devil would use against you you have the authority to put it under your foot and by god's grace that memory will be destroyed and you will never remember it again i can't wait till we get over there you know what it's going to be like when we don't have one regret we don't have one one thing that we wish we wouldn't have said or wish we wouldn't have did or wish we would have acted this way when we get over there that's why he said their perfect piece because that memory is under our feet it's time it's time friends we're not going to have time to deal with with all these things but maybe we'll come back and deal with it but brother braham says what we need is to wait till we hear the voice of god as individuals every man and woman in this convention no matter if it's jim jones or the rest of them that's with you if they don't do it you do it anyhow you pull yourself back in the cave and wait there until god speaks to you don't you move he will do it don't you move he will do it hold your position this is a time to stand this is not a time to run this is not a time to grow weary this is a time to hold right where we're at i know this message is the truth does that change that satan comes against me no but i know this message is the truth i know i'm a son of god i know that god loves me i know that his word is supreme authority does that change the enemy coming against me no he's going to fight me harder but i know that's where job got the revelation because god says he knows he knows try him on every angle try him on every hand take his loved ones take his money take his house take the shelter over his head take his health he knows and i would ask ourselves tonight do we know have we met god on the sacred sands and we know we've had a real genuine experience with the lord because he's still giving out experiences he's still giving out salvation he's still filling with the holy ghost but we've got to get it while he's here he knew and that was the only reason he could overcome that's right the revelation shook him i can't lose because i know i was there when they shouted for glory i was there before this time was ever in existence brother ram said the christian has not one worry in the world they should be the most freest happiest people in the world because there's nothing you can't lose that's a prophetic promise you can't lose and i'm not just pumping you up so you feel good i believe we covered this you've got to meet god on the sacred sands and when you had an experience with god and god moves something inside your life you can't lose there's not a devil that can take you down there's not a cancer that can take you down there's not a depression that can take you down oh it might affect you it might plague you and you might be down on your luck and you might be down in your body but you cannot lose god can't lose you more than he can lose half of himself we've got to we've got to stop giving him room to work with us that's right amen it's time to deal with some things we know we've let satan work with us right we've know we let him use us in in in in our time in our efforts we're all guilty friends but it's time to deal with it if we could turn the scripture revelations 20 in the first verse and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit in a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed for a season now i read that scripture and it brings me rejoicing it brings me joy because he shall not have authority or dominion or a voice or a place to work and you know brother man said that chain is not like a log chain it wasn't like a binding chain but it was a chain of circumstance i believe we know that and later he would say that that chain of circumstances because the devil didn't have anything to work with he didn't have anybody to work through he didn't have a mind to occupy he didn't have a mouth to occupy he didn't have hands to occupy because the people of god got to a place where they drew him out of the cave entirely you don't have any more to work with with me devil you know what every time he works and i see him working and i see him using me you've just exposed another weakness you don't have any more to work there you don't have another you don't have another breath in there because we've been given authority to cast him down we don't have to take it in there we don't have to let him have dominion in there but we have been given authority to chain him down by circumstance the church that's on earth is redeemed and right in the presence of christ so he has nothing he can work on so it's not a chain as i said a log chain it's a chain of circumstance and he has nothing he can do he's helpless he's hopeless just waiting for the resurrection of the subjects that really puts the devil in his good place right he's helpless he's hopeless there's nothing he can do but it's by the weapon of choice true we're given challenges every day in our life choose you this day right are you going to serve god you serve men who are we going to serve i know this is a little bit of sunday school but take it down to another level right the weapon of choice we're not going to let the devil have dominion in our case we're not going to let the devil have a little home in there you know what he's starved to death in there we come to church and we sing the praises and we hear the we hear the word and we go home we listen to a tape and that's just choking the life out of that devil it's just choking the life out of him and now is the time to draw him out of the cave you had me for a season but god promised me the victory finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand what day the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins get about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and having done all we can to stand you know what brother paul there's nothing else i can do but stand on the word of god i'm not standing on my own will or my own ability or my own will to overcome but i'm standing on the word of god there's not a demon that can come against that there's not an oppression that could come against that there's not a spiritual wickedness in high places that can come against that because it is the supreme authority and if we can stand upon that rock amen for we for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ can i just read that fifth verse out of the amplified we are destroying sophisticated arguments and every exalted and proud thing that sets itself up against the true knowledge of god and we are taking every thought and purpose captive to the obedience of christ where's the devil belong under your feet where's that oppression that you fought your whole life belong under your feet we are taking captive every purpose every plane of the devil every stronghold he has everything that he's had power it's time there we knew there was coming a time when the devil would lose his power i'm here to announce it's time this is the moment where the devil loses power on the church of god where he's lost hold in your life you remember the moment when you first fell in love with jesus and you felt like a huge weight just lifted off of you and you knew there was something that changed but yet we go through battle after battle after battle but there is coming a day there is coming a time and joshua could tell the sun to stand still and there's never been a day like that since day but there's never been a day like this day where the devil loses complete hold on the children of god every son and daughter of god is promised to go free because you were there before the foundation of the world before there was ever a thought you were god how can he lose us friends how is he going to forsake us how is he going to leave us hanging he cannot do it his power is limitless there is nothing impossible with god there's no there's no we've got to clean every channel the problem is we've got logs boxed up because you know we've let our imagination take over we built maybe a false dialogue that god doesn't want to answer that prayer that god doesn't want to move on our behalf on that need and now we have a log jammed up in that channel but it's time to move the logs it's time to brother ramsey said let an atomic bomb come in there and in getting in the spirit he said let the logs blow out of the way and clear every channel that god can work through you and every mouth and every hand and every eye and every year that god can have preeminence in every cave in this building i believe that there is a perfect church i believe we make up that perfect church i believe there are people standing here that will not taste death that will not taste of the things of the devil because we've been made more than conquerors in this age and we will overcome every enemy against us i can't say it enough there is not enough devils that can stop you from victory there is not enough depression that can stop you from victory because you have been made to overcome it in this age right now by the power of the holy ghost is that it's time to draw them out of the cave and put your foot on top of their neck don't be nice to the devil he's not your friend he's not your pal put him under your foot put him under your foot and say devil i've had enough i'm drawing the line today i'm not going back to where i was yesterday i'm not going back to the habits that i battled with last week but i've had enough and i'm drawing the line he belongs under your foot you've already been given the victory drive everything out of those channels we want to be used by the lord we want to have him use us freely we've got to clear the channels out of our mind those those five senses are fine as long as they line up with the word your imagination and your reason that's fine as long as it lines up with the word you can use it but as soon as the devil brings twisting in there and you let that live on top of that brother graham said you'll grow a deformed faith why because you've let that channel be clogged so long that you have a lopsided plant because this channel is clogged but it's time to clear out the channel it's time to let god have all we just stand to our feet tonight we've got to drive every king out of the cave we can't stop to reason we can't stop the question and i mean lord knows we got a lot of quotes we could cover that but i believe we're all we know where we're headed with that but if we just stop and let the devil have have his way just just for a moment you remember the testimony of nellie sanders brother bam said it was the first time he'd ever cast a demon out of somebody remember he had he had he had witnessed to her and she gave her heart to the lord and she was living a good christian life and and she was trying to do good yes she was just walking down the street and heard a little music playing a little memory from her past and it caught her before you know it she was in there dancing and she was in there doing the things she used to do but something was different about her you see when she was dancing five or six years before that there was no condemnation there there was nothing that she felt sorry for she was making money doing it and she was good at it but you see she meant the lord and just stopping for just a moment caused her to fall but when you know him when you when you've been face to face with him when you've met him on the sacred stands she went to the very place that would have brought judgment upon her the pastor's house she ran and she banged on the door in the middle of the night i've done a terrible thing most of us most me am i am i growing up in my teenage years i would have ran from the pastor's house well because it was my dad and i would have gotten real trouble but see something had happened to her a reality had taken place is there grace for me and because she repented she was delivered there's there's deliverance in repentance we're not out none of us are too big none of us have not lived this life long enough or we think that we're somehow superior but just one moment in god's presence and that repentance will bring deliverance i like the way brother branham says he says we're following our captain the captain of deliverance when one rises up against you whack him down when that amazing imagination rises up against you whack it down when that memory rises up against you whack it down cast it down why because we're overcoming one battle at a time i believe i believe we're looking at the promised land i believe we're just right there at the finish line we're not gonna stop short we're not gonna we're not gonna falter but because we've been given a promised word i'm preaching to the elect of god tonight because we've been given a promised word in this hour we cannot lose but it's time to deal with the situations in our life lord i don't want to have any more unbelief i don't want to have any hindrance i want to be used completely by you [Music] we all have a sword of faith it's time to use it i don't know what everybody's burden is or what what your need is tonight but i know that your sort of faith can be used to overcome that burden i wonder if we could just bow our heads and ask that the lord would move upon those behalfs we've done all that we can to stand and we're still standing not by our mind or not by our power but it's by that holy spirit that we met that one we came face to face with that knows you've been made more than a conqueror father lord i i i just want to surrender more of me tonight lord father let let your holy spirit come in and scour me out father take every everything every dark cave every tunnel father every oppression father i pray that you'd scour it out with the power of your word father lord i lift my hands and say lord i i surrender everything that i am to you i don't want to hold on to one thing or have one memory father against you lord i want to remember back before there was

camp father lord i believe we've been placed in this age to overcome every every enemy father every demon i believe we've been anointed and chosen to cast down every imagination lord to cast down all things that exalt themselves above your word father i pray that we can lord just search us oh god [Music] lord let us make a surrender to you god we might be walking this walk a long time but lord

people in the world lord we've been given a promise we've been given a promise of life after this chaos this is not our home and this is not our life but we have a a home just on the other side lord i
