[22:13] amen thank you
[22:14] amen god bless you this evening
[22:17] let's turn if we could in the scripture
[22:19] thank the musicians
[22:21] all this evening i want to go straight
[22:22] to daniel chapter nine
[22:24] and
[22:26] i just have to turn there with me i
[22:29] just have so many different parts ahead
[22:31] of me
[22:32] here and
[22:42] daniel
[22:43] chapter 9
[22:47] and i want to read here just um
[22:51] a few verses let's begin at verse 1.
[22:55] we read from this here a few weeks back
[22:59] and
[23:00] to start out when we just were drawn to
[23:02] that that thought of the honest
[23:04] reflection
[23:05] and i want to just start here tonight in
[23:07] reading just to deal with
[23:09] the thought in verse 1 it says in the
[23:11] first year of darius the son of hezrus
[23:14] of the seed of the medes which was made
[23:16] king over the realm
[23:18] of the chaldeans in the first year of
[23:20] this reign i daniel
[23:22] understood by books the number
[23:25] of the years whereof the word of the
[23:27] lord came to jeremiah the prophet that
[23:30] he would accomplish 70 years in the
[23:33] desolations of jerusalem i want you to
[23:37] notice what what understanding did
[23:39] for daniel daniel's daniel's a prophet
[23:43] he is one who is set aside by god
[23:46] that the understanding what is to be
[23:49] alerted that that moment would come
[23:52] forth to the people of god you see it's
[23:54] one thing to read
[23:56] read the scriptures read the bible but
[23:58] it takes god to come on the scene to
[24:01] interpret it and the way god interprets
[24:03] it
[24:04] is by manifesting it
[24:06] and his presence remember part of that
[24:08] manifestation was god would begin to
[24:11] deal with the hearts of the people and
[24:13] cause the people's hearts to turn back
[24:16] to whole
[24:17] so
[24:18] in verse 3 look look how daniel
[24:20] approaches this
[24:22] and i set my face
[24:24] unto the lord god to seek by prayer and
[24:27] supplications with fasting and sackcloth
[24:31] and ashes and i prayed unto the lord my
[24:34] god and made confession and said o lord
[24:37] the great and dreadful god keeping the
[24:39] covenant and mercy to them that love him
[24:42] and to them that keep his commandments
[24:45] you may the lord bless you you're being
[24:46] seated i'd like to continue on here
[24:50] and i'd like to go to verse
[24:53] verse
[24:54] 16
[24:57] in that same chapter
[25:01] it says oh lord here's daniel remember
[25:03] daniel as we said he began to he began
[25:05] to see the hour
[25:07] and begin to go ahead and make
[25:08] confession see when understanding of the
[25:11] word has come you put him in a place to
[25:13] really begin to confess
[25:16] not only that of his own sins but that
[25:19] of the nation
[25:20] and begin to confess because god was
[25:22] coming here and visiting going to come
[25:25] to visit israel in that time for
[25:26] deliverance now what i what i want you
[25:28] to to glean from this here in this
[25:31] scriptures we'll read in verse 16
[25:34] here when we read from verse 16 in
[25:36] through i think i'm going to read
[25:37] through verse 20 at least i want you to
[25:40] notice how where daniel and what the
[25:42] objective is of his prayer
[25:45] when daniel here in verse 16 he says oh
[25:47] lord according to all thy righteousness
[25:49] i beseech thee let thine anger and thy
[25:52] fury be turned away from thy city
[25:54] jerusalem thy holy mountain because for
[25:56] our sins and for the iniquities of our
[25:59] fathers jerusalem and thy people are
[26:02] become a reproach to all that are about
[26:04] us now therefore o our god
[26:07] hear the prayer of thy servant and his
[26:10] supplications and cause thy face to
[26:12] shine upon thy sanctuary that is
[26:15] desolate for the lord's sake
[26:18] o my god incline thine ear and hear open
[26:22] thine eyes and behold our desolations
[26:25] and the city which is called by thy name
[26:27] for we do not present our supplications
[26:30] before thee for our righteousnesses but
[26:33] for thy great mercies
[26:35] notice how when daniel is praying
[26:38] it has nothing to do with him
[26:41] or what they could present but when the
[26:44] word itself has come it immediately it
[26:46] leads to a place of repentance because
[26:49] when the word is unfolded even in the
[26:52] age that we are living in in that lady
[26:54] ocean age when the cry goes out be
[26:57] zealous therefore and repent and brother
[26:59] branham would speak to us in that age
[27:01] and he says it's not only there is very
[27:04] there are many that are true that have
[27:07] to repent
[27:08] there were many many of us and i'll say
[27:11] even more uh that when the word itself
[27:14] come to bring correction there are
[27:15] things that had to be repented of even
[27:18] of people that were walking in line and
[27:20] in step with all of the light that they
[27:22] saw in that hour but when the light
[27:24] comes to show up it also shows the areas
[27:28] that are are not in line with god's word
[27:31] and that requires repentance
[27:33] so you find one thing god is always
[27:36] moved by repentance
[27:38] and that and that it will move the heart
[27:40] of god even as it moved even though it
[27:42] moved the heart of god even when it came
[27:43] to ahab ahab would never ever change he
[27:46] would never become a true believer
[27:49] through and through but when he put on
[27:51] sackcloth and ashes god said i will not
[27:53] do it in his time but i'll bring it upon
[27:55] his household
[27:56] god respects repentance and we know that
[27:59] from the scripture so here with
[28:01] repentance precedes the opening
[28:04] unfolding daniel knows this is a time
[28:07] that god promised that he would visit
[28:09] and that understanding begins to come
[28:11] that this is the time of the fulfillment
[28:14] of that 70 years
[28:15] and to see even as he goes on to say in
[28:18] verse 19 oh lord hear oh lord forgive oh
[28:22] lord hearken and do do fear not defer
[28:25] not for thine own sake o my god for thy
[28:28] city and thy people are called by thy
[28:31] name
[28:32] so if
[28:33] when you look at the whole of those
[28:35] verses
[28:37] daniel's face when he said i set my face
[28:39] here he is he's facing he is his person
[28:43] he's presenting his life it's it's so if
[28:46] we can say it in this manner daniel was
[28:49] a man that was upright before god you
[28:51] could not put a finger on his life the
[28:53] scripture was recorded and found no spot
[28:56] in thee
[28:57] his life because he lived a life that
[28:59] was pleasing to the lord yet daniel did
[29:02] not have the holy spirit as you and i
[29:06] would be blessed to be partakers of it
[29:08] by the new birth
[29:10] because we're living on this side of
[29:11] calvary on this side of the atonement
[29:14] but daniel was able to live a victorious
[29:17] life an overcoming life right in the
[29:19] midst of babylon and when this begins to
[29:22] unfold daniel it's it's as though
[29:25] things just turn it up a notch in
[29:28] daniel's life you know it's one thing it
[29:30] wasn't daniel was living softly but when
[29:33] daniel begin to understand these things
[29:35] this is time it's like daniel said i'm
[29:37] going to turn up my praise i'm gonna
[29:39] turn it up just a little bit i'm gonna
[29:41] zero in just a little bit more he's just
[29:44] gonna i'm tuning right in and notice how
[29:46] it tunes in
[29:48] he's focused on that this is not about
[29:50] us lord this is you coming to fulfill
[29:53] your word
[29:55] it's not our righteousness we have none
[29:57] it's your righteousness it's not our
[30:00] mercies it's your mercies so daniel had
[30:03] first things first he was really god was
[30:06] putting god first in everything and i'll
[30:08] say it in this moment that you and i are
[30:11] living in and i want to just speak here
[30:12] for a moment on desperation and an
[30:15] announcement it's time to leave that's
[30:17] right amen i want to just speak just a
[30:19] few moments desperation it's time to
[30:22] leave
[30:24] you see we've heard when we we look at
[30:26] all of this that it comes into a place
[30:29] that there's all sorts of things that
[30:31] will come even when a promise as it's
[30:33] coming to pass to try to distract to try
[30:36] to take away even in the days of the
[30:38] lord jesus there was all sorts of things
[30:40] that rose up before the coming of the
[30:43] messiah men who led them out into the
[30:45] wilderness and said they were this and
[30:47] said they were that just like when god
[30:49] sent the message in this hour all sorts
[30:51] of elijah's robes and everything else
[30:53] but all of that is to detract or try to
[30:56] take away from the original but it
[30:59] doesn't matter how many phony things the
[31:01] enemy sends
[31:03] he cannot
[31:04] deceive the elect
[31:08] it doesn't matter how many
[31:09] disappointments because i i can say this
[31:11] right now i no doubt i'm speaking to
[31:14] individuals that seen a lot of things i
[31:16] know i spoke even when i think of even
[31:19] you know from my dad my dad seen
[31:21] different things even back in the realm
[31:23] where he was at in the church seeing
[31:25] things that wasn't right others could
[31:27] see things that weren't wholesome and
[31:29] you know seeing this taking place and
[31:31] this taking place that was ungodly but
[31:33] you recognize that seed on the inside
[31:36] though it cannot explain things but when
[31:39] god's light flashes across your pathway
[31:42] let me tell you it's a communication
[31:44] between god and his children personally
[31:47] it's not something that has to be
[31:49] explained it's not even something that
[31:51] you even realize what's taking place but
[31:54] you recognize god is present there's
[31:57] something taking place here that's more
[31:59] real that's more precious and what
[32:01] happens in your life you start to tune
[32:03] in onto that voice
[32:05] and as you tune in on that voice you're
[32:07] tuning out other voices
[32:09] there's a lot of voices that are all
[32:12] around us
[32:13] but if there ever ever was a time that
[32:15] we need to turn it down and really turn
[32:18] down and really focus upon the things
[32:21] that that we see even things that we see
[32:24] taking place this this is an hour where
[32:27] we need to be very focused upon the
[32:30] things of god amen
[32:34] and i i just
[32:36] just just from my heart just looking at
[32:38] these times that we're living in
[32:41] you know we're not i'm not going to say
[32:43] we're living in the end time we're in
[32:45] the end of the end time
[32:48] that's where we're at
[32:50] now let me just say this no man knoweth
[32:52] the day nor the hour
[32:54] but the prophet could announce to us
[32:56] here in the feast of the trumpets he
[32:58] says we know we're living in the season
[33:01] of his coming
[33:03] because the signs that were that were
[33:06] ordained to be here in that time
[33:09] we see those signs around us we see as
[33:12] it was in the days of noah we see where
[33:14] people are taken up with eating drinking
[33:17] building and all those other things and
[33:19] and as brother ram place and flashing
[33:21] red lights is coming it's nothing wrong
[33:23] with those things as long as they're in
[33:25] the right perspective and the right
[33:27] order is that right but they became so
[33:30] occupied with those things that was
[33:33] where their worship was
[33:36] yes and and those people brother adam
[33:39] would say it like this they had faith
[33:42] but he says remember faith in the wrong
[33:44] thing is unbelief
[33:47] because they were taking things that
[33:49] here the noah was ministering under
[33:52] inspiration from god there was a message
[33:54] of judgment that was upon the earth but
[33:57] god in the midst of that judgment
[33:59] provided a message that could warn
[34:02] judgment is coming but to those that
[34:04] could hear that message they could hear
[34:06] the call of mercy they could hear the
[34:08] same grace that was revealed to noah and
[34:11] god had a man by the name of noah who
[34:13] found grace in the eyes of the lord and
[34:15] because that man was set aside grace
[34:18] could utter into the earth and call out
[34:21] the subjects that were ordained for the
[34:23] ark
[34:25] yes
[34:26] what grace in that hour
[34:28] amen that for many that could come
[34:30] around the ark all they heard was
[34:32] doomsday but not the elect the election
[34:34] heard mercy amen
[34:37] the electorate mercy amen
[34:40] the message that you and i
[34:42] are under in this hour let me just say
[34:44] it the bible that you and i hold in our
[34:47] hand was written for this hour amen
[34:52] the tanks the shadows
[34:54] all of us all of that was written for
[34:56] this hour
[34:58] everything that spoke of the groom
[35:00] speaks of the bride we see the types we
[35:02] see the day we see the time that we're
[35:05] living in the seals have been taken off
[35:07] of the book that's just not a saying
[35:09] that's a reality
[35:11] and when the seals are taken off that
[35:13] means it's time for understanding to be
[35:17] released what are you saying
[35:18] understanding understanding for
[35:20] preparation of departure amen
[35:27] we're living in a we're living in an
[35:29] awesome time
[35:30] we're living in a great time
[35:32] not for the world
[35:34] it's a scary time for the world
[35:37] let me just say it it's a scary time for
[35:39] anyone outside from under the blood of
[35:42] jesus christ
[35:44] i'm saying to you tonight it's a time to
[35:46] where if you're outside from the blood
[35:48] of jesus christ don't take for granted
[35:50] that you'll have the next moment or the
[35:52] next service you don't have that promise
[35:54] to you amen but it's right now at this
[35:57] moment and i would say don't even wait
[35:59] till the ministering is over get your
[36:01] heart right with god right now
[36:07] you see we're living in a time as a i
[36:09] think you know we've been
[36:11] just looking at things and i was just
[36:14] fellowshipping yesterday in the car
[36:17] with uh paul we were writing
[36:20] and i told him i said i'm ready to go
[36:21] preach right now i wasn't
[36:23] going to preach this but
[36:25] just so stirred with the things we begin
[36:27] to fellowship
[36:28] and he said daddy says if you notice he
[36:30] says there's things he said
[36:32] that even in the past he said year and
[36:34] past few years he said notice he said
[36:36] there's been changes he said in the
[36:38] messages coming forth
[36:41] there's been changes that's been taking
[36:43] place in the urgency that is upon us and
[36:46] among us
[36:48] you know why that is god's trying to get
[36:51] his elect ready to go
[36:55] god's objective isn't that we would
[36:56] become more comfortable in this world
[36:59] that we're living let's just face the
[37:01] facts
[37:02] our flesh loves things to be comfortable
[37:05] and easy
[37:07] right right and we had a choice to sit
[37:10] on a wooden chair or go send a lazy boy
[37:12] we'll go send a lazy boy i mean i may
[37:15] beat you there to it
[37:16] we we want the things of comfort but you
[37:19] recognize that in this time that we we
[37:22] are living in
[37:23] feathers are taken out of the nest
[37:26] the message that we have believed we
[37:29] have preached this time is upon us
[37:32] i realize i'm not i don't know the day
[37:35] nor the hour but i know in this reason i
[37:38] know this result right now is when god's
[37:40] presence moves upon a life you we live
[37:43] as though he can come in the next moment
[37:47] that it's a joy i thought of this here
[37:49] just yesterday and you know
[37:52] pardon me here just for just taking on
[37:53] my quote for a few moments i was just i
[37:56] was just just praying just yesterday
[37:58] evening and i was laying there and i
[37:59] began to just just just talking to the
[38:01] lord and looking at and just just
[38:04] meditating on different things and just
[38:05] praying and i said oh god
[38:08] just begin to just just strike my heart
[38:10] i said lord what joy because if you
[38:13] tarry i'm going to have joy because my
[38:15] joy is in you
[38:17] but lord if you come in the next moment
[38:20] well i know i have to wait to see him
[38:22] but i'm going to see my daddy
[38:26] oh i tell you i begin to pray that began
[38:28] to come it was such a sweet that came
[38:30] into the room at that time
[38:32] such a charge that came into the room
[38:34] you see it's like that woman she was on
[38:36] the ship and she knew at that moment she
[38:40] knew they said the ship looks like it's
[38:42] going down she began to worship and she
[38:44] began to praise and they say what are
[38:46] you doing she says i got a daughter in
[38:48] new york if this makes it there
[38:50] i'll see her but if this goes down
[38:53] right here i've already got a daughter
[38:55] in glory i'll see that one she was
[38:58] living in a state of joy amen
[39:04] oh glory
[39:05] the time is certainly upon us you know
[39:08] when i i want to just just draw your
[39:10] attention here when we look at even the
[39:13] preparations that was made for departure
[39:16] you see in this hour
[39:18] god wrote it i i don't have time to read
[39:21] all these scriptures but in the book of
[39:22] habitual it's wrote write the vision
[39:25] make it plain
[39:27] that him that readeth it might run
[39:30] hallelujah god wrote it but in this hour
[39:34] it's moved from writing to flesh
[39:38] amen amen the taking of the book is
[39:40] where the book becomes flesh
[39:43] men not just in a prophet's life but in
[39:45] the life of the bride of jesus christ
[39:49] amen where the life is the display of
[39:52] this bible
[39:53] the lamb's book of life a character
[39:56] identified within the word we're living
[39:58] in this hour we're not living in the
[40:00] hour of bible stories we're living in
[40:02] the hour where those stories we see that
[40:05] was a type of me
[40:08] rebecca spoke of me
[40:10] ruth spoke of me
[40:12] are you hearing me now you see the same
[40:15] one who stepped out on the road to the
[40:18] of emmaus is the same holy spirit that
[40:20] has come down and not only to identify
[40:23] himself in the word in this hour but to
[40:25] come and identify us within the word and
[40:29] he inside of us
[40:32] it's a time of preparation
[40:36] it's a time of preparation
[40:39] you see
[40:40] let me refer here to a scripture
[40:43] in first peter
[40:45] chapter four verse seven
[40:47] it says but the end of all things is at
[40:49] hand
[40:50] be there for sober
[40:53] and watch unto prayer
[40:55] over and over you find the parallel
[40:58] watch and pray
[41:00] be sober
[41:02] you'll find that throughout the
[41:03] scripture even jesus
[41:05] admonishing that the way that we watch
[41:08] is through prayer
[41:09] all right
[41:11] and prayer is the result of being in
[41:13] tune with the will of god
[41:16] that's why brother braham says if you
[41:18] want to know where the church is headed
[41:19] listen to how they're praying
[41:22] he said that's the sign of what the
[41:24] church
[41:25] is headed for
[41:27] because of what they're praying so when
[41:28] god begins to drop and move upon her
[41:31] heart for promises in this hour and you
[41:34] would say well i don't see that promise
[41:35] before me and it can be a very personal
[41:38] promise in your life but god begins to
[41:40] drop it upon your heart like he dealt
[41:42] with daniel right here and you begin to
[41:44] pray concerning that that shows the
[41:48] direction the church is headed in
[41:53] because we don't fly by sight
[41:57] jets don't fly by sight up there
[42:00] they fly by radar
[42:02] and radar detects oncoming things
[42:05] and moves accordingly to oncoming things
[42:09] so the end of all things is at hand
[42:12] we understand that in the hour the time
[42:14] that we're living in
[42:16] that in the opening of the seventh seal
[42:20] that's the coming of the lord
[42:22] and the coming of the lord brother
[42:24] branham brings it down to us and souls
[42:26] in prison now
[42:27] that brings him back down to earth what
[42:29] earth
[42:31] this earth
[42:33] this earth right here the coming of the
[42:36] lord a secret coming a bride coming it
[42:39] brings him down to earth
[42:41] brings him to his habitation brings him
[42:44] to his temple because in this hour
[42:47] it was promised the mystery of god
[42:49] should be finished
[42:51] is that right yes
[42:53] so within that coming
[42:55] there is also all of the folds
[42:58] of not only the preparation of the bride
[43:00] being made ready
[43:02] christ veiling himself in bright form
[43:05] but also within that coming
[43:08] is the going
[43:10] is the rapture of the church
[43:12] inside of that coming
[43:14] is also the tribulation coming upon the
[43:18] earth the sixth seal being opened
[43:20] inside of that coming this is why when
[43:23] the scripture says he cometh with clouds
[43:25] of glory and brother brown says that
[43:27] what that is it's waves his coming upon
[43:30] the earth it's just waves of his coming
[43:33] that's coming upon the earth
[43:36] waves and that waves these are not the
[43:38] waves these are waves of the holy spirit
[43:41] moving upon the church of the living god
[43:44] inspiring you and i in this hour and
[43:47] inside of that you see with that seal
[43:49] being opened in this hour the coming of
[43:52] the lord what does it do all of that
[43:54] within there making a bride ready and
[43:57] within that it unfolds to that here
[43:59] calling to the wedding supper of the
[44:00] lamb the tribulation all of the parts
[44:03] that are within that the millennium you
[44:05] know hear all the parts that before
[44:07] millennium armageddon all these parts
[44:09] are within that and that's why the
[44:11] scripture could say in the book of
[44:13] matthew it is the beginning of sorrows
[44:20] because
[44:21] this is an end
[44:22] this is what all of the prophets and
[44:25] those have looked for as a matter of
[44:27] fact it it is where the gentiles are to
[44:30] be taken off the scene in order that
[44:34] israel
[44:35] might receive her promised visitation
[44:41] and they're only waiting on us to get
[44:43] off the scene
[44:45] everything has been working in
[44:46] preparation for this moment i can say
[44:49] this this whole unfolding in our lives
[44:51] and our myth has been a vision of god
[44:54] hallelujah you know sometimes when we
[44:57] look at things and i i mean just say
[44:58] this is
[44:59] this is it comes to me
[45:03] we look at we look at the statement
[45:07] brother branham speaks in 1977
[45:12] and he speaks under that of inspiration
[45:14] and it was under inspiration
[45:17] it was prophesied
[45:19] and it's to look at it clearly a
[45:20] terminating of world systems and what he
[45:23] was speaking to in that time
[45:25] i think of how many times we've heard
[45:27] this
[45:29] we see it even as brother george smith
[45:31] he's just one one of the many but i've
[45:33] heard it throughout my life what it came
[45:35] down to when brother branham was
[45:37] standing there he says the reason i said
[45:40] 1977 is because when he saw 1977 he
[45:45] could not see beyond it it was pitch
[45:48] black
[45:51] think about where we're at right now
[45:53] darkness is upon the earth gross
[45:55] darkness is upon the people
[45:58] amen
[45:59] are you with me we're not tampering with
[46:01] what a prophet said this is of what god
[46:04] has spoken through his prophet
[46:07] amen we're living in an hour right now
[46:10] that we see the fulfillment of the
[46:13] visions taking place and i know i'm just
[46:15] kind of moving and just jumping along
[46:17] and moving just to just to look at some
[46:20] points but to understand here we stand
[46:22] in this hour the visions brother branham
[46:24] had seven visions that god gave him is
[46:27] that right amen let me tell you
[46:29] something we're living the sixth is in
[46:32] fulfillment
[46:35] i know you know sometimes people get so
[46:37] caught up with this and that and what
[46:38] and more and they fail to recognize and
[46:40] go back and really uncover certain
[46:42] things
[46:45] oh brother samuel you know women aren't
[46:46] naked yet really
[46:48] really
[46:49] where you been if you're talking about
[46:52] exposure of skin you've missed it
[46:54] there's nothing more
[46:56] uh of nudity than yoga pants
[47:01] i'm gonna preach it amen
[47:03] all right that's true
[47:05] brother would say it like this the
[47:07] understanding of the prophetic eye he
[47:09] said satan knows just how much to take
[47:11] off and how much to leave on to cause
[47:14] the mind to wonder
[47:15] he said he knows he can't completely
[47:17] strip it all right
[47:19] is that right
[47:20] but you're seeing this out think about
[47:22] when they would say to brother branham
[47:23] oh brother you know i don't wear shorts
[47:25] i wear slack brother brandon said that's
[47:27] worse yet because it's an abomination
[47:30] it shows the very the very figure you
[47:32] see oh my i don't want to go this route
[47:35] but you see god has even hold that of
[47:37] the woman because the woman is a type of
[47:40] the church
[47:41] and if the woman is there in an
[47:43] abomination she's under the wrath and
[47:45] the judgment of god but god intended
[47:48] that the woman would be veiled in the
[47:51] clothing of the word she would be under
[47:54] the blood of jesus christ and to find
[47:56] her and see her you have to look and see
[47:59] christ first because christ is her all
[48:02] in all christ is her adornment he
[48:13] is that right
[48:15] you see i i don't you know to me i hate
[48:18] debating i don't like debating because
[48:20] debating ain't nothing about there ain't
[48:21] nothing about the word that's debating
[48:24] is that right either believe it or not
[48:27] i don't care how you can debate it
[48:28] you'll never turn nobody
[48:29] people are not turned by debates
[48:32] amen is that right
[48:34] this is why over and over if they're
[48:36] ordained to see it they'll see it if
[48:38] they're not ordained to see it i don't
[48:39] care if they know it by memory they'll
[48:41] never see it yes amen
[48:47] brother braham said here here we are
[48:50] even when he speaks in daniel 70 weeks
[48:53] and he rehearses that
[48:55] sixth vision my goodness we see the
[48:57] things already it's been out with the
[48:58] cars
[49:00] for years not just recently
[49:02] just speaking with a
[49:04] pastor that had
[49:06] called me and he said you know he says
[49:08] speaking of some things he said man i
[49:09] got copies of stuff and all this was
[49:11] coming out back there with these cars
[49:13] and all this back there you know way
[49:15] back i mean when it was all put out
[49:16] national geographic and all this stuff
[49:18] it's been out all right
[49:20] are you hearing me
[49:22] say brother samuel what are you saying
[49:23] i'm saying you need to be tuned in to
[49:25] the right voice yes that's what i'm
[49:28] saying beloved try every spirit amen
[49:31] amen come on somebody amen
[49:34] you see when brother branham would say
[49:36] that in the sixth vision we understand
[49:38] it's speaking not only the catholic
[49:40] church but then we've seen kamala harris
[49:42] standing right there dressed right there
[49:44] in purple
[49:46] is that right the detractors around
[49:48] wanted to say blue oh how god had put
[49:51] the designer raffle in put it on there
[49:53] and ralph lauren identifies it's purple
[49:59] seeing the woman wearing the purple
[50:01] dress it's twofold
[50:04] now that's not the bad that
[50:06] i mean you either believe it or you
[50:07] don't
[50:08] but you see where that's at in this hour
[50:10] those six visions fulfilled the seventh
[50:13] vision is the united states laying in
[50:17] craters and ashes
[50:19] but before that one comes to pass
[50:22] the pride will be gone and taken out of
[50:25] here amen she has given rapturing grace
[50:30] amen this is a rapturing message that
[50:32] raptures you and your soul right now
[50:35] raptures you from the things of this
[50:37] earth from an old sinful nature from
[50:40] sinful habits it's a rapturing message
[50:43] brother that catches you up into
[50:45] heavenly places and ties you back in to
[50:49] your inheritance
[50:52] what an awesome hour we're living in
[51:02] [Music]
[51:05] now
[51:06] brother brian referred to this when he
[51:07] was
[51:08] praying and i'm going to read it
[51:11] because right now
[51:13] what we see going on
[51:15] even within russia and i could say this
[51:17] right now there's a lot of different
[51:18] events here or there that we could see
[51:20] and some things some things as it's laid
[51:23] out
[51:25] we didn't even with the things that was
[51:27] taken place within this past
[51:29] two years
[51:30] right
[51:32] right
[51:35] now i realized when we stood here on
[51:36] that opening night and i i told you when
[51:38] we had that perming i said this isn't a
[51:40] it isn't a persecution
[51:43] we're just gonna we're trying to go
[51:44] along and just to
[51:46] go along with things
[51:48] just to be
[51:50] good neighbors i felt led of the lord to
[51:52] do that
[51:53] but you see
[51:55] where you and i
[51:56] had privileges
[51:58] that we could come back together
[52:01] right
[52:03] there were other states even within our
[52:05] united states
[52:09] where there was the governors and
[52:10] everything else
[52:12] that said don't go to church
[52:14] and if you do don't
[52:16] sing because if you sing you might get
[52:19] saliva drops on everybody else
[52:21] now i'm going to tell you something
[52:23] there was men who stood in those states
[52:26] they don't even know the light of this
[52:28] hour
[52:30] are you hearing me they weren't being
[52:32] obstinate
[52:33] daniel wasn't being obstinate when he
[52:35] stood in an unaltered way but they began
[52:37] to recognize wait a minute here this is
[52:40] an attack now
[52:44] amen
[52:45] i tell you friend this is an hour to
[52:47] have discernment in these things amen
[52:50] amen so suddenly the bible said it will
[52:52] come upon the earth as a snare yes true
[52:57] it's a time to have exercise in
[52:59] discernment in this hour
[53:02] as we even see things that goes on in my
[53:05] i mean you look at the hour that here
[53:07] we're living in i mean just a couple
[53:08] years ago you could think in your mind
[53:11] my goodness the way the economy and the
[53:13] stuff is going it's totally opposite
[53:16] right right
[53:18] it was totally opposite right but look
[53:21] how just in one
[53:22] little bit
[53:25] the crippling of economies came
[53:30] you're saying who who watched over that
[53:32] god watched over that right
[53:35] none of this could have happened or been
[53:37] released if god didn't permit it
[53:42] god permitted it god's not the cause of
[53:45] it he permits it daniel and daniel 9
[53:48] said lord thou hast watched over these
[53:50] things
[53:52] yes but in the midst of it
[53:54] as it's getting god moving down i think
[53:57] of it look in this hour i tell you in
[53:59] this and even in these past two years i
[54:01] tell you what god has become more
[54:03] precious more real until you see more of
[54:06] the supernatural the pillar of fire
[54:08] coming down seeing more of those things
[54:10] in the very first service that we were
[54:11] here you've seen it i got called
[54:13] afterwards the very first streaming
[54:15] service that we had here and it asked me
[54:17] did you see that in the building
[54:20] glory it's very real
[54:22] the living god moving among us and in
[54:24] testimonies of his presence god reaching
[54:28] lives and lives not only walking into
[54:30] the waters of baptism but really
[54:32] consecrating their lives unto almighty
[54:35] god i'm telling you thanks be to god in
[54:38] this hour for his marvelous grace
[54:44] hey man it's time to leave
[54:46] see with russia and everything that we
[54:48] see
[54:49] taking place let me just let me read the
[54:51] quote
[54:53] brother branham i have the message the
[54:54] angel of the lord 1951
[54:58] 1951
[55:00] you do the math on that at 71 years ago
[55:05] he said you remember church
[55:07] you're living in the best that you ever
[55:09] live in right now
[55:10] until jesus comes right
[55:13] you know it'll gradually no no he said
[55:14] not gradually it'll rapidly get worse
[55:17] and worse yes
[55:18] when russia goes down there to get that
[55:20] oil look out
[55:22] that's what this whole thing is about in
[55:24] ukraine
[55:26] it's oil
[55:32] you also realize even years ago remember
[55:34] when israel or now israel russia
[55:36] positioned themselves on the black sea
[55:38] in crimea
[55:39] they can't be cut off
[55:42] just as much as rome had her revival
[55:46] brother branham announces it an end time
[55:48] seed sign rome having her revival to
[55:51] reclaim her original borders
[55:56] see if there's battles there's there's
[55:58] that the tensions that's taking place
[56:00] and that's going on in this hour these
[56:02] are all signs of things that we see
[56:05] around us but in the midst of all these
[56:07] times there's the greatest sign that is
[56:10] among us
[56:11] and the greatest sign that's among us is
[56:13] the lord jesus christ and him uniting in
[56:16] the hearts and lives of his people in a
[56:19] way of readiness
[56:22] [Music]
[56:26] when russia goes down there to get that
[56:27] oil look out
[56:28] that's all she needs
[56:30] that's what the prophet said it would do
[56:32] and we're ready for it then let me just
[56:34] come back and come back to me because i
[56:35] i've come to this point and i've got
[56:37] moved this way and i'm on this trail
[56:40] it's just like
[56:42] let me tell you something
[56:43] just like when things like this have
[56:45] come along
[56:46] if it's only something that kind of just
[56:48] prompts for a little bit
[56:49] it'll fade that's right
[56:52] it's just like when 9 11 happened it
[56:53] prompted for a little bit faded
[56:56] you know why because it's not national
[56:58] forces
[57:00] that bring us into the promise
[57:02] but you can look at events taking place
[57:04] and realize i'm not where i should be
[57:07] or i need to really get dialed in a
[57:10] little bit more
[57:11] and with that oh my to recognize what
[57:14] joy that is present in this house we
[57:17] already have joy but what joy that is
[57:19] present because in the next moment
[57:22] hallelujah
[57:24] we can see our loved ones
[57:27] hallelujah i thought oh god i see
[57:28] brother and sister car probably i just
[57:30] walking around here today i said oh god
[57:32] i'm going to see brother louie
[57:34] hallelujah
[57:35] what are you doing i'm saying i'm
[57:36] looking
[57:38] amen
[57:39] i'm looking
[57:41] you see
[57:44] even after things could take place you
[57:46] can have things where
[57:47] you know people say oh
[57:49] you're trying to put a prediction it's
[57:51] not a prediction we're living in the
[57:53] time of departure
[57:54] amen it's time to leave
[57:57] for the rapture itself is promised it
[58:00] will come as a thief in the night right
[58:04] it's not an announcement when a thief
[58:06] comes to your house except you're in
[58:07] nigeria
[58:08] if a thief comes to your house he
[58:10] doesn't announce itself right you know
[58:12] what i'm talking about right
[58:15] they don't announce themselves they show
[58:16] up
[58:17] that's right
[58:18] unannounced
[58:20] there's no preparation but if you know
[58:22] hey there's something coming and there's
[58:25] a prep there's something coming you make
[58:27] preparation and you're waiting you're
[58:29] vigilant you're watching you're looking
[58:32] for it and that's how when we're looking
[58:34] for the coming of the lord there's all
[58:36] sorts of things to try to take our focus
[58:38] this way focus this way focus that way
[58:41] but this is where like daniel we must
[58:44] set our face yes amen to seek the lord
[58:49] our person our lives just like a man
[58:52] that would walk into the congregation
[58:54] into the tabernacle in the wilderness
[58:56] into the three courts when he came
[58:58] through the gate he was facing the right
[59:00] way to go on into the holiest of holies
[59:04] see the door jesus christ is the door
[59:07] it's him that reveals the right
[59:09] direction the path of life amen
[59:12] that we're facing in the right way
[59:15] well he says there he says that that the
[59:16] prophet said it would do it and we're
[59:18] ready for it then
[59:19] now notice he's just announced russia
[59:21] going down there to get that oil and
[59:23] look what it comes and says so church
[59:26] get ready to meet christ yes
[59:29] he's sending great revivals and meetings
[59:33] to me this quote
[59:36] it speaks more of this hour
[59:39] let me tell you something in these past
[59:41] two years
[59:42] there has been more meetings
[59:47] i know not every time you're learning
[59:49] really yeah there's been more meetings
[59:51] more meetings this past year meetings
[59:54] that weren't just small meetings
[59:57] i look at here went on memorial day
[59:58] meetings
[1:00:01] those that came it's not about numbers
[1:00:04] but hearts that came and that was a
[1:00:06] small representation to just weeks
[1:00:08] before in virginia was like 800
[1:00:11] a thousand
[1:00:12] somewhere around in there came and we're
[1:00:14] talking all the way through why is it
[1:00:17] there's a gathering going on amen
[1:00:21] it's a gathering that's taking place of
[1:00:24] god's people i'm not saying that you had
[1:00:26] to travel those other meetings i'm just
[1:00:27] trying to tell you that there's hearts
[1:00:29] in life that if anything that covet did
[1:00:32] covet if there's anything it caused
[1:00:34] people to say you know what i've taken
[1:00:37] church for granted i'm taking serving
[1:00:39] god for granted i need to get my
[1:00:42] priorities right and my life lined up
[1:00:44] with god
[1:00:46] because they realize walking a halfway
[1:00:48] life when things come like that it'll
[1:00:51] rivet fear through that life
[1:00:54] is that right
[1:01:00] incredible
[1:01:05] i've often pondered and wondered because
[1:01:08] you know i shared this with some of your
[1:01:09] brothers everyone they always talk about
[1:01:11] covet and natural comorbidities i wonder
[1:01:13] what effect when things come about upon
[1:01:16] spiritual comorbidities
[1:01:19] are you hearing me church
[1:01:21] tests trial persecution things come
[1:01:24] around you see if there's any weakness
[1:01:26] it'll show itself
[1:01:28] are you hearing me now
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:33] oh it sounds like brother samuel that
[1:01:34] sounds pretty strong friends were
[1:01:36] interested in getting out of here
[1:01:38] we're interested in getting out of here
[1:01:40] we're interested in walking the right
[1:01:42] pathway
[1:01:45] sometimes these things might seem awful
[1:01:47] strong
[1:01:48] but on that day when we stand there on
[1:01:50] that moment we will be faithful for
[1:01:53] every word of admonition we'll be
[1:01:55] thankful for the holy spirit coming down
[1:01:57] and saying get back instead get back in
[1:02:00] line we will be faithful in that hour
[1:02:02] and say thank you lord for my less
[1:02:04] wanted to resist it and argue against it
[1:02:07] and put a position against it but my
[1:02:09] soul said amen
[1:02:11] amen
[1:02:12] praise the lord
[1:02:14] so church
[1:02:15] getting ready to meet christ
[1:02:17] he's sending great revivals and meetings
[1:02:20] and stirring the full gospel people not
[1:02:22] only do the message of the hour do it
[1:02:24] then the message of the hour is doing it
[1:02:26] right now
[1:02:28] signs and wonders appearing everywhere
[1:02:30] great wonders to draw his people
[1:02:32] together and one day he shall come
[1:02:35] the deliverer
[1:02:36] brother brown of the very next statement
[1:02:38] he says
[1:02:39] just before god began to take the people
[1:02:41] out of the promised land to the promised
[1:02:43] land
[1:02:44] they started to cry out
[1:02:46] bitterly
[1:02:49] in anguish yes
[1:02:50] they're taskmasters
[1:02:53] god had to bring it to a place
[1:02:56] to their prayers
[1:02:58] changed
[1:02:59] amen are you hearing me
[1:03:01] daniel's prayers
[1:03:03] changed
[1:03:04] daniel's prayers became
[1:03:06] focused
[1:03:08] upon
[1:03:09] that understanding that god was revealed
[1:03:11] now don't misunderstand me it wasn't
[1:03:13] that daniel couldn't pray for healing
[1:03:15] but daniel realized this is the
[1:03:17] preeminent thought of the hour amen
[1:03:20] deliverance are you hearing me amen see
[1:03:22] many out there even in religious they're
[1:03:24] praying and they're praying for this and
[1:03:26] praying for that and you know what
[1:03:28] prayers get answered
[1:03:29] but to be in tune with the mind of
[1:03:32] christ for the will of god in this hour
[1:03:35] and then to pray for that that requires
[1:03:38] a special designation
[1:03:41] that's sovereign grace that's given to
[1:03:43] you and i that we might know the things
[1:03:45] that we should be praying about amen
[1:03:51] they begin to cry taskmasters was heavy
[1:03:54] everything
[1:03:55] i want you to think of this here
[1:03:57] just just a few just a few a few more
[1:04:00] moments
[1:04:02] here in the scriptures
[1:04:05] this preparation for departure in exodus
[1:04:07] chapter 12
[1:04:09] remember
[1:04:11] in order for israel
[1:04:14] to walk out of egypt
[1:04:17] god sent him a prophet
[1:04:20] is that right
[1:04:22] now they recognized
[1:04:24] that moses was a prophet
[1:04:27] but that message also came accompanied
[1:04:30] with the pillar of fire
[1:04:31] that was grace
[1:04:33] the pillar of fire was to vindicate this
[1:04:35] is my servant
[1:04:37] amen is that right yes
[1:04:39] and under that under that message
[1:04:42] it was expressed in that hour
[1:04:44] i'm coming
[1:04:46] to bring deliverance
[1:04:48] and i'm coming
[1:04:49] to set my son free that he might serve
[1:04:51] me
[1:04:54] now israel was his son collectively as a
[1:04:56] whole
[1:04:57] let me just say this to you
[1:04:59] your god son
[1:05:01] you're god's daughter
[1:05:03] and you and i had to be led out of
[1:05:05] egyptian
[1:05:06] bondage had to be let out of our first
[1:05:09] birth
[1:05:11] we could not think our way out of it
[1:05:13] we couldn't memorize our way out of it
[1:05:15] couldn't talk our way out of it
[1:05:17] there had to be a lamb that was provided
[1:05:22] and the lamb the way out the way a
[1:05:24] pathway of deliverance which was god's
[1:05:27] pathway and program prayer from the mind
[1:05:29] of god and has been a type all the way
[1:05:31] through was identified through the
[1:05:34] message of the hour go take a lamb
[1:05:37] slay that lamb
[1:05:38] and take the blood
[1:05:40] and put it upon the doorpost
[1:05:43] and that shall be a token between
[1:05:46] me and you
[1:05:47] that when i see the blood you mean you
[1:05:50] won't see me no i'm looking for the
[1:05:52] blood
[1:05:54] that's what i'm looking for
[1:05:56] so the blood had to be applied before
[1:05:59] they could ever leave egypt
[1:06:03] and when we applied the blood they
[1:06:05] didn't have a time that you know what
[1:06:07] you're going to be exiled out of here at
[1:06:09] midnight
[1:06:10] you're going to be thrown out of here in
[1:06:12] the wee hours of the morning they didn't
[1:06:14] have that but they knew that this was
[1:06:16] the final moment this was the final
[1:06:19] message this was the final time
[1:06:23] notice how god had them to do it see
[1:06:26] also
[1:06:27] they were to eat that lamb
[1:06:29] and while they ate it
[1:06:32] they had to have their shoes on their
[1:06:34] feet
[1:06:35] they had to have their loins gird about
[1:06:37] meaning
[1:06:38] the long palestinian robes
[1:06:41] it had to be brought up
[1:06:43] and tucked in
[1:06:44] that belt
[1:06:45] why
[1:06:46] so their movement was not impeded or
[1:06:49] slowed down or hindered
[1:06:51] it was tucked up right
[1:06:54] they had to eat it in that way
[1:06:56] not like how you and i eat at our house
[1:06:58] you know with our slippers on and
[1:07:00] sometimes with you know a sweatshirt on
[1:07:02] or something we
[1:07:04] don't know what we look like
[1:07:08] no
[1:07:09] they were to eat it ready to go
[1:07:12] and while they were eating it they were
[1:07:14] eating it waiting for marching orders
[1:07:19] waiting for that let me say something
[1:07:22] god has been sending marching orders yes
[1:07:25] over and over
[1:07:29] are you hearing me
[1:07:30] the same holy spirit that comes that
[1:07:32] speaks to your heart even tonight it's
[1:07:34] sending marching orders to your life hey
[1:07:36] it's time to move on
[1:07:38] that's right
[1:07:39] you've been around church it's time to
[1:07:41] move it's time to move on it's time to
[1:07:44] move on deeper it's time to move into a
[1:07:46] deeper walk it's time to get beneath the
[1:07:49] blood
[1:07:51] it's time to get serious it's time not
[1:07:53] to be casual it's time to leave
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] this is how you're to eat it
[1:08:03] many other places in the scripture that
[1:08:04] we could go to with this part of
[1:08:07] desperation let me just say it in this
[1:08:09] way
[1:08:10] it's the desperation is to be in such a
[1:08:13] place like it was with peter
[1:08:16] when peter was bitten to come out of the
[1:08:18] ship and begin to walk on the water he
[1:08:20] got his eyes on the waves and he started
[1:08:22] sinking
[1:08:24] but in desperation he screamed out
[1:08:27] save me lord lest i perish
[1:08:31] this was not something that was casual
[1:08:35] it was in desperation
[1:08:38] it's like the woman with had the issue
[1:08:40] of blood
[1:08:42] she spent all her living what caused her
[1:08:44] to spend all her living desperation
[1:08:48] she was desperate to see that resolved
[1:08:51] in her life
[1:08:54] but she made it
[1:08:56] to the lord jesus
[1:08:58] and you talk about desperation she
[1:09:00] pressed through
[1:09:01] even when the disciples tried to
[1:09:03] discourage her
[1:09:07] not you
[1:09:10] even jesus himself brother brown was
[1:09:12] standing there in a message perseverance
[1:09:14] he said jesus himself
[1:09:16] tried to discourage her
[1:09:21] but he said what it is she says her
[1:09:24] faith could not know any discouragement
[1:09:27] all right
[1:09:29] because she knew that's what i have need
[1:09:31] of he's the one i have need of let me
[1:09:33] tell you something the devil will try to
[1:09:34] put every sort of discouragement and if
[1:09:37] you listen to me now if you look at the
[1:09:39] word through natural eyes you'll never
[1:09:41] see yourself in the word but if you're
[1:09:43] like the holy spirit the outside of god
[1:09:46] to come and anoint your eyes brother it
[1:09:49] will give you courage and strength to
[1:09:51] press beyond every discouragement every
[1:09:54] shortcoming everything that even
[1:09:56] thoughts come in about yourself there is
[1:09:59] a power to anoint you to see beyond the
[1:10:02] veil amen
[1:10:05] praise the lord
[1:10:08] like the woman
[1:10:10] whose daughter was grievously vet sheath
[1:10:12] in desperation got to
[1:10:14] him jairus
[1:10:17] his daughter
[1:10:19] she was only laying sick at the time
[1:10:22] right
[1:10:22] but you see the situation
[1:10:25] forced him
[1:10:27] he was a secret believer
[1:10:30] but the situation forced him
[1:10:33] to step out
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:36] step out
[1:10:41] i say it like this
[1:10:43] as paul would write we need to give the
[1:10:45] more earnest heed
[1:10:47] to the things that we've heard
[1:10:52] i say it's a time
[1:10:54] it's a moment it's an hour
[1:10:57] there's more we could say
[1:10:59] but it's a time it's an hour to really
[1:11:02] be dialed in
[1:11:04] on the things of god
[1:11:07] i know we can all you know
[1:11:10] we can all agree with that
[1:11:13] but it really has to come down of
[1:11:17] really putting our lives before that
[1:11:19] really seeing what's going on
[1:11:22] these things out here
[1:11:24] as we see it taking place
[1:11:26] it's already spoken was already
[1:11:28] prophesied
[1:11:29] but the focus that we have is the
[1:11:31] preparation that god
[1:11:33] has sent to you and i
[1:11:35] to be made ready in this hour let me
[1:11:37] just say it as clear as i know you're
[1:11:39] not going in a rapture because you know
[1:11:41] god sent a prophet
[1:11:42] you're not going in a rapture because
[1:11:44] you believe this message
[1:11:45] you're going in a rapture because there
[1:11:47] is an atonement a token life the baptism
[1:11:50] of the holy ghost upon your soul
[1:11:54] you're not going in a rapture because
[1:11:56] you're affiliated around the message or
[1:11:58] you have books or you have tapes we're
[1:11:59] not going in a message for that you're
[1:12:01] not going in a message because well i
[1:12:03] see visions and i see this and i see
[1:12:05] that no we're going in the rapture
[1:12:07] because
[1:12:08] there is the token of the holy ghost
[1:12:11] upon our life when i see the blood not
[1:12:13] when i see a healing not when i see a
[1:12:16] vision now when i we believe in all
[1:12:18] those things but we don't put our stock
[1:12:21] in those things as evidence of life
[1:12:24] [Applause]
[1:12:26] when i see
[1:12:28] the blood that's why rahab said judgment
[1:12:31] is upon us
[1:12:32] i don't just want a token i want a true
[1:12:35] one
[1:12:37] i want a true assurance i want a true
[1:12:40] token because judgment
[1:12:42] is striking the land
[1:12:46] the time to get serious
[1:12:48] a time to clean out all the trash yes
[1:12:55] oh my
[1:12:57] desperation you see
[1:13:00] desperation
[1:13:02] what real desperation is
[1:13:05] recognizing
[1:13:07] our need in this hour
[1:13:11] and the love of god
[1:13:12] when the love of god the baptism of the
[1:13:15] holy ghost
[1:13:16] has come into that life
[1:13:18] you live a desperate life
[1:13:22] are you hearing me
[1:13:24] we don't we aren't desperate for the
[1:13:26] holy ghost and then we become oh praise
[1:13:28] god
[1:13:29] phew
[1:13:30] i made it they bring me some tea while
[1:13:32] i'm waiting on it no no no
[1:13:35] no no no no
[1:13:37] how many of you ever been probably
[1:13:38] people been on trains
[1:13:41] buses
[1:13:42] and airplanes
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:47] now for me a lot of times with you know
[1:13:48] i just fly one carrier that way i get my
[1:13:51] stuff gets built up and things like that
[1:13:54] so a lot of times when i fly with a
[1:13:55] certain carrier i always have to either
[1:13:57] go to atlanta or detroit
[1:14:00] don't matter i could be going to
[1:14:01] connecticut and they'd fly me to atlanta
[1:14:03] and then up to detroit over to
[1:14:06] but
[1:14:07] i've learned
[1:14:08] within that time
[1:14:10] that's a coffee break time
[1:14:14] the time that i'll start looking where's
[1:14:16] the nearest
[1:14:17] coffee place
[1:14:19] when i like where's it at
[1:14:21] what terminal is it in
[1:14:23] now you know there's sometimes
[1:14:25] when you book your flights they give you
[1:14:26] just a small window of 50 minutes
[1:14:28] between flights
[1:14:31] sometimes it might be a three hour
[1:14:32] window
[1:14:33] that kind of gives you a little bit of
[1:14:36] three hours man that's i got time to
[1:14:38] traverse and get around other places
[1:14:40] but remember you've got a connecting
[1:14:43] flight to catch
[1:14:47] and sometimes
[1:14:48] you know you can see people running
[1:14:49] around the airport and sometimes it
[1:14:50] isn't because they just got off a flight
[1:14:52] is because they were at too long at a
[1:14:53] restaurant too long at this and they're
[1:14:55] trying now to get to their gate
[1:14:57] this is why brother branham stands
[1:14:59] in flashing red lights of his coming and
[1:15:01] he speaks in terms of a train
[1:15:03] he said here a train has come in
[1:15:05] you get off he said just for like one of
[1:15:07] those little whistle stops
[1:15:09] you get off and you grab a bag of
[1:15:11] peanuts
[1:15:12] oh man i'm gonna get some peanuts
[1:15:15] he said
[1:15:16] and yet here you are engulfed with those
[1:15:19] peanuts and you miss the train that's to
[1:15:22] take you to your destination
[1:15:24] and this is why he said if you were
[1:15:26] living in the time
[1:15:28] throw down the bag of peanuts
[1:15:33] throw it down
[1:15:35] it's a time to be dialed in and to be
[1:15:38] focused
[1:15:40] yes
[1:15:41] is that right
[1:15:46] i wish i had more time to to go and to
[1:15:48] speak more on that part of it
[1:15:50] because let me just let me just let me
[1:15:52] just wrap it up in this in this place
[1:15:54] here
[1:15:56] is that
[1:16:00] when we're looking at
[1:16:03] the times that we're in
[1:16:05] it's a time
[1:16:06] that brother banham said it like this
[1:16:09] and i've said this too
[1:16:11] when i've talked over the
[1:16:13] years here
[1:16:15] with our boys
[1:16:16] and
[1:16:17] spoke to others but with the boys
[1:16:19] because i know they also there's things
[1:16:21] that they're in their college and things
[1:16:22] they're going through
[1:16:24] and i said it in this way i said look
[1:16:27] there's things that we see coming on
[1:16:28] around us and even talking today of it
[1:16:32] but i said
[1:16:34] it's not for us to stand by
[1:16:37] and do nothing
[1:16:39] first of all it's to be occupied
[1:16:41] with the things of god
[1:16:44] very last scripture in first corinthians
[1:16:46] 15 said of this of the chapter that
[1:16:48] speaks of the change of the body it says
[1:16:51] abound in the work of the lord
[1:16:54] to me what balance that this message has
[1:16:57] brought to us in this hour
[1:16:59] brother brown could make the statement
[1:17:01] very clear
[1:17:02] you know the quote about planting
[1:17:03] potatoes now he didn't say become
[1:17:06] the local potato expert
[1:17:08] become dr potato head or dr potato don't
[1:17:11] don't become that just plant them
[1:17:14] right right if you're not there to eat
[1:17:16] them somebody else will
[1:17:19] but this is what he said
[1:17:21] he said if i knew he was coming tomorrow
[1:17:23] morning i'd study to preach the message
[1:17:26] tomorrow
[1:17:28] and he said i'd be standing right here
[1:17:30] at the pulpit he said because when he
[1:17:32] comes this is his words
[1:17:34] i want to be found standing at the post
[1:17:36] of duty
[1:17:38] so i can be saying lord i stood faithful
[1:17:41] where you have placed me what you call
[1:17:44] me to do i'm standing faithful waiting
[1:17:47] on your coming
[1:17:49] so when it comes to everything else
[1:17:52] schooling training other things taking
[1:17:55] place even in our lives remember
[1:17:58] we don't become focused or let that
[1:18:00] become the priority but within all of
[1:18:03] that we stand in our post of duty and we
[1:18:06] must plant potatoes yes
[1:18:09] is that
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:12] well i thank god
[1:18:14] for the hour that we're living in but i
[1:18:15] say this friends i say this even to all
[1:18:18] those are on the internet those that are
[1:18:19] not here tonight those that
[1:18:21] it's a it's a time if you notice how the
[1:18:23] transition how the holy spirit has been
[1:18:25] taking it i've watched it
[1:18:27] i've watched those things
[1:18:29] and it's a time i can say it
[1:18:32] very clearly outside of the token
[1:18:35] you're under the wrath of god
[1:18:38] outside of the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:40] wrath
[1:18:42] wrath
[1:18:43] is what awaits you
[1:18:46] branham makes a statement when he says
[1:18:47] they'll stand there on that day
[1:18:49] in the time after the rapture
[1:18:51] and those that are here and he says they
[1:18:54] will cry for the rocks of the mountains
[1:18:56] to fall on them to hide them from the
[1:18:57] wrath of the lamb and brother branham
[1:18:59] brings and identifies that group that
[1:19:01] calls for that he said that's those that
[1:19:04] said in these services
[1:19:06] and failed to move upon the word of god
[1:19:17] i'm thankful for god's mercy
[1:19:19] amen i'm thankful now when he not only
[1:19:21] opened my eyes but dealt with my heart
[1:19:23] brought correction to my life
[1:19:26] and i'm thankful for his grace to where
[1:19:28] grace was given that my heart could be
[1:19:31] yielded to him and he could come and do
[1:19:33] the work that he himself intended and
[1:19:36] desired to do in my life
[1:19:37] that would bring a peace that would
[1:19:39] bring a joy let me say this to you
[1:19:41] that's god's desire to all that's here
[1:19:43] to all that'll stream this message to
[1:19:45] all that's out on the internet don't
[1:19:47] take anything
[1:19:48] no substitution amen for the real life
[1:19:52] of jesus christ amen
[1:19:55] i've been around her for 40 years don't
[1:19:56] take no substitution amen
[1:19:59] know that you know that you know that
[1:20:02] you know
[1:20:04] amen don't rest on anything rest only in
[1:20:08] him amen
[1:20:10] amen when you can look in your life and
[1:20:12] say i know i'm not who i used to be i
[1:20:14] know the desires of my life they're no
[1:20:17] longer there he changed my life he's
[1:20:20] opened his word to me i see him in plain
[1:20:23] view he's the love of my life
[1:20:28] he's my everything amen
[1:20:32] hallelujah and desperation will lay
[1:20:35] everything aside for him
[1:20:37] in desperation when decisions come if it
[1:20:40] is going to alter the order of god in my
[1:20:43] life no thank you the rapture is more
[1:20:46] important
[1:20:51] let's bow our heads
[1:20:55] heavenly father
[1:20:58] o god tonight lord
[1:21:01] lord jesus you know i've stood here lord
[1:21:04] to watch
[1:21:05] even that lord a timer said even in
[1:21:07] front of me
[1:21:09] and just lord of my heart just lord
[1:21:12] looking upon these things and just with
[1:21:17] just so many things lord just as it's
[1:21:19] inspired to my heart it's time to leave
[1:21:25] it's a time to lay aside everything
[1:21:29] it's a time to lay aside complexes it's
[1:21:31] a time to lay aside sin
[1:21:34] it's a time to lay down
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:38] it's a time to lay aside every weight
[1:21:40] waste that you're carrying that's
[1:21:42] holding you down
[1:21:43] unforgiveness lay it aside
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:48] bitterness lay it aside
[1:21:51] malice laid aside
[1:21:57] it's not worth missing the rapture for
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:02] and lay aside every besetting sin
[1:22:05] don't focus on the weight don't focus on
[1:22:07] the besetting sin god meets you right
[1:22:09] there in the altar of your heart but the
[1:22:11] authority of the word said lay it aside
[1:22:14] he's given the authority to lay it down
[1:22:18] and while laying that down why don't you
[1:22:20] lay down your life
[1:22:22] why don't you lay it down fully
[1:22:26] lay it all down at his feet
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] say lord god
[1:22:33] i want the token in my life
[1:22:36] i want the holy ghost in my life i want
[1:22:39] that assurance lord that's in my life i
