[0:13] but I'm just trying to try to listen to
[0:15] you know cousin so-and-so because you
[0:17] know I know they're really going through
[0:19] something what you end up finding is
[0:21] it's really not helping them and you can
[0:25] become weary in well-doing
[0:30] anybody ever been weary you know it's
[0:34] Satan's desire and objective the Bible
[0:37] says in the Book of Daniel that that
[0:40] spirit it seeks to wear down the power
[0:44] of the holy people when the windy enemy
[0:48] comes I'll tell you this is why your ear
[0:50] it'd be good to have spiritually
[0:52] spiritually hearing aids yeah when
[0:56] people want to come and say this and say
[0:59] that you just say you turn it off I
[1:04] don't think you're listening to me you
[1:08] got it you got it
[1:10] I don't think you're hearing what I'm
[1:12] saying you got it for which cause we
[1:18] faint not but though our outward man
[1:22] perish yet the inward man is renewed day
[1:26] by day you know this is Paul's not even
[1:28] talking this about as far as even in the
[1:31] perfection of his own life yet it is but
[1:34] Paul is all of this is about for the
[1:38] body for the body for our light
[1:40] affliction which is but for a moment
[1:42] worketh for us a far more exceeding and
[1:47] eternal weight of glory look at this
[1:49] focus while we look not at the things
[1:51] which are seen but at the things which
[1:53] are not seen for the things which are
[2:00] seen are temporal but the things which
[2:01] are not seen are eternal and they say
[2:05] lord help me to look beyond
[2:08] help me help me I got both of my hands
[2:11] up my hearts up help me help me because
[2:14] when I see I can see a lot of things
[2:16] before me but but Paul said we're
[2:18] looking to those things which are
[2:20] eternal so he's looking able to look
[2:23] beyond first Corinthians 4:7 for who
[2:32] maketh thee to differ from another and
[2:34] what has thou that thou did it's not
[2:36] receive now if thou didst receive it why
[2:40] does thou glory as if thou has not
[2:43] received it there's nothing we can glory
[2:46] in we have not done anything to receive
[2:50] or merit His grace we glory in him now
[2:56] look at this ye are full now you are
[3:00] rich I was not talking about materially
[3:04] he's speaking of spiritually now ye are
[3:09] full now you are rich I want you to
[3:12] watch this watch this this is the
[3:16] Corinthian church which sometimes people
[3:19] get caught in the in the end in the
[3:21] point of just saying a whole the
[3:22] Corinthian church was a weak church they
[3:24] all had their weak points but Paul if
[3:27] you read carefully in the book of
[3:29] Corinth Paul points out also growth
[3:31] that's taking place in their life by the
[3:34] time it gets to second Corinthians Paul
[3:36] can acknowledge them before others
[3:40] growth look at this my four I think oh
[3:46] wait a minute let me go back you have
[3:48] reigned as kings without us and I would
[3:51] to God you did reign that we may also
[3:53] reign with you you have reigned as kings
[3:55] what God
[3:56] what's he speaking of as Kings or
[3:59] brother Samuel they had all kinds of
[4:01] service no spiritual kings the wire the
[4:06] ministry of the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:09] which has loosened us from our sins he
[4:14] filled us with his spirit and made us to
[4:18] be kings and priests unto a god you are
[4:22] Shh you have a rain now in your life
[4:25] you're raining have spiritual kings
[4:28] you've got a kingdom you've got a domain
[4:30] you've been raised up as sons and
[4:32] daughters of God you're no longer in
[4:35] bondage and we're reigning with you
[4:39] we're not dwelling in your body but the
[4:41] word that was in our hearts is now
[4:44] moving in your life your soul you're
[4:49] rich you'll reigned as kings and we are
[4:52] glad we're glad the dead of love I or
[5:00] for I think that God hath set forth us
[5:05] the Apostles last as it were appointed
[5:08] to death for we are made a spectacle
[5:13] unto the world and to angels and to men
[5:18] that's not necessarily a good thing as
[5:21] far as the way the world would look at
[5:24] it it's not necessarily a welcoming
[5:27] thing so much to our flesh to be made a
[5:29] spectacle in other words to be this word
[5:32] means it's like a theater where a
[5:35] theater they would hold plays and when
[5:38] you hold a play in a theater
[5:39] there's acts that are done they're
[5:42] scripts that are handed out you have a
[5:44] certain line and there's a certain way
[5:46] that you have to go and act out this
[5:48] line you're part of the plan and program
[5:52] of God you've got a script to act out
[5:57] it's not just here you act it out out
[6:00] there you act it out among one another
[6:03] act it out and our families act it out
[6:05] in our communities in our life acting
[6:08] out everywhere we go our desire is they
[6:13] may not know my name but let it be that
[6:16] they know a Christian has been here a
[6:20] believer has been here something
[6:24] different about that man or that woman
[6:27] something's never I don't know their
[6:28] name something's different about their
[6:33] you know what that is that's making
[6:35] yourself of no reputation or made of
[6:44] spectacle and that's something not just
[6:49] to the world
[6:49] but brother joy to the Angels the angels
[6:52] are beholding this angels who do not
[6:57] know what redemption is but the Angels
[7:02] are beholding and seeing the glory of
[7:04] God being displayed through mortality to
[7:07] where that the angels think of it when
[7:09] they were getting ready to be cast in
[7:11] the fiery furnace remember the
[7:14] dramatization the Prophet would give and
[7:15] say wormwood said then he go down and
[7:17] I'll drowned it out right the angels are
[7:30] beholding what are they beholding his
[7:35] coming in you and me did you catch that
[7:40] the angels are beholding the coming of
[7:43] the Lord in your life in my life not as
[7:47] corporal body the spiritual the word the
[7:51] black coming Christ the mystery their
[7:54] whole their beholding that coming in you
[7:57] as we're delivered unto death what is it
[8:00] the coming of the Lord
[8:01] surging out were made a spectacle
[8:06] ain't gonna be made no spectacle but
[8:09] when we see this we're made a spectacle
[8:12] unto the world and if the Angels
[8:14] themselves
[8:16] hushed revelations 8:1 the Bible says
[8:21] and when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[8:22] There was silence
[8:28] of this mystery they were so taken back
[8:32] were made a spectacle the world says
[8:35] their foolish their crazy why in the
[8:39] world don't you denounce why don't you
[8:41] how in the world what in the world makes
[8:43] you tick but the Angels this brings the
[8:53] reality of the seals right down in our
[8:56] lives the coming of the Lord and two men
[9:01] we are fools for Christ's sake we not
[9:07] made ourselves odd we don't go out and
[9:09] make ourselves odd we are fools for his
[9:12] sake but ye are wise in Christ we are
[9:16] weak but you are strong ye are honorable
[9:21] but we are despised you're honorable
[9:26] we're despised we're a weak but you're
[9:29] strong it'll seem like an equal trade
[9:31] off ah it just depends on how we're
[9:34] looking at it the dead of love ow
[9:37] I'm weak so you're strong you're weak so
[9:41] I can be strong hey wait up me it's not
[9:46] about you even unto this present hour
[9:53] think about this think about this
[9:55] prophet of God writing this but the joy
[9:58] I don't know if this one he wrote this
[10:00] one it was with big letters cuz you know
[10:02] he talked about that enrolments how i've
[10:04] wrote to you in big letters because his
[10:06] eyes were the same we're always affected
[10:08] after the pillar of fire you would come
[10:11] and go and come and go I don't know but
[10:13] I do know this condition even under this
[10:16] present hour we both hunger and thirst
[10:19] and our naked are buffered and then half
[10:21] no certain dwelling place this Paul is
[10:24] not making this statement known with a
[10:27] 1-800 number below are you with me Paul
[10:31] did not make this statement on a
[10:33] telecast with a 1-800 number sow seed
[10:36] faith money I never forget brother
[10:41] Donnie had told me one
[10:42] he said I remember in Pentecost he said
[10:43] when taking up offerings he told dad and
[10:46] I this is one time he said there was a
[10:47] man he said would get out there he said
[10:48] as a preacher and he'd wear a certain
[10:50] shoes when it was time to take up
[10:51] offering and he would got there glory to
[10:53] God hallelujah and he said in the bottom
[10:55] and that's you it had a bigger hole go
[10:58] to god out of loo why to make the people
[11:02] oh man this guy really needs a good
[11:07] offering sad to say he'll give an
[11:11] account for that if he hadn't already
[11:13] made it a right you know but here's what
[11:16] Paul's not Paul's not saying these
[11:18] things - for somebody to feel sorry for
[11:20] him
[11:20] are you with me friends sometimes this
[11:23] is where we got a dessert that even with
[11:25] situations that there might be things
[11:28] presented to you and I that you or me in
[11:30] our compassion could feel sorry but
[11:33] you've got to discern it by the word
[11:35] don't be drawn away by sympathy or
[11:38] compassion standing upon the word Paul
[11:42] is not trying to play upon their
[11:44] sympathy you see that's one of the
[11:47] things you're going to always say why
[11:48] are you telling me this why are you
[11:51] telling me this you trying to draw me to
[11:53] your side y'all got quiet why are you
[11:57] telling me this
[12:00] everybody's got to assert their point
[12:03] their argument and labor working with
[12:14] our own hands what a what a statement
[12:20] Wow
[12:21] I thought to be in full-time ministry
[12:24] you had to be fully dependent no I
[12:27] already knew that many years ago men
[12:29] told me before so oh you're not
[12:31] full-time yet if I went full-time tell
[12:33] me what I was you see no matter what
[12:37] anybody had ever told me or what anybody
[12:39] ever thought I don't care what people
[12:41] think I don't make decisions based on
[12:44] somebody says I've got a feeling that
[12:45] you know I talked to God just as you
[12:48] talk to God if he has something for me
[12:50] to know tell me over the same out
[12:55] and labor working with our own hands
[12:59] think about this Paul was not grumbling
[13:02] or complaining about this are you it
[13:06] wasn't easy
[13:07] Paul said I work with my own hands being
[13:11] reviled we bless being persecuted we
[13:15] suffer it being defamed we announce it
[13:19] on Facebook you see some folks will
[13:25] never ever say it to your face
[13:28] which they shouldn't do that anyhow but
[13:31] they'll do it on Facebook or all these
[13:33] other things I'm telling you it shows
[13:36] what kind of spirit if people or listen
[13:38] if you love those kind of things and you
[13:41] delight in busyness and all kinds of
[13:43] things you need to be born again that's
[13:47] absolutely what the prophet has said and
[13:49] it's a truth if you delight in that you
[13:52] still love the world can I finish this I
[13:57] only got brother Doug I only got 10 more
[13:59] pages
[14:00] I love brother Doug he always teases me
[14:07] so good to see you tonight brother Doug
[14:09] good to see you
[14:11] I really am well let me just let me just
[14:12] finish this part I mean just someone
[14:19] skip
[14:25] Paul's talking about his bonds in
[14:27] Philippians 1 and in verse 12 brother
[14:32] Brian go right there and then I'm gonna
[14:33] skip a little bit I would you would
[14:35] understand brethren I would you would
[14:38] understand didn't they're wonderful I
[14:40] would you would understand you you need
[14:42] to know what's taking place that the
[14:45] things which happened unto me have
[14:48] fallen out rather unto the furtherance
[14:50] of the gospel I wonder how that they
[14:53] were praying there at that time maybe
[14:55] they were praying o God get Paul out of
[14:57] there Lord no doubt they were praying
[14:58] for Paul's deliverance but Paul was
[15:00] letting him know brother and I want you
[15:02] to understand something that this has
[15:05] fallen out to the furtherance of the
[15:08] gospel so that my bonds in Christ wasn't
[15:14] he and bonds in jail yeah but Paul has
[15:17] already put there's a greater bonds
[15:20] bonds in Christ I am where I am because
[15:23] God has ordained me for this hour
[15:27] manifest in all the palace and in all
[15:30] other places I tell you what if their
[15:33] manifest in all the palace and all the
[15:34] other places it surely wasn't because
[15:36] Paul was screaming out get these bonds
[15:39] off of me somebody get me out of here no
[15:42] that wouldn't have been the bonds of
[15:45] Christ that would have been the bonds of
[15:50] complaining of which he could have
[15:53] because in this place was not a nice
[15:58] comfortable place but in the midst of a
[16:02] place to where that even when you look
[16:04] at some of the prisons where Paul
[16:06] himself would dwell to where that he's
[16:08] not even it was not even if I could say
[16:11] it like the prisons and things they have
[16:13] today which would be extreme luxury
[16:16] report could go from one side of the
[16:18] cell to the other to use the bathroom he
[16:20] couldn't even do that he's chained up
[16:24] there was nothing delightful about this
[16:27] but Paul chose to write to you and I the
[16:31] Barnes I'm in is the bonds
[16:34] and many of the Brethren in the Lord
[16:37] waxing confident by my bonds see if Paul
[16:42] would have been complaining how could
[16:45] others have waxed confident by his bonds
[16:49] are much more bold to speak the word
[16:52] without fear
[16:53] verse 18 what then notwithstanding every
[16:56] way whether in pretence or in truth
[16:58] Christ is preached and I therein do
[17:01] rejoice yay and will rejoice for I know
[17:04] that this shall turn into my salvation
[17:06] through your prayer and the supply of
[17:08] the spirit of Jesus Christ according to
[17:12] my earnest expectation and my hope that
[17:14] in nothing shall I be ashamed that with
[17:19] all boldness as always so now also
[17:22] Christ shall be magnified in my body the
[17:30] same body that's always bearing about
[17:32] the dying of the Lord Jesus Christ shall
[17:36] be magnified in my body whether it be by
[17:39] life or by death for to me to live is
[17:43] Christ and to die is gain Philippians
[17:48] 2:14 I am coming down here let me
[17:55] brother Brian moved to verse 25 I just
[17:59] skip a little bit yeah he says I
[18:04] supposed it necessary to send you
[18:08] yep Aphrodite's my brother and companion
[18:12] in labor and fellow soldier but your
[18:17] messenger I thought Paul was the
[18:20] messenger Paul was the messenger of the
[18:23] age but epaphroditus was their messenger
[18:27] he was the local angel to the church who
[18:33] glory be to God see he was a under
[18:37] messenger and he that ministered noticed
[18:41] this and he that ministered to my wants
[18:44] so here is a papri Titus and here Paul
[18:46] is pointing out
[18:47] he ministered to my wants for he longed
[18:50] after you all and was full of heaviness
[18:55] because that ye had heard that he had
[18:59] been sick so notice they had heard the
[19:01] congregation had heard he was sick and
[19:04] then when he heard that they what they
[19:07] had heard concerning his sickness which
[19:10] he almost died he was within heaviness
[19:13] to return to them I asked you who put
[19:18] this in a pepra deines did Paul teach
[19:21] this in him or was this what God said in
[19:25] Jeremiah that I will give you pastors
[19:28] according to my own heart that will
[19:31] teach you in knowledge and understanding
[19:34] with honor just no knowledge we want to
[19:37] have understanding for he longed after
[19:43] you and was full of heaviness because
[19:45] that she had heard that he had been sick
[19:48] for indeed he was sick nigh unto death
[19:51] but God had mercy on him what's what
[19:53] commendation Paul puts here and not on
[19:56] him only but on me also lest I should
[20:00] have sorrow upon sorrow Paul said to
[20:04] lose this man would have brought sorrow
[20:08] Paul can you how can you say that it had
[20:11] to have been you remember they
[20:12] interviewed the brother Graham had with
[20:14] sister Bruce remember that right before
[20:18] the masterpiece remember sister Bruce
[20:20] asked him the question you know she
[20:21] wants to know that she's had an
[20:23] experience she's been filled with the
[20:24] Holy Ghost and brother Bama makes so
[20:25] many mistakes on and on and on she goes
[20:27] and brother Bram she and at the end of
[20:29] it she's remember brother but she's out
[20:31] of heart condition or she's feeling as
[20:32] though she does and she feels like that
[20:34] maybe she's gonna die and brother brems
[20:36] says no sister sister you're you're not
[20:39] gonna die if that's your nerves right
[20:42] but then he prays in prayer and the
[20:45] prayer that brother Branham prays he
[20:47] said God please don't take her she's
[20:51] such an asset
[20:52] to this church what a thing to be said
[20:59] she's such an asset to this church
[21:05] that's what said right here about app
[21:07] aphrodite's he's an asset to what is it
[21:11] because that app afroditi says you know
[21:13] brought Paul this and Rob no no and
[21:15] papri Dittus is operating under the same
[21:17] burden and heart's desire that paul has
[21:21] and that's to see that all men would
[21:24] come to the knowledge and revelation of
[21:27] this mystery
[21:28] I sent him look at this in verse 28 I
[21:32] sent him there for them more carefully
[21:35] that when you see him again no I sent
[21:37] him more carefully
[21:38] I wonder if Paul said if afroditi us
[21:41] it's a five days journey but I want you
[21:45] to take ten to get there but I want to
[21:49] see him but I want you to take ten
[21:52] because be not weary in well-doing
[21:54] you need to be able to do something for
[21:57] him when you get there I sent him the
[22:02] more carefully that when you see him
[22:07] again you may rejoice and that I may be
[22:11] the less sorrowful receive him therefore
[22:15] in the Lord with all gladness and holds
[22:18] such in reputation because for the work
[22:23] of Christ he was nigh unto death because
[22:32] for the work of Christ he was nigh unto
[22:40] death now because Paul had not because
[22:43] the pepero dadís had taken a bunch of
[22:45] overtime but same as going in on a
[22:49] positive note it is he was not 9 to
[22:53] death because he had bit off more than
[22:55] he could chew in order to advance
[22:58] himself
[23:02] this was not about advancing a kingdom
[23:05] of Epaphroditus this was for the work of
[23:10] Christ and Paul could see it that the
[23:15] heart of God that same heart that had
[23:18] moved within Paul's heart was also in
[23:23] epaphroditus for the work of Christ he
[23:28] was mounted it the work of Christ is
[23:32] preaching laboring but remember he was
[23:35] ministering to Paul's wants not
[23:41] regarding his life to supply your lack
[23:48] of service toward me nepal's not putting
[23:50] him down
[23:51] Paul's letting him know you all back
[23:53] there were not able to do for me what he
[23:55] could do but I want to let you know what
[23:58] your messenger I want to let you know
[24:01] what you're a local angel I want to let
[24:03] you know of how he ministered to me and
[24:06] he was nigh unto death I want you to
[24:11] think of this don't get caught on just a
[24:13] Pat Forde itis but to think that same
[24:19] image and that same character if it was
[24:23] caught into the heart of epaphroditus
[24:26] was not that same heart and character
[24:29] caught in the heart of the Philippian
[24:32] believers where they themselves would
[24:37] willingly give themselves for the work
[24:41] of Christ among one another in their
[24:44] local parts and what they could do were
[24:48] things that a Patra Dittus could not do
[24:51] but that's why it's a body the debt of
[24:55] love our less will just stop your
[24:58] tonight the debt of love oh the
[25:02] sufferings as Paul said as we begin the
[25:05] sufferings for you I said god help me
[25:11] help us sometimes we're so occupied with
[25:15] talking about sufferings of our own self
[25:18] and we don't rejoice in them much less
[25:22] rejoice when suffering for others but I
[25:28] believe that that same life is within me
[25:32] and you I believe that with all my heart
[25:35] and I believe that same God that
[25:37] ministers to us tonight you know what
[25:39] this is
[25:40] it's His grace calling out of us his
[25:44] life and were made a spectacle unto the
[25:48] world unto men unto angels your loving

[27:01] no way that
[27:05] Lord that we could ever to be able to
[27:07] fully grasp it but I pray Lord from our
[27:12] hearts we want to fully submit we want
[27:18] to fully fully surrender because it's
[27:24] true it's we want to give ourselves unto
[27:28] you more fully Lord maybe there's one
[27:32] here tonight that hasn't even made that
[27:34] step to give themselves to you lord I
[27:36] pray tonight your God is your presence
[27:39] when they can see that the gospel is
[27:43] about Lord your love reaching down
[27:49] on their behalf to bring them into a
[27:54] place and a union with you
[27:58] oh god I pray tonight free every hand
[28:02] that's been lifted every heart behind
[28:04] that hand lord help us Lord in our lives
[28:08] we ask that you would forgive us Lord as
[28:14] we have lived and lived for self there's
[28:17] been many times Lord and I know that
[28:19] we've repented of that we've made those
[28:22] things Lord but you know hearts were
[28:24] just in this tender moment Lord we just
[28:28] realize all God in this tenderness where
[28:30] you bring us to this place Lord you made
[28:33] us we who were unlovable you made us
[28:36] love the outpouring of your life and
[28:40] father tonight there's a lot of things
[28:44] that we can busy ourselves with where we
[28:46] can look at and get focused on but may
[28:48] Lord we be and have the testimony like
[28:51] if afroditi swear Paul as the messenger
[28:54] the age could point out and say this man
[28:59] was mined to death he was a blessing he
[29:02] ministered to my needs and his heart was
[29:07] for you O God may our heart not be
[29:11] filled with the things of this life may
[29:14] our heart not be filled Lord I'm a
[29:18] collection of feelings and every but God
[29:20] let our lives be filled with you Lord
[29:25] may that be the testimony
[29:28] for the work of Christ see Lord we can
[29:32] do a lot of things we can work we could
[29:36] work and work maybe we could sweep off
[29:38] the gravel off of the sidewalk out of
[29:40] here
[29:41] I believe that be a blessing Lord God to
[29:44] the people Lord but if we're doing that
[29:47] Lord in just a manner of just works and
[29:50] it's not something that we would do is
[29:52] unto the Lord it's fine as your prophet
[29:56] said that's fine but it's much deeper
[30:00] than that it's living for others we're
[30:05] in that it requires life Lord how that
[30:11] we want to be in our lives we know that
[30:13] even as a pepper Edyta see he busied
[30:16] himself there were needs that had to be
[30:18] met Lord we know that in this even in
[30:20] this local assembly there's there's a
[30:22] needs or there's burdens Lord there's
[30:24] things that have to be attended to how I
[30:26] thank you for the musicians lord I thank
[30:29] you Lord God that many that are not even
[30:32] up here tonight playing but Lord yet
[30:34] they themselves surrendering their gifts
[30:36] and their talents that you've given them
[30:38] Lord but not doing it out of law I thank
[30:43] you dear God for the song leaders Lord I
[30:46] think your father for every deacon every
[30:48] trustee I thank you dear God for Lord
[30:51] Jesus each and every one Lord running
[30:53] Lord in the different booths and making
[30:56] these things come about they're not
[30:57] doing it to advance their cause I thank
[30:59] you Lord for every brother and sister
[31:01] here Lord because they may not run in
[31:03] the video booth or the audio booth maybe
[31:05] they don't have that burden but Lord God
[31:07] they've got a burden Lord for this work
[31:09] Lord they've got a burden Lord God they
[31:11] want to see you glorified it's not to
[31:13] lift up Samuel Browning it's not to lift
[31:15] up believers we're tabernacle
[31:17] but it's a lift up Jesus Christ and they
[31:21] operate with that burden Lord no doubt
[31:23] God sitting right here
[31:24] brothers and sisters Lord that tucked
[31:26] away in their prayer closet on the job
[31:29] when they've been driving and Lord
[31:30] they're praying say God speak to brother
[31:32] Samuel heart speak or God to the heart
[31:35] Lord God and my brother you know what we
[31:37] need Lord has a church and Lord tonight
[31:39] even
[31:40] if there's something Lord where it seems
[31:41] like I only get a crumb out of this
[31:44] message and my brother gets a whole loaf
[31:46] I'm gonna rejoice because the Lord Jesus
[31:49] I want to see that help because if my
[31:53] brother gets a loaf if my sister gets a
[31:55] loaf and I have a crumb Lord you will
[31:57] allow me to have that crumb to see what
[32:00] kind of an attitude that even I will
[32:01] take because if my brother gets a loaf
[32:05] he's part of the body but I'm a part of
[32:08] he might need that loaf and as he needs
[32:12] that lo I'm gonna be so thankful I'm
[32:15] gonna be happy because he might be my
[32:19] little finger but he's part of me he
[32:23] might be my heart but he's part of me
[32:26] I'm part of him Lord Jesus now we love
