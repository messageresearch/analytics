[28:01] we'll [singing] meet our blessed [music]
[28:03] Jesus.

[29:36] [music] the blood.
[29:39] [singing]
[29:42] I was born [singing and music] in save.
[29:51] And the devil, he tried his
[29:54] [music and singing] best to keep me
[29:57] down.
[30:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[30:02] Oh, but then I heard from my Theophony
[30:08] [music]
[30:12] by this message
[30:15] of Malachi

[31:21] smiling like there's a tickler on the
[31:22] inside that keeps that feather inside
[31:24] that keeps [music]
[31:26] even when things are bad, even when
[31:27] things are tough, there's something
[31:28] inside you that this just there's still
[31:31] a happiness down there. Amen. That
[31:33] eventually will overtake that that trial
[31:36] and that trouble. Hallelujah. Thank you
[31:37] for that, Jesus.

[35:59] your name.

[36:54] Oh Jesus, I bless
[36:58] your name.
[37:01] [music]
[37:03] I give you [singing] honor.
[37:11] I [music] give you praise.
[37:18] For [music] you are
[37:20] the life,
[37:25] the truth,
[37:27] the [music] way.
[37:33] I bless [music and singing] I bless your
[37:35] name.
[37:40] I bless
[37:43] your name.
[37:46] Oh my
[37:48] Oh, hallelujah.
[37:50] [applause]
[37:51] &gt;&gt; What greater thing could we do right
[37:53] now? What greater thing than just to
[37:54] give praise and honor and glory to him?
[37:57] Amen. We certainly couldn't wear it out.
[38:00] We certainly couldn't give him what he
[38:02] deserves, but I sure like to try.
[38:04] [laughter]
[38:06] I'd like to let him know a little bit
[38:08] how I feel about it. Amen. I And I
[38:10] believe I'm with people that feel the
[38:11] same way today. Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we just uh let's just
[38:15] look to him in a word of prayer right
[38:18] now while we're just in this presence.
[38:20] We'll just bow our heads. Oh Lord, we're
[38:23] so blessed.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we've come into this new year
[38:28] and
[38:29] &gt;&gt; we look at the signs of the times all
[38:32] around us. Lord, we're so grateful that
[38:35] we have received a kingdom which cannot
[38:38] be removed. And wow, the world is
[38:41] falling apart and everything's falling
[38:43] into its place. There's a bride that
[38:45] she's there's gravitation is losing its
[38:48] power over her. The world has lost its
[38:50] strength over her. Lord, today we're not
[38:52] looking just for an exodus, but we
[38:54] believe even now by your spirit that you
[38:57] HAVE TRANSLATED US OUT of the powers of
[38:59] darkness into the kingdom of your dear
[39:01] son. And today we're as free as a people
[39:04] could be. Paul and Silas could sit in a
[39:06] jail cell. But they were the freest
[39:08] people
[39:08] &gt;&gt; in Philippi Cesaria that day.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it was deliverance for a
[39:12] jailer. It was a deliverance for his
[39:14] home. And I pray today, Lord, if there
[39:17] be one like that jailer that doesn't
[39:19] know you, Lord, maybe we'd meet one like
[39:21] that jailer after we leave here today.
[39:23] May we be like that man, Paul. May we be
[39:26] like those apostles of old, bearing the
[39:29] gospel of Jesus Christ, showing freedom
[39:32] and liberty, Lord, that this world is
[39:34] not our home, but we're just passing
[39:36] through. And Lord, as we're here now, we
[39:39] just want to take this time to look into
[39:41] your word. I pray something today would
[39:43] be said, not from my ability as a man,
[39:46] but may you take these lips of clay and
[39:48] impart something of eternal value. May
[39:51] it may it broaden our perspective. May
[39:53] help us to see Jesus to see you in a
[39:56] greater way. We pray. I ask you bless
[39:58] now the reading of this word. May you
[40:01] give the context to this text. May it be
[40:04] an overcoming. May it be a a deliverance
[40:07] and a help, a strengthening for your
[40:09] people today. We pray. We commit it now
[40:11] into your hands. You are a faithful
[40:13] creator, the father of lights. There is
[40:16] no variableness or shadow of turning.
[40:18] You what you've purposed for us, you
[40:20] will perform. And we know your plans.
[40:23] You've told us you have plans for us,
[40:24] plans for peace, for an expected end. We
[40:27] look to you now and we thank you in
[40:29] Jesus Christ's name.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[40:32] And amen. God bless you. Good to be with
[40:34] you all once again this day. We just
[40:36] want to say happy new year. God bless
[40:38] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:40] Christ. We are uh I just uh you know,
[40:43] I'll say this real quick. I was talking
[40:45] to a brother about this a month or two
[40:46] ago. There's some there's uh and now I'm
[40:49] not nitpicking on anybody here, but you
[40:50] know, some brothers were talking about
[40:51] their trials and things that they go
[40:53] through and stuff and we all we all do
[40:55] that, but there was an older brother
[40:56] nearby and I looked at him and I said,
[40:58] "Brother, I want to ask you a question."
[41:00] I said, "When was the best time of your
[41:02] life as a Christian?" And he smiled and
[41:04] said, "Right now, brother."
[41:06] &gt;&gt; And I thought of uh I thought of FF
[41:07] Bosworth when he was there on the bed,
[41:09] passed away. And brother Bram, go talk
[41:10] to him. My father, my father, the
[41:12] chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[41:14] thereof. He said, "Brother Bosworth,
[41:16] what was your what was the best time for
[41:17] you to be a Christian, to serve God?" I
[41:19] said, "It's right now."
[41:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Five minutes from now, I'm
[41:23] going to be in the presence. I've
[41:24] preached about him. I've talked about
[41:25] him." And, you know, maybe we're not
[41:26] five minutes away, but maybe we are, but
[41:29] we're closer than we've ever been. And
[41:30] so, that's that's how I feel about it.
[41:32] That's been my that's my testimony. He
[41:35] gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go
[41:37] by.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; And I hope you feel that way today. If
[41:39] you don't, maybe you'll feel that way
[41:41] when you leave. But anyhow, we just we
[41:43] just trust the Lord is blessing each one
[41:45] of you doing something in your lives and
[41:46] and it's like I said last time, you
[41:48] know, sometimes the worst moments of
[41:49] your life are the best moments. You just
[41:50] don't realize it. So, we just trust the
[41:52] Lord as we go into 2026. The bride's
[41:55] moving forward. Amen.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; There's no retreat. There's no backing
[41:58] up. We're we're pressing on. And if you
[42:00] have your Bibles this morning, before I
[42:01] I introduce myself too long, we'll go
[42:04] into the Psalms this morning and we're
[42:06] going to look into the 90th Psalm. It is
[42:08] a prayer of Moses, the man of God. And
[42:10] I've looked at this thought before, but
[42:12] I'm just going to kind of take it a
[42:13] little different here. I don't know if I
[42:14] looked at it here before, but we're just
[42:16] going to read a couple uh three verses
[42:18] here this morning, and then I'll have
[42:19] you be seated in the 90th Psalm. And uh
[42:22] we'll come back to some more of this
[42:23] later, but we'll start in the 10th
[42:25] verse. And
[42:26] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[42:26] &gt;&gt; um Moses, among other things, he's
[42:28] talking about the brevity and the
[42:30] shortness of life. It's kind of one of
[42:32] our themes this morning. Um now, I'm not
[42:35] always good about giving the title.
[42:36] Brian will get a hold of me a couple
[42:38] days later and be like, "Brother, what
[42:39] are you doing?" I'm like, "I don't
[42:41] know." I probably didn't have one at the
[42:42] time, actually. So, uh, I have a title,
[42:45] but I can't give it yet because it's one
[42:46] of them like them cliffhanger things.
[42:48] You I don't know how you So, we'll get
[42:50] to it a little bit, but if I forget,
[42:51] remind me. [laughter and snorts]
[42:54] Amen. But verse 10 here says this, "The
[42:57] days of our years are three score years
[42:59] in 10." That's 70, by the way. And if
[43:01] reason by strength they be four score
[43:03] years, yet is their strength labor and
[43:06] sorrow. For it is soon cut off, and we
[43:09] fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine
[43:12] anger? Even according to thy fear, so is
[43:16] thy wrath. This is pretty bleak, but
[43:18] we'll bring it full circle here. Amen.
[43:20] Notice this verse 12. So teach us to
[43:22] number our days that we may apply our
[43:26] hearts unto wisdom.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless the reading. where
[43:30] you may be seated this morning.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Well, I was afraid I was going to get
[43:38] cold up here and I'm already warm. So,
[43:40] y'all lit a fire in here or something, I
[43:42] guess. But,
[43:44] um, I like this statement here,
[43:47] especially that that Moses, of course,
[43:49] he lived to be 120, but makes this point
[43:51] about teach us to number our days that
[43:52] we may apply our hearts into wisdom. It
[43:54] echoes the same sentiment that Paul
[43:56] speaks about in the book of Ephesians
[43:57] the 5th chapter where he says this in
[43:59] Ephesians chapter 5. He says, "See then
[44:01] that ye walk circumspectly not as fools
[44:04] but as wise redeeming the time because
[44:07] the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not
[44:10] unwise but understanding what the will
[44:13] of the Lord is." Amen. And so I got to
[44:15] thinking about this with this scripture
[44:16] this morning and just this thought kind
[44:18] of came to me a little bit. You know,
[44:19] it's one thing to have wisdom and it's
[44:22] another thing to apply it to your heart,
[44:23] as Moses would say. Apply it to your
[44:25] heart. Amen. And we see this
[44:26] particularly in the life of Solomon,
[44:28] whom we'll revisit here in a little bit.
[44:29] But, you know, here was a man that had
[44:31] wisdom gifted to him and then he desired
[44:33] more wisdom. And in his pursuit of this,
[44:36] he left off to act in a way that was
[44:38] wise or to apply it to his heart. And of
[44:40] course, Brother Bram talks about this.
[44:41] He ends his life in a backsliden state.
[44:43] He married a thousand different women.
[44:44] They led his heart astray from God,
[44:46] different kinds of gods, all kinds of
[44:47] different directions. And so, uh, you
[44:49] know, it's it's a it's a reminder to us.
[44:51] It's a teachable moment. Amen. That, uh,
[44:54] you know, our fallen nature, if I can
[44:56] say this, even our carnal-mindedness as
[44:58] Christians, sometimes we're not always
[45:00] careful or mindful of our time. Amen.
[45:04] And so, this is why Moses makes this
[45:06] plea. Teach us to number our days. Why?
[45:08] THAT WE MIGHT APPLY our hearts to
[45:10] wisdom. Amen. Now, for some of us,
[45:12] hopefully most of us, as we're getting
[45:14] older, you realize at some point in your
[45:16] life that you don't have as much time on
[45:18] this earth as you thought you did when
[45:19] you were a teenager and you had big
[45:21] plans and you were going to do all this
[45:22] and all of a sudden, you know, you're
[45:23] like, I'm going to have a family. I'm
[45:24] going to do this. It's going to be
[45:25] great. And the next thing you know, you
[45:26] you've got three little babies here and
[45:28] this is going on. The next thing you
[45:29] know, you're how am I going to retire?
[45:31] And so, IT GOES IT GOES you you young
[45:34] people especially, you probably get sick
[45:35] of hearing this, but it goes by a lot
[45:36] faster than you think. And the Bible
[45:39] makes this point. It's just like the
[45:40] grass. I'll come back to it later, but
[45:41] Moses talks about it. It's like the
[45:43] grass. It's here one moment and it's
[45:45] gone the next.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And so before you know it, time
[45:47] disappears. Amen. And and and you don't
[45:50] realize it almost till it's too late.
[45:52] Amen. You imagine if you had the wisdom,
[45:54] you say you're 50 years old. If you had
[45:56] the wisdom of of a 50 years old, a
[45:58] 50-year-old at the age of 15, you might
[46:00] do things a little bit differently.
[46:02] Amen. You might plan differently. YOU
[46:04] MIGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WILL be
[46:06] more careful with this or careful with
[46:08] that. AMEN. THERE'S ALL kinds of things
[46:10] that you would deal with. And so now I'm
[46:12] going to ask a question. It's New
[46:13] Year's. And I asked this a few years
[46:14] ago. I think everybody caught this. But
[46:16] it's New Year's. Did anybody make any
[46:17] New Year's resolutions for New Year's?
[46:19] Raise your hand if you did so I can I
[46:21] can make funny. See, of course not
[46:22] because you already know where this
[46:24] Brother Brian, God bless an honest
[46:25] heart. We'll we'll chide you the rest of
[46:28] the service. You [laughter] should know
[46:30] better.
[46:32] Brother Bam talks about this several
[46:33] different places in the message. You're
[46:34] probably familiar with it. Amen. But he
[46:36] talks about it like in the sermon for
[46:37] instance from that time he said you know
[46:39] he said you see a man all dirty and
[46:41] everything he said I'd rather have him
[46:43] with me many a time than someone dressed
[46:45] up with their maybe collar turned around
[46:47] and pat me on the back SAY OH BROTHER
[46:50] BRANDHAM WE'RE FOR YOU AND YOU KNOW
[46:52] RIGHT THAT HE'S lying well I'm sure
[46:54] nobody here's ever dealt with THAT THIS
[46:57] GUY'S LIKE OH WE'RE WITH YOU BROTHER
[46:58] BRANDON he says and you know that he's
[46:59] lying see I've got no use for a liar my
[47:03] he said you can hide from a thief but
[47:05] you can't hide from a liar. Now, I don't
[47:06] want to unpack all that this morning,
[47:08] but and THEN YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM THE
[47:10] LIAR. He says IT'S HE SAID, "THAT'S
[47:11] RIGHT." HE SAYS, "BUT WE" HE SAYS, "WHEN
[47:13] WE HIT THOSE SPOTS," HE'S preaching from
[47:15] that time. He says, "From that time." He
[47:17] says, "New years comes along. We go out
[47:18] and we write up a resolution. Tonight,
[47:20] wife, I'll give you the promise. I'll
[47:22] turn a new page and I'll never drink no
[47:25] more." And the woman smokes so many
[47:26] cigarettes till she can't nurse her baby
[47:28] no more. Give it nicotine poison. Kill
[47:31] it. SO, SHE'S GOING TO STOP SMOKING ON
[47:33] NEW YEAR'S. and the drunk's going to
[47:34] quit drinking on New Year's. The immoral
[47:37] PERSON'S GOING TO STOP THEIR IMMORALITY
[47:38] on New Year's and so forth like that.
[47:41] WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU YOU JUST TURN A NEW
[47:43] PAGE TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN THE NEXT DAY.
[47:46] SEE, and now he makes this statement. HE
[47:48] SAYS, "YOU DON'T GET STARTED RIGHT."
[47:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, BEFORE I GO INTO THAT, I WANT
[47:53] TO BROTHER BEN and I'll just paraphrase
[47:55] for the sake of time, but he goes
[47:56] through some different things and he
[47:58] talks about he was a boy during the
[47:59] First World War. They didn't call it
[48:00] World War I back then. They call it the
[48:02] great war. You know why they didn't call
[48:04] it World War I? Because they didn't have
[48:05] a two yet. Why would they call it one?
[48:07] AMEN. AND BROTHER TALKS ABOUT AS A BOY
[48:09] IN ABOUT I THINK HE TALKED ABOUT HAVING
[48:10] A SACK OF BEANS. If they came over here,
[48:12] he was going TO WHACK HIM WITH YOU KNOW
[48:13] HOW KIDS ARE. That's what he was going
[48:15] to do. You know, it's like a boogeyman.
[48:16] I'll I'll stick him with my you know
[48:18] what, you know. SO HE'S GOT THIS PLAN,
[48:20] BUT HE MAKES THIS POINT. AMEN. THAT WAR
[48:22] WAS SO BAD AND IT was a terrible thing.
[48:24] The way that people died and the number
[48:25] of people that died, the Spanish flu
[48:27] afterwards, it was such a horrible thing
[48:29] that they MADE AND BROTHER WOULD TALK
[48:30] ABOUT. HE would say they'd come there
[48:31] and be like, "YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL NEVER
[48:33] DO THAT AGAIN. We're never going to have
[48:35] WAR AGAIN." AMEN. THEY SAID, "IT'S THE
[48:38] WAR TO END ALL WARS." GUESS WHAT? WE HAD
[48:41] MORE WARS AFTER THAT.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT THEM TODAY. AMEN. LISTEN, now
[48:46] we're talking about getting STARTED
[48:47] RIGHT. AMEN. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT
[48:48] GETTING STARTED RIGHT BECAUSE A bunch of
[48:50] them, they didn't get rid OF THEIR GUNS.
[48:51] THEY GOT MORE.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WELL, OF COURSE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
[48:54] MORE WARS. YOU'RE READY FOR IT. AMEN.
[48:56] BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID. THERE WAS
[48:57] THIS WAS SUCH A TERRIBLE THING. NOW, I'M
[48:59] SAYING THIS FOR A REASON CUZ WE'VE DONE
[49:01] THAT IN OUR LIVES WITH THINGS. Maybe
[49:02] there's somebody in HERE TODAY EVEN
[49:04] THEY'RE WRESTLING WITH SOMETHING. THEY
[49:05] GO, "WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS WAS
[49:06] TERRIBLE, BUT I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN."
[49:08] AND THE NEXT DAY YOU DO IT AGAIN AND YOU
[49:10] FALL INTO IT. WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE
[49:12] SAME CYCLE. AMEN. WELL, I WOULD NEVER DO
[49:14] THAT. THAT WAS A HORRIBLE THING. I I'M
[49:16] NOT THAT WAY ANYMORE. AND IF WE'RE NOT
[49:18] CAREFUL, WE DON'T START OUT THE RIGHT
[49:20] WAY. AND IT'S JUST US SAYING IT. AMEN.
[49:23] THEY SAID, "WE'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.
[49:25] WE'LL NEVER HAVE WARS." AND WE HAD ONE
[49:26] EVEN WORSE AFTER THAT. WE'VE HAD WARS
[49:28] SINCE THEN.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THAT'S WHAT BROTHER BRAND WOULD
[49:32] SAY. LISTEN, IT WASN'T THE END. BROTHER
[49:33] BRAND WOULD TALK ABOUT HIS DAD. HE'D
[49:35] THROW THE TOBACCO OUT. EVERY NEW YEAR'S
[49:36] EVE, HE'D THROW THE TOBACCO OUT IN THE
[49:38] HOUSE AND BROTHER SAID, "I have to watch
[49:39] him. Where are you going to throw it?"
[49:40] Because the next day he'd be out there
[49:41] looking for it. Amen.
[49:44] Praise the Lord.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Now, uh, let me say this. Uh, now I had
[49:49] a brother, uh, where's where you at?
[49:51] Mention my I lost some weight. Thanks
[49:52] for because I know you all noticed this
[49:54] already. [laughter]
[49:56] Talking about losing weight and stuff.
[49:57] That's a big thing we do for New I need
[49:58] to get in shape. Amen. And I I actually
[50:01] I had a brother come to me at church
[50:02] here a while back. He's like, "Man, you
[50:03] lost some weight. How much did you
[50:04] weigh?" I said, "I be honest, I hadn't
[50:06] looked at it because I wasn't trying to
[50:07] lose weight originally." Uh uh now years
[50:10] ago, I went to a church service and
[50:13] there was a brother from India came in
[50:14] and he preached health and nutrition for
[50:15] 45 minutes. I'm not going to do that to
[50:17] you today. I thought this guy came all
[50:19] the way over here from the other side of
[50:20] the world to tell me to eat better. AND
[50:22] I DIDN'T LISTEN TO HIM THEN,
[50:25] AS YOU COULD PROBABLY FIGURE OUT. SO,
[50:27] I'M NOT BUT I'LL JUST MAKE THIS POINT. I
[50:28] I WENT TO THE DOCTOR HERE RECENTLY. And
[50:31] uh I'll just say this, THE DOCTOR WASN'T
[50:33] IMPRESSED WITH THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF
[50:35] MY HEALTH. MY WAISTLINE WAS GOING the
[50:36] wrong way. My numbers are going the
[50:38] WRONG WAY. AND SOME OF YOU can relate to
[50:39] that. Amen.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; And so I said, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT
[50:42] TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I've got to
[50:44] make a change. Amen. And this is what
[50:45] I'm getting at. Now, I don't want to
[50:47] unpack all this for you, but I'll make
[50:49] this point real quick. Amen. We I I try
[50:52] typically what we do is well I'll just
[50:53] I'll stop doing this and I'll start
[50:55] doing this and I'll stop doing this and
[50:57] WE FIND THAT OUR WILLPOWER IS NOT MEAT
[51:00] FOR THE CHALLENGE. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING
[51:03] BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. AMEN. AND SO
[51:06] WE'LL GET STARTED AND THEN COOKIES COME
[51:09] along in Christmas and THANKSGIVING AND
[51:11] AND SO I'M SAYING THIS FOR THIS REASON.
[51:13] I I started researching it and really
[51:14] looking into it and I'll I'll just throw
[51:16] this in real quick. The issue is not no
[51:19] so much of a calorie issue. It's a
[51:20] hormonal issue and if you fix the
[51:22] hormonal issue, blah blah blah blah
[51:24] blah, whatever. If you want it, I'll
[51:25] teach you afterwards. I'll send you my
[51:27] book. But anyway, I'm making it. And
[51:30] now, so what this is what I'M GETTING
[51:31] AT. I FOUND I GOT TO A PLACE WHERE I
[51:33] JUST DIDN'T CRAVE food anymore.
[51:35] Especially when I first started out, you
[51:36] could put food in front of me and I
[51:37] haven't eaten for a day. I had no desire
[51:39] to eat it. Amen. You say, "What's this
[51:41] got to do with anything?" When the
[51:42] temptation is gone, then it's NO LONGER
[51:45] A STRUGGLE TO DO IT. AMEN. AND SO WHAT
[51:48] HAPPENED? THE BROTHER MADE THIS COMMENT,
[51:49] "WELL, MAN, YOU YOU PICKED THE WORST
[51:51] TIME TO START. YOU YOU BECAUSE I STARTED
[51:53] AROUND Thanksgiving all through THE
[51:54] HOLIDAY SEASON. MOST PEOPLE WAIT TILL
[51:57] AFTERWARDS." AND I SAID, "THAT'S THE
[51:59] PROBLEM."
[52:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE GET TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND
[52:02] WE'RE LIKE, "WELL, LISTEN, MAN. Another
[52:04] year's gone by. I need to make some
[52:06] changes." If you really need to make
[52:07] them, you're not waiting
[52:10] &gt;&gt; TILL A CERTAIN TIME. YOU SAY, "WELL, YOU
[52:13] KNOW, I NEED TO STOP DRINKING. I'LL WAIT
[52:15] TILL AFTER I GET DRUNK ON NEW YEAR'S."
[52:17] THAT ALREADY SHOWS YOU DON'T REALLY
[52:19] CONSIDER THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION.
[52:21] AMEN.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; SO, this is what I'M GETTING AT. WE WE
[52:24] HAVE A WISDOM. WE RECOGNIZE A THING MUST
[52:26] BE DONE, [screaming] BUT SOMEHOW THE
[52:28] ONSET OF THE NEW YEAR DOESN'T GIVE YOU A
[52:30] A CONVICTION OR COMPULSION THAT ACTUALLY
[52:33] GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO DO IT. AND ALL
[52:35] IT'S DONE IS WE'VE LOOKED AT TIME IS
[52:37] PASSING. WE LOOK AT OUR DAYS. OUR DAYS
[52:39] ARE SHORT. WE'RE DOING WHAT MOSES SAID.
[52:40] WELL, MAN, TIME'S GOING ON. I NEED TO
[52:42] MAKE A CHANGE. AND THEN WE SIT THERE AND
[52:44] SAY, "WELL, I'LL MAKE A CHANGE IN A FEW
[52:45] DAYS." IF IT'S NOT WORTH YOU CHANGING
[52:47] RIGHT AWAY, THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
[52:49] WORTH YOU CHANGING IN A FEW DAYS. I'M
[52:51] SAYING SOMETHING NOW. AMEN. THE BIBLE
[52:53] SAYS TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. AND
[52:56] IF YOU WERE A SINNER SITTING THERE TODAY
[52:58] AND YOU SAID, "I NEED TO GET RIGHT WITH
[52:59] GOD." YOU DON'T SIT THERE AND SAY,
[53:00] "WELL, I BELIEVE I NEED TO GET RIGHT
[53:02] WITH GOD. MAYBE HERE IN A FEW WEEKS WHEN
[53:04] I GET DONE WITH MY PARTIES AND I GET
[53:05] DONE WITH MY CONCERTS AND I GET DONE
[53:07] WITH MY DRUGS AND I GET THEN I'LL GO
[53:09] MAKE IT RIGHT." THAT'S THE WRONG
[53:10] ATTITUDE. YOU'LL NEVER GET right
[53:13] &gt;&gt; cuz IT'S NOT REALLY SETTLED IN YOUR
[53:15] HEART. YOU'VE NOT APPLIED IT. AMEN. YOU
[53:18] KNOW BETTER. NOW LISTEN FOR MYSELF.
[53:21] AMEN. THE IMPENDING END OF THE YEAR DID
[53:24] NOT SUDDENLY GRANT ME KNOWLEDGE THAT I
[53:27] DID NOT HAVE BEFORE THAT I NEED TO BE
[53:29] HEALTHIER. AMEN. IT'S NOT LIKE OH THE
[53:31] YEAR IS OVER NOW. AND YOU KNEW THE WHOLE
[53:33] TIME.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; YOU KNEW THE WHOLE TIME.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PASSING OF TIME REMINDS YOU OH
[53:38] SOMETHING NEEDS DONE. SO, WHAT DO WE DO?
[53:41] WE'LL PUT IT OFF A FEW MORE DAYS AND ALL
[53:43] YOU'VE DONE IS PERPETUATE.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord. Listen, IF IT'S
[53:49] WORTH YOU DOING, IT'S WORTH YOU DOING
[53:50] NOW. AMEN. LISTEN, WHY I BELIEVE A MAN
[53:52] SHOULD SERVE GOD. IF IT'S WORTH SERVING
[53:54] GOD EVER, IT'S WORTH SERVING GOD TODAY.
[53:56] IF IT'S I NEED TO PRAY MORE. WELL, IF
[53:58] YOU WANT TO PRAY MORE, I'D START TODAY.
[53:59] I WOULDN'T WAIT TO SEE. WE'LL WAIT TILL
[54:01] A CRISIS COMES. WE'LL WAIT TILL THE NEW
[54:03] YEAR. WE'LL WAIT TILL THE THAT'S NOT HOW
[54:05] THAT WORKS. AMEN. THAT'S NOT A
[54:06] conviction in your heart. YOU JUST KNOW
[54:08] BETTER. BUT YOU WON'T DO BETTER.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. See, now I got to make
[54:12] sure if I gain all this weight back, I
[54:13] look like a hypocrite. [laughter]
[54:16] But I'm making this point. AMEN. THE
[54:18] ISSUE IS THAT SOMETHING IN OUR LIVES
[54:20] NEEDS CORRECTED. There's a temptation or
[54:22] whatever. And and and people, they start
[54:24] out wrong. Brother Ram said, "AMEN."
[54:26] THEY KNOW THEY SHOULD STOP ALREADY AND
[54:28] THEY'RE TRYING TO DELIVER THEMSELVES
[54:30] FROM A THING. AMEN. But like brother
[54:32] Bram said, when now the same quote,
[54:34] Brother Ram talks about this, when a man
[54:35] meets God, then everything changes.
[54:37] Amen. So in OTHER WORDS, WE ARE TRYING
[54:39] TO DO SO many times things in now maybe
[54:41] your problem today isn't your waistline
[54:43] or whatever. Maybe it's something that's
[54:44] beyond that. But we look at addiction.
[54:46] We look at different problems. WE LOOK
[54:47] AT TRIALS in our life. Amen. And what
[54:49] we're doing, we're not committing it to
[54:51] God. WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT on our own.
[54:53] AND WE'RE LETTING SOME ARBITRARY DATE ON
[54:55] THE CALENDAR convince us that there's
[54:57] SOME SORT OF POWER IN THAT. BUT THERE'S
[54:59] NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE AGING the same today
[55:01] as you were three days ago or four days
[55:04] ago or a year and four days ago.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. All it's doing is reminding us.
[55:11] And that's what Moses's whole point is.
[55:12] Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; This this new year, it just reminds us
[55:15] that the situation's bad. And then we
[55:17] just, well, I'll fix it in a few days.
[55:19] And it doesn't it it reminds me in the
[55:21] book of Acts about Felix. Amen. In the
[55:23] book of Acts, Paul's taken prisoner and
[55:24] he goes to Felix and and Felix has him
[55:26] there. And the Bible says this, after
[55:28] certain days, Felix came with his wife,
[55:29] Dusilla, and they they called Paul and
[55:31] they wanted to hear what Paul had to
[55:33] say. And the Bible, I love this. The
[55:34] Bible says this as Paul reasoned with
[55:36] them out of righteousness and temperance
[55:38] and judgment TO COME. FELIX TREMBLED AND
[55:40] HE SAYS THIS, "GO THY WAY AND I'LL CALL
[55:42] FOR YOU AGAIN IN A CONVENIENT SEASON."
[55:46] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, I I I'M HEARING WHAT
[55:47] YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M NOT DISBELIEVING
[55:50] YOU, BUT IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD TIME. IT'S
[55:52] NOT CONVENIENT. I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN WHEN
[55:54] IT'S COME. NOW, THE BIBLE tells us a
[55:56] couple things after this. He was hoping
[55:58] to get a bribe. So really, he wasn't
[56:00] actually interested in what Paul said as
[56:02] much, but he's hoping to get some money
[56:04] for it. But the Bible TELLS US THIS.
[56:05] AFTER TWO YEARS, FESUS SHOWS UP. TWO
[56:08] YEARS LATER, HE SHOWS UP AND FELIX LIKE,
[56:10] "OH, I GOT THIS GUY." SOMEWHERE IN THAT
[56:13] 2-YEAR PERIOD, HE NEVER FOUND A
[56:15] CONVENIENT SEASON.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, WE'LL WAIT
[56:19] FOR A CONVENIENT SEASON TO DO THINGS.
[56:22] AMEN. WELL, I NEED I KNOW I NEED TO BE
[56:24] IN CHURCH. AND I KNOW I NEED TO BE
[56:25] LISTENING TO THE TAPES AND I KNOW I NEED
[56:26] TO BE HEARING WHAT A PROPHET SAYS, BUT
[56:28] LISTEN, IT'S JUST A BUSY TIME OF LIFE
[56:30] FOR ME AND I'LL GET AROUND TO IT
[56:31] EVENTUALLY. IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE
[56:33] CONVENIENT.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A
[56:37] CONVENIENT TIME TO SERVE GOD, YOU'RE
[56:39] NEVER GOING TO FIND IT.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CONVENIENT TIME TO
[56:43] MAKE YOUR LIFE RIGHT, YOU'RE NEVER GOING
[56:45] TO FIND IT. RIGHT?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE DO THAT WITH WELL LISTEN. WELL,
[56:48] WHEN I GET MY LIFE AND I, YOU KNOW, WHEN
[56:50] I HAVE $400,000 IN THE BANK AND I'VE GOT
[56:52] THE THEN I'LL GO HAVE KIDS WHEN IT'S
[56:54] CONVENIENT. LISTEN, KIDS ARE NOT
[56:55] CONVENIENT. SORRY, KIDS.
[56:58] THAT'S NOT WHY YOU HAVE THEM. YOU DON'T
[56:59] HAVE THEM FOR FUN, FOR A LUXURY. THERE'S
[57:02] A RESPONSIBILITY THERE. AMEN. AND WE DO
[57:05] THIS. WE RATIONALIZE. WELL, LISTEN. I
[57:07] I'M WAITING ON THE TIMING OF THE LORD TO
[57:10] DO THE THING THAT GOD TOLD ME TO DO FIVE
[57:11] YEARS AGO.
[57:14] AS IF SOMEHOW WE HAD AN IN AN EXCUSE FOR
[57:18] OUR INACTIVITY, THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR
[57:19] IT. AMEN.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; IF IT DOESN'T COMPEL YOU TO DO IT NOW,
[57:23] WHY WOULD IT COMPEL YOU TO DO IT LATER?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, this is the thing. Our human
[57:27] will is such a pervasive THING. OUR OUR
[57:29] WILL HAS A A WAY OF INFECTING EVEN A A
[57:32] GOOD MOTIVE, A GOOD OBJECTIVE. AMEN. WE
[57:34] CAN TAKE THINGS THAT GOD ORDAINED AND WE
[57:37] CAN SUBVERT IT FOR our own will. Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord, somebody. We'll
[57:42] rationalize our behavior. We'll
[57:44] rationalize our decisions. Amen. And
[57:45] when I talk about the pervasiveness,
[57:46] what I'm saying is we don't even realize
[57:48] we're doing it sometimes.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE WE'VE GOT SUCH A WAY OF
[57:52] RATIONALIZING OUR SITUATION. WE CAN LOOK
[57:54] AT EVERYBODY ELSE. WELL, LISTEN, they
[57:56] know better than that. Well, so do you.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME. I'VE
[58:03] GOT AN UNDERSTANDING WITH GOD. OH,
[58:06] SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM. I DIDN'T
[58:07] REALIZE YOU GOT A SPECIAL MEMO FROM
[58:10] HEAVEN. YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE. IT'S A GOD'S
[58:13] LIKE, "MAN, I REALLY I NEED YOU IN THE
[58:15] KINGDOM SO BAD. I'M GOING TO LET YOU
[58:17] CIRCUMVENT my will to do it."
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Now, that sounds, but we'll DO IT IF
[58:21] WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. WELL, LISTEN. IT'S
[58:22] DIFFERENT FOR ME. IT'S NOT DIFFERENT FOR
[58:24] YOU OR ME or anybody else.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; But we'll make excuses.
[58:29] Excuses on the day of judgment. Amen.
[58:32] So, our will, IT'S SO STRONG. WE WE SO
[58:34] DESIRE, AMEN, TO HAVE THINGS OUR WAY.
[58:36] AMEN. And I always use this example. If
[58:38] you don't believe that, just wait till
[58:39] the next time you order fast food and
[58:40] they make it wrong. Amen. It's like
[58:42] brother Steven. He he hates tomatoes on
[58:44] his tacos. I can pick on him because you
[58:46] all know about how much he LOVES TACO
[58:48] BELL. HE HATES TOMATOES ON HIS TACOS.
[58:49] AMEN. NOW IMAGINE YOU DON'T LIKE
[58:51] TOMATOES IN YOUR TACOS AND YOU GO TO
[58:52] TACO Bell and you say, "I WANT SIX TACOS
[58:54] AND I DON'T WANT TOMATOES IN THEM." And
[58:55] they put tomatoes on one of them. And
[58:57] you know what you're going to do? You're
[58:58] going to march in there and YOU'RE GOING
[58:59] TO THROW YOUR BAG ON THE COUNTER.
[59:01] YOU MADE THIS WRONG. I SAID NO TOMATOES
[59:04] AND I DON'T HAVE the time to pick them
[59:05] off, but you got the time to make a new
[59:07] one. LISTEN, I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS
[59:11] AND I WANT IT DONE RIGHT. IT'S THE
[59:13] PRINCIPAL. I, YOU KNOW, I DESERVE WHAT I
[59:17] PAID FOR AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
[59:19] GOOD AND FINE, BUT AS SOON AS WE'RE ON
[59:20] OUR WAY TO WORK AND we're in a big hurry
[59:21] and we don't HAVE TIME, WE SUDDENLY JUST
[59:23] I'LL JUST PICK THEM OFF AND GO. IT'S NOT
[59:26] CONVENIENT TO COMPLAIN ANYMORE. I DON'T
[59:28] HAVE TIME TO. SO, IF LISTEN, IF IT'S THE
[59:30] PRINCIPLE, IF IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,
[59:32] AMEN. THEN IF YOU'RE RUNNING FIVE
[59:34] MINUTES BEHIND, IT DOESN'T MATTER CUZ
[59:36] YOU'RE GOING IN THERE AND YOU'RE
[59:38] COMPLAINING TO THEM THAT THEY MADE IT
[59:40] WRONG BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT'S
[59:41] CONVENIENT. IT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG.
[59:44] THIS IS WRONG. THIS IS IMMORAL.
[59:46] [screaming]
[59:47] THE OUTRAGE THAT THEY WOULD MESS with
[59:50] now. That's ridiculous.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; But I've seen people probably none of
[59:54] you here and THAT'S JUST ABOUT HOW
[59:56] THEY'LL GET. AMEN. GOOD CHRISTIAN
[59:58] PEOPLE. BUT AS SOON AS SOMETHING DON'T
[1:00:00] GO THEIR WAY, BOY, THEY'RE IN YOUR FACE
[1:00:02] LETTING YOU KNOW.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN. YOU MESSED THIS UP AND YOU
[1:00:06] SAID AN A WHEN THERE WAS A DUH.
[1:00:09] AND YOU DIDN'T LIKE THIS AND YOU DIDN'T
[1:00:11] SING MY FAVORITE SONG AND YOU DIDN'T
[1:00:12] PLAY WITH MY PET DOCTRINE AND YOU MESSED
[1:00:14] THIS UP AND YOU MESSED THAT UP. AND I'M
[1:00:16] NOT TALKING ABOUT HERESY. I'M NOT
[1:00:18] TALKING ABOUT BLASPHEMY. I'M TALKING
[1:00:20] ABOUT SOMETHING THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO
[1:00:21] REMEMBER IN A HUNDRED YEARS. YEAH.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; AND WE WILL FIGHT AND WE WILL LOSE SLEEP
[1:00:27] AND WE WILL ARGUE AND WE'LL BREAK
[1:00:29] FRIENDSHIPS AND WE'LL DESTROY FAMILIES
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; over our because we want it to be our
[1:00:34] way. Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; It's not about right or wrong. It's
[1:00:39] really about our will and WE'RE JUST
[1:00:41] USING THE BIBLE TO JUSTIFY WHAT WE'RE
[1:00:44] DOING.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; WELL, I've never done that before. I'm
[1:00:48] sure none of you have either, but
[1:00:49] they're out there somewhere.
[1:00:51] [laughter]
[1:00:53] Amen. I may I better get off that real
[1:00:54] quick because I'm going to go to lunch
[1:00:55] and they're going to mess my food up
[1:00:56] like a
[1:00:59] point. Amen. It's not really the
[1:01:01] principle most of the times. It's not
[1:01:02] really a moral issue. It's our will.
[1:01:06] We want things a certain way. And if we
[1:01:08] can't get it our way, we'll leverage
[1:01:10] them however we can. We'll even use the
[1:01:11] Bible to do it. Amen. It's just like the
[1:01:14] Pharisees that saw Jesus and his
[1:01:15] disciples gleaning food one day and they
[1:01:17] said, "WELL, LISTEN. YOU GUYS SHOULDN'T
[1:01:18] YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ON THE
[1:01:19] SABBATH." NOW, THEY WEREN'T WORRIED
[1:01:20] ABOUT THAT FARMER'S CROP that year. They
[1:01:23] just didn't LIKE JESUS.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S ALL IT WAS. THEY JUST DIDN'T LIKE
[1:01:27] JESUS. SO, NOW SUDDENLY, WE CARE ABOUT
[1:01:29] THE SABBATH.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; NO, IT'S A BIG DEAL. AND JESUS SAID,
[1:01:32] "LISTEN, IF YOU HAD KNOWN WHAT IT MEANS
[1:01:34] I DESIRED MERCY AND NOT SACRIFICE, YOU
[1:01:37] WOULD NOT HAVE CONDEMNED the guiltless."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; SEE WHAT WE DO? WE START condemning
[1:01:42] people that didn't do anything wrong.
[1:01:43] actually
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; never hurt you, never did nothing to
[1:01:45] you, but you'll condemn them cuz you
[1:01:47] just don't like them
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; for whatever reason.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; MAN, I THOUGHT WE'D all love this. I
[1:01:53] figured you were the ones on the
[1:01:54] receiving END OF PERSECUTION.
[1:01:57] GLORY TO GOD. I WAS RIGHT THE WHOLE
[1:01:58] TIME.
[1:02:00] [laughter]
[1:02:03] I was talking about this poem. I forget
[1:02:04] the name of the guy that writes.
[1:02:07] I don't know anybody's ever heard it.
[1:02:08] It's about Ramsy's. Azimus is the Latin
[1:02:10] name for Ramsies. It talks about they
[1:02:12] come in the desert to this great statue
[1:02:14] of his and the face is on the ground,
[1:02:16] this snarling visage and his feet the
[1:02:18] THE STATUE'S ALMOST GONE. IT'S JUST IN
[1:02:19] THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. And he makes
[1:02:20] this point. IT'S THERE'S A PLAQUE ON THE
[1:02:22] STATUE of Azimus or or Ramsy's. And it
[1:02:25] says it says several different things,
[1:02:26] but he says, "BEHOLD MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY
[1:02:29] IN DESPAIR." WHAT WORKS? It's all gone.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] all those big important things that he
[1:02:37] thought were important in his life, the
[1:02:39] what when you get down to it, it didn't
[1:02:41] really matter that much. Amen.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; And so it's it's nothing most of the
[1:02:45] time. The things that we lose sleep over
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; the things that we strive we'll strive
[1:02:50] with the wind and we'll fight about
[1:02:51] things that don't really matter. Well,
[1:02:52] praise the Lord.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; It'll help somebody. I don't even know
[1:02:55] help you. AMEN. WE'RE WE'LL STRIVE ABOUT
[1:02:58] THINGS. LISTEN, YOU THINK OF MY my my
[1:03:00] mom gave me this book years ago. It's
[1:03:02] our family's genealogy. You know how
[1:03:04] many times I've opened that book? I
[1:03:05] think I opened it once because I I put
[1:03:07] something in it and I had opened a
[1:03:09] second time to get out. I bookmarked
[1:03:11] this thing I was supposed to read and
[1:03:12] then I'm like, "Well, I'm bookmark
[1:03:13] back." Amen. I don't know my great great
[1:03:16] grandparents' names. Amen. I don't
[1:03:19] remember all their names. Amen. It's
[1:03:20] amazing because people do ancestry stuff
[1:03:22] and they find out, "Oh man, ABRAHAM
[1:03:24] LINCOLN'S IN MY GENEALOGY." WELL, MAN,
[1:03:26] YEAH, THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT GUY.
[1:03:28] AMEN. AND HEY, IF YOU GOT A Lincoln for
[1:03:31] an ancestor, kudos to you cuz I don't
[1:03:33] even want to tell you what I got.
[1:03:36] BUT WELL, MAN, THIS [screaming] VERY
[1:03:38] IMPORTANT PERSON IS IN MY FAMILY
[1:03:42] GENEALOGY. AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW? LIKE I
[1:03:44] FEEL LIKE BEFORE GRANDPA PASSES AWAY, BY
[1:03:48] THE WAY, GRANDSON, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
[1:03:52] YOU'RE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S GREAT GREAT
[1:03:54] GREAT. WOW,
[1:03:56] THAT'S AWESOME. [screaming]
[1:03:58] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES FOR ME. IT'S
[1:04:00] NOT GOING TO GET ME INTO COLLEGE OR
[1:04:02] [screaming] JOB. BUT THAT'S GREAT. SEE
[1:04:04] WHAT I'M I'M GETTING A POINT OUT HERE.
[1:04:05] AMEN.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE GET SO WOR I I
[1:04:09] I TRY TO ASK myself this question. Is is
[1:04:12] anybody going to care a 100 years from
[1:04:14] now about this minor inconvenience in MY
[1:04:17] LIFE THAT I THOUGHT WAS A BIG DEAL, BUT
[1:04:19] IT WASN'T REALLY A BIG DEAL
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE ALL THAT STUFF'S GOING TO PASS
[1:04:23] AWAY.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IN THE GRAND CALCULUS OF THINGS,
[1:04:28] MOST OF THE THINGS WE GET UPSET ABOUT
[1:04:29] AND MOST OF THE THINGS WE LET TROUBLE US
[1:04:32] VERY LIKELY WILL BE FORGOTTEN. YOU MIGHT
[1:04:34] FORGET ABOUT THEM WHILE YOU'RE ALIVE.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS EARTH SHATTERING EVENTS, I
[1:04:40] CAN'T GET OVER.
[1:04:42] WHO CARES?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I'm saying this for A REASON.
[1:04:48] THAT PERSON THAT YOU GO AND YOU TELL
[1:04:50] OFF, you go do this to, AND YOU LISTEN,
[1:04:52] YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY BIBLE THEY ever
[1:04:54] read. YOU MIGHT BE THE ONLY CHANCE THEY
[1:04:57] HAVE FOR SOMETHING ETERNAL.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And how ARE WE PRESENTING THE GOSPEL IN
[1:05:01] OUR LIVES?
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're not LOOKING AT THE
[1:05:04] IMPORTANT THING. We're looking at our
[1:05:05] problem, OUR TRIAL, OUR WILL. WE'RE NOT
[1:05:07] LOOKING AT A SOUL. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT
[1:05:09] OUR TESTIMONY. WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE
[1:05:11] ONE THING THAT'S GOING TO MATTER WHEN
[1:05:14] TIME HAS CEASED TO BE.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; WELL, I've done it once or twice. See,
[1:05:18] confession is good for the soul. AMEN.
[1:05:20] I'VE DONE IT ONCE OR TWICE. AMEN.
[1:05:22] [screaming] WE MAKE THIS BIG DEAL. IT'S
[1:05:24] NOT A BIG DEAL.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; WELL, here's a hot take. I really like
[1:05:29] this one. Amen. Well, listen. This
[1:05:31] person, they offend. Let me just say
[1:05:33] this. As as a traveling minister, I run
[1:05:35] into people all the time and and and and
[1:05:37] things. You know, they'll they come up
[1:05:39] to you and you ASK THEM, "GOD BLESS YOU.
[1:05:41] HOW YOU DOING?" AND THE FIRST THING THEY
[1:05:43] DO, THEY START TELLING YOU ABOUT 30
[1:05:44] years ago WHEN THEY WENT THROUGH THIS
[1:05:46] THING and this person hurt them and this
[1:05:49] happened to them AT THE CHURCH AND THIS
[1:05:50] HAPPENED TO THEM THERE AND THIS happened
[1:05:51] to them. THEY WERE MR. AND YOU'RE JUST
[1:05:52] LIKE, "MAN, I MET TODAY. HOW ARE YOU
[1:05:54] DOING? NOT WHAT ARE YOU CARING? AND AND
[1:05:56] AND WHAT'S SAD? WHAT'S SAD? OKAY, I'M
[1:05:59] not trying TO MAKE FUN, BUT WHAT'S SAD
[1:06:00] IS YOU COME TO THEM A YEAR LATER AND YOU
[1:06:02] ASK THEM AND IT'S THE SAME STORY.
[1:06:03] THEY'RE STILL LIVING BACK THERE. THEY'RE
[1:06:05] STILL HURT. THEY'RE STILL OFFENDED. AND
[1:06:07] ALL THAT HAS DONE IS LIVED RENTREE in
[1:06:09] their head. IT HAS RULED THEIR LIFE.
[1:06:11] IT'S RULED THEIR THINKING. AND IT HAS NO
[1:06:13] RIGHT TO DO THAT. AMEN. YOU GAVE IT THE
[1:06:15] RIGHT.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; GOD DIDN'T DO THAT. YOU HELD ON TO THIS
[1:06:18] THING THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO CARE ABOUT.
[1:06:20] THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE IT INTO
[1:06:21] ETERNITY. AND WE'LL LET THAT RULE OUR
[1:06:23] LIVES AND DOMINATE OUR LIVES AND AFFECT
[1:06:25] OUR LIVES AND WE'LL FORGET THAT THAT
[1:06:26] PERSON HAS A SOUL.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES BROTHER SAID SOMEBODY
[1:06:30] OFFENDS YOU, YOU GO PRAY FOR THAT PERSON
[1:06:32] AND YOU GO BEFORE THE THRONE AND NOT IN
[1:06:34] A SORT OF WELL I HAVE TO DO IT SORT OF
[1:06:36] WAY BUT YOU START PRAYING FOR THEM AND
[1:06:38] WHEN YOU GET THERE IN THE PRINCE OF GOD,
[1:06:40] YOU CAN'T CONDEMN ANOTHER MORTAL MAN and
[1:06:42] you GET IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND YOU
[1:06:43] BEGIN TO SEE WHERE THE DEVIL MESSED HIM
[1:06:45] UP SOMEWHERE LIKE HE HAS SOME OF US
[1:06:47] SOMETIME. HE JUST GOT MESSED UP
[1:06:49] SOMEWHERE. BUT THE PERSON SAID, "YOU'LL
[1:06:50] COME BACK FEELING SORRY FOR THAT
[1:06:52] PERSON."
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; WE'RE SO LOOKING AT THE OFFENSE AND WE
[1:06:58] MISS WHAT'S THE what's the reason behind
[1:07:00] it. Amen. So here's a hot take.
[1:07:02] Sometimes God lets THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU.
[1:07:03] LIKE WHY'D THAT HAPPEN? Maybe God wanted
[1:07:04] it to happen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, you better get mad at God now. I
[1:07:08] guess MAYBE THE LORD WANTED THAT TO
[1:07:10] HAPPEN. YOU SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
[1:07:11] ABOUT?" AMEN. LISTEN, BROTHER BEN, ONE
[1:07:13] TIME HE, you know, he was in trouble
[1:07:14] with the IRS because of the way, you
[1:07:16] know, because he wasn't a shyer. It's
[1:07:19] funny if you'd have been a if he'd been
[1:07:20] a swindler, he probably gotten away with
[1:07:22] it. But he was giving money to people
[1:07:23] that actually needed it, not hoarding it
[1:07:25] to himself, and he got in trouble. Go
[1:07:26] figure.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; That's your government in action.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; We'll punish the guiltless
[1:07:32] and we'll let the guilty go free. Well,
[1:07:34] anyway, I'm not here to make political
[1:07:35] statements today, BUT
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HERE HE IS GIVING THE MONEY
[1:07:38] AWAY, NOT KEEPING TRACK OF IT. YOUR LEFT
[1:07:41] HAND SHOULDN'T. HE DIDN'T WANT CREDIT
[1:07:42] FOR IT AND SO HE GOT IN TROUBLE WITH THE
[1:07:44] IRS AND HE HE HE THOUGHT HE WAS DONE
[1:07:46] WITH IT. BROTHER tells a story. He said
[1:07:47] that he got a he got a check one day and
[1:07:49] he ran to Billy Paul said, "Billy Paul,
[1:07:51] can I can I cash this check or am I get
[1:07:52] in trouble for it?" And he said, "Billy
[1:07:54] Paul took it about four different guys.
[1:07:55] I just for the sake of time shortening
[1:07:56] it up here, but he took it about four
[1:07:58] different guys and they're like, "Yeah,
[1:07:59] it's okay. Yeah, it's okay. You can cash
[1:08:01] that." Amen. So after that, BROTHER BEN
[1:08:03] GOES, HE TAKES THAT CHECK AND HE CASHES
[1:08:05] IT AND RIGHT AWAY THE tax agent gets a
[1:08:07] hold of him. Well, I believe we're going
[1:08:08] to reopen the case. Right. That's right.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; What a jerk. [laughter]
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The tax agent's like, "WE'RE GOING TO
[1:08:16] REOPEN THE CASE." AND SO, BROTHER RAMY'S
[1:08:18] TALKING TO BROTHER LEE AND BROTHER
[1:08:19] BRAMY'S JUST TELLING him about it and
[1:08:21] he's NOT UPSET. AND LE SAYS, HE SAYS,
[1:08:23] "HOW DO YOU LET PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU
[1:08:25] LIKE THAT?"
[1:08:27] AMEN. HOW can you LET PEOPLE MISTREAT
[1:08:29] YOU THAT HOW CAN YOU LET PEOPLE TALK
[1:08:31] ABOUT YOU LIKE THAT? AND BROTHER BRANDON
[1:08:32] SAID, "NOW, DON'T FLY LOOSE ALL AT
[1:08:34] ONCE."
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; That's for SOMEBODY TODAY. DON'T FLY
[1:08:37] LOOSE ALL AT ONCE. AMEN. HE SAID, "BE
[1:08:40] STILL." HE SAID, "GOD IS THE ONE DOING
[1:08:42] THAT."
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; And it reminds ME OF THE STORY, BROTHER
[1:08:45] TALKS ABOUT THE STORY IN THE BIBLE WHEN
[1:08:47] DAVID'S OWN SON ABSELUM, WHEN HE SEEKS
[1:08:50] TO DEPOSE HIM FROM THE THRONE AND TAKE
[1:08:52] HIS KINGDOM, HE COMES AND TAKE HIS
[1:08:54] CONCUBINES, KICKS HIM OUT OF THE CASTLE,
[1:08:56] AND DAVID'S ON THE RUN, HE'S GOT SOME
[1:08:58] MEN WITH HIM. HE'S HE'S ON THE RUN FOR
[1:08:59] HIS LIFE. AMEN. AND THE BIBLE TELLS THE
[1:09:01] STORY AS HE'S GOING OUT THERE, THERE'S A
[1:09:03] MAN FROM THE TRIBE OF BENJAMIN. HE'S
[1:09:05] HE'S SAUL'S RELATION, KING SAUL'S
[1:09:06] RELATION. AND HE SEES DAVID LEAVING AND
[1:09:09] HE'S HEADING OUT IN THE WHICHEVER WAY
[1:09:10] HE'S GOING. AND THIS MAN SEES DAVID AND
[1:09:13] HE BEGINS TO THROW ROCKS AT HIM AND TO
[1:09:15] CURSE HIM. AND HE SAYS, "COME OUT YOU
[1:09:16] BLOODY MAN. YOU YOU MAN OF BILE." AND HE
[1:09:19] BEGINS TO MOCK HIM. AND ABASHAI, ONE OF
[1:09:21] DAVID'S MIGHTY MEN, HE SAID, "WHY SHOULD
[1:09:24] THIS DEAD DOG CURSE MY KING? LET ME TAKE
[1:09:27] HIS HEAD."
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; BUT I LOVE HOW DAVID HANDLES IT. HE
[1:09:30] SAYS, "NOW LISTEN, MY OWN SON SEEKS MY
[1:09:34] LIFE. WHAT MORE CAN THIS man do to me?
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THE DEVIL IN THE WORLD AND LATER
[1:09:40] TO SEE HER AFTER ME AND I'M GOING TO GET
[1:09:42] OFFENDED BECAUSE HE SAID SOME mean words
[1:09:44] to me.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HELP ME OUT SOMEBODY. MY SON'S
[1:09:49] TRYING TO KILL ME AND I'M GOING TO WORRY
[1:09:50] ABOUT THIS. HE SAID, "LET HIM CURSE ME.
[1:09:54] THE LORD TOLD [screaming] HIM TO DO
[1:09:56] THAT." Oh my.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Well, THAT'S JUST THE DEVIL. AND THE
[1:10:02] DEVIL. NO, MAYBE GOD WANTS THAT PERSON
[1:10:03] TO DO THAT TO YOU.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I I THIS IS WHAT I LOVE ABOUT
[1:10:06] THIS. WHY WHY WOULD GOD LET THAT HAPPEN?
[1:10:09] WHY WOULD GOD DO THAT? BECAUSE HE WANTS
[1:10:10] TO SEE HOW DAVID'S GOING TO RESPOND.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET HIM DO THAT. GOD TOLD HIM TO
[1:10:16] DO IT. HE SAYS, "IT MAY BE." HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:18] IT MAY BE. THE LORD WILL LOOK UPON MY
[1:10:20] AFFLICTION AND THE LORD WILL REQUITE ME
[1:10:24] GOOD.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT AN OBSTACLE.
[1:10:27] THIS IS MY CHANCE TO BE A BIGGER PERSON
[1:10:30] AND KNOW THAT IF I BEAR LISTEN, IT'S
[1:10:32] LIKE PETER SAID, IF IF YOU'RE REPROACHED
[1:10:34] FOR YOUR FAULTS, THAT'S NOT SPECIAL.
[1:10:37] BUT WHEN YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, WHEN
[1:10:39] YOU WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DON'T DESERVE IT
[1:10:41] AND YOU'RE IT'S JUST LIKE CHRIST WHEN
[1:10:42] THEY CALL YOU NAMES, THEY RIDICULE YOU,
[1:10:44] THEY PUT YOU DOWN, AND YOU BEAR IT
[1:10:46] PATIENTLY AND YOU PRAY FOR THEM. AMEN.
[1:10:49] NOT JUST AS AN OBLIGATION, BUT YOU
[1:10:51] UNDERSTAND, LISTEN, I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:10:52] FIGHT MY OWN BATTLES. THE BATTLE BELONGS
[1:10:55] TO THE LORD. AMEN. I'M GOING TO TREAT
[1:10:57] THEM HOW A CHRISTIAN SHOULD TREAT HIM.
[1:10:59] AND GOD, [screaming]
[1:11:00] THAT MAN'S NOT GOING TO DO IT, BUT GOD
[1:11:02] WILL REQUITE ME GOOD.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, LOTS OF TIMES GOD WILL
[1:11:06] PUT YOU IN A situation with somebody
[1:11:08] that's hostile, somebody that's
[1:11:10] whatever, CUZ HE HE'S NOT DOING IT for
[1:11:12] their sakes. He's doing to see how
[1:11:13] you're going to respond.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; AND YOUR RESPONSE WILL DICTATE what kind
[1:11:20] of a blessing you get.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing ME NOW? SOMETIMES GOD
[1:11:23] WILL LET BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU AND
[1:11:25] WE'LL BLAME SOMEBODY AND WE'LL GET
[1:11:27] DISRESPECTED. We'll get upset. We blame
[1:11:29] the devil. All this stuff. WELL, YOU
[1:11:31] KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOMEBODY
[1:11:32] DISRESPECT ME LIKE THAT. I respect those
[1:11:36] who respect me. Well, show me that in
[1:11:38] the Bible.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's not how David acted.
[1:11:43] Thank God that guy would have got his
[1:11:44] head cut off if he did. AMEN. THAT'S NOT
[1:11:48] HOW THE BIBLE THE BIBLE SAYS WHEN YOU'RE
[1:11:49] REVILED, YOU BLESS THEM BACK.
[1:11:53] OH MAN, I thought this was a shouting
[1:11:55] service. Well, praise God.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Let me just I I I always feel the need
[1:12:00] to throw this in. I don't know why.
[1:12:03] I'll just say this because I know guys
[1:12:05] like this. Well, you you need to respect
[1:12:06] me. Never in the history of demanding
[1:12:08] that people respect you do people ever
[1:12:10] respect you. You ever notice that?
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; It's like telling somebody, it's like if
[1:12:13] my wife was, this is theoretical. IF MY
[1:12:15] WIFE WAS UPSET AND I said, "Listen, YOU
[1:12:18] NEED TO CALM DOWN." GUESS WHAT? SHE
[1:12:20] DIDN'T CALM DOWN FROM THAT. IT DIDN'T
[1:12:22] HAVE ANY POWER. IT PROBABLY DID THE
[1:12:24] OPPOSITE. AMEN. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF
[1:12:26] TELLING SOMEBODY TO CALM DOWN DID IT
[1:12:28] MAKE THEM CALM DOWN.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. WELL, LISTEN. YOU NEED TO LISTEN.
[1:12:32] IF YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE YOU NEED TO
[1:12:34] RESPECT, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
[1:12:36] GET IT.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T COMMAND RESPECT. YOU
[1:12:40] OR YOU DON'T DEMAND IT. YOU COMMAND IT.
[1:12:42] AMEN. In other words, you live in a
[1:12:44] certain. It's like brother Bam SAID, A
[1:12:45] WOMAN SHOULD REVERENCE HER HUSBAND LIKE
[1:12:47] SHE SHOULD THE LORD. ALL THE BROTHERS
[1:12:49] GO, "AMEN." THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT
[1:12:51] THE BIBLE SAYS. YOU NEED TO REVERENCE ME
[1:12:54] THE WAY YOU REVERENCE GOD. AND THAT'S
[1:12:55] TRUE. AND THEN, BROTHER BEN, THE NEXT
[1:12:57] SENTENCE SAYS THAT AND A MAN, IF HE
[1:12:59] WANTS TO BE REVERENT, should live in a
[1:13:00] way. Oh my.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Well, here we go. Man, I'M A LITTLE BIT
[1:13:04] LIGHTER AFTER ALL. I HAVEN'T DONE this
[1:13:06] in A WHILE. THEN YOU BETTER LIVE IN A
[1:13:10] WAY THAT DESERVES BEING REVERENCED.
[1:13:12] AMEN. DON'T GET UP THERE WITH YOUR BIG
[1:13:14] BABY ATTITUDE AND ACT LIKE AN OVERGROWN,
[1:13:16] SPOILED CHILD AND DEMAND YOUR WIFE
[1:13:18] REVERENCE YOU WHEN YOU ACT LIKE A 12Y
[1:13:20] OLD.
[1:13:22] [laughter]
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO DO THIS AND I'M GOING
[1:13:25] TO DO THAT AND I'M GOING TO MAKE HER.
[1:13:27] SHE'S, YOU KNOW, they say you marry your
[1:13:28] mom. That's about what some guys DO.
[1:13:30] AMEN. THEY'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A
[1:13:31] GLORIFIED MOM TO CLEAN UP AFTER TAKE
[1:13:33] CARE OF THEM WHILE THEY DO EVERY KIND OF
[1:13:34] IRRESPONSIBLE THING JUST LIKE THEY WERE
[1:13:36] A KID.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; They want somebody to enable them. And
[1:13:39] you just CALL THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT'S
[1:13:41] not righteousness. You're just Oh,
[1:13:42] praise God. Here we are. WHEN SOMEBODY
[1:13:45] ELSE WATCHES THIS OUT ON THE AIRWAVES.
[1:13:48] [laughter]
[1:13:50] WELL, glory to God. Listen, this guy
[1:13:53] didn't think DAVID WAS A GOOD KING. AND
[1:13:55] YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S NOT UP TO THAT GUY.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; It's not even really UP TO DAVID. YOU
[1:14:00] KNOW WHAT DAVID SAID? I'M GOING TO LET
[1:14:01] the Lord decide.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to LET THE LORD DECIDE in this
[1:14:05] situation. AMEN. REMEMBER, GOD LOVES TO
[1:14:08] TEST HIS CHILDREN. GOD'S children don't
[1:14:09] love to test God's children. Well, some
[1:14:10] of you love to test other children, BUT
[1:14:14] WE DON'T LIKE BEING TESTED, BUT GOD
[1:14:15] LOVES IT. CAN YOU IMAGINE? I'LL JUST SAY
[1:14:17] THIS real quick. Can you imagine picking
[1:14:18] up this Bible and YOU READ HERE, "ADAM
[1:14:21] WAS BLESSED AND HAD eternal life and
[1:14:22] nothing ever went wrong." Amen. That's a
[1:14:25] really GOOD STORY. IT'S BORING AS CAN
[1:14:27] BE. [laughter]
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; NO. WHY? IF YOU READ IT ONCE, YOU READ
[1:14:32] IT A HUNDRED TIMES.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS THAT COME
[1:14:36] IN OUR LIFE, AMEN. THEY'RE A REMINDER to
[1:14:39] us.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we focus on the wrong things.
[1:14:44] Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; We get caught up in it. Amen. And
[1:14:47] somebody will criticize us because God's
[1:14:49] wanting to see how we're going to handle
[1:14:50] it. You say, "Well, that guy's just got
[1:14:52] the devil in." Maybe you deserved it.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; There's a thought. You ever have you
[1:14:55] ever been criticized and you deserved
[1:14:57] it? I was one time. I think uh if I
[1:15:00] think back [laughter]
[1:15:01] it was years ago.
[1:15:04] Sometimes you deserve it AND THEN YOU
[1:15:06] STILL FIGHT WITH IT.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO LISTEN. SOMETIMES GOD
[1:15:10] will anoint your pastor to say I can say
[1:15:12] this cuz he's not here.
[1:15:15] Sometimes God will anoint your pastor to
[1:15:17] say SOMETHING AND HE MIGHT NOT BE SAYING
[1:15:19] SOMETHING WRONG, BUT HE'LL SAY IN A WAY
[1:15:20] THAT YOU DON'T LIKE.
[1:15:23] AMEN. JUST TO SEE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
[1:15:25] ACT ABOUT IT. AMEN. ARE YOU GOING TO GET
[1:15:27] PUFFED UP AND ALL MAD? WHY NOT MEAN? I'M
[1:15:29] NOT DOING THIS EVER AGAIN. THAT MAN. AND
[1:15:31] BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU CAN'T GO
[1:15:32] ANYWHERE. YOU can't trust anybody. You
[1:15:34] can't listen to anybody. And most of
[1:15:35] it's just you.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes God will have a man say
[1:15:43] something like that that you don't like
[1:15:44] just to see how you're going to act
[1:15:46] about it.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THAT. GOD TAILOR MAKES AN
[1:15:48] offense just for you. [laughter]
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord, SOMEBODY.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMETIMES GOD WILL HAVE YOUR LEAST
[1:15:56] favorite preacher. Perhaps today's THE
[1:15:58] DAY. HAVE YOUR FAVORITE your least
[1:16:01] favorite preacher come and preach just
[1:16:03] to see how you're going to act about it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this again with traveling
[1:16:09] things. There's there's many times, not
[1:16:11] here, praise God, but commonly I'll go
[1:16:13] to different places and stuff and
[1:16:15] sometimes people come up to me and they
[1:16:16] they complain, well, this thing's going
[1:16:17] on at this church over here or this is
[1:16:19] and you know how it is. They're like,
[1:16:20] they got to let you know, hey, brother,
[1:16:21] this is really important. you need to
[1:16:22] know this. This church that you know
[1:16:24] have any dealings with and you don't
[1:16:26] know anybody, but listen, this is you
[1:16:28] know what they and they sit there and
[1:16:30] THEY'RE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT TO YOU. THEY
[1:16:32] COMPLAIN ABOUT IT AND THEY'RE LIKE,
[1:16:33] "WELL, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY GOD WOULD
[1:16:35] LET SOMETHING like that go on." WELL, I
[1:16:37] DON'T EITHER, BUT I KNOW ONE THING
[1:16:38] YOU'RE PROBABLY A LOT MORE WORRIED about
[1:16:39] than God is. [laughter]
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU'RE A LOT MORE
[1:16:43] WORRIED ABOUT THAN GOD IS. AMEN. LISTEN,
[1:16:46] GOD HAS ALLOWED KINGDOMS
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; IN THE YOU READ IN THE OLD TESTAMENT. HE
[1:16:50] ALLOWS THEM TO GO THE WRONG WAY ALL
[1:16:52] [screaming] THE TIME.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; WHY DOES GOD LET THIS GO ON? MAYBE TO
[1:16:56] SEE HOW ELIJAH'S GOING TO ACT.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW HOW AHAB'S GOING TO ACT. WE KNOW
[1:17:01] HOW JEZEBEL'S GOING TO ACT. BUT ELIJAH,
[1:17:02] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ACT LIKE?
[1:17:04] [screaming] OH, JUST LET ME DIE. THERE'S
[1:17:05] NO ONE THAT WANTS TO SERVE YOU. HE'S
[1:17:07] WANTING TO SEE HOW YOU ACT. GOD WILL
[1:17:09] TAKE WHOLE NATIONS AND WHOLE KINGDOMS
[1:17:11] AND WHOLE CHURCHES SOMETIMES AND HE'LL
[1:17:13] HAVE HE'LL ALLOW THEM TO GO A CERTAIN
[1:17:15] WAY JUST TO SEE HOW ONE PERSON WILL ACT
[1:17:18] ABOUT IT.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my well that should make you feel
[1:17:22] good if you're the one that God trusts
[1:17:25] you. So
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; I hope you SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM.
[1:17:28] AMEN.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; We're looking at it THE WRONG WELL, WHY
[1:17:31] DOES GOD LET THIS GO ON? WELL, IT'S HIS
[1:17:33] BUSINESS. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE. AMEN.
[1:17:35] LISTEN, GOD IS THE KIND OF GOD THAT'LL
[1:17:38] LET A WHOLE GROUP GO INTO error just to
[1:17:39] see how one person acts about it. He did
[1:17:42] in the days of MARTIN LUTHER. ASK
[1:17:43] ELIJAH. ASK ISAIAH. ASK JEREMIAH. AMEN.
[1:17:47] GO LOOK AT JONAH. [laughter]
[1:17:50] LORD,
[1:17:51] look at all them people DOWN THERE. HE
[1:17:54] HE DIDN'T WANT HIM SAVED IN THE FIRST
[1:17:55] PLACE. Somebody
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; What a great attitude. That's a GOOD
[1:17:59] ATTITUDE. AMEN. LISTEN, JONAH, IF YOU'RE
[1:18:02] A PREACHER, ESPECIALLY JONAH, HE'S GOT A
[1:18:05] DREAM JOB. LIKE 300,000 IN ONE ONE SHOT.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; THINK LISTEN, IF I IF I GOT 300,000
[1:18:12] PEOPLE SAVED IN ONE MEETING, YOU'D hear
[1:18:14] about it.
[1:18:16] Well, hopefully. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:18:18] GETTING AT, THOUGH. THERE'S PEOPLE THAT
[1:18:19] WOULD THEY WOULD NOT MISS A CHANCE TO
[1:18:21] TELL YOU ABOUT THAT WHOLE CITY GOT
[1:18:24] CONVERTED. AND JONAH'S LITERALLY FUMING
[1:18:27] ABOUT IT
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE DOESN'T LIKE HIM. [laughter]
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THEM PEOPLE DOWN THERE SERVING
[1:18:35] GOD, REPENTING,
[1:18:38] SEEKING HIS FACE AND MY TREE THING IS
[1:18:42] DEAD
[1:18:45] AND I'M FIGHTING ABOUT IT.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S FUNNY [screaming] BECAUSE IT'S TRUE
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; CUZ WE DO THE SAME THING.
[1:18:55] I'M FIGHTING THAT THAT MY TREE'S DEAD
[1:18:56] AND THEY'RE ALL SAVED. I guess
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; really
[1:19:05] God, I'm going to paraphrase this.
[1:19:06] JONAH, LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE ACTING. YOU
[1:19:10] CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR ANCIENT AIR
[1:19:12] CONDITIONER or whatever you want. YOU
[1:19:15] CARE MORE ABOUT YOUR SHADE TREE
[1:19:17] [screaming] THAN A WHOLE CITY.
[1:19:23] WELL, help us Jesus.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; See, it comes down to our will.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; It's Burger King. We want it our way.
[1:19:31] [laughter]
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Well, listen. Jesus is king of kings,
[1:19:33] not Burger King.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; He's not trying to get you your Happy
[1:19:36] Meal. You eat it, too. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; By the way, that's a lot of processed
[1:19:39] food while I'm on diet. Real quick,
[1:19:40] don't eat it. Um,
[1:19:43] I was surprised. The Whopper's got like
[1:19:45] 3,000 milligrams of It's like three
[1:19:47] times your daily loss. I guess I'm never
[1:19:49] eating a Whopper again. I really liked
[1:19:51] him, TOO.
[1:19:53] WE WANT IT OUR WAY.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; WHAT IT IS, deep down, we have this need
[1:19:57] to be in control of things. We want to
[1:19:59] control this and we want to control
[1:20:01] that. When things don't go our way,
[1:20:02] what's the first thing we do? WE GET
[1:20:03] ANGRY.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE GET FRUSTRATED BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:20:07] confronted with this little thing that
[1:20:09] none of us really wants to deal with.
[1:20:11] You aren't actually in control of
[1:20:13] anything just about.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. our need to dominate and to
[1:20:19] possess, to control everything. It
[1:20:21] ultimately boils down to fear. WE DON'T
[1:20:25] LIKE THAT we can't control the the
[1:20:27] consequences and the outcomes of things.
[1:20:29] AND WE'RE AFRAID IF THINGS DON'T GO THE
[1:20:31] WAY WE WANT BECAUSE OF course they
[1:20:34] couldn't go any better than the way that
[1:20:35] we want it to go.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; We're afraid.
[1:20:41] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; We're afraid of not being able to direct
[1:20:44] the outcome. We're afraid of what's
[1:20:45] GOING TO HAPPEN. WE DON'T LIKE
[1:20:46] DISAPPOINTMENTS. THAT'S WHY WE MAKE
[1:20:48] RESOLUTIONS at the new year. Amen. We're
[1:20:50] disappointed how with last year went.
[1:20:52] THAT'S WHY WE'RE MAKING WE'RE IF WE WERE
[1:20:54] HAPPY WITH where you're at, you wouldn't
[1:20:55] need THE RESOLUTION. WE'RE CONFRONTED
[1:20:57] WITH DISAPPOINTMENTS ALL THE TIME AND WE
[1:20:59] HANDLE it the wrong way. And that's why
[1:21:01] we lose sleep. That's why we're in
[1:21:02] agony. That's why we're tormented. It's
[1:21:04] all insecurity. IT'S ALL FEAR. AMEN. WE
[1:21:07] DON'T LIKE DISAPPOINTMENTS. WE DON'T
[1:21:08] LIKE FAILURE. WE DON'T LIKE BEING HURT.
[1:21:10] BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE NEVER LEARNED A
[1:21:12] HEALTHY WAY TO DEAL WITH IT. SO WE LASH
[1:21:14] OUT. WE WE WE BRUSH OFF GOD. WE WE GET
[1:21:17] ANGRY AT PEOPLE AND BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING
[1:21:19] TO CONTROL THEM. THEY'RE NOT LISTENING
[1:21:20] to us.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Let me clarify something real quick.
[1:21:25] Your your your desire is not inherently
[1:21:27] the issue. If you don't like tomatoes
[1:21:28] and you don't want to eat them, that's
[1:21:30] fine. It's fine. It's not a problem.
[1:21:32] Amen. Well, I like mountains AND I LIKE
[1:21:34] IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. AMEN. YOUR DESIRE is
[1:21:37] actually not the issue. It becomes an
[1:21:39] issue when you develop this need to make
[1:21:42] everything the way you see fit. And you
[1:21:44] need to control everybody else. You
[1:21:45] begin to manipulate. You begin to lie.
[1:21:47] And you begin to lie. Christians don't.
[1:21:49] Sometimes they lie to themselves.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm the only one.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; No one else in that church even believes
[1:21:56] this message.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; They don't see it my way.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And so what happens IS IT CREATES A BIAS
[1:22:06] where everything has to be the way we
[1:22:08] think it should. And if it's not, we'll
[1:22:10] find a way to make it that, even if we
[1:22:12] have to use the Bible.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, THAT'S NO different than
[1:22:16] what Balam did. Well, I'll give him
[1:22:18] thus, sayith the Lord, to condemn him.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:22] You ever have hopefully I've had this
[1:22:24] happen, brother, come up. Well, the Lord
[1:22:26] the Lord spoke to me about your ministry
[1:22:27] and you're supposed to do this and I'm
[1:22:29] I'm always marveled. I'm like, that's
[1:22:31] funny because I'm on speaking terms with
[1:22:33] God and he never sent me the memo, but
[1:22:36] he felt to send it to you. Praise God. I
[1:22:38] rejoice. I'm glad you caught that for
[1:22:41] me. THEY THEY WANT YOU TO DO A CERTAIN
[1:22:44] THING AND so they're appealing to the
[1:22:45] thing they think can control you.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS MESSAGE DID NOT COME TO
[1:22:50] CONTROL YOU. AMEN. SOMEBODY LISTEN.
[1:22:54] RELIGION WILL CONTROL YOU. DENOMINATION
[1:22:56] WILL CONTROL YOU. BUT THIS MESSAGE
[1:22:58] DIDN'T COME TO CONTROL ME. IT CAME TO
[1:23:00] LIBERATE ME. AMEN.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; This didn't LISTEN, I KNOW WHAT IT'S
[1:23:04] LIKE TO BE IN BONDAGE. THIS DIDN'T PUT
[1:23:06] ME IN BONDAGE. IT SET ME FREE FROM
[1:23:07] BONDAGE. AMEN. I'M FREE TO SERVE GOD.
[1:23:10] I'M FREE TO LIFT MY HANDS. I'M FREE TO
[1:23:12] PRAISE GOD. AND IF ANYBODY TELLS ME
[1:23:14] OTHERWISE, I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN to
[1:23:15] him. Amen.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, SOMEBODY.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING THIS FOR THIS REASON. I THINK
[1:23:21] for myself anyway, for most of us, it
[1:23:23] should be a matter of much meditation IN
[1:23:26] OUR OWN LIVES. HOW MUCH OF WHAT I do is
[1:23:29] what the Lord wants me to do? AND HOW
[1:23:31] MUCH OF WHAT I DO IS WHAT I WANT TO DO?
[1:23:34] AND I JUST SAY IT'S WHAT THE Lord wants
[1:23:35] me to do.
[1:23:38] Happy new year.
[1:23:40] [laughter]
[1:23:42] I hope it's happy. Can we make that
[1:23:44] distinct? Because listen, there's I know
[1:23:47] I'm going to get
[1:23:49] there are certain things in your life
[1:23:50] that you do because you want to do them.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And that's fine if you're allowed to do
[1:23:54] it. If it's lawful, whatever. The
[1:23:56] problem is when you want to do it and
[1:23:58] you shouldn't or couldn't or what and so
[1:24:00] you justify it
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; by the scripture or by the message.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW THIS ONE TIME BROTHER B
[1:24:07] SAID ONE THING ABOUT a little bit of
[1:24:08] makeup and so what we do now we're all
[1:24:09] going to paint our faces up like a barn
[1:24:11] door and we're going to live however we
[1:24:12] want. Missing the point completely
[1:24:15] BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE POINT.
[1:24:17] WE CARE ABOUT JUSTIFYING OUR behavior
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; and WE'LL IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE. A BODY
[1:24:24] OF QUOTES, A BODY OF SCRIPTURE THAT ALL
[1:24:26] SAYS THE SAME THING. THERE'S NO LISTEN,
[1:24:28] THERE'S NO THERE'S NO CONTRADICTION.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; WE JUST PUT ONE THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T
[1:24:33] LIKE THE 99% of it.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; And we think that that's an EXCUSE
[1:24:38] BEFORE GOD. IT'S NOT.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; WELL, HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, there's so many. This is what
[1:24:45] I'm getting. We We get worked up about
[1:24:47] big things. We strain nuts,
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Rather, and we swallow cams. We get
[1:24:51] worked up about little things that don't
[1:24:53] matter. Amen. I was preaching a while
[1:24:55] back. I don't know if I mentioned it
[1:24:56] here, but I, you know, I was I was
[1:24:57] studying places that are under
[1:24:58] persecution, different places like North
[1:25:00] Korea and like like Somalia or Nigeria,
[1:25:02] whatever. All these places. Amen. And I
[1:25:05] got this thought, you know, I was
[1:25:06] thinking about 50,000 people in one
[1:25:08] country. 50,000 PEOPLE THAT ARE IN JAIL
[1:25:11] FOR BELIEVING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS
[1:25:13] CHRIST. AND I GOT TO THINKING, YOU KNOW,
[1:25:14] WE WE'LL SIT HERE AND ARGUE ABOUT WHO
[1:25:16] HAS THE BEST streaming service and who
[1:25:18] has the best song service and who's got
[1:25:19] the best lighting and who's got the
[1:25:21] loudest ministry, who's got THE DEEPEST
[1:25:22] TEACHING, AND WE'LL FIGHT ABOUT THIS.
[1:25:26] WE'LL MAKE IT A BIG DEAL. AND THEM
[1:25:27] PEOPLE IN JAILS DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW
[1:25:29] WHY? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; But we make it matter.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Listen, I'm saying this for a reason.
[1:25:39] And this is something hopefully as you
[1:25:41] get older, you do this more and more.
[1:25:42] Amen. So many of the things in my life,
[1:25:44] especially when I was younger, it was
[1:25:46] just a big deal. We're going to fight
[1:25:48] about this. You get a little bit older,
[1:25:49] you realize, you know, it wasn't really
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; the the these seasoned people say,
[1:25:55] "Amen." All the kids are like,
[1:25:56] "WHATEVER, MAN.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; ALL THAT STUFF.
[1:26:00] I JUST OH, MAN. THERE'S NO WAY. I WOULD
[1:26:02] NEVER." AND NOT ME. You know, most of it
[1:26:05] wasn't really big a deal as I made it
[1:26:09] out to be. Most of it wasn't really a
[1:26:11] big deal as you made it out to be. Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you you had to have things a
[1:26:16] certain way and you worried and you lost
[1:26:18] sleep and you look back and you realize
[1:26:20] it wasn't worth the attention and the
[1:26:22] detail that you and the concern that you
[1:26:25] gave to it. I had a brother I had a
[1:26:26] brother get a hold of me about something
[1:26:27] here a while back. Uh I just just
[1:26:29] succumb to me. But he he saw a certain
[1:26:31] thing a certain thing happened in the
[1:26:32] news and he was trying to you know how
[1:26:33] conspiracy theories are. [laughter]
[1:26:36] WELL, I'VE HEARD THIS AND I'VE HEARD
[1:26:37] THAT and I heard AND HE WAS GOING,
[1:26:39] "WAIT, COULD IT BE THIS OR COULD IT BE
[1:26:40] THAT AND ALL THIS DIFFERENT STUFF?" I
[1:26:41] SAID, "BROTHER, I WANT TO ASK YOU A
[1:26:42] QUESTION. Let's say it's this or it's
[1:26:44] that or the other. If you find OUT IT'S
[1:26:47] ONE OF THE, WHAT DOES IT change in your
[1:26:48] life?" Well, nothing.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Then, why are you obsessing over it?
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you FOUND THIS THING OUT and it
[1:26:57] caused you to start a militia and RAISE
[1:26:58] AN ARMY, WELL, THAT'S FINE. WELL, THAT'S
[1:27:02] FINE. [laughter]
[1:27:04] Here comes the NSA.
[1:27:06] FBI, C, any threeletter agency you can
[1:27:08] think of.
[1:27:10] IF IF IF IT WOULD JUSTIFY YOUR ATTENTION
[1:27:13] TO THE MATTER, IF IT WAS GOING TO MAKE
[1:27:15] YOU LIVE DIFFERENT, AMEN. BUT IF IT
[1:27:17] ACTUALLY DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT YOU, WHY
[1:27:20] [screaming] ARE YOU SO OBSESSED WITH IT?
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WE LIVE IN A GENERATION THAT'S
[1:27:25] LIKE THIS. AMEN. WE KNOW EVERYTHING
[1:27:27] THAT'S GOING ON IN SOME CELEBRITIES'S
[1:27:29] LIFE. AMEN. WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:27:30] GOING ON IN TEL AVIV. WE KNOW EVERYTHING
[1:27:32] THAT'S GOING ON IN RUSSIA. WE KNOW
[1:27:33] EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN
[1:27:34] EVERYBODY ELSE'S LIFE AND WE DON'T KNOW
[1:27:35] WHAT'S going on in our own home.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; WE'RE SO CAUGHT UP [screaming]
[1:27:42] IN DRAMA AND POLITICS, WE DON'T EVEN
[1:27:44] REALIZE WHAT'S UNDER OUR OWN NOSES.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And then we WAKE UP, WELL, I don't know
[1:27:49] my wife anymore. I don't know. Well, who
[1:27:52] are you GOING TO BLAME FOR THAT? THE
[1:27:53] GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN BLAME FOR A LOT OF
[1:27:55] THINGS NOW,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT ONE OF THEM.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:02] MOST OF THE STUFF that we lose, our
[1:28:04] attention, our time, our sleepover, it
[1:28:06] was a waste of time to begin with. It
[1:28:07] didn't really matter. It's not going to
[1:28:09] matter. It might not matter a year from
[1:28:10] now.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; THINK OF ALL THE THINGS YOU GOT WORRIED
[1:28:13] ABOUT LAST YEAR THAT aren't a problem
[1:28:14] anymore.
[1:28:17] Wasn't really that BIG OF A DEAL. NOW,
[1:28:18] WHY IS THAT?
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; WELL, glory to God. Listen, I told a
[1:28:22] brother this a while back. I said, you
[1:28:24] know, Jesus gave us peace, not as the
[1:28:26] world gives. He gives us his peace.
[1:28:28] Amen. I said, "Peace is valuable to me."
[1:28:30] And it gets more valuable the older I
[1:28:31] get. Amen. I like peace and quiet. I
[1:28:33] never thought I'd be that kind of a
[1:28:34] person.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Everybody's like, [screaming] I'm like,
[1:28:37] I'm going to go sit in a soundproof
[1:28:38] booth somewhere and READ A BOOK.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I LIKE my peace.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHY? BECAUSE IT'S VALUABLE TO ME.
[1:28:47] JESUS gave it to me. Amen. And the older
[1:28:49] I get, I'm more careful about what I let
[1:28:51] take it away from me.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You shouldn't let any, IF IT'S
[1:28:54] VALUABLE, YOU DON'T LET DON'T LET
[1:28:56] superficial things rob you of eternal
[1:28:58] blessings.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? This is what
[1:29:02] I'M TALKING ABOUT. AMEN. LISTEN, we're
[1:29:04] talking about this idea of impermanence.
[1:29:06] That that that things come and go. Amen.
[1:29:08] That that that things in this life,
[1:29:10] they're temporal.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; That's why we're talking about the power
[1:29:14] of surren, the power of letting go.
[1:29:15] Amen. It's imper Let me say this way.
[1:29:18] You know, there's the old saying, all
[1:29:19] good things come to an end. Well, guess
[1:29:21] what? So do all bad things.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's okay. I like that one more
[1:29:28] than the other one. [laughter]
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; All these things, THEY THEY COME TO AN
[1:29:33] end eventually. Amen. But listen, if the
[1:29:35] happiness that you had in this life, if
[1:29:37] it never ended, YOU YOU MIGHT forget the
[1:29:39] Lord. Amen. If your LIFE WAS JUST A
[1:29:42] CAKEWALK every day, Amen. Where would
[1:29:44] you be without the tension in your life?
[1:29:45] BROTHER GRAHAM SAID, THAT PUTS YOU ON
[1:29:47] GUARD. THAT MAKES YOU A CHRISTIAN. AMEN.
[1:29:49] YOU LEARN TO VALUE IT MORE WHEN IT
[1:29:50] COMES. AMEN. YOU LEARN WHEN YOU'RE GOING
[1:29:52] THROUGH TRIALS AND PROBLEMS. LISTEN,
[1:29:55] THIS IS NOT WHO THIS IS NOT ALWAYS GOING
[1:29:57] TO BE THE CASE. THIS IS NOT WHO I'M
[1:29:59] GOING TO BE FOREVER. I MIGHT STRUGGLE. I
[1:30:02] MIGHT WRESTLE. I MIGHT FALL SEVEN TIMES,
[1:30:04] BUT I'M GETTING BACK UP.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; CUZ THIS WORLD'S NOT WHERE I'M STAYING.
[1:30:09] THIS IS NOT MY HOME. I'M LOOKING FOR ONE
[1:30:11] TO COME. I'M LOOKING FOR A CITY WITH
[1:30:13] FOUNDATIONS WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS
[1:30:16] GOD. AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET LITTLE
[1:30:17] THINGS ROB ME OF THE BLESSING OF THAT.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; THIS WORLD, THE BIBLE SAYS, THE FORM OF
[1:30:25] IT AND THE FASHION THEREOF, IT PASSES
[1:30:27] AWAY. BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT DOESN'T
[1:30:29] PASS AWAY. HE THAT DOES THE WILL OF GOD
[1:30:31] SHALL ABIDE FOREVER.
[1:30:33] [applause and cheering]
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR FOCUS. THAT'S OUR DESIRE.
[1:30:36] LISTEN, I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN CONTROL.
[1:30:38] LET ME SAY THIS. IF I WAS IN CONTROL,
[1:30:40] I'D HAVE A REASON TO BE WORRIED. AMEN.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; THE VERY THING MOST OF US CONTEND FOR. I
[1:30:45] WANT TO BE IN CHARGE. I WANT TO BE
[1:30:46] CONTROL. I WANT TO I WANT TO DICTATE
[1:30:48] THIS. I'M SO GLAD I'M NOT BECAUSE I'VE
[1:30:51] BEEN IN CHARGE BEFORE [screaming] AND
[1:30:52] I'VE MESSED IT UP.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; I CAN MAKE MISTAKES. I CAN BE WRONG. I
[1:30:58] CANNOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. BUT I
[1:31:00] KNOW THE ONE THAT'S IN CONTROL, HE
[1:31:02] DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES. HE'S NEVER WRONG.
[1:31:05] He's never shortsighted. Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; SEE, WE LOSE PEACE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
[1:31:10] CONTROL. BUT TRUE PEACE DOESN'T COME
[1:31:12] FROM YOU BEING IN CONTROL.
[1:31:15] IT COMES FROM KNOWING THE ONE THAT IS IN
[1:31:17] CONTROL.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; KNOWING YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL, THAT
[1:31:21] SHOULD BE YOUR PEACE.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HOLD YOUR OWN FUTURE EVEN, BUT
[1:31:25] YOU KNOW THE [screaming] ONE WHO DOES.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; NOW, IF HE'S GOT YOUR future and all
[1:31:33] things work together for good to them
[1:31:35] that love God, to them who are the
[1:31:37] called according to your purpose, THEN
[1:31:38] WHY ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TOMATOES? I
[1:31:39] don't know why I'm using tomatoes again,
[1:31:41] but
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; about little things. Listen,
[1:31:46] I'm saying I come from a family like
[1:31:48] that
[1:31:50] where her one Thanksgiving they did this
[1:31:52] thing and I'll never forget him.
[1:31:56] Some of you laughing because you come
[1:31:57] from the same thing. Brother Bam dealt
[1:31:58] with a family like that. That German
[1:32:00] that boy said if that boy gets married,
[1:32:01] he's not converted. He'll make his
[1:32:02] WIFE'S LIFE HELL ON EARTH.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Every little offense, every little
[1:32:07] problem. 30 years ago, my wife burnt the
[1:32:12] toast. And to this day,
[1:32:15] you sound like you're nuts.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz you are.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; The way to overcome
[1:32:28] is to do the opposite of what we think
[1:32:29] most of the time.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bam. Talks about a person with a
[1:32:32] complex. 1964 questions. When a person
[1:32:35] realizes he has an inferior complex or
[1:32:37] some sort of a complex, how may he
[1:32:39] overcome this? So should it be if it was
[1:32:41] a only child causes early youth? Are you
[1:32:43] ready for the deep 12 steps to life
[1:32:46] answer to how overcome? Now I I'll say
[1:32:49] this complex is a it is a psychology
[1:32:51] term. But how do you OVERCOME A COMPLEX?
[1:32:54] WHAT MUST BE DONE? TAKE exactly the
[1:32:57] opposite.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; I can read I'm going to read the but
[1:33:04] that's it in A NUTSHELL. WELL, IF I'M
[1:33:06] SELFISH, HOW CAN I STOP BEING SELFISH?
[1:33:08] DO not selfish things.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "IF YOU'RE ALWAYS WANTING YOUR
[1:33:14] WAY," WELL, nobody like that in church
[1:33:15] today. If you're always wanting your way
[1:33:17] and that one little brat, that's his
[1:33:19] word, not mine,
[1:33:21] so I don't have to apologize for it.
[1:33:24] THAT ONE LITTLE BRAT that always wants
[1:33:25] to have everything your way, turn right
[1:33:28] back around and give everything you got
[1:33:30] the other way.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Well, that sounds easy on paper,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:33:38] IF YOU'RE SELFISH, AGAIN, IT'S ALL
[1:33:41] THEORETICAL. NO ONE HERE. IF YOU'RE
[1:33:43] SELFISH AND YOU WANT TO HOLD EVERYTHING,
[1:33:45] then start giving AWAY WHAT YOU GOT.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; SAY, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I LISTEN, IF
[1:33:51] YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE DOING IT BY
[1:33:52] FAITH." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU THE the carnal
[1:33:55] mind is enemy with God. Amen. YOU HAVE
[1:33:58] TO LET GOD REPROGRAM THIS THING.
[1:34:00] SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS. I don't
[1:34:02] want to do that. Well, praise God. Do it
[1:34:04] anyway. then it's valuable because it
[1:34:06] wasn't your idea.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WONDER, LISTEN, IF YOU ALWAYS
[1:34:10] WANTED TO do what God tells you, well,
[1:34:12] glory to God, man. I'm Well, here we
[1:34:15] are. I know some people that God's just
[1:34:18] always blessing me and everything I've
[1:34:20] ever thought, God has sanctioned it and
[1:34:22] blessed it, and I've always been right.
[1:34:23] And I'm just like, man, you're nuts. I
[1:34:25] don't I don't trust a guy with a
[1:34:26] testimony like that. AMEN.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; GOD ALWAYS TELLS YOU WHAT YOU WANT. WAS
[1:34:31] LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY TESTIMONY
[1:34:32] IS. TIME AFTER TIME AFTER AS A CHRISTIAN
[1:34:36] IN MY LIFE, I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE THE
[1:34:38] CASE. I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE DONE. AND
[1:34:40] I PRAYED AND GOD SAID, "NO, DO THE OTHER
[1:34:41] THING." AND I THOUGHT, "GOD, HOW'S THAT
[1:34:43] GOING TO WORK? GOD, [screaming] SURELY
[1:34:45] YOU MEANT." AND EVERY TIME, AMEN.
[1:34:48] LISTEN, GOD DOESN'T NEED MY INTELLECT.
[1:34:50] HE NEEDS MY SUBMISSION.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY TIME I'VE OBEYED GOD AND NOT
[1:34:55] TAKEN MY OWN IDEA, GOD HAS ALWAYS
[1:34:58] BLESSED IT. HE HAS TO BLESS IT BECAUSE
[1:35:00] IT'S HIS WILL. AND IF YOU'RE THE TYPE OF
[1:35:02] PERSON, OH, EVERYTHING I WANT, IT'S WHAT
[1:35:04] GOD GIVES ME. YOU'RE JUST A SPOILED
[1:35:06] BRAT. NO, I'M SAYING IT NOW. AMEN.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; OH, I want a bigger this and I got this
[1:35:10] and I want that. [screaming] WHERE IS
[1:35:13] THE OVERCOMING?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THERE'S NO SACRIFICE.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN. THIS PERSON OFFENDED ME
[1:35:19] AND I I'M GOING TO I'm going to give HIM
[1:35:21] AN EYE FOR LISTEN, THAT'S JUST YOU
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; GRATIFYING YOUR OWN NEED.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Do whatever. just go the vice
[1:35:31] versa. That's the way to overcome
[1:35:33] anything is an antidote. I tell you
[1:35:35] what, I know some people, this is
[1:35:36] against they're not church people.
[1:35:38] Literally, if they took their whole life
[1:35:39] and they did the opposite, they'd be
[1:35:41] better off.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] This is what this is why I'm saying
[1:35:47] this. We're talking about offenses.
[1:35:48] We're talking about having things our
[1:35:49] way today. Amen. You don't overcome
[1:35:51] offenses by holding on to them,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; You overcome them by forgiveness. Right?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T OVERCOME BITTERNESS BY
[1:36:00] CLINGING TO IT. YOU OVERCOME BITTERNESS
[1:36:03] BY letting it go.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; See, because you think if I have control
[1:36:07] of this, if I hold on to this, then I
[1:36:09] get to No, it actually has control of
[1:36:11] you.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; It's dictating how you act and how you
[1:36:15] behave.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, our human thinking is so
[1:36:19] opposite of the Lord. Amen. So often,
[1:36:21] it's the opposite of what we should do.
[1:36:22] It's only when you let go of things.
[1:36:24] This why I'm talking about impermanence
[1:36:26] that that things pass. It's when you let
[1:36:28] go of a thing that no longer has power
[1:36:29] over you.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Now, some of us maybe we've gone from
[1:36:34] new year to new year packing things
[1:36:35] around. Amen. And we're not better for
[1:36:38] it.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; What we should be doing is let it go.
[1:36:42] Amen. Listen, the Bible said that the
[1:36:44] Holy Spirit, Jesus said the Holy Spirit
[1:36:45] in us, he would be like rivers of living
[1:36:47] water flowing out. You don't make a
[1:36:49] river flow. Amen. Remember, brother talk
[1:36:52] about that guy, he come to the river and
[1:36:54] what he he had to throw the log in there
[1:36:56] and ride on it. Amen. It's going a
[1:36:57] certain way. LISTEN, IF GOD HAS taken
[1:37:00] you a certain way, THROW YOUR LOG IN
[1:37:02] THERE AND SUBMIT TO IT. SAY, "I'M RIDING
[1:37:04] ON IT." AMEN. LISTEN, YOU CAN DAMN A
[1:37:06] RIVER. YOU CAN BLOCK IT UP, BUT YOU
[1:37:08] CAN'T MAKE IT GO A different direction.
[1:37:09] AMEN. YOU CANNOT BEAT A RIVER INTO
[1:37:12] SUBMISSION. AMEN. IF IT'S ORDAINED TO BE
[1:37:14] A CERTAIN WAY, YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO FIGHT IT. YOU'RE
[1:37:18] MEANT TO SUBMIT TO IT.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; DAVID, DON'T GO KILL THIS GUY. LET GOD
[1:37:24] WORK ON YOU.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; DON'T DESPISE THE CHASING OF THE LORD.
[1:37:29] AMEN.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, BROTHER. THAT A MAN THAT'S FULLY
[1:37:32] SURRENDERED TO GOD IS OMNIPOTENT. THAT'S
[1:37:35] NOT A PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE TRIALS.
[1:37:37] THAT'S NOT A PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE
[1:37:38] QUESTIONS. THAT'S THE PERSON WHO SAYS,
[1:37:40] "THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS, AND EVEN THOUGH
[1:37:41] I WANT TO GO THE OTHER WAY, I SUBMIT
[1:37:42] [screaming]
[1:37:43] MYSELF TO IT." AND IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU
[1:37:45] GIVE UP, YOU GAIN ALL POWER. [screaming]
[1:37:48] AMEN.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT OMNIPOTENT BECAUSE YOU
[1:37:50] WRESTLED WITH IT AND TOOK IT BY THE
[1:37:52] HORSE. YOU GAVE IT AWAY
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; AND NOW YOU'VE GOT POWER over it.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at our our Lord Jesus
[1:38:02] himself.
[1:38:03] AMEN. PHILIPPIANS CHAPTER 2. LET THIS
[1:38:06] MIND BE in you that WAS IN CHRIST.
[1:38:07] YOU'VE GOT THE MIND of Christ in you.
[1:38:09] AMEN. LISTEN, HE'S GOT A MIND. IT SAID
[1:38:11] HE WOULD HE DID NOT COUNT IT ROBBERY TO
[1:38:14] BE EQUAL TO GOD. BUT WHAT DO HE DO WITH
[1:38:16] IT? I'm equal to God. I'm I'm bride
[1:38:19] material. I'm the same substance.
[1:38:21] Lightning bolts and and LASER BLASTS AND
[1:38:24] FIRE. NO. That would be neat, but the
[1:38:27] disciples tried to do that with it.
[1:38:28] WELL, LET'S CALL FIRE OUT OF HEAVEN. NO.
[1:38:32] [panting]
[1:38:32] NO. That's not the point.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; He is the form in the very image. He's
[1:38:39] the EXPRESS IMAGE OF GOD. And what does
[1:38:41] the Bible said he did with the mind of
[1:38:43] God? The mind of Christ. He humbled
[1:38:45] himself. Right?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He submitted himself to the father. Why?
[1:38:52] Because that's what real power is.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; He did only the things which pleased the
[1:38:58] father. And the Bible says he learned
[1:38:59] obedience not by all the miracles that
[1:39:02] he wrought.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; NOT BY HIS GREAT GESTURES OF POWER AND
[1:39:06] his wonderful words that he spoke. Those
[1:39:08] are all great. They're all wonderful.
[1:39:09] BUT HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE BY THE THINGS
[1:39:12] HE SUFFERED.
[1:39:15] YEAH.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Paul says in Romans chapter 5, he says,
[1:39:24] "We glory in tribulations." Well, glory
[1:39:27] to God. There's a there's a good
[1:39:28] refrigerator
[1:39:30] scripture for you today.
[1:39:32] Glory in tribulations doesn't mean you
[1:39:34] sit there and tell everybody to feel
[1:39:35] sorry for you because I'm going to
[1:39:38] glory in tribulations knowing that
[1:39:39] tribulation workketh patience and
[1:39:42] patience experience. and experience
[1:39:44] hope. Now, I got to look at this a while
[1:39:46] back. I don't know if I mentioned this,
[1:39:46] but I got to look at this a while back
[1:39:48] because seems kind of odd that they just
[1:39:49] kind of shoehorned experience in there.
[1:39:51] Patience, experience, hope. And so, it's
[1:39:54] it's a good translation, but a better
[1:39:56] translation. I was looking at the word
[1:39:57] for it. The Greek word for experience is
[1:39:59] actually the word character.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; So, patience will teach you character.
[1:40:08] And character will GIVE YOU HOPE.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE CHARACTER IS THE ONLY THING
[1:40:13] YOU ARE TAKING WITH YOU.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR
[1:40:18] HOUSE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE YOUR
[1:40:19] BITTERNESS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
[1:40:21] GRIEVANCES. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE
[1:40:22] YOUR PET DOCTRINE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[1:40:24] TAKE YOUR GOOD HEALTH. YOU'RE NOT GOING
[1:40:25] TO TAKE YOUR BAD HEALTH. BUT WE'VE BEEN
[1:40:27] INVITED, BROTHER BENAM SAID, TO BE
[1:40:29] SHAPED IN HIS CHARACTER. THAT'S WHY YOU
[1:40:31] HAVE HOPE BECAUSE POWER WITHOUT
[1:40:33] CHARACTER IS SATANIC. BUT SOMEWHERE IN
[1:40:35] YOUR LIFE, GOD HAS PUT A CHARACTER IN
[1:40:37] YOUR LIFE. AMEN. YOU HAD PATIENCE. THE
[1:40:39] BIBLE SAYS YOU HAVE PATIENCE IN YOUR
[1:40:41] TRIALS. THAT'S WHERE YOU DISPLAY THE
[1:40:43] CHARACTER OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHERE HE
[1:40:45] DISPLAYED HIS OWN CHARACTER. NOT IN
[1:40:48] MIRACLES, NOT IN SHOUTING REJOY AND IS
[1:40:50] SUFFERING. HIS CHARACTER IS ON DISPLAY.
[1:40:53] CUZ YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN A PERSON
[1:40:54] TILL YOU SQUEEZE THEM OUT.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU'RE NOT WHO YOU ARE ON YOUR
[1:40:59] BEST DAY. YOU'RE WHO YOU ARE [screaming]
[1:41:01] ON YOUR WORST DAY.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; When nothing's going YOUR WAY, WHEN
[1:41:05] NOBODY LIKES YOU. WHEN EVERYTHING'S OUT
[1:41:07] OF YOUR HANDS. WHAT CHARACTER YOU'VE GOT
[1:41:10] THEN THAT SHOWS WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; SO PATIENCE GOING THROUGH TRIALS BE
[1:41:18] BURYING IT. PATIENCE TEACHES YOU
[1:41:20] CHARACTER.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's the only thing you're
[1:41:24] taking with you.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; You're you've brought nothing into this
[1:41:28] world. Paul said in of a certainty
[1:41:30] you're taking nothing out.
[1:41:32] All your big plans, all your ambitions,
[1:41:34] all your credentials, YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS,
[1:41:37] YOUR REPUTATION, YOUR INTELLECT, YOUR
[1:41:39] DEGREES, EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE PROUD OF
[1:41:42] IN THE SIGHT OF GOD, IT'S NOT WORTH
[1:41:44] ANYTHING COMPARED TO YOUR CHARACTER.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; BEING RIGHT IN THAT ARGUMENT is not
[1:41:51] worth being compared to your character.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; THE TRYING OF YOUR FAITH, NOT YOUR
[1:41:56] FAITH, THE TRYING OF IT. THINK ABOUT
[1:41:57] THAT NOW. IT'S NOT JUST YOUR FAITH. THE
[1:41:59] TRYING OF YOUR FAITH IS WORTH more than
[1:42:02] gold TRIED IN A FIRE. WHY? BECAUSE UNTIL
[1:42:05] IT'S TRIED, IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING.
[1:42:07] [snorts]
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It has to be proven.
[1:42:11] SO GOD IS FAR. IT'S IMPERISHABLE. THAT'S
[1:42:14] why it's the one thing that won't pass
[1:42:18] away in your life.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; God is far more Let me say this real
[1:42:23] quick. You write this down if you want.
[1:42:24] God is far more concerned about our
[1:42:26] character than giving us our will. All
[1:42:28] right.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; God is far more. Now, you might not be.
[1:42:32] [laughter]
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; God is. You say, "Well, I want this and
[1:42:36] I want that." God's like, "No, your
[1:42:37] character is more important than that."
[1:42:40] You know, when you're a kid, you kid go,
[1:42:42] "Dad, why does this happen?" Well, it's
[1:42:43] to build character.
[1:42:45] [laughter]
[1:42:46] No one wants to hear that.
[1:42:48] But it's true.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; God's not trying to give you what you
[1:42:52] want all the time. He's trying to give
[1:42:52] you what you need.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz that character is worth more than
[1:42:57] gold. trying to it's imperishable.
[1:43:00] Amen.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Rem says this, "The God rich in
[1:43:03] mercy, I love him." Can I get an amen?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; I love him till I want HIS WILL TO BE
[1:43:08] DONE. NOW, that's a big statement.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; But I hope you get it the way the spirit
[1:43:13] I said it in. I want TO DO HIS WILL. I
[1:43:15] ASK HIM SOMETHING SOMETIME. HE SHAKES
[1:43:18] his head no.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And that's where we get puffed up and
[1:43:22] walk away.
[1:43:24] He shakes his HEAD NO. WATCH THIS. I RE
[1:43:26] I JUST REJOICE SO MUCH ABOUT THAT as I
[1:43:30] can as if he said yes.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Can you rejoice at his nose as much as
[1:43:35] you can his yeses?
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; See, now this is that getting older
[1:43:38] thing a little bit. I'VE SEEN ME NOT GET
[1:43:40] MY WAY ENOUGH TIMES AND I LOOK back and
[1:43:41] say, man, dodged a BULLET THERE. GOD
[1:43:44] TELLS YOU, YOU KNOW, thank you, JESUS.
[1:43:46] I'M GLAD. THANK [screaming] GOD FOR ALL
[1:43:48] THE TIMES I PRAYED FOR SOMETHING. CAN I
[1:43:50] GET A WITNESS TODAY? THANK GOD FOR ALL
[1:43:52] THE TIMES I PRAYED ABOUT SOMETHING AND I
[1:43:54] LABORED AND I WANTED [screaming] THAT
[1:43:56] WAY AND GOD DIDN'T GIVE ME MY WAY AND
[1:43:57] I'M SO GLAD HE DIDN'T.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD HE DID NOT GIVE ME MY WAY.
[1:44:02] IF I HAD GOTTEN MY WAY, I'D BE
[1:44:03] SHIPWRECKED. I'D BE GONE. [screaming]
[1:44:04] I'D BE DEAD.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR NOS IN PRAYER.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR THE NOSE IN MY LIFE THAT
[1:44:12] STOPPED ME [screaming] WHEN I WASN'T
[1:44:14] GOING TO STOP MYSELF. YEAH.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU WEREN'T WHEN YOU WERE READY TO
[1:44:18] BLEEP THROUGH EVERY BARRIER AND BLOW
[1:44:20] THROUGH EVERY WARNING, THERE WAS A GOD
[1:44:21] THAT TOLD YOU NO. AND YOU MIGHT HAVE
[1:44:23] GUSTED WITH IT. YOU MIGHT HAVE CRIED.
[1:44:25] YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST SLEEP. BUT THANK GOD
[1:44:26] YOU DIDN'T GET YOUR WAY.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; CAN I SAY THIS? SOMETIMES I REJOICE
[1:44:31] ABOUT THAT EVEN MORE THAN the yes's.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I'm so GLAD TO KNOW IT'S NOT IN MY
[1:44:36] CONTROL.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; He said we OUGHT TO ALWAYS ASK, "THY
[1:44:41] WILL BE DONE." HIS KNOWS IF THAT'S HIS
[1:44:44] WILL. IT'S A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN HIS
[1:44:46] YESES. IF IT'S HIS WILL TO do it, that's
[1:44:49] when you really love him.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in the book of Proverbs
[1:44:59] chapter 30, "Every word of God is pure.
[1:45:01] He's a shield to them that put their
[1:45:02] trust in him. Add thou not unto his
[1:45:04] words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
[1:45:06] found a liar. Two things have I REQUIRED
[1:45:08] OF THEE. DENY me them not before I die."
[1:45:12] He says, "Remove me far from vanity." In
[1:45:14] other words, the emptiness of things.
[1:45:17] Vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty
[1:45:19] nor riches. Now, we're talking about
[1:45:21] moderation for just a moment here. Feed
[1:45:24] me with food convenient for me, lest I
[1:45:25] be full. In other words, I'm too
[1:45:28] blessed.
[1:45:30] Lest I be and deny thee and say, who is
[1:45:31] the Lord? Or lest I be poor and steal
[1:45:33] and take the name of my God in vain.
[1:45:36] Paul uh Solomon makes this interesting
[1:45:38] statement in the book of Ecclesiastes,
[1:45:40] and it used to puzzle me a little bit.
[1:45:41] It's in the seventh chapter. He says,
[1:45:43] "Be not righteous over much, neither
[1:45:46] make thyself over wise. Why shouldest
[1:45:48] thou destroy thyself?" And that puzzled
[1:45:51] me like, "Don't be too righteous." Well,
[1:45:53] how's that a problem? Well, first of
[1:45:55] all, you can't make yourself righteous
[1:45:56] enough no matter what you do.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Actually, that's what the Pharisees and
[1:46:00] the Jews tried to do. And look what it
[1:46:01] caused them to do.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, it says, DON'T BE
[1:46:05] OVERLY, IN OTHER WORDS, DON'T LOOK TO
[1:46:07] BE, HEY, I'M more righteous than ever.
[1:46:09] It's about self-righteousness.
[1:46:11] It's about self-satisfaction. Amen.
[1:46:13] Listen, there's people uh this why I'm
[1:46:15] talking about moderation. You've got
[1:46:16] people that we'll just use legalism as
[1:46:19] example. THEY THEY KNOW THIS MESSAGE
[1:46:20] better than you. And they're going to
[1:46:22] tell you they know it better than you.
[1:46:24] AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE THE WAY THEY think
[1:46:25] you should live, then there's something
[1:46:27] wrong with you. AMEN. I SO THANK GOD FOR
[1:46:29] A BALANCE. THIS THIS MESSAGE BROUGHT A
[1:46:31] BALANCE. AMEN.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T SEE IT IN THE WORLD. YOU DON'T
[1:46:34] SEE IT WITH MEN. THE PROPHET BROUGHT A
[1:46:36] BALANCE WITH THIS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE
[1:46:37] SPIRIT OF GOD IN HIM. AMEN. I'M NOT
[1:46:39] LOOKING TO BE SOME SORT OF
[1:46:41] SELF-RIGHTEOUS BIGOT THAT TELLS
[1:46:43] EVERYBODY I'M THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THIS
[1:46:45] MESSAGE DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT
[1:46:47] MYSELF. IT DELIVERED ME IS WHAT IT DID.
[1:46:49] [cheering]
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT FOR ME TO LIFT MYSELF UP.
[1:46:53] LISTEN, WE'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT TRYING TO
[1:46:55] BE RIGHTEOUS.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TRYING TO I GOT TO CROSS EVERY
[1:46:59] LITTLE eye or dot every eye and cross
[1:47:01] it. We're We're trying. That's the
[1:47:03] problem. You're trying. That's what the
[1:47:05] Jews did. BEING IGNORANT OF THE
[1:47:07] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD, THEY SOUGHT TO
[1:47:10] ESTABLISH THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS. WELL,
[1:47:12] WHEN YOU ESTABLISH YOUR OWN
[1:47:13] RIGHTEOUSNESS, YOU GOT TO tell
[1:47:14] everybody.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Listen, JES, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
[1:47:17] JUSTIFICATION IS? JESUS GIVES YOU A
[1:47:18] STORY. There's two guys went in the
[1:47:19] temple one day. ONE SAID, "WELL, I DO
[1:47:21] THIS AND I DO THAT. I'm not like
[1:47:22] brother. I'm not like brother Ben. That
[1:47:26] guy, he's a rascal. I do this and I'm
[1:47:29] me."
[1:47:32] That man wasn't justified
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; because he tried to just It's the
[1:47:36] opposite. He tried to justify himself.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; WATCH THE OTHER MAN. HE SMOKED HIS
[1:47:41] CHEST. SAID, "GOD, BE MERCIFUL to me, A
[1:47:45] SINNER.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T RIGHTEOUS IN HIS OWN EYES.
[1:47:48] [screaming] THAT'S WHY GOD SAID HE WAS
[1:47:50] RIGHTEOUS.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE OVER IT'S LIKE YEAH, I use this
[1:47:55] ALL THE TIME. DON'T BE OVERWISE." IN
[1:47:56] OTHER WORDS, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE WISE, YOU
[1:47:57] DON'T HAVE TO GO AROUND telling people.
[1:47:59] It's like a It's like an unwritten rule,
[1:48:01] you know, if I go up to Brian, well, I'm
[1:48:03] I'm the wisest one here. Probably not.
[1:48:09] It It seems It seems sad sometimes that
[1:48:12] you can't advertise how great you are.
[1:48:15] I'm wiser than everybody. Well, listen.
[1:48:17] A WISE MAN DOESN'T THINK OF HIMSELF that
[1:48:19] way.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; PAUL SAID, "A WISE MAN IS NOT WISE IN
[1:48:21] HIS OWN CONCEIT. HE DOESN'T LOOK AT
[1:48:23] HIMSELF THAT WAY." THAT'S IRONICALLY
[1:48:26] WHAT MAKES HIM WISE. [screaming]
[1:48:27] ALL RIGHT.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; A HUMBLE MAN'S NOT TELLING YOU HOW I
[1:48:31] LOVE THIS BECAUSE YOU LISTEN TO OTHER
[1:48:33] MINISTERS, OTHER preachers that were
[1:48:34] contemporaries OF BROTHER BHAM. THAT WAS
[1:48:36] THE THING THEY ALL SAID. HE WAS THE
[1:48:37] HUMBLEST of all preachers. What a humble
[1:48:39] man. Brother B say now I your humble
[1:48:41] servant, the humble prophet to the
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; not advertising that.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Hey guys, I'm so humble. I'm proud of
[1:48:52] it. I wrote a book on it because I'm an
[1:48:55] expert ON HE THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE OVER. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE
[1:49:01] NOT TRYING TO MAKE and that's why I'm
[1:49:02] saying we'll fight and we'll fight and
[1:49:04] we'll fuss because this is important and
[1:49:07] maybe it's not
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; We strain it nuts and we listen. How
[1:49:11] many married couples, you know, glory to
[1:49:14] God? Listen, our our social media
[1:49:18] generation is killing us softly
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; because we see everybody's highlight
[1:49:22] reels. Well, listen. Her husband's
[1:49:24] perfect. He works out. He's got a
[1:49:25] six-figure job. He's great. Oh, man.
[1:49:27] She's perfect. She looks pretty. AND YOU
[1:49:29] DON'T SEE IT'S LIKE BROTHER VISITING
[1:49:30] THEM TWO COUPLES. There's that rich
[1:49:32] COUPLE UP. OH, THEY GOT A NICE HOUSE.
[1:49:34] OH, MAN. I SEE ALL THEIR HIGHLIGHT
[1:49:36] REELS. They don't act like that when the
[1:49:37] camera's off.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; But that's what you see. And a woman, a
[1:49:43] man, well, I wish I had a family like
[1:49:44] that. I wish I had Well, he leaves his
[1:49:46] socks on the floor. Well, she doesn't
[1:49:48] cook THE THING THAT I LIKE EVERY DAY OF
[1:49:49] THE WEEK, AND SHE WANTS ME TO be
[1:49:51] healthy. No, my wife didn't make me. I'm
[1:49:54] just as an example. [laughter]
[1:49:57] He He He left his socks on the floor,
[1:49:59] and I just I can't do it anymore, Lord.
[1:50:03] Maybe that's not grounds for divorce.
[1:50:05] You're going to have to take that with
[1:50:06] the pastor. Marriage and divorce.
[1:50:10] WE'RE SO UPSET ABOUT THIS LITTLE THING.
[1:50:11] IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE LISTEN, if you
[1:50:13] want to get anywhere in marriage,
[1:50:14] anybody that's been married a long time,
[1:50:16] they'll tell you you got to learn to
[1:50:17] forgive.
[1:50:19] Boy, this got real simplistical.
[1:50:22] I mean, clearly, it's not a big deal.
[1:50:26] It's not a big deal. Quit making it a
[1:50:29] bigger deal than it is.
[1:50:31] My wife asked me to do something in the
[1:50:32] house. Said, "Listen, you don't have to
[1:50:33] tell me every six months. I got to
[1:50:35] know."
[1:50:37] Well, Glory, God forgive me, too. But
[1:50:40] I'm gonna tell a story here. Is this all
[1:50:42] right? Is that all right?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I had a I had a brother come to me a
[1:50:44] while back. Well, now if the pastor
[1:50:46] wants to correct this
[1:50:49] when he gets back, that's fine. But I
[1:50:50] had a brother come to me a while back.
[1:50:51] This brother in his house has a
[1:50:54] Christmas tree.
[1:50:59] Now, I'm not justifying her. NOT
[1:51:02] ENDORSING THIS BEHAVIOR.
[1:51:05] But to make my point, he's got a
[1:51:07] Christmas TREE IN HIS HOUSE because his
[1:51:10] wife and kids like that sort of thing
[1:51:12] for God knows what reason, but and his
[1:51:15] dad, he believes the message. Not Not
[1:51:19] that the other one doesn't. He wouldn't
[1:51:21] have a Christmas tree. He wouldn't be
[1:51:22] caught. You couldn't offer him a million
[1:51:24] dollars to put a Christmas tree in
[1:51:25] house. And hey, I respect that. I
[1:51:26] respect them both.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; It's their house. I don't live there.
[1:51:29] Whatever.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; I'm saying this for a reason. Amen.
[1:51:33] When he put this Christmas tree up in
[1:51:35] his house, dad said, 'Well, listen. I'm
[1:51:37] not coming over to visit you during
[1:51:38] Christmas, just so you know. I'm not
[1:51:39] going to come over. I won't come over
[1:51:41] that time of year. I'm not going to go
[1:51:42] in there when you got that in your
[1:51:43] house. I I asked this question. I said,
[1:51:45] "If brother Ram was still alive today,
[1:51:47] would you go visit him at his house?"
[1:51:49] Oh, yeah. I'd love to go visit Brother.
[1:51:50] What if you went over to his house in
[1:51:52] December?
[1:51:53] [laughter]
[1:51:56] Yeah,
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; cuz guess who had a tree in
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; there?
[1:52:01] Now again, I'm not I'm more of a
[1:52:04] Hanukkah guy to be honest.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; I like eight days of eight nights, I
[1:52:08] guess.
[1:52:11] A father and a son
[1:52:14] disagreed on I don't know if it's fake
[1:52:15] or real. Maybe that's worth fighting
[1:52:17] over, too. How many how many missed
[1:52:19] opportunities
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; is there in their relationship during
[1:52:25] the last two months of the year because
[1:52:27] of that?
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Is it really worth not even seeing them?
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I had the privilege about this time last
[1:52:37] year. I went to see the great pyramids
[1:52:39] of Giza. I went inside the py where
[1:52:40] talks about the king's chamber and you
[1:52:42] got to kneel. It's really cool. Um I
[1:52:45] like the Grand Canyon more though, but
[1:52:46] that's a whole another story. Um, I went
[1:52:48] in the Great Pyramid and I mean there's
[1:52:51] lines there. I I couldn't get in one
[1:52:53] day. The line was so long. It's amazing
[1:52:55] to me. DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY, I mean,
[1:52:59] they're not going anywhere.
[1:53:01] It's not like it's seasonal. It's hot
[1:53:02] there YEAR ROUND. BUT DAY AFTER
[1:53:05] [screaming] DAY AFTER DAY, PEOPLE GO IN
[1:53:06] THIS PIT. IT'S THE LAST REMAINING GREAT
[1:53:08] ONE OF THE WORLD. IT'S HUGE. AND HOW
[1:53:10] THEY BUILD IT? OF COURSE, WE KNOW WHAT A
[1:53:11] PROPHET SAID ABOUT ENOCH. I believe
[1:53:13] that. AMEN. THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
[1:53:14] IT'S MASSIVE. [screaming]
[1:53:15] AND PEOPLE FLOCK FROM OUT AND THERE SO
[1:53:17] THERE WAS THIS THING THAT CAME UP JUST
[1:53:18] AFTER I got back and I see it's still
[1:53:20] circulating. I haven't studied it cuz
[1:53:21] honestly I don't care that much but um
[1:53:24] they think now they that they did this
[1:53:26] like ultrasound thing in the ground.
[1:53:27] There's these big huge whatever under
[1:53:30] there and it's the the pyramid. It's
[1:53:32] just the tip of it. THERE'S IT'S SO MUCH
[1:53:33] MORE MASSIVE. IT'S A BIG ENERGY thing
[1:53:34] which would make sense because brother
[1:53:35] BM said things about it. It was a
[1:53:37] nuclear age. BUT THERE'S ALL THIS STUFF
[1:53:39] THERE UNDERNEATH THEY THINK. Maybe I
[1:53:42] don't know. Again I'm just making that's
[1:53:43] not my point. ALL THIS STUFF IS MAYBE
[1:53:45] THERE. AND THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT,
[1:53:47] WELL, TOO BAD. WE DON'T WANT TO CLOSE UP
[1:53:48] SHOP BECAUSE WE GET MONEY FOR TOURISM.
[1:53:50] We're not worried about archaeology.
[1:53:52] WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT MAKING MONEY.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I HAD THIS THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I WENT
[1:53:56] THERE AND ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT COME IN
[1:53:58] THERE AND I HAD THIS THOUGHT. I MEAN,
[1:54:00] THANK GOD FOR A MESSAGE WHICH ACTUALLY
[1:54:01] tells us what THIS IS ABOUT. BUT I HAD
[1:54:03] THIS THOUGHT THOUSANDS, PROBABLY
[1:54:05] MILLIONS OF PEOPLE YEAR ROUND, THEY
[1:54:08] FLOCK TO THE PYRAMIDS AND IT'S MASSIVE
[1:54:10] AND IT'S STONE. OH, LOOK AT THIS GREAT
[1:54:12] PY MAN. THIS IS AMAZING. HAVE YOU EVER
[1:54:14] SEEN IT? THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT OR IT'S
[1:54:16] THE GREATEST. YOU YOU HAVE TO COME SEE
[1:54:19] IT. IT'S SO GREAT. WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT
[1:54:21] IT? [screaming] WE DON'T KNOW.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S SO AMAZING? WHAT WAS IT FOR?
[1:54:27] WELL, WE DON'T ACTUALLY REALLY KNOW,
[1:54:29] [screaming]
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; WE COULD TELL YOU WHY, [screaming]
[1:54:35] BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL.
[1:54:39] DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; WE DO THAT. IT'S A BIG DEAL. I JUST
[1:54:44] COULDN'T TELL YOU WHY.
[1:54:50] WHY IS IT HISTORICAL GUESSWORK? THERE'S
[1:54:52] ENOUGH ATTENTION THERE. DO THEY EVEN
[1:54:55] WANT [screaming] TO KNOW?
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING THIS FOR REASON. ALL THESE
[1:54:58] WONDERS, ALL THESE GREAT THINGS, THEY'RE
[1:54:59] SO MAGNIFICENT. THEY'RE SO GREAT.
[1:55:01] THEY'RE SO WONDERFUL. BUT WE DON'T EVEN
[1:55:02] KNOW WHY
[1:55:05] THEY'RE HERE TODAY, THEY'RE GONE
[1:55:06] TOMORROW. IT'S LIKE A VAPOR. IT'S LIKE
[1:55:08] GRASS. [panting]
[1:55:10] Solomon tells this story. Solomon says,
[1:55:12] "One generation passes away. Another
[1:55:14] generation cometh, but the earth abides
[1:55:16] forever. The sun ariseth, it goes down,
[1:55:17] it hasteth. The wind goes to the south,
[1:55:19] it turns the north, it whirl about
[1:55:21] continuously. THE WIND RUNTH ACCORDING
[1:55:23] CIRCUITS. ALL RIVERS RUN INTO THE SEA,
[1:55:25] YET THE SEA IS NOT FULL. THEY ALL
[1:55:28] RETURNED FROM WHENCE THEY CAME." SEE, he
[1:55:29] knew about evaporation before the
[1:55:30] sciences.
[1:55:32] All things are FULL OF LABOR. MANK, THE
[1:55:35] EYES NOT SATISFIED WITH SEEING. THE EAR
[1:55:38] IS NOT FILLED WITH HEARING. THE THING
[1:55:40] THAT HAS BEEN IS THAT WHICH SHALL BE,
[1:55:42] and that which is done is THAT WHICH
[1:55:44] SHALL BE DONE. THERE IS NO new thing
[1:55:46] UNDER THE SUN. IS THERE ANYTHING where
[1:55:49] it may be said, see, this is new. IT
[1:55:51] HATH BEEN ALREADY of old time.
[1:55:54] There is no remembrance of former
[1:55:56] things. Neither shall there be any
[1:55:58] remembrance of things that are to come
[1:56:00] with those [laughter]
[1:56:01] that shall come after. Now, we say,
[1:56:03] "Well, we have new things." Not really.
[1:56:05] I saw this thing a while back. They're
[1:56:06] wanting to reduce our carbon emissions.
[1:56:08] So, they came up with this idea. They're
[1:56:11] going to take our great ships, these big
[1:56:14] things that haul cargo, these car, and
[1:56:15] they're going to put these huge sail
[1:56:17] like kite things on them, and they're
[1:56:18] going to pull them across the sea like,
[1:56:19] "Oh, sailboats. We've done that before.
[1:56:22] [laughter]
[1:56:23] We're just repackaging it. We call it
[1:56:25] new, but we've done something just like
[1:56:27] it before.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; We have AI. Well, we had idols before
[1:56:32] that spoke. What's the difference?
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; It's just a repackaging.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Because the human spirits the same.
[1:56:39] Amen. Now, I've read this for this
[1:56:40] reason. There's a story in the midrash
[1:56:43] the Jews tell. Ray probably already
[1:56:44] knows it, but everybody else probably
[1:56:45] doesn't. So, it's okay. Maybe you let me
[1:56:48] know if you know the story. Solomon,
[1:56:50] because you read the book of
[1:56:51] Ecclesiastes, Solomon had it all. He's
[1:56:53] got riches. He's got wealth. He's got
[1:56:54] peculiar treasures. He's got MAN
[1:56:56] SERVICE. M. HE'S GOT EVERYTHING. AND THE
[1:56:58] MIDASH TELLS THIS STORY. Solomon one day
[1:56:59] is getting ready to hold a feast. Do you
[1:57:01] know this one yet? I'm getting there.
[1:57:03] I'm getting there. He's getting ready to
[1:57:04] hold a feast. And he hears about a ring
[1:57:07] and he calls his wise adviser. Now, some
[1:57:10] Jews think it's because he wanted to
[1:57:11] fail so he could get fired. Fire the
[1:57:13] guy. Some think it's because he trust.
[1:57:14] But whatever the reason, he said, "I
[1:57:16] I've heard about a ring." He said, "This
[1:57:18] ring has got three words on it." And
[1:57:21] these three words, they're always true
[1:57:23] no matter what. He said, 'It has the
[1:57:25] power to bring humility to those that
[1:57:27] are in joy, and it has the power to
[1:57:29] comfort those that are in sorrow. And I
[1:57:31] want you to go find it. And the guy's
[1:57:32] like, "Okay, piece of cake, right?"
[1:57:35] Couldn't find it. Time goes on, time
[1:57:37] goes on, he's looking for it, can't find
[1:57:38] it. Gets to the day of the feast and the
[1:57:40] guy comes back to Jerusalem and he's
[1:57:42] he's as down as a guy can get about his
[1:57:44] job. He does not know what he's going to
[1:57:46] do. He can't find it. And he happens to
[1:57:47] go through the poorest district in
[1:57:49] Jerusalem. And the midrash tells this
[1:57:50] story that he gets to a peddler who's
[1:57:53] selling wares and the guy sees his face
[1:57:55] recogniz he's an imperial or whatever
[1:57:57] the king and he says well what seems to
[1:57:59] be the problem and he you know he just
[1:58:00] looks to spot says I'm looking for this
[1:58:02] ring it's supposed to take somebody it
[1:58:03] could take a man that he's at the height
[1:58:05] of his time he's having joy he's got
[1:58:07] mirth and it'll it'll it'll bring him
[1:58:09] humility it'll bring him low but the
[1:58:11] same ring these three same words they
[1:58:13] they're always true if a man is
[1:58:15] despondent if he's sad he'll read it and
[1:58:17] it'll lift his spirits and the peddler
[1:58:18] says I got exactly the thing for you.
[1:58:21] And he hands the man that ring
[1:58:23] and the man looks at that ring. The
[1:58:25] smile comes across his face. This is it.
[1:58:28] You know how it is when a plan comes
[1:58:29] together. So he goes into there to
[1:58:32] Solomon and Solomon's having this feast.
[1:58:33] And remember, he's got everything. He's
[1:58:36] got everything. You think Elon's great.
[1:58:39] Or maybe you don't. Whatever. I mean,
[1:58:40] the man's got the world in his hand.
[1:58:44] And he sees the guy come back. He's
[1:58:45] like, "Well, there's no way he did this,
[1:58:46] but oh, did you find did you find the
[1:58:48] ring?" He's like, "Yes, I did.
[1:58:50] It's right here." And Solomon, you know,
[1:58:53] he's got all this going on. He's smiling
[1:58:54] great big. He looks at the ring and he
[1:58:59] looks around and he writes this story
[1:59:02] that we read.
[1:59:04] It's three words in the Hebrew. It's
[1:59:06] four in our language. It's gamora.
[1:59:11] This too shall pass.
[1:59:16] and I've got everything. It's great.
[1:59:19] That too shall pass.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; It's not forever.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; Or church, we're we're in the biggest
[1:59:27] this and that's great, man. But that's
[1:59:29] not forever.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Neither is trials.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Neither are problems.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; We come to the end of the Let me Let me
[1:59:44] read these scriptures real quick. I hope
[1:59:45] this is all right. Moses says this in
[1:59:46] the 90th Psalm. Lord, thou has been our
[1:59:48] dwelling place in all generations before
[1:59:50] the mountains were ever brought forth.
[1:59:52] Or thou hast ever formed the earth in
[1:59:53] the world. Even from everlasting to
[1:59:55] everlasting, thou art God. THOU TURNEST
[1:59:57] MAN TO DESTRUCTION, SAY, "RETURN, ye
[1:59:59] children of men. For a thousand years in
[2:00:01] thy sight are as but a yesterday when
[2:00:03] it's passed, and a watch of the night.
[2:00:05] Thou carest them away as with a flood,
[2:00:07] and they are asleep. In the morning,
[2:00:08] they're like the grass." Notice how he's
[2:00:10] saying this. They're like the grass
[2:00:11] which growth up. In the morning it
[2:00:12] flourisheth and growth up. Even in the
[2:00:15] evening it's cut down and witherth. WE
[2:00:18] ARE CONSUMED BY THINE ANGER AND BY THY
[2:00:20] WRATH ARE WE TROUBLED. THOU HAS SET OUR
[2:00:22] iniquities before they are SECRET SINS
[2:00:25] IN THE LIGHT OF THY COUNTENANCE. ALL OUR
[2:00:27] DAYS ARE PASSED AWAY IN THY WRATH. WE
[2:00:30] SPEND OUR YEARS AS A TALE THAT IS TOLD.
[2:00:32] And he says our years are three score
[2:00:34] and 10. Or by strength they be four
[2:00:36] score. Yet their strength is in labor
[2:00:38] and sorrow. It's soon cut off. we fly
[2:00:41] away. THAT'S PRETTY BLEAK, MAN. I read
[2:00:44] that like, man, I don't feel like
[2:00:45] rejoicing too much right now. But you
[2:00:48] got to go on and read the rest. But
[2:00:49] David, if now I'm going read this here,
[2:00:52] it's the 103rd Psalm. Amen. David takes
[2:00:55] this very same thought, but it's all how
[2:00:57] you look at it.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice what David says. Verse 6.
[2:01:02] The Lord executute righteous and
[2:01:03] judgment for all who are oppressed. He
[2:01:05] made known his ways unto Moses, the guy
[2:01:07] we just read, his acts unto the children
[2:01:09] of Israel. The Lord is merciful
[2:01:12] and gracious. He's slow to anger.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Plenty. Look, you're just looking at the
[2:01:17] natural. Look at our lives. They're so
[2:01:19] brief. They're so diminishes because
[2:01:21] we've sinned. WE'VE FALLEN SHORT. THAT'S
[2:01:23] TRUE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; HE'S also plenteous IN MERCY. HE
[2:01:28] [screaming] WILL NOT ALWAYS CHIDE.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Neither will he keep HIS ANGER FOREVER.
[2:01:35] HE HAS NOT DEALT WITH US. OH,
[2:01:37] HALLELUJAH, SOMEBODY. HE HAS NOT
[2:01:39] [screaming] DEALT WITH US AFTER OUR
[2:01:40] SINS, nor rewarded us ACCORDING TO OUR
[2:01:42] INIQUITY. YEAH, I COULD LOOK AT I
[2:01:44] DESERVE THIS, BUT THAT'S NOT HOW GOD
[2:01:46] TREATS ME.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHAT I DESERVE, BUT GOD DOESN'T
[2:01:50] SEE IT THAT WAY.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; NOTICE THIS. FOR AS THE HEAVEN IS HIGH
[2:01:54] ABOVE THE EARTH, so great is his mercy
[2:01:57] TOWARD THEM THAT FEAR HIM. AS FAR AS THE
[2:01:59] EAST IS FROM THE WEST, SO FAR HATH HE
[2:02:02] REMOVED OUR TRANSGRESSION FROM US. LIKE
[2:02:04] AS [screaming] A FATHER PITYTH HIS
[2:02:06] CHILDREN,
[2:02:07] SO THE LORD PITY THEM THAT FEAR. LISTEN,
[2:02:10] YOU'RE NOT OUT to get your own children.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD DOESN'T LOOK AT YOU AS THE
[2:02:15] COSMIC PROBLEM HE'S GOT TO DEAL WITH
[2:02:16] THIS MORNING. YOU'RE HIS CHILDREN.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T SIT THERE, WELL, you should
[2:02:21] know better now this. YEAH, YOU PROBABLY
[2:02:23] SHOULD know better. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:02:25] But you're his children.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; He has pity for you. I just want
[2:02:29] something better for you.
[2:02:31] So the Lord pityth them, notice this,
[2:02:34] that fear him, for he knoweth our frame.
[2:02:37] HE REMEMBERETH THAT WE ARE DUST. NOW
[2:02:41] SOMETIMES you forget that.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Well, I should be better than this.
[2:02:44] Well, listen. This thing, you're going
[2:02:46] to have trouble with it the rest of your
[2:02:48] life, but that doesn't make you not his
[2:02:49] child.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I got troubles now, and I still
[2:02:56] got troubles. But that shall not always
[2:02:58] That too shall pass.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not. His anger doesn't abide
[2:03:02] forever. Notice this verse 15. As for
[2:03:05] men, his days are his grass. Same thing
[2:03:06] Moses said. See, his days are his grass.
[2:03:09] As a flower of the field, so he
[2:03:10] flourisheth. For the wind passeth over
[2:03:12] and it is gone, and the place thereof
[2:03:14] shall know no more. If he stopped there,
[2:03:16] there'd be a little sabbath. The next
[2:03:18] verse, but
[2:03:20] the mercy of the Lord
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; is from everlasting
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; to everlasting upon them that fear him
[2:03:28] and his righteousness
[2:03:31] unto children's children. There's the
[2:03:32] one thing that shall not pass.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; We come to the year, you know, the
[2:03:38] year's ended and
[2:03:41] you know, I'll just say this as I'm
[2:03:42] closing.
[2:03:44] You know, some people they've gone on to
[2:03:46] their reward. I don't know. what the the
[2:03:48] census is here. But some people they've
[2:03:50] gone on to the reward. Some maybe have
[2:03:52] added children. It's always changing.
[2:03:53] Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; If the Lord carries another year and
[2:03:56] we're all here together next year again,
[2:03:58] that might change. Amen.
[2:04:01] You don't know. You don't know if you'll
[2:04:02] be here five minutes from now. Some of
[2:04:04] us had troubles last year and we can say
[2:04:07] they're gone this year. Some of you
[2:04:09] didn't have certain troubles last year
[2:04:10] and you've got them now. Some of you
[2:04:12] might have had troubles last year and
[2:04:14] you still got them. DON'T. BUT NO MATTER
[2:04:16] where you're at with that, just remember
[2:04:18] that too shall pass.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; That's not who you are. Amen. By God's
[2:04:25] grace, you are where you're at today.
[2:04:28] God brought you here a very long way.
[2:04:29] Amen.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Maybe you've got a mountain that's been
[2:04:32] there longer than you want to be. Maybe
[2:04:33] it's been there a long time, but one day
[2:04:34] we'll soon be done with troubles and
[2:04:36] trials.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; We'll look back and it'll all be worth
[2:04:40] it. Amen. It is not worthy to be
[2:04:43] compared.
[2:04:46] your troubles and troubles are not
[2:04:47] worthy. That little fuss, that little
[2:04:49] hang up in your It's not worthy.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; It's all
[2:04:54] worth letting go.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; So that's my This too shall that's the
[2:05:00] title, by the way. This two shall pass
[2:05:02] before it passes.
[2:05:05] It's all It's not a big deal.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Heaven's a big deal.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; God's mercy is a big deal.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Letting go is a big deal.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] Stand to your feet today. Maybe maybe
[2:05:20] there'll be someone here. You don't have
[2:05:21] to tell me or whatever, but maybe you're
[2:05:24] in a marriage or a home. Maybe there's
[2:05:25] maybe there's little unresolved things
[2:05:27] in your life. This moment will pass.
[2:05:30] Amen.
[2:05:32] And you can let that thing pass with it
[2:05:34] or you can carry it forward and it's not
[2:05:36] going to help you one bit. Maybe a
[2:05:38] husband and wife. Maybe it's time to
[2:05:39] make Maybe it's time to make some
[2:05:43] make a forgiveness.
[2:05:46] Maybe it's time to restore
[2:05:47] communication.
[2:05:50] Maybe you say, "You know what? I'm not
[2:05:51] as close to God as I used to be. I want
[2:05:52] to get closer." Well, I wouldn't wait
[2:05:54] till next year.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Don't wait till December 31st.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; All these things. Maybe you're on top of
[2:06:03] the world. Say, "I'm too good for this
[2:06:06] church.
[2:06:07] I don't need these people. That'll pass,
[2:06:09] too.
[2:06:13] It's all
[2:06:15] fleeting. It's amazing to me. Solomon,
[2:06:18] now if you read the book of
[2:06:19] Ecclesiastes, you don't finish it.
[2:06:20] You're going to get depressed. You got
[2:06:21] to finish it.
[2:06:22] He looks at all this stuff that he has.
[2:06:24] He's like, you know what? It's all
[2:06:26] vanity. It means nothing. These women,
[2:06:30] these men, these go, it's nothing.
[2:06:33] He goes through all this stuff. He
[2:06:36] finally applies wisdom in his heart. He
[2:06:38] said, "YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S HEAR THE
[2:06:39] CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER. Fear God and
[2:06:42] keep his commandments." I'm thinking,
[2:06:44] man, that's sad that he waited till the
[2:06:46] end of his life to get that.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; That'd be sad to wait that long.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seek him while he may be found.
[2:06:54] Amen. God bless you today. Uh Kia C
[2:06:56] today,
[2:06:58] let's try to sing this song together.

[2:07:12] My heartache here

[2:07:22] along the [singing] trail
[2:07:25] that's always winding upward.
[2:07:31] This trbled world [music]
[2:07:34] is not my final home.

[2:08:14] me home. The things of earth, oh yeah,
[2:08:17] think about it. The things of earth
[2:08:21] will dim and lose their value
[2:08:24] [music and singing]
[2:08:27] if we recall.
[2:08:30] They're borrowed for a while.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; and the things of earth
[2:08:39] that cause this heart [music] to tremble
[2:08:45] remember there
[2:08:48] will only bring a smile.
[2:08:54] Oh, until then
[2:08:57] my heart [music]
[2:08:58] will go on sing.
[2:09:04] [music] Until then,
[2:09:06] with joy I'll carry on.
[2:09:12] Until the day. [music]
[2:09:16] Mine eyes behold the city. [music]
[2:09:21] until the day
[2:09:24] God calls. Sing it again
[2:09:28] one more time. Oh, but [music] until
[2:09:31] then
[2:09:34] my heart will go on saying
[2:09:39] [singing and music] until then
[2:09:42] with joy I'll carry on
[2:09:48] until the day.
[2:09:51] Blind eyes behold the city
[2:09:57] until the day
[2:10:00] God calls
[2:10:02] me home.
[2:10:05] Why don't you just bless him this
[2:10:06] afternoon?
[2:10:08] Thank you, God. Hallelujah. Amen. God
[2:10:11] bless you today. Go ahead, brother

[2:10:28] of misery [music]
[2:10:30] and strife.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. But the soul of man
[2:10:37] it's like a way
[2:10:41] [music and singing]
[2:10:46] it's destined
[2:10:48] for [music] the sky.
[2:10:52] Until [singing]
