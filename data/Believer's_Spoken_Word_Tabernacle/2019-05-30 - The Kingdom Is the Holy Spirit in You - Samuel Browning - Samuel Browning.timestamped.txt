[16:39] lordy the dog Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[16:47] glory be to God you love him amen
[16:51] blessed be the name of the Lord amen we
[16:55] want to go to Acts chapter one tonight a
[16:58] man just so thankful for the mercy of
[17:03] God amen what uh what a weekend that we
[17:09] had you know I I don't know I don't know
[17:15] how many of you read the even the other
[17:18] email that I sent out to you but there's
[17:21] so much that I feel and follow up with
[17:24] with the things that God has done in our
[17:27] midst and I just believe with all my
[17:30] heart that you realize what God's desire
[17:36] is and to see that you know the meetings
[17:39] themselves brother Tim even mentioned it
[17:42] and I had sent it out to even on the
[17:45] quotes and things before but you know
[17:48] the meetings themselves it would not
[17:50] have it would not have had the effect
[17:52] that it would have had if hearts had not
[17:55] been praying and expecting
[17:59] and we realized that our prayer and our
[18:01] expectation was for God to come on the
[18:03] scene I want you to think of what
[18:06] happened because you know here we've
[18:07] already entered back into the the
[18:09] workweek and everything else that we
[18:11] have to attend to but it still just lets
[18:15] you and I know that our focus and I've
[18:18] everything let it be solemnly and
[18:21] focused on the Lord you know there's
[18:23] times when we're looking at it in prayer
[18:25] and as we're praying you don't always
[18:27] have to be in your prayer closet I
[18:29] believe in having time away with the
[18:32] Lord I believe that with all my heart
[18:33] because there there's an effect upon our
[18:36] lives it's it's an effect when Jesus
[18:38] said we're praying we're asking for our
[18:41] daily bread we're asking for his
[18:43] leadership we're asking for his will to
[18:45] be done in earth even as it is in heaven
[18:47] and when we we look at that that
[18:49] expectation of even even from even this
[18:53] time forward I just say God let us be in
[18:57] a in a channel of expectation you know
[19:00] brother Branham he talked about it he
[19:01] would many different places in the
[19:03] message even when you listened to the
[19:05] messages expectation but the remm talks
[19:07] about at times he said he would just
[19:09] walk to the platform had not even prayed
[19:11] for nobody and he said people started
[19:13] getting up off the cots and you know you
[19:16] know what it was it wasn't about there
[19:18] hadn't even been in discernment take
[19:19] place whatsoever it's just people were
[19:21] already in an expectation and I just say
[19:24] it like this you know what we we want to
[19:27] take a hold of what God has put in our
[19:29] in our possession amen and don't let the
[19:32] devil take it take it away you realize
[19:35] we've said it over and over you have
[19:37] more control over these services than
[19:39] what you realize you know we come into
[19:42] service we we come in with a real
[19:44] purpose in our hearts and you know and
[19:46] brother Tim he made mention of that even
[19:48] in the the second Saturday service when
[19:50] he opened that service and he said you
[19:52] know I said I just feel such a Liberty
[19:54] here and that Liberty that that is that
[19:57] is felt you know he was prayed up but
[20:00] here we are as prayed up brother
[20:01] brimstone when you get the minister
[20:02] prayed up and the congregation prayed up
[20:04] he said things are going to happen
[20:06] the bream said when the people are
[20:07] prayed up and the ministers prayed up he
[20:09] said you don't have to he said the
[20:11] people he said they come through the
[20:12] prayer lines he said you just cast the
[20:14] spirit off he said and they go ahead and
[20:15] go on because people are already prayed
[20:17] up and in tune with God amen now that
[20:20] doesn't mean we're not going to have
[20:21] battles we're gonna have battles I don't
[20:26] know if I get to this tonight but
[20:27] there's nothing that God does that Satan
[20:31] won't try to contest it and he's
[20:33] permitted to do that but you know when
[20:35] he's permitted to do that that only
[20:37] shows the good that taken place that's
[20:41] what it shows amen so we want to look
[20:44] into the word of the Lord tonight just
[20:47] so so appreciate everything that was
[20:49] done and this weekend maybe I'll say
[20:51] more about that on Sunday of all day
[20:54] every all the efforts that went into
[20:55] make the weekend possible and we just I
[20:59] want to read just one or two verses of
[21:01] Scripture I'm gonna go to Acts chapter 1
[21:03] verse 8 but you shall receive power
[21:09] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[21:12] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[21:16] both in Jerusalem and in Judea and
[21:20] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[21:23] the earth when he had spoken these
[21:25] things while they beheld he was taken up
[21:28] and a cloud received him out of their
[21:31] sight amen let's just bow our heads in a
[21:34] word of Prayer tonight or Jesus how
[21:37] think for we are Oh God for your mercy
[21:40] and grace how thankful we are God for
[21:43] the Holy Ghost we're so thankful God for

[21:48] just it thrills our hearts o god as we
[21:52] Lord are just looking lord to you we see
[21:56] Lord and God the effects of your working
[22:00] Lord in our midst and how we thank your
[22:02] lord for the testimony of brother
[22:04] William Lord and and to know God oh my
[22:07] lord
[22:08] many other testimonies Lord to be given
[22:10] here on Sunday evening or God how our
[22:13] hearts are stirred within us Lord God
[22:16] and father we just ask that now that
[22:18] you'll come
[22:19] Lord and just take us Lord in your word
[22:22] Lord and speak to our hearts O God and I
[22:25] pray that father that your presence
[22:27] would just move among us in a special
[22:30] way tonight O God and Father just that
[22:33] our faith with just so rest Lord in the
[22:36] Eternal Word of God we pray Lord we just
[22:39] ask all these things in the name of
[22:41] Jesus Christ for the glory of God amen
[22:44] amen god bless you as you're being
[22:46] seated I I want to if you'll turn with
[22:50] me to John chapter 3 as well I want to
[22:52] go there and we'll just kind of take
[22:54] this tonight I want to I want to speak
[22:59] on tonight the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:01] but I wouldn't want really what I want
[23:04] to focus on within this and if I really
[23:06] could have a title to it I want to deal
[23:09] with the kingdom is the Holy Spirit in
[23:12] you and this is what I want to deal with
[23:15] we'll see how far we get and and I want
[23:17] to just look at this and lay just laying
[23:20] the things in just what God has done in
[23:23] our midst here within this past week
[23:26] I'll tell you right now I was ready to
[23:29] come to church on Monday you say what
[23:35] were you going to preach they're gonna
[23:36] preach the Bible I mean now I was ready
[23:40] to come to church on Tuesday night you
[23:42] know there's so much that does recognize
[23:45] that within it and you know that that's
[23:47] not anything that is kind of odd with me
[23:50] i you know i've said the different ones
[23:52] I said we just don't have enough
[23:53] services I just feel like there's so
[23:56] much that God just is opening that you
[23:58] seem like you don't have enough services
[24:00] you know to to go through everything I
[24:02] don't know anybody get nervous like oh
[24:04] my he's gonna stack the weak on us but I
[24:06] believe with all my heart that you know
[24:08] what if we can really look at it like
[24:11] like job would say when job would say
[24:13] that I i esteem his food i esteemed the
[24:17] Word of God more than my necessary meat
[24:20] and that's the absolute truth we draw
[24:22] strength from the Word of God and you
[24:25] know with with where God has brought us
[24:28] here within this this past weekend I I
[24:31] just you know many of some of these
[24:33] I was already studying and had on my
[24:35] heart and just begin to move them over
[24:37] you know after the weekend and how God
[24:40] led it I just thought well let me just
[24:42] put on Stinnett some other things on
[24:43] pause and we want to just we want to
[24:45] just nail nail the things down here and
[24:49] just looking at it of what God has
[24:51] already done and and I look at how that
[24:54] you know within the scripture this the
[24:56] coming of the Holy Ghost was a promise
[24:59] that was given clear from the Old
[25:01] Testament that after the Messiah would
[25:04] be offered up this is what this is what
[25:06] the church was to be looking for they
[25:09] were to be waiting on and yet we find
[25:12] that when he came they were not looking
[25:14] for that as a matter of fact they did
[25:16] not look at their lives as though that
[25:18] they needed a change they only looked at
[25:20] it in a manner that when he comes that
[25:23] is just something you know just to bring
[25:24] us on in you know to to the kingdom and
[25:28] what is already here because remember
[25:29] when Jesus would speak to him they let
[25:32] him know very quickly when they went
[25:34] back and they would look at their
[25:35] natural genealogy and they said we are
[25:38] Abraham as our Father and even when they
[25:41] approached John the Baptist remember the
[25:43] Spirit of Truth that was there through
[25:45] John the Baptist he could tell him in
[25:47] that time when they came out to the
[25:48] baptism he said you know who have warned
[25:51] you to flee from the wrath that is to
[25:53] come and you know as they hear they were
[25:55] reasoning within their hearts and John
[25:58] would let him know he would point to the
[26:00] same stones of memorial that was carried
[26:03] out of the Jordan River there when
[26:05] Israel crossed and John would point at
[26:07] those stones that were standing there
[26:09] and say God is able to raise up stones
[26:13] in this place see God has a living
[26:17] witness a living a living reality of
[26:20] what God himself has done they did not
[26:23] see the need that there was needing a
[26:25] change in their life they only went by
[26:27] just a natural stock but Jesus let her
[26:30] know that you know you need to be born
[26:33] again he made it in a statement to let
[26:36] him know that that he who is a servant
[26:38] of sin you your servant but he said the
[26:41] servant does not abide in the house
[26:43] forever but whosoever the Sun is made
[26:46] free
[26:46] is free indeed they needed to be made
[26:49] and free and so when we look at this you
[26:52] know the promise and the scripture
[26:54] brother branham would take it like this
[26:56] and I think it's very very fitting that
[26:58] it would place it in this way brother
[27:00] Brandon would put out three questions
[27:02] when he would go to preach the Holy
[27:03] Ghost series and brother Branham would
[27:05] take it what is the Holy Ghost what it's
[27:07] given for and then he said and then the
[27:10] last the the other service that he would
[27:12] speak on it how do I get the Holy Ghost
[27:14] and how do I know when I have it I'll be
[27:17] honest with you I think that way God
[27:19] moved on Sunday in such a way with such
[27:22] clarity and just to take it from the
[27:25] aspect of to realize that the Holy Ghost
[27:27] you know it's things you always preach
[27:29] but it's just how God has a way of just
[27:32] holding things in and polishing it up
[27:34] because when you look at it the Holy
[27:36] Ghost is never anything that you can
[27:39] merit you do not deserve it it's nothing
[27:42] that you become worthy of it because it
[27:45] is God there's nothing that we can do
[27:48] but it's what God does and I like how it
[27:51] was placed here on Sunday but it is
[27:54] having faith in the very righteousness
[27:56] of God then it's not something that I
[27:59] deserve but it is what God freely gives
[28:02] because the Holy Ghost is not a reward
[28:05] the Holy Ghost is a gift of God it is
[28:09] the promise of God that's given to you
[28:11] and I and even for you and I had to ask
[28:13] for it and to receive it it is because
[28:16] the Holy Ghost has already been dealing
[28:19] with our life to even bring us to a
[28:21] place to actually hunger after that to
[28:23] tell you the truth when you and I were
[28:25] walking out in sin or whether you lived
[28:28] on a church view there was a longing for
[28:30] something that was greater and there was
[28:33] something in your life that you could
[28:35] not explain but there was something that
[28:37] you were desiring and what that desire
[28:40] was that was the very foreknowledge of
[28:42] God there was a seed that was down on
[28:45] the inside that was longing for the
[28:47] waters of life to come to it and raise
[28:50] it up you see it was God that was
[28:53] drawing you and I that's why nothing
[28:55] could satisfy in the world
[28:57] that's why we could not find our place
[29:00] out there no matter what we did there
[29:03] was nothing that was satisfying because
[29:10] there's only one that can satisfy and
[29:13] that is the Lord Jesus Christ you know
[29:16] how it is when you come away from a
[29:18] table after eating when you're satisfied
[29:20] you're satisfied it wouldn't matter what
[29:23] else does that offer you are satisfied
[29:27] that's what the baptism of the Holy
[29:29] Ghost brings in the life of the believer
[29:32] is complete satisfaction it's satisfied
[29:38] now I want to just you know dealing with
[29:42] that even a little more on how do I know
[29:44] when I have it I want to just work here
[29:48] in the scriptures here just a little bit
[29:51] so if you'll just bear with me here
[29:52] we'll see where we get to tonight but in
[29:55] John chapter 3 here is here is Jesus you
[29:58] know brother Branham would lay it out he
[30:00] said this is a fundament this is the
[30:01] most fundamental doctrine here in in the
[30:05] Bible and here you find where one of the
[30:08] Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the
[30:11] Jews he came to Jesus and verse 2 and
[30:13] said unto him rabbi we know that thou
[30:15] art a teacher come from God for no man
[30:17] can do these miracles that thou doest
[30:19] except God be with him and jesus
[30:22] answered and said unto Him verily verily
[30:24] I say unto thee except a man be born
[30:27] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[30:30] that that's to understand it he can't
[30:33] see the kingdom of God
[30:34] Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be
[30:37] born when he is old can he enter the
[30:40] second time into his mother's womb and
[30:42] be born and jesus answered verily verily
[30:45] I say unto thee except a man be born of
[30:48] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[30:51] into the kingdom of God
[30:55] amen that which is born of the flesh is
[30:58] flesh and that which is born of the
[31:00] Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said
[31:03] unto thee ye must be born again the wind
[31:09] look at this and with a wind bloweth
[31:11] where it listeth and thou hearest the
[31:13] sound thereof but canst not tell whence
[31:16] it cometh and whither it goeth so is
[31:19] every one that is born of the Spirit
[31:22] notice this for every one that is born
[31:24] of the Spirit is just like that of the
[31:27] wind it bloweth where it listeth you
[31:30] hear the sound of it but you cannot tell
[31:32] from whence it cometh and whither it
[31:34] goeth your life is a mystery it's
[31:41] nothing that can be placed within the ID
[31:44] logs of man but it is alive that is
[31:48] placed firmly in the Word of God it is a
[31:52] life that is the very mystery of God the
[31:55] Holy Ghost that has taken a hold within
[31:58] your life to where you in yourself
[32:00] cannot even explain what has taken place
[32:03] but you know that something has happened
[32:06] in you hello and no matter what the
[32:14] enemy would try to say you always wind
[32:18] right back to that place of where you
[32:21] have met God on the sacred sands of
[32:24] God's grace that is your white stone
[32:27] that you have been parted you have
[32:30] received that of the name of the Lord
[32:33] Jesus Christ when there was a court
[32:36] there and the court itself when they
[32:38] would actually take in hear all the
[32:40] accusations when a stone itself would be
[32:44] given there to the to the actual one who
[32:47] was being accused and after the court
[32:50] would render its judgment when the court
[32:52] would render its judgment that there is
[32:54] nothing found against this person they
[32:57] would give to that person a white stone
[33:00] with the name in it and it spoke to them
[33:03] you are
[33:04] innocent you are free and you have been
[33:08] made free and are innocent by the blood
[33:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ identified that
[33:15] he has taken your place you know it
[33:20] takes two to make a birth it takes a
[33:24] father and a mother
[33:27] amen this is light when Jesus could say
[33:29] must be born in the water in the spirit
[33:31] you see it's got to be born of the
[33:34] written word confirmed by the spirit you
[33:37] see God brings his word and the word
[33:40] itself what does the word do the word
[33:42] speaks and it draws us it brings
[33:45] conviction to the heart the Holy Spirit
[33:47] brings conviction to the heart the Bible
[33:50] says that man believeth unto salvation
[33:52] and so the Holy Spirit deals with the
[33:54] heart - even that you and I by the gift
[33:57] of God could actually even have faith to
[34:00] believe and then after we believe
[34:02] because you can't get anything from God
[34:04] how do you first believe but then to
[34:06] think how that God would bring that
[34:08] about in our life to where that you and
[34:10] I would believe then this is where Paul
[34:12] could say after he says have you
[34:15] received the Holy Ghost since you
[34:17] believed or having heard the truth the
[34:20] gospel of your salvation after you
[34:22] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[34:25] Spirit of promise
[34:29] glory be to God now let me just go on
[34:32] here just a moment you know there was
[34:35] some times when we look at it you look
[34:37] at the the direction and I uh you know
[34:41] III know just exactly where you know
[34:44] brother Tim when he was dealing with you
[34:45] know you look at some of the earlier
[34:47] messages in 1960 and I just want to call
[34:50] your attention remember he said I can't
[34:51] do away with them earlier messages you
[34:53] remember that when we recognize this how
[34:56] that brother branham brother Bantam
[34:58] himself never got away even though
[35:01] brother Ram at one time he would talk
[35:02] about the being born again and then he
[35:04] would talk about an endowment of the
[35:06] Holy Spirit and power coming but after
[35:08] the seals were open here I know years
[35:10] ago I went through this here but yeah
[35:12] after the seals were open brother
[35:14] branham to begin to understand in the
[35:17] message the token but the RAM said they
[35:18] are one and the same event he would lead
[35:21] it down into the church age book and let
[35:23] us know he said they are one and the
[35:25] same event but you see there has to
[35:27] first be like brother BAM was calling it
[35:29] they're born again there's got to be a
[35:31] belief or a faith first he that cometh
[35:34] to God must first believe that he is
[35:36] right so it see this is where we must
[35:40] have the discernment of the Holy Ghost
[35:42] because it is true we're not throwing
[35:44] anything away there's no message as we
[35:46] throw away
[35:47] it's got to be divinely placed are you
[35:50] with me because there has to be belief
[35:53] within that word and how that God would
[35:55] bring relief to our lives in our hearts
[35:58] now when you you look at this here in in
[36:00] in you know in in that of the new birth
[36:02] and being born again we recognized that
[36:05] within it it's the same God that's
[36:08] coming to work and to move within our
[36:10] myths because I say it to you like this
[36:12] you know some were kind of you know
[36:14] talking to me there and we were
[36:15] fellowship a little bit you know on
[36:16] Sunday evening in other places and and
[36:18] you know that the reality of it is I
[36:20] think that we can all be in agreements
[36:22] there has been way too much and there
[36:24] has been way too much of just simply
[36:27] things being said I believe the message
[36:32] there's been too much to that this just
[36:35] I believe
[36:36] and that's what the Holy Ghost is trying
[36:40] to point out and declare that that is
[36:43] not enough you must first believe but
[36:48] you know as I preached it over the years
[36:49] and of the unveiling of God the Prophet
[36:52] said if you say you believe it and don't
[36:54] live it then you really don't believe it
[36:57] you're only saying you do you see
[36:59] there's got to come one on the inside of
[37:02] your life I'm talking about the a man of
[37:05] God I'm talking about the Holy Ghost of
[37:08] God that is the punctuation in your soul
[37:11] that says I am a believer and it
[37:14] identifies within there that the word is
[37:18] the truth and our hearts desire is to
[37:20] that word it ain't enough just to know
[37:26] the doctrines this is where many times
[37:31] within the statements here of things
[37:33] that's been made that's been made an
[37:35] error where you heard brother Tim and a
[37:37] lot of these things I've kept from you
[37:39] I've not went through them for things
[37:40] that I have free for a few years here I
[37:42] don't even circulate it I don't put it
[37:44] out here in the church I don't do that
[37:46] but yet there's things that I know
[37:48] that's been said and statements that
[37:50] continue to be said that the tapes are
[37:52] the token that is an error that is not
[37:57] the truth that's a life from the pits of
[37:59] hell it closes people to sell short of
[38:04] the blood of Jesus Christ amen of the
[38:07] Prophet would hear he was skinned the
[38:09] hide off of that thing but he don't have
[38:11] to be here the same one who gave the
[38:14] message his residing in that floor and
[38:17] there's a real experience God's got some
[38:20] gate keepers as it speaks in the Book of
[38:23] Ezekiel that will stand in the gate and
[38:26] say there is a true genuine birth have
[38:29] the Holy Ghost
[38:32] hallelujah hey man and huh you know I
[38:36] don't have nothing against anybody but
[38:38] there's some times where these things
[38:40] and how things can be said of just you
[38:43] know well you know we just believe the
[38:45] message and whatever more you see the
[38:47] scripture let let me just use this here
[38:49] for a moment you recognize that Paul
[38:51] when he would talk about that you know
[38:53] you are sealed
[38:54] he said you you are sealed with that
[38:56] Holy Spirit of promise in Ephesians 1 30
[38:59] or 113 in Ephesians 4:30 he would go
[39:02] through that now remember the gospel
[39:04] itself would have to be sounded the
[39:07] gospel would have to go out we find that
[39:10] how then many times we've been were
[39:12] statements of brother Branham made in
[39:14] the message the token and the statements
[39:16] that are made such as you know the
[39:18] message is Christ but you see it takes
[39:22] the Holy Ghost to break that out now I
[39:25] know then I know their spirits don't
[39:27] like that because it looks like you got
[39:30] to come to a man to get understanding
[39:32] but there is only one man you got to go
[39:33] to and that's the man Christ Jesus you
[39:36] got to know the Holy Ghost because the
[39:39] Holy Ghost is a discerner he's the one
[39:42] that rightfully divides the world so to
[39:47] say that the message is cries is to
[39:50] recognize that that life the word has
[39:53] pointed you and I the light that is
[39:55] showing in this hour the message points
[39:58] us to a relationship with the Lord Jesus
[40:01] Christ that's what it calls us to if not
[40:09] anything less is just an organism of man
[40:16] it's got to be the blood of the Lord
[40:20] Jesus Christ and I can't echo it enough
[40:25] of the things that even brother Tim I've
[40:28] stood for that
[40:29] I believe that with all my heart I've
[40:31] had to take I've had to take a stand on
[40:33] those things and it's cost me sometimes
[40:35] but I don't care I love people but
[40:38] friends when you asked me to choose
[40:39] between the Word of God and you I'll
[40:42] take the word Amen there is no one
[40:47] that's to be exalted to the level of the
[40:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[40:53] nobody amen nobody at all how we thank
[40:58] God I thank God for the messenger that
[41:01] he sent through us I thank God for the
[41:03] message but it never came to lead us
[41:06] from the Lord Jesus if it's received
[41:08] right it brings us into a relationship
[41:11] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:17] well let me get to what else wolfy
[41:19] preaching on now understanding the
[41:24] kingdom that's in you brother Brandon
[41:26] says this improving his word I want you
[41:28] to listen to the statement here he said
[41:30] when you understand it you believe it
[41:33] jesus said except a man be born again he
[41:36] cannot see the kingdom in other words
[41:38] understand the kingdom because the
[41:41] kingdom is the Holy Spirit in you so you
[41:45] have to understand what this is in you
[41:50] and the only way you understand it is
[41:54] compare what it makes you do with what
[41:58] the Bible said it would make you do then
[42:01] your problem solved and then he is that
[42:04] Holy Spirit
[42:06] it's like this you get a seed packet and
[42:08] you plate those seeds and say oh boy
[42:11] we're gonna have some good old lettuce
[42:13] here I can just taste the lettuce and
[42:15] tomato and that big ol thick sliced
[42:17] bacon oh my and you go planting them
[42:20] seeds you're looking at the packet that
[42:22] green leaf lettuce you know they put it
[42:24] on there it's got water dripping off of
[42:25] it it just looks so lush and you plant
[42:28] the seeds and when you plant them you
[42:30] don't have green lettuce you end up with
[42:33] red lettuce now when you get to looking
[42:37] at it you're looking at what's coming up
[42:38] and you look at the picture and say that
[42:41] don't look the same you turn it over and
[42:43] the writing that's on there what's
[42:45] coming up does not match the writing so
[42:49] you see when God Himself brings an
[42:52] experience within its life God brings an
[42:54] experience so that that experience that
[42:57] would be so divinely placed in the word
[43:00] so that you're that experience that lets
[43:02] say if the Lord it is placed within the
[43:05] Word of God and it's there that the
[43:07] daffle can't move you off of that now
[43:11] I'm gonna tell you this straight out
[43:13] when you've got the Holy Ghost you can't
[43:15] lose it let's just settle that one right
[43:19] now when you've been sealed you're
[43:21] sealed to the day of your redemption
[43:24] better manna would put it like this you
[43:26] already gone to your eternal destination
[43:28] you see before you've got the Holy Ghost
[43:32] you were a pilgrim and a stranger to the
[43:35] kingdom of God you are of this world but
[43:38] once the Holy Ghost has come that same
[43:41] life that you've been bumping into all
[43:44] your life that you couldn't figure out
[43:46] why this or why that and all of that
[43:48] then finally the Holy Spirit moves down
[43:51] as he deals with your life and he lifts
[43:54] you into that place of that Kingdom that
[43:57] becomes a reality then you become a
[43:59] pilgrim and a stranger to this earth you
[44:03] become a mystic to everybody else
[44:08] and then because we got lights around us
[44:10] I believe that there's times God can
[44:13] show lights around us I know he does
[44:19] that things were people you know they
[44:21] can come over in restaurants or whatever
[44:23] more but Bigard regardless if none of
[44:25] that was done there's a life that ticks
[44:27] out on the inside of us so it is
[44:31] imperative that you understand that
[44:33] you're not leaning to your own
[44:34] understanding any men my ID well you
[44:40] know the devil can try to come and come
[44:42] at you and make you think well that was
[44:44] nothing
[44:44] but you see what when God has done
[44:46] something he can't talk you out of it he
[44:52] cannot take from you what God has given
[44:56] to you
[44:57] no man added to it or taketh away it's
[45:03] what God has done
[45:08] hmm I wish I had about four hours
[45:10] tonight then I might get started with
[45:14] this it's imperative that you understand
[45:16] don't get nervous that you're not
[45:18] leaning to your own understanding but
[45:20] rather to find the place of rest and
[45:22] God's Word that's why the Prophet would
[45:24] Express in the Holy Ghost series you
[45:27] must know what it is what it will do for
[45:29] you and what it is and what it's given
[45:32] for that you that way that you know that
[45:35] you've received it now let me just say
[45:37] this it brings a motion but it's not
[45:40] emotion
[45:42] I wish I could preach on that one a long
[45:43] time maybe Sunday we'll sit down on that
[45:47] it brings emotion brother ban tells us
[45:51] that over and over and over through the
[45:54] message we understand that the Holy
[45:56] Ghost is not emotion the Holy Ghost is
[46:00] the person of Jesus Christ
[46:03] but brother where he's at it's joy
[46:06] Avenue where he's at there are shouting
[46:10] where he's at there is joy unspeakable
[46:13] and full of glory glory be to God so you
[46:21] can't hand me nothing but in any emotion
[46:25] you know I know a person who can say
[46:27] well brother Simon you're just emotional
[46:29] well yeah I am emotional but I'm
[46:32] emotional about the right thing amen
[46:37] I know you know people lack time this
[46:40] preaching I know sometimes people
[46:42] actually take those quotes and they like
[46:44] to run those quotes in the ground well
[46:46] you know you gotta watch what church
[46:47] you're fellowshipping with because you
[46:49] see how the pastor acts the rest of the
[46:51] congregation acts well let's apply this
[46:53] right now would you rather be in a
[46:57] church where a pastor is dead as a
[47:00] doornail and doesn't desire the passion
[47:03] for the Word of God and the presence of
[47:06] God that is my passion
[47:10] I thought you to share in my passion
[47:13] that is my delight that is what I've
[47:17] desire every time we come together the
[47:20] Holy Ghost come right among us
[47:26] [Music]
[47:30] it brings emotion I'm not gonna go
[47:33] through all the quotes on that but
[47:35] brother man would put that in over and
[47:37] over here there's 65 I believe in that I
[47:41] believe you get get alone with God you
[47:43] get the praying don't worry you'll break
[47:45] into another language I don't know you I
[47:48] believe he's the same yesterday today
[47:50] and forever what God put in the church
[47:54] is stealing the church and I'll say it
[47:59] to you like this
[48:00] brother Graham would tell us over and
[48:02] over I'd rather have a little wildfire
[48:04] than no fire at all you condemn heat you
[48:10] can church order Jesus to where he sits
[48:12] with dirty feet I'm not holding back you
[48:17] can do it - he's such a dirty feet
[48:19] everything's got to be this way in that
[48:21] way in everything so uniform I tell you
[48:24] friends it's time to break out of the
[48:25] uniformity it's time to let go and let
[48:29] Jesus have this way so many times people
[48:36] worried about being in order that they
[48:38] need to get loose from that and get out
[48:39] order of their own order
[48:43] samy they're gonna classify you phonetic
[48:46] I don't care I don't care I really don't
[48:49] care I'm not trying to fit into
[48:51] anybody's camp I'm not trying to get
[48:53] into anybody's pulpit it's God's own
[48:58] life coming in you that transforms you
[49:02] from a creature of time to a creature of
[49:05] eternity so then we must as brother
[49:09] Graham tells us they're compared what it
[49:11] makes you do with what the Bible said it
[49:13] would make you do I mean no Paul went
[49:16] down into the deserts of Arabia after he
[49:18] had his experience he went down to the
[49:19] dinner to the deserts of Arabia he
[49:21] wanted to see that experience in the
[49:23] word right
[49:25] you see God will confirm what he has
[49:27] done within the word it's just like what
[49:30] God has sent the message in this hour it
[49:33] is a message that is confirmed by the
[49:36] scriptures it's not outside of the Bible
[49:39] it is confirmed his working in this last
[49:43] day is confirmed in the scriptures and
[49:46] then as it moves in you and I and you
[49:49] and I are in Christ then you and I are
[49:52] placed in the word and this word is
[49:55] confirmed and vindicated through our
[49:57] lives then your problem solved he said
[50:01] that's a Holy Ghost so he says what the
[50:04] person of Christ in you what it makes
[50:06] you do
[50:08] well as I said this is more than believe
[50:10] in every word of God to be true it's
[50:12] more than believing the message is right
[50:13] it's more than believing that brother
[50:15] Branham was a prophet and we believe all
[50:17] those things but it's to identify the
[50:20] working of Christ in your life according
[50:23] to the Word of God in this hour amen so
[50:26] now let me just deal with this just a
[50:28] little bit here the coming of the Holy
[50:31] Ghost
[50:32] you know it's according to the word and
[50:34] it will produce the result of the word
[50:36] in your life you know brother Tim which
[50:40] I appreciated what he shared I
[50:43] appreciated what he shared because you
[50:47] know brother Branham described that it
[50:49] was like filtering rain
[50:52] you know for some it's like fire some of
[51:00] us got electrocuted but then there's
[51:04] others I can go through I've got just a
[51:06] whole study on things it's been four
[51:08] years of things and I've dropped it here
[51:09] and there with you there's times where
[51:11] he can come brother Bram talks about in
[51:12] such a steel form but the brem said it's
[51:17] like that star and when he preached why
[51:20] I think it's why we have seen his stars
[51:23] the one in 63 we have we have seen his
[51:27] star and come to worship Him
[51:29] brother Bama in the latter part of that
[51:30] message brother Brent said old God he
[51:32] said let it be he said like the wise men
[51:35] who saw that star and they followed that
[51:37] star and it passed over every absorb
[51:40] Ettore and nobody knew nothing about it
[51:42] he said God let the star come into the
[51:45] building just now and he said in that
[51:47] steel form he said they pass from death
[51:50] unto life you see it's your experience
[51:57] it's your experience that's exactly
[52:06] right
[52:07] it's your experience that's why they
[52:11] come it I want you to think of this how
[52:13] was so clear there is no set pattern hey
[52:20] man it is personal so that you know and
[52:26] when it happens let me just say like
[52:29] this there's many examples within the
[52:31] message that has taken place where
[52:33] people were going around and you know
[52:35] even different ones you know we're
[52:36] looking like you take sister Bruce
[52:37] sister Bruce asks for the ragam she said
[52:40] brother rammus she said I don't have an
[52:42] experience that I could put my foot on
[52:44] that I got the Holy Ghost so what did
[52:46] brother Adam do he did what I'm doing
[52:48] here tonight he took her to the word he
[52:51] said sister Bruce normally in a person's
[52:54] life you would love the things of the
[52:56] world he sent but no me said normally
[52:59] and naturally that's the way you would
[53:01] be inclined he said but what has
[53:04] happened he said what has happened he
[53:06] said that has changed you that you're
[53:08] not like that
[53:09] she said Christ he said that's your
[53:11] answer that's your answer
[53:15] amen the trans machine because it's his
[53:18] word it's something you can't get away
[53:21] from it's not something you're trying to
[53:23] put on or pretend or make up but it's
[53:26] something that's real on the inside of
[53:29] you I feel like preaching it's God the
[53:39] personal experience with you and even in
[53:41] the refilling of the Holy Ghost I wish I
[53:46] could preach on this one tonight but
[53:50] thank God for the refilling of the Holy
[53:52] Ghost I'll tell you right now has
[53:56] believers I think we realize just how
[53:59] far we've been living beneath our
[54:00] privileges sometimes when we get a
[54:05] little bit of indifferent or this or
[54:07] that I'll tell you what if we don't need
[54:08] to wait to that time to get a refilling
[54:10] but we need to ask God Lord for a
[54:12] refilling a fresh experience every day
[54:14] in our life I'll tell you right now I
[54:18] say this in the name of Jesus Christ I
[54:20] believe this with all my heart
[54:21] that no matter all these things that
[54:23] they have going on out here and these
[54:25] spirits enter a round of oppression and
[54:26] depression and all that I ain't making a
[54:28] lot of nothing like that but friends let
[54:30] me tell you something
[54:31] our real joy and deep satisfaction it's
[54:34] in the Lord Jesus Christ and if we could
[54:36] evaluate and say when's the last time I
[54:39] had a real breakthrough with God then I
[54:41] really set aside I'll tell you right now
[54:43] I believe this with all my heart as he
[54:45] inspires it to my heart right now that
[54:48] God will give you strength and grace and
[54:51] renew the joy of your salvation I
[54:55] believe that with all my heart you must
[54:59] stand on that and believe that
[55:02] amen I believe that this is our
[55:05] god-given rights hallelujah it's the
[55:11] person the Holy Ghost is the person of
[55:14] Jesus Christ coming into our lives
[55:16] that's exactly what it is coming into
[55:19] our lives Amen that quickens that seed
[55:23] it brings it to life there's no other
[55:27] waters can bring it to life amen there's
[55:31] no other waters that can do that but the
[55:34] Holy Ghost amen it's an experience
[55:37] that's founded on the Eternal Word of
[55:40] God that's why our faith would would
[55:43] rest you know the Bible tells us here in
[55:46] Exodus 12 and I'm not going to read long
[55:49] out of this one right here I just want
[55:51] to get get get something here out of
[55:55] Exodus 12 you know God had told him here
[56:00] that in Exodus 12 in verse 5 he told him
[56:03] you you should take a take your lamb
[56:06] shall be without blemish a male of the
[56:08] first year and you shall take it out
[56:10] from the sheep or from the goats and it
[56:13] goes on to say how you to keep it up and
[56:15] and in the congregation of Israel are
[56:17] killing in the evening verse 7 and they
[56:19] shall take of the blood and strike it on
[56:22] the two side posts and on the upper
[56:23] doorpost of the houses wherein they
[56:26] shall eat
[56:29] so what God's asking them to do is take
[56:32] the life of that lamb and let the life
[56:35] beyond the end let the life be the
[56:37] witness you see the life is a witness
[56:41] death has already visited this house
[56:46] hallelujah
[56:48] it's already visited here then it goes
[56:50] on to talk about the eating of that lamb
[56:53] so your eating of that lamb where the
[56:55] life has come now it goes on to let them
[56:57] know here in verse 12 for I will pass
[57:00] through the land of Egypt this night and
[57:02] will smite all the firstborn in the land
[57:04] of Egypt both man and beast and against
[57:06] all the gods of Egypt I will execute
[57:08] judgment I am the Lord and the blood
[57:11] shall be to you for a token upon the
[57:13] houses where you are when I see the
[57:16] Blood I will pass over you and the
[57:18] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[57:20] you
[57:21] when I smite the land of Egypt this was
[57:24] God's covenant promise there was nothing
[57:27] do you realize that the death angel it
[57:30] could come right up outside of that door
[57:32] but it could not cross that boundary it
[57:38] could come right up to it
[57:40] brother brems said it like the holy go
[57:41] he said um pardon me he said the devil
[57:43] he said when that seal is upon your life
[57:46] he said the devil can tease at it he can
[57:48] tease at it he said he can try to make
[57:51] you think you're not sealed and then he
[57:53] takes us right down into the evidences
[57:55] but you see what it is he can tease with
[57:57] that but there is something that is real
[57:59] that seal of the Living God
[58:02] that's there upon your soul and Satan
[58:05] cannot cross that he can get close and
[58:10] try to whisper but he cannot cross that
[58:13] blood line God has already spoken this
[58:19] one belongs to me this one is my
[58:24] firstborn
[58:28] grow a metre gone you see it's where
[58:31] then the token itself is the life of God
[58:35] that life that was within that blood now
[58:38] coming coming now back upon the
[58:42] worshiper you know to think of it I just
[58:44] wanted to stay without going into the
[58:46] types in this in this day and age we're
[58:48] living in but in the hour that we're
[58:50] living and you know Luther and Wesley
[58:53] and even pinnacles it was not the time
[58:56] of the seal of the Holy Ghost but now is
[58:59] the hour where the seal is coming on the
[59:02] body because the seal itself is that
[59:06] which signifies a finished work it's
[59:09] time for the bride body to be sealed
[59:11] away for rapturing grace brother God
[59:17] don't send nobody else to seal you he's
[59:19] the one that seals you it's like when
[59:26] they go to Brandon calves and cows and
[59:27] stuff you know I didn't really know they
[59:29] still did it but when I was up at
[59:31] brother Eugene bran he had a little
[59:33] videos of him and ruther Ron Peterson
[59:35] you know they went out there just for
[59:36] what they called relax and man maybe it
[59:38] would be relaxing I don't know but you
[59:39] know they were out there riding the
[59:40] horses those two and and they were out
[59:42] there you know roping you know the
[59:44] calves calves and things like a they
[59:46] didn't have an interest in it it's just
[59:47] they were doing it for you know it has
[59:48] an outlet so you're a roping these
[59:50] calves you know upon this this roundup
[59:53] and you know here they are bringing them
[59:55] right over to the fire and they have to
[59:57] you know one of them has their horse and
[59:59] they're keeping back that mama cow and
[1:00:01] they bring that one over there to the
[1:00:02] fire they've got that Brander it is
[1:00:05] white-hot and when they take it off that
[1:00:08] fire before that time that calf you
[1:00:11] could look at that calf and there could
[1:00:13] be a lot of arguments about who that
[1:00:15] calf belongs to but once the brand goes
[1:00:19] on that brother the brand comes from the
[1:00:21] fire and once the brand goes on it all
[1:00:24] doubts are settled when the brand goes
[1:00:27] on it it is God claiming what belongs to
[1:00:30] him
[1:00:31] and he impresses his own seal his own
[1:00:34] life his own the image into that calf no
[1:00:37] matter where that calf goes its marked
[1:00:42] put it in this pasture its marked move
[1:00:46] it from this department at the job to
[1:00:48] this department still marked you can't
[1:00:52] get that mark off you don't want to get
[1:00:54] it off you have been branded by the Holy
[1:00:57] Ghost amen
[1:01:07] that blood was on the door was only a
[1:01:10] type there had to come a lamb an
[1:01:13] innocent one that would be offered up
[1:01:16] but then that lamb that lambs blood that
[1:01:19] was offered up would pay the price and
[1:01:21] then when that life in that blood it
[1:01:24] comes back upon you as the worshipper
[1:01:27] and me and it brings us into that blood
[1:01:29] cell so then what we have then as
[1:01:32] brother Branham would play said he said
[1:01:34] you have it
[1:01:34] to where now the judge oh my the judge
[1:01:38] himself has stepped down and become our
[1:01:41] attorney amen we were under the sentence
[1:01:46] of death but I judge became our attorney
[1:01:51] amen his life was shed and now that lie
[1:01:55] the blood was shed and now that life is
[1:01:57] set back upon the worshiper
[1:01:59] listen brother sister for you and I to
[1:02:01] even believe and how that God has dealt
[1:02:04] with our life it has not been us that is
[1:02:06] brought us along when I did this and I
[1:02:08] did this and I did that that is not true
[1:02:11] it is what God has done when the Israel
[1:02:17] comes back into the land for the 144,000
[1:02:21] then God said at that time you will
[1:02:23] recognize me as Jehovah said canoe the
[1:02:26] Lord is our righteousness he is high
[1:02:31] righteousness Amen it's him that gives
[1:02:36] us strength it's him that causes our
[1:02:39] faith to rise within the promise it's
[1:02:44] him that directs our eyes away from
[1:02:46] ourselves like brother Tim was point out
[1:02:50] so good what I can't wait to preach on
[1:02:54] another part on that position in
[1:02:56] practice we might just have to have a
[1:02:59] revival of services here
[1:03:05] but you see that token when it's come
[1:03:08] your fare is paid if the strain ticket
[1:03:12] cost you five dollars when you you have
[1:03:14] got the ticket and that ticket you have
[1:03:17] got the token and what's needed to board
[1:03:20] that train or that airline or whatever
[1:03:23] it is and everything that is there
[1:03:25] belongs to you
[1:03:32] y'all still with me hey this ain't no
[1:03:36] pipe dream I'm preaching
[1:03:43] but some you ever get weary oh I get
[1:03:46] weary but I'm some when I get weary the
[1:03:50] Holy Ghost is my joy we get weary you'll
[1:03:54] get down we get down but listen friends
[1:03:57] what I'm trying to tell you is just if
[1:04:00] you begin to call out to God and ask God
[1:04:03] says Lord restore to me the joy of my
[1:04:06] salvation you may not even be able to
[1:04:09] say it real strong you may not even be
[1:04:12] be able to pray maybe more than five
[1:04:14] minutes but if from your heart let me
[1:04:15] tell you something your heart calling
[1:04:18] out for the Living God
[1:04:19] like David could say I have longed to
[1:04:22] see his power of old then I saw in the
[1:04:24] sanctuary and you have that desire in
[1:04:27] your heart you might not only be able to
[1:04:28] get out one sentence but brother and
[1:04:30] sister what he's listening and looking
[1:04:32] at is your heart's desire and it's your
[1:04:35] heart's desire that draws Jesus on the
[1:04:38] sea now brother branham hearing the
[1:04:43] message desperation and remember he just
[1:04:46] preached this message right after the
[1:04:48] token he's going through the first
[1:04:50] little bit here where he's dealing with
[1:04:52] the token what he just preached in the
[1:04:53] morning listen what he says now he goes
[1:04:56] he says now not just know certain
[1:04:58] evidence he makes that statement because
[1:05:02] when he opened within this he said it
[1:05:04] was likened to you know in the past he
[1:05:06] said it was lacking - just accepting
[1:05:08] Christ as your personal Savior
[1:05:11] in the Methodist said when you get happy
[1:05:13] enough to shout the Pentecostal said
[1:05:15] speaking in tongues you got it and
[1:05:16] brother Graham said we find out that all
[1:05:18] of that is wrong so brother Branham you
[1:05:21] look at he says now not just know
[1:05:23] certain evidence
[1:05:26] you're with me but it is alive that is
[1:05:32] to be founded in the world let me just
[1:05:34] read to you yeah that would just be
[1:05:35] better only you say look at this
[1:05:38] discernment you say brother branham I
[1:05:40] feel it in your mind's he said why will
[1:05:43] I know which we would say how will I
[1:05:45] know how will I know the tokens of what
[1:05:51] how will I know look what you were and
[1:05:57] what you are that is how you know what
[1:06:08] you were and what you are now that's how
[1:06:14] you know what once you humming what was
[1:06:20] you before this token was applied what
[1:06:23] are you after its applied what was your
[1:06:26] desires before and what is your desires
[1:06:30] after then you know whether the token is
[1:06:34] applied or not and these other things
[1:06:36] speaking in tongues and on and on and
[1:06:39] these other things just automatically go
[1:06:42] with that complete package the Holy
[1:06:51] Ghost is not like picking out a car does
[1:06:54] it have power windows I know this is
[1:06:57] like way back in the dinosaur days but
[1:06:59] does it have a tape deck in it or does
[1:07:01] it only have an AM radio in it you know
[1:07:05] I'm saying there's this leather or vinyl
[1:07:09] does it have air-conditioning in it
[1:07:14] brother let me tell you something the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost is still the same it's not a
[1:07:22] downgraded package it is the same
[1:07:25] original package that was torn out on
[1:07:29] the day of Pentecost save power
[1:07:35] amen it's the same person
[1:07:38] the Lord Jesus Christ in this hour you
[1:07:41] see the Scriptures would say it like
[1:07:43] this
[1:07:43] regarding the seal of God it would let
[1:07:46] us know within the Scriptures even in
[1:07:48] when it would express in John 627 labor
[1:07:51] not for meat which Parris's for that
[1:07:53] meat which endureth but for the meat
[1:07:55] that endureth unto everlasting life
[1:07:57] which the Son of man shall give you for
[1:07:59] him hath God the Father sealed
[1:08:04] I'm lujah when he came up out of the
[1:08:07] River Jordan he got branded
[1:08:10] come on somebody he got branded the same
[1:08:14] way it happened there is the same way it
[1:08:17] happens to every son and daughter of God
[1:08:20] God was claiming what belonged to him
[1:08:24] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:08:27] pleased brother Brent said where did the
[1:08:29] Holy Ghost fall in Corinth own sons
[1:08:32] where did it fall on the day of
[1:08:34] Pentecost own sons and daughters see
[1:08:40] this is why
[1:08:40] however the Holy Ghost if it's at if
[1:08:44] it's at an altar let it be in an altar
[1:08:49] come on now if it's at your seat let it
[1:08:52] be at your seat you know the Bible right
[1:08:55] here through the book of Acts I'm so
[1:08:57] glad that was included that way it was
[1:08:59] included that way to let you know there
[1:09:01] ain't no set pattern but it's when the
[1:09:03] heart itself begins to cry out for the
[1:09:06] Living God because we could cry out here
[1:09:08] but brother it ain't here that he's here
[1:09:10] and it's down here on the inside he was
[1:09:14] hearing that asking on the inside that's
[1:09:16] what it was when he went to the house of
[1:09:18] Cornelius and it began to preach the
[1:09:20] word and the Bible says while Peter yet
[1:09:22] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:09:25] them
[1:09:25] you know why the Holy Spirit that was
[1:09:27] there within Peter and Muslim Jim was
[1:09:30] there ministering that word there are
[1:09:32] hearts that were open they were ready to
[1:09:34] move with the word and the Holy Ghost
[1:09:37] it's all within their heart a complete
[1:09:39] obedience in the word are you with me
[1:09:41] now they hadn't even been baptized in
[1:09:44] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:09:46] God already saw their obedience remember
[1:09:49] he gives the Holy Ghost to them that
[1:09:51] obey Him and God looks at the obedience
[1:09:54] of the heart because what's in the heart
[1:09:57] will come out in the actions
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:05] clover be the god this is why he was
[1:10:10] sealed
[1:10:11] remember he let him know I have not
[1:10:14] honor of myself but my father honoureth
[1:10:18] me this is why Paul could say for all
[1:10:25] the promise of second Corinthians 1:20
[1:10:27] for all the promises of God in him are
[1:10:28] yay and in him Amen unto the glory of
[1:10:31] God by us now he which stabbed lathis
[1:10:34] established us with you in Christ and
[1:10:37] hath anointed us is God who has also
[1:10:40] sealed us and given the earnest of the
[1:10:43] Spirit in our hearts Colossians 3:3
[1:10:48] for ye are dead and your life is hid
[1:10:50] with Christ in God when Christ who is
[1:10:53] our life shall appear then shall you
[1:10:56] also appear with him in glory
[1:10:59] so Christianity that token that life
[1:11:03] that new birth it shows wherever you're
[1:11:05] going it don't matter if you go to
[1:11:08] school it don't matter where you work it
[1:11:12] don't matter where it's that it declares
[1:11:14] itself in your life you've been branded
[1:11:19] you've been sealed by the Holy Ghost of
[1:11:22] promise you know the Bible says it like
[1:11:24] this in first Corinthians 12:3 he said
[1:11:26] no man can call Jesus Lord but by the
[1:11:29] Holy Ghost he is the Lord of my life and
[1:11:34] you see as even as we proclaim that our
[1:11:38] lives proclaim that he is the Lord of my
[1:11:42] life he came in and he overthrew all the
[1:11:47] things of the world in my life amen he
[1:11:50] sat down on the throne of my heart he is
[1:11:53] the love of my life and as what we just
[1:11:55] read Christ who is our life he is our
[1:11:59] life
[1:12:01] you see that's why that's why what God
[1:12:05] did on Sunday what he's done in other
[1:12:08] services but loving just Helen in our
[1:12:10] own Sunday it's not something that you
[1:12:13] can just walk away from you know why
[1:12:18] because you've been united you've got
[1:12:24] United with the person of Jesus Christ
[1:12:28] maybe if we suddenly got reacquainted
[1:12:33] Amen revival struck in the hearts and
[1:12:36] said you know what everything else
[1:12:38] nothing else matters he's the love of my
[1:12:41] life that's what matters more than
[1:12:43] anything else you love him
[1:12:48] Oh glory be to God it declares in our
[1:12:53] life that he is the lord of this temple
[1:12:56] oh my you know we're not pretending I
[1:13:02] remember that I said I remember that I
[1:13:06] remember when I was trying to do right
[1:13:10] but I also remember when he came
[1:13:19] I didn't even know what it happened I
[1:13:23] didn't even know what had taken place
[1:13:25] but you know what God would show me
[1:13:28] eventually what had taken place in my
[1:13:31] life but you see the reality was that
[1:13:34] the fruits had come in my life oh go to
[1:13:43] be to God oh he says but once he comes
[1:13:48] it's just as easy to live a Christian
[1:13:50] life as it is to live any life because
[1:13:54] you're in Christ and nothing else but
[1:13:56] just so full of the Holy Spirit it leads
[1:13:58] you guide you and direct you hallelujah
[1:14:05] amen glory be to God Amen hallelujah can
[1:14:13] let me announce to you you have reached
[1:14:15] the point of no return there is no going
[1:14:23] back once you come out of your mother's
[1:14:28] womb in the natural in your first birth
[1:14:31] there's no going back and once you have
[1:14:33] come out of the loins of God's word
[1:14:36] you've been born in the Spirit of God
[1:14:38] there's no going back brother
[1:14:41] you have been born again you've been
[1:14:43] changed by the quickening power of
[1:14:46] Almighty God there's no going back
[1:14:51] greater is He that is in you than he
[1:14:55] that's in the world
[1:14:57] hallelujah glory be to God in the
[1:15:00] highest there's no point of no return
[1:15:08] hallelujah hallelujah will repeat of God
[1:15:13] no longer the same again
[1:15:16] your nature has been changed by the
[1:15:19] power of the Living God amen though we
[1:15:23] had no Christ in the flesh though we
[1:15:27] have known the flesh henceforth we know
[1:15:31] him not after the flesh therefore if any
[1:15:38] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:15:42] old things are passed away behold all
[1:15:46] things are become new
[1:15:49] [Applause]
[1:15:51] you're a creation of the Living God
[1:15:55] always was a son and daughter of
[1:15:59] Almighty God but the Holy Ghost has told
[1:16:03] you he bids you come home the angel of
[1:16:10] the Lord dealt with your heart get with
[1:16:12] my heart he brings us back to himself
[1:16:17] and that Holy Ghost moving down there in
[1:16:21] that life oh it calls a lot it cleans
[1:16:24] that life it feels that life it changes
[1:16:27] that life there's a new outlook on life
[1:16:30] oh the old things are passed away all
[1:16:37] things have become new
[1:16:39] you're a paradox then I said you're a
[1:16:44] paradox then glory be to God it isn't
[1:16:48] what you did it's what he did amen this
[1:16:54] is what Jesus could say I've come that
[1:16:56] you might have life and I come that you
[1:16:58] might have it more abundantly
[1:17:00] oh brother and sister you think it was a
[1:17:04] paradox when they crossed the Jordan
[1:17:06] when they crossed the Red Sea brother
[1:17:08] let me tell you something that was only
[1:17:10] a tight and a shadow of the great
[1:17:12] paradox of the new birth where the Lord
[1:17:15] Jesus himself moves down because every
[1:17:18] time there is sheep born the Shepherd
[1:17:21] on duty he is the chief attending
[1:17:24] physician on duty he gets the dripline
[1:17:29] going hey man
[1:17:32] he gets the dripline going the
[1:17:34] contractions start coming the
[1:17:36] contractions start coming the
[1:17:38] contractions start didn't closer
[1:17:39] together
[1:17:40] everything start getting closer together
[1:17:41] what's happening everything's lining up
[1:17:43] amen amen amen
[1:17:45] and they're getting closer together and
[1:17:47] about that time here it comes fourth and
[1:17:52] then on the certificate of birth brought
[1:17:57] to life by Jesus Christ himself hey hey
[1:18:03] man the chief Shepherd is on duty
[1:18:08] bringing life to his children something
[1:18:14] happened brother Brennan said something
[1:18:15] happened to you that changed your whole
[1:18:17] being and anyone could look at that and
[1:18:20] know what a paradox that is oh my glory
[1:18:24] he said unless that happens you can't be
[1:18:25] a Christian there's got to be a paradox
[1:18:27] for you to be a Christian
[1:18:28] it's a miracle how that God can take a
[1:18:30] man's thinking his ways his life
[1:18:32] everything and change it from what it
[1:18:35] was to what it can be and what he can
[1:18:38] make it
[1:18:46] jesus said through John he said love not
[1:18:52] the world neither the things that are in
[1:18:54] the world
[1:18:55] If any man love the world or the love of
[1:18:58] the father is not in him for all that is
[1:19:01] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[1:19:03] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[1:19:04] is not of the Father but is of the world
[1:19:09] you see it takes God to bring that
[1:19:12] deliverance in that change in our lives
[1:19:15] and he he doesn't baptize us into a
[1:19:20] church he baptizes us into himself and
[1:19:24] he is the word he don't ask us to try to
[1:19:30] understand it he just says believe it
[1:19:33] let me tell you something when the
[1:19:35] prodigal son go I'm getting ahead of
[1:19:37] time now when the prodigal son hear I
[1:19:39] didn't we'll deal with this tonight but
[1:19:40] in the prodigal son come back you see
[1:19:42] there had to be that of the mercy of
[1:19:45] Almighty God his father and you know
[1:19:47] what it would raise him to places he
[1:19:50] never even imagined possible or thought
[1:19:54] that he was deserving of brother let me
[1:19:56] tell you something the Holy Ghost
[1:19:58] it raises you and I to a place that we
[1:20:01] never even thought of we never even
[1:20:03] looked at and can never even brought
[1:20:05] ourselves to deserving of it but you and
[1:20:08] I were like him I have sinned I had come
[1:20:11] short but in the midst of that time the
[1:20:13] father said bring forth the best robe I
[1:20:16] want you to put shoes on his feet I want
[1:20:19] you to put a ring on his finger you
[1:20:22] always a son always a daughter you might
[1:20:28] have went a long time before you could
[1:20:30] be recognized as one but it takes the
[1:20:34] seal of the Holy Ghost to come upon you
[1:20:36] and say this one's mine this belongs to
[1:20:40] me and when he does that it positions
[1:20:43] you in him in the word and you recognize
[1:20:47] yourself dead you are alive in him and
[1:20:49] you are a son and daughter of God let me
[1:20:53] tell you something you don't get a
[1:20:54] little trickle of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:20:57] a full-fledged member
[1:21:11] let me just finish this out here a
[1:21:13] little bit hallelujah
[1:21:20] brother Brown would say like this and
[1:21:22] standing in the gap and I got to read
[1:21:24] this little part here so I can get to
[1:21:25] the last part he said you know he said
[1:21:30] he's the only mediator between God and
[1:21:32] man and we're freely pardon and
[1:21:34] forgiving God don't even know we ever
[1:21:36] sinned our sins were put in the sea of
[1:21:38] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[1:21:40] more we cannot do that ourselves we're
[1:21:42] finite he's infinite and I find that we
[1:21:45] can still remember because we're not big
[1:21:47] enough let me just pause it right here
[1:21:50] if he tries to bring up your past I
[1:21:52] think the word of the Lord already went
[1:21:54] forth here Saturday morning you tack his
[1:21:56] hide with Ezekiel 18 he can't bring up
[1:22:01] anything from the past because once the
[1:22:04] only ghost has come rather your past
[1:22:07] you're not even connected to it I don't
[1:22:14] care what it is that has been done when
[1:22:17] the Holy Ghost has come you know what
[1:22:19] the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost it is
[1:22:21] that of that hidden man in the heart he
[1:22:23] has your years he's there and your life
[1:22:26] and the word are connected together
[1:22:28] there's no longer a breach a chasm
[1:22:31] between you and the word but he has
[1:22:34] spanned that chasm there is no longer
[1:22:36] anything hidden there her cat between
[1:22:39] you and God you have been brought back
[1:22:41] into fellowship with God
[1:22:49] you say wonder what if I make a mistake
[1:22:51] you've got an advocate with the father
[1:22:52] and I ain't even preaching on that
[1:22:55] tonight you see why we need to have we
[1:22:58] need to have a whole month of services
[1:22:59] but I'm sure we'll get to it
[1:23:05] Gloria you know I want to capitalize on
[1:23:07] these things I'm gonna do I'm gonna
[1:23:10] capitalize on let's try let's drive the
[1:23:13] nail down so happy as we're walking
[1:23:14] because let me tell you something I told
[1:23:17] I reminded some on Sunday night and at
[1:23:19] the house
[1:23:20] I said you remember I said years ago now
[1:23:22] that was the back in 2009 or 2010 in a
[1:23:24] youth meeting it was 2009 here it was at
[1:23:27] that time brother Brian he's one of them
[1:23:29] that remembers he was there in that
[1:23:30] youth meaning back in 2009 in my house
[1:23:33] we were upstairs in that floor and I had
[1:23:35] been ministering to them about you know
[1:23:37] moving on into the things of God and
[1:23:39] just really just calling out to God and
[1:23:42] that God would open our eyes of
[1:23:44] understanding and God would you know
[1:23:46] reveal himself we begin to just you know
[1:23:48] those things and then I think it was
[1:23:50] Brian Brian was given a testimony and
[1:23:52] then as he was given a testimony I tell
[1:23:55] you as he was given that testimony
[1:23:56] within that if I recall it correctly
[1:23:57] here all of a sudden within that little
[1:24:00] place in that other house then we were
[1:24:01] living in the Holy Ghost came right down
[1:24:03] in that living room there were some that
[1:24:06] were sitting in chairs they hit the
[1:24:07] floor within that time the power of God
[1:24:10] fell it broke into a prayer meeting I
[1:24:12] mean it was just an all-out prayer
[1:24:14] meeting when we came to out of that I
[1:24:17] don't know how long it was but I told
[1:24:19] him at that time I said from now on
[1:24:21] these youth meetings will never be the
[1:24:23] same
[1:24:25] brother they ain't never been the same
[1:24:27] since then oh we've had a lot of
[1:24:30] opposition then the devil has wanted to
[1:24:32] try to rattle his head here and there
[1:24:34] but I'll tell you what I think God for
[1:24:36] there are young people that say we're
[1:24:38] gonna stand shoulder to shoulder we're
[1:24:40] gonna stand Co to tell and let me tell
[1:24:43] you something right now the same God
[1:24:45] that did that there I believe that and I
[1:24:47] declare that right here for this church
[1:24:50] the church can never be the same
[1:24:54] never be the same brother branham said
[1:25:04] he's so great that he forgets sin we are
[1:25:06] sons and daughters in his presence he
[1:25:08] become your sin that you might become
[1:25:10] his righteousness so he said God cannot
[1:25:13] see no sin in you as long as your
[1:25:15] confession is in Christ Jesus you know
[1:25:17] why because your desire is to please him
[1:25:21] I do only those things which please the
[1:25:27] father now
[1:25:31] brother family let me just let me just
[1:25:32] finish it he said now somebody said to
[1:25:35] me after brother remedy that statement
[1:25:37] if I believed a thing like that
[1:25:39] how would ever I turn the steam on I
[1:25:42] paint the town red I'd go to every
[1:25:45] dancehall I'd get so drunken everything
[1:25:47] for the breath said why
[1:25:50] you're already secured in Christ what
[1:25:54] difference does it make
[1:25:55] he said I told I told that person that
[1:25:58] shows you haven't got it if I really
[1:26:01] okay if I had that kind of Liberty I
[1:26:03] would do this and I would do that but
[1:26:05] you see when real Liberty has come you
[1:26:07] do what you want to do the only thing
[1:26:10] your wants has been changed
[1:26:12] oh yeah glory to God
[1:26:17] if the love of God ever struck your
[1:26:20] heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ
[1:26:22] you would be so in love with him the
[1:26:25] world would be dead as your sin that's
[1:26:28] how you know you have the Holy Spirit
[1:26:30] not because you scream shout speak in
[1:26:33] tongues or whatever it is and we believe
[1:26:35] all that I said we believe all that but
[1:26:38] when sin becomes dead and you're alive
[1:26:41] in Jesus Christ old love of God how rich
[1:26:45] and how pure let's just stop with that
[1:26:50] tonight
[1:26:54] over and over when Jesus when he when he
[1:26:58] come Psalms forty know I come in the
[1:27:02] volume of the book to do that which is
[1:27:03] written to me I delight to do thy will O
[1:27:07] God so here it was a delight the desire
[1:27:12] to do that will have not come down from
[1:27:14] heaven to do mine own but the will of my
[1:27:16] father what you say see the Spirit of
[1:27:20] Truth when he has come the Bible says he
[1:27:24] will lead us into all truth
[1:27:28] he opens and unfolds the word to our
[1:27:31] heart you say no brother Sam I don't
[1:27:36] understand everything that's not what
[1:27:37] we're talking about
[1:27:38] it's where he begins to take the word
[1:27:42] and make it real to you you're a part of
[1:27:46] it he's a part of you
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:53] it's a love-letter
[1:27:57] the Bible says His commandments are not
[1:27:59] Grievous you still how to battle this
[1:28:07] but that's why you gotta have power
[1:28:11] power you're in dude with power from on
[1:28:14] high
[1:28:15] it brings this guy in line
[1:28:21] remember Paul said I die daily is that
[1:28:25] right
[1:28:26] Jesus said that a man should take up his
[1:28:31] cross daily we've got a died to self
[1:28:38] daily but because of that death and that
[1:28:44] life was come then it equips us to
[1:28:48] continue to die to self that he might
[1:28:52] live his life through us
[1:28:55] [Music]
[1:29:03] they ask the chief one time after he got
[1:29:09] the Holy Ghost they asked the chief they
[1:29:12] said chief how you doing
[1:29:15] he said well sometimes me good sometimes
[1:29:21] me do bad so what do you mean well is
[1:29:27] that since we got the Holy Ghost I got
[1:29:30] two dogs I've got a white dog and a
[1:29:34] black dog well chief which one wins he
[1:29:44] said it depends on which one she feeds
[1:29:47] the most now feeding that black dog
[1:29:52] isn't always where isn't always where
[1:29:55] you're feeding it sometimes it's the
[1:29:58] neglect of the white dog give your
[1:30:05] attention to the white dog let him be
[1:30:08] the pick and you see
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:15] as you have that white dog
[1:30:18] you feed it on the things of God now
[1:30:22] this is the way that you'll starve that
[1:30:24] black dog to death don't give place
[1:30:31] to the devil see what do you mean by
[1:30:34] that if he raises his tongue but raises
[1:30:40] his tongue in accusation and he wants to
[1:30:44] raise it as though nothing even has
[1:30:46] transpired or taken place
[1:30:48] I know he can't remove that seal but you
[1:30:51] want to remain our an effective witness
[1:30:55] cast down imaginations you just got all
[1:31:02] excited you call him a liar don't you
[1:31:09] entertain that if there's something that
[1:31:11] comes even by the word something even as
[1:31:14] you're reading your hearing or it is
[1:31:15] something that God comes and he speaks
[1:31:17] to your heart and it challenge your
[1:31:18] heart what do I do take that to God in
[1:31:20] prayer say lord I don't understand this
[1:31:24] but has a son of God or a daughter of
[1:31:27] God lord help me to understand this
[1:31:31] because it's personal between you and
[1:31:33] him let that white dog rise in strength
[1:31:40] don't have nothing to do with the things
[1:31:43] where God has brought you from oh that's
[1:31:45] gone the things of the world has passed
[1:31:49] away feed that white dog think on things
[1:31:54] of a good report meditate on the Word of
[1:31:58] God pray read get into the message get
[1:32:05] into the word the sign I can't figure it
[1:32:09] on it's not about you figuring it all
[1:32:11] out just feed your experience you start
[1:32:17] feeding your experience and pretty soon
[1:32:20] that white dog boy it's more muscular
[1:32:24] than a pit bull in a Rottweiler put
[1:32:26] together it just starts growing their
[1:32:28] muscles pretty soon that old black dog

[1:32:58] would get down or you get discouraged
[1:33:00] you can't deny the life that is in
[1:33:05] it's a living reality it breaks every
[1:33:10] hold every hole is a powder I hope it
[1:33:18] made a little sense tonight you can look
[1:33:22] right there in the word my experience is
[1:33:25] founded in the word it's not emotion but
