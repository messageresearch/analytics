confession you know brother branham he talks about that says don't ever let your confession be negative right but it'd always be positive amen so we we've got something to be positive about and i pray by the grace of god this morning he just helped me to give you some more ammunition and use against the enemy amen we just certainly appreciate being here with you all it's been a little while since we've got to be with you but though we've been absent and body our hearts are with you we pray for the church every day we sure love you and we're glad to be with you once again and uh we've got a confidence i've got a confidence that if i go out of here today and i don't see you again in this life we'll meet each other on the other side of the river amen we just thank god for his mercy for all he's done for us the time would fail if we just stood here just begin to testify about all that god's done in each of our lives but we sure want to be mindful of him and make sure to give him praise let's just bow our heads for word of prayer this morning heavenly father we are so thankful for your goodness to us as the apostle paul said it is the goodness of god that leads us to repentance lord when i think of the life that i used to have in this world i think of the places have been the past that i have the different things in my life that i had no power to overcome lord i had there was a better way there was something greater a goodness of god and mercy but for the least of us for the very worst of us lord you've loved us when we were unlovable lord you saved us when it seemed like we were unsavable father you've done marvelous things it's your work and it's marvelous in our eyes lord i'm standing before people today they're not just another people they're the purchase of the blood of jesus christ lord if i had your your natural chemistry in a little vile today lord i would treasure it more than maybe any other possession and that i have lord and to think what it would mean just to have a couple drops of that blood that was shed for one so unworthy as i look what it would mean to me what what an attachment i would have to it but father to know the life of that blood that the purchase that blood is standing before me even this morning father i just pray you'd come and do which only you can do lord i i'm not worthy to speak to this but none of us are worthy of this morning but by your grace by your mercy by your election lord you've made us able to stand before you to look upon your holy face lord what a what an unspeakable gift you've given unto us i i pray you just come and strengthen and establish and settle each heart here today lord if there'd be one maybe they back slit on your lord maybe they're away from you i pray lord you'd come and restore such one lord forgive us all or we backslide every day the prophet said lord forgive us our sins forgive us our shortcomings lord we're so grateful that your grace is greater than our sin it's your mercy it's greater than our failings lord we love you today we give you praise may you receive all praise now in glory and honor bless the reading of your word we pray and we thank you in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen and amen god bless you as you turn with me this morning in your bibles a couple different places when we look in the book of revelation the third chapter and then we'll be going over to proverbs chapter nine uh the thought i've kind of mentioned on here recently and i just thought it would be by the grace of god i felt like to share it i have a couple prayer cloths here we just uh we'll trust the lord will bless those for the further game's kingdom as well we know that scripture amen so we believe that and i believe that god can do as i say so often the scripture says he can do exceeding abundantly above what we could ask or think many times we limit god with our own imagination amen we say well maybe god can use me this way god can do this he can do more than you can ask or think amen now if you come with an ex a great expectation this morning how much more can he do amen believe that we believe he's faithful revelation the third chapter let's just read verses 12 and 13. now i bookmarked my bible and i didn't even bookmark it in the right place so i don't know what the point of the bookmark was but i think we can get it there uh the scripture says in verse 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god he shall go out no more and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is the new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear to hear let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches amen and uh just to give a context to where i'm looking at this morning by the grace of god we'll turn to proverbs the ninth chapter here proverbs chapter nine we'll just read the first six verses together this morning and uh i know i said that sorry but sure good to see you all by the way just uh man i'm just excited uh god is good all the time amen proverbs chapter nine verse one to six it says wisdom hath builded her house she's hewn out her seven pillars she has killed her beast she hath mingled her wine she has also furnished her table she has set forth her maidens she cries upon the highest places of the city whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated this morning i'd like to take a thought here the house the house of seven pillars amen and this ninth chapter of the book of proverbs when you read for the first nine ten chapters there the book of proverbs dealing with two different kinds of women and it's not speaking of two literal specific women although there's characteristics that could certainly be attributed to different kinds of women but it's a father's instruction to his son about wisdom and folly amen so these uh these these attributes of wisdom and folly they are personified as these women and uh there's so many different thoughts and ideas i'm sure that you could preach on this but what i want to look at this morning and this afternoon as a type is as the body of christ of the churches today and the reason i say that brother branham he makes a statement if you want to know the national status he says you watch israel amen you can look in the middle east today and uh there's so many different pieces of chords being made it's it's in the news all this peace is taking place we know the scripture says when they say peace and safety then sudden destruction comes upon them and so we see that all the pieces nationally speaking they're falling into place for what the lord has prophesied would happen to the gentile kingdoms we know through the vision of the prophet daniel what would happen to these kingdoms in the end time amen so when you look at israel you can see the national status but brother bram says if you want to see the condition of the church you look at the morals of the women he says amen so we and why i say that we look at the morals of the women and we have all kinds of denominations and ideas today but what i want you to understand is except the lord builds the house they labor in vain that build it amen there's many things that man has made and there's many things that man has fostered but those things cannot withstand that evil day amen but there's a there's a bride on the face of the earth and i believe that she's not ordained unto wrath but to obtain salvation through our lord jesus christ i hope you believe you're one of them today amen because i you know you've got you've got church you've got denominational churches today i might just start preaching amen you've got denominational churches today amen and and uh we were just driving by one the other day and they're preaching tribulation they're getting ready for tribulation they're storing up canned goods and they're building bunkers and they're getting ready to go in the tribulation i'm thinking well they're preaching their dangerous message because that's exactly where they're going amen but for you and i that have heard a prophet's message we've heard a voice call us to come up higher that's not where we're building our house we're seeking a city that has foundations whose builder and maker is god god has prepared for us a great way of escape amen so the spirit of god in a bright body the scripture tells you look back in the book of ephesians the second chapter he's building a habitation through the spirit amen that's what i'm talking about at the church about his church not what calls itself church not a man's building his church the prophet says his church is himself revealed and then so this is actually god and unveiling or revealing himself in the body of christ that's why i probably could come along and preach in the rising of the sun that she is now bone of his bone she's flush with his flesh she's warned of his word she is him amen so we look at this this personification of wisdom i believe we can look at it as christ in the bride amen you say now where are you coming with this listen the book this bible tells you it's a bible in the book of proverbs the third chapter the bible tells you about this woman wisdom it says that that her words she's a tree of life to them that lay hold on her amen praise the lord she's a tree of light now the prophet tells you when christ come he hung out tree of disgrace he is that tree of life but he was hanged by the romans on a tree of disgrace that he might die in his resurrection the manifestation that had created a church by the baptism of the holy ghost that could come back on the lives of the people amen and that same church through church ages through denomination through darkness through man's ideas increased it was veiled again it was cut down but the prophet says in the end time at the end of seven church ages the same jesus christ that hung back there on the cross that same tree of life that was manifested there there was a bride tree a bride body that was going to be restored and the restoration of that bride tree he said it is the tree of life restore back to him and then praise the lord someone we don't have to go find eden this morning and find a tree of life to lay hold of it's in our midst today it's the same jesus christ the life of jesus christ he's here in the rock today building his habitation amen praise the lord so it's the spirit of wisdom and revelation the bible says in the knowledge of him that's what's building the church today that's what's building us up today man he's not come to tear us down and when the world's ordained to be destroyed but he's come to lift you up he's come to strengthen and establish and settle you amen that's why the prophet can say that the husband and the wife they though they have a different body it's the self-same spirit amen it's not some second or third or lesser portion of him today the spirit of god the same life that coming across the calvary is here today the same holy ghost that philip pentecost he's here today we're not looking for we're not waiting for it he come to us he revealed to us that he is the same amen the same word that speaks to the bridegroom he speaks of the bride today amen hallelujah listen daniel by vision i mentioned just a moment about daniel by vision he saw this one he was a great stone he was hewd out amen but not by man's hands amen well i'm going somewhere now amen this great stone that would bring in the destruction of the gentile kingdoms it was not heat up by a man's hands god healed this out god brought this to pass amen hallelujah and the same intelligence let me listen to me now the same intelligence that hewed that stone out he's the same intelligence today wisdom hewed her seven pillars he's the same life today doing the same thing he's not pillars today when he built this habitation he said wisdom he got seven pillars to do it amen praise the lord so this spiritual habitation this church that i'm talking about a bride body it's not been fashioned by man's hands i mean we're not flirting with the world today this is the orchestration of god almighty human hands didn't do in your life for you what god has done for you today amen it's not built with education it's not built by philosophy it's not built by creator dogma but the architect of this temple is none other than that same king melchizedek that come to abraham and that same one is today it's built strictly upon and strictly by the revelation of jesus christ amen brother talks about this in the ephesian church age in the church age book he says that the church beginning in the book of accidents god's blueprint for all ages amen now he clarifies remember god's thoughts are not like a man's drawing of a blueprint all right so when he talks about a blueprint he's not talking about well we've got this this thing on paper and it's all a theory it's whole idea and maybe someday and then but god saws their eternal god's thoughts are real so when god laid out his plan i'm getting some i don't know what's popping here amen am i hitting something or well praise the lord i'll just preach through it i guess whatever amen but when god lays out his plan his blueprint for a spiritual habitation he's got seven pillars that are hewed out for this supporting of the structure not just being oh i gotta preface this real quick i'm i'm not a contractor i'm not an architect i'm not a i'm not a builder so anything i say here if i say it and someone's like well you know because there's always something that knows more than you about something so i'm not saying this as a guy that's actually put up pillars before emma but in the prophet talks about this what the pillar does i mean when we talk about a pillar i'm not talking about something decorative right i mean i'm not talking about a wall hanging you've got pillars nowadays and they're decorative pillars and you put them in a house we're not talking a decorative pillar man we're not talking about a pillar that's just there to look at we're talking about a column or a load-bearing structure in other words it's something that the building is built upon that it can't stand without it it's built in a certain way to hold up a certain kind of pressure and then pressure's actually what causes the pillar to have a function it's there to support something it's theirs that when wait and trials and burdens come you can rest on that pillar amen hallelujah and god's got pillars the scripture here we read it he's got seven pillars i don't and god god fashions his pillars not like a vertical column but he fastens them like men right and then he fastens them out of people like you and i hey man i believe god has seven church age messengers that he's built through seven church ages to build the new testament church and the life and the testimony that they had the revelation of jesus christ for their day is what the church is built upon amen he builds them like kind of like michelangelo brother talks about he built that masterpiece hey man listen when michelangelo he took that masterpiece he took that block of marble brother and says and he began to chip away at it i want you to notice he didn't go and get a 3d printer and fabricated out of thin air he didn't get a bunch of stuff and tape it together with a bunch of duct tape and some super glue and then he actually had a big old block there and he didn't have to add anything to it he just had to remove some stuff from the earth that was in the way amen because listen the pillar's got to have the right kind of integrity he'll hold away so you think about michelangelo and i was just reading about this here a few weeks ago when i was looking at this and michelangelo i guess i didn't really realize this until i began to study a little bit but michelangelo when he began to do my uh this this sculpture of moses it wasn't the only sculpture he's doing he actually had a whole uh gallery of them he was actually commissioned to do this over the time the space of 40 years which i thought was remarkable hey man think about that you're getting paid to do one job for 40 years now sometimes you work in a factory this that same thing but this guy's like look i want you to make a masterpiece and i'm going to give you 40 years to do it so here he is he's wheeling these big blocks or however he gets them in there i don't know he might be really strong at all will's these big old box in there and he's got this one sitting there and here is a big old stone you look at it and say well there's just a big old block he said no that's moses hallelujah you might not have seen anything that looked like moses in that block but it was a moses amen and i was reading one of the commentaries about uh this guy who knows a lot more about art than i do but he's talking about the the the the intricacy of the development of moses he's talking about the different folds of his garment how how lifelike he says and he says particularly he says the long glossy beard and the hairs he says they're so difficult to render in scripture yet when you look at this marvel it says it looks so soft and downy he says it seems that the iron chisel had become a brush hallelujah think about this listen if i get a chisel it's going to look like i use a chisel on something but this man he was such an artist he had such a capability to wield this chisel tool it looked like the strokes of a brush when he got done amen and i think of the prophet how he talked about how michelangelo's just rubbing rubbing rubble on that spot you know we just hear that sometimes we just kind of gloss over but i want you to think about this this is over the space of 40 years this man might walk into work one day and he sees the statue of moses he just begins to rub and gets a little 120 out or maybe a little 200 or whatever he begins to sand this thing he might spend all day working on one spot all right listen he might spend a week working on one spot and you and i if we don't know what we're looking for like me we would walk and say it look like he didn't do anything all week i'm paying this guy to make a masterpiece he hadn't done nothing all week oh he's doing something just because you didn't see it doesn't mean he's not doing something hey remember listen he's concerned about the details this man is not just making listen michelangelo was inspired for this masterpiece he was so inspired until he struck it and cried out that it would speak this is more than just a day job of this man amen he's getting paid but to this man it's more than just a job it's more than just putting food on the table he had a recognition my life for 40 years is going to be tied up in this this this sculpture this masterpiece sort of hits more than just a job this is his legacy this is what he's going to be known for if he's ever going to be known for anything this is the thing people are going to look at it they're going to scrutinize it they're going to talk about it they're going to try to imitate it his whole life his artistry his passion was tied up in this masterpiece so he's not willing just to do a halfway job he's not willing to say well i've got it done and pencil whip it trying to get out of the way he said no i'm going to take my time every detail is important to him i want you to understand your life every detail is important to god even when you don't see it sometimes maybe you don't think it's important to god maybe you think god he's not working anymore i want to assure you this morning god's still doing the work sometimes it looks like maybe you're praying for somebody and you say it's been weeks or months or years don't look like god's doing nothing listen he's not in a hurry but he wants to make sure it looks right when he's done that's what he's worried about he trying to send you far from my lost loved one listen he's sending you back some second or third rate job he wants to make sure when that masterpiece is in the gallery when he's got a hall of heroes it looks just right it's going to have the right kind of a testimony he's going to have the right kind of a background you've got to have the right kind of furniture in the spirit in your life sometimes you think god ain't doing nothing god used to do this in my life and god used to do that and where's god in my life it seems like i'm not going anywhere sometimes that's when god's working and just because you can't see it listen he's got a lot better eye for detail than you or i do he sees things in your life you don't even see there's things buried under this humanity you can't even see it you say oh but i'm 50 i'm 60 i'm 70 listen god dealt with moses the man when he was 80 years old don't tell me god's done working on his church today he's not taking a break he's not on vacation his hand is still on the masterpiece today if god took you out of the miry clay if god put your feet on a rock if god called you if god separated you if god brought you here today his hand is still on his masterpiece i want to encourage you today don't ever think god's not doing nothing in your life sometimes he's doing it even when you don't even see it [Applause] oh hallelujah he's gonna take his time he's gonna be just right listen he's not hurt he's been doing this for thousands of years we get in a hurry we get worried well i don't know if it could be what about this and what about he didn't know hey he says you know i've got one masterpiece i've got one shot he's not building a second or third bride he's not saying well i'm gonna toss this one up listen i don't believe that a prophet come and preach this generation for it to all fall away nobody believed it there is some money no matter what the critics say no matter what happens in the government no matter what you go through there's somebody that's going to receive it because god said i'm going to have a church without spot without limits no wrinkles it's going to look exactly the way i had it played out in my mind [Music] listen god's got to get these men put my messengers now he's got to get these men in just the right condition to be pillars in this house because the testimonies of every believer in that age is going to rest on that pillar it's going to rest on that message if they receive it or if they reject it amen now like i said i'm not an architect but to my understanding there's three main things you look at when you get a pillar and you're trying to put this up amen it's gonna be the right kind of material right hey man if you're trying to build a big old house full of marble you're gonna sit there and put some you know something made out of play-doh under there and it's got to be the right kind of material in the first place he's got to choose out bride material he's not going to choose out worldly material or which he wants the denominational material he's looking for bright material to build his house out of it's got to be the right kind of material it's got to be hewed out or shaped down to fit in there and then you don't just take a block and stick it in there it's got to be fitted just right because everything's going to wrestle it's got to be laid in there just right that's the third thing it's going to be in the right position taught my adoption a little bit here this morning he's got to be in the right position when he places that pillar let's say we put a big pillar in the middle of this room we place it there listen if there's even just a little bit of deviation the whole thing is it's subject to fall over so there's got to be a line somewhere there's got to be a plummet somewhere where you can say this is exactly how it's got to lay and the bible tells you this word of god it is a plummet it's got to stay right with the word of god you believe that so there's no room for deviations because it's got to do the job just right now the prophet tells you that paul had a ministry like that he said his manner of ministering he set the pattern for all future messengers that they were inspired he's actually for every true minister i might say this way even for every christian can i say that right i don't i don't think we're called to not bring forth fruit i don't believe we're called to believe air right remember he said he said he said it's a pattern for everybody to follow after he says there's a three-four three-fold quality of that he's at first paul was absolutely true to the word he says he never deviated from it no matter the cost in other words he's got to be right in the right spot amen he said his ministry was in the power of the spirit demonstrating the spoken and the written word that's the right kind of material amen he said he had the fruit or the evident fruit of a god-given ministry amen so this man if i could send this to this pillar in the first church ages messenger he had a threefold quality to him and every other one is built after this because god builds it all the same way amen so he's got a certain pattern laid out there you think of the apostle paul when he meets these men james and peter and john he talks about the book of galatians believes the second chapter he says he met these men and he and they appeared to be pillars he said but these men that appear to be pillars when they recognized the grace that god had extended to him amen they gave their end to fellowship he says that we might go and preach to the gentiles or the uncircumcision let me say it this way they acknowledged his revelation that he was the apostle to the gentiles that was the revelation of christ for their day and then second peter chapter 3 tells you this verse 15 and 16 he says we account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom see there's that wisdom again given unto him written unto you as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things and which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the other scriptures right so even peter's acknowledging this man's epistles are scripture because they wrestle with it like they do the other scriptures amen under their own destruction listen paul was so certain that this ministry was something you could build a church on a man he was so certain about it he said if an angel comes from heaven right now another man comes in if i come if anybody comes and tries to lay something else besides this let him be a curse these men even the apostle paul they recognize this gospel is exactly according to the word of god or the planet so there's no other way to build it there's nothing else to rest it upon amen you could build every other pillar in the same manner as this one and it would do the same thing because it's made of the same kind of material it's cute out the same way it's put in its own position amen amen paul says it this way he knows his own mystery or his own ministry in first corinthians three says the grace that god gave him is a wise master builder all right man praise the lord see today you know most buildings like this building we've got these studs in the walls it's a vertical it's a load-bearing structure amen let me say it this way this is why i'm saying this the building that we're in today would not be standing without it right amen it's not optional it's not decorative it's it's integral to the building and so this pillar is integral to the rest of the building there would be no new testament churches we know it today without the apostle paul's epistles amen it supports the entire structure of it that's why and this is why i say many times people think they have an issue with brother branham and something he preached and said well there because the problem's not really with brother branham it's with the apostle paul amen you know brother man preached against women preachers well paul preached against it he just preached what paul preached well he's got a problem with this uh sort of creating this dogma and this sort of all this other stuff listen he's preaching what paul preached when he goes beyond the current time and that was the very thing he said am i going to be judged we're all going to be judged well even paul's going to be judged so then i'll be all right because i preach what paul preached in other words this message this ministry it's not been on some other foundation it's not laid out as something separate it's built on the very same line the very same foundation that that man the apostle paul built amen listen paul's one that laid out in order for the church and the elders the gifts and all these things it's the apostle paul we would not be here today doing what we're doing without that man's ministry amen praise the lord he says this unto timothy paul says these things i write unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if thou tarry along with thou mayest know how they ought to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth amen i believe this man paul he's preaching this ephesian age his doctrine his life is ministry that set a precedent for each messenger after that amen i was looking through the message and there's three times i found brother brown talks about iranian searches the second church age messenger he says erranus many people would have said well polycarp was the messenger to the second age but brother bram said no it was a rainist do you know why he said polycarp leaned right towards organization see you can't use something that leans as a power but we're interested right with the water if you have not on that leaning whichever way the tree leans it falls amen if you would build on a man that would lean a certain way that's why we've got to be so careful even in our own lives we don't want to lean to our own thought we don't want to lean to our understanding we want to stay right with the word no matter what the word says no matter what it has us to do we want to stay right with it because that's the only thing that's got the right kind of structural integrity to make it out of layer to see amen i think there's three different times he talks about that the prophet says this in the this is the philadelphian church age he says oh what a word he says we have a word for us all the time it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of god use every weapon he has given us i tell you what you've got a closet full of a bunch of machine guns and grenades and everything else and listen if the devil's trying to bust in your home i wouldn't sit there and get out the bb gun i put my night vision goggles on i put my plate carrier on throw some extra ammo in there grab a couple guns throw it on the side i'd let him really have it because i don't want him running off and coming back again i want to end it now listen we've got a lot of weapons and they're not carnal but they are mighty somebody help me out your weapons are not the weak antiquated outdated not capable weapons the weapons of our warfare they are mighty they're able to get the job done you've got stuff that don't flush what you've got can defeat the devil any place anywhere anytime he'd say how do you know because he did it in paul's day he didn't know this day he didn't martin's day and then columbus day and luther's day and wesley's day he did it in the prophet's ministry and listen my god he didn't die in 1965 he's still here today he's been still defeating him hey man this house ain't falling down it don't matter what wins blow it don't matter what trials come it's still on a rock it's got the right material in it you've got the right material in your life to take the pressure he said i won't put anything more on you you can bear why because you're a pillar he's supposed to put some weight on him but she said i don't want god to put weight in my life i don't need this kind of pressure listen that's what keeps it from moving come on now he said if i put him as a pill in my eyes he'll go out no more you can't be moved you can testify like an apostle none of these things move me you couldn't move if you wanted to you're in the building there's things in your life those pressures those trials that we begrudge and we get so frustrated over we get so worked up those are the very things holding you in place he says use every weapon he has given use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy we ought to be happy you're the winners listen the devil's not the winner quit acting like he won but acting like he got one over on you you're the ones at the end of the box yeah you're the ones with dawson he's going into a lake of fire but you're part of the city you're part of the place hallelujah look ahead with joy because you we somebody say we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and the lord of lords now he is not only giving crowns but he says that these in the bride will be made pillars in the temple of god amen he says but what is the temp of god god jesus spoke of his body he says he spoke his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of god but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of god by the holy ghost within us listen paul talks about it says we are the temple of the living god amen now we we use this this we use this verbology or this way of saying it we say we're temples we're actually one temple you as an individual you're a temple when he's taught what paul's talking about says you're the temple singular you are the temple of god by the holy ghost being in you amen he says this now he is going to make the overcomer a pillar in that temple but what is a pillar a pillar is actually a part of the foundation for it holds up the superstructure praise god he says that puts the overcomer right in with the apostles and prophets for it says in ephesians 2 19-22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed listen you're not the you're not some second or you're yeah i'm going to build an addition to this like god didn't think about it he's like well i better add something on here i didn't plan for this you are fitly framed together this is exactly according to his design he's not deviated one bit from it amen he said together it grow up into a habitation it's an inhabitation of god through the spirit yes verse 22 says that we are built together with them everything went through the door jesus and is a part of that body or temple now when god puts a man in the temple as a pillar and makes him a part of the foundation group what is he doing he is giving him the revelation of the word and of himself because that is exactly what the apostles and prophets had matthew 16 17 there he is in the word there he stands no i'm not talking about jesus how about you there he stands there you and i stand no one can get him out see when you find your position in christ nothing can move you out of that you're stuck in the temple you're fitted in there that's why paul can testify these afflictions didn't move him he's actually unable to go out he is a prisoner to that building you know i i don't want to just be a good church member paul was not just a good church member he wasn't just a good guy that sings songs he is a pillar he's a part of the building he's part of the structure amen iranians these men they're part of this structure integral amen they're more than just stories that we tell yeah listen sometimes we're not careful we take this bible we take this gospel we take this message and we're making a bunch of stories this is more than stories to me we get this idea like well here's abraham and here's moses and here's idea isaiah like through these these great men and they're just out there and they're just you know there's something listen these are people just like you and i yeah these are men with backgrounds and mistakes and faults and fails and trials and concerns and heartaches and sickness and affliction they wandered and sheepskins in the deserts they were tormented they were imprisoned they were beaten but the world wasn't worthy of them hallelujah there's something more about their life than their flesh these apostles of prophets god didn't build on their flesh or on their first nature but the revelation of jesus christ in their lives they had a christ-centered life they were prisoners to it amen hewn out hey man didn't have to add something to him the seed was there he just had to be quick and amen didn't have to go find something somewhere the life was in that block you just had to hew it out he went out of lust and affliction and addiction and carnality he went out cut off all that humanity cut off all that first nature until there was a pillar there was something there you could look at that life and like paul he could testify you can follow me as i follow christ there's an absolute there's a lot that's brighter than his humanity amen amen amen what are you getting at listen you've got something if you're a christian today it's greater than your humanity quit looking at your humanity that's the instrument that governs your spiritual well-being that governs who you are that's not who you are that's getting rubbed off that's getting taken out listen this past house it ain't going with you for a reason it's not fit to fit in the building flesh and blood can't inherit this kingdom but there's a life on the inside of you there's a representation by a theophany it's a word-built body that can stand the trials praise the lord there's got to be a healing in our lives amen so many times we're trying to acquire things god's given us everything we need all right hey but can we can we submit to the hands of that great artist that's working on it listen he's not just he's not just taking you and you just have a practical use and that's great but there's more to that you're actually a work of art there's something about your life that maybe you don't see you said we're talking about these other disciples i'm talking about you now for just a minute i'll show you why here because that quote i read he says that if you if you receive the same revelation you become a pillar hallelujah there was the same god that did that to them wants to do it in you if you can submit to it he wants to make a masterpiece out of the story of your life the story of your life is not a story of defeat and bitterness and carnality and wickedness and your past and your failings it's a story about god's redemptive grace to you [Music] [Applause] despite your feelings despite your past despite what you've done the grace of god the mighty hand of that artist his creator probably 20 20 in this election this idea this god's greater amen he don't need excuses michelangelo wasn't sitting there going off this don't turn out in the right way well someone so did this and somebody come and bother me one day and i didn't have the right he didn't make excuses no god don't need an excuse because his word is going to fail he knows it's going to come to pass listen you might be worried about your life i'm not worried about it right amen all right they say mike i probably did this here already once before so i'm not going to do it again but if i asked for a show of hands but how many people in our life how many of you in your life have ever worried about something presumably at least 50 percent of you if not more probably all of you we raise your hands we get worried about things we get distraught about things we get broke up about things could it be is it going to be can it happen god he worked up about it he's actually saying hold still i've got it under control it's actually in my hand listen you're not just in the working process back in the back room somewhere you're the one he's got his hand on you're the bride for today he don't have to go back and work on wesley again he don't have to go back and work on luther well praise the lord amen you're the one he's working on right now this is the finality amen praise the lord brother says that god he takes the very tool of humility yeah what kind of tools does god use for this do you have a big old little jackhammer just whacking pieces off gonna be a little sledgehammer going to town no only two got tools he's got he's got the very tools of weakness and humility and simplicity to work his works with amen god don't need an iron chisel to do this work amen but he's got some tools for you to submit to him amen listen paul you want to talk about circumstances you want to talk about the rock the you know all this and this is not my life listen paul was a pillar all right he could build this church on listen this man saw tarsus didn't look anything like a pillar he looked like the one was going to try and come and tear it down he was a persecutor of the church he looked like some hook nose view with his mouth sideways amen but there was a pillar in that lock listen even in the nights here's another knox i'm 19 this is a christian and he's saying there's no way you're being told tarsus i can't go down there this man's a persecutor of the church god said no there's something in that lung i will gain him to be alive unto the gentiles that's why the prophet says you don't even know who sometimes who it is praying at the altar you see somebody with a past you see somebody with addiction you see some of these problems god says i've got a masterpiece i'm working on it right now [Applause] in your own life you might wonder god's got a masterpiece you're not of lesser quality than the other one you're you're not of a different material than paul or of these other messengers amen you're the same material god's got the same care in your life you're saying well look what god didn't brother branham's life look at what god did these men why did he do it for you why did god have a messenger why would he not allow that man to take his own life why would he not allow that man to fall into the nomination for you it wasn't for the man himself only it was for your sakes [Music] god's wisdom in each age god's wisdom no man's wisdom his wisdom in each age he shoot a pillar out after the same pattern as that first one every overcomer in that ages pattern after that revelation hallelujah so for him that overcometh you too will be a pillar amen this is where i'm going this morning i want you to get out of your thinking these better pillars and that's where god stopped amen well these better pillars that's true god ordained the same for you and i'm amen oh man i really dropped this amen what i'm saying is if you're just looking at someone else's testimony that's what we do if we're not careful as christians we look at somebody else say well there's a pillar in the church there's a pillar this person they're just they're just this rugged they're the staunch they're the strong christian listen that's your testimony amen god ordained that for your testimony you believe that and listen if if if you're always looking at somebody else's testimony and saying that you've actually missed the point the point is can the same testimony be said about you and i'm not saying this to discourage you i'm actually going to encourage you this is what overcomers look like when we think of these examples in the bible they were given for our sakes the scripture says these men and these women in the body they received their little debt to life again they watched the minds of lions be stopped they quench the violence of fire he's not just talking about them he's talking about you listen when george washed across that delaware river i was there amen praise the lord somebody unrepresented when they said that declaration of independence how i was represented in that as an american but listen that's just the spiritual the type but when christ died that day at calvary i actually died in him for the president we that he literally died we must also because that we are literally the righteousness of god in him i died with him that day at cover i laid in that grave for three days but praise be to god praise be to god when he rose up on the third day and he sat down in heavenly places you and i we sat down with him [Applause] god has ordained you not to be the tear he would need you to be the head he didn't ordain you to defeat he were danger to victory the courage and love and ability listen a great price was paid so this masterpiece not just putting a gallery somewhere but he could put it on display and the missing layer to see here that there's a people that despite circumstances despite falsehood despite every other kind of voice there's a bride that's going to believe this word anyway [Applause] he's wanting to put your life on display because he's pleased with his workmanship whether you recognize or not he's pleased with what he's done he's not looking at your life saying well man i made a mistake here i i whacked an arm off here and i i cut this piece off here and i got the wrong kind of material no he he's pleased with his own workmanship listen i get it i'm i'm i'm a human being just like everybody else you probably figured it out sometimes i think to myself well god must just be so disappointed to me he he must just be this and he must be that listen he's not ashamed to be our god he's not ashamed to call you brother there's something in your life greater than your misgivings it's greater than your uncertainty it's what he has done [Applause] it's so for it's so easy for us to look at these other people in the bible say what god did in their life was great we look in the mirror we begin to think well it's not so great it's not so wonderful and it's not so amazing listen god what god is doing in your life what god has done in your life don't ever take that for granted he's fashioning pillars that can handle the pressure they can handle the circumstances you're equipped by the holy ghost through the word of god to overcome this devil to overcome 2020 to overcome your first nature [Applause] praise god his omnipotence is yours what can i do man that submits to god the event says i'm not pretending the question today is not what what can god do what can he do well he can't fail you can't lie and the same god that can't lie and can't fail he called you to be an overcomer what does that speak about your life it speaks better things than what you say about yourself when you get discouraged then what your neighbor says about you or what mommy says or what daddy says or brothers or whoever says this you know he was he was down in i think it was in louisville or louisville you know you can go to louisville or whatever it's called you're gonna ask 10 different people how you say it they give you 10 different answers amen he was down there one day in mordecai hams and he was down this place and they had a breakfast for these preachers you probably know you all know this story but billy grabs at this breakfast he begins to rebuke the lazy preachers he says i come here last year he said i had 30 000 decisions in this meeting he said i come back this year i can't find 30. he said it's the lazy preachers he said that they you know if they weren't lazy they would not do their job that wouldn't happen but the prophet says not to disagree with that man but that's not what it was and what lazy preacher took paul's one [Music] paul might have had one convert amen he might have one person but that man was a stonemason you know how to take a stone and shape it down to fulfill a purpose he said that one paul might come back here later and he's got 30 lar what is it he was fashioned for a purpose hey amen he says we hear tonight about so much decisions what good is stones without a stonemason people wants more members in their church we'll make the decision roll up a stone that's a confession certainly but what good is a stone if there is a stone mason there with a sharp two-edged sword the word of god to shape it into a son or daughter of god to make it fit into the building hallelujah he said we need stone masons listen we've got a lot of entertainers hey man even around the message times we get worried about entertainment we've got a lot of entertainers and a lot of people that can lecture we need stone masons he says we need stone cutters by the word of god to cut confessions into real genuine pillars of the church of god amen hallelujah listen i believe this is why i'm saying this sometimes i think that if we're not careful we you've seen this even around the message sometimes people begin to change how they preach because they want to appeal to more people we need to water the gospel down we need to change what we preach we need to we need to lessen just a little bit because we want to try to get more stones listen you can have all the stones you want if you've got a big old heap of them the size of a tower and don't do no good unless they're shaped down the right way you better off that one and shape it because that'll bring forth 30 more all right amen amen praise the lord amen amen listen spiritual let me say it this way and i hope i can say it's right the right way but spiritual multiplication comes from maturity in the body amen the way we disciple and the way our disciples the character and the discipleship that they have that brings a spiritual multiplication amen even in the natural multiplication comes from a maturity amen so you look at this paul he might have got one but because that man was fashioned as a disciple that's why he'll get 30 more amen so that's why i say this we need to i believe we need to preach the message and when i say that i don't just mean the parts we like the parts that are entertaining we've got to preach this whole counsel of god paul said i'm not shunned to declare unto you the entire council of god because he knew that was the thing that would set you free the only thing that's going to set you free brothers and sisters whatever you're going through today the only thing that can set you free is the truth not a half truth not 99 this word of god can set you free from whatever the enemy's trying to put in your life amen and listen if you've got a pastor if you sit under a ministry where he's a real stone cutter you want to be so thankful because god are doing that for you to bring forth something in your life we're more than just warming up we're more than just wall decorations you've got a gift you've got a purpose you've got a calling god wants to do something not just in my life not just your brother's soul and so his life god wants to do something in your life god wants to do something in your life [Music] thank you lord amen brother benson when you get the holy ghost you just got started oh praise the lord sometimes people they come up to the altar sometimes people get right with the lord think well now all my trials are over no you just signed up in the greatest battle ever but i've got good news for you today you're on the winning side amen you've got a sword that can cut through anything that the enemy will throw at you amen thank you praise the lord how we need men of god how we need some daddies in the home yeah i don't just put on the preacher now amen i only need some daddies in the home how do i need some fifth gospels in the home and they'll sit there and take their children and heal him out by the word of god and tell them the truth even when it's not popular but it's not widely accepted let's tell them the truth because that's the only thing that's going to help them we need some pillars in our homes we need some pillars in our own prayer life we're not just waiting for somebody else to pray us through all the time well so-and-so can pray for me and this person can do this for me you've got a call you've got a gift god can hear your prayer praise the lord listen god wants us to be pillars every son comes to god he's got to be proven that's right we got to make sure he don't buckle under the pressure amen praise the lord now it's one thing to talk about it it's another thing to go through it isn't it you know i was talking to brother the other day and he was going through a certain thing and i was trying to encourage himself you know it's always a lot easier to encourage somebody what's not you going through it funny how that works it's always a lot easier hey man we look you know i'll just use our profit i'll use brother brown's example it's interesting to me how many people like oh i wish i wish i could have done this and i wish i could have seen this vision i just that and i'm thinking you don't know what that man went through or you forgot listen we we know about what he told us on tape let alone what he didn't tell you listen there was a pillar of god come home one day from a fishing trip and he liked to go fishing he'd probably been on a hundred or a thousand fishing trips in his life but one day he'd come home with a piece of paper in his pocket hey man he come home and come to sister hope said look i stopped in this place i met these people they're not ashamed of their religion well i think we've got some of them here today too amen they're not ashamed of their religion they shout and they jump and they dance they're they're they praise god people call a bunch of holy rollers he said that's the cream of the crop [Music] he said look i got a piece of paper i got enough invitations to fill out a year man he was doing really good got more than i got he said he didn't have an ipad or whatever either right couldn't facetime him zoom him he had a piece of paper his pocket from a guy from texas from here from there had enough invitation in his pocket for a whole year amen and they sit down and they begin to count the cross how can we go can we go we go and preach i'm going to go out and preach he said his wife and him sat down they counted up they didn't have enough money to pay the car payment that month he said but you know what she said we're going to we're just going to trust god we're going to go out and we're going to trust god now that would have been a good ending in the story but you see he went and started talking to his mother-in-law start talking to other people about it hey man now now this is just me i just want to throw this in here for a moment this is this is maybe i don't i don't think i'm presuming too much here but when you look at how he he proposed his uh sister hope and how he went talk to her father and and try to talk to the family brother branham was always concerned because he knew he couldn't give her a kind of a lifestyle she'd come from a pretty good home they were well off and he knew he couldn't give that to her with what he had my opinion or my thought is based on what happens that that probably bothered him even throughout his whole life and his whole marriage you see influencing his decision here because he goes and he speaks to his mother-in-law he says i don't want you running around with that trash you need to go get a good job and settle down and pass through that church and take care of that right and what's he do he takes your advice now i'm talking about being a pillar i'm talking about these things for a reason i want you to consider this from brother branham he talks to to her about that she says that and he makes the decision we're just going to stay we're not going to go out and travel we know that that was a mistake but the only reason you and i know that's a mistake it's because he told you i'll let that hang there for just a second the only reason you and i know that's a mistake is because he found out it was a mistake and he tells you on tape you say what are you getting at brother listen he himself and he made the decision he wasn't trying to be disobedient to god amen he didn't say well i'm gonna quit preaching the gospel well i'm gonna compromise my doctrine amen it wasn't that he went and did something altogether sinful or altogether wrong but he didn't seek the mind of the lord god had something greater in mind for him than just to stay there in jeffersonville and the only reason you and i know listen his decision naturally speaking looked right right right that's what i'm coming to now by every natural metric and measurement of it we would look and say he made the right decision and the only reason you and i know that it wasn't is because he found out afterwards he found out he said that's where my trouble started he said my daddy died my brother died then his wife and his daughter died everything began to fall apart in his life and what i want you to realize why i'm saying this listen his decision was not a selfish decision in his own thinking he was trying to listen listen the devil come and do the same thing to you well the bible says if a man can't provide for his own the devil sit right there and try to convince you you're out of the will of god listen you got to take care of your family you got to do this you got to do that hey wasn't that he was gonna stop he just said i'm not gonna go this route with the ministry i'm not gonna do this but that was where he made him his mistake amen the bible says if you seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness he'll add all these things to you amen you say why you say this listen if we're not careful we get too busy looking at the natural oh i got a job and i got a family and i got to take care of this and i got to do that listen you can't take care of yourself anyway you might think you had listen i got a i got a job at a factory here about 10 years ago i was working at the time and i was at my interview and they were interviewing me and of course i i aced the interview because why not right i remember it and i got done and she's doing my english as well we just want to know at this factory he said since this factory has started we've never had one layoff in the entire history of this factory i said that sounds like a pretty good job guess what happened a year later all right we got laid off and i come back i got laid off again he said what are you getting at listen we can try to make all the right decisions we can try to do all that we can take care of ourselves we can take care of our family we can lay out our 401ks we can make all the right kinds of decisions but if we don't seek the will of the lord we'll miss something listen that man he made the decision he made because he loved his wife he loved his daughter and yet his failure love for them was the very thing that cost them their lives what are you getting at bro listen you're feeling love can't save your family you're feeling a love can't make a rapture we rely too much on this humanity we see things going on we get upset we say well i've got to do this and i've got to do that listen you've got to let god do something cause what god wants to do in your life might be the last thing that you're thinking of sometimes god wants more than just good decision making out of us he wants surrender he wants submission he wants preeminence in our lives he's not satisfied just to say well that was a good idea so and so that was a good idea son he's got the first original thought amen and where we get in trouble just like that we think we're doing the right thing it looks like the right thing and it's absolutely contrary to the will of god amen so i can't show you a scripture where he well he you know the bible says those shall not steal he stole hey man but god wanted that man so surrendered oh yeah he want him so submitted to the ministry because he had a purpose there was an angel come told him listen you're going to pray for kings and potentially you can't do that where you're at now god's got to get his attention for you and i sometimes god's got to get our attention and we want to want to go through trials we wonder why we suffer we wonder why we go through rejection why we suffer loss sometimes god's trying to build something up in your life greater than your failure love greater than your humanity amen amen praise the lord sometimes these things gotta rub off just a little bit that's not quite right that don't quite look like what i want to look like i've got to have preeminence in that life think about that brother branham's failure of love caused him to lose the very thing he was trying to protect hey man fellow love has no power to save the lost feel love has no power to deliver it's human instrumentality but god is fashioning a building without human hands god will take things you say well listen i i've made mistakes we all do that i made this mistake as if god didn't somehow know when you that you were going to make a mistake that you made we find out about we're surprised he's like well i know you're going to do that's why i suffered and died for you he not blindsided by nothing amen listen because well i didn't raise my kids the right way or i made this mistake i spoke wrong with this person i've i've went the wrong way listen god can take an iron chisel and wield it like a brush it's never too late for god to do something in your life and say well i went down the wrong path i've gotten away from god i've made so many mistakes you're never too far away from god to take that hand and take his tools listen somebody's sitting here today wrestle that very thing i did this and i've got that i i missed it years ago maybe that doesn't stop god god knew about it he's been working the whole time it's not too late he's not done yet he's still working [Applause] [Music] oh bill you've preached about it you've talked about it why would you call me back you don't even know what you have no idea brothers and sisters we've got no idea what god's got in store for us and then he can do greater things today in your life than he's ever done before what's waiting for you is greater than anything you can lay up on this side there's no house nice enough you can buy there's no car fast enough there's no crossbow nice enough for some recliner whatever it is there's nothing that can compare nothing can't compare [Applause] nothing can compare to what he's laid up for you or not nothing can compare do what he can do in your life i've said it before and i'll say it again you might have spent your whole lifetime maybe you've resisted the will of god maybe you've been his permissive will but god can do more in five minutes than you can do in a lifetime don't put the chains on god this morning let's let god be god let's let him be free here today god you can do it these men in the bible listen what we need today is not just another gimmick not just more information we have transforming power it's able to even change the species it's able to make you look like a different creature that tadpole don't look like a tadpole when he comes out of that new atmosphere he looks like a whole new creature god that'll take even where you're at today even where you're at today god is able to change the situation listen these men in this bible they hazard their lives the scripture says they hazard their lives for this kingdom they put their lives on the line brother bram talks about the the morovian revival and what happened there these two young men these two men they sold themselves oh my we think we've got it rough these two young men sold themselves into a lifetime of slavery to go preach to a group of lost people on an island somewhere they would lay down their lives for this gospel they put everything on the line listen it wasn't because they didn't like domestic life it wasn't because they didn't enjoy comfort but they reasoned they saw something like moses something was greater the reproach of christ is greater than anything the world can give you they preached it because they knew the power of this world to change lives to transform to set free to deliver they were so possessed by that spirit they were so convinced to the lay of our lives on the line they understood this is the only place that life is like peter they understood there's nowhere else to go to listen i don't have some sort of a plan b or some sort of exit strategy i put all my confidence in the lord i threw my anchor behind the veil a long time ago because if he can't put it over nobody can i'm convinced you're young people this morning you're convinced older people you're convinced we're convinced in the power of this word to transform lives transform situations to take the weak and the impotent and the unincapable and turn them into pillars real titans of the face i could ask you all the question today of course we all know what the right answer is would we be willing to lay our our lives down for this message we lay our lives on for this gospel and we'd all raise our hands i hope so anyway if you're willing to die for it or you want to live for it amen don't just live for it let it live in you i mean let it do something in your life it's greater than you've ever let it do before amen he wants to do more let's let's not just be a good church member let's not just tell sir let's be real pillars let's have a testimony on display in our lives you say look in my life in such a way so somebody can look at my life and glorify what god has done don't let my life speak a disappointment fair let it speak of god's ability oh hallelujah listen those men they were an achievement but god unused an achievement this great michelangelo king melchizedek you're his legacy hope you catch that now you're not just a side job like i said earlier you're his legacy you are his crowning achievement [Applause] he's got nothing else on the plate that's more important today than this bride of jesus christ wherever you're at he's gonna make sure you're not you're in the right image amen he didn't ordain you to be the beat up wishy-washy defeated uncertain part of god amen god just like brought the prophet said god's not got big lumpy strong spots here and big weak spots over here it's all god and a spoonful of the water from that ocean it's the same thing as the rest we're called together to be the temple of the living god one temple one body united by the holy ghost amen you're the right kind of material you say what's the right kind of material you're predestinating material he's got good ground to put his seed in but it was a predestinated heart then he went along the way and he might have tucked a lot of stones to the side but he found some stones that he could make abraham see [Applause] he said i'll raise him up out of the very earth i will take the people yeah yeah listen i don't know all your backgrounds but i'm kind of like i look at brother man's life a bootlegger son if coming to the possum kingdom church to be ordered to be uh whatever it was dedicated amen listen that was a nobody to the world but god made him a somebody in the kingdom of god he had a purpose hallelujah my mind god took a bunch of nobodies got to the people that were not a people we were not a people but we are now the people of god we've come like ruth we've made our decision my god will be your god you're going to be my god your people are my people i'm not going to go back to moab i'm not going to run back out to the world there's a kinsman redeemer in israel there's a kinsmen redeemer here today she made her decision rested she served she decided then she rested because he was doing the work hey man amen whether you realize or not you're the best material god had laying on this thing now the thing on the inside of the thing he's getting rid of that he's chipping away but that material on the inside that's the best material listen if god could have built it out of something greater he'd build out of something greater and what the world says that's trash brother ram said that's the cream of the crop let me just say today i'm preaching to the cream of the crop the bride of jesus christ there is no greater people in the face of the earth today than the people i'm standing before this morning i'm not saying that to prop you up and try to you know be your buddy i'm saying because it's the truth there was no greater material that he could find than this thank material lord thank you jesus listen he's just taking you slapping in the building somewhere god is interested in your life yes i am listen let me say that if god is interested in your life hey man because you're part of the building i think many times that's why i'm coming to here i think many times he's more interested in our lives than we are god is actually more interested in your life than even you are sometimes we get in the rut sometimes we we disengage from life and we just get used to things and it becomes common we just well it's always been this way and it's always going to be this way and we become just disinterested god is interested in your lives he is keenly interested in every detail is important to him even the details you don't think are important he thinks they're important he's not left one thing to chance amen if we're not careful we just accept oh this is how it's going to be but god has something amen well this life this is all it is and i'll never be any greater listen god loves you more than that yes amen he proved it caliber he loves you more than that he says i can do more i can be greater in you i can show my strength in you in a greater way than i've ever done it before oh friends let him do something in your life i pray when you go from this place today don't just go back to the world and live any sort of life listen you can have a good testimony you can have a good family we can be greater still i believe for myself i hope you believe for yourself the greatest is yet to come [Music] there are greater things that god can do that our greater works for him to achieve amen let him exceed that's why i prayed that this morning he can do more exceeding abundantly with the things you're going to ask me let him exceed your expectations let him exceed your plans let him destroy your own ideas and give you his own thought amen because this masterpiece in his life it reflects not your ability that's why he's so interested it's not your ability it's his ability he's reflecting listen he's not just glorifying the apostle paul he's not just glorifying william branham he wants to be glorified and you and i amen he wants to do it for you even if you don't feel like he wants to do it he wants to do it more for you than you want him to do it for you amen listen if you can ever get a re if you could ever really get a revelation god wants to use you that just seems so simple but it's true i want you to catch a revelation god wants to use you for something god wants to do something in your life you could ever cast that listen it'll change your whole life because he's looking this afternoon amen you say what's he looking for he's looking his eyes the bible says he's got seven spirits seven eyes is that right seven pillars the bible says the eyes of the lord they're running to and fro throughout the whole earth he's looking for something what's he looking for he's looking for someone to show himself mighty on their behalf he wants to show himself mighty on your behalf not just capable not just good enough for your sake he wants to show himself mighty strong can he be it's a good question in there just how strong is omnipotence just how great is that amen listen whatever his strength is he wants to reveal in you listen up i've seen god i've seen god open the eyes of the blind i've seen the lame walk i've seen devils cast out and that's a great thing when them 70 come back and they're rejoicing jesus said don't rejoice because of that rejoice because your names are in heaven and listen those ones could walk away and then it could be blotted out but there was a peter there there was a pillar there he couldn't even have his name taken out he couldn't go out oh hallelujah what a tremendous thought amen you're the original blueprint you're the original thought you are the thought of god for today made manifest not an afterthought not a second thought not a backup plan you are the original thought he'll not lose one you're the original this is the prophet jeremiah one time he come out and got time i want you to go i want you to prophesy these people and he's like some of us said oh i can't do that i can't do that i'm a child i don't speak well i'm too short i'm too tall i'm too skinny i'm too fat whatever it is you never kind of excuse god i can't do that he said i can't do what you said i'm supposed to do god said oh you can do it before i formed you in the belly your life is not a matter of chance yeah it's not just a bunch of circumstances strung together he said before you were even in the bat i knew you and i ordained you to be a prophet amen god's thought about you has not changed god's plan for you has not changed he knows the plans he has for you amen he told them he told that prophet he said listen i can't preach these people he said don't you be ashamed of their faces don't you be afraid of them he said i'll make you like a brazen wall i'm going to make you like a defense city he said i'll make you like an iron pillar he didn't feel like a pillar but he was an iron pillar there was something in his life he would stand up hallelujah thank you lord hallelujah i want to encourage you this morning god's not ordained you to defeat he's got some iron pillars here you can throw every kind of circumstance at them you can put them through every kind of situation there they're not flexible when it comes to the word they're not swayed by popular opinion they're not moved by the thoughts of men they're iron pillars that don't matter if everybody else walks away you're stuck in your place [Applause] i'm not moving i'm not backing off this one i'm not stepping back i'm not giving one inch to the devil i'm not giving one thought that's the enemy i'm not going to give one thought preeminence [Music] you know what he told jeremiah said i've set you over kingdoms and nations hey man i had somebody that taught me one time you think god's concerned about the outcome of this election i said well i don't know but i do know one thing he's more concerned about you what about this policy what about this stuff he's more concerned about you as an individual he said i've set you over kingdoms and nature that's more important to me all those things they're gonna get wiped away we think we're not important we think god can't use us hey man let's just stand to your feet i don't want you to walk out of here today with a defeated attitude i don't want you to walk out here today and say well that's just for somebody else listen he ordained for this bride to be a pillar amen you ordained something greater for us you just bought your heads for a moment i wonder today in my own life how many times i made casual decisions i made casual decisions about directions in life maybe it wasn't that it was ill thought out maybe i thought about it too much maybe i put too much of me into it there's been times in my life i've been tempted to make decisions because it was beneficial maybe for my child there's times i wanted to maybe do something for them in the natural but i realize i hope you realize today no matter what you've done maybe you made a mistake even [Music] god's got something better for you amen whatever you're going through today maybe you're going through the darkest trial of your life maybe you've prayed and it seems like you just can't find an answer listen i've been there i understand i i'm i'm no better than my father's i'm i'm no different than anyone else i know what it's like to feel like a forsaken orphan's child cry out to god hallelujah it seems like there's just no answer sometimes things seem to go on and you wonder why i think of david he said many are there that say there's no help from me and god many are there that trouble me he said but thou o lord you're a shield for me you're the glory you're the lifter of my head i want to encourage you today bride of jesus christ no matter where you're at god might seem so far away today to you he's here today maybe you don't feel like you thought you would maybe maybe it doesn't seem like things turned out the way they should god's got his hand on you god's got his hand on this bride amen whatever sickness whatever affliction god's got his hand on you let's just lift your hands up say god i believe i believe you've got your hand in me you reach out to him say lord i'm gonna take hold of every promise i'm not gonna let discouragement make my decisions i'm not going to let other people make them for me and gain sayers i'm going to believe what you've spoken about me you've ordained me to be an iron pillar you were named a purpose for me [Music] greater than what gangsters greater than the critics as we pray heavenly father i pray you'd bless these children of god i believe we're writing another book of acts lord these were not men without trials these were not men without circumstances that rose against them but they served a god that was greater than persecution a god that was greater than death and sickness lord i believe you're the same today lord i pray the story of our lives may you just so fit it together he just put the picture together so perfectly as only you can do lord we want to surrender ourselves to it now have your way i pray may you heal the sick and you save the lost deliver the captive today lord for these prayer cloths may they go may spirits be cast out my sicknesses go bear witness today that you are the same lord in us in
