[33:24] so then what happened was that evening
[33:29] we had a head back to Tegucigalpa which
[33:32] is the capital Honduras now I'm changing
[33:35] all this for the glory of God it was
[33:40] night with 11 o'clock and I we couldn't
[33:42] find a place the brothers they went with
[33:44] us they took it didn't have no game not
[33:46] gasoline so we had a head back to the
[33:49] church but that time the pastor stomachs
[33:52] were messed up
[33:54] so they took brother browning in a house
[33:57] made out of Adobe he slept on a mattress
[34:01] they put me in the church and I slept on
[34:03] on the floor and the cement floor and
[34:06] they gave me a little sheet of I think I
[34:08] turned to cover myself it was cold it is
[34:11] it the night progressed it got cold I
[34:13] woke up around 5:00 in the morning
[34:15] my stomach was bothering me so I I went
[34:20] they have an outhouse out there so I
[34:22] went to the outhouse I'm in there when
[34:25] somebody's trying to get in there it was
[34:27] brother J's brownie so I just got out of
[34:30] there and left him so I backed up they
[34:34] were just getting about dawn now when I
[34:37] was leaning against a building and there
[34:40] was a young man under and then went by
[34:43] and I said hello just sit there but
[34:46] leaning against this building when all
[34:48] sudden to my right a supernatural being
[34:50] appeared it was the size of a man it was
[34:54] a man on fire I could see the outline of
[34:56] a man and I just it was just like by the
[35:02] time I came out of that it was daylight
[35:05] but the brownie was in there it was not
[35:07] in there but they came running to get me
[35:09] the American the American so I thought
[35:13] the worst some happened so when I got to
[35:17] the place he was he was trying to get up
[35:18] tell them to let me go they Lord heal me
[35:22] so I told him they let him go and I was
[35:27] wonder what was that supernatural being
[35:30] that I see
[35:31] later on one day I was talking about the
[35:35] brawny Hughes later he said brother bill
[35:37] and I was in there I knew that I had to
[35:41] go to the Capitol and preach and I saw
[35:43] the Lord you brought me here for your
[35:45] children it's an all sudden they're like
[35:48] something with hot wax prayer all over
[35:50] me and the Lord healed brother brownie
[35:52] and he went on to preach a tremendous
[35:53] message there in Tegucigalpa for God is
[35:57] a supernatural God I had a I had a dream
[36:04] the other day with brother brownie first
[36:05] time I had it says he's gone and
[36:08] something happened that I was leaving
[36:11] and I looked outside and there was a
[36:14] window in the Oh me was there she was
[36:17] sitting by the table and awesome but the
[36:19] Browning came to my right and one like
[36:22] this to me assured there was so white
[36:24] anyone liked it and he embraced me that
[36:28] was a dream that I had the other day I
[36:29] say this for the glory of God because

[42:30] have each and every one of you and
[42:32] different ones its visitors are those
[42:35] that might be here god bless you amen
[42:38] just ask that certainly want the Lord to
[42:42] have his way and so good to see CH and
[42:44] every one of you
[42:51] we'll just say it like this when you're
[42:53] not here you're missed you're missed
[43:00] so it's good to see you this morning
[43:02] Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for
[43:07] Solomon except the Lord build the house
[43:10] they labor in vain that build it except
[43:14] the Lord keep the city the watchman
[43:16] waketh but in vain it is vain for you to
[43:20] rise up early to sit up late to eat the
[43:25] bread of Sorrows 4 so he giveth his
[43:28] beloved sleep verse 3 lo children are in
[43:33] heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[43:36] the womb is his reward as arrows are in
[43:40] the hand of a mighty man so are children
[43:44] of the youth happy is the man that hath
[43:48] his quiver full of them they shall not
[43:51] be ashamed but they shall speak with the
[43:54] enemies in the gate amen
[43:57] may God bless you bless the reading of
[43:59] the words your being seated I think they
[44:03] probably already mentioned about Lord
[44:05] willing the fellowship at the depot we
[44:07] certainly love to have each and every
[44:08] one of you if you don't know where
[44:10] that's at there in the restrooms there
[44:12] is also the address that's there you
[44:14] could probably fun punch it in your
[44:16] phone or GPS or find someone that you'd
[44:19] be able to follow out there so when we
[44:22] come in here to look at the Word of God
[44:25] this morning I have some scriptures and
[44:27] things I want to just move into here and
[44:29] just trying to lay a background as we're
[44:32] looking at it and we've been looking at
[44:34] this for some time and we've been
[44:35] talking about this of the arrow and how
[44:37] that God would use the great analogy or
[44:41] comparison as children being as that of
[44:44] of an arrow and we have looked at that
[44:47] of the four parts of an arrow the shaft
[44:49] itself the nock and the fletching and
[44:52] the the actual point or Arrowhead that
[44:57] which would kill we know that within
[45:00] this right here this is what we want to
[45:02] deal with we dealt with the shaft and we
[45:04] want to do a little bit more this
[45:05] morning if the Lord will help us on the
[45:07] fletching itself and when you think of
[45:10] it within that of an arrow of how that
[45:12] God would
[45:13] place this within that of a children and
[45:16] how they are arrows in the hand of a
[45:18] mighty man and God knows exactly what he
[45:22] has determined to be accomplished with
[45:24] each of our lives he knows just what
[45:26] he's accomplished determined to be
[45:28] accomplished within this age the thing
[45:31] of it is is that just as much as God has
[45:33] manifested the promise that is ordained
[45:36] for this hour and for this time God
[45:39] himself has ordained that there is a
[45:41] people in whom that promise will move
[45:44] into and illuminate our lives and that
[45:47] it will absolutely hit the mark
[45:50] everything itself will be right in sync
[45:53] every part of it and when you let think
[45:55] of that and you look at it with an arrow
[45:56] no matter how good a material that an
[45:59] arrow can be no matter how sharp and I
[46:01] really don't have a killing point I've
[46:02] got a field point for target practice on
[46:04] here but no matter how great that point
[46:07] would be and no matter how wonderful the
[46:09] knock would be and no matter how
[46:10] wonderful that the power would be that
[46:12] would be stored up in that bow if you do
[46:15] not have the fletching itself the arrow
[46:18] itself can get ahead of itself so the
[46:21] fletching itself is necessary to keep it
[46:24] the arrow in balance to create what we
[46:27] would call a drag so that the the back
[46:30] of the arrow does not get ahead of the
[46:32] front of the arrow so God knows exactly
[46:34] when we look at in our lives how to keep
[46:37] things so precisely lined up within our
[46:40] lives and that fletching that we're
[46:42] looking at is the actual molding of
[46:44] character within our lives and we know
[46:47] the character itself is not something
[46:49] that actually comes as a as a gift to us
[46:52] but it's something that comes through
[46:53] victory it comes through much molding it
[46:56] comes through much suffering it comes
[46:58] through much sacrifice and it's
[47:00] something that within it you know in
[47:02] order for character itself to be
[47:04] developed it will always require that
[47:07] there is humility that's present and
[47:09] when I look at this the very thought
[47:11] that just so has permeated over my
[47:14] hearts which we started with here the
[47:16] last last week or so is that of dealing
[47:19] with unity because if there if there is
[47:22] no unity then there can be no molding of
[47:24] character
[47:26] a character itself of all the wonderful
[47:28] things of how that our lives are shaped
[47:30] and what I want you to think of it I
[47:32] want you to think of and allow the Holy
[47:33] Spirit to break it down from our lives
[47:36] of how that God would move within our
[47:39] lives in a spiritual level and when we
[47:41] can see that then we know how to apply
[47:43] it within our natural lives because
[47:46] remember as we've said over and over
[47:47] anything that God is asking and
[47:49] requiring of us to do it's because he
[47:52] already has done it so he is faithful
[47:55] he's not just someone who tells us to do
[47:57] something but he shows us how to do it
[48:00] and there's examples and examples
[48:02] through the word and to realize that you
[48:04] know when you think of it many times
[48:05] when we look at this or the fletching
[48:07] you know up here when you you look at
[48:09] this this coloration and these the
[48:11] fletching that's on here there is
[48:13] actually a glue that holds this
[48:16] fletching to this shaft without a glue
[48:19] there would be no holding of the
[48:20] fletching to the shaft there's got to be
[48:22] something that will actually unite it
[48:25] and when you think of it when it comes
[48:26] down to our lives there's got to be
[48:28] before the character of Christ can ever
[48:31] come forth and be molded our character
[48:34] be molded there first has to be a unity
[48:38] so when we look at this and the word I
[48:40] want to just take this just a just a
[48:42] little bit further here this morning and
[48:44] you look in Genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[48:47] because when we look at unity we want to
[48:50] go back and we want to look and trace
[48:52] back and seeing the unity of how that
[48:55] God established it here upon this earth
[48:58] in verse 21 of Genesis 2 the Bible says
[49:02] that the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[49:04] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[49:08] one of his ribs and he closed up the
[49:10] flesh instead thereof and the rib which
[49:13] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[49:16] a woman and brought her unto the man and
[49:19] Adam said this is now bone of my bone
[49:22] and flesh of my flesh she shall be
[49:25] called woman because she was taken out
[49:28] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[49:32] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[49:36] his wife and they shall be one
[49:40] now watch how the Lord Jesus will will
[49:43] continue to pick this up here in Matthew
[49:46] 19 verse 4 and Jesus is asked remember
[49:49] by the Pharisees when they came to speak
[49:53] to him in this moment they are asking
[49:55] him a question not that they themselves
[49:57] might understand their reason of asking
[50:00] a question was to tempt him their whole
[50:03] part of a question was so that they
[50:05] could somehow be able to trap him but
[50:09] notice when they're asking concerning of
[50:11] that of even divorcement and notice the
[50:14] Lord Jesus takes this in verse 4 he says
[50:17] and he answered and said unto them have
[50:19] you not read that he which made them at
[50:22] the beginning made them male and female
[50:24] and he said for this cause shall a man
[50:28] leave father and mother and shall cleave
[50:30] to his wife and they shall Twain be one
[50:35] flesh
[50:37] wherefore they are no more Twain but one
[50:41] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[50:44] together let no man put asunder
[50:48] now here as the Lord Jesus is saying
[50:52] here you have two individuals you have
[50:55] two people when you have that of Adam
[50:58] and then here God taking forth a rib out
[51:03] of Adam what he's already created now
[51:06] remember God has already finished his
[51:09] creation but now after that God reaches
[51:13] in and he sees that it's not good for
[51:16] man to dwell alone and God Himself moves
[51:19] on the scene and he takes a rib from
[51:23] within Adam and he begins to multiply he
[51:26] begins to create and here God is making
[51:30] Adam a bride and he's making Adam a
[51:33] bride from his own substance and then
[51:36] you see how that God would bring here
[51:40] his wife to him and God makes this
[51:43] declaration that how that a man shall
[51:46] leave his father and mother now I want
[51:49] to not dwell on this so much this
[51:50] morning but notice it is a relationship
[51:54] that is already there with father and
[51:56] mother and then notice the correct
[51:59] transition of that relationship is to
[52:02] cleave unto his wife and they shall be
[52:05] one flesh so how can it be that would be
[52:08] we would look at two individuals but yet
[52:11] they are one it's because that same live
[52:14] or that same spirit or their hearts are
[52:18] together in one and to see that how that
[52:22] this is a mystery that even Paul would
[52:25] pick up if I can read it in Ephesians
[52:27] 5:31 and Paul is speaking concerning
[52:30] Christ in the church and he says for
[52:33] this cause shall a man leave his father
[52:35] and mother and shall be joined unto his
[52:38] wife and they too shall be one flesh
[52:42] this is a great mystery but I speak
[52:46] concerning Christ and the church now
[52:50] let's just look at how that the Prophet
[52:52] would take this here and I read this to
[52:54] you last week but I want to move on back
[52:56] into this and watch of even the order of
[52:59] how things are stated in the message
[53:02] oneness he says now when the first man
[53:04] and first woman in the Garden of Eden
[53:07] was in perfect harmony with God so much
[53:11] that God could come down at any time he
[53:14] desired and talked lip to ear with Adam
[53:17] and Eve and this is what I want you to
[53:19] notice they were one with God they were
[53:24] in perfect harmony with God now that is
[53:28] perfect oneness God and His creation God
[53:32] speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve
[53:35] and they were so perfect in harmony with
[53:38] God till they were one with God God and
[53:41] his family was one so hear God remember
[53:46] here when we find that God is moving in
[53:50] creation we no longer find where it's
[53:52] God said and God said and God but it
[53:55] moved to a place of the Lord God had
[53:58] said and we recognized that to be of
[54:02] Jehovah one who exists
[54:04] with his family one because God himself
[54:08] he exists and dwells with his family now
[54:11] think of this any man and his family a
[54:15] correct good noble obedient family is
[54:19] one with another any family and if
[54:22] there's something in the family that
[54:24] moves them apart then it's not right
[54:27] the family's broken somewhere amen
[54:32] they should all be one father with
[54:35] mother mother with father children with
[54:38] parent parent with children all in
[54:41] agreement and when you see that you'll
[54:44] see one lovely picture it's a key point
[54:48] here that father with mother mother with
[54:52] father parents with children and
[54:54] children with parents you see in
[54:56] agreement and unity unity is not just
[54:59] one way but unity is bi-directional
[55:02] unity itself in order for there to be
[55:05] real true unity not to think of this
[55:08] real hue real true unity is where that
[55:13] there is an agreement between both ones
[55:16] there is an agreement and in order for
[55:18] there to actually be an agreement to
[55:20] think about it for you and I in order
[55:22] for there to even be a unity it actually
[55:25] requires you and I to be able to lay
[55:28] aside our own opinions even our own
[55:31] faults about things it actually requires
[55:34] us to be able to lay them aside and how
[55:37] can that be accept that we have a focus
[55:40] that is greater than our own opinions
[55:43] and our own ideas and our own thinking
[55:45] there's got to be something that'll
[55:47] unifies because our own ideas and our
[55:50] own opinions and our own thoughts will
[55:52] never unify us you might be able to line
[55:54] up with this person or that person
[55:55] because they think like you they talk
[55:58] like you may be in their make up their
[56:00] made up just like you but that's not the
[56:03] unity that God is talking about nor is
[56:05] that the unity that the Holy Spirit
[56:07] produces but the Holy Spirit goes way
[56:10] beyond anything that man can do because
[56:13] whatever that man can do to try to bring
[56:15] everything in agreement
[56:17] it will always come back to one thing
[56:18] it's always man that is doing it and
[56:21] whatever man does dog does not accept
[56:24] what man does God will only accept when
[56:28] man submits to what God has done and
[56:30] what God desires to do and that's where
[56:34] a real true agreement and a real true
[56:36] oneness so when we begin to talk about
[56:38] having an agreement and having a oneness
[56:40] the first place that we have to look
[56:43] when we're looking here at the Prophet
[56:44] is telling us it must be a unity and an
[56:47] agreement with Almighty God if we're
[56:50] lined up with God believe me if we will
[56:52] be lined up with one another but in when
[56:55] we see that we're not lined up with one
[56:57] another it shows that there is a link or
[57:00] a brokenness that actually of where that
[57:03] unity needs to be between us and God
[57:05] you're with me many times within a
[57:08] marriage or a family or other things
[57:10] you'll look at how things themselves can
[57:13] come up face they can erupt and you know
[57:15] what so many times the focus is to try
[57:18] to fix this try to fix that trying to
[57:20] look at this but all those things as we
[57:22] said last week I believe are surface
[57:24] eruptions they are things that I believe
[57:27] with all of my heart that God is more
[57:29] than able and does and will do and fix
[57:33] anything that needs to be repaired and
[57:35] it takes God to really bring a harmony
[57:39] and a unity if not it will last it won't
[57:44] last because it's only as strong as your
[57:46] strength is that's right they should all
[57:51] be one now notice he said that's God's
[57:54] purpose and his purpose as father
[57:56] supreme was to be one with this family
[57:59] earthly family Adam and Eve and the only
[58:02] way that they could be one with the
[58:04] family or with God was because God's
[58:06] nature was in them so that made them
[58:10] with God's nature in them then with each
[58:13] other and God they become all one it
[58:18] wonderful you know here we all come into
[58:21] the house of God and you know here we
[58:23] are setting together listening to the
[58:25] word and worshipping the Lord
[58:27] but you realize the real unity and the
[58:29] real oneness is that Christ himself
[58:32] would dwell and reside in every heart
[58:35] and when he resides in every heart as he
[58:39] would dwell there then the very desire
[58:42] of our heart in being united with him
[58:45] then it will work to unite and bring us
[58:48] together with brothers and sisters of
[58:50] like precious faith
[58:52] oh my isn't that a beautiful picture you
[58:57] see it isn't just enough and you
[58:59] understand this this isn't it's not just
[59:01] enough just to come and assemble we're
[59:03] to our saints of God our it's a
[59:05] wonderful thing I believe that you need
[59:07] to be here and hearing the word of God
[59:09] not just because I'm ministering we need
[59:11] to be able to come together and receive
[59:14] admonition edification from the Word of
[59:17] God that God would minister and speak to
[59:20] our hearts but it's not enough just to
[59:22] be a part of this assembly you've got to
[59:24] be a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[59:27] you can't read yourself into that but it
[59:29] actually takes a sovereign word of
[59:32] Almighty God to come down and actually
[59:35] induct you into his body by way of the
[59:38] new birth listen it's wonderful when God
[59:42] will take care of a lot and you say this
[59:44] person don't drink no more this person
[59:46] don't smoke no more they don't run
[59:48] around no more that's wonderful but but
[59:50] the question is have you been United
[59:53] with Jesus Christ you see just because a
[59:56] person don't do that no more does not
[59:58] mean that they have been United with
[1:00:00] Jesus Christ
[1:00:01] that's only a stage within it but has
[1:00:04] Christ Himself become the very love of
[1:00:07] your life is he the very pulsation and
[1:00:10] they put it like this is he the one that
[1:00:13] people see and when people look at you
[1:00:15] they can see Jesus Christ isn't that a
[1:00:22] beautiful picture once again a picture
[1:00:24] God and his family father over all
[1:00:26] supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches
[1:00:28] no nothing just joy unspeakable never to
[1:00:31] be sick never to have a heartache just
[1:00:34] one with God what a picture because the
[1:00:37] very nature of God
[1:00:40] who
[1:00:40] in these people and therefore what they
[1:00:43] did they just followed in line with God
[1:00:46] and God with them made them one notice
[1:00:50] the order they were one with God then
[1:00:53] they were one with one another they
[1:00:56] followed in line with God's Word they
[1:00:59] were waiting they were looking God's
[1:01:01] nature was in them and then as following
[1:01:04] in line with God's Word they were one
[1:01:06] with one another who brought this unity
[1:01:09] God did it was God's desire it's God's
[1:01:13] desire and God's plan for unity that is
[1:01:17] God's achievement then a think of this
[1:01:20] of how that the Lord Jesus himself would
[1:01:22] actually pray for this in John 11 17 and
[1:01:26] then Brandon goes on to say that the
[1:01:28] church we as members of the body of
[1:01:30] Christ would be one together just like
[1:01:32] he and the father are one oh my what a
[1:01:36] union a oneness that would be to see God
[1:01:39] in his church till every member is just
[1:01:43] perfectly in harmony with each other and
[1:01:46] God I say man that's the achievement of
[1:01:50] Almighty God
[1:01:51] the very work of the ministry first of
[1:01:54] all is that we would come to the unity
[1:01:57] of the faith does that mean that we're
[1:02:00] always going to be seeing how do I know
[1:02:02] that's not what the unity of the faith
[1:02:04] is about but the work of the ministry is
[1:02:07] to first bring that unity between Christ
[1:02:10] and his children and then from there
[1:02:14] then there is a maturing the Bible says
[1:02:16] of perfecting which is a completing and
[1:02:19] a maturing by the work of the holy
[1:02:22] spirit on the inside molding and shaping
[1:02:24] our character Oh mom what's that mean
[1:02:29] test trials suffering hmm oh my said
[1:02:40] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[1:02:43] for that's when his prayer will be
[1:02:45] answered that we will be one it's the
[1:02:48] only grounds of fellowship that God has
[1:02:51] ever laid down for himself and his
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] the oneness of himself in the people
[1:02:57] that's the only one it's not just
[1:03:00] gathered around something but it's for
[1:03:02] him to be inside of you it was not
[1:03:07] enough for the disciples just to be
[1:03:09] around the Lord Jesus but remember the
[1:03:11] life that was within him had to come
[1:03:14] back and come inside of them they had a
[1:03:18] fellowship but there had to come that
[1:03:20] life inside of them in order to bring
[1:03:23] about a true oneness that's the only
[1:03:28] grounds of fellowship and the only way
[1:03:30] you can have those grounds is by Union
[1:03:33] to be united with him forever now to
[1:03:35] think of it he goes on it says to be
[1:03:37] united with him and the spirit of his
[1:03:39] power is eternal life you're eternally
[1:03:42] united with God perfectly in harmony
[1:03:45] with him perfectly United together a
[1:03:48] church that all both God and His Church
[1:03:50] is one United together now think of this
[1:03:56] here of how that when we look at in the
[1:04:00] word of how God's desire is that we
[1:04:03] would be united with him we recognized
[1:04:06] that after the fall had taken place
[1:04:08] there within Eden and we see after that
[1:04:11] fall that God's desire is to bring that
[1:04:14] oneness back again and the only way that
[1:04:18] that oneness can come back again I
[1:04:19] remember the Holy Spirit had moved upon
[1:04:22] the prophets Hebrews 1:3 tells us that
[1:04:24] he spake to the father's by or in or
[1:04:27] through the prophets but remember God's
[1:04:30] desire in Redemption is that that same
[1:04:33] life would come and rapture Li live and
[1:04:36] reside inside of our life it would be
[1:04:39] whereby that God's nature would dwell
[1:04:42] with inside of us a union that would
[1:04:44] take place on the inside first by the
[1:04:47] new birth and there's no way that God
[1:04:49] could do this without he himself
[1:04:51] becoming one of us so God creates
[1:04:55] himself a body a blood cell that he
[1:04:58] might step down and become one of us and
[1:05:00] offer up his own life that through and
[1:05:03] by the shedding of the blood that his
[1:05:04] life would pay the
[1:05:06] eyes back then he himself might be able
[1:05:09] to move back into the worshiper now I
[1:05:13] want you to look at this very carefully
[1:05:14] I want you to think of this here as we
[1:05:16] read this scripture and you see of how
[1:05:18] the Lord Jesus is coming to a moment in
[1:05:21] his life he's facing the crucifixion
[1:05:24] he's facing what what his whole purpose
[1:05:26] of his coming was all about his coming
[1:05:30] was to bring redemption for you and I
[1:05:32] whereby the Bible says in the book of
[1:05:35] Romans by one man's adèle disobedience
[1:05:37] we were all condemned but by one man's
[1:05:40] obedience we shall be justified and to
[1:05:43] see how that in his life now watch you
[1:05:46] watch this in his life
[1:05:48] there's nobody couldn't make this
[1:05:49] decision for him nobody could do it he
[1:05:52] couldn't be forced into it it could not
[1:05:54] be something that he was made to do
[1:05:56] unity is not something that you and I
[1:05:59] are made to do but unity itself must be
[1:06:02] a desire that moves within our hearts to
[1:06:05] be united now sometimes we realize how
[1:06:08] the devil will work he'll pervert things
[1:06:10] he'll put things in such a manner where
[1:06:12] people will desire to be united with
[1:06:14] people for the wrong reasons now I'm
[1:06:16] gonna just be very frank with you I want
[1:06:18] to be united with people who love the
[1:06:21] Lord Jesus Christ I don't want to be
[1:06:23] identified with people who believe that
[1:06:26] he is still the same yesterday today and
[1:06:28] forever I love people but I want to be
[1:06:31] identified with people who still believe
[1:06:34] that he's alive I want to be identified
[1:06:37] with him I don't want to just be
[1:06:40] identified with a church I want to be
[1:06:43] identified with him listen to me I don't
[1:06:45] want to just be identified with brother
[1:06:47] Branham I need to be identified with the
[1:06:49] God who sent brother Branham if I'm not
[1:06:53] identified with that that makes no
[1:06:55] difference of how much that I believe
[1:06:57] the Prophet how much that I'll identify
[1:06:59] with all those things I miss the very
[1:07:01] purpose and reasoning of the message
[1:07:04] itself coming in this hour it was to
[1:07:07] bring a real uniting between God and His
[1:07:10] people think the very last paragraph
[1:07:12] right inside the take cover the very
[1:07:15] paragraph in the resume of the church
[1:07:17] age is not for
[1:07:19] one moment do I bring a message that
[1:07:22] people might follow me but I do this for
[1:07:25] one purpose there is one goal one desire
[1:07:28] and that is that there might be a real
[1:07:31] relationship
[1:07:32] a real union between God and His people
[1:07:38] Amen I say exactly the message has
[1:07:41] achieved it
[1:07:42] it is achieving it it is Christ himself
[1:07:46] by way of his word that is bringing
[1:07:49] about this union so we're not just
[1:07:53] rallying around it's not a movement it's
[1:07:57] Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ that's
[1:08:01] who we're rallying around see we're not
[1:08:04] rallying around words we're rallying
[1:08:06] around the person of Jesus Christ now
[1:08:10] notice this watch I'll bet the Lord
[1:08:12] Jesus himself I want you to pay close
[1:08:14] attention to these verses now here the
[1:08:16] Lord Jesus is in John 17 verse 6 and he
[1:08:20] says I have manifested thy name unto the
[1:08:25] men which thou gave us me out of the
[1:08:28] world
[1:08:29] vine they were and thou gave us them me
[1:08:33] and they have kept thy word now notice
[1:08:37] what he's bringing to the attention of
[1:08:40] the Father I have manifested thy name so
[1:08:44] his name the name God's name remember I
[1:08:47] have come in my father's name so the
[1:08:49] name is not just a name a letter but it
[1:08:52] is actually a life that same one that
[1:08:55] when Moses himself was met by God and he
[1:08:58] asked that he might see God remember the
[1:09:01] Bible says that he put Moses in the
[1:09:03] place he covered over there Clift in the
[1:09:05] rock with his hand and he passed by and
[1:09:07] proclaimed the name of the Lord so the
[1:09:11] name of the Lord was actually manifested
[1:09:13] the attributes of this name the word
[1:09:16] itself that was manifested because what
[1:09:19] does a name do a name is that of a
[1:09:22] character or an expression so the Lord
[1:09:24] Jesus himself was standing here
[1:09:26] declaring but I my lie
[1:09:29] is the expression or manifestation of
[1:09:32] that name of the very character of God
[1:09:35] it was not a substitute it was not
[1:09:38] something different it was something
[1:09:40] that was being manifest through his life
[1:09:42] now this is where I want to take you I
[1:09:44] want to take you right here in this
[1:09:46] chapter right here that as parents this
[1:09:50] is where it comes to then we can have
[1:09:52] this testimony I have manifested thy
[1:09:57] name who God to those thou hast given me
[1:10:02] vine they were are you with me you see
[1:10:09] the responsibility the responsibility
[1:10:11] that's laid out here now watch this here
[1:10:14] in verse 11 of that same chapter and now
[1:10:18] I am no more in the world but these are
[1:10:21] in the world and I come to thee Holy
[1:10:25] Father keep through thine old name those
[1:10:29] whom thou hast given me that they may be
[1:10:32] one as we are one now notice the
[1:10:36] intercessory prayer what he's asking for
[1:10:39] is our fellowship mama he's not asking
[1:10:43] that we would be great to grow great
[1:10:45] preachers or great people or this or
[1:10:47] that
[1:10:49] pardon me he's asking for our fellowship
[1:10:54] now did he not have fellowship he did
[1:10:57] have fellowship with them he did you
[1:11:00] know no doubt he had he had fellowship
[1:11:02] he went fishing with them he had all
[1:11:04] sorts of time that he was there with
[1:11:07] them the think about it their lives they
[1:11:10] were out there fishing to collect in
[1:11:12] taxes all those other things but when
[1:11:14] the Lord Jesus the manifestation of the
[1:11:17] word of God the promised notice what
[1:11:20] effect it had it drew them out of
[1:11:22] fishing out of tax collecting did they
[1:11:24] love those things they did but there was
[1:11:27] something that was moving up in their
[1:11:29] lives that was greater than tax
[1:11:32] collecting that was greater than fishing
[1:11:34] what was that was it because he had such
[1:11:37] a eloquence of words now
[1:11:39] it was because there was a manifestation
[1:11:41] of that name that life that was set
[1:11:45] before him and they were ordained to
[1:11:47] that life but listen now as much as they
[1:11:50] were deign to that life
[1:11:51] he noticed God did not just leave them
[1:11:53] float around but the word itself came by
[1:11:56] and began to gather them up and what
[1:11:58] happens they have fellowship with the
[1:12:01] word and yet not one with it through the
[1:12:06] salmon what are you saying that even in
[1:12:08] having fellowship looking at with our
[1:12:10] children and then we look at in our
[1:12:12] congregations and the friends there's
[1:12:14] got to be the word itself manifested
[1:12:17] that will draw people together without
[1:12:19] the manifestation of the word
[1:12:21] we've only got words but it must be
[1:12:24] Christ himself that is manifest and it
[1:12:27] must be that life that name of which our
[1:12:30] families are exposed to hey men that
[1:12:36] they may be one as we are one verse 12
[1:12:39] while I was in the world I kept them
[1:12:45] in thy name that was part of his
[1:12:48] responsibilities they belong to the
[1:12:51] Father but he says you've given to me
[1:12:54] and while I've been here in the world
[1:12:56] I have kept them in thy name glory those
[1:13:01] that thou gave us me I have kept and
[1:13:03] none of them is lost but the son of
[1:13:05] perdition that the scripture might be
[1:13:08] fulfilled and now come out to thee and
[1:13:11] these things I speak in the world that
[1:13:13] they may have joy fulfilled in
[1:13:16] themselves mama mama now think about
[1:13:22] this now
[1:13:23] I want you to listen to how brother
[1:13:25] Graham brings us in the message one
[1:13:28] he says now I don't believe that there's
[1:13:32] any marriage can be what it ought to be
[1:13:34] without a union between husband and wife
[1:13:38] and God now you and I both know I know
[1:13:44] people and no doubt you do I've got
[1:13:46] people in my own family they've been
[1:13:48] married for over 50 some years and yet
[1:13:51] don't dark in a church door and yet they
[1:13:56] have good marriages
[1:14:00] these are principals in God's Word but
[1:14:03] yet it's not what it ought to be the
[1:14:08] only one who can make it what it ought
[1:14:10] to be is that necessary union with God a
[1:14:16] man can try to do everything ever so
[1:14:19] right and a woman can try to do
[1:14:20] everything so right
[1:14:21] and let's just say 50 some years of
[1:14:24] marriage that's a wonderful achievement
[1:14:26] I've commended people that are not even
[1:14:27] believers and I find out how long
[1:14:29] they've been Marisa my what an
[1:14:30] achievement I said man god bless you
[1:14:32] that's a wonderful achievement and you
[1:14:34] recognized that in order for them to
[1:14:35] even be married that long there's had to
[1:14:37] been a lot of give-and-take a lot of
[1:14:41] give-and-take there's been a lot of
[1:14:42] disappointments down through the years
[1:14:43] they disappointed one another but
[1:14:45] there's been something that has held
[1:14:47] them together beyond all their
[1:14:49] disappointments within one another and
[1:14:50] that has had to be a love that they have
[1:14:53] for one another if the world listen
[1:14:57] friends if the world can have that
[1:14:59] people who don't even know God how much
[1:15:02] more can you and I who know him and know
[1:15:05] the promises can we lay there in the
[1:15:08] world and say god this is your word this
[1:15:10] is your promise Lord this is what you
[1:15:13] desire for my life how much more walking
[1:15:21] down the aisle does not make you one but
[1:15:26] oneness itself will be after you walk
[1:15:28] down the aisle after you take the vows
[1:15:31] every day and every moment of your life
[1:15:34] there will be a oneness itself that
[1:15:37] comes to a place to be manifest there
[1:15:41] will be times oh my I know I'm not
[1:15:44] preaching to the choir this morning
[1:15:45] there'll be times when you're trying at
[1:15:48] your very limit but listen you cannot
[1:15:51] focus on mistakes you cannot focus on
[1:15:54] one another's disappointments you've got
[1:15:56] to come back why in the world did you
[1:15:58] come here in the first place why did you
[1:16:01] accept why did well I accepted based on
[1:16:04] this and based on that and based on that
[1:16:05] you know that ain't right you didn't
[1:16:07] accept it based on this and based on
[1:16:09] that it was love it's
[1:16:12] who it had to be love and to think of it
[1:16:16] that love itself is actually what
[1:16:19] conquers and what begins to unite before
[1:16:22] you ever ever ever ever stood here same
[1:16:28] way spiritually in our lives before we
[1:16:31] are ever changed physically there is
[1:16:34] already an invisible union that takes
[1:16:36] place here there has to be a new birth
[1:16:39] on the inside whereby that God Himself
[1:16:41] who will bring forth a body to match
[1:16:43] what he's done on the inside oh ma I
[1:16:46] don't believe there's any marriage can
[1:16:48] be what it ought to be without a union
[1:16:49] between husband and wife and God notice
[1:16:52] what he says they'll bring up children
[1:16:54] in the world
[1:16:54] they'll make illegitimate give them
[1:16:57] cigarettes whiskey play cards in their
[1:16:59] side drink liquor before them no matter
[1:17:01] how loyal they are to their marriage
[1:17:03] vows that sexually that's flesh but
[1:17:06] there's a spirit in there and that
[1:17:08] spirit of a sinner Papa and Mama no
[1:17:10] matter how lawyer to their children will
[1:17:12] come wrong now think of what brother
[1:17:15] Rams just said right here the such are
[1:17:19] the things that he says because they
[1:17:21] will come wrong with not having God to
[1:17:25] be the center and the union of their
[1:17:27] life now he goes through a lot of things
[1:17:29] bring up the legitimates and on and on
[1:17:31] and on and all those things but what
[1:17:33] he's telling us here is that no matter
[1:17:35] were a child what kind of home they come
[1:17:37] from they still have to be born again
[1:17:41] but what he's showing you and I is that
[1:17:43] do within this here that as it goes on
[1:17:46] let me just read the rest of it he says
[1:17:48] I know you say brother Branham I know
[1:17:50] men and women that didn't teach their
[1:17:52] children that and wasn't Christians
[1:17:54] notice I know people that didn't teach
[1:17:56] them to smoke didn't teach them to drink
[1:17:57] you know what I've said before you know
[1:17:59] God got people you work with neighbors
[1:18:01] and whatever more they'll tell their
[1:18:03] kids no no no no no no you don't drink
[1:18:05] no no no you don't smoke you don't smoke
[1:18:07] you don't smoke and they're standing
[1:18:09] with cigarettes in their hands they tell
[1:18:11] their children not to cuss them they
[1:18:13] cuss what are the children supposed to
[1:18:16] do do what you say or do what you do
[1:18:19] what's more powerful will I ask you what
[1:18:24] more powerful God sending Commandments
[1:18:26] or he himself coming down and taking the
[1:18:29] commandments upon himself it was a lot
[1:18:31] more powerful when he himself who gave
[1:18:34] the word he is the image of that word
[1:18:37] and when that image itself was manifest
[1:18:40] and now becomes preeminent our life
[1:18:43] that's more powerful than anything you
[1:18:45] can do or say they're right no matter
[1:18:48] what we do or say it's an image that's
[1:18:51] powerful how many times Paul would say
[1:18:53] over and over in the New Testament and
[1:18:55] he would tell the people remember how we
[1:18:57] behaved ourselves among you he would
[1:18:59] deal with them concerning the image the
[1:19:01] expression of that word and of that
[1:19:03] characteristic
[1:19:04] how many testimonies regarding brother
[1:19:06] branham's life when you have different
[1:19:08] ones you know from Jack Cohen different
[1:19:10] ones and their testimonies that they
[1:19:12] would have concerning brother Branham
[1:19:14] listen the testimonies that they would
[1:19:15] have is a life of Christ that was lived
[1:19:18] among us is that right it wasn't that it
[1:19:23] wasn't because brother Ram was a great
[1:19:25] eloquent speaker it wasn't because it
[1:19:27] was such a depth and such and that
[1:19:28] wasn't what it was they seen Christ on
[1:19:31] display oh my I think that's the thing
[1:19:37] that we have to strive for and no matter
[1:19:39] how how good if we can pronounce every
[1:19:42] word if we've got this just right if we
[1:19:44] know exactly how to finish this quote
[1:19:46] friends listen many of us that maybe
[1:19:48] have a mind that could be you know click
[1:19:50] out and all those things but that means
[1:19:51] nothing the desire that we would have is
[1:19:54] let our lives so be blended with the
[1:19:56] life of Jesus Christ that others would
[1:19:59] see him in us what's this the very thing
[1:20:05] notice he says the very thing of not
[1:20:07] leading them to Christ notice the very
[1:20:10] thing of not leading them to Christ was
[1:20:13] the wrongest thing you like that grammar
[1:20:16] it was the wrongest thing they could
[1:20:19] ever do besides the other not to lead
[1:20:22] them to Christ so person can have ever
[1:20:25] so great morals don't do this don't do
[1:20:28] that don't do that but if you don't lead
[1:20:30] them to Christ that's the worst thing
[1:20:32] you could do
[1:20:34] well how do I lead them it's got to be
[1:20:37] more than you sitting down and
[1:20:38] instructing it's got to take a life
[1:20:41] that's lived before them come on friends
[1:20:44] it takes a life that's live before this
[1:20:47] word this God God sent this word in this
[1:20:49] hour it's not an intellectual word this
[1:20:52] is not a word of intellects it is God
[1:20:55] supernaturally moving through his word
[1:20:59] to vindicate a promise what is it that
[1:21:02] got our attention it is Christ Himself
[1:21:05] becoming preeminent among his people
[1:21:09] Gideon would have remained Gideon but
[1:21:13] God made himself known it took God
[1:21:18] making himself what Gideon had read what
[1:21:21] Gideon knew but now it took God making
[1:21:24] himself real Moses knew about God he
[1:21:28] heard the promises thank God for the
[1:21:30] mama that was rehearsing him but you
[1:21:33] know he had to meet God for himself had
[1:21:38] to meet God for himself so he says you
[1:21:41] can't have a correct union without it
[1:21:45] without Christ the fellowship broken I
[1:21:49] want you to think of this here jesus
[1:21:53] said as we read in John 17 while I was
[1:21:56] in the world I've kept them in thy name
[1:22:00] here he is coming to the end of his
[1:22:03] earthly journey
[1:22:05] let's just say as a parent he's done all
[1:22:08] that he can do he's laid in the word
[1:22:12] he's trained him he's taught him
[1:22:16] there's things remember that even among
[1:22:18] them when they begin to argue whose
[1:22:20] greatest among you he let him know that
[1:22:24] this is my kingdoms not like this he let
[1:22:28] him know that even of remember when John
[1:22:30] himself when others were not receiving
[1:22:33] to them and should we call fire down
[1:22:34] from heaven what did he say at that time
[1:22:36] he said you know know what spirits are
[1:22:38] off see there's there's a training
[1:22:41] there's there is that that it was
[1:22:43] present right there he was keeping them
[1:22:45] in the name Oh glory he was keeping them
[1:22:51] but yet here at this time as he comes to
[1:22:53] the end of his earthly journey he can do
[1:22:56] no more for them at this time but give
[1:23:01] his life I ask you Hasson he gave his
[1:23:06] life all along he did he gave his life
[1:23:10] his life listen the very everything
[1:23:14] concerning his life was being poured out
[1:23:17] on behalf of not only those who were
[1:23:21] gathered there but with the vision that
[1:23:26] you and I and each and every child of
[1:23:29] God that would come because of this
[1:23:31] decision his desire was to be united
[1:23:35] with you and I so he's done his part
[1:23:38] he's kept them in the name of the Lord
[1:23:42] let me just put it like this in other
[1:23:44] words Jesus was not telling the
[1:23:46] disciples if you want to come to church
[1:23:48] come to church if you know it's your
[1:23:50] choice whatever you want to do that was
[1:23:52] not how he conducted but neither did he
[1:23:56] have mandates you see it's such a
[1:23:58] delicate balance and for sometimes and
[1:24:01] reason to understand God's grace does
[1:24:03] not mean looseness there has to be
[1:24:06] direction and guidance for our lives we
[1:24:09] all understand that has to be God that
[1:24:11] dealing with hearts and lives we
[1:24:13] understand that the Lord Jesus knew that
[1:24:16] but remember even within knowing that
[1:24:18] I have kept them in thy name what's he
[1:24:20] doing he's keeping them in the place by
[1:24:23] the promise he's not forcing them he's
[1:24:25] not making them stay around him he's
[1:24:27] keeping them together by the promise
[1:24:31] being manifested in his life one thing
[1:24:41] that I liked I was I wouldn't seen a
[1:24:43] play here back in the summer concerning
[1:24:46] Jesus one thing that I really enjoyed
[1:24:50] about that play I got I got a lot of it
[1:24:51] out a lot out of there but one thing I
[1:24:53] really enjoyed about it is how they
[1:24:55] showed his humanity I really enjoyed
[1:24:58] that I enjoyed that part of it because I
[1:25:00] see how that the Prophet will it will
[1:25:03] interject and put those things in there
[1:25:04] of how even concerning he loved the
[1:25:06] Fellowship of his brother Han he loved
[1:25:09] the sunsets I'll say it like this I
[1:25:12] don't believe that Jesus was a stick in
[1:25:14] the mud
[1:25:15] just kind of say it kind of plain so
[1:25:17] you'll see it I believe that he was one
[1:25:19] that they also enjoyed being around you
[1:25:23] understand me I don't believe they were
[1:25:25] walking on twigs and pencils and needles
[1:25:27] and if I do this I don't believe that I
[1:25:29] believe with all in my heart I believe
[1:25:31] there was a reverence I believe there
[1:25:33] was a respect but I believe there was an
[1:25:35] agreement as far as there was a unity as
[1:25:38] far as what could be at that time Wow
[1:25:43] there hey if there wasn't a unity like
[1:25:45] that then they would have never made it
[1:25:47] to the Upper Room so there had to be a
[1:25:51] unity that was in that time I find it
[1:25:53] remarkable how that the Prophet he's
[1:25:55] asked a question in 1964 what types of
[1:25:58] activities should we allow our pre
[1:26:00] teenage children to participate in if
[1:26:03] you really watch and look in that quote
[1:26:05] you'll find that brother BAM never gives
[1:26:07] a list you can let him do this and let
[1:26:09] him do that and let him do that he
[1:26:10] doesn't but it's something so much more
[1:26:12] greater and so much more profound he
[1:26:14] lets us know that you and I are to be
[1:26:16] there buddy
[1:26:19] you're with me right word to be there
[1:26:23] buddy
[1:26:24] and he said you're to make your home a
[1:26:26] place where they would want to come and
[1:26:30] bring their children now you'd
[1:26:34] understand most of them you know some of
[1:26:35] us you know still have younger kids you
[1:26:38] know buddies with you know Paul's is
[1:26:40] coming up being you know and Zachary but
[1:26:43] you know what buddies don't mean that
[1:26:44] you know even as they were coming along
[1:26:46] from a young age you got a nun remember
[1:26:48] now a buddy it's talking about a
[1:26:50] relationship it does not do away with
[1:26:52] correction you understand when I whipped
[1:26:56] them I wasn't worried about whether they
[1:26:57] love me or not
[1:26:58] I know they love me because I know my
[1:27:00] very desire that was within my heart the
[1:27:03] correction itself was not about
[1:27:05] something that I ate ated me it was
[1:27:07] about something that I looked at and
[1:27:09] said if this isn't curbed out right now
[1:27:12] dear lord what will it be in the future
[1:27:15] that's what grill that's what real
[1:27:18] correction is and see you see even how
[1:27:20] the the budding and all the other things
[1:27:22] a relationship it grows it continues to
[1:27:25] grow between us it continues to move
[1:27:28] with things you know that they enjoy and
[1:27:30] things so that you're able to talk with
[1:27:32] them what I what I'm trying to say is is
[1:27:34] that the Lord Jesus himself there had to
[1:27:36] be a unity as far as what could be at
[1:27:40] that time that would lead up to a unity
[1:27:43] whereby God himself would come by the
[1:27:46] surrendering of that life does that make
[1:27:50] sense oh my let me go on notice in
[1:28:01] Zechariah 13 verse 7 the Bible says
[1:28:06] awake o sword against my shepherd and
[1:28:08] against the man that is my fellow saith
[1:28:10] the lord of hosts smite the Shepherd and
[1:28:13] the Sheep shall be scattered and I will
[1:28:17] turn my hand upon the little ones
[1:28:21] this was necessary whereby that God
[1:28:26] himself would actually turn his sword
[1:28:33] upon his only beloved son that here
[1:28:37] would be an offering up that's made for
[1:28:39] you and I now notice God is not worried
[1:28:42] here the shepherd is smoke and the sheep
[1:28:45] are scattered but this is what I want
[1:28:47] you to notice when that takes place
[1:28:49] remember they're like in a situation of
[1:28:51] disarray and of confusion they're
[1:28:54] wondering what's going on but notice the
[1:28:56] chief shepherd when the chief Shepherd
[1:29:00] arises from the grave he goes and begins
[1:29:04] to gather his children together
[1:29:08] he begins as the Bible says to show
[1:29:11] himself alive after many infallible
[1:29:15] proofs he begins to draw them together
[1:29:18] now think of this the promise of the
[1:29:21] redeemer the promise of the Messiah was
[1:29:25] that it had to be a suffering and
[1:29:27] offering not then the very life of God
[1:29:31] the holy spirit wouldn't be poured back
[1:29:33] out upon the worshiper this all had to
[1:29:37] be and notice how that the Lord Jesus in
[1:29:40] this time he works and begins to gather
[1:29:43] them together now I hope you're with me
[1:29:46] now he begins to gather them where they
[1:29:48] were scattered in confusion the Bible
[1:29:51] says in the book of Acts Acts chapter 1
[1:29:53] verse 4 that he was assembled together
[1:29:56] with them so where was a brokenness but
[1:30:01] now he begins to get them together but
[1:30:04] what is he doing to bring them together
[1:30:07] he is manifesting himself by the promise
[1:30:12] of the word remember he comes to them
[1:30:15] their fishing comes into the house where
[1:30:17] they're at he manifests himself there at
[1:30:19] the garden tomb he manifests himself to
[1:30:21] those who are on their way back to tell
[1:30:23] the disciples and he makes himself known
[1:30:25] to them according to what he did before
[1:30:29] his crucifixion and as he makes that
[1:30:33] known
[1:30:34] them the Bible says right here and we
[1:30:36] realize in acts 1 this is also referring
[1:30:38] over into the book of Acts as well era
[1:30:40] Luke will get here in just a moment he
[1:30:42] is letting them know as he brings them
[1:30:44] together so here he is bringing the
[1:30:46] children back together and he lets them
[1:30:49] to know that you must receive the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost
[1:30:53] so this promise of the Messiah of the
[1:30:57] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ it comes
[1:31:00] forth to unite the people making them
[1:31:03] ready for that perfect union where God
[1:31:07] will set down back into the throne of
[1:31:10] man now think of it they've walked with
[1:31:12] him they slept with him they fished with
[1:31:15] him they hunted with him they know all
[1:31:17] the stories but they're not one now
[1:31:21] they've got a choice they can either
[1:31:23] stand around and they can look around
[1:31:25] and they can just keep on talking about
[1:31:28] all those stories and my what wonderful
[1:31:30] testimonies what wonderful things that
[1:31:33] God did through the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:36] but you see the real recognition was is
[1:31:39] that they would recognize what God had
[1:31:42] did in Christ that same God wanted to do
[1:31:46] this through them what's this
[1:31:51] in Luke 24 verse 50 well here is this
[1:31:56] cheap shed chief Shepherd and he led
[1:31:59] them out as far as to Bethany and he
[1:32:03] lifted up his hands and blessed them and
[1:32:07] it came to pass while he blessed them he
[1:32:10] was parted from them and carried up into
[1:32:14] heaven and they worshiped him and
[1:32:19] returned to Jerusalem with great joy
[1:32:26] they hadn't even got the Holy Ghost yet
[1:32:28] and they had great joy how could they
[1:32:33] have great joy well it's not because
[1:32:35] they had just seen him but there was
[1:32:38] great joy because what he was declaring
[1:32:41] to them I indeed
[1:32:42] I've paid the price of redemption and
[1:32:45] now is coming the real true day of
[1:32:49] pinnacles now is coming the real true
[1:32:53] Liberty that promise of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:57] that was mentioned there in the book of
[1:32:59] Joel that same one that moved in the
[1:33:02] beginning this is the promise and this
[1:33:05] sign has manifested to unite you and
[1:33:08] make you ready for this promise to come
[1:33:11] into manifestation all along notice all
[1:33:14] the instruction along I've kept him in
[1:33:16] my name he went to the guard he went to
[1:33:19] the cross crucified he rose again what
[1:33:21] is he doing he's gathering them back to
[1:33:23] himself this was only a work that had to
[1:33:25] be done to pay the price and now he's
[1:33:28] gathering them back to himself what's he
[1:33:30] doing he's pointing them to the promise
[1:33:33] and they returned to Jerusalem with
[1:33:36] great joy acts 1 verse 12 then they
[1:33:45] returned unto Jerusalem from the mount
[1:33:48] called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a
[1:33:51] Sabbath day's journey and when they were
[1:33:54] come in they went up into an upper room
[1:33:57] where abode both Peter James John Andrew
[1:34:01] Phil Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James
[1:34:03] the son of Alphaeus Simon Zelotes and
[1:34:06] Judas the brother of James notice these
[1:34:10] all continued with one Accord in prayer
[1:34:15] and in supplication with the women and
[1:34:19] Mary the mother of Jesus with his
[1:34:23] brethren so hear the word what's what
[1:34:27] the words doing the word has gathered
[1:34:30] them and as the word has gathered them
[1:34:32] the word is also leading them to a place
[1:34:35] of uniting it's letting them know you
[1:34:39] must wait and be endued with power from
[1:34:42] on high but I go unto my father and if I
[1:34:47] go unto my father I will
[1:34:49] and by the holy ghost upon you now here
[1:34:52] they were as believers this sign had
[1:34:55] been made manifest calluses didn't see
[1:34:57] him as the resurrected Lord Jesus none
[1:35:01] of the rest of them seen this but they
[1:35:03] that solid listen now they that solid
[1:35:06] for what it was they made their journey
[1:35:10] to Jerusalem they didn't stay there
[1:35:12] where he was that they didn't stay and
[1:35:15] mark the ground and then start charging
[1:35:17] admission to the ground they didn't stay
[1:35:19] there and created a little fence and say
[1:35:21] this is where he ascended right here's
[1:35:23] where he ascended and they start
[1:35:24] charging admission and in order to view
[1:35:26] it that was not what it was there was a
[1:35:29] greater purpose that would have been
[1:35:31] something earthly listen to me now they
[1:35:33] could have got people United around that
[1:35:35] people would have come there well this
[1:35:37] is where he United this is where he
[1:35:39] ascended out this is right here at
[1:35:41] Bethany right here at the mouth they
[1:35:43] could have done all of that but that was
[1:35:45] not the unity that God was calling for
[1:35:48] the unity that he was calling for was
[1:35:51] the unity of his own life to be inside
[1:35:54] of the worshipper OMA they all continued
[1:36:01] with one Accord in prayer and
[1:36:05] supplication I thought it takes the Holy
[1:36:10] Ghost to bring unity it does but you see
[1:36:14] they were already in one Accord and the
[1:36:16] Holy Ghost ain't even come who how did
[1:36:22] you get a group of people in one Accord
[1:36:25] how did they get how did this happen it
[1:36:29] was a manifestation of the promise that
[1:36:32] pointed the people to an expectation of
[1:36:35] the fulfillment of the promise they were
[1:36:38] not in the Upper Room fussing and
[1:36:40] fighting if they had have been fussing
[1:36:43] and fighting the Holy Ghost would have
[1:36:45] never come you understand what I'm
[1:36:47] saying
[1:36:48] people look up say wow we need to stop
[1:36:49] fussing and fighting and we need to win
[1:36:52] we need the Holy Ghost to count but
[1:36:54] first we need to stop fussing and
[1:36:55] fighting you want the Holy Ghost to move
[1:36:57] and work down through your home you make
[1:36:59] sure your attitudes lined up first
[1:37:02] Sarat we have to check ourselves first
[1:37:05] because remember it is that rich will
[1:37:08] invite his presence how many times the
[1:37:11] Prophet will tell us a resentful spirit
[1:37:13] he said he will not come in the
[1:37:14] congregation and reveal himself a
[1:37:16] resentful spirit will keep him back they
[1:37:21] were all with one Accord in prayer and
[1:37:23] supplication in the message one this
[1:37:24] brother M says oh we've got to believe
[1:37:26] with one heart one mind and one Accord
[1:37:29] that's the way they was before the Union
[1:37:32] was ever made on the day of Pentecost
[1:37:35] one heart one mind and one Accord what a
[1:37:38] miracle who did this
[1:37:42] Oh Peter no he didn't obey me Jacques no
[1:37:47] maybe it was James nope nope nope it
[1:37:50] wasn't a man that did this
[1:37:53] it was the manifestation of the risen
[1:37:58] Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you
[1:38:00] something friends there is one thing
[1:38:02] that is so needed and we must examine it
[1:38:05] write down in every part in every aspect
[1:38:08] of our homes our children do not need
[1:38:10] indoctrinated they might ever so know
[1:38:13] the doctrines of this message but unless
[1:38:15] they're born again that will do no good
[1:38:18] they must be born again of the Spirit of
[1:38:22] God it takes God coming down and
[1:38:25] bringing a real reality in their lives
[1:38:28] and let me tell you something it takes
[1:38:29] more than just coming around where
[1:38:32] believers are at but there ought to be a
[1:38:34] hunger in your life a hunger in your
[1:38:36] heart that God I want you to be
[1:38:38] reflected through my life Lord I want to
[1:38:41] be one with Jesus Christ
[1:38:51] acts 2:1 and when the Holy Ghost went up
[1:38:55] in the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:38:57] oh my they were all with one Accord in
[1:39:00] one place and suddenly there came a
[1:39:07] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:39:10] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:39:12] they were sitting and there appeared
[1:39:13] unto them cloven tongues like as a fire
[1:39:16] and it's set upon each of them and they
[1:39:19] were filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:21] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:39:23] Spirit gave them utterance
[1:39:28] this word one Accord it's used in many
[1:39:33] places here throughout the New Testament
[1:39:37] this word it's a compound word I'm not
[1:39:40] going to try to pronounce it it's a
[1:39:42] compound word of two words meaning to
[1:39:44] rush along and in unison the image is
[1:39:48] almost musical a number of notes are
[1:39:51] sounded which while different harmonize
[1:39:54] in pitch and tone as the instruments of
[1:39:58] a great concert under the direction of a
[1:40:01] concert master so the Holy Ghost blends
[1:40:04] together the lives of members of
[1:40:07] Christ's Church who does that
[1:40:11] Christ who does it with in a hope Christ
[1:40:15] it takes Christ it takes submitting and
[1:40:20] surrendering to him notice this is what
[1:40:23] he does and as we read right here two
[1:40:26] scriptures already they were already in
[1:40:28] one Accord before the Holy Ghost ever
[1:40:31] came how can that be because it is that
[1:40:36] life of the promise that has been made
[1:40:39] known before them it reaches out and
[1:40:42] takes a hold within their heart and
[1:40:44] there is no question about it
[1:40:46] it is assurance that what he has said he
[1:40:51] will do you with me they would never
[1:40:56] have returned back to Jerusalem with
[1:40:57] great joy but they were already
[1:40:59] rejoicing before the Holy Ghost ever
[1:41:01] come who
[1:41:04] I wonder are we able to rejoice before
[1:41:06] the rapture or are we gonna wait hold
[1:41:09] Lord I'm just gonna late on that day you
[1:41:11] know because Lord you know how I am
[1:41:13] really I believe right now when that
[1:41:15] when that promise is made so alive
[1:41:18] within our hearts and our life to
[1:41:19] realize that we belong to him
[1:41:23] oh come on friends sometimes we let so
[1:41:26] many other things cloud and take away
[1:41:28] our mind we let things cloud around and
[1:41:30] we let other things substitute we're the
[1:41:33] real joy of the Lord all to me and you
[1:41:36] know nobody can tell me they don't get
[1:41:38] happy well I don't get happy I don't get
[1:41:40] excited I know that's a lie I can watch
[1:41:42] people talk I can watch how they
[1:41:44] interact in other parts and other
[1:41:46] settings or whatever more but listen
[1:41:48] this is what I'm saying why not be happy
[1:41:51] and joyful in the promises of God I mean
[1:41:56] that is if they're your promises but if
[1:41:59] they're not your promises then maybe
[1:42:01] that's why you're not happy but you can
[1:42:03] recognize and become identified in
[1:42:05] Christ and that this promise itself
[1:42:07] would be made alive in you you
[1:42:10] understand what I'm saying that there is
[1:42:12] nobody gonna dictate whether I'm happy
[1:42:13] or not
[1:42:15] nobody's gonna dictate whether I had joy
[1:42:17] or not that's what you have to make a
[1:42:22] decision or brother sent me you don't
[1:42:25] understand what's going on I'm not
[1:42:26] trying to dismiss those things what I'm
[1:42:28] trying to tell you is there is something
[1:42:30] that is greater and to be focused upon
[1:42:33] they're not focused upon the problems
[1:42:35] but focus on him who made the promise
[1:42:39] they were not focused on their
[1:42:41] insufficiencies Peter was not focused on
[1:42:45] his denial they went with great joy when
[1:42:51] they came together they did like David
[1:42:54] said enter his gates were Thanksgiving
[1:42:56] in my heart I will enter his courts with
[1:42:58] praise on the day of Pentecost let me
[1:43:04] read you a few things here brother Ram
[1:43:05] tells us he says here we find he says
[1:43:08] Lord he says you come in this moment you
[1:43:11] say I just believe I didn't put it up
[1:43:13] there yeah I just believed you're going
[1:43:14] to pour out your blessings I'm expecting
[1:43:16] it now
[1:43:17] all things are moving right in I'm
[1:43:19] expecting to see be exceedingly
[1:43:21] abundantly now I'm expecting it you come
[1:43:24] down you come down and say well I don't
[1:43:28] know about it
[1:43:28] we'll see you hurt the other person now
[1:43:34] you're setting by one of them and you
[1:43:37] say Oh Lord just tear him down now just
[1:43:40] tear them down in other words help the
[1:43:43] person who might be sitting there
[1:43:44] thinking that because that thought is
[1:43:47] hindering them I wonder sometimes if God
[1:43:52] don't let things be sung out of key just
[1:43:54] to see what your attitude will be like I
[1:43:58] wonder do listen friends don't
[1:44:01] underestimate the devil he'll do
[1:44:04] anything he can to try to break unity in
[1:44:07] a service he'll do anything to try to do
[1:44:11] that to get our mind and our focus
[1:44:13] because he knows when people are in one
[1:44:16] Accord and one mind in harmony that God
[1:44:19] is able to move so there's one thing the
[1:44:25] devil's not afraid of quotes he ain't
[1:44:27] afraid of the scriptures he ain't afraid
[1:44:29] of that what he's afraid of is people
[1:44:31] being United with Christ home on that
[1:44:40] you're sitting there by one time you say
[1:44:41] Oh Lord just tearing down now I'm
[1:44:43] expecting great things and that
[1:44:47] expectancy will get that unity among the
[1:44:52] people
[1:44:53] so you come expecting I come expecting
[1:44:58] and as I'm expecting god you're
[1:45:02] expecting God it creates an atmosphere
[1:45:07] it creates an atmosphere for God to
[1:45:12] begin to move but I said that's what
[1:45:18] happened on the day of Pentecost what
[1:45:20] brought the Holy Ghost in the first
[1:45:23] place they went up there and stayed ten
[1:45:25] days and night until they were all in
[1:45:29] one place
[1:45:30] and with one Accord blessing God for
[1:45:33] something they did not have did you
[1:45:38] catch that blessing God for something
[1:45:41] they did not have brother send me I
[1:45:44] don't have my healing yet but can you
[1:45:46] bless him for it how can I bless him for
[1:45:49] it because he said I'm the Lord that he
[1:45:52] loved all your diseases by His stripes
[1:45:55] I'm healed expectancy creates an
[1:45:59] atmosphere for unity but if I'm
[1:46:03] expecting I'll tell you what I hope they
[1:46:06] sing this song today I hope I hope he
[1:46:09] changed this text today I hope this I
[1:46:11] hope that's not expectancy we won't get
[1:46:13] nothing out of the service but if we
[1:46:15] have an expectancy the Lord I'm coming
[1:46:18] here not to see my brothers and sisters
[1:46:21] I love them but I'm coming here to see
[1:46:24] you
[1:46:25] and to meet with you Lord and that you
[1:46:28] would come on the scene and speak to my
[1:46:31] heart oh my then we're getting somewhere
[1:46:34] oh we sure have a lot to do with the
[1:46:42] service don't Li we say about stepping
[1:46:44] back and saying I want to let go and let
[1:46:46] God have his way but what a
[1:46:48] responsibility that you and I have
[1:46:52] everyone goes on to say they was
[1:46:54] thanking God for the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:46:57] Ghost had never come yet but they had it
[1:46:59] in a seed form
[1:47:03] they had the promise already manifested
[1:47:05] to him they began to think God already
[1:47:08] oh my as people of God when God can
[1:47:13] manifest listen to me now these things
[1:47:16] as brother Graham says you take it like
[1:47:17] an acorn
[1:47:18] he said they that's how they took this
[1:47:20] promise he said you take that acorn now
[1:47:22] think of an egg corn that falls out
[1:47:23] there off of those oak trees you take
[1:47:26] that egg corn and inside of that acorn
[1:47:28] is going to be a big old oak tree
[1:47:30] they'll be leaves come off of that
[1:47:32] they'll be acorns come off of that and
[1:47:34] you potentially have an acorn tree you
[1:47:38] can actually take that and say God thank
[1:47:41] you Lord Jesus there is a tree that's
[1:47:44] gonna come but you got a planet and it
[1:47:49] has to die but you can be thankful
[1:47:51] because you know this acorn this promise
[1:47:55] is for me and that's how even a person
[1:47:59] would approach the Holy Ghost is to
[1:48:01] believe that it's for you do you realize
[1:48:06] how the Lord Jesus directed the
[1:48:08] disciples he didn't tell them I don't
[1:48:10] know you might be elect I don't know I'm
[1:48:12] not you know that's up to God he never
[1:48:13] told them no such stuff he worked with
[1:48:17] them talked with them even Judas come on
[1:48:23] somebody you would have been
[1:48:25] hard-pressed to be able to tell who was
[1:48:27] a deceiver because Jesus never treated
[1:48:31] him one bit different than from the rest
[1:48:33] of them they never ever said yeah see
[1:48:37] how Jesus yeah I'll say now jesus walks
[1:48:39] by him and don't even shake his hand huh
[1:48:40] I caught that there was nothing nothing
[1:48:48] that life was lived in such a manner to
[1:48:52] keep them in that place it was not Jesus
[1:48:57] that told Judas no going out of here you
[1:48:59] know you go ahead no it was already in
[1:49:02] Judas's heart but it did not stop the
[1:49:06] gathering of the elect of God they were
[1:49:09] kept in his name they were kept there
[1:49:12] and brought to this place to where that
[1:49:16] God Himself could move down on the
[1:49:18] inside friends don't you see don't let
[1:49:20] the whole big fault don't let it escape
[1:49:21] you we want you must be unity in order
[1:49:25] for character there's got to be unity in
[1:49:28] the whole let me bring it on down you
[1:49:32] know what you want your children to look
[1:49:33] at you and you want your children be
[1:49:35] able to say I want what they've got
[1:49:39] you're gonna preach with me now I want
[1:49:42] what they've got it's not the Sun it's
[1:49:44] not a show that we're putting on it
[1:49:46] isn't about how much that we can talk
[1:49:48] it's a life that's lived it's not
[1:49:53] because we know that brother Rams a
[1:49:54] prophet it's not because we know certain
[1:49:56] scriptures that's not what we're talking
[1:49:58] about we're talking about a life that is
[1:50:01] lived thank God for the person who was a
[1:50:04] drunkard no more drunkard thank God for
[1:50:06] the person who was a fornicator no
[1:50:08] longer a fornicator but you must be born
[1:50:11] again you must have that life on the
[1:50:15] inside of you in a real unity a real
[1:50:19] union and let me tell you something
[1:50:21] that life on the inside of you and I as
[1:50:24] believers and allowing that life to
[1:50:26] express it'll do something that dr.
[1:50:29] Dobson can never touch it'll do
[1:50:32] something that all of the love languages
[1:50:34] and everything else can never touch come
[1:50:37] on friends sometimes I get worried that
[1:50:39] people have replaced books for a genuine
[1:50:41] experience with God trying to school
[1:50:44] people into things instead of really by
[1:50:46] genuine experience I'll tell you what my
[1:50:52] daddy was a pastor you know that most of
[1:50:54] you know that but that still did not
[1:50:55] substitute that I had to have a new
[1:50:58] earth I had to be born again quoting
[1:51:00] quotes I could quote many quotes even
[1:51:02] while I was out there as a ranked sinner
[1:51:04] I could finish many of them that you
[1:51:06] could start just from sitting right here
[1:51:07] in the church pews and hearing her but
[1:51:09] that did not mean one thing that
[1:51:13] intellect never held me it never held
[1:51:16] whatsoever but oh my one day when the
[1:51:19] god of this word
[1:51:21] I met him face to face that was
[1:51:24] different
[1:51:26] that was different I know sometimes
[1:51:32] people look for evidences and they look
[1:51:34] for things well huh I never drank or I
[1:51:35] never this or I never that so well what
[1:51:38] is it so how do I know when Christ has
[1:51:40] become alive in you and effectually
[1:51:42] living through you when this word has
[1:51:45] become alive when you can stay away from
[1:51:51] the Fellowship of believers I question
[1:51:53] your experience when it's when it's free
[1:51:55] when it's something to where it don't
[1:51:57] bother you
[1:51:58] I'm friends listen I understand there's
[1:51:59] legitimate excuses but sometimes there's
[1:52:02] just flat-out Frank laziness where
[1:52:04] people are not adamant enough about
[1:52:06] coming to the house of God who I
[1:52:09] questioned it
[1:52:11] I really do I questioned well who are
[1:52:13] you to question me no please don't take
[1:52:15] it that way what I'm trying to tell you
[1:52:17] is is that the love of God is something
[1:52:19] that ought to be so pulsating within our
[1:52:22] hearts I'll quote our prophet where he
[1:52:24] said if the love of God is in your heart
[1:52:28] you can't wait for the church doors to
[1:52:32] open
[1:52:33] if the love of God is there with
[1:52:39] ramesses this is the way that we get it
[1:52:43] they was blessing God for the Holy Ghost
[1:52:46] which had never yet come but they
[1:52:48] believed that it was because God was
[1:52:51] going to keep his promise and they kept
[1:52:53] blessing God until that atmosphere got
[1:52:56] right lord have mercy
[1:52:58] they kept blessing God unto the
[1:53:01] atmosphere got right you and I are a
[1:53:03] mature creators
[1:53:05] we are amateur creators within our home
[1:53:09] listen when brother Rams home was all
[1:53:12] tore apart he had people coming through
[1:53:14] you know Bill Graham talks about how he
[1:53:16] had people coming through his hole you
[1:53:17] know and they were ten I got a word for
[1:53:19] the Lord from you
[1:53:20] my brother Ram I've got to tell you this
[1:53:21] brother Ram God I tell you this I love
[1:53:23] brother brands response brother brems
[1:53:24] response to that was is I have
[1:53:26] connections with him also if he wants
[1:53:30] something for me to know he'll tell me
[1:53:34] and this it had such a disarray because
[1:53:37] of people running in and out and telling
[1:53:39] his wife this and telling him this and
[1:53:41] I've got a word from the Lord and all
[1:53:43] these things and yet brother branham
[1:53:44] noticed what he does seeing but chaos
[1:53:48] he's got to unify that home now what
[1:53:52] does he do
[1:53:53] does he take up a lot of word no wife
[1:53:57] you're to be this children you're to
[1:54:01] obey the parents no no he Gerdes himself
[1:54:06] you see me do it many times he Gerdes
[1:54:09] himself with some priestly garments and
[1:54:12] it goes in it starts washing dishes now
[1:54:17] I don't look like that he's casting out
[1:54:19] Devils but he is because remember Devils
[1:54:24] are not cast out by the strength of God
[1:54:26] they're cast out by his finger his
[1:54:31] strength is his shoulder he's cast out
[1:54:33] by his finger so he comes in here and he
[1:54:36] begins to change the atmosphere by
[1:54:39] talking to her about a dress why to
[1:54:44] change the atmosphere once the
[1:54:47] atmosphere gets right then the home
[1:54:51] itself will set right see that's why
[1:54:55] even in things like this that the devil
[1:54:56] will try to bring things within a
[1:54:58] service to try to break the atmosphere
[1:55:01] you with me you catch that last week
[1:55:04] when all that sound started going
[1:55:05] haywire here y'all catch that at the end
[1:55:07] of the service that was a devil trying
[1:55:09] to break the atmosphere that's exactly
[1:55:13] what was taking place
[1:55:14] I caught it as I was standing right here
[1:55:16] those things taking place to try to
[1:55:18] break what God had already brought the
[1:55:20] people to that's exactly how enemy will
[1:55:24] try to break an atmosphere within things
[1:55:26] that can seem to be so simple but we
[1:55:29] must remember brother bill said it here
[1:55:30] when he was leading songs today we're in
[1:55:32] a battle we are in a battle when we come
[1:55:36] here you have thoughts go through your
[1:55:38] mind that you wouldn't have go through
[1:55:40] your mind for the rest of the week and
[1:55:41] then thoughts will come out through your
[1:55:42] mind you'll remember to fix something or
[1:55:44] something might not have been turned off
[1:55:46] or this is on why is that Satan's desire
[1:55:50] to break unity
[1:55:55] all the doctrine that we know that don't
[1:55:57] stop it it's where we have to say Lord
[1:56:00] Jesus I'm here for one purpose I'm here
[1:56:08] for one purpose and that's to receive
[1:56:10] from you tomorrow will take care of
[1:56:13] itself
[1:56:36] what an admonishment that the Prophet
[1:56:39] gives to us
[1:56:43] they kept blessing God until the
[1:56:45] atmosphere got right
[1:56:51] Graham says Oh couldn't we get in an
[1:56:53] atmosphere here that every crippled
[1:56:56] every blind every sick person everything
[1:57:01] all with one Accord just get the
[1:57:07] atmosphere right
[1:57:12] the band says Oh God send us an
[1:57:14] atmosphere
[1:57:15] that'll make it of one Accord in one
[1:57:19] place so when that atmosphere gets rowdy
[1:57:22] it opens and moves back every clog and
[1:57:25] the law of God will move he says let's
[1:57:31] get in he says you know we've got power
[1:57:33] enough to open the eyes of the blind and
[1:57:36] stop the years of the death to do all
[1:57:38] things but he says you come in with a
[1:57:41] twisted up atmosphere let's get in one
[1:57:45] Accord so the Holy Spirit can pour out
[1:57:47] the gushers down upon the people one
[1:57:51] place in one Accord
[1:57:58] if that unity that was brought by the
[1:58:02] promise that was manifested in that hour
[1:58:05] and it was it could bring the people
[1:58:09] into a place of expectation and waiting
[1:58:13] on the promise to believe that it was
[1:58:17] for them that it wasn't something that
[1:58:21] was and maybe or a possibility it was
[1:58:26] sure it was sure they could come into
[1:58:31] such a place like this now look friends
[1:58:33] this right here that we read from which
[1:58:35] started into this this was the early
[1:58:38] church church age hadn't even started
[1:58:39] yet churches hadn't even started yet but
[1:58:44] there was such a unity in this alpha
[1:58:49] bride with such a time we could say a
[1:58:52] broad age here was right after the
[1:58:56] outpouring of the Holy Ghost ad 33 the
[1:58:59] first church age didn't start 253 20
[1:59:03] years right here a complete perfect
[1:59:06] unity who brought that about God did
[1:59:13] that God knows what every every Mead he
[1:59:16] knows in every situation he knows in
[1:59:19] every home he knows in every life if you
[1:59:23] can just get your heart your mind just
[1:59:27] in one Accord just getting it lined up
[1:59:29] with God first and you just watch how
[1:59:32] God will line everything else up within
[1:59:35] the home
[1:59:36] let God let God move down into the very
[1:59:40] depths of your life and recognize that
[1:59:43] this promise is from me
[1:59:44] you know you might look at it this here
[1:59:47] this morning and you might look at
[1:59:49] things that say well there's certain
[1:59:50] things that will never change
[1:59:53] but that you never got that from God
[1:59:59] but with God all things are possible
[2:00:04] he don't matter how long you've been
[2:00:07] married
[2:00:08] it don't matter how old or how young
[2:00:11] your children might be
[2:00:13] it doesn't matter friends what matters
[2:00:15] is you can say in your heart Lord I want
[2:00:18] a deeper relationship with you and I
[2:00:22] want a deeper relationship husband or
[2:00:25] wife less versa and with children
[2:00:28] together
[2:00:29] I want a deeper relationship I don't
[2:00:34] know about you but this is something
[2:00:38] that I pray for and I pray and I ask God
[2:00:41] to help me and to teach me this is what
[2:00:45] my desire is and you know what I can say
[2:00:49] he's been teaching me not just recently
[2:00:51] over the years he's been teaching me you
[2:00:54] know every time that he teaches me you
[2:00:56] know the funny thing about it is it's
[2:00:58] nobody else that's dying it's me that
[2:01:01] ends up dying it's me it's not my wife
[2:01:06] it's not my children my wife no doubt
[2:01:08] can say the same thing it's me that ends
[2:01:11] up dying but all what a wonderful thing
[2:01:16] what a wonderful thing to be able to die
[2:01:19] to ourselves to be united to let that
[2:01:24] life that word live so affectionately
[2:01:27] through us that's your desire this
[2:01:29] morning let that life so flow through me
[2:01:35] or Jesus
[2:01:40] Lord there's only one that can break the
[2:01:44] word and to make it effectual in our
[2:01:46] hearts
[2:01:49] or sometimes within a service there's
[2:01:51] things or we can as a minister Lord we
[2:01:54] can see effects we can see father where
[2:01:58] ground maybe has been gained
[2:02:01] father where holds have been broken
[2:02:04] other times the Lord God we stand Lord
[2:02:06] Jesus within the same faith and knowing
[2:02:11] this that your word will not return back
[2:02:13] to you void Lord I pray this morning
[2:02:17] that even Lord God even after we that we
[2:02:20] wouldn't depart from this place depart
[2:02:23] from one another's presence Lord even
[2:02:25] later today I pray Heavenly Father as
[2:02:28] you know each and every one of our
[2:02:30] hearts Lord God hearts that are lifted
[2:02:34] up before you I pray Heavenly Father the
[2:02:39] Lord God that you would continue to move
[2:02:42] may the false Lord of unity Lord
[2:02:46] continue Lord to move through our lives
[2:02:50] Lord we realize what a powerful thing
[2:02:53] unity is you look down there Lord in the
[2:02:56] beginning when Nimrod had gathered all
[2:02:59] most people together and as you said in
[2:03:03] the word let us go down
[2:03:08] for these people are warned nor they
[2:03:13] truly were one they were one around that
[2:03:18] building of a tower that they might
[2:03:20] escape the judgment of God Lord that was
[2:03:23] not even a true unity but that you that
[2:03:27] right there around a purpose brought a
[2:03:31] unity of people Lord God how much
[2:03:36] greater how much greater Lord God a
[2:03:41] unity Lord that's not brought by man but
[2:03:45] a unity Lord God that's brought by you
[2:03:47] Lord Father in the hearts and lives of
[2:03:51] your people Lord God Lord Jesus as they
[2:03:56] gather together there they begin to
[2:03:59] bless you they worshiped you lord
[2:04:03] they were thanking you for the promise
[2:04:05] Lord because it was sure it was
[2:04:10] something Lord that they could expect
[2:04:12] Lord God they had come into a place of
[2:04:16] one Accord one mind one place
[2:04:21] Lord Jesus I believe God that's where
[2:04:25] we're at this morning Lord I believe
[2:04:28] that's where we're gathered Lord God
[2:04:29] we've not we've not gathered here Lord
[2:04:31] God just around a word but father we've
[2:04:36] gathered here Lord around you enoyed you
[2:04:39] have manifested yourself by your word
[2:04:42] through the power of your spirit Lord
[2:04:45] and resurrection power that you are the
[2:04:48] same yesterday today and forever
[2:04:52] Lord I pray this morning God if there
[2:04:56] happens to be one that's here then Lord
[2:04:59] in their heart Lord that all that it is
[2:05:02] that they're just trusting Lord and
[2:05:04] coming to a church that that's all they
[2:05:07] that's all they seemingly wouldn't know
[2:05:09] about Lord Father I pray this morning
[2:05:13] dear God that they would recognize
[2:05:16] there's a deeper walk for him lord I
[2:05:18] pray that they would realize the Lord
[2:05:20] God it's more than just coming to a
[2:05:22] church Lord your God ain't been yet if
[2:05:25] they hadn't come Lord how would they
[2:05:27] hear Lord how can they hear Lord God
[2:05:30] unless there be a preacher Lord God how
[2:05:32] can they hear unless there's one Lord
[2:05:34] God who would make himself known to them
[2:05:36] Lord God I pray Heavenly Father that God
[2:05:39] this morning that Lord that you would
[2:05:41] draw them Lord God to that place Lord
[2:05:44] that that reality what it is that
[2:05:47] they're longing for Lord that craving
[2:05:50] Lord God the same God who would touch
[2:05:53] their life the same God who would call
[2:05:55] them out of the world the same God who
[2:05:58] would claim their life up is the same
