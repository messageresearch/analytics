can have an expectation in our hearts for what the Lord is going to do you believe that if if we didn't come to church tonight expecting we're in trouble we're in trouble but we've come tonight expecting Because He Lives amen because of what he has done within our lives and in our hearts this is our confidence we don't know all that God will do tonight and you may not even be fully aware of what God will do within your life right here in this service but the expectation is is that Lord You're present and I just want to submit myself to you sometimes how many times in the meetings where brother Ram has given us testimony after testimony that we're through the preaching of the word that the people receive their healing because their faith was brought to that place they didn't even realize that they had been healed but the effect is what come out in their life and they realize this after a while that's the effect of the word the word has within it the power of transformation

[Music] amen is such a great privilege that the Lord have given to us for us to gather again this evening um I will start tonight by just uh showing for the world condolence to the entire church because what happened here we got the information back home a personal way of our precious brother James Browning the pastor of the church and uh the congression said I should make sure to extend their condolence to all of you we really sympathize with you and uh just this morning but I some will pick me from Pennsylvania and were coming then he told me also about uh sister Betty the wife of brother Doug in fact it was a blow to me but you know you some when it happened like this you feel some inward pains when especially loved ones you know they go like that but there is a Blessed assurance that that is not the end but surely we have a hope that those loved ones that have gone on we shall see them once again and that is what we are all waiting for and the bible say that we are going to be with them as Jesus Christ is coming to pick all of us away and as we will see him coming so shall we ever be with him with all these loved ones so with once again sympathize with all of you but let us continue to let our faith build up amen because this body must break down Hallelujah and that is what we are all yearning for God bless all of you amen shall we just be on our feet at this time and uh have a word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus Christ today is another day that you have made for us the bible say that we should live in it and rejoice we thank you for what you've made us to be father ignore our mind is not our power it's not anything that we have done by our own selves but it just the grace that you bestowed on us before the foundation of the world We Appreciate You king of kings and Lord of lords I am very thankful Lord unto thee tonight for bringing me safely to brother Samuel an entire congregation here father you promise US that we're two or three will be gathered in your name you'll be right in the midst of your children therefore tonight Lord we pray oh God let us fill your presence O Lord come and speak your word to us father that we may be better people than we have entered in tonight Grant the Lord Jesus Christ and let your word come and heal the sick Lord let it come and roll the burden of your children away we thank you Father and in the end we'll give you glory in adoration we actually Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen shall we just turn our scriptures to Revelation chapter 4. Revelation chapter 4 we read verse 1 um to five and then also we will read chapter 11 verse 11 to 13. Revelation chapter 4. after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I had was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in a spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that suck was to look upon like a Jasper and a sudden stone and there was a rainbow round above the throne inside like onto an emerald and round about The Throne were Four and Twenty seats and upon the seeds I saw Four and Twenty Elders sitting clothed in white any heart on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeding proceeded Lightnings and tenderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God chapter 11 verse 11 to 13. and after three days in half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them and the same hour was there a great earthquake in the 10th part of the city fell and the earthquake were slain of men and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and a Remnant were afraided and gave glory to the god of Heaven may the Lord that is blessing to the reading of his word amen shall we take our seat amen we are always grateful to the Lord especially in this time that the world don't know where they have reached uh they don't know what is happening they are just living in the world but we thank God that we know where the world has reached Hallelujah tonight I'm speaking on a topic come up hither come up hither and this this is an invitation and this invitation was God's Own invitation that is Jesus Christ invitation and this invitation a non for any other person but to you Hallelujah that invitation is your invitation and no invitations are meant for so many many reasons no you'll be a very privileged person when somebody will invite you for for dinner because everybody like food oh yes I like it you like it Hallelujah you know so when you are invited for dinner I mean or for a feast you realize that though it means you are very important to that person who is in throwing the invitation to you it showed kind of love if someone loves you he will invite you come and dance with me Hallelujah you know that's the reason why this part of Jesus Christ spoke about the past the man that threw a party and invited some people and they give him excuses it didn't go well with the man because he was such a man that he loved those people he invited them and he prepared you know to to make them happy but day 10 the invitation upside down you know that is why the bible say that he asked his servant to go into the hedges to compel people I mean compel them to come because the feast was meant to be consumed Hallelujah and here we are that God is throwing an invitation to us you see that you're a very important person so long that God is concerned Hallelujah now the prophet made us to understand that John represents the bride and for that matter if John says that he saw when you look up into heaven as he heard the voice called him a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which he had was like a trumpet talking with him which was calling him that John come up either oh my God have mercy I pray that you put yourself in the shoes of John right now for you to realize that that invitation is not for John Baptist for you according as the prophet put it you know and now we know that in the beginning it was the desire of God to live with his people God did not create Adam to separate himself from him God created Adam so that he will have Fellowship always with him that is why the bible say that at the cool of the day the Lord with his sin into the midst of his people and the Lord preached the word because that is whereby we have fellowship with one another he preached a word and they respond amen until sin entered into the Garden of Eden and a separated man completely from God but what happened the originality of God's plan was that he would live with his people so even though sin broke that Fellowship it has always been in the mind of God that he will restore man back to that Fellowship again amen and amen you know like the prophet says that if you hear if you hear and the siren of ambulance rushing somebody to the hospital he said it was because of what the woman did in the Garden of Eden yes sir that brought death because God said that the day that you eat that thing you will die they ate it and they died Hallelujah well you say that but Adam was 930 years yes he was 13 30 years but still he died that same day because when the Lord thousand years it's one day So Adam was not even one day before the Lord Hallelujah but you see anything that the Lord has purpose to do there is nothing that can change his mind here we are now so many problems on the side okay so many problems some summer summer on medication because of what happened in the Garden of Eden some are dying because of what happened in the Garden of Eden some are facing so many problems disaster here or there recently we were there when we had the hurricane whatever they call it that that destroy uh Hustle Princeton I don't know how you pronounce that word amen who's there whatever it was look at what happened now they have once again another one coming and they said it's going to hit the Caribbean and then it is going to turn around and come to Florida what is happening disaster there Hallelujah disaster here disaster there because you know the nature like the prophet said they say the thinking of man has continued to be evil he said the mind the conscious of man has become white like snow or like leprosy you know so when man you know have that thing within him there's nothing good that will come the way of man it's always destruction okay Isaiah say that all tables are filled with vomit there is nowhere clean but what I love is that in the midst of all this in the midst of all this confusion in the midst of all this destruction that is coming up on Earth the Lord has prepared a place for you amen yes sir that is the Blessed assures us that is what settles my heart that after all I know that I'm a Child of God I know that you are a child of God hallelujah so God have prepared a place for you because it has come to a time that God decide that no I can no longer deal with my people again on this act I can no longer deal with them and that was the state that John rich and don't look at he said that done now come up either come up to me now because I am fed up of this world amen you remember in those days when Sodom was filled with sin and you know the bible say that even natural affection loved them and it was so much thinking in the nose of God and God said I know I can no longer stay there let me come and destroy and he came and destroyed the cities Hallelujah and when John also found himself in that situation dot this Antichrist Spirit was so much jeered against him they tried to kill him they tried to destroy him but they tried and tried and tried but the power of God was still vested in John until they banished him to the Island Apartments we all know the story so as the Lord appeared to John on island of Patmos it was a time for God to take him out from the Earth after he showed you whatever he was going to do through the seven Church ages praise the name of our God now he says come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter it means there are still things that God was going to show John and that time he would not allow John to be on this Earth but you must come up Hallelujah he must come a brother sister at this time I say it is time for the bride to go up whether you believe it or not I say tonight it is time for the bride to go up Hallelujah look at what is happening in the in the in the Middle East now you know that the Jews have taken over the Temple mount yes I think that's July or something like that they took over the place and they hoisted the flag of David over there declined the whole world that place belonged to them and yes it belongs to them too that took over the place it must be taken up you understand that yes because if I have a mansion or I have a home and I travel and you go and occupy it doesn't mean that it belongs to you you are just a squatter when I come back I have every Power to take over my possession and that's exactly what is happening now and we all know that there's a prophecy to be fulfilled because that Abomination that make a desolate standing in the Holy place it must go out Hallelujah and when it goes out what is going to happen that is a term that the two prophets are going to be up here Moses and Elijah to do what to reveal Jesus Christ to the Jews that Jesus Christ that they rejected they are going to reveal Jesus Christ to them and that is where you and I I don't know whether we should be here to see that then remember when Joseph decided to reveal himself to his brethren he hid his wife and children in the palace so if it is time brother my sister for the Moses and the Elijah to appear to the Jews then it means the wife of Jesus Christ we must go to the Palace amen that is why God knew very well that John it is time I have to reveal myself to my people you cannot be here for me to do that so come up amen and amen oh what a wonderful time brother my sister now we know very well that these things are hidden from the wise and the prudent and it's revealed to us babies and the Bible said that every soul cement right in the eyes of the Lord Hallelujah brother my sister it is not something that we have studied so much it's not something that we paid money for it's just the grace of God hallelujah it's just the grace of God our faith is not based upon what we we know it's built upon the Revelation that God gave to us and that of Revelation is what we are building our faith on amen remember where Jesus Christ Paul the disciples and he asked them a question he said who do men say that I am and some of them were speechless and some say that well they say you are Elijah they say you are wanna one of the prophets who have come back some say that you are Jeremiah and all that Jesus said well done that is what they are saying but you as my disciples what do you see amen what do you say are you just following me like those group who were following me because I fed them with food and fishes amen some of them were following Jesus Christ because of food until one day he saw them coming like that and he told Peter look they are coming because they thought that I'm going to give them food again Hallelujah but he says who do you say I am as my disciples then the revolution struck Peter and he looked to his face he said you are the Christ the son of the Living God Amen and listen to what Jesus Christ said he said Simon flesh and blood have not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and Upon This Rock I am going to build my church and the death of fire can never Prevail against it so the Church of Jesus Christ was built upon revelation amen that is why we cannot be deceived no brother sister we cannot be deceived the Antichrist cannot deceive us Hallelujah we are more than that you know that is when John says that he saw four beasts around the throne the prophet said that these were true gods they were guiding the Bride of Jesus Christ because the Antichrist is very cunning you know he is so deceptive that he can change himself and come like a like like like he you know if they have been able to build schools if they have been able to build hospitals if they have been able to send charity to places will you say it is bad no I don't think so because the school that they have built our children are attending the schools the hospitals that they are built we go there for treatment Hallelujah they give charity to the poor so it is good but it's very Kenny it's very deceptive very deceptive brother says if you don't take time you'll be caught up into it that is why the guides were around the throne and the Bible called them beasts the prophet said it is power they caught the attention of the Bride to see what the Antichrist is doing amen if you build me a screw I'll attend the school my children attend the school if you build me a hospital and uh I'll go for there for treatment and only to Lead Me to Hell what good does that do to me what good does that do to me Hallelujah so that that the bees were there creatures they are faced like a lion like an ox like a man like a flying eagle they protected the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah anytime the Antichrist will make a move they call the attention of the Bride come and see one time we saw the Articles coming with a white horse dress in white holding a ball without an arrow deceiving the people and many people thought that it was Jesus Christ but thank God for the revelation of the Seven Seals Hallelujah we realize that it was nobody but the devil deceiving the people because they think that when you wear white shirt then you are righteous you know white is very clean everybody know that what is fine like a minister said back home say that when your wife is going to kiss you ask her what kind of keys is that because we have so many kinds of kisses some of the kisses are for betrayal some are for love an example is What Judas is Carrot did Jesus Christ was the good kiss it was case of betrayal so if the Antichrist come and kissing you say I love you my brother I love you my sister ask ask him which which one of the kisses is that is this for is this for a true love or this for betrayer or this is a kiss to Lead Me to Hell Hallelujah Hallelujah the elect cannot be deceived and you know he keep changing himself as per the spirit that is governing the people at that particular time until the fourth time when he was coming he makes all the colors the bread the wine the black and everything so it became pale to deceive completely but little did he know that at that same time God was using the the spirit of the eagle to see where as far as he saw in the skies so clearer you see on the ground here so anywhere the Antichrist would change his color the eyes of the Lord is there to see praise be the name of our God hallelujah amen and amen now so he called he invited John to come up to see the thing that he was going to do and also to see the destruction that was coming upon the Earth he said don't come up that is what I love he said come up John I cannot do this whilst you are on this Earth I cannot pour destruction on this Earth whilst you are here so come up from among them to where I am oh my brother and my sister I believe you have ears to hear right now that that invitation is you is for you right now that God is calling amen now these 24 elders God willing Sunday if God permit will go into that into details but let me give just a gist of or what I want to put across here is it the 24 Elders they fall and they watch it why did they fall and worship they fell and worshiped because the ministry of the four living creatures was made in manifest and in the manifestation of their Ministry was where the Sons and Daughters of God came back to God we find out that in the ministry of Paul we believe that he used the spirit of the Lion okay to hold on the check to establish the church until he was bold enough to say what I have laid If any man come and change it let him be attached that was that was Paul he was he was so sure he knew very well that it was not himself but it was the Lord he said I didn't come with you with enticing west of man's Wisdom but I came in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit therefore the foundation that I have laid if anybody come the person should make sure that he's building upon that same Foundation what I've said if I come back and change it let me be a cash and if any man also come and change it even if an angel come from Heaven to change it let him be a case oh beloved you know how many people are cursing themselves today people say that women are also anointed to preach women are anointed to be pastors do they know that they are cursing themselves because Paul say that a woman cannot be and if they say that a woman can be it means they are cursing themselves Hallelujah if Paul say that women should have done themselves in mother's apparel with Jennifer sadness with sobriety and today people say or churches say that women that it doesn't matter what you wear it doesn't matter what you wear but to Paul it matters therefore the blood testing themselves amen what are we brother sister where are we at now we are in the word of God and if you are in the word of God then it means we are in God we and God we are inseparable nothing can separate us from the love of God that is why Paul says that what shall separate me from the love of God what nothing nothing because you are part of God and God is part of you that is why beloved God can not leave you on this Earth that is why he's throwing an invitation he is throwing invitation to you come up here before I do what I want to do to understand perhaps you are the nose of God right now as I came and you didn't see my nose will you recognize me brother Bill you wouldn't recognize brother Daniel so no there's not a Daniel I know that nothing I know he has nose Hallelujah perhaps when I came my head was not up okay and how can I come without my head he said brother somewhere else oh God we have brother Daniel here with us again and brother Daniel get up from the back and it's coming I don't have a head how do you know me that I'm Danielle brother any road that we play in the Lord it was funded before the foundation of the world God has a purpose for your life in the church ended being believer in a church you have a responsibility to carry out in the church because you are part of God and that part of God nobody can fix it you have to fix there Hallelujah you have to be on your position and do as the Lord wants you to do hey man now let me read this quickly from the prophet he said after the check Ages was over and everything was come ready or made ready the setting of the fourth chapter here the church edges was was done he had done left the Earth you see remember the voice that spoke to him behind him in the serving goddess candlesticks the work was finished and now that same voice was speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his utterly work was finished and he was in glory calling to John come up Higa Hallelujah I remember the prophet said that the day that the last bride member would believe the Rapture will take place I wish that he believed right now number coming right now because the bride is fed up of this world Hallelujah the world any longer their ideas has come to an end their science is circulating right now it's going round they don't have any place to go again there's nothing left for this word but destruction Hallelujah but God will not do that once you are here brother sister he must call you out from this mess to the place that he has prepared for issue amen now the prophet says that he had not redeemed his people it means he has finished redeeming his people God is not saving his people he had already saved them we are not just manifesting we are just taking our positions Hallelujah that is why our eyes must be open our ears must be open our hearts must be open to the world amen his ugly work was finished amen God makes me feel like shouting hmm yes sir oh my there you are he said come up here and I hear my name mentioned Hallelujah it is no longer join here but it is Daniel come out Peter if the sun will come up here it is built come up here Peter that is the sound today amen and amen oh my if they had the voice of the trumpet notes what John said he said it was like a trumpet that took with me and said come up here come up here I'll show you the church edges on Earth I have shown you the church edges on earth now come up here I am going to show you something taking place up here you see Christ had left Earth then he has gone up into Glory the church Edge was through showed that his Spirit was finishing and he got into glory and was calling for John to come up oh glory be to the name of our God the work of God is finished on this Earth I remember the prophet said that we are living in a borrowed time since from that time he said that we are living in a borrowed time how long is that borrow time going to be about time how long Hallelujah I said we live as if there we have so much years ahead of us it is right here now the Rapture is hanging on us it just hanging on us a circulating brothers and sisters don't look far look around you that you see the Bears of the Rapture hanging over you oh God have mercy Hallelujah that is why as believers it is time that we should not joke with our faith as Believers this time that we've got to ask ourselves questions this is the time that you should experience the power of God in your life by loving one another Hallelujah will you tell me that a brother step on your toe and for so many years you could not forgive him are you sure you can enter into the Rapture without sentiment in you the prophet says that the only thing that is going to make us enter into the Rapture is love and if my brother step on my toe he must just step on my toe and I'm I'm not able to act rightly forgive and I'm saying that I'm going to the Rapture which of the raptures am I going to which which of them Hallelujah this is the time brother my sister we should come up from anything that is drawing us back there's a time we should break any link of unbelief from us this is the time we should take Church attendance very seriously because their Prophet I always repeat that wherever I go he said this word that we are feeding on it is this same way that will break our body this word it is this word brother the power the Heat the Dead the night that you come and feed on God's word as you keep packing the word into your soul that word will break your body one of these days the Heat the heat the heat the anointing the power Hallelujah yes sir that's some word it is God who is the word because in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was God and the word become flesh is that not it and dwelt amongst us sometimes when we say it dwell among cash then we think that he is dwelling between brother Samuel and my precious brother here they dwell in your soul your soul dwell amongst us the heat will break your body hallelujah look at the foul the foul lay egg they're found don't hatch the egg you know that but the the only thing the foul has to do is to make sure it pooped over the egg so why it brewed over the egg the Heat okay from the body the skin you know make the the the the air to form chickens and then it will come to a Time the chicken will grow in that shell and it could no longer remain over there so the chick itself make a way and it breaks not the handbraking that the eggs and that's exactly what we are going to do that word that word that message of the hour the pillar of fire where the glory of God is as we pack the word it will break our bodies one of these days Hallelujah so what can you convince me that you can choose to stop coming to church you stay at home and feel that no brother sister it is not like that the bible say that forsake not the Assembly of ourselves together us it has been the manner of son as we see the day approaching I I always ask myself what day is the Bible talking about preach the name of our god oh brother my sister ah something is fixing to happen okay but I tell Daddy are not eating it from you God has opened your eyes to see it you see all this thing for the happen amen now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work year he went on up into heaven and said I will show you what is going to be hereafter after the church edges he said John I can't talk to you down there no more because I've left them there I've come up here so you to come up and the prophet said amen and I'll show you what is going to take place Hereafter oh my God he caught up in the vision amen how dear friend when John was caught up and see Jesus said write in a book what you have seen and give it back send it back to the churches Paul was forbidden to speak about it remember that Paul was caught up into the third heavens and he was not permitted to to even say what he saw but when John saw it he was commanded to write it in a book and send it to the seven churches oh Hallelujah it will stand that God was revealing himself to his people amen and I'm always happy that God put me in this age Hallelujah where the seals are open and the thing that happened in Paul's time when poor people didn't understand today with good understanding of those things Hallelujah because the seals have been opened in our time what a privileged people we are hallelujah oh brother I feel like jumping right now I feel like jumping right now amen are you not happy that you are one of them oh praise be to His holy name oh my God he says well Paul was forbidden to speak and John was even asked to put it in a book so it will go all down through the edges oh my it's revealed now to be revealed in this last days it wasn't revealed in his day it's revealed now as we go along Paul touched on Melchizedek but Paul was not able to explain to his people but we are the prophet in our time who told us who Mexico was until today the intellectuals the right reverence the Bishops they don't know even who met his other was they will argue about Melchizedek some will say that well he was a man he was a king of silent and you see uh you see you see they see but they don't see anything you see you see you see you see who was Melchizedek who is this America Hallelujah he has not beginning of days he has no end of days he are not father he has no mother and there is only one that qualifies for that and that is God our almighty God hallelujah Hallelujah you need a prophet to tell you this other or not you also say you see you see you see you see but at the end of the day you don't see anything Hallelujah Jesus Christ Arceus in this new testament so he was in the Old Testament same Jesus Christ he said Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of this new testament there's no question about that we are serving God by revelation and how can you have the Revelation without a prophet praise be the name of our God look at what we are today today everything is pointing to one thing the world is going one way and the bride is going another way we go where the Lord have designed and nobody can stop us but their world cannot come the way we are going Jesus said that the ways are too he said one is brought and many people there are found and that leads to destruction but there's another one that is very narrow very narrow way and it's few people and even a few people we have to be very careful because the road is very narrow that is why I should make sure that I will not step on my brother thought even even though by mistake if I step on your foot brother Malachi will you forgive me are you sure you forgive me very well so you don't say that well brother Daniel step on my foot and say he didn't apologize so I'm not I'm not going to forgive him oh no even if I don't do any sign of you know you have to forgive me it is your duty to forgive me I do not mind Beauty to beg you to forgive me Hallelujah are you catching it now you are it's your duty to forgive when I offend you you have to call my attention even to read but Daniel have you seen what you've done to me oh brother I'm sorry I didn't take note of it right now but sometimes we will not do that and we put that within us and from that day my brother become my enemy my sister become an enemy and you say that you are going into the Rapture what kind of the Rapture is it which one which one I don't think is this one I'm talking about amen hallelujah okay let me continue a little do I have time amen he says see how the resurrection will be it will be in a moment in the window of an eye that clears sounding voice and he will summon the church calling come on that Grace summoning voice oh he said God help me to hear it that day the prophet said that God help me to hear that day but today you are hearing it right now that sound of invitation is on right now God is calling you right now he said come up either Hallelujah the Bible says that through one man's sin came into the world and by one man also sin has been taken away and that is why we see Jesus Christ being our offered General leading us in a battle that we are fighting in this world you see our welfare are not Khanna but the almighty through Jesus Christ I agree that sometimes many times things will come your way it's a battle it's a battle but when the problems come your way when the troubles come your way tonight I want to advise you don't look to the troubles don't look to the the problems but look to the promises of God Hallelujah and there you are much on the Conqueror you say our they Almighty through Jesus Christ Mighty through Jesus Christ not Mighty through our efforts not make it through our Monies through our intellectuality but it's mighty through Jesus Christ so we offer only to look on his promises what will he do about it oh Lord there's my situation father I just committed into Almighty hands I sit down and see what the Lord is going to do I used to advise bringing back home that sometimes we pray concerning certain things and people will be dejected they don't even concentrate when they come to church because there's a problem there's a trouble I know sometimes very difficult but will you let that thing weigh you down will you let it go take your faith away I said brother you cannot do anything to solve that problem because if you can do it why don't you do it straight away you can't do it so what do you think about it until sometimes they don't even know whether they are in church or they are outside praise the name of our God our God is able and more than able to do exiting abundantly than what we ask amen now notice oh he finishes work in Earth on Earth and he has he has taken his church and now he sends the judgment the world rejected him and his son is judgment he and his church has gone to Glory oh my John under Patmos island the revelated to the church has been the type of the church which is lifted up into Glory he said come up here and I'll show you things hereafter oh my you say he represented the church yes sir to everyone that hears this word John represented him amen John was the representative of the blood of Jesus Christ testimony of the word he was a witness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with their personal fellowship with Christ and he represented the entire church that every man or woman boy or girl that ever believed in Christ and accept him on the same grounds he will be summoned someday let me repeat that please maybe you didn't hear he says he was a witness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost with a personal fellowship with Christ and he will presented the entire church and that is done we are representing Jesus Christ right now as we speak here we Are Witnesses of the Holy Spirit if somebody don't know the Holy Spirit you must show the person the Holy Spirit because the holy spirit is in you amen the holy spirit is in you Hallelujah we are the representative of the Holy Spirit the ambassadors of Heaven Hallelujah so he says he represented the entire church that every man or woman boy or girl that ever believed in Christ and accept him on the same grounds he will be summoned some of these days and I said praise God to that because I believe the word I believe that someone that Christ gave to John I believe the entire scripture everything that is listed in the word I believe it so I become what a believer of that word and the prophet is saying that boy girl man or woman who believe that one of these days he will be summoned I know you catch it now Hallelujah so what about right now if you say come up either come up either right now who is going to go I am going to go Hallelujah and I know you are going to go nobody will be left here why because you believe the same thing John believed amen come up hither and he caught up before the tribulation remember the tribulation time hasn't set in yet sir these are not retribulation the hurricanes and whatever whatever they call it the tsunamis and they are not tribulation your tribulation have not set any yet we are here the holy spirit is here so the tribulation cannot set in but the dirt that the church will be ruptured we take the holy spirit away from the side there the Antichrist will help is freedom to rule whatever they want to rule but that will be our back case we don't think about that we think about what we are going to see in heaven oh brother and my sister I just want to assure you that something has been prepared for you and it is for you it is for me and it's a style that will go and enjoy it our lovers are not going to be in vain Paul says that if people die and that is the end and the believer also die and that is the end then he said that we will be the most miserable people but there's Blessed assurance I said there's a Blessed assurance that one of these days the things that we have been saying singing about singing about talking about preaching about we are going to see it reality oh brother my sister sometimes there's a song Back Home say if I if I have a if I have thousand mouth and I have thousand tongues to sink the glory of God oh it's I'll be the most happiest I mean the most happiest person on this Earth with thousand mouth and thousand times to sing the goodness of God to sing about Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother my sister the war has ended and we are going to take our Glory amen those four living creatures the Bible says that when they give glory to the Lord the 24 elders they removed their crowns and they Bow Down and they worship God why will come to that government Sunday amen there is a reason for that why why would they worship and they sing the Praises Thou Art where the Thou Art Worthy O Lord to receive glory honor and Empire father has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created the border and they worship God during the ministry of these four living creatures and all these qualific creatures they are Ministry manifested within the seven Church edges you understand so therefore anytime a Ministry go off it gather the children of God anytime a mystery is graffiti it gather the children of God anytime a mission is revealed he gathered to the children of God until the seventh consecutive Church against was fulfilled and now God have his bride ready for the goal amen and it is the Joy or the desire of these 24 Elders to see to it that the ministry of Christ has been made manifested that's the reason why they were rejoicing amen remember that when John opened saw the book open and he found out that his name was in the book didn't he shout he shouted he shouted and the Bible said that immediately at the 24 others saw the book open then the bow down and they worshiped God yes because the Bride of Christ's name was going to be mentioned and they served the Lord and if you serve the Lord you must serve the queen Hallelujah you see why they were rejoicing oh I don't want to run God willing we are going to go into things amen but my joy tonight for you is brother I see that you are part of the invitation you are part of the invitation that invitation that Jesus Christ have thrown I say you are part of it therefore why don't you honor that invitation one thing one thing for somebody to invite you and it's another thing for you to honor the invitation Hallelujah the most important thing is the honoring of the invitation because if you don't honor the invitation what will happen perhaps the person who waste every effort to prepare something for you you understand that that is why in this end time brother and sister right now as we are living we must be very very careful of any step that we take as Christians my advice tonight assess your life I believe all of us will be Christians brother I believe all of us to be Believers my sisters the prophets say that we have three kinds of Believers yes I know that I believe that but whom am I going to point finger that you are an unbeliever or you are a believer and this one is I mean who can do that no brother all of us we see ourselves as Believers and for that matter my advice is that check everything that is within you anything that you know is going to be a hindrance for your goal as per the invitation put it aside don't let anything hinder your movement don't carry any weight to suppress you be lighter brother sister be light take every get this thing away from you amen it's just the grace of God that we are all Christians we didn't fend for it and sometimes people think that when we say grace uh Grace is that well Jesus have saved me so for that matter I can do anything that I want no Paul says that God forbid it God forbid it Grace is something that you ought to do but you are not able to do and somebody do it for you if I come and meet a very big gutter and I cannot cross over and I stand there I'm crying who helped me crossover and perhaps I see somebody come a very big giant he has long legs to cross over and then he will take me by my hand and move me across wouldn't I be happy I'll be very happy I will be very happy and I think I'll never even think of going by that way again that is what Christ has done for us we were born in sin we worshiped in iniquity that is why we came to this world lying doing so many things that were not you know enough you know good to do but the grace of God Rich us and God brought us to himself and God washed us and he made us clean Hallelujah that is why the angels and the 24 Elders were praising God they were praising God because of you because that you have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ they were praising God the Bible said that when a soul come to the Lord Heaven the angers Go Happy and they sing praises and they praise your brother sister right now because of you go and see heaven they are rejoicing they are praising they are magnifying God that is why you don't have to let them down don't let them down Let the Praises go on in heaven any step that you take it sounds holy in heaven because we're a holy Child of God Let It Go on that way and I'm looking to that day when all will be well and who all will be someone the Bible said that we are going to sing new song Hallelujah I said a new song and the angels will not even have any idea about it they will not understand we are going to sing about our Redemption how we were able to be redeemed we are going to sing about testimonies we have just wanted to give in heaven brother my sister we are going to sing new songs and they will not understand who are these and Jesus Christ will tell hey this is my wife Hallelujah and I pray tonight brother my sister that when that day come right now let me see you over there and I will make sure that you see me also God bless all of you shall we be [Applause] bruh Brian come over I want you to sing that song for me foreign [Music] as you stand on your feet I just want you to assess yourself think about it tonight think about it that invitation I've already told you that it is for you but is there anything that can hinder your movement is there anything that can move hinder you from honoring that invitation I believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that the road that you are not able to cross will help you to cross it right now the burden that is laying upon you and you're not able to live it the
