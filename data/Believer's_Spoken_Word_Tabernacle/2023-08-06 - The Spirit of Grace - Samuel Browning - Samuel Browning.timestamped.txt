[40:46] father may you just come now Lord

[40:52] in the name of Jesus Christ
[40:56] amen and amen
[41:00] God bless you musicians I want to say
[41:02] thank you and
[41:03] the song service this morning
[41:07] and God bless each of you and it's good
[41:09] to be in the house of the Lord
[41:11] amen we want to turn in the book of
[41:15] Hebrews to chapter 10 this morning
[41:26] and
[41:28] let's welcome each of you here
[41:34] I want to read here in verse 26 of
[41:37] Hebrews
[41:38] chapter 10.
[41:43] and the scripture reads like this in
[41:46] verse 26 for if we sin willfully
[41:50] after that we have received the
[41:52] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[41:55] no more sacrifice for sins
[41:58] but a certain fearful looking for of
[42:01] judgment and fiery indignation which
[42:05] shall Devour the adversaries
[42:08] he that despised Moses law
[42:11] died without Mercy under two or three
[42:15] Witnesses
[42:16] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[42:20] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[42:22] trodden underfoot the Son of God and
[42:25] hath counted the blood of the Covenant
[42:28] wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy
[42:31] thing
[42:32] and half done despite
[42:35] unto the spirit of Grace
[42:38] for we know him
[42:40] for we know him that hath said Vengeance
[42:43] belongeth unto me I will recompense
[42:46] saith the Lord and again the Lord shall
[42:49] judge his people
[42:50] it is a fearful thing
[42:52] to fall into the hands of the Living God
[42:57] I want to go back to verse 29. and
[43:01] that's where I want to draw
[43:03] the thought here this morning
[43:06] and where it speaks
[43:09] wherewith he was Sanctified an Unholy
[43:12] thing and hath done despite unto the
[43:15] spirit of Grace and I'd like to just
[43:17] speak if the Lord will help us this
[43:20] morning on the spirit of Grace
[43:23] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[43:25] of the word as we're being seated
[43:29] I want to just
[43:31] lay some background here with these
[43:33] scriptures just for a few moments
[43:36] because this
[43:41] portions of scripture along with Hebrews
[43:43] 6. it was very much a question
[43:46] in people's minds and the Holy Spirit in
[43:49] this age that we're living in
[43:51] God sending his prophet in this hour
[43:55] would go right into these scriptures
[43:58] that in some ways have Satan I'm gonna
[44:02] just say it in this way Satan has got a
[44:04] hold of it at times and he's wanted to
[44:07] haunt people with these scriptures
[44:09] I've set many times over times during
[44:12] the years sometimes where within this
[44:15] where someone had thought in some way of
[44:18] well did I uh you know did I uh did I
[44:21] did I cross the line and I just say it
[44:23] over and over as brother Branham because
[44:25] that same tormenting Spirit Came Upon
[44:27] individuals many times you would find
[44:29] when brother Brahman the prayer line
[44:31] when women were going through a Time the
[44:33] time of life and that weariness and how
[44:36] Satan would hit that upon them and you
[44:38] find the Holy Spirit would call that out
[44:40] and say you haven't crossed the line and
[44:43] you recognize that though maybe they
[44:46] weren't where they should be and some
[44:48] were where they should be with God but
[44:51] nonetheless God in his Mercy is here to
[44:54] always uncover the work of the enemy
[44:56] because God's desire is for you and me
[44:58] that we would walk with Clarity before
[45:00] us and let me just say it this way that
[45:03] if there's one promise no matter what
[45:05] that promise is that has not been
[45:08] obtained yet God's desire is that there
[45:11] would be such a clear pathway and that
[45:13] that promise itself would be so evident
[45:16] before you that your faith would be
[45:18] built in him to obtain that promise and
[45:21] God makes and he is the God who provides
[45:25] he's the sufficient one and I want to
[45:28] just just look here upon this scripture
[45:31] here just for a moment when we deal of
[45:33] the spirit of Grace because every one of
[45:36] us within our lives not only have we
[45:39] needed Grace we still need the grace of
[45:42] God and just to understand this that
[45:45] you'll find that the Holy Spirit through
[45:47] the message of the hour the Rapture
[45:49] itself is that of the grace of God it's
[45:53] rapturing Grace so we understand as we
[45:57] were looking at last week thee we're
[45:59] living in the time of the shout and
[46:02] within that shout there are shoutings of
[46:05] Grace
[46:06] this word is coming to encourage age you
[46:10] and I and I want you to understand as we
[46:12] look at even a few things here to kind
[46:14] of set the course not that what I'll
[46:16] tarry in today but to understand the
[46:18] word of God is here to bring us from
[46:22] where we are to where we should be and
[46:24] it's to encourage us if we're here then
[46:27] he wants to encourage us to move on
[46:29] deeper and so God's desire is to do that
[46:33] because when we look at this I want just
[46:36] laying this as he just is delivering it
[46:38] to my heart now that there are things
[46:41] that we could we do desire to see God to
[46:44] do but brother Brown would make it so
[46:46] clear to you and I that he says many
[46:49] people are saying well if God will just
[46:51] take this from me then I'll serve him if
[46:53] God will just do this and brother bran
[46:55] brings it down to the authority that
[46:57] somehow we seem to let slip away from us
[47:02] that we have the the authority to make a
[47:05] decision and the way that we make a
[47:08] decision is based on his presence that's
[47:11] dealing with us you can't make a
[47:13] decision based on where you're at or
[47:17] what entrapments or situations or I'm
[47:20] caught in this you can't make a decision
[47:22] based on that because you'll never have
[47:24] any faith to climb out of that but you
[47:26] have to make your decision based on the
[47:29] Living God who is present and dealing
[47:33] with your heart and just turn loose and
[47:35] say Lord take me there because he's the
[47:39] enforcer of his word
[47:42] is that right that's why brother Bram
[47:44] comes on to say so sometimes when we
[47:45] wonder why am I not seeing this in my
[47:48] life the way it should be I'm asking God
[47:50] to take it brother bam tells us there
[47:52] and this is out of marriage of the Lamb
[47:53] that I'm referring to he says but you've
[47:56] got a decision to make and I just want
[47:58] to say to you the authority and the
[48:00] power right now is not something that's
[48:03] far out there it's right there with you
[48:05] there's an authority that you have that
[48:08] the word of God you know the scripture
[48:10] says as many as believed him to them he
[48:15] gave the power the escousia the right to
[48:19] become the sons of God
[48:21] so it is God's presence that ministers
[48:24] to you and I those rights that belong to
[48:28] you and I it's so it's him it's him that
[48:31] is giving us Grace it's the spirit of
[48:34] Grace that's coming to encourage us into
[48:38] his grace
[48:39] into his word so this this when we look
[48:43] here in the scripture we find that in
[48:46] Israel as Paul is dealing here in in the
[48:49] book of Hebrews and remember among the
[48:51] Hebrews here when you you take into the
[48:53] Hebrew series when brother Branham is
[48:56] going through that series brother Brown
[48:58] is dealing very much the spirit of God
[49:00] just as it was here within Hebrews is
[49:02] setting that place is setting the church
[49:04] into a place to realize that you're not
[49:07] resting upon your Works you're resting
[49:09] upon the grace of God now that's not to
[49:12] say well I don't have to do nothing
[49:13] that's not what it's saying it what it's
[49:16] simply saying is is that if we are
[49:18] trusting in our works to somehow Merit
[49:22] something from God we're missing the
[49:24] grace of God that is there ministering
[49:27] to us that we might yield Our Lives to
[49:30] him you see the law in itself it only
[49:33] comes to point out that you're wrong
[49:35] that you're guilty but Grace comes to
[49:38] Maine to men Minister Redemption to you
[49:41] and I and that's what the grace of God
[49:43] has come forth to bring us into the
[49:46] promises of almighty God and we we need
[49:50] the grace of God in our lives uh
[49:53] throughout our lives and when I say that
[49:55] of the grace of God I'm not speaking of
[49:58] and I trust that you understand me of
[50:00] where we live a life that's a life of
[50:02] imbalance and we're in and out and up
[50:04] and down truly there is Grace that will
[50:06] hold to a person can really come to a
[50:09] place because if they belong to God
[50:10] they're going to come to that place but
[50:13] I'm talking about a Grace because the
[50:15] Bible says that we would approach the
[50:16] throne of grace and I I just believe and
[50:19] I know as a witness it's not just it's
[50:21] not just Grace for failings and mistakes
[50:24] we need that but it's Grace that when
[50:26] the word speaks to our lives and God
[50:29] ministers to us and we say Lord granted
[50:32] Lord God let it be in my life Lord Jesus
[50:35] because we're not approaching uh the
[50:38] Judgment seat remember the same seat
[50:41] with blood on it was a seed of Mercy but
[50:44] with the blood off of it it became a
[50:47] judgment seat we are not approaching a a
[50:51] seat that is empty of blood but as a
[50:54] matter of fact it is blood covered and
[50:58] that's what this message is it's the
[51:00] revealing of the blood covering it's the
[51:03] revealing of the blood it's the
[51:05] revealing of God's presence and working
[51:08] that is Mindful and mindful and great to
[51:12] work with every situation
[51:17] so here Israel's in a journey
[51:20] and they're in a journey to a Promised
[51:22] Land and Joshua
[51:25] brother Brown will take this over and
[51:27] over Joshua being a type of the grace of
[51:29] God that was with them through the whole
[51:32] entire Journey
[51:34] because it was Grace that gave them a
[51:38] prophet
[51:40] Grace provided the pillar of fire that
[51:43] accompanied it to confirm what this
[51:47] vessel is saying it's not the vessel
[51:49] it's my word
[51:51] this is the season because when God's
[51:54] speaking a word God is there to fulfill
[51:57] that word
[51:59] are you with me God's there to fulfill
[52:02] it and the pillar of fire was there as
[52:04] the grace of God provided to a company
[52:06] that messenger and that message and let
[52:09] me just say this the pillar of fire has
[52:12] never left this message
[52:14] [Music]
[52:16] is the same Pillar of Fire that is
[52:19] leading us all the way into the body
[52:22] change
[52:25] it's God that is quickening you and I
[52:28] and he's making the promises of God more
[52:31] real to you and I and is changing our
[52:34] lives from Glory unto Glory
[52:36] so it was the accompaniment of God's
[52:38] grace that brought signs and wonders and
[52:41] miracles there in Egypt it was it was
[52:45] the signs and the voice that came behind
[52:47] that sign it was Grace that provided the
[52:51] power to part the Red Sea as a pain a
[52:55] path to escape their pursuers it is the
[52:57] same Spirit of Grace that would take
[52:59] them across according to the word of God
[53:02] in the appointed time it is Grace that
[53:06] would move down to make known the time
[53:08] of the promise but we would know that we
[53:11] would know that at kadish barnia but
[53:13] they would not accept God's grace to
[53:15] take them over regardless of the
[53:18] obstacles
[53:20] now I want you to see this here this
[53:22] morning God's grace was providing for
[53:26] them all along even where God would send
[53:30] spies into the land to bring back fruit
[53:34] to walk around the the land and as they
[53:38] came back remember There Were Ten that
[53:42] came back with an evil report
[53:45] it wasn't that there weren't Giants over
[53:47] there there were giants over there there
[53:50] was some big walls there were some big
[53:53] obstacles to be taken
[53:57] but there were two of them
[53:59] Caleb stood up and said we're more than
[54:02] able
[54:04] and if the Lord is for us and he is for
[54:07] us how do you know he's for you Caleb
[54:09] look where he brought us out we sure
[54:12] didn't get ourselves out of Egypt
[54:14] we didn't open the Red Sea
[54:17] right we haven't provided this manner
[54:22] uh we're not the ones that has provided
[54:25] the water it's the rock that's followed
[54:27] us
[54:28] you see what was Caleb doing Caleb was
[54:32] mindful of the Living God who had been
[54:35] pressing all the time and Caleb was
[54:39] receiving that Grace in his life and
[54:43] that's why he could see more grace
[54:48] are you with me now because that the
[54:52] word as we receive Grace the grace of
[54:54] God it brings us into a place to see
[54:57] more of God's grace because it is the
[55:00] grace of God that takes you and I from
[55:03] this point to this point from this point
[55:06] to this point from this point to this
[55:08] point it is the grace of God
[55:14] and this is where the scripture that
[55:17] we're reading here is many examples in
[55:20] the scriptures that it applies to where
[55:22] it speaks where they who despised Moses
[55:27] law died under two or three Witnesses uh
[55:31] and and I I don't want to get into just
[55:33] too many examples of that this morning
[55:35] but I want to just say that in this here
[55:38] that if there is something in your heart
[55:40] that says Lord I care about your word
[55:43] I care about what your desire is
[55:47] I may not understand it but I care Lord
[55:50] and I I desire Lord that as that care
[55:53] let it deepen in my life let me tell you
[55:56] that's something there that's in your
[55:58] heart that's not despising the spirit of
[56:00] Grace it's inviting the grace that's
[56:04] being ministered to you
[56:11] my my mind
[56:14] and half done despite so they come to a
[56:18] place but have done despite and to
[56:20] despite the spirit of Grace how many
[56:22] know that that the Lord Jesus when they
[56:25] were speaking concerning him and they
[56:26] called him Bill said bobbin everything
[56:28] else and he says you speak one word
[56:31] against the son of man it'll be forgiven
[56:33] you but when the Holy Ghost has come to
[56:36] speak one word against it it'll never be
[56:39] forgiven you in this life and in the
[56:42] world to come
[56:43] he was letting him know because what was
[56:45] the coming of the Holy Ghost that is God
[56:49] vindicating not only what he was proving
[56:52] in the ministry of the son of man when
[56:54] he was here but now the coming of the
[56:56] Holy Ghost says everything that was
[56:59] Vindicated everything that he said it is
[57:02] now in full force that Liberty has come
[57:06] and he indeed is the true Lamb of God do
[57:10] you realize what the coming of the Holy
[57:12] Ghost is in your life in my life it is a
[57:16] Vindication that he is the true Lamb of
[57:19] God and I am a part of that
[57:21] not just something we talk about we
[57:24] don't just talk about Calvary we have
[57:27] experienced that day on Calvary
[57:31] it has been that which has touched our
[57:33] life our hearts have been have been
[57:36] brought to that place that we and
[57:38] ourselves recognize that he did it for
[57:41] me and the revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:44] breaking forth upon our life and let me
[57:47] just say it like this may we never ever
[57:50] get to big or too tired of taking trips
[57:55] to Calvary
[57:58] just hearing the prophet even the other
[58:00] day of listening to a message and
[58:02] brother Brown says we just need another
[58:04] trip to Calvary
[58:06] you say what is it with the trip to
[58:08] Calvary it's a humility it's recognizing
[58:11] we're nothing of our own it's
[58:13] recognizing he's made the full purchase
[58:15] for you and I and recognizing that no
[58:18] matter what the need is and the obstacle
[58:19] I don't care how great it looks it's to
[58:21] recognize that he made a way for you and
[58:24] I and the spirit of almighty God the
[58:27] spirit of Grace is here to make real and
[58:30] to bring you into every single promise
[58:33] that God has made
[58:34] it's the spirit of Grace and that's what
[58:38] the Holy Ghost is
[58:40] so to despite that remember to despite
[58:43] it is is uh and I just want to refer I
[58:46] didn't want to put these on the screen
[58:47] but it's too insult or to re uh
[58:51] shamefully entreat or to behave uh in a
[58:54] very stubborn like way uh to injure one
[58:58] by speaking evil of them so uh when we
[59:01] look at this to do despite to the spirit
[59:03] of Grace God bringing them along and
[59:07] brother Brandon would say it like this
[59:08] in the unpardonable sin he said sin is
[59:12] rejecting the will of God
[59:15] sin in its initial form is to reject the
[59:20] revealed word of God or will of God when
[59:24] God has revealed something as his will
[59:27] and to reject that is to blaspheme or to
[59:31] reject God
[59:32] remember what Cain did God Vindicated
[59:35] Abel's sacrifice
[59:37] right
[59:38] and Cain got upset about it
[59:41] but then God came to Cain and he says if
[59:43] you'll just do like your brother if thou
[59:45] do us well
[59:46] Thou shalt also be accepted and brother
[59:49] Brandon brings that down for us and says
[59:51] if you'll do like your brother's doing
[59:52] I'll accept you
[59:54] God's acceptance of Cain was not to make
[59:56] him a bride member but at least he would
[59:59] have respect unto the Vindication of the
[1:00:02] witness of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:04] but Cain was unable to Humble himself in
[1:00:09] God's presence
[1:00:10] are you hearing me now Cain was able to
[1:00:13] Humble himself brother bran brings us
[1:00:15] out he was able to Humble himself to
[1:00:17] build a church
[1:00:19] to build an altar to bring fruits but he
[1:00:22] wasn't able to Humble himself to this
[1:00:25] level of humility to the word of God you
[1:00:29] say well what would be able to do that
[1:00:31] it would be an offspring of God
[1:00:33] that would be able to Humble themselves
[1:00:35] to God
[1:00:37] you say well show that in the scripture
[1:00:39] it's very clear God himself humbled
[1:00:42] himself to become one of us he became
[1:00:45] his own word
[1:00:48] the word was made flesh
[1:00:51] he took upon him the prophet says it
[1:00:53] like this a body of humiliation
[1:00:56] the body that surrounded the king of
[1:00:58] glory it was not fitting for the king of
[1:01:02] glory
[1:01:03] but he became one of us as the prophet
[1:01:05] said he took our form upon him that he
[1:01:09] might mold his character inside of you
[1:01:11] and I because there had to be a
[1:01:14] propitiation that would go before you
[1:01:17] and I to meet the justice of God then we
[1:01:21] might receive God's mercy
[1:01:24] Sin Sin notice in its initial form is to
[1:01:30] reject the revealed word of God
[1:01:32] and brother Brown continues there's many
[1:01:34] uh scriptures that or quotes that I
[1:01:37] could go to but I I want to lay this in
[1:01:39] because uh the message of the hour lays
[1:01:42] it so clear and brother Brown picks this
[1:01:44] up again within this thought he said
[1:01:46] Paul here is speaking if a man ever
[1:01:49] comes to a spot that he's been saved and
[1:01:53] Sanctified the blood sanctifies Hebrews
[1:01:56] 13 12 and 13 says the blood sanctifies
[1:01:59] and then comes right up to the gate of
[1:02:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:02:05] because of prestige or denomination
[1:02:07] refuses to walk in it now let me just
[1:02:10] let me just let's clarify this right
[1:02:12] here anything that is esteemed above the
[1:02:16] word of God
[1:02:17] let me tell you something there has been
[1:02:20] lives that have turned away the grace of
[1:02:22] God for relationships
[1:02:25] are you with me they've they've turned
[1:02:27] the grace of God for the opposite sex
[1:02:30] I'm going to preacher now
[1:02:32] they they have taken that and even when
[1:02:35] God you say what do you mean by that I'm
[1:02:37] talking about when God would bring to
[1:02:39] the attention that this is the grace of
[1:02:42] God moving for that life and here that
[1:02:44] they would just want to just seemingly
[1:02:46] walk away now let me just let me just
[1:02:48] put a precursor here let me just say it
[1:02:50] like this right here friends and there
[1:02:52] is nothing and no one that this guy
[1:02:55] writes off
[1:02:57] are you understanding me God himself is
[1:03:00] the one who interprets this he didn't
[1:03:02] leave it to you he didn't leave it to me
[1:03:04] because let me just put another quote
[1:03:06] out there in the message Paradox brother
[1:03:08] Brandon said you take an unbeliever
[1:03:10] that's sending here tonight and here he
[1:03:12] is speaking against these things and you
[1:03:14] let the Holy Ghost get a hold of his
[1:03:16] life he said the next night he'll be
[1:03:19] standing up glorifying God and
[1:03:21] testifying to the mercy of God
[1:03:26] so I do the same believe it's something
[1:03:28] that to take Serious
[1:03:32] are you with me
[1:03:34] now that person said now see brother REM
[1:03:37] said that person is lost and can never
[1:03:39] be saved for he's done despite even to
[1:03:41] the very works of Grace that's called
[1:03:43] him up to that place and shown it to him
[1:03:45] and then turn around and walk away from
[1:03:47] it he counts the blood of the Covenant
[1:03:49] wherewith he was crucified Christ was
[1:03:51] crucified as an Unholy thing because
[1:03:54] watch this now because the blood that
[1:03:56] saved him and Justified him and
[1:03:59] Sanctified him brings him up to the
[1:04:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then he
[1:04:03] walks away and leaves it now brother
[1:04:06] Brandon goes on to say you're catching
[1:04:08] that the blood has been working all
[1:04:11] along it's just like God's grace brought
[1:04:13] him out of Egypt and it's God working
[1:04:15] all along
[1:04:18] all right are you with me
[1:04:20] now let me just say it like this just
[1:04:23] because you've seen somebody or know
[1:04:25] somebody
[1:04:26] that you say Well it don't seem like
[1:04:28] they've went on with God you commit the
[1:04:30] grace of God and you commit that life to
[1:04:32] the grace of God just as you commit your
[1:04:34] own life
[1:04:36] are you hearing me now this morning
[1:04:38] God's grace bringing us up into a place
[1:04:42] to where there's something to wear that
[1:04:44] brings us up to that of the baptism of
[1:04:46] the Holy Ghost now what she says brother
[1:04:49] and said I'm setting a pattern I'm
[1:04:50] taking a lot of time but look Judas
[1:04:52] Iscariot followed those same tracks he
[1:04:55] was justified by Believing on the Lord
[1:04:57] Jesus and then accepting him and his
[1:05:00] personal savior he was Sanctified and
[1:05:02] give powers to cast out Spirits put his
[1:05:05] name on the Lamb's Book of Life but when
[1:05:07] it come to Pentecost and the baptism of
[1:05:10] the Holy Ghost the fullness of the word
[1:05:13] he showed his colors that's what the
[1:05:16] Canaan spies did and that's exactly what
[1:05:20] Esau did
[1:05:21] now remember Esau was a good moral
[1:05:24] person
[1:05:25] Esau was a better moral person than
[1:05:27] Jacob
[1:05:29] is that right now to come to that notice
[1:05:33] into the fullness of the word now when
[1:05:37] we look at this brother bam would also
[1:05:38] go on to say he's talking about the True
[1:05:40] Vine and false Vine he said they're both
[1:05:42] growing side by side and did you realize
[1:05:45] that Judas Iscariot was treasurer of the
[1:05:47] church and out of the same tribe of the
[1:05:49] Lord Jesus he was a big man Brothers
[1:05:52] with the rest of them sat in the same
[1:05:55] Pew sang the same songs worship the same
[1:05:58] God preach the same gospel and was Judas
[1:06:01] do you realize that same spirit moves
[1:06:03] right up through the church but where
[1:06:05] Judas showed his colors was at Pentecost
[1:06:08] just before Pentecost before they really
[1:06:12] got born again brother Brian said people
[1:06:14] will do the tonight he said many people
[1:06:17] don't believe there's such a thing as an
[1:06:19] experience of being born again they say
[1:06:20] it's all in your mind no it's in your
[1:06:23] heart
[1:06:25] now brother Brandon goes on the message
[1:06:27] the token and wants you to watch how he
[1:06:29] speaks of this scripture here and he's
[1:06:31] Abraham we just want to break in on this
[1:06:34] part and has done despite unto the
[1:06:37] spirit of Grace which come from the
[1:06:40] blood he said Minister remember good man
[1:06:43] moral man whatever you are and you know
[1:06:46] that God taken cigarettes from you women
[1:06:49] you know he has taken shorts and short
[1:06:51] hair and everything you know he did that
[1:06:54] now if he's if if he's not done that yet
[1:06:57] let him do it
[1:06:59] the more you give yourself to him it's
[1:07:01] him that takes things away from your
[1:07:03] life
[1:07:05] are you with me but remember you've got
[1:07:07] to make a decision and what encourages
[1:07:10] and strengthens your decision is your
[1:07:12] heart submitted in obedience to the word
[1:07:14] of God not your feelings about it not
[1:07:17] all your pastor present where you're
[1:07:19] standing but where the Living God is
[1:07:21] right before you and making his word
[1:07:24] known that's a time to act on it and say
[1:07:26] be it unto me Lord according to Thy word
[1:07:28] let the same grace of God that brought
[1:07:31] me to repentance May the same grace of
[1:07:33] God work to dismantle every unclean
[1:07:36] habit every unclean thing out of my life
[1:07:39] let it sanctify my life oh god notice he
[1:07:44] taking it out of your life
[1:07:46] how by decision there has to be a
[1:07:49] decision that's made in other words we
[1:07:53] can't set neutral and expect God to do
[1:07:55] things I'm telling you this morning
[1:07:57] remember you've got Authority
[1:08:00] you don't become a son and daughter of a
[1:08:03] God here at the altar you do not become
[1:08:05] a son and daughter of God when you get
[1:08:07] the Holy Ghost you become a manifested
[1:08:10] son and daughter of God but it is that
[1:08:12] being a son and daughter of God that the
[1:08:14] word comes to give you power right it
[1:08:18] gives you the authority to make a
[1:08:20] decision and say I'm not going to live
[1:08:22] here no longer
[1:08:24] I'm not going to make an excuse for the
[1:08:27] condition I'm going to take God at his
[1:08:29] word
[1:08:30] that's the grace of God that's a heart
[1:08:33] that though you might say but where I'm
[1:08:35] standing but you're not looking at where
[1:08:37] you're standing you're looking to the
[1:08:39] spirit of Grace that is coming to lead
[1:08:42] you on
[1:08:46] sometimes let me kind of come back to
[1:08:48] this sometimes the reason lives can come
[1:08:50] up to a certain place and then they kind
[1:08:52] of want to go away because Satan wants
[1:08:54] to discourage that life
[1:08:56] are you hearing me he wants to
[1:08:58] discourage that life and then he starts
[1:09:00] coming in there well the promise isn't
[1:09:02] for you and this isn't for you let me
[1:09:04] tell you something you'll never hear God
[1:09:06] ever say words like that
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:09] never has God ever said that you can't
[1:09:10] find one scripture where God has ever
[1:09:12] told somebody that A promise is not for
[1:09:15] you
[1:09:16] but it's on the contrary God has taken
[1:09:18] his promises he manifests his promises
[1:09:21] and in turn Works to encourage you and I
[1:09:23] and sometimes listen to me the way the
[1:09:25] enemy will work upon a life is to work
[1:09:28] in such a way and you don't realize
[1:09:29] listen to me this is why brother Adam
[1:09:31] says that when you've given your heart
[1:09:33] to God he said you go forth with the
[1:09:36] confession he said I don't care what
[1:09:38] anything else says you get it from The
[1:09:40] Altar and say Lord the Lord Jesus has
[1:09:43] forgiven me of my sins he is my savior
[1:09:46] and brother Brahm said you watch that
[1:09:48] confession it will work righteousness in
[1:09:51] your life
[1:09:52] what are you saying I'm telling you
[1:09:54] throw down fear because they don't got
[1:09:56] no value in it
[1:09:58] fear is only put there to try to hinder
[1:10:01] you and hold you back from what the
[1:10:03] promise that God has for you your faith
[1:10:06] can never rest in your own abilities
[1:10:08] because you don't have the strength to
[1:10:10] do this but your faith must Rest In The
[1:10:13] Sovereign Grace of almighty God the
[1:10:17] spirit of Grace that moves down to bring
[1:10:19] such a change in your life
[1:10:25] sometimes you get around well you know
[1:10:27] the devil's telling me this and the
[1:10:28] Satan's telling me this and I no he
[1:10:30] comes and he wants to say all sorts of
[1:10:32] things to all of us let me just ask you
[1:10:35] this right here what have you been given
[1:10:37] your ear to her the most
[1:10:39] sometimes it sometimes it's what you're
[1:10:41] feeding on that allows things to build
[1:10:44] up in your life
[1:10:46] are you hearing me it's what you begin
[1:10:48] to feed on and it builds up to a place
[1:10:50] you say brother Samuel what do you say
[1:10:52] I'm telling you to evaluate you me
[1:10:55] evaluating your life where you're at
[1:10:57] with God if there's things in your life
[1:10:59] that you don't feel like you can even
[1:11:01] make a step forward and the enemy is
[1:11:03] wanting to bring such condemnation on
[1:11:05] your life I'm telling you there is the
[1:11:07] spirit of Grace right here this morning
[1:11:10] if you just accept it
[1:11:13] here we are
[1:11:15] say God I've allowed too many other
[1:11:18] cares of life I've allowed too many
[1:11:20] other things
[1:11:25] hey come on I ain't preaching the angels
[1:11:28] I'm preaching to Sons and Daughters of
[1:11:30] God that are still in this flesh body
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:33] and if you can accept that it is the
[1:11:35] spirit of Grace that's Desiring to lead
[1:11:38] you out of that trap you've got in
[1:11:42] and I say that in the name of the Lord
[1:11:46] I want to just say it like this brother
[1:11:51] as you turn around and do despite and
[1:11:53] count the blood of the Covenant as it
[1:11:55] was an Unholy thing who Sanctified you
[1:11:58] and brought you this far who took the
[1:12:00] things out of your life
[1:12:03] Francis and who gave you a desire to
[1:12:05] serve God
[1:12:07] but the man said like these spies they
[1:12:10] come up around the Borderland and they
[1:12:12] looked over and said well I know it's
[1:12:14] there but the obstacle is too green we
[1:12:15] look like grasshoppers they perished in
[1:12:17] the wilderness borderline Believers
[1:12:20] don't know watch this don't just come
[1:12:22] this far and say I believe the message
[1:12:25] you obey the messenger
[1:12:30] now you first got to believe before you
[1:12:33] can obey
[1:12:34] but believing is not obeying
[1:12:38] obeying is submission and yielding in
[1:12:41] your heart to his presence
[1:12:43] I know it's simple but that's what
[1:12:46] obedience is and that's what God
[1:12:47] requires
[1:12:49] you know Saul had a great sacrifice Saul
[1:12:52] did a lot of things but God said hey you
[1:12:54] know what I don't care about all these
[1:12:55] sheep I don't care about all these oxen
[1:12:57] I don't care about all this your
[1:12:59] parading in front of here what Maya what
[1:13:01] I esteem more than anything else is
[1:13:03] obedience to my voice even when it don't
[1:13:06] make sense to you when it steps on your
[1:13:08] toes no matter what it is against your
[1:13:10] own better thinking obedience to the
[1:13:13] word of God is better than any sacrifice
[1:13:16] that you can make
[1:13:18] is that right that's what took place in
[1:13:21] the Garden of Eden disobedience
[1:13:24] one under deception and one disobeyed
[1:13:27] with his eyes open
[1:13:29] and God leads us back to a life of
[1:13:31] obedience that's what the spirit of
[1:13:33] Grace comes to do is to do what lead the
[1:13:36] Lambs of God into life
[1:13:40] because you always were a sheep so the
[1:13:42] spirit of Grace the spirit of the doubt
[1:13:44] seeks out the lamb yeah and just as it
[1:13:48] led the lamb to Calvary to the
[1:13:49] Fulfillment of every word The Same
[1:13:51] Spirit of Grace moves upon the Lambs of
[1:13:54] God to lead us into the Fulfillment of
[1:13:57] the word
[1:13:59] ah notice he says I believe the message
[1:14:01] he said you obey the messenger come into
[1:14:03] Christ and you say well I believe every
[1:14:05] word said brother Branham that's good
[1:14:07] but that's just being able to read take
[1:14:10] the message take it into your heart that
[1:14:14] you must have the token the very life
[1:14:17] that was in Christ be in you
[1:14:21] now let me just give this scripture here
[1:14:23] as we prepare to turn here just a moment
[1:14:26] in Matthew Chapter 5 Verse 6 I I trust
[1:14:29] that you can understand that where we
[1:14:31] are standing in this hour that for a
[1:14:34] Believer when I read those scriptures
[1:14:36] there before you'll never find a
[1:14:38] Believer there in those scriptures but
[1:14:40] you'll find those that will come up
[1:14:42] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] that come up which is the fullness of
[1:14:46] the word the word living out in the life
[1:14:49] of the believer deity being expressed
[1:14:51] but we'll come up to that and say we're
[1:14:53] not able over some excuse and speak ill
[1:14:56] of the word of God let me say this
[1:14:58] there's never been a mortal that could
[1:15:01] ever live the word of God under their
[1:15:03] own strength and their own Merit there's
[1:15:06] no freedom in that whatsoever but there
[1:15:08] is a freedom that comes with knowing the
[1:15:11] Lord God even the prophets like David
[1:15:13] and others that receive a visitations of
[1:15:17] the spirit of Grace but never had the
[1:15:19] privilege of the indwelling of the
[1:15:22] spirit of divine grace is that right
[1:15:25] that's why David could say take not thy
[1:15:27] free spirit that of Grace away from my
[1:15:30] life Lord God but restore unto me the
[1:15:33] joy of thy salvation but you and I have
[1:15:37] been given the privilege on this side of
[1:15:39] Calvary and in this hour to be a
[1:15:42] partaker of the grace of almighty God
[1:15:45] the spirit of Grace that lifts you and I
[1:15:49] from a sinner into a place as a saint
[1:15:52] when it transforms our lives from that
[1:15:55] of just our unearthly mortal walking
[1:15:58] around to a manifested son and daughter
[1:16:01] of God what does that the spirit of
[1:16:04] Grace
[1:16:05] [Music]
[1:16:07] that's why it it is his presence that
[1:16:10] energizes you and me to say be it unto
[1:16:13] me Lord according to Thy Word
[1:16:15] that's why you know you got respect you
[1:16:18] know like I said there might be a life
[1:16:20] that maybe they've come to a certain
[1:16:22] place with God and maybe they you know
[1:16:24] it kind of kind of Fallen away and
[1:16:25] fallen off but that scripture ain't
[1:16:27] applying there that scripture only
[1:16:29] applies when those who come up and
[1:16:31] willfully stand and reject the truth
[1:16:33] wipe their feet on it that's the place
[1:16:36] where the scripture applies to but if
[1:16:38] there is something that moves in your
[1:16:40] heart let me tell you you didn't put
[1:16:42] that in your heart but this is what you
[1:16:44] need to do don't just let it be a desire
[1:16:46] that's there in a holding pattern say
[1:16:49] God you made a way for this desire to
[1:16:53] come to a full reality I'll do whatever
[1:16:55] it takes Lord whatever the word requires
[1:16:59] Lord I want to come all the way
[1:17:06] this is why the scripture applies
[1:17:07] Matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do
[1:17:11] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:17:13] for they shall be filled
[1:17:18] see a person's even blessed to want it
[1:17:21] just blessed to want it
[1:17:24] for those who hunger and thirst who put
[1:17:26] that in their God that's why the Holy
[1:17:28] Spirit last week as we were preaching on
[1:17:30] the depths of God's grace where a person
[1:17:32] said you don't know my condition brother
[1:17:34] brother Brown you don't know my
[1:17:36] condition I'm this and I'm that and I'm
[1:17:37] winning then this and brother Abraham
[1:17:39] says you're not past the stage of
[1:17:40] redemption you're setting in this church
[1:17:42] this morning
[1:17:44] do you realize it's God that song you
[1:17:48] just sung there's one more move God's
[1:17:50] the one that has the last word
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:53] I feel like preaching right now we are
[1:17:56] living in the hour of the revealing of
[1:17:59] the amen of God he who has the final
[1:18:02] word
[1:18:03] your situation is not the final word
[1:18:05] your family tree is not the final word
[1:18:08] your inabilities are not the final word
[1:18:11] your failures are not the final word
[1:18:15] but the amen of God
[1:18:17] the Soviet of God the god that's here to
[1:18:21] uncover who you really are
[1:18:24] the god that's here to speak over your
[1:18:26] life
[1:18:27] and that you can rise in that Grace and
[1:18:31] bless yourself in the god of the amen
[1:18:35] truth the god who's revealing you always
[1:18:38] were a son and daughter of God
[1:18:41] who calls you
[1:18:43] God who's drawing your life
[1:18:48] take that devil
[1:18:56] like that song you sing the precious
[1:18:58] love of God no wall he won't tear down
[1:19:04] rehab was walled in but he tore it down
[1:19:07] to get to her
[1:19:09] she couldn't tear down that wall
[1:19:12] she couldn't see her way out
[1:19:15] but God tore it down
[1:19:19] how did he tear it down he teared he
[1:19:22] tore it down with seven mysterious
[1:19:24] Thunders he tore it down with the word
[1:19:28] of Grace and shoutings of Grace
[1:19:32] oh they were walking in silence around
[1:19:35] and around but eventually on that
[1:19:37] seventh day they were to walk seven
[1:19:40] times and there was to come a shout out
[1:19:43] of them at that time what was it it was
[1:19:45] the grace of almighty God
[1:19:50] there's no situation brother Samuel
[1:19:52] that's an awful deep statement he's an
[1:19:54] awful big God
[1:19:57] [Applause]
[1:19:59] if you want to limit God that's up to
[1:20:01] you but God is not limited to me
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:09] now let me just trying to work this in
[1:20:12] here so the grace of God the true Spirit
[1:20:16] of Grace it comes forth with a message
[1:20:19] to advance the Church of the Living God
[1:20:22] forward
[1:20:24] it's always to be going forward
[1:20:27] not staying the same
[1:20:29] not going backward
[1:20:31] but going forward and incidentally
[1:20:33] staying the same is actually backsliding
[1:20:36] because he's moving on and we're staying
[1:20:37] the same
[1:20:38] so let me just say it like this we want
[1:20:40] to be content with the presence of God
[1:20:43] but never complacent in our walk
[1:20:47] we want to be content with him right but
[1:20:51] the brand says to be sufficiently
[1:20:52] impressed with the word that's in our
[1:20:53] midst the one who's working
[1:20:55] but we don't want to become complacent
[1:20:57] there's more of God for us
[1:21:01] right you're hearing me now now so we
[1:21:04] understand this that there is a call now
[1:21:06] I want to go here to Exodus 33 verse 12
[1:21:09] and I want to work with this advancement
[1:21:10] of Grace here just for a little bit and
[1:21:12] maybe laying some groundwork for some
[1:21:14] for for services ahead in Exodus 33
[1:21:17] verse 12. and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:21:20] see thou sayest unto me bring up this
[1:21:23] people and thou Hast not let me know
[1:21:26] whom thou Wilt sin with me yet thou has
[1:21:28] said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast
[1:21:32] also found Grace in my sight
[1:21:35] so Lord you've told me that I have found
[1:21:37] Grace in your sight
[1:21:39] I found favor now therefore watch this
[1:21:42] in verse 13. now therefore I pray thee
[1:21:44] if I have found Grace in thy sight show
[1:21:48] me now thy way that I might Know Thee
[1:21:51] that I might find Grace in thy sight and
[1:21:54] consider that this nation is thy people
[1:21:56] now notice God's already told him you
[1:22:00] have already found Grace in my sight he
[1:22:02] couldn't say this to God if God hadn't
[1:22:05] already made it known to him and God
[1:22:07] just didn't say something God Vindicated
[1:22:10] it with his presence because he told him
[1:22:13] go down there and I will be with thee
[1:22:19] right God said I'll be with him now
[1:22:21] Moses is carrying this in his heart thou
[1:22:24] hast thou have found Grace in thy sight
[1:22:26] now he's asking in verse 13 if I have
[1:22:30] found Grace in thy sight show me now thy
[1:22:33] way that I might Know Thee thy way thy
[1:22:37] character thy nature thy life thy person
[1:22:41] I want to see you Lord I you spoke to me
[1:22:45] you've showed your grace to me but I
[1:22:48] want to know your way
[1:22:50] let me tell you what this is this is a
[1:22:54] man a Son of God that is Desiring for
[1:22:57] more of the grace of almighty God
[1:23:01] this is a life that is saying I do not
[1:23:03] trust my own way
[1:23:06] because I've walked that before
[1:23:09] I've done Moses before you know they say
[1:23:11] do you I've done Moses before and it
[1:23:13] don't work out too good
[1:23:15] I've tried to do a lot of things tried
[1:23:17] to accomplish a lot of things but I
[1:23:19] don't want my way this is a man that has
[1:23:22] experienced the grace of God and knows
[1:23:25] the authority of the spirit of Grace to
[1:23:28] bring Liberty and lead him further I
[1:23:31] want to go on don't you
[1:23:33] I'm gonna go on I believe I found Grace
[1:23:35] but this is the desire of my heart show
[1:23:37] me thy way Lord remember Samuel don't
[1:23:39] you believe he showed you thy way yes
[1:23:41] but he doesn't stop you see it's us
[1:23:43] beholding him the moment you take your
[1:23:46] eyes off of him when we get to feeling
[1:23:48] confident comfortable and somehow along
[1:23:50] the line we'll never say it but it's
[1:23:52] like we get this feeling in our Humanity
[1:23:55] it's something we always will have to
[1:23:58] battle that we can never ever come to a
[1:24:01] place of being self-reliant I'm not just
[1:24:04] telling you that you experience that in
[1:24:07] your own Christian walk with God when
[1:24:09] there's things that you begin to get
[1:24:10] your eyes off on other things and how
[1:24:13] does that happen it can happen with
[1:24:15] somehow with us not even saying anything
[1:24:17] but where we begin to become a little
[1:24:20] bit confident and when we get a little
[1:24:22] confident and a little comfortable we
[1:24:24] stop being as diligent as we ought to be
[1:24:26] oh not me brother Samuel know every
[1:24:29] single one of us we need the grace of
[1:24:32] almighty God that's why that within this
[1:24:35] life Paul never said oh who shall save
[1:24:38] me from this wonderful man he said this
[1:24:40] Wretched Man this Wretched Man
[1:24:45] let me tell you who we pack around with
[1:24:48] us is a Wretched Man a wretched woman
[1:24:53] and we need God show me Lord thy way
[1:24:56] Lord
[1:24:57] Lead Me past the Lord the insecurities
[1:25:00] in my life Lead Me past the complexes
[1:25:03] Lord lead me past Lord God all the
[1:25:06] strains of the family Lord
[1:25:08] show me thy way that I might Know Thee
[1:25:14] you know the longer you're with and
[1:25:15] really with somebody you get to know
[1:25:17] them a whole lot more
[1:25:19] my wife and I by the grace of God here
[1:25:21] on Tuesday we just celebrated our 25th
[1:25:23] anniversary and I'll tell you this right
[1:25:25] here I know her a whole lot more than
[1:25:27] what I did when we first started talking
[1:25:29] [Applause]
[1:25:31] I know it's amazing because I only look
[1:25:32] 17 years old but it's true we've been
[1:25:34] married 25 years
[1:25:36] but she knows me a whole lot more too
[1:25:39] come on as husbands and wives you know
[1:25:41] one another
[1:25:42] what's wrong nothing
[1:25:44] yeah right
[1:25:46] we know one another is that right
[1:25:49] what does that the relationship
[1:25:52] that's the same way it is with God and
[1:25:55] let me just tell you something God ain't
[1:25:57] finding out about brother Joshua he
[1:25:59] already said before your members were
[1:26:01] even were even written there we're even
[1:26:04] manifest in his book and he said I know
[1:26:06] you're going in and you're coming out
[1:26:08] and he said I want to let you know I've
[1:26:10] already preserved it and I made a way
[1:26:12] it ain't God finding out about me he
[1:26:16] already knows me
[1:26:18] he knows my strengths he knows my
[1:26:20] weaknesses and yet despite it all
[1:26:24] it wasn't anything that hindered him
[1:26:26] from choosing you or me because we are a
[1:26:29] part of him God's Got Confidence in that
[1:26:32] word that's packed beneath all the
[1:26:35] mother the dog the buck in our life
[1:26:41] I think if somebody called it the grab
[1:26:43] bag of life
[1:26:45] show me now thy way that I might Know
[1:26:48] Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight
[1:26:50] so showing me thy way that I might find
[1:26:54] Grace I want to find more grace
[1:26:57] I want to find more grace
[1:26:59] is that right but I might find Grace in
[1:27:02] my sight and consider that this nation
[1:27:04] is not people now watch how God responds
[1:27:06] in verse 14 and he said my presence
[1:27:10] paneer my face my person
[1:27:13] shall go with thee
[1:27:17] now God's already told him I'll go with
[1:27:19] you
[1:27:21] but here's the situation that has arose
[1:27:24] in the camp
[1:27:25] and you know God allows situations that
[1:27:27] will cause you and I to call out on him
[1:27:30] come on Friends
[1:27:32] God knows and God permits God shows that
[1:27:36] even in this when what has taken place
[1:27:38] in the camp with Israel's Disobedience
[1:27:40] and you know what happened with the gold
[1:27:41] calf and everything like that but here
[1:27:43] right in this particular place how that
[1:27:45] God would speak to him my presence shall
[1:27:48] go with thee now let me ask you whose
[1:27:50] presence was it he met at the burning
[1:27:52] bush it was God who was it that that
[1:27:54] went down to Egypt with him it was God
[1:27:57] who was it that was there when the rod
[1:28:00] was thrown down it consumed Janice and
[1:28:02] generate it was God on and on we could
[1:28:04] go who was it when Moses himself would
[1:28:07] speak and then speak prophetically to
[1:28:09] the people and say don't fear these
[1:28:12] things and then turn around and show the
[1:28:14] humanity and the weakness of Mortals and
[1:28:17] cry to God and God would pick it up we
[1:28:20] don't read it in the scripture cry but
[1:28:22] God picks it up why cry thou unto me
[1:28:25] what God was reminding Moses is Moses in
[1:28:29] the midst of this trouble and situation
[1:28:31] your forgetting who you are if you can
[1:28:35] remember who you are I the Lord have
[1:28:38] made you who you are and I'm standing
[1:28:41] right here with you there's not an
[1:28:43] obstacle too big too great that the word
[1:28:46] won't bring down and make a way through
[1:28:49] God was encouraging him
[1:28:52] but here he stands and God knows just
[1:28:55] what you and I need to hear
[1:28:57] my presence shall go with thee you know
[1:29:00] it'd be one thing it's like you've heard
[1:29:01] this story brother bam tells it you know
[1:29:03] he heard about uh brother Dan Daisy
[1:29:04] always told the two you know we're
[1:29:07] saying had a man and a woman you know
[1:29:09] and uh the woman hadn't heard her
[1:29:10] husband say to him say to her in a long
[1:29:12] time I love you except for when they
[1:29:14] first got married
[1:29:15] and she asked if she had anything wrong
[1:29:17] nope nothing wrong really you sure nope
[1:29:20] nothing wrong he said well she said well
[1:29:23] you ain't you ain't told me that you
[1:29:25] love me he said if anything ever changes
[1:29:27] I'll let you know
[1:29:30] I'm glad God ain't that way
[1:29:35] I'm glad God ain't that way I'm glad God
[1:29:37] sends cards
[1:29:39] I'm glad I'm glad God brings me flowers
[1:29:42] I'm glad that God wants me to so dwell
[1:29:46] in his love in my life
[1:29:48] well what some of the ways well it
[1:29:49] always sometimes isn't flowers it's just
[1:29:51] him letting me know don't go that way
[1:29:53] don't continue that thought don't keep
[1:29:54] that attitude that's his love to me he's
[1:29:57] letting me know I don't want you to go
[1:29:59] that way that's his love to me that's
[1:30:01] just as good as a bouquet of flowers
[1:30:03] that's just as good as something that
[1:30:05] sweeps down that's a blessing because
[1:30:07] from my heart I want to continue in the
[1:30:10] grace of God
[1:30:12] oh Hallelujah my presence shall go with
[1:30:15] thee and I will give thee rest my mama
[1:30:18] verse 15. now here's what Moses said If
[1:30:22] thy presence go not with me
[1:30:25] carry us not up hence
[1:30:27] boy that'd be a good thing to put on the
[1:30:29] refrigerator and everything else before
[1:30:31] any decision is made Lord if your
[1:30:33] presence ain't going with us on this
[1:30:34] right here remember his presence will
[1:30:36] always accompany his word if your
[1:30:38] presence ain't going I don't go
[1:30:40] now Moses could sit there and argue you
[1:30:43] know he could have said but this is your
[1:30:44] word God we're supposed to go we're
[1:30:46] supposed to do this but there's always a
[1:30:48] correct way God's presence is always
[1:30:50] there to confirm the word confirm the
[1:30:53] season and confirm that this is the
[1:30:55] people of the promise remember when
[1:30:57] Ramos Gilead was promised to the
[1:30:59] children of Israel and you find that in
[1:31:01] the days of Ahab that here Ahab wanted
[1:31:04] to go up and take Ramos Gilead he asked
[1:31:06] for Jehoshaphat to come and when
[1:31:08] Jehoshaphat came Jehoshaphat can only
[1:31:10] agree with the word in the fact that
[1:31:13] Ramos Gilead did indeed belong to the
[1:31:15] children of Israel but you see it was
[1:31:18] not just an Israelite obtaining a
[1:31:20] promise but it must be according to the
[1:31:22] word and the word itself is more than
[1:31:25] just a letter but it must be the person
[1:31:28] or the nature that is according to the
[1:31:31] person of almighty God what was it
[1:31:34] ahab's life his character was not a fit
[1:31:38] character to take what the promise us
[1:31:41] that God had given to him
[1:31:44] well what would it have taken humility
[1:31:47] obedience
[1:31:49] is that right
[1:31:50] that's that's the coming of the Rapture
[1:31:52] the bride will take the Rapture by the
[1:31:54] word
[1:31:55] is that right oh my my mama If thy
[1:31:59] presence go not with me carry us up not
[1:32:01] fence for wherewith oh I like this for
[1:32:04] worrying shall it be known here that I
[1:32:06] and thy people have found Grace in thy
[1:32:09] sight is it not in that thou goest with
[1:32:13] us now I want you to watch this
[1:32:15] showing that we have found Grace in thy
[1:32:19] sight
[1:32:20] how how is this going to be known that
[1:32:23] we have your favor
[1:32:25] is it not in that thou goest with us
[1:32:30] so shall we be separated I and thy
[1:32:34] people from all the people that are upon
[1:32:37] the face of the Earth
[1:32:40] so what is it that brings the
[1:32:43] distinction or the separation is the
[1:32:46] grace of God going with the people of
[1:32:50] God
[1:32:51] it's advancing in God's grace so Grace
[1:32:54] is not just something that as the church
[1:32:57] World wants to paint it as indeed Grace
[1:33:00] is a forgiveness of sin but remember how
[1:33:03] will we know that your grace we have
[1:33:05] obtained Grace and thy sight is it not
[1:33:09] in that thou goest with us thy presence
[1:33:12] is Among Us in what in the Fulfillment
[1:33:16] of your word understand now not talking
[1:33:19] about just a feeling or an anointing
[1:33:22] where people can run and jump and and
[1:33:24] all of those things like that we believe
[1:33:26] in Emotion I I believe in that but you
[1:33:28] understand it's something that's deeper
[1:33:30] than just speaking in tongues or some
[1:33:33] some sort of evidence out here it's a
[1:33:36] life and an Evidence that's lined up
[1:33:38] with the word of almighty God if it's
[1:33:40] not taking the people on into the grace
[1:33:43] and the promises of God it's not a move
[1:33:46] of God
[1:33:48] because a move of God is the spirit of
[1:33:51] Grace advancing the people on
[1:33:55] think about it God's grace is not going
[1:33:57] to keep us here forever we're at the end
[1:34:00] time
[1:34:01] the grace of God is moving us into a
[1:34:03] place of in my father's house are many
[1:34:06] mansions
[1:34:07] God's grace is there's an ushering in of
[1:34:11] the rapture
[1:34:13] oh my and the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:34:16] will do this thing also that thou has
[1:34:18] spoken for thou has found Grace in my
[1:34:20] sight and I Know Thee by name
[1:34:25] now
[1:34:27] let me move on the spirit of Grace here
[1:34:29] just for a moment
[1:34:33] in Zechariah Chapter 12 verse 9
[1:34:37] . so this Spirit of Grace is more that
[1:34:39] we could read with that event of Moses
[1:34:42] where God reveals himself
[1:34:45] and what he is and his faithfulness
[1:34:48] but I want you to notice the next place
[1:34:51] in the scripture where it is mentioned
[1:34:53] the spirit of Grace
[1:34:56] because the spirit of Grace is the
[1:34:59] advancement into the promises of God
[1:35:02] for our lives
[1:35:06] let me just tell you justification is a
[1:35:08] promise
[1:35:09] sanctification is a promise the baptism
[1:35:12] of the Holy Ghost is a promise and
[1:35:15] there's more promises to take
[1:35:20] are you with me
[1:35:27] Zechariah 12 and verse 9.
[1:35:30] and you say what more promises could it
[1:35:32] be it's God wanting to sow mold
[1:35:35] our character
[1:35:37] to match his character
[1:35:41] it's true the token is the necessity for
[1:35:45] the rapture
[1:35:48] it's very true but let me tell you what
[1:35:51] the token does the token doesn't bring
[1:35:53] complacency
[1:35:57] because it's rapturing Grace
[1:36:00] now that same grace of God comes to
[1:36:04] minister to you and I if we have become
[1:36:07] complacent
[1:36:09] if we have to encourage Us in the things
[1:36:13] of God
[1:36:15] are you with me I can't get into all
[1:36:17] this today but the great the spirit of
[1:36:19] Grace comes to you and I to minister to
[1:36:22] our lives in that way
[1:36:25] but we don't ever want to have the
[1:36:27] thought of well I've already made it I
[1:36:30] know there's quotes and I believe that
[1:36:32] those quotes holding in the scripture
[1:36:33] where they need to hold but when you
[1:36:35] recognize you already made it you're
[1:36:37] like David going to the battle against
[1:36:39] Goliath
[1:36:40] brother Brahm said he went dancing down
[1:36:42] there
[1:36:45] he was full of joy you know why he
[1:36:48] already knew the battles won
[1:36:52] see this is why the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:36:55] just we get this and then now I go worry
[1:36:57] about all of life no no no we're not
[1:36:59] here for this life
[1:37:02] we're not here for this life
[1:37:04] we're here for him
[1:37:07] and when his purpose is fulfilled
[1:37:11] then we're gone
[1:37:13] it's not according to what we think
[1:37:15] about life
[1:37:17] are you with me sometimes in life we get
[1:37:20] to thinking that a full life is well
[1:37:22] when a full life you know I graduate
[1:37:24] from college and I get a job and however
[1:37:26] you want to place this and I obtain us I
[1:37:28] obtain a uh you know a career and I have
[1:37:30] to know house and I obtain of this and I
[1:37:32] have married and I have life and I have
[1:37:34] grandchildren but who said that's
[1:37:36] complete
[1:37:37] who said that's the purpose
[1:37:39] there are purposes in there but remember
[1:37:42] we are not promised the longevity of
[1:37:45] that because it's not about us serving
[1:37:48] our purpose or our wants it's about us
[1:37:52] serving his purpose
[1:37:55] [Applause]
[1:37:57] oh friends if you can see that this
[1:37:59] morning it'll cause you to turn loose of
[1:38:01] whatever is holding you back
[1:38:03] whatever's keeping you back from any
[1:38:05] promise it'll cause you to turn Lucifer
[1:38:07] to realize it ain't about well when I
[1:38:09] get this straightened out and I'm gonna
[1:38:10] get this straight now it ain't about
[1:38:11] waiting it's let God do something right
[1:38:15] now for you
[1:38:19] Zechariah 12 verse 9. and it shall come
[1:38:22] to pass in that day
[1:38:23] that I will seek to destroy all the
[1:38:26] nations that come against Jerusalem and
[1:38:28] I will pour upon the House of David and
[1:38:30] upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the
[1:38:33] spirit of Grace
[1:38:35] and of supplications
[1:38:37] and they shall look upon me whom they
[1:38:39] have pierced and they shall mourn for
[1:38:41] him as one mourneth for his only son and
[1:38:44] shall be in bitterness for him as one
[1:38:46] that is in bitterness for his firstborn
[1:38:50] here is Israel
[1:38:52] a people
[1:38:54] they were blinded for our sake
[1:39:00] they were blinded
[1:39:03] in their blindness they rejected the
[1:39:06] Messiah
[1:39:09] but God had a promise
[1:39:13] all the way back
[1:39:15] all the way through
[1:39:18] and in the midst of it through their
[1:39:20] blinding we have received sight as the
[1:39:25] Gentiles
[1:39:26] the supper that they were called to you
[1:39:29] remember the parable the supper that
[1:39:31] they were called to to be a partaker of
[1:39:34] the feast that the Lord had made what
[1:39:37] Feast was that it was the baptism of the
[1:39:40] Holy Ghost it was the outpouring of the
[1:39:43] life of the atonement
[1:39:45] but they begin to make excuses of why
[1:39:48] they couldn't do it
[1:39:50] and then the in that Parable it goes out
[1:39:52] and says
[1:39:54] then none of these shall eat at my table
[1:39:56] but go out into the highways and the
[1:39:59] hedges and so forth and compel them
[1:40:03] because my house shall not be empty
[1:40:06] now let me tell you this right here
[1:40:08] God's Grace has reached down through the
[1:40:11] Gentiles and God has called out a group
[1:40:14] of people for his namesake he has taken
[1:40:18] lives down through time that they him
[1:40:21] themselves even had to continue to bathe
[1:40:25] in the grace of God after they had
[1:40:28] received it and after the grace had
[1:40:30] changed their lives Paul could speak to
[1:40:33] him in the book of Corinthians and them
[1:40:35] still remembering the vile condition
[1:40:38] that they were in but the grace of God
[1:40:41] would mention to them this is what you
[1:40:44] were at one time
[1:40:47] but you have been Justified you have
[1:40:50] been washed by the blood of the lamb and
[1:40:54] by his Spirit you are standing Justified
[1:40:58] what was it God's grace to lift them
[1:41:01] into that position
[1:41:04] and all the way down through the
[1:41:06] Gentiles even in the age that you and I
[1:41:09] are living in with such confusion when
[1:41:12] things are all around and and tradition
[1:41:15] and everything is at its height with
[1:41:17] with all kinds of Creeds and dogmas and
[1:41:20] and this is the way and this is the way
[1:41:22] and this is the way and this is the way
[1:41:23] and this is the wing and this is the way
[1:41:25] and you're looking at all around but God
[1:41:28] in his grace makes known his way for you
[1:41:33] and I let me tell you if not for the
[1:41:35] grace of God we wouldn't be able to find
[1:41:37] our way out of a paper bag
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:40] if not for God's grace we wouldn't even
[1:41:43] know how to cross the fence but God in
[1:41:46] his grace and let me tell you how simple
[1:41:48] God made it God took a little look God
[1:41:51] took a man that wasn't very tall at all
[1:41:54] in stature wasn't very tall among the
[1:41:56] theologians either didn't even have a
[1:41:58] seventh grade education but God took a
[1:42:01] vessel that was willing to surrender and
[1:42:03] submit his heart to God and God brought
[1:42:06] forth a message of grace to you and I
[1:42:08] when you and I couldn't find our way but
[1:42:11] God in his grace he shined his life upon
[1:42:14] our pathway it wasn't you looking for
[1:42:17] God it was God came looking for you
[1:42:22] think about it
[1:42:24] when this is poured out upon Israel it
[1:42:28] is not Israel that has got themselves in
[1:42:30] position to receive the Messiah but
[1:42:33] there's been some hard trials the tender
[1:42:35] hand of Jehovah
[1:42:38] he said I'll cast held in the north give
[1:42:41] up my sons I'll tell the South give up
[1:42:43] my daughters I'll tell the West I'll
[1:42:45] tell these give up my sons and my
[1:42:48] daughters I
[1:42:49] bring you back home
[1:42:53] because the promise is when you get back
[1:42:56] in your land that's where the Messiah is
[1:42:58] going to come
[1:43:00] that's why when that Rabbi when they
[1:43:03] were afraid to get on that plane they
[1:43:05] were looking at that scripture and that
[1:43:07] Rabbi Anointed with the spirit of God
[1:43:10] here he goes back into the scripture of
[1:43:12] Isaiah and he says it says they shall go
[1:43:16] back on the wings of an eagle
[1:43:18] was able to understand in the airplane
[1:43:21] it wasn't so much the airplane it was
[1:43:23] God it was gone identifying this is the
[1:43:26] Fulfillment of Prophecy it wasn't an
[1:43:29] airplane taking them back it was God
[1:43:31] fulfilling his word
[1:43:33] [Applause]
[1:43:34] and let me tell you before you ever you
[1:43:37] and I ever got to a place before you
[1:43:39] ever may be darkened these doors God had
[1:43:42] to deal with your heart
[1:43:45] and let me tell you though you couldn't
[1:43:47] hear his voice maybe to like it's like
[1:43:49] my voice coming across this speaker but
[1:43:51] I want you to remember that those
[1:43:53] trumpets sound out to call Israel back
[1:43:56] home and the prophet said he's already
[1:43:58] supernaturally preached those in the
[1:44:01] revealing under that Sixth Seal
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:05] let me tell you this message has sounded
[1:44:09] out
[1:44:10] it's the faith of God placed upon this
[1:44:14] generation
[1:44:16] the spirit of Grace that's been poured
[1:44:19] out
[1:44:20] not poured out in a vial but poured out
[1:44:24] through the shofar poured out through
[1:44:26] the Ram's Horn porn now in Jubilee
[1:44:29] pouring out and come back to your
[1:44:31] possession it's the spirit of Grace that
[1:44:34] is anointing you David with the word of
[1:44:37] almighty God
[1:44:40] yeah
[1:44:42] which is small in stature thou which is
[1:44:46] little oh God let us always be little in
[1:44:48] our own lives
[1:44:51] foreign
[1:44:53] this message has sounded out
[1:45:00] it's brought you to where you're at
[1:45:03] despite all your doubts despite every
[1:45:07] trap in every web and everything of
[1:45:10] unbelief that the enemies wanted to wow
[1:45:13] and bring around in your life brother
[1:45:15] Samuel is their hope for me if there's
[1:45:17] something in your heart that is crying
[1:45:19] out for the Living God there is hope
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:27] what do I do listen to this hand listen
[1:45:30] to that voice
[1:45:32] because just as Israel getting into this
[1:45:35] place God bringing them into this
[1:45:37] position back into Palestine I don't
[1:45:40] mean to labor on this but it's just as
[1:45:41] it's coming I don't have this road down
[1:45:43] but just it's coming you realize they
[1:45:46] went back into a land where a language
[1:45:47] had died
[1:45:51] it died
[1:45:53] they call those who went there Zionist
[1:45:58] where has there ever been a language
[1:46:00] died that that language came back
[1:46:04] well brother Samuel that's for the Jews
[1:46:06] I'm talking about a language that's
[1:46:07] deeper than the Jews I'm talking about
[1:46:09] the language of the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:46:12] talking about the language of the word
[1:46:13] we're at churches and dogmas and isms
[1:46:16] and seminaries have wanted to change the
[1:46:19] language of the word but God
[1:46:23] there's been scientists that have been
[1:46:26] anointed by the spirit of almighty God
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:31] we're standing where we're standing
[1:46:34] because of God's grace
[1:46:36] and let me just say it like this here I
[1:46:38] am as a young boy and yes as a young boy
[1:46:40] but I thank God for the veterans that's
[1:46:43] went ahead of us
[1:46:46] maybe veterans didn't see this or see
[1:46:48] that but they stood faithful for what
[1:46:50] they did see
[1:46:51] and they made a way that where we're
[1:46:53] standing right now
[1:46:55] it took some zionists to stand there and
[1:46:58] say you ain't taking away this right
[1:47:00] you're not taking away the holy ghost
[1:47:02] from the church you're not reducing it
[1:47:05] to a Creed you're not reducing it to a
[1:47:07] beliefism you're not going to take this
[1:47:09] away
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:14] and God has got some people in this hour
[1:47:18] yeah 11th Hour workers
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:23] lives that have received the indwelling
[1:47:26] of God's grace
[1:47:29] and they are the Lamb's protection upon
[1:47:32] this Earth
[1:47:33] what is it witnesses that God still
[1:47:36] delivers
[1:47:38] that the Holy Ghost is still real that
[1:47:42] God still heals the sick
[1:47:44] that God still delivers the oppressed
[1:47:47] God still loosens lives from the grip of
[1:47:51] cancer
[1:47:54] Hallelujah
[1:47:55] [Music]
[1:47:57] what has brought us to this the spirit
[1:48:00] of Grace poured out
[1:48:04] poured out upon us
[1:48:06] poured out upon us
[1:48:09] and they are in their place
[1:48:11] when that 144 000 receives their
[1:48:13] visitation
[1:48:15] They will receive the two witnesses that
[1:48:17] will preach this same message
[1:48:20] this message of the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:23] Ghost
[1:48:25] and he will make himself known to them
[1:48:28] you know what he will do he will come
[1:48:30] and amen the message
[1:48:33] just as he's right here amending the
[1:48:36] message
[1:48:36] [Applause]
[1:48:38] they will experience power signs wonders
[1:48:41] Miracles right there with the preaching
[1:48:44] of those two witnesses
[1:48:46] and you know what it does it causes them
[1:48:48] here they are looking for him and He
[1:48:50] makes himself known to them he
[1:48:52] vindicates according to his word
[1:48:55] how much more
[1:48:57] God bringing you and I
[1:49:00] into the place
[1:49:02] for rapture
[1:49:05] if they have to be there
[1:49:07] to receive their visitation
[1:49:11] and it wasn't all
[1:49:13] picnic baskets to get there
[1:49:16] there's many
[1:49:18] that died in concentration camps
[1:49:27] is this okay
[1:49:30] but they'll receive
[1:49:31] their white robes under that fifth seal
[1:49:35] and brother Branham said just as Joseph
[1:49:36] stepped forward to reveal himself to his
[1:49:39] brethren
[1:49:40] he says when he steps forward and like
[1:49:42] that altar he says to reveal himself to
[1:49:45] his brother and here they underneath the
[1:49:48] altar will catch that Revelation he's
[1:49:50] the Messiah
[1:49:52] what are you saying I'm saying there's
[1:49:54] things going on in both dimensions
[1:49:56] [Applause]
[1:49:58] is being reflected on Earth
[1:50:03] it's the spirit of Grace
[1:50:06] to not only to recognize Where We Are
[1:50:09] Who We Are
[1:50:11] and who were in the presence of
[1:50:15] let me just say it this way
[1:50:18] it's imperative it's important that you
[1:50:21] move with the grace of God
[1:50:24] because without moving with God's grace
[1:50:28] it moves on
[1:50:30] without you
[1:50:32] and you can't say that you've received
[1:50:34] it because Grace is not something
[1:50:37] that's just here that allows us that you
[1:50:39] can just go on and continue that's not
[1:50:41] what Grace it shouldn't that's not
[1:50:44] that's not the true
[1:50:46] expression of Grace but what Grace
[1:50:48] should do to your life is to realize
[1:50:49] Lord
[1:50:51] you're my way maker
[1:50:54] when God Reveals His grace more to you
[1:50:56] and me
[1:50:57] it don't make me want to live loose
[1:51:01] I want to be more fervent
[1:51:03] I want to serve him more I want to I
[1:51:06] want to be pleasing to him
[1:51:09] I don't want to just look at well this
[1:51:10] is okay good my God must be okay with
[1:51:12] this one thank God for his good no no
[1:51:15] but it's to receive that Grace because
[1:51:16] you see if we re as you receive that
[1:51:18] Grace in your life
[1:51:20] there's more grace for you to walk in
[1:51:24] I want to walk in this advancement
[1:51:26] of the spirit of Grace I don't believe
[1:51:29] at all I'm speaking to people who
[1:51:31] despise the grace of God
[1:51:33] listen that's an awful big Broad and
[1:51:35] deep statement I don't believe that I
[1:51:36] believe that I believe that God has sent
[1:51:38] me to speak to people who care
[1:51:41] and I believe I'm looking at people who
[1:51:43] care I believe I'm looking and preaching
[1:51:45] to people who say you know what I want
[1:51:47] to experience more of God's grace
[1:51:50] there's more ground to be taken there's
[1:51:52] more cities to be taken
[1:51:53] I want to experience more of God's grace
[1:51:56] how do how do I do that well as God
[1:51:59] deals with you whatever it is that God
[1:52:01] deals with you on move upon that don't
[1:52:04] say well I'll wait till I get this no if
[1:52:07] there would be something in the way I'd
[1:52:08] put that aside from the way and say God
[1:52:10] give me the grace that I need I want to
[1:52:12] go on with you
[1:52:14] remember you have the authority to make
[1:52:17] the decision
[1:52:19] you have that Authority and that
[1:52:21] decision it welcomes God to move you
[1:52:23] realize God never made the decision for
[1:52:26] the spies
[1:52:27] they made it
[1:52:29] but Caleb and them also made a decision
[1:52:32] and you know what their decision was
[1:52:33] based on the word
[1:52:36] they had watched God walk or work all
[1:52:39] along and they knew
[1:52:41] this is God letting us know he's with us
[1:52:45] and see you know what I'm going to take
[1:52:47] what he's saying
[1:52:49] beyond what you're saying beyond what my
[1:52:52] feelings say or even what my eyes see
[1:52:55] I'm gonna take What God Says
[1:53:01] you love him
[1:53:04] oh let's walk with the spirit of Grace
[1:53:07] let's walk with the spirit of Grace
[1:53:11] step by step
[1:53:13] and you know what
[1:53:14] he's bringing us into position
[1:53:17] he's bringing us into position
[1:53:20] he's the one assembling his body
[1:53:23] together
[1:53:25] Stone by Stone
[1:53:27] piece by piece
[1:53:29] Heart By Heart Life by life
[1:53:32] he's assembling Us by his grace
[1:53:37] and I say Lord
[1:53:40] if you're not going up I don't want to
[1:53:43] go
[1:53:44] but I want to go
[1:53:46] where you're going
[1:53:47] where you're leading you're showing me
[1:53:50] your way your character let my character
[1:53:53] be molded to match there
[1:53:57] that's sonship
[1:53:58] you love him
[1:54:00] let's pray
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:03] Lord Jesus

[1:54:34] I know that you you know every one of
[1:54:38] our needs you know exactly where
[1:54:40] everyone is at
[1:54:42] but I pray Lord
[1:54:43] there's one thing as we look in your
[1:54:45] word
[1:54:46] it makes a difference in our lives
[1:54:49] and that's the grace of God
[1:54:52] and Lord Jesus like Moses
[1:54:55] we're asking
[1:54:56] oh God

[1:55:16] God
[1:55:17] May there be lorda a heart that's there
[1:55:20] that is Lord willing to lay aside Lord
[1:55:25] our own will
[1:55:27] and to accept your will Lord
[1:55:29] I pray Lord Jesus may you grant it Lord
[1:55:33] here this morning
[1:55:34] The Same Spirit of Grace that Lord

[1:55:47] Lord to lead us into the fullness that
[1:55:51] you've called us to Lord you're here to
[1:55:53] do for us this morning maybe it's a
[1:55:56] sickness Lord that's standing before one
[1:55:59] of your children
[1:56:01] maybe Lord It's
[1:56:03] something they're going through in their
[1:56:05] Spirit Lord
[1:56:07] emotionally maybe in their body
[1:56:11] Lord we ask that may that same Spirit of
[1:56:14] Grace
[1:56:15] move down lord for their need right now
[1:56:18] Lord for that harder that life that Lord
[1:56:22] has not really surrendered to you
[1:56:24] maybe they believe the message and
[1:56:26] that's that's good
[1:56:28] but Lord may they take of that of the
[1:56:31] spirit of Grace

[1:56:58] and I know Lord that
[1:57:02] in order for more to be shown to us
[1:57:06] it's the requirement that we walk in the
[1:57:08] grace that's already
[1:57:10] been shown
[1:57:12] or as we walk in the light as he's in
[1:57:14] the light

[2:15:47] don't even let failures or the fear of
[2:15:49] failure don't don't let that stand in a
[2:15:52] way that's that's a spirit that's trying
[2:15:54] to hinder you
[2:15:55] but take the spirit of Grace
[2:15:59] it's calming you on
[2:16:02] no matter how many times you try
[2:16:06] you're trying it's not in vain
[2:16:10] but if you just look to him
[2:16:12] Look to Him
[2:16:14] Look Away to Jesus
[2:16:17] he's the one who's in our midst through
[2:16:19] all of the preaching through every part
[2:16:22] of this of the service
[2:16:23] when everything is said and done
[2:16:25] it's him
[2:16:27] when the prayer of benediction has been
[2:16:29] prayed
[2:16:31] and we depart from the prince of one
[2:16:33] another in this place
[2:16:34] what matters
[2:16:36] is that we have recognized his presence
[2:16:41] we not remain not remember every
[2:16:44] scripture every quote that's not what
[2:16:46] it's about
[2:16:47] God is unfolding himself
[2:16:50] by his word in his word to let you know
[2:16:55] he cares about you
[2:16:57] and he is here to do for you
[2:17:02] let me tell you it's God's grace that
[2:17:03] deals with the heart
[2:17:05] to bring us here
[2:17:08] is that right it's God's grace that
[2:17:10] deals with our lives even before the
[2:17:13] service began this morning it's God's
[2:17:15] grace that has dealt with our hearts
[2:17:17] like he dealt with Rebecca's heart
[2:17:19] before elieza ever got there
[2:17:22] it's the grace of God
[2:17:24] [Music]
[2:17:25] and it's God's grace you don't realize
[2:17:27] that brother Ben tells us he said it's
[2:17:29] the angels of God as it comes up in just
[2:17:31] A little nudge
[2:17:34] you should go forward
[2:17:36] you should act upon this
[2:17:38] it's the angels of God
[2:17:40] brother Samuel where are we we're on
[2:17:42] Mount Zion
[2:17:44] and there's an innumerable
[2:17:46] campman of angels all around
[2:17:49] the presence of God
[2:17:51] to do for you and I
[2:17:54] all that we have need of
[2:17:58] nah I don't have no need to stand up
[2:18:01] here and ask him for a motorcycle
[2:18:02] because that's not what's inspired to my
[2:18:04] heart right now
[2:18:06] and plus I don't have a need for it
[2:18:09] but what he inspires to my heart is what
[2:18:12] I have need of
[2:18:14] and the same God
[2:18:16] that asked the prophet that day how many
[2:18:19] squirrels do you need
[2:18:23] do you need
[2:18:26] and he told him how many he needed
[2:18:31] and he spoke
[2:18:34] even out of situations where no squirrel
[2:18:37] would come
[2:18:40] you know what that was that wasn't so
[2:18:43] that we would have a story of squirrels
[2:18:45] being created it was God letting you and
[2:18:47] I know that his word
[2:18:50] brings forth Sons and Daughters of God
[2:18:53] out of situations that looks like no way
[2:18:58] can a son or daughter of God be down
[2:19:01] beneath that
[2:19:03] is what God was letting us know in this
[2:19:05] generation that the word
[2:19:08] the spirit of Grace
[2:19:10] comes to bring you and I out it's God
[2:19:13] listen to me it's god making that
[2:19:16] Creation in your heart
[2:19:22] that's not my words that's the words of
[2:19:24] God spoken through a prophet
[2:19:27] God fulfilling his word and that's
[2:19:28] what's making that Creation in your
[2:19:30] heart
[2:19:32] it's God it's the Creator and that same
[2:19:34] creator that is working to bring that
[2:19:37] creation for you to even believe and say
[2:19:40] Yes Lord I I believe that same God
[2:19:43] is present
[2:19:45] to create a new creation
[2:19:49] the same God that creates faith
[2:19:52] the same God that creates cells
[2:19:56] that were
[2:19:57] taken by cancer
[2:20:00] the same God who creates
[2:20:03] broken where Brokenness is and brings
[2:20:06] restoration
[2:20:07] he is the same creator
[2:20:10] but must I do move upon the creation
[2:20:15] as he's working in that Creation in your
[2:20:17] heart it's God creating that faith
[2:20:20] it's God creating faith
[2:20:22] that's the grace of God
[2:20:25] that's God's grace
[2:20:29] Hallelujah amen God bless you
