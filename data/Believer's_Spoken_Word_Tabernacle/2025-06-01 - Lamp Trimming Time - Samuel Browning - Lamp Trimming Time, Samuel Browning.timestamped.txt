[35:03] Bless you. So glad I feel his love for
[35:08] me. Jesus paid the price of
[35:13] redemption on the cross of Calary.
[35:19] Every day I will praise him for I know
[35:25] I'll never be the
[35:28] same. All to do is love him for his
[35:38] glory. So every day my heart praise him.
[35:45] No I'll never be the same.
[35:50] All I want to do is love him.
[35:54] [Music]
[35:59] Hallelujah.
[36:01] Hallelujah.
[36:03] Amen. If that's truly from our hearts,
[36:05] what a blessed people. Amen. Our desire
[36:08] is to walk in the light as he's in the
[36:10] light and to please him. Amen. There's
[36:13] no greater no greater joy, no greater
[36:15] desire. And one of these moments ah we
[36:20] we'll receive a body that'll match
[36:21] what's on the inside. Yes, sir. Amen.
[36:24] What God has done on the inside of our
[36:25] life. And to think about it, we'll we'll
[36:28] come into a place not only into a body,
[36:30] but then into the place where he has
[36:32] prepared and coming into that place, the
[36:34] wedding supper, the millennium. Oh my.
[36:37] And my goodness. And then from there
[36:39] into the future home. Hallelujah. What
[36:41] great promises await us. Amen. This is
[36:45] why that that everything within us is
[36:48] pressed towards the mark pre because
[36:51] it's it's worth it's worth more than
[36:55] anything
[36:56] in this life our soul and being in God's
[37:00] presence. And you know the good thing
[37:02] about it is when as that change comes
[37:05] over
[37:08] you you you'll not be you'll no longer
[37:10] be worrying about what you do on your
[37:11] daily
[37:12] routine. It'll be gone just like that.
[37:16] Be gone.
[37:18] You know, you might be on your way to do
[37:20] the dishes or get them out of the out of
[37:21] the the dishwasher. You might be on your
[37:24] way, you know, on the way going to work.
[37:25] How God has all that set. You know,
[37:28] there's not going to be planes wrecking
[37:29] and cars crashing. It's a secret going
[37:32] away. Yes, sir. Oh my. Has God has
[37:36] everything so arranged and so prepared.
[37:39] Oh my. And I'll tell you, we're not
[37:41] going to look back with dread. Oh, I
[37:43] wish I could have just worked a little
[37:44] bit more. I ah my I could have Oh man,
[37:47] if I'd have had this, I had no all of
[37:49] those things will fade away. You know
[37:51] what's tremendous is it's fading away
[37:53] even now. The more as we come into his
[37:56] presence, it's more of losing sight of
[37:59] ourselves and the real blessing and
[38:01] reality of what it means to be united
[38:04] with him. Don't you love him?
[38:07] Amen. Hallelujah. I'm so glad this
[38:10] message has provided us a place and that
[38:13] place is in him because that's who this
[38:16] message is all about. Amen. It's about
[38:19] Jesus Christ and his grace. Amen. So
[38:21] good to be together, isn't it? Amen. God
[38:23] has given us a a beautiful day, a little
[38:26] chilly, and I hopefully things will kind
[38:27] of balance out with the weather here
[38:29] eventually, but uh my it's just I'm glad
[38:33] that we're heading towards warmer
[38:35] days. Amen. So, we just thank God for
[38:38] his mercy. Amen. And so, we want to uh
[38:43] invite you into the word here this
[38:45] morning. And brother Brian had mentioned
[38:47] there uh with um not only Silas had
[38:52] graduated yesterday, but then Jonathan
[38:55] as well has graduated. And so these two
[38:59] young men, well, they're already set
[39:01] enrolled in the programs they're going
[39:03] into in college. And so we're just so
[39:06] proud of them. Amen. That the journey
[39:09] that they've come through. And um you
[39:12] know I thought when I sat there
[39:13] yesterday and um you know we've come
[39:16] through two already ourselves and you
[39:19] know you realize that uh the parents
[39:22] really deserve a a real pat on the back
[39:24] for all of the come on don't hit the
[39:26] stew button one more time. Come on. You
[39:29] know and uh but really within all of
[39:32] those things I tell you it's it's worth
[39:34] it. It's worth it isn't it?
[39:37] Amen. Well, some of you about part of
[39:40] you said amen. Two or three. You are in
[39:43] a in a big fix right now if your parents
[39:45] aren't saying amen to that. But uh it's
[39:48] just good to be together. Amen. Let's um
[39:52] let's turn to Matthew
[39:54] 25. Just have a little something on our
[39:57] hearts that um want to speak and hear
[40:00] this
[40:01] morning. And uh oh, we have it there
[40:04] already. and um just see how the Lord
[40:08] will will take us uh within this portion
[40:13] of the
[40:15] scripture.
[40:17] Amen. Let's just if you don't mind, I'd
[40:21] like to pray before I begin reading this
[40:23] here. So, if you want to put your finger
[40:25] there. Heavenly
[40:27] Father, Lord, how we thank you for this
[40:30] privilege and the opportunity that we
[40:32] have to be able to come together. Lord,
[40:35] I thank you father that God that as we
[40:39] are gathered together.
[40:42] Brother Brian mentioned something Lord
[40:44] when singing and such as Lord that it
[40:48] was a a morning that oh God he was heart
[40:51] was just Lord just always just just a
[40:54] bubbling over and feel like worshiping
[40:56] and and there's times Lord when we don't
[40:59] there's times Lord that Father when we
[41:02] are weary or tired or pressures of life
[41:06] but that's when it's a sacrifice Lord
[41:09] and Father it's as you wrote in your
[41:11] word that it's with such
[41:13] sacrifices that you're well pleased. So
[41:16] I pray that God, no matter this morning,
[41:20] if we're in a place where it's just
[41:23] coming out awful easy or we're in a
[41:26] place, Lord, to where that my it's a
[41:29] sacrifice. Oh God, let us Lord realize
[41:33] that Father, it's you that looks on the
[41:35] heart. And father with the things that
[41:38] goes beyond our feelings when we
[41:41] sacrifice Lord in the raising of our
[41:43] hands and Lord the singing Lord of our
[41:46] voice and to be in the house of God to
[41:49] press beyond Lord our feelings and all
[41:52] the thoughts and suggestions of mine
[41:54] just to get into your presence Lord for
[41:57] Lord it's in your presence and Father
[42:01] what a blessing it is to be able to
[42:03] gather together with brothers and
[42:05] sisters ers of like precious faith Lord
[42:08] there's a current of the Holy Spirit
[42:10] that moves Lord that quickening power
[42:13] that flows through the body that Lord
[42:15] Jesus where as your prophet told us when
[42:18] more of believers are come together it's
[42:22] an assembling of more of the Godhead
[42:25] among us so Lord Jesus we believe Lord
[42:28] yielding our lick of fire oh God beyond
[42:31] every every circumstance of life we want
[42:34] to yield Lord, right here in this
[42:37] moment. And I pray that God that even as
[42:39] sister Maria's testified, Lord, a 50%
[42:43] Lord, oh God, like your prophet said,
[42:46] wiggle the finger, the end of it, then
[42:48] you can wiggle the whole finger. Lord,
[42:50] we're believing, Father, not only for
[42:52] Sister Maria, a complete healing, oh
[42:55] God, that even as the word is going
[42:56] forth, for you've set your word to heal
[42:59] your people, but Lord, we're believing
[43:01] God for healing of soul, spirit, and
[43:04] body, Lord, among your children this
[43:06] morning, Lord. I pray that God, that you
[43:09] would just hide us behind the cross of
[43:11] Calvary, Lord. And may you be lifted up,
[43:14] Lord. May you be lifted higher than
[43:16] every question, every problem, every
[43:18] circumstance, Lord. And may we Lord be
[43:21] as standing there on Mount
[43:23] Transfiguration see you only Lord. Oh
[43:26] granted Lord we pray this morning. We
[43:29] give ourselves to you Lord and ask that
[43:31] you'll just now take us in the further
[43:34] part of this service Lord and may you
[43:36] Lord bring forth the achievement that
[43:39] you have purposed. We pray in Jesus
[43:41] name. Amen. Amen. Matthew
[43:46] 25 and verse one, the scripture says,
[43:50] "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[43:53] likened unto 10 virgins which took their
[43:57] lamps and went forth to meet the
[44:00] bridegroom. And five of them were wise,
[44:03] and five were foolish. They that were
[44:06] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[44:09] with them. But the wise took oil in
[44:13] their vessels with their lamps. And
[44:16] while the bridegroom tried, they all
[44:19] slumbered and
[44:20] slept. And at midnight there was a cry
[44:23] made, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go
[44:27] ye out to meet him." Amen. Then all
[44:30] those virgins arose and trimmed their
[44:32] lamps. And the foolish said unto the
[44:35] wise, "Give us of your oil, for our
[44:39] lamps are gone out." Now, I want you to
[44:41] notice that. Their lamps were burning.
[44:46] But they went out.
[44:49] But the wise answered and said, "Not so,
[44:53] lest there be not enough for us and you.
[44:58] But go you rather to them that sell and
[45:02] buy for yourselves. Now I want you to
[45:04] notice how this verse is written. It's
[45:06] an evidence right here to where that
[45:10] they the wise was able to speak to the
[45:13] foolish and tell them what to do. They
[45:15] knew where the place was at. The wise
[45:17] knew where the place was at. They also
[45:19] knew both wise and foolish what was
[45:22] required in order to receive oil. Now
[45:26] it's true. The oil is without money or
[45:28] price, but the cost of it is our own
[45:31] will, our own life. That's right. And
[45:34] so, notice this. It wasn't just that the
[45:36] foolish were just standing there like,
[45:38] "Oh, I I was unaware of this." They knew
[45:41] this all along.
[45:45] Go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[45:49] for yourselves.
[45:51] And while they went to buy, the
[45:53] bridegroom came, and they that were
[45:56] ready went in with him in the marriage,
[45:59] and the door was shut. Afterward came
[46:02] also the other virgin, saying, Lord,
[46:05] Lord, open to us. But he answered and
[46:09] said, "Verily I say unto you, I know you
[46:14] not." That word know means was never any
[46:18] relationship.
[46:20] That's so good. Watch therefore, for you
[46:23] know, for ye know neither the day nor
[46:27] the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.
[46:31] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[46:33] reading of the word. As you're being
[46:35] seated, I want to read one more portion
[46:38] of scripture
[46:41] here and this is out of 1 Thessalonians
[46:44] chapter 4 and verse 15- 18.
[46:50] For this we say unto you by the word of
[46:52] the Lord, that we which are alive and
[46:56] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[46:59] not prevent them which are
[47:02] asleep. For the Lord himself shall
[47:06] descend from heaven with a shout and
[47:09] with the voice of the archangel and with
[47:11] the trump of God, and the dead in Christ
[47:15] shall rise first.
[47:17] Now to understand just to pause just a
[47:21] moment that the rapture
[47:22] itself is not just a moment. It's an
[47:26] event that's going on.
[47:30] As a matter of fact, when this this
[47:33] scripture here in the opening of the
[47:36] seals as it takes place in Revelations
[47:40] 10 and Revelations 5. And this is why
[47:43] the prophet would say concerning taking
[47:46] that book in Revelations 5, it's the
[47:49] most sublime act that has been done.
[47:54] So redemption was paid at Calvary and
[47:58] the lamb is seated on the mercy seat
[48:01] until every name has been thoroughly
[48:07] redeemed. Now that's the words from
[48:09] souls in prison. What does brother
[48:10] Bannon mean by thoroughly
[48:13] redeemed? It's already they have already
[48:16] been claimed. The blood has already been
[48:19] shed and been claimed. But when the Holy
[48:21] Spirit searches out the names on that
[48:24] book, then once the new birth has come,
[48:28] because only the elect of God, the names
[48:31] on that book, they're the only ones that
[48:33] can be born again
[48:35] because they're the only ones that have
[48:37] something to quicken. Then that's when
[48:39] they we have been thoroughly redeemed
[48:43] and that's where redemption and it
[48:45] manifests itself. It redemption is not
[48:48] just a teaching it's a manifestation.
[48:52] It's a it's a declaration that you when
[48:54] redemption has come and when the spirit
[48:57] of God begins to take hold upon our life
[48:59] through justification then through
[49:02] sanctification more of the same spirit
[49:05] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[49:07] leading into the adoption of the person
[49:10] of Christ himself. It is a reflection of
[49:14] redemption where we are no longer our
[49:18] own. Amen.
[49:22] We have always belonged to him. We were
[49:26] always sheep, but we've always sons, but
[49:31] God sending his word makes us aware of
[49:35] who we are. And what rights belong to us
[49:40] as the children of God. See, that's how
[49:43] we approach the word is by faith. And
[49:46] nothing can bring faith outside of
[49:49] hearing the word of God. And it's the
[49:52] spirit of God quickening the word,
[49:54] delivering that word that causes our
[49:57] faith to rise in the promise that's
[50:00] being waved before us so that we can
[50:03] walk to that promise with an assurance.
[50:06] I know who I am. I know what belongs to
[50:09] me and I'm going to receive it. Amen.
[50:14] See, that's the work of God. A church
[50:17] cannot bring that but God's presence.
[50:21] See, this is why that the fulfillment of
[50:23] the word, God has laid it upon himself.
[50:28] When he gave a promise, the prophet
[50:30] would say it like this. When God gives a
[50:33] promise, it is God committing himself.
[50:37] So every word such as even healing,
[50:40] deliverance, the baptism of the Holy
[50:43] Ghost, rapture, every word that God has
[50:46] given, it is God committing himself to
[50:49] see that word through. Amen.
[50:52] And he will not fail. He cannot fail
[50:56] because he is his word. And heavens and
[50:58] earth will pass away, but my word shall
[51:02] never fail. Amen. Amen. That's why
[51:06] brother Brandon will quote he said the
[51:09] the the the colored gentleman he said as
[51:11] he said I would rather be standing on
[51:14] the word of God than to be standing on
[51:16] earth or even in the heavens. He said
[51:18] because they will pass away but the word
[51:21] shall not pass away.
[51:23] Amen. There's not been one promise that
[51:26] God ever made that he's failed to keep.
[51:29] Right.
[51:32] Failures and things that we see is not
[51:36] continuing on and trusting God in the
[51:39] midst of every circumstance because
[51:41] every promise that God begins to make
[51:44] known to our lives, there is always
[51:46] going to be a battle that comes with it.
[51:49] Oh yeah. Satan can come with mind
[51:51] battles. situations can arise in your
[51:54] life to try to break and bring a
[51:57] distraction from what is really true
[52:00] eternal riches. And that's the promise
[52:03] that God is bringing before us. Now, let
[52:06] me just go on and read here because this
[52:08] this promise in this here, as I said,
[52:11] the rapture is not just an event as far
[52:14] as just just just something of a moment.
[52:17] It's a climaxing because the rapture is
[52:21] what started as the prophet tells us in
[52:23] the seventh seal when the seals have
[52:26] been open and Christ himself right among
[52:29] us that has now set the cycle of the
[52:33] rapture in motion. Amen. There's already
[52:36] been a catching away not just from
[52:39] denominationalism but there is a
[52:41] catching away from our own nature.
[52:45] That's right. There's a grace that God
[52:47] has given in this hour. That is a
[52:49] measure that he promised that there
[52:52] would be a bride upon earth that would
[52:55] make herself ready. And if she is to
[52:58] make herself ready, then the material
[53:01] has to be here in order for her to make
[53:04] herself ready. And he's Jehovah Gyra.
[53:08] Is that right? He's Jehovah Gyra. So
[53:11] here we see with this scripture, for the
[53:14] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[53:16] with a shout. Right? If you want, turn
[53:19] over in your Bibles to Revelations 10.
[53:21] Let's just go there a moment.
[53:34] And I'm not going to read this whole
[53:36] portion, but I want to but I want to
[53:38] just refer to there because sometimes I
[53:41] I don't want to be take for granted or
[53:44] to
[53:46] assume. But here in Revelations 10 after
[53:50] what takes place in Revelations
[53:54] 5 where uh the where the book
[53:58] is taken in Revelations 5 and the seals
[54:02] are open in Revelations 10:1. And I saw
[54:06] another mighty angel come down from
[54:09] heaven, clothed with the cloud, and a
[54:12] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[54:14] was as it were the sun, and his feet as
[54:17] pillars of fire. And he had in his hand
[54:20] a little book open, and he set his right
[54:23] foot upon the sea, and his left foot on
[54:25] the earth. And you look and say why is
[54:27] it a little book? This is the book of
[54:30] redemption.
[54:32] Hallelujah. But a little book, it refers
[54:34] and speaks expressly that this coming is
[54:39] for the bride.
[54:42] This this this is why this is why the
[54:45] message remember brother Brandham was
[54:46] kind of being pressured of why don't you
[54:48] go out in the nerve centers? Why don't
[54:50] you take this out there? Why don't you
[54:52] and brother Brandham simply says it just
[54:54] like this. It isn't their food.
[54:58] Wow. That's spiritual food in deceased
[55:00] and choosing a bride knoweth it not.
[55:03] Those very things man's filter over and
[55:06] over. You see good intentions but to
[55:08] understand this word is not a word that
[55:12] has come to persuade people or to push
[55:16] people. But you see, as all along when
[55:19] God begins to make his word known,
[55:24] that's why the Holy Ghost is the most
[55:27] important part of the church of the
[55:30] living God. As a matter of fact, it is
[55:32] the Holy Ghost that makes the church of
[55:34] the living God. And the Holy Ghost is
[55:37] the word himself living right among us
[55:41] and through us. It's him that does the
[55:43] work, not by power, not by might, but by
[55:46] my spirit, saith the Lord. It's the Holy
[55:49] Spirit that can take a stony heart and
[55:51] soften that heart and give you a new
[55:53] spirit. And then he himself sat down and
[55:56] change your nature.
[55:58] It's the Holy Spirit that can take when
[56:01] we're right in the midst of a time of
[56:03] gloom and a time where we feel like
[56:05] giving up and a time where we see no way
[56:07] out. The Holy Spirit is the one who
[56:09] comes and reminds us and breaks back the
[56:12] scales that we can see that the vision
[56:15] is just as sure when it was spoken and
[56:19] delivered and moved in our hearts.
[56:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are under the
[56:25] administration of the son of man. Amen.
[56:29] Hallelujah. This is Christ himself
[56:33] our Lord. Amen.
[56:37] Hallelujah.
[56:38] Now
[56:40] verse three, it said a crowd with a
[56:42] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[56:44] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[56:46] thunders uttered their voices. That's
[56:48] God's that's the voices of God. This is
[56:50] a complete revelation in this hour.
[56:54] Now he goes on even in verse four. I was
[56:58] about to write those things, but he
[57:00] said, "Seal it up uh which the seven
[57:02] thunders uttered and write them not."
[57:05] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[57:07] sea and upon the earth, lifted up his
[57:09] hand to heaven, and swear by him that
[57:10] liveth forever and ever, who created
[57:12] heaven, the things that therein are, and
[57:14] the earth, and the things that are
[57:15] therein, and the sea, and the things
[57:17] which are therein, that there should be
[57:19] time no longer, no longer delayed for
[57:23] this revealing, that will bring
[57:27] rapturing faith. this revealing when
[57:30] this revelation it starts the church
[57:33] going as a matter of fact it is this
[57:37] breaking of the revelation as the
[57:39] prophet tells us in feast of the
[57:40] trumpets that the bride of Christ is
[57:44] caught up in that seventh seal
[57:46] revelation
[57:47] now listen to me terminology should not
[57:50] be strange to us but let me just be very
[57:52] simple with that seventh seal is Christ
[57:56] himself and when we can get a real
[57:58] vision of him losing sight of ourselves.
[58:02] We see that there is nothing in
[58:05] question. But there is nothing but
[58:08] certainty that lies ahead. That at that
[58:11] day you shall know that I am in my
[58:13] father, the father in you, and ye in me
[58:16] and I in you. This is that day to do
[58:19] what? Bring rest, bring certainty. As
[58:22] the prophet said, under the seventh seal
[58:24] is a relaxing time. Amen. It brings
[58:28] rest.
[58:31] Rest, Ruth.
[58:33] He will not fail to bring a full
[58:35] achievement.
[58:38] But in the days of the seventh angel,
[58:40] when he shall begin to sound, the
[58:43] mystery of God will be finished as he
[58:46] hath declared to his servants the
[58:48] prophets.
[58:50] Deity tabernacling in flesh. Once again,
[58:55] this is why seminaries cannot teach the
[58:58] mystery of God.
[59:00] No, sir. That's true. It's God declaring
[59:05] the mystery of God himself right among
[59:08] us. And it lets you know, it brings to
[59:10] our awareness, breaking back amnesia
[59:13] that, hey, that's who I am. It's that
[59:15] eagle that's flying
[59:17] above. It's his presence. It's deity.
[59:20] the testimony of a true witness among
[59:23] us, the Lord Jesus Christ, that it's not
[59:26] a rumor. He is alive.
[59:33] And he's doing the same things that he
[59:34] did before. I'm not just talking about
[59:37] miracles among us, but I'm talking about
[59:39] the life that I live shall you live
[59:42] also.
[59:44] Hallelujah. Be of good cheer.
[59:48] Hallelujah. Don't be afraid because I
[59:50] live, you shall live also.
[59:54] Glory be to God. Life coming in through
[59:57] the body in this hour.
[1:00:00] Now in verse 8 through 11, I don't I
[1:00:03] can't read. I'm not going to read all
[1:00:05] the through that, but this is where we
[1:00:06] stand in this
[1:00:08] hour. Revelations 10
[1:00:11] 1-7, the prophet has come and he has
[1:00:14] done what God called him to do. That's
[1:00:16] right. Amen. But Revelations 8 through11
[1:00:20] is a commissioning
[1:00:22] that where we are instructed to go take
[1:00:26] the little book. It's not going to be
[1:00:29] not going to be put in our hands. We got
[1:00:30] to take it. Amen.
[1:00:33] We have to take what has been opened.
[1:00:36] And that little book being open is that
[1:00:38] revelation of who you are.
[1:00:42] You must take that and possess that
[1:00:45] revelation. Like Paul said, I seek to
[1:00:48] apprehend that which I've been
[1:00:50] apprehended of. I count not myself to be
[1:00:54] perfect, but these things I do. I press
[1:00:57] toward the mark
[1:01:00] of the high calling.
[1:01:03] Why? Because as the bride, you are the
[1:01:05] bedding ground of the expression of the
[1:01:09] son of man. In this hour, you are the
[1:01:12] chosen bedding ground.
[1:01:15] The word has spoken. No longer in
[1:01:18] question. Hagar, Sarah, no longer in
[1:01:20] question. The word has spoken and the
[1:01:23] word has identified its bedding ground
[1:01:26] that it has provided for itself to come
[1:01:29] forth through.
[1:01:32] You're not here by chance. God knew the
[1:01:34] bed of time you'd be planted in. God
[1:01:37] even knew all the situations that would
[1:01:39] be around your life, all the gum and
[1:01:42] mock and whatever more. He even knew
[1:01:43] maybe all the religious buildup, but
[1:01:46] that cannot prevent the word of God from
[1:01:49] coming to pass.
[1:01:53] Because let me tell you something, there
[1:01:55] is nothing greater than the shakina
[1:01:57] glory of almighty God. the presence of
[1:02:00] God. That word, what's it doing? It's
[1:02:03] laying claim upon your life.
[1:02:08] It's drawing you and I cuz he said, "If
[1:02:10] I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto
[1:02:14] me." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:02:19] Thank you, Lord. My Now, the Lord
[1:02:23] himself, verse
[1:02:24] 16, shall descend from heaven with a
[1:02:28] shout. That's the message of the hour.
[1:02:31] The voice of the archangel with the
[1:02:33] trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:02:35] shall rise first. Now I'm reading this
[1:02:37] for it to to you to understand as the
[1:02:40] prophet tells us, he does all three
[1:02:43] while he's descending.
[1:02:48] So we are living in the moments of his
[1:02:52] coming.
[1:02:55] Amen. We see signs. We see things taking
[1:02:58] place. We've seen the Pope come from
[1:03:00] America. We've seen these things all
[1:03:03] along. But let me just say this. Has a
[1:03:05] real genuine believer. You know, we see
[1:03:07] prophecies. We see things laying out
[1:03:09] before us. But let me just also remind
[1:03:11] you where the prophet would tell us in
[1:03:13] the message over and over. He said, "I
[1:03:16] see not one thing left to be unfulfilled
[1:03:18] that would hinder the coming of the
[1:03:20] Lord."
[1:03:21] You know what that is? It's bringing us
[1:03:23] to a place that really there is to be
[1:03:26] ready at all times. And you know what?
[1:03:28] God allows the situations to arise
[1:03:31] around our life to remind us you've not
[1:03:35] arrived home yet.
[1:03:39] This is not your final home. This body,
[1:03:41] as much as you can pump it full of
[1:03:43] organic foods and whatever more, and I'm
[1:03:46] not against all that, but you can do all
[1:03:48] of this, but you know what? You're still
[1:03:50] not in your resting place. He said, "If
[1:03:54] I go away, I prepare a place for you.
[1:03:57] And if I go away and prepare a place, I
[1:04:00] will come again and receive you unto
[1:04:03] myself." This, listen to me, this
[1:04:06] message is a declaration of what God
[1:04:09] said he would do. And this word is
[1:04:12] echoing out that there is a place, there
[1:04:15] is a body, there is a
[1:04:18] representation, there is for every true
[1:04:21] son and daughter of God a theophony,
[1:04:25] a word body. That which is before the
[1:04:28] throne of God. Hey, listen. We've got
[1:04:31] representations in Washington that know
[1:04:33] nothing about us.
[1:04:36] Let me just don't even have to leave
[1:04:38] Lorraine. You got people sitting here
[1:04:40] that don't know nothing about us. And
[1:04:43] yet they're they're they're maybe
[1:04:44] representing our district or or whatever
[1:04:47] more. But let me tell you what you and I
[1:04:49] have before the throne of God sitting
[1:04:51] right there in heavenly places is our
[1:04:54] representation.
[1:04:55] That was which was part of God from
[1:04:58] before the foundation of the world. That
[1:05:00] theophony right there. And brother, when
[1:05:02] that word it sounds to our heart, it
[1:05:05] begins to take a hold of our life. And
[1:05:07] what happens when you have heard from
[1:05:10] your theophony? A real evidence is you
[1:05:13] leave the other thing. Hallelujah. And
[1:05:18] what you have heard has become eagle
[1:05:20] food to you.
[1:05:24] I said has it become eagle food. Have
[1:05:27] you left the other thing?
[1:05:34] Verse 17. Then we which are alive and
[1:05:38] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:05:40] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:05:43] the air. Hallelujah. And so shall we
[1:05:46] ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort
[1:05:49] one another with these words. Now this
[1:05:53] event the church world is there. Well
[1:05:58] many not all believe in a rapture.
[1:06:02] You could even be be incredible how some
[1:06:04] denominations will even split and they
[1:06:07] believe in a
[1:06:08] rapture. But you
[1:06:11] see, let me just say it. They can only
[1:06:15] know what light has been emitted to them
[1:06:18] and what they're ordained to know.
[1:06:21] Are you hearing me?
[1:06:23] This is why brother Brandon would call
[1:06:25] that objects of pity. not to be looked
[1:06:27] down on, but to understand God's grace
[1:06:30] that has come to you and I and the
[1:06:32] responsibility that we this word that
[1:06:35] we're under, it is a great
[1:06:37] responsibility that's placed upon us.
[1:06:41] But let me just tell you, God has not
[1:06:43] placed it upon the shoulders of our
[1:06:44] humanity. He's placed it upon his word.
[1:06:48] And there's a part of himself, which is
[1:06:51] his word, that's inside of you and I.
[1:06:54] That's right. Amen. Are you with me? Oh
[1:06:56] yes. That's why when the Holy Spirit has
[1:06:58] come, what does the Holy Ghost come to
[1:06:59] do? Manifest the word. Is that right?
[1:07:02] That's what he comes to do. He comes to
[1:07:04] make the word live. So that part of the
[1:07:06] word that was always in you, the Holy
[1:07:09] Spirit, which the living word, what does
[1:07:11] it come to do? Ignite and make it live.
[1:07:15] Just exactly what God said would do. How
[1:07:19] many of you ever had one of those seed
[1:07:20] packets from the store?
[1:07:22] Okay. about five of you, you know,
[1:07:26] cucumbers, tomatoes, or whatever. You
[1:07:28] know what? You you you look at the front
[1:07:30] of that picture, you're like,
[1:07:31] "Man, BLTs, boy, on these beef steak,
[1:07:34] tomatoes."
[1:07:36] But you know what? It starts off with
[1:07:38] little seeds.
[1:07:40] But if you'll turn that package around,
[1:07:42] that's only the picture is only showing
[1:07:44] you what's in the family album when it
[1:07:46] comes to maturity.
[1:07:48] But if you'll turn it over, there's a
[1:07:50] lot of writing. And the writing tells
[1:07:53] you of all of the stages that it will go
[1:07:57] through until it comes to that place.
[1:08:00] Cuz it ain't no such thing as instant
[1:08:02] tomatoes.
[1:08:04] That's the truth. No. Nope. Tomatoes,
[1:08:07] they got to grow. Now, I know all this
[1:08:09] hydroponic stuff and everything else.
[1:08:14] And we going to get off that, but you
[1:08:17] you you the writing is what declares
[1:08:20] what's going on. And let me tell you
[1:08:21] something. This is why when the Holy
[1:08:24] Spirit has come, you know what happens?
[1:08:26] Our life, the word and our life begin to
[1:08:30] match up.
[1:08:31] There's nothing inside of us that even
[1:08:34] if we're ignorant to something, but when
[1:08:36] the word comes across our pathway, we
[1:08:38] can say amen to the word of God. Why?
[1:08:41] Because the representation is a part of
[1:08:44] God, the word. And he is the word. It's
[1:08:46] already wrought right here in the seeds.
[1:08:50] Right. The word is a seed. I said the
[1:08:53] word is a seed. And it and it has all of
[1:08:57] the lines of maturity until eventually
[1:09:00] it comes to the place that's on the
[1:09:02] picture.
[1:09:04] Oh, there's some storms that got to go
[1:09:06] through, but it's going to come to
[1:09:08] what's on the picture. And God took a
[1:09:11] picture of you before the foundation of
[1:09:14] the world.
[1:09:18] Hallelujah. And when you have a picture,
[1:09:20] then you have then a negative. And the
[1:09:23] negative has been submitted down here.
[1:09:25] And that negative is that sea, that
[1:09:28] representation that was taken of the
[1:09:31] positive. And when the negative has been
[1:09:33] fully developed in this earth,
[1:09:38] it will go to match
[1:09:42] what that picture he took. And in that
[1:09:45] body, oh, I've got a body over yonder.
[1:09:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
[1:09:54] Well, we're not anywhere we were where I
[1:09:55] thought we'd be, but we're right where
[1:09:57] he wants us.
[1:10:00] Hallelujah. But you see, the world is,
[1:10:03] you know, they're looking for it's going
[1:10:05] to be a trumpet step out and and blow
[1:10:07] and my the assembling. No, God is look,
[1:10:11] God is getting his people together by
[1:10:14] vindicating his word right now. Amen.
[1:10:17] Amen.
[1:10:19] God is is bringing his people together
[1:10:23] not by, you know, people going and
[1:10:25] corraling and and, you know, pulling
[1:10:27] people and no, it's God vindicating
[1:10:32] his word.
[1:10:34] Now, let me just drop this in. Okay?
[1:10:38] You think about how God will send his
[1:10:41] word. And when we look at the
[1:10:44] sovereignty of God, we know that God's
[1:10:48] plan cannot be defeated.
[1:10:51] We know that every name that is written
[1:10:54] in the lamb section of the book of life
[1:10:57] is going to be there. And when I say by
[1:11:00] being there is because they have come
[1:11:02] through the plan and approach, the
[1:11:05] provided way that God has made available
[1:11:09] to them. That's right. Is that right?
[1:11:12] They they'll come through that now with
[1:11:16] that certainty and that sovereign. What
[1:11:18] a glorious revelation the sovereignty of
[1:11:21] God is. Amen. You know, Calvin tapped
[1:11:24] into that. Yeah. And when Calvin tapped
[1:11:27] into that, it was truth. Yeah. But then
[1:11:30] Calvin got to leaning clear over to
[1:11:33] where there's a lot of different points
[1:11:35] within it, but let me just deal with
[1:11:36] this one. to where that it was, well,
[1:11:40] you know, whoever is going to be there
[1:11:41] is going to be there.
[1:11:44] Uh we don't need to have revivals
[1:11:45] anymore. We don't need, you know, it it
[1:11:48] gets to a place where then it's taking
[1:11:51] away from the word of God because God
[1:11:54] has always had a provided approach for
[1:11:58] his children. That's right. Is that
[1:12:00] right? He had the brazen serpent in the
[1:12:03] wilderness when when when when that went
[1:12:04] out, God had another thing. When the
[1:12:06] pool of Bethesdna, God would send down
[1:12:08] an angel at a certain season to stir the
[1:12:11] water. God had a provided approach. And
[1:12:13] you say, "What is that provided
[1:12:15] approach?" Is he himself coming to
[1:12:18] vindicate his word? He makes known his
[1:12:22] way of approach that I am the way.
[1:12:28] And with that coming, see that's needed.
[1:12:31] This is why it takes more than
[1:12:33] theology. That's true. I like how the
[1:12:36] prophet talks about it when he speaks of
[1:12:38] Amos and Micah and he says it was going
[1:12:41] to take more than just knowing the law
[1:12:43] and the prophets and theology to crack
[1:12:46] their stony hearts. It was going to take
[1:12:48] a thus sayaith the Lord. You say, "Isn't
[1:12:52] this thus sayaith the Lord?" It is thus
[1:12:54] sayaith the Lord. But when God himself
[1:12:57] steps forward and begins to speak his
[1:13:00] word over that generation, it's that
[1:13:03] which will break amnesia.
[1:13:07] It's his presence coming over as the
[1:13:09] great magnet that breaks back the veil.
[1:13:13] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:16] That's why nothing can replace nothing
[1:13:19] can take the place of him who is the
[1:13:22] word, the Holy Spirit among us. Amen.
[1:13:25] Now this is why that even in the
[1:13:28] scriptures as we reading
[1:13:31] here in in in our text of Matthew 25 you
[1:13:36] know this is a a parable that is likened
[1:13:39] of the kingdom of heaven of where we
[1:13:41] have 10 virgins five wise five foolish
[1:13:46] and and everything is set up because
[1:13:48] like the prophet would tell us it's an
[1:13:50] eastern book and to understand it you
[1:13:54] know I I I just just put it in in simple
[1:13:57] terms like this as the Holy Spirit would
[1:13:59] direct us to bring forth certain things
[1:14:02] and bring them over. This this whole
[1:14:05] part is actually the Jewish wedding
[1:14:08] procession there in Matthew 25. It's
[1:14:10] it's a parable and it's a a procession
[1:14:13] from the bride's father's house to the
[1:14:16] groom's house.
[1:14:18] And it's at night and it's illuminated
[1:14:20] by lamps. the groom with attendance.
[1:14:22] They would arrive at the bride's house
[1:14:24] and the virgins who were essentially
[1:14:26] attendance of the bride would light the
[1:14:28] way and the arrival of the groom was
[1:14:31] announced with a cry and the procession
[1:14:34] would continue to the wedding feast.
[1:14:37] Now, what I want to speak on is lamp
[1:14:39] trimming
[1:14:41] time. Hallelujah. Now, don't get scared.
[1:14:44] Don't get scared. You say, "Brother
[1:14:45] Sammy, you've been already speaking a
[1:14:48] little while." But don't get don't get
[1:14:50] frightful. Don't get frightened. It'll
[1:14:52] be all right. It'll be all right. Look
[1:14:54] at your neighbor and say, "It'll be all
[1:14:55] right."
[1:14:59] That's right. Amen.
[1:15:03] So, the engagement has already taken
[1:15:05] place. The betroal has already happened.
[1:15:09] But the coming of the bridegroom from
[1:15:13] his house to the bride's father's house
[1:15:16] to get her is a time that is reserved
[1:15:20] that only he alone knows.
[1:15:24] That is so good.
[1:15:27] But there as the scripture says at the
[1:15:30] midnight hour there was a cry that went
[1:15:33] forth. So there had to be one that was
[1:15:36] able to alert glory and and declare the
[1:15:42] bridegroom is coming. Yes. So this whole
[1:15:47] parable of Matthew 25, we are living in
[1:15:52] the time of the fulfillment of this
[1:15:55] parable
[1:15:57] because never even though the coming of
[1:16:00] the Lord has been preached through every
[1:16:02] age and they looked for it. They lived
[1:16:06] for it. As a matter of fact, in taking
[1:16:08] sides with Jesus, the prophet said they
[1:16:10] went in the ground running, and when the
[1:16:13] resurrection comes, they'll keep they'll
[1:16:15] come right out running in stride just
[1:16:18] like they were.
[1:16:20] Paul believed the coming of the Lord was
[1:16:23] in his day, right?
[1:16:26] They they did not have the understanding
[1:16:29] it's going to be at the end down here,
[1:16:31] right? But all of the prophets all along
[1:16:34] have looked forward to this moment and
[1:16:37] to this time. Hey, listen. This is a
[1:16:39] glorious time. This is the effects of
[1:16:42] redemption that's been going on down
[1:16:44] through the ages where the Holy Spirit
[1:16:46] has been assembling and taking a people
[1:16:49] for his name's sake. And he's been
[1:16:51] building his own body by his word. And
[1:16:55] now he's coming as as the head of that
[1:16:58] body as as to declare this is my
[1:17:02] crowning achievement. This is the trophy
[1:17:05] of my grace. This is what what has been
[1:17:09] produced by my word. Oh hallelujah. We
[1:17:12] are going to stand there and he will
[1:17:15] present unto himself our glorious church
[1:17:20] without spot, wrinkle or blemish. Amen.
[1:17:23] Amen. And it all starts with an inside
[1:17:25] work. But this lamp trimming time where
[1:17:30] the there would be one that would
[1:17:32] declare it. It's the midnight cry. It's
[1:17:36] the announcement. The coming of the Lord
[1:17:38] is on. But to recognize that when the
[1:17:41] coming of the Lord, it is a process. The
[1:17:45] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:17:48] with a shout.
[1:17:50] and how that God so said it all through
[1:17:54] the scriptures, he's placed it, it would
[1:17:57] be a sudden secret going away. It said
[1:18:01] it we would come as a thief in the night
[1:18:05] all the way through the scripture. So
[1:18:07] it's not something that it is as it were
[1:18:10] an announcement to the whole world. Yet
[1:18:13] this message has went seven times around
[1:18:16] this world.
[1:18:18] Now you say, "Well, how does that
[1:18:20] parallel sudden secret going away from
[1:18:22] the church?" The prophet tells us that
[1:18:24] there was people on the radios
[1:18:26] announcing that that that that Japan was
[1:18:29] on its way to Pearl Harbor. He said,
[1:18:31] "But what it was, they had left their
[1:18:33] post and they didn't believe there was
[1:18:35] any imminent threat and they went down
[1:18:37] there and were drinking and everything
[1:18:39] else going on." He said, "What it was is
[1:18:42] they failed to hear the message in the
[1:18:46] message Amen.
[1:18:48] Amen. That's what's important is hearing
[1:18:52] the message inside of the message. I
[1:18:55] say, listen friends, if there's
[1:18:56] anything, let us be humble in this
[1:18:58] moment. If if we've not heard it to that
[1:19:00] place, say, God, let me hear the
[1:19:02] message. Within the message, let me hear
[1:19:05] his voice. Amen. Because the message is
[1:19:09] not a some sort of a ritual or a form.
[1:19:14] It's God. Amen. It's the mystery of God
[1:19:17] tabernacling
[1:19:19] in flesh once again. Amen. There's forms
[1:19:22] of godliness all around us. But they
[1:19:25] deny the mystery of God. Deny the power
[1:19:28] thereof. Rituals, forms, and everything.
[1:19:32] We're living in the time when the
[1:19:34] announcement has been made. We're not
[1:19:36] looking that as far the coming of the
[1:19:39] Lord. The coming of the Lord is upon us.
[1:19:41] Now, we understand, you know, people
[1:19:44] sometimes get all messed up with things
[1:19:46] about we we understand the corporal body
[1:19:48] hasn't come yet. We can read that and
[1:19:51] know that within the word and the
[1:19:53] message cuz we know that our change
[1:19:56] comes before we ever meet him in the
[1:19:59] air. Amen. And not only does our change
[1:20:02] come before we ever meet him in the air
[1:20:04] and see him in his corporal body,
[1:20:08] but we're going to be gathered with the
[1:20:10] saints for a period of time, 30 to 40
[1:20:12] days upon this earth.
[1:20:15] And he ain't going to put his feet upon
[1:20:17] this earth. We rise to meet him. He
[1:20:20] already has the place provided between
[1:20:25] the heavens and the earth. Hallelujah.
[1:20:27] Hallelujah. That is so good. So this
[1:20:31] processional that has gone forth, let me
[1:20:34] just drop a few
[1:20:35] things. There's an
[1:20:37] awareness by wise and foolish, right?
[1:20:42] They're aware of his coming, right?
[1:20:45] So it's not that the foolish were
[1:20:47] unaware of his coming.
[1:20:49] True. What it was is they were
[1:20:52] unprepared
[1:20:54] for what they had been hearing.
[1:20:59] Now, God sends his word to you and I.
[1:21:03] And I want you just to think of this
[1:21:04] here. I I I'm just going to eventually
[1:21:07] if if if time carries, I display maybe a
[1:21:09] picture, but that's about it. I just
[1:21:10] want you to listen. I'm just going to go
[1:21:12] as he moves me through some of these
[1:21:14] things. I want you to think of this wise
[1:21:17] and foolish virgin. Virgin meaning that
[1:21:20] they were clean,
[1:21:23] sanctified, living people.
[1:21:28] wise and foolish. So they were both were
[1:21:32] sanctified but the difference was is the
[1:21:36] wise had oil in their vessels and the
[1:21:41] foolish had but let it go out
[1:21:45] now let's just let's look at this just
[1:21:47] for a few moments. Everybody with me?
[1:21:50] The B says this in the in in in the
[1:21:51] church ages exposition. And he says it's
[1:21:54] the second resurrection wherein the five
[1:21:56] foolish come up and notice that they
[1:21:59] were virgins. They did not have the Holy
[1:22:02] Spirit. So they missed being in the
[1:22:04] bride. While the five wise who had oil
[1:22:08] became a part of that bride. But these
[1:22:11] people, he's talking about the foolish
[1:22:13] being a separated god living God-loving
[1:22:15] people and trying to abide in the word
[1:22:17] according to what they knew of it and
[1:22:19] being a help in the work of the Lord
[1:22:21] will come up at the end time. They will
[1:22:23] miss the millennium which you can begin
[1:22:26] to see by these truth is much more
[1:22:28] important and wonderful than we have
[1:22:30] ever thought or believed. Now let me
[1:22:33] just say this to you. The foolish never
[1:22:37] thought they were foolish. That's right.
[1:22:42] They never thought they were foolish.
[1:22:47] However that they lived their life, it
[1:22:50] was definitely a life that was lived
[1:22:53] with
[1:22:54] unpreparedness and with the thought of
[1:22:57] I'll be able to move in the last
[1:22:59] moments.
[1:23:03] And the thing about it is, let me just
[1:23:04] drop, let me just say this, right? You
[1:23:06] say, "Brother Samuel, what's wrong with
[1:23:07] that thinking? Why would you want to
[1:23:09] prepare for something in the last
[1:23:10] moments that you don't even want to be a
[1:23:12] part of now?
[1:23:15] That's true. I mean the you that that's
[1:23:19] the same way with the Holy Ghost. See
[1:23:22] the Holy Ghost doesn't come if you don't
[1:23:23] want him.
[1:23:25] But if you want him, he'll come. He's
[1:23:28] the one that'll create that longing. See
[1:23:30] this is why when Jesus said whom the
[1:23:32] world cannot receive and the prophet
[1:23:33] picks it up in the message the comforter
[1:23:35] he said see if the love of the world is
[1:23:37] still there he won't come but it has to
[1:23:42] come to that place that I want to be
[1:23:44] where he's at I want him I want him more
[1:23:46] than anything in my life he'll come
[1:23:48] listen the Holy Ghost is not a hard
[1:23:50] thing that's right
[1:23:53] it requires death to ourselves that I'm
[1:23:56] I'm finished being me Right. Right. That
[1:24:01] includes maybe all of all reasonings and
[1:24:03] and maybe even things that we've rested
[1:24:06] on and it's not line up and we get to a
[1:24:09] spot and say, "Wait a minute. I don't
[1:24:10] matter." Everything. What matters is is
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost is the oil.
[1:24:16] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And I tell you
[1:24:19] what, I want more of it. Amen.
[1:24:22] Hallelujah. I love what it's done in my
[1:24:24] life and what it's doing. I want more of
[1:24:25] it. Amen. I see it taking over more of
[1:24:28] Samuel and changed in Samuel more and
[1:24:30] more and more. I want more of it.
[1:24:33] You say you sound like an addict.
[1:24:34] Exactly. Right.
[1:24:39] And I don't have to go to some hidden
[1:24:41] place or somewhere out here to get it.
[1:24:43] It's right there. We are in contact with
[1:24:46] the fountain that is open in the house
[1:24:48] of David.
[1:24:51] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:54] Hallelujah. Now notice brother said
[1:24:59] regarding these foolish virgins said all
[1:25:00] these people they had their names in the
[1:25:02] book of life and their names remained.
[1:25:05] And he goes but whose names did not
[1:25:08] remain? It was those of the world system
[1:25:10] churches who fought the bride will be
[1:25:12] those whose names are removed. That is
[1:25:15] who will lose out. They will be cast
[1:25:16] into the lake of fire.
[1:25:19] Brother goes in to say let's take
[1:25:21] another step. First of all, now this is
[1:25:22] where he goes through the four four four
[1:25:24] four groupings of people and he'll pick
[1:25:26] up here with with the second class or
[1:25:28] the foolish virgin in a moment. He says,
[1:25:30] "First of all, we know assuredly that
[1:25:32] the purpose of God stands in election.
[1:25:34] It was purpose in himself. It was God's
[1:25:37] purpose to bring forth a people like
[1:25:38] unto himself that would be a word bride.
[1:25:41] She was chosen before the foundation of
[1:25:43] the world in him. She was fornown and
[1:25:46] beloved before she was ever brought
[1:25:48] forth during the ages upon the earth.
[1:25:50] She was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:25:53] never come into condemnation. She can
[1:25:56] never be in the judgment because sin
[1:26:00] cannot be imputed unto her.
[1:26:04] We could go on in another part. Now,
[1:26:06] brother Bam says secondly, there is
[1:26:08] another class. Their names are also in
[1:26:11] the book of life and they will come up
[1:26:13] in the second resurrection. This is why
[1:26:15] the Bible says, "Blessed are they who
[1:26:17] have part in the first resurrection."
[1:26:21] Amen. That's part of the rapture, a
[1:26:24] designation.
[1:26:26] This is why Paul would say in the book
[1:26:29] of of of of Philippians and would speak
[1:26:32] of the pressing. He said, "Not that as
[1:26:36] though that I have, you know, not
[1:26:38] already attained, but he's pressing that
[1:26:40] he might be delivered out of that second
[1:26:44] resurrection and into the first
[1:26:46] resurrection."
[1:26:50] Most of you know where I'm talking about
[1:26:51] in the scripture and the prophet picks
[1:26:53] that up and and gives us the good
[1:26:54] commentary on that. Secondly, there's
[1:26:56] another class. Their names are also in
[1:26:58] the book of life and they will come up
[1:26:59] in the second resurrection. Such are the
[1:27:02] foolish virgins and the righteous as are
[1:27:04] spoken of in Matthew 25. In this class
[1:27:07] also are those who do not worship the
[1:27:09] beast or become involved in the
[1:27:11] antichrist system but die for their
[1:27:13] faith even though they are not in the
[1:27:15] bride. Now remember when the rapture
[1:27:19] comes what does it say in the book of
[1:27:22] Daniel? They that are holy holy still.
[1:27:25] That's bride,
[1:27:26] right? They that are righteous still be
[1:27:28] righteous. That's foolish
[1:27:30] virgin. They that are filthy be filthy
[1:27:33] still. See, remember it turns to the
[1:27:37] Jews. When the bride is taken in
[1:27:40] rapture, the same Holy Spirit moves now
[1:27:44] and anoints those two witnesses of
[1:27:46] Revelations 11.
[1:27:49] And they begin to preach the true
[1:27:51] atonement. Amen.
[1:27:54] The baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[1:27:57] 144,000.
[1:27:58] Yes. Glory. Is that right?
[1:28:02] There will not be any saving going on
[1:28:04] among the Gentiles. Yet, the prophet
[1:28:06] tells us they'll go on preaching and
[1:28:10] holding altar calls and believing
[1:28:12] they're getting saved.
[1:28:15] You know why? Because they're doing it
[1:28:17] right now.
[1:28:20] Now, you're saying, Brother Samuel, that
[1:28:21] there can't be people that can be saved
[1:28:23] if they're trusting on the Lord Jesus
[1:28:25] Christ.
[1:28:26] now. Are you with me? Now,
[1:28:32] but let's just be honest. There's a lot
[1:28:34] of things that we come down to. You
[1:28:35] realize a lot of it there can be a lot
[1:28:38] of things that can just be an emotional
[1:28:39] workup. But let me just say this to you.
[1:28:41] Let me just say this. There's going to
[1:28:42] be a lot of individuals that'll be saved
[1:28:47] because there's a lot in the book, the
[1:28:49] book of life. It's not the little book
[1:28:50] of life. The little book is that lamb
[1:28:54] section. That's the elect. But the grace
[1:28:57] of God that came for you and I has
[1:28:59] spilled over.
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:06] That don't bother me a bit. I'm happy
[1:29:07] about that. Yes, sir. Don't bother me a
[1:29:10] bit cuz you know what? Him saving
[1:29:12] somebody up, that makes me proud of my
[1:29:14] daddy.
[1:29:19] Hallelujah. We might only be able to
[1:29:21] fellowship about salvation, but I know
[1:29:23] what that is. I can fellowship with you.
[1:29:28] My life or your life even sometimes in
[1:29:31] expressing the gospel. You feel
[1:29:33] defeated. Well, well, they they they
[1:29:34] they they didn't come to the message.
[1:29:36] That may not be their allotted part.
[1:29:40] Don't try to put pieces where they don't
[1:29:43] belong. Just shine your light in
[1:29:48] humility. because it can be the very
[1:29:52] light being emitted through our lives
[1:29:54] that will actually cause someone to seek
[1:29:56] for salvation. They won't be part of the
[1:29:58] rapture, but at least they come into a
[1:30:01] place of salvation.
[1:30:06] That's a whole separate messages, but
[1:30:10] I'm so to me I I'm grateful.
[1:30:15] Oh, it's not you and I that's
[1:30:17] controlling who's in and who's out. You
[1:30:18] know what it is? Preach the word. Just
[1:30:21] preach the gospel. Let the wave sheep be
[1:30:23] cast over the people. God declares who
[1:30:27] is his.
[1:30:29] Hallelujah. When amnesia breaks away
[1:30:31] from our life. Oh, glory be to God. So
[1:30:35] good. Brother Bram says here in this
[1:30:37] class, you know, they'll not be part of
[1:30:38] that antichrist system. Nope. As a
[1:30:41] matter of fact, let me come back to my
[1:30:42] point. The prophet said they'll be
[1:30:43] hunted down like dogs. That's right. And
[1:30:46] they'll have to give their life for it.
[1:30:47] Amen. What they believe.
[1:30:53] Now, I tell you friends, the thing
[1:30:55] that's really quite
[1:30:57] pinching is for that of foolish virgin
[1:31:01] that's set right around this message.
[1:31:05] Because that's where the thought's going
[1:31:06] to come. I thought there was a rapture
[1:31:10] and it's already come and you missed it.
[1:31:15] It's sobering.
[1:31:17] But that's a good sobering.
[1:31:19] It's good to have moments of reflection
[1:31:21] cuz we're living we're living in an age
[1:31:23] that's about making everybody feel good.
[1:31:27] It's all about your feelings.
[1:31:29] Everything's You know what? Let's cast
[1:31:31] aside that lady of seeing spirit.
[1:31:35] What I'm interested in as I'm interested
[1:31:37] in knowing where I'm standing today.
[1:31:40] Amen. Oh, brother Samuel. I'm not
[1:31:42] worried about yesterday. Today. Amen.
[1:31:46] today, right now to moment, this moment
[1:31:52] now, not having been born again, but
[1:31:55] they will come up in the se second
[1:31:56] resurrection and go into eternal life.
[1:32:00] Now, so they're they're
[1:32:04] virgins, good, clean, living
[1:32:07] people, but they never went all the way
[1:32:10] with God. Amen.
[1:32:13] Now, in the
[1:32:14] scriptures, the Bible tells us what the
[1:32:17] oil of God is. In Ephesians
[1:32:20] 4:30, it says, "Grieve not the Holy
[1:32:23] Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed
[1:32:25] until the day of redemption."
[1:32:27] And he in Ephesians 1
[1:32:30] and13, it says, "In whom you also
[1:32:33] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:32:35] truth, the gospel of your salvation."
[1:32:38] Brienne, if you want to switch that over
[1:32:39] and pull that up on the screen, that's
[1:32:41] fine. and that I can always take it back
[1:32:43] from you when whenever I need it because
[1:32:46] this is an important this is an
[1:32:48] important scripture right here. After
[1:32:50] that you've heard the word of truth, the
[1:32:52] gospel of your salvation and whom also
[1:32:54] after that ye believed you were sealed
[1:32:56] with the Holy Spirit of promise. So
[1:32:59] believing is not the seal. That's
[1:33:01] Ephesians 1:13.
[1:33:03] But believing you, the Bible said, "He
[1:33:05] that cometh to God must first believe
[1:33:08] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:33:11] them that diligently seek him." Right?
[1:33:13] Down there in Acts chapter 19, they
[1:33:15] believed.
[1:33:17] And that's a start. You've got to
[1:33:18] believe. You can't approach without
[1:33:21] first believing. This is why that when
[1:33:24] God takes a hold of a person's life,
[1:33:26] it's wonderful to feel your sins lifted
[1:33:29] and justification. But what made you do
[1:33:32] everything in the first place is still
[1:33:34] there. Amen. That's so true.
[1:33:37] Sanctification is what a further working
[1:33:40] of the Holy Spirit to clean out all the
[1:33:43] unclean habits. And habits are spirits.
[1:33:49] Come on. These ain't mountain words.
[1:33:51] That's what it is. It isn't just
[1:33:52] somebody going through a reformation.
[1:33:54] And let me just say this to you in this
[1:33:56] way. When the gospel is being preached
[1:33:59] and even when the word will begin to be
[1:34:02] agreed with, the spirit of God being
[1:34:04] preached will cast away the spirit from
[1:34:07] a heart that desires to be saved.
[1:34:11] And as that word is going forth, because
[1:34:12] there's nothing greater than washing of
[1:34:15] water by the word, when that heart
[1:34:17] begins to agree with the word, the
[1:34:19] unclean spirit, the Bible said, not when
[1:34:21] the unclean spirit was cast out, but
[1:34:24] when the unclean spirit left. Amen.
[1:34:28] Oh, I tell you, if there's one thing
[1:34:30] about it, agreeing with the word, if
[1:34:32] there's one thing we want to do is make
[1:34:33] devils uncomfortable.
[1:34:36] You agreeing with the word of God,
[1:34:38] yielding to the word of God. Listen,
[1:34:40] don't let the devil back you up and say,
[1:34:42] "You're still doing this." You're
[1:34:44] looking at the word and saying, "Amen to
[1:34:46] the word." How do you know you saying
[1:34:48] amen at that moment? So be it that the
[1:34:51] amen himself won't come right down there
[1:34:54] and take that habit out of your life.
[1:34:57] He's a sanctifier.
[1:35:02] Sanctify them through thy word. Thy word
[1:35:05] is truth.
[1:35:09] He's still the same God that has
[1:35:11] saraphins that take live coals from the
[1:35:13] altar to the lips.
[1:35:16] Lord Jesus. G. Is that right? Yes, sir.
[1:35:20] Hallelujah. So, begin to agree with the
[1:35:22] word and devils begin to leave.
[1:35:26] Yeah. They leave. They aren't cast out.
[1:35:28] They leave on their own accord. I know
[1:35:31] there's casting out devils. But the
[1:35:32] prophet takes us that when that unclean
[1:35:34] spirit has gone out, he said, see, it
[1:35:36] left on its own accord.
[1:35:39] But the thing of it is is once the devil
[1:35:43] has gone out,
[1:35:45] That's a time to get really desperate
[1:35:48] about getting filled. That's right.
[1:35:52] Because the devil will come right back
[1:35:54] and he finds the house all garnished.
[1:35:57] That's right. It ain't a house that's
[1:35:59] laying around with trash bags in it and
[1:36:01] stuff laying everywhere and oh my, it's
[1:36:03] just all messed up. Man, this is what
[1:36:06] should we do with this house? Should we
[1:36:07] flip it? Flip it. Let's gasoline it and
[1:36:10] burn it.
[1:36:11] Nope. That's not how Listen, that's not
[1:36:14] how the unclean spirit finds a house. He
[1:36:18] finds it swept.
[1:36:20] That's right. Garnished,
[1:36:23] cleaned,
[1:36:25] but that gives the opportunity for the
[1:36:27] Holy Ghost, the oil to come down into
[1:36:31] your life. Amen.
[1:36:33] You say, "Ain't it been the oil all
[1:36:35] along?" Yeah. It's been the oil and
[1:36:38] justification that allows a lamp to emit
[1:36:42] I've been saved.
[1:36:44] Follow me now. That's good. Allows a
[1:36:47] lamp to emit I've been saved. Then more
[1:36:52] of the Holy Spirit, more a deeper work
[1:36:55] allows the emitting of the light. I've
[1:36:58] been sanctified.
[1:37:01] But you see, it's got to go deeper than
[1:37:04] just sanctification. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:37:08] these foolish virgins were sanctified.
[1:37:11] That's right. They had oil in their
[1:37:14] lamps for a period of time. But where
[1:37:18] the oil was at, it was able to go out.
[1:37:24] This is why the seal of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:27] is is is declared and ministered in this
[1:37:31] hour. This is the sealing time as much
[1:37:34] as it is the mark of the beast coming
[1:37:37] upon. It's the time of sealing as well.
[1:37:42] That is so good. It's him who hath
[1:37:44] sealed us and given us the earnest of
[1:37:46] his spirit.
[1:37:49] Let me just read this to
[1:37:53] you. Man, oh man.
[1:38:03] In the message of
[1:38:04] rapture, the prophet
[1:38:07] says, "What is it? Is a message to get
[1:38:12] the people
[1:38:14] together." A message comes forth first.
[1:38:17] Lamp trimming time. Rise and trim your
[1:38:23] lamp. That's what happened in the
[1:38:25] seventh watch. Behold the bridegroom
[1:38:27] coming. rise and trim your lamp. That's
[1:38:29] what Malachi 4 is, is lamp trimming
[1:38:34] time.
[1:38:36] Now, he goes on and he's talking about,
[1:38:39] my dear brother and sister, he says,
[1:38:41] "We've seen God, the God from heaven,
[1:38:44] stand before groups of men and declare
[1:38:46] himself as he ever did." What's he
[1:38:48] declaring? The token has been right here
[1:38:51] in our midst. The person of Jesus
[1:38:54] Christ. This is why the prophet in the
[1:38:57] desperation message after the token
[1:38:59] message in the morning he said if we
[1:39:01] don't get desperate
[1:39:05] the token the person of Christ that's
[1:39:07] right here with us is going to pass
[1:39:09] right through
[1:39:14] us.
[1:39:16] Now he says it like this. He
[1:39:19] says we see all of this this
[1:39:22] denominational system it's dead. He goes
[1:39:23] through these things. Let me just let me
[1:39:25] just skip down. He says, "You've got to
[1:39:28] get into Christ. You got to flee from
[1:39:30] those systems. If you're in Christ,
[1:39:33] there's not a word written in here, but
[1:39:35] what? You'll believe it." I don't care
[1:39:38] what anybody else says. And then God
[1:39:41] makes that thing manifest. Cuz when he
[1:39:43] pours the spirit upon the word, what
[1:39:45] happens? It's just like putting water on
[1:39:47] any other seed. It'll live and bring
[1:39:49] forth of its kind. You say, "I got the
[1:39:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost." That don't
[1:39:56] mean that you're saved. Not by a long
[1:39:59] ways. Now, what we dealing with here is
[1:40:03] oil that can go out.
[1:40:06] Because just to have the baptism of the
[1:40:08] Holy Ghost upon our
[1:40:11] spirit is not enough. That's right.
[1:40:14] Amen.
[1:40:15] This is Listen, friends, and I'm not
[1:40:17] casting any disparity upon anyone. I'm
[1:40:20] just trying to say that sometimes the
[1:40:21] things that we look at and you're trying
[1:40:23] to make sense of because you've seen
[1:40:25] fruit for so long and all of a sudden
[1:40:27] the things now you see well that's not
[1:40:29] the same fruit and before you would have
[1:40:32] taken this fruit and declared it that is
[1:40:34] a son and daughter of God fully fully
[1:40:36] sealed and everything and now when you
[1:40:38] see certain fruit you realize that's not
[1:40:40] the fruit of a son and daughter of God
[1:40:41] at all. That's not an expression of a
[1:40:44] sealed child of God.
[1:40:47] What was that? The Holy Spirit was
[1:40:49] there, but it was only there in the
[1:40:52] realm of the spirit. And let me just
[1:40:55] tell you what the prophet says. He said,
[1:40:57] "When that rain falls on the just and
[1:40:59] unjust, it can make a cockaur act just
[1:41:03] like a wheat."
[1:41:06] But you see, the Holy Ghost, listen to
[1:41:08] me now, did not come to make us act like
[1:41:11] message believers.
[1:41:14] That's not the goal. Cuz God don't want
[1:41:16] impersonators or actors.
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:20] But the Holy Ghost is come as he said it
[1:41:23] in the beginning to put his chosen
[1:41:27] vessels in service. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:41:33] And in manifesting lamb nature, a
[1:41:37] serant's heart. Amen.
[1:41:40] Amen.
[1:41:42] Are you hearing me? Amen. This is why
[1:41:44] this is not an just an exclusive quote.
[1:41:46] It's all the way through and 65. But
[1:41:49] especially as it hones down in these
[1:41:51] last messages
[1:41:54] because you know why to have it just on
[1:41:57] the
[1:41:57] spirit then it can run out. That's
[1:42:00] right. Where's the fire? Well, I mean I
[1:42:04] shouted back there. I you can have all
[1:42:07] those emotions and maybe maybe it was no
[1:42:09] emotions at all. You see, Satan likes to
[1:42:12] take things that are precious
[1:42:15] promises, such as where the prophet will
[1:42:18] declare to us all through the seven
[1:42:20] church agents all the way through the
[1:42:22] message and scriptures of what the real
[1:42:25] evidence of the Holy Ghost is is
[1:42:27] receiving the word for your day. That's
[1:42:29] right.
[1:42:31] And yet a person could say, well, and
[1:42:33] they could do that intellectually, it'll
[1:42:36] declare itself. See, we don't. That's
[1:42:38] why it's not up to you or I to go about
[1:42:40] and you know, like brother Brandham was
[1:42:42] asked the question, "Brother Brandom, I
[1:42:43] want to be able to tell whether somebody
[1:42:45] I don't want to be able to tell whereas
[1:42:47] whether somebody's got the Holy Ghost or
[1:42:48] not." Brother Brandham just told him
[1:42:49] say, "You ain't going to be able to do
[1:42:50] that. Don't even get caught up in that."
[1:42:52] I got the quote, right? I mean I mean
[1:42:55] what would be the whole
[1:42:58] Let me just guess if it don't compare
[1:43:00] with you.
[1:43:02] Wow.
[1:43:04] Sorry to bust that legalistic bubble,
[1:43:06] but it needed busting.
[1:43:09] You know, it's always amazing to wear
[1:43:11] that. Well, anyhow, we want to have a
[1:43:13] mirror that we're looking in. We want to
[1:43:15] have a mirror that we can look in and
[1:43:17] evaluate our own self.
[1:43:20] Not comparing oursel. Look at We're not
[1:43:22] comparing oursel to the denominational
[1:43:24] churches. They've got their place. I'm
[1:43:26] not preaching to them this morning. I'm
[1:43:28] preaching to a group of people.
[1:43:31] I'm preaching a message that's for the
[1:43:33] wise virgin.
[1:43:35] [Applause]
[1:43:36] And there might be some that are wise
[1:43:38] but are acting foolish. And the wisdom
[1:43:41] of God is come to alert and drive
[1:43:44] foolishness away.
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:48] Hallelujah. Why? It's God watching over
[1:43:51] his word.
[1:43:52] [Music]
[1:43:55] Hallelujah.
[1:43:57] That's why brother Bam goes into that
[1:43:58] and he talks about how all these other
[1:44:00] things, you know, the rain falling on
[1:44:02] the just and unjust. He's talking about
[1:44:04] the word will bear record of itself. And
[1:44:06] you know, brother Bam had to go through
[1:44:08] that. People were, Brother Jury was
[1:44:10] touching on this last week. People were
[1:44:11] resting upon all of these sensations and
[1:44:14] resting upon feelings and resting upon
[1:44:16] leadings and resting upon that. and to
[1:44:19] understand that God God did not come to
[1:44:24] cause trouble but the sword has come in
[1:44:28] order to separate us from tribulation.
[1:44:33] Amen. The sword has come to set not to
[1:44:37] bring peace as far as with these
[1:44:40] conditions all around us, but to bring
[1:44:42] the peace of God into our heart and
[1:44:44] separate us unto himself.
[1:44:47] That's good. And you know what that
[1:44:48] really brings? It brings peace. It
[1:44:50] brings rest. It brings stability cuz you
[1:44:52] realize you're not resting on any
[1:44:55] sensation.
[1:44:57] Cuz sometimes you feel like worshiping
[1:45:00] and other times you don't. And boy, if
[1:45:03] you're resting on that, you're going to
[1:45:04] be in a fix. If you're in here this
[1:45:05] morning and you don't feel like it, but
[1:45:07] yet I better if I don't do this, I don't
[1:45:09] know. I I ain't been to church or I
[1:45:10] ain't do this. You see what it is?
[1:45:12] You're you're troubling the rest that
[1:45:13] God wants to bring to your life. And you
[1:45:16] know what that'll do? that won't only
[1:45:17] affect your life. It'll affect your
[1:45:19] whole family.
[1:45:21] It'll affect everybody else around you.
[1:45:23] This is why that there's stability of
[1:45:25] the Holy Ghost. It begins in the heart
[1:45:27] of the believer and works out. This is
[1:45:29] why when the Holy Spirit has come into a
[1:45:31] home, it will stabilize hearts on the
[1:45:34] word and center it around the will of
[1:45:37] God.
[1:45:39] Oh, there should have been a bigger amen
[1:45:40] on that. Cuz it ain't the work of man.
[1:45:43] Listen, it's God who knows our children.
[1:45:45] We didn't. We're not the one who went
[1:45:46] and found our children and went up there
[1:45:47] and picked them out. But God has given
[1:45:49] and entrusted their lives into our
[1:45:52] hearts. Have we been perfect? No. Have
[1:45:54] we made a lot of mistakes? Yeah. But you
[1:45:57] know what? Within it all, we've trusted
[1:45:59] God and look to God for his leadership.
[1:46:01] And when it's all said and done, we can
[1:46:03] say it is the grace of God.
[1:46:07] [Applause]
[1:46:09] Because God knew about them.
[1:46:12] sometimes when we couldn't even figure
[1:46:14] them out and they're out of our own gene
[1:46:16] pool. But God said, "I knew them. I knew
[1:46:20] him before.
[1:46:22] I knew him before you even knew me. I
[1:46:24] knew you and I knew them."
[1:46:27] He knows how to deal with his children.
[1:46:30] And he dealth with us as sons.
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:40] Hallelujah. Glory be to God in the
[1:46:42] highest.
[1:46:43] Hallelujah.
[1:46:45] So you see within this lamp that I have
[1:46:49] posted here, here you have a
[1:46:53] lamp and uh let me find this here for a
[1:46:59] moment. That's big enough I can see
[1:47:03] it. They put the oil in this vessel.
[1:47:07] And here's a wick. You know what that
[1:47:09] wick that wick is a type of the wick is
[1:47:13] a believer.
[1:47:17] I can read the whole quote but I'm not
[1:47:19] going to. The wick is also faith. You
[1:47:22] say how can it be faith and a believer?
[1:47:24] Because it's your faith. Yes. It's you
[1:47:28] believing what God has said. Why do you
[1:47:31] believe? Because you're a believer. Why
[1:47:33] are you a believer? Because you believe.
[1:47:36] Surely we don't have to keep on
[1:47:37] repeating this.
[1:47:40] But we understand this wick. What a
[1:47:42] wonderful place for this wick to be.
[1:47:44] Feel like that song, No Place I'd rather
[1:47:46] be. You know why? Cuz this wick is right
[1:47:48] between the fire and the oil.
[1:47:54] It's got that hidden part on the inside
[1:47:57] that's tapped into the oil.
[1:48:00] Hide thyself in secret, and pray to the
[1:48:03] Father that seeth in secret, and heareth
[1:48:06] in secret, and he that heareth in secret
[1:48:09] shall reward thee openly
[1:48:13] with what? Fire of confirmation.
[1:48:18] Blessed place to be. Our life immersed
[1:48:23] in the Holy Ghost, immersed in Christ.
[1:48:27] Amen. Now, if you try to put any other
[1:48:29] sort of a fiber in there, it will not be
[1:48:32] able to withstand.
[1:48:35] But a wick is ordained
[1:48:38] with special channels
[1:48:41] out of the fabric that it's comprised of
[1:48:45] to be able to pull up oil
[1:48:49] in itself. Hallelujah. So the fire is
[1:48:53] actually manifesting the wick or the oil
[1:48:58] that's in the bottom traveling through
[1:49:00] the wick.
[1:49:02] So you see what it is about your life
[1:49:04] that's manifesting the spirit of God.
[1:49:06] It's the fire. It's God reflecting his
[1:49:11] life through you. Hallelujah. You might
[1:49:13] not be a shoutter. You may not be a
[1:49:15] runner. You may never speak in tongues.
[1:49:17] You may never do none of those things.
[1:49:19] Direct quotes. You may never, but
[1:49:21] there's one thing about it. Your life
[1:49:24] will have changed.
[1:49:28] Amen. Because there is a supernatural
[1:49:31] experience. That's what separates the
[1:49:34] foolish from the wise. The foolish have
[1:49:37] not had the depth of a supernatural
[1:49:40] experience of the new birth.
[1:49:44] And eventually it goes out. Right. So,
[1:49:49] this is why God doesn't want us just
[1:49:50] having camp meeting experiences. That's
[1:49:52] right. That's right. I believe in camp
[1:49:54] meetings. Don't get me wrong. I believe
[1:49:57] I We need them. We need meetings. Oh,
[1:50:01] brother. There's so many meetings for
[1:50:02] our young people. Thank God.
[1:50:05] Meeting here and meeting there. I thank
[1:50:07] God because you know what? And there
[1:50:08] ain't no excuse. Everybody's got
[1:50:09] something locally. Right.
[1:50:12] We need them in this hour. I'm thankful
[1:50:15] to God for that. But you understand when
[1:50:17] we can recognize that whatever that God
[1:50:20] has done there, his desire is to bring
[1:50:22] forth a work in our life to where it's
[1:50:25] not just something that last as long as
[1:50:27] I feel it, but it is a lasting reality
[1:50:31] where the oil has made it down to the
[1:50:33] soul and produced a new birth.
[1:50:38] Without that, you can have the baptism
[1:50:40] of the Holy Ghost every hour of your
[1:50:42] life and be lost and go to hell.
[1:50:46] That's the mystery of the baptism of the
[1:50:49] Holy Ghost.
[1:50:51] Because the rain falls on the just and
[1:50:53] unjust.
[1:50:55] Remember, Brother Bram said, "It'll make
[1:50:57] a calabar shout just like a wheat."
[1:50:59] Right?
[1:51:01] It'll make them rejoice just like a
[1:51:02] wheat. Now, I know you you we we
[1:51:06] understand here. You you you've been
[1:51:07] taught I you you understand that. Oh
[1:51:10] well, if we rejoice because sometimes
[1:51:12] sometimes people get in quotes and they
[1:51:14] get over on things and they want to so
[1:51:16] intellectualize and sterilize the gospel
[1:51:21] and take all the emotion out of the
[1:51:23] church. Now I got it. I got quotes on
[1:51:25] all on the side both sides. But you got
[1:51:27] to be balanced in what you're doing. I
[1:51:30] don't care what anybody else does.
[1:51:32] Listen, let me just tell you something.
[1:51:33] I'm not on streaming people's things and
[1:51:35] finding out what other people are doing
[1:51:36] because you know what? God didn't send
[1:51:37] me to correct nobody else. I don't care
[1:51:40] what they're doing. God has sent me a
[1:51:42] responsibility for this group right
[1:51:44] here. And I'm telling you, as for me and
[1:51:47] my house, we're going to serve the Lord.
[1:51:50] [Applause]
[1:51:52] Hallelujah. Nobody makes me get happy.
[1:51:55] Nobody pumps me up. God made me how he
[1:51:58] made me. He might have made you
[1:51:59] different, but you know what? However
[1:52:02] God made you, that's fine. But don't get
[1:52:04] on me how God's made me.
[1:52:06] Come on. Everything, like Paul said,
[1:52:08] done decently and orderly. We We
[1:52:10] understand that. We've been taught.
[1:52:11] We've been going through those things.
[1:52:13] But to understand within all of this,
[1:52:16] there is something that so strikes our
[1:52:17] heart with this oil. We want that fire
[1:52:22] of confirmation
[1:52:24] living out through our life. This is why
[1:52:28] the prophet as he would say it just like
[1:52:30] this he would
[1:52:31] say Jesus sent the Holy Spirit which is
[1:52:34] himself this is out of conflict between
[1:52:36] God and Satan to get in those that's
[1:52:38] behind the word to confirm the word
[1:52:40] before them to show that he's still the
[1:52:43] word. Yes. He said you've t you've seen
[1:52:45] that taking place. He said right here
[1:52:46] talking to the tabernacle fire. Aren't
[1:52:48] you glad he's come before your tent
[1:52:50] door? Amen. It's not about the nerve
[1:52:53] centers. He's come to your tent door.
[1:52:56] This message was not an Amazon oops.
[1:52:59] That's right.
[1:53:01] Okay.
[1:53:02] It wasn't a UPS. Order it today, get it
[1:53:05] two weeks later. This was not an oops.
[1:53:09] God didn't make a mistake. That's right.
[1:53:11] He sent it to you. And if he sent it to
[1:53:14] you, let me just tell you something.
[1:53:16] It's not because he's got confidence in
[1:53:18] your flesh. That's right. He did not
[1:53:20] send it to you because of our flesh. He
[1:53:23] sent it to us because there is a part of
[1:53:26] himself on the inside that needed to be
[1:53:29] awakened by the voice of the bridegroom,
[1:53:32] our shepherd and bishop of our soul.
[1:53:37] That's what the opening of this word has
[1:53:39] done. It has loosed those seven
[1:53:41] thunders. It's loosened God's voice to
[1:53:44] your life.
[1:53:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:52] Hallelujah. And fire is the confirmation
[1:53:55] of the light coming from the word. Oh,
[1:53:58] that smart virgin, the wise virgin had
[1:54:00] oil in her lamp. She trimmed her lamp
[1:54:02] and lit it. God is the word. The holy
[1:54:05] the oil is the spirit and the fire is
[1:54:08] the gospel light on that oil. Remember
[1:54:10] remember how many right now you probably
[1:54:11] got it going through your mind. It is
[1:54:13] the rising of the sun. How do we know
[1:54:14] it's
[1:54:15] gasoline? Remember that quote. How do we
[1:54:18] know it's gasoline? Oh, it's it's
[1:54:19] gasoline, brother. It's gasoline. How do
[1:54:21] we know it's gasoline? Put the spark on
[1:54:23] it.
[1:54:26] That's how we know. And what does it do?
[1:54:29] It's fire in the engine. It puts it down
[1:54:31] the road. You see, this is where when
[1:54:33] you look at your life and evaluating the
[1:54:35] Holy Ghost, the fire is that which moves
[1:54:38] you into the word. It ain't so much
[1:54:41] about how your feet go or maybe how how
[1:54:44] you go here. It's about your walk has
[1:54:46] been changed. Amen. You're no longer
[1:54:49] living under the elements of whether it
[1:54:52] rains, whether it's sunny, whether it's
[1:54:54] stormy, whether it's cloudy. You're not
[1:54:56] even living in the inner cord where all
[1:54:59] of a sudden the spirit, the light of the
[1:55:01] candalabra can be blown out. Oh Lord,
[1:55:04] the messenger's been taken. You're
[1:55:06] living in a place to where all of that
[1:55:10] was pointing to a light that actually
[1:55:14] has sent the rest, created the rest, and
[1:55:18] has called you into his marvelous light.
[1:55:24] The light that was the first light to
[1:55:26] strike the earth in the beginning when
[1:55:29] God said, "Let there be light was
[1:55:31] shakina light."
[1:55:33] God's own word. Yeah. Blessed be the
[1:55:36] name of the Lord.
[1:55:39] Oh, he said that fire is the gospel
[1:55:41] light on that oil. The oil is in the
[1:55:43] vessel and the fire burning. It shows
[1:55:45] that it's reflecting the light of what
[1:55:47] the word said. That's the reflection.
[1:55:49] That wise virgin could do that. But that
[1:55:53] foolish virgin was on the outside and
[1:55:55] had no oil. They couldn't reflect
[1:55:58] nothing but just their church, their
[1:56:02] denomination.
[1:56:05] So there's no reflection any deeper
[1:56:07] association. Yes. But the word says the
[1:56:12] word is
[1:56:13] spirit. So the true bride must be
[1:56:16] unified. Same quote by the word. If she
[1:56:19] is a part of Christ, she has to be the
[1:56:22] word of Christ. In order to be the word
[1:56:25] of Christ, you have to be baptized into
[1:56:28] Christ. And when you're in Christ, you
[1:56:31] believe Christ. and Christ is the word.
[1:56:36] Let me read you. Let me let me read you
[1:56:38] here another scripture and then I'm
[1:56:41] going to I'm going to I'm going to pull
[1:56:42] up
[1:56:45] here now. Don't go to lunch on
[1:56:48] me. Stay with
[1:56:51] me. This is where that foolish
[1:56:56] virgin, she had knowledge. Brother
[1:56:59] Brandham even tells us like
[1:57:01] this that it would go over
[1:57:04] her and she doesn't catch what it's all
[1:57:10] about. See the wise, why is the wise
[1:57:15] wise? Because she's ordained to that.
[1:57:19] She didn't make herself wise.
[1:57:22] We can go through scriptures. Rebecca
[1:57:24] didn't make herself Rebecca. Right?
[1:57:26] Esther didn't make herself Esther. Well,
[1:57:29] brother Samuel, she had to act on the
[1:57:30] word that was showing she was part of
[1:57:32] the wise.
[1:57:35] You see the wise, it declares itself,
[1:57:37] right?
[1:57:39] So, all of those parallels have been all
[1:57:41] the way down through the scriptures of
[1:57:42] wise and
[1:57:44] foolish. But this is where the key now
[1:57:46] just just hone in on this. I I'm I'm I'm
[1:57:49] coming down to a close, but this is
[1:57:50] where I want you to really hone. There's
[1:57:52] three the Bible says in 1 John
[1:57:55] 5 and verse 6. This is he that came by
[1:58:00] water and blood, even Jesus Christ, not
[1:58:03] by water only, but by water and blood.
[1:58:06] And it is the spirit that beareth
[1:58:08] witness because the spirit is truth. For
[1:58:10] there are three that bear record in
[1:58:12] heaven, the Father, the Word, and the
[1:58:16] Holy Ghost. And these three are one.
[1:58:20] They're one and the same.
[1:58:23] This is why you can't have the word
[1:58:26] without having the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:28] And you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:58:30] without having the word.
[1:58:33] They're one and the same.
[1:58:35] This is why when John Paul would write
[1:58:38] in Romans 8, Brother Brams asked the
[1:58:40] question, "Brother Bram, is it is there
[1:58:42] is is is it is it possible for a person
[1:58:45] to know that they are a son and daughter
[1:58:46] of God?" Brother Bam said absolutely. He
[1:58:48] quotes Romans 8. When your spirit bears
[1:58:50] witness with his spirit, right? Then you
[1:58:53] know, see, it's bearing witness with the
[1:58:55] word because all of those other things,
[1:58:58] sensations, and all those those all
[1:58:59] those things, listen, they can all come.
[1:59:01] And brother Bram says, I can understand
[1:59:04] how those things, they happen because
[1:59:06] you get close to the Holy Ghost. In
[1:59:09] other words, you get right under you.
[1:59:11] You you get under where there's rain. I
[1:59:13] mean, y'all know where we live right
[1:59:14] here. There's times where all of a
[1:59:15] sudden I can be if I have to run an
[1:59:17] errand, I can drive and be passing
[1:59:18] through South Ammerst and I'm thinking,
[1:59:20] hm, why couldn't I have this rain up
[1:59:22] here where I'm at, my flower pots need
[1:59:25] it? Because I don't feel like going out
[1:59:26] with the garden hose right now. And yet
[1:59:28] they're getting into South Amherst or
[1:59:30] sometimes just a strip right down in
[1:59:31] Ammerst. But you see, when we look at
[1:59:33] it, you get around where the Holy Spirit
[1:59:35] is at, things can
[1:59:38] happen. There can be things that can
[1:59:40] that can actually take place. But
[1:59:43] remember, the goal and the desire of God
[1:59:47] is that it would come down to a real
[1:59:49] relationship,
[1:59:51] not just something that comes upon your
[1:59:53] life and can be lifted. Come upon your
[1:59:56] life and be you say, "How do you know
[1:59:58] it's being lifted?" Look what's being
[1:59:59] lived out of your
[2:00:01] life. If what's being lived out of your
[2:00:03] life, not something you got to force,
[2:00:05] but whatever is being lived out of your
[2:00:07] life will tell you whether the oil has
[2:00:10] made it to the place of sealing. Amen.
[2:00:14] Because if it's not made it to the place
[2:00:15] of sealing, friends, the token is here.
[2:00:20] The Holy Spirit is here to seal your
[2:00:23] vessel this morning. Amen. He's here to
[2:00:26] illuminate and bring us to that place to
[2:00:29] where it doesn't go out,
[2:00:32] but to where it comes to a place of
[2:00:34] where his life coming out of us. Now,
[2:00:35] remember the seed packet? Everybody
[2:00:37] remember the seed packet? When the seed
[2:00:39] starts out, it starts out and it comes
[2:00:41] above the ground. It's so tiny. You have
[2:00:43] to tell every don't let the dogs over
[2:00:45] there. Don't let this step over here.
[2:00:46] Don't let that. But it's coming forth.
[2:00:49] That's right. You see, when the new
[2:00:51] birth starts, it starts very small
[2:00:55] like a little white button.
[2:00:59] But it grows, right? And you know what?
[2:01:02] The way it starts out, it has to have
[2:01:04] that start in order to grow like what it
[2:01:07] looks like on the front of the package.
[2:01:09] And you know why you keep that package?
[2:01:10] Don't you throw that package away. Don't
[2:01:12] you Don't you throw away what God has
[2:01:15] given to you. You keep that. That's what
[2:01:17] this message is setting before you. This
[2:01:20] message is not changing images. And you
[2:01:23] come to church, tomato plant. Then you
[2:01:26] come to church the next week, green
[2:01:27] beans. Then you come to church the next
[2:01:29] week, melons. Yeah. Then you come to
[2:01:31] church the next week and you know it's
[2:01:33] beets. Then you come to church the next
[2:01:35] week, potatoes. Yum. No. No. It's the
[2:01:39] same image. Amen. The same image, listen
[2:01:41] to me, the same image that's being set
[2:01:44] before us, that's what the word is
[2:01:47] doing. It's calling us from where we are
[2:01:50] to where we're to be because we are to
[2:01:53] be conformed not to a man's idea.
[2:02:00] Amen. To the image of Jesus Christ.
[2:02:03] Lord, that is so good.
[2:02:07] These three are one, right? But the
[2:02:09] scripture says there are
[2:02:11] three that bear witness in the earth.
[2:02:14] The spirit, the water, and the blood.
[2:02:17] And these three agree right in one. See,
[2:02:22] justification, sanctification, and the
[2:02:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost to come to
[2:02:28] that place of sealing. Would you stand
[2:02:30] with
[2:02:35] me? I want you to listen. Listen to this
[2:02:41] quote. It's out of adoption part
[2:02:49] four. Brother Graham says the church
[2:02:51] going just as knowing there's 10 virgins
[2:02:54] went out to meet the Lord. All
[2:02:56] sanctified, all holy, every one of them
[2:03:00] sanctified. Five were dilatory. That
[2:03:05] means
[2:03:06] lazy become letting go and ferveny just
[2:03:11] pulled back and let their lights go out.
[2:03:17] Now notice nobody came and blew their
[2:03:19] lights out right they let their lights
[2:03:22] go out
[2:03:24] by being what? Dilatory.
[2:03:27] That's what the foolishness is all about
[2:03:30] is here they are standing in the
[2:03:33] presence of the one who can give them
[2:03:36] the oil the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:39] that they need on their soul
[2:03:42] realm and yet they'll take other things
[2:03:47] rely upon this loving
[2:03:49] God love worship love things love how
[2:03:52] they feel but yet down on the inside
[2:03:55] never really coming to a place of being
[2:03:58] honest with
[2:04:01] themselves. I want to be honest, don't
[2:04:03] you? Listen, friends, if I'm not if
[2:04:05] right here, I just say it like this. If
[2:04:08] I'm not where I need to be right here, I
[2:04:11] want to be I would want God to show me.
[2:04:14] My life is not closed off. I don't walk
[2:04:16] in here and have my life closed off and
[2:04:18] praise God, I've got it all. No, no, no,
[2:04:22] no. As a matter of fact, even when God
[2:04:24] lays things on my heart and I can be
[2:04:26] studying and studying and studying, I
[2:04:28] want my life to be combed through. And I
[2:04:30] pray that even while the word's going
[2:04:32] forth, Lord, comb through me. Yes, Lord.
[2:04:36] You say, where example did you see that?
[2:04:38] Well, I seen it first of all, even in
[2:04:39] the prophets ministry where brother
[2:04:41] Brandham himself could stand right there
[2:04:43] and begin to preach in certain places
[2:04:45] and say, "I realized myself I was
[2:04:48] standing in Balam's shoes."
[2:04:52] because of the miracle lines that had
[2:04:54] been run. See, that's a man I can
[2:04:56] follow. He was honest.
[2:04:59] He was honest. You know why he did that?
[2:05:01] If he didn't do it for nobody else,
[2:05:02] brother Aaron, did it for me. He did it
[2:05:05] for me. You know why God allowed You
[2:05:06] know why God didn't have all these other
[2:05:08] things edited off of tapes and what
[2:05:09] more? You know why God didn't edit out a
[2:05:12] Abraham's life? He did it for me. He did
[2:05:15] it for you. Brother Brham said it just
[2:05:17] like this. He said, "If it had not been
[2:05:18] for that," he said, "I used to wonder
[2:05:20] why did God allow that?" He said, "But
[2:05:23] I've come to find out if God had not
[2:05:25] done that, we would not know God's
[2:05:27] grace."
[2:05:29] Oh, we know God in his saving grace. But
[2:05:31] to think about the grace of God that God
[2:05:34] sometimes in the longsuffering that
[2:05:36] maybe a person or any of our lives,
[2:05:39] listen, maybe have sitting here and and
[2:05:42] things have just been going by and you
[2:05:43] realize at this moment, hey, you know
[2:05:45] what? I need a deeper walk with God. I
[2:05:48] need a deeper walk with God. And
[2:05:49] frankly, every one of us do. But don't
[2:05:51] just come under that place of just
[2:05:53] saying, I need a deeper walk. Evaluate.
[2:05:56] If you know in your life, listen, I'll
[2:05:58] not be ashamed of one person who would
[2:06:00] say, Lord, I need the Holy Ghost. To me,
[2:06:02] I'll be thankful. Say, God, because you
[2:06:04] know why? When you're honest with God,
[2:06:06] God will do. He'll do what he said he
[2:06:09] would do.
[2:06:11] God will absolutely take control of a
[2:06:13] life. You see this? the enemy that wants
[2:06:15] to make us ashamed. What's your pastor
[2:06:17] going to think? Well, let me just go
[2:06:18] ahead and bust that devil's nose. I'll
[2:06:20] tell you what your pastor will think.
[2:06:22] He'll be thankful for the grace of God
[2:06:24] that has reached your life and been able
[2:06:27] to stand there because I'll tell you the
[2:06:29] way that my heart is, I am not leaving
[2:06:32] here without one of you. Hallelujah.
[2:06:35] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. I don't
[2:06:37] care if you disagree with me. I don't
[2:06:39] care. I'm not leaving here without one
[2:06:40] of you. I have been commissioned by God
[2:06:43] to stand here and proclaim this gospel.
[2:06:46] And I've got confidence in it because I
[2:06:48] know what it's done and is doing in my
[2:06:51] life. I know it will achieve
[2:06:54] and I know this right here as well. I
[2:06:56] know this
[2:06:58] that his grace is sufficient
[2:07:01] to where in my foolishness, your
[2:07:04] foolishness, can we fellowship together
[2:07:06] on that? in some of the times where we
[2:07:08] in ourselves foolishness and the spirit
[2:07:12] of God will sweep right back around
[2:07:13] remind us wait a minute you're a wise
[2:07:16] virgin
[2:07:18] he's not pumping us up he's not coming
[2:07:20] to try to pat us on the back he's coming
[2:07:22] to show us wait a minute you're not
[2:07:23] living out to your full potential
[2:07:27] you say brother Samuel what is that does
[2:07:29] that mean that when he comes and says it
[2:07:31] like that that then I'm getting the oil
[2:07:32] on on my soul if you've already had the
[2:07:34] oil on your soul and been born again of
[2:07:36] the spirit of God. Then when the spirit
[2:07:38] of God comes around to deal with your
[2:07:40] life and my life like that, you know
[2:07:41] what that's all about? Trimming the
[2:07:43] lamp. That's right. How many How many
[2:07:46] ever had these old these coal? I mean,
[2:07:48] maybe not looking like this, but I
[2:07:49] remember when we lived down in the
[2:07:50] country down in Salena, man, the
[2:07:52] electricity would go out. We had them,
[2:07:54] you know, those things they sell down
[2:07:55] the Amish stores now, but you know, you
[2:07:57] put the put the oil in there and you got
[2:07:58] the little thing. I mean, it was nothing
[2:08:01] for electricity to go out. We had big
[2:08:02] candles. They weren't for smelling. No.
[2:08:05] No, sir. No, they weren't for smelling.
[2:08:08] Now I love that. But anyhow, those the
[2:08:10] way it was, electricity go out, you'd
[2:08:12] light it. But you know what mom or dad
[2:08:14] would have to do? They'd have to go in
[2:08:15] there on that wick. That wick's
[2:08:18] ordained, brother Brian. It's ordained
[2:08:20] for that to flow through. But
[2:08:22] sometimes from the use
[2:08:25] and then all of a sudden where something
[2:08:27] stops and we blow it out and then the
[2:08:29] use it can get carboned up because
[2:08:32] everything's not getting burned out
[2:08:33] efficiently. All right.
[2:08:36] But I'm so glad that he is trimming
[2:08:39] smoking flax right now.
[2:08:42] This is lamp trimming time. Lord, trim
[2:08:45] everything out of me that's unlike you.
[2:08:48] I don't want my life smoked up. I don't
[2:08:50] want it have to be where somebody's
[2:08:51] looking and wondering, is that a son of
[2:08:53] God? Is that a daughter of God? No.
[2:08:55] We're called the message of the hour is
[2:08:58] a clear display. Jesus Christ the same.
[2:09:02] Amen. Now, let me see through all that
[2:09:05] smoke. Oh, the smoke. We already have to
[2:09:08] battle the smoke of this age. That's
[2:09:10] right. Come on. Revelations chapter 9,
[2:09:14] the smoke of this age is demon powers.
[2:09:17] The lid of hell's been taken off. That's
[2:09:19] right. But Revelations 10:1. And
[2:09:23] I saw another mighty angel.
[2:09:26] [Music]
[2:09:27] Hallelujah. It's smoky for the world,
[2:09:29] but my eyes. Oh, I got my eyes have been
[2:09:33] anointed. They're clear. I'm seeing
[2:09:35] Jesus Christ. I'm seeing the word being
[2:09:38] vindicated. I'm seeing myself. I
[2:09:40] recognize I was always a son and
[2:09:42] daughter of God. I see what the rights
[2:09:44] that belong to me. I realize that the
[2:09:46] Holy Ghost is for me. I realize that I'm
[2:09:49] a part of the rapture. I realize my name
[2:09:51] is on the Lamb's book of life. What's
[2:09:53] happening in the presence of Almighty
[2:09:56] God? The smoke is being lifted.
[2:10:00] lamps are being trimmed
[2:10:04] in his presence.
[2:10:06] And the Pentecostal fire we see is just
[2:10:09] as real as it was when it fell on the
[2:10:13] day of Pentecost.
[2:10:15] You say, "How is that?" That is your
[2:10:17] life. My life. I'm looking at paradoxes.
[2:10:22] Amen. Miracles.
[2:10:25] Don't you love him?
[2:10:27] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:30] Let this not be our part
[2:10:34] becoming dilatory
[2:10:37] or coming to where just letting the oil
[2:10:41] run out because if it's not in the soul
[2:10:44] it can run out but the new birth is the
[2:10:47] seal.
[2:10:49] Now you might say well brother Samuel
[2:10:51] how do I know that it's made it there?
[2:10:53] That's a good question. It's a good
[2:10:57] question because once the new birth has
[2:11:00] come, it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:11:03] to you personally. And once that has
[2:11:05] come, you can look back to what you
[2:11:08] were, your desires. Amen. Your nature,
[2:11:12] the things that you once loved, and you
[2:11:15] look in your life now and say, "Not only
[2:11:19] do I not do those things, I hate those
[2:11:21] things. Hallelujah. But I love him.
[2:11:25] Hallelujah. Amen. Though he slay me, I
[2:11:28] serve him. I love him. I've failed him
[2:11:32] many times, but I love him. Why? Because
[2:11:35] he first loved me.
[2:11:38] Don't you love him?
[2:11:41] I say here this morning, if it's not
[2:11:43] made it to that place, why don't you be
[2:11:45] honest with God and say,
[2:11:48] "Lord, I want that oil." Amen. in the
[2:11:51] depths of my soul. Hallelujah. I want
[2:11:55] that earnest, Lord. I want that seal. I
[2:11:58] want that that that confirmation. Don't
[2:12:00] look for like the prophet tells us at
[2:12:02] the end of invisible union. He said,
[2:12:04] "Don't look for anything anything
[2:12:07] outside of a truth in your life.
[2:12:12] Let God prove it." Is that all right?
[2:12:15] Let God prove it.
[2:12:17] things that want to come around right
[2:12:18] now and try to bring fear. That's not
[2:12:20] the spirit of God. The spirit of God
[2:12:21] does not come to bring fear because you
[2:12:23] do not even approach him for the Holy
[2:12:25] Ghost with fear. It's with faith. Every
[2:12:28] promise of God and even for God to
[2:12:31] settle you and even to
[2:12:33] reveal perhaps that's already there in
[2:12:36] your life and God really wants to settle
[2:12:38] you so he can start using you even more.
[2:12:42] Amen. to where you're not even you're no
[2:12:44] longer wrestling with am I worthy is my
[2:12:47] ability. Why don't you let God prove his
[2:12:49] word?
[2:12:51] You love him.
[2:12:53] Hallelujah. I tell you friends, I thank
[2:12:56] God for this message.
[2:13:03] I'm not lifting up a man. When I say
[2:13:06] this message, I'm talking about Jesus
[2:13:08] Christ.
[2:13:11] I know what I was and I know what I am.
[2:13:15] Amen. He's everything to me. Oh, he's
[2:13:19] had to correct me a lot.
[2:13:22] But I'm so glad he did. I'm thankful for
[2:13:25] every weapon he's given me. I'm thankful
[2:13:27] for every correction. I'm thankful for
[2:13:29] every test and every trial he's allowed
[2:13:31] to come my way. And most importantly,
[2:13:33] I'm glad for his grace that has
[2:13:35] accompanied me through every test. and
[2:13:38] every trial. I'm grateful for his grace
[2:13:41] that has been given that my own
[2:13:44] stubbornness could be surrendered to him
[2:13:46] time and time again.
[2:13:50] Thank you, Lord. Thank God for his
[2:13:52] mercy.
[2:14:06] God have come today to give you
[2:14:10] praise. I have come
[2:14:13] today to lift you up so you don't have
[2:14:17] no
[2:14:18] fear. So you will
[2:14:21] overcome. I give you strength today for
[2:14:25] this
[2:14:27] word. Let your life grow and not
[2:14:33] be it.
[2:14:36] Let it come up
[2:14:40] higher.
[2:14:42] So the people will see that light
[2:14:46] shine. They will see the light
[2:14:48] shine because I'm
[2:14:52] there. I am there with you. I
[2:14:59] am speaking to
[2:15:02] you. Do not be afraid.
[2:15:12] Don't let anything come and tell you
[2:15:14] that this
[2:15:20] is for I'm going to be with
[2:15:27] you.
[2:15:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:15:36] Let's bow our heads. Thank you, Lord.
[2:15:38] Let's bow our
[2:15:40] heads. Wonders every eyes closed and our
[2:15:49] hearts. I want us just to really just
[2:15:52] take a
[2:15:53] moment and just to
[2:15:57] reflect. This might might be just one
[2:15:59] person that's here. I don't know. But
[2:16:01] God knows. Maybe there's even someone
[2:16:04] across the internet streaming or one
[2:16:08] that'll go back and archive it. I don't
[2:16:12] know. But I do know this. I certainly
[2:16:16] would want to give you an
[2:16:19] invitation that in your life if you know
[2:16:21] that it hasn't come to that place yet.
[2:16:24] And I don't want I'm not looking for a
[2:16:26] reaction out of you, please understand
[2:16:28] that. I just want you to be honest in
[2:16:30] his
[2:16:31] presence because I want I want you to
[2:16:34] have what God wants you to have. Amen.
[2:16:38] Lord, I don't want the
[2:16:40] enemy to keep you from it or hold you
[2:16:43] back from what God has for you.
[2:16:47] I wonder in his presence if you just
[2:16:49] wouldn't want to raise your hand
[2:16:52] or maybe you'd want to come and stand up
[2:16:56] here. You say, "Lord, I I want you more
[2:16:59] than anything.
[2:17:01] Lord Jesus, I want the spirit of God to
[2:17:04] go deeper, Lord, in my life." That don't
[2:17:06] mean That don't mean that you don't have
[2:17:08] it, but maybe you don't have it, but you
[2:17:11] realize I need it so it don't run out.
[2:17:14] Hallelujah. I need I need something,
[2:17:16] Lord, in my life that's just not a week
[2:17:19] long,
[2:17:20] monthlong, season long. I need I need
[2:17:23] you. I need I need that which is an
[2:17:26] endless supply from my soul, Lord.
[2:17:32] Well, brother Samuel, I I'm ashamed
[2:17:34] ashamed. Don't be ashamed of him. He
[2:17:36] said, if you're ashamed of him and his
[2:17:37] words, he'll be ashamed of you.
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:41] But why don't you just take God at his
[2:17:43] word? Every every head is bowed, every
[2:17:44] eyes closed. Why don't you take God at
[2:17:46] his word and say,
[2:17:50] "Lord, Satan, let me put you on notice.
[2:17:53] You're a liar. Right. Amen.
[2:17:57] Tell these people or person as though
[2:18:01] they'll never receive it. They'll never
[2:18:02] have it. It's never for them. You're a
[2:18:04] liar. And in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:09] Hold your peace and leave.
[2:18:13] Hallelujah. Glory to God. I'm going to
[2:18:15] give you an instruction. The prophet,
[2:18:17] every head is bowed still. I'm going to
[2:18:18] give you an instruction. The prophet
[2:18:19] said, "I want you right now." He said to
[2:18:22] take every thought of
[2:18:25] doubt and I want you to put it on the
[2:18:28] floor and put your foot on it.
[2:18:31] Hallelujah. I'm asking you right now,
[2:18:33] take the thought. You might have to act
[2:18:35] it out. Take the thoughts of doubt and
[2:18:38] all the thoughts of oh but maybe
[2:18:40] thoughts of how could I have been in a
[2:18:43] place of foolishness. Take it right now
[2:18:46] and place it on the floor and put your
[2:18:48] foot on it. Amen. Every doubt I place my
[2:18:53] foot on it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:18:56] Hallelujah. I believe he's here. Amen.
[2:19:00] Hallelujah. I know he's here. Glory be
[2:19:03] to God. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is
[2:19:06] here. Yes, he is. Hallelujah.
[2:19:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:19:11] You want to receive it here this
[2:19:12] morning? He's here. He's here. Glory.
[2:19:17] Hallelujah.
[2:19:19] How many say, "Lord, that's what I want
[2:19:22] down in the depths of my soul."
[2:19:26] Hallelujah. Lord, I want a refilling. I
[2:19:29] want a refilling.
[2:19:31] Which, Lord, would be equivalent like
[2:19:33] that to a lamp
[2:19:35] trimming, Lord. Where things are trimmed
[2:19:38] out where it gets all carboned up. We
[2:19:40] don't mean to, but sometimes, Lord,
[2:19:42] through the cares and the affairs of
[2:19:45] life, but oh God, you're passing through
[2:19:48] this building this morning. It's lamp
[2:19:51] trimming hour, Lord, where hearts have
[2:19:52] come to a place to say, "I don't care
[2:19:54] about fashions no longer. I don't care
[2:19:56] about this and I don't care about that.
[2:19:58] The things that I've once cared about, I
[2:20:01] realize it's only a mirage." Hallelujah.
[2:20:04] It doesn't satisfy. It doesn't keep me.
[2:20:07] It's from one to the next to the next.
[2:20:09] But
[2:20:11] Lord, you're my satisfying portion.
[2:20:15] That's what I want, Lord. I want that
[2:20:16] satisfied portion, Lord.
[2:20:20] Heavenly
[2:20:21] Father, Lord God, I lift this
[2:20:23] congregation, Lord, up before your
[2:20:25] throne in prayer.
[2:20:27] every single need, Lord, that's been
[2:20:29] gathered here, hands that's been lifted,
[2:20:31] Lord, from hearts, Lord God, that Lord,
[2:20:34] with a desire to see the moment that
[2:20:37] we're living in,
[2:20:39] Lord, it's a moment to think
[2:20:43] soberly. You told us, be
[2:20:47] sober, watch, and
[2:20:50] pray. Lord, it's an hour where there's
[2:20:54] all kinds of intoxicating things around
[2:20:56] us,
[2:20:58] Lord. Media
[2:21:00] saturation,
[2:21:02] bombardment. Oh, that
[2:21:05] wine of fornication that's poured out
[2:21:08] from Babylon.
[2:21:10] Lord God, to appease the flesh, to
[2:21:13] appease the mind, Lord God, deadening
[2:21:17] people until they're Lord becoming numb
[2:21:20] like those who watch the animals walk by
[2:21:24] and get in Noah's ark. Oh God,
[2:21:29] Lord Jesus, glory, I want to say thank
[2:21:32] you for your mercy.
[2:21:35] Thank you for your mercy this morning,
[2:21:37] Lord, once
[2:21:38] again. And Lord, I want to say thank
[2:21:42] you for hearts
[2:21:46] that Lord to be honest before you. There
[2:21:49] is no big eyes and little use here among
[2:21:51] us.
[2:21:53] No. No. Lord, we're here. I want to see
[2:21:57] everyone make it.
[2:22:00] I do not study. I do not give myself to
[2:22:04] you to single out. I give myself to you
[2:22:07] with Lord God. You've called me to
[2:22:09] preach
[2:22:11] it and this word will produce. Amen.
[2:22:15] Lord God, this word, it'll take
[2:22:18] situations that are thought to be
[2:22:20] impossible.
[2:22:23] It can take strains that's made its way
[2:22:25] down and had a hold upon lives for
[2:22:28] generations. But the blessing of God can
[2:22:31] break the curse around the life, Lord.
[2:22:34] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:22:36] That's what the new birth has come to
[2:22:38] do, Lord. It ties us back into you
[2:22:41] fully, Lord. To where we're no longer
[2:22:43] walking under the Lord, the the the
[2:22:46] headship of our family tree. We're
[2:22:48] walking under the headship of the tree
[2:22:51] of life. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:22:58] Oh, hallelujah. Lord Jesus, right here
[2:23:02] this morning, Lord, Father, for those
[2:23:05] hearts, God, bless them, Lord, in their
[2:23:09] honesty, Lord, and before you to say,
[2:23:12] God, I want that oil, Lord, in the
[2:23:15] depths of my
[2:23:17] life. I've had it upon my spirit, oh my,
[2:23:20] it makes me feel good. But I realize
[2:23:23] that there's a leakage
[2:23:25] problem. It leaks out.
[2:23:29] But I hear that there is a seal. There's
[2:23:32] a place that that oil can come to in my
[2:23:34] life, Lord. And it's a place that you
[2:23:37] provided for yourself. You've already
[2:23:39] put it there because you're Jehovah
[2:23:42] Gyra. All you desire is that I would
[2:23:45] surrender, Lord Jesus. Grant that this
[2:23:48] morning, Lord. Granted, Lord God, to
[2:23:51] where the Holy Spirit, Lord, may you
[2:23:53] come like you did into Solomon's temple.
[2:23:55] You walked right down, Lord God, right
[2:23:57] through the corridors and you led that
[2:23:59] word right to its place. It became so
[2:24:02] smoky, Lord, to where the ministers
[2:24:04] could not even minister. May you come,
[2:24:06] Lord, in such a way like that once again
[2:24:08] to where there's no doubts that can
[2:24:10] arise Lord God. There's no other voice
[2:24:12] that can be spoken Lord God in doubt
[2:24:15] Lord God in confusion Lord but where the
[2:24:18] word has come to its resting place Lord
[2:24:21] and the shakina light there's a
[2:24:24] reflection of Jesus Christ where is it
[2:24:27] one time ye were darkness but now are
[2:24:31] you light in the Lord
[2:24:34] arise and shine for thy light has come
[2:24:38] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:24:40] thee
[2:24:42] Lord
[2:24:43] Jesus, I also pray and I ask you forgive
[2:24:48] us. Forgive me and forgive Lord others.
[2:24:53] My brothers and sisters, forgive us for
[2:24:56] acting foolish.
[2:24:58] Lord, allowing Lord other things and
[2:25:00] kind of becoming Lord kind of dilatory,
[2:25:03] not really not caring as much. Lord
[2:25:06] Jesus, forgive us, Lord. Yes, Lord. I
[2:25:09] know that you're mindful that we are but
[2:25:11] flesh, but I'm so glad that you come by
[2:25:13] our way, Lord, and you remind
[2:25:16] us the high calling that we're called
[2:25:18] to. Amen. And it's something within us,
[2:25:21] Lord.
[2:25:23] That's why I ask you to forgive me.
[2:25:26] Forgive me, Lord, when I've been
[2:25:28] dilatory. Forgive me. But Lord, I could
[2:25:32] have prayed more, could have read more,
[2:25:35] could have went more, could have did
[2:25:36] more. Forgive me Lord. Forgive me Lord
[2:25:40] for being dilatory Lord when maybe my
[2:25:43] attitude or my actions. Oh
[2:25:46] God. God I'm asking Lord not only for
[2:25:49] myself but this entire congregation.
[2:25:53] Granted Lord I pray God a real
[2:25:55] refreshing from the presence of God. A
[2:25:58] refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord God
[2:26:01] that would come Lord into hearts and
[2:26:03] lives Lord. A fresh Lord.
[2:26:06] Renew us, Lord. I
[2:26:09] pray, oh
[2:26:11] Lord, to where the wick, the
[2:26:14] predestinated fibers of our
[2:26:18] lives, Lord God, to where that wick
[2:26:20] might be
[2:26:22] trimmed to where the
[2:26:25] wick will pull and
[2:26:27] draw that oil from that that hidden
[2:26:31] place. Glory be to God. Glory be to God.
[2:26:35] and the fire burning declaring there's
[2:26:38] oil in this
[2:26:41] vessel. We love you, Lord.
[2:26:44] Father, I thank you for every emotion. I
[2:26:46] thank you for every sensation. And I'm
[2:26:48] so thankful that Lord, you bring us to a
[2:26:50] place to realize there's nothing wrong
[2:26:53] with emotion, nothing wrong with
[2:26:54] sensation, but I'm so grateful you
[2:26:57] brought us to a place where we can rest
[2:26:59] on the word of God. And when we get to
[2:27:01] really resting on the word of God, Lord,
[2:27:04] that's when at times we can really turn
[2:27:05] loose.
[2:27:07] Oh, hallelujah. That's when joy rises
[2:27:11] from within this vessel, Lord God, to
