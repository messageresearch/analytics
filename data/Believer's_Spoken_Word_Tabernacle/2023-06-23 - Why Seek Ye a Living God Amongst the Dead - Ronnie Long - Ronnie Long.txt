instruments and Lord the pews and the the sound and Lord we thank you for all this Lord but most of all father we thank you for your presence that's that's here with us father Lord you promise that you be with us father you'd never leave us nor forsake us and that's the greatest words that we could hold on to fathers and Assurance to know that wherever wherever we come and gather in your name father there you would be and Lord your Prophet taught us that you accompany this message always father are are our only eye is to keep this this word that you've given us father in full view Lord that we could just move further into it father we just ask that you be with us our our time here father that you bless each one that's made the effort and those that would like to be and couldn't be father we ask that you bless them Father Lord as we just for a few moments just look into your holy word we just ask that you would bring anointing upon it father Lord that you speak life out of it father for Lord is the only source we have to go to Lord your word is our is our source of healing it's our source of Joy our source of love father it's it's all that we have in this hour Lord and we ask that you would just come by our way one more time Lord You're the faithful one and we trust in you father in the name of Jesus Christ may you bless this service amen amen thank you for the songs that are sung if you have your Bibles turn to the Book of Luke the 24th chapter amen trust everybody's been well I don't know uh maybe been a little bit uh since we've been here but we think of you often and sure love this church and the assembly thankful for one day we won't have to park right we can just continue that Fellowship we've got a little taste of it though this weekend with the boys up in Indiana some good boys man they're just good boys appreciate the Browning boys amen we prayers are with our pastor she's in uh Australia he's in good hands we were there last year at that camp me and brother Nathan and we just had a wonderful time in the Lord and just wonderful people Desiring a god with skin on him and this message to be more than just words but and and the Lord did some some awesome things last year and I believe he's just gonna build it and build it and we'll hear some tremendous testimonies of what the Lord's going to do this year there I told Brother Samuel I was messaging him I said my only regret is that I'm not with you he said man I wish you were with me too but maybe next year Luke the 24th chapter in the first verse now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the Sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them and they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulcher and they entered in and found not the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed there about behold two men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the Earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the Dead he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remembered his words and returned from the Sepulcher and told all these things into the eleven and to all the rest it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with him was told these things unto the apostles and their words seemed to them as Idol tales and they believed them not amen may God bless his word tonight you may be seated I uh get in my way praise the Lord but we we find this familiar text here uh that we would we would hear probably most on the Easter message or something to that effect of of them coming to the Sepulcher but we just want to for a few minutes I don't want to take too much time but for a few minutes just speak on this subject of why seek ye a living God amongst the Dead and we find here in this text that that these were Faithful Servants of the Lord that came came to where he last was expecting to find him and they came to do him a service expecting where they last saw him but he wasn't he wasn't there and a lot of people will go to church and they will go through their traditions and they will go about their regular day-to-day and expect to find God where they last saw him but God's never standing in one place God's always on the Move he's always he's always moving forward he's only got one One Direction and that's forward and so he's always on the move and they they came to him out of good hearts and they came to him wanting to do him a service but they came looking for him in the wrong place I think that if they would have listened to what he said they would have realized he wouldn't have been there because he told them if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up right so he already told him I'm not going to be here when you come to look for me so don't look for me in a cemetery but look for me out walking and talking among men in flesh and so they find themselves wanting to do God a service and you know we we put ourselves a little bit in their shoes that they found that they're the one that they believed was the Messiah they watched him get crucified and they watched him get beaten and bruised and I just the sight that they must have seen and and just shaking you know just shaking to see that take place and and they just wanted to to bring some anointing and some and some spices to his body and they wanted to go do a service for him and I think that's how many hearted people are they just want to do a service for the Lord I think anybody that's sitting in the church anywhere around the world they would say I just want to do something for the Lord I want to do something uh that would be pleasing unto him but we've got to recognize where he's at to do this service for him thank God we have a true word in this hour that tells us exactly where he's at in this age and how to approach him and the only way to approach him that we can do a service for him I thank God that we're not just a Wandering church and tradition wondering where he's at but we know exactly where he's at and we know exactly how to approach him thank God tonight I believe that the services are just the way that the prophet said was pleasing unto the Lord we sing songs and we worshiped him to the Lord and we gave our part and our offering and he's made a promise that he would come and he would be here with us and I believe he keeps his word every time and I believe he's here in our midst because we followed uh not our tradition but out of belief that he honors his program right and so they find themselves going to look for God according to their program and they should have known he's not among dead things he's life right and life and death cannot dwell together you can't have one and the other together in the same place but it's either death or it's life and so they go look for him in a cemetery and they find that the Stone's already been rolled away and they find that he's not in there and of course we're every Christian's familiar with the story of Resurrection but where are we in this story and so these Faithful Servants come to come to the tomb and they find two angels there right and there's two angels and Shining garments they say he's not here but he's already risen and so there's two angels that are are to be to the cemetery right they were already in the cemetery but there was a third Angel already on the earth that was walking on the road to Emmaus and that's the angel that we're looking for right that's the office of God that we want to be with we're not in the cemetery we're looking for the Melchizedek right we're not looking for the two angels to Sodom we're Abraham and we're looking for Melchizedek right so they came to the Sepulcher looking for him and those two angels told him hey you're called to be higher he's not here but he's risen over there he's talking with the disciples even now he's walking with him and they found themselves uh in in disbelief the Bible says they were perplexed which is which is baffled or extremely puzzled that that he wasn't in there but yet they heard where he would be and when it came time to find him they were surprised that they were he wasn't where they thought he'd be they were surprised to say that he that to see that he actually keeps his word and he's walking and talking and he came out of the Tomb and he's no longer bound in those grave clothes but he's out walking I could just put myself in their shoes thinking well I watched I watched them carry his body in here I watched them roll away the stone and I I thought there'd be no way when I came here and the stones rolled away I thought well where's the Lord it seems like they've lost him we lost track of where the Lord is and I think religion today has lost track of where the Lord is they put it all in the in the buildings and in the chandeliers and in the in the in the fanciness of the world or they put it into into the the treasury Department of their church or they put it in all other things but they've lost sight of where the Lord is today but thank God we have a revelation in this hour that we know exactly where he's at today he's not a far out somewhere but he's here in a living assembly a living place where we are alive and made well it's the Breath of God in us that makes us live right it's the Breath of God that in us that that we can even be here today and it's him it's testifying of his power in our life it's him it's it's God but why would we look for him somewhere else why would we look for him in theology or in in uh in a man-made book but we've got to look in his book to know where he's at and so to build a foundation here we're not looking at a dead God we're looking at an alive God we don't want a dead God we want an alive God the religions all over the world serving dead God that they're waiting for some action to happen right we could go to the muhammadans and they're waiting for the resurrection of their prophet and they're waiting for something right and they're waiting for that God to rise up and we go to another place and uh I've been to India and they're they're waiting for the cycle of their godship to come around so they can be at another level when they come back you know and it's a sad thing there because they don't even recognize the value of a of a human soul they they put it somehow lower than an animal or you know if you come and you're a human but you're a beggar or per person you're less than than the the pig or the cow or the or the ant and then you come back again and you know the highest order of that of that life cycle there is a priest in India and I wonder who wrote that law who wrote the law that a priesthood would be the highest when the Bible says the exact opposite that the priests are servants unto men and we're to be the lowest among all of them and we're to serve men with all our life right so they've they've perverted God's word and to say if you just keep waiting and look at the cycle of death that they're in that they're waiting to come back again and come back again the muhammadas are waiting for for him to come back again but thank God we serve a resurrected Christ that has already come back again and he's not to die again but he's alive and well and living among men to do the same works that he did when he was already here right thank God we're not just wondering if we one day he's going to come back or one day there's going to be a Revival or one day there's going to be we live in the age where all things are revealed all things are open unto us the word is open unto us the Revival is open unto us Christ is alive in us we're not waiting for it it's right now so we're not looking for something to come it's already come Elias has already come amongst the bride and is doing the same works that he did back then I believe we make of that part of the body where God is performing his word the same way by the same results by the same power through the same word in US we're not looking for him out there in the cemetery but Jeremiah was saying but the Lord is the true God he is the Living God somebody say Living God and an everlasting King at his wrath the Earth shall tremble and the nation shall not be able to abide his indignation he's the Living God not a god of history but a living God Amen brother man was saying on that Resurrection Resurrection Morning Glory Hallelujah Matthew the great writer after he was resurrected from the dead the Old Testament Saints and many of those that slept in the dust of the Earth come up out of the grave and entered into the City and appeared unto many that quickening power still on them bones of Elijah when there wasn't no more bones still on job there wasn't a spoonful of dust left of his body but the quickening power was still there so we find that that life is not just our body or it's not just necessarily the breath but it's a quickening power job was what 4 000 years before this 3 000 years before this there wasn't a spoonful of his body left brother Brian but there was a quickening power upon him that he knew that a redeemer would come he knew that there would be a resurrection that would come and it didn't matter if he went by the grave or by the sea or by the fire or whatever happened to his literal body but that quickening power that was within him would be resurrected you would not find job in a cemetery you would find him waiting for the resurrection to be called that his name could come forth and I believe any bride member that's gone on before us is waiting the same place that Joe was waiting that their name could be called and it doesn't matter what happened to their literal body or these bones or just dust put together but where is the spirit of that quickening power laying it's waiting for us the voice of the Resurrection to call forward that the resurrection could come again so the same Works being done by the same word through this bride what he did you shall do also he called on a resurrection we call on a resurrection he called on the saints that had passed before we will call on the saints that have passed before that quickening power still holds even on a spoonful of dust when their name is called that quickening power responds in its resurrection power again and I believe we're not waiting for it to come but it's here right now I believe just any moment any morning I believe that that voice will be wrong and I believe it'll be recognized and I believe the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is back in the church and they will say it's time for the resurrection to come on and I believe we'll see loved ones walk through the door and I believe there'll be knocks at the door and I believe those that have gone on before us will come back and say it's time you called it I'm here I believe that's what happened when Lazarus was passed on and Jesus came to his tomb and he called him brother bam said he called him by name otherwise there would have been a whole Resurrection take place but he had to call him by his name Lazarus come forth and he came out out of the grave and I I believe it looks something like this where Lazarus went down to the Grave he was already dead his body had already sunken in and he was there fellowshipping with the Saints in Paradise that had already passed on before and he's having a conversation with those that have passed on and he's talking to Ezekiel and Isaiah and all the great prophets that had passed on he's saying there's a there's a redeemer on the earth now if he's he's here and if he's here it means it's just a matter of time and we'll be resurrected he began to have a testimony service on the other side and I believe he began to witness the power of Jesus Christ because they knew there was one coming Isaiah had seen it and it testified about it but Lazarus went down as an eyewitness to say he's here he's here he's walking and talking he's walking on the earth even now the Miracles he's performing the countenance of God all around him his glory has come to Earth again and I believe as he began to give that testimony there was an old an old man come up from the back and I believe he said what's that now you say that he's here he said yeah the the Redeemer is here he said glory to God I saw him I saw him thousands of years ago I said I know my redeemer will live you mean to tell me that the time is now that he's here Lazarus said oh yes he's here right about that time I believe the voice rang through the eternities and it said Lazarus come forth my with that Lazarus disappeared back but what was taking place in Paradise there was an Earnest expectation in those saints that had gone on before to say he's walking on the Earth in just a few days job's name would be called in the resurrection and he would walk again knowing his Redeemer in the power of his resurrection I believe we're just a couple days away now I believe the saints that have gone on here from us are testifying the the opening of the word is here Christ is on the earth the Miracles those signs that he did he's doing again I believe just in a few minutes the resurrection will be on I believe that's the that's the hope that's the faith of the Bride in this hour that we're not facing death but we're just a nether phase into another Journey those that have passed on before are not in death they're just waiting for their name to be called they're just sleeping waiting waiting what are they waiting for you and I to come to a position in the word that they without us cannot be made perfect they cannot continue on into their Journey without us they'll walk back through that door said I waited for you to call I waited for you to call my name and the power of the church in this hour is ready for the anointing of God to say all things are made ready now let the Resurrection come the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride it's in her mouth under her messenger she is the final voice to the final age that she can be the restoration of all things it's Christ in her the same resurrection power right it's that quickening power that comes upon Him Romans 8 was saying if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also somebody say also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you if brother Graham says if that same spirit so there's one thing that we need to make sure of while we still have breath in our lungs it's that that same Spirit also dwells in us the same resurrection power also dwells in us so we don't want to leave that to chance or to wonder but let it be known that that same Spirit somebody say also dwells in us the same resurrection power that quickened him from the dead shall also Quicken us now remember we're not looking for a dead God in a cemetery somewhere so it's nice to go remember our loved ones and we just passed the anniversary of some passing of our loved ones and go to the grave and pay our respects and it's something to do out of memory but they're not there that's not where they are that people come from all over the world to come visit the the graveside of brother Branham to maybe get some dirt or get some anointing from it he's not even in there if they knew what he said they would not come looking for him there they would know that the same spirit that was in him is alive and well it's all also quickening our mortal bodies to get alive in this word that is what opens our eyes to a resurrection power in this age is the same spirit that Christ went down with is the same spirit that he resurrected with will open our eyes in this word and Jesus answering said unto them suffer it to be so now for it becoming somebody say us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him then it becometh us to fulfill our righteousness so now we have a responsibility to play we've got a part to play in this it becometh us so no longer is it just a Christ of yesterday but it's the Christ of today and where is he he's not in a tomb he's not he's not somewhere back away but he said I will be with you even in you right now Brother Band will break this down really simply uh in uh in putting on the whole armor of God he would say it's God over us God With Us God in us and then he says ye are gods so that's a real powerful Revelation in just a few words God over us God With Us God in us ye are Gods the same resurrection power that was in him is also in you so why would we seek a living power amongst the dead tradition why would we want to blend in with another church or blend in with a denomination or blend in with the rest of the world when we're not of the world we're of another world another kingdom that we are called to be a resurrected power right now not waiting those of us that still have breath in our lungs are not waiting for it we are it we're the resurrection of the word in this hour it's not coming it's here right we've gone to do a service for the king but we've got to know where he's at and so when they come they come back from from this from this Revelation that they've had they come back to share it with the other believers that so they think that they're thinking you're gonna love this you're gonna love what I have to bring to you he's not in a tomb but it's open right and they say they're telling idle Tales well no that can't be we watched the tomb roll and you know that was only for the or that was only for Christ to fulfill I can't it can't be that he's alive somebody must have taken his body somebody must have stole his body and you know it just can't be now these are so-called Believers right these women are coming back and they're telling what they have seen with their own eyes and they're meeting results of you're just telling an idle tale you're just telling a a tall tale you're telling something false you know you're painting a big story you're trying to get our hope up and I believe that's what the devil has attacked a church with in this hour that a Ministry would come and it would try to encourage our faith and say you know the word is not back in yesterday but the word is alive today and brother Branham encountered those same spirits to say the days of Miracles are past and you say no they're not they're alive and well today but us in the church today are encountering the same exact opposition when we come and say the words open it's out amongst us we're in a resurrection we're in a Revival this is the bride's Revival and they would look at you and say well you're just telling an idle Tale But I know what I've seen and I know what I've experienced and there's no way you can take that away from me the tomb is open unto me it might not be open up to everybody but it's open unto me and as for me I've seen a resurrected Christ that's not letting down waiting for something but he's on the Move in this age you know and we'll go into a service and no doubt brother Samuel will be in a powerful anointing this weekend and the Lord will use him in a mighty way but there's always a spirit of criticism that comes when you tell people to take God at his word and that Spirit of criticism will come and maybe many of you don't feel it but the minister feels it that you're just trying to falsely lead the people on and you're getting their hopes up well if I was getting your hopes up into me I would have something wrong with me if I was saying by my power and what I can do for you and you can walk here free I would be getting your hopes up into a cunning Fable and I don't tell but that's not what we're doing under this message under this anointing it's not about us it's not about a prophet it's not about a book or it's not about under understanding with your own intellect it's about God it's about the power of the Holy Ghost it's about the quickening power that it speaks about in Romans 8 is still on the church today that's where our hopes are built not in a man or a Pulpit or a microphone our hopes are built on the power of the Holy Ghost working in the church doing the same things that he promised he would do and if he did it for one he'll do it for you if he did it back then he'll do it today if he ever did it once he will do it again he's God and he changes not he didn't make a mistake when he did it the first time he did it right the first time and he'll do it right again we've just got to recognize where he's at today we don't got to go back in time to reach him he's right here right now doing the same things looking for people to recognize where he's at well Peter and John had to see it for themselves let's go see and so they ran to the Sepulcher they ran to the tomb and when they got there they said you're right it's open right now let's go find him and then stay there and and stay in their sackcloth and Ashes they they went to go find where the Living God was today in this moment in time so we're not sad we're not downtrodden we know that Our Redeemer has Resurrected Amen brother man was saved now notice we serve a living God with living signs living ordinances Hebrews 9 tells us the same we don't serve dead articles we serve the Living God with the living signs now I go to church or I joined I know the Creed I know the catechism that's dead form so we've got the same thing in our church I I know the church age book front and back and I know I like Fords and I like it's dead catechisms if you don't know the Living God but the true token of the blood speaking out speaks of a living resurrected presence Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever living right now Among Us somebody say us it speaks better from not from dead forms or Creeds but a living token of a living resurrected Christ that lives in somebody say us us no they deny there is such a thing but we know it's true but we who believe the word know that God promised it and he keeps his promise no it is his living promise for he does as he did so it's not a fable or an idle tell for me to tell you that you could walk out of here a free person you don't have to walk out with the same cloud of doubt that you walked in with you don't have to walk out with the same cancer that you walked in with you don't have to walk out with the same oppression that you walked in with but God does as he did and if he ever sent somebody free he will make somebody free today he's God and he keeps his word and he changes it not free for you and for a color for this or that but he keeps his word with whoever's faithful so we're faithful to his word recognizing it's the same somebody say same I want us to get that point and drive it home it's the same spirit that he had we also have not different or lesser you know I think in this age we find that men are trying to lower the Holy Ghost standards somehow where it's a lesser anointing than God they're going back to a trinitarian Doctrine we've got to recognize it's the same it's God over us God With Us God in us it's all God right so the power of the Holy Ghost is not somehow less than some deep Revelation I don't believe you can get a deeper Revelation than the power of the Holy Ghost in the church it's God in morphe it's God Amen it's God dwelling inside a tabernacle that is made not by hands but a tabernacle of flesh is where God lays in the stage that is the power of the Holy Ghost I will not stand by and let somebody belittle it down to emotion or shouting or jumping even though it makes me do those things but that is not what the Holy Ghost is in this age it is adoption Authority that by it we can call the Resurrection on without the power of the Holy Ghost she will never understand what the resurrection is without the holy ghost in your life you'll never have access to the promises that God gave it'll be an intellectual understanding of the words that are in the book but it's better to know the author of the book which is the holy ghost himself it's Jesus it's the token it's whatever you want to call if you want to call it the Holy Spirit that's fine with me I don't care what you call it just get it just understand that it's not somehow less than God or Jesus well I want the character of Christ well the character of Christ is the Holy Ghost it's not two different things it's very the the same very thing it's him it's all him it's Christ the man said it was Christ that opened the Red Sea it was Christ that crossed over into the promised land it was Christ that stopped the sun it was Christ that called down stones from Heaven it was Christ that gave those things you see the anointing of the hour is Christ that's why there's an attack on the anointing of the hour to say that it's not the same as it was and we've got to move on past this well I'm not listening to a fable tale cunningly devised by a man I'm looking at the word for what it says I am and it says I can too it says the same power that he had the same spirit that he had I will have also and the same Authority that he had we are joint heirs with Christ joint heirs in the Kingdom right the same Authority that he had we also have my I believe we ought to have the devil on the run to know that we have the same power that put him out of commission the same power that took the keys off his waist the same anointing that came down and took over his own home is the same anointing that we live in and we dwell in it's the message of the hour and we will not find it under our own ideas or theology our own understanding we've got to lean only to the word lean not to that own understanding but only lean on the word it's the only true thing for the band would say now the thing of it is those things uh speeches instead of the word the word being manifest is the evidence that it's right see the word being manifested they will never look at that you've got to have an intellectual conception to know and go to the Seminary and learn how to Bow and how to stand in one place and all oh that would choke a minister to death that was really filled with the Holy Spirit now that's an intellectual but he says the word being manifested is the evidence that it's right so where is the life taking place now we never want to make this about sides or this church or that church or we never identify a name or a person or we're talking about spirits we're talking about spirits in the end time that are trying to take the power away from you not that they they don't have access to and they can't use it but as long as you're not using it we're stalled those loved ones that have gone on before that are waiting for their name to be called were stalled that that that Rapture the changing of our bodies were stalled as long as that power is not being exercised in the church but I believe we're at the time when that power is restored to the church where we're saying enough with with church entity enough with religion enough with Creeds and Theology and man's thoughts but let's go onward into the promises that God gave the church that's where we live it being manifested is the Vindication of it so where is the life taking place that's what I look for where's the life taking place now we we probably encounter people in this walk and you've been in the church long enough that maybe even somebody in this room you just not everybody rubs shoulders Wells together you know I'm sure if we sat down long enough you'd find something or maybe you've already have that you just that's something about him I just don't like or you know there's just I just can't rub shoulders with that or you know I just don't get along with everybody what we're not called to be best friends with everybody but we're called to have perfect love for one another and never mistake that it's a spirit behind that offense it's not the person it's not the sister it's not the brother it's the spirit behind that offense that is causing you to be distracted from your Victory I hope that's okay tonight but I don't want to put a name or a face to it I'm sure we associate it with it in our mind but recognize it's a spirit trying to distract us from the victory at hand many times there'll be distractions in our life and we don't even realize what they are but it's the devil trying to keep our Focus off of the word many times in in a church service I think about uh it's happened to me over in in Africa and I know brother Wayne's told similar stories probably brother Samuel has similar stories he'll be dealing with somebody and and a spirit will break loose over here and it'll draw all the attention to it and you'll spend all night trying to cast out this Spirit out of this person and you gave up the blessing over there it's a distraction to take you off of why you're here I believe that applies to us as everyone individual in here something will break loose a temperament will break loose so we'll have an attitude against this person or that person or we won't go back to church because of this or we don't like this song leader or we don't like this drum player or we don't like this so we don't like that it's a distraction off of our focus of why we're here don't forget why you're here you're here to fulfill the word and be the manifestation of it thereby being the Vindication of the message of the hour it's on you don't get distracted about why you've been positionally placed here where you're at don't get distracted by Little Things don't get distracted by well I wish it was this way or I'd fix this or I'd tweak this or if I had my way that's a distraction don't let a spirit take your focus off of why you've been placed here off of why you're in this age to begin with why are you in this age to begin with is it to fit in with the world or just be uh you know have a a woe is me life or just you know it's so hard and yeah all those things are true but that's not why you're here this is the hardest age that there's ever been but that's not why you're here this is the hardest age to enter into a real belief in a living God but that's not why you're here you're here to be the Vindication of this word to put your focus back on the word say Lord maybe I've got my eye to the left to the right but tonight put my focus back on the word maybe I've been looking at this false or that falter why this isn't okay but put my focus back on the word anybody can see the false anybody can see the failures where the Paul you can look at me and say well this brother's failing here here here here here he's an eagle he's got Eagle Vision he can see he's got discernment the bride's got the sermon in this hour they can see the issue everybody can see the issue but the character of Christ is what you do when you see the issue that's what tells you if you've got the life the Vindication of the message I see the issue but let's love the brother and bring it under the blood and let's get the issue fixed now I'm gonna tear them apart I'm gonna shred everything that he'll never have a you see the spirit that's behind that that's not love love covereth all right love Envy is not love covers a multitude of sin now we say well brother you're trying to cover up sin I'm trying to let the love of God cover sin because it covered you it covered me it's covered our mistakes time after time every time we've we've fallen or we've we've felt it's the love of God that brings us back it's it's the blood which is the love of God that he spilled it was love that brought him to the Cross to begin with right it was love that drunk him to Calvary it was love that allowed him to hang there it was love that let him push on and say not my will but thine be done it was love so it's love that will cover us when we're mistaken so we would be we would not have God's spirit if we were not willing to cover I hope you understand I'm not preaching disgrace but it's easy to spot it's easy to be Balaam and look at the back side of Israel and see every flaw and every mistake and I just I can't wait for my chance to pounce on this and you know oh man and that's easy anybody could do that but what can you do with that power that's what makes you a true Eagle the vision to see is here in this age you can't hide anything the words open true you can't you think that I could get by by an unconsecrated life you're the bride I'm speaking to the wife of Jesus Christ who's got the same spirit that he had and it's through then see through but what do we do with that power we've got to use it the same way that he used it he looked upon the Rich Young Ruler and loved him he had compassion on him but he knew the choice he would make but he still had compassion on him he still looked at him and and and and wanted him to make the right decision with all that was within him make the right decision but he knew he wouldn't make the right decision but we might not have the foresight to know who will and who won't so we better treat everybody like they will is that all right so we are the Vindication that this word is true not an idle tale brother random said it was cowards that made it an idol tale now he's speaking in his church to his ministry he's saying it's cowards that have turned this into an idle tale they've made it they've made it as Peter would say for we have not followed commonly devised fables but we we made known unto you the power of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty Peter we're going to say the more excellent Glory he's speaking of Mount Transfiguration right eyewitnesses of his glory now maybe we weren't there at Mount Transfiguration literally but were eyewitnesses of his glory today to know what he's doing in the church to know where he's headed and we're headed in the same direction right but it's not a it's not a fable we're not cowards uh we're not we're not backing up he's not in the Tomb he's risen I believe it's in Revelations 21. can you pull up Revelations 21 I don't know about maybe maybe verse 14 or so it's just coming to me so I just trust trust is the Lord but we we cannot stand by and we can it's easy for us to put on uh go down a little further look can I read it here go down a little bit yeah down yeah sorry maybe I'll just look it up it's it's in Revelations 21. but we can say that it's a preacher that has turned this word because he's a coward and wouldn't move into it but what would make him do that he's afraid to lose his reputation brother Bram said by putting it on the word now brother Ben would challenge that over and over people would say well you know you're just a you're mind reading you're this or that he said I challenge you to come to the platform and dispute anything that's taken place and nobody would do it he was willing to put his name with the word right and that was the Vindication of God with him and so we can look at the ministry that was around and they weren't willing to put their name with the word to be a Vindication of it because brother mam says they were cowards and wouldn't go into it here it is this verse uh we'll start at six and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit somebody say all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful somebody say fearful but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and whoremongers and Sorcerers and idolaters and Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire in Brimstone which is the second death the fearful with murderers and Liars and sorcerers and whoremongers now those of you that have a naturally nervous Spirit I'm not talking about that kind of fear the fearful cowards that won't take God at his word that are afraid to put their name on the line with God and His word the fearful that's the destination of those who are afraid to rise to the challenge with God and His word we don't want to be in that group we don't want to just say it's an idle tale or it's for another time or that's just for an emotional bunch of people or that's just for this or that there's going to be somebody that recognizes I see the word and it's my duty to fulfill it let me just clear up this little fear here that the church has that I'm not going to make the Rapture if you see it it's for you amen all right if you see the son of man it's for you if you see the holy ghost power in the church it's for you because God's not going to reveal something to you and then say you can't have it brother Brian God's not going to say to you you can this is all I've laid out there and say but it's not for you you can't have it if God showed it to you then it's for you to possess if God showed you there's a revelation in this hour that will free you from every oppression that it's for you to possess it you've just gotta walk on and say that's mine I see it I receive it I see it I believe it I see there's a word coming I I believe it I see there's a word that's changing Hearts I believe it I see that this message is true it's for me you don't have to wonder is it for me it is for you if you see it do you see it brother man will say that time I don't know how many times do you see at church do you see it he's saying if you see it it's for you if you see the seals are open then it's for you if you see the tomb is open then it's for you if you see the word is walking about then it's for you if you see the manifestation of God's power is in the church right now than it is for you if you see healing in your body then it's for you if you see your children coming home then it's for you if you see it then it is for you don't be discouraged and say well I see that God can do it but I don't know if you see it then it's yours to have God is not going to show you a divine revelation and then say that you can't have it if you see it it's your possession take it and go forward [Applause] don't be fearful about it and say well I see it but I'll just hang back huh you know I'll just wait for another day the fearful will have their place in the Lake of Fire but the Church of the Living God do not dwell in fear but we walk on in faith knowing exactly what's been given to us in this hour if we see it it's ours to possess we know why we've been called here we see all these things taking place in the signs that are all around if we see it it's for us to have Peter said we saw a more excellent Glory if we see it adoption Authority is ours if we see it spoken word power is ours if we see it the third poll is ours it's not just catchphrases that God gives to the church that we can have some other Doctrine over another church it's a revelation that what he's doing in this hour you can too right it wasn't just for one man 1965 is for right now this church can do the same works that he did 2 000 years ago he will do again in the church if you see it it's for you it's yours to have it's yours to grasp no man can come to me unless my father draws him no man told you about it but it's God who showed it to you and if God if God thought you good enough to show it to you then God thinks you're good enough to possess it if you see it it's for you [Music] if you see a life victorious in the power of the Holy Ghost it's for you if you see that these Revelations are not just a theology that but they're the Living manifested Word walking down the road to Emmaus breaking bread with them then it's for you to see but you've got to recognize it right those two walking on the road to Emmaus they knew that he would be resurrected they followed him they were his disciples cleophus and a friend right we're walking down the road to Emmaus I believe I was that friend and we're walking down and we're not sure where the Lord is or what he's doing and we knew he would be resurrected but we've got to know where he's at today right now what he's doing at this moment in time and so we're walking down the road and we're discouraged and we're upset and we're saying there's trouble in the church and everybody's bumping into each other nobody can get along and there's doctrines over here and this one over here and we don't know which way to go and we're so discouraged in ourselves but then there comes another man walking amongst us and he's telling us of the power of God testifying of us that it's the same spirit well did not your Prophet say this and this and this and this and this and this it starts to go down the line of everything that the prophets prophesied would come and they said yes all those things are true and you see the anointing around them change to the atmosphere that they were under began to change and then the Lord began to speak to them directly and they recognized it's him so when they saw it they knew it was him right when he came in they constrained him to stay with them and he began to break the bread now the breaking of the bread is the opening of the word it's how he opens the word to us that we recognize the Vindication of it right so as a bride we're in that little room and he's opening the word to us and we're recognizing it's Christ he's here if you see him then he's for us and if Christ is here he's not here to take a back seat somewhere or because he's got nowhere else to be but Christ is here to do a work and if we recognize that Christ is in our little room then what will we do with this Jesus called the Christ that's living with inside of us he will do the Greater Works through you it's him it's all him it never was you or me or brother Branham or Ezekiel or Isaiah or anybody else with a name it's Christ the anointing of God is the same one that's here and are missed in this hour and he does not walk in fear but he knows exactly where he's at and who he is brother Adam said he was positive of who he was can't we be positive of who we are in this hour we don't want to be clumped together with the fearful we want to know where we're at go boldly Before the Throne of God knowing who you are I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God he wants me to come he wants to hear from me he wants to take on my needs he wants to take on my burden you see it's different when you know somebody wants it from you you know when you call your daddy you need to borrow money again you say dad you know I need to borrow you know I need 20 bucks dad and you think I don't know if he's going to want to give it today well maybe I will maybe I won't what do you need it for well it's different when you call somebody you break down you say hey I need a ride can you come pick me up they may they may not they may have time they may be busy it was a shame sometimes you need just a uh you know a favor and you call somebody hey can you help me move about a new house you got a truck can you come help me they may they may not but it's a lot different going to ask somebody for something when you know it's their greatest desire to give it to you a faithful Mama it's her greatest desire to make her children lunch when her kids come to say mom I want a peanut butter sandwich you may not but she may not feel like it she may be tired but she's gonna get up and she's gonna make him a peanut butter sandwich because that's the desire of her heart is to feed her children right where our heavenly father is where that attribute comes from that we have not because we ask not because we're fearful about what he will say but our God is not a god of hate Satan is hate our God is love right so we need to recognize who we're approaching we're not approaching Satan that he might cast us down and say well you didn't you didn't do your 31-day men's last week so I'm not going to give it to you and we're gonna walk away with this reproach upon our life and say well I need to do better before I go back and ask the Lord Brother Ben he does not care what you did yesterday he cares what you're doing right now he does not care how you forsook him last week he cares what you're doing right now the devil is the only one who brings remembrance Upon Our Lives about how we failed the Lord the Lord didn't bring that upon our heart to say this is where you failed and this is where you misstep but the devil brought that upon us that we would be afraid to approach the throne with boldness to ask of the Lord that we might receive God is love so therefore he loves his children to come and ask of him I love him my boys come and ask hey Dad will you show me how to do this or teach me how to do that because I'm giving them something I'm giving them a knowledge right that I learned the hard way that I had to go through life and I said one day I'm going to teach my boy this skill one day I'm going to show him how to do this and when he comes and asks I'll be I'll be glad for it right but then we look at God the father and we think well he's you know he's a miser he's got the wealth but he doesn't want to spend it well he's got the Holy Ghost locked up in there and I've been asking for it for years and now I'm just afraid to ask for it God is not the way we think he is he's not sitting on a bench somewhere saying yeah they're gonna come to me God is the attribute of love what's the Capstone of this age love it's not it's not anything else but love right and what's the second one now I just thought this was interesting the statue of a perfect man this is totally inspiration preaching so I hope it's for you but Faith Rex builds it and it makes sense and patience and knowledge and virtue and Temperance and kindness and godliness brotherly kindness what is that doing at the top all right and then on top of Brotherly kindness is the Holy Ghost makes sense and then what brings down the Capstone love in our mind we would have had that opposite would have had that totally backwards well first let's shake hands with one another then we come into the church and then we get Godly and then we'll get kind and you see the process of man's mind is the exact opposite of God's way but he said add on to this this and add unto this this and first start here before you can go here first have faith that he is God and he is rewarder of those that diligently seek him and then build on top of that and then that and that and that the hardest thing is brotherly kindness why because we know one another we have to live with one another and the hardest thing for us to do is to look past the faults of one another and recognize the attribute of God that's within there and say I maybe I don't agree with everything but there's a God in there that I agree with maybe I don't agree with this or that but there's an element of God in there that I cling to there's just a love there there's a there's a fellowship there and and though I maybe I'll never be maybe I'll never go on a barbecue with this fellow but I love him because there's a peace of God in there God didn't require that we all be best friends God required that we love one another and by this the world will know that ye are my disciples I wonder if now if the world were to take a microscope on us as an individual would they know that we're a disciple of Jesus Christ how would they know buy this that she loved one another Capstone Authority it's not foolish it's not simple preaching it's the Capstone message to the age add unto this this and this this and this this and what's the what's the authority coming down love but bam will say we've got to be honed we've got to be scratched down we've got to be shaved to receive that Capstone to come down and that Capstone is love so it's really hard for us to let go of our own ideas and our own thoughts and just love love God above all else and when you love God you love all of his attributes when you love the word you love everything that's in it you love it I say well you don't even go to our church but there's somebody in here that you may not like and they do go to your church and you've got to love them there's somebody out there in another church or this person or that family member or this or that we're not going to make it by by how many ties that we've cut when we make it there and say well this is my victory of of cut ties that I've cut off relationships with and I've I've said that their day of Grace has passed and there's no hope for them we're not going to make it there by that Paul but we're going to make it by the attribute of love that God gave to the church because that's the only way that we'll know where we're standing right if we try to approach the throne and we're fearful about it then we'll never see what we have need of if we try to approach the father and we're scared about it then we don't love him enough to go to him but when we love him enough and we recognize him as the kind heavenly father who loves us above all things and he is loved and we will go to him boldly and say Lord I have need of this and we recognize that he loves us more than anything in the world and he would love for us to walk in perfect Victory and he would love for us to walk in perfect health he would love for us to never have another headache or a migraine or be afraid or be sore or have joint problems he would love for every arthritic condition to be healed he would love for every every mind to be sound he would love for that we've got to recognize what God's attributes are God is not a God saying well I just you're going to go through this Affliction because you know I just think that you're you're a little too proud so I'm gonna put this Affliction on you no we make choices and by those choices that's a little doctrinal brother Samuel can clear it up when he gets home but and by those choices we endure life and we turned this way and we did that God never brought us through that don't put something on God that's not his fault but what he did promise was in the middle of our burdens and our troubles and our sorrows he would still love us and he would still be there and at any time that we would have the faith to reach out to him he would remove that from us even though it was our fault that we were under it God never put us into a spirit of unbelief and doubt we put ourselves there but even through that unbelief and that Spirit of Doubt God loves us anyway if we could possess that same attribute of love we would defeat every demon that we Face we would defeat every enemy that we encounter every Spirit of sickness every Spirit of Doctrine every every win that would be set us if we possess the Divine attribute of love we would project Sovereign Grace that's the word and that's where I stand I know it's maybe simple or I know you think well that's just love brother well the Baptists believe love but they don't know love like we know love they don't have a revelated word like we have they don't know the love of God like we know we know God's love he came down to us he opened himself up to us and he said I did this you can also do this because of the same spirit that I have I will leave with the church take it or leave it now we would be fools to be a thirst and there'd be a cup of water here well there's water in the fridge brother help yourself no I'm not going to do it well that's about how the church is he left his spirit in the church to do the Greater Works but for some reason we're fearful about where did the goat and take and drink of the water that he left in the church but there's a fountain open in the House of David for those who would believe I believe I'm speaking to people who are believers and say pour it out upon me let the fountain pour out upon me let every blessing pour out upon me let every Victory hit my life let every Authority that God has in this age come into my lips because I am a believer the message is not to the unbeliever it's to the Believers so the spirit of God in this age will falsely anoint and falsely anoint but it's not for them it's to you the believer of the hour to say that's my authority that's my spirit that's my victory I take I'm not ashamed of it I'm not going to put it to the back or push it to the side I want it all I want everything that God's given me maybe you've been walking to Victory for years but there's more to have maybe you've been walking in complete and total healing for years but there's more to have maybe you've experienced the Holy Ghost 30 years ago there's more to have there's always more to have it's your eyes are open to it there's no exhausting the Fountain of God's riches in this age that he's given to the church and we have not because we ask not I believe we're coming to a time and place where we're ready to take on the whole armor of God and everything that comes with it I want it I want it all I don't want to leave anything left you know when you're eating good food you just clean the plate I believe that's how we should do don't leave anything left behind but clean the plate I want every Victory that's been promised to the church I want to see every prodigal that the devil's taken out be restored I want to see every young person that doesn't know the power of his resurrection to be filled with the Holy Ghost I want to see every borderline believer come to a revelation to realize I'm not going to make it by my own intellect and come under the authority of the message of the hour that's what I want to see in this age I see it so it's for me to have it what do you see in your family what do you see in your life I see a church walking in Victory that will not be ashamed that will not be afraid and yes you will be hidden yes she will be bruised but she will walk on anyway because she is an invincible Army that's what I see what do you see I don't see a man that came that spoke Kentucky English that came with I see Christ coming and using a broken vessel to bring his word out and open it up to me that I can come into the same Authority that he had when he was here in flesh [Applause] that's what I see what do you see what do you say of this message called Christ what do you think it is it'd be a shame for a disciple to sit there and go hungry we read about that in the Book of Matthew they would be there and say Lord have per Adventure send these away that they go buy their own food we don't have food to feed them Paul it's like the whole church came over the house and we've got some samalto meal and what are we gonna do with them we don't have money Judas what do we got nothing you better send them home well it'd be a shame if that was the end of the story and Christ just said you're right send them home but he said what do you got all right what do you got I've got a little bit of faith I'm barely here okay we can work with it bring it to me what do you say bring it to me you see in his hands a few fishes and a few loaves goes a long way if there was 10 000 people there he would have fed him if there was 50 000 people there he would have fed him there was only 5 000 people there so he said I can make this work for 5 000 people so you might just have a little bit of Faith but in his hands it can do whatever you want it to do it can move a mountain if you could have faith as the grade of a mustard seed and put it in his hands and say to this mountain be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart it shall be given unto you amen so you might just be here with a little bit of Faith but put it in his hands it'd be a shame for those disciples to eat their Five Loaves and Fishes and walk away still hungry and never have helped anybody and Christ being right there in their midst how about us how many services have we come in service after service and we want something from the Lord but we feel that maybe where job is this or distractions this or our faith is this or this is damaged and this and this and this and this and this and this and Christ is here in our midst and we have not because we ask not he said give it to me get me what you got and I'll work with it give me what faith you do have and I'll multiply it and I'll multiply it and I'll multiply it give me give me your patience and I'll add under your virtue give me your godliness and I'll give you the brotherly kindness give me what you got and I'll give you the rest you see we've got something to do we've got to bring it to him those fishes and loves came from somewhere right they brought him to the Lord and He multiplied them so let's bring our faith to the Lord tonight and let him multiply it that we could have what we need he's not a God that's saying I want you to need I want you to walk out the door and still have a need God wants you to be satisfied under his word draw on El Shady eye that you could be nourished is what the prophet said he doesn't want you to go away thirsty or hungry or wanting but come to the house of the Lord hungry in expectation and he will satisfy the hunger that you have within you that's why we come to church that's why I come to the house of God I don't come to I certainly don't come to hear myself or even the preacher or the songs being some I came because there's a promise that if I could come into that atmosphere and that atmosphere is created by the worshipers that recognize that Jesus is Alive and Well and he's not in a cemetery somewhere and they worship him like he's a present Living God and he comes into that room and under that atmosphere I can bring him my little faith I can bring in my alabaster box and let him do what he wants with it I can bring him everything that I have and say lord it's not much but here you go Lord take what you will take what take everything from me and multiply it that I could leave a whole person and the next service we do it again until the changing of our bodies I believe a service we're going to walk in here or maybe don't feel like we have much faith brother Brian we might feel like it's just a regular service but will have a portion of faith that will bring to the king and we'll say here's my portion of faith I reckon I see this in the word this is what I want it took 10 days for them to all get in one Accord it's taken us about 40 Years to all get in one Accord that we have one anticipation need and it's for the changing of our bodies Lord this is my focus this morning this is what I have and this is what I'm offering for it and the Lord will take that and he will multiply it and he will multiply it and he will multiply and you would think as the disciples they would be so encouraged that they would let light the world on fire with what God's done but they get in a boat and they go sailing across the sea and that very same night they see Jesus walking on the water you know sometimes we get under an atmosphere and the Lord comes down and we think I'll never doubt them again I've seen too much how this this anointing that was in this building uh just my the healings that have taken place in that prayer line and the anointing power of God but they just give it a couple days for them it was the same day and they're sitting in this boat and they see the same one who who multiplied the fishes and the loaves walking on the water and they cry out for fear because they don't believe is it you who else is it going to be it's the guy who just multiplied the fishes in the loaves we don't need a what better sign from Heaven do we need we I think sometimes we sit in our Pew and expect an Angelic light to fall and cast upon our shoulder and say our name in an audible voice so we're not going to be moved well who else is it that stirs your heart and brought you here and revealed to you the word and showed you that it was about you and showed you that there was an Exit Plan and showed you that this is all about you and it's a love book to you who else shows you that it's Christ what more do we need than for him to just take us out of here but we've got to recognize it's me if God never came and did another Supernatural thing in my life Don't Take Your Presence for me Lord but if you never did I trust him anyway you know why because he showed me enough by now that I know without a shadow of a doubt that it is true and it is for me and though he slay me yet I'll trust him but if he's coming back for one I believe it's me if he never visits me again I believe that with all my heart because God will not change and if he ever showed it to me once he will keep his word today he's not going to change on you say well I showed you this Revelation 40 years ago but I've changed it today not God he's the same he does the same thing by the same way he did it the first time or he's not perfect right but he is perfect and so the way he did it the first time is the correct way and he will do it that way again the only variable is us that's the only variable in this is our faith so then they find themselves on the water and they're they're looking out and I said you yeah Peter said if it is you then bid me come what a challenge if this really is true that bit me to come well you better be ready come on come walk with me a while what have been Peter's a fisherman he knows the water you know I mean he's seen drowned in the Sea of Galilee he knows he knows that that first step could be his last and he's strong in faith he's just seen the Loaves and the and the fishes and his faith is high and so he steps out on the water walking on that inspiration of faith and he makes it out their ways but then Jesus isn't performing the Wonders maybe in the middle of the ocean and he's just standing there looking at Peter and Peter begins to come to himself I'm standing in the middle of the sea and begins to sink you see we can't rely on what God did yesterday we've got to see what he's doing today and so he said yesterday he he multiplied this and multiplied that but what is he doing today well he's standing in the middle of the sea is that not enough Peter and he begins to sink down and the Lord says why have you gone afraid where's your faith gone from you is it not enough that I'm standing in the middle of the sea and you've already made it all the way out here what brought you this far Peter right now the Bible leaves that it says when they return to the ship the wind ceased right didn't say the wind ceased in that moment and Peter was okay but the Lord says why have you feared why have you doubted I brought you this far I'll bring you back to the boat now I don't know if he was holding his hand on the way back or how that transpired but Peter got the faith to come up out of that water and walk back to the boat because if the Lord brought you this far he'll see you all the way back to the harbor if the Lord brought you out of denomination he's going to take you all the way in our trust has got to recognize that he's not going to leave us in the middle of an ocean somewhere that he's he's forsaken us so forgot about us what if Jesus brother Paul would have just walked away from Peter and left him in the middle of the ocean he would have drowned but he said I'll never leave you I'll be right here and Jesus didn't say anything until Peter began to doubt he said Peter where's your faith love is corrective always brother bear says it probably five six times love is corrective Peter where's your face see the love of God to reach out and challenge us where's your Faith Church are you ready to challenge me at my authority are you ready to challenge me on what my power can do where's your faith church and he tells Peter you've already come this far and you're going to disbelieve me now and Peter rising up in faith says yay Lord I'll walk back to the boat with you I would just put myself in Peter's shoes for a moment Lord up and down lord I've been beaten up I've been lied about I've been criticized everything you can think of has been plagued me and I'm just seeking a little low and the Lord doesn't want to hear my whiny story he says Peter where's your faith I brought you this far the only way you're going to make it back is to get to the same faith that brought you here is the same faith that you could turn around with and walk back to the boat it's not about how sympathetic our story is we all have a story and God cares but God cares about our faith in the middle of the storm the winds didn't cease until Peter made it back to the boat so if you're looking for the storm just depart and it for just to be a flowery bed of ease that's not where Christ is he's in the middle of the storm [Music] he's not out there in a silent place a cemetery looking for him in the dead things and traditions of the world saying well maybe he's here maybe he's he's there or we'll go look for him over here but he's right in the middle of the storm believe that it's for us if it's not for anybody else the rest of the disciples didn't have the faith to challenge him to say if it's you call me I wonder how many of us have said within our faith Lord if this is you call me take me we walk out by faith we get out there a little bit whoo Mr Browning what was it like when you guys started a church Lord if this is you call us get out there a little bit in the water this is deep we're going to be treading here in a moment but the same God that anointed you to be where you're sitting tonight is right by your side and he's saying where has your faith gone the same anointing that brought you this far will take you all the way the same quickening power is the resurrection of our faith because that's what this is all about right restore our faith back to the Faith of Our Fathers we're the children of this of this message and we're to have our faith restored back to the fathers that it was once given to right Peter where's your faith come back onto the boat with me come back onto the boat with me my goodness predestination and power right there brother I must say now the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own now this is deep now be sure to catch this good I'm trying to close here now as the sun went set across the Earth not to bring rocks which was dirt also it was not to bring all the dirt to life but was to bring the part of the dirt which wasn't closed around the life Not all men will receive Christ oh no but those which God foreordained life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth and that's the one he comes to Quicken they are the ones that now that dirt would lay there in the Sun and say oh this old sun is so hot and that rock would say this old sun is so hot but that little seat said that's what I'm looking for and it began to Spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to Quicken The Rock and not to Quicken the dirt but to Quicken the life of the seed now the Holy Spirit comes now it wasn't sent to everyone why won't all the people receive it it wasn't sent to them but it was sent to you do you see it do you see election then it's for you do you see that election is the love of God then it's for you I see it I can't explain it I can't put it into words right right but I know that I would not be here by my own my own intellect or my own faith or my own ability to overcome situations and problems I see the elective love of God in my life that he's brought me this far out here and if he brought me this far he's not going to leave me here because God is the author and the finisher of our faith and so right now we might be in the middle of the Sea of Galilee wondering how we're going to get out of it but he who started it will finish the work of what she started in you so if God brought you out here don't think that he's forsaken you now if God brought you into a partial Victory don't stop there but go all the way in to the to Total victory in the word of God he who started it will finish it his love has elected you to it do you see it the prophet would say do you see a church do you see the love of God throughout your life we can pass the mic and we could ask everybody in here what's God done for you and you and you and you wish Brother Ray was here he would have stood up and I'll tell you what he's done but those are what make us who we are I I love testimonies of what God's done in people's life because if they he did it for them he can do it for me and and it never fails somebody will share a testimony with me and within a few weeks I'll run into somebody that is having the same problem and I'll say you know what a couple weeks ago a brother shared a testimony with me because if he did it for him he can do it for you do you see the love of God in your life so if you see the hand of God's love in your life then it's for you and if God's love is set upon you what can stop you what can stand against you God wants you to walk out of here in total victory total victory is loves for you we're not fearful to put our name with it we're not afraid to stand with it we're not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ we don't want to be identified in the fearful scripture we don't want to carry our own fears about what about what about if I try and it doesn't work I believe that's one of the greatest crutches against the Church of the Living God is the fear of failure what if I try and it's not me what if I'm Not Elected what if I'm not do you see that you are then it's for you don't link yourself up with the fear because perfect love casteth out all fear if we can stand to our feet tonight We're Not Afraid we know where we're standing I'm not ashamed to put my name with it and say I I believe God's A Healer brother Paul I've put my name on the line with him because my name means nothing his name means everything and if he said that it was the same spirit in this age that would do the Greater Works then I'm not ashamed to put my name next to that but the Paul was there in a service Sunday morning we prayed for many cases many cases God may not heal all those people Paul but I'm going to pray for the same amount of people the next time but but one Faith reaching out with the same response will bring the same reaction he'll do the Greater Works well you say well brother you know you're just trying to increase people's hopes do you see it I see it I see a church walking victoriously in the word I see a church without spot a wrinkle you know why because the love is covering her the love of God how rich and pure how miserless and strong that even when I didn't love him and I wasn't looking for him he loved me that's what brother Brown would just sing it all the time I love him ah I love him because he first love me [Music] and her just my salvation [Music] oh God uh freeze trees you know let's just sing it to him I [Music] love him here because [Music] salvation [Music] oh God Calvary [Music] love him oh [Applause] [Music] happy [Music] [Applause] [Music] because [Music] amen Jesus I we thank you for your love Lord we thank you that it's the binder of all things Lord It's that Capstone love that's coming down in this age Lord we just we can't explain it we can't put it into words but Lord there's a greater love it's the harder way Lord but you spoke to your prophet and said that because he had chosen the harder way he would have a tremendous victory in the love divine Lord I believe it's the same for us tonight Lord It's the harder way but it's your way father Lord I asked it Lord we would have above all more love father Lord for your word says that perfect love brings perfect Faith Lord that's what we desire father it's going to take a perfect Faith to change our bodies and to bring back the prodigals and restore broken families and hopes and dreams and shattered bodies and bruised Minds father it's going to take perfect faith and Lord that perfect faith will only come by perfect love father and Lord we want more Love Tonight father I pray Lord that you would just give an extra measure of love father to each one in this building tonight father Lord that you would just let your sweeping Angel just come by and Lord we'd reach out and say Lord I I need a lot in my life but let me lay aside everything else and say Lord Give Me Love just give me more love for your word give me more love for your people oh God give me more love for the promises you've given me Lord Lord give me more love for myself Lord I I recognize that I'm a Child of God Lord but sometimes I'm just so hard on myself Lord let me see you and me Lord and love that peace Father Lord let us just bind together one another in love Lord father I pray that you take this believer spoken word Tabernacle and you'd give it a greater measure of love than they've ever known father Lord I pray that you bind them together in a greater Fellowship Lord arm and arm with one another Lord marching towards your coming word Lord saying soon and very soon we shall go to see the king that's our desire Lord and we'll only get there by a highway of Love Lord father me you take us higher Lord many of us might be in the middle of the Sea of Galilee as it were father wondering where you are if you're still around us but Lord Your Love Never Fails father never gives up Lord It's always present it's our strength in the times of trouble Lord oh Father I oh Lord where would we be without your love oh Jesus that what it took to press on and say oh nevertheless let not my will be done but thy Lord it was love the Lord is love that will bring the Rapture of the church Lord It's love that we'll bring to culmination all of these Revelations which have been taught over the years and men have died believing but it's love that'll bring a resurrection father it's love that'll Inspire the words and the faith oh god father we're asking that you would bring your Capstone down upon us father we might just have a few Loaves and a few fishes to bring but Lord we're putting them in your hands father Lord in your hands you make all things possible
