[18:23] brother Sanchez
[18:25] sister Browning Miss memo Browning
[18:28] we come and treat us like kings but
[18:31] here's the thing about it when I when I
[18:33] married into the family I inherited
[18:36] every bit of it
[18:37] it just comes with the benefit the first
[18:40] time when I met I married into the
[18:41] family I messed it up and I had to go
[18:43] about five years being cast out of the
[18:45] church and God really had to put a
[18:47] pounding on me get my mind straight
[18:50] where I would listen I was raising a
[18:52] message my whole life okay that don't
[18:54] mean nothing to me because you're
[18:56] raising the message your mom and dad
[18:57] believes the message don't mean nothing
[18:58] to me
[18:59] I was one of the meanest dogs in
[19:02] Tennessee
[19:04] just telling you the truth I'm telling
[19:06] you I was
[19:08] God I'm serious I had a I had a nature
[19:10] about me
[19:11] and and after God changed my life sister
[19:14] Jesus I love you
[19:16] after God changed my life he uh he he
[19:19] gave me a business when I was young I've
[19:21] run a business I've owned a business and
[19:23] I had people help me run that business
[19:24] now he's he's let me kill big deer I'm a
[19:28] I'm an avid big deer hunter I'm not a
[19:30] country boy
[19:31] but he's allowed me to do all that stuff
[19:33] he's really he's he really always
[19:35] blesses me with a big deer every year
[19:36] sometimes a couple of big deer but
[19:43] I was running him as fast as I could go
[19:46] from him he said you can't get away from
[19:48] me
[19:48] listen you're running from God today
[19:51] this if you're running from God today
[19:54] and you ain't went all the way with God
[19:56] go all the way with God because because
[19:58] the devil come at you and he says if you
[20:00] do that he said and he said you're gonna
[20:02] have to give this up look what you're
[20:03] going to lose it's a biggest lie he ever
[20:05] told it's people that do drugs but my
[20:09] pastor said all day people are on drugs
[20:11] and she said if they'll come to this he
[20:13] said they'll be on a high the rest of
[20:14] their life and God has allowed me in my
[20:17] lifetime God has allowed me in my
[20:19] lifetime brother I have met I have he
[20:22] has let me meet all kinds of people he's
[20:24] letting me meet famous people he's he
[20:26] let me go and work in a witch's house I
[20:28] got to talk to her and she and she told
[20:31] me how she felt about God and all that
[20:33] and I said it don't affect me none and I
[20:35] walked out there and she she said she
[20:37] never believed Jesus Christ went to a
[20:39] cross for no man she said he was famous
[20:40] but he didn't go to a cross I walked out
[20:43] there and I said Thank God then he gave
[20:45] me a revelation that I knew he went to a
[20:48] cross for me
[20:50] across
[20:54] so every spirit that comes to me and me
[20:57] my family would go that's not God that's
[20:59] not God the only Spirit we know is God
[21:05] and for us we're going we're going home

[47:49] yes
[47:53] I am going all the way
[47:59] oh
[48:00] [Music]
[48:01] I'm going all the way
[48:05] see I'm going all the way
[48:10] with the Lord
[48:14] hallelujah let's give him a hand clap of
[48:16] Praise this morning
[48:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:25] Hallelujah man
[48:27] amen don't you love the Lord
[48:30] amen I
[48:33] I just appreciate
[48:35] amen every one of those songs the
[48:38] specials amen the words that were
[48:42] were mentioned
[48:44] and um
[48:46] you have to forgive me but you know when
[48:48] I hear Brother David I was sitting back
[48:50] there and I just was kind of
[48:52] just kind of chuckling into my heart and
[48:55] and my spirit because um well you don't
[48:58] have to guess what's on his mind
[49:01] and you don't have to guess where he
[49:03] stands
[49:06] and you know there's all there's all we
[49:09] have all those parts within the kingdom
[49:11] of God
[49:13] and you know I I couldn't help but think
[49:15] about it and I hope this all right
[49:16] brother David but I helped I couldn't
[49:18] help but think you know because brother
[49:20] Branham caught it when he was preaching
[49:22] that there were some people who when
[49:24] brother Wayne brother Ben Bryant was was
[49:26] carrying on me
[49:29] stopped in that service he said wait a
[49:31] minute wait wait wait wait wait he said
[49:33] if you knew what God delivered that man
[49:35] from
[49:38] what God delivered that man from
[49:41] you know when you you listen to the
[49:43] message of the hour brother Brandon
[49:44] points that out he said this is why he
[49:46] said brother Ben Brian and brother Ben
[49:48] was
[49:50] brother Ben you know I've heard some
[49:51] stories you know and uh and what a what
[49:54] a what a what a deliverance and I think
[49:56] we all have in our own way
[49:58] you know we're not all we're not all the
[49:59] same we don't all worship the same way
[50:03] grateful for that God's a god of variety
[50:06] you know and that's how God made us in
[50:08] that way
[50:09] and uh you know it's just like uh in
[50:12] myself when when I played football you
[50:15] know I had different ones that kind of
[50:16] some guys that already graduating you'd
[50:18] get around them after the game and stuff
[50:20] so I didn't really want to be around
[50:21] them but you know you get around them
[50:23] and then you know hear the replay of the
[50:25] game would be on we're sitting around
[50:26] and you know they want to poke fun at me
[50:29] and think ah Browning always hugging
[50:31] everybody you know and well it didn't
[50:32] matter if I made the tackle or not
[50:35] it didn't matter if I'm the one who
[50:36] scored the touchdown or not
[50:38] I mean hey I was glad that we scored
[50:43] I was glad when the ball carrier got
[50:45] tackled
[50:46] now that's just me I know not everybody
[50:48] else but that's just me
[50:51] and you know what God didn't change that
[50:53] when he saved me
[50:55] I'm still grateful and I Delight in to
[50:58] see God working in his people
[51:02] now I had other teammates they weren't
[51:05] like that at all you know uh but we were
[51:08] still teammates
[51:09] we still had the same goal and
[51:12] I I just you know I love the Lord and
[51:14] you know I maybe have a kind of a
[51:16] peculiar way of showing it and so forth
[51:18] and maybe you do too but you know I I
[51:21] said it like this let's just fall in
[51:23] love with Jesus and let's just have a
[51:25] good old time
[51:27] amen Jesus I want to enjoy Jesus
[51:31] amen and you know it's just like when we
[51:34] eat uh well I keep going we eat pie and
[51:36] cake and some people might like sitting
[51:38] at the table and after dinner to do it I
[51:40] like getting in my recliner and bring
[51:42] that bowl of apple crisp over there with
[51:44] the coffee and let me just sit down you
[51:47] know over there you might say brother
[51:49] Samuel that's not real spiritual I know
[51:51] but there's some things that when I
[51:52] mention this you'll understand there's
[51:54] differences
[51:56] and God has designed it in that way
[52:02] he's designed it that way
[52:04] I keep on that keeps on spilling over
[52:06] from things eventually we'll preach that
[52:09] but I just it's just so so powerful you
[52:12] know
[52:13] um I want to say as we get ready to look
[52:16] into the word of the Lord I just want to
[52:19] say I love you it's so good to be with
[52:20] you
[52:21] um and I mean that with all my heart
[52:23] it's just a it's a real treasure I look
[52:26] forward to seeing you and being with you
[52:28] because one of these days amen we're
[52:30] going to be together
[52:32] amen we're gonna we're gonna set
[52:34] together and I'm counting on that amen
[52:37] and I don't know how it all is going to
[52:38] get and everything that God's gonna make
[52:40] it all I don't know how he's going to
[52:41] make it all happen but I know it'll be
[52:43] him
[52:44] I know it'll be him that's one thing for
[52:46] sure it will be indeed the grace of God
[52:49] so I also want to make mention to you
[52:51] yeah a little little Aaron and
[52:54] and you know
[52:55] you'll probably be 50 years old of God
[52:57] Parents and I'll still be calling you
[52:59] little Aaron and you might actually be
[53:01] bigger than your daddy at some point in
[53:03] time but I'm just so thankful for what
[53:05] God has moved upon in a little Aaron's
[53:09] heart and
[53:10] um you know I might be a little Aaron
[53:12] been making a big decision yeah amen so
[53:14] we just really appreciate that and how
[53:17] God has just been dealing with his heart
[53:19] and I really appreciate that and just to
[53:22] encourage that and and you know here we
[53:24] are I tell you you can look around this
[53:25] room right here we you've got some
[53:28] cheerleaders
[53:29] you got some people pulling for you
[53:32] amen you got evidence you got witnesses
[53:35] around
[53:36] amen
[53:38] well also remember the upcoming event of
[53:41] the Christian family there at the end of
[53:43] the month and if there's anything you
[53:46] need to get with me or any changes or
[53:48] anything like that you can see see me
[53:50] text me or or whatever
[53:52] so that's all really kind of coming
[53:54] together and we just thank God for that
[53:57] looking forward to it and let's just be
[53:59] in prayer for what God's going to do
[54:01] because I I just believe God's going to
[54:02] do some wonderful things in these in
[54:04] these moments that we have together
[54:07] uh I told you today that I was going to
[54:09] send you show you a picture of brother
[54:11] Joshua and sister Sharon but I I just
[54:13] didn't get time to clip those things off
[54:15] of my phone because some of the photo
[54:18] the photos he sent me it just uh I need
[54:21] to kind of box them in and I hadn't even
[54:24] gotten to my wife and really who's going
[54:26] to want to see him
[54:28] let's be honest man who's going to want
[54:29] to see him the sisters
[54:31] [Laughter]
[54:34] so we'll get them out there you know and
[54:37] uh I tell you they're just a beautiful
[54:39] couple and uh we're just certainly
[54:42] looking forward to them and like I said
[54:44] I spoke to them on Monday on the phone
[54:46] and we're just greeting one another and
[54:48] talking with both of them and so
[54:51] um you know just continue to keep them
[54:53] in prayer for the whole process of her
[54:56] getting over here because brother Joshua
[54:58] will come back in the middle of March
[55:00] and everything the way they've kind of
[55:02] planned the timeline is uh that
[55:05] everything should kind of be making its
[55:07] way by that month but you know how the
[55:09] government is
[55:11] I don't mean to make No Slam but there's
[55:13] no efficiency in the government you know
[55:15] like when they talk about the government
[55:17] handling this well it's not a good track
[55:19] record but you know I I think when
[55:22] brother this is what I thought of when
[55:24] uh you remember when brother Benny Perry
[55:26] was here in not in May but you remember
[55:28] when brother Benny spoke here last
[55:30] January and brother Benny said something
[55:32] in that service when he was testifying
[55:34] he's talking about inspiration dropping
[55:36] and he gave a testimony of how that
[55:39] there was an individual that needed
[55:41] papers processed and God processed them
[55:45] papers in record time
[55:48] true now those are things that even from
[55:50] last January of 2022 we were praying
[55:53] about let's just keep and keep that in
[55:54] prayer would you do that amen for sister
[55:56] Sharon Amen to be able to be here
[56:00] um so
[56:01] uh we want to keep that big smile on
[56:03] brother Joshua's face
[56:06] amen you love the Lord
[56:08] amen amen well God bless you musicians
[56:11] thank you this morning and we want to
[56:14] just look into the word of the Lord and
[56:17] Deuteronomy chapter 2 and I just want to
[56:20] begin there this morning
[56:24] and we'll just see I don't know how
[56:26] where we'll get to on this I would love
[56:28] to
[56:30] bring all these parts out today but I'm
[56:33] not I don't want to rush anything either
[56:37] and so I just want to be mindful of him
[56:41] so would you just be praying with me as
[56:43] I'm ministering and say God just just
[56:45] you know let us give us the direction on
[56:48] this here so on a Deuteronomy 2 and
[56:50] verse 2.
[56:52] and the Lord spake unto me saying
[56:56] ye have compassed this mountain long
[57:00] enough
[57:01] turn you northward
[57:04] I want to just read that again the Lord
[57:07] spake unto me saying can we say that
[57:09] personally
[57:10] unto me personally yea have compassed
[57:14] this mountain long enough turn you
[57:16] northward
[57:19] now there's a lot of things that you and
[57:22] I we can go right we could go down
[57:24] through maybe a list or there's just
[57:26] something that maybe presses on your
[57:28] heart whatever the need is if it's for
[57:30] the holy spirit it's for deliverance or
[57:33] salvation for healing whatever that it
[57:36] might be if we can just we come into
[57:38] that place and say it's long enough
[57:42] it's long enough
[57:43] and that God and it's not us working
[57:45] this is God giving a declaration to our
[57:47] hearts it's long enough and so I want to
[57:50] just hear speak this morning and you'll
[57:52] see as I go into this here just a little
[57:54] bit but I want to speak on principles of
[57:57] Deliverance
[57:58] principles of Deliverance may God bless
[58:00] you bless the reading of the word are we
[58:02] are can we give can you give it to me up
[58:05] here
[58:17] I pardon me just a second here
[58:21] we'll just can we can we go here can I
[58:25] can is it ready on here right now
[59:00] can I get my file in here
[59:10] in Maya
[59:13] there's a mile
[59:18] well you love technology don't you
[59:25] a few seconds and we'll fire him
[59:28] laughs
[59:33] if it's not working it's all right it
[59:35] should be able to
[59:37] Ben can't you air drop it to the
[59:39] computer over there
[59:41] just get it just get it pulled up on
[59:43] there he should be able to airdrop it
[59:44] it's okay I got I got a good corn here
[59:47] that's okay
[59:48] Ben should be able to air drop it
[59:58] so verse three go ahead and get the
[1:00:01] screens back up please verse three
[1:00:04] and what I wanted to show you was I
[1:00:06] wanted to show you just a map that I had
[1:00:08] laid out of the journey
[1:00:10] where Israel had taken coming into the
[1:00:12] promised land and you realize that
[1:00:14] they were
[1:00:16] only a few days from crossing over few
[1:00:19] fully
[1:00:21] but because
[1:00:22] of unbelief
[1:00:25] there were 40 years
[1:00:27] in Journey
[1:00:29] but even in the midst of 40 years
[1:00:32] a believer
[1:00:34] is a believer
[1:00:36] is a Believer is a Believer is a
[1:00:39] believer
[1:00:40] and you say what are you saying
[1:00:43] when that time was up
[1:00:45] Caleb rose up at that moment and he says
[1:00:47] it's time to go
[1:00:51] the 40 years did not take out of Caleb's
[1:00:54] heart what God had put in his heart
[1:00:59] so it doesn't I want to just say it in
[1:01:02] this manner and I'm being very
[1:01:04] intentional with this so whatever the
[1:01:06] past was it's the past
[1:01:12] that's where Paul said I have learned to
[1:01:15] forget those things that are behind me
[1:01:18] the Branham in one place in the message
[1:01:19] I never forget when he's speaking and he
[1:01:21] comes to the end of the service and he
[1:01:23] says if in your walk he says like Moses
[1:01:29] where Moses went and then he failed he
[1:01:31] said if it has been it it has been he
[1:01:35] said a failure let that be a has been
[1:01:39] and start from tonight
[1:01:44] is that right this is the grace of God
[1:01:46] that's given to us
[1:01:48] because to Compass something is just
[1:01:51] where we to go around it and just keep
[1:01:54] going around and we realize it that in
[1:01:56] this that we God has called us to get
[1:01:59] into the word of God and that we're not
[1:02:01] just going to pass by the same mile post
[1:02:04] and same markers over and over and God's
[1:02:06] grace God wants a a full work and full
[1:02:10] deliverance and God wants there's more
[1:02:12] that God has for us
[1:02:14] Amen to a Believer a Believer uh as
[1:02:18] brother Brown places it this way a
[1:02:19] Believer presses on to Perfection that's
[1:02:23] what a Believer does they they press on
[1:02:25] there's a pressing that goes on in our
[1:02:27] life and you can as a Believer you can
[1:02:31] never be satisfied outside of a full
[1:02:34] surrender
[1:02:35] and you can never be satisfied even when
[1:02:37] there's been a full surrender you can
[1:02:39] never be satisfied out of fully and
[1:02:42] continually walking and dedicating and
[1:02:45] devoting your life to God
[1:02:47] there's a lot of other things that you
[1:02:49] can try to and sometimes there's traps
[1:02:52] to try to occupy our Zeal and listen
[1:02:56] Satan knows us
[1:02:58] he studies us if you knew the case File
[1:03:01] he had on you it'd probably scare you
[1:03:03] come on now I'm preaching right from the
[1:03:06] word of God
[1:03:07] he studies us and he looks at everything
[1:03:10] in his desire is to try to impede slow
[1:03:14] down stop hinder the working of God in
[1:03:18] our life
[1:03:19] so he'll he'll place things and he'll
[1:03:21] try to channel our lives but you know
[1:03:23] that's why there's nothing satisfying
[1:03:26] outside of full surrender in every
[1:03:30] moment
[1:03:31] serving the lord
[1:03:34] and there's nothing that will satisfy
[1:03:37] that and so the direction itself for us
[1:03:39] as Believers is there's the direction is
[1:03:42] always to be going forward uh never to
[1:03:46] be standing still
[1:03:47] or to even go back because let me say
[1:03:51] this wherever your eyes are set is the
[1:03:54] direction you'll go
[1:03:57] and that's why Satan wants to try to
[1:03:59] he'll try to distract with a lot of
[1:04:01] other things and brother Branham put it
[1:04:03] just like this in the message he said
[1:04:05] when as God's dealing with your life and
[1:04:08] he says how that there's things then
[1:04:10] it'll start coming your way and he said
[1:04:12] it's things where the enemy will present
[1:04:14] this and he'll present that like he
[1:04:16] presented for a lot hey you can have a
[1:04:18] better life for your family down here in
[1:04:20] Sodom and so you know a lot lot just was
[1:04:23] you know he knew enough that I I can't
[1:04:25] go down there but all he had to do was
[1:04:28] is turn his tent door to face Sodom and
[1:04:32] he yielded to that and eventually the
[1:04:35] entrance or what began to come into His
[1:04:37] tent eventually his tent was down in
[1:04:42] Sodom
[1:04:43] so it's what we give ourselves to
[1:04:45] because whatever we give ourselves to we
[1:04:48] will become
[1:04:49] and that's why it's very important that
[1:04:51] within everything and Paul dealt with
[1:04:53] that on our thinking and what we give
[1:04:55] ourselves to and I want to say it in
[1:04:58] this manner that is it's always to be
[1:04:59] going forward with God and even how God
[1:05:03] would talk to Moses and he wouldn't tell
[1:05:05] Moses even when they had journeyed to
[1:05:08] Mount Horeb and you remember they
[1:05:10] journeyed to Mount Horeb this was after
[1:05:12] the Red Sea and it came a time after
[1:05:14] they were on Mountain Horeb that God LED
[1:05:17] Moses know it's time to go from Mount
[1:05:20] Horeb all the way and God let him know
[1:05:23] and this is the one thing you can always
[1:05:25] you always can catch and always know
[1:05:28] that God he has a timing your I can't
[1:05:31] get ahead of God's timing for our own
[1:05:33] lives or even for the lives of others uh
[1:05:36] I'm saying like this even as the pastor
[1:05:38] of disassembly there can be things that
[1:05:40] that I want to see but it's the burden
[1:05:42] that God puts on my heart but God knows
[1:05:45] the timing
[1:05:46] sometimes in the way and God has that
[1:05:48] that brother Brian lays down clearly in
[1:05:50] the church age book is the timing the
[1:05:52] time is in hand God has a timing so when
[1:05:54] we're looking at that what we what we
[1:05:56] must do is operate under the inspiration
[1:05:59] of the Holy Spirit at that moment
[1:06:02] because it's God that'll bring
[1:06:04] everything in place we talk about the
[1:06:07] vision where the handkerchief had to be
[1:06:09] here this person here this person here
[1:06:11] that was only a picture to show what the
[1:06:16] holy spirit will do in our lives with
[1:06:19] getting our heart lined up and in the
[1:06:22] right place for God to move so when we
[1:06:25] look at this I want to just I want to
[1:06:28] just say it like this there's a deep
[1:06:29] resolve and I trust I there is a deep
[1:06:32] resolve in our hearts in this hour and
[1:06:36] that deep resolve that would be there is
[1:06:39] that this is not we are not in a in a
[1:06:43] point of a so far religion
[1:06:46] I'm gonna go ahead and go on oh they've
[1:06:49] got it up there
[1:06:53] gets better late than never
[1:06:56] you can't see this back there and if you
[1:06:59] need it we'll send it to you there's
[1:07:00] many pictures of it but I like this one
[1:07:02] because some of those things are too
[1:07:04] busy for me but when you
[1:07:08] wow this is out
[1:07:13] you can see the red the red line and the
[1:07:16] red journey I mean here they are all
[1:07:18] this time and when God said it's time to
[1:07:20] turn northward the direction that God
[1:07:23] was given was an indication it's time to
[1:07:26] turn northward it's time to go to the
[1:07:30] mountain of the amorites it's time to
[1:07:33] cross this is after the 40 years it's
[1:07:36] time to cross now going back to my
[1:07:38] slides for me I'm done with that please
[1:07:40] so here we are in a resolve this is
[1:07:43] where the resolve and I think this is
[1:07:45] where every one of us
[1:07:47] not only should be but I believe that
[1:07:51] would be and and should be continuously
[1:07:53] in our lives that we are not in a just
[1:07:57] so far walk
[1:08:01] because when we only walk
[1:08:04] if we fail to walk daily with him
[1:08:07] brother laid it out clearly says we take
[1:08:10] an organizational life
[1:08:13] so it's a daily walk with almighty God
[1:08:16] when remember when when Moses was
[1:08:19] presented by Pharaoh Pharaoh got to a
[1:08:22] place with uh with uh with Moses here
[1:08:26] here where the word is coming and
[1:08:28] Pharaoh said if you guys want to go
[1:08:30] ahead and you want that kind of religion
[1:08:32] you want to worship that way then I tell
[1:08:34] you what you older people you guys go
[1:08:37] ahead and worship
[1:08:39] she's trying to make a deal
[1:08:41] for it for something part way or halfway
[1:08:43] but Moses had a resolve in his life that
[1:08:47] we're not going to have a just so far
[1:08:50] religion you know why because Moses had
[1:08:53] had an experience that went beyond a
[1:08:56] just so far experience
[1:08:58] he was now here he was it was not only
[1:09:01] was he in the presence of the burning
[1:09:03] bush but the same God that had come down
[1:09:06] there and drawn him was now veiled in
[1:09:09] Moses life
[1:09:11] and Moses knew the liberty and the
[1:09:13] Victory of being of being drawn Beyond
[1:09:17] and Beyond a just so far experience
[1:09:19] remember the deals that they wanted to
[1:09:22] make I just leave your children here and
[1:09:24] you know you guys can go ahead and go
[1:09:25] and and all this right here the devil's
[1:09:27] all about trying to make deals
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:31] amen
[1:09:33] but I'm going to tell you this here
[1:09:36] you'll never get anywhere with making a
[1:09:38] deal or sitting down on a peace table
[1:09:40] with the Devil
[1:09:42] you'll never get anywhere
[1:09:44] you've got to make a decision
[1:09:47] every day every moment
[1:09:51] Moses made the decision and said we're
[1:09:54] not leaving hoof behind
[1:09:57] not only are our children not brother
[1:10:00] Sammy you don't know where my children
[1:10:01] are at let it be a declaration it's not
[1:10:04] a so far religion it's all the way God
[1:10:07] promised me that I and my offspring
[1:10:10] would be there he said believe and thy
[1:10:12] in thy house shall be said that is a
[1:10:15] promise that God has made I'm not a so
[1:10:17] far Christian I'm an all the way kind of
[1:10:21] guy
[1:10:22] yeah
[1:10:25] you know why Moses didn't believe in us
[1:10:28] so far let me let me read a statement to
[1:10:30] you I don't have this on the board but
[1:10:32] Moses is faith
[1:10:34] was not a so far faith
[1:10:37] you know why because his faith it now
[1:10:40] was not Moses's Faith his faith had been
[1:10:44] anointed by the same God who veiled
[1:10:47] himself there on the mountain
[1:10:49] and that same God told Moses you're
[1:10:51] going to bring him out and you're going
[1:10:53] to come back and worship me on this
[1:10:54] mountain what was God saying the same
[1:10:57] experience I've given you as the
[1:10:58] messenger is the same experience that
[1:11:01] I'm bringing the rest of the people to
[1:11:03] in this Exodus
[1:11:07] it's not a just so far
[1:11:12] times we
[1:11:14] can be it very comfortable with things
[1:11:16] but uh just so far well you know I've
[1:11:18] I'm doing pretty good and uh you know
[1:11:20] I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:22] but we press on if we've got the baptism
[1:11:24] of the Holy Ghost the Bible said that's
[1:11:26] the earnest
[1:11:27] hello somebody it's a desire I'm
[1:11:30] pressing on to what to in my father's
[1:11:33] house or many mansions I have got a
[1:11:38] mansion over and under I've got a body
[1:11:40] Over Yonder and there are cities to take
[1:11:43] down in this land there are strongholds
[1:11:45] to be pulled down there are battles to
[1:11:48] be won there's character to be molded
[1:11:50] there ain't no time to sit down it's
[1:11:53] time the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:56] the time of overcoming it's a time of
[1:11:58] operating by the power and authority of
[1:12:01] almighty God moving through Sons and
[1:12:03] Daughters of God
[1:12:05] hallelujah it's not a time of
[1:12:07] compromising it's a time to take
[1:12:09] everything that God has said in his word
[1:12:16] that's why
[1:12:17] when Moses stood there and looked at the
[1:12:19] opposition God said speak the word
[1:12:22] that the people go forward how am I
[1:12:25] going to get through this speak the word
[1:12:31] crying about this crying about that you
[1:12:33] know when brother Brandon preaches why
[1:12:34] Christ speak he comes even throughout
[1:12:36] that message and he comes to the end of
[1:12:38] it he said I need to repent
[1:12:42] because he realized here's an opposition
[1:12:44] and God was pointing him back to the
[1:12:47] same thing that has brought you this far
[1:12:49] the word Will Make A Way
[1:12:53] you don't get anything you see what the
[1:12:55] enemy has always wanted to do if the
[1:12:58] church is not going how we think it
[1:12:59] should or our family or this and that
[1:13:01] and we want to deviate other means you
[1:13:04] can't go any other way and expect
[1:13:07] Victory there is no other course of
[1:13:12] Victory than through the word
[1:13:18] speak the word that they go forward
[1:13:21] the Bible said in Hebrews 12 1 wherefore
[1:13:25] seeing we are compassed about with so
[1:13:26] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[1:13:28] aside every weight
[1:13:30] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:13:33] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:13:35] that is set before us I want you to
[1:13:37] catch that a moment
[1:13:39] let us lay it aside there is Authority
[1:13:42] there is there is Grace that is present
[1:13:45] and Authority in your life to lay it
[1:13:48] aside
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:51] brother Branham stands there in the
[1:13:53] message the deity of Jesus Christ and
[1:13:56] hold the Holy Spirit takes that maybe I
[1:13:58] mean listen a message in a while it'd be
[1:13:59] good to listen to it because he's he
[1:14:02] puts it in mind in this manner he said
[1:14:04] it is in you to live above sin
[1:14:07] amen it is in you to overcome
[1:14:10] because the Holy Ghost comes to raise up
[1:14:13] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:14:16] there's an authority don't the devil is
[1:14:19] a liar
[1:14:22] you know the reason that spooky feeling
[1:14:25] wants to come around it ain't you that's
[1:14:28] the devil amen amen it's a spirit that's
[1:14:30] afraid of being exposed
[1:14:34] there you go let's just put it on notice
[1:14:36] of what it is it ain't you it's a spirit
[1:14:39] and the Holy Spirit is calling him out
[1:14:43] and God's given you an authority listen
[1:14:45] I'm gonna tell you this you don't even
[1:14:47] have to wait to the end of the service
[1:14:49] to lay something aside
[1:14:52] it can take place right while the words
[1:14:54] going forth if you come at the end of
[1:14:56] the service so be it there ain't nothing
[1:14:58] wrong there ain't more faith either way
[1:15:00] it's that you know what I'm going all
[1:15:02] the way
[1:15:05] all right
[1:15:07] yes how are we supposed to run it
[1:15:10] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:15:12] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:15:14] that was set before him endured the
[1:15:17] cross and despising the shame aren't you
[1:15:19] glad for that
[1:15:20] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[1:15:22] Throne of God
[1:15:24] now this is where I want to get to here
[1:15:28] um for it's my fault in the text here
[1:15:31] this morning these are some things that
[1:15:33] I'm just going to say
[1:15:35] how God pressed it on my heart here just
[1:15:38] a few weeks ago but has been really for
[1:15:40] a few years it's just things that I've
[1:15:42] just and sometimes when you're studying
[1:15:44] things they it's just like a pot boiling
[1:15:46] it spills over into things because it
[1:15:48] influences everything even as you're
[1:15:50] studying and you're looking at it and
[1:15:52] these are some things that if you uh
[1:15:54] look in the time of July of 63 brother
[1:15:57] Branham is going through uh some things
[1:16:00] there in July of 63 and he works uh into
[1:16:03] that of August of 63 and I'm saying this
[1:16:06] to you for a purpose if you have an
[1:16:08] opportunity and through the work or
[1:16:10] through the week begin to listen to
[1:16:12] those messages beginning in the first
[1:16:13] part of July it'll start with communion
[1:16:15] and then it'll come into uh like Christ
[1:16:18] speak humble thyself a prisoner and then
[1:16:21] he cares for you it'll keep building
[1:16:23] throughout that month there there is a
[1:16:25] purpose I'm going to read here in a
[1:16:27] moment from the message a prisoner and
[1:16:30] brother Brandon preaches this message uh
[1:16:32] the the the the Wednesday before he
[1:16:34] preaches he cares do you and there's
[1:16:37] things that brother Branham is is seeing
[1:16:39] within the church and and he's he
[1:16:42] there's a burden that God has put upon
[1:16:44] him for this now I'm going to just read
[1:16:46] it to you out of a prisoner he says
[1:16:48] sometimes he said I believe one of the
[1:16:50] great things that I find in this day is
[1:16:52] the lack of sincerity of what we believe
[1:16:56] now watch on he says
[1:16:59] if God in the days of John Wesley would
[1:17:02] have done in that day what he has done
[1:17:04] today what would it have done
[1:17:07] in the days of Martin Luther or what
[1:17:10] more
[1:17:10] now watch what he goes in to say as we
[1:17:13] see him doing now that's important him
[1:17:18] doing both proven by the church
[1:17:22] by the Spirit by science and every move
[1:17:26] what are we seeing God proving his word
[1:17:30] through all of these channels
[1:17:34] and this statement I don't I can't
[1:17:36] preach on this side it's a separate
[1:17:38] study but notice this next statement
[1:17:40] it's emotion has to recognize now
[1:17:43] emotion is where you have you have uh uh
[1:17:48] different things that come together and
[1:17:50] you have maybe like different droplets
[1:17:51] of liquid and when they come together
[1:17:53] they do not make one substance
[1:17:57] they remain separate like oil into water
[1:18:01] right you can think of many different
[1:18:03] things like that and it does not make in
[1:18:06] other words blend in to become all the
[1:18:08] same so what brother Branham is saying
[1:18:10] here is that Christ himself has come
[1:18:13] down here Among Us he's not blending in
[1:18:15] with the Creeds and the dogmas and the
[1:18:19] world but he's standing out in the midst
[1:18:22] of it all as the mighty conqueror its
[1:18:25] Emulsion in other words it's not
[1:18:27] blending it was not God coming and
[1:18:29] putting in a man upon the Creeds but he
[1:18:33] was God coming and a Manning his own
[1:18:36] word by vindicating himself to be the
[1:18:39] same just as much as you can look in
[1:18:42] water when you put oil in boiling water
[1:18:44] you can see the oil the oil will move
[1:18:47] around the water and that's what
[1:18:49] Emulsion is that's what the life of
[1:18:52] Jesus Christ is in the Church of the
[1:18:55] Living God you see this is why he comes
[1:18:58] in you and he doesn't change himself he
[1:19:02] doesn't change his nature but he comes
[1:19:04] and changes your nature and it becomes
[1:19:07] the same Jesus on display in a manifold
[1:19:11] many membered body in a variety but the
[1:19:14] same nature being displayed what is it
[1:19:17] it is the Emulsion of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:20] God's own life on display through his
[1:19:23] body
[1:19:25] so now let me keep on reading here
[1:19:28] so its Emulsion has to recognize
[1:19:31] and God's word here declaring it
[1:19:35] and telling it
[1:19:37] before it comes to past
[1:19:39] and then moving upon and prophesying and
[1:19:43] showing the very thing that he said
[1:19:45] it'll come to pass perfectly exactly
[1:19:48] what he said
[1:19:49] now there's no denying that we see God
[1:19:53] right here Among Us
[1:19:56] there's just no there's no denying of
[1:19:59] that right there it's God Among Us it's
[1:20:01] God dealing with your heart God dealing
[1:20:04] with your life God Healing The Sick God
[1:20:06] bringing Deliverance
[1:20:09] come on friends it's just like when you
[1:20:12] bring in new recruits guess what you got
[1:20:14] basic training
[1:20:15] hello somebody
[1:20:19] sometimes the things that maybe you have
[1:20:21] an altogether seen out here but you
[1:20:23] don't know back there in that office
[1:20:25] but God's will deliver no matter where
[1:20:27] he's at
[1:20:30] Hallelujah
[1:20:32] now I want you to catch this and brother
[1:20:34] Brandon says after seeing all this and
[1:20:37] still
[1:20:38] we sit kind of slothful
[1:20:42] as if we wonder
[1:20:44] well wonder if that could mean me
[1:20:48] wonder if it could mean just the church
[1:20:51] in whole or wonder if I'm really
[1:20:53] included in this
[1:20:55] and so brother Brown identifies
[1:20:58] this coming Sunday morning which he's
[1:20:59] going to preach he cares do you care
[1:21:02] he said I'm going to try to talk on some
[1:21:04] of those principles that might Enlighten
[1:21:07] us a little
[1:21:09] now you see Satan's objective is to try
[1:21:12] to keep things obscure
[1:21:15] let me tell you the message of the hour
[1:21:17] is not obscure
[1:21:19] it's the light of almighty God I don't
[1:21:21] care what message you listen to I don't
[1:21:23] care what message you come here and hear
[1:21:24] you're always going to hear it's it is
[1:21:27] that of Christ being veiled in a body
[1:21:29] that of a true experience with God a
[1:21:33] relationship
[1:21:34] are you hearing me we don't have to say
[1:21:36] maybe the exact words but because why
[1:21:39] it's God on display
[1:21:41] you can preach the new birth but if it's
[1:21:44] not God on display then it's only
[1:21:46] talking about something you're reading
[1:21:47] in the word
[1:21:48] but God displays that he is the same God
[1:21:52] and as he displaced himself he's letting
[1:21:55] you and I know this is your personal
[1:21:58] property
[1:22:01] so it's something to give us a greater
[1:22:03] knowledge and understanding in a
[1:22:05] situation and so when we see this I'll
[1:22:09] just say it in this way God's desire is
[1:22:11] that we would walk with and live with a
[1:22:14] true Godly certainty
[1:22:18] in our lives
[1:22:20] we're talking about rapturing faith
[1:22:22] we're talking about faith in to walk as
[1:22:25] a Believer as a son and daughter of God
[1:22:28] God's desires that we would walk with a
[1:22:31] certainty in our life are we going to be
[1:22:34] challenged you will be challenged but
[1:22:36] Faith itself will also grow but there's
[1:22:39] got to come a certainty within our lives
[1:22:42] to where it's not my faith but it's
[1:22:45] God's faith that's operating in other
[1:22:47] words it's God's love that we're
[1:22:49] trusting in
[1:22:51] because we know I I don't just I haven't
[1:22:54] just read about him I know him
[1:22:57] it's not what I can just talk about he
[1:22:59] can do he's done it
[1:23:03] are you with me not like somebody's
[1:23:06] selling lamps and they don't even have
[1:23:07] one of those lamps in their home
[1:23:10] you're talking about somebody because we
[1:23:12] can talk about the word have all the
[1:23:14] dialects and everything down but what
[1:23:16] makes the difference is is to know him
[1:23:18] who is the word
[1:23:22] and then we walk with the certainty to
[1:23:24] where if there's going to be one it's
[1:23:26] going to be me
[1:23:28] if there's one going out of this
[1:23:30] community and here in the church today
[1:23:32] sorry for all the rest of you but I'm
[1:23:34] the one
[1:23:37] I'm the one
[1:23:41] come on Friends
[1:23:43] now I want you to think about this it's
[1:23:45] to live in a manner you see listen let
[1:23:48] me say something you that ain't just a
[1:23:50] quote that's the way you have faced your
[1:23:53] job that's the way you face school
[1:23:54] that's the way you face everything in
[1:23:56] your life if there's one here that's
[1:23:58] ordained to handle this I am that one
[1:24:01] that God has placed here to handle this
[1:24:04] it's not me it's Christ in me I think
[1:24:08] it's not robbery
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:12] that's the kind of Faith we're talking
[1:24:13] about it's not a faith that I'm building
[1:24:16] myself up it's a faith where I'm
[1:24:18] standing on his word and what is
[1:24:20] confirmed to me Beyond even what my
[1:24:23] thoughts because his thoughts are
[1:24:25] overtaking my thoughts
[1:24:28] and then it becomes his thoughts that
[1:24:30] we're expressing like that and you stand
[1:24:32] back and say whoa where did that come
[1:24:34] from and the devil wants to draw you out
[1:24:36] and say yeah you don't want to get all
[1:24:37] puffed up you know how it is you don't
[1:24:39] want to be you know bloated up like this
[1:24:40] or no glory hey I am talking a language
[1:24:42] that belongs to me as a son and daughter
[1:24:45] of God
[1:24:46] and God has given me that language
[1:24:50] that's restored the original language
[1:24:53] [Applause]
[1:24:55] when the Jew
[1:24:57] from Babylon God restored the language
[1:25:00] when the Jews came back in Zion God
[1:25:04] restored the language and God has
[1:25:06] restored the language of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:09] in This Hour to his called out children
[1:25:19] without faith
[1:25:20] familiar scripture
[1:25:22] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:25:24] God and Faith itself is based on
[1:25:27] forgiveness
[1:25:29] that's what it's based on
[1:25:31] now
[1:25:32] instead of our faith would be anointed I
[1:25:35] pray to God that this audience this
[1:25:37] morning
[1:25:38] would be anointed
[1:25:40] with faith
[1:25:43] and that Faith Comes Faith cometh by
[1:25:46] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:25:48] that there's an Evidence
[1:25:50] of himself of his presence right here
[1:25:53] Among Us anointing our faith
[1:25:57] it's pulsating
[1:25:59] to you and I
[1:26:01] because if anything you approach
[1:26:05] if you don't have sufficient faith
[1:26:07] you'll never obtain it
[1:26:11] you've got to have sufficient Faith now
[1:26:14] let me read here in Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:26:19] the Bible said in whom verse 11 and whom
[1:26:21] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:26:23] being predestinated according to the
[1:26:25] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:26:28] after the counsel of his own will
[1:26:31] that we should be to the praise
[1:26:33] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:26:37] in whom ye also trusted
[1:26:41] after that you heard the word of Truth
[1:26:44] The Gospel of your salvation
[1:26:48] see remember Paul in in Romans 10
[1:26:52] how can they hear
[1:26:54] except there be a preacher
[1:26:58] and how can one preach except to be sent
[1:27:03] Paul goes on to say how can they call
[1:27:06] upon Him whom they have not heard
[1:27:12] now the name Jesus is almost synonymous
[1:27:14] among so many churches but we recognize
[1:27:17] that Jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:27:20] and forever
[1:27:22] he is he is revealed as the mighty
[1:27:25] conqueror his Nature has never changed
[1:27:28] his word has never changed he's not an
[1:27:31] ideology of man he is the living person
[1:27:34] of almighty God right here Among Us that
[1:27:37] has made a way in Redemption that you
[1:27:40] and I can come fully back into our
[1:27:43] possession as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:47] is that right
[1:27:49] so when we thank God for this that when
[1:27:51] we can see it in a manner in whom you
[1:27:55] also trusted after that you heard the
[1:27:58] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[1:27:59] salvation so there had to be the
[1:28:01] sounding of the truth the gospel of
[1:28:04] Salvation what is that of Salvation
[1:28:06] letting you know you are free
[1:28:10] a person said but I still have this I
[1:28:13] still have that but the gospel is
[1:28:15] declaring Freedom by the authority of
[1:28:18] the blood that was shed and the Holy
[1:28:20] Spirit is announcing it to do what let
[1:28:23] you know that you don't have to remain
[1:28:26] in the same condition any longer in
[1:28:30] other words the trumpet sounds and says
[1:28:32] it's long enough the freedom you have
[1:28:36] been craving you have been Desiring it's
[1:28:39] here it's here it's him he is your
[1:28:43] freedom
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:48] in whom notice in whom
[1:28:51] so you trusted after you heard it
[1:28:54] in whom also after that you believed
[1:28:58] ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit a
[1:29:01] promise so there must be a word that
[1:29:03] sounds out that makes known the way into
[1:29:07] the promise of almighty God just like
[1:29:10] the trumpet would be blown for the time
[1:29:12] of Jubilee it will let him know you can
[1:29:14] get back to your inheritance when God
[1:29:16] became flesh there was a sounding that
[1:29:19] was even being declared this is the
[1:29:22] acceptable year of the Lord you know
[1:29:24] what was being declared that the pathway
[1:29:26] back into the holist of holies back into
[1:29:30] Glory back into the prince of God it was
[1:29:33] being Vindicated and identified in the
[1:29:36] man Christ Jesus and that was stirring
[1:29:39] the hearts of the people to recognize
[1:29:42] that this now of Jubilee was on once the
[1:29:46] blood was shed now you can go back to
[1:29:49] your inheritance
[1:29:52] see there there's something within you
[1:29:55] that's why you couldn't be satisfied
[1:29:57] here satisfied there even sitting in a
[1:30:00] message Church you can't be satisfied
[1:30:03] with just knowing God sent a prophet
[1:30:05] because you are ordained to dwell in the
[1:30:10] land of promise and the land of promise
[1:30:14] is the word himself the baptism of the
[1:30:18] Holy Ghost
[1:30:20] that's why you can't be satisfied
[1:30:22] anywhere else or anything else you'll
[1:30:25] run yourself miserable listen just save
[1:30:27] the tithe and say devil you ain't gonna
[1:30:29] run me around this mountain no longer
[1:30:32] I'm tired of seeing the same old thing
[1:30:34] saying the same old thing I I'm changing
[1:30:38] my confession
[1:30:40] are you hearing me
[1:30:44] you will see it with the Holy Spirit of
[1:30:46] Promise which is the earnest
[1:30:49] of our inheritance until the Redemption
[1:30:51] of the purchased possession unto the
[1:30:53] praise of his glory now I put my notes
[1:30:56] up here in a minute I want it because I
[1:30:57] got three principles and I don't know if
[1:30:58] I'll get to them today but right out of
[1:31:00] the message he cares to you the first
[1:31:01] principle I'm going to talk about is
[1:31:03] read this is being thoroughly convinced
[1:31:06] that this is God
[1:31:09] and this is his desire for me
[1:31:13] he is manifesting himself and his will
[1:31:17] for my life and my purpose he is here to
[1:31:20] bring my faith to a full reality in him
[1:31:25] and this is some direction don't pay
[1:31:27] attention to anything else
[1:31:30] focus on him
[1:31:34] now and he cared to you let me work with
[1:31:37] this first principle being thoroughly
[1:31:39] convinced
[1:31:41] you got to be thoroughly convinced that
[1:31:42] what is that that's coming with
[1:31:44] sufficient faith
[1:31:46] right
[1:31:48] remember John remember John stood there
[1:31:51] and John got his eye filmed over
[1:31:54] and uh when Jesus
[1:31:57] when the disciples came and Jesus said
[1:32:00] to his disciples
[1:32:01] he said he said
[1:32:03] stay here for this meeting
[1:32:05] and then you watch what God is doing
[1:32:09] the deliverances all those things the
[1:32:11] healing and all that and then that is
[1:32:15] the message I want you to take back to
[1:32:17] John
[1:32:20] what was it it was a living God and John
[1:32:24] knew him
[1:32:25] are you hearing me John knew him John
[1:32:28] had met him and the only thing that
[1:32:30] could encourage John was God himself
[1:32:35] so what John had to do was when they
[1:32:38] stayed around and seen it and they went
[1:32:40] back with the report they went back and
[1:32:42] began to testify of what they saw
[1:32:46] let me tell you friends there's a lot if
[1:32:48] you get your eyes looking everywhere
[1:32:50] else
[1:32:52] you're gonna be down discouraged and
[1:32:54] defeated
[1:32:57] but you you can't you can't be looking
[1:32:59] everywhere else you've got to look unto
[1:33:01] Jesus
[1:33:03] what I'm preaching here this morning is
[1:33:06] because I'm looking unto Jesus
[1:33:08] and God has entrusted me as a steward of
[1:33:12] this house to preach that word of where
[1:33:15] I'm looking unto Jesus this is the
[1:33:17] direction we're going
[1:33:18] [Applause]
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:20] we're not going back we're not staying
[1:33:22] the same we're going on
[1:33:26] Hallelujah

[1:33:38] too because you know
[1:33:45] and I tell you
[1:33:47] yeah we ought to be cheerleaders in a
[1:33:50] sense of saying God what you did for me
[1:33:53] you'll do it for them and we keep
[1:33:54] pressing on individually
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:59] you won't find brother Samuel coming
[1:34:01] with a measuring stick on your life but
[1:34:04] the word will be preached and you will
[1:34:06] allow yourself to evaluate will you do
[1:34:08] that will you allow your word your life
[1:34:10] to say where am I at with the word then
[1:34:13] let the word bring discernment let the
[1:34:16] word bring Deliverance
[1:34:19] speak the word that we go forward
[1:34:27] you say brother Samuel why do you say
[1:34:29] that because I'm not your absolute
[1:34:32] I'm not your Holy Ghost and neither is
[1:34:35] any other man or any other woman in here
[1:34:38] you've got a right to a genuine
[1:34:40] experience
[1:34:44] I'll tell you right now press on with
[1:34:46] all you got
[1:34:48] if you can only we weave this this pinky

[1:34:53] to find out in my heart standing there
[1:34:55] like David saying come on we can take
[1:34:57] this battle they're only waving a pinky
[1:34:59] if they wave a pinky today it'll be the
[1:35:01] whole finger tomorrow from this finger
[1:35:03] to this finger to this finger what is it
[1:35:05] I know that God is able and God is
[1:35:09] present
[1:35:13] to do what he said he would do
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:18] Hallelujah
[1:35:24] but Samuel how can you not give up
[1:35:26] because he never gave up on me
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:33] devils are rich
[1:35:35] and I'm not proud of that
[1:35:38] but teachers in school students that
[1:35:41] knew me wrote me off
[1:35:43] but he didn't
[1:35:46] you couldn't get me off of his book
[1:35:49] and you know what you couldn't get me
[1:35:51] off his mind
[1:35:54] and what he did for me if he did it for
[1:35:56] me
[1:35:58] if he did it for me he'd do it for
[1:36:00] anybody
[1:36:05] are we clear
[1:36:08] well brother Samuel so no no let the
[1:36:10] word as it's coming forth even now and
[1:36:12] in Services if God tarries you let the
[1:36:14] word stand right there before the word
[1:36:16] and let the word be that of the
[1:36:18] measuring in your life don't measure
[1:36:19] yourself compared to anybody else in
[1:36:21] this assembly you measure your life with
[1:36:25] the word because it's your experience
[1:36:29] nobody else has experience
[1:36:32] [Applause]
[1:36:34] if you're moving inch I'm going to say
[1:36:36] glory to God
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:51] now let me
[1:36:53] let me just I wonder I want to read
[1:36:55] these points here I don't know if he
[1:36:57] cares do you is that all right
[1:37:03] now I want you to understand this they
[1:37:06] sang that song how perfect is he Worthy
[1:37:10] because let me say this to you
[1:37:13] the seals have been taken off
[1:37:15] you know what the seals was taken off
[1:37:18] so that we might see Christ
[1:37:20] in Plainview
[1:37:22] the pathway back into the holiest of
[1:37:24] holies to the manifestation of the Sons
[1:37:27] and Daughters of God
[1:37:28] we couldn't see our way there without
[1:37:32] him coming and loosening
[1:37:38] is certain Isaiah they delivered to the
[1:37:41] they delivered the book to him that's
[1:37:43] unlearned he that was unlearned said I
[1:37:45] can't read it I'm not learned and so
[1:37:48] they delivered it to him that was
[1:37:49] learned and he that was learned said I
[1:37:51] can't read it because the words of this
[1:37:53] book are as the words of a book that is
[1:37:55] sealed
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:38:03] thank you
[1:38:08] but he
[1:38:10] has taken the seals
[1:38:13] off of himself
[1:38:14] [Applause]
[1:38:17] he's taken the seals off of your life
[1:38:20] if you let him he'll break every seal of
[1:38:23] unbelief
[1:38:25] he'll take every seal away of wondering
[1:38:29] and I wonder if this could be me and
[1:38:31] well I was raised in this and the devil
[1:38:33] said yeah you know it was only
[1:38:34] happenstance and it was only by chance
[1:38:36] you were here and you've been raised in
[1:38:38] this all along but you need to have a
[1:38:40] declaration of your heart I'm not here
[1:38:43] by chance
[1:38:46] I've been told you were a mistake you're
[1:38:48] not a mistake
[1:38:51] you're here by Design
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:38:58] every word of God every promise of God
[1:39:00] belongs to you
[1:39:04] this message came for you this message
[1:39:07] is about you
[1:39:10] Hallelujah you believe that this message
[1:39:13] is for you
[1:39:22] [Music]
[1:39:26] Hallelujah
[1:39:28] I want to let it go just let it go
[1:39:31] lay it aside right now lay it aside
[1:39:46] it broke the covering
[1:39:49] that then releases
[1:39:51] God's nature
[1:39:53] God's life
[1:39:55] to work
[1:39:56] among the church
[1:39:58] in the church and in our lives
[1:40:01] to Break about
[1:40:03] because of nobody
[1:40:05] and we're living in a day
[1:40:07] where there's so many false promises
[1:40:09] is that right how many women brother
[1:40:11] Brown said he thought he was going to be
[1:40:12] a hero when he got home because he found
[1:40:14] a he's in a detergent on a commercial in
[1:40:16] a hotel room and you know dip the egg in
[1:40:19] there
[1:40:20] foreign
[1:40:25] came out
[1:40:27] still eggy
[1:40:30] gifted again
[1:40:31] still eggy
[1:40:34] that's man
[1:40:35] let me tell you something
[1:40:37] you know why that's about
[1:40:40] because that's the way that the gospel
[1:40:42] has been treated
[1:40:45] you we may think commercials and that is
[1:40:47] so separate it comes together you can't
[1:40:50] come to that standard of lying unless
[1:40:53] there's false being presented
[1:40:56] come on now you can't come to that it
[1:40:58] all starts they want to talk about
[1:40:59] juvenile delinquency parent delinquency
[1:41:01] Pulpit delinquency Pulpit delinquency is
[1:41:04] where it first starts
[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:06] because it establishes true headship
[1:41:08] coming on down his life flowing on down
[1:41:12] so all these promises all these promises
[1:41:15] well you know it belong to this or
[1:41:17] belong to that and Below I'm not against
[1:41:19] anything that could help somebody I'm
[1:41:21] not against that but there's nothing
[1:41:24] that can clean can I say it like this
[1:41:26] the egg off of a life
[1:41:30] like the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:35] let me tell you something not only did
[1:41:36] the blood do away with every stain it
[1:41:39] does away with every desire
[1:41:42] [Applause]
[1:41:47] now let me read this quote and you'll
[1:41:50] see how God breaks this Veil it's
[1:41:53] obscurity this darkness in this hour
[1:41:55] regarding around that of sincerity but
[1:41:58] the Bible says people don't get down to
[1:42:00] that real colonel
[1:42:02] of sincerity
[1:42:04] he says the very English word of
[1:42:06] sincerity has lost its value to the
[1:42:08] people
[1:42:09] it's by the way of people of living it's
[1:42:12] lost sincerity to them and they don't
[1:42:14] seem to understand
[1:42:17] and it goes on to talk about even to our
[1:42:19] confessions and I'm going to get to that
[1:42:21] maybe not this service but notice he
[1:42:24] goes on to say
[1:42:26] unless paragraph 62 and I want you just
[1:42:29] to everybody okay
[1:42:31] this is a this is a principle right here
[1:42:33] of Deliverance
[1:42:35] unless you are deeply sincere
[1:42:38] and you cannot be sincere until you're
[1:42:43] positive understand
[1:42:46] right now when we talk let me just he's
[1:42:49] going to deal with this understanding
[1:42:50] here because understanding is not that
[1:42:52] you become a Bible scholar
[1:42:54] the boy I'm able to that's not what he's
[1:42:56] talking about
[1:42:57] remember the scripture said
[1:43:00] he that uh heareth my words and
[1:43:04] believeth on me
[1:43:06] shall have everlasting life
[1:43:09] right brother man will pick that up
[1:43:11] throughout the message
[1:43:13] in Satan's Eden in other places and he
[1:43:15] says to hear it means to understand it
[1:43:19] he said because a prostitute can hear it
[1:43:22] and remain a prostitute
[1:43:24] a drunkard could hear it and remain a
[1:43:26] drunkard but he said when that begins to
[1:43:29] fall upon a sea it's something different
[1:43:31] here hey man there's something touching
[1:43:34] my life that's different this is not
[1:43:37] aware there's like somebody that's right
[1:43:40] down in my Pew right down in my life
[1:43:46] what is it it's understanding we are in
[1:43:50] the presence of almighty God
[1:43:56] and you can recognize that when you're
[1:43:58] in his presence what I do just draw on
[1:44:01] him
[1:44:02] you recognize his presence go ahead
[1:44:05] release Lord this is what I need in my
[1:44:08] life
[1:44:10] [Applause]
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:15] brother Samuel I don't feel worthy throw
[1:44:18] that blind devil down
[1:44:24] throw him down I'm telling you by the
[1:44:26] word of the Lord throw him down
[1:44:28] if there's something that's out of light
[1:44:30] right here just throw it out of your
[1:44:31] heart what are you doing I'm siding with
[1:44:33] the word of God
[1:44:37] you cannot be sincere until you're
[1:44:40] positive you understand
[1:44:42] now remember
[1:44:44] also talked about you can be sincere
[1:44:47] and sincerely wrong
[1:44:50] right so we want to establish a
[1:44:52] difference
[1:44:55] we're talking about a sincerity that's a
[1:44:57] condition of the heart
[1:45:01] because when they threw brother Brahm
[1:45:02] tells us when they threw them babies in
[1:45:04] Egypt into the alligators he said they
[1:45:06] were sincere
[1:45:08] they were feeding those Gods that's what
[1:45:09] they were believed
[1:45:13] the Buddhist they're sincere when they
[1:45:15] approach yeah right
[1:45:18] so sincerity alone won't do it
[1:45:20] it's got to be sincerity according to
[1:45:24] the word
[1:45:27] God giving a direction a principle into
[1:45:29] deliverance and you cannot be sincere
[1:45:31] until you're positive you understand if
[1:45:33] you're presuming or guessing or hoping
[1:45:35] so then there cannot be a depth of
[1:45:38] sincerity that God requires
[1:45:40] if faith if faith is not a hope so or it
[1:45:44] could be right it's got to be absolutely
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:49] it's your ultimate it's your absolute
[1:45:51] it's the thing that you're tied to you
[1:45:55] have to come to your ultimate that it is
[1:45:58] the truth and it's nothing but the truth
[1:46:01] and it must be thus
[1:46:06] the same here what are we talking about
[1:46:08] that this is the truth what are we
[1:46:11] speaking about that he the person of
[1:46:14] truth that his life being veiled in a
[1:46:17] life to change it from Death unto life
[1:46:20] that he would manifest himself to be the
[1:46:23] same yesterday today and forever that he
[1:46:25] takes the nature that old carnal sticky
[1:46:29] nature that loves the world and the
[1:46:31] things of the world that God will come
[1:46:33] down and perform an operation and change
[1:46:35] that life and bring forth a saint out of
[1:46:40] a life that had been so black and so
[1:46:42] mocked up with sin
[1:46:44] there's got to be an ultimate something
[1:46:47] that you can tie to and say this is the
[1:46:52] truth
[1:46:52] [Applause]
[1:46:54] and this is for me
[1:47:00] if you see it
[1:47:03] are you hearing me blessing are your
[1:47:05] eyes that see it
[1:47:07] and blessed is your heart that that
[1:47:09] stirs on the inside that says that's me
[1:47:12] that's for me there's something what is
[1:47:15] that that's a deposit of God and it's
[1:47:18] God moving upon a deposit he placed in
[1:47:22] your life like a magnet that's sweeping
[1:47:25] by the angel of the Lord sweeping by
[1:47:34] so in other words the Holy Ghost is not
[1:47:37] a maybe soul my Deliverance is not a
[1:47:40] hope so it might be it is a certainty
[1:47:50] brother REM could say and over and over
[1:47:52] he says has he ever said anything and it
[1:47:56] not be done
[1:47:59] amazing
[1:48:02] he's proving himself all of that every
[1:48:05] bit of the prayer line was proving God's
[1:48:09] word that he's the same and he delivers
[1:48:12] a real true experience
[1:48:22] now here's the thing
[1:48:24] and then when you realize that in your
[1:48:26] mind
[1:48:28] then you've got to approach it
[1:48:30] with your whole life
[1:48:33] so now once you realize it you've got to
[1:48:35] approach it with you now this this
[1:48:37] becomes into our hands we've got to
[1:48:39] approach it with our whole life remember
[1:48:41] not a so far
[1:48:43] Samson gave God his strength
[1:48:47] right gave Delilah his heart
[1:48:50] he had a so far
[1:48:53] but we don't believe in so far religion
[1:48:56] you might as well let it be resolved in
[1:48:57] your heart I'm not a so far Christian
[1:49:00] brother Samuel I've been so far but so
[1:49:02] far has been so far now is different
[1:49:05] you make a declaration in your heart
[1:49:07] right now I'm not going to be a so far
[1:49:10] Christian
[1:49:11] I'm not gonna live beneath my privileges
[1:49:13] I am not going to sit here and be robbed
[1:49:15] any longer
[1:49:18] I'm going to get into the land and enjoy
[1:49:21] my inheritance
[1:49:23] I'm going to enjoy my Liberty and I'm
[1:49:26] going to enjoy my freedom
[1:49:29] I'm going all the way
[1:49:32] my mind just made up
[1:49:35] then you approach it with your whole
[1:49:37] life
[1:49:38] soul body all that's in you just
[1:49:42] completely sell out
[1:49:44] everything to it
[1:49:47] now he picks up I don't have time to
[1:49:48] read it but out of Matthew 13 he picks
[1:49:50] up where One Of The Parables of the
[1:49:52] Kingdom of Heaven where a man had many
[1:49:55] pearls but then he found the pearl of
[1:49:57] great price and he sold all of the other
[1:49:59] pearls to get this Pearl
[1:50:01] now the rest of them were pearls
[1:50:03] was that right I mean he didn't have
[1:50:05] rocks
[1:50:06] he had pearls
[1:50:08] and brother Bram calls those pearls that
[1:50:09] he had truths
[1:50:12] he had truths
[1:50:15] truth I'm gonna read it to you he had
[1:50:16] truths but once he found the pearl of
[1:50:19] great prize he sown all of the truths
[1:50:21] for that Pearl because why the Peril is
[1:50:25] the way the truth and the life
[1:50:31] Hallelujah
[1:50:32] and Jesus so bracely taught us in the
[1:50:35] man buying pearls I'm just going to read
[1:50:36] it he found the one of great price and
[1:50:38] he sold all his others to get it all the
[1:50:41] truths and everything that he had though
[1:50:43] they were good pearls this one meant all
[1:50:47] to him
[1:50:52] there's been truth down Through the Ages
[1:50:55] that means there's been truths scattered
[1:50:57] in through other in through other
[1:50:59] churches right
[1:51:00] and and thank God for truth I mean you
[1:51:02] might have had your start in a Baptist
[1:51:04] Church of Pentecost I don't know
[1:51:05] wherever you might you might have you're
[1:51:06] starting a Catholic Church
[1:51:08] right
[1:51:10] but there's something that wouldn't let
[1:51:12] you stay
[1:51:14] [Music]
[1:51:16] because you know why
[1:51:19] he always belonged to God
[1:51:22] and what I'm talking about belonging to
[1:51:24] God I'm talking about you as one of his
[1:51:26] children
[1:51:28] you belong to dwell in the promised land
[1:51:31] That's why nothing else could satisfy
[1:51:34] you
[1:51:35] good people good truth but there's
[1:51:37] something about it said this is good but
[1:51:40] it's got to be something more
[1:51:42] I'm looking for something more I say
[1:51:44] what is that that's what David said
[1:51:46] there's a deep call it to the deep and
[1:51:50] if there's a deep that's calling there's
[1:51:52] a deep to respond
[1:51:56] I say there's more of God for you
[1:52:00] [Applause]
[1:52:10] when you find God's ultimate
[1:52:15] his word
[1:52:17] a promise Upon A Certain thing
[1:52:21] you must know first that it is God's
[1:52:23] word
[1:52:27] you find the promise of the Holy Ghost I
[1:52:30] want you to watch here right now put
[1:52:32] your thoughts aside and let God's
[1:52:34] thoughts permeate
[1:52:36] it's no first that it's God's word not
[1:52:39] know first or allow reasoning to enter
[1:52:42] in it may not be for me or I've tried
[1:52:45] over and over but the promise is yea and
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] God has spoken who can but prophesy
[1:52:56] God ain't a man that he should lie or
[1:52:59] the son of man that he should repent
[1:53:03] every word of God is yea and amen
[1:53:07] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:53:10] words shall never fail
[1:53:16] what do I do shout out your reasoning
[1:53:20] let the word override every thought
[1:53:26] let me just say something to you not to
[1:53:28] take your mind off track but I know
[1:53:30] sometimes when I have to look back at
[1:53:31] videos I know I'm an ugly looking God I
[1:53:33] make ugly faces when I preach but don't
[1:53:35] look at my ugly face and don't say man
[1:53:37] he must be mad at me there's one person
[1:53:39] I'm mad at and that's a devil
[1:53:46] and I don't like it when he picks on
[1:53:48] God's children
[1:53:51] he's got God on his hands when he picks
[1:53:54] on God's children I don't like it either
[1:53:58] because you're made to live free you're
[1:54:00] made to live in Liberty
[1:54:04] and we're going all the way
[1:54:08] we're going all the way
[1:54:10] we're not leaving hook behind not one
[1:54:13] part of my life outside from under the
[1:54:16] blood I'm going all the way
[1:54:21] all the way
[1:54:25] [Applause]
[1:54:28] God's word being the ultimate has
[1:54:31] nothing to do with your failures
[1:54:38] it has to do with we get started looking
[1:54:41] at all my reasoning look at everything
[1:54:42] else let the word be your focus looking
[1:54:46] unto Jesus
[1:54:50] the author and finisher of your faith
[1:54:55] the same yard
[1:54:57] that brought you out of Egypt
[1:55:01] the same God who's LED you and cared for
[1:55:05] you the same God when the enemy trying
[1:55:08] to overtake you he came between you and
[1:55:11] the enemy
[1:55:14] that same God he's letting you know if
[1:55:18] God be for us
[1:55:20] who can be against us
[1:55:23] [Applause]
[1:55:27] by the time we need to get the other
[1:55:28] points if I go to the other points and
[1:55:30] this isn't established the other points
[1:55:32] mean nothing
[1:55:33] because he that cometh to God must first
[1:55:36] believe that he is and that is a
[1:55:39] rewarder
[1:55:40] of them that diligently seek him
[1:55:47] Hallelujah
[1:55:53] his word is a promise of a certain thing
[1:55:55] you must know first that it's God's word
[1:55:58] that the thing that you're seeing I want
[1:56:01] you to watch the thing that you're
[1:56:03] seeing being done is God
[1:56:08] we can go through lives being changed
[1:56:10] we just had a testimony last week God
[1:56:12] taking cancer off another there's more
[1:56:14] I've got had to restart and listening to
[1:56:16] certain things out I forget about some
[1:56:17] of you remember have better memory of me
[1:56:19] I I I just to me things God is doing
[1:56:22] right now sometimes it's not even here
[1:56:24] in church it's among his people that's
[1:56:27] why there's testimonies
[1:56:30] you know what that's about that's to
[1:56:33] build our faith
[1:56:36] God took down some Kings before they
[1:56:39] went over in the land
[1:56:41] God went up against some kings that
[1:56:43] raised up in Rebellion God knew they'd
[1:56:46] rebelled
[1:56:49] and the Holy Spirit he knows that
[1:56:51] Devil's going to try to Rebel he'll try
[1:56:54] to raise up he'll try to dig his feet in
[1:56:56] but he's no match for the Holy Ghost
[1:57:02] and you know what God's doing he's taken
[1:57:04] down one king after another you know why
[1:57:07] he's doing that he's doing that for you
[1:57:08] that's for your life that's for your
[1:57:11] personal testimony he's taken things out
[1:57:13] of your life one step at a time it may
[1:57:16] not be all at once but if he does one
[1:57:18] thing rejoice and look for him to do
[1:57:20] more and expect him to do more
[1:57:27] Hallelujah
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:36] there's no maybe so
[1:57:39] it could be it looks like it might be it
[1:57:44] is God
[1:57:46] man
[1:57:50] and I said to you the promise is unto
[1:57:53] you
[1:57:57] amen as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:57:59] call
[1:58:00] you might have been brought here as a
[1:58:02] young person
[1:58:04] sure
[1:58:05] you might have heard about this even
[1:58:07] years and years ago
[1:58:08] but why are you here this morning
[1:58:13] [Music]
[1:58:14] why are you here this morning I'll tell
[1:58:16] you why there's a call of God upon your
[1:58:18] life
[1:58:20] brother Samuel that's being awful
[1:58:21] assertive let me tell you something I've
[1:58:23] got a right to say about the authority
[1:58:25] of God's word I'm called to preach a
[1:58:27] bride message with a true experience of
[1:58:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:58:31] care what situations look like God is a
[1:58:33] god of paradoxes he's more than enough
[1:58:35] he can take an unbeliever and make a
[1:58:37] Believer out of them God can take a
[1:58:39] make-believer make a Believer out of it
[1:58:41] God will take a Critic and make a Critic
[1:58:43] stand up and testify I was once a critic
[1:58:46] but now I'm standing as a witness
[1:58:51] there's no limitations to God
[1:58:56] Hallelujah God he's a god of paradoxes
[1:59:00] he opened the Red Sea he opened the
[1:59:02] Jordan
[1:59:03] he's open blind eyes
[1:59:06] he's healed the sick he's delivered
[1:59:11] and that same God it ought to be enough
[1:59:13] that we rise and say I'm convinced
[1:59:18] [Applause]
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:21] it's God
[1:59:24] then what give everything you've got
[1:59:26] [Applause]
[1:59:28] give her don't hold nothing back
[1:59:31] remember cast down that reasoning cast
[1:59:34] down imagination cast it down
[1:59:37] let the word have preeminence in your
[1:59:39] life let the word lead you all the way
[1:59:42] because it's our thinking that's got us
[1:59:44] in the places we're at right now but let
[1:59:46] the thoughts in the mind of Christ of
[1:59:48] what God you want to know what God
[1:59:50] thinks about you he's letting you know
[1:59:51] right now this is what he thinks about
[1:59:53] you you belong to him you've always
[1:59:56] belonged to him yours and inheritance
[1:59:58] for you in the promised land this
[2:00:01] message not against you this message has
[2:00:03] come to lift you
[2:00:06] in position
[2:00:11] it's a principle of Deliverance
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:22] I'm just gonna have to stop
[2:00:32] two more principles I want to get to
[2:00:33] here
[2:00:34] but this is the first one and it's very
[2:00:36] important let me tell you this
[2:00:38] but God is doing he's doing it with you
[2:00:41] and me in mind
[2:00:43] give everything you've got to him
[2:00:47] laid down in a repentance unto him if
[2:00:50] there's something that's a besetting sin
[2:00:52] habit something that's taken hold and
[2:00:55] it's there it seems like it's linger lay
[2:00:57] it aside
[2:01:00] do you realize who's given you the
[2:01:02] authority to do that
[2:01:04] that's him who ascended on high over
[2:01:07] every principality and Power
[2:01:13] it's him who's in our midst
[2:01:16] it's God
[2:01:27] I'm so tempted to go to that second
[2:01:29] principle
[2:01:30] now maybe it's long but
[2:01:34] just touch real quick I'm not going to
[2:01:36] preach you
[2:01:37] but here's the second principle just a
[2:01:39] little bit of a foretaste
[2:01:41] well you pull that pull that up Sister
[2:01:43] Brian I haven't listed their second
[2:01:44] principle
[2:01:46] is she back there
[2:01:48] second principle
[2:01:49] what's up thank you okay
[2:01:52] this is my words
[2:01:54] here's the second principle this is what
[2:01:55] brother Bram goes into
[2:01:57] get away from all unbelief
[2:01:59] [Music]
[2:02:02] get away from all unbelief means every
[2:02:04] voice that speaks contrary
[2:02:12] 10 opposing voices did in the camp when
[2:02:15] they said we can't go up they're bigger
[2:02:17] than us they're do this they do that do
[2:02:19] that you know what it caused a wailing
[2:02:21] and a weeping they were a bunch of
[2:02:22] mourners
[2:02:24] oh we're just dead Men You're Not Dead
[2:02:28] brought you out by the blood of the Lamb
[2:02:30] [Applause]
[2:02:32] we're nothing but grasshoppers in their
[2:02:34] sight that's a lie
[2:02:36] that was in their mind
[2:02:39] have you forgot who brought you out have
[2:02:42] you forgot who started the work in your
[2:02:44] life if God before us who can be against
[2:02:47] us
[2:02:47] [Applause]
[2:02:54] that's worth putting on the refrigerator
[2:02:57] and rubbing his nose in every single
[2:02:59] moment
[2:03:04] get away from all unbelief you must
[2:03:06] separate yourself and you do that by
[2:03:09] obedience to the word of God
[2:03:11] Lord I'm going to obey your word
[2:03:15] I might still feel it here in my heart
[2:03:18] but you say God I am I've heard you I've
[2:03:21] recognized that you and I'm going to act
[2:03:23] on your word I'm laying it down I'm
[2:03:26] stepping aside Lord cleanse the desire
[2:03:29] out of my life who are you asking to
[2:03:32] cleanse the desire the same God who
[2:03:34] raises the Dead the same God who heals
[2:03:37] cancer the same God who has testimony
[2:03:39] sitting around that our spokesman
[2:03:42] testimony is to say what he did for me
[2:03:44] he'll do it for you he's never lost his
[2:03:47] power
[2:03:48] [Applause]
[2:03:55] but the same you don't know how long
[2:03:56] I've been around it well then God's just
[2:03:59] got a testimony for you and God's going
[2:04:01] to work a testimony in your life to come
[2:04:02] right back and somebody else might be
[2:04:04] sitting there and they'll be under that
[2:04:05] old cloud of Gloom I've been here so
[2:04:07] long and you'll be one to be able to
[2:04:09] stand up and say hey wait a minute that
[2:04:11] that thought once was around me but I'm
[2:04:13] a witness
[2:04:15] I thought I had went past my day of
[2:04:17] Grace I thought I had sinned it away I
[2:04:20] thought there was no for me but look
[2:04:22] what God has done in my life
[2:04:25] [Applause]
[2:04:31] get away from so far religionist
[2:04:35] oh and you're just all right you're
[2:04:37] doing it get away from every voice
[2:04:40] and just be locked in on the voice of
[2:04:42] God
[2:04:48] devil said well you're only worked up
[2:04:51] that ain't God telling you that
[2:05:00] Hallelujah
[2:05:03] it's simple action upon the word of God
[2:05:06] it's sell out everything
[2:05:10] brother saying if I could right now I'd
[2:05:12] pause and have you come up here and give
[2:05:13] your testimony
[2:05:14] but if you don't mind if I can just kind
[2:05:16] of walk through because it was a lot
[2:05:17] like mine too
[2:05:21] but the Shane gave that testimony and I
[2:05:23] wasn't going to do this but it just
[2:05:24] comes to me is that all right
[2:05:26] but the same when he spoke here to the
[2:05:27] young people here the the other Friday
[2:05:29] going now
[2:05:30] some things that I wanted him to
[2:05:32] just said press on my heart from the
[2:05:34] previous youth meeting
[2:05:36] but Shane began to speak about doors
[2:05:39] and he said you know there were a lot of
[2:05:40] doors he he laid it out like it was in
[2:05:42] in my house he said there was a lot of
[2:05:44] doors in my life I had a door of music
[2:05:47] a door of relationships in the world a
[2:05:49] door of this and door of that
[2:05:51] and he said
[2:05:54] but I had to let God
[2:05:56] go into each door
[2:06:00] eventually
[2:06:02] as he invited God and letting God go
[2:06:04] into the door on his music
[2:06:06] God took away the music
[2:06:12] then God went into the relationships
[2:06:16] praise God
[2:06:17] but Samuel was it all like this no
[2:06:21] but it didn't listen to me it doesn't
[2:06:23] mean that things can't be like that can
[2:06:25] I preach just a moment
[2:06:30] if for your life and your experience is
[2:06:32] just like this I'll say glory to God
[2:06:36] your experience is like this this this
[2:06:39] this this this I'll say glory to God
[2:06:41] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[2:06:42] glory to God glory to God glory to God
[2:06:46] be like David shouting through
[2:06:52] we're one step closer glass coming down
[2:06:55] [Applause]
[2:07:00] but doors after doors after doors
[2:07:04] remember how God took things out of my
[2:07:05] life
[2:07:07] it was door after door after door
[2:07:11] brother Bram explains that perfectly in
[2:07:13] the message the Messiah in 1961 he says
[2:07:15] it's that little white button coming in
[2:07:17] and it's God taking over
[2:07:20] letting God have the right of way
[2:07:24] it's selling out everything that's what
[2:07:26] selling out everything means that's what
[2:07:27] surrendering means just inviting God in
[2:07:30] it's like if I invited you in and made
[2:07:33] you stand on the doormat right there
[2:07:34] welcome
[2:07:36] like I told the young people I said you
[2:07:38] know we're in here and you could hear us
[2:07:40] they're praying over Pizza
[2:07:43] they're getting pizza I said only thing
[2:07:45] you would do is hear the sounds from
[2:07:47] what was behind the curtain I mean what
[2:07:49] was in other parts of the house
[2:07:51] you would only have to you would only be
[2:07:52] guessing that because you wouldn't be
[2:07:53] seeing it it's about the same as he got
[2:07:55] cheese pizza and said pepperoni you
[2:07:57] wouldn't know
[2:07:58] because you're only on the welcome mat
[2:08:02] so you welcome him in as your savior
[2:08:05] but he wants to be Lord
[2:08:09] and that's where you invite him to every
[2:08:11] room
[2:08:12] in your house
[2:08:14] and you let him take over
[2:08:20] that's why I said you don't compare
[2:08:22] yourself to nobody else in this church
[2:08:24] you compare yourself to the word that's
[2:08:26] being preached
[2:08:28] are you hearing me
[2:08:30] because God is moving us onward
[2:08:35] Hallelujah let's just bear our heads
[2:08:40] now just say it like this we couldn't
[2:08:42] even get into that spot but I believe we
[2:08:44] got to where God wants us today and
[2:08:47] he knows he knows
[2:08:51] very very important the principle to
[2:08:53] recognize it's him and his desire for me
[2:08:58] his desire for me is that he would dwell
[2:09:00] in me
[2:09:02] he would live he would walk in my life
[2:09:05] he would influence my life
[2:09:07] it would be that that transformation it
[2:09:09] would be that of victory
[2:09:11] unto victory
[2:09:13] it's his desire
[2:09:15] to bring healing to every part of your
[2:09:17] life
[2:09:18] first in part to your soul and to
[2:09:20] everything else
[2:09:22] he's he's the Healer
[2:09:24] there's no limitations to him
[2:09:27] and the second principle to it once you
[2:09:29] recognize that here it's him
[2:09:32] then he's the one that makes you aware
[2:09:35] of anything that's contrary to him
[2:09:38] it's not a man shaming you it's not a
[2:09:42] man condemning you
[2:09:43] it's the conviction of the Holy Spirit
[2:09:46] but the same what do I do move upon that
[2:09:49] conviction respond to the conviction of
[2:09:52] the Holy Spirit and watch the grace that
[2:09:54] brought conviction
[2:09:56] bring
[2:09:57] Deliverance
[2:10:00] act upon it stand with the words stand
[2:10:03] Lord
[2:10:05] I Repent Lord I Give Myself fully to you
[2:10:09] I lay down every thought I lay down all
[2:10:11] my ideas I lay down my reasoning I laid
[2:10:13] down my imagination
[2:10:15] don't even have an imagination about the
[2:10:18] Holy Ghost
[2:10:19] just let him be him
[2:10:23] let him do what he does because he
[2:10:26] testifies of all his works
[2:10:31] say Lord
[2:10:35] with our heads bound how many could say
[2:10:37] Lord I recognize it's you
[2:10:39] now you might be sitting here this
[2:10:40] morning no doubt because every one of us
[2:10:42] are in different Journeys different
[2:10:43] spots on our journey
[2:10:45] but for whatever your need is this
[2:10:46] morning it's important you recognize
[2:10:48] that he's still God
[2:10:51] you might be praying about your children
[2:10:52] it might be healing it might be
[2:10:54] Deliverance it might be for the holy
[2:10:56] ghost in your life
[2:10:57] but it's important you recognize this is
[2:10:59] God
[2:11:00] this is the god of paradoxes this is the
[2:11:03] Living God this is an ultimate that I
[2:11:05] can take and say this is positive he's a
[2:11:08] living God he's my God
[2:11:12] and stand upon that
[2:11:15] many say that
[2:11:17] I recognize that it's God
[2:11:19] it's for me it's God
[2:11:23] now whatever it is
[2:11:26] that's contrary
[2:11:28] to what God has revealed
[2:11:32] would you just be able with an authority
[2:11:34] right now to act upon his authorities
[2:11:35] say I lay that aside because part of the
[2:11:38] laying of Assad it actually is a
[2:11:40] repentance or a denouncing and a
[2:11:42] standing with him
[2:11:45] maybe it's been an attitude
[2:11:47] maybe a bad attitude maybe fear maybe
[2:11:49] doubt maybe whatever I don't know
[2:11:51] healing we can go on but he's personal
[2:11:55] if it would help you for me to call it
[2:11:56] out he'll give it to me but I don't
[2:11:58] believe you need that I believe he's
[2:11:59] worked with you and me in a personal way
[2:12:01] here this morning
[2:12:03] that you can say I denounce everything
[2:12:06] contrary to the voice of God that's
[2:12:09] speaking to my life
[2:12:13] this is a principle
[2:12:15] of Deliverance
[2:12:17] it's approaching god with sincerity
[2:12:19] because you could go out of here after
[2:12:21] hearing everything
[2:12:22] and you'd walk out the same way but
[2:12:24] you've got to make there's got to be
[2:12:25] decisions that are made
[2:12:27] there's got to be something where you
[2:12:29] say I'm going Lord by your help I Lay My
[2:12:32] Life down it's I it's you now I give
[2:12:33] everything all all but I am my soul my
[2:12:36] everything I give myself to you Lord I
[2:12:39] want you to overtake my life Lord
[2:12:44] I can't get to it this morning on a
[2:12:46] confession of real repentance but that
[2:12:48] there's a real repentance there's a real
[2:12:50] confession there's a siding with a word
[2:12:52] of almighty God
[2:12:54] but let it be in your heart right now
[2:12:58] if it's a habit
[2:13:00] let's lay it aside
[2:13:02] if it's a weight you've been carrying
[2:13:05] let's lay it aside
[2:13:10] Heavenly Father
[2:13:13] Lord as we bow our hearts in your
[2:13:16] presence
[2:13:20] I'm Lord I am
[2:13:22] I'm satisfied lordy
[2:13:25] even though Lord in my heart I would
[2:13:27] love to just
[2:13:28] deliver everything Lord that you've
[2:13:30] placed on my heart but
[2:13:32] in one way it has and in another way
[2:13:35] Lord
[2:13:36] you've brought us the Lord what was
[2:13:38] needed for this moment
[2:13:43] uh Lord I I thank you for that
[2:13:47] and I thank you Lord that you would just
[2:13:50] even while the word's been going forth
[2:13:53] you've been moving Lord
[2:13:56] the angel of the Lord is here
[2:13:59] in our midst
[2:14:02] and Lord it's you that's moving
[2:14:05] speaking to our hearts
[2:14:07] encouraging us
[2:14:10] with a faith to approach
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:13] every promise of God
[2:14:17] promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:21] the promise of healing
[2:14:24] promise of salvation
[2:14:26] promise of Deliverance
[2:14:30] every
[2:14:32] promise
[2:14:33] in the book is mine
[2:14:37] and you said Lord in your word
[2:14:41] blessed are they that do hunger and
[2:14:43] thirst for righteousness
[2:14:46] for they shall be filled
[2:14:50] no maybes no might Bees No matso shall
[2:14:56] be filled
[2:15:00] Lord I pray God even here this morning
[2:15:04] for every Hungry Heart
[2:15:08] Lord every heart that would just
[2:15:11] in Simplicity and in real sincerity
[2:15:17] just to prostrate themselves before you
[2:15:21] Lord to lay the life down
[2:15:25] say Lord I lay
[2:15:26] my life down
[2:15:29] before you
[2:15:32] I lay it Lord God let the fire come upon
[2:15:37] the altar
[2:15:38] let it consume
[2:15:41] let it burn out every desire
[2:15:44] let it burn out everything that's
[2:15:46] unpleasing the Lord to you
[2:15:50] to where there's nothing left
[2:15:54] but a Son of God or a daughter of God
[2:15:57] consume all the world Lord
[2:16:02] I'm taking my way with the Lord's
[2:16:05] despised View
[2:16:08] like Moses
[2:16:10] a choice is made
[2:16:13] granted Lord here this morning
[2:16:16] I pray that God that may there be more
[2:16:19] doors
[2:16:22] that are opened in lives
[2:16:25] more rooms
[2:16:30] that God that you become occupied
[2:16:32] maybe it's in dress maybe it's in music
[2:16:36] maybe it's in the door of pride maybe
[2:16:39] it's in the door of passion
[2:16:40] God may you move Lord for every door
[2:16:44] maybe it's that door of self
[2:16:47] God
[2:16:50] we invite you to every door Lord
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:16:58] come Lord Jesus
[2:17:03] come feel Lord every life
[2:17:07] may it be Lord at this moment that every
[2:17:09] heart where it's settled it's upon you
[2:17:11] Lord
[2:17:12] and I'm going to give all that I am
[2:17:15] giving all of my life flinging all it
[2:17:17] down nothing matters
[2:17:19] besides him
[2:17:22] all of my wants
[2:17:26] I'm only empty I need him
[2:17:31] granted Lord this morning
[2:17:36] as the heart Rises into that Lord It's
[2:17:39] realize it's long enough
[2:17:43] to realize Lord
[2:17:46] I pray that
[2:17:49] you'll fill every vessel Lord
[2:17:54] and I pray God that you give every one
[2:17:57] of us a fresh refilling
[2:18:01] Lord I need a fresh refilling right here
[2:18:03] this morning
[2:18:05] yesterday or the day before that ain't
[2:18:07] good enough I need afresh
[2:18:10] killing and a fresh refilling Lord
[2:18:17] granted Lord
[2:18:20] a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit
[2:18:25] got a restoring of the joy of thy
[2:18:29] salvation
[2:18:34] oh God for any heart that's lost that
[2:18:36] the joyous departed from their life
[2:18:39] may they see the Lord
[2:18:43] may they look and recognize
[2:18:46] you can restore it right now but it's
[2:18:49] also important to recognize that that
[2:18:52] Joy
[2:18:54] begin to
[2:18:56] leak away
[2:18:58] little
[2:18:59] by little
[2:19:01] by little by little by little it's a
[2:19:04] little foxes that spoiled the blind
[2:19:07] the Vine
[2:19:08] just start getting your attention on
[2:19:10] other things
[2:19:11] and you know
[2:19:13] the world can never bring you lasting
[2:19:16] Joy
[2:19:18] it's from one event to the next from one
[2:19:21] thing to the next that's the world
[2:19:24] but you were meant to live with the joy
[2:19:29] of the Salvation of the Lord
[2:19:33] remember what he did for you quick
[2:19:36] remember what he did for you remember
[2:19:39] where he brought you from
[2:19:43] remember how he took your laugh and he
[2:19:45] cleaned your life up remember how he
[2:19:48] took habits out of your life
[2:19:51] remember how he moved for your family
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:58] remember the joy
[2:20:01] of his salvation
[2:20:06] because that Joy
[2:20:09] is where you've got a meat offering a
[2:20:11] drink offering
[2:20:13] and that meat offering and that drink
[2:20:15] offering
[2:20:16] it's Christ it's his life it's where
[2:20:18] abiding in his presence
[2:20:22] that's your joy
[2:20:24] that's your satisfaction
[2:20:28] you remember how the prophet said he
[2:20:30] said you've got a call to go beyond the
[2:20:32] river
[2:20:33] a call that goes beyond this Ridge
[2:20:36] Beyond this Ridge Beyond this Ridge now
[2:20:38] you know how it is
[2:20:40] you don't get from Ridge to Ridge by
[2:20:42] hopping from Ridge to Ridge to Ridge
[2:20:46] you got to go from this Ridge go down in
[2:20:49] the valley to get on top of the next
[2:20:51] Ridge
[2:20:52] then you got to go down in the valley to
[2:20:55] get up to the next Ridge
[2:20:58] the same God on the mountain
[2:21:00] is the same God in the valley
[2:21:04] the valley was not there to destroy you
[2:21:06] the valley is to prove what fruit is in
[2:21:10] you
[2:21:12] what do I do keep heeding to the call
[2:21:15] that says come up a little higher come
[2:21:18] up a little higher come up a little
[2:21:19] higher what do I do keep yielding to
[2:21:22] that voice he'll Lead You from One Ridge
[2:21:25] through the valley to the next Ridge
[2:21:27] through the valley through the next
[2:21:28] Ridge through the valley until we're
[2:21:31] resting in the arms of the Lord Jesus
[2:21:39] glory be to God
[2:21:43] it's him children it's him
[2:21:47] it's him like that woman who had an
[2:21:49] issue of blood she said if I can just
[2:21:51] Touch the Hem of His Garment
[2:21:55] the one who knew
[2:21:58] she had need of her daughter to be
[2:22:00] healed she said I've got to get to him
[2:22:06] and he spoke
[2:22:09] she recognized who he was to her she
[2:22:11] said Lord
[2:22:13] and he was her Lord
[2:22:17] right here this morning if you can just
[2:22:19] just Reach Out
[2:22:21] for your need in your life
[2:22:25] maybe it's something that you just
[2:22:27] seemed like I've never been able to lay
[2:22:29] this aside
[2:22:33] but yes you can
[2:22:35] because he said you can
[2:22:40] he's here
[2:22:41] to do
[2:22:43] what he said he will do

[2:23:03] laying on that bed that you've had to

[2:23:10] there's a God here this morning
[2:23:13] and like all those people that were
[2:23:14] there he had this step over every one of

[2:23:18] unbelief he has stepped over all your
[2:23:20] doubt
[2:23:21] and he has come right to your heart's
[2:23:23] door

[2:32:29] there
[2:32:31] that Peter came out from that upper room
[2:32:33] with the rest of them
[2:32:36] they had went in there as men that were
[2:32:39] frayed and cowards
[2:32:41] but they went in
[2:32:44] under the leadership of the word
[2:32:46] to the promise of God
[2:32:50] and what we're going to witness here in
[2:32:51] just a few moments
[2:32:53] he's just his presence that's here
[2:32:56] they asked the question what must we do
[2:33:00] to be saved
[2:33:02] see it's something about it that stood
[2:33:04] out to them that they recognized
[2:33:07] that I can be a partaker of this too
[2:33:11] what must I do to be saved
[2:33:14] Peter never said
[2:33:16] go join a church
[2:33:19] Peter never said go be buddies with the
[2:33:21] pastor
[2:33:23] here's what he said repent
[2:33:28] and how can you repent if you don't know
[2:33:31] who he is
[2:33:32] but when he's coming he deals with your
[2:33:35] life then you can repent because you're
[2:33:38] convicted of your sin there's a real
[2:33:40] sincerity I'm wrong
[2:33:43] he's right
[2:33:45] and I give my life to him
[2:33:48] repent and be baptized in the name of
[2:33:52] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[2:33:56] sins
[2:33:58] that's being sincere
[2:34:00] repentance real repentance is being
[2:34:04] sincere
[2:34:05] Lord it might cost me every friend and
[2:34:07] every relationship but you're worth it
[2:34:10] all Lord
[2:34:11] that's real repentance I turn from my
[2:34:14] sin that's the next part that I ain't
[2:34:16] got to preach on but that is a reality
[2:34:18] because you can't really repent Without
[2:34:21] Really knowing him
[2:34:25] Hallelujah
[2:34:27] glory be to God
[2:34:29] what a moment
[2:34:30] for the Aaron sister Amanda what a
[2:34:32] moment

[2:44:46] now think of how the prophet said it
[2:44:49] in things that are to be
[2:44:53] he said
[2:44:55] as we see God
[2:44:57] he said when you see that need in your
[2:44:59] life he said ask him
[2:45:03] to lay word on top a word on top of word
[2:45:07] until you become a full stature
[2:45:13] you see it's a relationship
[2:45:17] there's something that is the word calls
[2:45:20] us to separation if there's something
[2:45:21] that you look at and say this is
[2:45:24] standing between me and believing all
[2:45:27] the word of God when I'm talking about
[2:45:28] believing all the word of God is our
[2:45:30] life being able to punctuate it within a
[2:45:32] man then you know what you've got to
[2:45:34] write
[2:45:34] an authority to invite Jesus into that
[2:45:38] place of your life
[2:45:40] invite him when you're sitting on the
[2:45:41] computer inviting with that music not
[2:45:44] the music invite him but invite him
[2:45:46] right there
[2:45:48] invite Jesus
[2:45:50] and what's Jesus
[2:45:52] just begin to dismantle every hold
[2:45:55] upon your life
[2:45:57] let him be Jesus the mighty conqueror
[2:46:04] little by little by little by little and
[2:46:07] remember no matter if it's like this or
[2:46:09] it's little by little let's keep moving
[2:46:13] on
[2:46:14] footsteps are possession
[2:46:18] every little increment we're going to
[2:46:21] say glory to God
[2:46:22] if God took over the closet in
[2:46:24] somebody's life of Music That's a time
[2:46:27] to testify God has brought a Deliverance
[2:46:29] in music
[2:46:31] because what God did in one area he'll
[2:46:34] do all of it he brings a toll to
[2:46:36] Deliverance
[2:46:38] is that right
[2:46:40] he's gone

[2:48:51] no longer going to walk around this
[2:48:52] mountain
[2:48:55] whatever it might be complex whatever be
[2:48:58] setting sin
[2:49:02] we're going on
[2:49:03] we're going all the way
[2:49:07] we're going from justification to
[2:49:09] sanctification
[2:49:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the
[2:49:12] person of Christ himself we're going on
[2:49:15] Lord
[2:49:16] may that be the resolve in every one of
[2:49:19] our hearts
[2:49:21] that I'm not a so far person
[2:49:25] I'm all the way
[2:49:27] all the way
[2:49:28] and I'm going to press press press
[2:49:31] like a salmon getting back to its
[2:49:34] breeding grounds it has to go Upstream
[2:49:38] you don't have to sometimes Crossroads
[2:49:41] places where there isn't even water
[2:49:46] God even as they documented at that one
[2:49:48] time where that salmon even
[2:49:51] he was hatched out in a hatchery
[2:49:54] but it's the scent of water from the
[2:49:56] Homeland that it follows that scent
[2:49:59] till it gets back
[2:50:01] to the grounds
[2:50:03] where it was born
[2:50:06] and that salmon Lord as they documented
[2:50:08] I think on that old documentary Lord
[2:50:11] that Moody Bible Institute put out that
[2:50:14] salmon was seen it had to pop a great
[2:50:17] off in order to get back into that place
[2:50:22] oh God
[2:50:25] it takes the Lord of Reckoning from that
[2:50:27] in an understanding we do as your
[2:50:29] children to recognize as your Prophet
[2:50:31] said when there is a life with the
[2:50:33] hunger and the desire then there is a
[2:50:36] veil and a barrier to be broken
[2:50:39] oh God we surrendered Lord we submit
[2:50:43] Lord
[2:50:45] in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:50:48] we're going back to our homeland
