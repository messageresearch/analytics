corinthians chapter 13 and certainly good to see amen each one of you that here this evening and just thank you for the prayers and as we as we were there in north carolina and i just so appreciate also i had a chance to tell brother nathan what uh what a masterpiece he placed here on sunday and um we just really just appreciate that so much and so i just i thank god for his mercy and uh we just want to look here in the word just a little bit more this evening and we certainly want him to lead us here in first corinthians 13 4 the scripture says charity suffereth long is kind the charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up and i want to also read that i don't know if i included that of the amplified but i want to just read that last part on is not puffed up it says it does not display itself hardly amen so may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we know as we look at this and truly you know in each part of this and the scripture we could we could take many many parts upon this and we certainly just want to be mindful to what god has to speak to our hearts but when we look at this it's paul is letting it be known that charity itself is not is completely the opposite of pride and pride itself is something that we have seen it begins even within even within a person it can even start with a thought and start with a feeling and there's things that we know that we need the grace of god that everything about our life would stay in a place to where god can use us we know that that's something that god himself after god has come by way of the new birth god has entrusted that to our lives that we would humble ourselves god will not do that for us but that's something that we must do and so when we we look at this the scripture as it speaks concerning of the lord himself and just looking at at his nature it says in isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones in the scriptures when we look at this in second corinthians chapter eight and verse nine you know brother branham would take the example and he would pull it from even a story that he said i don't know if it's fictional or not but he would speak of it where that a king himself one day laid aside his kingly garments and he put on garments that would be as though he was a peasant and his subjects or those who were around him asked him and said what are you doing and he said i'm going to go down among my subjects that i might understand them better and to think that even in that whether it was a fictional narrative or whatever the reality of it is is that's exactly what god himself did in order to bring redemption to you and i as we were looking at that last week and you take that that term of humiliation and we know that the scriptures we even speak of that in acts chapter 7 but to think of how that god himself would come down and he would lay aside his kingly robes he would lay aside stepping out as brother brown would say out of the ivory palaces and he would come down and he would descend condense in to such a to such a measure in order to redeem you and i because he could not he could not do it as as jehovah's spirit but he had to come down and become kin folks he had to become kin folks with a man who was lost in order to redeem us to himself that's that's greatness that's real greatness that's real humility and the scripture how paul would pick this up he would say for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that through his poverty might be rich now to think of it here all the very fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in him as far as riches uh that of this earth he was a very poor man the poorest of poor he didn't have even a place to lay his head a house to call his home as a matter of fact when he came down god would come down in such humility to where even at his birth god did not even provide the clothing that was needed but he came down into such a place to where they had to borrow as brother graham says a womb for him to be born in had to borrow a place and had to borrow a swaddling cloth that would go on the back of an oxen and and to think that god himself the greatest of all greats there's no one greater no one even close but god was going to make a way back for you and i and to show that pride itself is what had brought about this fall in the beginning to where what had taken place as we looked at in heaven and then it came down here on earth and how that one of god's subjects let down on the word and instead of just waiting on god to fulfill the word and say you know wait a minute here god promised here god made a word that he said that that there would be a multiply and replenish so i'm just going to wait on god to come and vindicate his word but instead here we see how that satan himself would take a promise and satan would inflate it or puff it up to a place of where this is of learning or great learning but god doesn't come according to great learning god comes in simplicity and god always comes to those lives and hearts that are just simply going to stand on his word and say lord i'm looking to you because remember god has entrusted the word to himself that god he'll bring his word to pass all we have to do is be waiting watching looking with expectation walking with him god never asked us to figure anything out he just said do you believe and that's the greatest compliment that we can ever give god as believers is just simply to believe what he has said and to find that how that here he comes the very the very uh god of glory and here the very the very fullness of the godhead is dwelling within him but he became poor he was rich but he became poor for our sakes that through his poverty we might be made rich i want you to think of this though he was a king yet he never put on any error about him that he was king he never put on any subtle display that i'm a king i'm somebody he never came out like that in any way as a matter of fact the way that he would so yield and so humble himself to the lord to to to the god of heaven to his father to think what would be displayed they would look upon him and say is this him is this is is this and they would marvel at what words the bible said they were astonished at his doctrine the bible said the common people heard him gladly to think that how god would so humble himself into such a such a manner that you know he never came in a manner to that would be displayed as though that i'm better than you but this is quite the contrary to what the pharisees who had the law who had the prophets who had the psalms and yet they themselves reading the writings knowing the writings could quote the verse before the verse after but yet they themselves were so inflated with themselves they were so inflated with the where remember they could look upon the man whose eyes were healed and say ah you were all together born in fornication do you teach us they had so so inflated themselves and yet that was not the true representation of the word but you see god himself came down in a real true display of that of the way that he had displayed himself in measure through the prophets the way that he had displayed himself through the psalms the trials and tests that was displayed or that would come forth in experiences in david's life he was there in the writings and noticed this all the way down through in the prophets in the psalms and all the law remember one thing never changed he said i'm god and i changed not it didn't matter what kind of a vesture he was wearing his nature was always the same so even when he laid aside because you know how it could be a person can take off certain garments certain let's just make it simple maybe certain name brand things that everybody would know boy those things cost a lot that purse cost a lot this cost a lot this cost a lot and through the menominee they might just have a knockoff that's off the black market just to feel good about it but you understand that here here is one that could take off kingly garments but you remember it's not enough just to take off kingly garments but it must be able to so humble itself to where everyone that is around would look right past him would not even recognize him this is the lord of glory almighty god who created who brought forth this earth the stars everything and here he was walking right among them he took upon the vesture of humility as we looked at last week it was that in the likeness of sinful flesh in that body of humiliation where he could experience suffering he could experience temptation he experienced sickness he experienced frustration in a body of humiliation he came in order to redeem him listen made in the likeness of sinful flesh that body aged when they looked at him here he was 33 years old they said thou art a man no more than 50 years old there was such an aging that had taken place upon that body but he came that way in order to redeem you and i and that he might understand you and i this is real humility this is real this is real charity as it would display itself let me just say it like this the garment of humiliation coming in the likeness of sinful flesh was only the beginning of humility it was only the beginning brother braham says it like this in total deliverance he said he was totally and completely a man but he chose to deliver his natural parts into the hands of the god who dwelled inside of him there was a choice you see it was not anything that was just that was made to be done it was a choice what you find remember man fell man put on free more agency redemption cannot come back or come without free mall agency god had to become kin folks with you and i god would so condescend there was a tabernacle a temple purpose for death that he might redeem us back to to back to himself but remember it could not be free from free moral agency he had to make choices because you and i have choices to make he never made a wrong choice we can't say that he was tempted without sin we can't say that but you see he had to be that because he's our high priest that stands on our behalf and we're identified in his life he is our perpetuation he is our advocate he is our all-in-all and we stand in him and he is our representative he clothed himself in the likeness of sinful flesh and yet as he said that was only the beginning he humbled himself to take the form of a servant that itself still was not the farthest but he would come to a place of humility that he would humble himself to death that in itself was not enough it would go even lower even the death of the cross but you find god condescending condescending it was not just enough to come with a garment of humiliation that was the beginning but he would humble himself humble himself humble himself humble himself to where even those that were around and even satan would watch him walking up the hill and the blood spots that started out small would grow and grow until there was one great big spot all upon his garment and satan would stand there and say that can't be the son of god that a son of god wouldn't put up with criticism a son of god wouldn't put up being called names but brother graham says a son of god will stand there and put up with it when he knows he's in the plan and purpose and will of god he was humbled to the will of god this is why this is what true greatness is he became in his greatness he brought himself down to where he wasn't a stuffed shirt these are terms brother branham would put it like this of what made him great he wanted a stuffed shirt he didn't look upon the woman who had you know six husbands and the one she was living with then was not her own he didn't look upon him and say oh i can't go around you you you you'll just you'll throw my reputation off but see he didn't come to try to be her buddy or to pat her lifestyle in the back but he had a heart for her life he condescended not to not to come and show that i'm better than you i'm a better class that god that's not god that's man that's man that's that's evil but god condescending not a stuffed shirt and i think our brother ram says rosella griffith he said when every hospital he said in chicago told her don't you come back we don't want you here she was turned out an alcoholic but how that god came down in a meeting and he set rosella griffith free when the rest had turned her out because they couldn't help her but jesus could help her and jesus didn't think he was too big that he could go down there and loosen the hold upon her life [Applause] i'm preaching to people tonight and myself included that i'm faithful that it wasn't too big to come down where i was at hallelujah i'm thankful that he didn't say oh i'll be too humiliated if i go down there and start dealing with samuel's life but i'm glad that he came down i'm glad he brought himself down to minister to my life it wasn't a stuffed shirt that's not a characteristic of jesus so matter of fact the publicans accused him and criticized him in luke 15 because he was here were sinners and he's receiving them come on they called him a wine bibber are you with me they had all of that but you see what it was they were stuffed shirts their their righteousness was putting other people down that's what pride does he goes around you gotta if you in order for that person to be righteous they gotta find somebody to tear down but you see jesus ain't in the business of tearing people down he's in the business of bringing a loosening of a hold a grip on their life and building them up in the power of his resurrection hallelujah oh my this is what makes him great to think that how that he will come in such a way think about it jesus he was with thousands there are times he was with 12. there are times he was with three and there's times he was with one jesus don't need a crowd to preach to him he's not a stuffed shirt he don't think that everybody well you know no he came he will always come this is what makes him great he'll come where there's a need and people invited he'll always do that i'm just referring to these places he can make himself simple i'm glad about that aren't you how does god make himself simple even yet here tonight because he'll come according to his word god does not ask for that we have to have great learning or great understanding as a matter of fact that that is that is self exaltation but god comes to his word when john the baptist stood there remember that day they could look and say oh the high places will be made plain and you know the low places will be exalted they they were looking to that that word but they had their own idea about it and they had so leaned upon that to they mist the actual manifestation of that was the ministry of john the baptist god was manifesting high places made low and low places exalted in the ministry of john the baptist and they miss that scripture being fulfilled oh my may god help us to have a mind that's simple may we be simple people that just simply say god i'm trusting in you that you come and you'll vindicate your word i'm looking to you this is a promised lord that you made and i'm gonna wait right here lord looking to you i'm gonna take your word that's molding me shaping me and preparing me for the moment that i can see that vindicated and move into it that's what the bride that's the secret in the blight of the bride of jesus christ she knows she cannot do it in herself it must be him and she's waiting on the word to be vindicated she's watching you see he would speak in such a manner he didn't stick his chest out you know as though he was somebody you you understand we're not ignorant here tonight you understand you've been around people that could be good people but there's just something about it there's an error about them when you get around them and i'm not talking about in the world i'm talking about i've been around it right right and it's just like this just it's just an air the way that they carry it's not just even how they would carry themselves when you when you when you could get around there's just something about it i don't know about you but i don't feel welcome in that in that place anybody know what i'm talking about you know it's like you start wondering man what do i step here do i step there or do it and it just becomes it becomes odd it becomes because that's not the atmosphere of a believer are you with me it's not an atmosphere we we want to be in an atmosphere and look let me just say it like this some might have a tendency toward that way while others have a tendency towards this way the thing that we always know is let us always recognize our weakness that's the way we can be honest with god and recognize our weakness and say god feel that with yourself and our strengths we don't want to handle our strength we say god you handle the strength also lord being aware taking account of ourselves so we see this and how it makes god what makes him so great because he's not a touch me not he's humble he's humble he was our example brother brown would say like this he says he come to show what god was i'm just going to refer to this anything that's high and haughty isn't god god is low and humble that's what made him god see something comes low not something that goes high god doesn't dwell in hierarchies he dwells in humility the way up is down humble yourself and you'll be exalted exalt yourself and you'll be humbled think of how in matthew 20 25 you see the lord jesus this was an example that was being lived out in in in a life that was here remember here he is in the vesture of of made in the likeness of sinful flesh but even in that vesture he did not then the nature itself remained the same he did not it was not something as we said to where he put on an heir about himself you know it's just like to give subtle clues like uh you need to be catering to me you need to be no not at all but here look at look how jesus as he speaks here to the disciples in matthew 20 25 but jesus called them unto him and said you know that the princes of the gentiles exercised dominion over them now there had been a discussion remember the sons of zebedee their mother had asked grant that one may sit on the right and one on the left so they're they're asking she's asking about position and jesus has told him said that that's already been granted i i can't do that that's already been given where before the foundation of the world that position so now when because of that's asked oh it's just stirred up a little bit of a of a contention and here here in the lord jesus he says the princes of the gentiles exercised dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them think of the image that when nebuchadnezzar the dream that god gave him of the gentile kingdoms it does not start from the feet it starts from the head it starts with gold in the head and comes down to where it is now iron and clay mix through the toes such brittleness no stability nothing that's anchored but that's contrary to god god builds his image of his life in us by coming down to bring us into a place of a real foundation in him he descends in our life to build our lives up it's not something that we grow up overnight but we grow we grow in grace and knowledge we grow in the lord it's god maturing and moving in our life and maturing us now notice he says but it shall not be so among you he's letting them know this the way that the world is this should not be among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister your servant and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant this is entirely contrary to that of the world notice he's displaying what true leadership is i i've said this because i see this i've said this over the years i see it scripturally a person cannot lead until they can be led and if they can't be led they can't lead you you'll see that principle you can see the principle many times it'll work out when a person can't be led because in order to be led you've got to be able to humble yourself you've got you've got to be able to do that you've got to be able to to look at that and and say god you lead me god you direct me now notice he says this is this is the example that's been set before him even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister to serve think of this he served the needs of those who were sick he served the needs he looked upon them saw they were hungry he served their needs he came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many when's the last time we ever thought about a great person coming around or maybe somebody coming in your company maybe one of the bigwigs are coming down my they get everything set or even maybe sometimes when we're having someone come over our house and maybe we get the coffee creamer they're alike and maybe the chocolates they like and or the apple pie they like you know trying to do things that you might know what because you have a thought about them coming i want you to understand this that god when he came as he came down his thoughts was not about what can they give me but he came and he came with a purpose and come to minister to them i come to serve their needs i come in order to give my life a ransom for them this is a god this is one of greatness who thought about our needs oh thank god for that he took the form of a servant here he humbled himself he took the form of a servant look at this in psalms 93 1 the lord reigns he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he has girded himself the world also has established that it cannot be moved now let's look here here's the lord of glory and how he rises from the passover there the last passover that he's going to eat with his disciples i want you to look at this verse of scripture here in john 13 3 jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god this is not coincidence he knows he walked in a world of perfect faith he he knew that the father had given all things into his hands he has this this is not a knowledge here i can't get into that tonight but this is he's it's revealed to him it's so quick unto him and he knows that has he come from god and he's going back to god but look what this glorious revelation does when it's operating in his life he rises from supper and he laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself so revelation does not bring self-exaltation now there are things that god can reveal but then it's up to us to keep ourselves little but as we mentioned there's things that god knows we have limitations even in that and as paul said lest i should be exalted god knows just how to keep us in that place of weakness to where we're relying upon him i thank god for that i'm glad that god didn't say you know with that part of it samuel you oversee it but he did tell me humble myself and with all my heart that's what i want to do but i'm so thankful that god says samuel if i think you're getting a little bit i know how to humble you he's not beating us down and even with paul it wasn't that he could say well paul you're getting a little hottie no but he could see those things and god knowing here's a man that had the revelation of jesus christ he saw god in a greater measure than what peter had but yet he had to stand there and say lest i should be exalted god gave a messenger a messenger of satan to buffet me this to me is powerful he rose from supper and he laid aside his garments he took a towel he girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded the lord of glory became if i could say it in this manner a foot washed blunky he became to the lowest take the lowest man in the house and jesus became the lowest man in the house he humbled himself to that place he was letting him know remember in this part where peter said no lord you're not going to wash my feet but jesus is letting him know this display of humility you don't understand it now but what i do unless i wash you you have no part with me but he says says he says but a man that is clean he's speaking of the new birth a man that is clean needeth not wash save his feet are you with me this is why we're out in the world you got to wash your feet you got to wash your hands i'm talking about your goings and your doings when they came into the tabernacle god had that of of their of running water and before they could wash it worship wash your feet wash your hands right there's got to be a continual washing of water by the word a cleansing nobody know what i'm talking about sometimes you leave work or you leave the store and you say lord yeah i mean my hands washed maybe there's things you hurt you didn't ask to hear but you're gonna wash your feet what you're a worshiper [Applause] and he let him know that the cleansing that i bring to you it is will be through my blood you will be loosed from your sins and i'll wash you this is greatness greatness to wear as we said here he was he was found in philippians 2 8 found in passion as a man he humbled himself i trust god who helped me to make this as these things have just rested on my heart for months he humbled himself this was not something that god did for him he had to do it he had to humble himself when they were trying to pull him to come to lazarus side he humbled himself to the will of the father and then became obedient unto bet unto death but notice not just death even the death of the cross as paul said regarding this in hebrews 12 2 that he for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame he knew what that was all about you see it was one thing to humble yourself to death that's a pretty big thing in itself but then to humble yourself even to the death of the cross knowing what it meant this is why when he was there in the garden of gethsemane think about this where the victory was won the victory wasn't won there at calvary the victory was won in the garden that's where the lamb overcame nevertheless not my will thy will be done he didn't pray that once he prayed it three times what was he showing that you and i would have times where to be wrestling with ourselves to obey the word are you with me i'm talking about even after you're converted you'll wrestle with yourself to obey the word [Applause] are you with me but he's a leader he's one as the prophet said he contended with himself who do you contend with yourself who's your worst enemy yourself he wrestled it out in the garden nevertheless not my will thine will be done oh my god ought to give courage and and and strength here he was the desire and it led him to a place of complete submission to where paul could write it like this in 2nd corinthians 13 4 for though he was crucified through weakness what happened in gethsemane complete weakness he had already spoke under inspiration according to the word destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it back up he was standing on the word he knew the purpose that the father had given him to do are you hearing me tonight he knew that he was testifying even when he was walking with the disciples after many miracles he would speak to them signifying the death that he was going to die listen to me now he knew about all that but that in itself when it came time for the moment of that word to be fulfilled it required complete weakness what about the bride of jesus christ it's not weakness how you and i think about it weakness to god is where we just stand on his word it's not us with our thoughts about it's just god you said this in your word you said it and that's where i stand i say amen to that word hallelujah jesus there when he prayed in the garden you know what had happened he had come to such a place of such commitment to where he became obedient completely submissive unto death even the death of the cross so just kick that devil off your shoulder that wants to say oh you're stubborn your rebellion see look at you you're no i'm praying i'm wrestling it out i'm surrendering my will are you with me now we're not pretenders there's a battle that goes on but our desire that that pulsates beyond anything is lord i want to please you more than anything i want to please you more than i want to please myself notice therefore in isaiah 53 let me jump back to a promise this was a promise for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god here's the promise isaiah 53 12 this was hundreds of years before he ever came therefore will i divide him a portion with the great because of his humility his humbling himself even to death the death of the cross he shall divide the spoil with the strong the little ones strong little ones strong little ones it's the hum ones who are willing to humble themselves that's the strong ones he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors remember on the cross he didn't say my father my father he said my god my god he cried out as a sinner because he could not remain in his sonship and then make sinner's sons so he forsook his sonship and he cried out as a man that is lost my god my god why hast thou forsaken me but the great thing about it is is that he who was rich became poor that we who were poor might be made rich through his poverty now he can take sinners and make suns out of them hallelujah even in that moment he wasn't thinking about himself he saved others and he can't save himself temptation temptation what you're trying to do trying to anoint that flesh trying to get it drawn out in pride i show you who i am it's trying to get it and then the bible says how they hit him on the head prophesy tell us who hit you let me just tell you one thing you don't have one thing to prove to the devil [Applause] what do i do just keep living for god you don't have one thing to prove to that liar jesus now now let me jump ahead here he is he comes and appears to them after his resurrection and jesus came and spake to them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth have been a conquering of all the realms he stood the mighty conqueror he had humbled himself and now god had raised him up and so why brother branham would you would speak about people want power but they really don't know what power is and the way up is always down let me move on let me just skip that one let me go here let's look into another promise isaiah 52 13 behold my servant shall deal wisely prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high psalm 89 27 also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth in in hebrews 1 4 now notice it was shifting from the promise to the fulfillment being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they and i want you to notice this there was the inheritance that he obtained there were promises he would be exalted he would be higher than than any of the other kings those were all promises promise i just read in isaiah 53 but those promises required supreme weakness those promises were not just give me in other words this is just what it's going to be you don't got to do nothing it was a promise but in order for that promise to of exaltation to where god would lift him into that position it would come by complete humility if it was that for the groom it's the same for the bride complete humility complete weakness to the word so he obtained this inheritance that position how did he obtain it through complete humility he was tested just like you and i are as i said earlier the thing is is that he can say i never sinned and never failed you and i can't say that that's not an excuse it's just what we recognize is greater is he that's in me and he's teaching us he's molding us he's shaping us even the sting of where the correction or chastisement would come in our life you'd say oh god mold me and shape me knowing the test is going to come again if the test will be there but we say god build me for that moment wherefore god hath also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name the bible said in first peter 3 2 i'm just just moving through this who's gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him even though this was his position but that could not be obtained or come into without suffering the bible says in hebrews 5 he learned obedience by the things he suffered he god actually so condescended to where god himself learned he experienced what it was for man to obey the word god experienced that god experienced that wrestling that struggle he experienced that friends listen we can be very honest there are some parts of the word oh my it's very easy there's things that god can speak and ask about oh amen but remember we've got to eat the whole lamb even the pertinence and everything and there's parts about it that even when it comes to preaching there's parts about it sometimes that even how god himself will come down and drop things and minister to our lives ministering just what we have needed oh god think of this hebrews 2 9 we see jesus who was made a little lower with then the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste debt for every man crowned with glory and honor that came after humility ram says you know he says god he could have brought to himself many men who had a lot of understanding he said but many of those things he said is that the men would start taking glory to themselves he said but god takes nothing and makes something out of it he says when you can become nothing in your own sight you're becoming something in god's sight then becoming nothing does not mean that you're looking down and running yourself down that's not what humility is humility is is simply recognizing what it is who you are and our need of him that god doesn't want me to try to put on something god just wants me to be honest with him that's what invites his presence you see the way up is down let me read just a couple places here think of jesus here he gives this example in matthew 23 verse 8 but be he not called rabbi now he's dealing with what has been taken place out here among the pharisees and different ones but be ye not called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ so what's he telling us resist titles of exultation see they wanted those titles because it was something that it made them feel in a certain way and they wanted to display themselves remember remember they walked along in the markets with the longer tassels and their philanthropies if i said it right and man they made long prayers you know and i mean when they were called to pray over the prairie i mean when they they made long prayers you know you understand what i'm saying i mean they were just gonna they're letting everybody know jesus said you're doing all of that out of the pretense in other words to show off is that right that that's a boastfulness it's tied into pride but the sim the simplicity is jesus saying don't don't don't seek for those titles you're all brethren you're all brethren notice but he that's greatest among you shall be your servant this is a principle this is a principle of a church this is the principle look god sent his message to this generation and when god sent his message to this generation let me just tell you something the prophet when he was here i just say it like this it wasn't about him it wasn't about him as a matter of fact he got on different magazines he said it seems like he said the problem i've got with them is that they're trying to lift up the man instead of the god who's the one who's doing the work with himself you'll catch it in places here perhaps we'll share it in in other services but brother brown himself he would even speak of how that he himself would recognize how the ministry was advancing in the polls and he would say i must keep myself humble you know that requires a big man it requires a big person who's able to humble themselves it's easy for somebody to become but it it's it's against the grain of nature to go the other way but i'm thankful god has equipped us he that's greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a base and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted notice this in luke 14 7 i'm going to close what's jesus put this forth he puts forth a parable to those which were which were bidden when he marked how they should choose out the chief rooms saying unto them when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him and he that bade him that bad thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room but when thou art bitten go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bad thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then thou shalt have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted self-exaltation is not of god to exalt oneself now let me just let's just i'm closing sometimes tendencies and so forth can can be right here among us can right be right here in our life sometimes you can feel pressure to to try to put yourself in a certain light or a certain way but just remember just remember this whether it's from young people to one ever more if you've got to put yourself in some way to be welcomed by somebody then that's not true god never put anything on he doesn't put nothing on to be welcomed by us he just simply is the same he just simply is the same and though sometimes we might feel this or feel that pressures can come friends pressures are real i know you know what i'm talking about pressures are real but just remember we're living for him every man riseth and fallen to his own master we are our rest is in him if we go to exalt ourself god will obey us because no man god will not accept the exaltation of any man because it's contrary to his nature it's contrary to the word so let's just continue to see how simple we can be see how simple as though like we come here to this to this place and you know here instead of rising and going to as he said to the highest seat see that whole whole example that he gave there in luke 14 that's how he came he never took the highest seat made of no reputation he came to the lowest place but because he was willing to come to the lowest place then he's exalted to be a servant i could say this right here jesus was observant you believe that he's observant about our needs jesus was not one who just came and said hey i don't have time i'm here i just gotta you know i don't have time you're hungry well you know i'm sorry i'm here i just i'm here i've come i'm just here to pay the price for redemption i i can't be troubled with all those other things he came to minister so he had to take notice of all that was around him right let me tell you something friends real humility too is where our prayer time isn't all about us real humility is where everything is not all about us amen but it's to look on one another to look on the needs of one another to be mindful of that even as a body that we're placed here to serve and minister to the needs of the body of jesus christ we're here to serve god's purpose we're here to serve his will god help us i say god help me help me lord as brother brown would say keep those spirits away from us lord help us to recognize lord that our need of you and where you brought us from and who and where you've brought us to it's been you that's done that lord oh god how we need you lord jesus let's pray heavenly father lord we just we thank you lord this evening thank you dear god for your mercy lord even in the place i think of it that where you took on the garment of humiliation you kept humbling yourself took the form of a servant humbled yourself to death even the death of the cross you kept descending that was what the word called for was humility lord as you showed us tonight you knew the purpose you knew the journey you knew what you were purposed for [Music] when it came time for that moment it required humility lord jesus i believe lord that's where it comes in our lives lord we see how you moved in our hearts lord your god you you brought a transformation in our life it started with a humbling dying to our self lord to humble ourselves lord to your word and lord that don't that don't stop that keeps going it's a humbling of ourselves lord moment after moment paul said i die daily it's a humbling of ourselves it's a humbling to your will it's a humbling to your word lord jesus help us lord i pray may we be mindful lord as your prophet would say it be conscious of how little we are [Music] to make ourselves little it means lord simply just be ourselves just yield to you we don't have to be anybody we don't have to say everything the right way we don't have to well everybody's talking i've got to find the scripture to quote her i've got to find a i've got to find a quote to say no just just be in love with him [Music] just be in love with him lord jesus help us lord your god it covers the lord expands all parts every life god help us help us to humble ourselves lord give us grace lord that we might humble ourselves we know that you'll not do it for us but we must do it even when paul would experience that buffeting that was not you humbling paul paul had to humble himself in that time that the power of christ might rest upon his life lord so we realize that real weakness it's not complaining it's healed it's standing on your word knowing that god you're you're in control help us lord may we always remember lord where you brought us from that it was you that brought us lord it was you and may we lord i pray god operate with that same humility help us father i pray lord we ask it right now in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] amen you'd like to stand mr stanley [Music]
