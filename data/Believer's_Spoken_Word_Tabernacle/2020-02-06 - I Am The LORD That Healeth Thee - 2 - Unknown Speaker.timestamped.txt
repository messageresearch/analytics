[34:07] Amen for that reality amen in our hearts
[34:11] it's so good to be in the house of the
[34:13] Lord tonight god glad that the Lord has
[34:17] made a way for us to be together we just
[34:19] want to go on into the word of the Lord
[34:22] tonight so I want to say thank you
[34:23] musicians they just want to look in just
[34:27] a little something more tonight healing
[34:30] and in the scriptures where we were
[34:37] looking here in Exodus 15 if you'd like
[34:40] to turn back to there and I'm just going
[34:41] to read the last two verses of scripture
[34:44] verse 25 and verse 26
[34:58] and verse 25 he says and he cried unto
[35:04] the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree
[35:07] which when he had cast into the waters
[35:11] the waters were made sweet there he made
[35:14] for them a statue and an ordinance and
[35:18] there he proved them and said if thou
[35:22] wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
[35:24] the LORD thy God no remember this tree
[35:28] is a symbol it's a symbol of the
[35:34] atonement the offering of the perfect
[35:37] Lamb of God at Calvary the tree is a
[35:40] symbol then here the Spirit of the Lord
[35:43] brings this reality of what this symbol
[35:47] of what it speaks of in verse 26 if Val
[35:51] wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
[35:53] the Lord that God and will do that which
[35:56] is right in his sight and will give ear
[35:59] to His commandments and keep all his
[36:02] statutes I will put none of these
[36:04] diseases upon thee which I have brought
[36:07] upon the Egyptians now remember those
[36:09] diseases that came upon Egypt were
[36:12] judgments but here's what he says for I
[36:17] am the Lord that healeth fear so to
[36:24] recognize that the word is present the
[36:27] word became flesh and dwelt among us and
[36:31] now that same life coming inside of your
[36:35] eye it brings the word that has been
[36:38] sowed in our life that seed within our
[36:41] life it brings it into an expression
[36:44] just like a seed that would be in a
[36:47] packet of whatever type of a plant
[36:50] you're looking at when rain and Sun
[36:54] comes upon that seed it releases the
[36:57] germ that is already there the rain does
[37:00] not make it a tomato see the rain does
[37:02] the Sun doesn't it the germ those are
[37:05] only the the conditions that release the
[37:07] germ that's already in it
[37:09] and that's why coming into the presence
[37:11] of God does not make you a son and
[37:14] daughter of God it only is through the
[37:16] quickening power that releases that germ
[37:19] of life that was laying there dormant
[37:21] the whole time amen and that's the
[37:26] that's the reality then that God is
[37:30] present within our lives so let's just
[37:34] go here to the Lord in prayer tonight
[37:36] Heavenly Father Lord as we come to you
[37:40] Lord tonight and just so thankful you
[37:43] made a way Lord the roads Lord and some
[37:46] places were good other time others
[37:48] places Lord we're not that good but Lord
[37:51] we're asking tonight that even as we've
[37:53] gathered here Lord that father I thank
[37:56] you for watching over us to be able to
[37:58] be here Lord and we ask that God that
[38:00] you'll watch over us Lord even Lord when
[38:03] it comes time to depart Lord I pray God
[38:05] that you just help those that are
[38:07] working on the roads and I ask God that
[38:09] you'll just Lord move upon that of the
[38:12] roads Lord that each and every one of us
[38:14] Lord the Lord will just make it back to
[38:17] our home safely Lord father we're not
[38:20] worried Lord but we're just asking you
[38:22] Lord that you will go with us and watch
[38:25] over his father we pray we love you Lord
[38:28] and we thank your father so many times
[38:30] we take these things for granted Lord
[38:32] and we ask you forgive us for that Lord
[38:34] and we pray that God that you'll just
[38:37] now come and take your word speak to our
[38:40] hearts Lord for what we have need of in
[38:42] our lives

[38:46] you've directed me that you'll just so
[38:48] direct me in this moment Lord just to
[38:51] say only Lord what it is that you desire
[38:54] to say to your children tonight and we
[38:57] ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[38:59] amen may God bless you as you're being
[39:02] seated I want to go from that portion of
[39:07] the scripture and I want to go into
[39:09] Matthew chapter 8 and I want to continue
[39:13] to look here tonight if the Lord will
[39:15] help us on that thought we were dealing
[39:18] with here last Thursday night on I
[39:22] I am the Lord that healeth thee and I
[39:27] want to continue to dwell on that
[39:29] thought because he is the ever-present
[39:32] God and I'm going probably tonight I may
[39:37] just try to go I want to just lay some
[39:39] things in in a manner of teaching that
[39:42] would not be so deep but it comes down
[39:45] to some things that I feel that it would
[39:48] be helpful to our lives to encourage us
[39:50] and to further balance us not that we're
[39:54] out of balance but it would just I
[39:55] believe it would help us sometimes you
[39:57] you hear these points discussed in in
[40:01] different instances and I want to just
[40:03] lay some of these things and tonight now
[40:06] that he God is he where he was he was
[40:09] present through the prophets he was
[40:11] present among the believers that even in
[40:13] the Old Testament that were walking
[40:16] according to his word God he was present
[40:20] in in Jesus he is present now in the
[40:24] body of believers that he has purchased
[40:25] and redeemed with his own blood
[40:28] he's dwelling now in his people and that
[40:30] is the reality that he is the
[40:31] ever-present God and you know is like
[40:36] you would say in one place in the
[40:38] scriptures in the in the book of Matthew
[40:41] that the Lord was present to heal them
[40:43] and I think it's important that we
[40:45] recognize the Lord he is the one who
[40:50] healeth thee very simple words but it's
[40:54] a reality here that where the Holy
[40:56] Spirit would bring us back into that
[40:58] line to recognize that there is no man
[41:02] that can heal us but it is that must be
[41:06] the Lord Himself God works through
[41:09] divine gifts God works through his body
[41:12] but at all is of the Lord and so you
[41:16] know it's just like brother Branham
[41:18] would say in his ministry brother
[41:20] Branham would say you know even in the
[41:22] first part of the ministry there which
[41:24] was declaring and remember everything
[41:26] was working to a place to where there
[41:29] would come forth a message that was the
[41:32] promised divine healing was that of the
[41:35] bait that were
[41:36] on the hook to get the people's
[41:38] attention of the Living God that was
[41:40] present and you find how that in brother
[41:43] branham's ministry that how that many of
[41:46] them the the very night that where he
[41:48] you know it starts out in his ministry
[41:51] many of those other ministries you find
[41:54] t losberne all the rest of them it all
[41:56] sprung out of that and I want you to
[41:58] think about this how al Osborne would
[42:00] come to brother Branham and he was so
[42:02] impressed by what he saw in that
[42:05] ministry and what he saw was the Living
[42:07] God remember he said do you think God
[42:10] would heal my prayer and brother Branham
[42:12] just said it like this he said he said
[42:14] God will hear anybody's prayer they
[42:18] didn't just say just anybody but he said
[42:20] if you're called to preach the gospel
[42:22] you are commissioned also to pray for
[42:24] the sick and to think of it you know TL
[42:27] I was born in one of these you know
[42:30] sometime the goal and I just you know
[42:31] you you see see him years later you know
[42:35] and he's on an interview and he was
[42:37] talking about he said you know him
[42:39] Pentecost he said we had never seen
[42:41] anything like this he said here we are
[42:43] he said we were used to when it came to
[42:44] Casting out Devils you were stomping and
[42:46] everything else he said but right there
[42:49] he said it was just right there he said
[42:51] it was just leave him Satan and you know
[42:54] what it was is coming back to is that
[42:57] the authority I I've witnessed things
[42:59] even in the casting out of Devils I've
[43:01] witnessed those Devils being stubborn
[43:03] but I will tell you this right now that
[43:05] there's not one devil when a person is
[43:08] willing to confess and they're willing
[43:11] to uncover that no devil can stay there
[43:14] I can tell you that a lot of the
[43:17] wrestling is is getting down to what is
[43:20] it where the enemy has trapped in that
[43:22] heart but as soon as that's exposed that
[43:24] devil has to leave and you see it's like
[43:29] brother BAM says he don't have to obey
[43:30] me but you gotta obey the one I stand
[43:33] for amen and so we find that message it
[43:37] follows divine healing but here when we
[43:40] we recognize that and we come into the
[43:43] scripture and I want to read this
[43:44] portion of Scripture here in Matthew
[43:46] chapter 8
[43:48] here the Lord Jesus here in the ministry
[43:51] says when he was come down from the
[43:53] mountain great multitudes followed him
[43:56] and behold there came a leper and
[43:59] worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt
[44:03] thou canst make me clean and Jesus put
[44:08] forth his hand and touched him saying I
[44:11] will be thou clean and immediately his
[44:16] leprosy was cleansed and jesus said to
[44:19] him see thou tell no man but go thy way
[44:21] show thyself to the priest and offer the
[44:24] gift that Moses commanded for a
[44:26] testimony unto them and when Jesus was
[44:29] entered into Capernaum there came unto
[44:31] him a cetera and Centurion beseeching
[44:33] him and saying Lord my servant lieth at
[44:38] home sick of the palsy grievously
[44:40] tormented and jesus said to him I will
[44:44] come and heal him and the Centurion
[44:48] answered lord I am not worthy that thou
[44:51] should has come under my roof but Speak
[44:54] the word only and my servant shall be
[44:57] healed
[44:58] now watch what he says here for I am a
[45:01] man under Authority and having soldiers
[45:04] under me I say to this man go and he
[45:07] goeth and to another come and he cometh
[45:10] and to my servant do this and he do with
[45:12] it when Jesus heard it he marvelled and
[45:15] said to them that followed verily I say
[45:17] unto you I have not found so great faith
[45:21] no not in Israel so what's he doing he's
[45:25] commending the faith of that Centurion
[45:29] now we're going to read just a few more
[45:32] scriptures but even and the very first
[45:34] scripture that we read here out of this
[45:37] the leper came and worshiped him and
[45:39] said lord if thou wilt thou canst make
[45:42] me clean and the leper remember says
[45:46] he's a doubt wilt thou canst make me
[45:48] clean what did Jesus do he stretched
[45:51] forth his hand and touched him now I
[45:54] want you to just look at all of it even
[45:57] just in these two instances and we'll
[45:59] just keep reading buddy
[46:01] the Lord that healed the leper it was
[46:05] the Lord that healed the Roman
[46:07] centurions servant 1 hands were laid on
[46:11] the other the word was spoken but
[46:14] irregardless
[46:15] it was the same God performing his word
[46:18] and so now look out here Jesus goes on
[46:23] in verse 13 if let me just move on to
[46:25] that that one and Jesus said unto the
[46:27] Centurion go thy way and as thou hast
[46:31] believed so be it done unto thee and his
[46:34] servant was healed in the selfsame hour
[46:37] and when Jesus was come into Peter's
[46:40] house here comes another and all right
[46:43] just right after this when Jesus comes
[46:45] into Peter's house he saw his his wife's
[46:48] mother laid and sick of a fever and he
[46:52] touched her hand and the fever left her
[46:55] and she arose and ministered unto them
[46:58] when the even was come they brought unto
[47:00] Him many that were possessed with devils
[47:02] and he cast out the spirits with his
[47:05] word and healed all that were sick that
[47:08] it might be fulfilled which was spoken
[47:10] by Isaiah the prophet saying himself
[47:13] took our infirmities that's our diseases
[47:16] and bare our sicknesses over and over we
[47:23] find that is when we look at this in the
[47:27] message God would bring our attention to
[47:30] these things here in this hour that you
[47:33] know what brother Branham would say said
[47:35] if you said you're gonna go to the
[47:37] doctor and you say to the doctor heal my
[47:39] arm he said the doctor would laugh at
[47:41] you he said because the doctor can heal
[47:44] your arm the Lord does the healing the
[47:48] doctor only sets the bone with the cast
[47:52] but the Lord does the healing
[47:54] so he said healing lll it is as a
[47:57] developing of cells it's a
[47:59] multiplication of cells but the gifts
[48:02] that God sends in the body is to bring
[48:05] the people to a recognition of the
[48:07] presence of Almighty God because we can
[48:11] recognize his presence then what we have
[48:15] need of can be released to you and I
[48:18] that's the purpose is to recognize his
[48:21] presence even like Elijah was with the
[48:24] Gaza thereand Dothan remember brother
[48:26] bream tells us an unveiling of God he
[48:29] said God did not bring the Angels down
[48:31] but he said what God did has changed the
[48:34] seeing of his servant he said the angels
[48:36] were always there and he said so is it
[48:39] the God that always was it's been here
[48:42] the whole time
[48:43] now it's loosening the eyes that we can
[48:46] see that God you see God didn't send a
[48:49] new Bible that's not what the message is
[48:52] it's not another Bible but the message
[48:54] is the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[48:57] God's thoughts that our eyes have been
[49:00] anointed to be able to see what is in
[49:04] the book and to see our selves and then
[49:07] that right there it will build our faith
[49:10] in what the word has said about us
[49:13] that's perfect faith himself and I love
[49:23] that scripture himself took our
[49:25] infirmities I just I love that scripture
[49:28] it just so grips my heart himself took
[49:31] our infirmities you know it's the same
[49:33] Lord Jesus in his body right here
[49:36] tonight it's the same Lord Jesus in his
[49:42] body tonight remember what Jesus said
[49:44] John 5:19 what a harmony the Sun can do
[49:47] nothing but what do you see if the
[49:49] father doing and that do it the son
[49:50] likewise you see Jesus didn't just go
[49:53] around and just when what we were
[49:55] reading last week scripture after
[49:57] scripture reading that and listen that
[50:00] was two also there's teaching that the
[50:02] Lord is bringing our way on healing but
[50:04] it's also in building our faith there
[50:07] was not one disease not one thing on
[50:10] countless times through the scripture
[50:12] there's not one thing that Jesus left
[50:15] untouched
[50:17] there wasn't one sickness there was an
[50:19] anything could overcome but he himself
[50:22] took our infirmities
[50:25] but listen to me he just fitness we seen
[50:28] last night Jesus did not go around and
[50:31] show off he did not come and let's say
[50:34] you know if brother justwe was sick he
[50:37] did not come over there and say I'm just
[50:39] gonna heal you know it is based not on
[50:42] his faith it's based on brother just
[50:44] raise faith but to see the ministry and
[50:48] that working of that life is to do what
[50:51] bring the individuals personal faith to
[50:55] a level to receive their healing that
[50:58] takes the operation of the Holy Ghost
[51:01] and that's God's desire because remember
[51:04] how we are that sons and daughters of
[51:07] God delivered what love the father hath
[51:11] bestowed on us that we should be called
[51:13] the sons of God so to recognize as a son
[51:16] of God we have been given authority in a
[51:19] domain that domain begins right here in
[51:22] this body Paul would say let every man
[51:24] nota possess his vessel under
[51:26] sanctification and honor when a wrong
[51:28] thought comes your way you have
[51:30] authority to reject it and say you can't
[51:33] resign here when sickness or anything
[51:35] tries to come your way you have a right
[51:38] in the word just stand against that when
[51:40] Satan wants to make an affront and your
[51:42] hope you have authority to say get out
[51:45] you're not welcome here then token is
[51:47] apply to this hole as a son and daughter
[51:52] of God you have a right this is what the
[51:58] word comes to do it comes to empower
[52:01] that son or daughter of God on the
[52:04] inside this is the hour this message
[52:08] that God has brought to us is the answer
[52:10] of the challenge of this hour it is the
[52:14] answer and the call for what has been
[52:17] prayed for for what has been waited on
[52:19] it is God coming and fulfilling his word
[52:22] when all the prophets had prayed a brown
[52:25] they paid prayed about not only the
[52:27] coming the first coming and the
[52:29] outpouring of the Holy Ghost but they
[52:31] have prayed for the coming of the Lord
[52:34] they are praying when their there would
[52:37] be
[52:37] a renewal upon this herd they have paid
[52:40] for these things and now notice its paws
[52:42] who put the burden on their heart to
[52:45] pray in that way and the Saint gotta put
[52:48] the burden is the same God who comes to
[52:50] fulfill his word it's all God no glory
[52:54] goes to man it's all the Lord so we have
[52:58] this promise where he said in his word
[53:01] whoever two or three are gathered
[53:03] together in my name there am I in the
[53:08] midst what a promise that we have the
[53:13] preaching of the word
[53:15] why when the ministering of the word
[53:18] here there's so many channels so many
[53:21] facets to it it's that our faith would
[53:24] be brought up is that we would see who
[53:26] we are
[53:27] it's that direction as the hour that
[53:29] we're in it sometimes just snap us out
[53:32] if we become a little bit dazed with
[53:34] situations it's to inspire and bring
[53:37] faith in our life and with it all with
[53:40] the preaching of the word it is the
[53:43] Spirit of God that follows behind that
[53:46] word and where the Spirit of the Lord is
[53:49] there is Liberty there's Liberty now
[53:59] when we recognize that the word what the
[54:03] word has said to us you know brother
[54:08] Branham would take the example in the
[54:09] message perfect faith and he would speak
[54:12] to us regarding that vision that God how
[54:16] God spake by the vision concerning the
[54:18] little boy that was raised in Finland
[54:20] and brother Bryan would bring that in
[54:21] the message perfect faith and he would
[54:24] speak to us and encourage us and say the
[54:28] same way said has God spoke through a
[54:30] vision in this day for that boy to be
[54:33] raised up he said to recognize if there
[54:36] was any vision he said that is not
[54:38] according to this the vision is wrong he
[54:42] said because this is more than the
[54:44] vision see any vision it must come in
[54:49] line with God's Word
[54:50] and what was it what was the whole part
[54:53] within that that our faith would be
[54:55] built in the Word of God that's the hope
[54:59] that's the Ministry of Malachi for
[55:02] revelations Tim seventh is that our
[55:05] faith would be restored turned back to
[55:09] original Bible faith not something
[55:14] that's of of the of the intellect but it
[55:17] is a Bible faith brought by a Bible Holy
[55:21] Ghost now want you to think of this here
[55:26] and I'm gonna read just some of these
[55:28] points to you because when we're looking
[55:31] at this brother Branham was getting
[55:32] ready to preach this is just a few
[55:35] little bit before the Lord were taking
[55:38] home here it is in 1965 works as faith
[55:41] expressed and he's getting ready to
[55:44] preach the rapture he says but the Lord
[55:46] came to me tonight he said before I was
[55:48] getting ready to preach that message on
[55:50] the rapture and he said he is said to me
[55:53] pray for the sick tonight and I want
[55:57] sure what's what brother Graham says he
[55:59] says so tonight he said well he said I'd
[56:02] like to have one of those old-fashioned
[56:04] prayer lines here we are with in 1965
[56:09] here at the end he said I would like to
[56:11] have one of those old-fashioned prayer
[56:13] lines and we realized brother Brandon
[56:16] goes into that message and he's letting
[56:18] us know that everybody that comes
[56:20] through the prayer line and he he
[56:22] reaches Clare all the way back just
[56:23] because they come across it doesn't mean
[56:26] that they get healed when they have a
[56:28] prayer line but he says remember he said
[56:30] there's some people he said that are
[56:32] trying their best to work themselves
[56:35] into a place to be healed he said you
[56:38] can't do that it's by grace now if you
[56:42] just bear with me a moment
[56:43] how brother Ram will go through it's all
[56:45] laid out in the message but there's many
[56:47] times where we in our being our own
[56:50] makeup it
[56:51] yeah I'll say it like this it's easier
[56:54] many times for us to become anxious
[56:56] sometimes depending on your makeup more
[56:59] than others it's easy and the scripture
[57:01] would even regard this and tell us in
[57:04] the book of Philippians be careful for
[57:06] nothing that phrase means be anxious
[57:08] about nothing is that right the Lord
[57:11] Jesus even addressed that even in the
[57:13] daily cares of life
[57:15] don't be consumed don't be anxious for
[57:17] these things but brother Brown would
[57:18] tell us that that there that there's a
[57:20] difference but he goes into bringing us
[57:23] to a place that it must be if faith
[57:26] itself will drop within that heart even
[57:29] when they come across the prayer line
[57:31] even when it was discernment or when
[57:33] they were passing him through in the
[57:34] prayer line
[57:34] it had to be faith would drop in the
[57:37] heart of the individual now God has
[57:39] raised let me just say it like this
[57:41] there would be that God has a way to
[57:44] operate if our faith needs a little
[57:47] charge God does not mind giving a charge
[57:53] you don't look down and say well why do
[57:56] you need a charge of your faith but
[57:59] everything itself remember God is
[58:01] building and he knows exactly what you
[58:04] and I what we have Nita it's to
[58:07] recognize brother Ram would go into that
[58:08] part and say they recognize that who the
[58:12] Lord Jesus was when you recognize who he
[58:15] is then what you have need of is
[58:18] released to you now in mark chapter 5
[58:21] verse 22 maybe I'll just move through
[58:23] this scriptures here quickly but here
[58:26] you have a man by the name of gyrus that
[58:29] I was a Bible reader we're very familiar
[58:31] with gyrus gyrus brother Ram would call
[58:33] him a secret believer he came to the
[58:37] Lord Jesus there was a need in his home
[58:40] his little daughter I believe you sung
[58:43] about it tonight his little daughter
[58:45] they were as she was taken medicine
[58:48] doctors and things like that but there
[58:50] was nothing she wasn't getting better
[58:51] you know here it was a situation that
[58:55] let's just say like this there might
[58:57] have been somebody in the house in the
[58:59] same subdivision that had the same
[59:01] situation and they took medicine and
[59:04] their daughter or son got better
[59:06] it wasn't the medicine it was the part
[59:09] that God was coming to bring gyruss out
[59:13] of the
[59:14] Paul said if we could say it he was a
[59:15] secret believer but God was coming and
[59:18] allowing a situation that would draw him
[59:21] out to make a decision
[59:24] well thank God for His grace but when
[59:28] God does that God has something to prove
[59:32] and make real to our hearts now notice
[59:37] what gyrus says here in verse 23 he
[59:41] besought him greatly and he says my
[59:43] daughter lieth at the point of death
[59:45] I pray thee come and lay thy hands on
[59:50] her that she may be healed and she shall
[59:55] live now hear Jesus they may move toward
[59:59] Genesis home in verse 27 no right in the
[1:00:02] midst of this journey here comes the
[1:00:04] woman here with the issue of blood the
[1:00:07] Bible says in verse 27 when she had
[1:00:10] heard of Jesus she came in the press
[1:00:12] behind and touched his garment for she
[1:00:16] said if I may touch but his clothes I
[1:00:20] shall be whole that was her testimony
[1:00:25] are you with me
[1:00:27] Jesus never told her that if you touch
[1:00:30] me you'll be made whole her faith
[1:00:33] declare if I can touch his garments I'll
[1:00:36] be made whole her faith are you with me
[1:00:41] now her faith could not ray say that her
[1:00:43] faith in that place was not because she
[1:00:46] was a real sharp person and she had you
[1:00:49] know a lot of memory of Scripture she
[1:00:50] had good DNA it one wasn't because what
[1:00:53] she had faith because her mom and dad
[1:00:55] and we believe in devotions and all
[1:00:56] those things it was not about her it was
[1:00:59] her faith but it was God remember she
[1:01:04] recognized God was present in Jesus
[1:01:08] Christ her faith was in the reality God
[1:01:12] is present in this ministry it's like
[1:01:20] the little black girl that was down
[1:01:21] there in the South era I believe
[1:01:25] Arkansas she got lost from her daddy I
[1:01:29] mean them the throngs of people that
[1:01:32] were there you know I think of you know
[1:01:34] I didn't go into Jonesboro but brother
[1:01:37] Matt Morris his daddy was taking me
[1:01:38] around the one that was down there
[1:01:40] preaching and showing me different
[1:01:41] things and as we went over there and you
[1:01:43] know I've just here we are down in that
[1:01:46] area and you're thinking about this she
[1:01:48] separated amongst a throng of people and
[1:01:52] she's blind but this was her testimony
[1:01:56] she comes into a place she didn't
[1:01:59] realize she bumped into brother Brennan
[1:02:01] she didn't realize that but there's one
[1:02:05] thing that she said she said if you can
[1:02:08] get me to the healer she said I'll find
[1:02:11] my daddy let me just tell you something
[1:02:14] what she recognized she recognized it
[1:02:17] wasn't brother Branham but God was
[1:02:20] prescient in that ministry she couldn't
[1:02:23] see the miracles taking place but
[1:02:25] brother supernaturally she heard and she
[1:02:29] believed God is present in that ministry
[1:02:33] she didn't have to know how was this
[1:02:36] optic nerve and how's this going to be
[1:02:37] it was that's that's not for us to
[1:02:39] figure out as a matter of fact God don't
[1:02:42] even need an optic nerve he is the
[1:02:45] creator in the scriptures you have those
[1:02:48] that did not have any eyes and God
[1:02:51] created their eyes and in this
[1:02:53] generation the same faith God created
[1:02:56] eyes and the Prophet would stop and say
[1:02:59] pardon me I forgot to ask you what color
[1:03:02] you want that is a living God present
[1:03:09] among us Oh glory be to God she is
[1:03:19] seeing Jesus he realizes virtue has gone
[1:03:23] out of him and he commends her if I just
[1:03:28] may skip a little bit he commends her
[1:03:31] daughter my faith hath made the whole
[1:03:34] goal in peace and be hold of that
[1:03:38] plank she was confident in that now here
[1:03:42] we resume in verse 35 here's the here's
[1:03:47] the ruler of the synagogue gyrus who
[1:03:50] were reading about they come running out
[1:03:53] to him now think about it and they make
[1:03:56] this statement that daughter is dead why
[1:03:58] trouble the master any longer I want you
[1:04:02] to watch this I love this portion of
[1:04:04] Scripture Jesus hearing the saying be
[1:04:09] not afraid only believe he was aware
[1:04:16] just like it is with you and I sometimes
[1:04:19] we can receive reports we can receive
[1:04:22] things that will come our way that want
[1:04:25] to bring fear sometimes we hear rumors
[1:04:30] or we hear this whether it's about your
[1:04:32] job whether it's things that you deal
[1:04:34] with within sickness or whatever it
[1:04:36] might be but notice Jesus catches that
[1:04:40] and he says be not afraid only believe
[1:04:45] he's on his way to lay hands on her and
[1:04:49] he took hope he took faith hope and
[1:04:52] charity Peter James and John the brother
[1:04:55] of James he comes into the place here
[1:04:59] they are weeping notice the atmosphere
[1:05:01] this was not an atmosphere this was not
[1:05:05] an atmosphere where healing could come
[1:05:07] the atmosphere had to be right
[1:05:09] you recognize atmospheres important
[1:05:12] atmospheres not just in part in
[1:05:14] receiving your healing but atmosphere is
[1:05:17] important in retaining your healing so a
[1:05:21] better breath says you God can heal you
[1:05:23] and he said you get out there amongst
[1:05:26] amongst a bunch of unbelievers that
[1:05:28] don't believe like you do and don't
[1:05:31] believe that God heals the sick and he
[1:05:34] said you watch that which was left you
[1:05:37] now will come back because why it's an
[1:05:40] atmosphere if you don't break away from
[1:05:42] it
[1:05:43] atmosphere is important Genesis 1 there
[1:05:46] is an atmosphere and the word
[1:05:49] has is the creating of the right
[1:05:53] atmosphere that's why it's important to
[1:05:56] be in the right atmosphere fellowship
[1:06:00] but brothers and sisters of like
[1:06:01] precious faith I don't even listen it
[1:06:06] doesn't even matter if you're on the job
[1:06:07] and we know we can't control the
[1:06:09] atmospheres in the job but listen you
[1:06:13] don't have to stay around and listen to
[1:06:15] things that are so negative and vile and
[1:06:19] everything else I know some of you work
[1:06:20] in situations and some of you just you
[1:06:22] have then an opportunity to put
[1:06:24] noise-canceling headphones on just to
[1:06:25] block out a lot of stuff around you but
[1:06:28] you know what the reality of that is is
[1:06:30] don't let that negativity come in to
[1:06:33] your mind even if it's simply just
[1:06:37] playing a little soft music hallelujah
[1:06:46] he's sending the atmosphere just right
[1:06:49] the atmosphere has got to be set just
[1:06:52] right remember they were laughing at him
[1:06:54] they everything out he Jesus put them
[1:06:56] all out of the house get out and he took
[1:06:59] the mother and father and brought them
[1:07:02] in the Bible says and he took the damsel
[1:07:04] by the hand remember javis request
[1:07:07] come and lay the hands on my daughter
[1:07:09] and she shall be made well different
[1:07:13] than what the Roman centurion spoke when
[1:07:15] he said Speak the word only is that
[1:07:18] right but notice Jesus says he said
[1:07:21] damns I saying to thee arise and she
[1:07:25] arose she she was healed what a
[1:07:30] testimony of the mercy of Almighty God
[1:07:33] and what I'm just just looking at a
[1:07:35] little point here within this just in in
[1:07:39] this many many ways brother Branham
[1:07:41] would talk about with laying on of hands
[1:07:43] he said the reason that my ministry
[1:07:45] isn't as effective in America as it is
[1:07:50] overseas he said is because in America
[1:07:53] he said people are very anxious for you
[1:07:55] to lay hands on them now just stay with
[1:07:59] me now uh-huh
[1:08:02] he said but notice he said the Roman
[1:08:05] he's prevented that's a Jewish tradition
[1:08:07] but it's scriptural are you with me
[1:08:10] it's Scripture he said but this Roman
[1:08:14] centurion did not have that tradition
[1:08:17] but the Roman centurion what he
[1:08:20] recognized remember he said I'm a man
[1:08:22] under authority he recognized God was
[1:08:25] present in Christ he recognized over
[1:08:28] every disease over every sickness you
[1:08:30] are over in all all you have to do you
[1:08:34] speak to where you talking about
[1:08:36] revelation he realized that every
[1:08:38] sickness remember it's a demon he
[1:08:41] recognized it's an angel that fell from
[1:08:44] his first estate to know somebody and he
[1:08:46] recognized that the water is above every
[1:08:50] disease above every sickness of every
[1:08:53] situation he had to apply the word glory
[1:08:59] be to God
[1:09:00] Cyrus was applying the word to come home
[1:09:04] now
[1:09:04] but gyruss was channeled in that way he
[1:09:07] had that hands for hands to be laid off
[1:09:10] but notice Jesus never said to him that
[1:09:13] come on why you have to have hands laid
[1:09:15] on when try this tradition jesus never
[1:09:17] took that approach and they just said he
[1:09:21] never took that approach in this hour
[1:09:23] either I read to you one one I read to
[1:09:28] you one place here at the end where bill
[1:09:31] addressed us or would like to have an
[1:09:32] old-fashioned prayer line again see the
[1:09:36] balance that we're looking at right here
[1:09:38] brother Branham is not in this right
[1:09:41] here and many other quotes brother
[1:09:42] Branham is not taking away from the
[1:09:45] scripture but rather it's that our faith
[1:09:48] would be positioned in the right person
[1:09:55] indeed anyone what it was they might
[1:09:58] they might need hands later on it might
[1:10:00] be a service when hands are being laid
[1:10:02] up but it might be a service where the
[1:10:04] word as it's coming forth if you can
[1:10:06] receive that word the word can come and
[1:10:09] bring healing right there
[1:10:10] in your body and in your
[1:10:13] you see it's to recognize its faith in
[1:10:17] Jesus Christ the finished work of
[1:10:20] Calvary glory be to God it's our
[1:10:26] personal faith and that finished work
[1:10:28] see brother Branham is dealing with how
[1:10:30] everything was so inclined to you know
[1:10:32] God I have hands laid on and that's why
[1:10:34] brother Graham said the idea he said
[1:10:36] it's not to touch me as a matter of fact
[1:10:38] in one place
[1:10:39] brother Brown refers the lady he said
[1:10:40] you see that picture he's talking about
[1:10:42] the picture there taken in Houston Texas
[1:10:44] where there where the the pillar of fire
[1:10:46] here the angel of the Lord we have this
[1:10:49] picture taken with us and brother Graham
[1:10:51] could say he said you see that picture
[1:10:53] right there
[1:10:53] he said not what you need to look at is
[1:10:55] is to recognize there's one right there
[1:10:58] in that picture he said not me he said
[1:10:59] that one that's representing there in
[1:11:01] that picture he said is right here he
[1:11:03] said I'm just like the brass serpent
[1:11:07] what was the brass serpent it was that
[1:11:10] of a vessel to look and live you see God
[1:11:15] makes himself real he wants our faith to
[1:11:20] be energized that's what God will come
[1:11:24] and speak so personally through his word
[1:11:26] you got a need in your life and Scott
[1:11:29] will come through and speak to that need
[1:11:31] a question you've got deep in your life
[1:11:33] and you feel like everything's exposed
[1:11:36] where did that come from that's rooted
[1:11:38] so deep in me that's caught letting you
[1:11:40] know he's making himself visible by his
[1:11:44] word that he is the same yesterday today
[1:11:47] and forever then what should I do
[1:11:50] let your faith rise and say I accepted
[1:11:53] Lord the idea through the Rebbe said the
[1:11:59] idea isn't to touch me it's to touch him
[1:12:01] over and over brother branham within the
[1:12:04] within the services and I refer to that
[1:12:06] place of the woman with the issue of
[1:12:09] blood and and here you would find
[1:12:11] different ones here they were they were
[1:12:14] believing they were praying and then we
[1:12:17] find here the Spirit of God brother
[1:12:20] banwen inter and intra vision things
[1:12:22] would be be made known to this person
[1:12:24] what a brother Brahim say he would
[1:12:25] ask us the question who did they touch
[1:12:31] he is the high priest the Bible says in
[1:12:34] Hebrews 4 that is touched by the feeling
[1:12:37] of our infirmities aren't you glad about
[1:12:43] that think about John Ryan John Ryan
[1:12:51] came he came in the prayer line he was
[1:12:55] pronounced well he goes off he still
[1:12:58] can't see comes right back around and
[1:13:01] what's you think of this the Prophet he
[1:13:07] catches his background Catholic got to
[1:13:13] give him something to do works go
[1:13:17] testify of your healing is that right so
[1:13:20] you never minimized and says man your
[1:13:22] faith is weak man oh we understand it
[1:13:24] will get into the degrees of and how
[1:13:26] faith itself yeah we move but notice he
[1:13:29] never ever condemned that he's a go
[1:13:33] testify of your healing I'll tell you
[1:13:37] right now I believe in my heart we'd
[1:13:40] have a lot more things done in our life
[1:13:41] if we took that simplicity he's the high
[1:13:44] priest of our confession well brother
[1:13:49] brother say no I'm not sure you know I
[1:13:50] can't know all the way believe it down
[1:13:52] here but believe it up here and brother
[1:13:54] Brent says you keep saying it until you
[1:13:56] believe it down here when you know that
[1:14:01] God has spoke to your heart about
[1:14:03] something that something God has made
[1:14:06] personal to you you may not see it in
[1:14:10] your life you may not even feel it in
[1:14:12] and about whether you feel it or not you
[1:14:14] gotta be like Mary Mary was positive
[1:14:17] before she was ever positive that's a
[1:14:21] quote
[1:14:22] she was positive for she was positive
[1:14:24] why what could she be positive she was
[1:14:28] positive that God's Word is positive God
[1:14:32] has spoke to me before I feel anything
[1:14:35] the world has already declared it
[1:14:43] hmm often thought you know my dad would
[1:14:47] say he said you know when that barber
[1:14:48] took out after John Ryan he said I
[1:14:51] wonder if the barber actually wanted to
[1:14:53] shake his hand about the testimony or he
[1:14:55] just one of his apron back so I could
[1:14:56] going back to you know aren't you glad
[1:15:03] that healing and miracles and the move
[1:15:05] of God aren't you glad it means
[1:15:07] something to you brother Brown talks
[1:15:11] about in the situation's you know that
[1:15:13] our president and what some many things
[1:15:15] that were going on brother Brown he
[1:15:17] brings a difference you know to where he
[1:15:20] said you know you've had people that he
[1:15:22] was talking above a certain case where
[1:15:24] you know coming right off out of the
[1:15:25] wheelchair they're not even been a
[1:15:27] prayer line no hands laid on him I think
[1:15:30] of what brother Branham says on the
[1:15:31] message in time I think it's in time the
[1:15:34] seed sign I think it was where brother
[1:15:37] Branham deals with he says I there was a
[1:15:38] woman a lady that was laying on a cot he
[1:15:41] said I walked to the platform and never
[1:15:43] touched her he said well what I did I
[1:15:45] preached the word and I held to that
[1:15:47] word and he said while the word was
[1:15:49] being preached she got up off of the cot
[1:15:52] what was all that about was for you and
[1:15:55] I the whole party comes down to is that
[1:15:58] our faith would be placed in the word if
[1:16:02] this hour we've got to have rupturing
[1:16:07] faith but the good thing about it is it
[1:16:12] isn't you or me working it up God is
[1:16:15] providing service after service day
[1:16:20] after day and more and more that keeps
[1:16:22] coming our way more as dropping we're
[1:16:24] seeing ourselves more clearly what is it
[1:16:25] it's quickening power what mercy brother
[1:16:32] Branham said this up here he's trying to
[1:16:33] get the people he said the presence of
[1:16:35] the Lord was there to heal he said this
[1:16:37] what I'm speaking of he said that's the
[1:16:39] way God likes to do it he says this this
[1:16:41] is on a higher level than just laying on
[1:16:44] of hands he says you know he goes in
[1:16:48] talking about remember how Billy Branham
[1:16:49] was was criticized about Oral Roberts
[1:16:52] and or different ones were saying well
[1:16:54] you know all Roberts can pray for
[1:16:56] hundreds and a Allen he but you only
[1:16:58] pray for a few brother brems said the
[1:17:00] difference is that's gifts of healing he
[1:17:03] said this is a prophetic gift it's
[1:17:08] different that one a gift of healing is
[1:17:12] to touch each one but this is a
[1:17:14] prophetic gift to declare he is now here
[1:17:18] is that right is is for us to recognize
[1:17:22] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:25] forever now let's look let me look here
[1:17:29] let me refer this here in acts 14 verse
[1:17:32] 8 and there said a certain man here is
[1:17:35] Paul ministering in acts 14 8 there said
[1:17:38] a certain man at Lystra impotent in his
[1:17:40] feet being a from his mother's
[1:17:43] womb who never had walked and the same
[1:17:47] heard Paul speak who steadfastly
[1:17:50] beholding him and perceiving that he had
[1:17:54] faith to be healed I don't know if a man
[1:17:58] came into the meeting with the faith
[1:18:00] already or the preaching of the word
[1:18:03] brought it to that place but whatever
[1:18:06] well however it was remember it is
[1:18:09] always your personal faith that brings
[1:18:13] the results and plow perceived this man
[1:18:18] had faith who was it how could Paul
[1:18:21] perceive that because the Saint Spirit
[1:18:23] of God that was a night thing Paul in
[1:18:26] Paul's life delivering the word it was
[1:18:28] the same God that couldn't move and make
[1:18:31] known your faith is in the right place
[1:18:33] are you with me your faith is in the
[1:18:36] right place older think about it one of
[1:18:38] these mornings a man that faith is going
[1:18:41] to be right in the right place will be
[1:18:44] changed in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:18:47] eye we've already heard
[1:18:49] shouter we've been a symbol by the
[1:18:53] message of the hour oh my were waiting
[1:18:56] on the voice of the resurrection are you
[1:19:00] with me to think about this the faith
[1:19:04] the perception of where it's even act
[1:19:06] within this hour oh brother sister I
[1:19:14] don't believe these things are far out
[1:19:15] there I believe it's right here I
[1:19:16] believe it's right here and I say that
[1:19:21] as a personal witness of that notice
[1:19:23] what Paul did he said with a loud voice
[1:19:26] stand upright on thy feet you know why
[1:19:33] Paul could say that cuz he perceived a
[1:19:35] man had faith to be healed are you with
[1:19:38] me
[1:19:41] but the bram could say like this to you
[1:19:44] and I he said Jesus he said even if he
[1:19:47] was wearing the suit that he gave me he
[1:19:50] could do no more for you than what your
[1:19:53] faith will release to you don't you see
[1:19:56] where the enemy wants to so hold back
[1:19:58] and make it like it's got to be somebody
[1:20:00] it's got to be this no it's Lord
[1:20:02] energize my faith but we don't have to
[1:20:07] wait listen you don't have to wait for
[1:20:08] service your faith the Bible says in the
[1:20:11] book of Jude building up your most holy
[1:20:13] faith but I am thankful that when we've
[1:20:20] been a little weak I'm so glad that God
[1:20:23] is mindful aren't you glad all brother
[1:20:28] Sandra brother branham never never never
[1:20:30] he you know he didn't want hands laid on
[1:20:32] him that was a Jewish race you haven't
[1:20:34] read all the way see this is not what
[1:20:37] I'm even bringing tonight I'm trying to
[1:20:39] bring that balance to show that within
[1:20:41] these things because you have
[1:20:43] individuals and people and I believe
[1:20:45] they mean good but they want to step it
[1:20:47] out here in a way and say when we're
[1:20:48] just going to speak the word only we
[1:20:50] believe that but we also believe laying
[1:20:53] hands on the sick that's still the
[1:20:55] scripture same as speaking the word are
[1:20:58] you with me and by an in the very very
[1:21:01] beginning
[1:21:02] of the adoption series adoption part 1
[1:21:04] right towards the end of it brother Ram
[1:21:06] talks about how but he was sick in his
[1:21:07] house he said how I would have give
[1:21:09] anything for somebody to come over and
[1:21:12] laid hands on me and prayed for me she's
[1:21:18] a balanced brother BAM one coming
[1:21:19] against laying on hands this is where in
[1:21:22] like I said and I I look at these things
[1:21:25] my heart's desire what God moved on my
[1:21:28] heart upon these things right here is
[1:21:30] that our heart because sometimes you
[1:21:33] have people say well I'm just gonna wait
[1:21:34] I'm not coming up to be prayed for I'm
[1:21:37] just gonna wait I'll tell you right
[1:21:39] right now if I got a need I'm getting to
[1:21:42] Jesus you better believe it I'm getting
[1:21:45] to Jesus if I've got a need in my life
[1:21:47] I'm not gonna be quiet about it
[1:21:48] I'm calling some people to pray that
[1:21:52] Scripture I don't have nothing to prove
[1:21:55] I'm not to prove he proves his own word
[1:21:59] I'm not the one who decides how it comes
[1:22:02] he is the one but irregardless it is all
[1:22:06] the word
[1:22:19] remember when this was done the Bible
[1:22:21] goes on to say how that you know the
[1:22:23] people said ma the gods are come down
[1:22:24] among us and in the likeness of men
[1:22:28] brother bran would take it up in perfect
[1:22:30] faith and he said somebody's saying well
[1:22:32] I got all the faith I got all the faith
[1:22:34] the Ben says if you got all the faith
[1:22:36] why are you up in the prayer line then
[1:22:37] see he's not listened to me he's not
[1:22:40] knocking the prayer line I'm sorry I
[1:22:43] don't have the greatest speech and words
[1:22:44] to put together but I only know how to
[1:22:45] say it how I am he's not knocking that
[1:22:48] he's not saying anything against it what
[1:22:50] he's letting them know is is that don't
[1:22:52] imagine anything let God if our faith
[1:22:57] needs to be stimulated let God said Lord
[1:23:01] help out my unbelief God moves weathers
[1:23:06] honesty but I don't care I'm healed I
[1:23:11] just I know that by His stripes I'm
[1:23:13] healed
[1:23:14] flatout by His stripes I'm healed you
[1:23:18] see what's happenin and I'll say it like
[1:23:20] this the way that Satan would work he
[1:23:24] would work to try to take such a
[1:23:27] tremendous word that has been given to
[1:23:30] us but then maybe a come across in a
[1:23:35] manner as though it's prideful of you so
[1:23:39] I don't need to take ass for not just
[1:23:40] believe God that's pride I don't need to
[1:23:44] go to doctors I that's pride well I
[1:23:47] don't need I don't need hands laid on me
[1:23:49] that's pride you see the thing of it is
[1:23:52] faith being declared it's not something
[1:23:55] you're declined because what brother
[1:23:56] brems said we had to have faith so I'm
[1:23:58] just going to say that I've got faith
[1:23:59] know it's being real with the word but
[1:24:01] when we see things in the word coming
[1:24:04] out and we see our lives and Lord take
[1:24:06] me there I want to go there that's why
[1:24:10] brother Branham in on the wings of a
[1:24:11] snow I dug he said this revelation has
[1:24:15] led me to a faith I never had before I'm
[1:24:23] willing to be led how about you in order
[1:24:26] to lead me to a faith that I've never
[1:24:28] had before
[1:24:30] oh my you see there takes the stimulates
[1:24:35] that's why brother branham would say and
[1:24:38] I had a an individual is wanting to
[1:24:40] question me about the message and things
[1:24:42] like that and knew this happened and
[1:24:44] that happened and I just thought I said
[1:24:45] hold on a second
[1:24:46] I said you realize I said that they're
[1:24:48] not one vision the vision don't heal
[1:24:50] nobody I said you know that the vision
[1:24:56] don't heal nobody the vision only makes
[1:24:59] you aware of his presence this is the
[1:25:04] words the Prophet declares to us he said
[1:25:07] you can come across right here he said
[1:25:09] in here here you come through the vision
[1:25:11] you receive your healing and you can
[1:25:13] lose it by the time you go off it's not
[1:25:16] the vision that heals you see in all
[1:25:19] these things I know I'll tell ya it's
[1:25:21] hard to not preach this but all of these
[1:25:23] things that comes down to our personal
[1:25:25] faith we needed help
[1:25:30] like Sarah Sarah couldn't see yourself
[1:25:35] this is why brother Graham could say I
[1:25:37] believe it was Abraham's faith that
[1:25:41] produced the miracle in Sarah's womb but
[1:25:44] when you break over into Hebrews 11 you
[1:25:47] realize that that faith that was there
[1:25:49] in Abraham was held right there and that
[1:25:52] faith now became preeminent in Sarah's
[1:25:55] life where it said she judged him
[1:25:59] faithful she received due to mass
[1:26:01] strength to conceive Oh thankful to
[1:26:06] Almighty God that God seized what we
[1:26:09] have needeth and the releases that's
[1:26:11] what he's done in this generation that's
[1:26:13] what the message of the hour is revealed
[1:26:16] to you and I it is the same original
[1:26:19] faith that is revealed and moved into
[1:26:23] our hearts not a church faith not a
[1:26:26] church document but the same Living God
[1:26:34] the vision where the RAM says that's
[1:26:37] what remember how he would say many
[1:26:38] times he said now no no no if he feels
[1:26:41] if you
[1:26:43] v/o some would it help your face that's
[1:26:49] precious would it help your faith
[1:26:52] because it's your faith my faith that
[1:26:54] releases it you say why would that be
[1:26:59] because anything less than that we don't
[1:27:02] have what it's needed to sustain the
[1:27:04] enemy wanting to come back the good man
[1:27:07] of the house is your faith you're with
[1:27:11] me so I brother Branham could say he
[1:27:13] said I watch I think it's one of the
[1:27:17] messages title of faith in it I did
[1:27:19] I remember where those on the road here
[1:27:21] in it but anyhow brother Graham says
[1:27:23] here he says when he said you take
[1:27:25] somebody he said that's got a spirit he
[1:27:27] said they're bound they're possessed
[1:27:29] with a devil he said you better be
[1:27:31] careful he said because if you take that
[1:27:33] off and they don't have the faith to
[1:27:35] resist it it'll come right back see it's
[1:27:38] not playing around these are not playing
[1:27:40] around it's all is what is it doing why
[1:27:42] God works this way to build our face and
[1:27:46] let me tell you something the devil can
[1:27:48] try when God has healed you of something
[1:27:50] the devil can trying to come around with
[1:27:51] a pain try to come around the flow
[1:27:53] duration and say see it didn't go
[1:27:55] that's your faith you stand right there
[1:27:56] as a son and daughter God say you're a
[1:27:58] liar Your Honor I have already been made
[1:28:02] free of that you're not welcome here no
[1:28:04] more glory be to God blessed be the name
[1:28:10] of the Lord
[1:28:12] it's an operation brother Rama talk
[1:28:14] about how here they are being healed he
[1:28:16] said look he said this had just took
[1:28:18] place that wasn't my faith this is our
[1:28:21] message God provided way healed
[1:28:23] it wasn't my faith this was an operation
[1:28:25] of the Holy Ghost through me that give
[1:28:28] her faith her own faith is what made her
[1:28:32] well
[1:28:37] another place in 1965 right towards if
[1:28:42] it's two days later well he said tonight
[1:28:46] we're gonna have an old-fashioned prayer
[1:28:47] line we're just going to pray for the
[1:28:51] sick the way we used to brother Jack and
[1:28:53] brother Brown
[1:28:55] it never took away from parent lines it
[1:28:58] never took away from laying hands on the
[1:29:00] sick I even when you look at that of
[1:29:04] proverbs 31 proverbs 31 so who can find
[1:29:07] a virtuous woman write it these
[1:29:11] scriptures are more than a Mother's Day
[1:29:12] card come on this is speaking of the
[1:29:15] bride of Jesus Christ and you look at
[1:29:18] one of one of the scriptures within here
[1:29:20] one of the parts in verse 20 it says she
[1:29:22] stretched out her hand to the port yay
[1:29:25] she reaches her hands to the needy it's
[1:29:32] dealing with sickness needs mark 16
[1:29:36] these are the general orders of the
[1:29:41] church
[1:29:42] these orders ain't changed some have
[1:29:45] tried to edit those orders and italicize
[1:29:47] them and read this one in the original
[1:29:49] manuscript well I'll tell you one thing
[1:29:50] this sure wasn't in the original
[1:29:51] manuscript about going and building
[1:29:53] schools dominations wasn't in there come
[1:29:58] on somebody that wasn't in there but
[1:30:01] these are the general orders of the
[1:30:04] Church of the Living God familiar
[1:30:07] Scripture we've been reading a lot but
[1:30:09] verse 18 they shall lay hands on the
[1:30:14] sick and they shall recover
[1:30:17] so if lay hands on the sick is a
[1:30:20] weakness of faith then Jesus put into
[1:30:23] General Orders can y'all give me a few
[1:30:28] more moments I'm not gonna run to a nine
[1:30:30] o'clock by promised I maybe I should
[1:30:32] have said that but I'm not on 100 nine
[1:30:34] o'clock but listen brother branham takes
[1:30:38] the example in The Reader's Digest now
[1:30:40] you can even read this you can even read
[1:30:42] things right now you can pull up where
[1:30:44] they have people coming in and praying
[1:30:45] for people in hospitals and the effects
[1:30:47] of it but brother Brown talks about an
[1:30:49] example that took place over in London
[1:30:51] where Newsweek and Reader's Digest they
[1:30:53] got a hold of this of where they were
[1:30:56] talking they said all the divine healers
[1:30:57] are loose but what it was it was it was
[1:30:59] people who believed in praying for the
[1:31:03] sick and they were going in there and
[1:31:05] they were praying over the sick so what
[1:31:06] they did
[1:31:07] the scientists in different ones they
[1:31:09] wanted to see one is it that's closing
[1:31:12] were these people to get better any
[1:31:13] funny science tries to figure things out
[1:31:16] rogram said they took he said they
[1:31:18] actually took a piece of lead foil
[1:31:20] he said no anybody knows lead will
[1:31:22] reflect the lights and they took the
[1:31:24] camera and they put it on there and
[1:31:26] we're here was a believer a man that was
[1:31:28] praying for another one he laid his
[1:31:30] hands on him and began to pray and
[1:31:32] coming out of the man's hands and on
[1:31:35] that lead and coming back it was a ray
[1:31:38] of light and brother Graham said see he
[1:31:41] said God knew what he was talking about
[1:31:43] when he said they shall lay hands on the
[1:31:47] sick and they shall recover
[1:31:50] amen you sell about it tonight
[1:31:52] I sold the life and now I am the light
[1:31:57] amen when you sister when you have that
[1:32:00] like sister Amanda when Hattie was six
[1:32:02] there that day you laid hands on her and
[1:32:04] you prayed over her right there going
[1:32:07] out was right Ray's going out what were
[1:32:10] the light rays that is the working of
[1:32:13] the Holy Spirit a man is right in the
[1:32:19] body hey man light is in the body eyes
[1:32:23] have come and eyes have come to thy body
[1:32:26] might be full of light this is the hour
[1:32:30] where Elijah lays himself on the child
[1:32:34] God took over the body hallelujah Oh
[1:32:41] glory this is what how the scripture
[1:32:44] would say how that even Paul he rocks
[1:32:48] fish spend God brought special miracles
[1:32:50] by the hands of Paul let me just let me
[1:32:56] just move here we'll pick that scripture
[1:32:59] up for some other time but here Paul and
[1:33:03] I just without reading it you can read
[1:33:06] it tonight or at the time and that's 28
[1:33:08] they come to the hottest the island of
[1:33:11] Malita Paul is going around getting wood
[1:33:16] he goes around and gets wood Paul wasn't
[1:33:19] going into a box
[1:33:21] rattlesnakes where the tempo of the
[1:33:25] music was worked up know if Paul was
[1:33:27] putting getting wood on the fire and
[1:33:28] there was a Viper
[1:33:30] that was in there Paul didn't reach in
[1:33:33] to grab it he reached in to get the wood
[1:33:34] and the Viper latched on him the
[1:33:37] promises they shall take up serpents
[1:33:40] come on now
[1:33:41] if they give if they come on them Paul
[1:33:44] notice where the people think of how God
[1:33:47] did this I think how God did this this
[1:33:50] one the gardener snake some of that we'd
[1:33:53] have been screaming I'm gonna call him
[1:33:56] on your names this was a Viper and the
[1:34:01] people of that are innocent how God
[1:34:02] knows to do things he'll testify of his
[1:34:06] glory right in the midst of a situation
[1:34:08] the people looked at him as this guy's
[1:34:11] got to be a murderer he's a bad guy look
[1:34:14] what happened to superstition right
[1:34:16] Oh bad guy you know I'm a super a bad
[1:34:20] guy but here they begin to realize the
[1:34:24] Bible said they had a change of mind
[1:34:25] because they saw Paul he shook it off
[1:34:27] and he kept going he's getting weakened
[1:34:31] he grew stronger you know what that did
[1:34:33] that opened an opportunity for the
[1:34:37] gospel think about it Paul would have
[1:34:40] been raising his hand saying I want to
[1:34:42] get bit by Viper no but it was an
[1:34:44] opportunity God came through and there
[1:34:48] were those of that were need of healing
[1:34:50] and the Bible says right here right here
[1:34:53] Paul Cain the Bible says in verse in
[1:34:56] verse 8 it says and the father of publix
[1:35:00] lay sick of a fever and a bloody flux to
[1:35:03] whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid
[1:35:06] his hands on him and healed him hey they
[1:35:11] recognize this is a reality there's a
[1:35:15] supernatural one present in this man's
[1:35:18] life is that right Paul laid his hands
[1:35:23] on them and then we find how that the
[1:35:27] desert that many that were with disease
[1:35:29] as they came and they came brother
[1:35:32] branham he makes a statement and I'm
[1:35:34] I'm closing I've went through a lot here
[1:35:37] brother branham here in that message
[1:35:40] God's chosen place of worship he's
[1:35:44] asking the people is anybody sick he
[1:35:47] talks about the handkerchief that are on
[1:35:48] the platform before him he prays over
[1:35:50] those handkerchiefs but here's what he
[1:35:52] asked the people to do he said I'm gonna
[1:35:54] ask you to do me a favor he said you
[1:35:57] know the Bible said these signs shall
[1:35:58] follow them that believe and they shall
[1:36:00] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[1:36:02] recover if you notice what it says they
[1:36:05] shall recover Satan wants to try to set
[1:36:08] times they shall recover
[1:36:13] blugh Benson I'm asking you as a
[1:36:15] believer to lay hands on somebody in
[1:36:17] front of you look what he says Lord the
[1:36:24] hands of these people laying on each
[1:36:28] other they are symbolizing their faith
[1:36:34] so laying on of hands does not mean you
[1:36:37] have less faith you're symbolizing your
[1:36:40] faith they're symbolizing their faith
[1:36:44] Lord in the promise they shall lay hands
[1:36:47] on the sick and they shall recover the
[1:36:51] ground goes on to pray and he said now
[1:36:52] everybody that accepts their healing
[1:36:54] upon the basis of the written word make
[1:36:56] your testimony by standing to your feet
[1:36:58] and say I now accept my healing in the
[1:37:00] name of Jesus Christ aren't you glad
[1:37:14] or the brand would say it this clear in
[1:37:15] token is the last nigh read in Dallas
[1:37:18] Texas he said may every person passing
[1:37:23] through here present their token that
[1:37:26] they have received the Holy Ghost that
[1:37:28] they are born again child of God that
[1:37:31] they believe it with all their heart and
[1:37:33] as they pass through may they curse that
[1:37:36] disease and affliction of their body and
[1:37:38] may they go out of here rejoicing
[1:37:41] knowing that their faith has made them
[1:37:46] whole he says Lord God as we laid as we
[1:37:50] laid the Old Testament our hands upon
[1:37:52] the sacrifice to identify ourselves with
[1:37:54] the sacrifice we lay our hands upon
[1:37:56] Jesus and identifying ourselves with him
[1:38:00] he laid his hands upon us now in the
[1:38:05] ministry identifying himself with us by
[1:38:08] signs and wonders and we are laying our
[1:38:11] hands upon the set to identify ourselves
[1:38:13] with them with our faith connected with
[1:38:16] them sickness has to go it's all
[1:38:22] connected we have identified think of
[1:38:27] what think of the reality what God has
[1:38:30] done with the message that he promised
[1:38:33] us in it has brought us back into the
[1:38:36] identity of the true sacrifice and
[1:38:39] coming into that identity he has
[1:38:43] identified himself with us he identified
[1:38:47] himself in the ministry of the Prophet
[1:38:51] we are identified in that ministry
[1:38:54] because that ministry is not outside of
[1:38:56] the body it is in the body it man's so
[1:39:01] that here he has identified himself with
[1:39:05] us so laying on her hands
[1:39:08] I know it may not been deep and I don't
[1:39:10] worry about that anyhow my point is is
[1:39:12] that when I look what was just what God
[1:39:14] just pushed pressed on my heart is the
[1:39:16] fact that this right here what however
[1:39:19] God deals with your heart
[1:39:22] you obey there's times for prayer lines
[1:39:29] some of you know you've been here long
[1:39:31] enough there's times when I have I have
[1:39:32] that the Spirit of the God of the Lord
[1:39:34] has told me a week ahead of time and I
[1:39:36] would tell you get ready on Thursday
[1:39:37] night we're gonna have a prayer line and
[1:39:40] needs of how God has met we don't just
[1:39:44] call him to caller right but there's
[1:39:49] needs when we have needs God knows what
[1:39:53] our needs are I say it like this it may
[1:40:00] and may not see a lot with when we're
[1:40:02] just in our regular services but I've
[1:40:04] said this very clearly
[1:40:05] I believe there's needs in the body of
[1:40:09] Jesus Christ the Prophet was never
[1:40:14] against the prayer lines and if somebody
[1:40:17] if somebody is against that I don't have
[1:40:20] anything against them but if they do if
[1:40:21] that's where that's where their faith is
[1:40:23] that that's between them and God but as
[1:40:26] for me and Myles
[1:40:28] we believe that the word can come we're
[1:40:31] witnesses listen you don't even have to
[1:40:33] be here to receive the Holy Ghost you
[1:40:36] can receive and write in your seat while
[1:40:37] the words being preached reality you
[1:40:42] don't even got to be in a church house
[1:40:44] Lutron say you don't got to be in a
[1:40:46] church house receive your healing he
[1:40:48] said you can be in a cornfield
[1:40:51] it shows it's not about a person God can
[1:40:57] speak to you through this ministry but
[1:40:59] my hands are not what does the work it's
[1:41:02] your faith in anyone else it's your
[1:41:07] faith the whole thing is that our faith
[1:41:09] would raise within him to stand up on
[1:41:12] his word and accept it I missing Lord I
[1:41:18] believe I believe it amen because let me
[1:41:22] just say some laying hands on the sick
[1:41:24] in just for the preachers
[1:41:28] my little darlings laid hands on me many
[1:41:31] times in a good way when I'm when I'm
[1:41:33] not been feeling well oh yeah
[1:41:38] and she's prayed my boys I've had to
[1:41:42] call him say boys I need you to pray for
[1:41:44] daddy
[1:41:44] I need I need a touch from God or else
[1:41:46] I'm not gonna be able to stand and
[1:41:48] preach let him come and pray that's the
[1:41:52] scripture man we have been given
[1:41:56] authority they shall lay hands on the
[1:41:57] sick and they shall recover it's our
[1:42:00] faith standing upon that word let's pray
[1:42:03] father Lord we thank you tonight for
[1:42:07] your mercy Lord Jesus we Lord we rejoice
[1:42:14] Lord and as we look through Lord in your
[1:42:17] word and Lord in many least times
[1:42:20] sometimes in a service like this it's
[1:42:22] more of a of a service Lord we're just
[1:42:24] just kind of ordering some things
[1:42:26] balancing some things revisiting Lord
[1:42:28] some things that Lord if there's
[1:42:30] anywhere where the enemy would try to
[1:42:32] take something from us or or try to push
[1:42:34] us in a certain direction Lord we want
[1:42:37] to stay balanced in your word and Lord
[1:42:40] we do not want to be a people that just
[1:42:42] says the Lord in a manner well I you
[1:42:44] know I I don't need to have hands laid
[1:42:46] on me Lord we see that that that doesn't
[1:42:49] even fit in the scripture Lord that does
[1:42:53] not fit Lord within the message Lord we
[1:42:55] don't want pride around our lives we
[1:43:00] don't want that Lord I don't know
[1:43:02] believer once that but we thank you for
[1:43:05] the balance Lord the whole focus was

[1:43:12] finished work of Calvary it's to rest in
[1:43:15] you Lord we thank you for that
[1:43:21] as your profit would make known to the
