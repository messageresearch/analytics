[19:35] I was running out of time.
[19:40] Sin
[19:42] separated.
[19:44] The bridge was far too wide.
[19:48] But from the far side of the chasm,
[19:53] you held me in your side.
[19:57] So you
[19:59] made a way
[20:02] across the great divide.
[20:06] Left behind
[20:08] heaven's throne
[20:10] to build it here inside.
[20:14] Oh, and there

[20:58] Brought me from the darkness
[21:02] into glorious
[21:05] light.
[21:08] Oh, you
[21:11] took my place,
[21:13] laid inside my tomb of sin.
[21:17] You were buried for three days
[21:21] and then you walked right out again
[21:26] and now death has no sin
[21:30] and life has no end.
[21:34] So I have been transformed
[21:39] by the blood of the lamb.
[21:43] So thank you Jesus for the blood
[21:49] of life.
[21:52] Thank you Jesus you have washed
[21:58] me why.

[22:40] [Applause]
[22:42] Let's sing and I was born to serve the
[22:44] Lord.
[22:45] Amen. As our pastor comes
[22:51] from the dust
[22:54] of the earth,
[22:58] God
[23:00] created man.
[23:03] His breath
[23:06] made him a living soul.
[23:14] Thank God
[23:16] so loved the world
[23:19] that he gave
[23:22] his only son
[23:25] and I
[23:28] [Music]
[23:30] loving
[23:38] in his likeness
[23:41] created
[23:44] in his image.
[23:46] For I
[23:49] was born to serve the Lord
[23:56] and I
[23:59] can't deny him. I will always
[24:04] walk beside him. For I
[24:09] was born to serve the Lord.
[24:17] My hands were made made
[24:23] to help
[24:25] my neighbor.
[24:28] My
[24:29] [Music]
[24:31] name
[24:32] should be God's word.
[24:38] and my feet
[24:41] were made
[24:43] to walk
[24:45] in his footsteps.
[24:48] My body
[24:51] is to love the Lord.
[24:58] For I
[25:00] in his likeness,
[25:04] created
[25:06] in his image.
[25:08] For I
[25:11] was born to serve the Lord
[25:18] and I
[25:21] can't deny him. I always
[25:26] walk beside him. For I
[25:31] was born to serve the Lord.
[25:39] And I
[25:41] can't deny him.
[25:44] I always
[25:46] walk beside him.
[25:49] for I
[25:52] was born to serve the Lord.
[25:58] [Music]
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:03] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:08] Amen. We certainly thank God for his
[26:10] grace.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what a reality it is that that
[26:14] so has resonates within our hearts that
[26:17] that's really our purpose of being here
[26:19] is really is to serve the Lord.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; And what whatever that God has in store
[26:25] as far as for our life, the purpose and
[26:28] all that it is is we know that there's
[26:30] one thing that's for certain is that
[26:33] when we've come into that place of what
[26:34] the main purpose is, the prophet tells
[26:36] us is to be born of the spirit of God.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then however that God would
[26:43] choose to use us in his great economy
[26:45] and for whatever
[26:47] time that's all in his hands.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; And brother Bram would say it like this.
[26:52] He said, "When he's finished with me
[26:54] here, I'm ready to go."
[26:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "I don't want to stay a moment
[26:58] later."
[27:00] &gt;&gt; You know, it's something how God just
[27:02] will so place that in our hearts. you
[27:04] know, even within it. I I thought about
[27:07] even you know you can see that sometimes
[27:10] you know in different ones and even
[27:13] beforehand and and yet then there's
[27:15] other times where there's things that so
[27:18] happens unexpectedly and
[27:21] I sent out a text to the church here the
[27:24] other day when I had found out news with
[27:26] brother Bruce Jakowski
[27:28] went on home to be with the Lord and um
[27:31] I had uh spoke with brother John Martin
[27:33] on the phone. We just actually had um uh
[27:36] communicated because of uh taking
[27:39] brother Timothy uh to meet someone from
[27:42] his church on Friday and uh brother
[27:45] Bruce, you know, he led songs there. And
[27:47] so I I talked with brother John and I
[27:49] asked, you know, I asked him to convey
[27:52] our love and greetings to sister Donna
[27:55] and um also to the church and that we
[27:57] would be praying for him. And um you
[28:00] know I asked brother John I said brother
[28:02] John was it something that I said I'm
[28:04] assuming that it was really unexpected
[28:06] and brother John he said it was he said
[28:09] brother Bruce was working the previous
[28:12] day on Monday with a jackhammer busting
[28:16] up concrete around his house and he said
[28:19] he overdid it. And so, um, you know,
[28:24] even sometimes when things are, you
[28:26] know, expected or not, it's it's it's
[28:29] difficult. And so, we want to remember
[28:31] the Chakowski family in prayer. Brother
[28:33] Bruce was a a good friend. He hadn't
[28:35] been here in a while. And the last time
[28:38] he was here, I know I was out of town.
[28:39] My dad was still living, but Brother
[28:42] Bruce, I still remember um him coming
[28:45] and uh always remember him, you know,
[28:48] playing the trumpet. That was kind of
[28:49] like the signature, but he was a really,
[28:51] really good minister of the gospel. And
[28:54] I remember him just coming and brother
[28:55] Bill Maria opening their home and the
[28:58] church just, you know, getting started
[28:59] over the over the years and brother
[29:01] Bruce staying there and, uh,
[29:03] ministering, you know, services there
[29:04] for us. And so, uh, we certainly as a as
[29:08] a people and as a body, we certainly
[29:09] have been blessed, amen, by the ministry
[29:12] of brother Bruce. And I know not
[29:13] everybody knows him, but uh most that
[29:16] has been here or you've been around and
[29:19] you you met remember brother Bruce. And
[29:21] I never forget a time down in um we were
[29:24] in a meeting and um uh the meeting the
[29:27] pre-ervice had had um went a little
[29:31] long. It was um about an hour and a half
[29:35] before the minister got called out and
[29:38] um and I remember brother brother
[29:40] Hildebrandt stepped out to minister and
[29:42] when he did cuz people were just you
[29:44] know you're just tired. you're right out
[29:45] in the heat and people are tired. And I
[29:47] remember brother brother brother brother
[29:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[29:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[29:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[29:48] brother brother brother Hildebrandt he
[29:50] just asked that nobody would sing but he
[29:53] had brother Bruce stand up and play only
[29:56] believe with the trumpet
[29:59] &gt;&gt; and there was I don't know how to
[30:01] explain it to you know I mean I love
[30:03] worshiping friends I love singing I love
[30:05] all that but you know there's always
[30:07] like the prophet says with times and
[30:09] things people will worry but I just
[30:11] remember there was such an anointing
[30:14] that came and it was just like a wind of
[30:17] refreshment that came into that building
[30:20] &gt;&gt; when as brother Bruce was just praying
[30:22] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[30:25] and uh it changed it really changed the
[30:27] outcome you know within that service and
[30:30] uh so I just so appreciate you know
[30:32] brother Bruce and you know sometimes you
[30:35] we were talking with the boys there at
[30:36] home I said you know sometimes what it
[30:38] is you don't we were trying to remember
[30:40] the last time we had seen him because
[30:42] the boys they had you know being up at
[30:44] the tri-state meeting sometimes brother
[30:46] Bruce would come in there to brother
[30:48] Paul's and um support that. And so I
[30:51] think Paul or one of them was mentioning
[30:53] how they had saw him one of the latter
[30:55] times up there and I think the last time
[30:58] we saw him was at brother John
[31:00] Lefontine's uh passing his funeral. Um,
[31:04] but you know, one thing about it, we're
[31:06] we're going to meet soon and very soon.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; And uh, so I I just um I don't mean to
[31:13] take a lot of time with that, but I want
[31:14] you just to remember, please remember
[31:17] sister Donna and um, and the girls in
[31:20] prayer there and his his family and
[31:22] extended family, grandchildren, and so
[31:24] forth. And so I asked Brother John to
[31:29] communicate to us any of the details. I
[31:31] have not received anything from brother
[31:32] John, but they were supposed to be
[31:34] getting all that arranged. And so, as
[31:36] soon as I'll know anything like that,
[31:38] we'll definitely pass it on to you as an
[31:40] assembly uh regarding that for brother
[31:42] for brother Bruce because I don't know
[31:43] when they're going to do any services or
[31:45] anything like that. But soon as I hear
[31:47] that, I'll pass that on to you all and
[31:49] get that to you. Um
[31:52] so, let's just um let's stand if we
[31:55] could. And um we just want to go before
[31:59] the the Lord in prayer and
[32:03] Amen.
[32:07] Amen.
[32:11] Heavenly Father,
[32:13] Lord, as we just are so thankful, Lord,
[32:16] to be able to once again come into your
[32:19] presence. What a wonderful atmosphere,
[32:22] Lord.
[32:24] Dear God, we know that it's not the
[32:25] brick and mortar.
[32:28] It's not even strings of instruments
[32:32] that create that, Lord.
[32:35] But, Father, the Bible's so true. You
[32:38] dwell in the praises of your people.
[32:42] Lord, how that God as we come in here,
[32:45] Lord, from all walks of life and been
[32:48] through the toils and everything of the
[32:50] day, the weak, there's burdens, there's
[32:52] needs, there's questions, Lord, even
[32:56] Father, within our with lives, things
[32:58] that Lord that we would be facing. Some
[33:01] things we know of and other things we
[33:03] don't. But Lord, we're here
[33:07] that we might be refreshed in your
[33:09] presence, Lord.
[33:11] that we might be washed by the water of
[33:14] the word. Lord,
[33:16] we ask that God that you would as you're
[33:19] here, may you just take your word and
[33:22] speak to us through your word. Lord,
[33:25] minister, Lord, to our needs. Help us,
[33:28] Lord. I pray that God that our focus,
[33:31] our attention, our hearts would be
[33:34] directed Lord, Father, as you would
[33:37] direct us and guide us. Lord, you know
[33:40] the the request and what we have need
[33:42] of. And so, Lord, even as we lift up
[33:45] these needs, there were many, Lord, that
[33:48] were spoken and unspoken tonight, Lord.
[33:51] Different ones among us, Lord. I know
[33:54] different ones, Lord, dealing with
[33:56] sickness. Some are recovering, Lord,
[33:58] from sickness and different things,
[34:00] Lord, from being together this past
[34:02] weekend. And I pray that God, may you
[34:05] continue to strengthen, Lord, each one,
[34:07] Lord. I pray that father may you just
[34:11] Lord continue to Lord minister now to
[34:14] the Jacowski family Lord dear God how
[34:18] we're so thankful for the life of
[34:20] brother Bruce Jakowski so thankful God
[34:22] for our brother Lord Jesus there's just
[34:25] so many fond memories and Lord how that
[34:28] God you have so
[34:31] Lord made and so Lord fashioned each of
[34:35] each of us Lord for that purpose to
[34:37] serve that purpose, Lord, for us and I
[34:40] know for Sister Don and them, Lord, it
[34:42] has taken us by surprise. But Lord,
[34:46] nothing has taken you by surprise.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we trust you, Lord, even in
[34:51] these moments that we we don't
[34:54] understand, Lord, but we trust you,
[34:56] Father. And we ask that God that you
[34:59] would Lord so comfort Sister Donna
[35:02] and Lord the girls Lord which Lord
[35:06] they're more than girls now they're even
[35:09] beyond that of young ladies Lord but
[35:11] would you just comfort them Lord
[35:15] minister to each of them Lord your God
[35:18] as I heard brother John Lord brother
[35:20] John Martin the other day on the phone
[35:23] just expressing God our condolences Lord
[35:27] Father, how our brother expressed, "Yes,
[35:29] we're going to miss him. He led worship
[35:32] for us."
[35:34] Oh God, may you comfort that assembly.
[35:37] Lord, comfort Brother John. Lord, may
[35:41] you just, Lord,
[35:43] a great friend that stickketh closer
[35:45] than a brother. May your presence, Lord,
[35:48] I pray, just just move, Lord, I pray, to
[35:52] every heart, Lord, in that assembly,
[35:54] Lord.
[35:55] Lord, have your way. I pray, Father.
[35:59] Lord, tonight we ask that you would,
[36:02] Lord, once again, just hide us behind
[36:05] the cross, Lord. May you come and just
[36:09] speak to our lives and our needs, Lord.
[36:12] You know the very things that we have
[36:13] need of, Lord. And we just want to be
[36:16] guided by you, Father, in every way. We
[36:19] just commit this service into your hands
[36:21] now, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[36:26] Amen.
[36:27] Amen.
[36:32] I would like if you just to turn with
[36:35] me.
[36:45] Let me get it here.
[36:50] 1 Corinthians chap 12 verse 27.
[37:12] 1 Corinthians 12 and verse 27.
[37:17] I just love how the Holy Spirit when God
[37:21] would move right down through Paul and
[37:24] just working with each of this in the
[37:26] Corinthian church.
[37:29] And I love how brother Brandham so
[37:30] brings the focus and you can read that
[37:33] in the very first verse or the first
[37:36] chapter where Paul lets them know who
[37:39] they are positionally. So it wasn't just
[37:41] the Ephesians that he would let know who
[37:45] you are and you've been positioned. But
[37:47] some of the very first opening verses in
[37:49] Corinthians, 1 Corinthians chapter 1, he
[37:53] lets them know of their position and who
[37:55] they are. But then within these things,
[38:00] how that it would never take anything
[38:02] away, but just to put things not only in
[38:06] its order, but even with the right
[38:09] perspective of how to look at these
[38:11] things. And I'm so glad that God would
[38:14] take time to deal with this. Aren't you?
[38:18] You know, God just doesn't come by and
[38:20] just let us know, well, this is wrong or
[38:22] this is wrong. But he takes time to deal
[38:24] with our lives. I'm so glad. I'm glad.
[38:26] I'm glad he just don't, you know, bring
[38:28] correction through his word. But I'm
[38:30] grateful through that correction he
[38:32] teaches us. Paul would write here in
[38:34] verse 27, "Ye are the body of Christ and
[38:38] members in particular." So your part in
[38:43] the economy of God and God hath set in
[38:46] the church first apostles, secondarily
[38:49] prophets, thirdly teachers, after that
[38:52] miracles, then gifts of healing, helps,
[38:55] governments, diversities of tongues. And
[38:59] he would say, "Are all apostles?
[39:03] Are all prophets?
[39:06] Are all teachers?
[39:08] Are all workers of miracles?
[39:11] have all the gifts of healing? Do all
[39:15] speak with tongues?
[39:18] Do all interpret?
[39:21] But covet or desire earnestly
[39:25] the best gifts, and yet show I unto you
[39:30] a more excellent
[39:32] way. Now, when Paul writes this by the
[39:35] spirit of God, he's not he's not leading
[39:38] the church away from gifts. He's not
[39:41] leading them away from there. He would
[39:43] not be a true servant of God,
[39:47] but he's leading them into the right way
[39:51] or the right character or the course of
[39:54] conduct or what should actually be the
[39:58] oversight
[39:59] of everything.
[40:02] I show unto you a more excellent way.
[40:06] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[40:08] reading of the word as you're being
[40:09] seated. I want to
[40:12] continue on here just a a little bit
[40:14] this evening on a more excellent way.
[40:17] Um,
[40:19] but before I do that, I want to I
[40:22] mentioned to you back in um I think in
[40:24] February
[40:26] um that I would have here at a time
[40:29] dealing with things that we've covered
[40:32] uh within the gifts and things like that
[40:34] if there was any questions and answers.
[40:36] And I know I get um labeled within my
[40:40] own household of being thorough
[40:43] to a fault. Um but um you know I don't
[40:47] um even if everything's of being
[40:49] thorough I I can't do anything unless
[40:51] God inspires me to to minister it. But
[40:55] if there is questions and things
[40:58] regarding that of things that we've
[41:00] brought I I would would love to be able
[41:02] to prepare and then to have some time to
[41:05] uh be able to bring that here. And if
[41:07] you have that, I would appreciate if you
[41:10] would email me and it' give me a little
[41:12] bit of time to gather and go back over
[41:14] some things uh that's here. And I know
[41:17] we we understand this as believers. I
[41:19] don't think any any of us would ever
[41:21] have the wrong motive within this. And
[41:23] I've seen sometimes with questions and
[41:24] answers of things to where that it's
[41:27] it's really not questions and answers.
[41:29] It's it's actually statements or things
[41:31] that's being made to try to put a
[41:33] different point across. So I've I've
[41:36] seen those types of things, but I don't
[41:38] I don't foresee that here. But just
[41:40] understand that um I believe when we
[41:43] have a question, it's something we
[41:44] desire that the Lord would would help us
[41:46] maybe to further understand. So if
[41:49] there's something within this that we
[41:50] have looked at within the gifts or the
[41:53] spiritual leadings and these things like
[41:54] that, if you just just email me, allow
[41:57] me just to be able to prepare a little
[41:59] bit. And um the other thing is is just
[42:02] as much as um one of the times here just
[42:05] recently um and I had to kind of mention
[42:08] some things to an individual and um I'd
[42:10] asked have you heard this particular
[42:12] Thursday service that I dealt with
[42:14] certain things on and then they were
[42:16] able to say oh brother Sammy I'm sorry I
[42:18] I didn't hear that. So they went back
[42:19] and were able to listen to that to that
[42:22] service. And um so just just please if
[42:26] you know I know with different times
[42:27] when different ones aren't here and I'll
[42:29] probably go over this on Sunday. Um it's
[42:31] very very important because uh to go
[42:34] back and to listen and to find these
[42:36] things of um what we're looking at how
[42:39] the Lord would lead us through this. And
[42:41] um you know uh and I I say that because
[42:44] one particular time I had I had had
[42:46] someone that was so you know they were
[42:49] so upset with me you know and I know
[42:51] that's hard to believe but uh
[42:54] one of the times but I had asked you
[42:56] know and the individual was just wanting
[42:58] to you know and and I mentioned I said I
[43:01] said um have you listened to the service
[43:03] I said that that was actually ministered
[43:06] within that and they said no and I don't
[43:09] plan on it. I how can I help? If you
[43:12] don't listen to it and we're going to go
[43:14] through it, we're going to I'm going to
[43:15] comb back through some of the same
[43:17] things, but it would help if you would
[43:19] do that. Then I can I we can talk about
[43:21] some of the quotes and scriptures and
[43:23] maybe it would, you know, settle things.
[43:25] But, you know, I kind of seen within
[43:27] that right there just the spirit itself
[43:29] just wasn't right and it wasn't going to
[43:31] be received no matter, you know, what
[43:33] was done. And um but I I just I believe
[43:36] as as believers, you know, when there's
[43:37] things we have questions and answers and
[43:39] brother Brandon would do that when it
[43:40] would come to seals and other things um
[43:43] the seals and then he would have other
[43:45] parts, you know, and just to try to keep
[43:47] things focused in a way upon some of
[43:50] these times. And I told you I would do
[43:51] that and I certainly want to stick with
[43:53] that because I know there's a lot that
[43:55] you know that was given. Um, but we want
[43:58] to look here tonight uh upon this and I
[44:01] just just you can I think that's pretty
[44:04] simple. Remember bswwtpastorgmail.com
[44:08] and um but I want to look here today a
[44:10] little bit more on that thought of of a
[44:12] more excellent way. And um the reason I
[44:16] just had placed this under that of of
[44:18] church order is because some of the very
[44:20] first statements that brother Brandon
[44:22] would make the first time he ever does
[44:23] church order there in 1958.
[44:26] And he makes this one of the opening
[44:28] statements that he makes within there
[44:30] when he's declaring what they believe at
[44:33] the Brandom Tabernacle. And he says it
[44:35] like this. He says, "I think first that
[44:38] every member or every worshipper of the
[44:42] Brham tabernacle should be so much in
[44:44] divine love with each other until their
[44:48] hearts would long for each other when
[44:52] they have to go away to leave each other
[44:55] at the service at night. I am a true
[44:57] believer in divine love." Now, the one
[45:01] thing that we'll look at here a little
[45:03] bit more tonight and how the Lord would
[45:05] take us and lead us is that divine love
[45:08] is not something that we and ourselves
[45:10] can just move into. It's not even
[45:13] something that we can even work up, but
[45:16] it's something that has to be given
[45:18] divinely by God. Yeah,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; it must be a resource when divine love
[45:24] being that remember the scripture says
[45:26] God is love and we also know that God is
[45:30] the word. We also know that is the Holy
[45:33] Ghost that all of all of this pertains
[45:36] to the one selfsame being. And so this
[45:40] when we think of it where brother
[45:41] Brandon would actually kind of set the
[45:43] direction for that of the church is
[45:45] first every member every worshipper. Now
[45:48] it it's I mean it's it's evident. You
[45:50] listen to the message, you go through
[45:51] it. You could read through it in
[45:53] Corinthians or whatever more. Well, did
[45:55] it ever come to a time that Brother Bram
[45:56] didn't have to deal with where they're
[45:58] preaching and ministering, at least what
[45:59] we can hear on tape, didn't have to deal
[46:01] with sin, didn't have other things that
[46:03] they had to deal with, church problems
[46:05] and all those other things. Not at all.
[46:07] As a matter of fact, you'll hear you'll
[46:08] hear those things being dealt with time
[46:11] and time again. But the difference is
[46:12] when he when he's bringing it down here
[46:14] in this way that this should be
[46:16] something that we check our hearts and
[46:19] our lives with. You know, I never forget
[46:22] one time a person, you know, was, you
[46:24] know, was, you know, everything. And it
[46:25] wasn't to me, but it was to a person.
[46:27] They were complaining and this and that
[46:29] and this and that and so forth. And just
[46:32] the the person just expressed to them
[46:34] and said, you know, uh it should be to
[46:37] where there would be such a love in your
[46:39] heart to where you not only cannot wait
[46:42] for the church doors to open, but to get
[46:44] in and to fellowship with your brothers
[46:46] and sisters that are there. and that
[46:48] that individual responded to to this
[46:51] person and said,"You know what? I don't
[46:52] feel I don't necessarily feel that way."
[46:55] So, you know, if you don't feel that
[46:57] way, then here's one of two things. I
[46:58] don't Christianize that person. It's
[47:00] just one of two things. If you don't
[47:02] feel that way, if there's something to
[47:04] where you have seen such the backside
[47:06] and everything has been pointed out,
[47:08] remember, you're always every we're
[47:10] always going to see one another's. We'll
[47:12] see one another's shortcomings. We're
[47:14] going to see that you work together. You
[47:15] live in the same house. Listen, before
[47:18] you got married, all you seen was the
[47:20] pretty curls. You didn't see what made
[47:21] them.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; You didn't see all those things. But
[47:25] once you get once you get together, it
[47:27] it will take the grace of God. The
[47:29] prophet said it like this. It'll take
[47:31] grace to keep that home together.
[47:34] There'll be a lot of give and a lot of
[47:36] take. Is that right?
[47:38] &gt;&gt; So, been it's the same way. I mean, even
[47:40] when the spirit of God has come in the
[47:42] midst of our lives, there's still that
[47:44] humanity part about us. But that's not
[47:47] an excuse. When the spirit of God has
[47:49] come into our hearts, we now are under a
[47:52] different ownership. And we have a
[47:55] strength and a power within us that is
[47:58] greater than anything that would have
[48:01] been a part of what our first birth was.
[48:04] That's why the new birth is not
[48:05] something that can be uh schooled into a
[48:08] person, taught into a person, but the
[48:10] new birth is a sovereign act of almighty
[48:13] God where God has brought that heart
[48:15] into a place of complete submission to
[48:18] his word and God steps in and he
[48:21] finalizes, he crowns, he quickens, he
[48:24] changes that life by his spirit and then
[48:27] it's the love of God that's set down in
[48:29] our life. And then this is where we can
[48:32] say that what can separate us from the
[48:35] love of God. That's where that that's
[48:37] where the love of God and the strength
[48:39] within our lives. So when we when we
[48:41] look at this, you know, it should be so
[48:42] much in divine love with each other
[48:45] until their hearts would long for each
[48:47] other when they have to go away uh to
[48:51] leave each other at the service at
[48:53] night. I am a true believer in divine
[48:56] love. Now, I don't read anything in
[48:58] there in the quote about running to my
[49:00] car trying to get away from people.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; I don't read that in there.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; But, you know, neither do I read in
[49:08] there that Brother Brandham is talking
[49:10] about that it's going to be a gathering
[49:12] of perfect humanity.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; It's not.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Every one of us sitting here are flawed
[49:20] human beings.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; That's not an excuse. But you know, it's
[49:24] an opportunity for God's grace to go to
[49:27] work in our lives.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; And so when we think of this here and
[49:32] looking at it, remember how Paul, let me
[49:34] just refer to a few places in the
[49:36] scripture here. I'm not going to put
[49:37] them up, but I want to refer to this
[49:39] place in Ephesians 1. And we know that
[49:42] this is our our our place and our
[49:45] position in Christ. And in Ephesians 1,
[49:48] it would speak of how that blessed be
[49:50] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
[49:52] Christ, who hath blessed us with all
[49:55] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[49:58] in Christ, according as he had chosen us
[50:01] in him before the foundation of the
[50:04] world, that we should be holy and
[50:07] without blame before him in love, having
[50:12] predestinated us until the adoption of
[50:15] children by Jesus, Jesus Christ to
[50:17] himself according to the good pleasure
[50:19] of his will to the praise of the glory
[50:23] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[50:28] accepted in the beloved.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; You you see what and we and we speak of
[50:34] this we can a lot of times you heard
[50:35] this but it was not us that made
[50:38] ourselves acceptable.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; It was his grace.
[50:44] You see, like the prophet said, love is
[50:47] ex is projected and when it comes to its
[50:49] end, then sovereign grace takes over and
[50:53] produces
[50:54] what love has called for. And so to see
[50:58] that God God's love has been projected
[51:02] and in his love being projected, his
[51:04] grace is what takes over in our life and
[51:07] brings us to that place to where our
[51:10] hearts are melded in his presence to
[51:14] where that that that revelation and it
[51:16] breaks upon our life. Let me tell you
[51:18] friends, you and I, what you and I were
[51:20] under, you know, Brother Bram said that
[51:22] he said, "I would have I would have
[51:23] served God at a much younger age, but it
[51:25] was a spirit that hung over me."
[51:28] &gt;&gt; He said it was a spirit that prevented
[51:30] me. But then he goes in to let us know
[51:33] that he says notice he said the
[51:35] preaching of the word is to cast that
[51:38] spirit away to where that heart can open
[51:41] up and to actually be able to accept
[51:45] what God has already done and wants to
[51:49] bring to reality in that life. So who is
[51:51] it that cast that spirit away? Was that
[51:53] was that you? Was that me? Was it man I
[51:56] pressed beyond that? No, it was God in
[51:59] his grace that would absolutely cast
[52:02] that spirit away and the heart that was
[52:05] already longing to serve God then could
[52:08] come into a place to accept what God
[52:11] desired to bring to a reality. I tell
[52:14] you, you talking about grace, it's
[52:16] nothing that could be merited at all in
[52:19] our lives. He goes on, Paul would go on
[52:22] in in the book of Ephesians in chapter 3
[52:25] and he would write about those things
[52:27] that he was praying even for the
[52:30] believers that they might know the
[52:32] depths of the love of God that there is
[52:34] there is depths to God's love. How many
[52:36] believe that tonight? There is depths to
[52:38] God's love. It's not just it's not just
[52:40] something that you know takes place in
[52:42] our life and just maybe one time and
[52:45] here but there's a depth in our life.
[52:47] You know, you can know God's love even
[52:49] when you look back on your life before
[52:52] you experienced it by way of the new
[52:54] birth. You can even look back on your
[52:56] life and realize that God had his hand
[52:58] upon your life all along. You know why?
[53:00] Because there's no way you could not
[53:03] break beyond the threshold of time. If
[53:06] you're a seed of God, you can't break
[53:07] beyond that threshold of time without
[53:10] being sealed with the spirit of God.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; That's the God God's got a promise. It
[53:15] cannot escape that. And so God would
[53:17] would have his hand the whole time upon
[53:20] our lives. And I I know, you know, many
[53:21] times a person can say, "Well, you know,
[53:23] I thank God for keeping me from death
[53:25] and I thank God for this." But, you
[53:26] know, thank God for his grace that not
[53:28] only did that, but thank God for his
[53:30] grace that he brought it to a place to
[53:32] turn our hearts into a place of of
[53:35] surrender to him.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy on that. And
[53:39] this is where Paul would write that his
[53:42] prayer is that that that the church
[53:44] would come into that place that they
[53:47] would know the depths of the love of
[53:49] God. And Paul would write it this way in
[53:51] Ephesians 3:17. He would say that Christ
[53:54] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[53:58] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[54:02] be able to comprehend with all saints
[54:05] what is the breadth, length, depth and
[54:08] height and to know the love of Christ
[54:11] which passes knowledge that you might be
[54:14] filled with all the fullness of God. So
[54:18] when we when we we come into this place
[54:20] of it there there is the right emphasis.
[54:22] This is where we were looking at the
[54:24] last time that we were together on many
[54:26] of the ways that brother Brandon was
[54:28] drawing and and bringing out of how that
[54:30] he was he was catching this among you
[54:33] know the churches and things that they
[54:35] were actually putting the emphasis upon
[54:38] the wrong things. And sometimes this
[54:40] with emphasis is not altogether where
[54:43] someone can come out and say this and
[54:45] this and this. Sometimes it's just as
[54:47] simple as sometimes uh that things can
[54:50] be stated as I mentioned to you before
[54:52] that you know after the ministering of
[54:53] the word is over and then someone would
[54:55] step to the platform and say well let's
[54:57] just see what the Lord will say and you
[55:00] know if then to look at that and to not
[55:02] catch that it would almost be that
[55:04] everything that was done beforehand was
[55:07] not even God speaking and let's just see
[55:09] what he'll say. That reminds me of
[55:12] though of the Pentecostal traditions
[55:14] where the prophet said they would take
[55:16] they would speak to him and say as long
[55:18] as the anointing is on brother Brandham
[55:20] and that discernment's going on he's a
[55:22] prophet but don't listen to his
[55:25] teaching.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; It's incredible. Just seen even a
[55:28] YouTube video of you know a man who has
[55:30] all them you know the private jets and
[55:32] everything else all around and the very
[55:33] thing that he mentioned to one of one of
[55:36] the other individuals that wrote some
[55:37] book and he brings up you know brother
[55:39] Brandham's name. Oh, you know, William
[55:40] Brown, all the the miracles and the
[55:42] faith that he did, but but he's
[55:43] teaching. That's where he he shouldn't
[55:45] have got into the teaching and and to
[55:46] think of it to to think that they would
[55:48] stand there and to make those statements
[55:50] like that. But you know what? They can't
[55:52] help it. They're ignorant of that. The
[55:53] thing of it is is the reason they would
[55:55] do that is because it goes against their
[55:58] own belief.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And you know what God did? The message
[56:01] itself, it did not come to take us out
[56:03] of the Bible. It came to make the Bible
[56:06] live. It came to restore us back to
[56:09] Bible faith.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; That's why the whole ministry of the
[56:12] seventh angel, he plants the seed of the
[56:15] entire Bible so that it would be a bride
[56:18] that would be a biblebelieving
[56:20] bloodwashed bride that would have a
[56:24] complete confidence in the word of God.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this the right
[56:30] emphasis, this is what we want. You
[56:31] know, even when we look at this in our
[56:33] homes and everywhere, our church,
[56:35] everything, we want to have the right
[56:38] emphasis. The right emphasis. Notice 1
[56:41] John 4 11. John would write this,
[56:44] "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
[56:48] also to love one another." Now, John's
[56:51] not given a Sunday school lesson. Is
[56:53] remember this? This is the very man that
[56:56] when things didn't go his way before or
[56:58] how he thought they ought to go, he was
[57:00] ready to call fire down out of heaven.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, that John was before
[57:05] the Holy Ghost came, he was okay as long
[57:08] as everything was going according to how
[57:10] he thought it ought to go. But remember,
[57:12] Jesus said when he wanted to call fire,
[57:14] now he was using scripture. He said,
[57:16] "Should we do this like Elijah did it?"
[57:18] But Jesus said, "You don't know what
[57:20] spirit you're of." But you see what
[57:22] happened to John? You say what what
[57:24] happened to John? Did John go through a
[57:26] seminar of love? You know, did he step
[57:29] into a bucket of honey? What happened to
[57:31] John? I'll tell you what happened to
[57:33] John. He met God in a very personal
[57:36] experience. He he came to know him more
[57:39] than just walking with him. He came to
[57:42] where that the comforter itself came on
[57:45] the inside. And it would absolutely
[57:48] change him to where that John's the
[57:50] whole message and everything that would
[57:52] deal with was about the divine love of
[57:55] God because when the real divine love of
[57:58] God I know Christian scientists like the
[58:00] prophet said he said oh they can outdo
[58:02] and many of the fruits of the spirit and
[58:04] everything else but they cannot outdo on
[58:07] the evidence of walking completely in
[58:09] the word of God. And that's what the
[58:11] real love of God in our life will do. It
[58:14] will take God's word above our own
[58:15] thoughts, above our own opinions, above
[58:18] our own feelings. And his word, it's not
[58:20] just the written letter here. It's his
[58:22] character. That's who he is.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And so when we look at this, look how
[58:27] John would say, "We ought also to love
[58:29] one another. No man hath seen God at any
[58:32] time. If we love one another, God
[58:35] dwelleth in us, and his love is
[58:38] perfected, or it comes to its completion
[58:41] in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in
[58:44] him, and he in us, because he hath given
[58:47] us of his spirit, and we have seen and
[58:51] do testify, that the father sent the son
[58:54] to be the savior of the world. Whosoever
[58:57] shall confess that Jesus is the son of
[59:00] God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. In verse 16, "And we
[59:08] have known and believed the love that
[59:11] God hath to us. God is love." Well, how
[59:14] do I know that I've believed that? How
[59:15] do I know? It's changed your life.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; See it? The love of God, when God's love
[59:22] has been projected, it must come into
[59:24] that place of perfection in our life. In
[59:27] other words, to where like the prophet
[59:28] says, that fel love that we have for
[59:31] that of our wife, we have, you know,
[59:33] it's a love that that's also a very
[59:35] conditional love. It's a love that also
[59:37] has its likes and everything else like
[59:39] that. But unless that felio love can
[59:42] actually come to a place that it's
[59:44] overrode by the agape love, then felio
[59:47] love, we can never know God in the right
[59:50] way. In other words, it always still
[59:53] becomes something to where you know that
[59:55] you you you have a like towards God, yet
[59:58] it's called a love. And there's certain
[1:00:00] attributes. There's certain parts. I
[1:00:01] mean, it's just like many within the
[1:00:03] church world today. They want certain
[1:00:05] attributes of God, but they really don't
[1:00:07] want him. They want certain things that
[1:00:09] he will do, certain parts of that who he
[1:00:11] is. They want all of those things, but
[1:00:14] they don't want him because if he came
[1:00:16] in, he would change how they live. He
[1:00:18] would change their life. As a matter of
[1:00:20] fact, they would live a real faith life
[1:00:23] that would match the word of God. Their
[1:00:25] lives would be an amen to the word of
[1:00:27] God. But they don't want him. They want
[1:00:29] his blessings and not him. But notice
[1:00:33] God's desire. This is not what he went
[1:00:35] to Calvary for was just to dispense or
[1:00:38] just to, you know, shower us with
[1:00:40] blessings here within the outer realms,
[1:00:43] but to actually bring to us, as we read,
[1:00:46] spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[1:00:48] When our souls have been birthed and
[1:00:51] lifted into that realm of heavenlies,
[1:00:54] that's where there's real spiritual
[1:00:56] blessings. That's where God can really
[1:00:59] be begin to move and move through our
[1:01:00] lives as channels. But notice the love
[1:01:03] that God hath to us, God is love. And he
[1:01:07] that dwelleth in love. Now this is this
[1:01:10] is what's peculiar. You'll find this
[1:01:12] over and over with dwelleth. This is not
[1:01:14] something that's in and out.
[1:01:18] In and out. That was the difference when
[1:01:21] the Holy Ghost came. What what set the
[1:01:24] whole difference is the Bible where John
[1:01:26] the Baptist was was it was declared to
[1:01:29] him on whom thou see the spirit descend
[1:01:32] and remain.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; So it's not just something that would
[1:01:37] come and move away and then something
[1:01:39] that would come and something that would
[1:01:41] drop away. No, it it's got to be deeper
[1:01:43] than that. You know, there's those
[1:01:45] things of how that Satan would just like
[1:01:47] to be able to point to those types of
[1:01:49] things. But there is no absolutely
[1:01:52] greater resolve than that our hearts
[1:01:55] would be so in tune with God's word. And
[1:01:58] such a desire within that that Lord, I
[1:02:01] want to please you above everything
[1:02:03] else.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; My desire is to the Lord and the Lord
[1:02:07] alone. So, you know, when we look at all
[1:02:09] of this that just to dwell in love,
[1:02:11] that's this is where we want our
[1:02:13] address. If somebody's going to send you
[1:02:14] a package, we don't we don't want to be
[1:02:16] well, I don't know where they're going
[1:02:18] to be at. We want to be known to that
[1:02:20] this is where we're dwelling in the love
[1:02:22] of God. Brother Samuel, what are you
[1:02:23] saying? I'm saying being a real Holy
[1:02:25] Ghostfilled Christian,
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Because outside of that, we can't dwell
[1:02:30] in the love of God. So he notice he that
[1:02:34] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[1:02:40] in him.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:02:45] may have boldness or have a confidence
[1:02:48] in the day of judgment because as he is
[1:02:51] so are we in this world. And there is no
[1:02:54] fear in love. But perfect love casteth
[1:02:58] out fear, because fear hath torment. He
[1:03:03] that fearth is not made perfect in love.
[1:03:07] We love him because he first loved us.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Now to think of within that just within
[1:03:15] that scripture, this is why blue bra
[1:03:17] would say when divine love is in your
[1:03:19] heart, there's a difference in your life
[1:03:23] and everybody
[1:03:25] knows it.
[1:03:27] See, it isn't something we have to tell.
[1:03:29] Everybody knows it.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; And it's not just in good days, it's in
[1:03:34] bad days. It's not just when
[1:03:36] everything's on the mountaintop. It
[1:03:37] really shows in the valley.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Everybody knows it. Why? Because it's
[1:03:43] not you trying to live that. Remember
[1:03:45] the testimony that Brother Brandham
[1:03:47] talked about that bubble brook? I drank
[1:03:49] from that bubble brook and I took a
[1:03:50] bottle down there and filled it up. And
[1:03:52] you know where brother Brandham referred
[1:03:53] to that very thing? He asked, "Who is it
[1:03:56] that's making you bubble like that? Is
[1:03:58] it because the deer come and drink from
[1:04:00] you? Is it because I come and drink from
[1:04:02] you?" And brother Ram said, "If that
[1:04:04] bubbling brook had a voice, he said it
[1:04:07] would be able to say, it's not you. It's
[1:04:09] not the deer. There is a force that is
[1:04:13] behind me." And that's exactly what the
[1:04:16] Holy Spirit is. The love of God when it
[1:04:19] sets down in our heart, it is a force
[1:04:22] behind us. It is that which emanates
[1:04:25] from the inside. Not something that
[1:04:27] we're looking and trying to somehow put
[1:04:29] on and and you know on the outside, but
[1:04:32] it is actually a force on the inside
[1:04:36] that we are constantly desiring to sink
[1:04:39] into and be enveloped by his presence.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And everybody knows it. You live like a
[1:04:46] Christian, act like a Christian, walk
[1:04:49] like a Christian, and your whole system
[1:04:52] is timed to God's Bible.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I know in this this day and age we
[1:04:57] live, all the different watches and
[1:04:59] things, we don't even have to set our
[1:05:01] phones on daylight savings time, you
[1:05:03] know, thank God, you know, and some of
[1:05:05] those things, we don't have to change
[1:05:06] our clocks. And I mean, you know,
[1:05:08] there's there's certain things where
[1:05:09] brother Brandon will refer to this over
[1:05:11] and over is when you had watches and he
[1:05:13] would talk about how that they have, you
[1:05:15] know, each of those synchronizations
[1:05:17] within them where you'd have to wind
[1:05:18] them up and you'd have to set them. I
[1:05:20] remember my dad my dad had certain
[1:05:22] watches and I remember as a little boy
[1:05:23] I'd get into them sometimes and I'd look
[1:05:25] at them and they were watches you know
[1:05:26] we handed down some watches he bought
[1:05:28] and you'd have to wind those things up
[1:05:30] and you'd have to get things
[1:05:31] synchronized so that everything in it
[1:05:34] would actually tell the right time. Now
[1:05:37] I want you to think of it in every part
[1:05:39] of our life your life as an individual
[1:05:41] then our life as a body even as a body
[1:05:44] and then as a body around the world. you
[1:05:46] know when we look at it within our life
[1:05:48] there's all of those parts about our
[1:05:50] life that the Holy Spirit will come down
[1:05:53] and it's not just something that's you
[1:05:54] know automated and it's just automatic
[1:05:57] but it is constantly within that place
[1:06:00] the spirit of God will minister to our
[1:06:02] lives and we can recognize Lord I need a
[1:06:04] tuneup Lord I I I I need this in my area
[1:06:07] and you know the only time that we find
[1:06:09] that we don't find that when we're on
[1:06:11] the mountain top we don't find it when
[1:06:12] everything's going just right when those
[1:06:14] things show up in that way is a a lot of
[1:06:16] times where God has allowed situations
[1:06:19] that bring us to a place to realize that
[1:06:22] we need more of him. And within that,
[1:06:25] God will allow that. Wouldn't it be nice
[1:06:26] if everybody everybody just minded their
[1:06:28] own business and everybody just did what
[1:06:30] was right and everybody according to
[1:06:31] what we thought. That's right.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Man, the world be a
[1:06:35] better place. We could hold hands, sing
[1:06:36] kumbaya and everything else, give the
[1:06:38] peace sign and everything. That that is
[1:06:40] that that's nonsense. That's not what
[1:06:43] that's not what Jesus said he'd come to
[1:06:45] do. He says, "I've not come to bring
[1:06:46] peace. I've come to bring a sword." And
[1:06:49] it wasn't that he came to stir up
[1:06:50] trouble within families and within
[1:06:52] homes. It's what that whole thing of the
[1:06:54] sword is to where the word would so come
[1:06:57] to such a place in our life to where
[1:07:00] even when it come to family, even when
[1:07:02] it comes down to our own lives, we will
[1:07:05] side with the word more than we'll side
[1:07:08] with our feelings. Let me tell you the
[1:07:11] victory of Calvary is what that is what
[1:07:14] it produces and is capable of producing
[1:07:17] in our life to where that it will
[1:07:19] actually equip us as sons and daughters
[1:07:21] of God to override our own thoughts and
[1:07:24] our own feelings and bring it in
[1:07:27] subjection to the word. No way possible
[1:07:29] without the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this this the whole reality of
[1:07:36] when you know that confidence that God
[1:07:39] would bring into our life remember as
[1:07:41] the prophet would relay this in
[1:07:43] regarding to faith because really to to
[1:07:46] have faith love produces faith and yet
[1:07:49] what's a what's a marvel is how that
[1:07:50] Paul would take this in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:07:54] and would say though I have faith to
[1:07:56] move mountains. Remember the gift of
[1:07:58] healing is one who has faith and they
[1:08:02] absolutely would be able to go into the
[1:08:04] word many times and be able to build
[1:08:07] people's faith. And yet even with a gift
[1:08:10] of healing, a gift of faith, gift of
[1:08:12] miracles, any of the nine spiritual
[1:08:14] gifts and yet very individual could
[1:08:17] absolutely be wrong down in their soul.
[1:08:21] And yet the spirit of God would
[1:08:23] absolutely be using and working through.
[1:08:26] That's one of the great mysteries in
[1:08:28] this end time that God would display in
[1:08:30] Matthew 24. There will be false Christ
[1:08:34] or false anointed ones. And how many
[1:08:37] times today, remember brother would talk
[1:08:38] about when that when that angel when
[1:08:40] Satan came to Martin and he came, you
[1:08:42] know, dressed in that way that he did,
[1:08:44] brother Brand said, wouldn't that have
[1:08:46] made many of Pentecostals fall down
[1:08:47] right there? But you see, Martin stood
[1:08:50] with the word. And no doubt, let me tell
[1:08:52] you, you're talking about a great
[1:08:54] presence. No doubt he had a great
[1:08:56] presence, great feeling that went around
[1:08:58] that. But notice, Martin stayed with the
[1:09:01] word greater and more than this presence
[1:09:04] or anointing or everything that he felt
[1:09:06] around him. He stood with the word. And
[1:09:08] you know what? When he stood with the
[1:09:09] word, it exposed that devil. Yeah.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; How much more in our own lives? Listen,
[1:09:14] we've all been there of things that you
[1:09:16] feel is right, things that we think is
[1:09:18] right. But oh, God, where is our
[1:09:21] strength? Brother said, "My strength has
[1:09:23] been to wait on God and just let it be
[1:09:27] in his presence." Let me tell you, if it
[1:09:29] come from God, the presence of God will
[1:09:32] never dissolve it. But if it comes from
[1:09:34] if it comes from God or it doesn't, I'll
[1:09:36] tell you, it will be dissipated in the
[1:09:39] presence of God. Oh, what a privilege it
[1:09:42] is to know that we can bring everything
[1:09:44] by the love of God into God's presence,
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; man. So to think think, you know, to
[1:09:51] think about this. This is what Paul was
[1:09:53] bringing to this Corinthian church. Yes,
[1:09:56] it was correction when dealing with
[1:09:58] things with on gifts and all that
[1:09:59] because when they came together, one had
[1:10:02] a psalm, one had a this, one had a this,
[1:10:04] one had a that. And Paul wasn't doing
[1:10:06] away with their enthusiasm, but he was
[1:10:08] just trying to help them to see, wait a
[1:10:10] minute here. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[1:10:11] wait. You got to think about the whole
[1:10:12] body. Don't just think about yourself.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Don't just think about you. Think about
[1:10:17] the body. Think beyond yourself. Listen
[1:10:20] friends, that's one of the things that
[1:10:21] the Holy Spirit, one of the greatest
[1:10:23] achievements in our life is to begin the
[1:10:26] overthrow of selfishness in our own
[1:10:28] life. our first birth which is there so
[1:10:31] tied to selfishness and the spirit of
[1:10:34] God continues to work in our life after
[1:10:37] he's overthrown that to continue to
[1:10:39] break every single hold in our lives.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And Paul Paul would write of this to
[1:10:48] encourage the believers to don't rest
[1:10:52] don't rest in gifts. He didn't do away
[1:10:55] with it but he said don't rest in that.
[1:10:56] Don't let that be the marriage. Do not
[1:10:58] let that be your vindication.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Because it is not a vindication.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Now, I know we can go in
[1:11:07] the scriptures when it says, well, you
[1:11:09] know, if there's an unbeliever that
[1:11:10] walks in and prophecy is read when it's
[1:11:12] read and declared and then they'll say
[1:11:14] that God is with you. That's true. But
[1:11:16] remember, keep it right in with the
[1:11:18] scriptures and the message of the hour.
[1:11:20] The prophet said that is no sign or
[1:11:22] evidence of a spiritfilled individual.
[1:11:26] It is evidence that the spirit has used
[1:11:28] or moved upon that person, but it is no
[1:11:31] evidence of a spiritborn person.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul wasn't trying to take anything
[1:11:37] away, but as a real a real the first
[1:11:40] messenger, he wanted their confidence
[1:11:42] and their faith to not be based upon of
[1:11:46] all of these things. This had to be done
[1:11:47] and this had to be done. He wanted their
[1:11:49] whole the whole basis uh uh uh uh in
[1:11:52] their life to be placed in the
[1:11:54] confidence of what God was able to
[1:11:58] achieve through Christ and that
[1:12:00] revelation imparted to their life. Look
[1:12:02] how brother Ram would say it. He said to
[1:12:04] think of how that that God came down in
[1:12:06] the muck of what you were and sought you
[1:12:09] out and brought you out. That ought to
[1:12:12] create a perfect love. Look what you was
[1:12:15] and look what you are. Amen.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; You see this? What? What did that? He
[1:12:19] says, "What did that?" Somebody that
[1:12:22] loves you.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Can't you have faith in what he's
[1:12:26] promised you? Real genuine love will
[1:12:30] create a confidence
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; in his word. He caught me and he loved
[1:12:35] me when I was unlovable. He loved you
[1:12:37] when you were unlovable and he changed
[1:12:39] you. He said if I when I was an alien
[1:12:42] from him, he so loved me till he stooped
[1:12:44] down to get me and picked me up. That
[1:12:46] gives me confidence that he wants to use
[1:12:50] me. He's got a purpose in doing it. He's
[1:12:52] seen something in me. He's seen
[1:12:54] something in you. He says, "Oh, take
[1:12:57] your place in God's economy." That's
[1:12:59] what his love is to you. Now, won't your
[1:13:02] love reach right back to him? There's a
[1:13:05] love affair that no matter what the
[1:13:08] situation is, it circumstances
[1:13:12] is governed by this love.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. that creates faith.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; God loves you.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; You love God and you love one another.
[1:13:22] And that brings faith.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Fear. God never intended that our lives
[1:13:30] would be ruled by fear.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, many of the things
[1:13:35] that God will still continue to break
[1:13:38] has to work and break away in our lives.
[1:13:40] I'm glad that he keeps on working in our
[1:13:42] lives to break us away from slavish
[1:13:45] mentalities that if I do this or if I
[1:13:48] don't do this, if I I have to do but
[1:13:50] he's bring you know what you know what
[1:13:51] he breaks it all back down to he brings
[1:13:53] he's breaking it all back down to is to
[1:13:56] come back to that of what he has done
[1:13:59] for you and he has changed your life and
[1:14:02] to bring you to a place of resting in
[1:14:05] what reality that he's already done in
[1:14:08] your life. Right? You say, "Brother
[1:14:10] Samuel, what happens if you wouldn't be
[1:14:12] able to preach?"
[1:14:14] If I'm resting in preaching as a
[1:14:17] vindication, we're all in trouble.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; we're all in a mess of trouble.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not resting in preaching,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not resting in any other gift. I'm
[1:14:26] not resting in the different miracles
[1:14:28] that I've witnessed God do. I'm not
[1:14:30] resting in that. I thank God for all of
[1:14:32] that. But that is no sign of a
[1:14:35] vindication. It is a vindication that
[1:14:37] God's presence is near and God will work
[1:14:40] through those things. But what happens
[1:14:41] in it? I think of how brother Bram said
[1:14:43] on debate with tongues. He said, "What
[1:14:45] happens if a person don't even have a
[1:14:46] tongue and can't speak?"
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. They're in trouble when
[1:14:50] it comes to evidence of speaking in
[1:14:52] tongues.
[1:14:54] It's
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; pretty simple, but it's pretty plain,
[1:14:56] isn't it?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; So, you notice that within it, it's not
[1:14:59] a it's not a works affair. It's a love
[1:15:01] affair. You know, God doesn't love you
[1:15:04] anymore if you could string together 10
[1:15:07] wonderful days. I'm not talking about
[1:15:08] compromising, but his love towards you
[1:15:11] has never changed.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Even in our failures, even in our
[1:15:17] weaknesses,
[1:15:19] that's why Paul would speak to the
[1:15:21] Galatian church because the Judaizers
[1:15:23] came in there and wanted to bring them
[1:15:25] back to under the law and doing this and
[1:15:28] doing that. And Paul said, "I'm afraid
[1:15:30] of you." Why are you turning down the
[1:15:33] grace that has already produced all of
[1:15:36] these miracles and changed your life and
[1:15:38] going back to doing all these things and
[1:15:41] keeping this and keeping that and
[1:15:43] keeping that but it was coming back to
[1:15:45] the rest
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; of what God has done in your life.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; You see that brings a rest. When that is
[1:15:51] there in the life, God begins to move
[1:15:55] within that and a person is satisfied.
[1:15:57] You see that? That rest of God in your
[1:15:59] life, it actually works to affect every
[1:16:03] area of your life.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; The rest of God will affect your life as
[1:16:07] a husband, as a wife, as a father, as a
[1:16:12] mother. It brings stability into your
[1:16:15] life. And you might think, well, that
[1:16:16] that don't mean anything. No, it does.
[1:16:18] Because God intended from that rest you
[1:16:21] and the economy of God. Brother Bram
[1:16:23] says there is mothers in the economy of
[1:16:25] God. there's preachers in the economy of
[1:16:27] God. He said, "God's got mechanics." And
[1:16:29] he goes through and lists it all. So
[1:16:31] just because your your your your
[1:16:33] occupation or something or vocation was
[1:16:36] not read in that opening chapter, you
[1:16:38] are a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:16:41] in particular. God has said it in his
[1:16:45] economy. And so with that being in his
[1:16:48] economy and how that God has so placed
[1:16:50] those things, there is an emphasis that
[1:16:53] God himself through his word just as he
[1:16:56] did through Paul place upon these
[1:16:59] things. Now I want you to think of this
[1:17:00] because an emphasis itself is special
[1:17:03] importance, value or prominence that's
[1:17:06] given to something.
[1:17:12] This message, it came with the same
[1:17:14] emphasis as Paul.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; We agree with that
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; where Paul said, "Though we are an
[1:17:20] angel."
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Right? Preach any other gospel, let him
[1:17:26] be accursed. Any other man preach any
[1:17:28] other gospel, let him be accursed. Now I
[1:17:31] want you there's many many quotes that
[1:17:32] we could read on it but let's just let's
[1:17:34] just look at this because within this of
[1:17:36] how that brother Brandon will will speak
[1:17:38] of this with the same emphasis that Paul
[1:17:40] would place on this more excellent way
[1:17:43] and begin to lay all these things out in
[1:17:46] 1 Corinthians 13 says if the Lord Jesus
[1:17:49] should stand on the platform tonight and
[1:17:51] he would look me in the face and say I'm
[1:17:54] going to give you your choice you can be
[1:17:56] a great person a great minister I'll
[1:17:59] give you a gift of preaching the gospel
[1:18:01] or I'll give you the gift of teaching
[1:18:03] the word or I'll give you the gift of
[1:18:04] divine healing. I'll give you the gift
[1:18:06] of prophecy or I'll make you a prophet
[1:18:08] or any of the fine gifts of faith.
[1:18:13] Brother Ram says, "Any of the gifts
[1:18:14] that's in the Bible, I'll give them
[1:18:17] everyone to you, but then I will
[1:18:20] withhold love from you. Or either I'll
[1:18:23] give you love and withhold the gift from
[1:18:25] you." I'd say, 'Lord, take all the gifts
[1:18:29] and let me have the love. For no matter
[1:18:32] how many gifts we got, they will never
[1:18:35] do us any good except the love of God is
[1:18:39] the motive behind the gift. We must have
[1:18:44] love.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Now, when brother Brandham is coming
[1:18:47] through this once again, he's the same
[1:18:50] emphasis as Paul. He is not putting
[1:18:52] gifts away. He is not saying that we
[1:18:55] don't need gifts. Contrary to anything
[1:18:57] of well we're beyond the gifts. We're
[1:18:59] not beyond the gifts. God has not only
[1:19:02] restored them there in the Isuza street
[1:19:04] ma Zuza street time but under the
[1:19:07] anointing of Malachi 4 they have been
[1:19:09] put back into their proper position
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; in the church. not in storage, but like
[1:19:16] as I've said over and over, when my wife
[1:19:19] and I got married, she had before we got
[1:19:22] married on the bridal bridal shower,
[1:19:24] when you know, just looking in her room
[1:19:26] from that from that bridal shower, man,
[1:19:28] she had the boxes of the pots and pans
[1:19:30] and silverware and there was all sorts
[1:19:32] of stuff to make house and that was just
[1:19:35] all along one wall right there in her
[1:19:37] bedroom. But you know what? after we got
[1:19:39] married, after the ceremony and we
[1:19:42] entered into our home and when we got in
[1:19:45] there, those within the boxes came open.
[1:19:49] Now, she did not take a stockp and every
[1:19:51] time somebody came over and say, "Look
[1:19:53] at my stockp. Look at this stockp. Isn't
[1:19:55] this wonderful? Can you see yourself in
[1:19:57] this?" She never did that. She found a
[1:19:59] place to put it
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; cuz you know what? There was going to be
[1:20:03] times we needed to to boil things in.
[1:20:06] There was things even within the
[1:20:07] saucepan and all that. So they didn't go
[1:20:09] into storage. We're we're not beyond
[1:20:12] those things. But they have their
[1:20:14] position. You see where the spirit of
[1:20:16] God has brought us into that place is to
[1:20:18] realize that the spirituality of a
[1:20:21] church and of a meeting does not depend
[1:20:24] on whether or not in that service we
[1:20:27] have the gifts operating or not. The
[1:20:30] spirituality even of a service does not
[1:20:33] even is not even determined with even
[1:20:35] what type of a service it was or how the
[1:20:38] man was a preaching. That does not
[1:20:40] interpret that does not mean that
[1:20:42] whatsoever. But we have learned to be
[1:20:44] able to recognize that God is Jehovah
[1:20:47] Gyra. And just as much as he put the ram
[1:20:50] on the mountain, the squirrels there in
[1:20:52] the woods and gave had rights the boys
[1:20:55] there that God is a God who provides
[1:20:58] when there is need for it.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; So we've learned that that it's not
[1:21:03] anything we have to push ourselves into
[1:21:05] or we have to work ourselves into it,
[1:21:07] but be available as the prophet said,
[1:21:10] being a prayed up church. All right.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Now, watch. Handwriting on a wall. If I
[1:21:18] had every gift in the Bible and could
[1:21:21] exchange it for love, I'd never wink an
[1:21:26] eye.
[1:21:27] I'd take it right now. Let me feel the
[1:21:31] blessings of the Lord and his divine
[1:21:33] love into my heart that's shed abroad by
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost. And I'll exchange any
[1:21:38] gift in the Bible for that. You know
[1:21:41] what that means? If you exchange
[1:21:44] a gift or whatever for the love of God,
[1:21:46] that means that what you have
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; is of lesser value
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; than what's being offered.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; If a gift is there and the love of God
[1:21:56] is not behind it to motivate it, it
[1:21:58] doesn't have the same value.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have this is the value within
[1:22:04] it that it needs to be. Notice blue ram
[1:22:06] goes on to say, "I'd exchange a domain
[1:22:09] if I was a king and sitting on a throne
[1:22:12] and the world was my domain. I'd give
[1:22:14] every penny of it and forfeit a million
[1:22:17] years on this life in this world here as
[1:22:20] to have the love of Jesus Christ that
[1:22:22] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:22:25] Ghost. There's nothing that can compare
[1:22:29] to it." Right. Right. Now,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; this is just a selection of multitudes
[1:22:32] of quotes where the prophet would say
[1:22:35] this over and over with the same
[1:22:37] emphasis. Once again, he's not taking
[1:22:40] away from the gifts. Not even leading us
[1:22:44] a as a people to say, "Well, the gifts
[1:22:46] don't matter." What he's leading us to a
[1:22:48] place to say is is that whether or not
[1:22:51] that if there is an opportunity, the
[1:22:54] greatest thing that you are to seek
[1:22:56] after is the love of God
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; in your soul.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, there won't be no
[1:23:01] rapture without the love of God.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says it'll be perfect
[1:23:06] love. That that that's what we'll enter
[1:23:08] there. Is that right? It'll have it'll
[1:23:10] take nothing less than the love of God
[1:23:13] dwelling supremely in our lives. Now,
[1:23:16] think of this. What what charity itself,
[1:23:20] what charity does and what it is. I know
[1:23:22] we're familiar with these verses, but
[1:23:24] what it does, this is what it will do
[1:23:27] and also what it is. Now, I'm going to
[1:23:30] read this out of the amplified. That
[1:23:31] way, I don't have to go through and
[1:23:32] define words, but I'm going to read it
[1:23:34] out of the amplified. If you want to
[1:23:35] follow along in your Bible, that's fine.
[1:23:37] But 1 Corinthians 13 and verse 4, love
[1:23:41] endures long.
[1:23:45] Now this is I know this is simple but
[1:23:47] what does this does? Is it the person
[1:23:50] that's doing this? No,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; you can't.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; It'll give out.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Even in our own strength, it'll give
[1:23:58] out.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; You can listen listen. You can try to
[1:24:02] endure even things that can be wrong is
[1:24:05] sitting right there in front of you and
[1:24:07] things may be on the job and so forth
[1:24:09] and you can think I'm enduring. I'm
[1:24:10] enduring. If it's not by the love of
[1:24:12] God, look out. there's going to be a
[1:24:14] blowup.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Right. There's things there's approaches
[1:24:19] to things as well. Sometimes there's
[1:24:20] things that we suffer with. There's
[1:24:22] sometimes there's things that we put up
[1:24:24] with and but we cannot do that of of our
[1:24:26] own strength because eventually there'll
[1:24:28] be a blowup. But there's got to be a
[1:24:30] place of release and a place and a
[1:24:34] source of refreshment in our life. And
[1:24:38] it must be God's love. Love endures long
[1:24:42] and is patient and kind.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Love is never envious nor boils over
[1:24:49] with jealousy. It's not boastful or vain
[1:24:53] glorious. It does not display itself
[1:24:58] hottily.
[1:25:00] This is love does not do this.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:05] could a person do that? Absolutely. But
[1:25:08] here's the thing. If the love of God's
[1:25:10] on the inside, you can't get by with it
[1:25:14] because the love of God, the Holy
[1:25:15] Spirit, the word of God will convict
[1:25:18] you.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; He's he convicts, man. There's there's
[1:25:22] the judgment seat of Christ has moved to
[1:25:24] the inside. It does not display itself
[1:25:26] indifferent. Let me just say this to
[1:25:28] you. You've heard me repeat this over
[1:25:29] and over. You've heard in the testimony
[1:25:31] of Brother Billy Paul and many others
[1:25:32] that said it. And I just just thinking
[1:25:34] about this once again today that when
[1:25:36] they asked brother Billy Paul who saw so
[1:25:38] many phenomenal miracles, I wonder if it
[1:25:41] had been you or I that they had asked
[1:25:43] and we had been standing there. I trust
[1:25:46] that we would have had the same same
[1:25:49] exact statement that brother Billy Paul
[1:25:50] had when they asked him what's the
[1:25:52] greatest miracle you ever seen in your
[1:25:55] daddy's ministry.
[1:25:58] He said the greatest miracle
[1:26:01] is you couldn't tell his friends from
[1:26:05] his enemies.
[1:26:08] I'm sure we could have oh my this one on
[1:26:10] the platform and that there was how many
[1:26:11] I mean there's so many I mean it didn't
[1:26:14] matter there was so many great miracles
[1:26:16] and things but to think because look
[1:26:19] within that this is where you and I have
[1:26:21] confidence if we we're looking at the
[1:26:24] same quality of life cuz that was not
[1:26:26] brother Brandham's DNA that did that was
[1:26:29] the Holy Spirit that produced that in
[1:26:32] his life and don't think for a moment
[1:26:36] that it did not have to override his own
[1:26:38] humanity.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Let me remind you, he said regarding
[1:26:42] those hornets, he said, "I had a can of
[1:26:44] hornet spray in the building."
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; He already used that before. Let me
[1:26:50] remind you where he said, "I would not
[1:26:51] have walked through that pasture if I'd
[1:26:54] had known that bull was there." Let me
[1:26:56] also remind you that he said he sized up
[1:27:00] that maniac when he stood there on the
[1:27:02] platform.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, why are you
[1:27:05] saying that? I'm showing that there's
[1:27:07] something greater than humanity. Our
[1:27:10] humanity. There must be something on the
[1:27:13] inside that is so far greater and able
[1:27:16] to override our humanity. Friends,
[1:27:19] that's what we must have with all of our
[1:27:22] hearts.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; God, I want more. I want more of that. I
[1:27:25] want him to take over more of me that it
[1:27:28] overrides this humanity.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Look at this.
[1:27:33] It is not conceited. It's not arrogant,
[1:27:38] inflated with pride.
[1:27:40] It's not rude, unmannerly, and does not
[1:27:44] act unbecomingly.
[1:27:46] Love, God's love in us does not insist,
[1:27:52] oh Lord, on its own rights or its own
[1:27:57] way. It's kind of like the marbles.
[1:28:00] Always heard that story. If you don't
[1:28:02] play marbles my way, I'm taking mine and
[1:28:04] leaving.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Love of God won't do that.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Or the same you're
[1:28:10] putting it up. Listen, if if if the love
[1:28:13] of God can't produce this, why are we
[1:28:15] here for?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; If then there's got to be a confidence
[1:28:18] of a reality that God is able to produce
[1:28:21] this within our life, that there's
[1:28:23] something deeper and bigger than self.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I'm so glad for that
[1:28:32] reality. Aren't you?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Love, God's love, does not insist on its
[1:28:36] own rights or its own way. For it's not
[1:28:38] selfseeking.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; It's not touchy. Lord have mercy. Or
[1:28:43] fretful or resentful. It takes no
[1:28:47] account of the evil done to it. In other
[1:28:50] words, it pays no attention to a
[1:28:52] suffered wrong.
[1:28:54] Brother Samuel, how in the world can
[1:28:56] that be? By the love of God.
[1:29:00] You see this is where our confidence it
[1:29:02] must be in him that he is in you and you
[1:29:06] are in him and then this is where you
[1:29:08] rest. This is your place of resource.
[1:29:10] It's not to go out on the Facebook and
[1:29:13] get around with family and everything
[1:29:14] else and oh Mike, can you believe this
[1:29:16] and can believe this? Let me ask you
[1:29:18] something. The last time you got with
[1:29:19] your family and ran your b your boss
[1:29:22] down, how what what kind of atmosphere
[1:29:24] did that create in the home?
[1:29:27] I'm asking you, what kind of atmosphere?
[1:29:29] What kind of atmosphere did it create
[1:29:30] around your life?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; But there's an atmosphere that could
[1:29:34] gets created by the words that we speak,
[1:29:37] the things that we think upon. But if we
[1:29:39] can, you say, "Brother Samuel, we're
[1:29:40] still in humanity." I get it. We are in
[1:29:42] humanity, but God is leading us to a
[1:29:45] place to be able to see there's
[1:29:47] something so much greater and deeper,
[1:29:49] and we have a resource to be able to tap
[1:29:52] into. And if you don't have that
[1:29:54] resource in your soul, it is available.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is not this is not five
[1:30:03] steps. Don't don't take it like that.
[1:30:05] This is not five steps to be a better
[1:30:07] you. You know you know to be you know a
[1:30:09] lovely grump. And that's not what this
[1:30:11] is. Notice in verse six, it does not
[1:30:15] rejoice
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; at injustice and unrighteousness.
[1:30:20] I always knew.
[1:30:22] I always knew. I love that second that
[1:30:24] that you know rear view mirror discern.
[1:30:26] I always knew.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But rejoices
[1:30:32] when right and truth prevail.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Verse seven. Love
[1:30:41] bears up under anything and everything
[1:30:45] that comes and is ever ready to believe
[1:30:48] the best of every person.
[1:30:53] You know how we're able to give people
[1:30:54] passes?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Because you've you've received the pass.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Used to be a thing that I would, you
[1:31:01] know, give out in school. They call
[1:31:02] homework passes. Most of y'all probably
[1:31:04] remember you had a teacher that did
[1:31:05] that. They'd cut them things up and you
[1:31:08] know, you you try to save it and
[1:31:09] sometimes they would have those certain
[1:31:10] assignments. Man, you wanted to you were
[1:31:12] saving that homework pass and they let
[1:31:14] you know that that won't work on this
[1:31:16] assignment.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; You you you were hoping that it would
[1:31:18] work. you know that that that pass that
[1:31:20] you would have, you know, it might be a
[1:31:22] piece of paper or they would block out
[1:31:23] whatever missing assignment that would
[1:31:25] take place. But, you know, let me just
[1:31:27] say this to you. The only way that we're
[1:31:29] actually able to be able to hand out
[1:31:31] passes to people is to have received the
[1:31:34] pass ourselves.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; And then, listen to me now where I'm
[1:31:38] going. And then to stay in the presence
[1:31:42] of him. Right.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And as the more that we stay in his
[1:31:46] presence, the more passes you have in
[1:31:49] your pocket.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, we need to give. We have to
[1:31:53] give one another passes. Oh, brother
[1:31:55] Samuel, I know what so and so meant. I
[1:31:58] know. Well, let me just say it like
[1:32:00] this. What if they did mean that?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; What if they did? Is that justification
[1:32:05] for our behavior or our action? No,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; not at all.
[1:32:11] How is quiet?
[1:32:14] Glory be to God. And sometimes if we're
[1:32:17] not careful, we're trying to justify.
[1:32:19] Yes, we've got rights, but remember as a
[1:32:21] lamb, we want to forfeit our rights.
[1:32:23] See, that that takes listen, that's
[1:32:25] where it takes staying in in in
[1:32:26] fellowship with God. And verse as we
[1:32:29] stay in fellowship with God, that's
[1:32:31] where our hearts are tender. That's
[1:32:33] where our hearts and we're able to give
[1:32:35] a pass and, you know, to give the
[1:32:37] benefit of the doubt upon different
[1:32:38] things. I mean, you know, there's
[1:32:40] there's many examples that not only from
[1:32:42] here in the assembly, but from other
[1:32:43] places that you think that as a pastor,
[1:32:45] you think even as a minister, you think
[1:32:48] there's not been things where you don't
[1:32:49] have to give passes. I'm not saying this
[1:32:51] to put my pat myself on the back. I'm
[1:32:53] trying to tell you that there's got to
[1:32:55] be something deeper that has to be able
[1:32:57] to give somebody a pass. Even when you
[1:33:00] can see the indifference, even when you
[1:33:02] can see how things have been happening
[1:33:05] and what's been done and to give that
[1:33:06] pass. Well, maybe there's something
[1:33:08] going on in their life. Maybe there's
[1:33:09] something that, you know, that's
[1:33:11] happened. Maybe there's something that's
[1:33:12] back in there. Oh, brother Samuel,
[1:33:14] you're just you're giving them too much.
[1:33:15] I would rather be guilty of overstating
[1:33:19] and giving somebody a a chance and the
[1:33:22] benefit of the doubt and come to find
[1:33:24] out I was wrong than taking away that.
[1:33:29] Just as I told a minister one time, good
[1:33:32] friend, a brother called me up and when
[1:33:35] things were taking place with one
[1:33:36] minister and he was pulling away, he
[1:33:38] said, I said, "Somebody needs to expose
[1:33:40] that thing." I said, "Brother," I said,
[1:33:42] "Listen," I said, "you go to start, you
[1:33:45] go to start hammering out and calling
[1:33:46] out words on people." I said, "I'll tell
[1:33:48] you what'll happen. They'll circle the
[1:33:49] the wagon train around and those people
[1:33:51] will stay under that bondage a whole lot
[1:33:53] longer. But let God work it all out. Let
[1:33:56] God take care of it because these very
[1:33:58] things are coming to manifestation as
[1:34:00] they are. And even in other situations
[1:34:02] at times where you can give the benefit
[1:34:04] of the doubt, oh, I I would rather be
[1:34:06] guilty of that. God, if I'm going to be
[1:34:08] guilty of that, let let that be what I'm
[1:34:10] guilty of. Right?
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes even when people have
[1:34:16] had so-called discernments, they've
[1:34:18] never come around and apologized
[1:34:20] or repented
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; of the things that somehow that they
[1:34:24] have. Oh, this is what was and this is
[1:34:26] how things are and this is how things
[1:34:27] are.
[1:34:30] But you know, even within that, give the
[1:34:32] benefit of the doubt.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; But the love of God, it will bring real
[1:34:37] results. How many say amen to that?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; It'll bring real results. Brother Ram
[1:34:41] talks about with the with with that of
[1:34:43] even of uh you know the bull and all
[1:34:45] those things. And he says knowing this
[1:34:47] that how it brings real results. He says
[1:34:50] now at the judgment bar you'll see it
[1:34:52] brought to light. The bull looked at me
[1:34:53] a few minutes turned around walked over
[1:34:55] and laid down and I stood there the
[1:34:57] tears running down my cheeks. I walked
[1:34:59] within five foot of the bull and he
[1:35:01] never even turned his head and looked at
[1:35:03] me. Why? Instead of hating him I loved
[1:35:05] him.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Love will conquer anything.
[1:35:11] That's what conquered my heart. When I
[1:35:14] know that God so loved me that he gave
[1:35:16] his only begotten son that I wouldn't
[1:35:18] have to perish. Knowed that I was born
[1:35:21] in this world a sinner and was
[1:35:22] perishing. And God loved me that he gave
[1:35:24] his son for my life to be redeemed. And
[1:35:27] then I couldn't hate no more. I had to
[1:35:31] love. That's what brings these results
[1:35:34] that you see. It's love. Right.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of that for a
[1:35:39] minute. I couldn't hate no more.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Now to understand hatred is a detest,
[1:35:47] a despising.
[1:35:49] Now filelio times where people get
[1:35:52] confused with agape and filelio. Felio
[1:35:55] with even in that time we should have
[1:35:56] that of brotherly love. But you know God
[1:35:58] does not did not require every one of us
[1:36:01] that we're going to be best buddies.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we run away from
[1:36:05] one another.
[1:36:06] God has so set everything together and
[1:36:09] God has so placed it in such a way to
[1:36:12] where our lives will rub one another.
[1:36:16] You know why? That's to get all the
[1:36:18] greenness out of us.
[1:36:21] As a matter of fact, even when we look
[1:36:22] at it even in our homes and the way God
[1:36:24] would so bring those things together,
[1:36:26] God works in such a complimentary way to
[1:36:29] do things. Such a such a such a
[1:36:31] complimentary way. But notice, brother
[1:36:34] Brandon, I was just really drawn to this
[1:36:35] part. I couldn't hate no more. You think
[1:36:38] the enemy didn't try to arise things
[1:36:40] within him? You think the enemy didn't
[1:36:42] try to come at him with times with
[1:36:44] things, but there was a hidden power.
[1:36:47] Remember, there can be holds. Brother
[1:36:49] Bill Brown would talk about that how
[1:36:51] wrestlers will come in and they'll get a
[1:36:53] hold. But there's got to be a hidden
[1:36:54] power that's able to break that hold.
[1:36:57] Now, notice he goes on to say this when
[1:37:00] we're looking at the very the love of
[1:37:02] God. And he tells us it was the love of
[1:37:04] God that slew that maniac there in
[1:37:08] Oregon. He said it was the love of God
[1:37:10] that slew that of that bull. That's the
[1:37:13] exact words that he uses within it. And
[1:37:15] he goes on, he says, "Men and women,
[1:37:17] hear me today as your brother. Let all
[1:37:19] your little isms and your little
[1:37:21] sensations drop and find the love of
[1:37:24] God. I'd rather have his love than every
[1:37:27] gift he's got in his kingdom. Give me
[1:37:30] his love." That's what the world is
[1:37:32] looking for today is to see a display of
[1:37:36] real love. It'll win souls when you got
[1:37:41] love. They can tell it when you got
[1:37:43] love. He said, "We got too much
[1:37:45] makebelieve love. We got too much love,
[1:37:47] aial love, trying to make it ag. We need
[1:37:51] real godly love." I remember the story
[1:37:55] brother Ram tells over and over about
[1:37:56] Bert. Right.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he was a perfect
[1:37:59] guide, perfect hunter. Remember?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you, Bert knew
[1:38:05] Brother Brandham very well. He knew the
[1:38:08] gift was in Brother Bram's life.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't the gift in Brother Bram's
[1:38:13] life that changed Bert.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, he would tell him
[1:38:21] he was a chicken-hearted preacher.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You know, over and over, Brother Brand
[1:38:25] would relate that. It wasn't a gift that
[1:38:27] got his attention. But when he seen a
[1:38:30] real genuine display
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; of love and it was love of an attribute
[1:38:37] of mother that lay within that deer,
[1:38:39] that dough
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; to where when Bert he would he had that
[1:38:43] call that he made that would make that
[1:38:45] call of a fawn in distress
[1:38:48] that what what had awakened within that
[1:38:51] mother was that attribute that was
[1:38:53] already in her. And brother Ram goes
[1:38:55] through and dramatizes that and and
[1:38:56] tells that. And you know, I watched it
[1:38:58] one time back here in the woods where
[1:39:00] there was a situation. The dough already
[1:39:02] had picked us out. Brother Bobby and I
[1:39:04] were hunting hunting right over here.
[1:39:05] Actually was on Gus's property. We had
[1:39:07] permission there. And they were coming
[1:39:08] right into a clearing. It's very much
[1:39:10] like when he tells right here where that
[1:39:12] mama do, she already picked Brother
[1:39:14] Bobby and she picked myself out in the
[1:39:17] stand already, but her little one was
[1:39:19] right out there walking in the open
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; and she was trying to get it, coax it to
[1:39:25] come back out of that situation. And
[1:39:28] brother Brandon takes that that what
[1:39:29] happened with Bert is Bert, he said,
[1:39:31] "Oh, he put that gun up and he was ready
[1:39:34] to let it go and blow her heart right
[1:39:37] wide open." He said, "But oh, I seen
[1:39:40] that gun beginning to move left to
[1:39:42] right." What was it that got a hold of
[1:39:45] Bert's heart? A real display of love.
[1:39:47] Let me tell you, friends, God's not
[1:39:49] asking you and I that we know so many
[1:39:51] Bible verses, know so many quotes, and
[1:39:54] are you the most gifted person in the
[1:39:56] world, but what the family is looking
[1:39:58] for is a real display of the divine love
[1:40:03] of almighty God. a humility, a love
[1:40:06] because that is supernatural and it is
[1:40:09] greater and able and capable to
[1:40:12] overthrow
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; all things.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; I thank God.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Let me close here.
[1:40:27] Let me share with you here a couple
[1:40:28] quotes.
[1:40:30] Remember,
[1:40:31] Brother Bram's telling us the difference
[1:40:33] between agape love and felio love. And
[1:40:35] he'll he'll take quite a quite a time on
[1:40:38] that because he sees where there's such
[1:40:40] a confusion
[1:40:42] within that.
[1:40:44] And he's talking about how that felio
[1:40:46] love itself of what you would have for
[1:40:48] your wife and you know you'd be jealous
[1:40:50] over and if you catch a man insulting
[1:40:52] her, you'd kill the man for it. That's
[1:40:55] felio love.
[1:40:57] Watch. He says,
[1:40:59] "But agapea love
[1:41:02] would make you
[1:41:04] pray for his lost soul."
[1:41:07] Now, I want you to catch these words in
[1:41:09] here. Agape love would make you. So,
[1:41:14] there could be desires that are going
[1:41:16] the opposite way. You're telling me that
[1:41:19] if a man spoke against your wife that
[1:41:22] you wouldn't get offended?
[1:41:25] We got quiet. You're telling me if they
[1:41:27] spoke against your children, you
[1:41:29] wouldn't get offended.
[1:41:31] Come on. We're human.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; But with agape love down on the inside,
[1:41:39] it will make you
[1:41:42] Why? Because agape love has already
[1:41:45] overrode
[1:41:47] felio love.
[1:41:49] Because see, felio love can only go so
[1:41:51] far. It it can never bring a victorious
[1:41:53] life. That's right. But agape love is
[1:41:55] where that's the seal of the Holy
[1:41:58] Spirit. It's the love of God that's shed
[1:42:00] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.
[1:42:03] And the agape love will make you in
[1:42:05] other words when you could be set in
[1:42:08] your place
[1:42:09] to be able to give them a piece of your
[1:42:12] mind. Oh,
[1:42:15] maybe you won't give them a piece of
[1:42:16] your piece of your mind right there, but
[1:42:18] you'll just maybe the kind that'll steal
[1:42:20] away and stew about it.
[1:42:24] Same thing. Same thing. But agape love
[1:42:29] when that's in your heart, it will
[1:42:32] prevail. It will not permit that
[1:42:36] atmosphere to remain in your life. You
[1:42:40] can never get away from it. It will
[1:42:42] bring conviction to your life and work
[1:42:45] out itself in the humility for which it
[1:42:48] is. Right.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says that's where people don't
[1:42:53] understand. It ain't some kind of an
[1:42:55] effectual worked up mental condition.
[1:43:01] It's an absolutely genuine Holy Spirit
[1:43:03] of God that binds our hearts together in
[1:43:06] Christian fellowship. He says in another
[1:43:09] place, he says, "Agapa love will make
[1:43:12] you get down and pray for that man's
[1:43:15] lost soul.
[1:43:18] That is ag love. That's the kind of love
[1:43:20] the church needs. That's what we all
[1:43:21] need is that kind of love. I'd rather
[1:43:24] have that experience of love than have
[1:43:25] all the gifts that God's got in heaven.
[1:43:27] For you can have every gift that God's
[1:43:29] got and still be lost.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "How many knows that it's love,
[1:43:34] the love of God?" And then he quotes the
[1:43:36] first part of Corinthians 13.
[1:43:40] I don't know about you, but when I look
[1:43:41] at that and the spirit of God just
[1:43:43] bringing my attention into that part of
[1:43:45] it right there, because every time when
[1:43:47] you we come through this, the spirit of
[1:43:49] God pouring over our hearts, listen, if
[1:43:52] somehow or another was setting under the
[1:43:55] ministry of the word, whether it's
[1:43:56] preaching on divine love, divine love is
[1:43:59] still always the theme,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; right? And if there's things within it
[1:44:02] that's not challenging our lives to move
[1:44:05] deeper and deeper in the love of God,
[1:44:07] then we have to be able to stop and say,
[1:44:09] "What is it?" Or how are we actually
[1:44:12] hearing the things that's being said? It
[1:44:16] should be something that's drawing us
[1:44:18] into a place to Lord, I want to love you
[1:44:20] more. You can't love me anymore, but I
[1:44:22] want to love you more. Lord, I I you
[1:44:25] know in my life to realize this is to me
[1:44:27] would have a confidence that if there
[1:44:29] was something that I had if there was an
[1:44:31] offense or a grudge or bitterness or
[1:44:34] something I had in my life that I might
[1:44:36] be able to say I've got a right to have
[1:44:39] this.
[1:44:40] I would have such confidence when
[1:44:43] reading this statement to know that God
[1:44:48] if that's what's in my soul
[1:44:52] it will lead me to that. You see what
[1:44:53] I'm talking about? A confidence to where
[1:44:55] where the enemy is not on your shoulder
[1:44:57] and beating you down. Oh, you've had
[1:44:58] this feeling or this thought or this
[1:45:00] thought came in or this and you
[1:45:02] entertain this and you entertain that.
[1:45:03] But I would receive that confidence that
[1:45:05] your soul would reach out and take a
[1:45:08] hold of that word. What is that? That is
[1:45:10] the love of God from on the inside.
[1:45:13] Agape love will make you
[1:45:18] Oh, I'm so glad about that.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; You know what that comes down to? It
[1:45:22] ain't something you can work up. It
[1:45:23] don't matter what what we could have the
[1:45:25] key of G going. We could have everything
[1:45:26] going. My We could have everybody
[1:45:28] running. We could have all that. You
[1:45:29] can't work this up.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; It's sovereignly given.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; And it must come from within. As a
[1:45:38] matter of fact, Brother Brandham said it
[1:45:39] like this. And when you could trace this
[1:45:41] right back into the message, brother Ram
[1:45:43] talks about that maniac that was there.
[1:45:44] He talks about the bull. Goes through
[1:45:46] all those same examples. And another
[1:45:47] thing that he mentions within it, he
[1:45:49] says, "I chose to think different
[1:45:52] thoughts
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; about that man.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, this is a human being,
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Lord. He's a husband. He's a daddy. He's
[1:46:04] got a family." Now, who who did that for
[1:46:06] him? Did Did the Holy Ghost do that for
[1:46:08] him? Did the spirit of God just come
[1:46:10] right down and and put William Brham
[1:46:12] into a, you know, into a submission
[1:46:14] hold? And
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; but it was that life within. He began to
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; make that choice. God began his presence
[1:46:21] moving and he made that choice. I'm glad
[1:46:23] we that that shows where you and I even
[1:46:26] in our lives. I I hope you're gathering
[1:46:28] it tonight. It shows that that it's not
[1:46:31] something that this love is going to be
[1:46:33] something that generates from out here,
[1:46:35] but it's got to be something down on the
[1:46:37] inside. It's got to be something that
[1:46:39] takes control within our lives.
[1:46:42] something that will override
[1:46:44] our own humanity.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Nothing like the love of God. No wonder
[1:46:50] Jude would write and speak of it in this
[1:46:54] manner and say, "Beloved,
[1:46:58] build yourselves up on your most holy
[1:47:01] faith, praying
[1:47:04] in the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Keep yourselves
[1:47:09] in the love of God. looking for the
[1:47:12] mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto
[1:47:15] eternal life.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; When I read that there
[1:47:19] keep yourselves in the love of God.
[1:47:22] How?
[1:47:24] So it mean you mean there's just things
[1:47:25] within our life that it's now a
[1:47:27] stewardship and a responsibility of
[1:47:30] staying within the love of God even when
[1:47:32] when that brother Samuel has come into
[1:47:34] the depths of my soul. It's where you
[1:47:37] stay close to the strength of your life.
[1:47:40] Right?
[1:47:41] keeping yourselves being very attentive
[1:47:44] within that. You know, brother Random
[1:47:47] talks about the group that was gathered
[1:47:48] out there in Arizona and he talks about
[1:47:52] how that many of them were just kind of,
[1:47:53] you know, riding around their bicycles
[1:47:55] on Sunday and different things and how
[1:47:56] he had been praying that God would start
[1:47:58] a work right there. And he begins to
[1:48:01] make known to him in the message
[1:48:02] ashamed. He said, you know what happens?
[1:48:04] He said, "When you stay out of the
[1:48:05] presence of God," he said, "you're not
[1:48:08] in God's presence like you need to be."
[1:48:11] He said, "You become like these cactus."
[1:48:14] That's right.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; All prickly.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; You know what that tells me? That
[1:48:18] getting in God's presence, yes. Do we
[1:48:20] need to read the word of God? We do. Do
[1:48:23] we need to get Do we need to pray? We
[1:48:25] do. That's that's part of it. But we
[1:48:27] need to do it so that it's more than
[1:48:29] just a routine.
[1:48:31] It must be, listen to me very carefully,
[1:48:34] getting into the word of God and even
[1:48:36] praying cannot replace
[1:48:40] giving God the right away in our lives.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; It might seem kind of odd to you, but
[1:48:45] you can't replace of letting God come
[1:48:48] down and and clean out all the channels
[1:48:50] of our life to where that when we come
[1:48:53] within it that we're praying. This is
[1:48:55] why when brother Ram says when we in
[1:48:57] prayer can really get before the throne
[1:48:59] of God,
[1:49:01] he said that person that maybe has done
[1:49:03] you wrong, he said when you've get
[1:49:05] before the throne of God, he said then
[1:49:09] you'll begin to put yourself
[1:49:12] in that person's shoes.
[1:49:15] And he says you'll begin to say, Lord,
[1:49:19] my brother didn't mean that.
[1:49:21] My sister didn't mean that. He said what
[1:49:24] you'll find is when you get there is
[1:49:27] your attitude will change.
[1:49:30] He says and you will come back down
[1:49:33] thinking that way. You know what that
[1:49:35] shows friends that many of the times
[1:49:37] we've prayed on our knees but we've
[1:49:40] never really got before the throne of
[1:49:42] God.
[1:49:44] Because prayer is not about how much
[1:49:46] time.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It's actually submitting our lives to
[1:49:52] the Lord. It's not. Brother Ram tells
[1:49:53] us, he said, "Prayer is not alltogether
[1:49:55] bringing man down to God, but it's
[1:49:56] bringing man up to where God is."
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's what real prayer is. And you know
[1:50:02] why many of the things, listen, you know
[1:50:04] how many of the things a lot of times
[1:50:06] we'll we'll go on, you know, the
[1:50:08] greatest the greatest resources we have
[1:50:11] as as believer, these things even that
[1:50:13] we're ministering on with divine love,
[1:50:17] you know, one of the greatest resources
[1:50:18] we have
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; is prayer.
[1:50:22] is prayer.
[1:50:24] Lord, I want to lay aside all the
[1:50:26] formalities.
[1:50:28] Lord God, work in me. Not not taking
[1:50:31] somebody else, not complaining, not not
[1:50:33] doing this, not doing, but Lord, in me.
[1:50:35] Start right here.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; Start right here, Lord. Start right
[1:50:38] here. Amen. It's easy. We can look at,
[1:50:40] you know, we can look and see one
[1:50:41] another's faults and this and that. But
[1:50:42] sometimes God, you know, God allows
[1:50:44] things to be shown or we see things to
[1:50:47] watch what kind of attitude we're going
[1:50:49] to take towards it
[1:50:51] because the attitude itself matters.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; But getting in his presence and really
[1:50:57] praying,
[1:50:59] I know I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:51:00] your hand, but I know we've all been
[1:51:02] there.
[1:51:05] been in prayer and all of a sudden you
[1:51:08] come out of prayer, man, maybe you're
[1:51:10] hit or blindsided with something and
[1:51:13] you're in prayer and you what you're in
[1:51:15] prayer with is Lord, I don't want this
[1:51:17] in my heart.
[1:51:19] I don't want this in my life. I don't
[1:51:21] want this feeling. I don't want this,
[1:51:23] Lord. I Anybody know what I'm talking
[1:51:26] about?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Greatest thing that we can do is be able
[1:51:29] to just just pour our hearts out before
[1:51:31] him. Lord, let this be a resolve. Maybe
[1:51:33] it's maybe it's about a co-orker. Maybe
[1:51:36] it's a boss. Maybe it's something. Maybe
[1:51:37] it's somebody in the church. Maybe it's
[1:51:39] somebody. But you know, friends, listen.
[1:51:41] No matter where it is or where it might
[1:51:43] be, let me just tell you something.
[1:51:45] Satan will not let that stay in just one
[1:51:47] confined area of your life,
[1:51:50] if it's an issue that's unresolved at
[1:51:53] work, it'll follow right into your home
[1:51:56] and follow right right into the church.
[1:51:59] This is where that prayer and just
[1:52:02] really submitting ourselves to the Lord.
[1:52:04] God,
[1:52:06] Lord, help me. Give me the grace I need.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; You got that confidence. Lord, I've got
[1:52:11] confidence in the life of what you've
[1:52:13] done in my life. Lord, let that is that
[1:52:15] quote that brother Samuel read today,
[1:52:17] agape love would make you. That that's
[1:52:19] my desire. Lord,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; let your love step to the bow of this
[1:52:22] ship. Lord,
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; let the love of God because we all have
[1:52:26] things, friends, that we could go down
[1:52:27] through May, maybe disappointments and
[1:52:29] everything else, but let let me just say
[1:52:31] this. We are going to need God's grace.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; And I want to remind you, one of the
[1:52:35] greatest things that God has called us
[1:52:37] to do is to be a channel like we begin
[1:52:40] to speak on on Sunday, an outlet of
[1:52:42] faith. And one of the greatest things
[1:52:44] within Mark 11 that was placed there is
[1:52:49] when we pray, "Father, forgive me
[1:52:54] of my trespasses
[1:52:56] even as
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; I also forgive others."
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; See, whatever whatever the forgiveness
[1:53:06] that you measure out, if it's this
[1:53:07] small, that's how much you get. Oh, but
[1:53:10] we're talking about a great big God. But
[1:53:12] see, God, you see what it is? God has
[1:53:14] placed that limitations or based on
[1:53:18] where we in our lives would actually
[1:53:22] open up to him. If we only want if it's
[1:53:24] only just going to be a measure, then
[1:53:26] it's just a small measure of
[1:53:27] forgiveness. But I don't know about you,
[1:53:30] but I don't just want it. I need it.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I need it. Because actually without that
[1:53:35] forgiveness reigning in our heart the
[1:53:37] way that it should be, we can't have the
[1:53:40] faith that we need to have.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure. It may have faith to work
[1:53:43] miracles, faith to heal, faith to do
[1:53:46] this, faith to maybe even to go in and
[1:53:48] expound the word, and what are more, but
[1:53:49] I'm not talking I'm talking about a
[1:53:51] rapturing faith.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; That faith that Paul re writes of in 1
[1:53:55] Corinthians 13 is not a rapturing faith.
[1:53:58] It's not a perfect faith. But I'm
[1:54:00] talking about a faith that no matter the
[1:54:02] conditions,
[1:54:04] no matter even if God says no, a faith
[1:54:08] that will stand there and say, "I don't
[1:54:10] understand, but I love you anyhow,
[1:54:12] Lord."
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith,
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; that he's coming back for. Hallelujah.
[1:54:21] Don't you love him?
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many
[1:54:26] say, "Lord, I want more."
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; I want more. Lord, I want to sink in.
[1:54:30] Paul would rely, Paul would relate it to
[1:54:33] us many of the times is sinking in. Put
[1:54:35] on is sinking more into this garment.
[1:54:38] You might say, "Brother Samuel, I I need
[1:54:39] more to let's let let aside this. Maybe
[1:54:41] there's things of the world, but just
[1:54:42] sink more into his love." Just say,
[1:54:44] "Lord, let more of the love of God just
[1:54:46] take over my life." Whatever your need
[1:54:48] is right here tonight, how many believe
[1:54:51] that God is just as much God on Thursday
[1:54:53] night as he is on Sunday?
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; He's just as much God.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father,
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see, Father, the needs, Lord.
[1:55:03] You see our hearts. You see our lives,
[1:55:06] Lord. What a comfort, Lord, as we look
[1:55:09] over this in your word. Oh, it's it
[1:55:12] challenges us, Lord. I I've said this to
[1:55:15] him, Lord, over the years. every time
[1:55:16] that I've found myself Lord to minister
[1:55:20] Lord not just minister upon these things
[1:55:22] but you know even in my own heart Lord
[1:55:26] Lord God within my heart I'll reflect
[1:55:30] I want to I want to reflect Lord not
[1:55:32] just upon what's said
[1:55:35] but the character
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; spirit
[1:55:39] I want to reflect upon these things Lord
[1:55:43] sometimes Lord you know just pouring
[1:55:45] over my mind and my heart time and time
[1:55:48] again.
[1:55:50] I don't believe Lord that that would
[1:55:52] just be me. I know in the capacity as a
[1:55:54] pastor, as a minister,
[1:55:57] but I believe God that that's something
[1:56:00] that lays in our hearts as believers.
[1:56:05] Lord, we find that
[1:56:08] the more that as we're really in your
[1:56:10] presence,
[1:56:14] I want to ask you, Lord, forgive us
[1:56:17] for when we've allowed cares of this
[1:56:19] life.
[1:56:22] Maybe it's just been like a compounding
[1:56:25] of things that's happened.
[1:56:28] Maybe Lord
[1:56:30] just feeling like they're just all
[1:56:32] surrounded and seems like arrows are
[1:56:35] being shot from everywhere.
[1:56:38] But I pray father in the midst of this
[1:56:40] moment
[1:56:43] may Lord God as your children realize we
[1:56:46] have a source
[1:56:48] a place
[1:56:50] where we can go to Lord.
[1:56:53] We have Lord a fountain that's open and
[1:56:56] available to us Lord.
[1:56:59] Oh God the love of God.
[1:57:01] How rich and pure
[1:57:04] Lord from the very
[1:57:07] resource
[1:57:10] of your own life. Lord it's your love
[1:57:13] that conquered our lives.
[1:57:16] It overthrew that ownership that we were
[1:57:19] under.
[1:57:21] And Lord God, our lives are not under a
[1:57:23] governance of fear and laws,
[1:57:28] having to do this and can't do this and
[1:57:31] can do this and can't do that. No, as a
[1:57:34] matter of fact,
[1:57:36] like your prophet would lay it out,
[1:57:38] Lord, all the way through.
[1:57:41] He said, "What kind of home would that
[1:57:42] be if it was under fear?"
[1:57:46] But he said, "Even if I knew that I
[1:57:48] could go out,
[1:57:51] I could smoke, I could drink, I could
[1:57:52] run around and come back and he'd
[1:57:56] forgive me," he said, "I wouldn't want
[1:57:59] to do it
[1:58:01] because I don't want to displease him."
[1:58:07] That's what it is, Lord.
[1:58:11] We don't want to displease you.
[1:58:16] Forgive us Lord when
[1:58:19] maybe Lord there's a thought that we've
[1:58:22] entertained
[1:58:24] something Lord has come our way because
[1:58:26] Lord as your prophet would give those
[1:58:29] three examples he would give things over
[1:58:30] and over Lord my examples where men
[1:58:34] would ride him and my they would rake
[1:58:35] him up one side and down the other and
[1:58:38] he wrote back the dean of that Lutheran
[1:58:40] college he said brother
[1:58:43] I'm sure you didn't mean to say that to
[1:58:45] me.
[1:58:48] While you've been preaching this gospel
[1:58:52] a lot longer than I have,
[1:58:56] been alive a whole lot longer.
[1:58:59] Lord, it's such grace
[1:59:03] that to me, Lord, when I I see that I
[1:59:05] don't look,
[1:59:08] it's not the aspiring, Lord, to be
[1:59:12] [Music]
[1:59:13] William Brandham.
[1:59:15] But Lord, this message has brought you
[1:59:17] in full view.
[1:59:21] It brought you to a place to where,
[1:59:22] Lord, we can see you and see you for who
[1:59:25] you really are. and to realize in our
[1:59:27] own lives that Lord, you've not called
[1:59:30] us into that position. It was not that
[1:59:34] position that gave that to brother
[1:59:36] Brandham. It was not the gift in his
[1:59:39] life that made that in his life.
[1:59:44] It was not because he was the prophet of
[1:59:47] the age that did that. Because if that
[1:59:51] was so, we would have an excuse.
[1:59:57] But that was because
[2:00:00] of that creative power
[2:00:04] of the Holy Spirit, the deity of God
[2:00:07] down on the inside.
[2:00:09] [Music]
[2:00:11] Oh God,
[2:00:14] there's hope for all of us, Lord.
[2:00:17] that Father, that same grace, that same
[2:00:19] love to prevail through each of our
[2:00:22] lives.
[2:00:24] Maybe right here tonight, Lord, as a
[2:00:26] husband, maybe a wife, maybe a father,
[2:00:29] mother, grandparent, brother, sister,
[2:00:33] but here tonight, Lord, hearts that
[2:00:35] would just ask you, Lord,
[2:00:39] let your love prevail in my life. Lord,
[2:00:43] let your love override, Lord God.
[2:00:46] It all begins with recognizing your word
[2:00:48] to be the truth. Lord, let that agape
[2:00:52] rise, oh God.
[2:00:55] Lord God, that will bring forth that
[2:00:57] reaction in our lives. It will lead us,
[2:01:01] Lord, into that place,
[2:01:04] declaring your victory, Lord, through
[2:01:06] our lives.
[2:01:09] I think of it, Lord.
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] I know many different times and ways we
[2:01:16] would look at how victory would somehow
[2:01:19] look.
[2:01:22] Would victory be where that we are able
[2:01:25] to outsmart somebody,
[2:01:27] out quote them?
[2:01:29] Is that what victory really is?
[2:01:33] Or would victory be
[2:01:36] that atmosphere that would rise from
[2:01:39] within
[2:01:42] and take a hold
[2:01:45] that even when things would be said that
[2:01:48] would try to
[2:01:50] draw us out like it tried to like Moses
[2:01:52] was drawn out
[2:01:55] and we would set there Lord maybe at
[2:01:58] times a scripture not even coming to our
[2:02:01] mind but that's your protection,
[2:02:05] but to be able, Lord God, to submit
[2:02:07] ourselves to you in that time.
[2:02:12] I find that example
[2:02:15] when you came to this earth,
[2:02:19] they pressed upon you veheminently, the
[2:02:22] Bible said, with questions.
[2:02:26] They were trying to get you to say
[2:02:29] certain things.
[2:02:32] They would press upon you to answer
[2:02:34] certain things.
[2:02:37] And I find in the scriptures where you
[2:02:40] would slip away,
[2:02:45] not arrogantly,
[2:02:49] sometimes even declaring it was not even
[2:02:51] the time.
[2:02:53] Other times there would be an answer. It
[2:02:56] wasn't that the answer wasn't there. But
[2:02:58] I wonder, Lord, sometimes
[2:03:01] what is real
[2:03:03] victory?
[2:03:04] [Music]
[2:03:07] Lord God, I can't help but believe the
[2:03:09] greatest victory
[2:03:12] is what you've done in our lives and
[2:03:15] being able by the grace of God to bring
[2:03:17] this outer man
[2:03:20] in subjection.
[2:03:23] when this outer man can feel maybe
[2:03:26] embarrassment, but the love of God could
[2:03:28] reach right down and take a hold in our
[2:03:31] lives,
[2:03:33] being able to stand there, Lord,
[2:03:38] and just hold our peace. Oh God,
[2:03:44] oh Jesus, how much different it is,
[2:03:47] Lord, I'm sure, than what we we think.
[2:03:51] Help us.
[2:03:53] You said in your word to sanctify in our
[2:03:57] hearts always. Let everything be cleared
[2:03:59] out. Let there be nothing that would be
[2:04:02] unlike you. Let our lives be channels
[2:04:05] that we might be always ready to give an
[2:04:08] answer.
[2:04:11] Lord, I don't want to give an answer
[2:04:14] where malice is the motive. I don't want
[2:04:16] to give an answer
[2:04:21] if the motive is not love.
[2:04:25] Close my mouth. Take it from my mind.
[2:04:29] Grant it, Lord. And let the love of God
[2:04:32] prevail, Lord.
[2:04:34] Grant it, Lord. I pray, Father,
[2:04:37] in this gathering, Lord, this body of
[2:04:39] believers. Grant it, Lord. We're asking
[2:04:41] you, Lord.
[2:04:43] Let it be Lord God the great agape love
[2:04:46] just
[2:04:48] overriding
[2:04:51] override Lord that felio love override
[2:04:54] Lord lead us Lord as a lamb was led to
[2:04:58] the slaughter lead us Lord to die to
[2:05:01] ourselves
[2:05:03] lead us Lord I pray
[2:05:06] grant it Lord
[2:05:09] grant it father for every need Lord for
[2:05:12] every life, every heart. Grant it Lord
[2:05:15] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:19] Yes, Lord.
[2:05:21] Go ahead and lead us.
[2:05:25] Oh, we have had enough
[2:05:28] of getting everything we want.
[2:05:35] We are weary of
[2:05:38] living this life just for us.
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:45] Oh, forgive us all for seeking your hand
[2:05:49] and not your face.
[2:05:54] But come and empty us. Father, we are
[2:05:57] desperate in this flame.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit,
[2:06:06] fill us with your fire.
[2:06:11] Give us your desires.
[2:06:15] Yes, Lord.

[2:06:42] and more and more of you.

[2:06:51] much more than we deserve.

[2:06:59] by the power of your word.
[2:07:05] Oh, so God, we lift you up, giving you
[2:07:08] the honor that is yours.
[2:07:13] We want to thank you for your love.

[2:09:05] Hold us close to you.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Lord, Holy Spirit,
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; yes Lord, give us revelation.
[2:09:17] Oh, healing visitation

[2:15:19] same love is in us.
