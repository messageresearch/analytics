reach him amen amen aren't you glad for that amen oh my job job chapter 9 you say brother Stephen what's your favorite book in the Bible this one right here I love the Book of Job and uh and I'm gonna pull something out of here um oh man I just can't wait amen Job chapter nine we're gonna start at verse 25. I'm going to read through the rest of the chapter Job chapter 9 verse 25 watch what job says here now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good they are passed away as the Swift ships as the eagle that has the hasteth to the prey if I say I will forget my complaint I will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself I am afraid of all my sorrows I know that thou will not hold me innocent if I be Wicked then why then labor I in vain if I wash myself with snow water and make my hands Never Never So Clean yet shall thou plunge me into the ditch my own clothes shall abhor me for he is not a man as I am that I should answer him and we shouldn't come together in judgment this is my text neither is there a days man betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both let him take his Rod away from me let not his fear terrify me then would I speak and not fear but it is not so with me we buy our hits with a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace and your mercy Lord Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for thy anointing Lord God that you come to meet us this morning Lord Jesus to speak to our hearts o God now Lord Jesus as our Prophet taught us we come to the most important part of the service we pray God that you would take the words this morning Lord and just speak to each Heart Lord God Lord God if my thoughts in the study that I've done would mean nothing then I pray you would you would push that aside oh God and just speak what we all have need of Lord for I have came as well Lord God to hear from you Lord Jesus may you just speak to our hearts o God Minister unto us Lord you promised by the foolishness of preaching you will save them that believe and here we are a bunch of Believers Lord God and we're seeking you o God show us your mercy and your grace this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's precious name the church said together amen God bless you you may be seen and uh this morning we want to preach a message called a day's man has appeared a day's man has appeared and as I read this scripture you might have noticed job did not paint a pretty nice picture when he was speaking here right and the reason why is because Joe blessed facing the fact of his sins facing the fact of his life condition and what he could possibly do as far as himself to get him out of this situation he was facing the reality of it and what was the reality no matter how much he would wash himself he'd still be dirty right if if I'm going to sin anyways why am I laboring when I'm going to fail anyways and see every man woman and child has to come to that point to realize that no matter how hard they try you can't just get yourself into heaven no matter how hard you try there's no sinlessness for you you can't work it up I think I said this last time I was here if you had so much Holiness could you Garner so much Holiness in your life that when you added to God he became more holy of course not amen so see he was facing that reality that no matter how hard I try there's no chance I have whatsoever but if you notice at the end he gets a revelation because even though he might not be able to do it there is a way of Escape for him glory to God in Hallelujah because he said in verse 32 for he is not a man as I am that I should answer him now we should come together in judgment neither is there any days ma'am betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both so he's showing the answer here I tell you what God knows how to do it sometimes because when you're struggling and you're trying to figure out God's going to bring the answer amen and he was struggling but God inspired him to say something here amen he was inspired he found he was going look I ain't got a chance but if I can only fight a daze man if I go if I somebody could lay their head upon me and God do you know what he's saying here in verse 33 if there was a day's man then then that means there would be a chance for him Hallelujah glory to God now you say brother Stephen you keep saying days man days man what's the days man I agree it's I don't know what it means either until I looked it up and the days man literally means mediator an agitator a lawyer a man that's what it means a mediator right man and what's a mediator a go-between amen it's somebody Hallelujah that can lay a hand upon you and God and bring you together amen glory to God First Timothy 2 5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus Catholicism I don't know if you know this because Austin likes to change this scripture and say there's a meteor between God and man so see then they then their Pope becomes the mediator between the mediator and you that's not what it said amen there's one mediator between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus there's no preacher there's no church that you take that place for you [Applause] Hallelujah and notices what job is saying here he is going through some trials job is and he's seen these tries and go I ain't got a chance if I can only find a days man if I can only find a law here that would stand for me then I can make it then amen what about the ram said brother man said the judge became your attorney Hallelujah I'll tell you something if the judge is your attorney how do you lose if the guy representing you is the guy doing the judging how in the world can you lose that oh you sit there and you talk like job though don't you sometimes oh wow woe is me I can't do it amen he had a reason to cry about it amen he was looking for a days man but I'm here to tell you a days man has appeared amen you do have somebody who's stands for you amen and it's Jesus Christ now listen I had to do an audible and had him do a quote for me real quick there's a quote in the token 640308 paragraph 121. I want to read this real quick because I want to show you you are represented and you have to have evidence of this representation which is the token I'm talking about brother Benson I'm talking about the identification of the token Jesus Christ raise and is now identifying himself to re-vindicate his promised word of this day and the church said amen okay so you do have somebody representing you amen you do have a way of Escape it's just not through the way of working it up all the time you know what I mean like getting into your mind I'm going to tell you something friends I think a lot of our mind battles is our fault yeah can I just be real with you amen a lot of our mind battles is just our fault sometimes yeah amen I mean think about it it's look at it like this let's say you were sitting there at home and all of a sudden you get a call that you have a bill five thousand dollars and you go oh no right do you know why you do that oh no because they're eight five thousand dollars in the bank is there and that's why you're going oh no hey man but let's look at the story a little differently let's say in the bank you had a million dollars and then the bill came and said you owe five thousand dollars well what in the world that's okay I got the money in the bank I have plenty to pay the bill off amen oh aren't you glad for that friends hey man do you see where I'm going amen you might have a huge bill to pay but somebody came and paid a price for you amen so if he already paid the price what are you nervous about then hallelujah they already paid the bill when he died on the cross he said it is finished you know what that literally means means paid in full he didn't just abolish sin just by using an eraser amen he paid the debt there was a debt for sin Jesus came and paid the debt so quit walking up like you got to pay more debt you have a mediator Hallelujah who can condemn you of sin it is Christ that justifies huh are you bigger than God all of a sudden think about it like this can your sins be so big that it beats God's will no you're sitting there all tough yeah God don't you know I need to be punished I prayed that before in case you wonder I remember a lot when I was a young Christian I did some pretty stupid stuff and uh I was praying one day I said Lord I need to be punished I said God bring the bring the hammer of judgment on me I should get in trouble for this Lord and he spoke to me he said no and I'm like God I was wrong I need to be punished no he spoke to Martin he always said he said if I did punish you you have more faith in the punishment than me and I went whoa that's pretty heavy amen see a lot of times amen we're sitting here wallowing on our Despair and worrying can I say something here depression okay it's a real thing amen and anxiety and so forth I'm not dying to deny it but you realize being depressed makes no sense as a Christian I mean think about it objectively God's on your side if God's your helper well how can you lose you can't lose amen there's a mediator ain't a dance man has appeared in these last days and you need to step up and believe it amen foreign you ain't guilty Hallelujah you know what Jesus said Remember When Jesus and the disciples were going to pick up uh eat the corn and so forth and the Pharisees came around and said um you're doing that which is unlawful in the Sabbath day he said did you not read when David ate the shoe bread which was unlawful he said but if you would have understand what I meant that I would not have sacrificed but Mercy then you would not have condemned the Guiltless what you are Guiltless this morning amen give me some homework go listen to partying again maybe some of you need to go hear it again you know what brother man said about pardon when you're pardoned amen that means you never did to begin with means you have no guilt that's how saved you are you have a mediator you have a dazed man God saved you from the sins [Music] we gotta stop walking around so defeated I mean just just sometimes I wonder if sometimes our prayers God just wants to pull his hair out sometimes you know what the Bible says the Bible says I do not frustrate the grace of God for if righteousness came by the law then Christ died in vain now you've all been frustrated before I know you have [Laughter] I remember when the kids were younger and and one day I went upstairs and uh there was a bunch of cram marks on the side of the wall kids found a bunch of crayons to start walking up mama goes up there she got frustrated that night you know why because Mama's got to wipe off all that crayons laughs during the kiss you know what I'm talking right then did she can you frustrate the grace of God what would you need to do to frustrate God's grace you know what it is is when you stop believing it right when you stop believing in it Leave the Past Dead leave your sins dead do you know all your sins that they're dead in the blood of Christ they've been divorced and you're separated from you know gray digging's a crime right if you go out to this graveyard today and you go start digging you're going to get arrested I think God sent this Angel today to rest some people in here quit grave digging so much quit bringing up the past quit grave digging and start believing what God Said Amen you do have a gays man which we're gonna get to now but boy oh my goodness praise the Lord you love the Lord I want to talk about another character in the Bible that went through this similar with job you may not it's it was amazing how God connected this to me but there was a there was a little old lady who used to walk in the city of Jericho and her name was Rahab and I love this story so much I hope you don't mind a little dramatization this morning amen because I think about these characters a lot of times when I read the Bible a lot of times when I look at these characters I try to put myself in their shoes for a second and you think about Rahab for a second and you know why she would even want to ask the things that we're going to read about in a second why would she even come up to these conclusions because she would be walking through the same town everybody else in that City walk through they I saw some estimates there was anywhere between a thousand and five thousand people in this town at the time and that may sound small in our day but in their day having a big town they call Jericho the longest standing city in the world it's the oldest city in the world they say and and she would have she would have been walking in Jericho she saw the same walls everybody else saw she worked there right and she probably had some bad times in her life who knows what happened to her you know brother bam says she probably had some family problems he and brother baby would say poor little Rahab probably had some family trolls some bad luck on her life and that's why she ended up being a harlot it was the only way she could pay the bills amen matter of fact they say that the house she in was probably also a Tavern of some fourth amen some place where people could spend the night or something so she was running an establishment and maybe one morning she was walking to the you know during that day when you want to go get groceries you had to go down to the market and you had to go every day because there was no such thing as preservatives maybe they ought to go back to that let's just say be real hey man we're not gonna do no listen I'm going to eat some I'm gonna eat some bad food this afternoon so I better not say anything amen but my point is this is that every day you would have to go to the market every day to get food and think about a Rahab walking through here and she would start hearing the rumors about this ragtag group of people coming from the south yeah and hearing all these things that they did right and maybe she was talking with someone you know how you know how women folks knew at the store sometimes maybe she was talking to some of the other sisters or ladies and they're talking about what they hear and they're hearing about this nation down there who split the Red Sea maybe some of us say ah you know that's all just fables or myths still but something and Rahab told her there was something more to it you see what I'm saying there was just something there amen something that you can't explain something that you can't quite put under a microscope and find it and see oh that's why she's thinking like that can you see yourself a little bit amen [Laughter] something's true about what I just heard did you hear how they took out Xi'an and OG and so forth and these kingdoms this this bunch of slaves from Egypt oh they knew how to do was build prick and yet they're taking out Nations and they're here and they're coming to Jericho and maybe she's hearing these stories these stories are affecting her differently than everybody else Hallelujah hey man like when you hear about squirrels come into existence and then some people say that might have been imagination but something told you there's something to this here when you hear a man called to South Africa amen oh he was just another Pentecostal preacher but something was different about him to you there are something different about this message oh yeah it wasn't just another Pentecostal preacher another healing another Oral Roberts or Billy Graham there's something different about this what was the difference it was the word that's the difference the same thing in Rahab here that's the difference there was something in her what was that something it was her representation she was from somewhere [Applause] glory to God it ain't Rocket Science Church you know there's something different amen it ain't just a bunch of fireworks there's something in your heart that recognizes it what's the Bible says our spirit with his Spirit witnesses that we're the sons of God [Applause] don't deny that that's something real yeah just like Rahab here just a small little country girl City girl rather trying to work you know bad times and so forth but she's hearing these testimonies and she's going is there a chance for me you know what brother Bram said I got the quote but we're just going to preach I hope you don't mind thought she said oh if I could just have mercy oh if I just had a chance she didn't want to be in the condition she was in life was hard to her I'm gonna preach now okay you think about those people out there amen you go I can't believe you can call in that sin of course they're calling this in that's all the world gives them right some poor little lady out there who ended up having two kids or something like that through prostitution and stuff like that be careful what you say about her she might be a rehab oh great cool preach it brother Stephen I think I will listen Okay well we're just home folk now aren't we hey man I just I feel important don't get too messy that's right and you know exactly what I mean we sometimes create Cloisters and then we forget what we're called to do yes we're here to bring Salvation how are they going to hear about the message if you don't say nothing [Applause] you gotta pipe up you gotta say it sometime you might be there to be a Rahab and come out of it amen listen because one time Rahab was walking thinking about these things going I wish I could get out of this and all of a sudden maybe she goes into her back into her Tavern if you will and there was two gentlemen standing at the counter hey man so she rushes try to take care of him and so forth and one thing led to another and I don't know maybe they were trying to hide their clothes and maybe their clothes were a little different being from Egypt I mean I have no idea maybe they had a little star of David well David wasn't alive yet was he but maybe they just looked different to her than everybody else something told her about these two guys right she said I gotta ask you guys a question are you guys are you guys Jewish Israelites oh they get all nervous a little bit how'd you know that oh glory to God how did you know we were different I don't know something in me told me you were different and they get to talking and what did Brother Graham say brother Graham said God must have slept two tape boys into that house because all of a sudden they brought a message with them Hallelujah they brought a message with them and they started playing those tapes and brother Brian said Rahab turned her whole house into a church that night you can have church wherever you're at amen the church ate these four walls is where you're at you're the church [Applause] can I say something to you those preachers were playing those tapes for her that's what I'm saying don't get too messy amen what if there's a rave out there needs to hear some tapes amen you got them you can pass them along don't be ashamed of what we believe [Music] don't get so scared about it amen oh you believe God sent a prophet of course I do he spent a whole bunch of them in the Bible before what's different now don't get so nervous about this stuff amen listen the world might have changed God did it he said when he was gonna bring the word when the Lord God has spoken who came but prophesied [Applause] he will do nothing until he first reveals it to his servants the prophets he's never changed it oh yeah the world changed it just want to call you a bunch of man followers Mormons over and he says whatever amen just trying to make any name just to try to get you off a little bit let him call you a man of worshiper who cares you know where you stand brother bam did die for my sins I will worship Jesus I ain't got time to worship brother Brown [Applause] can I just because somebody calls you something don't mean you are [Applause] well that was free just so you know amen rehab her started listening to these tapes that night and something was transforming inside of her something was working inside of you can you can you say Amen do you know how we know something was working on rehab because the same message did something to you you can't explain it can you you can't sit here and go well that's because of this you know brother Ram said that he even knew who your grandfather grandfather grandfather was and he lined all those people up to mayor who they're married have kids just for you to show up right good God was thinking about you before you were even born so if God was thinking about you then what makes you think he stopped all of a sudden come on Amen God's our Ally he's working with us and though Rahab was through some hard times she had a rough life no wonder she could speak like job did there in job 9. where her life was rough too hey man but she was looking for her days man she was looking for something that could represent her get her out of the situation she was in that and all of a sudden we know the story guard started showing up at the house Rahab was so determined to do kindness to these two guys to honor God's message and his Messengers are you hearing me God was she was so willing to honor it she hit him up in the uh in the roof until the guards hey they went out of town ain't that something I want you to think about this for a second Rahab lied to those guards you ever thought about that for a second Ray obliged they they asked him where did those guys go and she said that away when they were up on the roof do you see what I'm saying I want you to get this point very clear okay God is stronger than sin the church might have condemned Rahab for doing something like that but God did it as a matter of fact the Bible says in Hebrews 11 31 by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace really the God God has even mentioned it God even mentioned matter of fact it's amazing where you find Rahab in the Bible amen these guys uh in James 2 24. you see now you see that now how by works and man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and that set them out another way she did this by faith she was believing in something amen that God didn't reckon it to her or we don't know I mean I can't say her and just explain to you every little thing why you know even though Rahab lied here why did God look over it but God is greater amen than sin [Applause] God's the boss can he say Amen and God's looking at Rahab here and saying she's she's showing kindness to the message and she did something she was justified by her words she did something here to help them hiding him on a roof sending those guys that way right yeah but she wasn't done yet she wasn't done yet see that kindness wasn't just good enough can I say something kindness ain't just gonna make it for you just because you do a good work don't mean you're gonna make it and listen Rahab knew that too because in Joshua 2 9 watch us here Joshua 2 9 watches here and she said unto the man I know that the Lord hath given you the land and that your Terror has fallen upon us and all the inhabitants the land faint because of you for we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt when you did unto the two kings of the Emirates that were on the other side of a Jordan Xi'an whom you utterly destroyed and as soon as we heard these things our hearts didn't melt neither there remain any more courage and man because of you for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above and the Earth beneath now do you notice she's saying these testimonies and she don't start this is a quote now brother man says she don't start going oh can I just see Joshua then I need to see some more miracles first I need to see some more things happen no when she heard the testimony of these two spies in a message it was good enough for her [Applause] hey man it was good enough for her she said I've seen it and I believe it I see what the message says I see what the messenger said and I'm accepting it she's the only one in town to do it she was the minority if you will you might be the only one in your family who's doing it amen now watch Rahab has this revelation but the Revelation needs to produce something you can know all the Mysteries and if you don't have love you and go make it right that's what Paul said amen you can have a bunch of Revelation you can know all about the message brother bam said you can know all about the token until it's applied is when it starts having an effect in your life and Rahab knew this somehow she knew this that's why it's so amazing about this story she was a gentile in this time and God positioned her there one predestinated seat in all the city of Jericho and watch what she says here when she's talking about in verse 12. now therefore I pray you're swearing to me by the Lord since I have showed you kindness that you will also show kindness unto my father's health and give me a true token think about this for a second why does she want a token so bad why does she want a token so bad you know why she wants a token so bad because the words inside of her we've been seeing it non-stop that Rahab had the word inside of her the whole time and the word knows what it needs Glory the word recognizes it in its heart and say listen this kindness ain't good enough Glory just this Revelation ain't good enough I need something to represent me I need a token what do I need I need a dazed man to appear and look these two spies had nothing from Joshua Joshua never told him about a token or anything but rahab's Faith was so real it was the word her faith reached out through the message and pulled to her a token she needed it so bad that she said I need a true token and she pulled it right out of the message oh glory to God and what did God send you on these last days amen he sent you a message and he told you that Tolkien is Jesus Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] and if you're lacking a token today don't worry a day's man has appeared you can reach out in faith and take it unto yourself [Applause] listen you ain't gonna make it without the Holy Ghost well brother Raymond said anybody who's not under that token perished in Jericho right right which we're going to find out here in a second listen Rahab God's provided it to you you just got to pull it to yourself Rahab didn't have a promise whatsoever that's right no those two Messengers didn't have a word from Joshua but her faith was so real her faith was so real it created a token to her now watch what this token is we know what it is right he he she ended up sending those two spies out the window remember she lived in the walls too right remember that's gonna be important leader she lived in those walls and she could put out a Scarlet thread who carries Scarlet thread with him must have been a rope or something you know what I mean something to hold their weights to bring them down who has red rope but she did that day god listen the the token was already there before she knew it was a token right before it became a token it already existed God already had the bases for the Holy Ghost here the whole time but then God sent a message to reveal it to you that that same spiritual wage raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body and those preachers those take boys if you will start going down that Scarlet thread and they said this same Scarlet thread that you're saving us with the same thread that saved them was going to save Rahab can I say this oh we're gonna we're gonna go real deep you want to come with me amen any real preacher preaches it just like that too amen there's not a different salvation for preachers than for the people see what I'm saying the same salvation the same thread that saved those two spies was the same thread that saved her whole household it was the same token it's the same baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no big eyes and little use in the house of God Amen We're All in This Together amen it's the same word amen that saves us all isn't this just amazing Rahab I mean she's a gentile she's not even a Jew herself she's acting just like any other Gentile though hello hello the world I have been nice to you has it the world's trying to destroy you too trying to hurt you and destroy you kill you the Bible says Satan goes as a roaring lion seeking him he may devour the Royal hasn't been nice to you and you needed a token you needed a mediator you needed a day's man to show up right right amen and if Rahab could do it with no promise how much more you with a promise amen so think about it Rahab gets this promise this is all she has is the word of those two preachers can I say listen God honored her faith in what those two preachers said you hear me church sometimes we like to you know oh you're just you're just a man I know I'm just a man but if God speaks you know God will honor you if you believe it do you okay we're gonna do a little side test if you don't mind about that dude yeah I called the Rabbit Trail remember that okay we're gonna do a little Rabbit Trail do you know how powerful that is God honors what his preacher says Moses one time amen was told by God to go speak to the Rock and water would come out and remember remember he smoked the Rock first but he was supposed to speak to the Rock next but he got so upset one morning that Moses the prophet said shall I get water out for you for a bunch of Sluggers took a stick and smoked the rock twice brother Graham said he broke the entire plan of God why because Christ was only supposed to die once then you speak to the Rock when he smoked the rock twice he was typing a second crucifixion and that's not what God was going to do so he broke the entire plan of God As a matter of fact this is the incident which keeps him out of the Promised Land he gets so much in trouble that he's not even allowed on the promised land now because of what he did here so he so look Moses didn't do what God told him to do but what came out of The Rock when you smoke it water still came out right and it still took care of those two million people who are believing the message of the hour God still honored those people's faith in the prophet Moses God still honored it even though he messed up even though he messed up God honored their faith in the message oh they say brother brother Brandon made a bunch of mistakes maybe he did maybe he didn't I'm not here to be the referee of it oh that was Freak Free amen people like to outprofit the prophet sometime as if they can referee what God decided true amen oh you said oh brother Brandon made a bunch of mistakes well maybe he did God still honors it he went beyond the curtain of time I didn't eat it and he went over there and he saw them over there [Applause] amen and what did he say remember at first he thought are these brainums no these are your converts [Applause] got any conference here this morning these are your converts then what did Brothers say he said what about Paul's people Paul's people when he judge according to their day then he said if Paul's people make it my people make it who are his people his converts hello and what did those converts say we're resting on that Hallelujah you got a chance this morning you don't have to stay here and try to figure out all the mistakes if you just honor what God did he's gonna get you through amen [Music] Hallelujah praise the Lord Jesus oh Hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus oh thank you Lord for our message oh Hallelujah aren't you so thankful for that oh you know why we can shout and praise the Lord the burdens being lifted off we're free in the blood we don't got to see her and figure everything out God promised it and he's gonna do it amen you didn't waste his time with the message I thank God he sent him over beyond the current attire and I found out where I was going Hallelujah I don't need to see it I've heard and I believe the report amen got any rahabs in here you didn't see it you didn't see all those people over there did you you didn't see it you just heard it and believed it amen praise the Lord Jesus whoo I'll tell you what it's good when he starts preaching amen Hallelujah oh man we're gonna make it Church don't you worry you brother Brandon convert and we're resting we're not resting on his flesh can I let's just get that okay people always open the baby steak I don't trust his memory you know what I mean I can't even trust my own memory why would I trust his but the word he preached [Applause] but the word that he preaches what I'm leaning on make sure you find out whether it's true or not you know what it means when you're leaning that means if it would fall you'd fall with it that's when you know you're leaning lean not to thy own understanding get back into this word get back into this message you're not crazy for believing God's in a prophet it's the word of God Made Real for your day [Applause] you know why I'm a message believer I got a whole sermon on this just so you know but you're going to get the cliff notes do you know I'm a message believer it's not because of those pictures it's not because of those pictures you know why I'm a message believer because the word may flesh for my day it was the scripture Made Alive yeah let's take those two pictures for a second we got a picture of a pillar of fire we got a picture of a seven angel cloud I believe because you're scriptural how do you know brother Stephen when the children of Israel were being led through the Wilderness at night they were led by a pillar of fire and that day a pillar of cloud in 1950 brother bam taught us the laodicea church age was going completely black all the light was being stepped out through denominationalism but in 1950 at a debate about healing God made sure his Prophet was up there and in the darkness he made a light amen doing what leaving his church at Night by a pillar of Fire I took a picture of a pillar fire right 13 years later God goes to that same prophet and puts him on Sunset Mountain amen and he saw the little birds the big birds and then he saw angels fly and just at that time they took a picture and brother right I'm still in the seals were open it was the rising of the Sun so when the sun was being Rose the day was breaking forth and what happened God put a pillar of cloud in the sky I'm not a message believer just because God took two Supernatural photos that's right I am a message believer because those Supernatural photos had to have been the same God in the Bible he doesn't change at night he let him buy a pillow fire and that day he let him buy a pillar of cloud and those were the two exact photos he took for the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days to lead her down the right path and what was the path the message of the hour what that may have preached amen was going to lead us into a Rapture and when he went beyond the court of time we all said we're resting on that [Applause] and that's why I'm a message believer that's why just like Rahab here Rahab didn't have to see all the Miracles something in her witnessed what she was hearing was the truth something in her that she couldn't explain listen she was she she worked around a bunch of people no doubt those people looked at Jericho go say we don't got to worry about those bunch of slaves down there how do they gonna tear down this wall it's too big there ain't no way they can do it oh I'll tell you what God likes a challenge sometimes [Applause] God likes a challenge sometimes amen because we know what happens in a few chapters later Joshua calls or I'm sorry God called for the captain of his salvation decided that it is time to go to war with Jericho part of the reason why he has to go to war right is because of the predestinated seat in there and that predestinated seed was trapped in that wall oh you ever been there before I've been trapped in walls before too I've been trapped in my delusions and my and my you know you know you know those mind battles you get where you cross ten Bridges and you haven't been down there yet but you you went this and this and this and now you're depressed because of this over here you're not even there right it hasn't even happened and you're depressed about something that is that might happen over there you know oh you sit there and you'll just go uh Lord you know I'm gonna mess up tomorrow you know if I do I'm gonna mess up tomorrow you're already you're already getting depressed about your sins you haven't done yet but that's what the devil likes to do it so Tom Right make up walls tries to bring up walls and so God said you know what I'm tired of these walls hoping holding my predestinated seed I tell you what I thank God he does this amen he doesn't even base it necessarily on you sometimes does he because if you had your way sometimes you'd be like me trying to get yourself in trouble Hey man trying to bring the judgments of God upon yourself God don't play those games amen he's got a bigger picture in mind amen he wants a relationship with you and he wants you closer to him just stop trusting so much in yourself and start trusting in what God Said Hallelujah think how crazy Ray have with that rope out of her window people making fun of her fort she's like who cares oh can I preach now who cares what those people say about your token but as if you know sometimes we believe more in people what they say about our token that people actually got it so what if they make fun of you like they know what they're talking about oh can I I give you I'll give you a story one time I worked at the elevator I worked at an elevator one time and uh they knew I was a Christian and because I let him know and so forth became up Stephen we heard we heard something a story in the Bible oh did you I was first shocked they even read the thing you know I was I worked at elevator so these were Farmer Boys you know country boys or whatever they said we heard there's polygamy in the Bible see when we heard there's polygamy in the Bible Stephen you believe in polygamy I mean there's polygamy in the Bible Stephen so I stopped her I said really there's polygamy in the Bible I said where they go well we don't know I said then shut up you know like get out of here then don't come up with me stuff you have no clue what you're talking about you see what I'm saying they need they didn't read it they even know they just had somebody tell them about it and try to throw me under the bus I'm gonna let them throw me on the bus I know where I stand I know what I have believed that's what you need to do is you so you stuck in those walls this morning don't worry God's gonna send a Joshua to get you out God commissioned Joshua to get you out of some walls and what did he do amen he brought a bunch of Men of War but he didn't take a single hammer to that wall did he know what he did they started blowing some trumpets amen I'll tell you what sometimes we do it the wrong way sometimes you know what I mean sometimes when we got walls we try to take a hammer in our children try to bring down the wall hey man if we would just believe on God and saw praising what he said you might get a little farther right man I think I said this last time it's not called thinking word it's called spoken word so quit thinking about what God Said and put it on your lips and say it and start trumpeting it forth amen are you healed yes sir I'm Healed by your stripes I'm Healed I don't feel any better so what his word said I'm Healed I don't care about these walls amen he said I'm Healed Glory the car Hallelujah I don't care how high these walls are amen if he said I'm Healed it doesn't matter if it's cancer uh leukemia and so forth God said I'm Healed and start trumpeting it forth now watch this here Joshua 6 verse 11. we got to get going but I tell you why I'm feeling good right now so uh buckle up let's keep going amen Joshua 6 watch us here this is this is them going to start going around the city and so forth as God commissioned them to do Watch what it says here I think it's so amazing Joshua 6 verse 11. so the Ark of the Lord come past the city going about it once and they came into the camp enlarged to the camp Now isn't that something they're here to take out those walls and God tells them go around once then don't go around again so they take the ark they take the trumpets they take the men of War go around once and then they go in the camp I mean there's 23 more hours left in the day what else are they gonna do you want to mean they're out here to take Jericho out and what are they doing they're resting in a camp you know can I I hope I hope you're hearing me sometimes we always think we got to be doing doing doing doing doing did you do the word amen then rest in that what if they would around what if they would have went around the city again here they would have broke the plan of God what does the Bible say wait on the Lord and He will renew your strength amen sometimes you need to stop for a second can I say it like this chill out chill out all right can I say this watch okay you ready for this it's gonna be shocker you're really on okay you're okay nothing's out of cater you know about everyone said that right nothing's out of cater God's in control God's always been in control oh you say but life's been really rough I know life's been rough don't worry you're okay you're still here aren't you yeah you're still here aren't you you're here hearing the word right now who put you here amen God did hey man God put you here God put you in this age in this very service for a reason maybe it doesn't let you know hey have you done the word have you done the word did you repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost what did Brother Ram said the entire Christian experience is rest do you know that so shook up brother Brandon brother Bram said he woke up his wife to tell her that he was so surprised by that Revelation he couldn't even hold it in he had to wake up his wife in the middle of the night and tell her about it I wonder how much important it is to you that you know chill out you really are okay God's in your corner God's taking care of you yeah Rahab was in that wall she was in her situations but she could look at the token amen and no she's okay thank you Lord see that maybe that's what we need to do this morning right go look at your token for a second you got the holy ghost or not you say brother Stephen I don't know I would figure that out right now I wouldn't even wait till I'm done talking this morning to figure out whether you got the holy ghost or not you say brother Stephen it's got to be a little hard is it really that hard do you do the word amen can I say this I think I said this last time my goodness here we are amen God can talk so I can talk to you if you got a question of whether you got the holy ghost or not figure it out oh I don't know here we are church I hope you want to come with me any man you say brother Stephen I have the Holy Ghost for 35 years I'm so happy to hear that have you had it for 35 in one day what does the Bible say make your calling an election sure brother Ram said all who are not under the token perished brother brand was so shook up by that he said in when he first preached the token he said I got loved ones in here I got family in here and he said if they're not under the token they don't make it you hear me Church Rahab had enough sense in her to know she needed a true token she needed a true token and she laid it out that window loud and proud remember when those children of Israel walked by what did Joshua always see when they walked around the first what do you see oh saw the token up in the window he knew Rahab was over there there's the token they would go around the city one time for six days what an invasion what a what a time to take out Jericho hey man oh I tell you what sometimes we we come up with our minds on how to take out our problems amen just lean on him he's going to make you do things that sound foolish sometimes don't worry about that so much worry about whether it's God's word or not hey man and then on the seventh day what do they do they go around seven times don't they right we got a lot of types in that like for instance I think it's each time was one seal being opened right but then on the seventh seal on the seventh day what happened all seals were revealed amen and God went back and revealed them all in the last Church age if you will amen One Church AIDS two Church AIDS we're on the seven Church age what did that seven Church age mentioned to do it revealed the seven Church ages and when they went around seven times Joshua tells them here in um there it is Joshua 6 verse 16. and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpets Joshua said on the people shout for the Lord has given you the land you serious I ain't making anything up am I sometimes you gotta pipe up sometimes you got to shout say the word yourself amen watch what Joshua says here remember Joshua's Jehovah's salvation in verse 17 and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are there into the Lord only Rahab the heart that shall live and all that are with her in her house because she hid the message Hallelujah she hid the message that we set isn't that something yeah and they just random while we call this the message amen we got some rahabs in here right man who have hid the message yes the walls are coming down this world will be destroyed only the bride shall live [Applause] that'll get you isn't this amazing Joshua never met Rahab up to this point but Joshua knew her name before she knew met him oh ain't that something God knew you before you met him amen and the walls came down didn't they you know they even done the historical things you know what happened to those walls I saw I read some stuff on the internet of the archeology the walls didn't just crumble in they crumbled out do you know why because when the walls crumbled out it made a little ramp for them to walk in God literally invited them into the city to take over see I think sometimes can I preach we working too much they didn't even have to make a ramp to get in the city God made a form already too [Applause] they didn't have to worry about taking hammers to Chisel the wall down they just did what God Said worshiped God in the word and God took care of the rest even for Rahab here hallelujah even for Rahab she pulled a token what she needed out of them and that token was so powerful that when the judgments of God came it held up her wall amen Joshua 6 24. and they burnt the city with fire and all the other end only the silver and the gold and the vessels of Braxton of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord and Joshua saved Rahab the Heartland alive and her father's household and all that she had and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day why because she was better than everybody else because she hid the message which Joshua sent to spy how Jericho got a Rahab in here amen if she was able to pull out that token to save her household how much more with you with the promise as I invite the musicians up let me read this quote to you Billy Graham said in the token that very first quote yep that one right there no it's not that one I'm sorry it's 640208 paragraph 98. they might have thought the big thing they lived in that big system that was going to save them talking about Jericho thinking Jericho was going to save them but we found out everything that didn't show that token perished in that City so will it be at the coming of the son of man he has done said so there must have been some of them tape boys or somebody slipping to that place down there and play some tapes to them I'm one of those little I'm one of that Rahab some of those tapes I listen can I be real with you I still remember the first tape I listened to it was the 62 Super sign 0618 super sign and I remember I was driving my little Ford Focus driving to the driving to work at a metal Factory my brother Ram starts going down a little testimony you don't mind if I share it with you it's one of my favorite testimonies about that baby who got raised in Mexico and the papers interview them the next day do you believe our Saints could raise the dead too and he said you can't be a saint unless you're dead so how can a dead Saint raise up a dead baby if they're dead so the man asked brother banham what do you think of the Catholic church and he goes I'm sorry you asked me that do I have to answer you said like to hear he said it's the highest form of spiritualism there is true that man said what do you mean he said well you all these gods and goddesses that you worship he said they're dead he's not why Mr Branham Christ is oh you worship Christ and he died he said but he raised again on the third day and he's alive now amen ain't that awesome well guess what the the uh the one month old message believer thought it was awesome too because I was driving in my Ford Focus when I heard that and I just started having a shot with fit and said glory to God I'm all over the road that night sometimes God's gonna make you do some funny things but you know what I didn't get no wreck why I was worshiping the Lord of course I'm not gonna get no wreck you ever see one of those big farmer floaters um you ever see those farm equipment with the three wheels and they got big old wide tires I used to drive one of those for an elevator and I was driving on it one day and I was playing brother Branham in the tape and I don't remember what he said but he said something so powerful the spirit of God came into my cab there I started speaking in tongues and shouting all sorts of different things I blanked out for like 10 seconds I really did I was here and then all of a sudden I was at the stop sign stopped I don't remember stopping I believe I was shouting like them in Jericho amen I wasn't worried about the walls or how I was going to bring it down I was just in the word worshiping the Lord I said can I say I said why don't you get a little into the spirit sometimes don't worry about all figuring everything out just get in the spirit a little bit and allow the Holy Ghost to wash over you listen all those problems are going to be waiting for you there let's just leave it out there at this time let's give God some worship and just get in the spirit what do you say
