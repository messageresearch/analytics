his way forward and uh there's some things to just share with you also remember i told you on thursday here um sister sister linda sister linda cavillo cavillo my my aunt she's been going home on june 17th god is good and i think i don't know to the exact day but that's very close to six months that she's been from that double lung transplant in the hospital and then she just had went last last friday she just had went to rehab and they didn't know how long that was going to be but because of her strength or the strength that she has in doing everything they went ahead and announced to her you're going home on the 17th i tell you what that's just an effect of the presence of god amen that's a testimony it's a miracle and um i know that it's been truly the prayers of the saints amen it's nothing less than a miracle amen just hearing the testimony also sister miranda here on on thursday as well and i know there's other testimonies but these testimonies right now just so stand out to me even more so because sometimes there's things that doesn't always happen instantaneous like that sometimes it's it's a journey but nonetheless it's still faith it's still faith so we just brother aaron if you'll come this morning just want to give you a quick update on the the project gonna be taking place out here uh lord willing that will be starting tomorrow and uh it'll be a blessing to have that done uh that portion of the project it's gonna look a little bit different here the next time we we return um whether it be thursday or sunday just keep an eye on your email or facebook or whatever if there's some issues or whatever in the week with weather we may have to may have to cancel service thursday we're not real sure but if need be some extra time is needed i believe it's going to be taken three days so monday tuesday lord willing should be complete by wednesday but if by chance it's not then obviously uh we may need to cancel the service thursday and then uh we should have a beautiful sidewalk an entryway come sunday uh it's pretty exciting i just wanna i wanna thank all of you for uh your generosity and during this time and being able to make projects like this happen and not only for us but for visitors as well you know it'll make it easier for exiting out the door with those that have walkers wheelchairs things like that it'll definitely be more accommodating just an update as the as of the last time we took the offering for the project we were actually at 11 104 so that is that's outstanding a group this size i mean it's i think it's wonderful and uh i believe the lord can multiply that as well and i guess at this point that's about really all i have for you but uh just being prayer about it that everything goes well and and it'll be a blessing for sure [Applause] [Music] it's exciting and [Music] i just wanted you to just just keep it in prayer and you've seen some of the the markings there on the sidewalk and the different things and it's just kind of not only let us know but there's things that is also marked out for those that's doing the work too and so let's just go before the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father as we just come before you once again this morning lord i just want to say it's a privilege lord to be gathered together in your presence lord with brothers and sisters of like precious faith lord jesus we thank you o god lord for all things that lord you have provided for us oh god lord even as we lord lifting this offering this morning oh god as our brother had mentioned it's very true lord father we just thank you god for moving lord upon our hearts and our lives and lord just just lord how you provided oh god for yourself lord we ask that lord you'll just bless lord god your children once again lord that you'll just lord taking of it lord just multiplying it oh god and directing it even as the project lord would hear just moving forward lord things beginning we ask that god that you'll just guide and direct those that are doing it lord father i ask lord just like if i was going to a surgeon to have a surgery lord it might be a very noted person lord they may have many accolades and that's that's wonderful but i want you to be present lord and father we're asking o god that you'll give direction lord and wisdom lord to these men oh god as they begin to move lord going upon these things lord we pray lord we we trust you and we look to you oh god now we ask that lord you'll just be with us in the remaining part of this service oh god just take your word and just speak to our hearts in a special way we pray in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you amen has you given to the lord but some of you playing something yes [Music] oh have your way [Music] and holy spirit [Music] oh lord come fill our hearts yes lord jesus [Music] as we wait on you and lord we pray come speak to our hearts [Music] and have your way hallelujah amen if you'd like to stand with me this morning we'd like to go into the scriptures to the book of zechariah i'd like to read in zechariah chapter 4 this morning just a little further thought some of the things we've just been looking at with faith say it's good to have the visitors here with us god bless you let's see sister linda mr angie and different ones god bless you amen mr mary bell god bless you good to have you here with us too i get in trouble when i start calling names because if i overlook someone it's very easy to do that even here with times i have to ask the deacons and say did you see brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so because everything's on a level they can hide behind somebody but it's good to see each and every one of you amen it's good to be together in it amen zechariah chapter 4 and verse 1 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep now he wasn't sleeping but he's letting us know the angel came and he waked me and he waked me as a man that is awakened out of his sleep and he said to me what seest thou i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a ball upon the top of it and his seven lamps they're on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one upon the right side side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest not what these be i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated didn't mean to have you setting standing up and down maybe you'll be able to say you got your exercise for the day but we've been looking at a thought here god has just been moving in our lives and just speaking to us here about the pursuit of your need and we all are gathered here because we do have needs and yet we've come here because there's also the purpose that we have in coming to the house of god and that's to hear from god there's a we're not just coming here to fulfill a duty we're not come here just to fulfill a time we don't come here just to say well i've done my religious duty of the week there's a greater there's a greater reason that we're coming together here there's lives to be touched delivered saved filled with the holy ghost and there's lives within all of that also questions to be answered directions to be ministered to discernment of of our hearts and how god would just come in in a very special way that that were steps that continued to be made in a forward direction and as we were looking at that last week of how that even when jairus started out and it was faith that drove him when hearing of of the lord jesus was present he moved to that place to knowing that jesus was presented bro it it it caused him to go beyond every fear or doubt or question that was there of what will happen you know if i go on and i go after the lord jesus as ruler of the synagogue when that need arose with his daughter that need took precedence over every other thought and he moved out and yet whom we know even when he moved out they came to a place and they told him and said when his daughter had passed why don't trouble the master any any further your daughter's dead but the lord jesus heard that and he spoke to jairus jairus didn't even turn to him but the lord jesus heard it and he encouraged him he strengthened the faith that was already there for that need letting it be known to jairus but i believe it's greater for you and i that when god has put upon our heart there's a need that no matter what circumstance or situation arises it was god who placed that need upon our heart and before we could ever have a need he already is the answer for that need so between here and there like we were looking at that that statement or that quote out of life is the healer between here and there what takes place the angel of the lord moving from the circumstance of where like that little blind boy who entered the prayer line and then standing over here his eyes are completely made whoa whole and it was between as brother ram said between the here and there the angel of the lord was present others could not understand what happened between here and there and brother braham kept working with that phrase in life as the healer as he's there in the discernment and i think it's very fitting for our lives and our walk in a walk of faith that when we recognize that we're we're starting and even as god deals with our life no matter where you're at in your journey there is a between here and there you might have a physical need in your body there's a between here and there you might receive news from a doctor and the doctor says this or whatever more well we we don't say well you know uh you know i i'm not i'm just going to tune that out but what we recognize is is that this is a presentation of the walls of jericho and however they're going to come down they're coming down that's how we approach because the promise of god is certain listen if we never experience sickness or we're never going to experience it there would be no need for him to bear the stripes and to provide healing for you and i but i want you to remember i want to remind us here this morning that satan's desire would be to so to try to minimize even divine healing in the body that abraham remember in the sacrifice when those when he made the sacrifice and god was confirming the covenant there was that of the vultures that came down there in the evening time but abraham stood there and he shooed away the vultures he would not let them come to the sacrifice and that's the way the children of god are in this hour there's nothing that we are going to permit the enemy to take one promise from us i don't care how bleak it looks how dark it looks or what the situation might be like god is still god it's in the darkest times where he unfolds and makes the greatness of his glory to be made known and so when we're looking at this thought i i'd say all that with this part of it that i want to speak here this morning on a thought awakening the sixth sense awakening the sixth sense i i just will skip over some scriptures here at the beginning that you realize that paul would speak to the people of god in that hour to recognize where they are at in time even then and i believe it's so much more fitting for us and he says it's time that we awake it's time that we wake up because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed so the when we think of this here with this awakening just a little background of where we're going brother branham in the message faith is the sixth sense he's he gives many different testimonies and he's in prayer and i'm reading here from a prayer and he's he's saying our heavenly father the sixth sense these testimonies from the bible that the sixth sense as i call it faith and he begins to rehearse hebrews 11 and he says how that they subdued kingdoms and stopped lions and escaped the edge of the sword enoch was translated into heaven by the sixth sense abraham sojourned in a strange land and received a son after he was a hundred years old and sarah's womb was dead he considered not those things he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving glory to god he knowed god made the promise and god he was fully persuaded would keep what he promised brother braham says this oh god we're supposed to be the children of abraham what a poor excuse we are oh god wake up the sixth sense in this church amongst the people tonight and because we can see that great sign to abraham there that taken place god i pray that they'll see the angel of the lord's presence tonight and will not rely upon their feeling or upon their sight but upon the word of god that made the promise now let me just pause here for a moment he's identifying the time that we are living in right now that god made a promise that he would he would visit he would visit here the the gentile church at the end of the dispensation and what he did back there in genesis 18 he did it here when he came and was revealed as the son of man and now that same son of man he came through a prophetic ministry and revealed or making himself known that's what the message is the unfolding of jesus christ now that same angel of the lord is present in a body of believers that's why brother could say i charge you to believe that the son of man is manifest in the body of the bride because it was there in a son of man now it is revealed in the body of believers so there is whole think of it now the whole coming of of the word of the angel of the lord of the holy spirit coming in that in that manner is to raise our faith in the word of god now notice when they would see the angel of the lord's presence tonight they would not rely upon their feeling upon their sight but upon the word of god that made the promise and every person in here would be healed and everyone that's unsaved will be saved and all without the holy ghost will receive it you see anything that we receive from god it comes because faith is present and pray faith has been awakened and activated in him who is made the promise is here to fulfill it now notice in in the in his making himself known in his appearing the the purpose that god would come as he would even come through this service and as he's come in previous services is that when we when when everything is said and done here if after this service we are not walking back out of here and like as though that we have a bag that we uh well i set my bag of my feelings out there and when i get out of service oh brothers where did you put my bag of feelings at where did you put my bag of sight my bag of hearing you know because i just i was i just laid down my bag i'm ready to take my baggage back up but the reason that we have come and the reason he comes and speaks to our hearts is that there's no more baggage that we're going to carry out of here it's to realize that god is present when god anoints a man and that man begins to speak under the inspiration and the discernment of the holy spirit we don't want to reason with it we just want to accept it and let the baggage be gone and say lord my faith is standing there upon the word of god that man don't know me or maybe the man does but it's god who speaks to your heart if we're in an atmosphere where the holy spirit is present to move upon our lives i think it's quite a paradox how that god will take within a service and guide and direct and and lead and speak to hearts and lives and discerning hearts and ministering to such uh a vast amount of needs within that service as a matter of fact he'll he's here to minister to every single heart and every single need what it depends on is whether or not that will receive it but i would say here this morning and today i would say god let me be so awakened to your presence let me be so awakened to that lord let let faith be so awakened and activated you know there's a there's a scripture in in the book of luke and uh you know just just trying to watch my my time here there was um a parable that's given and in luke 18 1 the the lord jesus said men ought always to pray and not to faint that's a powerful statement to faint means to grow weak to grow weary all right let's just put it in layman's terms i don't see anything i don't see any effect from my prayers i don't see anything happening now we had a choice either we're going to go about what we don't feel well i don't feel any different or i don't see things any different now let me just say this to you jesus said either by our words will be condemned or will be justified is that right it's powerful your testimony and your confession is very important he's the high priest of our confession brother brahman said the moment you start looking around he said and then he said you even make a statement well i don't have very good faith i don't have my faith's not that strong he said the moment that you start doing that that's when it starts trickling out and he said at that moment that's when you're talking the devil's language brother graham goes on many quotes we could pull out of this one he says i don't care how strong a person is how strong and solid they are in their christian faith if something was to get a hold of you and say i'm not a christian no more he said you watch from that moment and you utter it out watch from that moment that life will start going down now we understand there's degrees there's there's where the holy spirit begins to deal with the life and justification and sanctification and my the working of the holy spirit can be it's so great within those measures and we understand that with the seal of the living god once a life has been sealed there is no going back because there's nothing to go back to are you hearing me now but it comes down if we can just apply it in this broad parent's principle you or i as the bible could say many things regarding our speech and our tongue it said power and life and death is in the power of the tongue the greatest thing we can do is when we are feeling discouraged is to take it to god in prayer but don't pick it up when you take it there are you hearing me friends don't pick it up when you take it there and this is this is the reality that the lord jesus is ministering here uh regarding this situation of how there was a judge let me just preach from the scripture here he was a judge and he's an unjust judge but there was a woman that had a need she stayed on his doorstep she kept knocking on his door in other words she was on his hands and she wasn't gonna get off his hands unless her need was met what do you call that that's called faith she was turned down turned down but she stood right there why did she stay right there because she knew he's the one that can minister to my need the trouble i've got he's the one that can take care of it that's what faith is well i'm just going to preach sometimes in this with push button age where we're in and everything is well come on you know everything's got to be instant and if it's not instant that's not faith no faith itself is a settled reality in the living god even when you're approaching god for a promise that's what brother brahma said if you're coming up here to receive the holy ghost and you say well i don't know i might receive it he said just stay in your seat because you ain't gonna get nothing you've got to approach god with the real faith every promise of god these are things that when we look around here with this widow woman and i i want to get to that place how god moves and and energizes our faith and this is why when the lord jesus could say of this setting in luke 18 7 and shall not god avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear long with them what's he letting you and i know that there's no prayer when it's according to the will of god ever goes unanswered are you hearing me now every prayer this is why when brother branham could be baptizing people right there and he said oh god let their mama look over the banister of time let their mama see all the prayers that was prayed let her see it being answered we're living in an hour where the lamb has come and taken the book we're living in a time as revelations 8 1 would speak at the opening of the seventh seal there was given a golden censor that was full of the prayers of the saints you know what they've been praying about they've been praying about the finishing up of redemption and what was god doing god was stockpiling those prayers and saying i've heard those prayers but i can't answer them yet until that last name that is on the book has been sealed away so just because that we're not seeing anything at that moment that had nothing to do with faith but it's the objective that we would grow weary we would grow faint this is why we've got to have a greater source than our site we've got to have a greater source than any of our senses we've got to have a greater source than a twitter page or facebook or whatever you got to have a greater source amen an unseen source on the presence of the living god that will give you strength that when it doesn't your feelings will say things to you you've got to have a faith that goes beyond your feelings and i'm saying that it's not god is not saying it to condemn us it's god speaking that we would be awakened to where we are limiting god it isn't that well lord i'm just waiting on you sometimes sometimes it's god is waiting on us he wakened me as a man that was waking out of sleep what does what does thou see and he begins to describe that of the menorah which is a type all of those channels being fed by that oil and the fire on top it was a type of the life of the believer that our lives were meant to be channels it's not us doing the work but it's god doing it through us but we must be yielded to him nevertheless he said when the son of man cometh this is a very uh uh a tremendous question shall he find faith on the earth that's in this hour he didn't ask the question as you hear brother braham say it over and over will he find churches will he find schools will he find no he asked will he find faith god has promised that in this hour sending the ministry of malachi 4 was to restore the original bible faith how how can the original bible faith be restored by the original bible holy ghost not a portion but christ in his fullness so god god don't forget any prayer so you can just you can just you know put that right in the devil's face everything that's praying now sometimes we pray for things and we're not getting it and we get frustrated because we want to see it happen this way i mean if it was up to us we'd have been telling we would have been telling the the captain of the lord's hosts that ain't the way we're going to do it we ain't going around there seven times i don't even make sense uh it don't make sense to go around that way you know they're not logical when has there ever been anybody that's done that and you know we look at things sometimes and the reason we get so trapped in our senses instead of waiting on god the greatest thing we can do is what joshua did when god revealed himself joshua bowed his head upon the earth and worshiped and this is what he said powerful words what would you have thy servant do he recognized his position in the presence of the mighty angel oh may god help us this morning that we can recognize our position when god comes to minister to our need that it's not how i'm i'm looking at it in my mind you know brother branham as it comes to me now brother brahm talks about he says many times he said we'll go around and we pray and then we say that god didn't answer our prayer and he said the reality of it is he said his god didn't answer it the way that we had it figured out or that it had to come come home we're talking about talking to that of believers it doesn't always happen the way that it that that we look for things to happen but nonetheless faith is just setting its sights on the lord now god has given us census here five senses in our earthly body and those five senses are given to contact our earthly home and we thank god for them we all we want them to be dedicated to the lord see taste feel smell and hear and god has given us five spiritual senses that control the spirit our imagination conscience memory reason and affections and and we thank god for all that too because we realize friends that these things are not given to be an enemy but if you remember when nehemiah was brought back after they had after the temple had been built now the coming of the building of the walls when they returned from babylon he never changed the positions of the gate the fish gate remained in its position the sheep gate remained in its position but he repaired those gates and he put locks and bars he put what needed to be put upon them and that's the way the holy spirit does when it sets down in the midst of our life he doesn't do away with those other channels but now they are brought subject to a son and daughter of god on the inside is that right that's why brother baby could tell us he said if our reason re if our reasoning reasons with the word he said then it's of god but if it reasons against it that very moment we turn it out and we tell we stay on the word now faith itself it was given it was given to us to the human race that we could contact our heavenly father it's greater than all these other senses as a matter of fact brother branham would say it in this way that faith delivers us and rescues us from our five senses that we were put here in the beginning it delivers us and rescues us from these five senses because you know many times he says we we we we are this this census he said those six senses they become dormant and and they don't act at all he's talking about how things can become so dormant and he's identifying at that time of where the church was at he said that the church they've done the same thing to the sixth sense of god in other words binding it off and putting it way out there instead of bringing the reality that god has given that sense of faith to the church of the living god and that there's there's only one way that you and i can ever obtain any promise of god and that's by faith is that right so in in every and everything that we look at it's like you know when you take the senses of of a person and brother brown is going into it of where they say to that individual well you know i've done every doctor says i've done everything i can do uh there's nothing else that i can do i've done this treatment and you went and seen this doctor and now after seeing this doctrine they go to the doc every one of them are saying there's nothing else that can be done and but yet that's the time brother brown said that's the time to call on the sixth sense that's the time to accept god that's to rely upon the spirit of faith that god has put in you oh he says there's so many times that we we depend too much on our five senses and we can say amen throughout this building surely there's too many times that we depend upon our five senses and god with his word bringing his word is trying to bring that deliverance to our lives that we're even though things can be around us look there's things going to stand in front of us as far as sight that you can't look at them and say they ain't there josh when caleb didn't walk over in the land and say you guys are a bunch of liars there ain't giants over there joshua and caleb said there's giants all right but we got a great big god i made a great big promise are you hearing me now yeah i hear this report but i got a greater report than that doctor's report when they stood before the red sea remember them people were all looking back and they seen pharaoh's army coming after what were they looking through their natural eyes what they could hear the trembling they felt the trembling of the ground all their reasoning is is boy we're gonna get it now but notice what god given leadership in that moment how god comes down and he speaks there to moses and moses anointed by the spirit of god he speaks out and prophesies that those egyptians that you see today you will see no more stand still and see the salvation of the lord what's he doing we need to direct our natural side and get away from that and be focused on the god who made the promise he did not bring us this far to leave us but that same god that's brought us this far he'll lead us all the way that's his promised word and anything contrary to that it's a lie that's when we call anything contrary to the promise that's a lie give me a little bit more here because i'm losing it thank you everything contrary it's a lie we're not we're not denying and we're not look past it because you don't get anywhere by ignoring it we are men we are ordained to overcome if the bible did not say blessed are he that ignoreth now there's times we do need to ignore times you do need to ignore what the enemy is saying and override all that but we're not ignoring we're looking at a promise we're looking at maybe a situation whatever it is god has made a promise and that promise is to me god has confirmed his work do you realize what the baptism of the holy ghost is it's a confirmation in your heart and life that god has seen and recognized your faith and you've got a right to stand there with every promise of god no matter what comes your way you have already the answer it lays inside of you where you can look at the word and you can say well i don't feel nothing i don't see any faith but there's already been the greatest confirmation and that's god revealing himself to you personally hallelujah if god's on our side tell me who who might show up in a lot of watts right devil can show up as cancer devil can show up as this a devil but but notice we're recognizing not what we see here but it's on but there is a spiritual power that's behind it and god is greater than every demon-inspired thing that would want to try to come my way oh my my oh my think of it now you know this this spiritual this this sixth sense but the man would say oh if we could just if we could just tap in we would bypass so many things and we would bypass so many things within our lives let me just stop it doesn't mean you're gonna we're gonna bypass trials it don't win because you can't trials listen trials and tests are ordained of god it is the perfecting the perfecting of our lives it is it is the tool in the in that god is permitted to protect to mold and shape our lives but you see when we're not walking by faith are you with me now when we're really not walking and in tuning in step with god there can be a lot of other things we can get entangled in and say oh i'm in a great big trout and it ain't even a trial it's just a poor decision we made somebody preach with me now the devil got blamed for a lot of stuff and he's sitting on the corner i didn't even do that i didn't even do that and here i am getting credit for all this faith is a master of every circumstance you can put anything you want on that list of circumstance and listen we're not minimizing circumstances what we're trying to say is that faith masters every circumstance faith does not do away with the circumstance but it gives you strength to go through it this is why paul and over and over in the scriptures we walk by faith and we don't walk by sight faith is the substance of things hoped for it's it's real it's the evidence of things that's not seen because it was by it in verse 2 that the elders obtained a good report by faith they did this through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which were seen were not made of things which do appear in verse 6 of hebrews 11 i know these are familiar scriptures to us but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that do what diligently seek him not half-heartedly not well i don't know maybe it might be or i've tried or i've known so so it got to be diligently seeking after him everything else is is laid aside let me just i just have to go as he brings does he bring in different things to me to leave the notes here for a moment brother graham talked about a man um brother sharon i believe it was and brother share it he knew brother branham real well i mean when you can go and call and have dinner with him you know him pretty well and oral roberts he knew oral roberts that way and and and and brother sherrod had had a had a need in his body and the the doctors you know it was with the kidneys and the doctors had said well you know we're going to have to do something about this and brother sharon he went and he said well i'm just going to i'll call oral and brother oral we'll have dinner together and ask him to pray for me and that'll be it so he called brother oral up they had dinner brother prayed for him it relieved a little bit and then hear it it coming back now i know what you might be thinking you might be thinking well his faith should have kept it away well let's listen to the rest of the story so here he says i need to have an appointment with brother branham we i need to have have a time with him and so brother brother sherrod sat down with brother branham brother bramy said i don't see anything to hindering it he prayed for him he got better and then here it came back again finally they had they're going to have to do the surgery on his kidney and brother sharon he come to that place he said i just you know i just have to have it done he got to laying on his back and as he was laying there he began to think about the lord and his goodness and he said lord you know i love you brother brandon said the testimony they did the surgery but the testimony he said such an atmosphere filled that room he said to even the surgeons had to testify about it he said what was it he said because his confidence is if he got with brother oral or his confidence if he had got with me he said it had to come back to that first principle i love the lord [Music] remember faith worketh by love is that right oh my i love how god takes things sometimes and like we've got it all figured out and god said let me just scramble it up a little bit because you don't have it all figured out god loves to make himself known to you and i the bible would tell us faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word of god you see anything that our sense our senses can declare it's no more faith it's no more faith but we first must believe this is god's word and you must come to god by his word just like abraham abraham the voice of god spoke to abraham and abraham began his journey out of babylon into the land of promise you know what he had to do he had to follow the voice he didn't have he did not see that land he wasn't partaking of that land as far as eating anything of it but the voice had spoke to him and there was something it caught a hold inside of him by predestination it found a betting ground to where here abraham began to walk and follow that voice it was a faith that it began to paul say it did not that faith itself is not or the faith that we saw in genesis 22 when he takes isaac up to offer the ram it doesn't look the same as when it starts out but if it only as it will obey the voice that faith that was in there will mature to that place just say this here because i can't get in and lay all this in this morning but every person has faith within them because you couldn't even believe god he that cometh to god must first believe that he is god it's got to be already a part that god has put in to even when the word is preached something begins to stir up but you see the whole purpose is is god stirring up that faith to where then where the baptism of the holy ghost comes in that's god's faith and then god's faith sets down in the middle of our faith and influences our faith and i wish i could just preach on that right now that's what we are getting to but you know to understand that there are things of how when we look at things it's just you know this faith is just as real as any sense within our body actions will our actions will declare it and it comes to us this substance it comes to us by hearing the word of god and that only so that puts it back to where faith faith is not as brother brown would say in some individual it's not in a man it's not an organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word and your faith is in god then what god's word is said is true and let every other man's word be a lie oh my now i want you to look at this here and we know the parable of the four different types of ground where speaking of the sowing of the word and i just want to focus upon that of the good ground brother branham would call this the good ground you recognize as even as that would continue to as it continued to unfold always predestination lay there because predestination is a reality of the scriptures anything less than that it becomes your own perseverance brother samuel you mean to tell me that you don't have to do anything no because you are predestinated there is that already that seed laying within you brother branham called it the pre-prepared ground it was already prepared by god what was he prepared for in works as faith expressed he said god has prepared you to recognize and receive him in this generation jacob was predestinated but he still had to wrestle it out with the angel of the lord esau didn't want it esau didn't see it was necessary he saw said my daddy's a prophet i mean i've been raised around this message i've been this and that you see there was if everything there wasn't anything that was sparking within esau esau was willing to sell the birthright the privilege the opportunity for a mess of college you realize that's what the lady will see in church did they sold the birthright that was among them and they put christ on the outside of the church they esteemed their programs they esteemed all that greater than jesus christ come on now let's not leave it out there let's bring it right down here we can put him right out if we begin to esteem or i'll do this or i know this about the message or i'm a pretty good guy or we become so involved and wrapped up in the carnal things of life it's the same way with church programs but brother and sister if we ever make the grave and we make the rapture it's because of a life that is faith in god's word where he is first [Applause] and when he's first remember it's evidence you can say it but your actions declare your evidence are you hearing me now so if actions are contrary then what you're saying then the thing to do is say god i need to get synchronized and get lined up because what i'm saying here my life is telling a different story oh lord jesus they're talking about some good ground now now let me just lay this down here just for a few moments in mark chapter four i'm just gonna read two places where the lord jesus talks about good ground good ground he said in mark 4 20 is such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit so they hear the word now remember a person can hear it and still remain the same is that right they can hear it and they was they're just as much a drunkard as they ever were maybe there's some things that get cleaned up in their life but they don't they don't understand they don't recognize our real understanding is a transformation are you with me oh there in satan's eating brother man said you know he said but a person who hears he that heareth my word and believeth on me he said to believe is to understand and when a person understands he said they're no longer the same i'm not talking about understanding that we know the doctrines of the message or i can finish this quote i can finish this chapter and i know all that that's not understanding but understanding is to recognize him and our need of him oh brother and sister you can come to this church or any church you can come to it for 50 years and 60 years 70 years however long it is but until you say god open up that channel of hearing and really receive the word to receive it is submit and surrender your lives to it and to recognize i'm no good without jesus christ i can't do it without him i need his life inside of me we're not come to church for a hypo shock to feel good and man i feel a little good we're here to be changed if there's something out of life we're here that'll be lined up and has brother branham could stand there in the message supersense and ask the congregation how many would want more of that super sense he said god i want more of it lord i want it to have more preeminence in my life [Applause] well well well luke 18 luke 8 15 the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart you know what that speaks of get everything when the word is coming forth it's a dissolver of doubts if it's an unconfessed sin let's get it out because the holy ghost faith can't work where it's unconfessed sin if there's something in the way see a good and on it what is the good and honest heart when the word is coming forth the word is being ministered friends where our lives will align with that word oh god help us having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience and i love how all of these descriptives it goes on in good good ground good ground you take it and you keep it you live it it's it's substance to you and with patience you bring forth fruit fruit doesn't come out overnight but fruit comes through many trials there are many tests it's a patience our walk with god is trusting him and waiting on him faith comes we've got to be able to receive the word of god i want you to watch this with god's grace brother brahman said you know a person can preach the word explain the word but we have to receive the word open up our lives and our channels say god i want to receive from you i believe i believe even services would be even you say brother sam you mean it can go higher oh yeah there's always we can always go higher with god and let's just be honest if we we would really come with that intention that when we're coming to the house of god we're really praying over coming are you hearing me now we're looking we're praying and we're we're staying in a tune and a fellowship god i need to hear from you lord i need you to speak to me lord this is why brother ramsey told us we are to pray for revelation more than anything it's so important to our lives that god would reveal himself god take the man of god you know the needs that's present lord i have needs but there might be something that that that you are seeing that is beyond what i'm seeing lord and father that you will come by our way and speak to us you see when we receive it brother branham here he goes in to explain this when we receive he says that word we receive it the revelation something slips out of the unseen world yonder and comes rolling down through a mystical channel somewhere into your soul that says now i see it your eyes brighten your lips that hung down straighten up and smile every muscle in your body seems to rejoice something's going to happen why that from the unseen realm moved down it came right down into the soul how did it through a yielded life a yielded vessel you can't be yielded if you put god on a time schedule god you've only got this much window to work in you might say brother samuel you're only saying that because you want more time to preach no i'm saying you can't put god on a time schedule well let's preach why we're here oh my we can we can hardly take a two-hour service and yet we'll go sit in a restaurant for an hour and waiting for a special steak to be cooked preach brother samuel i'm going to well what are we doing we're focused more on carnal things and if you wait a few hours that steak will be gone that bread will be gone them onion whatever they are will be gone and you'll have to eat again it's recognizing what are the real real things in life are the eternal things not the things that we see here they fade away but to recognize that we're having an uh an audience in an in time with god that can so affect our lives with problems or whatever that we have or what we'll face we don't know what we're going to face this week i think of brother ray and them the true word tabernacle they didn't know what they were going to face this week when that young young couple went on home to be with the lord but you know they didn't know they were going to face that but god knew it let me tell you how they were prepared to face that god knew it god sent his word and the word had been building over time in hearts and lives it isn't something that happens on a moment right there i thought as i seen brother chuck standing right there and giving you know brother chuck the daddy and seen brother garrett i looked at that and this is the very thing that echoed out of my heart that's what this message produces that's what it produces it is the faith that was once delivered to the saints that when i don't understand what's going on god is still in control he's a great big god he's bigger than my plans he's bigger than my purpose he's greater than the situation before me [Applause] hallelujah oh my i tell you look how now watch how god will do this one way see god comes to stimulate our faith now god doesn't bring it down and say you've got to receive it this way faith coming by hearing and hearing by the word but i want to remember the word's not a letter the word's a person and he's in his body come on now what zechariah saw john saw in revelations 1 he saw him walking in in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is that right so god has many different ways to stimulate faith but it's him that has to stimulate it and it takes us to be able to receive it brett vladimire tells us one way is through the preaching of the gospel and he said you'll have lives and hearts that will receive it through the preaching of the gospel he said then god has gifts in the church tongues and prophecy and on and on he said and that's another way that god will speak then he goes in god has prophets and he goes into those see what it all comes back into is that everything no matter how god comes and he stimulates your faith it isn't that you become dependent on that channel are you hearing me now somebody hear me now it isn't that you become dependent upon that channel it's that you recognize god and he is the word so then now when a situation rises up you're not saying oh sister so-and-so's not here or brother so-and-so's not here you know sometimes god speaks to them or they speak in tongues or or brother samuel's not here but what it is when we recognize him then our faith is positioned in his word that's why brother brown could say he said it with regarding a vision in perfect faith he said every time that he spoke to me it has come to pass he said but i will say this to you this is greater than the vision he wasn't doing away with the vision but what he's bringing us to the purpose of the revealing of the son of man is that the faith of the believers would be built in the word by the word being inside of us right is to recognize him and become united with him that's the marriage of the lamb has come is that right so it's to stimulate our faith now look how brother brahman says it like this in that same quote he said a person sitting in a group of people like this where faith is gathered on every side it'll help you to get well that's powerful where faith is gathered on every side it'll help you to get well i know we always get worried about oh you're gonna do another x-ray on me well i don't i don't know i don't wanna radiation i don't wanna think about it faith faith is greater it's faith in the negative faith don't take things from you faith brings to his presence brings a reality to your life think about it as it would begin to pulsate faith within a building like this you might say brother samuel i'll just sit home and stream why not come here come on now we're not going to be on an island by ourselves on the other side well i'm just getting blessed right here at home but remember we're sitting in a group like this where faith is pulsating now listen that kickback you're not kicking back against me that's against the holy ghost because god ain't altering and changing his word in this hour [Applause] god never oh my god never said forsake not to assemble yourselves around the computer screen [Applause] hallelujah now it's different if there's a real need you're sick just like when we were sick that's a different story but i'm if i'm just doing it because it's what well that's just convenient to do there's something we need to rethink our priorities i'm talking about faith faith that purses and and presses through notice he said it'll help you to get well there'll be people who listen at the word being taught that'll never be in a prayer line yet they'll get well for something happens subconsciously now i know sometimes that you know we we like to cherry-pick quotes yes sir that's the way it's going to happen for me but you don't determine how it's going to happen for you you're not the one who determines that god has that determined but what you and i as believers we stand on the word by his stripes i'm healed however it's coming it's coming i'm a believer and healing is the children's bread and i'm one of his children however it comes it's going to be god do it thank god for the doctors but it's god all healing comes from god or something happens subconsciously maybe they don't even realize what it's all about and they get well wow so faith is not even it's not even awareness up here right because brother brian there have been people brother branham called out in the line he said oh you didn't think you had enough faith to be healed but you already healed amen faith is greater than our thoughts oh boy we ought to have a we'll have a real praise time right here right now if you can recognize god has delivered it and god's desire is to stimulate that it's greater than every thought he said somebody else can be sitting and watch one of the signs of the lord appear and they'll get well it's anything he said that can stimulate faith i remember how many remember the scripture where paul was preaching and paul and there was a man who had crippled from his mother's womb he'd never walked now think about this brother joey it's one thing you and know we can look at it and say you know he had walked at one time but that got taken from him well god restores that too but here there wasn't no memory of walking this man had grown up all his life sitting on on the side of the wall watching the rest of him play kickball let's just bring it down where it's at he recognized there was limitations where he could not get out there and do like the other children then as it continued to progress through life and everything else think about it think about times not saying that everybody that would fall into something like that there's complexes but you recognize i want you to understand this you recognize that a disease there's a tormenting spirit that comes with it somebody preach with me now i don't care if it's anxiety depression or whatever it is it's a tormenting devil not that you're you understand what i'm saying diabetes all those things it's afflictions back pain and everything else it's it wears it wears a person it's a tormenting spirit but this man paul uh paul was speaking he heard paul speak now everybody else heard paul speak too but paul was directed by the spirit of god he begins to behold this man and he perceives he has faith to be healed there's a witness that has taken place how many know what i'm talking about i've stood even on this end of ministering whether it's been here even in other other places where i've had ministers that pull me aside and it's not me it's every real a man of god that's yielded to god god will take you down certain pathways and you start going down a certain strain and what it is is recognizing there's a need and the holy spirit there's a pool to minister to that need paul recognized this just wasn't a need but this man had faith to be healed where did he get that faith from he already had faith are you hearing me he already had faith but by hearing the word and the presence of god it caused his faith to rise in god to where he was pulsating in his heart this is my night this is my moment this is my time and the words spoke to him stand up on your feet this is where brother bannon would take us in the scripture with this event and other events in the life of the lord jesus and say the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and if me abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done but say what are you saying well faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god if we can open our lives and really get locked in and we're taking in and say lord i'm here to worship you and i'm here to receive from you i'm telling you as the words begin to abide in our life it drives out doubt it drives out unbelief as it's abiding in our life what's happening faith is rising without reading all those scriptures yet you're aware each time the lord jesus with a woman who had an issue of blood she already had said in herself if i can touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole she came behind all the multitude and she got to jesus the response of the word is daughter be of a good comfort thy faith not my faith your faith hath made thee whole the faith was already there it had been raised to believe and to accept what he had already made available remember when blind bartimaeus blind bartimaeus had been taught you know the the the the the the pharisees and different ones brother brown dramatized that how they were teaching well you know god used to do that and god used to do this god opened them red sea sure he did but you know god don't move like that no more and and you know what that is that's an old unbeliever standing there under the cloak of religion that's a person that don't know god are you hearing me now because anybody who knows god knows he's the same yesterday today and forever he is still the i am if he ever did it one time he was making known i'm the same god i'll do it again when the conditions are met blind bartimaeus heard and he began to cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and people looking around and told him shut up hold your peace but when they told him to do that he said i'm going to turn up my praise [Applause] you didn't like that listen to this hold your peace stop carrying on that way but what it was his faith was crying out he had a need and he didn't care what every other circumstance was saying that sixth sense was taking effect it had been awakened as a man that was awakened out of sleep and here in the other part that he did jesus stood still and commanded for him to come you know what he did he had a garment on now that garment that he hit on that garment had a special signification to it it was a garment worn by blind men are you hearing me the garment that he wore just wasn't some garment it held a signification that this man of a condition it spoke of a condition but he cast off the garment [Music] go ahead and let it go i don't need it no more i i have summoned i have asked i have heard and now the word is calling for me to come and stand [Music] what do you want me to do for you he said lord that i've received my sight go that way thy faith hath made thee whole there was a woman bound with seven unclean spirits she lived a rough life mary magdalene if simon would have known that she was going to come barging in there they would have put everybody at the door but the reality jesus kept that appointment at simon's house because he knew she was coming [Applause] the rest of them wasn't going to receive him the rest of them didn't have one nothing to do with him but jesus keeps every appointment he had an appointment in this hour for me and you he sent this message brother constantine he sent this word for you he sent it for our lives to bring deliverance in our lives in this hour he knew we would be here in this generation it didn't matter what we were bound down with jesus keeps every appointment her faith had got stimulated she went home she got out her money box everything that she had been keeping she hadn't got it in a real good way but she realized this had come nonetheless but he deserves all my praise he deserves everything you know what she was typing to a real genuine believer when they recognize something begins to move in their heart he's all i need and you recognize what you have i'm going to surrender every day to the lord jesus that's how the holy ghost comes when you surrender everything she makes her way on down through there she begins to anoint his feet wash them with tears she didn't have to go to the beauty shop and borrow a wig preach with me now let's just bring down what the prophet said he said many of the women nowadays would have to stand on their head to dry his feet [Music] come on long hair it's a covering given for the woman's glory is that right showing the authority and the headship that she has heard from god and she's under the headship of the word of god that ain't my words that's god's word if you can't believe that word then you can't believe any other word that's only a little part of the scripture that's one little thing that god is asking us for oh my it didn't matter there was an audience all around it didn't matter it was something moving in her i got to get to him i got to get to him all the whispering everything else that went on oh if he knew what kind of a woman was touching him if all this was going on but you know what in the midst of all of that that was taking place she was having an audience with jesus [Applause] you know what that is that's a daughter of abraham while the rest of the kings were out there in genesis 14 the king of sodom the king of genelom all these other kings abraham was having an audience with melchizedek while the rest of the world is having an audience with the kings and spiritual powers you and i are privileged to have an audience with melchizedek the same lord jesus christ and if not for his grace sending his word his presence we would still be bound in our senses but god's grace [Music] you might have said in a message church for a long time but god's grace [Applause] one day you had to have a meeting with melchizedek i'm talking about the lord jesus christ oh my what did he tell her by faith hath saved thee go in peace by faith her faith had been stimulated to that place to accept god i think that's a very powerful reality brother and we'll talk about remember you have different ones in the message brother bran will always i don't say always but when he deals with messages like faith is a sixth sense a super sense and many of the mysteries and brother brown will bring it up at different times and i just say it this way the holy spirit bringing it back because of needs that need to hear those testimonies testimonies are powerful don't you ever don't you ever let the devil down by a testimony what god has done if god has done something in your life you need to testify is that right you need to give a testimony because that right there is a sounding forth god is in the camp god is present god is present fulfilling his word those two women everybody okay it was two women one had an ulcerated condition in her stomach the other one had a growth on her neck they came that night in that service and the spirit of god uncovered and spoke to what was there and pronounced their healing they went home that little woman she goes home who had the ulcerated condition i think it's important that how god would inspire this and stop me i believe it's important to understand this she her children couldn't finish the oatmeal so she's cleaning up the table now normally that would have tore up or eat or anything brother brown goes into it and says she took a bite and here's what happened the thought in her mind said i'm probably going to get sick like i do it other times that was a thought but faith had already taken hold i can tell by some of your looks it's getting blown away right now like whoa man that's just it shows faith is greater than our thoughts it masters circumstances when you have a contrary thought that's not the time to abandon but faith just stands right there and says let that birdie pass on through but you ain't building a nest here no vacancy [Applause] amen and here they were weeks later brother branham tells us and when that situation happened with her here she took that bite of oatmeal man it was good i don't know what she had in it i could but anyhow it was good she did she hate that she eat the rest of us there then she made herself some eggs bacon and everything else then she had she was it was done so she went down the street to tell her neighbor who had that growth on her neck and she was in her house shaking the sheet because she couldn't find the growth that brother branham tells us very very clearly he said what it was is they had received the promise and the sixth sense in their life would not take no for an answer they might have got up the next day and they felt bad but they kept pressing on and said god has spoken who can but prophesy [Applause] and they got up the next day and they got up the next day what was it that sixth sense would not take no for an answer and about that time the angel of the lord came passing through the neighborhood because jesus keeps every appointment [Applause] john ryan i know it's familiar right john ryan comes in prayer line holy spirit speaks to him he goes out he comes right back around hey wait a minute i thought you said i was healed brother brown said i thought you told me you believed but i want you to watch the wisdom of the holy spirit here when john ryan got ahold of him and said look as a catholic i'm taught to believe my priest he said what he says i believe he said now what has been said right here he said i believe it brother brown said then i'm going to tell you what you do you go from right here and you start rejoicing you know you you hear little things as it comes out a little bit a little more perceptions of the story that people in the community were getting ready to have john ryan committed to a mental asylum they thought it was a nut case because he was out there months brother said months had went by and here he is out there with papers extra extra praise god for my healing you know he was he was following the word go on your way rejoicing he had faith but if that faith it had been stimulated and now what it's doing he was standing there on the promise of god it's in god's hands when it's going to come to pass but he went on his way rejoicing [Music] i know we can go into all that drop from here to there i know we can talk about all that but in reality he was the sixth sense in his life and about that time he got in the barber chair one day and the barber wanted to make fun of him he said uh i hear that you were healed i heard you over that media and got healed john said absolutely he said god has healed me about that time his sight came and he took out running his faith had been stimulated and he was standing there on the promise of god oh my he was not getting up the next day well i know better i ain't no better i don't feel no better i don't feel no better but he was standing on the promise of god and this is where in holding that sixth sense in our life awakened to that reality that it's this same sixth sense that kept paul got peter out of jail he's the same one that loosened paul and silas in their stocks it's the same one that caused the lion's mouth to be shut it's the same one that kept the hebrew children in the fiery furnace these are not stories to us these are testimonies in prophecy for the life of every believer that just as god kept the hebrew children where there was not a smell of smoke on their clothes that that same god will do the same thing for every one of his believing children and brother branham said it like this he said why don't you let that sixth sense go to work for you and he gives this testimony and i'm closing here he said you know don't rely upon those five because they're deceitful but rely upon that sixth one he said he got to talking with brother charlie cox he said i was talking to him on the sixth sense he said and he took it and believed it and played it on a tape so brother charlie took a tape and played it his wife seen that effect and she said give me that tape and i'm going to play it this is right here his wife said let me play it she run in the other room and started playing it now listen now here's the sixth sense she said lord i've got a sixth sense too and i'm gonna put it to work i want the holy ghost and hear it come what is it if you believe it however it counts but it's got to be the sixth sense that goes to work for the holy ghost for healing deliverance salvation on and on it takes faith let's just bow our heads lord jesus you know lord the needs lord sitting here this morning and god how that you would come to encourage us lord encourage us in the promises lord father throughout this building there's there's the hearts there's lives there's needs lord there's promises to be obtained father now lord i pray oh god as lord you've taken and spoken to us this morning lord and i feel like i've just been all over the place lord but just lord just trying to just obey you lord and follow your leading lord for every need that's here lord oh god you know the needs of your people lord we don't all live on the highway sometimes lord we have to go up on this little roadway or go down this little roadway lord but i pray god right here this morning lord the father made that sixth sense lord may it be awakened in lives and hearts lord father needs the lord for healing needs for other situations lord domestic financial whatever that need is lord for the holy ghost oh god may lord of faith be stimulated right there lord i believe god you as your presence has already come by you've lord been able to take and you have taken things lord testimonies and situations and you have ministered lord to our hearts oh god lord we're asking that for each need lord that god made that sixth sense go to work [Music] may this be a moment lord where we don't walk out of this building the same way we came in we don't walk out and ask can i have my worry back can i have my doubt back where did you put this baggage brothers where did you put that back but lord may this be a moment that god is your children would move out lord with that sick sense for their need it doesn't mean lord that we ignore it but we recognize that the god in us is greater lord you know the needs of your children this morning you've come to encourage us you've come to strengthen us lord father if there be those lord that would come lord and desiring to be prayed for lord i i just asked god that may lord in their hearts before they would even walk up here lord may everything lord if there's anything that would be in the way that would hinder that may that be settled out and may they come lord with the faith in you not a faith in my hands not a faith in me or faith in this church that won't get anywhere your prophet talks about that lord he lays that out so clear but it's faith in recognizing that god is present [Music] or maybe there's needs right here situations that got everything figured out but today they just realized lord that's where i'm i'm being defeated i've got everything figured out and this isn't going right and that isn't going my way or i'm but god may they recognize that that's only the enemy trying to get them to live by their senses to where when they're not seeing anything they don't feel any different i pray god this morning that you would so energize their faith that it looks beyond what they see it goes beyond what they think made that sixth sense lord be energized here this morning lord that like blind bartimaeus or like john ryan we're like others lord even the testimony i think of sister miranda how many months and years that she went for those shots in her eyes how long i didn't even ask her that but i know i also know of standing right here in different times of praying with our sister there was an evidence there in her life for that need dear god you provided no matter if the doctor had said come in we need to do another shot the sixth sense was unfazed and now lord she's rejoicing the evidence has now become manifest completely lord how many others how many other lives lord how many we could lord each give testimony now lord you know the needs that are present right now and you are right now god you're the i am that i am you're he that was and you're he that will be and you are he that is right now father granted for your children now for each and every one we ask it lord in the
