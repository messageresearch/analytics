[0:21] in the name of jesus christ amen
[0:26] god bless you thank you musicians if we
[0:29] could stand
[0:30] let's go to ephesians 5 now or not
[0:33] ephesians
[0:34] isaiah 53.
[0:47] we'll just read a few verses of
[0:49] scripture and then we'll
[0:51] let you have your seats and we'll just
[0:53] continue reading
[0:57] in verse 1 of isaiah 53
[1:00] it says who hath believed
[1:04] our report and to whom is the
[1:07] arm of the lord revealed
[1:10] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:13] tender plant
[1:15] and as a root out of a dry ground
[1:18] he hath no form nor comeliness
[1:22] and when we shall see him there's no
[1:25] beauty
[1:26] that we should desire him
[1:29] he is despised and rejected
[1:33] of men a man of sorrows
[1:37] and acquainted with grief
[1:41] and we hid as it were our faces
[1:45] from him he was despised
[1:49] and we esteemed him not surely
[1:52] he hath borne our griefs
[1:56] and carried our sorrows
[1:59] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[2:02] of god
[2:04] and afflicted but he was wounded
[2:08] for our transgressions he was
[2:12] bruised for our iniquities
[2:15] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[2:18] him
[2:20] and with his stripes we are healed
[2:25] all we like sheep have gone astray
[2:32] we have turned everyone to his own way
[2:36] and the lord hath laid on him
[2:40] the iniquity of us all
[2:45] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[2:50] yet he opened not his mouth
[2:54] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[2:57] and as a sheep
[2:59] before her shearers is dumb
[3:03] so he opened not his mouth he was taken
[3:06] from prison and from
[3:08] judgment and who shall declare
[3:11] his generation for he was cut off out of
[3:15] the land of the living
[3:17] for the transgression of my people was
[3:20] he stricken
[3:21] and he made his grave with the wicked
[3:24] with the rich in his death and because
[3:26] he had done no violence
[3:28] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[3:32] may god bless you as you've been seated
[3:37] i want to continue their reading just a
[3:40] little bit
[3:42] but i'd like to just continue with the
[3:44] thought we've been looking
[3:46] at redemption
[3:49] the redemption of sons and daughters of
[3:52] god
[3:54] you'll notice in the scripture as it
[3:57] says
[3:59] we all were like sheep
[4:03] we always were a sheep
[4:08] couldn't be recognized nor did we
[4:10] display
[4:11] that we were sheep but notice we all
[4:14] went
[4:14] our own way because
[4:18] there is one who is as peter would write
[4:21] under inspiration
[4:23] who is the bishop
[4:27] and shepherd of our soul and that's the
[4:31] lord jesus
[4:32] himself he made a way
[4:35] when he was here
[4:38] many of the disciples the word would
[4:40] come and would call
[4:42] them they would leave what they had and
[4:46] begin to follow him but yet he
[4:50] he let him know he says
[4:53] i must needs go away because if i don't
[4:56] go away
[4:57] then the comforter he can't come
[5:02] he's is going away truly it was a
[5:06] they didn't understand what was taking
[5:08] place even as he would speak
[5:10] many times of his death
[5:14] and the price that was to be paid
[5:18] even as he met their amount
[5:20] transfiguration
[5:22] there in the gospel of luke i believe it
[5:24] is
[5:25] because he speaks and they are all there
[5:28] there there
[5:29] is such a an intimate communion
[5:32] there as he stands there with moses and
[5:34] elijah and they speak to him they
[5:36] converse
[5:37] of those things that should lead in
[5:40] into his death the offering up of the
[5:43] atonement
[5:44] and what that would mean because
[5:47] this is what has been looked for this is
[5:50] what has been
[5:52] longed for this is this is
[5:55] the desire that within that heart that
[5:58] was longing even how david would write
[6:01] and say the lord
[6:02] is my shepherd i shall not want
[6:07] and yet david did not know
[6:11] him in that way as far as
[6:14] in that of redemption in that
[6:17] manner where god would come by his
[6:20] spirit
[6:21] and indwell david's life
[6:24] never to depart david would
[6:27] as all of them through the old testament
[6:30] the spirit of god would come down upon
[6:32] them and then it would
[6:34] lift back and then it would come back
[6:36] upon them and then it would
[6:38] lift back but there was god's desire
[6:41] that there would be
[6:43] a union that would come about a union
[6:46] and a fellowship
[6:47] that you and i might come back into
[6:50] our rightful position of where that we
[6:54] would be as sons and daughters of god
[6:57] yet we were like sheep that had gone
[6:59] astray
[6:59] everyone our own way and he
[7:04] he the lord laid as the bible says the
[7:07] iniquity
[7:08] of us all upon him
[7:12] there was only one who could
[7:15] bear this there was only one who could
[7:18] redeem us
[7:20] and bring us back and it couldn't be
[7:23] anyone
[7:23] separate or apart from god but it must
[7:27] be god
[7:28] himself come down and pay the price
[7:33] through the sacrifice of his son
[7:37] the lord jesus it was god taking up on
[7:40] a body of flesh a body
[7:44] of humiliation in order to redeem
[7:47] us back to himself
[7:51] so somebody had to make the way for us
[7:53] and he
[7:54] he made a way for you and i the bible
[7:58] would go on
[7:59] to declare as we're reading who shall
[8:02] declare
[8:03] his generation notice it doesn't say
[8:07] generations when you open the book of
[8:11] matthew chapter 1 it says
[8:13] now this is the generation of jesus
[8:16] christ
[8:18] because it's not generations
[8:21] there's one there is no
[8:24] ending to his life amen
[8:30] it is when god when god has imparted
[8:34] remember even leading up to that time
[8:37] when we have received that quickening in
[8:40] our life remember that representation
[8:43] that seed
[8:44] it was laying there the whole time
[8:47] there was a representation of eternal
[8:50] life
[8:52] in reality we were saved the whole time
[8:57] but there's got to come a reality
[9:02] and that reality has to come to you and
[9:05] i
[9:06] that we were saved the whole time and
[9:08] when that reality comes to us
[9:10] it changes our lives in order
[9:14] to reflect that security
[9:17] that is in jesus christ
[9:21] shall declare his generation that's a
[9:24] challenge
[9:25] that goes forth to our lives today
[9:28] amen to reflect him and this
[9:31] is where the scripture if we can just to
[9:34] pick up
[9:35] in these verses it says yet it pleased
[9:38] the lord
[9:39] to bruise him he hath put him
[9:42] to grief when thou shalt make
[9:45] his soul an offering for sin
[9:49] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[9:52] his days
[9:53] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[9:56] prosper
[9:57] in his hand he shall see
[10:00] of the travail of his soul and shall
[10:04] be satisfied
[10:07] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[10:10] servant
[10:11] justify many remember when jesus was
[10:15] here
[10:16] this knowledge it's speaking of this
[10:19] is that of a divine revelation
[10:23] he knew who he was he knew the purpose
[10:26] that he had come here for
[10:29] that purpose was for redemption
[10:33] that had been shown all the way in
[10:36] tights
[10:37] all the way through the scripture even
[10:39] opening in genesis 1.
[10:41] the light coming in genesis 1 the word
[10:44] being spoken bringing light
[10:46] it was bringing redemption to this
[10:50] earth that was covered over with
[10:52] darkness and void
[10:53] that back in genesis 1 speaks of the new
[10:57] birth in our life
[10:59] so it's that mystery has been shown all
[11:02] the way through
[11:03] his purpose of coming was not to make
[11:07] a kingdom upon this earth but his
[11:10] purpose
[11:10] was to redeem the sons
[11:14] and daughters of god to pay and satisfy
[11:18] the debt and the price that was needed
[11:21] that you and i could go free
[11:26] thank you lord amen so his look the
[11:29] revelation
[11:30] moving in his life by my knowledge
[11:33] shall my righteous servant justify
[11:37] many for he shall bear
[11:40] their iniquities
[11:44] and i can say to you this morning if
[11:47] you're still carrying your sins
[11:50] what you need to recognize is there's
[11:52] one
[11:53] who's already bore them for you
[11:59] and as soon as you can recognize that of
[12:02] what he has done for you
[12:04] you'll experience a release in your life
[12:10] you can sit here under and under such
[12:13] condemnation
[12:15] with sin and and bearing that you don't
[12:17] know what i've done
[12:18] let me just sum this up this is the
[12:20] second time here in this same chapter
[12:22] reading
[12:23] he laid upon him the iniquity of a song
[12:27] for he shall bear their iniquities
[12:31] [Music]
[12:33] he born once and for all
[12:41] therefore will i divide him
[12:44] a portion with the great
[12:48] notice this offering this this
[12:52] serving the purpose now
[12:55] he receives their apportion an allotment
[12:59] an inheritance with the great
[13:02] and i say this very clearly there's not
[13:05] one
[13:06] grader
[13:09] not even close you can take the greatest
[13:12] people in the world
[13:14] and stack them on top of one another but
[13:17] not
[13:17] one of them they might give you a better
[13:19] job
[13:21] they might be able to sign your paycheck
[13:23] they might be
[13:24] you might be able to rub shoulders with
[13:26] who's who but nobody
[13:27] can deal with your soul and take care of
[13:30] the answer
[13:31] for what you're longing for but the
[13:33] greatest of all and that's the lord
[13:35] jesus christ
[13:38] hallelujah this one really cares about
[13:41] you
[13:42] [Applause]
[13:44] he just don't care about you because of
[13:46] what you might be able to offer him
[13:49] or what you might be able to do for him
[13:51] he's got a
[13:52] real desire for your soul
[13:56] [Applause]
[13:57] it's for your life he came that you
[14:01] might have
[14:02] life and have life more
[14:05] abundantly
[14:07] [Applause]
[14:08] [Music]
[14:08] [Applause]
[14:12] and he shall o glory he
[14:16] shall divide the spoil
[14:20] with the strong there was a battle
[14:24] at calvary the battles turning into
[14:28] gethsemane
[14:30] it was one it came to calvary now
[14:33] calvary here he ascends now into the
[14:35] lowest parts of hell
[14:37] yeah without them without going into all
[14:40] that
[14:41] he whipped he whipped the devil took the
[14:44] keys
[14:45] he ascended up
[14:48] and he told them to wait in the city of
[14:51] jerusalem
[14:52] until you be endued with power
[14:56] the dividing of the spoil
[15:01] that image that left them in the garden
[15:04] when they fell
[15:05] that life that departed from them and
[15:08] here they come into a place
[15:10] where now of complete of just you know
[15:14] where
[15:14] mortality now because of disobedience to
[15:17] the word
[15:18] now death sets in
[15:21] but when life is come that
[15:24] life it comes to deal with the condition
[15:27] of the soul
[15:29] this is why just the offering up of a
[15:32] body
[15:32] would never ever do it must be the
[15:36] offering of his soul
[15:41] hallelujah because there must be that
[15:44] which would pay
[15:45] the ransom for our debt
[15:50] he shall see notice he shall see the
[15:53] travail
[15:54] of his soul they saw the body but god
[15:57] was
[15:57] looking beyond the body he saw the
[16:00] travail
[16:01] of his soul
[16:04] saul became the offering for our sin
[16:09] bodies of animals this is animal
[16:13] bodies of animals have been offered up
[16:15] but an animal
[16:16] does not have a soul
[16:21] man could go and be justified in the
[16:23] presence of god but he left with the
[16:25] same nature
[16:27] there can never be a transformation of
[16:31] his nature
[16:32] hallelujah go with me right now this
[16:36] morning
[16:38] you could see what our father was
[16:40] beholding
[16:41] when this isaiah was caught up in a
[16:43] vision and he's looking
[16:45] in upon it but this this vision now
[16:48] becomes a reality
[16:50] it comes from the supernatural into that
[16:53] of the flesh
[16:54] of the lord jesus and here god
[16:58] is looking down and here his pleasure
[17:01] the bruising and seeing the travailing
[17:03] of the soul
[17:04] you say how can there be delight in that
[17:07] because through this
[17:08] offering now sons and daughters of
[17:12] god can come back home what the world
[17:18] looked at as
[17:19] weakness but god said through this
[17:22] weakness
[17:23] my power will be released
[17:32] glory be to god he shall divide
[17:36] the spoil with the strong
[17:39] the strong meaning the numerous ones
[17:44] the word strong messiah's brothers
[17:50] is that right you see this is
[17:54] this is one this is our joshua
[17:58] it's the holy ghost has come to divide
[18:02] our inheritance because he have
[18:05] poured out notice his soul
[18:08] unto death he was numbered with the
[18:12] transgressors
[18:13] and he beared the sin of many and made
[18:16] tr and made
[18:17] intercession for the transgressors
[18:21] brother makes this statement and i want
[18:23] to just refer to this here
[18:27] just serve as a as a background for
[18:29] things that we'll go into
[18:31] the message unveiling of god he says he
[18:34] died
[18:36] to reveal himself to us
[18:40] now let us die to self
[18:43] to reveal him to others
[18:47] let us die to the traditions and things
[18:51] to reveal him
[18:52] to others died to the denominations
[18:55] to reveal him to others
[18:59] so it's a dying to self
[19:03] that the word might have preeminence
[19:08] a person could say well this is my
[19:12] this is my affiliation or this is what i
[19:15] believe
[19:16] maybe they're a methodist this is what i
[19:18] believe
[19:19] but when the word comes across your
[19:22] pathway
[19:23] and it starts dealing with your life and
[19:25] you realize wait a minute
[19:27] there's more to it there's a longing
[19:30] within you
[19:31] there's more than just a church
[19:33] membership
[19:35] it's a spirit of god that's dealing with
[19:38] your life what's he trying to do
[19:40] lead you to a place to die to self
[19:44] [Music]
[19:45] the climax of the ministry of the lord
[19:49] jesus
[19:49] was when he comes to a place of complete
[19:53] death to self amen
[19:59] i believe we're in there i believe we're
[20:01] there
[20:04] this is where the holy spirit deals with
[20:07] our life
[20:08] to die yes amen you can't be born again
[20:11] until you first
[20:12] die right
[20:16] you can't have two natures there you
[20:18] can't have two of them alive at the same
[20:19] time
[20:21] amen there's got to be one where
[20:23] judgment comes
[20:24] and then he raises up the other in a
[20:27] uniting
[20:28] amen is that right
[20:33] so you see this is why
[20:36] without dying out it continues to work
[20:39] even in our life
[20:40] of us dying to sound even as god will
[20:44] continue
[20:45] to deal with our hearts and dying to
[20:48] ourselves now
[20:48] i want to just take this here uh in in
[20:51] the scriptures and just
[20:53] looking at this of this redemption of
[20:55] the sons and daughters
[20:57] of what has been made for you and i
[21:01] and i want to say it just in this manner
[21:04] as we go forward to recognize
[21:07] that we were given an inheritance
[21:11] before the foundation of the world
[21:14] [Music]
[21:15] our inheritance was already there you
[21:18] don't receive an inheritance
[21:20] as far as somebody then uh relinquishes
[21:23] or gives something to you
[21:24] after they pass an inheritance is what
[21:27] has already been
[21:29] made for or what has already been laid
[21:31] out the death
[21:32] of that individual only brings you into
[21:35] a place where you can go
[21:37] and rightfully claim what belongs to you
[21:39] amen
[21:41] so we already had an inheritance
[21:47] brother brandon would keep working with
[21:48] this through the adoption series
[21:50] he says jesus never gave me an
[21:56] inheritance he brought me
[21:58] to it amen
[22:02] what he received he divides
[22:07] it's by him by him through him
[22:10] that we receive our inheritance
[22:14] our allotted portion stay with me
[22:17] who is he the word
[22:20] [Music]
[22:22] he's the word the word is a living
[22:26] person our inheritance is in the word
[22:30] the land where did the children of
[22:32] israel where did their inheritance lay
[22:35] it didn't lay on the other side of
[22:37] jordan
[22:38] some chose that right are you are you
[22:40] with me
[22:41] some chose the other side of jordan they
[22:44] got comfortable
[22:45] they got laid down but i want you to
[22:46] think about this look
[22:48] years later for those who said we'll
[22:51] just take our inheritance
[22:52] on this side of jordan you heard of the
[22:55] maniac of gadara right
[22:58] you look at what happened in that
[22:59] community when jesus came into that
[23:01] community
[23:02] in that time there was one who was bound
[23:04] there with with a legion
[23:06] of devils and jesus heard the call
[23:11] he couldn't help it that man couldn't
[23:12] help it that his
[23:14] fathers and everything else grandfathers
[23:16] that they made the decision
[23:18] not to go over
[23:21] but he made there was something in him
[23:24] are you hearing me
[23:25] he didn't have to live under the
[23:28] darkness
[23:29] of what his father did what his
[23:31] grandfather did
[23:32] there was a call inside of him that
[23:36] a legion of demons couldn't hold back
[23:39] and jesus heard that call and he crossed
[23:44] the water to get to him
[23:47] that man was set free he wanted to go
[23:51] and he wanted to go with jesus and jesus
[23:54] said
[23:54] go back to the city you came from and
[23:57] tell
[23:58] all your friends of the mercy that the
[24:01] lord hath had upon you
[24:04] hallelujah god took a man who was bound
[24:07] and that man was set free he now had
[24:10] something to talk about
[24:12] [Music]
[24:14] you think it wasn't a miracle when he
[24:17] would walk down
[24:18] the streets of gattera
[24:21] they didn't have to worry about him no
[24:22] more punching out windows
[24:25] [Music]
[24:27] come on now mama didn't have to worry
[24:29] about him coming home
[24:31] a bad way the kids didn't have to run
[24:33] from him
[24:34] something had changed
[24:41] but the rest of that community
[24:44] they because their hogs
[24:48] those evil spirits came and they ran
[24:50] they ran those
[24:51] herds bit us to go into the swine it ran
[24:54] them off
[24:55] and notice notice the effect of being
[24:58] out from the presence of god
[25:00] they asked him get out of here please
[25:04] they didn't want the lord jesus around
[25:06] you see what happens
[25:08] you see this is what happens for those
[25:10] who choose
[25:12] just to live on that side of the
[25:13] inheritance
[25:16] listen this is where every denomination
[25:18] is it's in that place
[25:20] that's why it comes to a place in there
[25:22] in the book of revelations
[25:24] he said i stand at the door and now they
[25:26] put him out
[25:29] they don't want him they want to talk
[25:32] about
[25:33] isaiah 53 as a historical event
[25:36] but it's not a historical event it's a
[25:39] reality
[25:40] that comes to your life to release you
[25:44] from the death and the question of sin
[25:46] in your life

[26:52] declaration
[26:53] there's an inward work taking place
[26:57] men can put you down in the water and
[27:00] bring you up

[27:33] belongs to you
[27:35] amen this is why let me just say it
[27:39] in this manner hebrews 1 3 who being the
[27:42] brightness of his glory
[27:44] and the expressed image of his person
[27:46] upholding all things by the word of his
[27:48] power
[27:49] when he had by himself purged our sins
[27:52] sat down on the right hand of the
[27:55] majesty on high.
[27:57] he's already done it
[28:03] already done it he's taking care of
[28:05] everything brother samuel
[28:06] you don't know this need they just came
[28:09] up with this disease
[28:10] i don't care how many more diseases
[28:12] whether they produce them in labs or
[28:15] whatever more it's got it all covered
[28:21] you know what it means to sit down he
[28:23] sat down
[28:24] in power
[28:27] this is not a theosomy body on the
[28:30] throne
[28:32] but now that sacrifice that was raised
[28:36] up
[28:36] it has sat down right there in the
[28:39] throne
[28:40] set till i make thine enemies that
[28:42] footstool
[28:44] amen hallelujah
[28:49] we know where we're standing
[28:52] we're not ignorant of these things
[28:56] had by himself and here in this
[28:58] scripture
[28:59] in verse 4 being made so much better
[29:02] than the angels
[29:03] as he hath by inheritance
[29:06] obtained a more excellent name than they
[29:09] notice he obtained a more excellent name
[29:12] than they
[29:14] amen notice philippians 2 8
[29:18] being found in fashion as a man he
[29:21] humbled
[29:21] himself and became obedient
[29:24] unto death even the death of the cross
[29:28] let me just say to you if he would have
[29:30] had to be drug to calvary
[29:32] it wouldn't have been the right
[29:33] sacrifice it had to be
[29:38] willingly
[29:40] if he went willingly satan could have a
[29:42] claim that's right
[29:43] you say this is the virgin spotless lamb
[29:47] of god
[29:47] but remember it had to be a willingly
[29:53] eve was deceived and under deception
[29:57] surrender her will to the devil's life
[30:02] so now to undo that there's only one
[30:05] thing can undo that
[30:06] and that's not in deception but in truth
[30:10] where the will is surrendered to the
[30:13] word
[30:14] completely o glory
[30:17] it comes to address the prophet so he
[30:20] became obedient oh this is a
[30:22] such a key obedient unto death even the
[30:25] death of the cross
[30:26] this was a full surrender of his will
[30:30] amen now remember what we saw at calvary
[30:35] it all began in gethsemane
[30:40] hallelujah we're talking about coming to
[30:44] our inheritance
[30:45] yeah remember this is this is our
[30:47] pattern
[30:48] amen you can't you cannot crawl upon the
[30:52] altar
[30:53] you can't crawl upon the altar and die
[30:56] with the lamb
[30:57] until you first had gethsemane
[31:01] gethsemane is the complete
[31:04] ringing out it's the olive press
[31:08] nevertheless not my will
[31:12] thine will be done there was a struggle
[31:14] that was going on
[31:16] there in gethsemane he prayed three
[31:18] times nevertheless
[31:20] it'd be possible let this cut pass from
[31:23] me
[31:25] a part of him that wanted to live yes
[31:28] but there was a part there that lay on
[31:31] the inside
[31:32] the desire to honor the word of god
[31:36] to desire the purpose of god listen this
[31:39] revelation he had in his heart
[31:41] yes it wasn't a revelation he came to
[31:45] it was a revelation in that hour there
[31:47] was an
[31:48] outworking it was an outworking in his
[31:51] life
[31:51] there right there in gethsemane
[31:55] was where the battle was won
[31:58] that's where the lamb prevailed
[32:01] that's where the lamb overcame why the
[32:04] decision
[32:05] and the submission of his will to the
[32:08] will
[32:08] of the father that's the same
[32:12] with the new birth
[32:15] it's god bringing hearts into gethsemane
[32:19] to where their life it's a complete
[32:22] squeezing out of their life
[32:24] amen to where
[32:28] the will becomes that
[32:31] that's a miracle where the old nature
[32:33] and the spirit
[32:34] agrees with god and then god says okay
[32:39] now it's time to take up your cross
[32:42] it's time to crucify that old man it's
[32:45] time to kill him
[32:46] and bury him amen amen so notice because
[32:50] of what hath taken place
[32:52] wherefore god also hath highly exalted
[32:55] him
[32:55] and given him a name above every name
[32:57] but at the name of jesus
[32:59] every knee should bow of things in
[33:01] heaven things in earth things under the
[33:03] earth
[33:03] and that every tongue should confess
[33:05] that jesus christ is lord
[33:07] to the glory of god the father
[33:10] peter's standing in acts 5 31 him
[33:14] hath god exalted with his right hand
[33:18] but how how was this exalted it's when
[33:21] he surrendered his will
[33:25] in gethsemane
[33:29] goes to calvary and here he is raised up
[33:32] again
[33:34] triumphant over death
[33:37] hell and the grave
[33:40] he's able to come back to the disciples
[33:43] when he walks with them
[33:44] for 40 days right here in preparation
[33:47] leading into that place of pentecost
[33:51] he's able to tell them reveal to them
[33:54] be of good cheer for i have overcome
[33:58] he's able to minister to them he's there
[34:01] to
[34:02] bring them and to direct them into this
[34:04] place notice what is taking place
[34:06] how did it come to this where what we
[34:09] are observing here
[34:10] where now he comes triumphant over death
[34:13] held the grave and now
[34:14] preparing to be to ascend to the right
[34:17] hand of god
[34:19] it's because first in order to obtain
[34:22] this inheritance his inheritance
[34:24] is his position this was
[34:27] his position amen are you with me
[34:31] this position itself is made known to
[34:34] him
[34:34] right right is that right it was not
[34:37] fully revealed even in acts 1 but it
[34:39] is made known to him brother bram tells
[34:41] us when it is made known to him
[34:43] there in when he ascends and he sets
[34:47] at the right hand of god and we
[34:48] understand it's not a right hand out
[34:50] here but right hand signifies
[34:52] power and authority he sat down
[34:56] him hath got exalted with his right hand
[34:58] now if he did that for him
[35:00] that's the same way it is for you and i
[35:03] this is how that we
[35:04] obtain the inheritance in our own lives
[35:08] you see without him pouring out his soul
[35:12] unto death your eye can never come to
[35:14] that place of dying out to self
[35:16] because it takes the working and leading
[35:19] of the holy spirit to bring us to this
[35:22] place
[35:24] glory be to god you see god the spirit
[35:26] of god will not war
[35:27] contrary to his word he'll always work
[35:31] in harmony with his word what the word
[35:33] is calling for in this hour just as the
[35:36] word called for justification
[35:37] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[35:40] a cause for the
[35:41] for the indwelling of our inheritance
[35:43] that person
[35:44] that portion in our life you see the
[35:46] word it calls us
[35:48] by the spirit of truth into what god has
[35:51] for us
[35:54] him hath god exalted with his right hand
[35:56] to be a prince and a savior
[35:58] for to give repentance to israel and
[35:59] forgiveness of sins
[36:01] acts 2 33 therefore being by the right
[36:04] hand of god
[36:05] exalted and having received of the
[36:08] father
[36:08] the promise of the holy ghost he hath
[36:11] shed
[36:12] forth this which ye now see
[36:15] and hear right now so him
[36:19] the exalting and coming in to his
[36:23] inheritance now is the dividing
[36:26] of our inheritance so the dividing of
[36:29] our inheritance
[36:30] cannot come outside of the propitiation
[36:34] it cannot come outside of the atonement
[36:38] it cannot come outside of the word
[36:42] you see anything outside the word can be
[36:44] a sensation
[36:45] can be an emotion we believe in emotion
[36:47] but
[36:48] our inheritance comes through and by the
[36:51] word
[36:51] when our inheritance as it comes by the
[36:54] word
[36:55] then what does it do it brings a new
[36:57] birth it brings a
[36:58] word experience it brings a
[37:01] transformation
[37:02] it brings a passing from death unto life
[37:05] it brings us back
[37:07] to being sons and daughters of god again
[37:10] but it's all through the path of
[37:12] humility
[37:15] oh my oh glory be to god aren't you glad
[37:18] he deals with us that way
[37:20] aren't you glad he don't ask us to be
[37:22] know-it-alls
[37:23] [Music]
[37:24] he just starts speaking to us as our
[37:26] shepherd
[37:28] and we begin to respond to him as a
[37:30] sheep
[37:31] oh and sure we need our nature changed
[37:33] but there's a part
[37:34] on the inside it's a mystery how it's
[37:37] working how he's dealing
[37:38] and our that old nature and that spirit
[37:41] is starting to line up but he's trying
[37:43] to bring
[37:44] his sons and daughters into a place of
[37:46] adoption
[37:47] into a place a position into a place
[37:51] of inheritance

[44:57] for us
[44:58] [Music]
[45:02] through the veil that is to say his
[45:04] flesh
[45:06] is that right how what did he say
[45:10] concerning his flesh
[45:11] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[45:13] man
[45:14] and drink his blood you have no life in
[45:16] you
[45:17] you must be a partaker of that word
[45:20] amen hallelujah when abram
[45:24] got itself all whipped out then here
[45:27] came melchizedek
[45:30] hallelujah and abram what did he do
[45:33] there was a lot of other kings
[45:35] a lot of other kings kings of sodom
[45:39] you put whatever names you want to put
[45:41] on they were kings in that day
[45:44] these were rich people in that day these
[45:46] are people that were who's who
[45:48] in that day but in the midst of all
[45:51] those kings that was around
[45:54] there was one king that stood out to him
[45:56] amen
[45:58] that was melchizedek he never gave a
[46:02] tenth of all to
[46:03] the king of sodom
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] come on now hallelujah
[46:09] this is why your ties you just don't
[46:11] hand your ties to anywhere
[46:13] either ties belong to god it don't
[46:16] belong it don't belong to brother samuel
[46:17] it belongs to god
[46:19] you ain't paying them to brother santa
[46:21] used to god
[46:23] but you see that's that's only a type a
[46:26] tenth
[46:27] of what already belongs to him see what
[46:29] you're doing is giving to him
[46:31] what is already rightfully his but he's
[46:34] entrusted you with him
[46:36] he entrusted you with it will you in
[46:38] turn release that
[46:39] that's only a type of his desire
[46:42] for the tenth of our life the tenth
[46:46] being the first fruit the tenth the
[46:48] tithe being the choice of our life
[46:51] he did not want our body he did not want
[46:53] our spirit
[46:54] he wanted to have our heart
[46:59] hallelujah that the tenth
[47:02] of our life would be surrendered amen
[47:07] to our melchizedek that in the midst of
[47:10] great kings all around
[47:13] it was something about it at that time
[47:15] you know how you read in the scripture
[47:16] at that time
[47:17] the how that abraham surrenders unto him
[47:20] i tithe the tenth of all
[47:22] hallelujah because you see even in that
[47:25] tithe and that tenth
[47:26] notice has the words come back to
[47:29] abraham
[47:30] blessed be abram of the most
[47:34] high god not one of those other kings
[47:38] now those other kings
[47:39] might have been able to talk about man
[47:41] you've got a lot of talents abraham

[47:45] multiply man i tell you man you got a
[47:47] lot of good talents

[47:51] that they could see
[47:53] these are things as far as with those
[47:55] kings that they could see
[47:57] but this king he saw something much
[48:00] greater
[48:00] those kings just like in your life those
[48:03] kings can only point out
[48:05] certain maybe traits and attributes and
[48:07] things that you have and god gave you
[48:09] those attributes
[48:10] god gave you those traits he did not put
[48:12] you here in earth
[48:13] without things in your life that might
[48:15] come forth
[48:16] in order to provide for yourself but
[48:19] it's all him providing
[48:20] but yet this king when he comes
[48:24] he's the one who reveals to you not that
[48:26] oh you're an engineer
[48:28] or you're obtained you're a great worker
[48:30] with wood my abraham you're a great
[48:31] farmer
[48:32] my you know how to work the sheep no no
[48:34] he reveals to him
[48:36] you're a god you're of god
[48:40] listen to me abraham heard the call of
[48:43] god
[48:44] he's already heard the promises of god
[48:47] but now when he meets melchizedek
[48:50] melchizedek
[48:51] identifies him blessed be abraham
[48:55] of the most high god
[49:12] [Music]
[49:15] he consecrated for us
[49:18] through the veil that is to say his
[49:22] flesh
[49:23] he opened the way for you and i am amen
[49:27] in order for us to come back to our
[49:30] inheritance
[49:32] he had to make a way
[49:38] so he consecrated this way
[49:42] he said when he stood here i am the way
[49:45] the truth and the life and i say he
[49:48] steal still tonight or this morning
[49:53] the truth the life
[49:57] it's still the word that goes forth that
[49:59] discerns the very thoughts and intents
[50:01] of our hearts
[50:04] and having a high priest look at this
[50:06] and having a high priest over the house
[50:08] of god
[50:09] let us draw near with a true heart
[50:13] in full assurance of faith having our
[50:16] hearts
[50:17] sprinkled from an evil conscience
[50:21] and our bodies washed with pure water
[50:26] let me read just one more scripture can
[50:28] i do that
[50:32] second corinthians 5 16
[50:35] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[50:39] after the flesh yea though we have known
[50:43] christ
[50:43] after the flesh yet now henceforth know
[50:47] we
[50:47] him no more
[50:55] he opened the way he consecrated the way
[51:00] and notice how paul is identifying this
[51:03] it's
[51:03] very very important when paul went up to
[51:07] the upper coast of
[51:09] of ephesus in acts chapter 19.
[51:13] he spoke to some believers and when he
[51:15] started speaking to them
[51:18] paul started noticing by their their
[51:22] dialogue
[51:23] where they were at and he asked the
[51:26] question to them
[51:28] have you received the holy ghost
[51:32] since ye believed
[51:36] believing starts it out you don't get
[51:39] the holy ghost and then start doing it
[51:41] amen but it's the holy spirit that
[51:43] starts dealing with your heart
[51:45] through the word amen he starts dealing
[51:48] with your life
[51:49] through the word let me just say this
[51:53] here
[51:54] i've been off my notes on and over and
[51:56] so we just go
[52:00] sometimes even setting here some of you
[52:03] know this by your own testimony
[52:05] you're not even aware of the word how
[52:07] it's having an impact on your life
[52:12] some of you made a surrender to god
[52:15] as far as turning your life over and you
[52:17] weren't even inside of this church
[52:20] building
[52:23] god woke you up in the middle of a night
[52:26] and you realize i don't want to go this
[52:30] way
[52:31] you started to feel conviction that
[52:33] you'd never felt before
[52:37] there's things that you no longer can
[52:39] put on
[52:44] conviction you say what was that it was
[52:47] a holy spirit
[52:49] dealing with your heart you see this is
[52:52] a work how god
[52:53] here is god dealing with your life god
[52:55] working with your life and you might
[52:57] have been trying your best to
[52:58] just suppress it and just say i've got
[53:00] it under control
[53:01] i'm a good person you know i love god i
[53:04] don't think evil of god
[53:06] and you're going about in that way but
[53:08] remember as we said that's just the
[53:09] enemy trying to tell you
[53:11] you're all right don't give in
[53:14] but god rich in mercy
[53:18] is making claims and the holy spirit
[53:21] what's he doing
[53:23] he's searching you out in obedience to
[53:25] the word
[53:27] he searches out that hard and he draws
[53:29] that heart he draws that life
[53:31] and conviction begins to strike that
[53:33] heart here they were
[53:34] standing in acts 19 they had believed
[53:41] these these were individuals they had
[53:44] believed but you see they couldn't go
[53:46] any further
[53:48] than the word that was being
[53:52] ministered to them you see
[53:55] what's revealed a man can only preach
[53:58] what's revealed to him
[54:00] this is why listen to me this is why you
[54:02] don't look down
[54:03] on pentecostals we don't look down on
[54:05] methodists we don't look down
[54:06] this is why brother brown told us he
[54:08] said look don't trouble the methodist
[54:10] don't trouble the pentecostals sure we
[54:13] witness but he says
[54:14] if they're happy on this side of jordan
[54:17] let them alone
[54:19] if that's all the further that they can
[54:21] come to let them alone
[54:24] but there's a call in your heart
[54:27] to go across jordan you're responsible
[54:30] to answer the deed that's calling to the
[54:33] deal
[54:35] you can't decide and say well i think
[54:38] i'll just be a foolish virgin
[54:39] you can't decide that
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:43] you need to deal with the issue
[54:48] well i'll just be this deal with the
[54:50] issue why
[54:52] settle for a partial deliverance
[54:55] because there's no such thing you want a
[54:58] total deliverance
[55:00] and there is a total deliverance in
[55:03] jesus christ
[55:10] [Music]
[55:11] and they said we have not heard
[55:15] whether there be any holy ghost or not
[55:20] you see the atonement had not been
[55:22] preached to them
[55:24] it had been preached that this is the
[55:27] atonement
[55:28] this is right on this is jesus
[55:31] jesus is matching their scriptures
[55:34] remember
[55:34] apollos their pastor was proving
[55:38] that the message was the message of the
[55:40] hour i mean that christ
[55:42] are you helping me now that christ
[55:45] indeed was the fulfillment
[55:50] but they needed to know the token has
[55:52] come
[55:55] this is what paul is dealing with we
[55:57] don't know
[55:58] no man after the flesh anymore
[56:01] just to know the word is to know the
[56:03] flesh
[56:05] but you've got to go beyond the veil
[56:08] you've got to go
[56:09] into the word by one spirit we are
[56:12] baptized into
[56:13] the word you've got to go into the land
[56:17] it's in the air is where our inheritance
[56:20] lays
[56:22] powers letting them know our inheritance
[56:24] is revealed
[56:25] by the power of the holy ghost the true
[56:28] atonement
[56:29] that comes back and lets you and i know
[56:32] that this
[56:33] is for you i am your portion
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:36] [Music]
[56:38] hallelujah glory be to god
[56:43] therefore if any man be in christ he's a
[56:46] new creature
[56:47] old things are passed away behold all
[56:49] things are become new
[56:50] and all things are of god
[56:53] well i wish i could preach on that right
[56:55] now hallelujah this is not your work
[57:00] are you with me this is not your efforts
[57:04] you see the spirit of god it deals with
[57:06] your life in justification
[57:08] and sanctification but what you're doing
[57:11] he is
[57:12] working and equipping you in preparation
[57:15] for the finishing and the capping of
[57:18] your life
[57:18] it's him working all along but now once
[57:21] he
[57:22] comes fully into you through a full
[57:24] surrender
[57:25] it's not your efforts any longer it's
[57:28] not a wrestling
[57:29] the battle has been won
[57:33] the battle that was won and gethsemane
[57:37] that battle that's raging within you
[57:40] he comes to settle that bound
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] then you got the soldier on the inside
[57:53] then you've got greater is he that is in
[57:55] me than he that's in the world
[57:57] then you've got i can do all things
[57:58] through christ who stresses me
[58:02] all things are of god
[58:08] who hath reconciled us
[58:12] to himself by jesus christ
[58:17] and hath given to us the ministry
[58:21] of reconciliation
[58:25] that ministry of reconciliation is
[58:29] his work his spirit
[58:32] by his word continuing his
[58:36] same work the works that i do
[58:39] shall you do also
[58:43] it's a continuation it's a ministry of
[58:46] reconciliation
[58:48] what is the word doing the word the
[58:51] ministry of reconciliation
[58:52] doesn't try to reconcile us to a church
[58:57] that's what a church tries to do sign
[58:59] your name right here that won't do you a
[59:01] bit of good
[59:02] you need more than ballpoint pen to take
[59:04] away your sin debt
[59:07] income never erase it you can try to
[59:10] scratch it out
[59:11] blot it out you can use white out white
[59:13] tape everything
[59:14] it'll never do the trick there's only
[59:17] one
[59:18] thing that can take away sin and that's
[59:21] the blood of jesus christ
[59:25] once you've been once you have believed
[59:27] then you can start
[59:28] and you start yielding and then the
[59:30] blood starts working
[59:33] you say how do i know the blood's
[59:35] working on me brother samuel
[59:36] i i still find myself out of battle but
[59:39] you know that blood's working
[59:40] there's things that you want you once
[59:43] could not surrender
[59:45] but you surrendering it there's things
[59:47] little
[59:48] by little that god's dealing with your
[59:50] life
[59:51] you find things fleeing and going it
[59:54] ain't you trying to quit things
[59:56] it's those things quitting you oh i feel
[59:58] like preaching
[1:00:00] it ain't you quitting it's the holy
[1:00:03] spirit
[1:00:04] equipping you and what's happening
[1:00:06] you're being reconciled
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:11] he's getting that old nature that spirit
[1:00:14] to line up with him there's a
[1:00:16] reconciling
[1:00:17] not with that old nature he's trolling
[1:00:20] it
[1:00:20] to a place of death
[1:00:23] that the new man might come forth
[1:00:31] this is what the ministry of
[1:00:32] reconciliation is
[1:00:36] on the day of atonement when the blood
[1:00:38] was shed
[1:00:42] and the jubilee was sounded
[1:00:45] it was a priest that would ride
[1:00:46] throughout the land and that priest
[1:00:48] would take that rand's horn
[1:00:51] and he would announce by blowing
[1:00:54] the rams horn for those who were in the
[1:00:58] fields
[1:00:59] and couldn't see the blood that was shed
[1:01:02] they didn't hear the lamb quivering but
[1:01:05] the
[1:01:06] sound let them know the blood has been
[1:01:09] shed for you
[1:01:10] the sound let them know that your debt
[1:01:14] has been paid
[1:01:15] the sound let them know you can go
[1:01:18] free you don't have to barter with that
[1:01:22] spirit
[1:01:23] run down you don't have to negotiate
[1:01:26] throw it down say i'm done with you
[1:01:31] i'm finished with you devil amen
[1:01:38] glory be to god i'm telling you it's not
[1:01:41] the sound of brother samuel
[1:01:43] neither am i the ram's horn but that
[1:01:45] ramshorn
[1:01:46] of the vindicated word in this hour that
[1:01:49] jesus christ
[1:01:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:54] brother he is right here among us
[1:01:57] that same one to stand for you
[1:02:07] [Music]
[1:02:14] you can receive that here this morning
[1:02:16] there's not a devil that can remain
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:26] he's conquered he's
[1:02:29] nothing but a bluff
[1:02:32] he's lying to you accept the word
[1:02:35] that speaks and proclaims liberty
[1:02:38] doubt your doubts and believe the word
[1:02:44] this is redemption of sons and daughters
[1:02:47] of god
[1:02:51] to it i'm trying to close on this to it
[1:02:54] that god was in christ notice to wit
[1:02:57] that god was in christ reconciling the
[1:03:00] world
[1:03:00] unto himself not imputing their
[1:03:03] trespasses unto them
[1:03:05] and have committed unto us the word
[1:03:08] of reconciliation this is a word
[1:03:12] of atonement amen a word
[1:03:16] that's able you can walk into here and
[1:03:18] hear you in christ
[1:03:19] are standing as two but this is a word
[1:03:22] that's able to bring such a reconciling
[1:03:24] to where when you walk out of here
[1:03:26] you're no longer twain but you walk out
[1:03:28] one
[1:03:31] it's a power of this word drawing you
[1:03:34] beyond your unbelief
[1:03:36] drawing you beyond your doubts
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:39] drawing you beyond your past that's not
[1:03:42] really you
[1:03:43] that's not who you really are that's why
[1:03:46] the word
[1:03:47] it deals with your life it's letting you
[1:03:49] know and that's why you feel
[1:03:50] uncomfortable
[1:03:51] that's why sin is no longer comfortable
[1:03:54] that's why you look at drinking and
[1:03:55] saying
[1:03:56] why do i have to keep doing this i hate
[1:03:58] this i don't want to keep on doing this
[1:04:00] it's because there's a god who's calling
[1:04:02] to you
[1:04:03] and let you know i have set you free
[1:04:10] not just of drunkenness not just of
[1:04:12] alcohol
[1:04:13] but a god who set you free from your old
[1:04:17] nature
[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:23] it's the same god to it just as god
[1:04:27] was in christ so is the fullness
[1:04:31] of the godhead of bodily in his bride
[1:04:34] body
[1:04:35] continuing on the work sounding the
[1:04:38] trumpet
[1:04:39] proclaiming the acceptable year of the
[1:04:41] lord
[1:04:42] let me just tell you we're in the season
[1:04:45] right now
[1:04:46] this is not just a calling of the soul
[1:04:49] it's not just that of bringing us into a
[1:04:52] place
[1:04:52] of a complete birth but brother this
[1:04:55] this word
[1:04:56] it leads us clear into the very change
[1:04:59] of the body
[1:05:03] we're standing
[1:05:06] we're standing where the prophets have
[1:05:09] longed to stand
[1:05:11] [Music]
[1:05:13] we're standing in the place where
[1:05:16] brother branham said
[1:05:17] i hope i'm alive to see him
[1:05:31] the word is at work
[1:05:36] he's reconciling hearts to himself
[1:05:40] he sent his word and his word will not
[1:05:43] return
[1:05:43] back to him void hallelujah
[1:05:47] he's come to call you home
[1:05:50] he's come to call you home
[1:05:54] let me just say this look close
[1:06:00] paul would let them know in that day in
[1:06:02] the book of romans
[1:06:04] the word that's being preached
[1:06:07] the word that's being spoken as we read
[1:06:09] right here
[1:06:14] he's declaring to them
[1:06:17] more scripture we could we could
[1:06:19] continue to read through but
[1:06:20] you come to this place he has obtained
[1:06:23] his inheritance
[1:06:25] and he's the one that has come to divide
[1:06:28] to us
[1:06:30] our inheritance it's
[1:06:33] our allotted portion
[1:06:36] in him in the word
[1:06:41] this is why when the world says
[1:06:45] who are you what church do you belong to
[1:06:49] i'm a christian well yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:06:52] so am i well where do you go to church

[1:06:59] organization is that
[1:07:01] well we're not an organization you're
[1:07:04] not an organization

[1:07:08] or non-denomination right
[1:07:13] we believe all the word comma
[1:07:16] and all he will continue to reveal
[1:07:20] we're not stopping we're not taking some
[1:07:23] man's name
[1:07:24] yeah i don't want to be identified by
[1:07:27] the name of an organization
[1:07:29] right now some people have called us
[1:07:34] branamites i got ran down like that the
[1:07:36] very first job that i had

[1:07:48] that scripture you know first john 3
[1:07:53] beloved what manner of love the father
[1:07:55] hath bestowed on us
[1:07:57] that we should be called the sons of god
[1:07:59] for the world knew him not even so he
[1:08:01] knoweth us not that's right
[1:08:07] but if you're going to call me abrahamic
[1:08:08] because i followed this message
[1:08:10] so be it that's right but this message
[1:08:13] is not
[1:08:14] a man this message is the person
[1:08:17] of jesus christ revealed
[1:08:20] amen say what you want to say
[1:08:25] everything i'm a christian
[1:08:31] hallelujah and it's because of this
[1:08:33] message that god sent
[1:08:34] yes it's the spirit of atonement
[1:08:38] that has come to bring the true
[1:08:41] atonement in full view
[1:08:43] this is why are you is it okay this is
[1:08:46] why
[1:08:47] the preaching is not is not just to say
