[26:36] you this evening
[26:37] you'll turn with me to colossians
[26:39] chapter 1 and say it it's good to be
[26:43] back home and we certainly appreciate
[26:45] your prayers while we were way there and
[26:47] in the meetings there in virginia and
[26:51] just had just such a just a wonderful
[26:54] time in the presence of god just to see
[26:59] the continuity of the holy spirit just
[27:02] coming through and you know you you
[27:05] always expect god to move if you don't
[27:10] expect God to move in we're in trouble
[27:13] but nonetheless when he does move and
[27:16] how he moves it still leaves you in all
[27:20] and I'm glad I hope that never I don't
[27:23] ever want that to leave I always want to
[27:26] be expecting but always just to see him
[27:28] move and just such a special way just
[27:32] many many hearts and lives that were
[27:34] were touched and dedicated to the Lord
[27:37] within within the services and
[27:39] so we just we want to say we thank God
[27:42] for that and I Prix certainly appreciate
[27:44] your prayers while we were there and on
[27:46] our way home verse 23 of Colossians 1
[27:53] when I go back to this reading of
[27:55] scripture Paul said if ye continue in
[28:00] the faith grounded and settled and be
[28:06] not moved away from the hope of the
[28:09] gospel which he have heard which was
[28:13] preached to every creature which is
[28:15] under heaven where of I Paul and made a
[28:20] minister who now rejoice in my
[28:25] sufferings for you and fill up that
[28:29] which is behind of the afflictions of
[28:32] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[28:37] which is the church amen
[28:41] may God bless you mrs. where does your
[28:44] being seated then say it is good I heard
[28:47] that on the announcements good to see
[28:49] brother herb here and then man how the
[28:53] Lord has just touched on our brother and
[28:56] we just want to continue to hold him a
[28:57] prayer and sister kress amen it's good
[29:00] to see you sister amen we want to
[29:04] continue to look here at this scripture
[29:08] and you know I I don't know there's
[29:10] things sometimes that you read within
[29:12] the Word of God and it grips you and yet
[29:15] God has it for a special time or
[29:18] reserved in a certain time and then
[29:20] there's times where the Lord will begin
[29:23] to go through things but then there's
[29:24] always a time there's seasons where God
[29:26] will take things that are very familiar
[29:28] pathways to us but boy they're so
[29:31] precious to us and they're things that
[29:33] God just speaks to us real personal in
[29:35] those times and I believe that's how it
[29:37] is many times you know you might hear a
[29:39] song and it might go through a season in
[29:41] your life you you hear a song and those
[29:43] words really ministered to you and then
[29:45] there can come maybe months years will
[29:47] pass in your life and then all of a
[29:49] sudden that song will come across again
[29:50] you know a certain time and it'll
[29:52] minister
[29:53] to you again even in a month even in a
[29:55] much deeper way than even what it did
[29:58] before but it has a meaning to you by by
[30:01] experiences and I believe that's the
[30:02] same way it is with the Word of God when
[30:04] we're we're looking at this here and and
[30:07] Paul you know he's expressing that the
[30:11] sufferings himself that he was enduring
[30:14] he let it be known he said that these
[30:16] sufferings are for you he wasn't trying
[30:18] to make the people of God feel bad or
[30:21] feel sorry that's not at all what Paul
[30:23] was was getting to but there was a
[30:25] display that was to be lived because
[30:28] when we've looked at this here a few
[30:30] services where Paul could say that truly
[30:33] the signs of apostle were were wrought
[30:35] among you in all patience and then in
[30:39] signs and wonders and so forth it really
[30:42] wouldn't have been as effectual if it
[30:45] had just been signs and wonders and
[30:47] Paul's life would not have been a
[30:49] grounded established life you see the
[30:52] the real effectual part went on when I
[30:55] look at this the message that God has
[30:57] given to us and I I look at statements
[30:59] that brother Branham will make when
[31:01] he'll speak of how that God will even so
[31:03] fix that the nature of the man for that
[31:08] age to catch the people of age and I
[31:10] begin to see that as it travels on down
[31:12] then I begin to see how that brother man
[31:14] will make a statement here in the church
[31:16] age book where he'll speak of how that
[31:18] the example of how that God uses the
[31:21] messenger is an example of what God
[31:23] desires to do for every believer now we
[31:27] understand that within all of us we all
[31:29] have our part in our place you know I I
[31:31] think when brother Branham was he was
[31:33] talking with sister Shikari in him
[31:35] she said brother Branham she said I pray
[31:37] and fast and pray and fast she said and
[31:39] I still can't cast out Devils he said
[31:41] since that one in your part
[31:43] he said your part was to pray and fast
[31:45] God's got somebody else to cast out the
[31:47] devil's you see every one of us have our
[31:50] part within it there there's certain
[31:52] things and begin certain gifts and
[31:54] talents and things that God has so
[31:56] allotted to you that God has not allowed
[31:59] and maybe to another person but that's
[32:01] how God puts it all together and that's
[32:03] for His glory you know when it is God
[32:06] never
[32:06] set up his body and to think of just
[32:08] this term body God never set up his body
[32:11] so then it would just be one man but we
[32:14] know that it is one man and that's the
[32:16] one man Christ Jesus and yet we
[32:18] recognize within it God could have taken
[32:21] each one of them in the book of Acts and
[32:23] I always look at the example with Philip
[32:25] Philip went down and preached the gospel
[32:27] Devils were cast out sick were healed
[32:29] and then God catches Philip away and has
[32:32] him to go on down here to a eunuch one
[32:35] man and he catches him away and you
[32:38] would look at it and you would you know
[32:40] just carnally thinking we would say well
[32:42] why did God take Philip away when these
[32:44] people had not even come to the full
[32:47] depth of the new birth and and been
[32:49] filled with the Holy Ghost but you see
[32:51] God was declaring that this is not a
[32:55] one-man movement this is a body ministry
[32:59] and and you see that's the heart of
[33:01] every messenger and every under
[33:04] messenger like we look at a pepra Titus
[33:06] last week
[33:07] it's the hearts desire is that the body
[33:10] itself would be under the leadership and
[33:12] the direction of the Holy Ghost that was
[33:15] the prophets desire to be able to see
[33:17] this word that this word would take
[33:20] flesh in our lives then it would not
[33:22] just be something that you and I would
[33:24] sit around and we could talk about and
[33:27] and you you could finish this quote and
[33:29] you could say this it wasn't about that
[33:31] at all but the word that has been given
[33:34] to you and I here's a word that was to
[33:36] set our hearts on fire a word to put us
[33:39] in action a word to bring humility a
[33:42] word to bring repentance and put us for
[33:45] it to carry out and finish out this last
[33:48] great comission it's a work of God this
[33:51] is not a work of man it's not a man
[33:54] that's orchestrating and remember many
[33:56] times I'm brother Ram will say said it's
[33:58] not me
[33:59] he said it's I can't do anything he said
[34:01] but I have to wait on him there are many
[34:04] things many different ones that brother
[34:06] Branham he wanted to actually go and see
[34:10] healed he he wanted the ange of the Lord
[34:12] to come over top of him and say yeah I
[34:14] pronounce you're healed one of them you
[34:15] know just by
[34:17] sister Edith right sister Hattie's his
[34:20] sister had his uh sister remember that
[34:22] brother ban talks about how that here
[34:24] she was born with him infant para
[34:26] paralysis and yet how she had so much
[34:29] pain about her life and then brother bam
[34:31] begins to talk about how that he prayed
[34:33] for her and her pain left her but yet
[34:35] she still in that paralyzed condition
[34:38] and how that she continued on in her
[34:40] life and brother Ram
[34:41] he even pours his heart on it said I've
[34:43] wanted to see the Ange of the Lord come
[34:45] above her to where I can say to her he's
[34:47] not and your paralysis is no more he
[34:49] said but see I can't do anything unless
[34:51] he himself is the one who first directs
[34:54] it now sometimes to our human mind our
[34:57] thinking we would look at that and think
[34:59] you know just to the carnal way of
[35:01] thinking that well maybe eat us and meet
[35:03] in more faith but you got to understand
[35:05] this that God's gonna have testimonies
[35:07] all around that there's people that
[35:10] don't have to have everything good and
[35:12] everything just right but they are so in
[35:15] love and in tune with the Lord Jesus
[35:17] Christ
[35:18] till the other things of life take
[35:20] second priority its Christ who is the
[35:22] saves the main and the center priority
[35:25] whether I feel let whether I feel down
[35:27] its Christ no doubt about it with me
[35:31] know with sister Eaters and I look at
[35:33] things like that you know because
[35:34] sometimes we you know can get in our
[35:37] minds a certain way but we it's always
[35:39] important that we keep what we're
[35:40] looking at and we funneled it right
[35:42] through the word and bring it all the
[35:44] way through and I'm so thankful to God
[35:46] in this hour because when I look at the
[35:48] message to me when I see the message it
[35:51] is a very revealing of the very nature
[35:53] of God
[35:54] there's nothing less than that the
[35:56] Prophet told us that when the seals were
[35:58] open he said it would be the very nature
[36:00] of God coming on display and we
[36:03] recognize that to be true it it brought
[36:05] Christ the mighty Conqueror in full view
[36:08] of you and I as the believer and here
[36:11] Paul is standing you know here's Paul to
[36:14] think about this now Paul and his life
[36:17] the sufferings that he had the
[36:18] sufferings that Paul realized that the
[36:20] things Paul seen these things that I'm
[36:23] enduring Paul was letting it if I was
[36:26] letting it be known I really don't have
[36:27] to endure these things
[36:29] I really don't have to suffer I could
[36:32] sit down and there would be no suffering
[36:34] I could be quiet there would be nothing
[36:37] paul was letting in no but the reason
[36:39] that I'm doing it is because he said the
[36:42] burden and the fire that God has put in
[36:46] my heart to carry this gospel and I
[36:48] believe that that's not just something
[36:50] that's confined to Paul or the ministers
[36:53] of the gospel I believe that's that way
[36:54] for every believer you we all must have
[36:57] that same fire and that same burden in
[36:59] that same zeal and that same desire is
[37:02] to see the gospel that the gospel itself
[37:05] would go on if we don't live to the
[37:07] coming of the Lord but at least our life
[37:10] has been a part of the advancement of
[37:12] the gospel of Jesus Christ that's our
[37:16] desire that ought to be our desire every
[37:18] day Lord let me live such a life better
[37:20] little Vance the gospel of Jesus Christ
[37:24] Philip Paul realized that he had he had
[37:27] he'd ever there was a measure of
[37:28] suffering and Paul knew this he knew
[37:31] there was a measure of suffering that
[37:32] was left to him and you know brother
[37:34] Branham picks it up like this and he's
[37:36] talks about how that he's picked up
[37:39] about Johnny Appleseed and most of you
[37:41] know that the real name of that is
[37:43] Jonathan Chapman and there's a lot of
[37:46] things there's museums here in Ohio
[37:48] that's actually wrote about that museums
[37:50] for him and you look at how brother Rams
[37:53] talking about he said how every man he
[37:55] said you know you like to look down
[37:56] through your ministry you like to look
[37:57] down through the times and you like to
[38:00] see seeds that have been sown and you
[38:02] you like to see things that are coming
[38:04] forth you like to see fruit and but then
[38:06] he likens it the same way to the man who
[38:09] was in Sweden and he said there's also a
[38:10] story about a man who lived in Sweden he
[38:13] said to where he went around he liked
[38:15] flowers so he sold flowers seeds and
[38:19] grounds that would take it he said and
[38:20] now after the man has been gone he said
[38:23] but yet them flowers live on so he's
[38:27] talking about things that you know
[38:29] they're seeds there's life there's
[38:31] things that that are done that will will
[38:33] long live after us and he goes on he
[38:35] says that's what we all like to see
[38:37] that's something that we've done that
[38:39] would cause others to benefit
[38:43] by what we have done we want others to
[38:47] benefit by what we have done and I think
[38:52] brother branham he's in this is in this
[38:54] a message here and he's he he goes into
[38:56] a conversation that he and dr. Sam Adair
[38:59] his friend that they have had and
[39:01] brother Branham is is talking about this
[39:04] of how that he said you know I don't
[39:06] know how much longer I've got to live
[39:07] Duncan and and you know the doctor said
[39:10] yeah he said that you you know for his
[39:11] self he said and they begin to talk
[39:12] about how many patients he had seen that
[39:14] morning and brother brems talking about
[39:16] the services and then brother Brown
[39:18] makes a statement and this is where I'll
[39:20] start quoting to you brother brems said
[39:22] the greatest thrill that I that I have
[39:25] is living for others the greatest thrill
[39:30] I have is living for others now tell you
[39:35] our age is not or every any age was
[39:39] never exempt from this but every age
[39:42] itself the pressures every age had
[39:45] pressures every age had pressures there
[39:48] was a spirit for every age and the
[39:52] Spirit of God the only thing that could
[39:54] withstand that spirit that that spirit
[39:56] of the world that characteristic of the
[39:58] age the only thing that could withstand
[39:59] it is the Holy Spirit and God would
[40:03] deliver his life flow to the children of
[40:07] God God is committed to his word and I
[40:11] mean God being committed to his word he
[40:14] will not fail and you and I are a part
[40:18] of that word we become the Express part
[40:21] of it when that life has sought us out
[40:24] and that life has moved on the inside
[40:26] then it's no longer you trying to keep
[40:29] something but it now is the same god
[40:32] that has drawn you living and keeping
[40:36] his word and it's promised through your
[40:38] life
[40:39] it holds you it's an anchor it's a
[40:42] stability that even when we deal with
[40:45] and we fight against the spirit of this
[40:48] age you know the spirit of this age I'm
[40:50] sure probably most of us could recite it
[40:52] by heart
[40:53] it's soft easy live
[40:56] where everything itself that it's always
[40:59] looking you catch people you know I I
[41:01] think we're not when I taught school man
[41:03] you'd catch people sitting around you
[41:04] know after times and they would start
[41:06] thinking about retirement and they had
[41:08] only been teaching ten years I thought
[41:10] this is foolish I mean this is silly man
[41:13] I I mean who in the world wants to even
[41:15] count on that for ten years you might
[41:17] not be able to retire to your seventy
[41:18] what yeah I looked at things like that
[41:20] about what what good does that do
[41:22] just set around like that I'm not
[41:24] putting people down friends but it's
[41:26] such an age where things that you see it
[41:28] they talk about it they talk about I
[41:30] think what is it now the Millennials and
[41:31] things like and they they talk about
[41:33] different ones they say man you can't
[41:34] hardly get them to work and can't hardly
[41:36] to get them to do certain things and
[41:38] they don't want to they don't want to be
[41:39] committed on things like let me tell you
[41:41] what that is that's a spirit of this age
[41:43] there's things that come around there's
[41:45] little things here and there that has
[41:47] actually been seeds that's even been set
[41:50] in for this time seeds that have been
[41:52] sown way on back but in the midst of it
[41:55] all I believe that what God has said in
[41:57] his word that God never had to put a
[41:59] footnote and said this will apply except
[42:02] when it gets too hard but I believe with
[42:05] all my heart that the same Holy Ghost
[42:07] that moved on the prophets and moved on
[42:10] them to write it I believe that he is
[42:12] still in the heart of the believer
[42:14] manifesting himself has the triumphant
[42:17] Christ in the midst of the darkness in
[42:19] the midst of the oppression he still
[42:22] declares that he himself is the one who
[42:25] has spoke that word and he keeps that
[42:28] word he'll fulfill it in our lives I
[42:30] believe that was on my heart I believe
[42:34] that life itself then we come across you
[42:38] know when we look at life itself
[42:41] there ain't nothing easy about life get
[42:46] your grass mowed today where don't try
[42:50] it today it was wet outside but getting
[42:52] mowed the other day guess what it'll be
[42:54] ready for you in a few days
[42:55] oh the grass is green enough in nothing
[43:01] in this life ever comes to a place to
[43:03] where it's just set there's a constant
[43:07] constant
[43:09] going on it's in this life that we have
[43:13] no continuing City you buy a car now you
[43:16] wait a few years and rest spots come in
[43:18] it right you buy a house and whatever
[43:22] more build a house whatever it is you
[43:24] you go and you do all of that and yet
[43:26] they're a little give it time and there
[43:27] will be things that you have to do it
[43:33] don't matter how much and I think it's
[43:34] something that's good for us to take
[43:35] care of those things but we understand
[43:37] that life itself it's not meant to be
[43:40] easy but relieved and goes on this says
[43:43] it like this he says that's what life is
[43:45] and what makes life real not what you
[43:49] can do or accomplish for yourself
[43:51] but what you can do for others see
[43:56] that's when you're really living and if
[43:59] there happens to be someone among us who
[44:01] has never did that try to live for
[44:04] somebody else give that a try and just
[44:07] see how much more life holds for you
[44:09] when you will not live for what you can
[44:12] get yourself out of life but what you
[44:14] can give someone else in life now
[44:18] remember what how we were looking at
[44:19] that last week in that day at Calvary
[44:22] blue brand was monitoring us that we
[44:24] must remember that we are sons of God
[44:27] that he immodest us by the Spirit of God
[44:30] to live for those not just for those
[44:33] that's easy to live for but live for
[44:36] those as he said that man who would hate
[44:39] you or that man who would kill you are
[44:41] living for them and why he said to live
[44:43] for them is so that you might redeem
[44:46] them good over to be to God you know
[44:52] sometimes there's a lot of things that
[44:53] you got to hear and I don't mean gotta
[44:56] hear but sometimes there's things that
[44:58] you have to kind of be able to weed
[45:00] through and wait through a lot of
[45:02] different things there's a lot of words
[45:04] that can be said a lot of things that
[45:06] just like a lot of smokescreen but I
[45:09] tell you this right now will never get
[45:11] anywhere with God by trying to live for
[45:13] ourselves if we go to brain and all of
[45:17] our problems on that the reason
[45:19] I am the way I am is because brother
[45:21] Joshua is the way is that is nonsense
[45:24] that is a cop-out and a compromise you
[45:28] are what you are in the decisions that
[45:31] you make because you make those
[45:33] decisions come on somebody if we've got
[45:36] the power of the Holy Ghost on the
[45:38] inside then don't tell me that somebody
[45:41] else has got greater authority if I'm
[45:44] not giving myself to the Holy Ghost
[45:46] something's wrong come on friends you
[45:50] see this is an age it's repeated that
[45:52] you know it's an age that well you know
[45:54] brother Joey did this so I did this and
[45:56] that that's nonsense it ain't because
[45:58] I'm doing this because brother Joey did
[46:00] this there's every man let every man
[46:03] take accountability for his own actions
[46:07] are you with me yeah it's if it comes to
[46:11] that place and that's where the living
[46:13] for others you know even where if
[46:15] somebody says something that ruffles
[46:17] your feathers it still comes to a place
[46:19] to where you're not living for your
[46:21] feathers but you're living for that or
[46:23] the person you just say Lord help my
[46:26] brother Lord help my sister Lord I'm
[46:30] talking about somebody who's anchored
[46:33] let me tell you something in order to
[46:36] endure tests and trials you got to be
[46:38] anchored you got to be anchored you've
[46:43] got to be anchored in the Lord Jesus
[46:44] Christ to where that any nothing else
[46:47] matters and you're able to have that
[46:50] discernment to catch those things and
[46:52] say you know what this is trying to sort
[46:55] and stunt my growth I will not and I
[46:58] refuse to have any part in it but as
[47:02] Samuel how is that suffering hey
[47:03] suffering is also coming and bringing
[47:05] the word that brings it right to the
[47:07] attention glory be to God you'll find
[47:15] that it's more blessed than riches that
[47:18] can be thought of what you can do for
[47:20] someone else to make life's burdens now
[47:23] this ain't about what making what's easy
[47:25] for me and what's easy for you you know
[47:29] this ain't about you give me your old
[47:30] raggedy shirt because you're getting
[47:31] ready to take it to the goodwill
[47:34] but saying I was just thinking of you
[47:36] you was not come on somebody this ain't
[47:43] about what things are easy for us this
[47:47] was not easy for Paul this was a part of
[47:49] living out the gospel which life in
[47:56] itself is a burden he will make it a
[48:00] light a light a little lighter for
[48:02] someone else you just don't know the joy
[48:05] unless you tried it once to do something
[48:08] for someone else brother BAM goes on in
[48:13] another message here faith in the Son of
[48:15] God let me just read this before we move
[48:16] on in he said each day I want to live
[48:20] not for myself if I live for myself I
[48:26] live a selfish life you know you can go
[48:33] to praying about something a need that
[48:35] you have in your life and we know the
[48:38] word we know how we're beckoned ask the
[48:42] father anything of my name and I'll do
[48:44] it but I believe there's witnesses in
[48:48] here just besides me that has found that
[48:51] the more that I brought up my need the
[48:56] more silent it's become anybody else are
[48:59] found that but when I go to start
[49:02] forgetting about my need and start
[49:05] praying for the other means now I'm
[49:10] telling you I pray for the other needs
[49:12] report for the church but I'm talking
[49:14] about friends where it comes to a place
[49:16] to where I do want to get something from
[49:18] God in this service don't you but at the
[49:21] same time I want to be able to set in
[49:23] such a place to where there's an
[49:25] atmosphere that's created to where if
[49:27] God only brings a little my way I hope
[49:31] he feels the other brothers sister that
[49:34] has a need God fill them with a
[49:35] dumptruck of it Lord God for what they
[49:38] have need of because we're here
[49:41] NEADS because it might be your prayer
[49:43] when there's something that that other
[49:45] person is going through but yet as
[49:47] you're sitting there and you're praying
[49:48] and you're looking to God you watch God
[49:50] come by and not only will that need to
[49:53] be met but you'll find your answer for
[49:57] your need comes right down you see if
[50:02] we're not careful within our lives we've
[50:04] become self-centered and the gospel is
[50:09] not about self-centered the gospel is
[50:12] Christ centered and with being Christ
[50:15] centered his body it takes precedence
[50:19] over us because his body we we want to
[50:24] make sure that we're looking for his
[50:26] body this is what Paul is talking about
[50:28] that fill up the sufferings for his body
[50:31] sake the church well recognize that this
[50:35] suffering and that was taking place for
[50:37] the body was for the glory of God and
[50:41] this suffering was for Christ if I live
[50:47] for myself I live a selfish life I want
[50:50] to live for others and give what
[50:52] strength I have not to myself and to my
[50:55] own pleasure but for the benefit of
[50:58] others that'll build the kingdom of God
[51:02] remember how brother Bram talked Joe
[51:04] told us about the thought Aaron AIDS was
[51:06] such a dark age and how God commended
[51:10] the believers in that age in such a time
[51:13] of Darkness but yet it is so well spoken
[51:17] of where God recognizes their work and
[51:20] labor of love but RAM tells us he said
[51:23] no it was so dark the believers in that
[51:27] time he said they labored even the more
[51:31] fervently he said their labored this is
[51:34] what he said he said their labor was not
[51:36] for Paul but their labor was for Christ
[51:39] who had been revealed and made manifest
[51:42] through the ministry of Paul so you see
[51:45] they had become in contact with that
[51:47] living Christ and here they were though
[51:50] the darkness was so great but they were
[51:53] labored that much
[51:54] more fervently now I look here in the
[51:58] time it's always about building the
[52:00] kingdom of God if we can just keep that
[52:02] that term and that thought it's about
[52:04] building what I do is it building is it
[52:09] building the kingdom of God I tell you
[52:12] that's one that's one thing that you'd
[52:14] look at with with brother Branham in
[52:16] this hour that was his desire was to
[52:18] build the kingdom of God if there's
[52:20] anybody that could have had a millions
[52:23] and billions a a billion dollar ministry
[52:26] he could have he could have taken the
[52:29] God the gift that God entrusted him with
[52:31] and used it for his own means but I want
[52:34] you to think about it even when he was
[52:35] laying there on that Texas Highway he
[52:39] said it's not for me I tell you that's
[52:46] the kind of life that brought this
[52:48] gospel I believe with all my heart that
[52:52] I'm looking at and I'm one of them of
[52:54] people who have that same kind of heart
[52:57] it's not because of some good breeding
[53:00] that we had in our life we had a great
[53:02] up ring no that's not what it is it's
[53:03] because that we were ordained and
[53:06] planted in this bed of time and when
[53:08] this word is reached down into our life
[53:11] you're willing to sell out everything
[53:14] and delay hold on that pearl of great
[53:17] price it means more to you than anything
[53:20] else
[53:21] hate to tell you the truth I could
[53:23] probably many of you in here would have
[53:25] never darkened the church church door
[53:27] you've seen so much hypocrisy and things
[53:30] down through the years and other things
[53:32] like that but what was it that got your
[53:34] attention not a church what got your
[53:37] attention was Jesus Christ being
[53:40] manifested by the promise of his word
[53:44] hallelujah he shipped that promise in
[53:47] front of you and I and it spared you and
[53:50] I to a place to say that I can help
[53:52] that same resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[53:55] I believe I'm a part of that
[54:00] glory be to God
[54:04] here's Paul Maya in acts 18 Paul here I
[54:10] made have to skip a few verses to get to
[54:12] some places but I want you to watch how
[54:15] Paul here he is God using Paul in acts
[54:18] 18 one he departs from Athens and he
[54:22] comes to Corinth it goes on here let me
[54:26] just skip over verse 2 and verse 3 and
[54:28] verse 4 and go to verse 5 the Bible said
[54:31] when Silas and timotheus were come from
[54:33] Macedonia Paul was pressed in the spirit
[54:36] and testified to the Jews that Jesus was
[54:38] Christ here was Paul in the synagogue
[54:42] for a period of time but yet he had not
[54:46] turned loose yet here is all this that
[54:51] was bottled up within him to testify
[54:53] that Jesus was the Christ
[54:55] but there came a moment where the spirit
[54:59] itself pressed him and said testify of
[55:01] it now there's no doubt about it Paul
[55:04] was going through prophecies in the
[55:06] scriptures with him then to see how God
[55:09] so arranges everything and I I don't
[55:12] want to dwell so much on that but notice
[55:14] in verse 6 the Bible says when they
[55:15] opposed themselves these were the Jews
[55:18] and blaspheme he shook his raiment and
[55:22] said unto them your blood be upon your
[55:24] heads I am clean from henceforth I will
[55:28] go unto the Gentiles and he departed
[55:32] fence and entered into a certain man's
[55:34] house named justice one that worshipped
[55:36] God whose house joined hard to the
[55:39] synagogue this guy was in a dangerous
[55:41] place justice was in a dangerous place
[55:44] his house joined hard to the synagogue
[55:47] is right there
[55:48] and here Paul finds refuge finds comfort
[55:54] in this man's house this man worships
[55:59] God now think about how God has all this
[56:02] placed here Paul goes into this house
[56:05] and then he goes on to say how that
[56:07] Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue
[56:10] lived on the Lord with all his house and
[56:14] many of the Corinthians hearing believed
[56:18] and were baptized now think now directly
[56:23] the Jews themselves were withstanding
[56:26] this gospel I mean when you would
[56:30] express the gospel to somebody you're
[56:33] not there the joy that you have is not
[56:35] somebody rejecting it your desire is
[56:39] that they would come to that same
[56:42] knowledge to that same place and that
[56:45] they themselves would come to know him
[56:47] has the Living God so to think about
[56:52] this here is Paul now what you think of
[56:53] this every turn was not a turn where as
[56:58] soon as Paul spoke people were turning
[57:00] to the Lord you know contrary to that
[57:03] there were many places that Paul spoke
[57:06] that they would try to stay tried to
[57:08] kill him
[57:08] there were times when then how that it
[57:11] would be known among the Brethren they
[57:12] would let him down in a basket they
[57:14] weren't comfortable he wasn't being let
[57:17] down in a Ford Lincoln basket than ever
[57:19] say it wasn't comfortable and think
[57:23] about it think about how that maybe that
[57:25] could have even been thought to the
[57:27] coward to the to the mind why Paul he's
[57:29] cowardly if he's a man of God he just
[57:31] oughta storm right out the gate and what
[57:33] but see God leads his children God leads
[57:39] his children he knows exactly what to do
[57:45] glory be to God you see within it here I
[57:50] wonder how Paul was in the midst of this
[57:52] time no doubt Paul would have you know
[57:55] been ready to depart after so long a
[57:57] time but notice in verse 9 I love this
[57:59] scripture that goes into this then spake
[58:02] the Lord to Paul in the night by vision
[58:04] be not afraid
[58:08] glory know that Paul was afraid be not
[58:17] afraid
[58:18] God knows just out to address what's
[58:20] going on
[58:22] be not afraid but speak and hold not buy
[58:26] peace for I am with thee and no man
[58:31] shall set on me to hurt thee for I have
[58:34] much people in this city notice I have
[58:39] much people in the city to look at that
[58:42] city
[58:43] you wouldn't think nothing much it was
[58:45] such a city of debauchery and so much of
[58:49] a city of such violent and Citra ass in
[58:53] the city because this was a major trade
[58:55] route there was all sorts of things that
[58:59] you can read in the scripture even where
[59:01] Paul would speak to the believers and
[59:04] say some of you were effeminate some of
[59:06] you were abusers of yourself with
[59:08] mankind and somebody blowing down the
[59:10] whole list of things he said but you and
[59:13] justified but you've been sanctified
[59:17] you've been filled with the Holy Ghost
[59:20] what was it people who were in this city
[59:24] it would have been easier for Paul to
[59:28] have left but he stayed in this city
[59:34] mind you Paul was not receiving anything
[59:38] from the church when Paul was here he
[59:43] labored with his own hands as a
[59:45] tentmaker he could even bring it back to
[59:48] them and say look I have labored among
[59:51] you with my own hands now there's no
[59:55] doubt about it that other churches Paul
[59:56] makes it clear through this letters to
[59:59] the Corinthians that there were other
[1:00:00] churches that God would actually use
[1:00:03] through those things to supply the needs
[1:00:06] that were there within Paul's life but
[1:00:08] yet when you look at it why is it here
[1:00:11] in Corinth that Paul would have to work
[1:00:13] with this hands no doubt about it when
[1:00:15] you see how that God will have a
[1:00:16] testimony because when those false
[1:00:19] apostles begin to come among and false
[1:00:22] brethren those brethren were trying to
[1:00:24] bring all kinds of accusations against
[1:00:27] Paul but Paul could take the Corinthians
[1:00:29] right back to the word and say when did
[1:00:31] I ever try to profit off of you
[1:00:35] when did I ever try to make gain out of
[1:00:38] you so you got to be careful people try
[1:00:41] to gain your mind people try to gain
[1:00:45] your affections people try to gain and
[1:00:48] draw you and there's only one side that
[1:00:50] we need to stay on and that's the side
[1:00:52] of the word is that right this is the
[1:00:55] side that we must take on I'm telling
[1:00:58] you what's the truth when a voice comes
[1:01:00] and wants to present things as though
[1:01:02] there are sides to be taken that is
[1:01:04] clearly where we need to stand with
[1:01:06] discernment and recognize that's the old
[1:01:09] tongue of the devil because there's only
[1:01:11] one sad that you and I should ever be
[1:01:13] found on and that's the side of the Lord
[1:01:16] Jesus Christ not on the sides we're not
[1:01:20] here to take sides glory be to God it
[1:01:27] always amazes me because we talk about
[1:01:29] the deep mysteries of God and yet the
[1:01:31] prophet who had assert this right in the
[1:01:34] midst of Christ the mystery of God
[1:01:35] revealed very very simple directions
[1:01:39] that he would give to us as the Church
[1:01:41] of the Living God and yet what a
[1:01:43] powerhouse message it that message
[1:01:45] itself is a very unfolding of that
[1:01:48] seventh seal of Christ within your life
[1:01:50] but if you're not careful things can
[1:01:53] hinder that expression so Paul could
[1:02:00] bring it back to tell to ask the
[1:02:02] Corinthians you see God will have
[1:02:04] certain things to be done a certain way
[1:02:06] that no doubt Paul could not even fathom
[1:02:09] why he was doing what he was doing he
[1:02:11] just knew that I must labor with my
[1:02:13] hands here
[1:02:14] it didn't matter I wonder did Paul I
[1:02:17] wonder did Paul that he study
[1:02:19] differently for the Corinthian church
[1:02:21] I wonder if Paul did Paul's give himself
[1:02:23] more to the ephesian church well let me
[1:02:26] say it like this
[1:02:26] we've Paul was singing specials would
[1:02:29] Paul only sing on Sundays or we're
[1:02:30] pulsing on Thursdays too if Paul was
[1:02:34] studying to bring a message would Paul
[1:02:36] say I'll wait till Sunday or would Paul
[1:02:39] preach on Thursdays too
[1:02:42] you see it didn't matter if this was not
[1:02:45] about what was convenient he was doing
[1:02:49] this for the body watch how Paul here it
[1:02:55] goes on to say in verse 11 and he
[1:02:57] continued there a year and six months
[1:03:00] teaching the Word of God among them Paul
[1:03:07] goes on and he mentions this in
[1:03:09] Ephesians 3:1 for this cause i paul the
[1:03:14] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[1:03:18] gentiles nopal was a prisoner of jesus
[1:03:22] christ but how Paul would disclose this
[1:03:27] he said I'm a prisoner of jesus christ
[1:03:28] for you gentiles so this was not just
[1:03:31] something that paul was serving god just
[1:03:34] because of the gentiles but paul he
[1:03:37] recognizes his position he recognizes
[1:03:41] his responsibility as he goes on in
[1:03:44] through the the scriptures that go on
[1:03:46] further past this when he talks about
[1:03:48] the mystery of christ that this has been
[1:03:52] committed unto me now in this being
[1:03:56] committed to him it's evident in verse
[1:03:58] 13 of Ephesus Ephesians 3 that the
[1:04:01] people could see the sufferings and hear
[1:04:04] these things for he said wherefore I
[1:04:07] desire that you faint not at my
[1:04:12] tribulations for you which is your glory
[1:04:17] so Paul's very careful he's letting them
[1:04:21] know know and the focus is not about my
[1:04:23] tribulations the focus is not so where
[1:04:26] that you say oh my
[1:04:27] Paul oh my don't you guys just feel
[1:04:30] terrible for for Paul Paul's letter no I
[1:04:33] don't want you to faint for my
[1:04:35] tribulations these are for your glory
[1:04:39] how would it be for their glory because
[1:04:42] Paul the suffering that was coming his
[1:04:45] way yet the very revelation of Jesus
[1:04:49] Christ that mystery was
[1:04:51] being dispensed in that hour to the
[1:04:54] believers but listen not just a message
[1:04:57] that was given out but the people could
[1:04:59] look and what they were hearing they
[1:05:02] were seeing that this is a man but not
[1:05:05] only can dispense or minister but he's
[1:05:08] got an anchor in his life he's
[1:05:13] established tribulation can come his way
[1:05:16] but look where he remains see that's a
[1:05:21] great witness you see we can talk about
[1:05:23] all the mysteries we can talk about the
[1:05:25] message we can talk about all those
[1:05:27] other things but where is your life is
[1:05:30] your life rooted and grounded and
[1:05:33] established who him N where is it at it
[1:05:39] must be established I tell you what the
[1:05:49] Prophet tells us very very clearly he
[1:05:52] said how do we win our loved ones
[1:05:55] he said you be loyal to what you believe
[1:06:01] he goes through and tells us even about
[1:06:04] on the applying of the token how to
[1:06:06] apply that token applying in love
[1:06:09] applied in consideration said an
[1:06:11] atmosphere he said that they'll fall
[1:06:13] into it showing to us that this word
[1:06:18] it's an application this listen it
[1:06:21] minutes not just words and letters this
[1:06:23] is the literal life of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:28] the presence of God is not just
[1:06:30] something that's confined to this
[1:06:32] building but the presence of God he'll
[1:06:35] come down and meet with us but let me
[1:06:37] tell you something he desires to be
[1:06:40] effectual in your life daily
[1:06:44] that's his desire
[1:06:47] watch out Paul goes on here with
[1:06:49] Corinthians I'm gonna move to the second
[1:06:52] Corinthians Paul was talking about how
[1:06:54] that the people he says in verse 3 first
[1:06:58] second Corinthians one blessed be God
[1:07:00] even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:01] the father of mercies and the God of all
[1:07:04] comfort
[1:07:05] who comforted us in all our tribulation
[1:07:08] that we may be able to comfort them
[1:07:10] which are in any trouble by the comfort
[1:07:13] wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
[1:07:17] God for as the sufferings of Christ
[1:07:21] abound in us so our consolation also
[1:07:25] aboundeth by Christ whether we be
[1:07:28] afflicted it is for your consolation and
[1:07:31] salvation which is effectual in the
[1:07:40] enduring of the same sufferings which we
[1:07:44] also suffer so those moving under that
[1:07:53] word and letting the word have
[1:07:56] preeminence in their life they have a
[1:08:00] consolation by seeing what that word how
[1:08:05] it stands and it holds in the life of
[1:08:08] Paul if it's there in their heart listen
[1:08:12] if it's there in their heart nobody's
[1:08:15] going to take it out of their heart but
[1:08:17] you see what a comfort it is to be able
[1:08:19] to look and say it held the same God
[1:08:25] that held all the same God will hold me
[1:08:27] these Corinthians could say hey listen
[1:08:29] Paul didn't put god somewhere else but
[1:08:32] he brought God down to a reality but
[1:08:35] it's God inside of us they could recall
[1:08:37] remember how Paul the messenger told us
[1:08:40] that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:43] remember how he declared to us that it's
[1:08:46] God's desire to dwell inside of us so
[1:08:50] they realized God wasn't far out here
[1:08:52] they realized God was with them so you
[1:08:54] know what I could do when they would
[1:08:55] look at that word that could take
[1:08:57] comfort and rest within the same word
[1:09:00] that was strengthening and had anchored
[1:09:02] them because they went through the
[1:09:06] sufferings like Paul went through
[1:09:08] remember Paul speaks to the Thessalonica
[1:09:11] Church and he says you also suffered of
[1:09:14] your countrymen just like others have
[1:09:17] done
[1:09:18] and just what they've done to you is the
[1:09:20] same thing they did to our Lord and
[1:09:22] Savior Jesus Christ he's letting them
[1:09:24] know that that life that is held that
[1:09:27] held him as the sacrifice is the same
[1:09:30] life that's holding you Oh glory be to
[1:09:38] God can't wait to get there on that day
[1:09:41] and even meet some of these folks
[1:09:46] verse 7 and our hope of you is steadfast
[1:09:52] knowing that as ye are partakers of the
[1:09:56] sufferings so shall you be also of the
[1:09:59] consolation wait a minute our hope of
[1:10:04] you is steadfast who's he talking to
[1:10:05] is there must be the Ephesian Church
[1:10:08] must be the Galatian Church no this is
[1:10:12] second Corinthians I hope any of you is
[1:10:17] steadfast you see where pulse confidence
[1:10:21] was in the word his confidence was in
[1:10:26] that word that that word would be able
[1:10:29] to take such an effect within the hearts
[1:10:31] of the believers and bring maturity to
[1:10:34] their life did he have to speak to
[1:10:36] things within their lives that was
[1:10:38] showing signs of immaturity I'm of this
[1:10:41] one I'm of this one I'm about one I'm
[1:10:43] with this one and Paul let it be known
[1:10:44] this kind of division and childish stuff
[1:10:47] Paul knew they needed to mature but the
[1:10:51] way to mature is to bring a word not
[1:10:54] only the corrects but a word that will
[1:10:56] bring maturity and so Paul when he's
[1:10:59] looking at a steadfast hope he's not
[1:11:01] having a confidence in their flesh but
[1:11:04] it's a confidence in the word that he
[1:11:06] can have a witness you have received
[1:11:09] that word glory be to God
[1:11:13] he could even tell this same church you
[1:11:16] are the seal of my Apostleship glory be
[1:11:20] to God he didn't say that to any other
[1:11:22] Church but here he took a chance that it
[1:11:26] would look like they'll never make it
[1:11:28] they'll never this they'll never that
[1:11:29] but God
[1:11:30] let me show you I don't call the high
[1:11:33] and falutin things of this world but I
[1:11:36] call the weak and the poor and those
[1:11:38] that are the outcast but I do that that
[1:11:41] I might make know my glory that this is
[1:11:44] not a man but of the power of Almighty
[1:11:47] God
[1:11:48] hello God don't care what your strings
[1:11:53] are in your family
[1:11:54] God don't care hold the sin that's down
[1:11:56] through your family tree you are a part
[1:11:59] of another tree Alleluia if the facts of
[1:12:06] that tree can come down what about when
[1:12:09] we have been born in that tree of life
[1:12:11] then that strain of predestination can
[1:12:15] move down in our life and we can begin
[1:12:17] to look at that and say that's who I am
[1:12:20] that's what I am that's what I can
[1:12:22] expect the works that I do shall you do
[1:12:25] also hallelujah I'm talking about that
[1:12:30] tree oh my grow to be to God the branch
[1:12:43] gift to verse 12 for our rejoicing is
[1:12:47] this the testimony of our conscience
[1:12:50] then in simplicity and godly sincerity
[1:12:53] not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace
[1:12:56] of God we had our conversation in the
[1:12:58] world and more abundantly
[1:13:01] - you word they had a Paul there was a
[1:13:07] character that was on display you with
[1:13:11] me Paul was not just carrying a message
[1:13:14] it was a character from we write none of
[1:13:18] the things unto you than what you
[1:13:20] rhetoric knowledge and I trust you shall
[1:13:22] acknowledge even to the endless in this
[1:13:23] verse and yes also you have acknowledged
[1:13:26] us in part that we are your rejoicing
[1:13:30] even as ye also are ours in the day of
[1:13:35] the Lord Jesus Paul said we're your
[1:13:39] rejoicing
[1:13:42] where are your rejoicing and you are our
[1:13:45] rejoicing they could say hello your
[1:13:49] honor I'm so glad they didn't mistake
[1:13:52] Paul for Jesus but they are thankful to
[1:13:56] God Lord thank you for the messenger
[1:14:00] thank you that he was willing to count
[1:14:03] lord thank you that he was willing to go
[1:14:06] lord thank you for this word this
[1:14:09] message that has United us with you that
[1:14:12] delivered us out of the oppression of
[1:14:14] Corinth Lord
[1:14:16] Thank You Lord God thank you for this
[1:14:19] word lord thank you that you sent this
[1:14:21] word to our way oh they were saying in
[1:14:24] that day we're resting on that
[1:14:26] revelation Paul that's you bought and
[1:14:31] Paul could say on that day you will be
[1:14:35] our rejoicing amen the word came and the
[1:14:39] word produced
[1:14:41] oh my Paul goes into here in Philippians
[1:14:46] 1:21 for to me to live is Christ and to
[1:14:49] die is gain I want you to watch this for
[1:14:51] a moment we're familiar with that
[1:14:53] scripture aren't we for me to live is
[1:14:55] Christ and to die is gain
[1:14:57] Paul was letting it be known by this
[1:14:59] scripture if I'm gonna live it's for
[1:15:00] Christ if I die it's gain because I go
[1:15:04] into the presence of God so he Lenape
[1:15:07] know my living here is not gonna be
[1:15:09] about me
[1:15:10] pause lenden know I've already lost
[1:15:12] sight of me matter fact Paul said even
[1:15:17] in the scriptures I believe above this
[1:15:19] or the chapter that follows it where
[1:15:20] Paul could say I seek to apprehend that
[1:15:24] which I'm apprehended of Paul let it be
[1:15:27] known that my eyes are on the prize
[1:15:30] glory be to God but if I live in the
[1:15:34] flesh this is the fruit of my labor yet
[1:15:37] what I shall choose I want not for I am
[1:15:39] in a strait betwixt two having a desire
[1:15:42] to depart and to be with Christ which is
[1:15:46] far better nevertheless to abide in the
[1:15:51] flesh
[1:15:53] is more needful for you the jury I don't
[1:16:00] know I don't know if it was something
[1:16:02] that was so put before Paul within this
[1:16:04] very moment but it really lays it out in
[1:16:08] Scripture were Paul knows that if he
[1:16:11] were to die and slit beyond he would be
[1:16:14] gain it places it here within the
[1:16:17] scripture as though that that Paul
[1:16:18] himself he has a choice do I go or do I
[1:16:22] remain but look where Paul places it
[1:16:27] he didn't say it's more needful for me
[1:16:29] to be here because there's things that I
[1:16:32] still want to do in life but he said the
[1:16:38] reason that I want to remain it's
[1:16:42] needful for you it had to be something
[1:16:46] within Paul's heart that let him know
[1:16:48] there's more to be done I always think
[1:16:55] when I was over there that night in the
[1:16:56] prints of God came in that room we were
[1:16:59] praying back there in February of 99
[1:17:01] with my dad and you know death was
[1:17:03] rolling in on that time when he was
[1:17:05] there on that table we were praying
[1:17:07] there you know the testimony and how the
[1:17:08] Lord began to speak him and the one
[1:17:11] thing my dad was talking in the room at
[1:17:13] that time he was just praying and you
[1:17:15] know he said you know I he said what a
[1:17:17] great consolation it was to know in that
[1:17:20] in that hour he said but when he began
[1:17:23] to ask where were you when you were
[1:17:25] praying and we told him I said well
[1:17:26] we'll just ride on down the hallway just
[1:17:28] his way he said that's the direction he
[1:17:30] came to me from and he came to me and
[1:17:33] said your work is not finished here yet
[1:17:36] but you shall go back and the think
[1:17:40] about it I tell you what my mom knows
[1:17:42] everyone when when my daddy wouldn't be
[1:17:44] on the curtain of time I was just a boy
[1:17:46] he had that he had that that part with
[1:17:48] with the ear when he had to had that
[1:17:49] eardrum worked on my daddy was never the
[1:17:52] same after that never the same he wanted
[1:17:57] to go my mom can tell you that he came
[1:18:01] back and for for I don't know how long
[1:18:04] it was he just it's like this life like
[1:18:06] held
[1:18:07] nothing my brother Sam you say what
[1:18:10] about the church oh no he gave his life
[1:18:12] for the church he gave his life for the
[1:18:14] church he gave his life for this but it
[1:18:19] was it was a desire for him to go what
[1:18:22] had been so real let me think about it
[1:18:24] what did brother Branham say here he is
[1:18:26] laying here his body laying there on the
[1:18:28] bed next to sister meeting and brother
[1:18:30] Branham coming back through those lines
[1:18:32] said do I gotta go back in that old pest
[1:18:34] house do I got to go back there you see
[1:18:40] it's something that had so moved upon
[1:18:43] Paul that Paul said it's needful that I
[1:18:46] come back among you having this
[1:18:50] confidence look at this in verse 25 I
[1:18:52] know that I shall abide and continue
[1:18:54] with you all for your furtherance and
[1:18:57] joy of faith for whose furtherance for
[1:19:02] theirs furtherance their joy of faith
[1:19:06] that your rejoicing may be more abundant
[1:19:11] in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to
[1:19:16] you again that your rejoicing in Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ might be more abundant brother
[1:19:25] rap goes on I just don't have time to to
[1:19:29] quote it but brother bream goes in to
[1:19:31] talk about in thinking man's filters
[1:19:33] right towards the end of it but the brem
[1:19:35] says this statement over and over within
[1:19:37] here it's about five times he says that
[1:19:40] how easy it would be for me he makes a
[1:19:43] statement over and over how easy it
[1:19:45] would be for me just to sit down and not
[1:19:48] preach he said it would be easy because
[1:19:50] I wouldn't have to take the bruises I
[1:19:53] wouldn't have to take wounds I wouldn't
[1:19:56] have to get cut he said and I would be
[1:19:57] just as save and have just as much
[1:19:59] eternal life as the man preaching he
[1:20:02] said how easy it would be for me he said
[1:20:05] instead of being troubled and not being
[1:20:07] able to sleep and and praying over the
[1:20:09] different things how easy said it would
[1:20:11] be for me just to be able to get my gun
[1:20:13] and go hunting in the rod and go fishing
[1:20:14] he says this over and over to thinking
[1:20:17] man's filter but he says how easy it
[1:20:19] would be said but
[1:20:20] fell my lot you understand this was not
[1:20:26] something that he was made to do even
[1:20:31] when he was getting ready for tried to
[1:20:33] alter of what God had ordained for him
[1:20:37] to do but he was going to alter it to
[1:20:39] the ways that he wanted to do it y'all
[1:20:42] know what I'm talking about when he
[1:20:43] developed that complex right he was
[1:20:47] going through and making all these
[1:20:48] things because of what he had what had
[1:20:50] been developed but she's noticed this
[1:20:51] God never made that decision for him God
[1:20:54] simply let him know if you take this
[1:20:57] direction in your life this is what's
[1:21:00] going to happen
[1:21:01] oh brother Samuel it was impossible for
[1:21:03] him to do it then you got God playing
[1:21:06] games he could have made that decision
[1:21:09] but you see friends this is where it
[1:21:13] shows there's something greater and
[1:21:15] deeper when the purpose of God is laying
[1:21:19] there in their life that purpose cannot
[1:21:21] be defeated God pulled back the curtains
[1:21:26] and let him see but he still had to make
[1:21:28] the decision I'm glad he made the
[1:21:36] decision that he made hallelujah Amen
[1:21:40] I'm a product of this message it's come
[1:21:45] it broke the darkness away from around
[1:21:48] my life oh my it'll cost you things you
[1:21:52] know that even your stand on the word
[1:21:55] will cost you people will say things
[1:21:58] that got me listen friends they don't
[1:22:00] mean it to be bad it's misunderstood
[1:22:02] they thought Jesus was against the law
[1:22:04] Jesus wasn't against the law they
[1:22:08] thought Paul was against the law Paul
[1:22:10] wasn't against the law Paul himself
[1:22:11] wrote very clearly yay now the law is
[1:22:14] established but notice how Paul would go
[1:22:23] on and write this here right let me just
[1:22:28] let me read just let me read just a few
[1:22:31] verses here
[1:22:35] brother Brian go to Philippians 2:16 let
[1:22:39] me just cut out some of this what's
[1:22:42] where Paul keep this thought in mind
[1:22:45] they're rejoicing
[1:22:47] he says holding forth the word of life
[1:22:48] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:22:50] that I have not run in vain neither
[1:22:52] labored in vain yay
[1:22:54] and if I be offered upon the sacrifice
[1:22:58] and service of your faith I joy and
[1:23:03] rejoice with you all this word offered
[1:23:07] up means a drink offering that's been
[1:23:11] poured out if my life has been poured
[1:23:14] out for your service
[1:23:17] Paul said I rejoice I joy
[1:23:22] what's the sufferings this is not you
[1:23:25] can see within these verses of Scripture
[1:23:28] here is one so lost in Christ it's not
[1:23:35] about him and yet this was not something
[1:23:40] that was just handed to Paul but Paul
[1:23:43] spoke to you and I and made it very
[1:23:45] clear in the book of Corinthians I
[1:23:48] protest by your rejoicing I die daily
[1:23:54] the secret of this right here was Paul's
[1:23:59] willingness to die daily I wonder how
[1:24:04] many scriptures could be wrote about
[1:24:07] places that Paul maybe perhaps didn't
[1:24:11] want to go wasn't convenient but Paul
[1:24:16] had been in such a place you understand
[1:24:19] what I'm saying you can't make you
[1:24:21] cannot make Paul and the other men and
[1:24:24] put them on as idols as though they
[1:24:26] never had don't you let the devil do
[1:24:28] that to you as though they never had
[1:24:30] their trials and their tests and they
[1:24:32] never don't you let the devil do that to
[1:24:34] you
[1:24:34] that's an idolatry but these were these
[1:24:38] were men that Paul could say we were
[1:24:40] thin without we had fear
[1:24:43] we're even to trust in themselves he
[1:24:45] said we had the sentence of death in
[1:24:47] ourselves these were individuals that as
[1:24:51] Paul could died to himself that God
[1:24:54] could lead him and direct him so much to
[1:24:57] a place to where Paul could say I go
[1:24:59] bound in the spirit he wasn't looking at
[1:25:05] his earthly bonds he was looking at I'm
[1:25:11] spiritually bound to the will of God
[1:25:14] that this is my desire I want to serve
[1:25:19] and please him this is the dead of love
[1:25:24] I oh this is the dead of love that you
[1:25:29] will wield all mine for this same cause
[1:25:35] also do you joy do you do you joy and
[1:25:40] rejoice with me let's just stop
[1:25:54] we bryan script down to that second
[1:25:55] Timothy chapter two verse eight
[1:25:59] look where Paul says this here verse
[1:26:02] eight remember that Jesus Christ of the
[1:26:06] seed of David was raised from the dead
[1:26:07] according to my gospel wherein I suffer
[1:26:16] trouble as an evildoer this is they
[1:26:21] sought to be glad tidings of peace but
[1:26:24] him preaching this he suffered trouble
[1:26:27] as an evil doer even unto bonds but the
[1:26:37] word of God is not bound therefore I
[1:26:43] endure all things for the elects sake
[1:26:52] Paul what about you oh no it's not about
[1:26:55] me it's not about me it's about him and
[1:27:00] his people I endure all things for his
[1:27:07] elects sake that they may also obtain
[1:27:10] the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
[1:27:15] with eternal glory you know here brother
[1:27:20] branham make this statement he said our
[1:27:25] redemption wasn't a cheap thing he said
[1:27:30] this message to bring it wasn't easy I
[1:27:35] tell you friends it's not it's not
[1:27:38] become easy I hope you understand what
[1:27:42] I'm saying
[1:27:43] it wasn't easy for him to bring it how
[1:27:46] many times her brother Brad would say I
[1:27:47] know what I'm saying I'm gonna lose
[1:27:50] friends and yet why did he say it not to
[1:27:55] lose friends he said it to be obedient
[1:27:58] to the Lord
[1:28:01] aren't you glad I'm glad but even in
[1:28:08] that if it was not easy to bring this
[1:28:11] message than to think about it even in
[1:28:14] the day that we're living in it's not
[1:28:16] easy to live it I'm not talking about
[1:28:20] because you don't have the life on the
[1:28:21] inside it's easy to live it from with on
[1:28:24] the inside but there's it's in complete
[1:28:26] complete objection to the very society
[1:28:31] that we live in the standard of the word
[1:28:35] it's not it's not everybody going along
[1:28:38] with it not everybody patting you on the
[1:28:40] back and the sad thing about it is it's
[1:28:43] not just out there but it can get right
[1:28:45] around in the ranks of our message but
[1:28:52] it's worth it I said it's worth it it's
[1:28:58] worth it to follow the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:00] it's worth it to let this word have
[1:29:04] preeminence it's worth it to see the
[1:29:07] token applied and expressed in our life
[1:29:10] it's worth it our heart our life says
[1:29:19] the dead of love
[1:29:22] gladly Lord it's not the popular opinion
[1:29:28] or popular thought of the day but it's
[1:29:31] you
[1:29:32] it's what my soul has longed for oh
[1:29:38] don't you love him
[1:29:40] let's give everything we've got to him
[1:29:45] let's give everything with God if you
[1:29:47] haven't sold out completely sell out
[1:29:49] completely to him and even here tonight
[1:29:53] even to look down in your life and say
[1:29:55] lord I owe my all to you everything if
[1:30:01] you've let things get in your mind or
[1:30:02] things get in your spirit or things
[1:30:04] crowd into your heart say Lord Jesus
[1:30:07] cleanse me Lord I purged that out cast
[1:30:11] that aside I want you to half full
[1:30:14] preeminence you see friends you can tell
[1:30:17] what you've been given to about where
[1:30:19] your meditation is the devil will try to
[1:30:23] fill your mind in your heart with things
[1:30:25] to meditate on he's always there to try
[1:30:29] to point out bad and try to point out
[1:30:31] negative but remember look to the Lord
[1:30:38] he is faithful within all of this
[1:30:41] there's no way that Paul could have went
[1:30:44] through the things he went through
[1:30:46] without having the anchor in his heart
[1:30:48] and without applying what he spoke to
[1:30:51] you and I when he said to you and I
[1:30:54] consider him who endured contradiction
[1:30:58] of sinners lest you be weary and faint
[1:31:01] in your mind but look unto Jesus who's
[1:31:05] the author and finisher of your faith
[1:31:11] glory be to God
[1:31:13] this was a testimony Paul could leave
[1:31:15] the Corinthian church one of his last
[1:31:17] few words that he left them in the
[1:31:20] closing chapter of second Corinthians he
[1:31:24] was able to declare that among you he
[1:31:28] says I've sought only
[1:31:30] to edify the Church of the Living God
[1:31:34] let that be our heart to edify His
[1:31:43] Church edified that doesn't mean pumping
[1:31:47] one another up with all kinds of flowery
[1:31:49] things but to edify his church means
[1:31:52] that each and every one of us stands
[1:31:54] like a gatekeeper and we stand right
[1:31:57] here faithful to the Word of God and say
[1:32:01] Lord Jesus I won't let nothing cross
[1:32:04] into my heart if there's things that
[1:32:07] want to comes to my ear that's not
[1:32:08] edifying I've been able to speak to the
[1:32:11] brother or sister and say this is not
[1:32:13] edifying but I'll tell you what we'll do
[1:32:15] we'll go to prayer about it give me your
[1:32:16] hand right now and let's pray you see
[1:32:20] friends that only end a lot of things if
[1:32:23] we can take it to the Lord in prayer the
[1:32:29] dead of love I Oh fill up the
[1:32:34] afflictions that are left behind oh god
[1:32:37] help us tonight
[1:32:39] your loving he's the same God he's the
[1:32:47] same God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord
[1:32:54] your word is so rich to our hearts Lord
[1:32:58] it's challenging it challenges our lives
[1:33:02] a little God to such depth Lord like
[1:33:07] Paul when we read about this and we see
[1:33:09] Paul's life we realize Lord that Paul
[1:33:12] could write about the maturing the
[1:33:14] trials the character Paul could write
[1:33:18] about the things that you saw within the
[1:33:21] faith of a man James on the other hand
[1:33:24] would write about the works that would
[1:33:25] testify of the faith that lay within the
[1:33:28] man and yet Lord how Paul could
[1:33:32] recognize and in no way was he trying to
[1:33:36] draw the church in a manner to where the
[1:33:39] church would feel sorry for him where
[1:33:41] they would be faint as a matter of fact
[1:33:43] he gave such direction but Lord the
[1:33:47] proof was that when tribulation when
[1:33:50] test when trials when things got hard
[1:33:53] Paul didn't just skirt and flee but he
[1:33:57] had an anchor that was able to hold him
[1:34:00] Lord Jesus when we see the scriptures
[1:34:04] where it says being partakers of your
[1:34:05] sufferings we realize the Lord to be a
[1:34:08] partaker is as we looked at it Lord some
[1:34:11] Thursday's ago is to go through
[1:34:14] something to go through and Lord Jesus
[1:34:19] you have seen us through every test in
[1:34:23] every trial Lord God you who's seen us
[1:34:26] through your seeing mr. Lord God here
[1:34:31] tonight I don't know what the needs
[1:34:33] might be and I know that we can take
[1:34:36] such a consolation as we look into the
[1:34:39] Word of God and truly Lord we can look
[1:34:42] at it and see the great things that Paul
[1:34:44] suffered the things that he went through
[1:34:46] and how Paul would express that his
[1:34:50] striving was according to your might
[1:34:54] your power that was striving mightily in
[1:34:57] him
[1:34:59] or God as Paul was dying daily these
[1:35:03] scriptures that we read tonight oh god
[1:35:07] what we don't see but yet we know was
[1:35:10] there in the quiet times in the times of
[1:35:14] prayer that father where Paul himself
[1:35:17] was dying to self and he was dying that
[1:35:24] you might be glorified lord help us help
[1:35:31] us Lord that our lives would be like
[1:35:36] this this life this kind of a life you
[1:35:40] had an example in this hour your God our
[1:35:44] prophet your servant our messenger Lord
[1:35:51] God as he came to bring this gospel as a
[1:35:54] you and I the gospel that was not
[1:35:57] popular it was not easy by the way of
[1:36:01] the way that the world it was not easy
[1:36:03] for him to stand there but he stood
[1:36:07] there by the love of God in his heart
[1:36:11] Lord that's the same in our lives
[1:36:15] standing by the love of God standing by
[1:36:19] that same love taking residency in our
[1:36:22] hearts lord help us lord help us not to
[1:36:24] get our eyes or our attention on the
[1:36:26] wrong things
[1:36:27] help us Lord God we understand there's
[1:36:29] gonna be misunderstandings there'll be
[1:36:31] things that will come around there'll be
[1:36:33] things that are said there's actually as
[1:36:35] your prophet just reading in Lord here
[1:36:37] today where he said each and every one
[1:36:39] in the kingdom of God every son and
[1:36:41] daughter of God has always had to deal
[1:36:44] with accusing Lord help us help us your
[1:36:48] God to look beyond those things lord
[1:36:51] help us to have our eyes focused on you
[1:36:54] Lord for it's you that we're living for
[1:36:56] if we're living for you and living to
[1:36:59] please you then Lord God
[1:37:02] you give us the strength to be able to
[1:37:04] live pleasing to be able to suffer or
