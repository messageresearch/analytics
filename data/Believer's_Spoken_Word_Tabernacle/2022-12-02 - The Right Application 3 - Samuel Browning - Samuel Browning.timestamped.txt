[38:09] foreign
[38:11] [Music]
[38:18] [Applause]
[38:32] hallelujah how wonderful it is
[38:35] you know brother Ram tells us he takes
[38:37] the parallel of halibut with the Rapture
[38:40] and
[38:41] how that when the Lord Jesus raised
[38:43] there he was with his disciples as it
[38:45] says in the book of Acts for that period
[38:48] of time about 30 days and the brother
[38:51] Brown said the Saints our loved ones and
[38:53] those Saints have gone on will raise and
[38:56] he said we'll be gathered together yeah
[38:58] and he said now you think how God has
[39:01] things so planned out brother Graham
[39:02] says he has everything so planned
[39:05] and he said what it is he said because
[39:07] even when our changes come we're going
[39:10] to be looking to see who made it
[39:13] and he said see he says he knows that we
[39:15] would be looking around so he gives us
[39:18] that time
[39:20] because when he when he descends all
[39:23] eyes are going to be looking for him
[39:26] so to think of just even how it is now
[39:28] in our lives it always comes back to him
[39:31] and then in that time it will all come
[39:34] right back to him
[39:36] because he's The Sinner of Our Lives
[39:40] Amen in the Lord good yeah
[39:43] so good to be in the house of the Lord
[39:45] tonight
[39:46] and good to be and fellowship with you
[39:49] we just want to turn our hearts to the
[39:51] word of the Lord tonight and just invite
[39:53] him to come so appreciated the song
[39:55] service and the songs and just the
[39:57] worship and
[39:58] it's just so wonderful to be gathered
[40:00] together

[40:36] certainly be praying for you brother
[40:38] Ronnie long will be here Amen to to
[40:40] stand in for us and then um and we're
[40:44] just thankful to the Lord for that and
[40:46] and just certainly looking to the Lord
[40:48] for what God has in store amen so would
[40:52] you just will you keep that in prayer
[40:53] amen and then we'll
[40:56] so we just want to also there's some
[41:00] announcements that's on the
[41:02] calendar as well that upcoming events in
[41:05] January and then even in March and I
[41:07] know those are far off dates as far as
[41:09] in March but it's things that I think
[41:11] that it would be good to go ahead and
[41:13] plan for you can put on your calendar
[41:15] and some the meetings and some things
[41:16] that we have and and some of those
[41:18] meetings that have coming up there have
[41:21] some special planning that has gone into
[41:23] that for some unique some unique things
[41:26] I'll go into that in a little bit detail
[41:28] here in a little bit
[41:29] a later time so
[41:32] um let's go let's look here in the
[41:34] scriptures in First Peter chapter 4.
[41:38] Amen in verse 12. also wanted to give
[41:41] you an update brother Stephen West he
[41:44] just wanted to say thank you for your
[41:47] continued prayers
[41:49] his mother she's at home it's just that
[41:53] she's experiencing at different times
[41:54] just um some difficulty with breathing
[41:57] the lung volume so if we just keep that
[42:00] in prayer she's on the therapy where all
[42:03] that is at and just it's her her
[42:06] breathing and that therapy that that
[42:08] would just she would grow stronger so
[42:11] she's she's at home there and so our
[42:14] brother just asked that we would just
[42:16] keep that in prayer I know there's many
[42:18] other requests and different needs that
[42:20] here are among us and we just want to
[42:23] remember each one of these requests and
[42:25] needs in prayer someone comes on your
[42:27] heart I know we say this a lot but it's
[42:29] true God knows and he knows how to place
[42:33] needs Upon Our Hearts sometimes if you
[42:36] if you think about in a term and this is
[42:38] why I love the beauty of the body of
[42:40] Jesus Christ because if you think about
[42:42] just for one individual of how many
[42:44] times that you just yourself have been
[42:47] had requests come your way pray for me
[42:49] pray for pray for me and really you
[42:52] would have to try to write everything
[42:53] down to remember and on your own but
[42:55] it's something that's special when we
[42:57] can recognize that within it God will
[43:00] always bring to our heart in prayer or
[43:03] leading us into prayer
[43:05] God will always bring that so I'm
[43:06] thankful that we don't have to look and
[43:08] say oh my I forgot to forgot to pray
[43:10] about this I forgot no as soon as those
[43:12] things as it comes to our heart we enter
[43:14] in and we pray because if not all the
[43:17] requests that we have the only thing we
[43:19] would do as far as in prayer would just
[43:21] be giving out requests right but our
[43:24] desire is this Lord that that you would
[43:26] just you would Minister and speak to the
[43:29] needs amen God's placed us as a body
[43:31] that we would be able to to do that and
[43:33] it wonderful to be a part of the body of
[43:35] Jesus Christ a local body a man where we
[43:38] can take the different requests and
[43:40] needs before the Lord in prayer so
[43:42] First Peter chapter 4
[43:45] and verse 12.
[43:47] the scripture says beloved
[43:51] think it not strange
[43:53] concerning the fiery trial
[43:56] which is to try you
[43:59] as though some strange thing happened
[44:03] unto you
[44:05] but rejoice
[44:07] inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
[44:10] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[44:14] revealed
[44:15] ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy
[44:20] let's just let's just bear our hearts in
[44:22] a word of Prayer
[44:23] Heavenly Father
[44:25] Lord as we just come to you this evening
[44:27] Lord are just so thankful God for your
[44:31] mercy Lord to us once again Lord you've
[44:34] allowed us to be able to come together
[44:37] Lord
[44:38] father our expectation Lord is to hear
[44:42] from you Lord we just desire to give
[44:45] Lord of our hearts and ourselves to you
[44:48] and you know what we have need of oh God
[44:51] we ask that you would just Minister Lord
[44:54] in just a very special way Lord I pray
[44:57] that you would help me Lord to step
[45:00] aside Lord the things Lord that you've
[45:03] laid Lord on my heart and I just want to
[45:05] be sensitive to what it is that you
[45:07] desire for this service Lord I pray that
[45:11] God that you'll just Lord come in a very
[45:14] special way Lord and speak personally to
[45:17] every heart we invite you in that way
[45:19] Lord have your way father we pray in the
[45:22] name of Jesus Christ amen
[45:25] amen God bless you being seated
[45:30] I want to we were looking here just even
[45:34] a few weeks ago and um
[45:36] as we look at this
[45:39] in the scripture
[45:41] with the trials and trials of our faith
[45:44] and
[45:45] I look as we were dealing with the
[45:48] thought on the right
[45:49] application to things and we could speak
[45:53] of that in many ways there's many
[45:55] examples that I won't go into but I
[45:58] thought of
[45:59] of how that God through the ministry
[46:03] of brother Branham there were things
[46:05] that would be directed and every time
[46:08] we'd go right back into the word to
[46:10] resolve where someone was like in a
[46:13] conflict or something in their life and
[46:15] they didn't understand what was going on
[46:16] or maybe they had been told something
[46:19] and what they were told really wasn't
[46:21] true and I think brother Branham in one
[46:23] particular time just to give just in a
[46:26] nutshell because it could really it
[46:28] could really speak on this for some time
[46:30] but there was a lady who came a sister
[46:32] who came to brother Branham there and
[46:34] she had uh many different things that
[46:37] had been taking place in her life and
[46:39] and she was told by one person she had
[46:42] seven devils and then she got told by
[46:45] another person you've got five Devils so
[46:47] she was all in a in a confusion of what
[46:49] was going on and she got there and
[46:52] brother Brandon began to sit down and
[46:53] see her and and because of what was said
[46:56] she was she was so you could see I mean
[46:59] she said I don't want these devils and
[47:02] brother Brown began to speak speak to
[47:03] her a little bit and he said he began to
[47:05] speak to her and said he said sister he
[47:07] said those things he said the doctors
[47:09] have been giving you he said you're
[47:11] aware your mother went through a certain
[47:13] time of life too right that's right now
[47:16] he said there's no Devils there he said
[47:19] but aren't you she said aren't you going
[47:20] to cast them away he says there's no
[47:21] Devils to Cast Away
[47:23] there's none there you're in menopause
[47:25] right now
[47:26] and so knowing that brother Branham
[47:28] would have that and I just maybe pause
[47:30] here for a moment if you've uh if any
[47:33] would uh you know of any any any
[47:35] situation brother Bram actually takes
[47:37] there's a wonderful YouTube video where
[47:40] sister Rebecca goes into some
[47:42] explanations when brother Branham
[47:44] actually set her down sister Rebecca
[47:46] Branham and spoke to her even in how to
[47:49] relate to her mom in certain times
[47:51] because she wasn't aware of what was
[47:52] going on brother Brown took a it was 40
[47:55] 45 minutes it's a very good video of
[47:57] understanding even that whole whole part
[48:00] that takes place it's just tremendous
[48:02] because there's so many parts in the
[48:03] message where brother Branham will deal
[48:05] with that but
[48:07] um you know with this with this lady
[48:09] here she was the sister was sitting
[48:11] there and you know brother Brown said I
[48:12] could tell she was hungry but you know
[48:14] he says she still was so caught up with
[48:16] that that I have devils and and brother
[48:18] Branham she goes out and they go out and
[48:20] eat she finally gives in they go out and
[48:21] eat in the kitchen and then when they
[48:23] come back into the Parlor and she said
[48:25] now brother Brown are you going to cast
[48:26] those Devils off me I think she's
[48:27] already been told twice you don't have
[48:29] any devils
[48:32] but see the wrong application
[48:34] was binding her
[48:36] now let me tell you the other effect of
[48:37] that wrong application brother Brown
[48:39] went ahead and told her he said sister I
[48:41] told you you don't have any Devils
[48:43] you're in menopause he said now here's
[48:45] what I want you to do he said you are a
[48:47] good you were a good housekeeper she
[48:49] said yes he said this is what I need you
[48:51] to do I won't use the words exactly
[48:53] brother Brown said he said you need to
[48:55] go home and you need to clean your house
[48:56] and you need to make your husband an
[48:58] apple pie and just go on
[49:02] because you see what the wrong app this
[49:04] is what I'm saying within this do you
[49:06] see what the wrong application had done
[49:09] that man that apple pie will preach
[49:11] won't it
[49:12] but you see you see what the wrong ad
[49:14] this is to me the Simplicity of the you
[49:16] see what the wrong application can do
[49:19] the wrong application had a person where
[49:22] they were living in defeat
[49:25] this is why there's got to be the right
[49:28] application and that's why we need the
[49:31] word of God that comes to discern the
[49:34] very secrets and intents of our hearts
[49:37] so notice when Peter would write this in
[49:40] First Peter chapter 4
[49:42] Peter writes this and here this is this
[49:45] is after the Holy Ghost has come this is
[49:47] speaking to every believer down through
[49:50] time because this shows beloved thinking
[49:54] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[49:57] which is to try you as though some
[50:00] strange thing has happened to you it
[50:02] shows our Humanity
[50:06] that when the test or the trial and we
[50:08] don't even know what it is at first we
[50:11] don't even know it's a test we don't
[50:12] even know it's a trial but when
[50:14] something happens the the first part of
[50:16] it is because we are still veiled in
[50:20] this Humanity
[50:22] and we are constantly as people I can't
[50:25] get all into this tonight when we
[50:28] constantly search for understanding in
[50:31] things
[50:32] why is this and why is that we search
[50:35] for understanding right so we see that
[50:38] within that yet here God knows that part
[50:41] and God doesn't get caught up with our
[50:44] Humanity God knows that down on the
[50:47] inside is a son and daughter of God and
[50:51] all it takes is them to hear from God
[50:53] and they receive strength to bring the
[50:56] outer realm in subjection
[50:58] God's Got Confidence in his children his
[51:02] sheep will hear his voice and respond so
[51:05] notice he says but rejoice in verse 13.
[51:09] inasmuch as you are partakers of
[51:12] Christ's sufferings that when his glory
[51:15] shall be revealed you may be glad also
[51:18] with exceeding joy and I think of that
[51:22] in that scripture there when we look
[51:25] many times at the test and the trials
[51:27] when they come we don't feel like
[51:30] rejoicing
[51:33] and this scripture is not telling us get
[51:38] out in the flesh but what it's speaking
[51:40] to us it's speaking from there's
[51:43] something deep within that though the
[51:46] circumstances do not Merit worship
[51:50] but God is worthy of worship
[51:54] I don't know what is going on around me
[51:57] but I know in whom I have believed
[52:01] if there's one thing I can rejoice in
[52:03] his grace hath brought me his grace half
[52:06] brought me saved this far his grace will
[52:10] lead me over that's what I can rejoice
[52:12] in not the circumstances that are around
[52:15] me
[52:16] right David said though my enemies
[52:20] Came Upon me to consume My Flesh yea
[52:25] they stumbled and fell and David speaks
[52:28] in the midst of that chapter what he was
[52:30] focused on he knew all of this was
[52:32] taking place but he said in the midst of
[52:35] that there is one thing that I've
[52:37] desired and that's what I'm going to
[52:39] seek after when all of this is going on
[52:41] I want to dwell in the house of the Lord
[52:43] I want to be in his presence I know I've
[52:46] still got access to his presence I know
[52:49] there's something greater than this
[52:51] atmosphere that's around me I don't want
[52:53] to come under this atmosphere I want my
[52:55] life to be brought under the atmosphere
[52:58] of his presence
[53:02] praise the Lord this is what Peter would
[53:04] say in First Peter 1 6 wherein you
[53:07] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[53:10] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[53:13] manifold temptations that the trial of
[53:17] your faith being much more precious than
[53:20] of gold that perisheth and I I just feel
[53:22] to keep emphasizing that part of it it's
[53:25] the trial of your faith
[53:30] it's not our flesh
[53:33] because if it was the trial of our flesh
[53:36] it breaks in a moment
[53:38] the flesh breaks the Flesh in the midst
[53:42] of the trial the flesh displays its
[53:44] weakness but that's why the trial comes
[53:47] the trial comes to break down the flesh
[53:51] so that the real man of God the real
[53:54] daughter of God might stand up
[53:57] let the trial of your faith being much
[53:59] more precious than of gold that
[54:00] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[54:03] might be found unto praise and honor and
[54:07] Glory at the pairing of Jesus Christ
[54:09] tried with fire so you can't consume
[54:12] this this Faith within our hearts when
[54:15] it's when it's tried with fire it cannot
[54:17] be consumed
[54:20] are you with me
[54:21] remember what what Paul said I've laid
[54:23] the foundation where no man can live let
[54:26] a man be careful how he adds to that
[54:29] Foundation right because every man's
[54:32] work will be Tried by fire and that
[54:35] which remaineth is that which will be
[54:37] rewarded
[54:39] so fire comes to try to prove and what
[54:43] fire does is it causes the impurities to
[54:47] be separated from the purity
[54:50] Oh Glory and I'm talking about in our
[54:53] own lives now let me read this Herald of
[54:56] three kinds of Believers and I read this
[54:57] to you before but it's much to draw from
[54:59] here on this thought of the right
[55:01] application brother Bram said sometimes
[55:03] Believers are put to the test and not
[55:06] just sometimes every time they are for
[55:08] every son that cometh to God must be
[55:10] chastened tried child trained and
[55:13] remember the trials and the dusty roads
[55:16] and the hot son of persecution but he
[55:19] says the but the Loyalty of your heart
[55:22] beats that material till she's ready to
[55:26] go into the mold so what what is it that
[55:30] that that that that beats that character
[55:33] or that or that material is the Loyalty
[55:36] of our heart
[55:38] loyalty is standing true
[55:42] amen right
[55:43] I mean sometimes when the battle comes
[55:46] the pressure comes to Desert
[55:48] right but there's got to be something
[55:50] greater a loyalty we say loyalty to what
[55:54] loyalty to whom God has revealed himself
[55:57] to you
[55:58] the Bible said walk in the light as he's
[56:01] in the light you walk in that light and
[56:03] much more unfolds then firm on the life
[56:07] that he has revealed to you
[56:10] right well I don't see all of this but
[56:13] stand on the light that he's revealed to
[56:15] you because Flesh and Blood did not
[56:17] reveal that to you God has revealed that
[56:19] to you and if you'll be faithful with
[56:21] that the Bible says that the
[56:23] righteousness of God is revealed from
[56:26] Faith unto faith
[56:28] so Stand Fast in that word and expect
[56:31] for God to reveal more because
[56:33] everything that God reveals to you and I
[56:36] we will be tested and tried on that word
[56:42] so notice this loyalty of our heart he
[56:44] said God's children is made up correctly
[56:47] on his word for they are living examples
[56:49] and the word of God is living through
[56:51] them the trial comes to shake you to put
[56:54] you to the very bottom to see where
[56:56] you'll stand
[56:58] and it goes on he says now job through
[57:01] his tests and trials his children were
[57:03] taking everything else the church
[57:05] members come and they accused him of
[57:07] being a secret Sinner and they tried to
[57:09] say everything against him I want you to
[57:12] catch this but yet he wouldn't listen to
[57:14] any of it he knowed he had met God's
[57:17] requirement he know there's no need of
[57:20] Satan trying to tempt him he noted was
[57:22] the devil what was it that he knowed was
[57:25] the devil he knew that the inspiration
[57:28] they were speaking with was not coming
[57:31] from God because the inspiration he had
[57:35] received from God he had walked in that
[57:39] inspiration fully
[57:41] job had offered up the right sacrifice
[57:44] right so this discernment job that's why
[57:47] Joe could stand there he never called
[57:49] him a devil but remember even when his
[57:51] wife said you know Curse God and die but
[57:55] that was part of the test and he said
[57:57] thou speakest like a foolish woman
[58:01] you're not a foolish woman because the
[58:03] fool has said in his heart there is no
[58:04] God
[58:05] right so here still there's discernment
[58:08] in the life of a Believer though
[58:11] discernment job doesn't know what's
[58:14] taking place he doesn't understand it
[58:16] but there's enough to discern in this
[58:19] moment that this is the enemy coming
[58:23] against me how can it be so sure because
[58:26] the revelation God has revealed to him
[58:29] the acceptable way and it wasn't just
[58:32] something handed to job it was revealed
[58:35] to job
[58:36] brother Brown puts her like this and the
[58:38] message I know my redeemer liveth he
[58:40] said the reason the rest of them were
[58:42] coming at Job the where they were is
[58:44] because they only knew God by theology
[58:47] he said but job knew him by revelation
[58:51] because when you know him by Revelation
[58:54] you know that he is a person
[58:58] glory be to God you are acquainted with
[59:00] his nature with his ways you are
[59:03] acquainted with him
[59:07] and friends and he is not our enemy
[59:11] because a friend he maketh known to his
[59:15] friends whatsoever he doeth
[59:18] he was conveying to job the way of
[59:21] acceptance oh my
[59:23] so job knew that discernment
[59:26] now notice brother REM said as long as
[59:28] Satan can make him believe right now now
[59:32] notice as long as Satan can make him
[59:34] talking about Job believe that his
[59:37] sickness was his God doing it he had job
[59:41] whipped
[59:43] now he said but once job struck that
[59:46] Revelation that it was not God he was
[59:48] only going through his trials to make
[59:51] him something it wasn't God doing it it
[59:53] was Satan doing it he said now he'll try
[59:55] to tell you he'll do the same thing to
[59:57] you he'll try to tell you that these
[1:00:00] trials and things is your God trying to
[1:00:02] put punishment upon you
[1:00:05] notice it's you're being punished
[1:00:09] That's what Satan wants you to believe
[1:00:12] you're being punished
[1:00:14] now he said it isn't so it's Satan doing
[1:00:19] that and God permitting it to temper you
[1:00:23] to make you see if you are tied to this
[1:00:27] Earth by the Earth cares or whether your
[1:00:30] treasure is in heaven so God permits it
[1:00:33] the fire comes upon the metal to temper
[1:00:36] it make it stronger
[1:00:39] so the trial doesn't come to make us
[1:00:41] weaker the trial comes to make us
[1:00:43] stronger
[1:00:45] and into not strengthening our flesh
[1:00:48] but the trial exposes and weakens and
[1:00:52] brings back to life that the inner man
[1:00:54] might be strengthened that's why Paul
[1:00:57] could say that though the outward man
[1:00:59] perish but yet our inward man is renewed
[1:01:04] day by day
[1:01:06] is that right so he'll try to tell you
[1:01:09] so Satan notice he has come he he when
[1:01:13] God said have you considered my servant
[1:01:15] job and Satan then after all of this he
[1:01:19] he is there whispering to job you are
[1:01:23] being punished
[1:01:25] and job's looking at it you see there's
[1:01:27] influences for the things job looks at
[1:01:31] I'm being punished but yet the confusion
[1:01:34] is if I've done what God has asked me to
[1:01:37] do
[1:01:39] well let's just let's just speak a few
[1:01:41] moments
[1:01:43] in job
[1:01:48] in verse 1 job said my soul is weary of
[1:01:52] my life
[1:01:53] and I will leave my complaint upon
[1:01:55] myself I will speak in the bitterness of
[1:01:58] my soul So speaking of the situation and
[1:02:01] what is taking place I I'm going to
[1:02:03] appeal to The Compassion of the Lord in
[1:02:07] verse 2 I will say to God do not condemn
[1:02:10] do not condemn me show me wherefore thou
[1:02:13] contenders with me now let me just say
[1:02:15] this and we're not trying to elevate
[1:02:17] anybody but you see there there is a way
[1:02:20] that with job wherein that he's
[1:02:22] appealing to The Compassion of God that
[1:02:25] job within the midst of it he's not got
[1:02:29] an attitude
[1:02:31] but he's looking at the situation
[1:02:34] do not condemn me show me wherefore thou
[1:02:38] contend this with me is it good unto
[1:02:41] thee that thou should suppressed that
[1:02:43] thou shouldest despise the work of thine
[1:02:45] hands and shine upon the counsel of the
[1:02:48] wicked hash thou eyes of Flesh or seeth
[1:02:51] thou as a man seeth are thy days as the
[1:02:54] days of man are thy years as man's days
[1:02:57] that thou inquirest after Mount iniquity
[1:03:00] and searcheth after my sin thou knowest
[1:03:03] that I am not Wicked and there is none
[1:03:06] that can deliver out of thine hand now
[1:03:08] if what we're reading here this would be
[1:03:10] job praying
[1:03:15] that's a pretty powerful statement thou
[1:03:17] knowest that I am not Wicked
[1:03:20] job's Got Confidence
[1:03:23] where he's standing
[1:03:25] because what you've revealed Lord that's
[1:03:27] what I've walked in
[1:03:29] I can't do nothing else but reveal in
[1:03:31] what you have walked in or what Norwalk
[1:03:34] in what you've revealed I can't do
[1:03:36] anything else but that now notice thine
[1:03:39] hands have made me and fashioned me
[1:03:42] together round about yet thou
[1:03:45] destroyed me
[1:03:49] my my
[1:03:51] verse 9 remember I beseech thee that
[1:03:54] thou Hast made me as clay and wilt thou
[1:03:57] bring me into dust again
[1:03:59] you see what job doesn't know
[1:04:02] it's first of all it isn't God doing it
[1:04:06] it isn't God contending with him
[1:04:09] but job doesn't know that
[1:04:12] right
[1:04:13] job is looking at it you brought me
[1:04:16] forth
[1:04:17] am I going to go back to dust again
[1:04:19] here's the reality job does not know
[1:04:22] what conversation has taken place in
[1:04:24] heaven
[1:04:25] he doesn't know boundaries have already
[1:04:27] been put up you can touch everything but
[1:04:30] don't you touch his life but job doesn't
[1:04:33] know that
[1:04:36] job's a prophet right
[1:04:38] he had access to God by vision and
[1:04:41] revelation God could have easily opened
[1:04:43] that up and he could have saw that
[1:04:45] taking place did not Micah what's not
[1:04:48] Micah lifted by the spirit of God and
[1:04:50] said I see in heaven right by Prophet
[1:04:54] carried by vision and Revelation would
[1:04:57] come regarding the the situation and God
[1:05:00] could have done that right now
[1:05:03] but he chose not to
[1:05:06] God could
[1:05:15] afford any any length of time there's
[1:05:16] times sometimes that you'll know of
[1:05:18] certain things that maybe God will just
[1:05:20] something will be mentioned your way
[1:05:22] something will come your way or
[1:05:23] something will kind of stir in a way
[1:05:25] like my it just seems like maybe
[1:05:27] something you know God is moving and
[1:05:29] warning or or something in some way
[1:05:31] sometimes God will do that be very
[1:05:33] gracious to you and I in that manner you
[1:05:36] realize when the Bible says uh regarding
[1:05:38] that of the Sumerian age in the Book of
[1:05:40] Revelations it said 10 days Thou shalt
[1:05:42] have tribulation meaning 10 years 10
[1:05:44] bitter years and brother bran would tell
[1:05:46] us how that God would so keep that back
[1:05:49] from the church yet it was written in
[1:05:50] the letter but he would not put emphasis
[1:05:52] upon that lest it would bring fear upon
[1:05:55] the people but to realize that when the
[1:05:58] situation would actually occur real
[1:06:01] Believers would stand by the quality of
[1:06:05] his life that was within them you
[1:06:07] realize that God what it speaks to you
[1:06:09] and I it isn't that God has a lack of
[1:06:11] confidence it's God knows what you and I
[1:06:14] have need of even the test even the
[1:06:16] trial that's coming our way because
[1:06:18] God's got a purpose in it all and God
[1:06:21] knows how to prepare you and I for that
[1:06:24] test and that trial oh we feel so ill
[1:06:27] prepare we wonder what's going on but
[1:06:30] yet God has prepared you and I for that
[1:06:33] moment and then in that moment God is
[1:06:36] Excavating more of himself in our lives
[1:06:41] what a paradox in it
[1:06:44] we're in the middle of it saying I don't
[1:06:45] know what all is going on but God said
[1:06:47] I've got everything just right where I
[1:06:48] want it I've got the excavator here I've
[1:06:51] got this equipment here I've got but
[1:06:52] Lord watch all this no all of this right
[1:06:54] here see this is what I have designed to
[1:06:57] bring out of you
[1:06:59] oh my mama
[1:07:02] like I told you before I'm not I'm not
[1:07:03] putting a raise in my hand to say Lord I
[1:07:05] want you to testify about me no I'm not
[1:07:07] raising my hand like that
[1:07:10] right because I'm sure if Joe would have
[1:07:13] had the choice job would have said God
[1:07:14] don't don't brag on me Lord surely I
[1:07:16] prefer my brother over here or my sister
[1:07:18] they are much better off than Lord God
[1:07:20] if if anybody deserves well I don't want
[1:07:23] to wish a trial on anybody
[1:07:25] anyhow let's go on verse 9 remember I
[1:07:27] beseech thee that thou has made me as
[1:07:29] the clay and wilt thou bring me into
[1:07:31] dust again hast thou not poured me out
[1:07:34] as milk and curdled me like cheese in
[1:07:36] other words job is speaking of that God
[1:07:38] you have fashioned me you have brought
[1:07:40] me forth everything has been set and so
[1:07:43] perfectly arranged in my life by you you
[1:07:46] have brought me to this place thou has
[1:07:50] closed me clothed me with skin and flesh
[1:07:53] and has fenced me with bones and sinews
[1:07:57] thou Hast granted me life and favor and
[1:08:00] thy visitation hath preserved my spirit
[1:08:03] oh I'll tell you as I read through this
[1:08:05] here in the Book of Job I don't know if
[1:08:07] the Lord will let me speak on it or not
[1:08:08] but you'll find over and over in places
[1:08:10] right in here where in the midst of when
[1:08:13] job is talking there'll be something
[1:08:15] raise up on the inside that he
[1:08:17] recognizes and it's things that I
[1:08:19] believe job don't even know what's being
[1:08:22] said in that moment but what is it it's
[1:08:24] that seed of God on the inside that's
[1:08:27] speaking out job identifies right here
[1:08:30] that I have been clothed in sinews and
[1:08:34] flesh that I am an attribute of God
[1:08:37] in other words this body that I'm in is
[1:08:41] just like this screen it's only to
[1:08:43] display you
[1:08:45] glory be to God thou has granted me life
[1:08:48] and favor in thy visitation hath
[1:08:50] preserve my spirit and these things now
[1:08:53] notice thou Hast hid in thine heart I
[1:08:56] know that this is with thee so here job
[1:08:59] is standing I know Lord that you have
[1:09:02] the understanding for what's taking
[1:09:04] place
[1:09:06] because I know you you're not the author
[1:09:08] of confusion
[1:09:10] you're a God of purpose
[1:09:12] job knows that by the Revelation job is
[1:09:15] is knowing this that God is a god of
[1:09:18] purpose that it's God that's drawn to
[1:09:19] his heart it's God that's revealed that
[1:09:21] of the perpetuation of the sacrifice of
[1:09:24] the burnt offering and how to have
[1:09:26] Fellowship under the shed blood so he
[1:09:28] knows that within this that God has the
[1:09:31] understanding that he has need of now
[1:09:33] notice in verse 14 if I sin then thou
[1:09:37] Marcus me and thou will not equip me
[1:09:39] from mine iniquity if I be Wicked woe
[1:09:42] unto me and if I be righteous yet will I
[1:09:45] not lift up my head oh my I love that
[1:09:49] that phrase right there even if I'd be
[1:09:52] righteous I will not hold my head up as
[1:09:55] though that I have done something
[1:09:59] because real true revelation of
[1:10:02] righteousness brings humility to the
[1:10:05] word of God recognizing that it's not by
[1:10:09] works that I have done but it's by grace
[1:10:11] through faith are you saved and that is
[1:10:14] not of works but we are his workmanship
[1:10:18] that it's not my righteousness because
[1:10:20] that ain't nothing but filthy rags but
[1:10:22] it's his righteousness
[1:10:24] he hath made him to be sin who knew no
[1:10:28] sin
[1:10:29] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:10:33] of God in Christ
[1:10:36] and if I'd be righteous yet will I not
[1:10:38] lift up my head I am full of confusion
[1:10:42] therefore see thou mind Affliction for
[1:10:46] it increases thou harness me as a fierce
[1:10:49] line who's he talking about God
[1:10:52] you're hunting me like a fierce lion and
[1:10:56] again thou show us thyself marvelous
[1:10:58] upon me thou renew us thy Witnesses
[1:11:02] against me and increaseth thine
[1:11:04] indignation upon me changes and War are
[1:11:08] against me
[1:11:12] could that be a prophet of God sure
[1:11:15] could we can go through all the rest of
[1:11:16] the prophets
[1:11:18] you see God God doesn't have a problem
[1:11:20] with our Humanity sticking out it's us
[1:11:23] as humans that gets problems with other
[1:11:25] people's Humanity
[1:11:27] come on now we get problems with other
[1:11:29] Humanity but you remember we're not
[1:11:31] United
[1:11:34] with Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] right we are a part of the body of Jesus
[1:11:38] Christ by the New Birth by the spirit of
[1:11:41] almighty God so it's not Humanity it's
[1:11:44] not Humanity that we're to be caught up
[1:11:46] with but in reality when I look at
[1:11:48] things like this I take encouragement
[1:11:50] from it
[1:11:51] I take encouragement from it in my
[1:11:53] journey
[1:11:54] because you want to know why we're faced
[1:11:56] with the same battles
[1:11:58] we're faced with the same battles and
[1:12:00] the same devil that came to job and told
[1:12:03] job you're being punished God's against
[1:12:05] you God's contending with you you would
[1:12:08] look at that and think about it that's
[1:12:10] the same thing he wants to tell you and
[1:12:12] I
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:15] oh my and so when the enemy wants to say
[1:12:17] well if you were this if you were
[1:12:19] talking about a prophet of God right
[1:12:21] here
[1:12:22] one who had access to God by vision and
[1:12:26] Revelation you know what he goes to show
[1:12:27] you and I that God will only reveal and
[1:12:31] give understanding when understanding is
[1:12:34] needed
[1:12:35] but let me just say this whether God
[1:12:37] gave job any understanding or not it
[1:12:40] would never and could never Shake job
[1:12:43] off of that Firm Foundation because job
[1:12:46] did not know God by theology he wasn't
[1:12:49] talked into God he couldn't be tucked
[1:12:51] out of God
[1:12:53] amen it was a reality in his life
[1:12:58] now let's look in verse 18 here the same
[1:13:00] chapter wherefore then hast thou brought
[1:13:03] me forth out of the womb oh
[1:13:06] why why did you bring me here
[1:13:09] why am I here
[1:13:11] why am I here
[1:13:13] oh that I had given up The Ghost and no
[1:13:15] I
[1:13:16] had seen me
[1:13:20] I think our brother Bram says it in
[1:13:21] adoption series he talks about how he
[1:13:23] was you know talking to the Lord he said
[1:13:24] I just want to go on home I just want to
[1:13:26] go on home and be with the Lord I just
[1:13:27] I'm so tired all this here and he said
[1:13:29] the voice came to him and Whisper and
[1:13:30] said are you trying to dodge the
[1:13:33] troubles
[1:13:34] are you trying to dodge the trials
[1:13:37] brother Brown said forgive me Lord just
[1:13:39] give me Grace to go through
[1:13:43] he does not want to
[1:13:47] our Humanity does not want to go through
[1:13:50] it in that way
[1:13:51] right
[1:13:53] oh my
[1:13:54] oh but I had given up the ghost to know
[1:13:56] I had seen me I should have been as
[1:13:58] though I had not been I should have been
[1:14:01] carried from the womb to the Grave
[1:14:03] so he's telling God God this is what you
[1:14:06] should have done
[1:14:07] why did you even bring me here see job
[1:14:09] doesn't see any purpose job sees I'm
[1:14:12] incon this is confusion to me God said
[1:14:15] I've got you right it's right where I
[1:14:16] want you
[1:14:17] I'm letting Satan come and bring all
[1:14:20] this around but it's all working out of
[1:14:22] purpose I'm not against you but see job
[1:14:25] doesn't know that
[1:14:27] job doesn't know that oh my oh my all my
[1:14:30] days few
[1:14:31] cease thin and let me alone that I may
[1:14:33] take a little Comfort before I go wince
[1:14:35] I shall not return even to the land of
[1:14:37] darkness and the shadow
[1:14:39] of death see job even knew that in the
[1:14:42] midst of it even what was revealed in
[1:14:44] order for there to be a shadow there's
[1:14:45] got to be light present
[1:14:47] then Lord go I'm coming down the
[1:14:48] darkness job had this had been Assurance
[1:14:50] in his life I'm not lost
[1:14:53] he found me
[1:14:56] I'm not lost even if I go down by the
[1:14:59] grave that's what he's talking about but
[1:15:01] you will be there you even though I walk
[1:15:04] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:15:06] death not deep dark Valley that ain't
[1:15:09] scriptural it's the shadow because in
[1:15:12] order to be a shadow there's got to be
[1:15:14] light presence
[1:15:15] and the same light that led us into
[1:15:18] light is the same light that will lead
[1:15:21] us from this Dimension into the next
[1:15:23] dimension
[1:15:26] oh a land of darkness is Darkness itself
[1:15:28] and the shadow of death without any
[1:15:31] order and where the light is as Darkness
[1:15:36] so think about it
[1:15:37] the ram picks it up here in the Hebrew
[1:15:40] series and you just spoke that
[1:15:42] particular morning when God bringing his
[1:15:45] his children into certain
[1:15:47] places like before the Red Sea and how
[1:15:50] God would bring him into that place
[1:15:52] and he says you know how Israel
[1:15:55] every time it came to a showdown they
[1:15:58] would fly loose and get weary and want
[1:16:00] to turn back and why did this happen to
[1:16:02] me
[1:16:03] but he said to another Brown said now
[1:16:05] after I got done preaching that this
[1:16:06] morning the strange thing of it is I I
[1:16:08] preached it as hard as I could
[1:16:10] and there was many that came to the
[1:16:12] Altar and questioned it why does this
[1:16:15] happen to me now well brother bam has
[1:16:16] just ministered was is how God will
[1:16:19] bring us into different trials and tests
[1:16:23] and he said I just finished preaching
[1:16:25] that this morning and at the end of the
[1:16:27] morning service he said there were still
[1:16:29] those who came up front and he says they
[1:16:31] asked the question why does this happen
[1:16:34] to me
[1:16:35] brother van said you see how it goes It
[1:16:37] goes over the top of the people's hands
[1:16:40] it's just the same
[1:16:43] people they didn't say it's the same
[1:16:45] people he said it's the same it's people
[1:16:47] what's he speaking of humanity
[1:16:49] so here think about it in a service that
[1:16:52] these people were setting in and brother
[1:16:54] Branham led by the spirit of God because
[1:16:56] brother Brown goes into the very next
[1:16:58] statements he's trying to get him to see
[1:17:00] what who was present and speaking that
[1:17:02] morning Jesus said you have eyes but you
[1:17:04] can't see he sent it to the disciples
[1:17:06] and they said Lo thou speak as plainly
[1:17:08] now we believe no man has to tell you
[1:17:10] anything because God shows it to you do
[1:17:12] you now believe after all this time he's
[1:17:14] getting him to realize who was it that
[1:17:16] was speaking to you this morning see
[1:17:18] people were in the midst of tests and of
[1:17:20] Trials and brother Brown was bringing
[1:17:22] that out within the Hebrew series
[1:17:23] bringing out through the Exodus journey
[1:17:25] of how God will bring us into certain
[1:17:27] places and then here we are at the Red
[1:17:30] Sea and my brother Ram says it like this
[1:17:32] he said no doubt the people thought well
[1:17:33] glory to God this is the trial and this
[1:17:36] will be the final trial there'll never
[1:17:38] be any more trials after this and the
[1:17:39] Red Sea open and he said here it was
[1:17:41] just one thing right after another God
[1:17:43] was proving right but this is what I
[1:17:47] want you to see you see how the enemy
[1:17:49] would want to and would so distract the
[1:17:52] people from recognizing God is mindful
[1:17:56] of your situation
[1:17:58] they were consumed with why is this
[1:18:01] happening to me and that's a thought
[1:18:03] that will come from our Humanity but you
[1:18:05] understand this is why we come together
[1:18:07] this is why we pray this is why we come
[1:18:11] to the house of God to receive
[1:18:13] encouragement and strength God's not
[1:18:15] going to yank us out of a trial God's
[1:18:18] not going to do an emergency exit like
[1:18:20] there's a door that all of a sudden you
[1:18:22] get up to the roller coaster and you
[1:18:23] realize you're a bigger chicken than
[1:18:25] what you really are and there's all of a
[1:18:26] sudden a gate you can pass on through no
[1:18:28] that's not how trials are there are no
[1:18:31] emergency Gates there are no trap doors
[1:18:34] but there is Grace and strength that God
[1:18:38] ministers to you and I that we can look
[1:18:40] in the midst of the trial and in a
[1:18:43] service like this say thank you Lord you
[1:18:46] are with me Lord you're watching me and
[1:18:48] God is encouraging you to do what
[1:18:51] continue to rest in his hands that he
[1:18:54] can mold and shape
[1:18:57] Our Lives
[1:18:59] oh my brother Brian goes on to say he
[1:19:02] said see you mustn't question anything
[1:19:04] to God
[1:19:05] for the footsteps of the righteous is
[1:19:07] ordered of the Lord and every trial is
[1:19:10] put upon you to prove you
[1:19:12] they're more precious to you in Gold so
[1:19:14] if God let a few light afflictions
[1:19:17] happen to you remember
[1:19:19] it's for the correction
[1:19:21] of you now remember trials
[1:19:23] are not God correcting us
[1:19:27] but the Trials come for the correction
[1:19:30] of us well part of us need what what is
[1:19:32] the correction of us you know God lets
[1:19:35] the trial come
[1:19:36] that our character might be molded
[1:19:40] I won't ask you to raise your hands but
[1:19:42] sometimes you might look you think Lord
[1:19:44] have mercy why does it seem like I
[1:19:46] attract these kind of people or why does
[1:19:47] it seem like this comes my where you
[1:19:49] know why it is because God says that's
[1:19:51] what's needed in order to bring out of
[1:19:54] you what I have in you
[1:19:56] nothing else will do it oh but I just
[1:19:59] want to sit and hear a wonderful
[1:20:00] preaching preaching is to encourage you
[1:20:02] right the minister of the word it cuts
[1:20:05] Stones positioning them into the body
[1:20:07] but remember the trial of your faith is
[1:20:10] that which is between you and God
[1:20:12] personally
[1:20:14] not God you're pastoring you you and God
[1:20:19] it's molding and shaping on the sacred
[1:20:22] Sands of God's grace
[1:20:24] it's for the correction of you now I
[1:20:27] know God knows sometimes let's just be
[1:20:29] honest we're slow learners
[1:20:31] right even though we realize this guy's
[1:20:34] our biggest enemy but we think a lot
[1:20:35] about it we think a lot of him
[1:20:37] or her whatever it is
[1:20:39] oh as you can tell I mean you we do that
[1:20:42] but you see God helps us
[1:20:44] don't look down on yourself God is
[1:20:46] helping you and I the test or trial is
[1:20:49] helping us to see the correction that's
[1:20:52] needed in me
[1:20:54] not that you're not that oh I did
[1:20:56] something wrong and God's correct no no
[1:20:58] no it's the molding of our character
[1:21:03] Hallelujah that's why sometimes we can
[1:21:06] spend a lifetime running from situations
[1:21:08] and we look at and think
[1:21:10] the same situations come in my way guess
[1:21:12] what there's one common denominator here
[1:21:15] and that's you
[1:21:17] are you hearing me now
[1:21:19] there's one common thing and that's you
[1:21:21] and that's me
[1:21:22] so it isn't that boy this person oh my
[1:21:25] brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so
[1:21:27] are this boss or that wait wait
[1:21:29] recognize God is not the author of
[1:21:32] confusion God permits these things
[1:21:36] that it might bring a reflection in us
[1:21:38] oh God help me
[1:21:40] help me Lord to be a real reflector not
[1:21:43] a deflector
[1:21:45] you understand even in the things that
[1:21:48] you or I can be right but yet it also
[1:21:51] will God will get right down into where
[1:21:53] is our attitude
[1:21:56] every son that cometh to God must first
[1:21:58] be chastened of God tried and child
[1:22:00] trained there's no exceptions now he
[1:22:02] says these afflictions are done and are
[1:22:05] brought about to see what attitude
[1:22:08] you'll take
[1:22:10] and they say Lord help me to have the
[1:22:12] right attitude
[1:22:15] I believe that's what the scripture says
[1:22:17] rejoice
[1:22:18] that's what real rejoicing is is to be
[1:22:21] able to have the right attitude
[1:22:23] that's what we're rejoicing is that in
[1:22:25] the midst of it to have the right
[1:22:27] attitude Lord you're in control I don't
[1:22:30] know what's taking place around me but
[1:22:32] Lord help me just to stand I want to
[1:22:35] submit myself to you Lord
[1:22:37] what's to be molded out of my life I
[1:22:39] want to yield to you that's rejoicing
[1:22:42] because you can sit right here in a
[1:22:43] whole glory to God and not really be
[1:22:45] rejoicing you could really have an
[1:22:46] attitude against God
[1:22:50] come on now but you see it's in the
[1:22:52] midst of the trout what do you do in the
[1:22:54] midst of the trial
[1:22:56] do you stand faithful in the midst of
[1:22:57] the trial do you Worship in the midst of
[1:23:00] the trial or do you withdraw yourself
[1:23:03] see all of that is attitude that's
[1:23:05] rejoicing
[1:23:07] rejoicing oh my oh my how many say Lord
[1:23:11] help me
[1:23:12] I got both my hands up if I had more I'd
[1:23:15] put them up if I could put both my feet
[1:23:16] up and stand right here and I'd do it
[1:23:18] God help me to have the right attitude
[1:23:20] right because we're still here in our
[1:23:23] mortality in our Humanity God's
[1:23:25] encouraging us notice there's a Proving
[1:23:27] Ground that's what this Earth is all
[1:23:29] about it's The Proving Grounds where God
[1:23:32] is trying your eye now think about this
[1:23:35] within it how that God would move in in
[1:23:39] such a manner that you know even where
[1:23:41] job all of this has taken place you know
[1:23:44] this doesn't phase God whatsoever
[1:23:46] God's not setting up there saying
[1:23:48] you've bragged on him he's questioning
[1:23:50] he's he's acting like I'm the one oh man
[1:23:53] oh my here I did I got the bragging on
[1:23:56] that brother bragging on that sister no
[1:23:57] no God God's not looking at it that way
[1:24:00] you know why because what God was
[1:24:02] bragging on was that part of himself
[1:24:05] that he saw in job
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:08] he was bragging on his word because he
[1:24:11] is the word and we are a part of the
[1:24:13] word
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:15] God knew what job's flesh and Humanity
[1:24:18] would do in the midst of this time
[1:24:21] jump in even being a prophet he didn't
[1:24:24] have the understanding that you and I
[1:24:26] would be permitted and even yet tonight
[1:24:29] how many times have we heard messages
[1:24:32] and you you open a message and you're
[1:24:34] hearing a message and at the beginning
[1:24:36] of a message there'll be a statement
[1:24:37] brother Rand will make about trials and
[1:24:39] Proving Grounds but you see we need to
[1:24:43] hear that and be reminded and encouraged
[1:24:46] and God knows that
[1:24:52] but Satan was making him think this but
[1:24:54] he didn't they didn't change God's
[1:24:55] thoughts about Job whatsoever
[1:24:57] God's never had a new thought
[1:25:00] God's thoughts about job had never
[1:25:02] changed even like it was when
[1:25:04] discouragement had come to John when
[1:25:05] John
[1:25:06] could not understand why things were
[1:25:08] happening or weren't happening the way
[1:25:10] that he thought it was
[1:25:12] John had the right scripture
[1:25:15] John had the right scriptures but he's
[1:25:19] thinking about it is what hindered him
[1:25:22] he got his ego eye filmed over but I'm
[1:25:25] glad where there's a film there's still
[1:25:27] one who can break veils
[1:25:29] they'll repeat her God there was a
[1:25:32] longing inside of John Jesus knew Jesus
[1:25:35] never spoke one word against John he
[1:25:38] never said well that old sorry guy I
[1:25:40] tell you you know I wondered about him
[1:25:42] you know dressing like that and doing
[1:25:43] the things he did now look at him down
[1:25:45] there questioning no you see where we're
[1:25:48] anchored is on the Revelation and Jesus
[1:25:51] himself knew John was a spirit born man
[1:25:56] that was positioned in the word what did
[1:25:59] he what do you mean by that he knew all
[1:26:01] you've got to do listen I know what
[1:26:03] John's going through but you just stay
[1:26:04] around right here let him know what
[1:26:06] you've seen and then go tell him what is
[1:26:09] it I've got confidence in him he'll
[1:26:11] receive the word and be encouraged
[1:26:15] in prison
[1:26:17] oh I believe God would pass by our way
[1:26:19] tonight right here on Sheffield and God
[1:26:22] would encourage you and I might be in
[1:26:24] the midst of a test or trial but God
[1:26:26] said I've got some real sons and some
[1:26:28] real daughters down there I don't got to
[1:26:30] take them out of the trial I don't got
[1:26:32] to take them out of the situation but
[1:26:34] I'm just going to make myself more real
[1:26:37] to them in the midst of this trial
[1:26:41] glory be to God
[1:26:43] notice here in in John or in Job 14 5
[1:26:47] notice how job would speak seeing his
[1:26:51] days are determined the number of months
[1:26:54] are with thee that thou has appointed
[1:26:56] his bounds that he cannot pass turn from
[1:26:59] him
[1:27:00] that he may rest till he shall
[1:27:02] accomplish as a hireling his name
[1:27:06] you realize job would go on by
[1:27:07] inspiration and I think it's the next
[1:27:09] chapter within there job would speak
[1:27:11] under inspiration of what it was to be a
[1:27:14] servant a hireling meaning bad we are we
[1:27:17] are Sons and Daughters of God but we
[1:27:18] serve his purpose
[1:27:21] and this is what job is aware of that we
[1:27:23] are here to serve the purpose of God and
[1:27:25] job looking upon this situation turned
[1:27:28] from him until he hath accomplish his
[1:27:31] purpose but to realize nothing nothing
[1:27:35] can take us until the purpose of God has
[1:27:39] been fulfilled
[1:27:41] job doesn't know Joe thinks this is the
[1:27:44] end of his life he doesn't know there's
[1:27:46] going to be a turning point here
[1:27:48] he doesn't know that he doesn't he isn't
[1:27:51] moving within that all he knows is I
[1:27:53] don't know what's going to happen but
[1:27:54] job can tell you one thing I know I
[1:27:56] ain't lost
[1:27:58] I know that I don't know how old it's
[1:28:00] going to come out but I know I ain't
[1:28:01] lost but he doesn't understand what's
[1:28:04] going on right here
[1:28:08] job 16 6 though I speak my grief is not
[1:28:12] a saged and though I forbear what am I
[1:28:15] ease so there's nothing that's actually
[1:28:18] bringing him release
[1:28:20] but now he hath made me weary
[1:28:26] God hath made me weary thou Hast made
[1:28:29] desolate all my company
[1:28:31] God hath delivered me to the ungodly and
[1:28:34] turned me over into the hands of the
[1:28:36] wicked
[1:28:37] he's as he said he's desolate all my
[1:28:40] company in other words all my friends
[1:28:44] I don't got nobody around me to
[1:28:45] encourage me
[1:28:47] even my wife
[1:28:49] even the maid
[1:28:52] turns when I ask her for some new sheets
[1:28:55] on the bed
[1:28:56] of course job wasn't even sleeping in
[1:28:58] the bed
[1:28:59] right
[1:29:01] everything
[1:29:02] my friends everything that was part of
[1:29:05] the trial
[1:29:08] job could have easily think about it in
[1:29:11] the midst of the trial and what's taken
[1:29:13] place he could have very easily loaded
[1:29:16] his gun
[1:29:17] and
[1:29:20] are you with me
[1:29:22] he could have released and became bitter
[1:29:25] against everybody that was around him
[1:29:29] is that right
[1:29:32] my where does time go
[1:29:36] I was at ease in verse 12 but he hath
[1:29:39] broken me asunder he also taken me by my
[1:29:43] neck and shaken me to pieces and set me
[1:29:46] up for his mark
[1:29:48] Joe who's done this
[1:29:50] God has done this
[1:29:54] his archers compassed me round about he
[1:29:57] cleaveth my Reigns asunder and doth not
[1:29:59] spare he poureth out my gall upon the
[1:30:01] ground he breaketh me with breach upon
[1:30:03] breach he runeth upon me like a giant
[1:30:07] job 17 6 he hath made me also a byword
[1:30:13] of the people
[1:30:15] so not only the friends that was all
[1:30:17] around him but remember job was regarded
[1:30:19] as a man of wisdom
[1:30:22] and understanding he was also a man that
[1:30:25] would encourage others he was one that
[1:30:28] God would use as a vessel to help other
[1:30:31] people
[1:30:32] and here was a man that's now become a
[1:30:34] byword when at one time as the scripture
[1:30:37] said I was as a tablet in other words
[1:30:39] God would give understanding through the
[1:30:42] vessel to help others
[1:30:45] but that's all part
[1:30:47] of the testing and of the trying
[1:30:51] think of this here in job 19.
[1:30:54] and verse 6.
[1:30:56] now know now that God hath overthrown me
[1:31:00] I'm reading these scriptures as they
[1:31:03] come
[1:31:03] we're dealing with how that you can see
[1:31:06] the effect of
[1:31:07] Satan
[1:31:09] wanting to make job think this is God
[1:31:12] punishing him
[1:31:14] know now that God hath overthrown me and
[1:31:17] have compassed me with his net behold I
[1:31:20] cry out of wrong but I'm not heard I cry
[1:31:23] aloud but there's no judgment
[1:31:26] there's nothing coming my way and
[1:31:28] remember in the earlier scripture job
[1:31:30] said I'm confusion why was he confused
[1:31:33] because job knew I've done everything
[1:31:36] Lord that you've asked of me
[1:31:39] I have everything that you've revealed
[1:31:42] to me
[1:31:43] done it
[1:31:46] does that mean that job didn't have
[1:31:48] mistakes no he wasn't saying that but
[1:31:50] what it did say was Joe knew there was a
[1:31:53] perpetuation
[1:31:54] Joe knew that when there had been
[1:31:56] mistakes that he had went and the blood
[1:31:59] had cleansed he was in fellowship with
[1:32:02] God and so his confusion was what's
[1:32:05] going on
[1:32:08] what's going on
[1:32:11] he hath fenced up my way that I cannot
[1:32:13] pass and he hath set darkness in my
[1:32:16] paths he has stripped me of my glory and
[1:32:19] taken the crown from my head he hath
[1:32:21] destroyed me on every side and I'm gone
[1:32:23] My Hope hath he removed like a tree
[1:32:27] he also hath kindled his wrath against
[1:32:30] me and counted me unto him as one of his
[1:32:34] enemies all if we could stop job right
[1:32:36] now and say job that's not true
[1:32:42] you are not his enemy you are his friend
[1:32:48] you are his buddy
[1:32:51] he has revealed his will to you he is
[1:32:55] not looking on you as
[1:32:58] this enemy
[1:33:00] because God
[1:33:02] does not change his mind
[1:33:09] what a powerful thought
[1:33:11] isn't it brother Brown preaches it's the
[1:33:13] rising of the Sun that morning and that
[1:33:15] night he preaches God does not change
[1:33:17] his mind
[1:33:19] starts in the very beginning of that
[1:33:21] service does God change his mind
[1:33:22] rehearsing going over what had just
[1:33:24] taken place that morning then he goes
[1:33:26] into rehearsing how that Satan will come
[1:33:28] and buff it at you punch at you poke at
[1:33:30] you try to make you think you don't got
[1:33:32] the Holy Ghost and on and on he goes in
[1:33:34] through all that what is it these aren't
[1:33:36] just titles of a message it's letting
[1:33:39] you and I know that when God has put his
[1:33:42] shield of approval upon our life that
[1:33:45] God does not change his mind
[1:33:48] God does not give the Holy Ghost and
[1:33:51] then take back the Holy Ghost we are
[1:33:53] sealed until the day of our Redemption
[1:33:58] glory be to God in the highest
[1:34:01] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] his troops come together
[1:34:05] raise up their way against me and Camp
[1:34:07] round about my Tabernacle he hath put my
[1:34:10] brethren once again you see how
[1:34:12] important this is
[1:34:14] he hath put my brethren far from me and
[1:34:16] mine acquaintance are very estranged
[1:34:18] from me there is multiple times in the
[1:34:20] Book of Job where job will refer to this
[1:34:22] at different times you know why
[1:34:25] as I said before when somebody says oh
[1:34:29] you know the sayings dicks and stones
[1:34:30] may break my bones or words will never
[1:34:31] hurt me that's a lie
[1:34:34] and whoever came up with a liar
[1:34:37] because words hurt
[1:34:39] it's the truth they hurt
[1:34:42] right but we're not here to glorify
[1:34:44] those things
[1:34:48] but it shows you right here
[1:34:50] of all this that job is feeling he's
[1:34:52] he's looking for encouragement
[1:34:55] if I can just be encouraged just
[1:34:57] strengthen and you know sometimes the
[1:34:59] way we encourage one another is simply
[1:35:01] by doing this
[1:35:03] and opening these things up
[1:35:05] right
[1:35:06] sometimes I think some of us need some
[1:35:08] Hearing Aids on here to roll them up
[1:35:10] when we need a garage door opener here
[1:35:13] alone
[1:35:15] and God just wants us to listen
[1:35:20] to here
[1:35:22] and be able to say
[1:35:23] praying for you brother
[1:35:25] I know God God's brought me through
[1:35:27] sister God's brought me through some
[1:35:29] things
[1:35:30] it may not be exactly alike but I know
[1:35:32] God is no respect to person
[1:35:34] and God ain't left you
[1:35:36] he's right there with you
[1:35:38] to help you and to bring you through we
[1:35:40] need that encouragement
[1:35:42] let me tell you something in the midst
[1:35:43] of all this right here you know what you
[1:35:46] know what job is receiving Satan is
[1:35:48] coming right up next to him and
[1:35:50] whispering
[1:35:51] God's punishing you
[1:35:54] God's punishing you
[1:35:57] same way that he'll come now think about
[1:35:59] how the devil will do that he'll come
[1:36:01] right around
[1:36:04] certain things can start taking place
[1:36:05] and he'll get right into our minds you
[1:36:08] know so and so where they don't care for
[1:36:09] you
[1:36:10] so and so don't like them don't get
[1:36:12] quiet on me now
[1:36:13] what would you do I will believe God's
[1:36:17] word
[1:36:18] above that line devil
[1:36:20] and I'll tell you this right now why
[1:36:21] because you entertain that you'll take
[1:36:23] something in
[1:36:25] the best thing to do is I want to
[1:36:27] believe the best about God's people I
[1:36:31] want to believe the best about another
[1:36:32] person say wait a minute here devil I am
[1:36:34] not going to receive that you say what
[1:36:36] do you mean God Is Not An accuser of the
[1:36:39] brethren
[1:36:40] are you with me well what do I do with
[1:36:43] an accuser act like your daddy throw him
[1:36:45] down
[1:36:46] throw him down God cast down the accuser
[1:36:50] of the brethren
[1:36:52] don't entertain those lies because look
[1:36:54] it might be failed but the same time I

[1:37:39] he said I want you to remember
[1:37:41] God
[1:37:42] has confidence in you

[1:37:48] God has confidence in you
[1:37:50] you see what God is doing here right
[1:37:52] right here in this moment of of this
[1:37:54] time where we're standing
[1:37:56] in an end time
[1:37:58] standing in a closing
[1:38:00] closing of world's history standing in
[1:38:02] this moment but yet here's in a moment
[1:38:05] where understanding is coming
[1:38:07] like never before sure you know why we
[1:38:11] need it
[1:38:13] we need it the rest as the rest of the
[1:38:16] ages and every believer has stood like
[1:38:18] job stood down through time job's a type
[1:38:21] of the body of Jesus Christ all the way
[1:38:23] down through time and then at the end
[1:38:25] time understanding would come
[1:38:30] and God lets you and I know in through a
[1:38:33] channel
[1:38:34] that God's Got Confidence in US
[1:38:37] when God lets attest when God lets a
[1:38:39] trial come our way it's because he has
[1:38:42] confidence in you
[1:38:44] but then we'll just say it like this and
[1:38:46] I close here he says
[1:38:47] sometimes he said we him and we Haul
[1:38:50] about it but that's something that God
[1:38:53] has given you to overcome
[1:38:56] he knows you'll do it
[1:38:58] he's put his Trust
[1:39:00] in you
[1:39:02] so you want to know Lord do you trust me
[1:39:05] he sends tests
[1:39:07] and trials
[1:39:09] our way
[1:39:11] that's his confidence
[1:39:13] that's his Trust
[1:39:15] I said Lord make me more like you
[1:39:18] help me Lord Jesus help me Lord help me
[1:39:20] to have the right attitude with it no
[1:39:23] matter what the test no matter what the
[1:39:24] trial if it's something that's being
[1:39:26] said you know even misunderstandings
[1:39:28] that we can be misunderstood you know
[1:39:30] that's also a test or trial What
[1:39:31] attitude we're going to take within it
[1:39:33] what kind of attitude are we going to
[1:39:35] take I say Lord I want my attitude to be
[1:39:37] sweetened with you Lord Jesus
[1:39:41] I want it to be sweet Lord
[1:39:45] Heavenly Father
[1:39:49] Lord I realized it
[1:39:51] as we look over this Lord here this
[1:39:53] evening
[1:39:55] Lord just looking Lord upon job's life
[1:39:59] and in this moment Lord
[1:40:01] oh God how that Lord
[1:40:04] our hearts Lord are encouraged
[1:40:07] and challenged Lord at the same time
[1:40:10] Lord just how mindful
[1:40:13] that you are
[1:40:15] oh God and you know
[1:40:17] you know our Humanity but that's not
[1:40:19] anything you focus on
[1:40:21] so that's you Lord letting us know
[1:40:24] that we're not to be focused on it
[1:40:26] but Lord I pray that God that in the
[1:40:29] midst of these
[1:40:30] tests and trials and times the Lord help
[1:40:33] us Lord that we can have the right
[1:40:36] attitude Lord within it
[1:40:38] help us Lord I pray that in the midst of
[1:40:40] it Lord that that even as job himself
[1:40:43] Lord did not understand
[1:40:46] what was going on
[1:40:47] but yet Lord he was standing
[1:40:50] solid
[1:40:52] your Prophet called it like this
[1:40:54] flat-footed
[1:40:55] on that Revelation that you had given to
[1:40:59] him you had spoke to job personally Lord
[1:41:03] and though in this situation
[1:41:06] Lord God he did not have inspiration to
[1:41:10] understand what was going on
[1:41:12] he was trying to find the inspiration
[1:41:14] that he was trying to find Lord because
[1:41:17] as we read here earlier he said he knew
[1:41:21] that it was with you Lord that if he
[1:41:24] could just get
[1:41:26] job would write of this Lord and many
[1:41:28] times it would come Lord sometimes in
[1:41:31] two verses 3 Verses 4 verses five verses
[1:41:33] Lord in different chapters and his
[1:41:35] requests would be if I can just talk to
[1:41:38] him
[1:41:40] if I can just talk to him
[1:41:43] Lord sometimes the hardest times in our
[1:41:46] life
[1:41:47] is when you're silent
[1:41:50] and we're praying and we're asking Lord
[1:41:52] and oh God it's as though you remain
[1:41:55] silent that's the time lord when we
[1:41:57] become tested
[1:41:59] that's the time lord where the enemy
[1:42:01] Lord will want to try to move up Lord
[1:42:03] with
[1:42:04] many different types of accusations and
[1:42:07] things but Lord this is where we've got
[1:42:10] to be sure of where we're standing Lord
[1:42:12] amen and Lord Jesus to know that
[1:42:15] Lord God you are my righteousness Lord
[1:42:19] yeah
[1:42:20] You're My All In All Lord everything
[1:42:23] you've spoke to me Lord the things that
[1:42:25] God that you've convicted me on things
[1:42:27] Lord that you've dealt with me on Lord
[1:42:29] I've walked Lord and Lord to be moved
[1:42:32] Lord into that place with you Lord
[1:42:35] that father in the midst of these
[1:42:37] moments as your Prophet would tell us
[1:42:39] and take us through many examples in the
[1:42:41] scriptures that when you're silent
[1:42:44] that's the test that comes to see what
[1:42:47] kind of an attitude that we will take
[1:42:50] during that time
[1:42:52] help us the Lord I pray
[1:42:54] oh God I I realize the Lord Jesus here
[1:42:57] tonight Lord and maybe those Lord that
[1:43:00] are streaming or will stream it Lord I
[1:43:02] pray God tonight even as the word would
[1:43:04] come Lord and bring a reflection in our
[1:43:06] life Lord to realize Lord there is a
[1:43:09] ground that we can stand on Lord if
[1:43:11] there's been lives Lord that have been
[1:43:13] in and out and when the Lord attest has
[1:43:15] come Lord then right back out into the
[1:43:17] world oh the test never put us back out
[1:43:19] in the world but there is a place Lord
[1:43:22] God that we can come to Lord to where
[1:43:24] there's an anchor in our life to where
[1:43:26] there is no longer any place to go back
[1:43:31] to Lord
[1:43:32] I pray God tonight grant that Lord for
[1:43:34] each life granted Lord I pray God here
[1:43:37] Lord among your children Lord as father
[1:43:40] even in the midst Lord God of the
[1:43:43] weakness of our Humanity Lord God may
[1:43:45] you Lord strengthen us Lord I pray
[1:43:47] strengthen us the Lord God in these
[1:43:49] moments Lord father service after
[1:43:52] service Lord day after day Lord
[1:43:55] sometimes the Lord in the midst of that
[1:43:57] silence but yet Lord you'll come right
[1:43:59] through his service Lord maybe Lord
[1:44:00] listening Lord to a message Lord maybe
[1:44:03] Lord God reading Lord and the
[1:44:04] scripture's there and God you'll just
[1:44:06] speak to us Lord there'll be something
[1:44:08] that'll just strengthen us Lord to
[1:44:10] encourage us the Lord I pray God may we
[1:44:14] lord I pray be sensitive the Lord to
[1:44:17] your voice
[1:44:18] help us Lord I pray may we lord God I
[1:44:21] believe we know this Lord but may we be
[1:44:23] more aware of it that when we come to
[1:44:25] the house of God the Lord that we bring
[1:44:28] o God every request every petition and
[1:44:32] say Lord I need you to move Lord maybe
[1:44:35] Lord God isn't you coming and moving the
[1:44:38] situation on maybe it's you coming Lord
[1:44:41] and moving Me Lord
[1:44:44] may be Lord It's you coming Lord God to
[1:44:47] call me as the song Lord God that the
[1:44:50] writer had wrote Lord sometimes he calms
[1:44:52] the storms sometimes he calms me
[1:44:57] oh God granted Lord I pray

[1:45:21] every one of these Lord and place them
[1:45:23] at your feet and say Lord I need
[1:45:25] strength Lord God my flesh wants to
[1:45:28] dodge this trial My Flesh wants to dodge
[1:45:31] this test but God I'm asking you for
[1:45:34] Grace Lord I need more grace Lord God to
[1:45:38] go through it Lord help me Lord I pray

[1:45:48] amen and amen
[1:45:50] oh don't you love him
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:54] hallelujah we're not enemies we're
[1:45:57] friends
[1:45:59] we're friends the trial is not
[1:46:02] God positioning himself as mine enemy
[1:46:06] but the trial itself if Joe could only
[1:46:08] know
[1:46:10] if that would only open that channel
[1:46:13] that job had access to
[1:46:16] but you see job being a prophet it
[1:46:18] doesn't mean that a prophet can do it
[1:46:20] when he wants to do it
[1:46:22] it's God that opens it as he wants to
[1:46:24] open it
[1:46:25] right all the way through the scriptures
[1:46:27] on the Isle of Patmos when the angel
[1:46:29] would take John around what are these
[1:46:31] and the angel said and John said thou
[1:46:32] knowest what are they in the book of
[1:46:34] Zechariah he awake of me as a one as a
[1:46:36] man is wakened out of sleep and pointed
[1:46:38] to the seven golden candlesticks and
[1:46:39] said what are these he said thou knowest
[1:46:41] what are they right Jacob was presented
[1:46:45] with a coat of many colors that he gave
[1:46:47] Joseph and blood covered and his
[1:46:50] Brethren had said he died
[1:46:53] yeah
[1:46:55] Israel was a prophet
[1:46:57] God could have revealed it to him but
[1:47:00] God kept it
[1:47:01] why it was all part of God's plan
[1:47:05] some things there's things that God
[1:47:08] shows us
[1:47:10] and there's other things that God in his
[1:47:12] time
[1:47:13] he lets us know
[1:47:15] but in the midst of it don't let his
[1:47:17] silence or
[1:47:18] lack of understanding on something
[1:47:20] hinder you say Lord I'm going to worship
[1:47:23] you
[1:47:24] because you've got the understanding
[1:47:26] that I need I may not understand what's
[1:47:27] going on but I know you've got a hold of
[1:47:29] my life
[1:47:30] I know that and that's one thing that I
[1:47:33] can rejoice in I can rejoice in that
[1:47:34] Lord
[1:47:35] be to God the job could have only seen
[1:47:39] it job what's taking place is God called
[1:47:42] a testimony meeting as a matter of fact
[1:47:44] God had a series of meetings about you
[1:47:46] job
[1:47:47] he called for back-to-back times and he
[1:47:50] bragged on you
[1:47:51] but job didn't have that
[1:47:54] he didn't have that understanding he
[1:47:55] said brother Samuel what would that have
[1:47:57] done that would have given him the
[1:47:59] understanding to what was going on and
[1:48:02] what was taking place
[1:48:06] Hallelujah but you know what it just
[1:48:09] goes to show you and I
[1:48:11] that even though we don't understand
[1:48:14] but there's something greater than our
[1:48:16] understanding
[1:48:18] right
[1:48:19] for though I understand all Mysteries
[1:48:24] they'll understand all these things and
[1:48:25] have not charity on nothing
