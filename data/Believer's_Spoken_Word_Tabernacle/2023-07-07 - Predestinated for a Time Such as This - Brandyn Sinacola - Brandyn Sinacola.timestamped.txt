[33:00] I guess I can call it a series it was
[33:03] over a number of services back home

[33:08] I think it's just a beautiful love story
[33:11] and it got to the point where every time
[33:13] I'd opened and I'd start reading that
[33:15] something was just jumping out and
[33:16] jumping out and there was one day that I
[33:19] I was reading and I and I just shut the
[33:22] book real fast and I thought oh Lord
[33:23] this is I I don't know what to do with
[33:26] all this so it I'm thankful to them and
[33:29] so just pray we could bring some of that
[33:31] tonight encourage you or and strengthen

[33:46] for if thou all together Hold Us thy
[33:49] peace at this time
[33:50] then shall their enlargement and
[33:53] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[33:55] another place
[33:56] but thou and thy father's house shall be
[33:59] destroyed

[34:02] the kingdom for such a time as this
[34:06] pray father

[34:10] I was just thinking Lord we
[34:14] say things Lord like I have on my heart
[34:16] God has kind of just settle our own
[34:18] nerves father but I just I feel like my
[34:20] notes have been a mess and trying to put
[34:23] them together and so I just ask you Lord
[34:25] to come and take over now
[34:28] and speak to this people father lead my
[34:31] heart God I just want to I just want to
[34:33] get out of the way completely
[34:35] and let you speak father
[34:37] so Lord when I stepped down and walk out
[34:40] the back the people will say that it's
[34:43] been good to be in the house of the Lord
[34:45] and they'll know that you pass by their
[34:48] way tonight father
[34:50] granted Lord bless bless the pastor if
[34:52] Lord I don't know if he's speaking
[34:54] tonight I know they're at the camp bless
[34:56] them bless the services there
[34:58] let the young people come back with
[35:00] great testimonies
[35:02] father if they haven't been filled yet
[35:04] fill them tonight
[35:06] we pray in Jesus name
[35:08] amen amen you can have your seats as
[35:12] you're being seated I greet you from
[35:14] Brother Paul our pastor and littler Life
[35:17] Church back home my wife said to give
[35:20] you her love she she couldn't make it
[35:22] with me tonight and was disappointed she
[35:24] said she always feels real welcome and
[35:26] and free here so just thank you for that
[35:30] so I just want to look at the story of
[35:32] Esther and and I'll try you know I guess
[35:35] we'll just start uh you know verse one
[35:37] it talks about gives you a good uh
[35:40] impression a good view into what the
[35:43] medes and Persian Empire was like and
[35:45] you could jump over into Daniel and
[35:48] Daniel for seeing it and and seeing the
[35:51] the
[35:52] elaborates of the kingdom and then you
[35:54] read an Esther and and it's just it's
[35:57] talking about the king and he was the
[35:59] richest king uh if from my understanding
[36:02] from history King
[36:05] Xerxes here
[36:07] um he was he was one of the richest
[36:09] kings and it was the the the kingdom had
[36:13] become to be one of the most illustrious
[36:16] portions of the medes and Persian Empire
[36:19] and and it actually just kind of struck
[36:22] my heart because I thought my goodness
[36:23] you know when you look at Christ he's
[36:25] the richest of all the kings he's the
[36:27] king of kings he's the Lord of lords and
[36:29] and so that just kind of set the stage
[36:32] of the story for me and and looking at
[36:34] it and then you have you have a bride
[36:37] vashti and and the King sends his word
[36:40] to her and she rejects his word
[36:43] and because she rejected his word she
[36:46] gets rejected and she gets cast out of
[36:48] the kingdom and and so then he says you
[36:51] know this this virgin didn't accept me
[36:53] he she didn't accept my word he said go
[36:56] find me another one go find me another
[36:58] one and so so the word goes forward to
[37:01] draw a bride to himself somebody
[37:04] somebody who would who would know the
[37:06] king's heart who would live the king's
[37:08] heart
[37:09] you could just draw many types of even
[37:12] even husband and wife in there and I and
[37:14] I think we've done it before here the
[37:15] Lord just you know following rabbit
[37:18] trails and things as you preach but you
[37:20] know but you just have
[37:22] vashti as a wife and she's just the way
[37:26] she treated her husband and the way that
[37:28] she she kind of became the head of the
[37:30] home but then you have Esther coming
[37:32] under that headship of the king and and
[37:34] wanting to to not not know you see the
[37:38] whole process of Esther as she's getting
[37:40] going through the the
[37:43] um purification process and even to her
[37:46] night with the King and and all these
[37:48] women you know the the the the the the
[37:50] the the prophet tells her you can have
[37:53] whatever you want and you can take it
[37:54] with you when you're done you get you
[37:57] get one night with the King if he
[37:58] doesn't Choose You you keep whatever you
[38:00] chose and they're just just this
[38:03] wonderful Jubilee of taking all the gold
[38:05] and all the blessings but nobody wanted
[38:08] to know what the king's heart was except
[38:10] for Esther and so Esther comes and she
[38:13] she goes and I'm just calling him a
[38:15] prophet and she says a prophet I want to
[38:17] know what's the king's heart
[38:20] and so I imagine he just starts telling
[38:22] her what the king enjoys what he likes
[38:24] what he finds pretty what he finds
[38:26] pretty in a woman what he finds what he
[38:29] finds handsome in a man what a true man
[38:31] is what a true woman is and he starts
[38:33] portraying the king's heart to this
[38:35] little this little Queen this little
[38:37] bride this little virgin
[38:40] and so he's he's so you just see the
[38:42] perfect picture of God start to unfold
[38:45] even in the story of Esther and and so
[38:48] then in in this this uh kind of turn of
[38:52] events in chapter 3 and verse one it
[38:55] says after these things did King
[38:57] ahazarus promote Haman the son of
[38:59] hamedatha the agagite
[39:03] and I just thought it was interesting I
[39:04] thought why why does the scripture just
[39:07] just happen to throw in oh this is this
[39:10] isn't just his name this isn't just he's
[39:12] the son of this lengthy name he says he
[39:16] says he's an agagite
[39:18] and so I thought well why in the world
[39:20] would the scripture just give you that
[39:21] that little detail in there but if you
[39:24] start following the agagite the agagite
[39:27] lineage goes back into Genesis and we
[39:29] actually find Esau had a son and named
[39:32] him emalek then you can look and you
[39:35] could start tracing amalek in the
[39:37] scripture and over in Exodus 17 8-14 we
[39:40] won't read it for time's sake but amalek
[39:42] is found and he's going against the
[39:44] children of Israel
[39:46] they're coming out of they're coming out
[39:48] of Egypt they're going into the promised
[39:51] land and on this journey into the
[39:53] promised land emulet comes and he starts
[39:56] fighting the children of Israel I don't
[39:57] know why he started fighting them I
[39:59] don't think the scripture says it just
[40:01] says they met him and he started
[40:03] fighting him
[40:04] and so you have this battle set in a ray
[40:06] on their Journey to the promised land
[40:10] Schofield writes this note about amalek
[40:12] and I just thought it was noteworthy
[40:14] says amalek was born after the Flesh and
[40:17] and he's the progenerator of the
[40:19] amalekites Israel's persistent enemy it
[40:22] wasn't just the one time they came it
[40:24] was just as you find Israel fighting
[40:26] it's always against the amalekites the
[40:28] amalekites are always involved and so
[40:31] they become a persistent enemy Schofield
[40:34] says it's a type of the Flesh of the
[40:36] believer we know that the prophet said
[40:38] that your greatest enemy is yourself
[40:41] it's your own flesh it's my flesh it's
[40:44] your flesh and so this flesh becomes a
[40:46] persistent enemy against us
[40:49] he that was born after the flesh
[40:52] persecuted him that was born after the
[40:55] spirit even so it is now and you'll find
[40:57] that even in in uh Romans and Galatians
[41:00] it says that the the Flesh and the
[41:03] spirit war after one another it's this
[41:06] continual Battle of of right going on
[41:09] inside of you
[41:11] there's a continual battle in your mind
[41:13] it's it's a battle of of Paul Paul said
[41:16] and I think it's Romans 7 he said when I
[41:18] want to do good I I can't seem to do
[41:20] good I don't want to do evil yet I seem
[41:23] to find myself doing evil and but but
[41:25] then in there is another thread of Grace
[41:28] that God gives and he says there's a law
[41:31] of of sin and death but then you enter
[41:34] into a law of of spirit and life
[41:37] and that law is greater than the law of
[41:40] sin and death so even though we will war
[41:43] against amalek
[41:45] uh let me just continue reading the
[41:47] conflict with emalek in chapter 17 sets
[41:50] forth the resources of the man under law
[41:52] rather than those of the believer under
[41:55] grace the man under law could fight and
[41:58] pray under grace the Holy Spirit gains
[42:01] the victory over the Flesh and the
[42:03] believer's behalf
[42:06] and so
[42:07] but this Victory is only as the believer
[42:10] walks in the spirit acting in
[42:13] independency or Disobedience Emma let
[42:16] the flesh gains an easy Victory so we
[42:19] have to continually walk in the spirit
[42:21] so that the flesh can't have that
[42:24] preeminence over you so that you're
[42:26] constantly your mindset needs to
[42:28] constantly be on the word and constantly
[42:30] on the things of God because if you just
[42:32] let yourself go for just a minute then
[42:34] Satan can come in and he gets an easy
[42:36] victory
[42:40] but I'm so thankful and I'm so thankful
[42:47] you know we could be a discouraged
[42:49] people knowing that my goodness and we
[42:51] know
[42:52] the prophet said that you know you're
[42:54] you and and I'm sure I've said these
[42:56] things I know you know them but you know
[42:58] you two parts of you is unsaved only one
[43:00] part of you is converted only one part
[43:03] of you is sealed and so you know brother
[43:05] Branham said Satan has a punch it a
[43:08] Punch coming to you and he will he'll
[43:10] continually punch at us until we get out
[43:12] of here you have to keep that part
[43:14] covered you have to keep it you have to
[43:15] you have to learn yourself you can't
[43:17] this is it this isn't just it's a
[43:20] spiritual battle but you have to know
[43:22] yourself you have to know your enemy you
[43:24] have to you have to watch you have to
[43:26] pray you have to say man Lord I keep I
[43:28] keep failing in this area what is this
[43:30] that might be your one punch you need to
[43:32] shore it up you need to start blocking
[43:35] Satan's punches but it'll always shape
[43:37] of the flesh over in Deuteronomy 25 God
[43:41] is talking and he says I will blot out
[43:44] the remembrance of amalek forever
[43:47] so there's coming A Day friends that
[43:49] that though though we get weary in these
[43:52] bodies we get weary in this flesh
[43:54] there's coming a day when this flesh
[43:56] will be blotted out the remembrance will
[43:59] be blotted out
[44:00] and we'll Rejoice with the king forever
[44:04] so Esther 3 in in verse 1 so just
[44:08] continuing there for a moment says
[44:10] talking of of the king and promoting uh
[44:13] Haman he Advanced him and set his seat
[44:16] above all the princes that were with him
[44:18] and all the king's servants that were in
[44:21] the king's gate that were in the king's
[44:22] gate bowed and reverenced Haman for the
[44:25] king had so commanded concerning him but
[44:27] Mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
[44:31] and you'll watch a little bit further
[44:33] down I just I forgot it worded this way
[44:35] verse 5.
[44:37] there was one who who wasn't bowing down
[44:40] to him there was a seed of God there
[44:41] that wasn't going to bow to Haman and
[44:44] and it says because he wouldn't bow nor
[44:47] did him reverence then was Haman full of
[44:50] Wrath and there's been uh Stephen
[44:53] carrussell came through our way recently
[44:55] and and preached about Warfare and and
[44:58] our pastors been taken breaking down
[45:00] Satan's wrath and and and you can look
[45:03] at multiple scriptures
[45:05] um there was a king over in Nehemiah and
[45:07] he just the the Wrath it doesn't say
[45:09] just wrath it's it's not just wrath
[45:12] anymore it's exceeding wrath it's it's
[45:15] it's there's there's an exponential
[45:17] growth to Satan's wrath and we're
[45:19] feeling the effects of that I'm sure if
[45:22] you're a Believer tonight you feel the
[45:23] effects that Satan is getting more and
[45:25] more Angry the attack is getting greater
[45:28] and greater
[45:30] but but we got to look at this because
[45:32] even though Haman becomes angry even
[45:34] though he's promoted we know that that
[45:37] Satan was God's right-hand man
[45:40] right
[45:42] all right we know our scripture right
[45:45] he was he was the right hand of God he
[45:47] was God's right-hand man and then when
[45:48] he fell he took a third of the angels
[45:50] with him right amen so so we can start
[45:54] seeing this type and and
[45:57] Haman getting angry and and then he's
[46:00] gonna bring it down and but it's just
[46:02] it's so interesting to me verse 8 and
[46:04] Haman said unto the king ahazarus there
[46:07] is a certain people scattered abroad and
[46:10] dispersed among the people and all the
[46:12] provinces of thy kingdom and their laws
[46:14] are diverse from all people neither keep
[46:16] they the king's laws therefore it is not
[46:19] for the king's Prophet to suffer them
[46:22] he just told a lie on God's people
[46:26] that's right he just accused he just
[46:28] accused God's people he went before the
[46:30] king and he accused God's people you
[46:32] have an accuser that stands before God
[46:35] and accuses you day and night amen and
[46:38] and
[46:39] you know it just reminded me comes to
[46:41] mind where where you know David goes and
[46:44] he goes into the battlefield and he's
[46:47] taking his his brother some bread or
[46:49] some sandwiches and and I I'm not sure
[46:53] what part but you remember his brother
[46:55] say David you're naughty
[46:57] David you just you got naughtiness in
[47:00] your heart
[47:01] and it's just this accusation when you
[47:03] have a purity and a desire for the Lord
[47:06] and you're you're trying to live the
[47:08] life of Christ and you make a mistake
[47:10] and you get back up and you make a
[47:12] mistake you might get back up and make
[47:14] the same mistake and you get back up and
[47:16] and there was a brother he said it's
[47:18] it's uh um I forget where what exactly
[47:22] the way it's worded but it was a wash
[47:24] pot and he said
[47:25] you know it's just that's where all the
[47:27] feet come to be washed it's just the
[47:29] filth it's this cycle that that you get
[47:31] stuck in it and it's not saying you
[47:33] don't have the Holy Ghost you have the
[47:35] Holy Ghost and you can still get in
[47:36] cycles of the wash pot where you're
[47:39] constantly up and down in the same thing
[47:41] I'm not saying you have to live there
[47:42] there's power to overcome through the
[47:44] Holy Ghost amen
[47:50] but you go through that enough and and
[47:52] my goodness you can get so discouraged
[47:54] in your mind you can get so
[47:56] so beat down and so to me to where
[47:59] Esther becomes but we'll find in a
[48:02] minute that Queen Esther
[48:04] and and and you the bride
[48:07] you have the power
[48:09] Haman thought he had the power he
[48:12] thought he had the preeminence in the
[48:14] king's in the King's Castle he thought
[48:16] he had power over the queen but will
[48:19] find that he didn't
[48:21] if it pleased the king Let It Be written
[48:24] that they may be destroyed do you
[48:26] remember Satan came to came to God
[48:30] and he was going to and fro it says and
[48:33] and the the the sons of God came before
[48:36] God and and do you know brother Stephen
[48:38] Caruso I love this so much
[48:41] it wasn't Satan that came and said hey
[48:45] your servant job
[48:47] Stephen brother Stephen he actually
[48:49] worded it this way he said he said God
[48:51] actually picked the fight
[48:54] and I thought I have never I've never
[48:57] thought of that before but that's
[48:59] exactly that's exactly what he did God
[49:01] picked a fight so why why excuse me
[49:06] why is it I'm going through this Lord
[49:08] why is this so hard why is this trial
[49:10] why why is this one sick why is this one
[49:13] and you you question God but it's
[49:16] because God had confidence in you so
[49:19] much that he picked a fight with the
[49:21] Devil
[49:22] and he said hey what about them have you
[49:24] thought about them
[49:25] my goodness
[49:27] Lord I
[49:29] did
[49:30] maybe don't have that confidence
[49:34] but God knows and this is this is I I
[49:37] wanna I didn't feel like I did this when
[49:39] I preached it at home I want to drive it
[49:41] tonight as we get to it that you have
[49:44] what you need within you
[49:46] you have what you need God has placed
[49:49] what you need inside of you and so it
[49:51] doesn't matter what the what Satan does
[49:53] it doesn't matter the attack it doesn't
[49:55] matter what you feel about yourself you
[49:58] are a son and daughter of God and you
[50:00] will make it amen
[50:03] so Esther comes and and and it becomes a
[50:06] a proving time it becomes a time where
[50:09] the the the the battle's been wrought
[50:12] it's been laid out before Esther and
[50:16] to make matters worse in Esther chapter
[50:18] five
[50:21] to make matters worse
[50:23] the scripture said that it had been 30
[50:25] days since the king had called on Esther
[50:29] 30 days so you can imagine how she felt
[50:32] in the Kingdom 30 days since the king
[50:35] had called on her 30 days since she felt
[50:38] the presence of God
[50:40] 30 days since she since she had a real
[50:44] heart-to-heart communion with God where
[50:46] she knew that her prayer went past the
[50:48] ceiling
[50:50] and she's she comes to this time and
[50:55] and there's there's certain death
[50:58] for for the people of God there's
[51:00] certain death for her people and and the
[51:03] weight of it is resting on Esther
[51:06] the salvation of this world it's it's
[51:09] it's resting on on the bride it's
[51:12] there's there they have no if you were
[51:15] lifted off the Earth it would be
[51:17] complete judgment right now
[51:21] so you are you are holding back the
[51:24] judgments and the wrath of God on this
[51:27] generation on this Earth
[51:29] and so Esther has to she's got to go
[51:32] before the king feeling this way
[51:34] wondering what what have I done he's
[51:36] lost interest in me I I don't I don't
[51:39] have power I don't I am the weakest
[51:42] Christian right now but she forgot what
[51:44] the prophet said that when the weakest
[51:46] Christian gets on their knees that all
[51:48] of Hell trembles amen
[51:51] so Esther has to has to fight within
[51:55] herself
[51:56] and and and to go before the king she
[52:00] knew that there were laws in place
[52:03] that this this God this King was so holy
[52:08] she couldn't approach him
[52:10] if she approached him then she'd be put
[52:13] to death
[52:15] even being Queen there were laws and and
[52:19] it's it's amazing to me again like I
[52:21] said just the story of Esther just lays
[52:23] out the the the the the story of God
[52:26] because the medes and Persians they
[52:29] relied so much on their laws that when
[52:32] they when they wrote a law and that got
[52:34] stamped and acted in the place it could
[52:36] not be changed that that lock it can't
[52:40] be canceled it can't be changed they had
[52:42] to write another law in place in order
[52:45] for for I don't want to say I know that
[52:49] law but but
[52:51] just like an Esther the king they have
[52:54] to write another law to save the people
[52:57] because Haman comes he presents this his
[53:01] case before the king the king says do it
[53:04] you got the authority all the authority
[53:07] you do it put it in place
[53:09] Haman had it he had it in the bag so we
[53:11] thought
[53:12] and so well let's just continue on
[53:15] so there's this law in place and and
[53:18] God's law
[53:20] um just finishing my thought there God's
[53:22] law was was God was so holy
[53:25] that he told Moses he said Moses I'm
[53:27] going to come down and visit the
[53:29] children of Israel I'm going to come on
[53:31] this mountain but he said do not let
[53:34] nobody no animal no human being touch
[53:38] that mountain because I am too holy they
[53:41] cannot approach me unless I bid come and
[53:45] so it's it's just a perfect type here in
[53:47] Esther because when God comes down he
[53:49] descends on with Fire on the Mountain
[53:51] the mountain starts shaking and then he
[53:53] says now Moses come
[53:56] and so Moses could approach but it was
[53:58] only after God said you can come but I'm
[54:01] so thankful tonight that Christ Made A
[54:04] Way
[54:05] Christ made a way that through his
[54:07] Holiness through his death on the cross
[54:10] he rent the the the the veil was written
[54:13] too so now it wasn't just one man that
[54:16] could be bid come into the presence of
[54:18] God it was whosoever will let them come
[54:22] whosoever will let them come now he says
[54:26] come boldly to the throne of grace
[54:31] yeah how does brother see him do it
[54:35] come boldly to the throne of grace
[54:39] uh make sure I don't lose track of time
[54:41] here
[54:44] so whatever Esther thought about herself
[54:48] had to be laid down in that moment she
[54:51] had to hold on
[54:53] to a threat of Grace because you'll find
[54:56] that as she's talking to Mordecai she
[54:58] says you you know the the king everybody
[55:01] knows in this Kingdom that whoever
[55:03] approaches the king they'll be put to
[55:05] death but then she says but but there's
[55:08] one hope of Grace
[55:09] and that's a it's if the king holds a
[55:12] scepter out too
[55:15] so she was she was
[55:19] regardless of how she felt about herself
[55:21] regardless how you feel about yourself
[55:23] you have a threat of Grace that you have
[55:26] to hold on to tonight
[55:28] you have a threat of Grace that when you
[55:30] make a mistake you can reach out and say
[55:33] but your blood is still there
[55:35] your blood is still there you still said
[55:37] come boldly to the throne of grace you
[55:40] still said whosoever you said Lord that
[55:43] blessed are they who hunger and thirst
[55:45] after righteousness because if they
[55:47] hunger and thirst there's just a hunger
[55:49] there they shall be filled
[55:52] so that's our threat of Grace tonight
[55:56] history lays out this beautiful and let
[56:00] me just let me just get this part
[56:02] because I while we're here there's this
[56:04] thread of Grace the scepter
[56:06] and I just I thought this was beautiful
[56:08] I looked up that word scepter and it
[56:10] started taking me down and I found in
[56:12] Genesis 49 10 it says the scepter shall
[56:16] not depart from Judah
[56:18] nor a law Giver from between his feet
[56:21] until Shiloh which is Christ come and
[56:25] unto him shall the Gathering of the
[56:26] people be numbers 24 17 there shall come
[56:30] a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall
[56:33] rise out of Israel so look at look at
[56:36] how beautiful and how perfect this is
[56:38] Psalms 45 verse 6 thy Throne o God is
[56:41] forever and ever the scepter of thy
[56:43] kingdom is a right scepter
[56:46] Hebrews 1 8 but under the sun he saith
[56:49] thy Throne o God is forever and ever a
[56:53] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[56:56] of thy kingdom
[56:57] amen it's so good I just I I just fell
[57:01] in love with that I just fell in love
[57:04] with that there's a scepter tonight for
[57:06] you you can come to God anytime whatever
[57:10] you have need of whatever you're going
[57:12] through in your life right now
[57:14] Financial it doesn't matter something
[57:17] one of those Cycles you Lord I just want
[57:20] more of you it doesn't matter you have
[57:22] free access there's a scepter that's
[57:24] been placed
[57:26] out of Jacob that's a forever scepter
[57:29] amen
[57:30] now we'll find that we're in chapter
[57:33] five here let's just pick it up real
[57:36] quick are are you doing okay
[57:39] now it came to pass on the third day
[57:41] that Esther put on her royal apparel and
[57:43] stood in the inner Court of the King's
[57:45] house over against the King's house and
[57:48] the King sat upon his Royal throne in
[57:50] the Royal house over against the Gate of
[57:52] the house I tried my hardest to find
[57:55] what this would look like and why this
[57:56] was so important and I couldn't
[57:59] but it's just it's just so detailed of
[58:02] of the way it is and and they they there
[58:04] was historic accounts that say the way
[58:07] that it sat in the way the King was that
[58:10] he the where Esther was that this
[58:12] described as the king she had to be in
[58:14] the king's view when she when she came
[58:16] out and it was so when the king saw
[58:19] Esther the queen standing in the court
[58:21] that she obtained favor in his sight now
[58:24] I just want to stop there just a moment
[58:27] because when you read when you read
[58:29] history there's there's accounts of this
[58:32] particular moment
[58:33] and it's not they say that Esther it
[58:36] wasn't just her coming up and walking
[58:39] approaching the throne
[58:41] she erased herself she she dresses
[58:44] herself not in her righteousness this
[58:47] was the apparel that came from the King
[58:48] Esther didn't own these clothes
[58:51] these were Esther's clothes these were
[58:53] the king's garments this was the king's
[58:55] righteousness his glory and Esther had
[58:57] to put it on she had to put on the
[58:59] Garment of Praise put on the Garment of
[59:02] Praise for your heaviness whatever
[59:03] you're going through tonight put on the
[59:05] Garment of Praise and come before the
[59:07] king amen because I'll show you I'm
[59:09] going to tell you right now when you do
[59:11] that watch God's response so history
[59:14] says that Esther she dresses herself and
[59:16] she comes and she's standing over there
[59:18] and and she she comes into view closer
[59:23] than what she should have remember she
[59:25] could be put to death now in this moment
[59:27] she could be put to death and I don't
[59:29] know if I don't know if the King was
[59:31] casting out judgment over something I
[59:34] don't know if there was there was but it
[59:36] says he he was just he had a stern look
[59:39] on his face
[59:40] he was sternly maybe maybe Haman was
[59:44] complaining about the queen
[59:47] maybe Haman was accusing the people
[59:50] again
[59:51] maybe he was he was accusing but when
[59:55] the king catches Esther catches his eye
[59:58] and the King looks and he's got a stern
[1:00:00] look on his face business here he looks
[1:00:03] over and it says Esther saw the sterness
[1:00:06] and she got so afraid that she fainted
[1:00:09] and so it wasn't Hallelujah it wasn't
[1:00:12] just the King sitting on his throne
[1:00:16] there
[1:00:20] sitting at did I lose it no okay
[1:00:24] just sitting at his throne and holding
[1:00:26] out a scepter he looks over he's sternly
[1:00:28] he looks over and there's Esther she
[1:00:30] sees a stern look on his face she faints
[1:00:33] it actually says the king left up from
[1:00:35] his throne and he ran to Esther
[1:00:38] the king oh come on now somebody
[1:00:43] he didn't just sit there when he saw
[1:00:45] Esther faint he jumped he leaped from
[1:00:47] his throne and he ran to her and he
[1:00:50] takes her in his arms so you imagine
[1:00:52] this this beautiful picture now
[1:00:54] she could be put to death
[1:00:56] but the King rushes to her and Scoops
[1:00:59] her in his arms and it says he starts
[1:01:01] talking he's Whispering sweetly to her
[1:01:04] so just Whispering love Esther my queen
[1:01:07] my queen do you got that and and let's
[1:01:11] see five two Esther the golden scepter
[1:01:13] go to the next verse there
[1:01:17] yeah and he's whispering to her and he's
[1:01:20] Esther my queen it's been so long why
[1:01:23] why have you fainted Esther my love why
[1:01:25] have you fainted then said the king unto
[1:01:27] her What wilt thou
[1:01:29] now I just this was something that the
[1:01:31] Lord showed me even while I was
[1:01:33] preaching this back home what will thou
[1:01:35] the king doesn't just say Esther
[1:01:37] What wilt thou Esther no he establishes
[1:01:41] her position still
[1:01:42] what What wilt thou Queen Esther
[1:01:47] what Queen Esther why why have you
[1:01:50] fainted what have you come you know you
[1:01:52] know the law obviously what did you what
[1:01:55] is so important what what is thy request
[1:02:00] it shall be given thee look at he just
[1:02:03] it's just non-stop what is it what are
[1:02:05] you coming to God for what do you have
[1:02:08] need of What wilt thou o Queen what will
[1:02:12] thou o bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:15] I'll give you half of my kingdom
[1:02:20] and and you know with with what we know
[1:02:23] this day what we're blessed with in in
[1:02:25] the message of the hour we know that God
[1:02:28] isn't saying I'll give you half my
[1:02:30] kingdom God says I've given you my
[1:02:33] kingdom
[1:02:34] the Kingdom of Heaven is within you What
[1:02:36] wilt thou Queen
[1:02:39] amen I just I just fell deeper in love
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:48] so let's just
[1:02:54] you know
[1:02:55] really what happened was Haman had put
[1:02:59] Esther in a tight spot
[1:03:03] Haman had become a powerful adversary
[1:03:06] and and Esther felt that in every way
[1:03:09] she knew Haman Haman had hath done this
[1:03:12] thing she tells the king we'll get to it
[1:03:14] in a minute but she says amen hath done
[1:03:17] this he knew right well what he was
[1:03:19] doing he'd become a powerful adversary
[1:03:22] she she felt she couldn't go to the king
[1:03:24] because Haman Haman put death between
[1:03:28] her and the King
[1:03:29] Haman put that there but Esther had to
[1:03:33] be reminded she was Queen no one no one
[1:03:37] in this proved it right here nobody was
[1:03:40] between the king and Esther
[1:03:43] she had Direct access
[1:03:46] and the devil he tries to get between us
[1:03:49] and our King sometimes
[1:03:50] through emotional discouragements
[1:03:53] through disappointments through
[1:03:55] complexes
[1:03:56] through the busyness of life
[1:03:59] through sin
[1:04:00] he himself presented to us
[1:04:04] Satan presents the sin to you and then
[1:04:07] when you fall he says hey
[1:04:12] but What wilt thou Queen Esther and what
[1:04:15] is thy request
[1:04:16] oh my
[1:04:20] his biggest block is the LIE he places
[1:04:23] between you it's not it's not what you
[1:04:26] think it's not your complex it's not
[1:04:28] your sin
[1:04:30] it's it's it's it's not those things
[1:04:32] that that separate us it's it's the lie
[1:04:35] that Satan puts in your mind
[1:04:38] we can go through such dry times this is
[1:04:41] this is what I got out of this because
[1:04:43] Esther you know just feeling 30 days she
[1:04:46] says it's been 30 days
[1:04:48] we can go through such dry times in our
[1:04:51] spiritual journey
[1:04:52] we we don't feel his presence we don't
[1:04:55] feel his inspiration we don't we don't
[1:04:58] and and you could just keep going we
[1:05:01] don't feel we don't feel we don't feel
[1:05:02] it doesn't matter what you feel
[1:05:05] it doesn't matter what you feel it's
[1:05:07] what the word says about you
[1:05:10] the King was available the King was
[1:05:13] available the entire time am I okay or
[1:05:16] did I do okay
[1:05:19] I'll let you work it out I'll keep
[1:05:21] preaching
[1:05:23] the King was available the entire time
[1:05:25] our King knows our voice
[1:05:29] there's that song He Knows Your Voice
[1:05:31] lift your hands it's time to Rejoice
[1:05:33] your cry has awoken the master he knows
[1:05:37] our voice he hears our prayers the
[1:05:40] moment we speak them you know in David
[1:05:42] or in in Daniel he says Daniel I heard
[1:05:45] you the first day you prayed
[1:05:47] I heard you the first time you uttered
[1:05:50] your voice but and you can you can find
[1:05:53] in Daniel the description on the
[1:05:55] spiritual side the there's a Prince of
[1:05:57] Persia and it says the angel says I had
[1:06:00] to fight against the Prince of Persia to
[1:06:02] get to you I heard you the first day but
[1:06:04] there's a spirit on your nation that I
[1:06:06] had to fight through in order to get to
[1:06:08] you Daniel there's a spirit in this
[1:06:11] nation brother Branham said every every
[1:06:13] nation has a spirit I imagine that we're
[1:06:16] just a whole heap of spirits in America
[1:06:17] and and you imagine so when you pray and
[1:06:20] you feel like your prayer isn't being
[1:06:22] answered you imagine what what the
[1:06:24] angels are going through you you've been
[1:06:27] heard but they have to fight through the
[1:06:29] spiritual warfare in order to get to you
[1:06:32] but they're on their way your your
[1:06:34] prayer the answer to your prayer is on
[1:06:37] its way
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:42] he sees you all the time
[1:06:46] Esther was chosen to be his Queen in 30
[1:06:49] days didn't change that
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:55] Haman
[1:06:56] Haman this this this brings us to
[1:06:58] another another Point Haman had the law
[1:07:02] but Esther had the king's heart
[1:07:06] Satan can remind you of the law but you
[1:07:09] have God's heart tonight
[1:07:12] Romans says nothing shall separate us
[1:07:15] from the love of God there is no great
[1:07:17] span that can ever stay between you and
[1:07:19] Christ Jesus died on the cross to to
[1:07:22] breach that span or he died in vain
[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] Esther then becomes God's grace to his
[1:07:32] people
[1:07:33] she she you know the story of Esther so
[1:07:36] so uh
[1:07:38] let me let me just see what direction to
[1:07:40] go here
[1:07:43] Esther Esther became a voice crying out
[1:07:46] standing in the gap
[1:07:50] the heart of the Bride size and cries
[1:07:52] for the Abominations done in the city
[1:07:55] over in Revelations one of the final
[1:07:57] scriptures in the book of in the whole
[1:07:59] Bible but in the Book of Revelation says
[1:08:01] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:08:05] so you understand that that today God
[1:08:09] God God can speak in an honorable voice
[1:08:11] but that's not his program he's not here
[1:08:13] in the flesh he's here in your flesh
[1:08:16] he's here in the bride so he's saying
[1:08:18] come through the bride
[1:08:21] and and let me just drop this in now I
[1:08:24] haven't preached this at home so you're
[1:08:25] getting a little nugget that I haven't
[1:08:26] spoke yet there but
[1:08:28] over in chapter 8 it says she comes
[1:08:31] again Queen Esther she comes again to
[1:08:33] the king
[1:08:34] and now this is where my notes have
[1:08:35] gotten messy okay so we're all over the
[1:08:38] place
[1:08:38] she comes again before the king and she
[1:08:41] she falls down and she's in tears you
[1:08:43] know so so just real quick haman's hung
[1:08:47] we'll get to it in a minute and and so
[1:08:50] haman's haman's no longer in the picture
[1:08:53] there's there's an absolute the queen is
[1:08:56] just she is set up at the king with the
[1:09:00] king I mean she has direct access it's
[1:09:02] been established she comes again the
[1:09:05] king that that scepter is there he's
[1:09:07] holding it out every time Esther comes
[1:09:08] every time she gets the scepter
[1:09:11] and so she comes and she says but oh
[1:09:13] King you know this this is still going
[1:09:16] on and the King says wait a minute Queen
[1:09:18] Esther he says I've given you the house
[1:09:21] of Haman
[1:09:22] I've I've given you everything you have
[1:09:25] you have everything you need to write
[1:09:28] whatever you whatever you say shall be
[1:09:31] done
[1:09:32] whatever you ask for when you pray it
[1:09:35] shall be given to you whatever you ask
[1:09:37] in my name this has been established he
[1:09:40] says you say it
[1:09:42] Queen Esther you speak it now I've given
[1:09:46] you I've set this up perfectly now you
[1:09:48] do it whatever you say that is law that
[1:09:52] is Grace amen
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:59] so
[1:10:00] goodness gracious I got I got
[1:10:04] two points I want to make here
[1:10:08] how long does Brother Sam usually preach
[1:10:10] on a Thursday night
[1:10:12] even if I'm one minute sooner then we're
[1:10:14] good a long time
[1:10:17] well cut can you cut that out of the
[1:10:22] huh
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:26] uh Esther
[1:10:30] oh my okay
[1:10:33] let me let me just I'm gonna I wanna
[1:10:35] this quote was just so amazing
[1:10:38] the super sign and and brother Branham
[1:10:41] speaking of Moses and he says Moses he
[1:10:44] stayed just exactly with God's word
[1:10:46] because he sought God first and he knew
[1:10:48] his position Moses knew his position he
[1:10:52] knowed he was born for that age to
[1:10:55] manifest the word of God at that time
[1:10:59] to manifest the word of God at that time
[1:11:03] Esther we find in in a lot of history
[1:11:06] believes I think it's in the book I
[1:11:09] think it's Nehemiah
[1:11:11] you'll find Nehemiah or Ezra I can't
[1:11:14] remember offhand now I think it's
[1:11:16] Nehemiah there's a scripture there in
[1:11:18] there and it says it says the king but
[1:11:20] it just happens to throw in the queen
[1:11:24] in the scripture the king but then
[1:11:26] there's this queen with him and that
[1:11:28] Queen is believed to be Esther and they
[1:11:31] said they believed that that that is
[1:11:34] Esther Nehemiah comes and and there's a
[1:11:37] oh my there's a fulfilling there's a
[1:11:40] it's coming to the fullness of the word
[1:11:43] it's coming to the fullness the
[1:11:45] completion of time it's coming to the
[1:11:47] completion of the temple the only thing
[1:11:49] left is the walls have been undone
[1:11:51] they're not built yet so Nehemiah comes
[1:11:55] and he says King I I just I I think he's
[1:11:57] the cup bear maybe I just off the top of
[1:12:00] my head it's been a little while since I
[1:12:01] read it and he and the King notices
[1:12:03] Nehemiah why is your account why are you
[1:12:05] sad and he says oh King it's just the
[1:12:08] the walls of Jerusalem are still undone
[1:12:10] the king says whatever you need you got
[1:12:13] it go get it done
[1:12:15] and they believe in history that that
[1:12:18] was Queen Esther sitting there and she
[1:12:20] was probably influential in giving
[1:12:23] Nehemiah everything he needed through
[1:12:26] the king what he needed to complete the
[1:12:28] word of God
[1:12:29] remember over in Hebrews they without us
[1:12:32] are not completed you have the word of
[1:12:35] God within you you have everything you
[1:12:37] need everything we need friends here on
[1:12:40] this earth right now that we need to
[1:12:43] make it from today into the Rapture is
[1:12:46] here the fullness of the word has been
[1:12:48] opened and it's not just laying there in
[1:12:51] a book for us to read the the kingdom of
[1:12:54] God is within you the word of God the
[1:12:57] word of eternal life it's within you we
[1:13:00] have the answer to the devil's question
[1:13:02] we know we we might not feel like it but
[1:13:05] the prophet said it so that's what I'm
[1:13:07] taking we know what to do with the word
[1:13:10] the bride the queen she knows what to do
[1:13:13] you were born for this age to manifest
[1:13:16] the word of God at this time you were
[1:13:18] born
[1:13:19] you you weren't an accident you were
[1:13:22] predestinated for today
[1:13:25] not not not not not
[1:13:28] something external from yourself you are
[1:13:31] the word of God for this generation
[1:13:35] the spirit of God is that's why the
[1:13:38] spirit of God is so important the spirit
[1:13:40] of God in you
[1:13:42] so we can go to God like Esther did
[1:13:46] we can go to God when we when we in in
[1:13:49] prayer when you feel unworthy when you
[1:13:51] when you feel filthy
[1:13:54] you don't even have to do anything wrong
[1:13:57] you you can read a news article in it
[1:14:00] and just feel completely filthy
[1:14:04] and that's it's not you it's the
[1:14:06] atmosphere that we're in it's it's
[1:14:08] Satan's Eden but it makes you feel dirty
[1:14:11] you you you you you might have made a
[1:14:13] bad decision and you feel you can't go
[1:14:15] to God but you were born to go through
[1:14:18] this age through everything that Satan
[1:14:20] has in his Eden through through the the
[1:14:24] greatest generation of of
[1:14:27] pornography of of sexual sin of whatever
[1:14:31] you can but your desires whatever you
[1:14:34] want it's at your fingertips it's you
[1:14:36] you have you can divulge in anything you
[1:14:39] can be distracted that's the word I'm
[1:14:42] looking for you can become distracted so
[1:14:44] easily but you've been called for this
[1:14:47] generation through this time to go
[1:14:49] through that and to stand next to God
[1:14:51] one day amen and him say this is my
[1:14:54] bride
[1:14:57] Esther's purpose went far beyond just
[1:15:00] saving her people from Annihilation at
[1:15:02] that time
[1:15:05] it was to complete the work of God
[1:15:09] for her day
[1:15:13] you you Esther are the culmination the
[1:15:16] summing up of the ages you are what God
[1:15:19] was trying to say through Jesus Christ
[1:15:22] the work of God is not completed without
[1:15:25] you you are the final and full
[1:15:27] manifestation of God's word you question
[1:15:30] that a little bit you're not saying amen
[1:15:31] go go read or listen to Christ the
[1:15:34] mystery of God revealed he's talking and
[1:15:36] he says you know what God was trying to
[1:15:38] do through the scripture was Jesus Jesus
[1:15:40] was the Revelation but then he turns
[1:15:42] around same paragraph and says but
[1:15:45] you're the revelation of it all
[1:15:47] you are the Revelation you are the
[1:15:50] revelation of God's word
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:55] oh my
[1:15:59] God I'd have to count how many services
[1:16:00] that this is all taken up here so uh let
[1:16:03] me read you a couple of things you're
[1:16:05] still with me we're doing okay on time
[1:16:07] now the only thing the little tree you
[1:16:09] stick it in the ground plant it and it
[1:16:11] has to grow it has to draw moisture from
[1:16:13] the ground and it has to draw more than
[1:16:15] what its allotted portion is you have to
[1:16:17] give it plenty of water and when you
[1:16:19] give it water it just drinks and drinks
[1:16:21] and drinks till it can't hardly drink no
[1:16:23] more and it just starts pushing out it
[1:16:25] pushes out limbs pushes out leaves
[1:16:27] pushes out blossoms pushes out apples
[1:16:30] the apples was on the inside of it at
[1:16:33] the beginning and it just has to drink
[1:16:34] now I know you've heard that probably a
[1:16:37] thousand times
[1:16:38] but I I don't want you to let it just go
[1:16:41] and say yeah that's cliche he's just
[1:16:43] saying what we've always heard
[1:16:44] you you have what's in you get my point
[1:16:47] you Esther had what was in her
[1:16:49] everything she needed to go before the
[1:16:51] king you have what you need to go before
[1:16:54] the king you have what you need to make
[1:16:56] it through
[1:16:58] and every man that's born again in Jesus
[1:17:00] in Christ Jesus everything you you have
[1:17:03] need of your healing Satan will afflict
[1:17:07] you sure he will but everything you have
[1:17:09] need of in the whole life's journey is
[1:17:12] right is in you right then and you are
[1:17:15] planted in Christ Jesus you see what I
[1:17:17] mean when you are born again in the
[1:17:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into
[1:17:21] your heart you have everything that you
[1:17:23] have need of for the journey now I don't
[1:17:26] I don't believe he's saying you have you
[1:17:28] you have the full stature of the perfect
[1:17:30] man right then you have every you have
[1:17:32] it in you but you notice when the trees
[1:17:35] planted it still has to grow
[1:17:38] so you can't get lacks just because you
[1:17:40] have the Holy Ghost he's saying you have
[1:17:42] to drink and drink and drink and drink
[1:17:44] and drink
[1:17:45] and you have to drink the right things
[1:17:47] you have to feed the right things you
[1:17:48] have to get the right fertilizer for the
[1:17:50] tree you gotta you gotta come to church
[1:17:52] and let yourself be pruned by the word
[1:17:54] of God because no matter how long the
[1:17:57] preacher takes on Thursday nights
[1:18:00] now the only thing you have to do is
[1:18:03] start drinking drinking pushing out
[1:18:04] drinking and pushing out I believe he
[1:18:07] hears my analysis of Christ Jesus he's
[1:18:09] the inexhaustible Fountain of Life and
[1:18:11] every man that's planted in him can
[1:18:13] drink and drink and push out and push
[1:18:15] out to every Redemptive blessing that
[1:18:18] God has promised belongs to you and it's
[1:18:20] your personal property you don't just
[1:18:22] get half the kingdom you get every
[1:18:24] Redemptive right
[1:18:26] and the devil hasn't got any tied to it
[1:18:29] at all Hallelujah if he hasn't got any
[1:18:32] tied to it he can't tell you whether you
[1:18:34] do or not
[1:18:35] he hasn't got any legal rights his
[1:18:38] rights has been spoiled at Calvary now
[1:18:40] this I just read this real quick I tell
[1:18:42] you what's the matter with Christians
[1:18:44] tonight you're not drawing dividends on
[1:18:46] your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:49] drawn and drink and drink and drink and
[1:18:51] drink till you push out salvation push
[1:18:54] out Divine Healing push out the baptism
[1:18:56] of the Holy Ghost just drink and drink
[1:18:58] and you're planted by the inexhaustible
[1:19:00] Fountain of Life he that's thirsty let
[1:19:03] him drink him that heareth say come
[1:19:04] whosoever will come and drink from The
[1:19:06] Fountains of the Water of Life freely
[1:19:08] amen
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:13] Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a
[1:19:16] time as this I just got one more point I
[1:19:17] want to make Stay With Me
[1:19:20] today when Satan is Raging his anger at
[1:19:22] all-time high
[1:19:24] you can have what you need right inside
[1:19:26] of you when you receive the spirit of
[1:19:28] Christ into your life you become a new
[1:19:30] creature in Christ the word just isn't
[1:19:33] something we read so we said this
[1:19:36] my
[1:19:37] just looking up a couple things brother
[1:19:40] Branham said deity is within you
[1:19:42] resurrection power is within you the
[1:19:44] kingdom of God is within you the power
[1:19:46] of angels backing you lies within you if
[1:19:49] you've if you've been given a diagnosis
[1:19:51] of death how can you die with the spirit
[1:19:54] of life in you
[1:19:56] healing power is within you
[1:19:59] amen the God within you will believe his
[1:20:02] own word don't fear falling from it just
[1:20:05] let his faith flow through you
[1:20:07] if that genuine Holy Ghost brother
[1:20:09] Branham says is in you which is the word
[1:20:11] manifested you'll see the message of the
[1:20:13] hour because it's the holy ghost that
[1:20:15] does it amen
[1:20:18] he's wooing you all the time
[1:20:20] goodness
[1:20:23] so just just real brief as we come to a
[1:20:26] close
[1:20:27] Esther chapter 7.
[1:20:30] Esther as you know she she calls for a
[1:20:33] feast she calls for another feast and
[1:20:36] then I think it's three feasts and and I
[1:20:39] just kind of to me it was interesting
[1:20:41] because it was the Feast of wine
[1:20:44] and we know that wine is stimulation of
[1:20:47] Revelation
[1:20:48] and even the king at the beginning he
[1:20:50] says give them as much wine as they want
[1:20:54] according to the king's portion well the
[1:20:56] King was uh drunk
[1:21:00] so when he just kept going so he said
[1:21:02] give out give out as much as they can
[1:21:04] take in you have access to Revelation as
[1:21:08] much as you want
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:12] so it gets down and and it finally comes
[1:21:15] to our to to the culmination of these
[1:21:18] feasts and the King he just keeps asking
[1:21:20] her Esther what what is your what do you
[1:21:23] want Esther
[1:21:26] please tell me
[1:21:27] I don't know if he was getting tired or
[1:21:29] not you know just just say it Esther I'm
[1:21:32] giving you half my kingdom I'm I'm you
[1:21:34] know what I bet it is I bet it's like
[1:21:36] God just speak it
[1:21:38] just speak it just tell me I you know
[1:21:41] why why did he pray for them to go to
[1:21:44] send out laborers because he just needed
[1:21:46] somebody to speak it God just just speak
[1:21:49] it please honey just tell me
[1:21:52] all right
[1:21:53] you know
[1:21:55] husbands they'll they'll you know the
[1:21:57] wives of well what's wrong honey nothing
[1:22:00] haha
[1:22:02] come on now please tell me no I'm good
[1:22:05] honey tell me what's the matter
[1:22:08] yeah I imagine it's God sometimes just
[1:22:10] just ask me all I need you to do is ask
[1:22:14] why Lord why don't I have this you just
[1:22:16] ask for it just ask for it amen
[1:22:20] and the king and so
[1:22:27] Esther she she gives her if I found
[1:22:30] favor in your side oh King I'm gonna I
[1:22:32] think this is in the Amplified and if it
[1:22:34] pleased the king let me let life my life
[1:22:37] be granted me for my wish and my people
[1:22:39] from my request for we have been sold
[1:22:41] and I am my people to be destroyed to be
[1:22:44] killed and to be annihilated if we had
[1:22:46] been sold merely as slaves as men and
[1:22:48] women I would I would have been silent
[1:22:50] for our Affliction is not to be compared
[1:22:53] with the loss to The King The King Azara
[1:22:56] said to The Queen Esther
[1:22:58] who is he
[1:23:00] who is he
[1:23:03] and where is he
[1:23:07] said God I'm just I'm so bothered right
[1:23:09] now God says who is he
[1:23:12] where is he
[1:23:15] where is he
[1:23:17] who has dared to do this or I can just
[1:23:21] hear God saying it who asked dared to do
[1:23:24] this thing to my Queen and Esther said a
[1:23:27] foe and an enemy this wicked Haman then
[1:23:30] Haman was terrified before the king
[1:23:33] and the Queen
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:37] and the King arose listen Haman knew in
[1:23:41] that moment that his life was in the
[1:23:43] Queen's hand it wasn't even in the
[1:23:46] king's hand it was the Queen's hand
[1:23:49] and the King arose in his wrath from the
[1:23:51] wine drinking and went into the palace
[1:23:54] Garden he just gets so angry he just
[1:23:56] leaves he just leaves and and
[1:24:01] Haman but Heyman stayed to beg for his
[1:24:03] life from Queen Esther for he saw that
[1:24:06] harm was determined against him by the
[1:24:08] king and the King returned from the
[1:24:10] palace Garden to the to the place where
[1:24:13] they were drinking wine as Haman was
[1:24:16] falling on the couch where Esther was oh
[1:24:19] my
[1:24:22] and the King said will he even assault
[1:24:26] the queen in my presence in my own house
[1:24:31] oh you can imagine tonight what what God
[1:24:35] is just gets Furious there there's it's
[1:24:38] it's just boiling up friends
[1:24:40] there's gonna come a day when When God
[1:24:43] says enough
[1:24:45] you dare do this to my queen
[1:24:48] in my presence
[1:24:51] [Applause]
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:56] as the word left the mouth of the king
[1:25:00] they covered haman's face so they hanged
[1:25:03] Haman on The Gallows that was prepared
[1:25:05] for Mordecai the very trap he set for
[1:25:09] God's people turned around and Satan was
[1:25:12] issued the same decree Satan will be
[1:25:15] cast into the Lake of Fire God will get
[1:25:18] so angry he says enough is enough
[1:25:21] and then Haman your Haman the Haman
[1:25:26] Satan who has accused you day and night
[1:25:28] who is torment in your mind who is
[1:25:31] tormented your body who's tormented your
[1:25:33] children who who has taken our our loved
[1:25:37] ones God says that's enough
[1:25:42] and then Satan gets what's coming to him
[1:25:44] and it wasn't until Satan got what was
[1:25:48] coming to him
[1:25:49] that the Wrath of the King was pacified
[1:25:53] now you can stand to your feet I just
[1:25:55] want to give you one more thing
[1:25:59] so you'll find an Esther that they
[1:26:02] create the celebration
[1:26:05] and it and it's it's actually pronounced
[1:26:08] from what I could best I could find in
[1:26:10] the pronunciation at Purim
[1:26:12] one of the biggest celebrations the Jews
[1:26:15] have is Purim to celebrate the saving of
[1:26:17] the Jews in Esther's time
[1:26:19] the importance of this story just keeps
[1:26:22] keeps on and keeps on
[1:26:25] Deuteronomy says that that God will blot
[1:26:29] out the remembrance of amalek you
[1:26:31] remember we said that from under heaven
[1:26:33] so
[1:26:34] the the story of Esther is read during
[1:26:38] this during the celebration
[1:26:41] and while the story is read while the
[1:26:43] while the priest is reading the people
[1:26:45] can't speak but he pauses at certain
[1:26:48] moments
[1:26:50] and so he's reading the story of Esther
[1:26:52] and whenever the word Haman is mentioned
[1:26:55] he stops and the Jews all start booing
[1:26:58] amen and and I and I think it's it's
[1:27:01] booing and they make loud noises after
[1:27:04] haman's name is red
[1:27:07] they actually used to in in times before
[1:27:11] they would write Haman on rocks and on
[1:27:14] boards and when haman's name was read
[1:27:16] they would pause and they would start
[1:27:18] clapping these rocks and these boards
[1:27:20] together they would just start beating
[1:27:22] whatever had haman's name on it I mean
[1:27:25] you can imagine
[1:27:27] you know they're just they're just
[1:27:28] beating they're just the priest says you
[1:27:31] know and Haman and then he pauses and
[1:27:33] they just start beating it boo Heyman
[1:27:36] boo Heyman
[1:27:39] and they do that until at the end of the
[1:27:42] story when the last time haman's name is
[1:27:45] read and the last clapping is done his
[1:27:48] his name is erased off of whatever they
[1:27:51] wrote it on
[1:27:53] [Applause]
[1:27:54] they stomped their feet
[1:27:57] amalek is compared to the heel the the
[1:28:00] least sensitive area of the body
[1:28:02] represents the lowest of the low and is
[1:28:05] compared to being cooled off for
[1:28:07] becoming lukewarm so stomping their feet
[1:28:10] is trampling and weakening the inner
[1:28:13] flesh the inner amalek of their flesh so
[1:28:16] they stomped their feet as a symbol that
[1:28:19] the flesh is going out and the spirit is
[1:28:22] taking life
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:25] so what I did at home I didn't bring
[1:28:27] Sharpies but if when you get home if you
[1:28:30] want to write what is bothering you on
[1:28:32] the bottom of your shoe
[1:28:36] write it because what happens to the
[1:28:38] bottom of your shoe is you walk on it it
[1:28:41] gets worn and eventually that's going to
[1:28:43] disappear
[1:28:44] amen
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:50] come on brother thou art come I leave
[1:28:53] you with ascendance Thou Art come to the
[1:28:55] kingdom thou have been born you've come
[1:28:58] into existence you're in laodicea at
