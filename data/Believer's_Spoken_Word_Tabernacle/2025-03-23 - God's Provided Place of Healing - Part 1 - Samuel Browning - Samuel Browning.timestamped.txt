[49:00] on Friday so Lord willing that will be
[49:05] hopefully coming in here this
[49:08] week and
[49:11] um I just also want to make mention to
[49:14] you
[49:15] um that I know sometimes that we we
[49:19] don't always and not everyone is here on
[49:21] Thursday nights but I'm going to I'm
[49:23] going to ask you if you're
[49:25] not um on Thursday nights and if you can
[49:28] be here be here but um we've been going
[49:32] through a little part I've taken a
[49:34] little side as side part as the Lord has
[49:38] just led us and just dealing with some
[49:40] things and I've just put it under the
[49:42] title of church order but these are
[49:44] things that I spoke um have been
[49:47] speaking on and there's still some some
[49:49] ahead of us to go on and to to work with
[49:53] and um it's um the Lord just really
[49:56] taking us in a nice just a real depth of
[49:59] some things that U I've just really been
[50:02] enjoying I've been enjoying studying
[50:03] them and looking at them and um just um
[50:08] I ask you this uh please make sure that
[50:10] you are aware of that and and those
[50:13] things and and listening to I know I
[50:15] know most of you do uh but uh you know
[50:18] sometimes I've got
[50:20] questions uh from uh from different ones
[50:22] about certain things and sometimes the
[50:24] questions are that are asked it I don't
[50:26] know if Thursdays are being listened to
[50:28] or not and so certain little things I
[50:30] can catch and so uh I don't mean to put
[50:33] you on the spot but I want to just say
[50:35] that we we need all of the word of God
[50:38] and uh it's just for us as an assembly
[50:40] what what I've been speaking on I'm not
[50:42] speaking for anybody else what I speak
[50:43] is for here for us as an assembly it's
[50:46] things that even the brothers and where
[50:48] we will base and always refer back to so
[50:51] um and certainly we want to just stay
[50:54] within the safety and the boundaries of
[50:56] the word of God God uh to me um I don't
[50:59] need any other message God has sent a
[51:01] message that will sweep us all the way
[51:03] home and I'm satisfied with that I'm
[51:07] satisfied with that uh you know I you
[51:09] continue to read over Sometimes some of
[51:11] the same quotes and I just was sharing
[51:13] with the young people there on Friday
[51:15] night I said you know there's times when
[51:16] I'll go back in when I go back into a
[51:18] study I just don't I just don't assume
[51:20] things I want to go right back through I
[51:22] just want to make another broad study
[51:23] and go back through quotes cuz there's
[51:26] things that I know that the Holy Spirit
[51:27] Will begin to Quicken out of there that
[51:29] I never saw before amen that's how the
[51:31] word of God is it just continues to come
[51:33] forth amen so good to see you I I know
[51:36] I've said that maybe a dozen times but
[51:38] we'll we'll keep on saying good to see
[51:39] everybody amen God bless you amen so
[51:43] Psalms
[51:47] 103 David said bless the Lord oh my soul
[51:52] and all that is within me bless His holy
[51:55] name bless the Lord all my soul and
[51:58] forget not all his benefits who
[52:02] forgiveth all thine iniquities who
[52:06] Health all thy diseases you know I I
[52:09] love how that's wrote yes sir yes sir
[52:12] you know God could have listed them we
[52:15] wouldn't we wouldn't have been able to
[52:16] carry it around can you imagine trying
[52:17] to read that for a text that's right I
[52:20] mean of all the all the diseases could
[52:22] you imagine trying to read of all the
[52:24] things of all the sin but you notice it
[52:27] all comes down he forgiveth all that's
[52:30] he Health all
[52:32] abely who redeemeth thy life from
[52:35] destruction who crowneth thee with
[52:38] loving kindness and Tender Mercies who
[52:41] satisfi thy mouth with good things so
[52:44] that thy youth is renewed like the
[52:47] Eagles and the Lord executeth
[52:50] righteousness and judgment for all that
[52:53] are oppressed amen may God bless you and
[52:56] bless that's the reading of the word as
[52:57] you're being seated got one more
[52:59] scripture I'm going to pull from
[53:01] here real quickly out of First Kings 18
[53:06] and verse
[53:10] 30 and Elijah said unto all the
[53:14] people come near unto me and all the
[53:18] people came near unto him and he
[53:22] repaired the altar of the Lord that was
[53:26] broken
[53:28] down
[53:30] now when we look at this word and
[53:32] perhaps I'll come back and pick this
[53:34] scripture up but this word repaired is
[53:38] the word
[53:39] Rafa that means to make healthful or to
[53:45] heal and so what was all broken
[53:51] apart when God gave a word to Elijah
[53:55] Elijah he came on the Mount Carmel and
[53:58] it was a Mount Carmel
[54:01] Showdown but he began to
[54:03] assemble those
[54:06] stones to restore and repair the altar
[54:09] of the Lord he did not he he took what
[54:13] was broken and he brought it together
[54:17] yeah that's good and
[54:19] God there's a lot of times when we can
[54:22] look at things and look in
[54:24] situations sometimes you know it can
[54:26] even be from the simplest of a of
[54:29] looking at maybe a project or whatever
[54:31] and you just you can become so
[54:33] overwhelmed it can look and sometimes
[54:36] there's situations and things that you
[54:39] don't even know where to
[54:41] begin where do you start there's things
[54:44] that sometimes seem to be
[54:48] irreparable and
[54:50] yet as far as with
[54:52] man and even with all of man's in
[54:56] genuity and
[54:57] intellect it would be impossible with
[55:01] man there's lives that can look to be
[55:07] irreparable sometimes it can even look
[55:09] to be that as though when you see a
[55:11] situation and you can look and it can
[55:14] seem like my it's just something that is
[55:17] going just the opposite way and maybe
[55:21] it's scornful maybe it's things that's
[55:24] uh belittling and things that's being
[55:27] said and coming out of this person's
[55:29] mouth and you you're saying God be
[55:31] merciful and you you could look at a
[55:34] situation and think my I I don't know
[55:37] you know in the human mind but yet when
[55:40] when God has moved down in the depths of
[55:42] your life you recognize by a
[55:45] supernatural experience in your own life
[55:48] that's right that there's nothing beyond
[55:51] God absolutely because it was not you
[55:56] or I that changed
[55:59] ourselves it really wasn't us that start
[56:02] that was seeking God it was God seeking
[56:05] after us that begin to pull on our
[56:07] heart because there's a part of us that
[56:12] always was a son and daughter of God
[56:16] that was that part that come from God
[56:17] and that was magnetized to him and so
[56:20] when he would begin to move Upon Our
[56:23] Lives and all of that takes place within
[56:25] its time and in its season but to see
[56:28] that's where everything that we would
[56:30] base our Our Hope from our expectation
[56:34] is because we know that what God has
[56:37] done in our own lives and to know that
[56:40] there's no uh situation or anything that
[56:44] is beyond the reach of almighty God and
[56:47] I'd like to just speak here this morning
[56:49] or at least to begin to with this
[56:52] thought on God's provided place of
[56:55] healing
[56:57] sometimes there's things that when we
[56:59] look at healing and healing can be
[57:02] seemingly such a a simple word and we
[57:05] can we' speak of it and we'll say you
[57:07] know pray for healing for one another
[57:09] and we know what that means and And yet
[57:12] when we would begin to if I were to ask
[57:15] you and say what does that mean what
[57:17] what what is healing well in real in
[57:20] real simple words it would be to get
[57:24] back to helpfulness or back to my normal
[57:28] self or back to where I'm not feeling
[57:31] bad or to where the you know I'm no
[57:33] longer plagued with this illness or this
[57:35] disease or or this mental I'm I'm no
[57:38] longer uh a plagued with this and I'm
[57:41] I'm able to move and to and to operate
[57:43] and to function as as as I should and we
[57:46] all know what that's like you know I
[57:48] think when um you know back here last
[57:51] July I kind of wonder if our family had
[57:54] what some of the rest of the church got
[57:56] later on here in the first of the year
[57:58] because when we were there in the month
[58:01] of July and what we had last year and
[58:04] you know man it just knocked us off our
[58:06] feet and it seemed like it just
[58:08] something that just lingered for weeks
[58:10] on end and you know you in your mind you
[58:13] start you have a memory in your mind of
[58:15] what it feels like to feel well you know
[58:19] you you get to a place and you you start
[58:21] feeling like you're making two steps
[58:23] forward then all of a sudden you find
[58:25] yourself the next day you feel weaker
[58:27] than you did the other day and then you
[58:30] get a little then you find the next day
[58:31] you wake up and you're like wow I I feel
[58:33] good and maybe this is the time I can go
[58:35] and kind of you know do a little bit and
[58:37] then all of a sudden you find yourself
[58:39] maybe a week again and you know cough
[58:42] and all those things and sometimes
[58:44] things can can linger for a period of
[58:47] time and you know with healing itself
[58:51] because let's just all be honest we can
[58:53] look at it and say that well you know
[58:55] healings a minor brother Samuel that's
[58:57] true it it is a minor but I'll tell you
[59:00] what when you get sick it becomes
[59:05] major so it is a minor but yet you know
[59:09] what it's it's major when it comes down
[59:12] to the needs in our
[59:13] body now I want to just begin here and
[59:17] I'll just we just want however the Lord
[59:19] will just take us and direct us through
[59:21] this within it but within healing in
[59:24] itself I'm going to telling you God not
[59:27] only send a word and sends his word to
[59:31] bring healing to that of our body but
[59:34] God has sent a word to bring a healing
[59:36] to our soul because that's what's the
[59:39] most important thing but with
[59:42] that God's care has provided all that we
[59:47] would have need of throughout this
[59:50] journey because there's going to be
[59:53] times in our life that the best best of
[59:56] intentions that we've had whether we've
[59:59] made mistakes or whether maybe we've
[1:00:02] offended or we've offended somebody else
[1:00:04] and on and on and on and on we could go
[1:00:07] that there's times where we're going to
[1:00:09] need healing in our
[1:00:12] spirit sir and there's not a doctor that
[1:00:15] can get there to your spirit
[1:00:18] realm now psychologist and psychiatrist
[1:00:22] and I'm not listen just let me just tell
[1:00:24] you I could read you a whole Litany of
[1:00:25] course quotes brother Brown just says it
[1:00:27] like this he said instead of us being
[1:00:30] against he said the man who preaches
[1:00:32] healing him being against you know the
[1:00:34] doctor and instead of the doctor being
[1:00:37] against the surgeon and instead of the
[1:00:38] surgeon being against the chiropractor
[1:00:40] and in he said everything that
[1:00:44] helps is of
[1:00:49] god you
[1:00:50] see God can work through many different
[1:00:53] Avenues but it's God God that's right
[1:00:58] are you hearing me it's God God's the
[1:01:00] one who brings the
[1:01:02] healing it never was medicine when we
[1:01:05] take medicine or you know maybe you
[1:01:07] drink Elderberry syrup or whatever it it
[1:01:10] it it it's God who is the Healer I I I
[1:01:14] you know I I believe in all those things
[1:01:16] but it's God that is the one who brings
[1:01:18] healing in our life there's times where
[1:01:21] in situations of Life seasons of life
[1:01:24] that we we go through changes of life
[1:01:27] that we come into that we experience
[1:01:30] different things you know uh things will
[1:01:32] change hormones will change all sorts of
[1:01:35] things will will change and in that time
[1:01:39] you know we need we need a healing touch
[1:01:42] from the Lord and you know within that
[1:01:44] God doesn't always come around and you
[1:01:46] know remove necessarily all the
[1:01:49] conditions but God will bring a healing
[1:01:52] to us to alleviate or lift fear from
[1:01:56] when we feel those things coming around
[1:01:58] us brother BR tells us in uniting time
[1:02:01] and sign when God uh spoke to his heart
[1:02:05] and you remember brother brandham had a
[1:02:06] condition in his stomach that brother
[1:02:08] Bram would tell us in this way it would
[1:02:11] come in a in a in a real harsh way every
[1:02:14] seven years and he would talk about he
[1:02:17] would also deal with the cycles of seven
[1:02:19] of how that every seven years we we we
[1:02:22] deal with something we're going through
[1:02:24] something and and he deals with how that
[1:02:26] you know every time that that that
[1:02:28] nervousness and that would come within
[1:02:30] you know and affect his stomach you know
[1:02:33] brother BR would talk about how fear
[1:02:35] would come around you know I just want
[1:02:37] to say it like this I've said this over
[1:02:39] and over you know that but I appreciate
[1:02:41] the transparency of the message of the
[1:02:44] hour brother brandham himself he never
[1:02:46] tried to be a superhero he just wanted
[1:02:48] to make sure that we knew who the real
[1:02:50] superhero is and that's the Lord Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ and that's why the we recognize
[1:02:55] there's no big ones or little ones Among
[1:02:57] Us and and we don't have to ignore
[1:02:59] things but we've got a faithful and
[1:03:00] merciful high priest that when we are
[1:03:03] experiencing things in our life we can
[1:03:05] go to him amen we can talk to him and he
[1:03:08] knows all about it and you know what
[1:03:10] even if we within ourselves sometimes we
[1:03:13] maybe don't even know what to say or how
[1:03:15] do I say it how do I word it or I don't
[1:03:17] even know where to even begin I'm glad
[1:03:19] that God can come right around within a
[1:03:22] meeting within a service maybe while
[1:03:24] you're listening to a tape and all of a
[1:03:26] sudden he'll identify something that is
[1:03:28] is there that is present uh in our lives
[1:03:32] that we would have need of the healing
[1:03:35] virtues of the son of the Living God and
[1:03:38] God will make that known and then all of
[1:03:39] a sudden then then it be then we we have
[1:03:42] a reality or knowing what I need to ask
[1:03:45] for and you know brother Bram when he
[1:03:47] was standing there he said you know God
[1:03:49] came to him uniting time and sign he
[1:03:51] tells it and he says you know he says
[1:03:54] here I was and he says and every time
[1:03:56] it's come it's it's you know it's been
[1:03:58] fearful and brother Bram deals with it
[1:04:00] and he says that how he said he came to
[1:04:03] me and he told me he said it'll never
[1:04:07] make you afraid any
[1:04:09] longer now brother Bram stopped and he
[1:04:11] said now he could have taken the whole
[1:04:14] thing but instead he came and he said
[1:04:19] you're not going to fear it any
[1:04:21] longer so now you see now now watch this
[1:04:24] brother brandham never received his
[1:04:27] healing in that stomach condition in
[1:04:31] this life that is so are you with me you
[1:04:34] know you can go on the wings of a snow
[1:04:35] white dove and I walked right in the
[1:04:38] pathway and you know of where that that
[1:04:40] that squirrel would have would have
[1:04:41] jumped out and there ain't no squirrels
[1:04:43] up there but all of that that that was
[1:04:45] there you know and how God put that
[1:04:47] there listen the same God that put a ram
[1:04:48] on the mountain is a same God to put a
[1:04:50] squirrel there and so within that part
[1:04:53] of how that you know that that very
[1:04:56] it went remember the seventh one it went
[1:04:57] to jump and and brother Brad himself as
[1:05:00] as he stepped stepped back it crushed
[1:05:02] itself on one of those Tula cactuses it
[1:05:05] almost looks like a you know them them
[1:05:07] nice tasty churros you know it that's
[1:05:09] almost that's what that that's what that
[1:05:11] kind of a cactus looks like and and it
[1:05:14] it it crushed itself it died right there
[1:05:17] and to think that you know the prophet
[1:05:19] came off of that mountain with an
[1:05:21] expectation in his heart it's over yeah
[1:05:25] it's finished that's right and little
[1:05:27] did Brother Bram know that as far as the
[1:05:29] suffering and the finishing it was only
[1:05:31] a few weeks down the road and the Lord
[1:05:34] was going to take him home let me just
[1:05:35] tell you something brother brandom is
[1:05:37] not complaining on the other
[1:05:41] side
[1:05:43] hallelujah what it shows you and I is
[1:05:46] not to be hopeless as though that oh
[1:05:49] I've got things I'm going to have to
[1:05:50] carry for the rest of my life that's not
[1:05:52] true that's not what was being said but
[1:05:55] what it is is there's certain things
[1:05:57] that though that we maybe can't go back
[1:05:59] and erase this or erase that but God can
[1:06:02] bring the healing that we have need of
[1:06:06] that's right to be able to Rise Up from
[1:06:09] where we're at and make steps
[1:06:13] forward and look with a real expectation
[1:06:18] in his word to know that God has this
[1:06:22] under control because sometimes before
[1:06:25] you can ever start sometimes in certain
[1:06:28] situations with things it's like you
[1:06:30] know when somebody has a um you know
[1:06:33] they they have a condition and maybe
[1:06:35] they have a stroke or whatever more you
[1:06:37] you cannot I know I'm speaking to you
[1:06:39] know the medical individuals here uh you
[1:06:43] can't you you know you can't even start
[1:06:44] thinking about signing them up for
[1:06:46] therapy right the first thing is is you
[1:06:49] got to get them stabilized right that's
[1:06:51] right am I right you got to get them
[1:06:53] stabilized and sometimes you've got to
[1:06:55] get all of those things make sure with
[1:06:58] where's the damage at so you got to do
[1:07:00] some testing on where are the are the
[1:07:02] neurons firing is there still seizures
[1:07:05] that's going on all of those things that
[1:07:07] you know and and where where do they
[1:07:08] have movement and all those things and
[1:07:10] checks so they're really monitoring them
[1:07:13] now eventually yes they're going to have
[1:07:16] to probably they're going to have to go
[1:07:17] through therapy and all this but that's
[1:07:20] not now where healing starts with is
[1:07:23] first diagnosing that's good the issue
[1:07:27] that is so good and we want to make sure
[1:07:29] that we're not putting you out there if
[1:07:31] things are not actually in place for you
[1:07:34] to be there at that moment and you see
[1:07:37] you know man in itself can miss so many
[1:07:40] things we can miss things friends listen
[1:07:43] let me just show you how clear this is
[1:07:45] the prophet would stand right here and
[1:07:47] he would and well not right here but you
[1:07:49] know behind the pull pit and he would
[1:07:51] preach taking his text out of Revelation
[1:07:53] 6 and he would preach the white horse
[1:07:56] rider and preach that underneath the
[1:07:58] messages of the mighty conqueror but
[1:08:01] once the Holy Spirit took the cover off
[1:08:05] who that is right there it did not
[1:08:08] matter how innocent it looked but what
[1:08:11] was beneath it was exposed then the
[1:08:14] prophet could say now I know why I've
[1:08:18] always been against
[1:08:21] organization because he's showing that
[1:08:24] organization is actually a suppressing
[1:08:27] it's a conquering it's wanting to take
[1:08:29] people from what you say well how is
[1:08:31] that conquering because it's wanting to
[1:08:33] separate or get between the people and
[1:08:36] God as though that they become the
[1:08:40] mediator between God and man there's one
[1:08:43] mediator between God and man and that's
[1:08:47] the man Christ
[1:08:49] Jesus that's it and that's why when God
[1:08:52] sent a message in this end time it was
[1:08:55] was to remove the veils it was to remove
[1:08:59] uh that of man's uh ideas and and
[1:09:03] thoughts and and to bring us face to
[1:09:05] face with a living God that we can have
[1:09:09] not only a real true experience but a
[1:09:11] relationship to where that there's a
[1:09:13] fellowship that takes place between God
[1:09:16] and his people like it was on the day of
[1:09:20] Pentecost lip to ear where there's a
[1:09:24] communion that you can have and a
[1:09:27] fellowship with almighty God hallelujah
[1:09:30] because after all when we look back at
[1:09:33] the temple back there that was there in
[1:09:36] the wilderness Solomon's Temple then
[1:09:38] when they re restored it herod's Temple
[1:09:41] on and on that that we could go all of
[1:09:43] that was a
[1:09:45] type and speaking not just of the Lord
[1:09:49] Jesus but the Lord Jesus came as the
[1:09:52] perfect reflection and example of what
[1:09:55] God intended every son and daughter to
[1:10:01] be and that was that in our lives we
[1:10:05] would become a House of Prayer
[1:10:09] Hallelujah and prayer we understand it's
[1:10:11] not ceremonialism
[1:10:13] you can be praying while changing your
[1:10:17] kids
[1:10:18] diapers you can be praying while you're
[1:10:20] working on a
[1:10:21] machine we realize prayer is not a
[1:10:24] tradition prayer is is a matter of the
[1:10:26] heart it's a communication it's a
[1:10:29] fellowship with almighty God as he said
[1:10:31] my house when they had wanted to take it
[1:10:33] away he said wait a minute I don't want
[1:10:36] my house filled with all these other
[1:10:38] things my house you made it a d of
[1:10:41] Thieves but it shall be called a House
[1:10:44] of
[1:10:45] Prayer I say God if there's anything in
[1:10:49] me that is hindering that cleaning
[1:10:52] out go right down lord and in the
[1:10:54] channel That if there's anything that's
[1:10:56] not allowing me in in my life and when I
[1:10:59] say me I'm talking about me as a Son of
[1:11:01] God you as a daughter of God son if
[1:11:03] there's any channel at all Lord then
[1:11:06] father will you lead us into that area
[1:11:08] amen bring healing into that area
[1:11:11] because you understand that sometimes
[1:11:12] when even we take even certain things
[1:11:15] into our body they'll talk about
[1:11:16] inflammation and how it it caused us to
[1:11:19] act and so forth and then we're living
[1:11:21] in an age in a time right now that is
[1:11:24] simply all about treating symptoms
[1:11:27] instead of getting to the root of the
[1:11:29] problem are you hearing me instead of
[1:11:32] recognizing well why you know let's not
[1:11:34] just treat the inflammation why is it
[1:11:38] there and sometimes it really isn't a
[1:11:40] great mystery it comes down to a lot of
[1:11:43] the things that we simply eat in a very
[1:11:46] simple way on a daily basis you see
[1:11:49] sometimes the things that really affect
[1:11:52] our lives and and so forth are not great
[1:11:54] big things that are out here but it's
[1:11:57] just the simple things sometimes the
[1:11:58] simple things that we're taking in or
[1:12:00] the things that were we're not taking in
[1:12:03] what we need to do but God never sent a
[1:12:05] word to treat symptoms
[1:12:08] amen because you see when you get to the
[1:12:11] root of the problem the symptoms will go
[1:12:14] right because what what the word of God
[1:12:17] comes to do is deal with the problem
[1:12:21] certainly right and so when the prophet
[1:12:23] could stand there and say I know now why
[1:12:25] I've always been against organizational
[1:12:28] ISM what it was is is getting down to
[1:12:31] what is the root of the problem what has
[1:12:33] been there and it's the spirit of God
[1:12:35] not us listen friends it's not us it
[1:12:39] wasn't brother brandom as a man he he
[1:12:42] was the prophet to this age yes but you
[1:12:45] realize it was God operating through
[1:12:47] that gift to what you know why all that
[1:12:49] was about was not only to call us back
[1:12:51] to the word but it was to demonstrate
[1:12:54] before you and I that I am your provided
[1:12:57] place of healing in this
[1:13:01] hour I am the Lord that Health
[1:13:06] thee that's why God did that because now
[1:13:10] our faith is not is not something that's
[1:13:13] back in the history but our faith is in
[1:13:16] the living presence of the Living God
[1:13:19] who said I am the same yesterday today
[1:13:21] and
[1:13:23] forever than you and he's
[1:13:25] healer he heals in every area of our
[1:13:30] life I want you to turn with me if you
[1:13:32] would to Luke Chapter
[1:13:39] 5 I want you to look here in Luke 5 and
[1:13:43] verse
[1:13:52] 17 the Bible says it came to passed on a
[1:13:55] certain day as he was teaching that
[1:13:58] there were Pharisees and doctors of the
[1:14:00] law sitting by which were come out of
[1:14:03] every town of Galilee and Judea and
[1:14:06] Jerusalem and the power of the Lord was
[1:14:10] present to heal
[1:14:13] them why was why was his presence there
[1:14:17] to heal
[1:14:18] them and behold men brought in a bed a
[1:14:23] man which was taken with apy in other
[1:14:26] words he couldn't get there on his
[1:14:31] own and they sought means to bring him
[1:14:33] in and to lay him before
[1:14:37] him so it's evident these men they knew
[1:14:41] who Jesus
[1:14:43] was and no matter whatever meeting they
[1:14:46] had been in wherever they had seen but
[1:14:50] they thought of their
[1:14:52] friend that's good yeah and it it wasn't
[1:14:55] it wasn't their friend it was
[1:14:58] them and here they're coming to bring
[1:15:01] their friend now notice when they could
[1:15:03] not find but what way they might bring
[1:15:06] him in because of the multitude they
[1:15:09] went up on the housetop and let him down
[1:15:12] through the tiling with his couch into
[1:15:15] the midst before Jesus now I don't
[1:15:19] know if they were able to really see
[1:15:21] where Jesus was at right right that's
[1:15:24] good
[1:15:26] or they were Guided by the same Faith
[1:15:30] right that caused them to pick
[1:15:33] up that c that bed that their man that
[1:15:37] that their friend was
[1:15:38] on but they I want you to understand
[1:15:42] this what they saw in front of them was
[1:15:46] obstacles right that's good come on and
[1:15:50] hindrances things that look like there's
[1:15:53] no way
[1:15:56] possible and you know what healing
[1:15:59] itself sometimes when you get to looking
[1:16:01] at it I don't care if it's a cold I
[1:16:04] don't care if it's back pain I've been
[1:16:06] in times where my back you know you'd
[1:16:08] realize you don't know how much you
[1:16:09] realize some of you with had dealt with
[1:16:11] your back when you laugh or you sneeze
[1:16:13] you're like dear Lord I don't want to
[1:16:14] cough I don't want to
[1:16:16] sneeze and you when you stand up you
[1:16:19] just saying I'll just stand up because
[1:16:21] when you go to sit back down then the
[1:16:22] spasm and everything starts and it's
[1:16:24] just and and you know so we've all been
[1:16:27] in situations and you
[1:16:29] wonder is this going to is this going to
[1:16:32] is this going to move is it going to you
[1:16:34] know and yet we're praying we're
[1:16:35] believing and and yet in our bodies
[1:16:37] sometimes we we don't feel anything
[1:16:39] moving we don't feel anything uh uh you
[1:16:41] know being lifted and yet within
[1:16:43] everything many times it's looking
[1:16:46] beyond the present condition and looking
[1:16:48] to God who made the promise and here it
[1:16:51] is there's always going to be hindrances
[1:16:55] there's always going to be oppositions
[1:16:57] but listen when oppositions present
[1:17:01] themselves that's the time to say
[1:17:07] yes when a doctor's report comes that
[1:17:10] isn't do good that's not the time to say
[1:17:12] no it's the time to say yes
[1:17:16] Lord It's a time when when you know that
[1:17:19] gloominess wants to come around or a
[1:17:22] hindrance and you know to move within
[1:17:24] our life to hold us back and you know
[1:17:26] anybody's ever experienced you know
[1:17:28] anxiety and anxiousness and those things
[1:17:30] like that you know those things can come
[1:17:32] around it can literally almost take your
[1:17:34] breath away and it's not a and in that
[1:17:37] moment in that time I'm not talking mind
[1:17:39] over matter but you know it's a time
[1:17:41] that David himself experienced that and
[1:17:44] he said he would say what time I am
[1:17:46] afraid I will trust in thee he also said
[1:17:49] in the scripture of how that God would
[1:17:51] pick him up in the Book of Psalms and
[1:17:54] set him in a large place that scripture
[1:17:56] means it would be God that would
[1:17:59] absolutely take away what seems to be
[1:18:02] smothering him and giving
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:07] space hallelujah
[1:18:10] hallelujah it's God it's God watching
[1:18:14] over his
[1:18:15] children Hallelujah the prophet tells us
[1:18:19] there when he takes us there into the
[1:18:21] Book of Revelations and how here he is
[1:18:23] one standing in the midst of the seven
[1:18:25] golden candlesticks he said it's though
[1:18:28] he said many have the concept as though
[1:18:31] that once God has saved us that he
[1:18:34] himself becomes
[1:18:36] disinterested and he said but that as
[1:18:39] though that he would be an onlooker he
[1:18:41] said but he's not just an onlooker he is
[1:18:44] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[1:18:49] candlesticks and let me tell you
[1:18:51] something what he spoke to that age when
[1:18:54] it was such bitter persecution it was
[1:18:56] such bitterness that was coming against
[1:18:59] them he spoke to them in the midst of
[1:19:01] that saman Ag and said I
[1:19:04] [Applause]
[1:19:05] knowall I
[1:19:07] know hallelujah hallelujah God knows all
[1:19:12] about even the suffering he
[1:19:15] knows the healing that we have need of
[1:19:18] in our
[1:19:23] lives this word word it heals yes it
[1:19:26] does soul spirit and
[1:19:34] body we've ministered here for a little
[1:19:37] bit on complexes that's not in the body
[1:19:41] that's in the spirit and you know what
[1:19:45] brother brand needed healing right come
[1:19:48] on he needed healing you know that that
[1:19:51] let that be out there for you and I
[1:19:53] because knowing we were going to come
[1:19:55] into those
[1:19:56] places we would have things within our
[1:19:59] lives that all of a sudden the spirit of
[1:20:01] God would Minister to us and we're
[1:20:03] saying Lord I want to get out here to
[1:20:05] the therapy I want to get out here but
[1:20:07] God said we got to work right here we
[1:20:08] got to make sure all everything's firing
[1:20:10] just exactly just right you see friends
[1:20:13] let me just say it like this God never
[1:20:16] complicated the gospel he never
[1:20:18] complicated our healing I just say it
[1:20:21] like this God God is the very one when
[1:20:24] we can look can say Lord I know I need
[1:20:26] healing I know I need help then the Holy
[1:20:29] Spirit if we'll just let go yes he'll
[1:20:32] take us
[1:20:33] there and you know you might not even
[1:20:36] know exactly how to pray about
[1:20:38] things anybody know what I'm talking
[1:20:40] about sometimes when you've had
[1:20:42] everything you don't even know how to
[1:20:43] pray where do I even begin I don't even
[1:20:44] know what words Lord but you know
[1:20:47] sometimes when you're looking at
[1:20:48] situations and you say well this is the
[1:20:50] need this is the need but sometimes the
[1:20:52] first need of if he healing is God going
[1:20:56] down and actually creating a faith in
[1:20:59] our
[1:21:00] hearts sometimes with healing it's God
[1:21:02] going down listen sometimes before even
[1:21:05] forgiveness can take place there's a
[1:21:07] need for
[1:21:09] healing you can't get ahead of the
[1:21:12] healing and gum to forgiveness yes
[1:21:15] forgiveness is a work of the heart yes
[1:21:18] forgiveness is an attribute of God yes
[1:21:20] it is a glor glorious powerful attribute
[1:21:24] that God has displayed over and over but
[1:21:27] he must display it through healthy
[1:21:31] healed
[1:21:36] branches and I'm sure we can read in the
[1:21:38] scriptures and fellowship on this that
[1:21:40] there's times where God expressed
[1:21:42] forgiveness we would have never even
[1:21:44] imagined it right right so you know what
[1:21:48] that you know what that says don't try
[1:21:50] to figure out what forgiveness is just
[1:21:52] say Lord make forgiveness in my
[1:21:56] life as it is in your life in your
[1:22:01] heart he because remember he's the
[1:22:04] Creator he's the
[1:22:08] Creator let me get back to my scripture
[1:22:11] here so good so
[1:22:14] notice the Bible
[1:22:16] said well verse 19 I read that verse
[1:22:20] 20 and when he saw their faith don't get
[1:22:27] nervous somebody said I heard that
[1:22:31] before but I want you to catch this
[1:22:34] verse 20 when he saw their
[1:22:41] faith it wasn't that he saw the faith of
[1:22:44] the man who was on the
[1:22:47] C he didn't bring himself there
[1:22:50] no brother BR said what it is he said
[1:22:53] when you get in meeting like this and he
[1:22:56] said here there are hearts that are
[1:22:58] believing he said God will work right in
[1:23:01] the midst of that time where faith is
[1:23:03] pulsating among other believers to bring
[1:23:07] your faith up to where it needs to be to
[1:23:10] receive what God has for you hallelujah
[1:23:14] hallelujah let me tell you something
[1:23:17] this is why when we look at this in the
[1:23:19] scripture this is why we need the
[1:23:22] Gathering in the house of God in live
[1:23:25] Ministry because let me tell you there's
[1:23:27] times like this that you may not feel so
[1:23:30] strong and you don't let's just be
[1:23:32] honest
[1:23:34] friends there's times I just was
[1:23:36] listening to brother brandham here just
[1:23:38] just yesterday and I just go right back
[1:23:40] to I thought my did I hear what I just
[1:23:42] heard I go I up and brother B said
[1:23:44] there's sometimes when I haven't been
[1:23:46] able to pray the prayer of faith it just
[1:23:48] wasn't
[1:23:52] coming I don't know about you but but I
[1:23:54] appreciate those statements I appreciate
[1:23:56] all the message but I I come back into
[1:23:59] those places there and you look and
[1:24:01] brother B actually takes this thought
[1:24:03] and he's dealing with how that when
[1:24:05] we're in a meeting that sometimes see
[1:24:07] how Satan wants to isolate you even to
[1:24:09] try he wants to try to get you on an
[1:24:11] island you were not meant to be on an
[1:24:14] island but you know what it will happen
[1:24:16] you know what starts out on an island it
[1:24:18] starts when there's a bruised
[1:24:21] Cil that's how cancer comes in cancer
[1:24:24] comes in the body but it can only take
[1:24:26] hold when there's a bruised
[1:24:29] cell cell that's offended it can only
[1:24:31] work within that way and there's only
[1:24:33] one thing that can take care of that
[1:24:35] because that cancer is a
[1:24:38] spirit are you hearing me now even when
[1:24:41] it thinks about well I I feel I feel
[1:24:43] offended do you realize that's just not
[1:24:46] well I just feel offended that's a
[1:24:48] spirit you might have a right or you
[1:24:50] might say I've got a real feeling but
[1:24:52] you've got to recognize justce much as
[1:24:55] when your sugar gets too high or your
[1:24:57] blood pressure is too great that's just
[1:24:59] not a feeling that's a
[1:25:01] Spirit come on diabetes is a blood
[1:25:04] sucking
[1:25:05] demon high blood pressure is a spirit
[1:25:07] diseases are
[1:25:10] spirits you say what what are you saying
[1:25:12] you're not saying I have a right to be
[1:25:14] offended what I'm trying to say is when
[1:25:16] that Spirit comes in it's trying to get
[1:25:18] a hold in your
[1:25:21] life to isolate you and start to work on
[1:25:29] you let me tell you we need we we we
[1:25:32] need the treatment of the radiating
[1:25:35] power of the raise of the son of
[1:25:39] righteousness are you hearing me that's
[1:25:41] the promise in his word that the son of
[1:25:43] righteousness would arise with healing
[1:25:45] in his wings we need the healing rays of
[1:25:49] the S so n moving down into our lives
[1:26:01] my my how did we get
[1:26:08] here let me go on here and he said unto
[1:26:12] him man thy sins are forgiven thee oh
[1:26:18] boy oh
[1:26:21] boy Jesus just knows how to stir the pot
[1:26:24] don't
[1:26:26] of all things you can say right
[1:26:30] now you know of all things you can say
[1:26:32] in front of these Pharisees these
[1:26:34] Skeptics these critics but he says man
[1:26:37] thy sins are forgiven thee and the
[1:26:39] scribes and Pharisees begin to reason
[1:26:41] saying who is this which speaketh
[1:26:44] blasphemies who can forgive sins but God
[1:26:48] Alone that was a duh moment
[1:26:55] recognize who is in your midst if that's
[1:26:58] being spoken who's in our
[1:27:02] midst you see these were men who were
[1:27:06] Disciples of the history of Moses but
[1:27:10] they were not Disciples of the god of
[1:27:15] Moses are you hearing me because if they
[1:27:18] had been Disciples of the god of Moses
[1:27:21] they would have been like the other
[1:27:22] Remnant waiting there and they would
[1:27:24] also know Hallelujah that when Israel
[1:27:28] failed there and made those golden
[1:27:31] calves after all was taking place down
[1:27:34] there Moses said I'm going up on the
[1:27:36] mountain to make an atonement for you he
[1:27:39] never even took a
[1:27:42] sacrifice are you hearing me now he
[1:27:44] never took a lamb he never took a ram he
[1:27:48] never took anything and you say well how
[1:27:50] can there be an atonement without a
[1:27:52] sacrifice but you
[1:27:54] God himself delivered his word and in
[1:27:58] the word is the life and Moses is going
[1:28:02] as an intercessor there on the mountain
[1:28:06] on their behalf so the true atonement is
[1:28:10] Jesus Christ now the spirit that was in
[1:28:14] the blood cell is in you and that blood
[1:28:17] is speaking better
[1:28:20] things it's the atonement living out in
[1:28:23] a people people that have experienced
[1:28:26] being
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:30] atoned they didn't know the god of Moses
[1:28:34] they knew the
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:40] history these were men they knew the
[1:28:44] law but here stood
[1:28:47] one who came in in a
[1:28:52] condition that somebody took no notice
[1:28:54] of him oh
[1:28:56] yes Jesus said why reason you in your
[1:28:59] hearts verse 22 whether is it easier to
[1:29:01] say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say
[1:29:05] rise up and walk oh now now here's the
[1:29:08] question what's
[1:29:10] easier to say thy sins are forgiven thee
[1:29:13] or rise up and walk right but that you
[1:29:16] may know that the son of man hath power
[1:29:19] upon Earth to forgive sins he said to
[1:29:23] the sick and py
[1:29:24] I say unto thee arise and take up thy
[1:29:27] couch and go into thine house and
[1:29:30] immediately he rose up before them and
[1:29:33] took up that whereon he lay and departed
[1:29:36] to his own house glorifying God and they
[1:29:38] were all amazed and they glorified God
[1:29:40] and were filled with fear saying we have
[1:29:42] seen strange things
[1:29:44] today now you know what Jesus pointed
[1:29:47] out to them when he said thy sins are
[1:29:50] forgiven thee they could not see that
[1:29:53] happen
[1:29:54] right I'm going to tell you if you ask
[1:29:57] that man who was on that couch let's
[1:30:00] Fellowship around this a little bit you
[1:30:03] know what it meant when God forgave you
[1:30:05] of your
[1:30:07] sins are you hearing me there was there
[1:30:10] was a lift That Came Upon Your
[1:30:13] Life brother Aon you remember that at
[1:30:15] that Blue Sky
[1:30:16] Restaurant right there in the middle of
[1:30:18] that restaurant sins were lifted
[1:30:21] forgiven and lifted up Hallelujah
[1:30:25] hallelujah what took place in an
[1:30:27] invisible realm people could have
[1:30:29] questioned it Hallelujah that's what
[1:30:32] they were doing and Jesus said just so
[1:30:35] that you'll know what has taken place in
[1:30:37] The Invisible realm will become visible
[1:30:40] before you take up your bed and
[1:30:44] walk what happened in The Invisible by
[1:30:47] the
[1:30:48] word it came and released him from his
[1:30:53] couch GL oh friends the same God that
[1:30:58] brings healing to your soul the same God
[1:31:00] that brings forgiveness of sin the same
[1:31:03] God that heals your soul is the same God
[1:31:06] that can move through and heal your body
[1:31:09] and heal your
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:12] spirit and your life begins to reflect
[1:31:16] what's happened on the
[1:31:20] inside and ain't it funny how that devil
[1:31:22] likes to you know he like the devil
[1:31:24] likes to turn it around nowadays and say
[1:31:26] well you know uh he used to heal we know
[1:31:29] he we know he forgives sins now but
[1:31:31] about healing we we don't know that oh
[1:31:34] my but let me tell you you can't have
[1:31:37] you can't have healing and salvation
[1:31:40] without the
[1:31:42] atonement because the atonement deals
[1:31:44] with
[1:31:46] both you see when the Bible said he was
[1:31:50] wounded yes for my transgression
[1:31:54] bruised for my iniquity and the
[1:31:57] chastisement of my peace our peace was
[1:32:00] upon him his side was open out of his
[1:32:04] side went water blood and spirit on his
[1:32:08] back he had stripes on his head he had
[1:32:11] crowns for your mind
[1:32:13] battles and that blood flowed from here
[1:32:16] here was this blood flowing and from his
[1:32:18] black his back as well brother Bram said
[1:32:21] all of those streams Blended in to one
[1:32:24] string running right down his legs he's
[1:32:28] not only the one for
[1:32:33] salvation he's my healer of my body the
[1:32:37] Healer of my mind the Healer of my
[1:32:40] spirit he is all things what I have need
[1:32:44] of he is the Lord that Health
[1:32:48] all th diseases they flow down they've
[1:32:53] all met in Jesus
[1:32:57] Christ hallelujah
[1:32:59] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:33:02] Lord this is why our main objective the
[1:33:06] prophet said is Souls because you can be
[1:33:10] healed tonight in your body and you'll
[1:33:12] be sick maybe again but once that Soul
[1:33:16] has ever come in contact with God it
[1:33:18] does not matter what comes your way that
[1:33:21] Soul has been sealed
[1:33:24] away in the presence of
[1:33:30] God now I than God for
[1:33:33] that cuz the prophet tells us he says
[1:33:38] you want to make your choice while
[1:33:39] you're in your right mind that's right
[1:33:41] he said because you never know what
[1:33:43] might happen to you some fever might fry
[1:33:46] your brain he said you might P into an
[1:33:48] accident and then you'll say things that
[1:33:52] you would not even know what you were
[1:33:55] saying it would come out here that maybe
[1:33:57] even against God and you oh what
[1:34:00] happened but the soul he said has been
[1:34:02] sealed the prophet said that's why I'm a
[1:34:05] real calvinistic thinker believing in
[1:34:07] the real true
[1:34:09] security that's why the prophet would go
[1:34:11] on to tell us in the demonology series
[1:34:14] he said you can take a man that's been
[1:34:16] converted man or woman that's been
[1:34:17] converted by the spirit of God down on
[1:34:20] the inside he said they might go into
[1:34:22] complete in insanity but their soul has
[1:34:26] been
[1:34:28] sealed
[1:34:29] Hallelujah you know what those two
[1:34:31] quotes I wish I had more time this
[1:34:33] morning to preach on it you know what
[1:34:35] them two quotes tell me that he is God
[1:34:38] over emotional distress he is God over
[1:34:42] anxiety he's God over depression he's
[1:34:45] God over the mental disturbances he is
[1:34:48] God and the seal holds the seal holds
[1:34:57] hallelujah
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:01] hallelujah
[1:35:02] hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[1:35:07] and forever oh my no wonder brother Ram
[1:35:10] could say oh how we love to see healing
[1:35:12] but oh there's nothing like seeing a
[1:35:14] lost soul come weeping their way to the
[1:35:16] altar God be merciful to me a sinner the
[1:35:18] mute will die again the paralytic will
[1:35:21] die all the sick will get sick again and
[1:35:24] die but that Soul that's saved is saved
[1:35:27] for eternity forever never to
[1:35:30] [Applause]
[1:35:33] perish let me just tell you something
[1:35:36] God has got claim over your
[1:35:40] soul and I'm want to just I'm want to
[1:35:42] let put the devil on notice the devil
[1:35:44] don't have the say
[1:35:50] so even of the trial or the test or the
[1:35:54] situation you here you are standing
[1:35:56] present and looking to God for healing
[1:35:58] listen God can drop healing just like
[1:36:01] that and then God can also drop a word
[1:36:03] and you hold to that word and that word
[1:36:05] gives you a vision to walk clear into
[1:36:07] your healing to know that I'm the Lord
[1:36:09] that Health all thine
[1:36:11] diseases let me just tell you something
[1:36:13] God will give you a confession yes you
[1:36:15] will are you hearing me God will put
[1:36:18] words in your mouth he'll let you know
[1:36:20] what to say you won't be saying words
[1:36:22] out here it W just be ramblings of a
[1:36:25] confession but that confession is coming
[1:36:27] from your soul I am the Lord that Health
[1:36:31] all thy
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:38] diseases Jeremiah
[1:36:41] 17:14 oh
[1:36:44] my we're just going to roll Jeremiah
[1:36:48] 17:14 Jeremiah said Heal Me Oh
[1:36:52] Lord and I shall be healed right save me
[1:36:58] and I shall be
[1:37:00] saved you know what that speaks of it's
[1:37:02] healing comes from
[1:37:04] God true salvation comes from God God is
[1:37:08] the one notice he's crying out heal me
[1:37:12] right I have need
[1:37:15] Lord oh my brother Bram says it like
[1:37:19] this turning pages will never do any
[1:37:22] good it takes something to happen happen
[1:37:23] on the inside any doctor will tell you
[1:37:26] if you put something on the outside and
[1:37:28] heal the sore over on the outside it
[1:37:31] only make it worse if it isn't he has to
[1:37:34] heal from the inside
[1:37:38] out that's right so do you realize where
[1:37:41] your healing is coming from the provided
[1:37:44] place of healing is in
[1:37:46] Christ and if you are in him at that day
[1:37:49] you shall know and I am in the Father
[1:37:51] the father in me I in you and you and me
[1:37:53] if we can recognize that where is that
[1:37:55] healing coming from it's coming from the
[1:37:59] inside amen and you say well what is it
[1:38:02] that releases that healing well it's
[1:38:04] like we said some Sundays ago getting
[1:38:07] water from one field to the other you
[1:38:09] got to walk work by the law of gravity
[1:38:12] and the law that you and I are called to
[1:38:14] work by is Faith and that's why faith
[1:38:18] brother BR would say it he's very clear
[1:38:21] in the message Divine Healing he said
[1:38:23] many times he said we say we believe it
[1:38:26] but we don't accept it but you see we've
[1:38:28] got to believe it and he says it like
[1:38:30] this then you accept it then you confess
[1:38:33] it and he begins to act out on your
[1:38:36] behalf now listen to me now brother BR
[1:38:39] said many times that's why he said at
[1:38:41] times where an individual could set for
[1:38:43] 10 years in the same spot believing the
[1:38:48] word but not accepting it wow you see
[1:38:52] you've got to accept it and accepted
[1:38:54] does not based upon your
[1:38:57] worthiness right it's not your
[1:39:00] worthiness listen he's already he's
[1:39:03] already made a way for you and I that we
[1:39:06] could accept the word don't argue
[1:39:09] against the pardon accept it don't even
[1:39:13] argue against Lord I have fallen so
[1:39:15] short Lord I failed so much and I've
[1:39:18] done this but look where the reason you
[1:39:20] can see where your shortcomings is at is
[1:39:23] the grace of God so you can see there is
[1:39:26] Grace to pick you from where you're at
[1:39:28] to where you need to be it is a blessing

[1:40:45] scripture
[1:40:46] here Bible said a sound
[1:40:49] heart is the life of the Flesh of sound
[1:40:53] heart a helpful
[1:40:55] heart is the life of the
[1:41:13] flesh you know sometimes when there's
[1:41:15] things that take place inwardly in US it
[1:41:18] affects us
[1:41:20] outwardly that's right
[1:41:24] every one of us according to your
[1:41:26] perspective and your occupation in life
[1:41:30] whether it's from students on
[1:41:32] up we all experience
[1:41:37] stress sometimes there's things that
[1:41:39] just leaves us in a
[1:41:41] place I know at different
[1:41:44] times I've experienced that with stress
[1:41:46] I can always kind of tell you know a lot
[1:41:49] of things can go in my mind because I
[1:41:50] feel this tightness
[1:41:55] and uh you can't sleep no I want to
[1:42:00] sleep I feel tired but you get things on
[1:42:04] your mind needs yes things are buring
[1:42:08] you know you can't just go up the stress
[1:42:11] and say off that's right I'll see you at
[1:42:14] 8 in the
[1:42:15] morning I'll get up you make sure you
[1:42:17] snooze your
[1:42:21] alarm but you know
[1:42:24] as we would begin to just just look to
[1:42:27] the Lord sometimes I've had it where
[1:42:28] it's man it's been days and weeks and
[1:42:31] things and I'm W Lord I I commit this in
[1:42:33] your hand I I don't know how to solve
[1:42:35] this I don't know how to go about this
[1:42:37] and sometimes it isn't just one thing it
[1:42:39] you know working with that of the church
[1:42:41] and and things but also family and
[1:42:43] you're seeing all the seeing different
[1:42:45] things and things sometimes can just
[1:42:46] compound you you can't it's almost like
[1:42:48] it's a mixture I mean you to try to sort
[1:42:52] it out it's almost like that junk drawer
[1:42:53] in the kitchen you know it's called The
[1:42:56] Catch
[1:42:57] All it catches pizza coupons from two
[1:43:00] years ago and you know it has things no
[1:43:02] my wife's not that bad but you
[1:43:03] understand y'all yall know what I'm
[1:43:05] talking about it's like a catch all
[1:43:09] right and it can build up within us Y
[1:43:13] and it starts to affect us then you
[1:43:15] don't sleep sure right and let's just be
[1:43:18] honest get our angel wings out of here
[1:43:21] right I don't care you can say well I
[1:43:22] don't need much
[1:43:26] sleep we'll try to we'll ask the people
[1:43:28] you've showed your teeth to if whether
[1:43:29] you need that much sleep or
[1:43:31] not let's let's be honest sometimes we
[1:43:34] look and we're looking at things and we
[1:43:36] think my goodness what's going on on the
[1:43:38] job is everybody lost their mind and and
[1:43:41] everything and here we are we're just
[1:43:42] moving into those Realms like that and
[1:43:45] you know what it is
[1:43:47] stress
[1:43:48] tension and it's affected even the
[1:43:51] natural sleep
[1:43:53] and the scripture tells us he giveth his
[1:43:56] beloved
[1:43:59] rest one of the greatest greatest
[1:44:02] greatest properties of healing is
[1:44:07] sleep what a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:11] there's nothing greater than the rest of
[1:44:14] the Holy
[1:44:15] Spirit you might say well brother Samuel
[1:44:18] why do we experience those things in
[1:44:20] this life why do we still experience in
[1:44:23] stress if we're standing as Believers
[1:44:26] because this right here has not yet been
[1:44:31] redeemed and sometimes we in our mind
[1:44:33] we're looking at things of how to make
[1:44:36] things come together and you know what
[1:44:38] it's all then a process where we have to
[1:44:40] move into that place and it takes God by
[1:44:43] his grace to help us to say Lord I want
[1:44:47] to commit this into your hands let's
[1:44:49] just be honest sometimes we even need we
[1:44:52] need the help right there to say Lord
[1:44:54] give me what I need to be able to put it
[1:44:56] in your
[1:44:58] [Music]

[1:45:21] emotionally nothing nothing nothing
[1:45:25] nothing nothing seems the
[1:45:29] same you can be setting and yet you're
[1:45:31] so distant right true trying to work
[1:45:36] through different things you say what's
[1:45:38] needed
[1:45:39] healing
[1:45:41] healing oh I I don't need appe peal I'm

[1:46:16] Lord prise the Lord Hall let me try to
[1:46:20] bring this down on this
[1:46:23] brother Bram is
[1:46:25] praying he says our heavenly father we
[1:46:29] bring to you this great line of sick
[1:46:31] people God just than many of these in
[1:46:34] here I trust that every one of them are
[1:46:36] your children born of the spirit washed
[1:46:39] in the blood and filled with the Holy
[1:46:40] Ghost ready for the coming and Satan
[1:46:44] can't get to them that way to make them
[1:46:47] sin he can't get them to make them doubt
[1:46:50] your word is wrong then go ahead and
[1:46:53] follow it just to the
[1:46:55] letter but then he tries to come along
[1:46:58] and afflict their body because he knows
[1:47:01] that their bodies still sin but their
[1:47:05] soul is saved their bodies got to go
[1:47:09] back to the dust but their soul goes to
[1:47:11] God so he tries to afflict that part
[1:47:17] what he can right notice that part what
[1:47:21] he can right there's only one place in
[1:47:25] your being that is off limits that Satan
[1:47:29] cannot even put Footprints there right
[1:47:34] that's your
[1:47:38] soul if you let him in your spirit it'll
[1:47:42] route that Spirit he can get that spirit
[1:47:44] all twisted around all Tor up and then
[1:47:47] he'll start going and try to haunt at
[1:47:50] that seal the prophet used these words
[1:47:52] he'll tease at that seal he'll punch at
[1:47:56] that
[1:47:57] seal why because if he can get you to
[1:48:01] doubt what God has done in your
[1:48:06] life that's trth then you're doubting
[1:48:09] your weapon that's
[1:48:12] right and and the and the py and the
[1:48:15] sickness it just laying there right but
[1:48:19] let me just tell you something
[1:48:23] you may not have the faith to rise up
[1:48:26] but God has sent Faith oh yes to anoint
[1:48:31] your faith
[1:48:34] am let me just say this to
[1:48:37] you I trust nobody goes out here right
[1:48:40] now and your car batter is
[1:48:43] dead but if it
[1:48:46] is somebody's got jumper cables anybody

[1:49:09] all know what it's like to drive cars
[1:49:11] that you pray they turn on it makes you
[1:49:14] appreciate the cars you got
[1:49:16] now right that's true but you carry them
[1:49:19] jumper cables because if that battery it
[1:49:22] won't W turn over what you got to do is
[1:49:24] you got to go and find another car and
[1:49:27] you know what that person does they pull
[1:49:28] up to your car you got to raise up your
[1:49:31] hood right and they go to put them on

[1:49:37] and they know how those who handles them
[1:49:39] they know what terminal goes first and
[1:49:40] which one next is that right else they
[1:49:42] could fry your system
[1:49:46] good and then they tell you while their
[1:49:49] car is running their car is running get
[1:49:52] in and start your car right now you know
[1:49:54] what's going to happen that car itself
