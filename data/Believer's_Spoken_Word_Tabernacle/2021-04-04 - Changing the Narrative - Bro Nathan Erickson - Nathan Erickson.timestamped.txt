[33:24] just appreciate the opportunity to be
[33:26] here
[33:26] always feel so at home here i don't
[33:28] think there's hardly a church
[33:30] anywhere that feels as much like home as
[33:32] this church
[33:33] except for home amen but i'm glad to be
[33:36] in my home away from home
[33:38] to celebrate easter with you and
[33:40] fellowship around the word of god so god
[33:42] bless you let's turn to mark the 16th
[33:43] chapter
[33:44] and we'll just go directly to the word
[33:52] i want to greet all our dear friends
[33:53] that are here bring greetings from the
[33:55] home church
[33:56] for the ray the family send their love
[34:12] mark chapter 16 and we'll just start
[34:15] there at the ninth verse
[34:17] and i just want to pull a few things out
[34:19] of this uh
[34:20] this scripture part of the easter story
[34:23] and maybe we'll go a little bit
[34:25] different direction with it today but we
[34:27] trust the leadership of the lord
[34:29] the word says here now when jesus was
[34:31] risen early the first day of the week he
[34:33] appeared first to mary magdalene out of
[34:34] whom he had cast seven devils
[34:37] and she went and told them that had been
[34:39] with him as they mourned and wept
[34:41] and they when they had heard that he was
[34:43] alive and had been
[34:44] seen of her believe not notice
[34:48] that there after that he appeared in
[34:51] another form unto two of them as they
[34:52] walked and went into the country
[34:54] and they went in and told it to the
[34:56] residue and neither believed they them
[35:00] but afterward he appeared to the 11 as
[35:02] they sat at meat and uprated them with
[35:04] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[35:06] because they believed not them which had
[35:08] seen him after he was risen so
[35:10] jesus appears with a personal presence
[35:12] and it changes the whole perspective
[35:15] uh when he when he proved it to them
[35:17] they couldn't help but believe that he
[35:18] was alive right
[35:19] amen so it changed it changed the
[35:22] narrative there and that's my
[35:23] that's my text this morning changing the
[35:25] narrative
[35:26] changing the narrative but let's just
[35:27] finish up this this wonderful chapter
[35:29] here
[35:31] it says uh that he appeared to the
[35:32] eleven and he said unto them
[35:34] now that he's changed the narrative now
[35:36] that he had now that
[35:37] uh faith has struck their hearts they
[35:39] believe the good news of the gospel
[35:42] now it turns around to be a commission
[35:43] he says go
[35:45] into all the world and preach the gospel
[35:47] the good news to every creature he that
[35:49] believeth in his baptizes
[35:51] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[35:52] shall be damned and these signs shall
[35:54] follow them that believe
[35:55] in my name they shall cast out devils
[35:57] they shall speak with new tongues they
[35:59] shall take up serpents if they drink any
[36:01] deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[36:03] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[36:04] they shall recover so then after the
[36:06] lord had spoken unto them
[36:08] he was received up into heaven and sat
[36:10] on the right hand of
[36:12] god amen amen mercy first and appearing
[36:15] then a believing amen and then a change
[36:18] of the narrative
[36:19] and then a commission to speak the good
[36:21] news hallelujah uh before we pray let's
[36:24] let's just quickly grab
[36:25] matthew chapter 15 as well
[36:28] just verses 10 and 11 there in matthew
[36:30] 15
[36:32] where jesus says this
[36:35] he called unto the multitude and said to
[36:36] them hear and understand
[36:40] it's not that which goeth into the mouth
[36:41] that defileth a man
[36:43] but that which cometh out of the mouth
[36:46] this defileth
[36:47] a man can you say amen to the reign of
[36:49] the word let's have just a word of
[36:51] prayer heavenly father

[36:54] easter time father for the gospel that
[36:56] we're carrying
[36:57] lord a good news a positive gospel lord

[37:15] just come in our midst lord and
[37:16] and bring our everything our our lives
[37:18] our attitudes our confessions lord in
[37:21] line with the word of god but because
[37:23] lord
[37:23] we know that that's the channel that has
[37:25] life in it oh god
[37:27] i pray that you would just be able to
[37:28] minister to your people father
[37:30] that you would just address lord we

[37:35] would not presume
[37:36] lord that we could bring anything lord
[37:38] that would be a help but we're trusting
[37:40] completely in the leadership of the holy
[37:41] spirit

[37:44] god as we surrender ourselves we
[37:46] surrender our beings we surrender our
[37:47] minds and our
[37:48] and our testimonies unto you and your
[37:50] word father in the name of the lord
[37:52] jesus christ we dedicate this service to
[37:54] you
[37:54] in jesus name amen god bless you as
[37:56] you're seated this morning
[37:58] and we just want to take a little
[37:59] thought on changing the narrative
[38:02] amen it's a timely time for
[38:05] for uh that type of a thought
[38:08] so if you'll uh if you'll bear with me i
[38:10] want to lay uh take a a lengthy time
[38:13] here and just lay out a foundation
[38:15] uh so turn with me to james the third
[38:17] chapter
[38:18] and this is that familiar scripture
[38:20] where james begins to talk about the
[38:21] power of the tongue
[38:23] the power of the tongue and i believe
[38:24] that i believe that as christians
[38:26] especially as believers there's a power
[38:29] there's a
[38:30] there's a strength there's a there's a
[38:32] there's a power in the words that we say
[38:34] the things uh uh our testimony not even
[38:36] the
[38:37] necessarily just the words you say but
[38:38] your whole outlook your
[38:40] you know your your attitude all those
[38:42] things have a power
[38:43] just in the world but especially to a
[38:45] believer there's a power
[38:46] amen so james chapter 3 and we'll start
[38:49] the second we'll
[38:50] come down to the 10th verse james says
[38:53] here for in many things we offend all
[38:55] but if any man offend not in word the
[38:56] same is a perfect man
[38:58] and able also to bridle the whole body
[39:00] he said behold we put bits in the
[39:02] horse's mouths
[39:03] that they may obey us and we turn about
[39:05] their whole body behold also
[39:07] the ships which though they be so great
[39:10] and are driven of fierce winds yet are
[39:11] they turned about with a very small helm
[39:13] whether so ever the governor listed
[39:15] even so the tongue is a little member
[39:18] and boasteth great things behold how
[39:20] great a matter a little fire kindleth
[39:22] and the tongue is a fire it's a world of
[39:25] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[39:26] members that it defileth the whole body
[39:29] and it setteth on fire the course of
[39:30] nature and it's set on fire of hell now
[39:33] james is
[39:33] you might think your pastor's ever
[39:34] preached on you but get let pastor james
[39:36] get to go on he's
[39:38] he's pretty rough but he says for every
[39:40] kind of beast and birds and serpents and
[39:42] things in the sea is tamed and hath been
[39:43] tamed of man
[39:45] but the tongue can no man tame amen
[39:49] it is an unruly evil it's full of deadly
[39:51] poise and therewith blessed we god even
[39:53] the father and therewith curse we men
[39:54] which are made after the similitude
[39:56] of god out of the same mouth proceedeth
[39:58] blessing and cursing
[39:59] he said my brethrens these things ought
[40:01] not to be so
[40:02] james is is admonishing the church about
[40:04] a power that's in the tongue of power in
[40:06] the words that we say
[40:07] and though it would be a little thing
[40:09] yet it has a great power in our life
[40:10] amen
[40:11] and uh and and so uh james is taking it
[40:14] on the negative side there but i want to
[40:16] take it to the positive side
[40:17] and preach on changing our narrative
[40:19] amen to to
[40:21] to uh to come into harmony with the word
[40:23] of god because i believe there's a power
[40:25] in the words that we say but especially
[40:26] when we begin to speak the word
[40:28] and we make our confession match the
[40:30] things of the word amen there's a power
[40:32] in the believer
[40:33] amen that that will bring your whole
[40:35] life into subjection to the word that
[40:37] you're saying
[40:38] amen because it's his word not just our
[40:40] words now now
[40:41] you notice the analogies here in the
[40:43] scripture that james is talking about
[40:45] uh uh and all the analogies of the
[40:47] scripture are perfect they're not
[40:48] haphazard but they
[40:49] they have a perfect meaning he he
[40:51] compares the tongue to a bridle
[40:53] in a horse's mouth a bit amen he he
[40:55] compares it to a little helm that steers
[40:57] a whole ship
[40:58] and so what the tongue is is a seed of
[41:00] control
[41:01] in other words whatever spirit is ruling
[41:03] your tongue is ruling your confession
[41:05] the things that you say
[41:06] that's controlling your whole life but
[41:08] it's all happening here in the seat of
[41:09] control of your tongue amen
[41:11] so the tongue has a power and that power
[41:13] can either be harnessed by god or it can
[41:14] be harnessed by the devil they both
[41:16] both of them operate by that same power
[41:18] it's a seat of control
[41:20] and so your whole christian life is
[41:21] going to be controlled by whatever power
[41:23] rules your tongue because that's where
[41:25] that's where the control is happening
[41:27] you you have all the everything else
[41:28] going in your life there's many factors
[41:30] there's many
[41:31] mechanical things many machinations of
[41:34] of your life and lots of moving parts
[41:36] and moving pieces
[41:38] amen but it's it's this one seat it's
[41:40] this one place it's this one
[41:41] it's this one area where we either
[41:43] succeed or we fail all of all of
[41:45] victories are won by the tongue all of
[41:47] our defeats happen by the tongue
[41:49] a good a a good attitude a good
[41:51] confession
[41:52] a good testimony or a bad one all
[41:54] happens in the tongue amen
[41:56] amen and that's why the bible says that
[41:57] jesus christ and brother branham begins
[41:59] to talk about this i'm using the word
[42:01] narrative but i'm not bringing some
[42:03] crazy thing brother branham
[42:04] uses the word confession or profession
[42:06] amen and he talks about it a whole lot
[42:08] because it's something very important
[42:10] very vital in the life of a believer
[42:12] that that we have the right confession
[42:14] because the bible says that he is the
[42:16] high priest
[42:17] of your profession of your confession
[42:19] not a brother branham's confession or
[42:21] what your pastor's preaching necessarily
[42:23] or the way that you were raised and what
[42:24] your parents taught you but he's the
[42:26] he'll be the high priest of your
[42:28] confession
[42:28] in other words you have to have a
[42:30] confession you have to have a testimony
[42:32] you have to
[42:33] you have to be using your mouth to speak
[42:35] the word of god so that god can come and
[42:36] empower that that's god's
[42:38] that god's law it's god's system we find
[42:40] how brother branham brings it out
[42:42] how that it works uh there's a there's a
[42:44] there's a law that god operates by it's
[42:45] the law of confession
[42:47] uh and and the way that that works is
[42:49] you begin to hear god's voice
[42:51] how shall anyone believe except they
[42:52] hear amen except god sent a preacher how
[42:55] would we
[42:55] we begin to hear the word and it begins
[42:57] to bring faith up in our heart
[42:59] based on what we're listening to faith
[43:01] comes in the heart now
[43:02] now in your heart you begin to believe
[43:04] it you can either believe it or
[43:05] disbelieve it there's a power in you to
[43:07] either accept god's word or
[43:09] or reject god's word right and then but
[43:12] if you believe it you begin to confess
[43:13] it with your mouth it begins to change
[43:15] your testimony it begins to change your
[43:17] confession
[43:18] amen and then god will act upon your
[43:20] confession
[43:21] amen uh he doesn't just come and and
[43:24] program you like a robot
[43:26] or just or just forcefully uh uh bring
[43:29] you through the
[43:30] the different happenings of your life
[43:31] but he's operating upon the confession
[43:33] that's on your mouth based on your
[43:35] belief in the word that you're hearing
[43:36] amen
[43:37] and that's god's system it's it's it's
[43:39] his law he operates that way
[43:40] the bible says for with the heart man
[43:43] believeth
[43:44] unto righteousness amen and with the
[43:47] mouth
[43:47] confession is made unto salvation right
[43:50] so the heart believes but then the mouth
[43:52] speaks and the confession is made with
[43:54] the mouth unto salvation so the power of
[43:56] salvation unto you
[43:57] is to believe god's word believe in his
[43:59] uh believe in the purchase
[44:00] price of calvary but then you begin to
[44:02] speak it you begin to confess it i am
[44:04] saved i am covered by the blood amen
[44:06] i am a i am a justified son of god
[44:10] brother bran has said this very powerful
[44:11] thing he said he cannot do one thing for
[44:14] you
[44:15] until first you believe in your heart
[44:17] that he has done it
[44:18] and then say that he's done it he can't
[44:21] do
[44:22] one thing for you notice that unless you
[44:25] believe in your heart that he's done it
[44:26] and then you say that he's done it and
[44:28] the minute you believe it
[44:29] and say it he said he's there to make
[44:31] intercession
[44:32] on your confession now he said now look
[44:34] you can come now
[44:35] speaking of salvation now he says now
[44:37] you could come to the altar here you
[44:38] could scream and cry
[44:40] walk up and down the floor and scream
[44:41] god save me a sinner he said that won't
[44:43] do one speck of good
[44:44] you could do that tonight all night all
[44:47] day tomorrow and the next night beat on
[44:49] the floor anything
[44:50] that you want to do he said you're just
[44:52] giving vent to your feeling but you can
[44:54] never be
[44:55] saved unless you first believe it and
[44:57] then you confess it amen
[44:59] amen now we're not preaching against
[45:00] altar calls or emotion
[45:02] amen or or or or uh you know you service
[45:05] anything like that
[45:06] but but there has to be something that
[45:08] happens in the heart to to accept what
[45:10] god is offering
[45:11] amen in other words you yourself you
[45:13] can't beat it out of a bench now i'm a
[45:15] young man
[45:15] who went to a youth camp and beat his
[45:17] fist on a bench thinking that he could
[45:19] beat the holy ghost out of a bench
[45:21] amen and not knowing any more in my
[45:22] spirit but but out of desperation
[45:25] amen we get desperate with god god i
[45:27] want the holy ghost god i want to change
[45:28] in my life i want keeping power
[45:30] i want a reality in my life but you know
[45:33] you can't beat that out of an altar
[45:35] amen but what it comes when when the
[45:37] holy ghost comes amen where it came from
[45:39] me
[45:39] was by a revelation amen somebody take
[45:41] me aside and say are you here for the
[45:43] holy ghost yes i am
[45:45] well then what you got to do just thank
[45:47] him for it because it's for you
[45:48] amen and then the revelation drops down
[45:50] in the heart and a young heart believes
[45:53] it believes what brother brown said that
[45:54] he wants to give you the holy ghost more
[45:56] than you
[45:57] want it amen but you've got to believe
[45:58] it then you begin to confess it thank
[46:00] you lord for the holy ghost
[46:02] amen and upon the law of confession your
[46:04] life amen has to come up under
[46:07] the authority of the word but he can't
[46:09] do it for you
[46:10] until first you believe it and then you
[46:12] say that he's done it amen
[46:14] that's the system that god has created
[46:16] that's how he operates by the law of
[46:18] confession that's not
[46:19] that's for the holy ghost that's for
[46:20] salvation that's for healing that's for
[46:22] deliverance
[46:23] everything that the the blood paid for
[46:25] is ours but you have to believe it and
[46:27] you have to confess it
[46:29] amen that's the law that's the system
[46:30] that god created now
[46:32] now how many understands god's law of
[46:34] confession now but you
[46:36] how many know that the devil can't
[46:37] create the devil's not a creator the
[46:40] devil
[46:40] cannot he cannot take what god has put
[46:42] into place
[46:43] and and create something new because
[46:46] he's not a creator what but what the
[46:47] devil does
[46:48] is he takes what god has created and
[46:50] then he perverts it amen
[46:51] amen he he he will pervert it it's what
[46:54] he's done to this fallen world
[46:55] god created the world god made the
[46:57] systems god made the laws of physics and
[46:59] things by which the world
[47:00] operates but the devil came in and
[47:02] perverted that but he couldn't bring
[47:04] something new
[47:05] so in other words the devil is bound to
[47:07] god's system he's bound to god's law of
[47:09] confession and he can only twist that
[47:11] system to work for evil
[47:12] now brother braham said the reason if
[47:14] you don't believe in divine healing
[47:15] he said that the reason for that is the
[47:17] devil found a weak spot in you and he
[47:19] perverted it because god is the healer
[47:21] amen but to not believe in your for your
[47:23] healing means the devil perverted
[47:25] something
[47:26] amen that that god had there in the
[47:27] first place now that's why we're
[47:29] fighting the greatest battle ever fought
[47:30] and we're living in such a time brother
[47:32] sister where we're just bombarded day
[47:34] after day and
[47:35] minute after minute every voice in the
[47:37] world is screaming at us
[47:38] there are so many distractions there are
[47:40] so many things to be discouraged by
[47:42] so much negative that we could focus on
[47:44] and what it all it's all a battle
[47:47] that is in the battleground the ground
[47:49] that's being fought over is your mind
[47:51] because that's where decisions are made
[47:53] that's a and so the satan is trying
[47:55] ins he's he's he's set up satan's eden
[47:57] to influence our minds
[47:59] right amen because the mind is the
[48:01] gateway to the spirit now
[48:03] now that's where james in chapter one
[48:05] there james says uh
[48:06] he said a double-minded man he's
[48:07] unstable in all his ways that
[48:09] that the the greek translation that is
[48:11] actually a two-sold man
[48:13] in other words somebody who's got two
[48:14] powers wrestling for his soul
[48:16] he can never be anything but unstable
[48:18] but one of those powers has got to get
[48:19] the control
[48:20] amen and that's that greatest battle
[48:22] ever fought through the mind the gateway
[48:24] to a spirit now
[48:25] satan has the power to bring an
[48:27] oppressive spirit into your life
[48:29] because he's operating by the law that
[48:31] god put in place now that's
[48:33] that's the way that a son of god or a
[48:34] daughter of god can be oppressed by a
[48:36] spirit be afflicted
[48:37] those things is because the reason the
[48:39] devil has the power to bring that on you
[48:41] is because he does it using god's law
[48:44] and god's law is the law of confession
[48:45] now watch eve now eve fell how did he
[48:47] fell
[48:48] he fell when she chose she chose to
[48:51] believe
[48:52] one word amen she didn't believe the
[48:54] full word of god
[48:55] amen but but uh because she chose to
[48:58] believe
[48:58] satan's lie instead of believing god's
[49:00] word and when satan came with a lie
[49:03] the lie had no power on over eve until
[49:05] she until she believed it and then she
[49:07] began to speak it we shall not
[49:09] surely die now i want you to notice
[49:11] there that's that that the devil didn't
[49:13] come with a new philosophy he didn't
[49:14] come with a different word than what eve
[49:16] had already received
[49:18] but what he came was a different
[49:19] narrative a different spin
[49:21] a different interpretation well he
[49:23] didn't mean you'd really die
[49:25] he didn't mean you know when when when
[49:27] when the lord said he's saying when the
[49:28] bible says this or brother
[49:30] brown said that he didn't really mean
[49:31] that he didn't you know
[49:33] it wasn't an absolute it was you know
[49:35] and it was that spirit of beginning to
[49:37] mess with god's narrative
[49:39] that's where satan that's where he fell
[49:41] and that's where every son or daughter
[49:42] of god will fall
[49:43] amen come under affliction make a
[49:45] mistake or get slipped up it always
[49:47] comes back to one thing
[49:48] where you departed from the word of god
[49:50] and you listen to the devil's lie
[49:52] amen and the reason and the reason that
[49:54] it has power over you is because it's
[49:55] operating by god's own system and you
[49:57] make this decision
[49:59] freely isn't that amazing you make it
[50:02] freely
[50:03] amen uh bro uh brother braham said the
[50:05] inside of your spirit is a soul and that
[50:07] will be controlled by one thing
[50:09] your free will your
[50:12] free will now he said you can accept
[50:13] what the devil says
[50:15] or you can accept what god says and that
[50:17] will determine what spirit is in there
[50:20] he said if it's the spirit of god it
[50:21] will feed on the things of god
[50:23] and it won't feed on anything of the
[50:25] world
[50:26] amen now see now now i can only think
[50:29] like uh like an engineer that's that's
[50:31] my trade that's my calling and so
[50:33] i like a system i like to understand a
[50:35] system i like
[50:36] when there's a law that's working like
[50:38] the law of confession i like that
[50:40] because
[50:41] if i if i can understand how a system
[50:43] works then i can understand why it fails
[50:45] i can do a failure mode analysis on that
[50:47] system because
[50:48] and so when when when you begin to look
[50:51] at god's system how it's supposed to
[50:52] work
[50:53] is you're supposed to be hearing the
[50:54] word of god amen and so the problem
[50:57] comes when we get away from hearing the
[50:58] word of god and we begin to listen to
[51:00] other voices and
[51:01] and it'll fail right there well now you
[51:03] believe that you hear the word of god
[51:05] but then there has to be the next part
[51:07] of the system there's got to be a faith
[51:08] in your heart
[51:09] you got to believe that word latch onto
[51:11] that word amen reject your thought about
[51:13] it
[51:14] and accept god's word accept god's
[51:16] narrative and believe that now
[51:18] okay you believe it you believe god's
[51:20] word there's a sincerity you believe the
[51:22] message you believe god sent a prophet
[51:24] but now wonder what's your testimony
[51:26] what's your confession
[51:27] what is your mouth saying what is the
[51:29] what are you speaking from your heart
[51:31] amen that's where we fall and so satan
[51:34] has the power
[51:35] to bring those things in amen because
[51:37] he's operating by god's
[51:39] own law it's not and now now listen so
[51:42] when we fail brother sister
[51:43] it always comes back to this law of
[51:45] confession that's where the devil that's
[51:47] how he works he can't create he has to
[51:48] operate by god's law
[51:50] and so the devil will cause you instead
[51:51] of belief instead of hearing the word of
[51:53] god
[51:53] he's trying to bombard you with his
[51:54] voices and his lies and then he's trying
[51:57] to get you not to believe god's word but
[51:58] to disbelieve
[51:59] and believe what he's telling you
[52:01] believe what the devil's telling you
[52:02] amen
[52:03] and then based on that he wants to
[52:04] change your confession until we have a
[52:06] bunch of negative christians and we have
[52:08] a bunch of people talking about defeat
[52:10] talking about how we'll never get over
[52:11] problems talk about the problems in the
[52:13] church
[52:14] and problems around the message and this
[52:15] and that and and make a negative
[52:17] testimony and when he's got you there
[52:19] brother sister
[52:20] he's got you right where he wants you
[52:22] amen do you know that when you fail
[52:24] brother sister
[52:25] amen you didn't fail for a lack of power
[52:27] and when a little mistake in your life
[52:29] or something goes awry
[52:30] there was no lack of power that caused
[52:32] you to fall amen there is enough power
[52:34] in a son or daughter of god
[52:35] to speak another world and go live on it
[52:38] there is not a lack of power
[52:39] amen why we fall when we fall brother
[52:41] sister it's not for a lack of teaching
[52:43] it's not for lack of understanding we've
[52:45] got an open word we have a gifted
[52:47] ministry we know the word we know where
[52:49] we stand we know what we believe
[52:51] so it's not a lack of teaching that
[52:52] causes us to fail it's not even a lack
[52:55] of faith
[52:56] amen now listen to this now it's not
[52:58] even a lack of faith it's where you
[53:00] decide in your mind to place your faith
[53:02] is where you fail
[53:04] you say well you see the devil will tell
[53:05] you you don't have enough faith
[53:07] amen and then he and what is he doing
[53:09] there he's getting you to believe that
[53:11] you begin to say well i don't have
[53:12] enough faith
[53:13] and then what are you doing you're using
[53:14] the faith that you have but you're
[53:16] putting it in the lie of the devil
[53:18] and he's hijacking your own god-given
[53:20] faith
[53:21] god's own system god's own law of
[53:23] confession the devil gets right in there
[53:25] and causes you to confess that your
[53:27] faith is not enough
[53:28] but you had enough faith to believe what
[53:30] the devil was telling you
[53:31] amen and that's what brought the power
[53:33] of the devil in your life
[53:35] but you have the right to choose
[53:38] glory be to god oh brother brown said
[53:40] it's a strange thing that so much
[53:42] thought of people they say well i'm weak
[53:45] my faith is not very much i'm not a very
[53:48] good christian
[53:48] anybody ever spoken that way that's just
[53:51] what the devil wants you to say
[53:53] you're just talking his language right
[53:55] there he said you must never say that
[53:58] amen don't ever let your testimony be
[54:01] negative
[54:02] let it be positive all the time i am
[54:05] saved
[54:06] i have god in my heart i believe him
[54:08] with all my heart never permit a
[54:10] negative thought to come in your mind if
[54:12] you can help it
[54:13] amen and see that's where the battle is
[54:15] amen is when we begin to
[54:17] uh sometimes it seems like we can't help
[54:19] it that's where brother brahm talked
[54:20] about the farmer he couldn't stop
[54:22] a bird from flying over every now and
[54:23] then but he could stop it from building
[54:25] a nest
[54:26] and we have the right we have the power
[54:28] friends
[54:29] you know when the brother bran was
[54:30] preaching these things amen he is he's
[54:33] telling you you can either choose the
[54:34] word of god
[54:35] or you can believe satan's lie you can
[54:38] choose you have the right to do it
[54:40] but see god in respect to your own free
[54:42] will and i don't want to go all into
[54:44] this tonight but
[54:45] i've got the quotes on it god in in in a
[54:48] manner of speaking he limits himself to
[54:50] the law of confession
[54:51] because he's respecting your free will
[54:53] to choose to make that decision to
[54:55] confess god's word
[54:57] amen see and so this this battle is
[54:59] being fought
[55:00] amen and now now now the devil come in
[55:02] and those birds will fly
[55:04] that'll come in you know you you hear
[55:06] the you hear uh we're just bombarded by
[55:08] this world and
[55:09] and these discouraging thoughts come in
[55:10] these dark thoughts come in
[55:12] but we don't have to entertain them
[55:14] brother man said don't entertain it you
[55:15] sound you might not be able to stop it
[55:17] but don't let it don't let it set up
[55:18] shop in your mind in other words don't
[55:20] let it change your narrative don't let
[55:22] it change your perspective your attitude
[55:24] toward the word of god when the devil
[55:26] comes all you have to do
[55:28] is say boo devil amen get thee behind me
[55:30] satan
[55:31] you don't have to argue with the devil
[55:33] you don't have to debate with him you
[55:34] don't have to give him the time of day
[55:36] amen young man when that little thought
[55:38] of lust comes in you don't have to mess
[55:40] with it
[55:40] argue with it prove something to the
[55:42] devil you just reject the devil
[55:45] identify it's the devil and call it a
[55:47] devil and move on speak the word and go
[55:50] forward amen or we mess around too much
[55:53] with the devil
[55:54] we get to reasoning with him arguing
[55:56] with him he's the master of that he
[55:57] created that
[55:59] not created but he he perfected it amen
[56:02] amen oh hallelujah now and we overcome
[56:06] now
[56:06] look at that so there's this great
[56:08] battle being fought over the minds of
[56:10] the leader
[56:10] why because god chose to operate by the
[56:12] confession of faith
[56:13] and so the devil is battling with
[56:15] everything he can he's coming at you
[56:16] full force poured out all the devils of
[56:18] hell
[56:19] amen trying to get into a seed of power
[56:21] and you know what that seed of power
[56:23] is it's your mouth it's your words it's
[56:25] your testimony
[56:26] because there's a power when a believer
[56:28] begins to speak the word of god god
[56:30] honors it the high priest works upon it
[56:32] and so the devil wants control of that
[56:34] amen oh now see now how do we overcome
[56:37] we overcome by the blood of the lamb
[56:38] and the blood of the lamb amen paid the
[56:40] price for deliverance
[56:42] the blood of the lamb paid the price for
[56:44] healing it paid the price for peace
[56:45] for the price for joy the price for
[56:47] every redemptive blessing that we have
[56:49] need of was paid for by the blood of the
[56:51] lamb but the bible says we overcome
[56:53] by the blood of the lamb and the word of
[56:55] our testimony
[56:56] amen oh this word works this blood works
[56:59] but not if you don't speak it not if you
[57:01] don't confess it
[57:02] amen let's bring our whole minds our
[57:04] whole attitude our whole confession
[57:06] subject to the word of god you know
[57:08] that's the only thing you'll that's the
[57:09] only way brother brahm said
[57:11] you will receive something from god
[57:13] watch this now this is
[57:15] this is a a powerful quote amen brother
[57:18] brown said this
[57:19] he said here's what it is friends he
[57:21] said you're a christian because you
[57:22] believe
[57:23] you're a christian
[57:26] and it's all settled because he's a high
[57:28] priest now i thought i thought we were a
[57:30] christian
[57:30] amen because we we caught we got 10
[57:33] years of church attendance
[57:34] you know and we got a worldwide ministry
[57:36] and uh
[57:37] and you know we we got this uh we we got
[57:39] this
[57:40] seniority with the message and we can
[57:42] talk about all the mysteries and we can
[57:44] do all those things no
[57:45] a man is a christian or a woman is a
[57:47] christian because they believe they're a
[57:49] christian
[57:49] and because their confession amos says
[57:51] that they are a christian
[57:52] and it's in respect to god's word which
[57:54] says you are a christian and it's all
[57:56] settled because he's a high priest
[57:58] now notice he's the high priest of your
[58:00] confession
[58:01] what you confess you are that's what you
[58:04] are that's what you are
[58:07] not what not what your eyes are telling
[58:09] you not what the devil's telling you you
[58:10] are
[58:11] not what the world thinks of you but
[58:13] what you confess you
[58:15] are by the word of god that's what you
[58:17] are brother bran talks about a drunk man
[58:19] he thinks about drinking he talks about
[58:21] drinking his whole life is about
[58:23] drinking
[58:24] and so he's a drunk because his because
[58:26] his confession is that he's a drunk
[58:28] his testimony is that he's a drunk but
[58:29] what about a christian friend
[58:31] who thinks about christ who talks about
[58:33] the word of god who believes the message
[58:35] with all their heart
[58:36] and their whole life is around it it's
[58:38] their their whole ef their whole being
[58:40] is based upon it
[58:41] then you are a believer then you are a
[58:44] son or daughter of god
[58:46] amen not because you might make a
[58:47] mistake or you get or condemnation tries
[58:49] to come on you
[58:50] or people criticize you or call you all
[58:53] kinds of names or fanaticism
[58:55] amen but because you believe
[58:58] that you're a christian then you are a
[59:00] christian because he's the high priest
[59:02] of that confession what does that mean
[59:03] friends
[59:05] it means you will never get any higher
[59:06] in christ than you are
[59:08] right now without a change to your
[59:11] confession
[59:12] that's what i that's what if if that's
[59:14] if nothing else gets across this morning
[59:16] the only way to get to the next step
[59:18] with christ the only way to come up
[59:20] higher the only way to bring more
[59:21] revival in the church more liberty the
[59:23] spirit
[59:23] the only way to the next step is a
[59:26] change
[59:26] in the confession because god operates
[59:29] by our confession that's why i'm talking
[59:31] about
[59:32] amen the narrative the narrative it's
[59:35] all important
[59:36] in your life amen now now
[59:40] what does that mean brother nathan that
[59:42] it's the it's it's
[59:44] it's the narrative now everyone in here
[59:48] every one of us in here every christian
[59:50] every person every human
[59:52] amen that's come to church this morning
[59:54] we will go through
[59:55] hard times we'll go through good times
[59:58] we'll win victories and we'll suffer
[1:00:00] defeats
[1:00:02] sometimes we'll be up on the mountain
[1:00:03] sometimes we'll be in of every single
[1:00:05] one preachers deacons
[1:00:07] amen a church member a musician every
[1:00:09] one of us
[1:00:10] amen will go through the cycles of a
[1:00:13] christian life
[1:00:14] amen and and and every one of us will
[1:00:16] suffer those things and so what it turns
[1:00:18] out according to the word of god
[1:00:20] is that it's not so important what
[1:00:22] happens in your life
[1:00:23] but what is most important is the way
[1:00:26] that you choose to interpret those
[1:00:27] things
[1:00:28] amen the way that you choose the the
[1:00:31] absolute by which you measure
[1:00:33] what you are going through amen the
[1:00:35] reality that you accept the narrative
[1:00:37] you understand what i'm saying amen
[1:00:39] where what is your truth
[1:00:41] what is that what is that where are you
[1:00:43] reading the story of your life because
[1:00:44] you'll hear
[1:00:45] many different versions amen uh you we
[1:00:48] could take the uh
[1:00:49] you know we could take the uh the
[1:00:50] institution of marriage for an example
[1:00:52] now i thank god for a message
[1:00:54] when it comes to when it comes to being
[1:00:55] a married man i i love this message
[1:00:58] because
[1:00:58] that revelation of an eternal mate and
[1:01:00] glory brings so much peace to a marriage
[1:01:03] amen i work with a co-worker and uh he
[1:01:05] was taught he was kind of confiding me
[1:01:07] one day
[1:01:08] and uh uh uh he he he ended up getting
[1:01:10] married he moved down to columbus and he
[1:01:12] bought
[1:01:12] he bought a real nice like 350 000 house
[1:01:15] beautiful house and
[1:01:16] and all this kind of thing and him his
[1:01:18] wife both work and so they could afford
[1:01:19] this
[1:01:20] this nice house and he was telling me
[1:01:21] one day he's like yeah you know i
[1:01:23] i've been losing sleep over this because
[1:01:25] you know here we got marrying we got
[1:01:26] this
[1:01:27] whole house and i can't afford that
[1:01:28] mortgage just on my salary you know and
[1:01:30] and i'm just looking at statistics now a
[1:01:33] lot of marriages don't last
[1:01:35] a lot of relationships don't last i
[1:01:36] thought i'm sure glad i've got something
[1:01:38] better than that
[1:01:39] amen to it because but that was the
[1:01:42] that was the narrative that was the
[1:01:44] understanding now watch if you're under
[1:01:45] that brother sister
[1:01:46] watch what happens in a marriage let it
[1:01:48] get into somebody's mind that
[1:01:49] something's wrong in the marriage or
[1:01:51] maybe they got the wrong one or maybe
[1:01:52] you're just not compatible
[1:01:54] and then you know you might have good
[1:01:55] days you might go on a nice date
[1:01:57] and have a romantic time and things like
[1:01:59] that and it but it doesn't really affect
[1:02:01] the narrative because in your mind
[1:02:02] it might not be okay it might it might
[1:02:04] be doomed to fail and then every little
[1:02:06] argument every little disagreement every
[1:02:08] little harsh word whether it's men or
[1:02:10] not
[1:02:10] it becomes part of a narrative isn't
[1:02:13] that right
[1:02:14] and then so and so what does that do it
[1:02:16] takes control of the whole thing
[1:02:17] amen because it doesn't matter how many
[1:02:19] good things happen every little bad
[1:02:21] thing
[1:02:21] serves to prove that the ship is sinking
[1:02:24] well it's the same way in your marriage
[1:02:25] to jesus christ
[1:02:26] amen you let it you you let a christian
[1:02:29] walk along life's journey
[1:02:30] and then they make a little mistake or
[1:02:31] they make a little failure they begin to
[1:02:33] think maybe i'm not saved maybe i never
[1:02:35] had the holy ghost
[1:02:36] maybe god doesn't maybe god doesn't
[1:02:38] choose me maybe i'm not elected maybe
[1:02:39] maybe i'm not going to make it maybe
[1:02:41] i've sinned away my day of grace and
[1:02:42] and that becomes you let that narrative
[1:02:44] begin to come into your mind
[1:02:46] amen and and it begins to just take
[1:02:48] every it takes control of everything
[1:02:50] because every mistake serves to prove
[1:02:52] that you were never called in the first
[1:02:54] place that god's grace is not for you
[1:02:56] amen because it all goes to prove the
[1:02:58] narrative but it's the wrong narrative
[1:03:00] it's not what the word speaks over you
[1:03:02] friends amen when you begin to
[1:03:04] when you begin to have the word revealed
[1:03:07] to you
[1:03:07] that grace is upon you that you are
[1:03:10] justified
[1:03:11] that the blood has covered all your sins
[1:03:13] amen that's the narrative of the word
[1:03:15] and when you've got the right narrative
[1:03:17] you might have a bad day but it's
[1:03:18] nothing but a bad day
[1:03:20] just a bad day just a temporary setback
[1:03:24] a temporary devil but there's an eternal
[1:03:26] seed on the inside
[1:03:28] that will hold you you've got to accept
[1:03:30] the narrative of god's word
[1:03:33] amen and then you begin to believe that
[1:03:35] it begins to take you to the next level
[1:03:37] it begins to take you to heights that
[1:03:39] you never thought were possible
[1:03:40] why because you were trying to climb
[1:03:42] based on your own power but the just are
[1:03:44] not
[1:03:45] saved by their works the just are not
[1:03:47] safe by their efforts the just are not
[1:03:49] saved
[1:03:50] by their religious excellent the just
[1:03:52] are safe by faith
[1:03:56] hallelujah you're a christian because
[1:04:00] you believe you're christian
[1:04:01] but that's why christians get stuck in
[1:04:03] that cycle of condemnation
[1:04:05] and it seems like they can never get out
[1:04:07] once a christian gets under there why
[1:04:08] because you'll never get out from under
[1:04:10] condemnation unless you change your
[1:04:11] confession
[1:04:12] amen condemnation we were dealing with
[1:04:14] the young people on condemnation
[1:04:16] a couple months ago and that is such a
[1:04:17] cruel devil and that's really the one
[1:04:20] that that
[1:04:20] that devil of condemnation is really the
[1:04:22] one that gets people messed up
[1:04:24] amen you know you know the things that
[1:04:25] we deal with you know lust or temper
[1:04:28] or or or selfishness or jealousy those
[1:04:30] things
[1:04:31] that'll trip you up but it's
[1:04:33] condemnation that gets on top of you
[1:04:35] and puts its foot on your neck and it
[1:04:37] makes you sit there
[1:04:38] and grovel under it until you feel like
[1:04:40] you've atoned for it
[1:04:41] amen until you gotta you you can't have
[1:04:44] joy because you've got to wait a week or
[1:04:45] two being miserable
[1:04:46] until you've paid for that mistake
[1:04:48] friends but you don't have to
[1:04:50] the word says you don't have to spend
[1:04:52] one moment
[1:04:53] under condemnation after a repentance
[1:04:57] amen repent and forget about it speak
[1:05:00] the word and go forward
[1:05:01] amen but that condemnation amen it has
[1:05:04] such a power it's such a powerful devil
[1:05:06] because it gets hold of your tongue
[1:05:08] it gets hold of your tongue doesn't it
[1:05:10] condemnation's a religious devil
[1:05:12] you ever get to start just preaching
[1:05:14] about no there is therefore no
[1:05:15] condemnation to them that are in christ
[1:05:17] jesus
[1:05:18] there's no there's no condemnation on
[1:05:19] you no guilt no shame
[1:05:21] you are clean amen you're holy you're
[1:05:24] pure
[1:05:24] according to the word of god and the
[1:05:26] blood of the lamb you begin to preach
[1:05:27] that to christian people that know the
[1:05:29] word
[1:05:29] and that religious devil starts arguing
[1:05:31] with you well brother nathan we don't
[1:05:33] believe we believe in grace not disgrace
[1:05:36] we believe that you know we believe in
[1:05:38] the blood and we believe in
[1:05:38] justification but there's got to be a
[1:05:40] life that follows it
[1:05:41] we don't just believe in just living in
[1:05:42] any way you know we're not just full
[1:05:44] calvinistic you know of course we
[1:05:46] believe those things
[1:05:47] of course there's a balance we know that
[1:05:49] there's a balance between
[1:05:50] between works and faith amen that we
[1:05:53] know that there's a balance there
[1:05:54] between law and grace
[1:05:56] but let me tell you something you will
[1:05:58] never strike the right balance
[1:06:00] unless you start with grace you will
[1:06:04] never
[1:06:04] you will never work your way to the
[1:06:06] right balance
[1:06:08] you will never you'll never climb out of
[1:06:09] the pit that you're in you will never
[1:06:11] get there with god you will never get
[1:06:12] the revelation right unless you start
[1:06:14] with grace
[1:06:15] because until your narrative is right
[1:06:17] until your confession is right
[1:06:18] then god can't stabilize your life he
[1:06:20] can't bring peace to you
[1:06:22] amen he can't even he can't even bring
[1:06:24] those works he can't even bring that our
[1:06:26] testimony unless you start with grace
[1:06:28] god here i am a sinner but i plead the
[1:06:30] blood of jesus christ
[1:06:32] and i know that i'm forgiven of my sins
[1:06:34] not only forgiven but justify
[1:06:36] amen i remember as a young man crying
[1:06:39] out to the lord
[1:06:40] in the ignorance of youth and
[1:06:43] and just not understanding of the lord
[1:06:45] like i do now and
[1:06:47] but how oh god you know i'm trying i
[1:06:50] i'm doing my best lord i want to turn
[1:06:52] over a new leaf i want to get somewhere
[1:06:53] i'm tired of dealing with these things
[1:06:55] that i'm dealing with and one day i
[1:06:56] threw up my hands i said god
[1:06:57] maybe i'm just praying about it wrong
[1:06:59] god instead of me instead of that lord
[1:07:02] just let me fall in love with you more
[1:07:04] let me experience more of your grace let
[1:07:05] me appreciate your mercy over me
[1:07:07] let me appreciate the blood that was
[1:07:09] shed for me amen i accept it lord
[1:07:11] i know that in myself i'm not what i
[1:07:13] want to be
[1:07:14] but thanks be to god according to the
[1:07:16] narrative of the word
[1:07:17] amen none of these things that i'm going
[1:07:19] through are written onto my life
[1:07:21] he's writing the book of my life and my
[1:07:23] failures aren't written in there brother
[1:07:24] sister
[1:07:25] your failures aren't written in there
[1:07:27] what's written over you
[1:07:28] is a hall of faith believer amen what
[1:07:31] moses thought what moses struggled with
[1:07:33] is not written in the scripture
[1:07:34] amen the things that were going through
[1:07:36] noah's mind on that ark as he was tossed
[1:07:38] on those dark waves
[1:07:40] all the doubts all the discouragements
[1:07:42] all those things are not
[1:07:44] written but what is written is faith
[1:07:48] of whom the world was not worthy heroes
[1:07:50] champions
[1:07:52] that's the narrative of god's word
[1:07:54] that's the story of your life
[1:07:56] hallelujah because you believe
[1:07:59] you're a christian brother bram said if
[1:08:01] you look back and say oh i'm doing this
[1:08:03] and i'm doing that then you're defeated
[1:08:05] but there's no condemnation to them
[1:08:08] which are
[1:08:09] in christ jesus that walk not after the
[1:08:10] flesh but after the spirit and then you
[1:08:12] realize
[1:08:14] that you've overcome amen
[1:08:17] you know but you say well brother nathan
[1:08:19] but you know
[1:08:21] i made this mistake i i'm going through
[1:08:24] this trial i'm
[1:08:25] struggling with this thing and and it's
[1:08:28] real i
[1:08:28] i'm experiencing it it's there you know
[1:08:32] that you can base
[1:08:32] different narratives on the same facts
[1:08:36] just like the you know like you look at
[1:08:37] political realm today they'll take the
[1:08:39] same study the same event the same thing
[1:08:40] that's happened
[1:08:41] and they they tell 10 different stories
[1:08:43] with the same fact
[1:08:44] until we want until it's like
[1:08:46] everybody's living in a different world
[1:08:47] a different reality
[1:08:49] amen and because it's not just the facts
[1:08:51] it's the way that you spin it
[1:08:53] and that's the way the devil comes your
[1:08:54] life the devil doesn't come with the the
[1:08:56] devil doesn't come with fairy tales he
[1:08:58] doesn't make something up he comes with
[1:08:59] the facts about what happened in her
[1:09:00] life
[1:09:01] and he comes with the word but what's
[1:09:03] wrong with the devil is not
[1:09:04] it's the word's not wrong but the way
[1:09:06] the devil's trying to use the word in
[1:09:08] your life is wrong
[1:09:09] and you've got to reject the devil's
[1:09:11] narrative and embrace amen the message
[1:09:14] of the bible the message of jesus christ
[1:09:16] then brother braham said you realize
[1:09:18] that you've overcome
[1:09:19] see the devil doesn't come with fiction
[1:09:21] he comes with the scripture he comes
[1:09:22] with a big long list of your sins and
[1:09:23] your
[1:09:24] and your shortcomings and all those
[1:09:25] things you say well brother nathan it's
[1:09:27] reasonable it stands to reason i was
[1:09:28] there
[1:09:29] it makes sense i'm struggling i i've
[1:09:31] been through this i came from that
[1:09:33] situation this is my background it makes
[1:09:35] sense what the devil's telling me it's
[1:09:36] reasonable
[1:09:37] of course it is that's why it's called
[1:09:39] reason
[1:09:40] you know brother branham preached a
[1:09:41] message called wisdom versus faith he
[1:09:43] said what we got to do we got a cast
[1:09:44] down reason
[1:09:45] your reason has nothing to do with it
[1:09:47] what's true what's absolute
[1:09:48] amen what is truth is the word of god
[1:09:51] and the word is speaking good things
[1:09:53] over you brother sister to give you
[1:09:54] an expected end hallelujah brother
[1:09:57] braham said we
[1:09:58] don't reason believe no matter what the
[1:09:59] circumstances don't pay attention
[1:10:02] to circumstances
[1:10:06] believe we need a change in the
[1:10:08] narrative we got so many people
[1:10:09] carrying condemnation caring
[1:10:13] and it's been able to pile up because of
[1:10:15] the confession of their life
[1:10:18] oh i don't know if i'll ever get over
[1:10:19] this brother nathan i don't know this is
[1:10:21] too strong this too hard for me this tri
[1:10:23] this happened to me that happened to me
[1:10:24] i came i've been through this
[1:10:26] that person said that and all these
[1:10:28] situations all these circumstances
[1:10:30] brother nathan
[1:10:31] amen but but and so it begins to pile up
[1:10:35] and
[1:10:35] condemnation doesn't just doesn't just
[1:10:37] come up all at once it kind of builds up
[1:10:40] we it kind of you don't really build a
[1:10:42] narrative just in one conversation
[1:10:43] you've got to keep enforcing that you've
[1:10:45] got
[1:10:45] you've got there has to be keep you got
[1:10:47] to keep speaking it until till there
[1:10:49] comes a faith till there comes a belief
[1:10:51] that's how god works that's how the
[1:10:52] devil works
[1:10:53] amen and so we begin to confess and
[1:10:55] confess and confess and it builds up and
[1:10:57] builds up
[1:10:58] amen i was i was explaining to the young
[1:11:00] people like i like to go backpacking my
[1:11:02] wife and i
[1:11:02] enjoy backpacking and camping you know
[1:11:04] and and sometimes i'll put on a backpack
[1:11:06] you know and when you get that loaded up
[1:11:08] with food and water and everything it'll
[1:11:09] weigh 20 25 pounds
[1:11:11] you know and i always have the same
[1:11:12] experience every time that we hike you
[1:11:14] know i'll get to the
[1:11:15] hike up to the top of the hill carrying
[1:11:16] that weight and i said my you know
[1:11:19] uh oh my you know i'm just wheezing
[1:11:22] and and uh and gasping because i'm out
[1:11:25] of shape
[1:11:26] you know and i've been expanding my
[1:11:28] borders
[1:11:30] and the pants i used to wear i wear them
[1:11:31] no more you know but
[1:11:34] but you're carrying that up and then you
[1:11:35] get to the top of that hill and just
[1:11:37] let it off and i always have the same
[1:11:40] experience because you let that thing
[1:11:41] off
[1:11:41] why you feel like you could just jump 10
[1:11:42] feet in the air because that weight
[1:11:44] that's just come off and i always have
[1:11:45] the same thought
[1:11:46] like ah at 20 25 pounds that's how much
[1:11:48] i need to lose
[1:11:50] yeah but when it comes on you know
[1:11:51] evening after evening
[1:11:53] with some cheese and crackers here and a
[1:11:55] bowl of cereal before bed there and it
[1:11:56] begins to build up slow slow so you
[1:11:58] don't realize that you're carrying it so
[1:12:00] many christians have been carrying alone
[1:12:02] there's people been 50 years in the
[1:12:03] church and carried condemnation every
[1:12:05] step of the way
[1:12:06] and no wonder you're exhausted and tired
[1:12:09] and fatigued and discouraged
[1:12:11] amen but you know condemnation doesn't
[1:12:13] come off like this
[1:12:15] it doesn't come off by by you know a
[1:12:18] year
[1:12:19] or two years of of of work and effort
[1:12:22] and sweat
[1:12:23] condemnation comes off like a backpack
[1:12:25] condemnation comes off like a bird and
[1:12:27] it roll
[1:12:27] this word can roll it away and all that
[1:12:30] it takes friends is believe what the
[1:12:31] word is speaking over you
[1:12:32] and change your confession and the and
[1:12:34] there's a high priest
[1:12:36] which will operate on your confession
[1:12:38] he's not operating on what your eyes are
[1:12:39] telling you he's not operating on the
[1:12:41] circumstances of your life but he's pain
[1:12:43] he's operating paying respect
[1:12:45] to your respect for his word when you
[1:12:47] say there's no
[1:12:48] therefore now no condemnation on me
[1:12:52] amen no weight on me i'm laying my
[1:12:54] burden down brother sister change your
[1:12:56] confession
[1:12:58] change your confession oh hallelujah
[1:13:00] brother braham said
[1:13:02] before you can be healed you have to
[1:13:04] confess it first you have to believe
[1:13:06] that you are healed and then when you
[1:13:07] believe you're healed god makes your
[1:13:09] body obey your confession
[1:13:11] and when you change your confession to
[1:13:12] match the word circumstances will
[1:13:15] bend to your faith amen oh he said if
[1:13:18] you'll take the right mental
[1:13:19] attitude toward any divine promise god
[1:13:22] has made it will bring it to pass
[1:13:24] what is the right mental attitude he
[1:13:25] explains it here he says if you'll just
[1:13:27] simply say it's god's word it's not for
[1:13:29] me
[1:13:30] to try to figure it out that's god's
[1:13:32] business he's spoken and that's all
[1:13:34] that's necessary
[1:13:35] brother ram said something will take
[1:13:37] place
[1:13:38] amen one of my one of my little
[1:13:40] testimonies in my life of healing one of
[1:13:42] the few times i've experienced divine
[1:13:43] healing
[1:13:44] one time i was work back when i worked
[1:13:46] for united airlines handling baggage and
[1:13:48] i was a little little bag came down the
[1:13:50] belt loader and i kind of yanked on that
[1:13:52] thing to throw it up in the cart
[1:13:53] it was a lot heavier than it looked and
[1:13:55] you know when you just
[1:13:56] when you move a little bit wrong and
[1:13:58] you're like oh i messed up
[1:14:00] you know what i'm talking about and it
[1:14:02] was one of those things where it's not
[1:14:03] going to go away in a day or two it was
[1:14:05] it was i messed up
[1:14:06] and so you know i hear i've got this
[1:14:08] pain in my back and i'm still trying to
[1:14:09] work there
[1:14:10] and i begin to say well lord you're my
[1:14:12] healer i believe you're a healer i
[1:14:13] believe you're a great physician
[1:14:15] i believe in divine healing i believe
[1:14:16] those things and so i begin to
[1:14:18] put that in my mind he's a healer you
[1:14:20] know i believe for my healing i want to
[1:14:21] put
[1:14:22] i want to exercise faith in my healing
[1:14:23] and the way that i did it you know
[1:14:24] brother bill is
[1:14:25] kind of funny how we how we think
[1:14:26] sometimes i begin to think well you know
[1:14:28] maybe uh maybe i'll just hold this faith
[1:14:31] and then like a tingle will go up and
[1:14:32] down my spine and all the pain will just
[1:14:34] sit or maybe it'll be like a warm
[1:14:35] feeling it'll just settle over my shell
[1:14:37] maybe it'll be this or that and then i
[1:14:39] and then i thought what am i doing
[1:14:41] i thought god i don't need to understand
[1:14:43] i don't need to know how you'll do it
[1:14:45] i don't need any control over this i
[1:14:48] just need to believe your word
[1:14:50] i said god i'm just going to forget
[1:14:51] about it i believe and i'm going to go
[1:14:53] about my day about half an hour later i
[1:14:54] hadn't even i didn't even realize it all
[1:14:56] of a sudden i noticed
[1:14:57] hey the pain's gone it's all gone why
[1:14:59] because that's what god doesn't need
[1:15:01] your input
[1:15:01] he doesn't need you to understand it
[1:15:03] that's the way it is not just for
[1:15:05] healing
[1:15:05] for your deliverance for the victory in
[1:15:07] your life to reach the next step of god
[1:15:08] you don't have to know how it's going to
[1:15:10] happen
[1:15:11] you don't have to get it all figured out
[1:15:12] just confess god's word
[1:15:15] it's all that's required of us believe
[1:15:17] it and confess it
[1:15:18] and the high priest will operate upon it
[1:15:21] he will intercede
[1:15:22] hallelujah oh it's easy friends it's
[1:15:24] simple simple faith
[1:15:26] not a great big faith just enough faith
[1:15:28] to believe god's word
[1:15:30] the same amount of faith it takes to
[1:15:32] believe the devil's lie
[1:15:34] amen if you put that faith in god's word
[1:15:36] and simply confess it
[1:15:38] all the power of heaven is behind it
[1:15:41] amen god's word won't fail
[1:15:45] now notice now this and this is not
[1:15:47] psychology brother sister
[1:15:49] this is the message it's the message
[1:15:51] it's not some
[1:15:52] this is not some uh some fanatical thing
[1:15:55] you know some kind of hippie juju
[1:15:57] of positive vibes and you know think
[1:15:59] positively and good things will happen
[1:16:01] in the universal kind of you know
[1:16:02] rearrange or
[1:16:03] anything it's the word of god watch now
[1:16:05] what bro graham said you know that a lot
[1:16:07] of christians get under superstition
[1:16:08] when it comes to faith
[1:16:10] and you know they're you can even get to
[1:16:11] a place where you know a christians like
[1:16:14] they'll go to the doctor and find out
[1:16:15] what you got high blood pressure and
[1:16:16] then
[1:16:17] and then a fear could come on a believer
[1:16:19] you know because uh
[1:16:20] we we believe in the power of confession
[1:16:22] and then you know you go and tell
[1:16:23] somebody well
[1:16:24] you know i got high blood pressure and
[1:16:26] then you get under condemnation
[1:16:27] you know because uh because uh because
[1:16:30] you know you said it you understand what
[1:16:31] i'm saying
[1:16:33] you said it and so now there is a right
[1:16:36] application of that kind of faith like
[1:16:37] the blind man in the barber chair
[1:16:39] you know you just you don't you don't
[1:16:40] talk about the circumstances you just
[1:16:42] say what
[1:16:42] you just speak the word you just speak
[1:16:44] the word of faith now that's right but
[1:16:46] but see people will get a fear on them
[1:16:48] about it
[1:16:49] a fear over confession watch how brother
[1:16:51] brahm deals with that and how can i
[1:16:52] overcome i think this is marvelous
[1:16:54] he said now you know that he's a devil
[1:16:57] you can't say
[1:16:58] i got a sickness and i don't believe it
[1:17:00] is a cygnus brother braham said oh yes
[1:17:02] it is a sickness
[1:17:04] you got cancer you don't believe it is a
[1:17:06] cancer he said it is a cancer
[1:17:08] it is a cancer but remember greater is
[1:17:11] he that's in you
[1:17:12] than he that's in the world he said you
[1:17:14] must realize that the holy spirit that's
[1:17:16] in you has already overcome this thing
[1:17:18] and he's in you and you can overcome by
[1:17:20] him oh doesn't that just take the
[1:17:22] pressure off of you friend
[1:17:23] we're not in denial we're not trying to
[1:17:25] just hold something mentally
[1:17:26] and apply some mental pressure to our
[1:17:28] problems and try to put
[1:17:30] positive vibes out into the universe
[1:17:32] amen we're just believing god's word
[1:17:34] believe that greater is he that's in me
[1:17:36] than what i'm going through
[1:17:37] than what my eyes are telling me then
[1:17:39] what my flesh is feeling greater is he
[1:17:41] that's in me hallelujah oh it's not
[1:17:44] mentally straining brother bram said you
[1:17:46] can't muster up faith
[1:17:48] that's what we try to do sometimes it's
[1:17:49] like it reminds me of uh
[1:17:51] uh the testimony uh the one charismatic
[1:17:54] fellow his name escapes me but he talks
[1:17:56] about brother brandon being first time
[1:17:57] he was in brother brown's meetings and
[1:17:58] somebody came up for prayer and and he
[1:18:01] went up there and
[1:18:02] and you know all the preachers got
[1:18:03] around and brother brown just prayed a
[1:18:04] little simple prayer
[1:18:06] i believe as a blind girl or something
[1:18:07] like that and her eyes came open and the
[1:18:09] guy said well we hadn't even got to
[1:18:10] shouting yet we were a bunch of
[1:18:11] pentecostal we haven't even started
[1:18:13] shouting yet
[1:18:14] she was already healed you see it's not
[1:18:16] what we can apply to the problem
[1:18:18] but it's what what we it's what we speak
[1:18:21] it's what we believe
[1:18:22] it's the law of confession but it's very
[1:18:24] simple and yet it's the thing that trips
[1:18:26] us up so many times it's the
[1:18:28] it's it's it's over and over again the
[1:18:30] the real problem the real root of it in
[1:18:32] our life
[1:18:32] is when we depart from the word of god
[1:18:34] we begin to confess what our eyes are
[1:18:36] telling us
[1:18:37] what our flesh is feeling watch this now
[1:18:39] this is a powerhouse quote
[1:18:42] brother graham said it's not the thought
[1:18:44] as christian science makes it like mind
[1:18:46] over matter
[1:18:46] no that's not it but he said but your
[1:18:49] mind accepts it
[1:18:50] it grasps it and your spirit catches the
[1:18:53] word of god
[1:18:54] and that's the thing that's got life in
[1:18:56] it oh my
[1:18:57] god and then it brings life into you
[1:19:01] the life is not in you not in your
[1:19:04] ability
[1:19:05] not in this world not in the problem
[1:19:08] not in our analysis not in what we think
[1:19:11] about it
[1:19:11] not in our interpretation of it the life
[1:19:14] is in the word
[1:19:15] and when you put your mind when your
[1:19:16] mind when your spirit grasps that word
[1:19:18] then there's a channel to that word and
[1:19:21] life that's in the word
[1:19:22] comes down that channel and brings life
[1:19:23] into you but the life is not in you it's
[1:19:25] in the word
[1:19:26] and all that we have need of is in the
[1:19:28] word of god but what we've got to do is
[1:19:29] speak it
[1:19:30] give it a channel to operate latch hold
[1:19:33] of it hey man
[1:19:34] oh brother he said when life comes down
[1:19:36] that channel into you
[1:19:37] the word of god is manifested in you
[1:19:42] the word is the only channel that has
[1:19:43] life friends what we need to do is cut
[1:19:46] off
[1:19:46] from every other voice what i believe
[1:19:48] about this message i believe that to
[1:19:50] come to this message
[1:19:51] and for this message worked for you all
[1:19:54] of your old denominational ideas have to
[1:19:56] die
[1:19:57] if you didn't come out of a church maybe
[1:19:58] you came out of the world all your
[1:19:59] worldly ideas have to die
[1:20:01] all your thoughts all your background
[1:20:03] all your traditions those things have to
[1:20:05] die
[1:20:06] for the message to work for you because
[1:20:07] the bride has the word she has only the
[1:20:10] word
[1:20:10] amen i'm saying this because this is my
[1:20:12] reality it is my testimony
[1:20:14] it is my everything it's my world amen
[1:20:17] this
[1:20:18] message works amen but but but it's got
[1:20:21] to be everything to you
[1:20:22] amen what i suggest you what i recommend
[1:20:25] brother sister
[1:20:26] is for you to cut off from every
[1:20:28] denominational idea
[1:20:29] from every worldly pleasure from every
[1:20:32] from every
[1:20:33] uh from every political party from every
[1:20:35] pundit from every philosopher
[1:20:37] from every thought leader from every
[1:20:39] influencer from every celebrity
[1:20:41] from anything that is not the word of
[1:20:43] god because the bride has
[1:20:44] only the word and that's why she knows
[1:20:46] what he wants done with the word
[1:20:48] she's not under any other influence but
[1:20:51] her life and her narrative and her
[1:20:53] testimony and her confession
[1:20:55] is fully subject to the word of god and
[1:20:57] nothing but the word
[1:20:59] no book but the bible no law but love
[1:21:03] hallelujah not any other narrative not
[1:21:06] any other agenda not any other spin not
[1:21:08] any other direction
[1:21:09] not any other poll the bride has the
[1:21:12] word
[1:21:12] why do we see message churches becoming
[1:21:15] lukewarm and formal and powerless we see
[1:21:17] we see religious spirits coming in we
[1:21:19] see denominational
[1:21:20] uh spirits working we see so much to be
[1:21:22] discouraged about brother sister
[1:21:23] what it has all come back to somebody
[1:21:25] got dissatisfied with this message
[1:21:27] and wanted to bring in some kind of
[1:21:29] modern theology or bring in a bestseller
[1:21:31] from the bible bookstore or bring some
[1:21:33] other idea or some other lien or some
[1:21:35] other
[1:21:35] some new or some new thing
[1:21:38] amen something outside of the word of
[1:21:40] god but i tell you if you will cling to
[1:21:43] this message
[1:21:44] and make it your absolute and make it
[1:21:45] your everything and make it your
[1:21:47] confession
[1:21:48] i i will promise you it will work for
[1:21:50] you
[1:21:51] i have a right to promise it to you
[1:21:53] because god's word promised it first
[1:21:55] amen oh there's life in it it will
[1:21:57] vindicate itself
[1:21:58] the life will be manifested in you when
[1:22:00] you believe it
[1:22:01] and give it a chance to work in your
[1:22:03] life and make it your confession make it
[1:22:04] your reality
[1:22:06] make it your everything it's the only
[1:22:10] channel that has
[1:22:12] life amen why is there all this why are
[1:22:14] all these things we look around we see
[1:22:16] so much to be discouraged about
[1:22:18] uh physically speaking through what our
[1:22:19] eyes are seeing people falling away
[1:22:21] critics rising up this and that church
[1:22:23] is falling apart formal spirit formality
[1:22:25] the holy spirit
[1:22:26] uh the movie and spirit departing from
[1:22:28] the church all those kind of different
[1:22:30] things that we look when we see around
[1:22:31] the world
[1:22:32] amen amen but what what what brings that
[1:22:35] formal spirit
[1:22:37] what makes a church formal we think that
[1:22:40] formal is
[1:22:42] you know when you're quiet and starchy
[1:22:44] and nobody says amen that's formal
[1:22:46] that's formal well you know that most
[1:22:47] the time when brother brown is preaching
[1:22:48] about
[1:22:49] formalism he's preaching to pentecostals
[1:22:52] he's preaching to the pentecostal church
[1:22:55] formal's not what we think it is brother
[1:22:56] sister
[1:22:57] formal is normal
[1:23:01] let that sink in for a minute formal
[1:23:05] is normal when we think that we're just
[1:23:08] gonna
[1:23:08] live our life the way we always have
[1:23:10] we're gonna
[1:23:11] attend church the way we would sing the
[1:23:13] way we always have preach the way we
[1:23:15] always have
[1:23:15] all those kind of then then then somehow
[1:23:18] you know
[1:23:20] or or in your personal life you just go
[1:23:22] on just the way you always have
[1:23:24] treat church the way you always have ta
[1:23:27] treat as
[1:23:28] it's just a tradition it's what you do
[1:23:30] it's just it's just normal
[1:23:32] normal is the enemy of progress normal
[1:23:34] is the enemy of deliverance normal
[1:23:36] is the enemy of revival amen when you do
[1:23:39] this when we do the same things and have
[1:23:40] the same attitude and the same
[1:23:42] confession the same testimony amen the
[1:23:45] same narrative and then expect things to
[1:23:47] change
[1:23:48] expect things get better the devil will
[1:23:50] have the devil have a playground with
[1:23:52] that
[1:23:53] amen the devil loves normal i i uh some
[1:23:56] things in my heart
[1:23:57] this morning say god don't ever let me
[1:23:59] be guilty of being a normal christian
[1:24:01] i'm not looking for normal christianity
[1:24:03] i don't want to be a normal preacher
[1:24:04] i don't want to worship normal sing
[1:24:06] normal i don't want to get caught in a
[1:24:08] rut
[1:24:08] of what is normal to me but god i want
[1:24:11] to every day
[1:24:12] die more to my own thinking and and more
[1:24:14] and more
[1:24:15] because just perfectly confess your word
[1:24:17] i want my testimony i want my life i
[1:24:19] want the whole narrative of the story of
[1:24:21] my life
[1:24:22] to be your word oh lord because i know
[1:24:24] that the only way that i'll soar higher
[1:24:26] with you
[1:24:27] is to set my wings to the word of god
[1:24:29] amen and let the holy spirit blow across
[1:24:32] that
[1:24:32] and lift me up out of the mess that i'm
[1:24:34] in friends you want to soar
[1:24:36] amen who wants to soar with me i want to
[1:24:38] sort of new heights
[1:24:40] amen i i want i want more oh we've had
[1:24:42] revival in the church but we can have
[1:24:44] more
[1:24:45] amen god's done great things in our
[1:24:46] midst but we could see more
[1:24:48] we've got this one marvelous revelation
[1:24:50] of the message of the hour but we could
[1:24:52] have more light
[1:24:53] more of a walk with god more reality
[1:24:55] more power
[1:24:57] we could have it amen but not if we
[1:25:00] don't speak it
[1:25:02] not if we're not willing to change our
[1:25:05] confession
[1:25:06] the church won't go any higher i skipped
[1:25:08] the quote earlier but it's perfect for
[1:25:09] this moment
[1:25:10] brother brown said any man will never
[1:25:12] live any higher or any farther than what
[1:25:14] he thinks
[1:25:15] he's living what he believes what his
[1:25:17] confession is
[1:25:18] you'll never get any higher than than
[1:25:20] what
[1:25:21] you believe you're living so if you so
[1:25:24] if you're if your walk with god is well
[1:25:26] you know i go to church on sunday
[1:25:28] and then monday tuesday wednesday i do
[1:25:29] my own thing i go to midweek service
[1:25:31] i sing the songs i like the songs i
[1:25:33] listen to my pastor preach i like my
[1:25:35] pastor i pay my tithes
[1:25:37] i have my daily devo i have all those
[1:25:38] things but it's just
[1:25:41] it's just a normal experience maybe it's
[1:25:43] a social gathering to you maybe
[1:25:45] maybe maybe the message is just you know
[1:25:47] it's what we believe because it's what
[1:25:48] mama and daddy believed
[1:25:50] amen oh friends because it's what that's
[1:25:52] what they preach at our church
[1:25:56] i don't want to be guilty i don't want
[1:25:58] to be formal
[1:25:59] i don't want to be normal you say don't
[1:26:01] worry brother nathan
[1:26:03] hallelujah but the church won't go any
[1:26:06] higher without a new narrative watch
[1:26:07] what brother graham said at kadesh
[1:26:08] barnea now in catus barney he's
[1:26:09] preaching about
[1:26:10] you know uh how people uh uh he's
[1:26:12] preaching about their caters barney
[1:26:14] where they're making the decision do we
[1:26:15] go over the land do we not so they're
[1:26:16] caught between two opinions and
[1:26:17] he's so he's talking about people
[1:26:19] halting in a season of change when god
[1:26:21] is doing the work when god's
[1:26:22] when god's making a move when god is
[1:26:24] when god's changing lives
[1:26:26] but but the people begin to halt they
[1:26:28] begin to get caught between two
[1:26:30] directions he said why are you halting
[1:26:31] between two opinions
[1:26:33] why isn't the church on fire why isn't
[1:26:35] the place packed out with people why
[1:26:36] aren't great signs and wonders done
[1:26:38] don't lay it on the pastor it's you
[1:26:42] he said we've got a mixed multitude
[1:26:44] one's pulling this way
[1:26:45] and one the other but you've got to come
[1:26:47] to a time of decision
[1:26:49] what are you going to do brother he said
[1:26:51] god's put the responsibility
[1:26:53] upon you friends and that's what we get
[1:26:55] in a church many times
[1:26:57] when god has anointed a pastor and the
[1:26:59] pastor's bringing the leadership to the
[1:27:00] church and god just puts it on his heart
[1:27:02] here's the direction we're going to go
[1:27:03] this is the way we're going to do this
[1:27:04] is the order of it how we're going to do
[1:27:06] it and then but you've got one
[1:27:07] one wants to go this way and one wants
[1:27:09] to go that way and one's listening to
[1:27:10] that voice and one's listening to that
[1:27:12] voice and they're both pulling on both
[1:27:13] sides
[1:27:14] amen and you get if you ever get that in
[1:27:16] a church where one's going that way
[1:27:17] one's going that way that's why we don't
[1:27:18] get anywhere
[1:27:19] what we've got to do brother sister is
[1:27:21] get with the narrative amen trust in the
[1:27:23] leadership god's given you
[1:27:24] amen and get with the narrative of the
[1:27:26] word that's the most important thing
[1:27:28] all the nonsense of this of this mortal
[1:27:31] life and the things that we go through
[1:27:33] in politics and and in daily living and
[1:27:35] all those kind of things that has no
[1:27:37] bearing on the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:39] amen but what we're after is that word
[1:27:41] amen that word
[1:27:42] amen the word that's speaking through
[1:27:44] your pastor the word that speaketh
[1:27:45] through a prophet
[1:27:46] amen latch hold of that word and get in
[1:27:48] with it get with the narrative of it
[1:27:50] don't just let it wash over you you
[1:27:52] speak it you begin to push
[1:27:54] don't pull get behind and push and when
[1:27:57] we get the whole church
[1:27:58] excited about the word of god confessing
[1:28:01] the word of god
[1:28:01] get getting with the narrative until it
[1:28:04] becomes more important than your opinion
[1:28:06] more important than the direction you
[1:28:07] wanted it to go what is important to you
[1:28:10] is let me get with the narrative what
[1:28:11] the holy spirit is leading my church
[1:28:13] and then we can get somewhere and we can
[1:28:15] see revival like we never had
[1:28:17] then we could see young people be you
[1:28:18] know god has just done something
[1:28:20] sovereign in our church
[1:28:21] just in these last two months we've had
[1:28:22] 11 young people receive the baptism of
[1:28:24] the holy ghost
[1:28:25] just the sovereign grace of god amen god
[1:28:27] is moving friends
[1:28:29] amen the bride has a revival the move is
[1:28:31] on for the bride
[1:28:32] we know that there's a move but you got
[1:28:34] to move with it
[1:28:36] you got to get behind it amen you got to
[1:28:39] support it we all do
[1:28:40] amen in our local church in the message
[1:28:43] in the bride body around the world in
[1:28:44] our individual life
[1:28:46] we've got to get with the narrative of
[1:28:47] god's word
[1:28:49] hallelujah he said god's word said we
[1:28:51] can have a revival
[1:28:53] he said god's word said he would raise
[1:28:54] up in the last days and do signs and
[1:28:55] wonders and he's done it he said the
[1:28:57] thing that we've got to do
[1:28:58] is just get together and start the
[1:29:00] revival oh friends the word spoken
[1:29:02] let's get with that narrative amen we
[1:29:05] read there about how on the road to
[1:29:06] emmaus
[1:29:08] jesus comes and walks with those
[1:29:09] disciples and here are those disciples
[1:29:12] uh those they were believers these were
[1:29:15] disciples they were they were believers
[1:29:17] of jesus message
[1:29:19] but the problem that they had was wasn't
[1:29:21] that
[1:29:22] a lack of faith it wasn't that they
[1:29:23] weren't sincere wasn't that they didn't
[1:29:25] believe
[1:29:26] but they were their perspective was
[1:29:27] wrong
[1:29:29] amen because all that they knew about
[1:29:31] was all the
[1:29:32] horrible things that happened on good
[1:29:34] friday they didn't know good friday was
[1:29:36] good yet
[1:29:38] amen because they saw the dark they saw
[1:29:40] the crucifixion they saw those dark
[1:29:42] clouds they looked around saw the
[1:29:44] darkness they felt those earthquakes
[1:29:45] they felt that instability and that's
[1:29:47] all that they had on their mind because
[1:29:48] that's what they were looking at that
[1:29:50] was their whole narrative
[1:29:51] and and when they were looking at that
[1:29:52] they couldn't even see jesus christ
[1:29:54] walking down the road with them
[1:29:56] they couldn't even recognize his
[1:29:57] presence because they their narrative
[1:29:59] their perspective was wrong
[1:30:00] and so they began to they're just
[1:30:02] walking with him and they're complaining
[1:30:03] you know didn't you hear that about the
[1:30:05] earthquake it didn't you see the
[1:30:07] darkness
[1:30:08] didn't you hear about that church fell
[1:30:09] apart and that that pastor
[1:30:11] walked away and backslid and didn't you
[1:30:13] hear about this and that
[1:30:14] jesus just kind of talked to him he
[1:30:16] begins to explain the word he said yeah
[1:30:17] but but you know the bible said
[1:30:19] he begins to take the old he takes the
[1:30:21] prophets he begins to deal with him he
[1:30:22] said you know the bible said there'd be
[1:30:24] a great falling away
[1:30:25] amen the bible said there'd be false
[1:30:26] anointed ones the bible said there'd be
[1:30:28] darkness and earthquakes and there'd be
[1:30:30] all those things
[1:30:30] and he begins what's he doing he's
[1:30:32] beginning to change their narrative amen
[1:30:33] he's beginning to change their
[1:30:34] perspective on the things that were
[1:30:36] happening
[1:30:36] and then what does he do he comes in
[1:30:37] amen and that personal presence of jesus
[1:30:40] opens the eyes of the believer when you
[1:30:42] realize that he's present in your life
[1:30:43] you realize that he's not forsaking you
[1:30:45] he's not angry at you
[1:30:46] he's not kicking you away because you
[1:30:48] made a mistake but he's with you and
[1:30:49] he's in you
[1:30:50] and he begins to fellowship with you and
[1:30:52] break the and what is he trying to do
[1:30:53] take your eyes off the storm take your
[1:30:56] eyes off the earth's place
[1:30:57] take your eyes off the darkness amen and
[1:31:00] begin to think about the word
[1:31:02] amen begin to think about the word he he
[1:31:04] changed their narrative
[1:31:05] amen he reveals his presence and oh
[1:31:08] that's what we have friends we know that
[1:31:09] we have his presence we know
[1:31:11] we know that he's here amongst the bride
[1:31:13] of jesus christ he's he's appeared to us
[1:31:15] he's revealed himself to us he's present
[1:31:17] amongst us
[1:31:18] so we're not looking at what's happening
[1:31:19] out here in the world our narrative is
[1:31:21] the word
[1:31:23] our perspective is the word and that's
[1:31:25] what gives us that good news gospel
[1:31:27] amen oh here they're all they're all
[1:31:29] they're stuck in good friday
[1:31:30] they didn't even they didn't know the

[1:31:46] been through but it's easter friends
[1:31:48] you know you don't know it but it's
[1:31:49] easter amen and you're looking at the
[1:31:52] wrong things
[1:31:53] because you're looking at all the misery
[1:31:54] in your life and the misery in the world
[1:31:56] when jesus is walking with you
[1:31:59] easter's here it's the rising of the sun
[1:32:03] the revelation of his presence changes
[1:32:05] the perspective last time i was here i
[1:32:07] preached on that prince of peace
[1:32:08] there's the disciples tossed on stormy
[1:32:10] seas and they're tossing those waves and
[1:32:12] they were so discouraged because
[1:32:13] what they expected they were seeing
[1:32:16] because they thought that jesus would
[1:32:18] come
[1:32:18] he'd overthrow the roman rule he'd bring
[1:32:20] peace to the whole world he'd be this
[1:32:21] great shining empire
[1:32:22] and all those things and there was no
[1:32:24] peace in jerusalem there was no peace
[1:32:26] in rome there wasn't even peace on that
[1:32:27] boat
[1:32:29] but the prince of peace was in the boat
[1:32:31] and when they recognized his presence
[1:32:34] amen it changed the narrative it changed
[1:32:36] their perspective
[1:32:37] amen and our prince of peace has brought
[1:32:39] us a shalom
[1:32:40] you know brother graham preached that
[1:32:41] message shalom and that was his message
[1:32:43] to the bride
[1:32:44] it was not to bring us worry but bring
[1:32:46] us peace amen to change our narrative
[1:32:48] change our perspective as
[1:32:49] but you know brother brown sits there
[1:32:50] and he goes there in sierra vista and he
[1:32:52] begins to break open shalom and he's
[1:32:54] preaching and he talks about the
[1:32:55] darkness that's on the earth
[1:32:56] and he talks about gross darkness that's
[1:32:58] on the people and all these dark things
[1:33:00] and wickedness
[1:33:01] and all the horrible things going on in
[1:33:02] the world and he's talking about those
[1:33:03] things
[1:33:04] and then he must have discerned
[1:33:05] something that was happening in the
[1:33:06] minds of the people because he stops
[1:33:08] right in the middle and he says listen
[1:33:09] now
[1:33:10] he says i'm only showing you the
[1:33:11] darkness to get to the light
[1:33:14] to get to the light and he's told the
[1:33:15] bride of jesus christ he said
[1:33:17] the reason he said the reason we feel
[1:33:19] that pressing of the darkness
[1:33:21] is because there's a light that's
[1:33:22] pressing out they said the
[1:33:24] the reason that darkness is weighing so
[1:33:26] heavy on us is because the the light is
[1:33:28] pressing again that's why he said it's
[1:33:29] always darkest just before the dawn
[1:33:31] because that light begins to press and
[1:33:34] congeal that darkness friends
[1:33:35] if it's the darkest day of your life
[1:33:37] today amen that that
[1:33:39] that's just more proof that there is a
[1:33:41] light amen and you can have a peace you
[1:33:43] can have a shalom
[1:33:44] but we got to take our eyes off all the
[1:33:46] negativity and all the things going on
[1:33:48] around the world
[1:33:49] and even around the message forget about
[1:33:52] those things that's not our narrative
[1:33:54] that's not our gospel
[1:33:55] it's not our perspective easter changed
[1:33:59] the narrative
[1:34:00] amen it's the rising of the sun the
[1:34:02] darkness is banished you might be in the
[1:34:04] valley of the shadow of death but the
[1:34:05] shadow only proves there's a light
[1:34:06] that's with you
[1:34:08] step out from behind that rock amen get
[1:34:10] into the sun
[1:34:12] lay in the message let it ripen you let
[1:34:14] it let it bring sunshine to your life
[1:34:16] let it change your confession from
[1:34:17] misery to joy don't look at the
[1:34:19] political realm don't look at the
[1:34:21] worldly sin
[1:34:21] don't look at those things all of it is
[1:34:24] is unstability
[1:34:25] it's satan's eden it's all falling apart
[1:34:27] and all of it is only dark to prove that
[1:34:29] you have the light what we need friends
[1:34:33] amen it's somebody that will take this
[1:34:35] message and not just believe it but
[1:34:36] speak it
[1:34:37] brother man said what we need is
[1:34:39] thousands of lived
[1:34:41] voices amen not just somebody who'll
[1:34:43] just pay lip service
[1:34:44] but somebody who will live a life and
[1:34:47] have a testimony and have a confession
[1:34:49] that this message is the truth then he
[1:34:51] said you know what that would be
[1:34:53] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:34:55] amen so then when you've got that
[1:34:56] thunder in you friends
[1:34:58] and you're tossed on the storm like
[1:34:59] those disciples and things aren't going
[1:35:01] the way that you expected
[1:35:03] and there's disappointments and you're
[1:35:04] upset with god and you can't understand
[1:35:06] why everything's happening
[1:35:08] but then that thunder begins to roll
[1:35:09] amen and the darkness of this world
[1:35:11] sweeps over
[1:35:12] and you feel that cold rain in your face
[1:35:14] i'll tell you what you do
[1:35:15] thunderback amen we got to thunder back
[1:35:18] when the darkness pushes on you let that
[1:35:21] light rise up in the inside and push out
[1:35:24] amen when the earthquakes come and the
[1:35:26] darkness come
[1:35:27] amen we know that our easter we know
[1:35:29] that our resurrection is at hand
[1:35:32] glory be to god let's stand amen let's
[1:35:35] stand

[1:35:42] somebody here today would raise your
[1:35:43] hand
