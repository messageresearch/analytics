[33:14] where this is that I need to move it
[33:16] down a little bit we okay okay just give
[33:21] you a little testimony while you're
[33:23] sitting down on Thursday you know
[33:27] brother Sam contacted me to come preach
[33:30] and and I just felt in my heart
[33:32] immediately that you know I wanted to
[33:35] come and help him out and speak to you
[33:37] all and I don't remember what day we
[33:40] talked but Thursday night I think I got
[33:42] a little touch of food poisoning and I
[33:44] mean it just tore me up and I was up you
[33:47] know one thirty to five just pacing I
[33:49] was just so sick and I I made a little
[33:55] maybe I maybe I got to be balanced out
[33:58] on it but but the John la Fontaine the
[34:01] Sunday that he ministered was the last
[34:05] time we heard from him and that was
[34:08] actually I was supposed to preach that
[34:09] Sunday but I got sick on that that
[34:12] Saturday and my voice was in and out and
[34:14] so I said brother John I said it I know
[34:17] you're preparing for Wednesday night
[34:18] would you take Sunday for me and I'll
[34:20] take your Wednesday and he said well yes
[34:23] sure brother that's fine well I didn't
[34:24] realize he was he was feeling a little
[34:26] bad and what we come to believe far as
[34:32] we know was that you know he was having
[34:34] a heart attack right at that time and so
[34:39] I looked at a man who paved the way
[34:44] through preaching the gospel and he got
[34:49] up and through a heart attack he could
[34:51] preach and so I believe I'm just
[34:55] trusting I told him I might saw him in
[34:58] the hospital I think it was Wednesday
[35:01] when he went in I can't remember and I
[35:03] said brother John I said I'm looking at
[35:04] this two ways I said either I put you
[35:08] here
[35:09] whorehouse that God knew that you needed
[35:11] to speak one more time and I said I'm
[35:14] just trusting in that and so I kind of
[35:18] made a little commitment there I thought
[35:20] you know what did these brothers do
[35:21] before they had someone else they could
[35:23] lean on they preached whether they were
[35:26] sick or not
[35:27] so I said God I just I believe if I'm
[35:30] wrong then then you changed the
[35:32] situation but I believe that you want me
[35:34] to go preach to those peoples so touch
[35:36] me so Thursday Thursday night Friday
[35:39] morning I mean I was just so sick doing
[35:42] a little bit better I'm trying to
[35:44] remember what night it was I think it
[35:47] was Friday Friday night I woke up about
[35:49] one of 12 12:30 and again I was just I
[35:53] wasn't just sick to my stomach and I and
[35:56] I thought lord I I need a touch from you
[35:58] and I just just kind of felt in my heart
[36:00] I thought you know if I knelt down at my
[36:02] bedside I'd feel better
[36:03] so I knelt down and I got to thinking
[36:06] about it and I thought you know my
[36:08] grandfather sent me a prayer cloth that
[36:10] the Prophet prayed over when he was
[36:12] preaching the the seven seals and said
[36:16] I'm gonna go get my Bible and I'm gonna
[36:18] get that prayer cloth so I laid my Bible
[36:20] open to acts 19 that's the scripture
[36:23] that says that they took
[36:25] cloths off of Paul's body and they laid
[36:27] it on the sick devils were cast out the
[36:30] sick were raised and I took that prayer
[36:32] cloth and I just held it on my stomach
[36:34] where it was hurting and I held and I
[36:36] just I just leant over on my Bible and I
[36:38] just rested my face on my Bible and I
[36:40] prayed and I said God I just I'm
[36:42] trusting in your word I have nothing
[36:43] else here I just I'm so sick I can't do
[36:46] nothing well this might sound funny you
[36:49] might be me a fanatic I don't know but
[36:51] my wife laughed at me a little bit but I
[36:55] remembered a testimony brother Perry
[36:57] Greene told and he said there was a man
[36:59] and he had stomach trouble and the way
[37:01] that they cut these prayer cloths they
[37:03] cut it with it differently and it just
[37:05] frayed a little bit on the end and so
[37:06] the brother that was having the stomach
[37:09] trouble said can I just have one of
[37:10] those threads and he said well sure and
[37:13] he gave it to him and he ate it and so I
[37:15] held I held this prayer cloth up in the
[37:17] moonlight and I saw a thread sticking
[37:19] out and so I grabbed this thing and I
[37:21] died
[37:23] and I'll tell you what I don't know at
[37:27] what point it was shortly after and I'm
[37:30] not and you know I mean I'm just
[37:32] applying Scripture any way that I can
[37:33] and I tell you that stomachache left me
[37:44] call me a fanatic freaking appease the
[37:46] prayer cloth but I heard a testimony and
[37:49] I thought God if you can do it for him
[37:51] I'm gonna claim it too amen so we're
[37:56] just trusting in the Lord this morning
[37:59] I've just I've just been a little you
[38:02] know there's there's been a lot of death
[38:04] around us lately as believers brother
[38:07] John and and you all brother browning
[38:10] and you know this this young sister is
[38:14] it Liliana Liliana and I don't know if
[38:18] she went here I don't know how how close
[38:21] I don't know the situation but you know
[38:24] I was talking to my grandfather's almost
[38:26] almost 90 and it just kind of hit me he
[38:29] said you know Sonny said I'm hoping the
[38:31] family's coming out and he lives down in
[38:33] Texas said the family's coming out in
[38:35] April and he said I just like to see
[38:38] everybody before the Lord takes me home
[38:40] and that just kind of hit me and I
[38:42] thought well pop I said I'm gonna I'm
[38:45] gonna come out and see you but I'm gonna
[38:46] be a little selfish I'm gonna do it
[38:48] after everyone else leaves because I
[38:49] want you to myself because I can't tell
[38:51] you the last time I seen him and he's
[38:53] just a great prayer warrior for us so
[38:55] this has been on my heart a little bit I
[38:58] was actually going to go a different way
[39:00] and yesterday and study the Lord took me
[39:02] this way so I feel a little bit
[39:05] unprepared
[39:06] I haven't preached this before so but
[39:11] coming in here after you all worshiping
[39:13] I just feel like if I can't preach in
[39:16] this atmosphere then I need to hang it
[39:19] up
[39:22] if you would stand for the reading of
[39:25] the word if you would open up the
[39:29] scripture to first Corinthians 15 first
[39:37] Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 49 and
[39:41] I bring you greetings from pastor Paul
[39:45] and the local assembly back home and I
[39:50] just trust that this will be a blessing
[39:53] to you today 1st Corinthians 15 49 and
[39:57] as if we have borne the image of the
[40:00] earthly we shall also bear the image of
[40:02] the heavenly now this I say brethren
[40:05] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[40:07] kingdom of God neither doth corruption
[40:09] inherit incorruption behold I show you a
[40:13] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[40:15] shall be changed in a moment in the
[40:17] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[40:20] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[40:23] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[40:25] shall be changed for this corruptible
[40:28] must put on incorruption and this mortal
[40:32] must put on immortality so when this
[40:36] corruption shall have put on
[40:37] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[40:39] on immortality then shall be brought to
[40:44] pass the saying that is written death is
[40:46] swallowed up in victory and then the
[40:49] great words that we know Oh death where
[40:51] is thy sting o grave where is thy
[40:54] victory the sting of death is sin the
[40:57] strength of sin is the law but thinks be
[40:59] to God which giveth us the victory
[41:01] through our Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[41:05] if you would 1st Thessalonians 4
[41:22] first Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse
[41:24] 13 but I would not have you to be
[41:31] ignorant brethren concerning them which
[41:33] are asleep that you sorrow not even as
[41:37] others which have no hope for if we
[41:40] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[41:42] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[41:45] will God bring with him for this we say
[41:48] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[41:51] which are alive and remain unto the
[41:53] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[41:54] them which are asleep for the Lord
[41:57] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[41:59] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[42:01] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[42:03] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[42:06] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[42:08] together with them in the clouds to meet
[42:10] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[42:13] be with the Lord wherefore comfort one
[42:16] another with these words
[42:18] amen let's pray Lord Jesus we come
[42:22] before you God and Lord I'm just
[42:25] submitting myself to you once more Lord
[42:29] I might feel within myself God and
[42:32] capable or whatever it might be but Lord
[42:35] if you just help me get out of the way
[42:37] God and let you speak Lord then we'll
[42:40] know God that we're seated in heavenly
[42:42] places
[42:42] we'll know God that we can walk away
[42:45] father with encouragement or correction
[42:48] or whatever you'd have father I just ask
[42:51] Lord that you be the preacher this
[42:53] morning can I pray for brother Sam Lord
[42:57] it's one thing it's a hard thing to lose
[43:02] someone who's older in life but Lord to
[43:05] lose somebody who's so young and to
[43:09] preach that funeral Lord it's Lord is
[43:12] just some things are hard to understand
[43:15] bless your people now bless brother Sam
[43:17] bless the funeral in Jesus name Amen
[43:20] amen you can be seated
[43:30] again I don't know you know the full
[43:33] situation where where our young sister
[43:37] went to church and things but I just
[43:39] thought that I might be able to come and
[43:41] minister to you today because regardless
[43:45] of whether its family or or whether they
[43:47] went to our church or you know you you
[43:49] know the family because a lot of them
[43:51] come here but a lot of times our hearts
[43:54] break with them and and it's it's just
[43:58] it's just too difficult to understand
[44:00] it's just too hard I'm just realizing I
[44:04] forgot a piece of paper I wanted to read
[44:05] you but that's okay you know there's
[44:09] another situation that we know of some
[44:11] friends of ours that we go to church
[44:12] with their family down south I don't I
[44:17] don't know well it's what's what's their
[44:20] last name I can't think of it right now
[44:22] you might know him but they they had a
[44:26] child it was a boy it'd be their first
[44:28] boy and it was just a couple hours old
[44:31] and and it it was born too soon and and
[44:35] the baby passed and so she she just
[44:38] wrote a beautiful testimony just just so
[44:40] beautifully written and and you know you
[44:44] could come back and and I believe it was
[44:46] job that said though you slay me yet
[44:47] I'll trust you and sometimes in these
[44:50] situations that's the only thing that we
[44:52] can fall back on is Lord though you slay
[44:54] me I'm gonna trust you because we can't
[44:57] listen we're in we're in time we're in
[45:01] we're in we're in this light in this
[45:03] matter we can't understand the bigger
[45:05] picture because we can't see the bigger
[45:07] picture but you never know what would
[45:09] have come down the road for for one of
[45:11] these little ones are for for one of the
[45:13] older ones you know I mean you just we
[45:15] believe that God is a healer of the sick
[45:17] that doesn't change God can heal the
[45:20] sick and if you don't believe that I
[45:21] just asked you to go getting the word a
[45:23] little bit longer and ask God to change
[45:25] your heart and reveal that to you
[45:27] because God does heal the sick I
[45:29] testified of it this morning I'm telling
[45:31] you my stomach was just in all kinds of
[45:34] trouble but God came down on the scene
[45:36] by his word
[45:38] and and and by faith in his word I was
[45:41] healed
[45:42] and you can receive your healing this
[45:44] morning you don't have to come up for
[45:46] prayer you can receive your healing
[45:47] while the word goes forth all you have
[45:49] to do is believe it all you got to do is
[45:52] claim it as your own that's it that
[45:54] settles it amen
[45:55] regardless of what the circumstances
[45:57] look like regardless of what symptoms
[45:59] you feel if you'll cling to the Word of
[46:01] God that thing has to leave you brother
[46:05] John la Fontaine was was he said and I'm
[46:08] claiming it - he was a stage 4 cancer
[46:10] survivor that's how he said it I'm a
[46:12] stage 4 cancer survivor you know sister
[46:15] sherry told me she said cancer couldn't
[46:17] take my daddy because he claimed that he
[46:20] was a stage 4 cancer survivor the Lord
[46:24] chose to take him by another way we
[46:26] don't know why the Lord took him we
[46:28] believe that the Lord could have raised
[46:30] him up I believe that even under the
[46:32] influence of medical anesthesia that God
[46:34] could have raised him up out of that bed
[46:35] without the doctors backing off the
[46:38] anesthesia I just believe God's that big
[46:40] God because one day he stood at the
[46:42] graves of Lazarus and he said Lazarus
[46:44] come forth and that was after four days
[46:47] when corruption had set in and Lazarus
[46:50] came forth out of the grave he had to
[46:53] rise up because that was the word of the
[46:55] Lord Jesus so I believe the word of God
[46:59] but oftentimes we just have to have just
[47:02] as much faith as you apply towards God
[47:05] raising somebody up from being sick or
[47:08] raising them up from the dead you have
[47:09] to apply the same amount of faith if the
[47:13] Lord chooses to take them because
[47:15] there's a much greater picture I don't I
[47:17] don't you know I hope this is okay but
[47:20] this is just how I've been thinking
[47:21] about it you know our our little sister
[47:24] Liliana or this this couple that lost
[47:26] the baby just just hours old or minutes
[47:29] I think
[47:31] you never know that the the the family
[47:34] the dad's the dad's a logger the
[47:36] family's into farming you have no idea
[47:38] what would have happened maybe that
[47:40] little boy would have had an accident
[47:41] down the road that would have tore him
[47:43] up and it would have been much worse off
[47:45] to see him in that state than to see him
[47:48] pass just just a couple minutes old
[47:50] maybe listen
[47:51] I I hope this is okay I'm just I'm just
[47:55] trying to help you see a bigger picture
[47:57] here what if our little sister Liliana
[47:59] what if what if what if something bad
[48:01] would have happened to her down the road
[48:03] what if some man would have come in with
[48:05] ill intention and and and would have got
[48:08] her off to herself or something we don't
[48:10] like to think that way but listen you
[48:12] got to apply your faith just as much
[48:14] that God is a big God he knows the end
[48:17] from the beginning and he knew that
[48:20] right now was the best time for sister
[48:22] Liliana to come home
[48:24] is this okay this morning is it okay if
[48:26] we talk about this I just I just trust
[48:29] us so minister to you
[48:31] Hebrews 13 14 you know I often wonder
[48:34] people I think sometimes they would
[48:36] question well why do we have sickness
[48:38] why do we have death well there was a
[48:40] fall in the beginning in the Garden of
[48:43] Eden Satan came in and he injected his
[48:46] his his plan into God's plan he
[48:48] perverted God's plan and and and the
[48:52] wages of sin is death so where does
[48:56] death come from death comes from sin sin
[48:59] entered the world and therefore
[49:00] interrupted eternal life it brought time
[49:03] into the picture all of that for a
[49:05] bigger plan right but but here Hebrews
[49:10] 13 14 says for here we have no
[49:12] continuing City but we seek one to come
[49:15] so as believers we know that death is a
[49:18] part of this life we don't know if we'll
[49:21] see it we believe that that one day in
[49:25] the moment and in the twinkling of an
[49:26] eye that we shall be changed and that we
[49:29] won't see death but but the fact of the
[49:31] matter is some of us are going to see
[49:33] death some of us have seen death right I
[49:37] mean we lost loved ones and things
[49:38] that's just that's just the reality of
[49:40] what we're living in until until that
[49:43] wonderful day that we're looking forward
[49:45] to
[49:48] here on this earth were not promised
[49:50] tomorrow we're not promised life eternal
[49:54] why we are here on this earth in the
[49:57] shape that it's in and and understand
[49:59] that when you receive the baptism of the
[50:02] Holy Ghost you receive eternal life but
[50:04] I'm talking one day if God doesn't come
[50:07] in your lifetime you're gonna taste
[50:09] death with the Holy Ghost with eternal
[50:12] life right but you understand what I'm
[50:15] saying eternal life
[50:16] this isn't God's we're not back to God's
[50:18] eating yet eternal life doesn't exist on
[50:21] this world in the state that it's in in
[50:25] fact it can the Prophet taught us that
[50:28] that there's this is Satan's Eden this
[50:32] God God cannot come and dwell in this
[50:34] state and really when you receive the
[50:36] Holy Ghost you can't stay in this state
[50:39] why why then does a believer die because
[50:42] you can't stay here because this is not
[50:45] your Eden yet this is Satan's Eden you
[50:49] can't live in this in the state that
[50:51] it's in you you can't stay and sin
[50:53] forever when you have God in you in fact
[51:04] we're promised in the scripture that
[51:06] we're gonna experience death we're gonna
[51:09] experience sorrow but we're also
[51:12] promised that we'll be comforted Matthew
[51:15] 5:4 says blessed are they that mourn for
[51:17] they shall be comforted
[51:19] so pray for the family pray for the ones
[51:22] who have lost loved ones don't don't
[51:25] sister browning I hope you don't mind me
[51:27] saying don't quit praying for sister
[51:28] browning and in your pastor because when
[51:31] holidays and birthdays and things come
[51:33] along come along it all that pain it can
[51:35] be it could be a day of the year it
[51:38] could be a smell it could be a song it
[51:41] could be anything and it triggers the
[51:43] memory and and oh the pain it brings but
[51:47] the Bible says that blessed are they who
[51:49] mourn for they shall be comforted it
[51:54] please yes these three three verse one
[51:57] to everything there is a season and a
[51:59] time to every purpose under
[52:00] heaven a time to be born and a time to
[52:03] die a time to plant and a time to be
[52:06] plucked up that which is planted a time
[52:08] to weep and a time to laugh a time to
[52:10] mourn and a time to dance a time to cast
[52:12] away stones and a time to gather stones
[52:14] together a time to embrace and a time to
[52:17] refrain from embracing a time to get and
[52:20] a time to lose a time to keep and a time
[52:23] to cast away when I read that I thought
[52:26] you know it's a time to get to gain a
[52:28] loved one it's a time to gain a
[52:29] relationship and then there's a time to
[52:31] let it go to let God take him a time to
[52:37] ran into time to sow a time to keep
[52:39] silent in the time to speak a time to
[52:42] love and a time to hate a time of war
[52:43] and a time of peace to everything there
[52:47] is a season and a time and a purpose
[52:52] notice I just noticed that in the
[52:54] scripture and a time to every purpose
[52:56] under heaven
[52:57] everything has a purpose and listen as
[53:01] believers as believers that's where we
[53:06] rest that's where we find joy that's
[53:09] where you're fine that's where in in the
[53:11] midst of loss in the midst of a funeral
[53:14] going on today you could come here this
[53:16] morning and you could worship from the
[53:17] depths of your soul because as believers
[53:20] you realize that there's a purpose you
[53:21] may not know that purpose and you may
[53:23] not understand it but you know that
[53:25] there's a purpose Paul tells us in 1st
[53:30] Thessalonians that he doesn't want us to
[53:32] be ignorant he says don't be ignorant
[53:35] brethren and mourn as those who don't
[53:38] have a hope so listen it's okay to mourn
[53:42] it's okay to mourn
[53:44] he just said Paul said it's okay to
[53:46] mourn but listen I don't want you to be
[53:49] ignorant don't don't mourn as those that
[53:52] don't have a hope because that morning I
[53:55] can tell you I've been close to people I
[53:57] i we have family members who don't who
[53:59] don't believe in God and when they mourn
[54:02] it's a terrible thing they they mourn
[54:06] and they just their Paul just says it
[54:09] beautifully there is no hope
[54:11] they have no hope they don't see they
[54:14] can't see a bigger picture they it just
[54:17] it tears them up to the point where
[54:19] that's their and don't get me wrong if
[54:22] you got to go on an antidepressant for a
[54:24] little bit that's do it do what the
[54:27] doctor says I believe that God can take
[54:28] you off of it - God will use that same
[54:31] doctor to put that prescribe you
[54:32] medicine to take you off of medication
[54:34] so if if you need it don't feel bad take
[54:38] it but know that that that this this is
[54:41] going to do you better than any pill
[54:43] that you can ever have you understand is
[54:47] that an okay balance I I trust that your
[54:50] pastor would agree with that but don't
[54:55] don't mourn as them that have no hope I
[54:57] mean they just they and and listen
[54:59] there's a natural process I believe you
[55:02] forgive me my my voice is just keeping
[55:05] me from really preaching how I want to
[55:08] you know we they they they just go back
[55:17] and forth there's there's a there's a
[55:18] time I believe in mourning from what
[55:20] I've seen that you know you go back in
[55:22] your mind and you wonder should we have
[55:24] done this different did did we give him
[55:27] the right medication did we give it to
[55:29] him when they when they needed it did
[55:30] they did they suffer too long did they
[55:32] feel this that and you just go through
[55:34] all that I listen I've watched a lot of
[55:36] people and and they just it just rolls
[55:39] around in their mind and listen you you
[55:42] got to stop that rolling and you got to
[55:44] have faith at some point you got to
[55:46] trust God amen
[55:49] you just you just have to stop it
[55:51] because otherwise Satan will keep you in
[55:53] such a turmoil that that he'll just
[55:56] steal your joy but when you don't have a
[56:00] hope you don't have you know it's it's
[56:02] when the wheels going like this the
[56:04] thoughts are going like this with the
[56:06] word and with faith you can stick it in
[56:08] there and stop it
[56:09] but without without a hope it just keeps
[56:11] going around and around and around and
[56:13] it'll just it'll drive you crazy
[56:15] you'll you'll just go insane thinking
[56:18] about these things because and it just
[56:19] tears you up don't let Satan steal your
[56:21] joy
[56:22] amen don't let Satan steal your joy so
[56:30] it's okay to mourn listen you want
[56:33] another scripture when Jesus came to the
[56:35] grave of Lazarus what's the shortest
[56:38] scripture in the Bible that I know of
[56:39] jesus wept
[56:41] so it's okay to weep it's okay to mourn
[56:46] it's okay to feel the loss it's okay
[56:52] but there's a truth there's a truth that
[56:57] we hold to as believers and that truth
[57:00] is that Paul tells us believers they
[57:03] don't die believers only sleep amen
[57:08] believers only sleep jesus said of
[57:11] Geri's his daughter she sleepeth and
[57:14] then the disciples were like well Lord
[57:16] we don't know not understand that maybe
[57:18] he meant this maybe he that and jesus
[57:21] said listen she's dead okay if you
[57:23] really want me to put it in your terms
[57:25] she's dead but if you look at the
[57:28] heavenly where I'm from in my kingdom
[57:30] Jesus was preaching his kingdom to him
[57:32] and he said she's only asleep she only
[57:35] sleeps for you all she's alive in
[57:37] another place of Lazarus our friend
[57:40] Lazarus sleepeth I'm sorry I was it's
[57:43] graves of Lazarus our friend Lazarus
[57:45] sleepeth and then the disciples were
[57:46] questioning and he said Lazarus is dead
[57:49] but listen she sleepeth he's sleeping
[57:53] believers they sleep they go to sleep
[57:55] they don't die they don't die
[58:00] this is the kingdom of God Paul goes in
[58:05] first Thessalonians to instruct us how
[58:08] to help someone who loses a loved one
[58:10] how do we help how do we because because
[58:14] the the grief is so great I've listened
[58:17] I just found that you know we try to
[58:18] find words and we try to speak things to
[58:21] help somebody who's going through a loss
[58:23] and and the truth is really there's not
[58:25] a whole lot you can say that's gonna
[58:27] make them feel better because there's
[58:29] just there's just an emptiness and and
[58:32] there's just a hole there and and it
[58:35] just it can't be filled it can't be
[58:38] there's a lot that's why they call a
[58:40] loss you lost something and even though
[58:43] you know one day you'll see him again it
[58:45] still hurts it physically it hurts
[58:50] one time I and it may have been your
[58:53] pastor I'm not sure but I remember
[58:55] hearing the story about a little boy and
[58:58] his parents I believe they died in a
[59:01] fire and they were trying to comfort
[59:05] this little boy he wouldn't hardly eat
[59:07] he wouldn't talk he just off to himself
[59:10] just completely shut in and they had the
[59:14] funeral and the little boy came out and
[59:16] he went over and he sat on the front of
[59:17] the church steps and another little boy
[59:20] come out and he sat next to him and he
[59:22] put his arm around him and they just
[59:23] cried they just both of them just
[59:25] started crying
[59:26] and after they had their cry they got up
[59:29] and they ran off and they started
[59:30] playing and so the pastor and the pet
[59:32] and then the other ones that the adults
[59:34] they called the little boy that went
[59:36] over and set and put his arm around him
[59:37] they said come over here
[59:40] we've tried everything what did you do
[59:41] what'd you say to him what what what'd
[59:44] you say to get him to bring him back and
[59:46] he said nothing he said I just cried
[59:48] with him and listen sometimes you don't
[59:51] have the words to say sometimes
[59:55] sometimes just cry with them it just
[59:58] shows them that you care in it and
[1:00:01] really that that says more than words
[1:00:04] can say because because you're
[1:00:07] connecting heart-to-heart with her
[1:00:10] you're connecting with their pain is
[1:00:15] this okay this morning I want a shout
[1:00:19] louder but my voice is restricting me a
[1:00:21] little so I'm just trusting this is the
[1:00:22] way the Lord wants it to go the word
[1:00:25] says that someday we're going to see
[1:00:27] them again
[1:00:27] Paul says comfort one another with these
[1:00:30] words we won't we won't prevent those
[1:00:33] that sleep from coming
[1:00:36] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:00:39] heaven I just want to take a moment
[1:00:42] because I want to I want to show you
[1:00:44] where we're at in time because I believe
[1:00:46] that he said comfort one another with
[1:00:49] these words and I believe if we can see
[1:00:51] where we're at in time then we'll be
[1:00:53] comforted I believe that we'll be
[1:00:56] excited even in the midst of loss and
[1:00:58] things it gives us it gives us the hope
[1:01:00] that we're going to see them but we're
[1:01:02] going to see them one day soon for the
[1:01:04] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:01:08] with a shout with the voice of the
[1:01:10] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[1:01:12] the dead in Christ shall rise first when
[1:01:14] when he's descending then we which are
[1:01:19] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:01:20] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:01:22] the lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:01:25] be with the Lord so shall we ever be
[1:01:28] with the Lord you want to find comfort
[1:01:30] that's not just with the Lord just
[1:01:32] talking about you and him he's talking
[1:01:34] about with those loved ones we're gonna
[1:01:36] meet him in the air and then we'll be
[1:01:37] forever with the Lord then we'll be
[1:01:39] eternity one with another then then
[1:01:42] sickness and sorrow and death will cease
[1:01:49] notice
[1:01:55] we're alive and remain are caught up and
[1:01:57] we don't prevent them let me see here
[1:02:01] I'm just missing something here okay a
[1:02:05] little bit further could I keep going
[1:02:06] Paul said in first Corinthians 15 we
[1:02:09] read I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:02:11] all sleep but we shall be changed some
[1:02:16] of us aren't going to taste death listen
[1:02:19] if we're believers we believe in a
[1:02:22] rapture otherwise what are we here for
[1:02:25] what what other what other explanation
[1:02:28] do you have for after afterlife what
[1:02:33] other what other hope do you have if you
[1:02:35] don't believe in a resurrection if there
[1:02:38] is no God and there is no heaven what
[1:02:40] are you living for I got news for you if
[1:02:44] you believe that you come back as an ant
[1:02:46] i squish ants I don't like ants I don't
[1:02:52] like spiders so what do you do then I
[1:02:57] hope that's not but I just I would just
[1:03:04] challenge your faith I don't believe we
[1:03:07] got anyone here that believes that but
[1:03:08] I'm just I'm just saying what what do
[1:03:10] you I want to I want to direct your hope
[1:03:13] I want to direct your faith there what
[1:03:18] are we living for what are we striving
[1:03:21] for let me ask you this when the
[1:03:24] preaching of the word comes forth if
[1:03:26] there's not a heaven if there's not a
[1:03:28] rapture if there's not a resurrection
[1:03:30] then what's in here that says amen to
[1:03:33] the word what's in here when we hear
[1:03:37] about these things that you feel that
[1:03:39] drawn that connection I can tell you
[1:03:42] you're being spoken to from another
[1:03:44] dimension

[1:03:56] amen there's something pulling there's
[1:04:00] something you're connecting with and
[1:04:02] that's your body over there waiting for
[1:04:05] you so remember if we die here we have a
[1:04:09] body already waiting amen you have a
[1:04:13] theophany you have a heavenly home

[1:05:02] now I want to watch I want you to watch
[1:05:04] I want you to catch these things he
[1:05:06] descends first with a shout
[1:05:09] what's the shout brother Branham taught
[1:05:11] us it's the message going forth first
[1:05:15] the Living bread of life bringing forth
[1:05:17] the bride it's a shout a messenger
[1:05:21] getting the people ready
[1:05:23] we've had the shout we're preaching the
[1:05:27] shout to you today we've had the shout
[1:05:31] that the messengers been taken off the
[1:05:33] scene the shout has come the message is
[1:05:36] calling the bride together if you don't
[1:05:40] understand what I'm talking about I
[1:05:41] would encourage you to get with your
[1:05:43] pastor get with brother brother Sam and
[1:05:46] and ask him about these things because
[1:05:48] this tells us where we're living in time
[1:05:50] this gives us our hope we're living in a
[1:05:54] time we're living in this it's it's it's
[1:05:57] the shout it's the message that we
[1:05:59] preach it's the message that brother Sam
[1:06:02] preaches every Sunday every Thursday to
[1:06:04] you the second is a voice of the
[1:06:07] resurrection the same voice that allowed
[1:06:10] voice in st. John 11:30 844 my voice is
[1:06:14] feeling good thank you for praying that
[1:06:16] called Lazarus from the grave
[1:06:18] getting the bride together and then the
[1:06:20] resurrection so understand it's it's the
[1:06:23] shout it's it's getting the bride
[1:06:25] together and then the voice comes and he
[1:06:28] calls up out of the grave the Prophet
[1:06:30] said that if Jesus wouldn't have said
[1:06:32] Lazarus come forth then every grave
[1:06:35] would have been open well guess what
[1:06:37] one day Jesus is going to come forth and
[1:06:40] he's going to say come forth my bride
[1:06:42] and all the graves will be open now
[1:06:52] watch getting the bride together and
[1:06:54] then the resurrection of the Dead Sea to
[1:06:56] be caught up with it now watch the three
[1:06:58] things takes place the next is what was
[1:07:01] a trumpet a voice a shout shout a voice
[1:07:04] of trumpet now the third thing is the
[1:07:06] trumpet which always at the Feast of
[1:07:08] Trumpets is calling the people to the
[1:07:10] feast and that will be the bride's
[1:07:12] supper the Lord's Supper with the bride
[1:07:14] and the sky see the first thing comes
[1:07:16] forth is this message calling the bride
[1:07:19] together the next thing is the
[1:07:20] resurrection of the sleeping of the
[1:07:23] sleeping bride the ones that died back
[1:07:25] in the other ages the ones that have
[1:07:27] died in our time they're caught together
[1:07:29] and then the Trump the feast in the
[1:07:32] heavens in the sky why that's the thing
[1:07:34] that takes place friends
[1:07:36] I ask you where are we at in time really
[1:07:41] if we believe we're just waiting we're
[1:07:45] just waiting for the dead for the excuse
[1:07:48] me those that sleep we're waiting for
[1:07:51] those that sleep to be called up and
[1:07:53] then the trumpets going to go forth and
[1:07:56] then we'll be with them forever more
[1:07:59] that should encourage our hearts this
[1:08:01] morning you know I've just had this
[1:08:05] burning on my heart and I was thinking
[1:08:06] you know if I get the opportunity I'm
[1:08:08] gonna say it today you know the
[1:08:12] scripture tells us that as it was in the
[1:08:17] days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:08:19] coming of the Son of man as it was in
[1:08:22] the days of Noah and of life you know I
[1:08:24] think it words it those couple different
[1:08:26] ways but it's referring to the things
[1:08:28] that are going on in those times brother
[1:08:30] Branham teaches us and I was thinking
[1:08:35] you know I was listening I've just been
[1:08:36] listening through the through the the
[1:08:38] message the year 63 and I and I just
[1:08:40] went through flashing red lights of his
[1:08:42] coming and something he said that struck
[1:08:44] me and I went I'm gonna set a challenge
[1:08:47] out to especially our brothers this
[1:08:49] morning as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:08:52] we know that there's you know the amaura
[1:08:55] immorality is just on the rampage
[1:08:58] it's just corruption as has never been
[1:09:01] more corrupt than the day that we're
[1:09:03] living in at the time that is right now
[1:09:05] but it says that if you look back during
[1:09:08] those times that the son of man saw that
[1:09:11] the the daughters are the sons of God
[1:09:13] saw that the daughters of men were
[1:09:14] faring and brought in unto them the sons
[1:09:18] of God saw that the daughters of man
[1:09:22] were fair and went in unto them I want
[1:09:25] to challenge you brothers and I'm just
[1:09:29] going to preach
[1:09:30] that if you're stuck on pornography that
[1:09:34] that Delilah is stealing your strength
[1:09:37] and you need to come away from it that's
[1:09:41] the time we're living in and they have
[1:09:43] statistics I've heard years ago that
[1:09:47] they would have I was I don't know why
[1:09:48] this all came into my mind but I'm just
[1:09:50] gonna say it
[1:09:51] they had statistics years ago I remember
[1:09:54] hearing that the worst that hotel saw of
[1:09:58] pornography being viewed on TVs and
[1:10:01] hotels from different groups they had
[1:10:03] come stay was was Christian was among
[1:10:05] Christian men that's a shame that's a
[1:10:09] disgrace
[1:10:10] that's a disgrace I asked you that if
[1:10:13] you're if you're bound that you you give
[1:10:16] over to God that you that you seek God
[1:10:19] repent and come away from the thing
[1:10:22] because that thing let me I'm not
[1:10:25] getting it let's get away from
[1:10:27] pornography whatever you're tied to
[1:10:29] today whatever sin whatever whatever
[1:10:33] thing that you that you feel is draining
[1:10:35] your strength come away from it because
[1:10:37] that thing will be here Delilah and
[1:10:39] it'll take your strength I'm gonna point
[1:10:44] out if for whatever it is I don't care
[1:10:45] what it is it's time that we get away
[1:10:48] from these things that we live as
[1:10:50] Christians should live because we're
[1:10:52] preparing for a rapture and it's going
[1:10:55] to come any day and we need to be ready
[1:10:57] we need listen we need to be mature
[1:11:00] grown-up Christians if the sinner can't
[1:11:07] come into this building
[1:11:08] and seek God on display and I'm talking
[1:11:14] that's going to be reflected in your
[1:11:15] personal life then where can the sinner
[1:11:17] go amen
[1:11:20] they should be able to look at you in
[1:11:22] the workplace and you should have a have
[1:11:24] such a cleanliness about you such a
[1:11:27] holiness that it attracts them to you
[1:11:29] that that listen don't take your
[1:11:32] holiness for granted when God brings
[1:11:35] holiness into your life that you that
[1:11:38] displays whether you realize it or not
[1:11:41] sisters your your that your the great
[1:11:44] example of this the way the way you
[1:11:46] dress the way you conduct yourselves the
[1:11:49] things that the scripture says about
[1:11:50] about hair and about makeup
[1:11:52] that's okay listen if you struggle about
[1:11:54] it now don't just just stay with it got
[1:11:57] it reveal it to you but I'm just saying
[1:12:00] that is there's such a thing of holiness
[1:12:03] in your life that's why God they listen
[1:12:05] oh my that's why God required that's why
[1:12:09] God asks it of you quit quit looking it
[1:12:14] as I have to I have to do this I listen
[1:12:19] if you catch what God's trying to do for
[1:12:22] you as a woman of God you'll want to do
[1:12:24] it you'll just want to do it because you
[1:12:28] realize it's it's a protection it's a
[1:12:31] it's a it's a position for you
[1:12:34] God says listen I want your dignity to
[1:12:37] be the highest that it can be and that's
[1:12:39] why I'm asking these things of you that
[1:12:42] doesn't determine your salvation it's
[1:12:45] not a heaven or hell issue will give the
[1:12:48] critics that it's not a heaven or hell
[1:12:50] issue but I get so tired of hearing that
[1:12:54] because it's not about is this a heaven
[1:12:57] or hell issue it's about what pleases my
[1:12:59] lord what pleases you lord my brother
[1:13:06] the things that you look at the things
[1:13:09] that you watch the things that you look
[1:13:11] that you go to for entertainment the
[1:13:14] things listen I believe in I believe in
[1:13:16] wholesome entertainment in moderation
[1:13:19] because even though wholesome things it
[1:13:21] can stew your strengths but I'm just
[1:13:24] saying friends what's pleasing to God
[1:13:28] what's pleasing that's what we need to
[1:13:32] look at what's pleasing to You Lord and
[1:13:33] if you don't know don't don't fret don't
[1:13:39] get worked up ask him ask him
[1:13:44] who better to ask than the one who asked
[1:13:47] you than the one that says listen I love
[1:13:52] you I love you well Lord what why I love
[1:13:59] you it select it selectively love it's
[1:14:01] not because of what you've done it's not
[1:14:04] because of what you don't do Paul said
[1:14:07] that those things that I want to do I
[1:14:08] can't seem to do and the things that I
[1:14:11] don't want to do I seem to find myself
[1:14:12] doing what can separate us from the love
[1:14:16] of God show height or depth shell
[1:14:19] principality shall death nothing shall
[1:14:23] separate us from the love of God
[1:14:25] so listen get it out of your head that
[1:14:27] anything God would ask of you is is
[1:14:30] determining his love to you it doesn't
[1:14:36] the the the words of the song are
[1:14:39] escaping me that I asked you to sing
[1:14:41] again but it was just so good because
[1:14:42] God doesn't look at us he doesn't look
[1:14:45] at us he looks at the sacrifice you have
[1:14:48] a representation you have representation
[1:14:51] in heaven the Lamb the bloody lamb is on
[1:14:56] the mercy seat god when he hears your
[1:14:59] voice
[1:15:00] oh listen friend somebody must be
[1:15:04] struggling this mornin because when God
[1:15:07] from his throne looks down and he hears
[1:15:09] your voice he doesn't see you he sees
[1:15:13] your representation Oh which is Jesus
[1:15:16] Christ
[1:15:18] hallelujah he sees Jesus my is it that
[1:15:24] what it what a deal
[1:15:26] what a trade what a trade what a trade I
[1:15:35] just can't
[1:15:37] [Applause]
[1:15:40] Satan says mr. browning I'm gonna use
[1:15:44] you because I know you won't be offended
[1:15:47] Satan says hey did you see what sister
[1:15:50] browning did did you see that he's
[1:15:53] accuser of the Brethren
[1:15:54] day and night constantly accusing did
[1:15:57] you see what my sister did did you sorry
[1:16:00] he wouldn't call you sister did you see
[1:16:02] what she did did you see what your
[1:16:03] daughter did the one who claims to be
[1:16:05] your daughter did you see what she did
[1:16:07] and I can imagine that here's God and
[1:16:10] and he just just listening to Satan just
[1:16:16] accuse you and then and then he gets
[1:16:20] tired of it so he looks over at your
[1:16:22] representation and it's a bloody lamb
[1:16:30] [Applause]
[1:16:31] and he just says I can just imagine we
[1:16:34] dramatized and God just says son what do
[1:16:39] you say and Jesus says well father look
[1:16:44] at him and then God looks and he says I
[1:16:49] see you my son I only see the blood
[1:16:57] and then if you remember the vision that
[1:16:59] the Prophet had it's all being written
[1:17:03] down in the book and Jesus just says
[1:17:07] takes a little blood from his side and
[1:17:09] writes pardon and you know what God does
[1:17:14] God touched that book and I'm lucky the
[1:17:18] baptismal is and I'm open because this
[1:17:21] would be a perfect representation
[1:17:23] because God takes what Satan accused you
[1:17:27] of and he throws it in a sea of
[1:17:29] forgetfulness and let me tell you
[1:17:35] something God is so great that he never
[1:17:39] remembers it again because Satan will
[1:17:43] try and go fishing and I don't know if
[1:17:47] he catches anything and God's sea of
[1:17:49] forgetfulness but even if he comes and
[1:17:51] brings it back up this is written
[1:17:53] pardoned on it it smudged out the words
[1:17:58] can't be seen
[1:18:00] and there's your representation and
[1:18:06] that's all's God can see and then when
[1:18:11] you're sick and then when you're sad and
[1:18:14] you cry out to God God hears your voice
[1:18:19] but he sees your representation that's
[1:18:23] why when you pray in the name of the
[1:18:25] Lord Jesus Christ that's the same as
[1:18:28] Jesus Christ Himself praying because
[1:18:32] that's the high priest that's the one
[1:18:36] that's that's reading your words to God
[1:18:41] what you pray he's iterating to God so
[1:18:47] it's just the same as if he prays
[1:18:50] listen God answers every prayer when you
[1:18:55] think that God didn't answer your prayer
[1:18:57] let me tell you God answers every prayer
[1:18:59] it may not be the way that we wanted it
[1:19:03] or the way that maybe we were asking for
[1:19:07] it but let me tell you this if you'll
[1:19:09] pray and you'll say father thy will be
[1:19:11] done you'll never be disappointed
[1:19:15] Amen never you'll never be disappointed
[1:19:18] I don't know if we say this for our
[1:19:24] benefit or yours but I don't know how
[1:19:26] long I've been on this but none of that
[1:19:28] was in my notes so let's go on with our
[1:19:39] thought here
[1:19:40] revelations 21 verse 1 are y'all ok I
[1:19:43] haven't been paying attention to time so
[1:19:45] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:19:48] for the first heaven and the first Earth
[1:19:50] were passed away and there was no more
[1:19:53] sea that word pass away is a term we
[1:19:59] often use it's not the same word as I'm
[1:20:02] reading here but we often use that that
[1:20:03] term of words pass away to describe
[1:20:06] somebody who's who's gone on to be with
[1:20:08] the Lord who's died we they passed away
[1:20:11] we'll say that word in the English
[1:20:15] language means it's done it's dead it's
[1:20:19] it's gone pass away when you say they
[1:20:22] passed away it means they're not here no
[1:20:23] more but there's certain instances like
[1:20:27] this in the scripture
[1:20:29] where it the actual meaning of the word
[1:20:34] passed away here means to change from
[1:20:37] one form to the other
[1:20:39] so as believers when we say that our
[1:20:44] little sister Liliana or our brother
[1:20:46] John passed away that just means we're
[1:20:49] saying as they changed from one form to
[1:20:51] the other amen
[1:20:54] they're not dead they sleep they're just
[1:20:57] changed into their heavenly home they
[1:21:01] changed into the into the incorruptible
[1:21:03] I like this because just to illustrate
[1:21:07] this I want you to I just I just thought
[1:21:10] this was beautiful so I'm just I'm just
[1:21:12] gonna say it how Oh Lord gave it heavens
[1:21:15] and earth shall shall pass away jesus
[1:21:17] said but my words shall never pass away
[1:21:20] then let me read it to you by the
[1:21:21] meaning heavens and earth shall change
[1:21:24] but my word will never change amen
[1:21:30] that word change it's it's a loosing
[1:21:34] when Christ went to the grave of Lazarus
[1:21:36] he said loosed him it's the same word
[1:21:39] it's a it's a it's a changing from one
[1:21:42] form to the other
[1:21:42] it's the loosing one day friends why are
[1:21:45] these these corruptible bodies are going
[1:21:48] to put on incorruption and we're going
[1:21:50] to be changed from one form to the other
[1:21:52] we're gonna be loosed from from this
[1:21:56] vessel that that can get sick and that
[1:21:59] can die and that can feel sorrow and
[1:22:01] that you know that that Satan just he's
[1:22:05] a it's the principalities of the air and
[1:22:08] he can affect this thing but one day
[1:22:10] we're gonna be changed and he can't
[1:22:13] touch that thing he can't touch us there
[1:22:19] let me see I might I might just skip
[1:22:21] some of this
[1:22:28] there will be no death there I just I
[1:22:31] just want to encourage you this morning
[1:22:33] I just want you to have some joy this
[1:22:35] morning in your heart there will be no
[1:22:38] death there there's no sorrow there
[1:22:41] there's no heartache there there's no
[1:22:44] sickness
[1:22:45] there's no fatigue there's no there's no
[1:22:49] headache there's no stomachache there's
[1:22:52] no cancer there will never be another
[1:22:57] teardrop off a mother's cheek for her
[1:22:59] baby there may not never be another
[1:23:02] teardrop off of a husband or a wife for
[1:23:05] their for their spouse for their
[1:23:08] sweetheart there will be another never
[1:23:12] another tear you'll be with them forever
[1:23:16] with the Lord death is I just got to
[1:23:21] start bringing it to a close death where
[1:23:24] the Branham said this about death he can
[1:23:26] only take me by the hand and lead me
[1:23:27] across to master he is not my slave
[1:23:31] driver I am NOT death slave he is my
[1:23:35] slave Christ conquered death for me and
[1:23:39] only one thing he can do is pull me into
[1:23:42] the presence of my Maker
[1:23:44] when this earthly Tabernacle be
[1:23:46] dissolved I have another one waiting
[1:23:49] that's what death is to the believer
[1:23:52] it's just to usher it just takes you
[1:23:56] from one form to the other death death
[1:24:01] you know when you when someone's dying
[1:24:02] and in it there there's a little bit of
[1:24:05] suffering that that goes with death
[1:24:07] whether you know and it might I just
[1:24:09] want to say this right because you know
[1:24:11] there's it's just different
[1:24:13] circumstances I've seen but
[1:24:15] when they die you know the the the
[1:24:18] breathing will become labored what is
[1:24:22] that well let me ask you when a woman is
[1:24:24] in labor
[1:24:25] her breathing changes she's got to
[1:24:29] breathe different because why because
[1:24:32] something is about to be born where the
[1:24:34] random said that in you when you receive
[1:24:36] the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a life
[1:24:39] it's it's a baby you have you have the
[1:24:43] life of Christ inside of you and when
[1:24:46] death comes there has to be something
[1:24:49] that that triggers that birth there has
[1:24:52] to be something because you know nobody
[1:24:55] wants to die that they even the lot you
[1:24:58] know even as believers we know what's on
[1:25:00] the other side but we get worried about
[1:25:03] loved ones here we don't we don't want
[1:25:05] to leave different ones behind we're
[1:25:08] thinking about that we're thinking are
[1:25:10] they going to be okay what about this
[1:25:11] one are they going to be taken care of
[1:25:12] what about you know this one struggled
[1:25:14] with this and you have all these things
[1:25:15] you know those things are still on you
[1:25:17] and so you're laboring into it and so
[1:25:20] the Prophet said you need something to
[1:25:22] just shock you a little bit it just
[1:25:24] shocks you a little bit and then and
[1:25:25] then it's birth it's like when that
[1:25:27] baby's born it needs a little shock a
[1:25:29] little stimulation to take its breath
[1:25:31] and that's all death is that's all death
[1:25:34] is for you that's all death is for these
[1:25:37] ones who have gone on it's just a little
[1:25:39] shock to birth them into that other
[1:25:41] Kingdom I pray this is helping you this
[1:25:45] morning because you know sometimes these
[1:25:47] these things when we have people dying
[1:25:49] that's close to us it leaves a lot of
[1:25:50] questions and I and I just trust them
[1:25:52] that your questions are being answered
[1:25:54] this morning if this early for the
[1:25:58] hammer neck will be dissolved we have
[1:25:59] one already waiting you know waiting all
[1:26:01] right now
[1:26:08] so this is this is I I put this in I
[1:26:11] just felt led to put this in and and I'm
[1:26:13] just trusting maybe somebody had a
[1:26:14] question on this in Matthew 1810 he was
[1:26:19] speaking about taking little children I
[1:26:22] believe this is where he says suffer the
[1:26:24] little children to come unto me
[1:26:25] there was little children little tots
[1:26:27] three or four years old picking them up
[1:26:29] they brought him unto Him children a
[1:26:31] child children comes from the name child
[1:26:34] it's it's a little fellow not an infant
[1:26:36] but between that and a teenager it's not
[1:26:39] responsible yet for itself so I I hope
[1:26:43] I'm just gonna step back a minute
[1:26:45] because I just pray this is okay they're
[1:26:53] not responsible for themselves yet so
[1:26:56] our little sister Liliana she wasn't
[1:26:59] responsible for herself yet so maybe
[1:27:01] someone would say well will she be there
[1:27:04] now he said take heed that you don't
[1:27:06] despise if you'd really take that
[1:27:08] interpretation of the word is mystery
[1:27:10] see did not see see that take heed that
[1:27:14] you don't mistreat one of those one of
[1:27:16] those little ones mistreat a child you
[1:27:18] should never do that they're their
[1:27:19] children they don't know see and now
[1:27:22] notice said because they're angels
[1:27:24] always beholding the father's face with
[1:27:26] which is in heaven you see in other
[1:27:28] words they're angels their messengers
[1:27:30] their bodies they're Angelica bodies
[1:27:32] that they'll go to if they die are
[1:27:35] always before the father's face see now
[1:27:39] if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:27:42] we have one already waiting is that
[1:27:44] right that's a body so to me what he
[1:27:47] just said here was those little ones
[1:27:49] that they don't know no better they they
[1:27:53] they have representation before the
[1:27:55] father's face it's it's he listened he
[1:27:58] just said there ain't their angel which
[1:28:01] is the body that they'll go into if they
[1:28:03] should pass from this life into the next
[1:28:06] so why are you saying this well
[1:28:09] hopefully I'm making sense by now has
[1:28:10] just try to put it another way I believe
[1:28:13] that our sister Liliana I believe she'll
[1:28:15] be there she she was in that year she
[1:28:20] didn't know no better
[1:28:21] she had representation before the
[1:28:24] father's face now I want you to I want
[1:28:27] to I want to explain to you if just for
[1:28:29] a minute again can I have just it's only
[1:28:34] 12:30 does that answer if you had a
[1:28:41] question would with sister Liliana be
[1:28:43] there with the little ones be there I
[1:28:45] hope this answers it for you now the
[1:28:50] prophets said there's there's no
[1:28:54] children there's no babies there we're
[1:28:56] all one age for one eternity if you had
[1:29:02] to pick one age while you younger ones
[1:29:04] might not be able to pick this yet if
[1:29:08] you're over the age of 2025 will say
[1:29:15] what age would you go back to if you
[1:29:17] could choose what what age was your
[1:29:20] prime did you feel good could you stay
[1:29:23] up all night and then get up and go to
[1:29:25] work the next day what age was that
[1:29:30] around 20 right so think of that age
[1:29:36] your prime the prime of your youth
[1:29:40] when did when did when God made Adam and
[1:29:43] Eve did they come as infants no they
[1:29:47] came in the prime of their life that was
[1:29:50] their age that was and it was going to
[1:29:53] be for eternity but Satan interrupted
[1:29:55] that plan so what are we going back to
[1:29:58] for you older ones you should well if
[1:30:01] you can do it without hurt and you could
[1:30:03] stand and rejoice and say we're going
[1:30:05] back to that so the prime of the huge
[1:30:08] Amen hey listen I I the only reason I
[1:30:13] can just poke a little bit I'm only 32
[1:30:16] but I'll tell you it hurts sometimes at
[1:30:20] 32 I might not know completely but
[1:30:23] things have changed I want to read to
[1:30:28] you one more thing in closing are you
[1:30:29] okay
[1:30:30] is this okay today I'm I just pray it's
[1:30:33] been a help to you I want to read to you
[1:30:37] something if you listen and I hope I
[1:30:40] hope this is okay I trust I believe I
[1:30:43] know brother Sam if you haven't read the
[1:30:46] supernatural book and you'd like to read
[1:30:48] a good book get with brother Sam to get
[1:30:52] you one of these because this this will
[1:30:54] really tell you what God did in our day
[1:30:56] in our age God oh it's just you need to
[1:31:00] read it if you haven't and if you're not
[1:31:03] a good reader they have it on audio and
[1:31:04] they do a decent job at it it's pretty
[1:31:06] good so I want to I want to read to you
[1:31:10] just just a couple of things here now
[1:31:14] again I don't know who I don't know what
[1:31:17] what what who all we have here so if you
[1:31:20] don't know what I'm talking about again
[1:31:21] get with brother Sam Hill he'll explain
[1:31:23] it real well to you we believe that a
[1:31:26] prophet came in our day and in this
[1:31:30] prophets life it wasn't a flowery blood
[1:31:32] of ease you know he it wasn't I hope
[1:31:35] this is okay but it wasn't the the Joel
[1:31:38] Osteen's and in that you know with
[1:31:40] multi-million dollar and and you know
[1:31:43] this was a humble man from Kentucky with
[1:31:46] a seventh grade education and God did a
[1:31:49] work through this man and we could show
[1:31:52] you in the scripture
[1:31:53] that's what I'm saying if you want if
[1:31:54] you don't understand this get with
[1:31:55] brother Sam because he'll show you in
[1:31:57] the scripture and that's what's
[1:31:59] important but he went through a lot of
[1:32:02] hardship and he lost he lost his his
[1:32:05] wife and and a little baby girl early on
[1:32:08] and so this is just picking it up after
[1:32:12] that he dreamed it so this is talking
[1:32:17] about him he dreamed he was somewhere on
[1:32:18] a prairie out west walking along a
[1:32:20] desert road singing a pop popular
[1:32:22] Western ballad there's a wheel on the
[1:32:24] wagon that's broken and the sign on the
[1:32:26] ranch says for sale bill walked by an
[1:32:28] old covered wagon the kind that the
[1:32:30] early settlers called a Prairie schooner
[1:32:32] one of the wagons front wheels was
[1:32:34] broken making the Box frame tip down in
[1:32:37] one corner until the axle touched the
[1:32:39] ground next to where the cracks would
[1:32:41] and will leaned up against the wagons
[1:32:43] frame a pretty young lady stood watching
[1:32:45] him so when his baby died she was just
[1:32:49] seemed like maybe a year and a half if
[1:32:51] that so this is this is a young lady
[1:32:54] standing there pretty young lady the way
[1:32:56] the wind played played with a long
[1:32:58] blonde hair her blue eyes sparkled in
[1:33:00] the Sun as bill walked by he took off
[1:33:03] his cowboy hat and greeted her
[1:33:04] cheerfully good morning ma'am she
[1:33:06] answered good morning daddy
[1:33:07] bill stopped and stared at the beautiful
[1:33:10] woman dressed in white she looked at
[1:33:12] least twenty years old why miss how can
[1:33:14] I be your daddy when you're almost as
[1:33:16] old as I am her smile widened showing
[1:33:19] perfectly formed teeth daddy you just

[1:33:26] Sharon but you you were just a little

[1:33:30] daddy they're all the same age we're
[1:33:33] immortal where is where is my brother
[1:33:36] Billy Paul I left him with mrs. broy

[1:33:51] you have one here daddy look and she
[1:33:55] pointed up the road there at the end of
[1:33:57] the trail stood an impressive mansion
[1:33:59] perched on top of the hill the Sun had
[1:34:01] just dipped behind the mansion's roof
[1:34:03] and now Sun beam shot out in every
[1:34:05] direction like beacons
[1:34:07] guiding weary travelers home to rest
[1:34:09] bill walked along the road and with his
[1:34:11] hands up in the air singing my home
[1:34:12] sweet home a long stairway led from the
[1:34:15] bottom of the hill up to the front door
[1:34:18] you still listening hope waited in the
[1:34:22] doorway dressed in white and her long
[1:34:24] black hair unfurl unfurled in the breeze
[1:34:27] bill bound up the stairway taking three
[1:34:29] steps that are stride when he reached
[1:34:31] the landing he fell at her feet
[1:34:32] hope gently urged him to get up bill
[1:34:35] said hope I just met Sharon down on the

[1:35:08] about us anymore

[1:35:12] patted his back just like she had done
[1:35:13] so often on earth bill you look so tired
[1:35:16] you're wearing yourself out praying for
[1:35:18] the sick come inside with me now you can
[1:35:20] sit down and rest he walked with her
[1:35:23] inside the mansion and there sat a green

[1:35:26] lost to the finance company because he
[1:35:28] couldn't make the payments Hope said do
