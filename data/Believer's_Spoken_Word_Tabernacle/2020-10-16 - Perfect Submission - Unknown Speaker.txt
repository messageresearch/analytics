to the lord and just looking to him for his leadership and direction in every step in our life amen so let's just let's just turn our hearts into into the word of the lord here tonight we want to go to romans chapter eight and go back there just for a little bit here this evening and uh i'm gonna say certainly i appreciate musicians and brian taking that service there just on a moment's notice for the brian holder and stepping in and trying to do everything we can to try to satisfy some of the issues that come up here but we're just thankful to god that the lord has still made a way that we're here whether we had volume or pa or whatever more i think my voice is probably loud enough it'll probably carry but and so we'll just want to just want to say it's good to see each and every one of you some of you haven't uh haven't seen you different ones been on vacation and different things and so i trust that you had a vacation sometimes when i get a little myself i get a little nervous about vacations i'm kind of a homebody if i never left home i'd be just as happy as happy could be i'm just happy with that part of it because sometimes you know how it is you're going on vacation you actually say hey i need a vacation now for my vacation but uh we're just so so glad to be in the house of the lord tonight and uh as we get ready to read the word let's just look to him in a word of prayer tonight let's just whatever you have on your heart your petition just make it known to the lord tonight let's just believe that god will just come right here and speak to us tonight heavenly father lord we are just so thankful dear god for an opportunity that you have given and provided for us lord that we could be able to assemble ourselves together tonight your god lord truly not under that of a man but dear god under the leadership of the holy ghost because lord that's where we've been brought back under lord the leadership of the spirit of god through the word and lord we're so thankful we can't say thank you enough lord for what you've done for us in this hour lord you've brought us lord to reality lord light lord god has come upon our lives lord that we might lord know you and might be able to see who we are father we just ask tonight that lord god you would come and lord just speak to our hearts lord may you quicken the word to our hearts and us to the word lord and i pray that god that we would each and every one of us lord that's gathered here tonight whether here physically or by way of the internet lord may our hearts and our lives be changed lord god because you have come in our midst lord we pray we just ask that you would just take control now in the name of jesus christ amen amen let's begin reading at verse 1 if we could the scripture said there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit in verse 5 he says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his i'd like to just speak to you tonight on the thought of perfect submission perfect submission you may be seated i'm going to read a quote here as we get started here tonight i just want to say we just you know just thankful to the mercy of god for all that god has provided for us within this hour in the hebrew in the hebrew series brother branham makes this statement uh he says god then became in another type of a tabernacle and that tabernacle was who jesus and god was inside of jesus and he was hid but he was reconciling the world to himself by his expressions now that that's a very key part by his expressions christ revealed god think of it many he walked here upon the earth the bible says that he came to his own and his own received him not they who actually had all of the prophecies and everything that was laid out in the uh in the the law and the prophets and the psalms all of that was in there that would write or the word that was given that he would come to fulfill and express yet when he came he was a mystery to the world his own people who had this the gentiles remember the gentiles were without the covenants the promises of adoption any of those things but they who actually had these rehearsed to them knew them and who were promised to them they missed him but you see this is where it comes to to the reality the only way that you and i would know him is that is that in his expression there is something inside of you and i that is greater than our human intellect or any ability as a matter of fact it supersedes that passes beyond that and it's god who reaches down and captures what he already has sown within our life so brother brown goes on he says he was reconciling the world to himself by his expressions christ revealed god he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me i do nothing in myself but what i see the father doing the father in me showing me these visions and then i go do just what the father told me to do he said you get it god was inside of a human body not behind goat skins died but was living moving god had hands god had feet god had had a tongue god had eyes and it was christ there he was now he went away and the spirit come in that through his death he might perfect the church and bring the church submissive now remember the word as we were looking on sunday imperfect or perfection it is dealing with the perfection of his own life perfection speaks of completion and the new birth itself is a completion of the very sovereign word of almighty god it's god who begins to work within our life drawing us to himself and then the completion the culmination is when god caps off our life with his own life and that is what makes the difference between you and i and the rest of the world it's not anything that we could do we can brag on but it's actually been the power of god moving upon our lives through the word that would lead us back home back to him to our true mate so brother baby says he might perfect the church and bring the church submissive then the same spirit that was in christ is in the church doing the same things christ did a little while and the world won't see me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now i want you to just to think of this as we look at this thought here for a few moments on perfect submission uh because we were thinking of perfection and we look at this with submission we know uh that submission itself is not something that is uh the result of a demand uh neither is it something that is the result of a command in terms of of a law but it is something that really comes out of a true willingness it takes a real surrender and so when we're looking at this as paul would write this in here in the scripture paul is speaking to uh that of a life that is free from condemnation where you know within your heart in your life that you've been made free that the love of the world has taken the has taken the uppermost seat within your of the love of god sorry has taken the uppermost seat in your heart and life there's no there's no desires for the thing of the world anymore you can truly you have a testimony that the life that i once lived i don't live no more you have a testimony i've passed from death unto life it's not something that you can explain but you know it's real you know it's happened to you and you know that there's no more condemnation you're not the same man you're not the same woman you're not who you used to be but you are a new creation in the same old temple what did that god did that so paul would bring this in a measure in looking back here in romans the scriptures that we read here tonight and paul would deal with this in in separating that of of the carnal mind and that of the spiritual mind and we know when paul would write of this to be minded it deals with that which is to obey or to be under the control of one and here in verse 5 paul would say they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now when you think of in the scripture because we're dealing with carnal mind and spiritual mind and every one of us when we entered into this world we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives we entered in that of a carnal mind but yet there with god he placed that which is on the inside of us like the seed in the beginning in genesis 1 that was under the darkness and the condition and there needed to come a change of atmosphere in our life that would release that seed that had the potential within it to become what he had in his mind and spoke it to be so the only thing that could change the atmosphere would be the word itself and the word would actually come and begin to set in motion the earth and it what and it's the earth that had the seed within it you see what many people see is they can see finally in your life or my life here it begins to move into into the program of god but really what it is it's the seed of god that's coming under the effect and the authority of the word and it's changing the atmosphere and it's drawing this part of the earth because it's actually the seed that it's after it's coming to redeem that son or daughter of god that he foreknew before the foundation of the world once that once that experiences redemption brother then that can say one of these days this will experience a full redemption so when we look at it we know that as paul would write of it that uh in the carnal mind and the spiritual mind and and so many times you know brother branham would take this in 1965 when he preaches the message thirst and he would deal with it in terms of where many people he says are trying to live between these two many between the two desires a desire for the world and a desire to serve god a desire of the flesh and a desire of the soul and you know i think that it calls or behooves us uh as we look at it that you know god would speak in the old testament he would come around and speak in in the book of james that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways he's unsure he's unstable and this is why there is no white black bird there's no drunk sober man there's no sinner saint that's why that in this age that god at the end of the age he spewed the church out of his mouth because the church was lukewarm he said i would that you were hot or cold in other words make up your mind what you're going to be and be that with all that's in your whole mind that's why brother branham could talk to brother billy brother billy paul and he said billy he said if you're going to be above you'd be the best bum you can be whatever you're gonna do you'd be the best you can be i believe tonight that i'm speaking to sons and daughters of god i'm speaking to hearts and lives that god has touched and i believe there's a desire on the inside we want to be a better christian we want to be as close to god we want to be the best christian that we can be we want to be close to him so close to him walking with him that's our desire and so when we we recognize that that paul would write of this that which is you know after the flesh they mind the things of the flesh you cannot require spiritual things of them they are minded in the flesh but they that are of the spirit they do mind the things of the spirit in other words when someone has come into that place of the spirit realm remember the carnal mind can't understand it the carnal mind would say moses why are you speaking to a rock everybody knows that's the driest thing in the world and it would also speak you know to noah why in the world are you talking about building an ark there's a flood coming and a rain is going to fall there ain't never ever been any rain but you see the spiritual mind it passes beyond the carnal mind the carnal mind is limited it's limited in power it's limited in authority but the spiritual mind there is no limitations as a matter of fact that carnal mind itself is a barrier but once you can go beyond that barrier you cross into unlimited places with god and you know what when your heart begins to desire for that as the prophet said there's a sound barrier to be broken so when we know this that how brother adam you know as he would lay and drop this down that in the scripture we find so clear that when we must be we must be born again they that are the flesh you know uh they they are there's uh which is born of the flesh is flesh and what's born of the spirit is spirit that's why we must be born again now brother adam would take this let's just look at this just for a moment in this of the mindedness the carnal mind and the spiritual mind of how each and every one of us here you know would come into this place ah you know into this life in this world brother brown would take take an example in that of the message paradox and as he's looking at this in here in the message paradox he deals with how that a life itself there is absolutely no way that a person can be a christian unless there is a paradox that takes place in their life because it takes a supernatural you see a paradox is not something you can you can explain yet it's something that is true and it's something that you believe it's what you can stand on it's a paradox it's just like that of men have for their for for lifetimes have tried to disprove or try to understand how moses and them crossed the red sea it's not that we need to understand it it's to believe it because what god did there he's the same god for our lives right now it's the same god that when it would seem like in our life it's closed off maybe when god was dealing with your life you were backed up against a wall and you didn't know which way to turn and you didn't know where which way do i go which way do i turn but that's when god came on the scene and god made a way it was god by his word that parted and opened the waters you did not know and could not find the way but god rich in mercy he came and revealed that i am the way to lead you god rich in mercy it was god that came to you and me so when we think of this and to recognize this mindedness carnal mind and spiritual mind and you know brother branham would deal with it of how that that paradox would come into a life and when the paradox would come it changes a man's nature or a woman's nature it changes our thinking it changes our ways it changes tendencies there is a new man on the inside that is renewed in the knowledge of jesus christ and brother brown would deal with here you know thinking of it he's he's talking to a parents that they can't understand what's wrong with their son you know because there's been something where the son you know it had promised a young lady or and did something or whatever and he wouldn't he wouldn't go make it right he he just would not ask for forgiveness now the parents are wanting to know what is going on with our son now brother baton goes into it and he lets him know he says now i want you to consider it he said here you are you know the mother was a german the father was an irishman and he deals with the genes that are in the natural genes within that parent there's certain parts of makeup you know the irish high tempered and moody and and this and that ring will call yours out tonight but the german part of it and how that the german part was you know brother bam said you could say hi hey come visit us sometimes he said they just sit there and look at you they just wouldn't even greet you back at all they would just look at you but you notice he goes into and he's helping them to see that the genes no matter how full of the holy ghost you are in your life he says that young man he himself has to be born again now you know the genes itself sometimes you know we like to kind of pride ourselves that our genes are good and there's no doubt there's good qualities in every one of us but to understand that everything that you or i could say man this is a strength about the sanchez's this is a strength about the crescents this is a strength about the cruises if you're not careful your strength will be your downfall because every part of our life must be cemented and under the control of the holy spirit instead of us looking at to elevate it and say well so and so don't have this maybe god put that in you for that to be surrendered that he would go together with the body not stand out but blend together with the body to for god to use to be able to minister through that so you know when we look at this a father and mother father had all of these characteristics you know high-tempered moody and this and that and and mother you know that part of unforgiveness and pardon and brother brown goes back into the family tree and he's able to look there and he's taking them back into their family tree he's letting the mother know this is how your sisters are he lets you know the the man know this is how your brothers are he said but notice he said in you it's different for you talking now to the mother it's different he said you're sweet you're tender you're forgiven he said what is that that's not your natural tree that is the tree of life that is christ that has come in your life you now have been lifted from the tree of life and put into the tree of life or lifted from the tree of your natural genealogy and put into the tree of spiritual genealogy who can do that there's not enough teaching not enough training not enough recitation nothing can do that outside of a paradox a miracle of almighty god coming down and bringing a real birth in that life this young man brother branham would say it like this he said that young man he said he's doing all that he can in his intellects to try to overcome this he's trying to overcome those genes let me put it like this there's tendencies baggage or we could call it the grab bag of life you did not grab and put in your grab bag of life what you wanted to grab from your mom and dad you just got a grab bag and said go it was like you showed up to take your lunch and they said you came down to take sack lunches like when i was teaching school the kids didn't come down and say oh you know i'll take i'll take a bologna in mine another one said no i take peanut butter my nope you came down you got a sack lunch you got what's in that bag they might have ran out of doritos right here and this next guy might have got ruffles the next person over there might have got cheetos all you did was pick up the grab bag of life some of you got certain things some of you got other things and you see at one point in time that the very nature that set within you and i it would dominate and rule in that part of our life but god rich in mercy he comes down and he moves within our life he brings a paradox where it's no longer us in our intellects trying to overcome but it is the sovereign grace of god overcoming through our life does it mean that we are free from battles no it does not at all but it just simply means greater is he that is in us than he that's in the world and god will manifest his overcoming power right through you and i you see what happens then we be commanded in the spiritual way we become geared within that manner our sensitivity is to the lord our desire is to please him so when we we think of this it must be you know god to move down on that child because you know the man uh from what i'm told it's a relative from here you know the man himself he stands there but brother brown of my son he came to the altar he repented brother branham he'd been baptized in the name of jesus christ brother he's identified as a believer brother brahm said all those things are true yes he has taken his position as a believer but he said he needs the baptism of the holy ghost you see the only thing that will be able to override the natural genes because the natural genes are part of the carnal mind the only thing that'll be able to override that is the spiritual mind that comes in through by the new birth then you've got a new rulership on the inside there are things that you normally would have went and did and even now if you sort to go in that that direction the spirit of god is there to catch you and correct you and you know what real maturity is real maturity is not trusting this thing but it is trusting the god who rests on the inside of you to bring you in subjection amen it's like sometimes there can be a tendency within a family to hold grudges but the spirit of god within you oh it doesn't mean that there might not be a time that you know something comes up and there's a test you know for everybody some other party it'll pass right through them pass right by him you know but for you that would be a test but you see god and his grace will move down now if you don't heed to it remember the bible says you can grieve the spirit of god but when you can come back into that place the spirit of god can deal with your life and you move into that place and say lord i don't want any fellowship to be broken between you and i i want to walk in that union in a fellowship then from there you begin to recognize this is a weakness in my life i need to keep that covered by the blood of jesus christ and help me to be sensitive lord because you know why you're going to be tested again and again the new birth did not strip it out of your flesh it just gave a ruling authority on the inside of your soul now notice this here in the scripture y'all have to you don't have to pray for me i had to finally get some cheaters put in my glasses because i really hadn't been able to even you know read things and see things i had done more of without glasses or whatever more you know when you're looking at the medicine bottle like this and so when we look at this here the bible says in verse 7 the carnal mind is enmity against god because the carnal mind remember that first nature is a conception between satan and eve it's in reasoning against the word cain he came forward he offered up reasoning clean fruit good fruit but it was offered by reasoning abel came and offered what god had sovereignly revealed to him they both heard the same teaching fruit took us out of the garden but god moved in the place and revealed to abel it was blood that took them out it'll be blood to take you back in did that mean that abel understood it no it does not revelation does not mean that we understand it here but revelation brings faith within our heart but we cannot explain it we know that that is truly the word and will of almighty god enmity notice the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be now look at this word subject this word subject is the word ah in the greek it's called hupathaso and this is where we're dealing with the thought on submission it means to arrange to submit to one's control to subject oneself to submit to one's control to yield to one's admonition or advice to obey or be subject in one in one term it can also be used in a military way and then also in a non-military way and we know also in the scripture god will bring uh the illustration of that of of a bride body of a people who are arranged in an order uh under the headship of the word because we are dressed as soldiers of the cross we've been dressed up with his life inside of you and i so in order to be dressed then there had to be a submission this is where in military it deals with you know to arrange in a military fashion under the command of a leader and our leader is the holy ghost in a non-military use it's a voluntary attitude of giving in cooperating assuming responsibility and carrying a burden now i want to just look at a few places in the scripture that this word is used here of of of of um that of submission or to be subject to the law of god this word subject here in in heb in romans 10 3 the bible says for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth now think of this they were recognizing here was god was in christ the bible said reconciling the world to himself now to understand that reconciling god was manifesting himself in reconciliation as he had redeemed that body that he had created that then through the offering of that body he would redeem the rest it was god expressing even when the bible would say you know when we look at it in the book of uh of isaiah 53 and it talks about you know the expression of the messiah the report that would be expressed and in the life and ministry of the lord jesus the bible would say that how that he himself he bore our infirmities he took our sicknesses he came among those who were sick those who were devil possessed he came among those who were so mixed up in their marriages and here he came the son of man he came and he dealt with the real issue and the real situation in their life he did not come to pat him on the back and tell him oh what a horrible condition you're in oh this is just terrible no he come to do something about it he come to set him free those who were bound with an infirmity it didn't matter on what the scale if it was how great the infirmity maybe somebody had died or how small the infirmity even sometimes where you take the land at the pool of bethesda brother braham said his infirmity would not have killed him it just goes to show you and i that no matter what you and i might think like well i got a toothache you know i i really couldn't ask prayer why not even if you got a hangnail you can go to god in prayer about it god cares god even took in this hour a little fishy it wasn't a great big bass that would have won tournaments god took a little fishing something that anybody else would have said oh well it's just a fish but god did that for you and i that you and i might see that god takes interest in things that you and i would seem so small but we need a great big god to come on the scene and god would do that for you and i now hear god was manifested to that within israel but remember israel now notice when this manifestation came the woman at the well she said i know that thou art messiah's which is to come now the same expression to the religious in that day said your bill's above expression same expression same message same expression well what was the difference it depended what was on the inside glory be to god so when this expression was expressed to them through the life through god as he come down in the temple of his humanity they themselves seeing the righteousness of god what is the righteousness of god them pharisees were some righteous people but the righteousness of god is god's own word his life being fulfilled oh glory be to god oh glory be to god ephesians 5 21 let's look at another a few other places here in the bible it says submitting same word yourselves one to another in the fear of god this is a paradox too among a local body of believers submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of god brother brown would take this scripture when there was a desire you know to build a new church and brother brown you know would uh you know come along with that brother braham seeing the need it would be the best thing to do was to build a new church but then you know the people themselves did not want to build a new curtain a new new church so brother bam takes the scripture and what did he do he says well if that's how the church is voting we're just going to remodel this building then we'll just stand with that right there submitting ourselves to one another in the fear of god now brother branham could have drawn himself off and got you know pounded and man things aren't going my way and man they need to be going this way and they need to be going this way what kind of example would that be for you and i but you see in order for this to come about remember in times of peace it really doesn't require all the fruits of a statue of perfect man but then fruits are born and manifest in times of adversity it's easy to be long-suffering when you don't need to be right it's easy to be that but you see when long-suffering or forgive even as god for christ's sake has forgiven you amen well you know what's going to require in order for that to be made manifest in our life it's going to require us to come into a situation that we're going to have to do that oh jesus i am signing up for that tonight but submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god notice not the fear or reverence of one another this is in the fear of god that's the real issue with not only the nation among the churches right in message churches on and on is what is it it's a lack of the fear of god oh brother samuel we need to preach more we need no it's a sign that the presence of god is lifting it's a sign that the presence of god is lifting but i don't know how about you lord i i want to invite it i want to invite it i want to walk in real reverence to the word of god whether nobody when anybody sees me even sitting right here you realize to be reverence god a person can sit right here in body form and yet within their spirit they're attacking everything that's going on this is where submitting ourselves unto one another in the fear of almighty god now ephesians 5 22 here here is the the scripture the same word used again wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject same word unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing now paul goes on i'm not going to read all this the rest of this chapter but paul would go into this in the chapter and he deals with what the what what we just read right here be subject this is not something to say will you be subject to me no that's not what it is remember the definition is is a voluntary attitude one who gives in to cooperate in other words if we can say it like this it's not two visions not two kid not two chefs in the kitchen it's one recipe we're following it's one vision we're under it's one power we're being moved by one mind one accord it's to come into that harmony that's a great achievement man can never bring that kind of achievement but it takes god to bring that achievement and god bringing that achievement is god moving upon our lives and drawing us under that vision of his word oh man oh god help us so notice now the scripture says how it goes on talks about the expression without me reading it it deals with how that the husbands ought to love see in order for subjection to come to that of a husband where it says wives be subject to your own husbands and everything first of all they've got to see the representation and know that that's my husband and they also have to see the attributes of husband displayed how can you subject yourself to one who's not being on display are you with me so now the responsibility if this is what god is requiring the only thing that can draw out a wife not a woman but a wife the only thing that will draw out a wife is the manifestation of the husband is that right it's where you know uh as the husband himself and you know through the courting process and then it moves from the corning to where the heart begins knitted becomes knitted in one in the engagement and then it leads right into the marriage ceremony but all of that is a is is a reality where the husband himself is is manifesting himself or the man is revealing himself in that manner his intentions and everything is clear and there is a reciprocating go on because remember a woman does not go out and choose a man i mean that that's just not even that's not even the way things work god chose his bride before the foundation of the world it was not something that was just was done in time time is only to manifest the choosing that already took place but the choosing remember it has to be that of his own kind of his own kindred when god sent uh when abraham sent eliezer to get a bride for isaac he told him don't you take one or hear a wife of these inhabitants of this land but i want you to go back to my homeland i want you to go back to the homeland of the holy ghost i want you to go back to the homeland of the promised word i want you to go back there and i want you to get a bribe for my son isaac is that right it would have to be one of his kindred and you see though you and i could not see ourselves as the bride of jesus christ but god knew you and i he knew exactly what it would take and the angel the lord just as the angel of the lord led rebecca to the well at the evening time the same angel of the lord has moved upon our heart and said it's water time it's path to glory time it's time to go get water it was moving in our heart it was a supernatural sounding that was calling us home rebecca went to the well like any other day you came to this church like any other church but something begins to happen what is it there was a supernatural sounding a voice maybe that you couldn't hear but it was calling you oh glory be to god you see this is why paul would pick it up and he would write great is the myth this is a great mystery of christ in the church because to recognize the choosing of god upon our life we see the types in the scripture joseph being a type of christ he was rejected of his brother thrown in a pit but raised up and exalted to the right hand no one more powerful in the kingdom of egypt than joseph except for pharaoh himself but at a time when he was away from his brethren they were still his brethren he was away from them but during this time that he was away this was a time he was also it came to a place that now he takes a gentile bride and as he takes that that gentile blood this is a type of where here that the jews themselves they did not submit to the righteousness of god they could not understand that expression sure there was a remnant a small little church that was there we read about it even in the book of acts and then we see simeon we see anna we see the different ones but remember for the whole of it they rejected them they were blinded for our sakes that you and i might be brought in but we see that the day itself upon the gentiles is closing we realize we're living in a time the handwriting's on the wall we are found weighed in the balances and wanting it's a time right now where the gospel is getting ready to turn back to the jews where god is finishing up a bright body you see when you think of it this whole mystery here the very the very bible itself we know that the bible itself being that of the book of redemption that how that even the scriptures he would open with a marriage and the bible itself would close with a marriage it would open with that union between adam and his bride his bride that came forth from his side and we see then in the book of revelations where it is closed out with the marriage of the bride where it would say in revelations 19 let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb is come it speaks of where that christ himself has been making up his bride body they were always a seed a seed of god but it took the spirit of god to bring us in position in the body where we belong hallelujah because this age is not the entire body this age is a part that comes together with the entire body is that right oh my there's a responsibility upon our upon because the bride has been made up of all down through the ages where god has been building but to think of this in in this measure this is the really where the real the real uh a difference is in the choosing of god because to remember when we look at this of a husband and a wife and you think of it in terms that the bible says let the wife reverence her husband well it didn't say reverence an idea reverence a thing reverence a creed no no no the husband is a person the wife is a person and that husband and wife it speaks of the relationship that's to be had that relationship that is to be had they themselves when that union takes place it affects everything is that right the bride when the bride you know i know this nowadays we got things that's all all together different you know but you know in this time and age that we're living in you find that a time to where when when a man would ask a woman to marry him in proposal and she accepts that here they come into engagement and here they come into marriage ceremony then just like rebecca she leads the land of her nativity and she comes to dwell in the land of his nativity what happens there is a change of address there is a change from where she's dwelling she no longer is living at the address when the courtship started but all she's changed addresses and that's the same way it is when the holy ghost has come when christ has revealed himself as our husband this word has revealed itself this is my maid what does it do it brings a change of location we're in the same flesh but our soul has been translated from under the power of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son that relationship it what came it was revealed by the person himself our husband oh that's greater than any anointing upon a spirit is that right brother brahman said there can be an emotion an anointing upon the spirit but yet that life that soul is still not sealed away but when that soul has been sealed away god's daughter on the inside that's when the love of the world it's passed away and they're walking in the word for their day not just a good person doing good things i don't think anybody in here would you know would disagree or would say uh you know i don't want nobody who's a good moral person working next to me on the job no we appreciate all that but you recognize the righteousness of god is so much deeper and so much greater than good morality if it would have been good morality jesus could have stopped and not even went to the cross but remember righteousness is that where the life of god righteousness itself comes to fulfill the purpose of god that's real righteousness so it would require the wife herself that which is on the inside to actually catch that expression that revealing of the husband oh my aren't you glad you caught that little samuel how did i catch it how did i do it it wasn't this right it was this down here it caught it now notice the scripture goes on to say in romans 8 8 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god they that are in the flesh my it sounds like they're in a prison in the flesh and you can look around and say well i'm still dwelling in flesh but the difference is your soul has changed locations you've been united you see you've got removed just you move from the book of life to the lamb section lord be to god who moved you there he did he came down and took you unto himself he came down and began to reel him reveal himself not just as your savior not just as your lord not just as a prophet not just as a good man but this word came and revealed to you and i i am your hisha your husband and you are my pride you were ordained to bring forth my image into this earth you are ordained to reflect me in this generation you ordained i've chosen your womb that seed on the inside to bear my image my life my nature in this generation we were like that little woman we didn't have much all the rest of those on the ranch when the sun came down and to pick out a bride all the rest of them had nice fine dresses and everything else but he came down he didn't see a character in any one of those he wanted to unite with him coming down him coming down coming to the ranch it didn't change their character oh my we could preach right here but him coming down in that ranch you know what he did it revealed the character that was in her you could look at it and say my why aren't the rest of him it's responding the way she did because it was the foreign nation of god in her life as far as by looks he could have passed her up but it was the character what she was doing when his presence was there so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god notice this this word please it means this word please it deals with through the idea of like an exciting emotion not something that's of you know dread or or grudge or oh man yeah brother samuel saying this and oh my you know i don't know why the message says this and i don't i'll tell you the scripture you know i i don't i don't i just think they need to get up to date it means to strive to please to accommodate oneself to the opinions desires and interests of another see god looks on the heart god just don't look at an outward emotion an outward emotion can jump run speak in tongues be religious that's what brother brahma says concerning that in thinking man's filter but to think about it of how that when we we look at this we know that the word of god how god looks deep into our life to where he'll look at the very motives and objectives of our life just just listening to you know how many times you listen to a message and then all of a sudden something just stands out to you brother tells us in the message desperation how that hannah was there in you know in in the temple and she was crying out she wanted a child she was asking god for a child brother brahman said you know he said god heard the desperation that was within hannah he saw within hannah that there was a desire in her life that was not selfish it was an unselfish desire he said so god just didn't give her a child he just didn't give her a son he gave her a prophet all glory you see god knew the desire that would be in our life brother god just didn't call us to a church but god gave us a prophet god gave us the holy ghost the spirit of truth because he knew what caliber of seed was down there on the inside not a sea that would move in church and live a different life on the outside but he knew there was seed down here there are seed that's just like my kind and when i can move to that place in their life they will reflect by nature it'll be a paradox from carnal minded to spiritual man to accommodate ourselves to one interest you know the bible says you're familiar with the scripture where it lets us know it's impossible it's impossible to please god without faith let me just let me just drop drop drop this in here your journey faith itself there's got to be a starting point the bible says it's by grace through faith you see you always had faith you had faith when you go out and start your car and it works by faith but you see your faith it had to be moved in that of a living god there's only one could do that and that was him so it was grace grace that was issued to you and i grace that would come to be able to cause our faith to rise even in repentance it was it was a journey of faith so i want you to understand this that it all begins in that journey where a person would start on a journey and you know you can look at that scripture and say well those that are in the the karma in the flesh they cannot please god but you see when a person is walking by faith and they're walking in all the light that god has revealed to them and all that god is opening and showing then they are pleasing god with the purpose that their faith itself would come to a place to where god would seal that faith or recognize that faith as he did abraham's faith and that seal is the baptism of the holy ghost what paul was dealing with right here that while a person is in their flesh a person can try you know doing everything they can or when i say everything they can they're they're they're trying to do everything in their own abilities in their own way it's like that young man that brother man talked about bill graham said he's trying his best in his intellect he'll never ever be able to overcome it it'll take christ coming into him when he surrenders and he says this i love this he said when he surrenders he's already overcome then the surrender is where overcoming takes place it's the same thing it was in the garden of gethsemane now notice this here in journey in verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit oh my if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his oh my we've been you've been caught away still walking in this same flesh body but you've been caught away you've already experienced a resurrection you've already experienced a rapture we're waiting for the rapture that that's sweeping down for the very change of our body but there's already been a catching away the earnest has already come to your life the earnest is the down payment that there's more to come so you're no longer in the flesh but he says you're in the spirit it is it is so be that the spirit of god dwell in you and if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his so it's no longer us it's no longer us brother brown would would continue to place this throughout the message he said it's not us when we've received the holy ghost it's not us controlling the holy ghost but now it is the holy ghost controlling us it's not us leading god but it's god leading us you know so many times some people tell to god lord this is what i want but god remember god will not override self-will you see a person can come and ask you know they say i need bread but are they willing to ask are they willing to say you know what the truth is i don't got no bread and i really need bread you know what that requires that requires humble pie i you know what i ain't got no bread i need some bread uh i could could you give me a piece of bread instead of just saying you know what hey i need bread but it requires humility when you have to actually express what you lack and this is what i need god wants honesty he wants integrity god wants genuine confession and repentance i tell you what god will not stay away from repentance there was a man by the name of ahab that god already pronounced judgment on his house and that guy got down and repented and put sackcloth and ashes and god said you know what because you've done this i went you won't see it fulfilled in your generation but it will take place afterwards repentance moves the heart of god now i want you to look at this here let's try to you know try to bring this down in philippians chapter 2 verse 5 this is where paul would write let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross oh my god think of this how that the mercy of god that god would bring this mind into you and i it's not our natural mind it's not a natural mind he's talking about but we needed a different mind we need it as the scriptures would write a renewing of our mind paul would write clearly we were alienated from the presence of god by wicked works in our mind he's speaking of that nature of that soul so the request or the invitation would be let this mind which was in christ be in you also who thought it not robbery to be equal with god he was in the form of god but he took upon the form of a servant look what humility was manifested in this mind so contrary to the carnal mind right the carnal mind in that hour had the messiah coming down golden staircase all the trees are going to clap their hands the hills will skip they had their ideas that was scripture they had their ideas but you see god did it in such a simple way that it bypassed all the intellect of man it went right over the smart people's heads it went over the people's heads that could read they could pronounce everything just right it went right over their heads and it came right into a man's heart that couldn't even read his name if it was wrote on a boxcar amen came to peter came to andrew came to different ones let's stop here it moved upon their lives i tell you when this spiritual mind has moved into a life the contrast when we look at even jacob and esau great contrast between them esau was a good good man oh he was a good guy helped his daddy you know went and got venison for him you know if we could say it wiped his mouth you know when a little bit of venison grease was coming around he was a good good guy jacob was a shyster down beneath all of that on the inside beneath all them business deals beneath all the rest of that there was a real prince of god now he heard he heard you know his daddy talk about all the promises but you see there was something that his daddy did not put within him even though esau was the first one to come out of the womb he was the firstborn he was the one to whom all of the covenants and all the blessing the first blessing was to it was to esau so you would look at with jacob and you would say jacob why is your life wrapped in wanting to get that birthright do you know you ain't got a fighting chance esau was born before you why is this why is that the only thing you can talk about you see i understand maybe for some you didn't you wasn't that you were talking about a birthright but there was something in your heart there's got to be a god somewhere there's a truth there's got to be truth somewhere you've seen a lot of things you said brother samuel what was that the foreknowledge of god taking place it was taking place you may not have known the the the holy ghost you know and heard even terms let alone new bible stories but god didn't call you because you knew bible stories god didn't call you because you had all the stickers on the sunday school chart that is not what god that's not why god calls you and i but god calls us that what he did through jonah what he did through moses what he did through joseph what he did through rahab what he did through ruth that same christ he comes to manifest that same living reality through you and i who am i who am i a life that would submit to him where he would say will you will you be my wife will you be my bride i've been watching you for a long time lord i've only been walking here on this earth for 33 years yeah but i've known you before time you were in my mind as a matter of fact when i thought of becoming tangible that's when i thought of you i've longed for this day to come that i might express and reveal myself to you you see you did not know that you were ordained to be my bride you did not know that you ordained to be my wife but i knew you i never lost sight of you i knew nothing could get you out of my sight but i came to you and i brought you what could you say about god's mind he's determined i said he's determined he didn't let nothing stand in his way the fall came in eden is that i'll give you a seat i'll make a way back here came noah god of drunk god said i'm still coming for you glory be to god there is nothing you see what it was when you look at that these god never allowed any of that any of the faults and failures and mistakes of man to hinder his program or his plan but god said in the midst of that i will show my glory i have always loved you i chose you before creation and i come to bring you to myself you've always wondered who you were wondered why you didn't fit in wondered why things were strange wonder why you couldn't go anywhere else it's because of the four nation my choosing of your life you were always a son and daughter of god but you see the only way you'll know who you are it takes one of your kind to let you know an eagle looking at a chicken don't make an eagle but when an eagle sees an eagle something just rises up if god was minded like that before i believe he's minded like that tonight and i believe every son and daughter of god spiritually minded been born of the spirit of god even if god's dealing on your life right now i want you to understand this in this capacity it's god's determination at work in your life he said i've got you in the palm of my hands no man can pluck you out you love him tonight let's stand together oh hallelujah let's pray together heavenly father lord jesus sometimes lord we come into these places and lord thank you just doesn't seem seem like enough but i'm reminded lord that there was ten lepers nine of them went ahead and went on lord i know they were they were excited they were thankful they never they never had to be without the camp or without the city they could go back to their families go back to different but there was one oh he was rejoicing but he turned back and he came bowing and worshipped and he said thank you what i know this isn't thanksgiving day on the calendar but really every day is to thanksgiving real believer we are so thankful lord so thankful for what you've done for us lord in our lives or the strength that you've placed within us the lord wherein that we at one time walked with that of a carnal mind the lord god the grace of god has moved down lifted us from the bondage of the carnal mind lord to be moved by that same mind that was in christ jesus to be spiritual minded as sons and daughters of god lord just as you were minded determined to bring this redemption to us i believe dear god that that same life moving within us it brings that same determination or as your prophet would put it desperation dear god we're no longer walking after the flesh walking after the spirit lord i pray tonight you know where each and every one of us are at the lord i ask dear god that as you have come lord and minister to our hearts your god truly when there's a heart that desires to move into that realm they could not have that desire first of all if you didn't put it in them and for them to be able to ask for it you would express that they've heard from you now lord when a person has heard from you then they can get desperate because they know that you've spoken personally to their hearts the lord i ask tonight dear god i know that i we speak there's those lord that's in journey they're following lord god the word of what you have laid out for them but i pray dear god that within everything may they lord just realize the simplicity of that surrender it grows greater and where they just lay everything lord god before you lord if there's a request in a heart maybe there's a lord a need that's there in that life things that lord that they really desire your help lord i pray right now that you would just minister grace to them anything that would have a hold in their life maybe it's relationship maybe it's lord god some sin i pray god right now that may the grace of god move up to them and just manifest the love of god and lord such a greater measure to their heart than that hold that's upon their life that god that they would relinquish that and see that is a no comparison that's in no comparison to the living god who's speaking to my heart granted lord may you move lord move god by your spirit brood upon that life as you've been brooding on that hard lord and i pray dear god that lord to recognize lord in this hour where we are at where we are living what a thanksgiving it is lord god lord to be able to see we're no longer walking by a carnal mind but to be spiritual minded lord we need your help we need your strength every day we don't want to get caught or stuck in that carnal realm at all but oh god may we live under the influence the inspiration your god of the spiritual mind help us we pray lord i commit the congregation commit lord every heart every life lord into your hands dear god whatever the need is lord we know that god that you're jehovah jireh you're more than able and god you're willing to meet that need you're determined in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you tonight brother brian come and meet us yes oh is this is god is oh oh this is my song my is
