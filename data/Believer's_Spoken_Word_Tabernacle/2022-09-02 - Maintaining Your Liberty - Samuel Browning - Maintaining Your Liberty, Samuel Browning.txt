strengthen them and touch them give them strength and so just as they as it comes to you and taking it before the Lord in prayer let's continue remember them in prayer the Lord will just continue to strengthen them I want to just say just appreciate your prayers we were there in Mexico and we were going back and forth actually I stayed in Texas but I was going back and forth into Mexico right across the border each time to go in for the services and just the Lord just just met wondrously just the reports and reports and continuing just come in from the services of What the Lord Has Done for his people and um I just I'm just thankful amen for that I'm thankful to be back home just thankful for your prayers I know it was the prayers of the Saints and I could just sense it just as I was was going from here and then when we sat down there and heading into that first service and just such a liberty just came and just moved right there and just the Lord ministered right from the get-go to many needs and so it just it's just I you were a part of it you are part of all along and I want to say God bless you you may not see those brothers and sisters on this side but we get to the other side you you were part of it wasn't just me standing there we're depending on him it's God working through a body amen so you are part of that and I want to just say God bless you amen and they brother Benito asked me to the congregation there asked me to greet you and just to extend their their greetings to you as well so we just want to look into the word of the Lord and as we're turning to Galatians chapter 5 tonight I'm just going to read a verse of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats I want you to remember brother Nathan Erickson will be here this coming Sunday the Lord willing and then um the following weekend we're having Services here brother Trevor Eman and remember he he was here in January and spoke for us and just a wonderful service and we have that morning service and then we're going to have the youth service and I'm just asking you to be as you are in prayer for every service but just praying that God will just move in a very special way amen we we desire to see the Lord just move and I just appreciate your support in that I know the young people do I'm going to be here pulling and just to just to get behind it amen so I just I want to say I appreciate that as well um I don't think there's any other announcements if there is somebody can slip me a note but let's look into the word of the Lord tonight in Galatians chapter 5 and verse 1. Paul's writing here to the galatian church Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage I just like to speak just a few moments tonight on maintaining your Liberty and may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated in second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 17 Paul would speak of this this of Liberty it says now now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and I believe that that's the desire of our hearts is that the spirit of the Lord would be welcome here in the congregation welcome in our homes cars on and on but most importantly is that he's here because where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and so how important it is what brings Liberty is the preaching of the Gospel not just reading of a scripture or reciting it but brother Branham was very clear about this as Paul would say that our word that our gospel came not to you in word only but it came through Power and demonstration that as the word itself was being ministered the word was going forth as a sharp two-edged sword and it was cutting away diseases cutting away sin because the word is creative and the thing that we we look at and remember is that in anything that takes place in our life that is of god it's not because of what we have done it's because of God's creative power working in our lives we everything that we that has taken place we can go clear back to Genesis one with it it's the same way God speaks his word the presence of God comes down moving behind that word and it's God who brings forth creation brings forth those things that we have in our life or those things that we desire think about brother Branham I begin to just this quote is something that I think on very often have come back to over the years and I just was thinking of it just the other day was praying and that is at the end of recognizing your day and its message and brother Branham makes a statement and he says he says God let me be the Revival let that Revival be in me and he makes this statement he says Lord create in me what is lacking because it's it's things that you and I can see as we look into the word but we need him and invite him God you come and create what I'm lacking create that desires let your life pass by and stir up because you know what I need Lord and there's a longing in my life but you know and I I'm inviting you Lord that you'll come and create in me what is lacking in my life Lord and this is where Paul is is speaking to us where the spirit of the Lord is that's real Liberty real true Liberty goes more than just having Liberty of the house of God we thank God for that because that Liberty itself will point you and direct you to that Liberty that belongs to you as the Son and Daughter of God because the real word Liberty means to be what you really are you are always the Son and Daughter of God but you are under and under a bondage under you know you can you can try to live it and try to go through this but there's a liberty that only can come through and by the spirit of almighty God coming down into the depths of your soul and he brings forth the transformation and that same God that's brought forth that transformation that Supernatural work then Paul says in verse 18 we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord is dealing with us looking at and beholding God's working looking in the word as it was in there in Israel they would take that of like the brass plates and that was the mirrors that they would look at and be holding they would look in there and that's what Paul says when we are looking we're not beholding another we are beholding the glory of the Lord and the reality is is that all we have to do is behold be captivated and there's so many things to distract us and try to take our time and try to take our mind thoughts and everything else Satan is after to try to pull us away from his presence but the scripture has its so beautifully stated with an open face beholding us in a glass the glory of the Lord as we're beholding him beholding him we are changed into the same image from glory to glory even is by the spirit of the Lord because the image that's been set before you and I is not a lifeless image it's the person of Jesus Christ that's who we're beholding that's who we're having fellowship with when you're praying and not just on your knees but when you're praying through the day when you're listening to the message when you're into the scriptures you're walking through the stores you're riding in your car and you're talking to you're fellowshipping with him you're meditating on him you are beholding with an open face the glory of the Lord and though you may not feel it but you recognize his presence and there's a love on the inside there's a there's a joy from having Liberty that is is unexplainable it's it's Indescribable because it's God and you cannot describe God but it's just a liberty to where you know that there's no strings attached to your life that what was once you were yoked to now the spirit of God has come by your way and let you know hey look at your ankle like Johnny Crowe was always tied to the fence and he always walked that fence and walked that fence but somebody came and loosened him he kept walking that fence but one day somebody came along and pointed out to him hey you don't have to walk this way no more there you are free and God lets you and I look into our lives and recognize that Liberty that has come to you and I and that Liberty that has lifted us above our natural birth what Grace is this what Liberty and we are changed into the same images from glory to glory even it's by the spirit of the Lord the Bible says in John 5 24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life he that heareth my word understandeth my word to take that into and they'll hear an understanding of the word of God let me just say it like this it isn't about understanding all the p's and q's but hearing the word is being able to hear his voice and to know he's speaking to you to know that it's God speaking personally to you that there's more than a man that's present in the building that the Living God is present right here among us because a man's word can't do that to you but God's word when you can recognize that it's God that's here in our midst that it's God that's speaking to you and I don't say it like this that if if you can't see that yet I'll Stand and I'll pray for you I'll pray for others say God open their eyes that they can see Lord that it's you that's here that there's more for them than there is against them there's a God who is present who always was he's present right here Among Us notice this is part of that Liberty that is passed from Death unto life in Romans 8 chapter chapter 8 verse 1 and 2 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit notice not walking after this flesh but after the spirit seeking to do those things that please him there's no condemnation for the law of the spirit of Life In Christ hath not set me free hath made me free this is a creative work of the power of almighty God because if he sets you free you'd be the same person you always were is that right but he comes to make you free that's that's the whole theme of The Gospel is the creative power of almighty God that has come forth to make you a new creation in Christ Jesus so for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death in John 8 36 if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed now remember this was something that the the the religious in that day had a problem with they looked at their garments or to say the vesture of their birth had come out of Abraham I'm of Abraham's lineage what do you mean that that I need to be made free what do you under they didn't unrecognize that though everything that was given was looking forward to the real perfect sacrifice and you still needed to be made free there had to come a freedom and they weren't free and this is where the word come to speak to them and let them know that if the son shall make you free you shall be free indeed Beyond imagination not something that's just in our mind but but a reality that I'm free I'm no longer the same person that I used to be God has changed my life he's the theme of my life he's the one that I seek to please the one that I desire to serve it's his word that there is a life on the inside that can say Amen to every word of God even when I can look at it and say Lord I say man to the word help me to become what I'm seeing Lord don't back away from it because the word is here to change us that's part of our Liberty that's part of maintaining Liberty is when the spirit of God comes by and he deals with our life submit to him right there because it is your Liberty as a son and daughter of God and the spirit of God sweeps right down to bring change in your life things that you've taught you would never be able to override but the spirit of God comes and energizes you from another Realm you're made free by the Sun it says why I want to come to as we spring from here in Psalms 119 45. and I will walk at Liberty for I seek thy precepts now in maintaining our Liberty you can see where Israel when they'd come into the land here we've looked at that of Jericho they had to follow the word remember God gave them Direction that the word is what was going to lead the way not their feelings but the word you can't get around the word the word must be first and God let them know that the ark has got to come before you the word has got to come before you this is why this is a scriptural principle seek ye first the kingdom of God putting God first above whatever desire whatever ambition let me tell you something you cannot even imagine the blessings that come with putting God first and we are always we are always not just from the beginning but always that testing comes in our life of putting God first but there's always Victory when the word is first because Victory only comes by the word so when they followed the word they put the ark forth in here the priests are carrying it their victory was certain as long as they followed the word of the Lord that God remember God had spoke to Joshua regarding the leadership into the battle Jericho he gave Direction so the word itself spake now I want you to look at this in Joshua chapter 6 and verse 17. now this is coming into this moment of Victory and it's promised it's certain of Jericho and here's what God speaks to the children of Israel in verse 17 and the city shall be accursed even in and all that are therein to the Lord only Ray at the Harlot shall live she and all that are with with her in the house because she hid The Messengers that we sent she received that message she had heard and because she was ordained alive God seen to it that the word got to her and the word that came to her it led her across her Red Sea the word came to her and opened the Jordan for her the word came and made a way for her to move from that of bondage of just Desiring oh I I just I want to know that God but because that desire was there and God coming near that desire began to rise and God sent Messengers with the message that would match and correspond and dovetail like that laundry ticket and it would release Rahab she was no longer she didn't have to go to five steps on how to be a better woman ten steps she didn't join a church class she met the Living God that's the difference between the Reformation of man because it's man trying to reform man but when God comes on the scene God brings forth a transformation in a person's life and God knew just exactly where she was at Verse 18 and ye in any wise well God's speaking here to Israel keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest you make yourselves accursed the government say I'm going to move the curse thing out of the way but you keep yourselves from it lest ye make yourselves a curse when you take of the accursed thing and make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the Lord they shall come into the treasury of the Lord so it's putting the word first now remember the word had come down in the form of a man Joshua was out praying and the same Pillar of Fire the same one that spoke to Abraham the same one that came down in Eden and walked in the cool of the evening the same God that met Moses there in the burning bush the same God that led them and opened the Red Sea was a pillar of cloud with a knight and a cloud of Light by day that same God that was veiled there the whole time now when it came to the Crossing into the land that same God who was veiled in that Pillar of Fire now he steps down in the form of a man and he announces I am come as captain of the Lord's host I've come you see when God brings them into the land god just doesn't drop us off and say just go ahead and go on your own I mean go ahead you you know what to do but you see God is an ever-present God because the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is not something of his presence moving on you and then lifting off of you but he said I will go with you I will be with you even until the end of the age why because yet place inside of your life that seed is God's reserved place for himself just as much as the word here is reserved for God to come and fulfill it man cannot fulfill it man cannot do it but it takes God coming on the scene to fulfill his word and that part of himself he placed in us that seed that predestinated part is Jehovah Jireh providing for himself he provided a place that he can come into that's why it's not you believing it's God in you believing his own word so it's not you know we believe it but but even when like as Paul said even when you know that when I'm not when I I'm not uh uh I can't think of the exact words maybe um I'm not as uh faithful or I can't think of the exact word but he said he abideth faithful that's the power of the new birth you can never get away from God you can't because there's no desire to get away from God you can look at yourself and say well I failed him right I want to be a better Christian I should of course there's that desire in your life and God gives us Grace helps us that we recognize that it's God it's not my effort you need it's my surrender that you need that's what God allows us to come to situations in our life and we're trying to do different things I I just you know when I was on the trip here I had a text come in from an individual not that don't come here but the and a text come in and you know and and they send it in it's from a family member and they sent it to me and I I'm reading through and I've been talking with them and working with them and I said I think one thing you're trying to do you're trying to they're wanting you know what I I want this to do and I want this to change in my life I said you're getting the cart before the horse you're trying to do take principles and try to change your life it's not principles that'll change your life you need to meet Jesus Christ you need to surrender your life he said in his word if you seek me with all your heart I will be found of you he's a person the word had become flesh here and he gave Direction notice the same God veiled as captain of the Lord's host that same God now when that word has been given Joshua comes back into the camp he's veiled with the presence of God and he begins to give forth the word of the Lord remember bear to follow the ark right and the word is spoken that word has spoken because remember you can't change God's nature what God what was in that Ark that was God's nature God never said the law was evil he said the law was holy the law can never establish that Holiness but through Jesus Christ the law has been established in our hearts because it's not a work of man it's not us struggling and I'm trying to get this right now no it's surrendering and he comes down with his finger and he brings transformation in our life changing our desires to match his nature he said I'll write my laws in your heart and in your minds and because of that I remember your iniquity no more why because you're a new creation That's The Power of this of this Liberty that same God veiled there now as the children of Israel think of this Israel Moving they themselves now it's God veiled in their lives marching around Jericho Joshua had this here it's God being God has always veiled he's always behind the veil right he's always behind the veil because one what Moses spoke later became behind the veil what God revealed to Joshua became behind the veil they became the manifestation of that meeting that Joshua had with the captain of The Lord of hosts and it wasn't just some letter they received they received an unction of the spirit of God that overrode their reasoning he gave them strength when the scoff was coming off the walls and all their minds could say a trumpet's going to knock this wall down but there's a strength that is not natural and Joshua had as brother Brown called it his v-day when he met the captain of the Lord's host and the plan was revealed that's the real Victory right there that's where the pressure is let off but you could just recognize his presence you know sometimes it's not that he dismantles the situation he dismantles the trial but it's just his presence when his presence comes when he just comes by and just speaks to your heart maybe tonight and just encourage you by his word it just gives you strength in the midst of it he don't take away the circumstance and everything like that he can do that but he gives you strength I'm so glad about that aren't you I'm glad about that you see Joshua had put the word first and this is where that within that as they moved around that wall and they came around there that seventh time they probably no doubt didn't feel nothing but then that seventh time brother Brown said that's when the spirit moved in that's when the spirit of God came in in that seventh time now I could preach on dice but I'm not going to do that right now it moved in and the walls fell down now notice in Joshua 7 because I want to really lay this in with the maintaining of our Liberty in Joshua 7 here it speaks of the the the the the the after part or that which takes place in that victory of Jericho but the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for Aiken the son of karma the son of zabdiad the son of Zara of the tribe of Judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel now this didn't come to light nobody knew about it until the next battle and with the next Battle of AI came around instead of instead of Israel standing Victorious they were running now Joshua when he goes on and he calls a fast and Joshua gets before God because God has made a promise there's not going to be one man be able to stand before you so Joshua was looking at what's going on what's wrong something is wrong right I want to just kind of move beyond that tonight and come into a place that the Lord just just speaking to my heart upon these things tonight and I want to go into this that even of the part of where it's been uncovered that here it is with with Aiken and it has he is standing here in this time and how that Joshua in chapter in verse 19 of chapter 7 Joshua says unto Aiken my son give I pray thee glory to the Lord God of Israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou has done hide it not from me and he can answer Joshua and said indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel and thus and thus have I done when I saw The Spoils of a goodly babylonious garment and 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of 50 shekels of weight then I coveted them and took them and behold they are HID in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it now I want you to notice this Aiken is rehearsing what happened when I saw now in order to see it this describes us more than just that of a visualize remember the woman standing there in the Garden of Eden when the woman saw that the tree was good for food it entered in you see that very word that saw it entered in into the mind Satan began to move upon the mind be trying to pull through the emotions this is why that we are not to stop to listen to Satan at all when I saw you could have seen no doubt everybody else could say I I seen different things but they turned because it wasn't just like that Aiken happened to be the lucky dog of the bunch and he saw a babylonious garment Miss stuff was all over but when I saw then I coveted it notice the print notice the progression of sin it starts with entertaining it then once it's entertained I coveted it it's been a conceiving and I took it you could have never took it unless at first had come in and saw it and begin to covet it but oh if Aiken in that moment think of this if Aiken in that moment could have just just just looked out to God and said Lord strengthen me Lord Jesus I want to walk with your word you spoke in your word of what we were to do you even brought it present so it could be applied in this battle knowing what we were going to face Lord give me strength you think the other Israelites didn't do that they weren't superhuman no more than you and I are but what it was is in the midst of the battle they heeded to the word following the word did not stop when the walls fell down oh my so many times we lose Victory because once it comes we'll pull back oh you're getting quiet on me now things are going real good we pull back on prayer we pull back on really digging in you know and really just look into the Lord things going real good man everything's set at the job everything's p's and q's and this and that and my just something God says you know what you're leaning too much on yourself hello somebody I'm talking about maintaining our Liberty because our Liberty we do not maintain it by going out on our own our Liberty is in Christ Jesus it's through him and when we are beholding his face that's where we receive the strength and Victory all right glory be to God Hallelujah the Bible says in James 1 let's look at this let's dive into it a little bit let's bring it down into our lives the Bible said in verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him everyone must be tested tempted and tried and Satan is going to try to test you and tempt you with things that you have even already overcome even as a young Christian there's things he can whisper into your ear Stay With Me Now that does not mean that that desire is still there it's Satan trying to tempt you but blessed is the man that endureth you know what that says endureth it just it steadfast in patience just waiting yes enduring because you're being battled and battle is coming at you to aching was being tempted but he didn't endure let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so it all starts when I saw taking taking it in taking in a thought brother Brown would put it so simple as this taking a thought in that is against the word character of the word you know it may not be that Satan's quoting to you things that oh you could say well I know that right there in the scripture or not but it might be coming against the very character because remember the word is a person right there's things that he can whisper to you try to tell you about your brother tell you about your sister tell him about this and tell them about that but remember we do not want to take that from that of the enemy we want to bring it right back in line with God's word is that right when it's finished it bring it for Death Do not air or go astray my beloved Brethren so if it comes into the mind and is entertained turn it down that's why brother Brown said don't stop to listen remember the little lady who God had delivered her from dancing delivered her from the music and she got to saying well that you know that don't bother me no more but everybody said oh no you just think it don't and she got over there around you know she crossed the street and started walking on that side of the street and she got over there and the next thing she knows she's on the dance floor in a man's arms because what happened she got to reminiscing and she thought it didn't affect her but she snapped me right there had something that snaps right on the dance floor and she runs there and makes Headway to get to brother random and said brother random brother around help me help me I'm lost I'm lost help me help me remember I'm saying you're not lost but he recognized there was a spirit that had come in there are you saying are you hearing me now and the brother random was able to discern that and he said now this is my sister you turn her loose and you know what happened that spirit rose up out of there with long hair and everything else and I mean just like a baton and that drunk guy he became sober very quick it was a spirit you say brother the same man what are you saying well I tell you what he's saying is that thoughts are not just empty random words it's spirits [Applause] that's why when you entertain them you know listen when you entertain them it's going to make you feel one way or the other now you can sit here and say I don't have feelings but that ain't true when the word is coming your way and the Holy Spirit is speaking to you there's a liberty there is strength that comes but when the enemy goes you'll you'll start feeling it it's vexing it's troubling it's depressing because why it's spirits is that right what do I do stop it right away stop it you've got Authority you've got authority to do it because remember brother Brown would say it like this over and over and and I'll just just to really drop this I'm feeling impressed with on that is that do you understand you can be tempted I know that's not a news flash but yet it is temptation is not sin heeding your temptation is sin you can all be tempted now listen every one of us when we are tempted you don't feel good about it let a thought or anything else come into your mind or whatever more you don't feel clean you don't feel good about it but it's a Temptation and what's it doing it's pulling almost two other parts of your life that are not redeemed your flesh and your spirit and Satan wants you to act in those realms but your Liberty is not from those realms your Liberty is from within as you bring those other Realms subject that's your Liberty that's your jurisdiction as Sons and Daughters of God the scripture says let me hurry here in Hebrews chapter 2 he was made God came down and was made of faithful and merciful High faithful to the word right it was the word made flesh and he was merciful one who was able to understand you and I to go through the experiences that we go through I love this for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted anybody ever suffered being tempted sure tempting can be it can be suffering things can it can there's so many different forms friends just don't limit it to one thing it can be so many things do you realize even when a sickness will come do you know sickness and diseases it's tormenting spirits they would like to try to he tries to come up on when somebody's dealing with something to worry them that's why when you're praying for different ones that are going through sickness going through things pray also that God gives them strength in their spirit and their mind not just touch their body because it's a tormenting spirit that wants to just weaken them they're fighting they're battling but hey we're brothers and sisters together if one feels this way if this hand feels pain then the rest of the body feels pain right glory be to God you see he has suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted same very plain brother Brown let us know in the deity of Jesus Christ and put it very clearly Jesus was tempted to take the kingdoms without suffering he was tempted to do that but he stayed the course he relied on the word In the Heat of the battle he didn't give down on the word are you hearing me brother Ram uses those terms In the Heat of the battle Temptation it's the heat of the battle and Satan's desire is to try to get you to let down on the word but the word is your weapon and that weapon will defeat Satan anywhere anytime any place and let me just tell you something when the weakest Christian not the strongest one but when the weakest Christian will go to their knees you might be on the job and you can't fall to your knees but inside you can say Lord You're my refuge you're my help Lord God I'm talking about soldiers that are maintaining their Liberty and knowing that God is an ever-present help in the time of trouble oh if Aiken would have just called out Lord help me give me the strength Lord to just turn my head forgive me Lord for entertaining that thought that was Aiken's responsibility in the assembly nobody else could do it for him his wife couldn't do it his mama couldn't do it his daddy couldn't do it he was his responsibility just like every one of us in this body have our own responsibility Before the Throne of God see we have an anchor that enters Paul said within the Veil there's times brother Brown said I'm just kind of skimming over some things that brown deals with in the Hebrew series there's times where the Bible says yeah and that he that is born of God does not commit sin commit means practice no longer a practicer why your desire has been changed but you can still make mistakes let me just let me just read it even how the prophet said it you'll make mistakes you'll fall he's not preaching Doom and Gloom but he's you know what this is this is rehearsal of what God told Joshua I'm going to remind you Joshua as I was with Moses I'm going to be with you I will not forsake you nor fail you you might get away from me but I ain't going to get away from you you might get away from my presence but my presence will come and hunt you down can't get to that tonight but you can you can't you because why there's no desire in our life to go back to the things of the world you'll make mistakes you'll fail he said sometimes you'llfully do wrong you'll go out and do things that don't mean your loss that means you're going to get correction my little boy my children will do things you know they do things against their rule your rules and they know what doesn't expect when they do it I guess they do right they're going to get a weapon for it sometimes a good one but it's still your child Hallelujah so your stumblings my stumblings and in the midst of Temptation does not change we are children of God oh you can say oh then I can just do whatever I want brother Brown said I always do what I wanted but if you're a Christian you don't want to do the thing that's wrong because the very life in you the very Foundation you don't want to do wrong and if you do it shows there's wrong in here how can bitter and sweet water come out of the same fountain but he says he that's born to God does not commit sin he has no desire to do sin you might say now let me just deal with this as it comes you might say brother Samuel but it feels like there's a pool that pool is upon your flesh and there's a war because the inside man does not want to do the things of evil it wants to please God but that flesh let me tell you something we pack him around feed him off for good we can tell about that we brush his teeth comb his hair if he got some we do all that man we treat him so good we buy him the best chairs massage and everything else and you know put the best vitamins in him but that guy in a one moment's notice Brother Ray he will side right against us don't you ever think that this guy is your buddy or your friend he will side against you in a moment you don't ever take him into a fight you've got the Lord on your side this gal turned coat in a minute [Applause] so the pool that's part of the Temptation not well well I guess no it's not well I guess it's part of the Temptation it's to recognize in that moment say oh Lord You Are My Strength Hallelujah absolutely my refuge notice the devil will trap him here and there but not willfully in about like traps anybody awake I hate traps I hate traps right I'm sure Bears here and he hate him too raccoons hate him you know possum hate him coyotes hate him there's traps that's made for him right and a trap is not something that visible a trump a trap is made where they take the sin off of it it looks like they're all their surroundings oh it's going to be a nice Friday morning praise God I got my latte it's Friday morning I'm going to reward myself for four days of hard work I'm gonna tell them to well anyhow and then all of a sudden here's something comes your way oh my and then you oh no what happened it was a trap but remember it was a trap and you're still a child of God what do I do get up dust your knees off and go on Lord forgive me Lord strengthen me help me Lord against that the next time because remember it would do no good to lay a trap Brother Ray if you walk up and down this aisle it would do no good for us to lay a trap over there because you're not going to walk over there same thing for you brother Sammy it's not you're going to do no good if you walk right here in the aisle it does no good to set a trap over there but traps are set based on our makeup that's are you hearing me Satan studies you oh my you think the government has files on you it's scary if you knew what the devil has on you he studies you oh yeah you think Live 360 on your phone something find my phone the devil knows exactly but there's one thing about it when we're Antichrist well he can touch this if he gets permission but you know what you can't touch this on the inside it's untouchable he tried to touch it but when he touches [Music] why there's a power on the inside [Applause] oh my mama don't you love him notice this let me just let me let me I'm trying to bring this down here in John chapter 14 the Bible says I will pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you notice the form is going to change it's going to change from son of man the Son of God to the supernatural and that had to be in order to pay the price of redemption to satisfy the requirements of the goel or of the Kinsmen Redeemer that that life could come back upon you and I so I'm not a different person you know well I received the Holy Ghost I didn't receive Jesus it's the same person it was God veiled in a body form God became one of us Jesus is not a different person come on friends when brother Branham uses to turn our big brother he's referring to the connotation of relationship that God became one of us not of a lesser person but God so condescended just like you read in Solomon and he says my dearest my love my sister it's a term of endearment God so became one of us that he became our brother a term of endearment I will not will come to you same God veiled in you he's our comforter our comforter is our paracletos one who is called to our Aid one who is our help one who is there as an advocate on our behalf one who is there to be our intercessor to intercede for us one who is there to open the word to you and I one who is there to strengthen you and I when the tests are trials or whatever comes our way he is our all in all I don't know my words just fail to describe it he's everything to us we're nothing without him it's him opening the word it's him giving us wisdom it's him sanctifying it's him it's him at work in our life he is our comforter and it's a comfort to know he's our comforter he's in US comforting Us by making his word live through us there's a liberty are you hearing me there's a liberty that is in him this is why in our life everybody say with me this is why we're talking about Temptation here let me just let me just descend on this point here and lay these lay these little last points in here you have to remember in your life in my life those opening scriptures we read passing from Death unto life scriptures regarding that of the creative power of God bringing about the New Birth you see it's a spirit of God that deals with your heart that calls you and I to confess and repent of our sins it was a spirit of God it's a spirit of God that comes that brings sanctification it's it is it's a spirit of God working in our life and the reason that is is because God's desire is to come to the throne of our heart so God is working in all of that it's not it's not you it's God that's working but to recognize it's him that's doing it and that is he moves into that innermost place in your life now remember he just won't do it he's got to be it's got to be given to him it's got to welcome him because remember he's not come that we would lead him he has come as captain of the Lord's host so we can quit anything you didn't quit nothing well I quit no you didn't quit it if you quit it then that was all you but we didn't quit anything brother Rand puts it like this and acts of the Holy Spirit he said I did not quit anything the Holy Spirit came in me and he quit so it wasn't wasn't our efforts that's that's the working of the power of God now notice he said then the Holy Spirit now notice once it's come he said it ain't what I've done it's what he done I didn't quit nothing he just come and took it out of me then the Holy Spirit abides in and grows daily it just grows making itself greater and greater not me not you making itself greater and greater it's growing it's pushing out now notice as it's doing this is part of maintaining our Liberty it pushes out the things the cares The Temptations there's things no doubt we could go through this congregation right here tonight that there's things that one time in Europe even in the beginning of your journey that you were tempted by I mean it was a hard temptation but God has given you Grace where you could be able to stand and testify that I have overcome that sure things can come thoughts can come and the devil can say well you only think you overcame that but you know I've overcome it because I'm not afraid of you no more [Applause] I ain't looking on my back no more I've overcome it because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world who did that for you God the Holy Spirit growing and abiding daily Lord be to God aren't you glad that God has sent us a word that we can grow as fat as calves in the storm I believe that kind of Fat's all right oh Lord have mercy it pushes out the things that cares the temptation as you overcome them the Holy Spirit takes its place and if you've got a real bad temptation of something that's not right overcome that thing a few times and watch if your testimony doesn't Bloom on account of it and I may not be real smart but I know if you're going to overcome it it's a battle so I want you to understand when the battle comes into temptation that it's not defeat that's the time to draw your sword that's the time to maintain Victory and Liberty in the midst of them and say this is coming my way but I'm more than a conqueror we're not just rehearsing a bunch of words come on friends this gospel is not just full of glory and power at the pulpit or in the house of God you are the house of God this gospel is full of power and glory in your life you got a right to draw your sword and stand right there when the Devil comes and said I ain't backing up I ain't backing up and matter of fact I ain't listening to your mouth sometimes we entertain his speaking what must I mean what should I do I just start worshiping the Lord that's what I do I'm just telling you what I do I'm telling you what I do I just turn worshiping the Lord I put on little music now I don't put on Nearer My God to thee I may put on something This Means War oh but Samuel that's all work up I would rather live in my victory of what you call work up then live to be down God has given us tools the Bible said he has encompassed me about with songs of Deliverance you know why songs music it works on the spirit man oh my don't tell me brother Brown how many times you did a spirit of God in in the in the prayer lines over and over he would tell the people you want to put on some good gospel music right he said Put it on he said Billy he said billy gets under that Gloom sometimes he said I told Billy you keep it playing in this trailer their office where they worked I know that's simple but I'm talking about maintaining our Liberty oh glory be to God you look at how Samson Samson you know he ran out there and hear the power of God come upon him and he smote that lion you know what he ended up doing after he smote that line he came back and there was honey in that carcass he ate honey out of what was a bad temptation he overcame it by what the power of God oh brother Samuel I'm not worthy of the power of God who told you that lie the same one that's tempting you is the same one telling you that lie you've got a right to invite the Lord Jesus if there's something that's out of line say Lord help me Lord God Lord give me strength that I can overcome this right now Lord God give me strength that I can turn my head you have a right to call Jesus on the sea rebuke that liar maintain your Liberty and Samson overcame it with the power of God brother man said if you've got safe you want to eat some sweet honey you just overcome it with the power of God oh he said maybe he says you've been a Drucker and every time you smell whiskey or beer you want to drink overcome it by the power of God pass by at one time and see what a feeling you got in your heart when the thing is Dead and Gone Dead all finished oh my there's sweet honey you get out of it I like honey don't you foreign I think of how that Paul you know is in the midst of it many times we we quote the scripture resist the devil and he will flee from you but we forget the very first part submit yourselves therefore unto God if Aiken would have just said Lord forgive me for these thoughts that I'm entertaining Lord these things I know what you've said in your word and I want to honor your word I'm pulled in this way but I want to honor your word Lord give me strength oh my remember the brown would say it like this and let me just come down here and close he says in Christ revealed in his own word he speaks of a young Minister and his wife that had been in the room just moments ago and he said both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world and the rest of human beings on earth now watch what he says about this he said I told them remember Satan's got a punch coming at you I don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch now look what he asked which would you rather that punch be to be blind arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous so he's just identified this nervousness is a punch that Satan is punching at him I want you to watch this we believe in Deliverance don't we but remember what what Deliverance is Deliverance is is where it's no longer ruling you you rule it Satan can stick up his head but you've got to remind him are you hearing me let me tell you something right now it's important with the people used to surround yourself with too if you get around a bunch of unbelievers and sometimes it isn't even unbelievers sometimes you can be around people who are believers but they themselves are so overcome and it's so negative right you're not dear Lord help me everything's negative it's picking out this I'm picking out that if there's one thing I hate I hate negativity I'm just be honest with you I don't have much of a time for everybody pulling out things oh this is wrong in the message and this is wrong and this is wrong well are you right are you God come on friends I'm not interested in that I'm sorry because we're talking to the redeemed of the Lord and if there is problems and there is situations I've Got Confidence that what we need is the Holy Ghost to flood down and not stand above everybody and this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong and this wrong and this is wrong and this is wrong I think we've got something else to preach we've got a gospel and a message to preach instead of picking people to pieces come on friends we've got a gospel that's liberating that's full of Glory it's full of power are you hearing me now let me just stop here and drop this you remember them fences that came up between them ducks remember that how'd they get rid of them fences well these like wire cutters no they didn't you know what happened stop focusing on the fences and let the water level rise when the water level Rose you could no longer see a fence and the Ducks got together that's the promise we're living in in this hour is the holy spirit do we have to call out wrong we do but I do not believe we've got to walk around negative and negative and negative we're looking at the wrong things if there should be anybody that's positive in the world it should be the Bride of Jesus Christ we've got a positive promise made by a positive God a positive token a positive record we have a positive message because God himself is Vindicated it and right here Among Us Lord have mercy we got enough negative around us oh my [Music] God you might be that might be you might be prone to be negative remember that's a punch that's coming at you then you got a choice you can be a punching bag or you can shield and block it that's true now let me finish reading this all right I got one remember Satan's got a Punch coming at you I don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which would you rather be that punch would you rather you be blind or be arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time who keeps it covered you me now brother Brian's just went through this blind arthritic sitting Hotel nervous we can go on and on you could but it's a punch that Satan's got to come in so I wonder sometimes if what were things that weren't prayed for now listen please don't read anything into this but I wonder sometimes if there's things that what we're doing and we're saying oh praise God and we leave out of the service and what God has done he has helped us strengthened us he has reminded us given us strength to get back up encouragement maybe we were so overwhelmed and then we go back and we do not cover that place whatsoever and then here it is a week later Days Later month later not covered you've got to maintain your Liberty and we must keep it covered I can't cover it for you wife can't your husband can't your Daddy Mom nobody can keep it covered you got to keep it coming a way that Satan might come and he'll come right at you to try to punch at you remember God gives us Grace and strength to keep the punches off us you love him tonight more we could more we could save it I think I think the Lord has has spoke to us the things that we would have need of tonight Hallelujah let's walk in the spirit like Paul could say in this and I'll just to close on this point Paul would admonish the people of God in the same chapter galatian Galatians 5. walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh that's not a maybe that's a cert and to walk in the spirit is our life just being under his influence remember he's right there with you you call him on the scene invite him in daily invite him to go with you don't go nowhere without he said over the summer he if I've been born of the spirit of God he can't leave me but invite him invite him Lord direct my day no matter where you're at in your journey right here this evening maintain whatever Liberty that God has given you this point because there is full Liberty for you if if you haven't come to that spot the same God is working with you is speaking to your heart that there's even a deeper walk and you have a right to walk in Liberty to take that word you've got a right to call on the Lord Jesus and when you're tempted you got a right to call on him call on him he's right there he'll strengthen you and you know he does he builds your faith it's building your testimony because this is your testimony Christ's working through your life God at work is that right but Rams asked the question he's asked the question of you know this person said brother grandma got a I got a temper and he says he said how how am I overcome it he said I know he said it has to be the Lord but I love the part of this question that he says he says but what can I do I love that Brother Brad answers in a great theological deep deep way you ready three words sweeten your temper with five words prayer sweeten your temper live prayer what was he saying if a person they might be on their makeup and however they are now listen to me brother Bram could have just said and simply told the person said well you need to be born again right he could have said that but see here's what it was there's things with passions and things like that and what he's dealing with is this person says I want to overcome that and so brother Bram says here's how you do it sweeten your temper with prayer you think prayer ain't powerful it's inviting the presence of God always remember in the midst of your Temptation when you're tempted tempted temptation is not sin I can feel so he can feel bad but it's not sin but just remember at that point say Lord help me if it's thoughts that went through your mind Lord forgive me Lord cleanse my mind of those thoughts Lord I don't want to entertain them Lord if I entertain the thought forgive me because there's sometimes we've entertained thoughts I'm gonna be honest for all of us and you know what we have a high priest and there's things there's things and I'm not talking about whether it was entertained for whether it was entertained for a nanosecond or a second or five second it doesn't matter Lord I don't want no birds roosting I don't want no birds rooster I only want a piece of straw where they flew over I go out on my porch and on them post and birds that come by they come by Honey winners that time of year they come by when is it July I ought to be having independence from them they come by in my post that they got my porch and I love my porch and they and that post sticks out about that much and they think it's a place for them to roost you all probably know where I'm going you gotta I have to continue to go out there and I've had to go out there and they build them nests so fast and mud things just like cement that's up there on those things right I'll tell you what I did I got the reason I thought I'm tired of going out here and if I'm away or I've been you know I've been doing this and doing that and all of a sudden I turn around and think I can go on my front porch I look up there's a nest pretty soon you got a whole call on me so I read where I could take plastic water bottles and I could cut them water bottles so that it has like fingers like this I have them like they're like so they're like this because when their wings set down there they don't like them they don't look real pretty but you can't see it driving by my house but inside my porch you can look up and I'll take the Deer Park wrappers off of them but you can look up and see them you know what them Birds came by again they wanted to flutter down and then little from where I cut them plastic bottles and then poke things they don't want to set down in there I had a choice I can either go out there every so often and knock down a nest or you know what I need to put something there so they can't come there I tell you we've got an access that we can fill our lives with the things of God I'm talking about praise I'm talking about worship I'm talking about singing I'm talking about music I'm talking about the word because it's all about him let us fill our lives with the right things so when the devil goes to try to flutter down oh man I don't feel comfortable there that little thing is it's poking me it's pricking me now you know what happened one of them bottles right there I know this ain't real spiritual but there's an application in it one of them bottles after a while one of them bottles kind of got from the winter storm got kind of stretched out a little bit you know what happened one of them Birds went down and sat down in it built a nest what'd you do brother Samuel went up there and tore it down and I put a brand new bottle on there where it was like that I'm not just going to let it sit there I didn't build that for you to come and make your nest in come on friends I know the mind is a no man's land but that means I can fill it with the things of God I can fill it with the things of God I can put on a message I'm not there trying to oh I got to get every word I got confidence that the spirit of God will brood over my life Mama You Got Confidence when you're watching the children or your ironing clothes or you're doing this or on the job you got
