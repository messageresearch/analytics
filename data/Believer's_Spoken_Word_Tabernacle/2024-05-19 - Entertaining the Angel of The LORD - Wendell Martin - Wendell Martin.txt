I don't know how much voice I have to do this daddy raised me to be a man he did the best that he knew how he sacrificed his money his talent and his time I stood there looking at my reflection wondering where I'd gone wrong I could see no re resemblance in all I done he always had the perfect words he always done things so right here I stand and I strugle in my PL but daddy said listen my son you're looking at the there's got to be battles fought there's going to be times you feel so all [Music] along then he said listen my son you're looking at the victories one you're looking at the fruit of the struggles gone now I'm looking at my own son or the man you have become though the challenges surround You by faith you're going to overcome you're not alone for God is with you you'll never lose if you rely just following his footsteps the same as I I got to say listen my son going to be battles fought there's going to be times you feel so all alone got to say listen my son there's got to be victories W there's got to be the fruit of the struggles gone [Music] oh right now your ship is rocking no sun in your skies but rest assured the Lord is molding and he's making you his pride got to say listen my son there's got to be battles fa there's got to be times you feel so all Al got to say listen my son there's got to be Victory W there's got to be the fruit of the struggles gone there's going to be the fruit of the struggles [Music] gone you're going to be the fruit of the struggles go [Applause] Hallelujah got to be the fruit of the struggles sometimes we look at at our elders and sometimes we we say I I don't see any kind of similarities I don't see any kind of good I don't I don't see any kind of my dad in me or any kind of but I just want to tell you the genetics are there your daddy had to go through the same trials that you're going through your mama had to go through the same struggles that you've gone through your Prophet had to go through the same struggles that you've gone through and just as the elders have made it and are making it so will you I look at my life even today I see where I'm at amen and sometimes I fall so short of what I see in my daddy he M Hallelujah but to look at but Dad to look back at me and say I'm proud of you son and I'm I I'm fixing to be 54 years old and and that does something to me to hear that from my daddy telling me he's proud of me amen I I I think I think mamas and daddies need to let their children know how proud you are of them amen and so uh we count a de a delight to be here so glad to see everyone here a lot of our friends that we've seen in the past and and I say a great big God bless all of these young people God bless every it's just been a wonderful week here with brother Samuel and and the church here and and we have just thoroughly enjoyed ourselves we we won't keep you along tonight but let's look here in in the Book of Genesis the 18th chapter and um uh we're going to read the first six verses and we um uh we just want to say it's such a delight Amen to to know the Lord Jesus and to have this message of the hour and um amen uh we we are so blessed I I believe the coming of the Lord is so close to us but here in in Genesis 18 and 1 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat at the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant now I want you to look the Lord appears and then we find that Abraham recognizes him number three he bows down to to this ground and he asked him not to leave let a little water the fourth verse I pray thee be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree prise the Lord and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and he said they said do so and as thou Hast said and Abraham hastened into the tent and Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and me it and make cakes upon on the earth I want to speak for a few moments tonight entertaining the angel of the Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father Lord we love you and it's so nice to have friends and fellowship and to see these young people come from some of them drove hours away and were already in service this morning but they come Lord to put their licks of fire in with the young people here and and Lord I say I'm asking that you would bless them and all of those who have come today I pray that you'll bless this congregation bless the pastor and those that labor with him bless these young people Lord as we've seen them play music and singing and Lord it does my heart good I pray holy spirit that you would help me as Lord my voice is is a little weak tonight and and I just ask that you would give strength to body and voice Lord give me a clear mind let my spirit be sensitive to you Lord and I just pray Lord that you would make us all sensitive to youen in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless can the Church Say Amen am and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening and I I want to say that as we have seen as brother brandham would tell us there in the uh 18th or the 12th chapter amen he said Abraham typed he typed out the bride and and and the stages of of restoration and he he said the 12th chapter was the was Abraham being justified he says the 15th chapter was Abraham Sanctified then in the 17th chapter the Holy Ghost he typed the Holy Ghost baptism El shedi but when he come to the 18th chapter was the placing this is when the Lord appeared and the body change was to take place and and Abraham recognized the presence of the Lord I I I think it's important that we recognize the presence of the Lord Jesus now I don't I don't think it's it's God's not calling us just to be church members God is calling us Amen to a very special position in this last day he's calling us back to that place amen that he had we're going back to the Garden of Eden can you say amen I think it's in important at what we entertain now the scripture says as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man the revealing of the son of man is what took place here in the 18th chapter when God appeared in the in the form of a human being and God be to speak amen words of life and restored Abraham and Sarah back to their amen and a youth again can you say amen I think it's incredible because lot did not see this lot could not entertain the presence of God Amen because he could not recognize God I I I think God Amen I'm thankful that there is a people that can recognize God in our midst today when I think about entertain it means to give attention to to give consideration to to receive someone amen it it it to entertain is to amen uh pay attention and to play and and give attention consideration to amen as it was in the days of Sodom amen there will be a revealing and there will be a receiving just as there was a revealing to Abraham and a receiving from Abraham so will it be today amen now we're living in a in this hour of great um uh self-gratification amen now you young people are facing more today than than I had to face when I was a kid I mean computers uh uh you know if you had computers when I was a kid uh you were pretty rich and if you had computers you had to have this really big room amen because computers would take up the entire room and and uh we didn't really know what we were doing with the computer if you ever had one but it amen that's what we had amen I I I I I'll tell you what we there was no such thing as a cordless drill there was no such thing as a amen as a cell phone there there was no such we had cords on our phones amen we had cords on our drills we had chords you see but I that's that's the generation I was raised up in if I wanted to make a phone call 10 miles away amen it was long distance so we had calling cards you had to go buy a calling card y'all how many remembers this hallelujah amen some of you old fossils back there amen amen some of you are saying oh yeah I remember back when they used to have to get the operator I wasn't born back that way amen praise the Lord but but but back in the day amen we uh you you had to have the calling cards my wife was was an hour away from me I couldn't talk to her uh very much because it cost a lot of money so what we done is sat down and wrote letters every day and and and and would receive letters back and forth that's the way we communicated when I was a kid and uh we had pay phones how many remembers the old pay phone amen now now payones were good that's where Superman used to changes so amen back in they we had those pay phones you'd put a quarter in and you could dial across and no one you see there they no one knew where you were at when I was a kid I would take off riding my back I wouldn't come back home I'd leave in the morning time wouldn't get back home until supper time mom wouldn't know where I was there was no way of knowing where I was at we didn't have cell phones we didn't have no way of keeping track of one another well praise the Lord amen that's the way that's the kind of generation I was raised up in but we are in a generation today to where everything is at our fingertips right well praise the Lord amen you you you you can keep in track you can keep keep track of your you know uh uh uh some of these girls here have got F these two girls here have got friends here in in Ohio and y'all can y'all can talk to each other once twice three times a day if you want to amen that you you can keep track of people across the seas you can keep track of Amen what what is we are in a a a generation amen where where the uh uh uh where the electronics has kept us all entertained amen if we ever wanted to figure something out we would go get the dictionary or go get the encyclopedia amen encyclopedias were that line there was a bunch of them and you'd have to go through there to try to figure out what this meant and what that was that's the generation but this generation Satan knows what he's doing he's wanting to entertain you so that you feel important all right he's entertaining you so that we feel important but I want to tell you the promise of this generation is he has promised to come right and we must entertain him am I doing all right so far I we've got to recognize him in our midst so self-gratification you see the action of lot lot could not recognize God lot could not see where God was at because lot was amen he he he was he was blind of heart amen therefore his actions his reactions could not be the same but the actions of Abraham were the direct results of the expectation of heart he knew that God was going to fulfill his word in his life amen Abraham had been waiting for a promised child Abraham had been waiting for a long time it had been 24 years when God appeared to him in this in this text amen and Abraham recognized God when he came and there was a reality that God gave to him yeah now I want to tell you today amen that in our in this culture today there is nothing in this culture that is going to produce a body change in these mortal bodies there is nothing in this culture that is can change us there is nothing in this culture that can give us a Rapture there is nothing in this cult can you say amen and to be quite honest this culture is not looking for a Rapture they claim a Rapture but they're not looking for a Rapture they're not looking for the Fulfillment of sons they're not looking they're just looking for self-gratification they're looking for things amen and entertainment to keep them busy amen but there is a group of people that know that the Redemption is growing near there is a group of people who understand that God has called them to take this world back he's calling us back to Eden he's calling us back to sunship he's calling us back to Authority he's calling us back can you say amen and we have been given a promise of eternal life and that is what we are looking for in our lives amen how do they how do the denominations get the people to church anymore they've got to have light shows they've got to have every kind of a program amen they've got to they've got to produce they've got to do something to do what entertain the people if there's no entertainment then the people won't show up so they've got to have the best of groups they've got to have the best of musicians they've got to have the best amen and the flashiest well praise the Lord amen they're

unless unless there's some kind of entertainment but you're not going to make it into that other land unless you learn to entertain him and that's what we are here to do today I don't want to be entertained I don't want someone to tick on my fancy I need to entertain Jesus Christ tell me one of those organizations or denominations that can amen that that can heal the sick and raise the dead and have the power to overcome and live a holy life anymore there's nothing there there's nothing to hold them there's nothing to keep them they are sodomites a me lot right there in Sodom could not see his eyes were blinded but there was Abraham who was not in Sodom Abraham was over here Amen on a on a mountain all alone and all forsaken no one understood him but he was living with a promise it was a promise of a new body it was a promise of a son it was a promise it Hallelujah the world did not understand him but he had the promise nonetheless praise the Lord you can see how the life in the in the seed life comes up you guys have a lot of corn around this part of the country amen and as the life comes the stock is green but as it keeps on going it begins to die and then amen it comes on up to the tassel and then it comes on up right and brother brandom would say talking about the church he would say she's a dry Shu it's passed the spirit of God passed through her is true and will not she will not be air with this Vindicated seed word she sure will not be she shall not go in the Rapture she'll be a church member may come up in the Resurrection be judged for what she has heard can you say Amen but Abraham has been given the [Music] promise Oh Glory to God God help every one of us not to get up caught up in this Le osia culture don't don't don't let don't I I I believe in good music and I believe in feeling your music and I I I I enjoyed watching these fellas play and sing here here tonight amen I believe in feeling your I think if you're going to sing sing with all you got if you're going to play play with all you got if you're going to preach preach with all you got and if you're going to amen me amen me with all you got that was good amen I slid that one right in there amen you see we we got we what we do we should do with all we've got but it's not entertainment I sing to entertain him I preach to entertain him I are y'all hearing me I want to entertain him because he has the secret of [Music] life amen he's the only one that can give a Rapture he's the only one that can give me a body change he's the only one that can give you girls a husband he's the only one that can give you boys a a a good wife oh yeah y'all can pick whatever you want but God knows what he's got for you can you say amen amen therefore our number one priority should be to entertain the Lord hallelujah nowen I think that's a Abraham and Sarah there was no life now I just wanted I just want to really drive that home before I get into my my thrust of my message there's no life out there in the entertainment world the holy spirit is calling me and you into that secret place with him shut in with God in that secret place you kids probably don't even know it there in in the spirit beholding his face hallelujah amen is that right that's right gaining new power to run in this race how I love to be shut in with God something takes place in that secret place there is something that takes you see every every every need that we have everything that we have need of is in that secret place see you think you need a boyfriend but you need a secret place with God you think you need a girlfriend but you need a secret place with God even good-looking Fellers and fettes need a secret place with God many times we're wanting we're wanting a new game we're wanting a new Xbox or whatever we want this or that or the other but what we need in this generation is not more entertainment we must learn to entertain come on Church Hallelujah somebody is going to be sitting there in the bleachers and somebody is going to be playing in the [Music] game I think it's boring watching golf I think it's boring I I think I Hallelujah I don't want to be a spectator I want to be a participator I don't want to be entertained God Let Me Entertain You let my praise ring out to you let my love give to you let everything I let me be what you have created me to be Abraham Abraham recognized the Lord and he said you're not leaving me you're not going to leave me you're you're not stay right there Sarah he's here yeah Sarah amen go kill the cat amen go go go go get do whatever you got to do we got to feed this angel while he's here he's not going to be here long stay put angel of God we're going to entertain you sometimes we can't even go through a church service when the presence of the Lord is going so strongly and sweetly and because it's running too late for us Elders be careful come on we want to turn around and say man that service is going but somebody has got to entertain the presence of the Lord the angel of the Lord is a mystery to this generation they don't know who he is but you know who he is they don't know where he would even be at but you know where he's at the angel of the lord always accompanies his message he's always here the angel the mighty angel of Revelations 10 is here on the Earth hallu amen hallelujah but in the revealing of the son of man when God would reveal him in the form of dust and he would discern hearts with precision and night after night and year after year and he was literally restoring the hearts to Faith Can you say Amen we beheld him we knew him we seen him amen we we we could recognize God through that prophet's word and when a prophet comes and let me just say this before I get into my my my my main thought when when when when you see a prophet you know that God is on the the the prophet is here to reflect or to reveal God to let you know that he's close so when a prophet speaks that means that when a prophet shows up that means god is on the earth to do something really special amen now he don't want you looking at the prophet and worshiping the prophet he wants you to know the prophet declares that he is here the prophet says you don't see him but I can see him the prophet says he's right here he's he's right up above you can't you see the light the angel is here you don't see him I don't see him but the prophet sees him and the prophet reveals him and the prophet tells you he is here can you say amen amen because God's doing something glory to God now it's God's thoughts spoke through a prophet into the Virgin womb of his bride and they carry and manifest the supernatural seed of God this is what God has called us can you say Amen now I want you to understand now Moses amen the the brother Brandon would talk about how that Moses would go up into the mountain he would come back down and the glory of the Lord was upon him and he says and he would have to put a veil over his face until he come and give the people the word and once he gave him the word then he could take the veil back off why as long as he held the word he was the veil but once the people took the word they become the veil of that word hallelujah hallelujah he says so Moses was a God to the people until the word came and then when the word came amen he was just a normal man oh hallelujah what I love about the message of the hour is God specifically brought a message in this generation to impregnate or to put in your bosom for for you to believe so that you could perform the very works of God Sarah could not have the baby Sarah tried Sarah long Sarah could not but when God came through that angel when Prophet God came whatever he said to them change their bodies amen amen and I'm here to tell you that what we have received into the womb of our heart amen is going to produce a body change in every one of us can you say Amen now God's got to have a veil he's got to have a people and I say today as brother brandham would say but this is the spirit that comes upon the promised word for this age and brings forth and manifest not two tables of stones but the presence of the Living God not a mythical thought somebody made up and some houd a trick but the very promise of God revealed made manifest right before us then he asked the question what sort of a veil will that be behind now now now I I I Hallelujah I want stick stick with me it's fixing to get good amen the veil God behind skin God through a prophet God delivering his word thank you Jesus because God is wanting to reveal himself thank you Lord through peopleall thank I think sometimes we don't recognize God because all we see is brother Samuel Browning or we miss the angel because all we see is brother Nathaniel all we see is Wayne Lawson or all we see is fill in the blank and we we we fail to realize that God is still here [Music] living that's right living in a five-fold Ministry and when the preacher's preaching we're not entertaining the presence of God because we don't recognize that it is God oh it's sure is well we had a good service here this morning it's quiet here tonight we don't recognize him because he's behind human skin right he's behind a human Veil can you say Amen now I think we've got to recognize the presence of God can you say Amen someone says well I can't see God Amen I say God is here whether you see him or not I say the angel of the Lord is here whether you whe whether you can see the pillar of fire or not brother Brandon put it this way he said how many knows there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ two different words now the appearing the coming now's the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church now you're a part of that church and by his grace you believe uh you believe I'm a member of that church amen and and and he goes on down he says but my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or a teacher he says if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean that but this is my Ministry see to declare him that he is [Music] [Applause] here amen so as Believers we have confidence in the words of that Prophet sir to say that he's with us amen amen I think there must be an awareness that he is with us you say well I I you I wish I wish I knew I wish I knew that that he was with us I wish I wish there was some well Hallelujah this fourth dimension the fourth dimension this in this hour is it's the satellites and it's the infrared and it's the and and and and and and and the XM radios and and uh how many how many's ever listened to uh XM what's that what's that southern gospel station XM 65 does anyone around here listen to XM 65 you're the Long Ranger me and you buddy Tonto amen I found out that through the XM radio that I can I can tune in amen through to a station you can be listening to the same station that I'm listening to I don't care I it and it never changes I can listen to that radio station all the way up here to Ohio a matter of fact I went all the way up into they man all the way up to the Hudson Bay as far as I could go in my car anyways amen before I had to fly I went all the way up into into Ontario way way way way way up until the road's end and that I was still listening to the same station because of that fourth dimension that fourth dimension now I can't see that dimension I can't see that radio station I don't know where it's at but I can pick it up whether I'm in Ohio whether I'm in Oklahoma whether I'm in Canada whether I'm in it don't matter all right well praise the Lord you listening to your music your your cell phones now back when I was a kid you had to have a wire right and someone would have came up with a cell phone and didn't have a wire I'd said you are absolutely nuts yeah because I had to see the proof all right it's got to be connected to a wall somewhere or it don't work but today there's no cords whatsoever but it's picking up into that fourth dimension right now we're in the third we're in that the first three dimensions time space and matter I I believe it is but this fourth dimension is where is is is where amen it goes beyond your eyesight it goes beyond well can you say Amen so it is with God you don't see him many times you might not feel him but God is here and God sent a prophet to let you know that he is hereen God sent a prophet to say he's here brother you're you you live with such and such and such and such and you just had this and this and this and this sister you had a surgery 20 years ago and I can see the docker and he looks like this and he hears it and he says this and this that and the other it was God letting us know the prophet letting us know that the mighty angel amen praise the Lord amen I don't need another Prophet to come and tell me he's here that's right he's already proved he's here what I've got to do though I can't see though I might not always feel though I cannot come on I can't taste but I know he's [Music] here sir therefore I can entertain him amen now that that Mighty Angel was not was not prophesied to come in any other generation but this one brother brandham would say we don't have any reverence to God everybody just thinks he's so secure until they don't reverence God like they should why why do they do this because they're not conscience of his presence that's the reason people do that they don't recognize it they can't they can't comprehend that they're in the presence of God their minds become so perverted taken up in the things of the world until they don't even pay attention to it they go to church sure but to realize that you're in the presence of God not only in a church wherever you are you're in the presence of God if they could do as David said I put the lord always before my face therefore I shall not be moved as long as the Lord was before him he could not be moved another place 63 in influence he said you must remember that God is watching you every hour he watches you when you're asleep now I think that's the reason people do those things is because they're not conscious of his presence yet he is there whether you think he is or not he sees every look that you make every move that you make he knows all about it but we ought to realize that can you say Amen be careful little eyes what you see be careful little eyes what you see for the P father up above looking down in Tender Love Can you say Amen he's here right recognizing him understanding that he knows every thought that you think and he has come to Earth to fulfill his word in you if you're sick here tonight remember he's here he sees when the baby's sick he's there with you he's wanting you to recognize amen when your mind is about to fall apart and you just don't know which way to go remember when the preacher no war you you can't get a hold of him when Mama you can't get a hold of it remember he's here amen hallelujah the reason why we I I I I think our our attitudes toward him I you know the prophet would say that our that our Spirits are are are magnetized to the spirit world am man that Spirits travel on words what your eyes and your ears that ushers it into the soul and Man songs and television and Internet and text and and and and all of these things and we become so a we get we get so uh uh uh subjected to these spirits and those Devils tried to keep us out of the presence of God but on the other hand amen a a prophet's voice and gospel music and the presence of the Lord and what can you say Amen brother Bram says there's three regions above us and there's three regions below us Satan and his angels have come up to Earth in this Dimension God and His angels have come down to earth Amen in this Dimension and what are they here to do they are here looking for subjects right in this final day amen well can you say amen amen but I just want to tell you amen the power of the Holy Spirit if we can recognize his presence if we can recognize him in our midst if we can recognize him amen when we're in prayer I'm not just saying another prayer I am ENT entertaining the Lord I'm not just reading the Bible I am entertaining the Lord I am not just coming to church but I'm entertaining the Lord I'm coming amen with a with a Heart of Worship I'm coming with a heart of praise and sincerity I'm coming to give everything of God I'm going to wash Jesus feet I'm going to love him I'm going to adore him I'm going to give him everything that he is worthy of he has come down for me and while he is here I am going to entertain him can you say Amen brother Brenham would say when you receive the Holy Ghost amen he would say when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart quickly you become a two-fold being one of Earth to die one of Heaven to live his body is still subject to death but in his soul he's passed from death into life his body he's he has his Earthly contact with his five senses and his Spirit he has contact with God through the Holy Ghost and the angels of God visits them speaks with them they are messengers sent from God to reveal to bring messages from God to the individual can you say Amen I'm living in this world I'm living in this condition but I have one that Hallelujah he's bringing the words of life to me amen he's got what I have need of though the enem is coming against me though he fights me though everything yet I know that God is with [Music] me listen to that how many times and I'm not going to hold you too much longer how many times do we bump in to the presence of God and not recognize it well now now now this now I this is this is really this is really incredible right because sons of God are greater than angels angels are sent to bring messages to the individual and if we can recognize God in our midst there is no telling Hallelujah when you're discouraged if you could just recognize that God's sitting right beside you amen when you're needing when you're needing upliftment you could just recognize that God is right there with you can you say mine brother Brandon would say what's this you're bumping into all the time what's that that condemns you when you're wrong what's that that makes you believe he says that's him you might not be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in a spirit form the invisible God but he dwells among a visible people making himself visible by his promised word in that people then he asked do you understand now bumping Hall well glory to God bumping Hallelujah just bumping amen bumping in but you're not just bumping in to you're bumping in the Angels God is near amen God hallelujah I I I I'm here to tell you it's not what you how how how how much you've Got A tingle going up and down your spine that's right what it is is recognizing that he has come down in a special way for this generation mamas and daddies he's not forgot about you he's not you you back there in the back God knows exactly where you are don't get too busy with your family with your jobs with your careers don't get too busy amen with your games and everything else recognize him and entertain him for he is the only one with the source of Life hallelujah how often have we come to church in a bad mood or come to church in an I don't care mood come to church just so brother brother Samuel does not give us a call on Thursday morning or y'all have Wednesday night service here when's y'all Services Friday morning amen some of you needed on Thursday morning are you going to be at church Friday morning where were you amen recognizing don't come to I have found I have found that when I recognize him in my midst or in in in in that I recognize his presence something takes place I have I have come to the church in a in a tired really tired environment and I'm thinking the church is dead and I'm just thinking that the preacher just really needs to get another subject that's bad when Pastor thinks that and I'm there and I'm I missed the Lord asking him to preach and and then all of a sudden someone behind me just starts balling and screaming and and here I am in my rotten attitude and that one over there is receiving some something from the Lord and I found out it wasn't God that missed the service I missed the [Applause] service amen so when we all come in with that attitude is I I don't care who's preaching I don't care who's singing I don't care what's going on I don't care if it's my favorite I don't care if it's not my favorite I'm going to be there because God's going to be there and I'm going to entertain the presence of the Lord that's right I'm going to worship when I don't feel like it I'm tired but I'm going to worship only then can it be the sacrifice of praise I'm I'm giving it all when I don't feel like it I'm praying when I don't feel like it I'm giving because he is is [Music] worthy brother Bram says recognize him and be quick be quick keep your spirit keep your spirit sensitive and be quick to respond amen amen come on folks Amen brother Bram in a service he says you believe you're in his presence that's what's making you feel that way something's vibrating over your spirit that you know being a Christian it has to be the Holy Ghost oh if this audience would only believe like you

young people this is the rapture in generation I'm teaching I'm I'm teaching y'all a little secret to to ministry here too sensitivity to the presence of God is so important not just for the preacher

take me in a higher place he's want to and Satan will just try to get me and get me and get me and if and if I'm not trained and if I'm just Hallelujah like one of those dumb old hounds that just

platform to be prayed for I don't have to be nowhere but right here Lord where you areall you don't have to be a good preacher you don't have to be a singer you don't have to be anything for the Lord to use you just somebody that's willing to entertain amen amen do we have any entertainers in the building here today amen you remember Sister Weber sister Weber went to be she asked to be prayed for and wanted be healed and and um matter of fact let me just let me just read it to you amen he says uh she was dying with TB and she was at the sanatorium at the last stages and they sent her home to die and there was nothing could be done for her Miss Grace Weber in Jeffersonville she lived Beyond The Tabernacle she had she had got five or six little children so the angel the Lord came to me that night and says uh go tell Mr Weber rather that to to get things ready he's going to be left with those children on his hands for his wife is going well I went and told Mr Weber told his little girl little Jean Rose which which is a nurse now she was a little bitty F then and and and she's a young lady now and it's been 7 years ago or more and I said now Genie your mother's going to die she can't live but a little while longer two days after that or 3 days there were some ladies at the government Depot there where she had worked and come in and and and Miss Weber she said if I if I could only have the bill to pray for me once more I seen my my cousin opal was healed and with that cancer and the doctor just give her till morning to live and her the doctors and the nurses and her daughter's a nurse also and and the girls came out of the government where she worked with and they said well there's there's nothing to that guy he has nothing he's nothing but a hypocrite that's all that religion is just a bunch of fake fanaticism and so miss Weber said look I'm dying I know that but I won't stand still for that she said I know better than that she said I've been I've lived around there around this city around that man all that time and I've seen him from a child grown up and she said I I know you can call it fake if you want to but I've just seen too much and seen God heal the people I know the man's life and I know it's the truth and it happened to be the angel of the Lord heard that now now here's her friends from the government Depot over there just saying trying to encourage us well don't listen to that man you can be healed I she said no no no no no no that man's right right and the angel of the Lord heard that and that very night sitting on the side of my chair in the room after I got up and went and got a drink of water about 3:00 in the morning sitting on the chair I seen him come walking through the door and he said tomorrow Sunday they're going to pick Miss Weber up to bring her down she'll be sitting on the right hand side far back in the Tabernacle and said I I heard her tell her I heard her and what she said and tell her thus saith the Lord she'll Live and Not [Applause] Die there you are you can go down and see her if you'd like it's been about seven years ago his presence was there when she was taking up for what is right his presence was there he found her so he come and told me what she had said and what she said to these women and he had respect to her because she had respect unto what God what was representing God so God will do the same for you not to respect me but to respect him Christ the one who died for your healing if you respect him and his word he will do the work for you amen that is right I think it pays to entertaining he loves his people he loves every one can you say amen amen there is no need too great in this building tonight there ain't a prophet to stand up here and to tell you that he's seeing what you done yesterday and how you've taken up for the things of the Lord and He the prophet but we don't need the prophet here that's right he came to declare that he's here amen now we must have faith and act accordingly we're not sodomites we're not taken up with all of the stuff of Sodom we are a separate people waiting Upon A Promise believing in God we have one purpose and that's to go

oh every promise in the B is M oh every chapter every oh I'm trusting in his every promise in the book is [Music] amen how many say [Music] amen God has certainly spoken amen certainly spoken Satan would like to try to bring the definition and defining of what we need and what things need to be done that's the way this Brother Martin and brother Wendell took that that to make us think that we need to be entertained and it's not the real Joy the greatest joy in your life and our life is to entertain him you can have and we've all been there there's times that I can talk to everybody in here you can click on one video you can click on something else click on something else and before you know it it's been time and after that a little bit of time you just feel so and it isn't even it's not sinful things that you've been looking at it's just you're just like ah because none of those things have value in your life even as a young person no matter who you are always evaluate things by how is this going to increase the value of Christ in me Satan's always interested in devaluing taking away but God wants to bring value to your life when you entertain him he brings out of you what he placed within you and there's no Greater Joy there's no greater pleasure I'm a witness of times that when my flesh don't feel like praying times when I don't feel like studying times when I don't even feel like coming to church but I'm a witness of it that just that little bit of pressing beyond my feelings cuz you know what my feelings we all have feelings and feelings have their place but don't live by them don't live by them because like the prophet told us he said Satan can beat us around the stump on our feet feelings yeah he said but when I've learned he said as a young young Christian he said I learned to take what God had said in his word and I've met God's requirements and I stand right there and that's what matters so when anytime my feelings or any feelings are against the word I'll take the word always take the word always take the word it'll lead you out of Gloom it'll lead you out of depression it'll lead you out always take what the word says because the word is true and it's certain there's no variableness in the word the word solid and always take a hold of what God has said and every experience that you've had every experience is important it's god making himself known to you and right was what was said right here there's a there's so many good points I would really suggest going back over this message and and I mean going back over it in your home taking down notes upon those things I know you did hear it and right now what brother Wendell mentioned there at the end is so important of begin to thank God for whatever it is that you had a request in your heart begin to thank him for it you say brother Samuel was that scriptural brother Brandon would point out at the end of The Book of Luke that when the disciples had met the resurrection Ed Lord Jesus Christ and he told them to go wait in the city of Jerusalem and be endued with power from on high at the end of The Book of Luke it describes that event that happened in Acts and the Bible says they returned with joy and brother Brandon points it out in the message he said look at that they returned with joy before they even got the Holy Ghost because they knew it was certain you know why if it was just a man who made the promise we could doubt but it's not a man man who made the promise it's God who made the promise it's God who came by your tent door tonight it's God who came by where you were at and made the promise real that hey I'm The God Who made the promise I'm your God Amen and we can be certain with that and we can begin to thank him we're not Beggars you're not Beggars young people you're Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to beg he said you ask knock it'll be open to you seek and you find amen don't you love him tonight amen how many witnesses in the house we have tonight amen ain't God good amen he's worthy of Our Praise Hallelujah I tell you I'd rather be here tonight than be anywhere else I mean that you could be in who's whose Mansion or whatever more the White House of course somebody wouldn't never remember you were there but I would I I don't want to be nowhere I wouldn't want to be nowhere El I want to be right here in his presence this is the best place that we could be is in his presence right now God promised he would meet us and he's met us here don't you love him amen when you go from here keep entertaining his presence when you wake up in the morning you may not feel what you feel here now but he's not departed from you begin to entertain him begin to worship Him how many remember brother Bram says when you go to pray sometimes you get to prayer you ever felt like sometimes when you're praying it feels like he's a million miles off I'm not the only one feels like your prayers are hitting the ceiling and coming back down on you brother Brown said well how you approach it is you begin to just worship him just start your prayer just worship Him brother Samuel I'm I'm in the car right now or maybe you know you're on your way to school you're on your way just start to worship and listen God will come where he's invited and I tell you how you want to start every day is Lord Jesus I don't want to start this day without inviting you every step of the way amen don't you love him God is so good Amen brother Nathaniel would you come and dismiss us in a word of prayer amen so thankful to have each and every one of you amen just been good to be here brother thank you thank you for yielding yourself to the Lord thank [Applause] you is it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight oh my goodness anyone feel refreshed in your spirit oh praise the Lord what a wonderful sweet presence that's here as we close the service let's just bow our heads and just express our appre appreciation for What the Lord Has Done tonight oh my heavenly father L Lord there's nothing that gives us joy like being in your presence Lord I feel like as family we just pull up to the table and just eat the good food that you've laid out for us God I pray that as we go from this place the things that have been spoken may they not be forgotten yes L but Lord may we take them with us and remember that the presence of the Lord is always near and be careful to guard our words that we're lifting up the word that has been given to us appreciating that Jesus Christ has never lost that your word is true your promises are personal and Lord may we speak those positive things because maybe the angel of the Lord is standing right there listening to what we're saying God may we have that gentle reminder in our hearts always as we go and Lord as we come to the day tomorrow we've had encouragement for the weekend but Lord may it not be a dead thing may we take the inspiration may we take the anointing into the week we've been getting given power to overcome the weak we've been given encouragement let us face the weak in that way for Lord you know what's coming tomorrow you know what's coming Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday Lord you already gave us the answers today so Lord may we go forward in confidence knowing Lord that your word is true that you will never leave us nor forsake us Lord youve given us a confidence and a peace and when we feel nothing may we lift our hands and praise you with a glad heart because we know that you are faithful and that you are true Lord we commit our day the rest of today and the fellowship into your hands Lord we thank you so much for your blessings Lord my heart is so full I thank you Lord for your servant brother Wendell Lord may you return unto him many times over what he
