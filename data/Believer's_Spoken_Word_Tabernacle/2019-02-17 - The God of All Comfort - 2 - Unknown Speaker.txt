the Norse ins Depot and Lord willing we'll have that following the morning service and certainly would like to see each and every one of you there and is to have a time of fellowship together so let's turn to the word of the Lord this morning and would just certainly one his direction if we can turn there and thank the musicians just asked for the Lord that his he would just guide us this morning through his word second Corinthians chapter one and we begin at verse 3 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God or as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ so notice this scripture here for as the sufferings of Christ abound or grow greater in us so our consolation also aboundeth grows greater by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation I think that's a very important verse that there a very important statement at the end as you're partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are mindful Lord that we are standing here Lord in your presence we're mindful Lord of our littleness mindful Lord of our insufficiency within ourselves Lord God for the task Lord that lays before father not only as Speaker but is here as well Lord were very much aware that it's going to take an operation of the Holy Ghost that you would come and that's the Lord where we want to yield the notes of our lives we want to yield to you Lord that you would just come in a very special and personal way and minister to the needs of your people Lord as we've gathered here O God in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ the father that you would just search our hearts and Lord may you deepen Lord in our lives oh god the love of God I pray father may you just take a hold of every heart if there's one who doesn't know you Lord as the comforter would you just move Lord upon that heart today and draw them to the place of refuge or God where Lord the pressure lord can be let off Lord where they can come to that rest and I pray God for each and every one Lord you know our needs Lord and may you come and encourage us break the bread of life to us Lord as we have need of it I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless yous your being seated I want to just the Lord will just help us here I'd like to just speak here just continuing to thought the God of all comfort from where we were in last week and I want to just kind of go back and set a little bit of a direction of where we're going to lay further in here this morning just as I just fill up on my heart just not be able to get away from different things when we left out of the pulpit last week and then all the way through Sunday and then Monday and so I just want to just bring this and lay it back in as Paul is is letting it be known to us that it it is the God of all comfort the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and at verse 4 as he said who comforted us in all our tribulation you know it would be nothing for God to totally take away the tribulation but yet God Himself gives to us something greater than just taking away the tribulation I know that's a big statement there I know that's a big statement and I don't say that loosely I don't say it without a meaning to it but yet God grants to us something that's more lasting and that's more that's more precious to us than what it would be if he just simply removed every tribulation that was about our life or even that he himself would prevent all of those tribulations and hardships he gives something so much greater and that is he gives us his comfort and that in itself is not something that in our minds our finite minds that we are able to grasp in our minds it is something that God makes real to us by an experience that words themselves can not even be brought together to utter that but you know there's nothing that can ever take the place of an experience there's nothing that can take the place of an experience of things that you have went through or I have went through nothing can take that away as a matter of fact with those experiences there is a coupling of a great deal of understanding that comes from the comfort of the Lord as he would move through upon our lives such as when you think back brother Branham mentioned about the mother when she saw that baby in the meeting and it wasn't that she just saw the baby but remember the Holy Spirit dealt with her heart and she went and she prayed for that baby under the unction and rection of the holy spirit Milliband tells us like this he says that the compassion of that mother is said it would have went much far beyond anywhere that I could have got to and it wasn't that brother Ben didn't have compassion he would have had compassion upon that baby just as you know I believe that any within humanity and I know that's a big statement in today's world because there is such a place that we find the effects in this hour where Paul said that there is a lacking or without natural affection so things that were just natural affection there's a lacking there and we we see how all of those things it wasn't something that just come up overnight but there's been an eroding over time but yet when we come to it the comfort itself Paul is expressing here that the comfort that we have received of the Lord then through that same measure we are able to extend that same comfort to others so it wasn't the comfort of Paul but it would be the comfort of the Lord and you know it's one thing of how that God will use us and work through us within our lives but I believe that every one of us here just don't want to say words we desire that Lord let it be that the whatever words would come forth let it be that it would be from a heart of love that what it would be is more than the words that are said but it's the love of which it the origin because it's that that'll actually change the atmosphere because the words themselves remember there's to be a motivation words will create an atmosphere words can create a positive or negative atmosphere and we want that when we look back to see how that in the beginning when God spoke the Bible says then the Spirit of God went out and began to brood over the earth so we know that if we're in our hearts and our desire is let our words be reserved unto God that it might be the love of God that will move out and take a hold in a situation and it may not be and many times and this is just my personal witness and I believe there's others here it is and sometimes that necessarily there's been anything that's come out of your mouth that's been profound anything that would cause you know people to say WOW but it might it's just what is actually behind it because it is the very creator himself the god the father of all mercies that can reach out and touch that heart or that life and minister to them so it is not us in ourselves doing it but it is Christ himself moving through the conduit of our lives and so when I go back to this quote here I think it's a very powerful statement that brother Bentham makes here and he says I'm so glad to know that he can be found among the brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands bias when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he is still God and He loves us he was six he was the expressing of God and he says oh how I believe that he longs for his spirit his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles how many want to be so you and so anointed like this now I'll tell you one all through the building we would raise our hands if if there had been how many want to be anointed to walk on water boy every hand would have went up right away but you see the Prophet is directing us to this he said that we would be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and troubles and give the expression of his sympathy his sympathy not ours his sympathy and he says as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the Living God and I look at in the scriptures you know you think of how that when God Himself become of us he's so subjected himself the Bible records how that Paul will pick this up and in many ways give all angles in the book of Hebrews of how that he himself being a faithful and merciful high priest in things pertaining unto God and we find it in the scriptures to where that the Lord Jesus himself he was indeed moved with compassion we find that there were many times he went into situations and you know then carnal mind could not understand how did he not go there in the pool of siloam and he'll everybody step over different ones it wasn't that he didn't have sympathy the Prophet tells us he had sympathy for everybody who was laying around that pool but he went with a godly compassion to those to that which he was directed to in a very personal manner and here this man we know that he was healed of the Lord he couldn't get to the pool but yet how God came to him and ministered to his needs and to see how that the Lord Jesus has experienced in in this in his corporal body when he was here the Bible says that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities it speaks that these things because he was in all points tempted tested tried such as we are yet without sin so to recognize that even by the feeling of our infirmities that even the weaknesses and how that things would be about in our life he is actually moved and touched by our infirmities now I know it's not popular for us when we want to look at it as though to say well I have no infirmities but yet there's no there's a very fine balance on how our confession works the Prophet tells us this and how can overcome he said many people that have cancer will say I do not have cancer he said but the truth of the matter is you do have cancer he said but within it there you need to recognize that God within you is greater than that cancer he said ignoring it will never make it go away but you see at the same time it's not running around and saying I have cancer claiming the box of rattlesnakes it's recognizing this is what has been said but God is greater than this circumstance I always remember whatever it is you're dealing with it's always that God is above that he is the Almighty God Jesus Christ is above that there is no situation no test route what's whatever more that is greater than him we put all things under him so then to think of how that he can be touched or the word be affected with the same feeling to sympathize with one you watch how that this this very life that was projected here in the life of the Lord Jesus when he would walk upon this earth remember there were times and I've said this to you over the weeks where he would look upon the multitudes and he's seen that they were hungry and yet within the midst to think of where his purpose was set he did not look upon that and say that's menial I don't need to pay attention to that whatsoever as a matter of fact God seen that was important so much that he would burden the early church to wear it so that the ministry would not be pulled in many directions that were deacons in place within the church in order to minister to the needs of the people I I tell you that's the great compassion and nurturing of Almighty God aren't you glad for that how that God sees our needs and God just didn't say not that's trivial you you don't need to bother with that but God enjoys in to minister and make himself known to our needs the Bible says he looked upon him with compassion and then and in one place it says he healed all of the sick that they brought to him you everything itself comes down to God's will and many times you know who I'll just say all the time there's no way that we can figure out God's will if somebody goes around and telling you but during a test or trial and they know why this is the will of God or this or that they're lying to you because the real reality of it is you don't know what is going to be the outcome of that test or trial but you do have this promise when he's done I'll come forth pure as gold whatever it is that he's trying to iron out in my life he knows and this has been permitted order that Christ Himself might come further in display in my life so when we look at this watch how but here now the Lord Jesus himself he has ascended up and as he as the sacrifice already been presented he's made himself known to his disciples and now after their of the forty days here he is ascended there to the right hand of God the throne of God here now in a mediatorial work now as the true atonement he's going now to release the very spirit the life now into the Church of the Living God now remember whatever that life was that was manifested in the Lord Jesus Christ when that life itself moves inside of the heart of the Church of the Living God it will not act any different but it will actually manifest the same attributes that was manifested in the Lord Jesus Christ because remember you and I are that of the bride of Jesus Christ that which was taken out of his side and that his life itself would come to dwell inside of us our DNA the real spiritual DNA should not be any different but rather the characteristics of the Lord Jesus Christ are raised up within our life so as he himself was one who could be moved with compassion here then there must be that of his body that can actually be moved with that same compassion by the same Spirit of God now notice here here is Peter in them coming two or three days after that of the day of Pentecost and the Bible says in Hebrews 3:1 Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple who's seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked Holmes now this is a very peculiar phrase who's saying Peter and John brother ram takes it in the message without money or prize he said there was something different about Peter and John he said there was a holy blush about their face he said here you find there was a young man by the name of John he said he had a holy blush about his face there was something of a joy that was beyond you and I've seen people happy and I think we are happy at times when you go to the store how are you or you're waiting on a restaurant you're happy when they're happy right and if they're not you want to try to make their day a little bit better but you see this was something much deeper than just happiness this was a joy that resonated within their heart that actually was a changing of their countenance there was a presence about them that actually would take a hold of this man who had set by the gate called beautiful little did he know it that he this was his last day of ever being lame he didn't know he didn't realize this was going to be his last day but now here is coming a representation a reflection of the present office of the high priest and now look look at the Bible says in verse 4 and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us this is also a marvel it's a marvel because Peter and them are on a mission they're on a mission to go pray but they're able to be so in tune but they just didn't step right over or walk right by but neither is this and I hope you understand me neither is this Peter and John willing something to be so they are moved under the unction of the Holy Ghost but you see they're open for his leading it's not where God's got a problem God's gonna work on them and you know get them all primed but you know they themselves are vessel sanctified vessels that are set aside for his working however he wants to use me when he wants to use me I may never have been used like this before but I am his vessel and however he wants to use me when he wants to use me let me just be in condition but he doesn't have to work on this and work on this to get me in condition let me just be yielded at that moment so Peter fastens or fixes his eyes or looks into the situation he fastening his eyes upon him but John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them now what was he expecting to receive money oh but there was something much more than money coming his way that money would have faded it would have it would have a movement there was something greater but you see what's important there had to be an expectation or glory then Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give IV in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by the hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength he leaping stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God so when we look at this here brother Brandon would put it like this here in the message he says you know he said what had taken place he said here is Peter letting him know I can't help you to buy any crutches silver and gold have I none but such as I have he said he had been to buy from him that had to honey and the joys of the line of salvation he had just come two or three days before that from pinnacles where something had happened and that young man sprung with a great big a man to it and looked into his face he said what happened that chain of sympathy the compassion of him that had said I had compassion on the sick that same spirit had taken place in the old fisherman's heart and he said as far as money I don't have any but I want a God that will take its place a million times such as I have Peter himself was a conduit that the sympathy of the high priest could actually be poured out upon the need of this man he was not what Peter and John will baby just were set aside they were waiting on God they just were simply going about their life they clocked in to work that day were not even had any plans that I'm gonna walk over this man I know he's been having trouble in his life know if they just talked into work and then you know the unction came they just had presented themselves as available to Almighty God of this evenin line when you think of it in terms of how that the Prophet would deal with it when it come to the bull when they come to the bees you know brother Ram talks about he said normally when it would come to that of the bees he said that I usually would have started fighting at them and running don't raise your hand how many used to buy wall spray notes heard by the Samuel I believe that quote you better be obedient to the Lord you better not try to take things in your own hands brother Branham was not taking this in his own hands notice where it starts it's not him willing something to be done but here's the situation arises and brother brems says what takes place he said I know it seems childish he said but instead of being afraid I thought those poor little creatures I disturbed you and instead of hating them there was a sympathy in my heart for them oh I wish I could have that all the time if it would I'd be a different person amen Lord that it would be all the time but you realize what is it that still gets in the way us us but you see by God's help with all of these things things that we were looking at even of last week where Paul would speak to the Church of the Living God and speak to us about being tender-hearted if it was so automatic what would Paul take time expressing those things to our life if it was something so automatic then why would Paul take time in Colossians 3 Philippians and other places why would he have to express that will better Sam you know the church is made up of three kinds of believers I know that but it's also to acknowledge you and I that Berry's that aspect to encourage us to yield to the presence of God as he could say put on therefore as the holy elect beloved of God bowels of mercy and that word means put on it means to sink into the garment is there if you've been enshrouded with the Holy Ghost born of the Spirit of God the glory is already there all the coloration that's to come out of the seed that now the seed life has come upon it it's all there what has to happen it's us yielding and I'm glad that God helps us aren't you he helps us as he sees what the depth of the need is in our life no wonder that Peter coming out of this particular point and not only this time where he's there at the gate called beautiful but how the love of God was so permeating in his life that Peter could write first Peter 4:7 but the end of all things is at hand be you therefore sober and watch unto prayer now watch this here is the way to make yourself available be sober keeping your mind your focus keeping your attentiveness don't be all scattered with the cares of life and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity not just charity but this word fervent means that which is stretched out have fervent charity among yourself for charity shall cover the multitude of sins let me read this quote again that brother Neville is in prayer here where Billy Bam's asked him to pray before the service and his brother man brother Neville's praying father the great problems and trials of tomorrow will see nothing as long as we're able to hold by hand and walk through with thee they will seem as nothing as long as we're able to hold the hand and walk through with E Levin says truly Lord he says we pray Lord that now would give us a deep-seated compassion one for the other knowing that whilst one is in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing that we to one of these days shall go through like circumstances God give us the spirit of Jesus in us till we feel for each other enough until there will be unity between us until we can serve thee together give us the Spirit of the Lord Jesus till we can actually feel for one another you know brotherman tells us in the message divine love he says you can pray for the sinner all you want to pray for him he said but if you don't make contact and try to win favor with them he said you'll never do him any good prayer is wonderful it's wonderful to pray but he says you must also be that point of contact amen it has to be that way you know so God God knows how to humble you and I he knows how to put us in peculiar situations that will actually break down our comfort zone glory Alleluia now think of this looking at this when we look at it some of the statements that we've read and even where Paul would would mention here that the God of all comfort where he is comforted us in our tribulations that by that same comfort we might be able to comfort you now when you think of this here Paul himself were a person to be able to extend comfort they must have been able to actually receive the comfort in the midst of that time to help them and guide them and bring them through the whole test the trial weren't in the tribulation they had to be able to receive it and then coming through it then they themselves can actually reflect that now you know there's things that no doubt throughout this assembly that you know there's things that maybe you've went through nobody else's went through and be like you know you trying to stand in my shoes you might be able to have a little bit of a thought well I know this about a pastor but you don't know those things by reading neither could I know your job or what you do by reading even though that I'm there that you know with my wife I still do not none understand fully everything that she goes through she deals with sometimes with emotions and the pressures and everything else I don't always understand that but I do have the word of the Lord that says give honor unto her as unto the weaker vessel I don't necessarily need to understand it but there are times that not within sympathy but empathy being able to enter in and pray for her not knowing what is going on and just simply being able to hear to listen and to enter in and so when you think of this there are things that are so personal to our life there are tests there are trials there are things that you have gone through then maybe myself I've never gone through there are things that you've gone through and likewise vice versa but that steel does not take it away from us having a real godly sympathy as a matter of fact brother Branham when many would come across the platform he said I can never help those people unless I myself am able to have a feeling for them or in another place enter into a fellowship of their sufferings now that may take a little bit on the platform in order for that to take place remember said that's why I cannot do that just moving along line for me he says this is the way that I have to do it so when you look at it there are things no doubt cases that come right across the platform that brother Branham himself personally had never experienced certain things like you watch where brother BAM will deal with situations with nervousness and he'll be able to so relate to those within nervousness even within circumstances that would take place throughout the world and when things would happen even among people who were not church people yet brother Branham would have prayer for him right over the platform and say I know how it feels you remember when John F Kennedy was killed you find brother around stopping the service and he begins to pray for Jacqueline Kennedy all my a beautiful prayer but he's entering in with a heart of sympathies not condoning the sinful life and whatever more but it's entering in with sympathy for the situation and I look at this that there are things that are so personal to our lives things that you personally could go through than to tell you the truth I and myself may not ever be able to fully relate to it although I could have sympathy in terms of that which would come from the great high priests but yet you take somebody else that's had that exact experience in a certain way and you watch the flow of the sympathy from the great high priests brother he knows how to get in there and be able to pray and minister to that need so he comes a little bit more direct we has the Church of the Living God should have sympathy we should have being so anointed with the Spirit of God so we could have that feeling to be able to go to one another but watch this in the messageworks is faith express but the rams you know speaking regarding a brother who's passed on he said one of our great precious brothers so dear to us he just crossed over in the land and everytime I come to this platform I guess I'll think of brother Lyle I looked over last night and I seen little Judy sitting over there and my heart was just pounding now I wonder how many of everybody else was setting him that service that their heart wasn't pounding now you see it wasn't that they were insensitive there there might have been people who were insensitive maybe there were people who were just so caught up with the cares of life that they just could kind of overlook this but then again this was something that has happened a little time it wasn't something that just freshly or recently had happened but yet it was nonetheless and when brother Branham would catch the eye or be able to look there at sister Judy he said my heart was just pounding I was thinking of how she felt and I know when Dad died see now here's the experience I know when Dad died he says but we only have to go through those schools of sufferings to know how the other fellow feels now nobody signs up for these AP courses in schools of suffering matter of fact we don't even signed up for the pre-k but you seen Claud knows it's schools it's testings it's trying's it's we're gone molds and makes us it's him working in our life and then how that God would come around and work in our life it serves to minister to someone else who's in need brother Brent goes on and then Jesus came in called and he's talked about you know with death when it took place there in the home of Lazarus and his sisters he said what a sad little hole many of us tonight knows how to sympathize with that home when death has struck our home and you never know what it is until you have to go through it once brother Brandon coming along and God's power to transform he said we want to pray for brother Dimas and sister Rose remember they've had an awful heart hit in their life in the last he says it's father his sister now in these last year's but you know it's been less than 10 months sister Edna also he says so I know how to sympathize with brother Dimas I had a father brother wife and baby to go with in a few days apart so I know how he feels this morning he says you only know when you stand in them shoes and that's when you know how to sympathize blue bream is not taking sympathy from the rest of the congregation he's simply putting it down but there are experience through schools of suffering that then through that the Holy Spirit the great high priests will work in our life to pour out that sympathy to be able to pray for it in a manner of such a greater feeling than what you or I could ever reach to now you say brother Samuel that has to be the Holy Ghost indeed and as the Holy Spirit would come right behind those experiences and he takes that and you find yourself as brother Brent says going beyond the realm of reasoning and then you find yourself out in a realm where it is love being projected where you're entering into the feeling of that person so when we think of this here you know brother branham himself I when I look at this and these just some of these statements here that I read to you right now in order for brother Branham to even stand there on the platform to even for him to take knowledge and consideration it had to be that he himself had been a recipient of the sympathy of Almighty God he himself would have to be a recipient of the very comfort of God you say what are you saying by the Samuel because just because that something comes along in our life does not mean that necessarily that a person is actually going to receive the comfort of God you and I both know there's people you work with sometimes people you go to church with there's things that they've experienced that through the experience instead of them actually having an experience where they receive comfort and now being able to minister it instead its bitterness they actually resent what happened but you see if they belong to God God's able to help him he's able to help him and bring him around oh yeah he is faithful to do that now and think of this within it here there has to be a submission look what Paul would say here and let's just draw on this for the next few moments in Philippians 3 verse 10 that I may know him now one day Paul didn't knowing Paul knew II Paul knew him not by the letter he knew him by personal experience but you see Paul recognized that oneness itself is a continual blending forth of that oneness from the soul by divine nature to where his life itself is so permeating and flowing through our life this is his request that I may know him and the power of his resurrection he did no resurrection power did he not he did but notice the request that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings not just his sufferings but the Fellowship of her being made conformable unto his death think of this within the scripture how that Paul would express this brother Bram says it like this and I know my Redeemer liveth he said we you know we thank you for all spraying thank you for all who've made the decision long ago and have experienced a new life and stood on the sacred stands we're here to rejoice this morning with them in the hopes of the coming of the Lord Jesus when we too will fellowship with him in his resurrection as we fellowship in his suffering now you and I are very much aware tribulation comes in many forms there so there's one form that tribulation comes in that every child of God will experience and that's persecution you'll experience persecution even in the initial stage of your walk even when you've not been born again when you begin to confess I got saved the Lord touched my life you will start to receive persecution because of what you are choosing and who you are choosing to identify with you see that's the thing that gift captures many people's minds and they begin to look at will I be able to do this or will I be able to do that will I be able to stand up to this I'll tell you what when you allow him to sweep down in your life you'll find that there's one on the inside that'll give you the grace to be able to stand when you consider listen now even when you consider that who it is that you're approaching is the very creator himself the Living God that you yourself would submit and be drawn to him in a love affair and you look and get a real look at him brother the things of this world it's not how can I overcome this how can I get beyond this but you yourself are so overcome by the look of the Lord Jesus in in your life that those things themselves fade and the things continue to fade I'll tell you right here this morning you and me continue to fade so when we look at this here how tribulation it will come persecution there's sickness all of these things for before for example within these bodies right here these bodies are still subject to sin I'm not talking about a sinful nature I'm talking about sickness can come you can be prayed for and God deliver you and then you'll get sick again and we recognize the bodies themselves they age but yet within it when new life has moved in there is a life on the inside that witnesses in the midst of it and through that life being there it actually will close us to submit our characters to be molded by the very Lamb of God Himself working in our life now remember he will never drag us lay his hands on us he doesn't work in threatening he wants us to submit to his working I'm glad that every once in a while he knows how to give the right type of anesthesia Coahoma he knows exactly what kind of things amidst to drop our way to just calls us to to rest and to and to just be an ease within him so when we look at this you know you think of it that how that Paul himself would speak this in second Corinthians four I just referred to it he speaks of how that we are troubled on every side everything that is going on that is around this Paul would speak about how we feel he would speak about were perplexed but we're not in despair were persecuted but we're not forsaken we're cast down but we're not destroyed but he goes on to tell that we are always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also might be made manifest in our body that's what we desire right we want his life to be reflected in our life that's the desire from within our hearts now when we think of this thought if I just let me work with this year for a few moments in that particular verse of scripture that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and just look at the thought just for a moment and the power of his resurrection in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse 8 here is Paul relaying this to the Corinthian church this is just the very next verse what would take place after we opening our test he said for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life now it wasn't that they hated life that's not what despair even though it's the same word that I referred to here earlier but it's where that within the end of it there there is without without God stepping in I mean this looks like this is it now think of it Paul goes on to relay these things he would comfort the Thessalonica Church he would comfort the Ephesian Church because think of how that the church is within that time they themselves it's obvious that when Paul himself would be afflicted you know it would it would for him bring him into prayer but Paul could sensed a little bit of a nervousness and Paul would bring it back to and say hey this suffering of tribulation don't worry about I would that you would not be anxious with this because how that God himself has spoken concerning it and Paul would speak even to the Corinthian church and let her know you know how we apostles were appointed unto death now to think of that you're appointed unto death you just don't know when it's going to come will you realize this morning you are I don't have the guarantee of even walking out this door that isn't to scare us it's just we we do not have the say so of how long that we live upon this earth that's in the hands of Almighty God in the book of Job that says that he holds and determines our ins it's not in us but notice Paul himself is letting it be known that in this time right here we even despaired even life but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves and might I say that you and I have that same sentence of death if we try to trust in ourselves but what did Paul say but in God which raises the dead it was gonna take God to move on this situation if Paul and them were to walk out alive so the sentence of death there had to be a resolve within it that's this scripture relates that calling them were able to come to a resolve and looking to God and know the Lord if this is the end this will be the end but there no doubt remember faith will always find the perfect will of God you with me somebody can look like they're on death's door from crossing over that don't mean oh my they must be a gonna go ahead and pass but yet that don't mean that it might be that it may not be God's will but God will turn right back around if it's not his will he will raise them right out I don't care how far gone they could have even have coated but yet God Himself will move if it's not their time to go Omaha so now for think of this here who delivered us from so great a death and death deliver we trust that he will yet deliver us Wow he delivered us from a great death and we're trusting he's going to keep on delivering us Paul knew hey we're going to be in situations we're going to need his deliverance you're also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thinks may be given by many on our behalf now to think of this within our lives human nature is survival human nature is survival when things would come our way our quick reaction would be to move and to do what fly you know it's it's run to get out of it to get out of the situation it's human nature within this but to think here is Paul in them they're not able to run anywhere but yet they have a place of refuge right where they're at in captivity the Lord Jesus Christ is ministry comfort and grace to them if you permit me to say it this way no doubt the anesthesia of the love of God is moving down oh my there you're talking about into anxiety pills it was moving down by the comfort of Almighty God for palling them to be able to stand within this do you understand this is not the natural DNA of a man it's not our natural DNA this has to be something and one who is greater in us in the midst of this time no wonder Peter could say that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold that it might be found to the praise and honor and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ now tell your truthfully sometimes we need the power of the Resurrection to operate to bring us out of despair sometimes we've been in despair and we need the power of the Resurrection not just in coming to change my body or raise it up if I go by the way of the grave there are times coming out of a test or trial and just to put it frankly every test or trial that we come through it's the power of the resurrection working in our life because before the Lord Jesus himself could ever be raised from the grave and we look at that triumph in Easter morning let me remind you he had to submit himself on to death I I find it a marvel in the scriptures in Philippians of how they Paul moved by the unction the Holy Ghost would say and he being found in fashion as a man who MA here is God Himself being found in fashion as a man and yet he was able to submit himself it wasn't easy the Prophet tells us he sprayed strong prayers contending with himself who do you contend with yourself he contended with himself he did not say oh boy the cross he prayed three times let it pass from me the Bible says in the book of Hebrews that he endured it for the joy that was set before him that which was afterwards there's Rhian door but it ain't him because with all glory to God this trial now we endure by his comfort his grace ministering to us to help us through it so we need that in times that the Lord would help us in despair because sometimes going right through the midst of a trial we can get down we can get discouraged I know sometimes we can try our best I'm gonna put on the right attitude I'm gonna be and we've gotten you know the quotes we got the scriptures going I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna it's you trying it's me trying but I know what should we do at that time just why don't you just worship Him a little bit just just worship him and invite him when we're trying to do it we're keeping him at bay but remember it must be his comfort invite him that he himself will comfort you in the midst of that time now thank you of this here we need that because you know there's many times we feel like we've got all we can do you're at the end it's like the woman she spent all her living on all the doctors she was at her end but then when she got when she was at her in that's when Jesus said I'll take that case it didn't mean that everything that was done all she shouldn't spend money she's a no he allowed her to go through all of that that he might manifest his care do you realize if she had been bettered by the circumstance she would have never been able to receive from him she would have been so bitter that what she needed her bitterness from going through the circumstance would have closed her off god help us we need that resurrection power to move in our heart we needed to move in our hearts as wives as husbands resurrection power we need that resurrection power to deliver us when bloom wants to set in when despair wants to set in when oppressive thoughts wants to set in we need a matter of a station of that resurrection power remember before he could be raised he had to submit what I want that resurrection pop you have to submit everything has been bought on submission submission is recognizing him to be the greater one he's gone so many times the Scriptures quoted resist the devil here free from you a key phrase is missed submit yourselves therefore to God that's the first thing cement means voluntarily placing yourself your life under him then resist the devil because it isn't your power my power it's God's power Goodrem said he don't have to obey me he said Satan you don't have to obey me but you have to obey the voice of the one I represent hallelu girl repeater God now watch Paul here in this second Corinthians let's keep moving through the scriptures here a little bit on this let you're very familiar with this point in the scripture here is Paul he's speaking about the things that he himself has been going through in verse 7 as 2nd Corinthians 12 and lest I should get exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buff at me let's just clear this up you've heard him say many times but let's just clear it out this was not sin Paul was not saying oh I got a problem with Lawson that no that's not what this is this was not sin he said to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buff at me lest I should be exalted above measure what understanding he's recognizing this has come to keep me no not always dragging around but to where that God can use him he's realized this it's needful Paul realizes there's still that part in the first birth of pride that can raise up I need this but you see this was not Paul's understanding this was the understanding of the Lord given to Paul you think about what rest this brought to Paul then for this one thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me and he sent unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities I may say help me Lord I'll raise both of my hands help me Lord Lou the same you same there and no there's been there's been times but you know where it's not every time it's just when I say I need more of this I need this degree I need to come into this degree but notice now notice Paul brings this Paul brings this from not just the situation where his sight because after God had made himself known to to Paul there on the road to Damascus remember his eyes were constantly affected his eyesight would come and go he would pray and then think about the first time that Paul prayed now Paul listen Paul this was a man who had miracles that accompanied his ministry is that right there were blind people that were that were healed eyes that came about there were Devils casts on all of this within his ministry and yet Paul himself when this would have flicked his eyes he besought the Lord he asked God for deliverance Lord heal me of this and you know what the Lord came by and He healed him but then it came again and Paul prayed again Lord deliver me now Paul was praying like you and I would pray in that Lord deliver me in the sense that it'll never ever bother me again and there are things that that deliverance comes in that way that there are things that will never ever bother us again where God will so completely heal our body to where that affliction will never stick its head up again I'm Thomas Lee I'm talking about with us walking in the right crowd with the right profession staying under you know in fellowship with believers but I'm saying that if even if we do all of that there are times when there are infirmities there are weaknesses there are things then all of a sudden you might go for a year two years or whatever more and then here this thing comes on again and you're praying oh lord god lord give me strength over this Lord heal me Lord of this Lord help me with this Lord God and yet then God will move right in at that time it may not come in the same timeframe as it did before but then here what it might come again you see what Paul is God is teaching Paul is that Paul himself for this condition now you can't make this up I can't make this up I can't tell you this for your life and you can't tell me this from my life nobody could tell Paul this this was not some of them went up to Paul and said hey Paul by the way you know that condition you got your body I just think that God is gonna let that come and go because it's just gonna keep you Oh hehe Paul wouldn't received it like that Paul had to receive this from God so it just goes to show we don't have to make this up Paul wasn't drumming this up Paul was not doing that at all but Paul recognized as God helped him do you realize the help of God ministered to him so that Paul was not praying in a manner of deliverance of that this will never bother me again but he realized as God ministered to him that through the midst of it glory me in the midst of it that God's grace is sufficient to carry me through Paul could realize it's gonna come and it's gonna go did it not weaken it did it would weaken his flesh think about when things have come around your way you know it's funny when we get far removed from pain and whatever more sometimes we we kind of forget you know certain things you know it's like in the summer when you kind of forget how it was to feel sick and then one of the chicken Pig flus or whatever more comes around your way and then you remember oh wow I forgot this of how this feels God helps us remember those certain things so that we're able to really stand with sympathy for one another you realize brother Graham tells us here on the platform here's a woman that has stigmatized stigmatism in her eyes and brother brems says it's because you're nervous sister he said I know there's not many people that sever simplifies with you as a matter of fact many people just told you to get beside yourself wow that's real sympathy in it we were gonna face this thing know that and that's ignorance it never did and one bit of good for her but what did it sympathy God moved behind that need it lost why here's one standing right here that knew what nervousness was how many times you read brother Branham praying on the on the platform people with nervousness and he says God I'm standing here right now Lord God with myself with nervousness shaking ready to run off this platform but Lord would you touch my sister so Paul he's able here to glory and his infirmities not didn't mean that Paul walked around let's let's let's look at this here he didn't mean that Paul would walk around and say praise God I got an eye problem can I testify I got bad eyesight no that's not what this is Paul says I will glory in other words I will glorify God even when this comes upon my life where my praise where everything is directed is to God Lord your faithful Paul you need help getting up the step but God's good Lord you're faithful these were not empty statements he was glorifying God well this next one's a big statement therefore I take pleasure in infirmities help me Lord in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distress is for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong it shouldn't be no Marvel brother Graham tells us in the church age book he said we need the Lord to teach us how to be christ-like in suffering how can he teach us if we don't go to school all the way you can teach us how to be christ-like when suffering we got to go to schools of suffering now I know some of you you take different courses than me and I take different courses from you but God knows what courses are named I need maybe I need the remedial math maybe you're in trigonometry right now you pray for me because maybe you're in remedial english and i'm an AP right now come on friends cuz there ain't none of you all on AP including me so it's a submission to the very testing of all-mighty God you know because human nature is where many times we're looking and how to get out of things and we're not downplaying that we're talking that's human nature to look how to get out of it God is taking Paul as he's revealed personally nopal Paul's focus then is not in that manner to where it would be completely deliverance in that way what does that do it actually brings a stability and a settling within Paul so Paul realizes hey there ain't nothing in my life there ain't nothing holding got back from completely touching my eyes to where this will never come back but it actually removes that a place that Satan would be able to come and poke at him and say he don't love you he don't care for you like that other brother did or this or and that it actually removes that so this understanding it removes it to where that Paul is able to glory in the Lord now watch this as Paul could go on to express here in second Timothy chapter 3 he goes on and he talks about in verse 11 the persecutions and afflictions he's calling these things - Timothy's attention all of those things that I came unto me at Antioch Iconium and Lystra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me now that delivered me did not mean they went away it just simply means he was delivered and he lived to tell of God's comfort it was a witness and an encouragement even to these believers now think of this here when then when Paul would come from one city the next how did you get here well um they let me down in the basket oh yeah this is your Paul you the ministry were Devils are cast out and the sick is healed and you say you let down in a basket yeah tell us how that happened well I was fasting and I was praying no penny what the scripture says Paul learned it from somebody coming and telling him come on now they're laying in wait for you so Paul was look at look at this humility Paul was not in a place with less gun I'm the messenger of the house I'll take control of this city ah that was not it he submitted himself in that way to be let down by a basket how'd you get delivered now I'm sure in that service mile there were testimonies you know how God delivered people blinded eyes were open and such pumping can you tell us it's good to see here tonight Paul tell us how tell us how God delivered you well I heard they were had a garrison around the city of Damascus and some of the brothers you know we're talking to me about it and and and we just you know we decided to that night they're gonna let me down by the side of the wall but praise God God delivered me don't you see this is where friends I don't care look listen to me now very carefully it might be that God has moved and a miracle has taken place in your life where maybe you didn't have to go through a surgery you didn't have to go through something like that and then there might be another brother or sister that's had to pass right under the knife it might be for the exact same thing let me just tell you this there's not one greater than the other it still is the Lord that has delivered you don't ever be ashamed of the deliverance of the Lord and don't ever try to put it in a box to where it be more glorious if it's this way I asked you the question would it have been more glorious for God to change Abraham and Sarah and not make them wait 25 years or was it more glorious that after 25 years the baby came as a matter of fact brother BAM tells us and believe in then believe us now this he says it takes greater faith to believe God by taking a promise he said then it does for a miracle to take place because why you take the promise and the devil is going to try you on that promise you've got a span of time and you're confessing that promise maybe you're afraid for right here and all of a sudden the power of God has moved through your life you don't mean you may not live back to your seat but you might win back to your seat but you know right there within your heart the power of the Resurrection has struck and lifted that promise to you personally and you say praise God I'm delivered and still walking back with a limp on your leg but you see it's already risen in your heart you've already been delivered in your heart it's over yeah all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution this will buy many people don't want to live for the Lord they don't want to suffer persecution it's okay when they're around Christian people but when they get out from around Christian people and they get around their buddies and whatever more they go right back to the same way you know why they do not have a power within them to actually hold them Association is not good enough but this is what accompanies those who live godly in christ jesus persecution now there's not one of us sticking our hands I'm saying I'll take a dose I'll take some persecution yeah then none of us will be that foolish but yet we know as Peter would express to us by the Spirit of God rejoice Oh Lord you mean I've got to be told to rejoice you mean that's not just something to just automatic you know what he's speaking to sons and daughters of God the Spirit of God moving on our life removes the amnesia that I am a son and daughter of God but the word come and forth reminds you and I you have a jurisdiction over your own self the authority we can consent to that yield to it submit to it then it comes forth to minister in our lives notice this second Timothy 4 I'm coming down 2nd Timothy 4 I need a long runway but I'm coming 2nd Timothy 4 verse 17 notwithstanding here Paul here he is at the latter part the departure in his life notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and Trenton me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the line not just the presence the mouth I was rescued did God come down and take the line away no he just brought him through and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever so you see as God moved as he was moving here in the early church it was not them drawing attention to themselves but it was the very life of Christ on display in their life that actually it was drawing that II the evil spirits drawing Satan to where Satan was so stirred up at the working and the reflection there of what was going on their life do you realize brother Ram tells us he said on the day of Pentecost when they were filled with the Spirit of God he said Satan never even got out of his bed that morning but after gate called beautiful he said that's when Satan got up sentencing huh why it's a life being reflected and going forth that's what got Satan upset so when that life is being reflected can't you see while he tries to stifle why he tries to keep back why tries to busy so many other things around us I'll tell you just as we said moments ago you take something that God has dealt with your heart on it and you might say well I'm not all the way there yet but if you can stand on that and say I'm recognize that's God's Word and you stand on that watch God come and be a defense and back up because you're standing on the word and as more the word comes you keep taking that word you keep standing on that word and you watch that the Lord continues to mount the defense within your life mm-hmm girl repeater God so here remember its Jobe would say he put strengthen us think about even how that here was Peter you know Peter didn't know when they put Peter in jail that time James was killed but the Bible tells us prayer was being made for Peter continually Peter and James but to look at it here James his life God goes ahead and brings him on home and here is Peter and Peter the Bible says that the angel the Lord in acts 12 the angel of the Lord comes in to Peter and says stand up put your garment on gird yourself it's time to go now here they were they were praying and Peter it says it like this in verse 11 when Peter was come to himself oh I'll think of that Peter didn't know what was going on well that Peter was having to pinch himself the Bible said when he came to himself now I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews they were ready to kill him but God said I'm not done with him yet you realize who Peter gives the glory to God hath sent his angel the governor and everybody else of the land will never have went down to the sale of where he was they would give orders for other people to go down but God Himself came down to where Peter was that same God that came down to where Peter was is the same God that comes down to where you and I are at that same God comes right down in the power of his resurrection when we've been in despair in the midst of the tribulation in the midst of the trial that same God the age of the Lord comes down as we've submitted ourselves to him and asking him lord help my attitude Lord help me in the midst of this Lord I want to give you glory I want to give you praise it's inviting his presence to deliver us you see this is why you can see that we need help because human nature is always too look for a way out human nature is always to tell somebody well ok you got this problem here he's reading that's a problem see it's because it just isn't it that's anybody can do that there are times for that but we're so interested in trying to get things out there's a part of human nature get out of trouble here get out of this here oh Lord I can't wait til I get done with the tribulation I can't wait til I get done with the test don't miss the comfort of the Lord you see through the midst of it it's God taking self away from us to realize first of all he knows what he's doing this is for his glory not mine and whatever and however that this would choose to be if if it is if it ever comes out to be a blessing to be a help to somebody else in his body then so be it Lord but where it starts with it's for his glory no wonder that David could say in a very familiar reading of Scripture it's a funny how that this scripture is what is wrote on the back of cards of funeral homes it's a scripture that's wrote over and over many times we hear it when we have funerals but the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want see how this is personal now this is personal between us and the Lord he's my shepherd well if he's my shepherd that means I'm his sheep I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures does not he give us solitude rest and peace he does just like he did in the early church at times they would have rest he leadeth me beside the still waters so that I can look and I can see the reflection in the waters he leads me there he wants me to see myself in him look at this verse he restoreth my soul he does this who my shepherd it doesn't it isn't that I need to get born again and again and again again no that's not what this is he restoreth my soul when distress when things have come and persecutions or sickness or whatever the tester trial whatever form that it is but yet here he comes and he restores my soul ranging all of these parts around me he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me I thought this was a funeral song it is you and I need to die more to ourselves let the shepherd lead us not help me to submit to the test and to the trials because without submission there'll be no resurrection but in order for there to be resurrection there's got to be submission all under Paul could say that through the Fellowship of his sufferings then I would be made conformable unto his death this is his working I said it's his working it's him bringing it about in our lives not forcefully not forcefully he knows just like he knows how to correct me or correct you in trials trials ain't always correction it helps to dissolve by the acids all things that are not him that the picture of him might come forth tests and trials are like dark rooms they're like dark rooms where there is a picture to come forth but through the time it's moving away in that image begins to come forth you know brother Branham compared that to 1964 the translation of the bride of Jesus Christ it's the life being developed in us and he told us that sticky carnal nature will bother you until this new life has been fully developed within us but I say this morning greater is He that is in me he's leading me and you in paths of righteousness for his name's sake what a path to righteousness where faith is required to say I trust you lord that's righteousness i trust you lord i don't know what salgo i don't know what it all has been i trust you you're in control Lord as our Shepherd now prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever let me read this in closing Psalms 138 though the Lord be high yet hath you respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth the far though I walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me isaiah 57:15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i'd dwell in the high and holy place and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones aren't you glad he knows how only he can do that but there every test and every trial that you've come through maybe there's some right now no doubt all of us can look back there's something you can say I I don't think I really received a benefit that I maybe should have received but I think with all of us right now we could stand here or sit or within our hearts stand and say lord help me Lord not just saying help me in terms of you know Lord I've you know I've failed in this but Lord I know that you're able to help me Lord to where I can glory in my infirmities it doesn't mean you'll be skipping into church now it doesn't mean we're that's not who are talking about it's to wear that steel within your heart there is glory and praise to him you might be going through the greatest time of your life but your face or your body is so broad in line by the Spirit of God where people would never know that you're going through it but yet within there's a meeting with you in the Lord don't remember here I said I was closing and I am but this is why Paul said that he would glory in his infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me and that phrase the power of Christ is his tent his presence God has Church he comes down and has a meeting with us in the midst of our infirmities he's right there with us he pitches his tent now think about it he could pinch his tent a lot of places but glory he'll pitch his tent his presence his presidency won't he don't cut away the tribulation they don't cut away the trial but it gives us strength it gives us grace it gives us comfort I'd say this more if you don't know the Lord what an opportunity to know one who's a friend that'll stick closer than a brother that you can know him in that way to know him in a personal relationship not by a story but he's a person he's the author of life and this morning you can know him that way and even within our lives here this morning we can say Lord consecrate me I don't want bitterness coming out of my life for the tests the trials there might be experiences that you've been through in your life in the past maybe there's still bitterness that's there why don't you just allow the Holy Spirit to say cleanse me Lord take away that bitterness that resentment that Lord I want to be a channel that can come through brother Samuel can he do that by the power of his resurrection he sure can he's more than able if you believe you put that before him this morning he's more than able let's pray Lord Jesus father the words Lord it's Lord God you've laid upon our hearts help us or Jesus Lord we love you I believed your God that our hearts we desire to serve you better Lord or Jesus in your presence here this morning there's many needs Lord as always when we gathered together there's needs on the level Lord God of being that Lord were a soul that really needs to be touched Lord God and father they would desire I want to know him not just know about him I want to know him Lord would you minister to that hand that would lift up in your presence say I want to know him minister to them Lord even deeper as they've raised in submission to recognize Lord not to me but to recognize in honor that your presence is dealing with their life I wonder would there be one here this morning that you'd be willing to be honest before the Lord in that maybe your life you haven't turned your life over to the Lord but you just would want to but I love that that hands say pray from me the Lord is dealing with my life god bless you god bless you Heavenly Father you see Lord got each and every hand Lord you see most importantly the hearts that's behind it Lord God I pray that you administer to them your salvation Lord God what God as they've willingly raised that hand Lord and you would come to stand behind them Lord because they're standing on your word you always stand with your word order here this morning I don't know Lord but perhaps through this congregation undoubtedly there's hearts right now that they're asking their desires Lord restore my soul maybe through the midst of tests and trials where they've come through and Lord not just even of something present but even from this moment forward Lord from our hearts we can recognize the value of submission help us the Lord not to try even though it's part of the human nature Lord God we're we're all we're trying to get out of trials trying to get out of tests but sometimes we find things or God we're here we are we're praying we're giving you glory and then Lord God in a moment things can come around our way and we think my when's this gonna end this is when this is so long and we get weary but then Lord you'll come along it might be via text phone call email ran out here in the lobby it might be Lord God a brother's sister dropping us a card or coming by our way it might be Lord God of our spouse ministering to us I've witnessed it so many times Lord it just encourages me and it don't take away the test or the trial but it removes that weariness that part to where I can look to you and say Lord that's true you're in control or I pray this morning as we we look back over the tests and trials and even presently right now Lord God our desire is that you pitch your tent your tent would be pitched upon our lives your presence Lord help us Lord God help us may we mature more and more and Lord we know that maturity isn't that we know more maturity is more submission it's greater trust greater humility greater realization that's not odd that liveth but Christ that liveth in me anybody want to be remembered in prayer that would be your request Lord help me Lord help me to submit now men it'd be sensitive or Jesus behind the hands Lord we lift him up before you or this is our desire we're asking you in order to help us grant to us Lord grant to us Lord that we might be more submissive Lloyd help us lord I pray or God to be able to glory in our infirmities Lord to be able to worship you to be able to be an encouragement to one another Lord the Lord we can receive of that comfort Lord Father may your cleansing flow if there be any bitterness any resentment Lord we pray Heavenly Father but by the washing of water by the word let it just be cleanse from our life start granite Lord in
