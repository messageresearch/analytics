[39:14] man certainly appreciate that song amen
[39:17] you can be seated in the presence of the
[39:18] lord i certainly appreciate that song
[39:21] it's
[39:23] one of those that just um
[39:26] what i call a declaration of your faith
[39:28] when you're when you're going through
[39:30] various seasons of life
[39:33] uh it's it's so good to know
[39:36] that you can turn to the word of god and
[39:38] get a promise
[39:39] and the good thing about god's promises
[39:42] and what i what i've found what i've
[39:44] come to understand
[39:46] is that
[39:48] our doubt
[39:50] can't even stop
[39:53] god's promises from coming to pass
[39:57] our doubt may hinder it
[40:00] but it can't stop it
[40:02] when god speaks something it must come
[40:05] to pass
[40:10] and that's why i like the word says you
[40:12] said
[40:13] i believe
[40:15] and because you said
[40:17] it's already done
[40:20] hallelujah it was finishing god's mind
[40:22] once he spoke amen all we got to do is
[40:25] believe it receive it god bless you

[1:12:01] now the next day
[1:12:03] that followed the day of the preparation
[1:12:07] the chief priests and pharisees came
[1:12:09] together unto pilate
[1:12:11] saying sir we remember
[1:12:15] that that deceiver said
[1:12:18] or he was yet alive after three days i
[1:12:22] will rise again
[1:12:25] command therefore that the sepulcher be
[1:12:27] made sure
[1:12:29] until the third day
[1:12:31] lest his disciples come by night and
[1:12:33] steal him away and say unto the people
[1:12:36] he has risen from the dead
[1:12:38] so the last error shall be worse than
[1:12:41] the first
[1:12:43] pilate said unto them ye have a watch
[1:12:47] go your way make it
[1:12:49] as sure as
[1:12:51] ye can
[1:12:52] so they went and made the sepulcher sure
[1:12:55] sealing the stone
[1:12:58] and setting a watch
[1:13:00] amen
[1:13:02] praise the lord the lord had a blessing
[1:13:05] to the reading of his word you can be
[1:13:06] seated
[1:13:10] we want to
[1:13:11] take for
[1:13:12] our title today
[1:13:16] their rock is not like our rock
[1:13:30] praise the lord so um as we just kind of
[1:13:32] get started here
[1:13:34] i'm reminded of a
[1:13:36] sermon
[1:13:37] the prophet preached and uh i know my
[1:13:39] redeemer liveth
[1:13:41] and
[1:13:43] he was
[1:13:44] talking about a chaplain
[1:13:46] one easter morning was overseas
[1:13:50] and uh while they were overseas
[1:13:52] in battle
[1:13:54] this easter morning the troops many of
[1:13:56] them that were wounded were inside the
[1:13:58] red cross hospital
[1:14:01] and he said on this easter morning the
[1:14:03] chaplain saw a nurse come in
[1:14:06] to the red cross hospital and she had
[1:14:08] just roses
[1:14:10] that she was giving out to all the
[1:14:12] soldiers and as she was handing these
[1:14:14] rope these roses out to the soldiers
[1:14:17] the roses just i mean that the soldiers
[1:14:19] began to just go into tears crying amen
[1:14:22] after receiving this rose
[1:14:24] and what was moving these soldiers is
[1:14:26] that they knew the area that they were
[1:14:28] in
[1:14:29] uh pretty much everything there was um
[1:14:33] dissolved through some of the gases that
[1:14:36] were released in the uh in the in the in
[1:14:38] the war is you know no trees no grass no
[1:14:42] nothing but when they saw that red rose
[1:14:44] it actually gave them a hope they said
[1:14:46] in the land from where we come there's
[1:14:49] still some green grass amen there's
[1:14:51] still some trees there's still some
[1:14:53] things growing and i don't care how
[1:14:55] hopeless life may look like right here
[1:14:58] where i'm standing i know where i come
[1:15:00] from there's still some life
[1:15:02] hallelujah sometimes we find ourselves
[1:15:04] in situations like that we backslide
[1:15:06] from god and it seems like things are
[1:15:08] just very uh i mean just uh uh just
[1:15:11] bleak and uh we just can't get any we
[1:15:14] can't we don't see no life nowhere
[1:15:16] around us but if we can just get back
[1:15:17] into the presence of the lord we'll find
[1:15:20] somewhere where there's life amen praise
[1:15:22] god some people are still on fire for
[1:15:24] god some people are still living for god
[1:15:26] amen but you know as as as the story was
[1:15:28] going you know the uh the prophet said
[1:15:31] you know these soldiers were just crying
[1:15:32] because they they they knew these roses
[1:15:34] come from back home
[1:15:36] and he said you know what i just need to
[1:15:38] get out this this chaplain said i need
[1:15:40] to kind of separate myself from the
[1:15:42] people and i need to get out amen and i
[1:15:44] mean these these guys just crying i
[1:15:46] wanted to maybe get outside and there
[1:15:47] was one soldier saying you know i'm
[1:15:49] getting to take a little mission out to
[1:15:50] the front line and uh the chaplain said
[1:15:52] hey let me go out there he says i got to

[1:16:08] place and go out and see so as they were
[1:16:10] out riding and just observing and
[1:16:12] writing their report on what they would

[1:16:26] he couldn't understand why the lord had
[1:16:29] led him to this rock
[1:16:31] hallelujah but as he went over to the
[1:16:34] rock
[1:16:35] amen and he started praying and said
[1:16:37] lord why did you lead me here to this
[1:16:39] rock then god just began to deal with
[1:16:42] him

[1:16:46] hallelujah amen just he says he says
[1:16:49] just he says he didn't understand why
[1:16:51] everything around him was bleak
[1:16:53] no trees no grass just everything is is
[1:16:56] absorbed but he says but pick up the
[1:16:58] rock and when he picked up the rock he
[1:17:01] looked underneath the rock hallelujah
[1:17:04] and there was an easter lily starting to
[1:17:07] bloom under the rock
[1:17:09] glory to god and what he realized is
[1:17:12] that no matter what the gases did to the
[1:17:14] grass and no matter what the gas did to
[1:17:17] the trees amen this easter lily was
[1:17:21] protected by the rock

[1:17:37] you out in the hospital with that
[1:17:39] sickness you have been protected by the
[1:17:43] rock and i'm here to tell you their rock

[1:17:56] amen amen
[1:17:58] my you know so here you know we as we go
[1:18:01] through this thought today we want to
[1:18:03] understand we have a rock
[1:18:05] we have a rock it's it's it's very sure
[1:18:09] it's very certain that we're standing on
[1:18:11] a rock amen and we find throughout the
[1:18:14] scriptures the the the use of rock
[1:18:18] or the reference of god being a rock
[1:18:21] it's all throughout the scriptures
[1:18:23] and i want to just pick up a couple of
[1:18:25] them today first samuel 2 and 2. amen i
[1:18:28] want to read that to you first samuel 2
[1:18:30] and 2
[1:18:31] it says this
[1:18:32] there is none holy as the lord
[1:18:36] amen for there is none beside thee it
[1:18:40] says neither is there any rock
[1:18:43] like our god
[1:18:45] i just love the word of god neither is
[1:18:47] there any rock
[1:18:49] like our god
[1:18:51] we also find in psalm 78 and 35
[1:18:55] and they remember
[1:18:57] that god was their rock
[1:19:01] they remembered that god was their rock
[1:19:04] and the high god their
[1:19:06] redeemer also in isaiah 42 and 11 it
[1:19:10] says this let the wilderness and the
[1:19:12] cities thereof lift up their voice
[1:19:15] the villages that khadar doth inhabit
[1:19:17] let the inhabitants of the rock sing
[1:19:22] let them shout from the top of the
[1:19:24] mountain
[1:19:26] now you know as i as i read that
[1:19:28] scripture you know i say let the
[1:19:30] inhabitants of the rock sing
[1:19:34] you know a testimony that come to me um
[1:19:36] brother diggs was uh preaching and i and
[1:19:39] i heard him minister uh on something
[1:19:41] that he was saying how he went to uh
[1:19:44] canada i believe it was and he had he
[1:19:45] had some services and the pastor told
[1:19:48] him this has been covet you know i guess
[1:19:50] it's hard to say when covet was was like
[1:19:53] really really spreading because it's
[1:19:55] still spreading it's something we got to
[1:19:56] live with
[1:19:58] amen brother brother branham called it a
[1:19:59] pandemonic
[1:20:02] that's it's a quote in there it's a
[1:20:03] pandemonic
[1:20:04] right and uh and you'll find it it's
[1:20:06] just something we live with
[1:20:08] amen just like the flu we live with it
[1:20:10] praise god we're not afraid of it we
[1:20:11] live with it
[1:20:13] we're protected by a rock
[1:20:18] brother diggs was talking he said he was
[1:20:20] going to canada the pastor says you know
[1:20:21] brother i didn't know i think and i
[1:20:23] should have canceled the services
[1:20:24] because
[1:20:25] all the people got sick you know just
[1:20:27] just a lot of people got sick and said i
[1:20:28] don't know what to do here uh he's like
[1:20:30] brother it's okay let's just go on with
[1:20:32] the services whoever's there let's just
[1:20:33] go on and it says he says i'm not gonna
[1:20:35] get sick so he went on and start
[1:20:37] preaching and one night he start feeling
[1:20:39] a little
[1:20:40] something coming on his body
[1:20:42] and he says oh my i don't told the
[1:20:43] pastor i wasn't gonna get sick and say i
[1:20:45] don't know what this is that's happening
[1:20:47] he says he kind of got up in the middle
[1:20:49] of the night
[1:20:50] and he began to just start humming a
[1:20:53] song to the lord
[1:20:55] amen and as he began to sing that song
[1:20:57] to the lord
[1:20:59] it led him into another song and every
[1:21:01] song the anointing just began to race
[1:21:04] and then it went from a second song to a
[1:21:06] third song he was really into the spirit
[1:21:08] and before you knew it he had forgot
[1:21:10] about his illness he forgot about the
[1:21:13] symptoms that were come trying to come
[1:21:15] down the inhabitant of the rock begin to
[1:21:18] sing
[1:21:19] and i want to encourage you when you're
[1:21:21] going through sometimes you don't know
[1:21:22] what scripture to turn to sometimes you
[1:21:25] don't eat i mean you can get through you
[1:21:27] can you can get down so bad you don't
[1:21:28] even know how to pray
[1:21:31] praise the lord but if you can just find
[1:21:33] a song that you can get begin to sing
[1:21:36] god will elevate you
[1:21:38] your spirit will get elevated the
[1:21:40] inhabitant of the rock begins to sing
[1:21:43] and god will bring you out of whatever
[1:21:45] you're going through
[1:21:47] hallelujah daniel 2 45 says for as much
[1:21:51] as thou saw us that the stone was cut
[1:21:53] out of the mountain without hands and
[1:21:56] that it breaking pieces the iron the
[1:21:58] brass the clay the silver and the gold
[1:22:01] and the great god have made known to the
[1:22:03] king what should come to pass here after
[1:22:05] and the dream is certain and the
[1:22:06] interpretation thereof sure so daniel
[1:22:09] saw a man there in uh in his vision that
[1:22:12] there was a stone a rock cut out of the
[1:22:15] mountain without hands
[1:22:17] see we we got we got referenced in
[1:22:19] scripture that god is our rock
[1:22:25] oh hallelujah brother branham says this
[1:22:27] in the message what was the holy ghost
[1:22:28] given for
[1:22:30] he says there's only one way to find it
[1:22:32] there was a stone cut out of the
[1:22:34] mountain without hands that rolled into
[1:22:37] the world and smashed it out and it
[1:22:39] become like weed or chaff on the
[1:22:40] threshing floors
[1:22:42] let that stone
[1:22:44] the christ jesus that stumbling stone to
[1:22:47] the world a stone of an offense a
[1:22:49] laughing stone a stumbling block to the
[1:22:51] church
[1:22:52] but a precious and a load stone
[1:22:56] to the believer a stone of assurance a
[1:22:59] stone of rest
[1:23:01] oh my resting i know that i pass from
[1:23:03] death unto life my soul is at rest
[1:23:09] hallelujah it says oh come unto me all
[1:23:11] you that labor and heavy laden and i'll
[1:23:13] give you rest to your soul a sign that's
[1:23:16] to be evil spoken of and the prophet to
[1:23:18] marry it'll be a signed shirt will but
[1:23:20] it'll be an assurance it'll be a love
[1:23:22] it'll be a satisfaction it'll be
[1:23:24] something that you know you pass from
[1:23:26] death unto life
[1:23:28] this lodestone this rock is a loadstone
[1:23:31] to the believer and brother branham i
[1:23:33] mean when he says that the word lowstone
[1:23:35] means it's the focus of attention
[1:23:40] so christ is my focus of attention
[1:23:44] christ is my attraction the low stone is
[1:23:47] what the magnet is magnetized to and
[1:23:50] it's christ that we're magnetized to as
[1:23:52] a believer
[1:23:54] oh hallelujah we're magnetized to the
[1:23:56] rock
[1:23:58] amen
[1:23:59] i can't go anywhere without the rock
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:03] i can't live without the rock
[1:24:06] praise his holy name
[1:24:09] i don't want to go to work without the
[1:24:11] rock i don't want to go to school
[1:24:13] without the rock i want to be attracted
[1:24:16] and attached to the rock everywhere i go
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:21] we know david picked up a rock
[1:24:26] amen and he threw that rock at goliath
[1:24:29] and brother branham told us amen
[1:24:31] something in the statement says uh it
[1:24:33] says that rock was moving at a thousand
[1:24:35] miles per hour
[1:24:38] what man
[1:24:40] could pick up a rock
[1:24:42] and throw it at a thousand miles per
[1:24:44] hour
[1:24:45] no man can do that
[1:24:47] that means david picked up a
[1:24:49] supernatural rock
[1:24:52] hey
[1:24:53] hallelujah david had a supernatural rock
[1:24:58] that would take out his goliath and i'm
[1:25:00] here to tell you got the same
[1:25:02] supernatural rock
[1:25:03] that'll take out your goliath a goliath
[1:25:06] of sickness
[1:25:08] a goliath of unbelief use your
[1:25:10] supernatural rock what is that it's the
[1:25:13] rock of revelation
[1:25:20] glory to god
[1:25:22] brother branham was preaching the
[1:25:24] message uh shalom
[1:25:27] and and uh when he when when he picked
[1:25:30] this sermon up to preach it he took a
[1:25:32] scripture out of
[1:25:34] psalm 62 and let's just go and read that
[1:25:37] psalm 62.
[1:25:39] oh glory glory glory
[1:25:42] the scripture just references rocks all
[1:25:45] over god being a rock
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:50] here in psalm 62
[1:25:53] truly my soul
[1:25:54] waiteth upon god
[1:25:57] from him cometh my salvation
[1:25:59] look at this look at david what he says
[1:26:01] he only
[1:26:04] is my rock
[1:26:06] [Applause]
[1:26:08] oh
[1:26:10] church
[1:26:11] you know this this really means
[1:26:13] something to me
[1:26:15] amen when when david
[1:26:17] um
[1:26:19] uh can say this you know let's just keep
[1:26:21] reading i'll get to it a little bit
[1:26:22] later says he only is my rock and my
[1:26:25] salvation
[1:26:27] he is my defense
[1:26:32] oh
[1:26:33] my goodness my goodness my goodness you
[1:26:36] know
[1:26:36] i was gonna say let me just release it
[1:26:40] just i want you to get david's words
[1:26:44] he only
[1:26:48] is my rock
[1:26:51] go back in david's life
[1:26:53] and there was a time where he was on the
[1:26:55] run from saul
[1:26:57] praise god and as he's running from saul
[1:27:00] a man david runs into a cave
[1:27:04] and as he's trying to hide from saul it
[1:27:07] just so happened
[1:27:09] that saul comes into the same cave
[1:27:14] it was so dark in that it couldn't see
[1:27:15] each other but i can just imagine david
[1:27:18] didn't want to sneeze
[1:27:20] david didn't want to david did not want
[1:27:22] to give away his position
[1:27:24] and even one of david's men said you
[1:27:26] know the lord has led your enemy right
[1:27:28] into your hands
[1:27:30] he says if you let me go i'll smite him
[1:27:32] right now and you won't you won't hear
[1:27:34] from him ever again he says no i can't
[1:27:36] touch the lord's anointing so i believe
[1:27:38] he just made me cut a little piece of
[1:27:40] his garment or something like that and
[1:27:41] before you know it a saul rose up and
[1:27:43] walked outside of the cave and when he
[1:27:46] walked out david yelled from inside the
[1:27:48] cage and said saul why are you seeking
[1:27:50] after me and david realized that it was
[1:27:53] not hallelujah
[1:27:55] amen it was not the cave that was his
[1:27:58] rock
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:01] because the enemy came into the cave
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:07] so this is why david could write it was
[1:28:09] not the case i was hiding from my enemy
[1:28:12] inside the cave but the enemy came into
[1:28:15] my cave
[1:28:17] but god delivered me from my enemy and
[1:28:20] that's why i can say he only
[1:28:24] is my rock
[1:28:29] sometimes we trust in so many other
[1:28:32] things but we should only trust in god
[1:28:35] he only is my rock
[1:28:38] and my salvation
[1:28:42] he is my defense
[1:28:47] i shall not be moved
[1:28:52] let's look at what david is writing to
[1:28:54] us
[1:28:56] how long will you imagine mischief
[1:28:59] against the man ye shall be slain all of
[1:29:02] you as a bowing wall shall you be and
[1:29:04] has a tottering fence
[1:29:06] they only consult to cast him down from
[1:29:08] his excellency
[1:29:09] they delighted lies
[1:29:12] they blessed with their mouth
[1:29:14] but they cursed inwardly
[1:29:16] salah
[1:29:17] my soul wait thou only upon god
[1:29:22] hallelujah for my expectation is from
[1:29:24] him
[1:29:26] here david says it again
[1:29:28] he only
[1:29:32] i'm not dependent on my boss
[1:29:36] i'm not dependent on amen what the
[1:29:38] doctor has to do and what he's
[1:29:40] recommending hey he only is my rock
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:49] he only is my rock and
[1:29:53] and it's a conjunction word that means
[1:29:56] david is thinking about this he's my
[1:29:58] rock and
[1:30:00] my salvation
[1:30:02] glory
[1:30:03] he is my defense i shall not be moved
[1:30:08] and god is my salvation and my glory the
[1:30:10] rock of my strength
[1:30:13] and my refuge is in god
[1:30:16] then he encourages us trust in him at
[1:30:19] all times ye people
[1:30:21] pour out your heart before him god is a
[1:30:23] refuge for us
[1:30:26] salah
[1:30:27] amen surely men of low degree are vanity
[1:30:30] men of high degree are alive to be laid
[1:30:33] in the balance they are all together
[1:30:34] lighter than vanity trust not in
[1:30:36] oppression
[1:30:38] amen and become not vain and robbery if
[1:30:41] riches increase
[1:30:43] set not your heart upon them
[1:30:47] god has spoken once
[1:30:49] twice have i heard this that power
[1:30:52] belongeth to god
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:57] also unto thee o lord belong with mercy
[1:30:59] for thou rendrest to every man according
[1:31:01] to his work i love the way david just
[1:31:03] kept focusing and talking about how god
[1:31:06] only
[1:31:08] was his rock
[1:31:09] that's the way we have to have to come
[1:31:12] god only is a rock sometimes our family
[1:31:15] is our rock
[1:31:16] when we get into a little tight spot we
[1:31:18] need some money
[1:31:19] we know to go to a certain family man by
[1:31:21] a certain friend
[1:31:23] and then sometimes when they don't have
[1:31:24] it god leaves you
[1:31:26] in a place where you have to depend on
[1:31:28] him
[1:31:29] and he's always wanted you in that place
[1:31:32] where he only was your
[1:31:34] rock
[1:31:38] when we look at this
[1:31:40] rock
[1:31:42] amen uh let me uh oh yes let me just get
[1:31:46] this one right here
[1:31:47] oh
[1:31:49] my god my god my god
[1:31:52] here um
[1:31:56] the prophet said something here in the
[1:31:57] message the contest
[1:32:00] it says
[1:32:02] it's a prayer to these prayers he says
[1:32:03] make us fit servants
[1:32:06] forgive our past
[1:32:08] bless our future
[1:32:10] guide us o lord god with thy mighty hand
[1:32:13] jehovah bless these ministers here bless
[1:32:16] all the laity all the visitors be thou
[1:32:18] with us lord we are your servants and we
[1:32:20] give ourselves holy to you who says for
[1:32:23] 1963 i can say for 2022 amen that the
[1:32:27] power of your spirit
[1:32:29] might have more preeminence in our life
[1:32:31] and in our being help us god forgive us
[1:32:34] and help us we pray raise up mighty men
[1:32:41] raise up mighty warriors of the faith
[1:32:45] it says open this year lord
[1:32:48] that hidden manna
[1:32:49] that rock beneath the rock
[1:32:53] that we might see the program of god
[1:32:56] cap off the pyramids of our life lord
[1:32:58] put the capstone christ jesus upon each
[1:33:01] and every one of us may his great
[1:33:04] magnificent holy blessings be upon us
[1:33:06] all may the fire of the holy ghost come
[1:33:09] upon us may the power of the
[1:33:10] resurrection be manifested god how we
[1:33:13] thank you tonight we're yours we give
[1:33:15] ourselves fully to you lord
[1:33:18] open to us the rock
[1:33:21] beneath the rock
[1:33:25] i was listening to brother eugene braun
[1:33:28] preached one time
[1:33:30] and he made a statement
[1:33:31] you know that as i was coming here today
[1:33:34] i can see so many churches and a lot of
[1:33:37] a lot of cars and parking lots and
[1:33:39] things that nature
[1:33:40] people going to church on sunday but uh
[1:33:43] but brother eugene made this statement
[1:33:44] he says
[1:33:45] everybody
[1:33:47] praise god that's going into the church
[1:33:49] most of them are going to have a bible
[1:33:52] most of them going to go a lot of them
[1:33:53] got it i mean it still is the the most
[1:33:55] sold book in in the world the bible
[1:33:58] everybody got one hallelujah but it's
[1:34:01] more than just having a bible what we
[1:34:04] need god to do is open the rock beneath
[1:34:06] the rock
[1:34:09] amen see what it is is that everybody
[1:34:12] amen is not looking through a prophetic
[1:34:15] lens
[1:34:16] so when it when they're reading the
[1:34:17] scriptures they're still blinded to some
[1:34:20] things
[1:34:21] praise god amen they have what we call a
[1:34:25] public manner
[1:34:28] it's what we call everybody has a bible
[1:34:30] it's called public manner but when you
[1:34:32] begin to look through a prophetic lens
[1:34:35] you get the hidden manner
[1:34:38] the rock
[1:34:39] beneath the rock
[1:34:43] and that's why i'm saying their rock
[1:34:47] is not like our ride
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:56] let's look at some hidden manner
[1:35:00] turn with me to deuteronomy 32.
[1:35:12] verse 1 says give ear o ye heavens
[1:35:16] and i will speak and hear o earth the
[1:35:19] words of my mouth deuteronomy 32
[1:35:22] verse 2 my doctrine shall drop as the
[1:35:25] rain
[1:35:26] my speech shall distill as the dew as a
[1:35:29] small rain upon the tender herb and as
[1:35:32] it showers upon the grass
[1:35:34] and i love this because i will publish
[1:35:37] that mean i'm going to tell people about
[1:35:38] it because i will publish the name of
[1:35:40] the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our
[1:35:43] god
[1:35:47] look at what moses says
[1:35:49] he is the rock
[1:35:54] his work is perfect
[1:35:56] for all his ways of judgment
[1:35:58] a god of truth and without iniquity just
[1:36:01] and right as he
[1:36:03] now now there are some things happening
[1:36:04] here in the book of deuteronomy uh you
[1:36:07] know we know that this is two laws i
[1:36:09] believe amen is what it means and uh and
[1:36:11] and so there's uh you know a a blessing
[1:36:14] for those that are honoring or and
[1:36:16] obeying god's word but then there's a
[1:36:18] curse to those that will disobey god's
[1:36:21] word
[1:36:22] right so here moses is warning the
[1:36:23] people and he said he he i'm gonna
[1:36:25] publish and i'm gonna just ascribe
[1:36:27] greatness to my god i wanna tell
[1:36:29] everybody about my rock
[1:36:31] now we get down into verse 18. i'm just
[1:36:33] skipping here as we read this verse 18
[1:36:36] says of the rock that begot thee
[1:36:39] thou are unmindful some people forget
[1:36:41] where they came from
[1:36:43] they forget how the rock actually
[1:36:45] protected them they forget how the rock
[1:36:48] guided them and i mean the rock has been
[1:36:50] everything we needed but they forget
[1:36:51] that end times amen other rocks that
[1:36:54] begot thee thou are unmindful and has
[1:36:57] forgotten god that form thee never
[1:36:59] forget your rock
[1:37:05] skip down to verse 30
[1:37:07] verse 30 and chapter 32
[1:37:10] how
[1:37:12] should one chase a thousand
[1:37:15] and two put ten thousand till flight
[1:37:20] except
[1:37:23] their rock
[1:37:24] had sold them
[1:37:26] and the lord had shut them up
[1:37:29] the next verse
[1:37:31] for their rock
[1:37:33] is not as our rock
[1:37:37] even our enemies themselves being judges
[1:37:46] now you can see where the title comes
[1:37:48] from right out of the scripture their
[1:37:49] rock is not as our rock even our enemies
[1:37:52] themselves being judges
[1:37:56] let's go back to verse 30 though
[1:37:58] some hidden manna
[1:38:01] now how should one chase a thousand and
[1:38:04] two put ten thousand to flight except
[1:38:07] their rock
[1:38:08] had sold them
[1:38:11] now what does it mean for your rock to
[1:38:13] sell you
[1:38:15] oh hallelujah
[1:38:16] amen i was just looking this up in the
[1:38:18] hebrew lexicon
[1:38:20] and what it what it meant
[1:38:22] is that the rock
[1:38:24] had to be given over to death
[1:38:29] so if your rock sold you then it means
[1:38:32] your rock was willing to die for you
[1:38:40] a a rock that is willing to die for you
[1:38:42] is not a normal rock
[1:38:46] this is again another supernatural rock
[1:38:49] a rock that is willing to die for me a
[1:38:52] rock that can protect me a rock that can
[1:38:55] keep me
[1:38:56] god let me stand upon that rock
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:09] i love this rock you see
[1:39:13] um
[1:39:14] and you know this is where i i i want to
[1:39:17] just kind of get back to the scripture
[1:39:19] that we're reading because
[1:39:22] we had a rock there in
[1:39:25] matthew as i took it from matthew 20 uh
[1:39:28] uh 26 but you know if we would just kind
[1:39:31] of pick up these these people were
[1:39:34] trying to make it as sure as they could
[1:39:38] right here they here they they're coming
[1:39:40] to the uh the religious leaders that
[1:39:41] they come into pilots like you know what
[1:39:43] we heard that deceiver say
[1:39:46] that he would rise again in three days
[1:39:48] now if they didn't believe in him
[1:39:51] why are they there trying to make the
[1:39:54] the the tomb sure
[1:39:57] if they didn't believe what he said they
[1:40:00] had already amen came up in their own
[1:40:02] minds as to what the disciples were
[1:40:04] gonna do
[1:40:06] they're gonna steal them then they're
[1:40:07] going to start telling everybody that he
[1:40:09] rose again
[1:40:10] oh hallelujah
[1:40:12] amen but let's pick it up amen uh just
[1:40:15] just um we're going to pick this up over
[1:40:17] here in matthew 28.
[1:40:19] oh my give me verse 1. i just want to
[1:40:21] tell you uh the story
[1:40:24] oh i thank god i got we got a
[1:40:26] supernatural rock
[1:40:28] a rock that was willing to die for us
[1:40:32] look at this in matthew 28 says in the
[1:40:34] end of the sabbath as it began to dawn
[1:40:37] toward the first day of the week came
[1:40:38] mary magdalene and the other mary to see
[1:40:41] the sepulcher
[1:40:42] amen and behold there was a great
[1:40:45] earthquake
[1:40:46] for the angel of the lord descended from
[1:40:49] heaven
[1:40:50] and came and rolled back the stone from
[1:40:52] the door and sat upon it i like the way
[1:40:55] this reeds
[1:40:57] you see our rock
[1:40:59] was hidden behind a rock
[1:41:05] and they were trying to make it sure
[1:41:08] they had they had soldiers all
[1:41:10] positioned around it first they sealed
[1:41:13] the rock
[1:41:14] and then they put they put soldiers all
[1:41:16] around the rock to to make sure that the
[1:41:18] disciples couldn't get to it
[1:41:21] oh hallelujah but but but here's the
[1:41:23] thing amen they could not stop the
[1:41:26] prophecy from coming to pass
[1:41:28] with all of their natural efforts amen
[1:41:32] when god was ready to raise jesus he
[1:41:35] sent down an angel
[1:41:39] hey when god is ready to raise you he
[1:41:41] will send you an angel
[1:41:45] when god is ready to elevate you he will
[1:41:48] send something supernatural
[1:41:52] you will find out that their rock is not
[1:41:55] like you're
[1:41:58] wrong there rock was doing one with the
[1:42:01] seal on it
[1:42:03] but our rock was behind their rock
[1:42:07] but when the angel came down and moved
[1:42:10] their rock they found
[1:42:12] out their rock was not like our rock
[1:42:19] our rock was willing to die
[1:42:21] our rock was willing to rise again our
[1:42:24] rock
[1:42:28] oh jesus
[1:42:30] thank god for a rock like this
[1:42:34] our rock is our healer our rock is our
[1:42:36] deliverer
[1:42:38] our rock is our waymaker
[1:42:40] hey it's our rock
[1:42:43] oh hallelujah
[1:42:45] hallelujah he said i believe he said
[1:42:49] it is done
[1:42:54] so we we see this in scripture you know
[1:42:57] i won't uh i won't i won't i'll just get
[1:43:00] to
[1:43:01] just want to get you to uh verse 11
[1:43:03] amen in this
[1:43:06] the angel rolled it away
[1:43:08] and and now these these these
[1:43:11] soldiers that were supposed to guard it
[1:43:14] they they
[1:43:16] and from my understanding they had
[1:43:17] hundreds of them
[1:43:19] hundreds of them and they're they're
[1:43:20] working 24-hour shifts
[1:43:23] they make they made it sure
[1:43:26] that the disciples did not get in here
[1:43:28] and and take the body out and then start
[1:43:30] telling this lie that he rose again
[1:43:33] they tried to make it sure
[1:43:38] some of your parents have uh young young
[1:43:40] young children that might be wayward
[1:43:44] and they're trying their best to amen to
[1:43:46] make sure that they'll never come back
[1:43:48] into the church
[1:43:50] they get involved in this and they get
[1:43:51] involved in that and they try to make it
[1:43:53] sure
[1:43:56] but i'm here to tell you you don't have
[1:43:57] to worry about that parent you ain't got
[1:43:59] to fight with them you got to wrestle
[1:44:01] with them all you have to do is remind
[1:44:03] them of what god said in his words
[1:44:06] and what god told me
[1:44:09] is that if i was baptized in the name of
[1:44:11] the lord jesus christ for the remission
[1:44:13] of my sins he said i would receive the
[1:44:15] holy goats and then he said the promise
[1:44:17] is unto me
[1:44:19] and to my children
[1:44:21] those that are far off as men as the
[1:44:24] lord our god shall call and that's why i
[1:44:26] say don't wrestle with them don't fight
[1:44:28] with them just remind them say are you
[1:44:29] my child
[1:44:31] then it's not even up to you it's up to
[1:44:34] what i believe in the word of god
[1:44:37] hey i'm standing on a rock
[1:44:41] and i will not be moved by this
[1:44:50] verse 11 these soldiers have their own
[1:44:52] testimony of what happened
[1:44:54] it says now when they were going behold
[1:44:57] some of the watch see this is the
[1:44:59] soldiers leaving some of the watch came
[1:45:02] into the city and showed them to the
[1:45:04] chief priests all the things that
[1:45:07] were done
[1:45:08] here they're going to the priests and
[1:45:10] telling them what happened he rose again
[1:45:14] the soldiers are telling look there was
[1:45:16] an angel came down all of us was out
[1:45:19] nobody was able to do nothing with this
[1:45:24] i don't know who y'all fighting but
[1:45:25] y'all need to stop fighting this
[1:45:33] i believe the soldiers begin to testify
[1:45:35] hey this thing is real
[1:45:38] you better leave it alone
[1:45:44] he says he is rich and i'm here to tell
[1:45:46] you that
[1:45:49] verse 12 says that when they were
[1:45:50] assembled with the elders
[1:45:52] and had taken counsel
[1:45:55] they gave large money unto the soldiers
[1:45:58] emptied out their bank accounts
[1:46:04] you can understand this right now if i'm
[1:46:07] a soldier
[1:46:08] i'm not a jew
[1:46:09] i don't even have any this is not even
[1:46:11] to me i don't even know what this is all
[1:46:12] about
[1:46:13] says but if you're going to pay me to
[1:46:15] lie
[1:46:16] i'll do that i'll take the money but
[1:46:18] i'ma still tell people what happened
[1:46:22] you know why look you can't money cannot
[1:46:25] change what really happened
[1:46:30] it is no amount of money that can change
[1:46:32] that i was there when the stone was
[1:46:35] rolled away
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:36] [Applause]
[1:46:37] i saw the glory of god coming down you
[1:46:40] can't take that out of me
[1:46:43] now if you don't want me to share that
[1:46:44] in your churches i won't come to your
[1:46:45] church but i am coming to i'm going to
[1:46:48] my house and i'm going to tell them what
[1:46:49] happened to me
[1:46:50] i'm going into my country and i'ma tell
[1:46:52] them
[1:46:54] and i'm gonna use your money to go
[1:46:56] spread it
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:08] oh jesus
[1:47:11] hey don't fight the rock
[1:47:14] all right all right
[1:47:17] say in verse 13 saying say say he
[1:47:20] say ye his disciples came by night and
[1:47:23] stole him away while we slept now you
[1:47:25] know you got to understand
[1:47:27] one of the brothers was sharing me in my
[1:47:29] church he says uh he had heard that the
[1:47:33] the those roman soldiers
[1:47:35] um if they ever got caught sleeping on a
[1:47:38] shift
[1:47:40] that was a death sentence
[1:47:44] so you got all these roman soldiers
[1:47:45] ain't no they did not not now the jews
[1:47:47] want them to lie
[1:47:49] and tell them that the disciples stole
[1:47:51] my white no y'all made it sure as y'all
[1:47:53] could all of us out there everybody
[1:47:54] didn't fall asleep
[1:47:58] maybe one or two but not not it's
[1:48:00] hundreds of us not everybody felt if you
[1:48:03] all want to believe that and you want to
[1:48:04] pay us to tell that
[1:48:07] we'll take the money and we'll still
[1:48:09] tell them the truth
[1:48:17] and if this comes to the governor's ears
[1:48:19] we will persuade him
[1:48:21] and secure you
[1:48:22] now i'm going to tell you something if i
[1:48:23] was one of the soldiers look you
[1:48:24] couldn't even secure this
[1:48:29] how are you going to secure me
[1:48:33] you fighting the wrong battle
[1:48:36] rather than fight the rock yield to the
[1:48:39] rock
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:41] surrender to the rock
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:53] so they took the money and did as they
[1:48:54] were taught and this saying is commonly
[1:48:56] reported among the jews until this day
[1:49:00] i can see him spreading two stories now
[1:49:02] this is what they told me to say i had
[1:49:04] to get money for this but now i'm gonna
[1:49:05] tell you what really happened
[1:49:13] this rock
[1:49:15] in scripture
[1:49:17] um
[1:49:19] we want to pick it up over here in
[1:49:20] exodus
[1:49:22] in a second
[1:49:23] this rock means a vast
[1:49:26] mass of stone
[1:49:30] and they say as the famous rock of
[1:49:32] horror and we find that in exodus
[1:49:34] uh 17 6 amen this this um this this rock
[1:49:39] amen is a vast mass of stone
[1:49:43] and i want to uh also just mention that
[1:49:46] when we when we say
[1:49:47] god is my rock we're saying god is the
[1:49:50] author and the source of all my
[1:49:52] blessings
[1:49:57] oh i love that
[1:49:59] god is the often the source of all my
[1:50:02] blessings
[1:50:03] this is why david can write things like
[1:50:05] the lord is my shepherd
[1:50:08] god is my help he's the source and of
[1:50:11] all my blessings he's my deliverer
[1:50:14] he's my provider
[1:50:16] he's my protector
[1:50:18] amen he's my king
[1:50:20] he's my savior
[1:50:23] he's my hope
[1:50:25] he's my redeemer
[1:50:26] he's my way out of no way
[1:50:29] he's my burden bearer
[1:50:31] he's my heavy load sharer
[1:50:34] he's my keeper
[1:50:36] he's my healer he's my strength
[1:50:39] he's my source
[1:50:42] he's my peace
[1:50:43] he's my all in all
[1:50:49] see
[1:50:50] when we pick up over here that this vast
[1:50:52] mass stone as the famous rock of horror
[1:50:54] let's pick it up
[1:50:55] in uh exodus 17. i'm gonna start reading
[1:50:57] at verse three so we get the the gist of
[1:51:00] this
[1:51:00] the people thirsted
[1:51:03] there for water and the people murmured
[1:51:05] this is the children of israel going
[1:51:06] through
[1:51:08] uh the wilderness let's catch this now
[1:51:11] they're going through the wilderness and
[1:51:12] the people murmured against moses and
[1:51:14] said wherefore
[1:51:16] is this that thou has brought us up out
[1:51:17] of egypt to kill us and our children and
[1:51:19] cattle with thirst
[1:51:22] and moses cried unto the lord
[1:51:25] saying what shall i do unto this people
[1:51:28] they'd be almost ready to stone me all
[1:51:31] right
[1:51:34] my and it says in the lord said unto
[1:51:35] moses go on before the people
[1:51:38] and take with thee of the elders of
[1:51:40] israel and there are where thou smote is
[1:51:42] the river take in thy hand and go
[1:51:46] behold i will stand before thee
[1:51:50] there upon the rock in horeb
[1:51:53] and thou shalt smite the rock
[1:51:57] and there shall come water out of it
[1:52:00] that the people may drink
[1:52:03] and moses did so on the side of the
[1:52:04] elders of israel here's another one
[1:52:06] that's very strange how many of you all
[1:52:08] would leave here today
[1:52:10] and take a stick
[1:52:12] and go outside and hit a rock and expect
[1:52:15] water to come out
[1:52:22] most of us would not do that
[1:52:24] and this was a great challenge to moses
[1:52:27] but moses was obedient god put them in a
[1:52:31] situation
[1:52:33] where they could recognize something
[1:52:34] they'd never seen before
[1:52:39] and god says take your the same rod that
[1:52:41] you've been using and and down in egypt
[1:52:43] you got that right now take it and i'm
[1:52:45] going to stand on the rock
[1:52:48] now if he was not standing on the rock
[1:52:51] the rock would have never did what it
[1:52:53] was supposed to do
[1:52:55] but there was something supernatural
[1:52:56] happen
[1:52:58] with god standing on top of the rock
[1:53:00] once moses obeyed and just struck the
[1:53:03] rock water came gushing out
[1:53:17] verse seven says he called the name of
[1:53:18] the place my samara because of the
[1:53:20] childing of the children of israel
[1:53:22] because they tempted the lord saying is
[1:53:23] the lord among us or not some of us do
[1:53:26] the exact same thing
[1:53:28] we go from one trial to the next is the
[1:53:29] lord with me or not he proved himself in
[1:53:32] the last trial
[1:53:35] there's no need to question that
[1:53:38] maybe it's an opportunity for you to
[1:53:39] start exercising amen who you are in
[1:53:42] christ
[1:53:45] because later on this week we realized
[1:53:47] that uh moses got to a situation where
[1:53:49] that same rock god said you know speak
[1:53:51] to the rock this time
[1:53:53] but he went and tried to strike the
[1:53:54] rocky structure twice and got in trouble
[1:53:56] with god miss going into the promised
[1:53:58] land
[1:54:00] so so maybe god is trying to elevate you
[1:54:01] to get you to speak to your rod
[1:54:06] here's the a good thing about this moses
[1:54:09] struck the rock
[1:54:11] and when he struck the rock
[1:54:14] water came gushing out
[1:54:16] now watch what brother branham says here
[1:54:18] in the message ever-present water from
[1:54:19] the rock
[1:54:21] he says
[1:54:22] now we find out
[1:54:25] this calvary that they had
[1:54:27] and the waters of life gushed forth for
[1:54:29] the people
[1:54:31] now some people has upon their hearts
[1:54:33] and mind that all israel drank
[1:54:37] and that they packed up the camels
[1:54:40] and tied their hitches on their horses
[1:54:42] and so forth and took their kids and
[1:54:45] journeyed on into somewhere else and
[1:54:47] left the rock there sprinkling
[1:54:51] catch this now he says maybe people
[1:54:53] think that when moses struck the rock
[1:54:55] water came out all the people came
[1:54:57] gather around the the the rock got the
[1:54:59] water got the animals they got water and
[1:55:01] everybody just left the rock they're
[1:55:03] sprinkling they went on the journey
[1:55:05] brother adam said no that's not what
[1:55:06] happened
[1:55:07] they may say that is wrong he says the
[1:55:10] rock
[1:55:11] followed them
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:22] the rock followed them and
[1:55:25] the water followed them
[1:55:30] now this has got to be a supernatural
[1:55:32] rock
[1:55:33] have you ever seen a rock following
[1:55:35] somebody
[1:55:38] this is not your normal rock
[1:55:42] but maybe this is the rock beneath the
[1:55:44] rock
[1:55:45] hallelujah
[1:55:48] that rock followed them
[1:55:50] and that that that water followed them
[1:55:54] it says now in corinthians the 10th
[1:55:56] chapter i believe in the 11th verse you
[1:55:58] can find it that the rock followed
[1:55:59] israel wherever they went from that day
[1:56:01] henceforth the rock went with them and
[1:56:02] the waters followed them now you know i
[1:56:04] was um
[1:56:06] uh
[1:56:07] let me see here let me just make sure
[1:56:13] yes let's keep reading he says what a
[1:56:15] beautiful type a beautiful hold and an
[1:56:17] anchor for the believer today that knows
[1:56:19] that the rock was once smitten that
[1:56:21] water that once poured forth from
[1:56:23] calvary goes with us wherever we are
[1:56:26] amen oh my it's not go go back to a
[1:56:29] certain place and say well
[1:56:31] we did have water day before yesterday
[1:56:34] over there we got water today right here
[1:56:37] because that rock was christ
[1:56:40] and christ is the same yesterday today
[1:56:44] and forever see that rock followed
[1:56:46] israel
[1:56:47] they never followed the rock
[1:56:50] but the rock followed them
[1:56:59] i want you to just just just just bear
[1:57:01] with me
[1:57:02] even in some desperate situations
[1:57:06] you're gonna find that the rocks still
[1:57:08] follow them
[1:57:11] and even we get into some desperate
[1:57:14] times ourselves we will realize the rock
[1:57:16] is always there
[1:57:21] it says israel went on a journey but
[1:57:24] they had one thing to do that's keep the
[1:57:26] straight course right straight on the
[1:57:27] promised land the rock and the water
[1:57:29] followed them the rock following them
[1:57:30] first corinthians tells you so the temp
[1:57:32] chapter all right the rock was christ
[1:57:34] then when brother branham said go find
[1:57:36] it i said wow you say the rock followed
[1:57:38] them i said i need to find this one he
[1:57:40] said go to first corinthians 10.
[1:57:42] i did he said go find it
[1:57:44] i did it's right there let's look at it
[1:57:47] in the scripture
[1:57:49] i thank god for prophetic insight
[1:57:53] and there's many times i read this
[1:57:54] scripture and just never saw it no i
[1:57:56] just read it and just never thought
[1:57:58] anything about it until the prophet just
[1:58:00] kind of takes a magnifying glass
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:04] and it says the rock followed them
[1:58:06] and and here's another thing i want i
[1:58:08] want to get to you before i read it i'm
[1:58:10] glad
[1:58:12] that when brother branham went beyond
[1:58:13] the curtain of time
[1:58:15] and uh and angel was showing them all
[1:58:17] around say look at all these people you
[1:58:18] know he say all these brands say no no
[1:58:20] no these are your converse he's like wow
[1:58:22] he says he says i want to see jesus he
[1:58:24] says no you can't see him right now
[1:58:26] he'll come to you and he'll judge you
[1:58:27] for the things that you preach to the
[1:58:28] people you know and he said he says well
[1:58:30] is uh uh is paul here he said yeah paul
[1:58:33] is here is his people here yeah they're
[1:58:35] here he says well i preached the same
[1:58:38] thing paul preached
[1:58:40] and said millions screamed out we're
[1:58:42] resting on that
[1:58:45] and when i found this particular quote i
[1:58:47] say he did preach the exact same thing
[1:58:49] paul preached because paul wrote
[1:58:51] corinthians brother branham didn't just
[1:58:53] come up with this on himself he said
[1:58:55] what paul said
[1:58:57] the rock followed them
[1:59:00] if the rock was moving back then it's
[1:59:02] still moving today
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:07] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:59:09] and forever
[1:59:16] first corinthians 10 verse one let's
[1:59:18] read it read it we'll read it fast
[1:59:20] moreover brethren i would not that ye
[1:59:24] should be ignorant
[1:59:26] how that all our fathers were under the
[1:59:28] cloud and all passed through the sea
[1:59:31] and were all baptized unto moses in the
[1:59:33] cloud and in the sea
[1:59:35] and did all eat the same spiritual meat
[1:59:38] and did all drink the same spiritual
[1:59:40] drink
[1:59:40] for they drank up that spiritual rock
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:49] the spiritual rock that followed him
[1:59:51] we're not talking about a natural rock
[1:59:54] we're talking about a spiritual rock
[2:00:01] that they drank of that spiritual rock
[2:00:03] that followed them and that rock was
[2:00:06] christ
[2:00:09] brother branham preached the same thing
[2:00:12] that paul preached
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:28] we got a rock here church
[2:00:31] we got ourselves a rock
[2:00:35] and the good thing this rock never
[2:00:36] leaves you
[2:00:38] never for you
[2:00:40] sometimes you walk off without the rock
[2:00:43] but even when you leave the rock
[2:00:46] the rock is right behind you
[2:00:50] sometimes all you have to do is just
[2:00:51] turn and speak to the rock
[2:00:54] he's always there
[2:00:56] [Music]
[2:01:04] i'm trying to i'm trying i'm trying to
[2:01:07] i'm trying to rush
[2:01:10] i gotta i gotta read something to you i
[2:01:12] just i just
[2:01:13] sold so many things here uh let me let
[2:01:16] me slide up all right
[2:01:18] y'all a good church this is a good
[2:01:20] church to preach at i tell you
[2:01:24] oh glory to god
[2:01:27] we realize the rock was christ let's
[2:01:28] turn to another scripture here in second
[2:01:30] kings chapter 3.
[2:01:37] actually um while you turn to that i'm
[2:01:39] just reading a couple quotes brother ram
[2:01:41] says this in the message corinthians
[2:01:42] book of correction
[2:01:44] it says how this rock land there god
[2:01:46] had a rock
[2:01:48] that had stored full of water
[2:01:51] just a little rock
[2:01:52] perhaps no bigger than that desk you can
[2:01:55] get the size of the rock now he's
[2:01:57] telling you the rock is about the size
[2:01:59] of a desk
[2:02:01] it says but when moses smoked this rock
[2:02:03] there was enough water come from it to
[2:02:05] water two million people
[2:02:07] and not only that but as many cattle and
[2:02:09] sheep and things as they had with them
[2:02:13] it says oh when i see some of these
[2:02:15] artists who paint pictures of a little
[2:02:17] drop falling out of a rock and a kid
[2:02:19] standing there a little bucket and
[2:02:20] saying he says oh it never come like
[2:02:23] that
[2:02:24] he says it come out by bountiful gushers
[2:02:29] can i ask you a question this morning
[2:02:30] are you ready for the bountiful gushers
[2:02:33] of god's blessings
[2:02:35] so much you cannot even contain it
[2:02:38] oh it never come like that it come by
[2:02:40] bountiful gushes gushing out it watered
[2:02:42] over two million people besides their
[2:02:44] camels and
[2:02:45] and all their animals that rock was
[2:02:48] christ jesus
[2:02:50] a beautiful type a beautiful parallel to
[2:02:52] john 3 16 god so loved the world that he
[2:02:54] gave his only begotten son that
[2:02:55] whosoever believeth him should not
[2:02:57] perish but have eternal life now he goes
[2:02:59] on and says this and notice what
[2:03:01] happened the only way they could get the
[2:03:03] water
[2:03:04] out of the rock judgment rod had to
[2:03:05] strike the rock the only way to get
[2:03:08] water out of the rock is the judgment
[2:03:10] rod had to strike her on donald we can
[2:03:12] get water from
[2:03:13] our rock
[2:03:15] judgment had to strike at calvary
[2:03:19] and because the judgment rod struck now
[2:03:21] we can get all the blessings
[2:03:25] you know your healing was laying at
[2:03:28] calvary
[2:03:31] your salvation was laying at calvary
[2:03:35] your rock was at calvary
[2:03:42] that rock the judgment rod had
[2:03:44] distracted the rock and moses smoked the
[2:03:46] rock and god's judgment struck upon the
[2:03:47] rock and when it did it gave forth his
[2:03:49] waters the people were absolutely god
[2:03:51] was just and let them die because they
[2:03:53] had but disbelieved him they're
[2:03:55] dishonored dishonorable they were
[2:03:56] reprobates they they did not deserve to
[2:03:59] live
[2:04:00] moses called them rebels rebellious
[2:04:02] against god and they deserve to die and
[2:04:04] all of us deserve death because we're
[2:04:05] rebellious against god correct notice we
[2:04:08] all deserve dying but god is
[2:04:11] so merciful he should have he should
[2:04:13] never thought of us but he was so
[2:04:15] merciful till he took the sins of every
[2:04:18] one of us and struck it upon his own
[2:04:20] beloved son christ that we might not
[2:04:22] perish but we would have eternal life
[2:04:27] we're going to see israel in a place
[2:04:30] where they were so disobedient and and
[2:04:32] their history just i i'll say like this
[2:04:35] their history reminds me a lot of us
[2:04:39] we do a lot of things in our life the
[2:04:41] same way they did in the scripture
[2:04:44] right and we find them in second second
[2:04:47] kings chapter three and i wanna i'm
[2:04:49] gonna start at verse 10 but before i get
[2:04:51] i'm just kind of
[2:04:52] trying to simplify this we wanted to set
[2:04:54] this up jehoram was the son of ahab and
[2:04:58] he was leading the kingdom of israel he
[2:05:00] was the king of the kingdom of israel
[2:05:03] he was upset that the moabites rebelled
[2:05:05] against israel and stopped sending their
[2:05:07] lambs and their rams and their wool
[2:05:10] things like that he got upset so he
[2:05:12] asked jehoshaphat to go with him and
[2:05:14] join him in a battle
[2:05:16] all right now what we find in scripture
[2:05:18] and i won't have time to read it we're
[2:05:20] going to start at verse 10 it says they
[2:05:21] went seven days journey
[2:05:24] without any water for the soldiers
[2:05:27] i need you to understand i think you can
[2:05:29] only go so many days without water and
[2:05:30] you might die i think it's like 14 or 15
[2:05:33] days or something like that you'll die
[2:05:35] so if they've already gone out seven
[2:05:37] days
[2:05:38] no water if they turn around and go back
[2:05:42] it's still another seven days before
[2:05:44] they would find water so they are they
[2:05:46] found themselves in a very desperate
[2:05:48] situation
[2:05:51] now this is the son of ahab who was the
[2:05:53] worst king in israel
[2:05:56] right amen uh he brought all types of
[2:05:58] idolatry in you know so so so here uh uh
[2:06:01] uh uh um with with this this this man
[2:06:04] being here he said i want to go get uh
[2:06:06] joshua join me in in battle and we're
[2:06:09] gonna go out here and and defeat more uh
[2:06:11] the more bites let's pick it up in verse
[2:06:13] 10.
[2:06:14] um should have turned there myself i'm
[2:06:17] sorry
[2:06:17] second kings chapter
[2:06:19] uh
[2:06:20] three
[2:06:22] and verse ten glory to god give me one
[2:06:24] second actually you've got it down the
[2:06:26] screen i'll follow you um
[2:06:30] all right
[2:06:31] it says and the king of israel said alas
[2:06:35] that the lord
[2:06:37] hath called
[2:06:38] these three kings together
[2:06:41] to deliver them
[2:06:43] into the hand of moab
[2:06:47] but jehoshaphat said
[2:06:51] is there not here a prophet of the lord
[2:06:54] that we may inquire of the lord by him
[2:06:58] see they left out without inquiring by
[2:07:00] the lord
[2:07:01] they just went out on their own right he
[2:07:03] says but is there a prophet of the lord
[2:07:05] that we may inquire of him he says and
[2:07:07] one of the king of israel's servants
[2:07:09] answered
[2:07:10] see not now joram is not saying who's
[2:07:13] there he knows who is there
[2:07:16] but one of the service answers said here
[2:07:18] is elisha the son of shafat which poured
[2:07:22] water on the hands of elijah now you
[2:07:25] know elisha represents us
[2:07:28] glory to god and verse verse 12
[2:07:30] jehoshaphat said the word of the lord
[2:07:36] is with him
[2:07:37] people know who to call when they need
[2:07:40] something
[2:07:44] the word of the lord is with him so the
[2:07:46] king of israel and jehoshaphat and the
[2:07:47] king of edom went down to him oh my my
[2:07:51] my let's keep reading and man he says in
[2:07:53] elijah said
[2:07:54] unto the king of israel
[2:07:56] what have i to do with thee
[2:08:00] now ain't that something you go on to
[2:08:02] try to get something from the prophet
[2:08:04] and you get a stern rebuke
[2:08:07] what have i to do with thee get thee to
[2:08:09] the prophets of thy father unto the
[2:08:10] prophets of thy mother and the king of
[2:08:12] heaven said unto them name for the lord
[2:08:14] hath called these three kings together
[2:08:16] to deliver them into the hand of moab
[2:08:18] now his words is not changing the mind
[2:08:20] of the prophet
[2:08:22] look at this elisha said
[2:08:25] as the lord
[2:08:27] of hosts liveth
[2:08:29] before whom i stand
[2:08:31] surely were it not
[2:08:33] that i regard the presence of
[2:08:35] jehoshaphat the king of judah it was
[2:08:38] jehoshaphat that said is there a prophet
[2:08:45] and god god knew jehoshaphat said that
[2:08:47] so elijah said if it wasn't for
[2:08:49] jehoshaphat
[2:08:53] see some people bless because you're
[2:08:54] present
[2:09:01] i would not look toward see the
[2:09:03] keep reading keep reading keep reading
[2:09:05] and like he says but now bring me a
[2:09:08] minstrel
[2:09:10] and it came to pass when the minstrel
[2:09:11] played that the hand of the lord came
[2:09:13] upon him
[2:09:14] keep going he says and he said thus
[2:09:16] saith the lord make this valley full of
[2:09:21] for thus saith the lord you shall not
[2:09:23] see when neither shall ye see rain
[2:09:26] yet that valley shall be filled with
[2:09:28] water
[2:09:29] that you may drink both ye and your
[2:09:31] cattle and your beasts
[2:09:33] verse 18 and we'll stop here and this is
[2:09:35] but a light thing in the sight of the
[2:09:37] lord he will deliver the moabites also
[2:09:39] into your hand
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:45] i like to call that the and blessing
[2:09:48] the first blessings that there will be
[2:09:50] water in the valley
[2:09:52] the second blessing is that
[2:09:54] your enemies
[2:09:55] will testify your enemies will be
[2:09:57] defeated before you
[2:10:05] take me back to verse 17. keep that one
[2:10:07] on the screen while i read this quote to
[2:10:09] you
[2:10:12] the scripture says you will not see wind
[2:10:16] neither shall you see rain
[2:10:18] yet that valley shall be filled with
[2:10:20] water
[2:10:23] no wind
[2:10:25] no rain but yet there's going to be
[2:10:27] water
[2:10:30] rock beneath the rock
[2:10:33] looking at it through a prophetic lens
[2:10:36] let's see what a prophet says about this
[2:10:37] scripture
[2:10:40] in the message make the valley full of
[2:10:41] ditches he says you know someone told me
[2:10:43] not long ago
[2:10:45] said brother bran the music in the
[2:10:46] church is wrong
[2:10:49] i said it is
[2:10:51] i said do you think god changes in
[2:10:53] nature
[2:10:54] no he said i said then what when the
[2:10:57] prophet got all stood up
[2:10:59] and they said bring me a minstrel and
[2:11:01] when the minister began to play the
[2:11:03] handle lord came upon the prophet and
[2:11:05] the music brought the power of god then
[2:11:10] it'll bring the power of god now
[2:11:13] that's just exactly god steal the same
[2:11:16] god
[2:11:17] seeing the prophet you might not be a
[2:11:18] prophet but you can just be a minstrel
[2:11:21] or you can be part of it anyhow to bring
[2:11:23] the power of god
[2:11:25] your prayers can bring the power of god
[2:11:28] your fasting can bring the power of god
[2:11:30] your music can bring the power of god
[2:11:34] he says they started to pray
[2:11:37] amen and elijah got in the spirit and he
[2:11:40] saw a vision how he said uh and when he
[2:11:43] when he saw the vision he said go out
[2:11:45] yonder in that desert
[2:11:47] right where you're at
[2:11:49] and go to digging ditches
[2:11:51] and dig them out for thus saith the lord
[2:11:54] you'll not hear any wind
[2:11:56] any rain but there'll be water that'll
[2:11:59] come from the way of the wilderness why
[2:12:02] here's a prophetic lens why where'd that
[2:12:05] water come from
[2:12:07] he says from that rock
[2:12:10] that smitten rock that was in the
[2:12:12] wilderness
[2:12:13] that's right he says it was back there
[2:12:16] somewhere
[2:12:18] even in the desert situation the rock
[2:12:21] was still following him
[2:12:23] seven days without water but the rock
[2:12:25] was still following him seven is the
[2:12:28] number of completion the church has been
[2:12:30] wandering for seven church ages but we
[2:12:33] have found the rock
[2:12:35] praise god their rock is not like our
[2:12:39] rock
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:44] the water is still gushing from the rock
[2:12:52] revelation after revelation is pouring
[2:12:54] out we're getting water from the rock
[2:13:01] no wind
[2:13:03] no rain
[2:13:05] where did they get the water from
[2:13:07] from the same rock that was following
[2:13:09] them
[2:13:12] it took them seven church ages to figure
[2:13:14] out figured out that the rock was
[2:13:17] following them
[2:13:26] [Music]
[2:13:30] it was back there somewhere
[2:13:33] it says it might have been covered up
[2:13:36] but there was a smitten rock in there
[2:13:38] that moses smote
[2:13:40] coming through the wilderness and that's
[2:13:43] that smitten rock still lays yonder two
[2:13:45] to be touched tonight or today the
[2:13:48] waters of life
[2:13:55] here we see moses strike the rock
[2:13:58] the rock's giving out water
[2:14:00] and here we pick him up all the way over
[2:14:02] in second kings and mo and moses strikes
[2:14:04] in brother branham i mean when you read
[2:14:06] it there in exodus
[2:14:08] it never
[2:14:09] told us that the rock was following them
[2:14:12] paul picked that up
[2:14:15] and told us that the rock was following
[2:14:16] them
[2:14:19] and even brother branham saw it there in
[2:14:20] the scriptures said people think that
[2:14:22] they just got some water and drunk it
[2:14:24] and then said we had water yesterday and
[2:14:26] we had no no no no no no they didn't
[2:14:28] have to go back even to that same spot
[2:14:34] they had to keep moving on from there no
[2:14:36] and the rock was going to follow
[2:14:47] we saw the rock
[2:14:51] it was laid behind a stone
[2:14:54] but in three days that rock got up again
[2:14:57] because our rock was willing to die for
[2:14:59] us
[2:15:00] he got up from there and amen and he's
[2:15:03] still moving today
[2:15:10] there's a statement that brother branham
[2:15:11] makes and brothers if you all could just
[2:15:13] give me that picture i i usually have a
[2:15:15] little timer here on my phone so i don't
[2:15:17] preach too long
[2:15:19] and unfortunately
[2:15:21] my uh using the gps to come here
[2:15:24] i don't know why i didn't get any juice
[2:15:27] on my phone but it ran out it's
[2:15:30] the phone is done
[2:15:32] [Applause]
[2:15:39] but um
[2:15:40] this picture that i wanted to show you
[2:15:45] is brother branham
[2:15:47] and his son joseph there in arizona
[2:15:51] and they are on this rock and the rock
[2:15:53] is like
[2:15:54] the pillar fires there on the rock as
[2:15:56] well
[2:15:57] their hand raised
[2:15:59] raised up
[2:16:00] now let me preface this by saying this
[2:16:04] there are
[2:16:05] uh
[2:16:07] people
[2:16:08] that were with brother branham
[2:16:10] and there were things that were told to
[2:16:12] them
[2:16:13] that brother branham never actually put
[2:16:14] on tape
[2:16:17] now uh and some some people out i'll
[2:16:19] admit i think some have some far-fetched
[2:16:22] things uh you know i i get that so we
[2:16:24] can't go with everything
[2:16:26] but i want to say this let's not
[2:16:28] discredit everybody's testimony
[2:16:33] just because it wasn't
[2:16:35] on the tape all right
[2:16:38] let's let's not do that and i i i know
[2:16:40] there's a balance that we have to find
[2:16:41] here because some people might have a
[2:16:43] reason why they're telling you certain
[2:16:44] testimonies right but but but but don't
[2:16:47] discredit it
[2:16:49] because here's the way that i i'm able
[2:16:51] to kind of look at things
[2:16:52] uh there are some people just based on
[2:16:56] what i read in the message or listen to
[2:16:59] on the tape there are some some people
[2:17:00] can share testimonials like you know
[2:17:01] what i believe that because that's like
[2:17:04] the same nature what i hear on the tape
[2:17:07] that that's that that's that's the same
[2:17:08] i i might not be able to find the exact
[2:17:10] quote but that sounds right because of
[2:17:12] it it kind of flows it's got the same
[2:17:14] spirit
[2:17:16] right
[2:17:18] and that's how i'm able to balance it so
[2:17:19] i want to say this you know i preached
[2:17:21] this sermon you know at my church and
[2:17:22] after i preached it my song lady got up
[2:17:24] and he he made a statement it says um
[2:17:28] he was talking about this picture
[2:17:30] he said brother branham said
[2:17:33] that
[2:17:34] was the same rock that moses struck
[2:17:40] i said what
[2:17:45] so he said brother doug mchugh's i
[2:17:47] believe was a minister
[2:17:49] that was out there uh he he went to be
[2:17:51] prayed for by well not well they were
[2:17:53] out hunting brother brandon said he
[2:17:54] asked brother do you pray for people why
[2:17:56] are you out here
[2:17:58] i know you're out here trying to rest
[2:17:59] and relax but do you pray he says
[2:18:01] brother hold on god caught a vision
[2:18:04] prayed for him told him something about
[2:18:05] his mother and everything like that and
[2:18:07] and then he also told that brother says
[2:18:09] you know that that that picture that was
[2:18:10] the same rock that's what he told
[2:18:12] brother dover hughes
[2:18:13] now you can't find the quote where it
[2:18:15] says directly that
[2:18:18] but i will read you something
[2:18:20] out of the message to help bring a
[2:18:23] balance
[2:18:24] so you understand what the prophet said
[2:18:27] this is coming out of the message ever
[2:18:29] present water
[2:18:33] no i'm sorry i'm sorry the unveiling of
[2:18:35] god is coming from the unveiling god
[2:18:38] moses one time
[2:18:40] desired to see god
[2:18:42] god told him to stand on the rock
[2:18:46] and on the rock moses stood and he seen
[2:18:49] god pass by
[2:18:51] and his back looked like the back of a
[2:18:52] man god was in a whirlwind and and while
[2:18:56] moses
[2:18:57] while moses standing on the rock
[2:19:00] and look
[2:19:02] because sometimes we get into the
[2:19:04] semantics of this look if moses was
[2:19:07] standing on the rock
[2:19:10] and brother brahman says something about
[2:19:12] that rock that he's standing on
[2:19:14] and i told you that the rock moved that
[2:19:16] horror
[2:19:18] this must be the same rock
[2:19:20] yes sir
[2:19:22] brother branham says this i guess you
[2:19:24] all seen the picture out there the other
[2:19:26] day
[2:19:27] we
[2:19:28] stood
[2:19:30] by
[2:19:30] that
[2:19:32] same
[2:19:32] rock
[2:19:36] [Applause]
[2:19:41] and here is that light
[2:19:43] the angel of the lord right there where
[2:19:46] it clapped
[2:19:48] standing is right on the bulletin board
[2:19:50] there now again
[2:19:55] if the rock moved in moses day
[2:19:59] and the rock moved in jesus dead
[2:20:03] then the rock is still moving today
[2:20:06] and i know brother branham is not here
[2:20:08] but i believe we still have that same
[2:20:11] rock
[2:20:12] and their rock is not like our rock
[2:20:17] [Music]
[2:20:19] god richly bless you
[2:20:24] [Music]
[2:20:31] oh
[2:20:47] this message has been thoroughly
[2:20:49] vindicated church
[2:20:51] no doubt about it
[2:20:54] [Applause]
[2:21:00] we thank god for this rock that we have
[2:21:03] i tell you pick it up they might have
[2:21:06] they have they have public manner
[2:21:08] but not hidden manner
[2:21:10] hidden manner you have to look at it
[2:21:11] through the eyes of a prophet
[2:21:14] if a prophet would have told us
[2:21:52] i know
[2:22:02] i
[2:22:33] upon you
[2:23:02] father we thank you for your word
[2:23:08] thank you for speaking to us
[2:23:14] we know god that um
[2:23:16] these things still come
[2:23:18] because we want them it's because you
[2:23:20] annoyed us
[2:23:23] and god i believe that the timing was
[2:23:25] right i was finished with my sermon
[2:23:29] and you would rise up lord just to
[2:23:31] vindicate what was being spoken you knew
