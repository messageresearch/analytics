just so enjoyed the presence of the lord word of the lord sunday just so wonderful we are certainly just very very privileged to men people at this hour i thank god for every one of his just brother brian just just a tad bit just turn it down i usually don't ask you that just dad i'll let you know just so thankful for every gift god has placed within the body glad that brother jack was able to come by here and just continue to remember them in prayer i also because there'll be some other things i'm announcing mentioning sunday even in regards to the project things like that that's continuing on going a reminder of that special offering for that be coming up sunday but if you look at the calendar whether you've looked at it and it's posted there in the restrooms or have it on email i'm sure there'll be other reminders go out the last i think it's the last thursday of the month that we moved the service here thursday night i moved it from august 25th august 3rd and uh the reason i did that sometimes just just i wanted to be here to to be with you because that thursday lord willing i leave meetings mexico going from that time forward then we'll return back here that sunday brother ronnie long has seen that so lord willing will be here during that time i just wanted to try to be here that because then that following weekend meetings and these things were already scheduled meetings and things uh indiana so just ask you that you would just continue just keep those in prayers did you do that it's praying that god will just died and directed us lord has or directed this this with mexico here i've just brothers have been trying to been speaking to me since actually since back for a part of last year and so just we've just been praying about that just trying to look at times of just trust that would be okay just so we can be together be some in and out here but no one think would that be good ministry coming in here as well so i want to be sure of that too so let's just look to the word of the lord if we could now in joshua chapter 5 verse 13. joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 it says and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us were for our adversaries he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come this is the same pillar of fire that has led israel but now he's become a man he's come down now in a form now it's to lead them into god i i just love this scripture here after that announcement of who he is you know he doesn't have to explain to josh we don't have to go through and say we're going to hold two weeks of seminars and everything he just he just you see he announces who he is and joshua already knows him joshua's been feeding on the word the old porn of the land so now when he says i'm the captain of the lord's host notice the position joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant captain of the lord's host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot place whereon thou standest his home joshua may god bless the reading of his word as you're being seated just want to speak just a few words here tonight we'll just see how the lord will just take us here but i want to just speak on this thought of under his guidance under his guidance to the guidance of the lord jesus in joshua chapter 6 it has laid out there of them the record of when joshua comes back into the camp of israel after this meeting and he's received the guidance of the holy spirit on how that jericho is going to be taken and i want you just to just to think of this that when we look at that of the promised land and what i don't want to deal with so much tonight or just see how the lord will take it i don't want to deal with so much on types of things i want i just wanted to come right down what's been the burden of my heart for weeks months now is that this would just come right down to be everyday practical application and i want you just to see it in this manner brother brian just a little bit more turn it just a little bit more here i want you just to see it in this manner that when we have come into the promise of the holy ghost not only coming into the holy ghost down just a little bit but coming once you know even as we're coming to the every promise of god including that of the holy ghost there's option there's opposition against brother branham would talk about some of the opposition that you know he says you could take a person who's very nervous and he said here they go to praying about something and they get real nervous he said they'll back right away and say well it just not must not have been the will of god brother braham goes into it says what it is as that that person that nervousness he said then then satan what he'll do he'll move on that the conscience that outer spirit realm and then begin to just whisper well you know it says you know look look at your condition and look how this is but that's the very moment to persevere beyond that barrier that barrier that that comes up there and many times let's just let's just let's just cut to the chase many a times it's the barriers themselves and we allow them to be barriers and remain barriers and get built up as bigger barriers and instead of the time of taking the promise of god now please understand me when i'm talking about taking the promise of god not back away from it not look for an excuse around it but no matter what the situation is we can stand right there and say god has made the promise i'm a believer god's word is true and i'm going to stand on this promise i'm going to stand here if if i go by the way of the grave i'm going to stand on this promise because this is a promise that god has made and god cannot fail and so because we see there's always opposition that's always going to be in front of us when the holy spirit has come now we are in the land of promise it's a land of overcoming there's always going to be oppositions we're not immune as brother braham takes us he says we're not immune from sickness we're not immune from trouble we're not immune from oh you know every decision that i make well it's just gonna every decision is thus saith the lord we know better than that that's a desire of our heart is always to be in the perfect will of god but we also know that we can't just take that for granted it's something that we must seek after it's something that we desire in our lives so when we come into that of of the holy ghost when a life has come in to the holy spirit we recognize it's not a picnic it's not something that we're free from battles or free from wars as a matter of fact brother brandon would say it in another place you never had any battles until you did come into the holy ghost but now he says once you've come into that of the holy ghost there's a constant war going on now within that with that in mind we know that there are promises that you and i we come up before us and there's there's things that for you to possess and we all have if i can say it in this manner just maybe general promises that are are given to us and yet there are things that become very personal that even though they can be general but yet it's very personal such a sickness you know you might have some individuals that they deal with and they battle through sickness within their their body and in their lives and you find others they really don't battle with sickness maybe there's more things that they deal with in the spiritual realm however we go about it that we we are made to be overcomers in this hour let me just say it like this there's not one devil that is going to be able to raise his head at that time and say i wasn't put under foot but on the contrary through a mini-membered body every devil has already been conquered by the blood of jesus christ and we are standing as conquerors and we must never let that testimony do not ever let the enemy take that away from our vocabulary and substitute it with something it doesn't matter how long we've been praying about something god's word is still true now so you know when brother branham would say this and i've been referring to this quote here for a few services and he speaks of how that when a life once gets over in the canaan and they recognize where they belong how that their prayer begins to be turned around and he says you begin to express and say look here satan this is mine you know what we need we need some people with some attitude come on now we don't have a problem getting an attitude somebody comes out in front of us man come on now hurry up check the people out come on we don't have no problem i mean it just wants to rise up come on i'm not preaching to angels this morning this evening but we need to get a little bit of we need to get an attitude a spiritual attitude an attitude that is brought by the word of god instead of like brother bram said in the message ashamed he stands there and preaches that in 65 and he identity recognizes even in his own self to me i would never see this in brother branham but brother branham is recognizing it in his own self he said i i feel like he said it's almost got to the place he said that we're just we're asking the devil to leave instead of adjuring him to leave he said we don't have to ask him we have been anointed to cast him out [Applause] we've been made the head and not the tail sometimes it helps us to remember who we are that's why the word was being ministered even as brother jack was standing on sunday it's a reminder of who we are this is mine i'm a possessor of this god said so move out move off my grounds your ground satan says i've got an abstract deed to it now you know what an abstract is an abstract is everything that was against it has been cleared off when you believe you receive the deed but there might be liens against that deed right there can be bat taxes and water bills and everything else but you first must believe but then the blood of jesus christ the holy spirit comes as an abstract to the deed that gives you an assurance that everything that is on here belongs to me and there is nothing against me that's what the coming of the holy ghost is in this hour the abstract to the title deed no other age could say that are you hearing me we're talking about the end where the fullness of god has come down to clear off every lien that was against the church of the living god so here i've got an abstract deed to it move out you don't if you don't i'll serve notice on you by the holy spirit's guidance and he moves out because he has to now this is a big big big statement in this world we draw our subject our title from under his guidance because joshua has a certainty of promises that no man will be able to stand before you he has a certainty of promise that every place your foot treads upon i've given it to you but it's also balanced with this that we're not just going out like loose cannons and we're the ones determining how things are done because that's where we go on impressions instead of divine inspiration there's a big difference between that and and so when we're looking under the guidance every one of us we desire i believe with all my heart to be under the guidance of the holy spirit now when we look at this this this term let me just read a few things to you on the word guidance a guidance itself is advice or information aimed at resolving a problem or difficulty especially as someone as given by someone in authority i can't think of no greater authority than the holy ghost there's no greater authority than the word of god amen uh here just some words that would be uh uh uh of similar to this would be advice would be counsel would be direction would be instruction and would be leadership how many knows in the scripture it says in the multitude of counsel there is safety so we thank god for inspiration that even in the times that we might not know where to look in the scripture to address the situation or what it is that's in front of us we may not know but the holy spirit is able to assemble that that portion of witnesses that are in that cloud and is able to assemble that council and give you and i direction for what we have need of in our life because in in this moment when we look at this with joshua joshua had a certainty of every promise everything was certain now it didn't mean that everything was going to fall in his lap but notice when it came this to to jericho and this is i i this this lays as a real foundation for everything even within uh this whole journey and overcoming you see joshua had put the word first in the beginning how many remember that as bible readers and then some things we were ministering on that joshua put the word first and and as he's putting the word first he's letting the people know the word is going to make a way for you and you're going to come into the land by the word so you don't come into the land by the word and then set the word aside but now you live by the word as you're in christ and you're looking to him for everything that's in front of you in the landscape that's before you now look how brother random words this these things just struck me you know some time ago in the message blind bartimaeus in 1960 brother branham talks about joshua walking around and you know around jericho and he said it like this he said joshua was walking around and looking at the walls of jericho now i want you to think about this joshua then in our text that we read in joshua 5 this was not the same as what we read in joshua 2 where they're on this side of jordan and joshua sends out spies now on this side of jordan joshua sent out spies now let me ask you this why didn't he send out spies if he already knew the promise was certain it's the same way in our lives healing is certain but sometimes we got to send out spies to see what is the report what are the things that we're going to pray about come in it ain't that we're accepting a report over the samuel i'm not going to accept the report let me remind you in the message how can i overcome 1963 because sometimes we we we we can and i'm just going to say we understand what i'm saying sometimes we we still can get in something that where something comes before us and we don't want to deal with it so we just say it ain't there that's not faith that's called negligence come on we very you're not going to do away with jericho's you're not going to do with aoa with ai's you're not going to do away with all those things they are there and it's time to manifest that there's an overcoming power that's greater than your ability that's what these oppositions are about it's not that god doesn't like you it's not that god's trying to trip you up we understand trials are more precious than gold they are opportunities for the glory of god to be made manifest in our life is that right how can i overcome brother brown said you say oh i don't got cancer brother brown said oh no yes you do got cancer the doctor said you had cancer but now let's finish the quote but remember greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world you see you you've got something greater than a doctor's report so we're not going to ignore it and say well that that ain't that that's that you know that don't exist what we are going to say is if if that doesn't exist it's because of a god who is present to remove whatever is there and if it if it is made for me to go through that route then god will give me the strength to live an overcoming and victorious life in the midst of it i may have to ask him daily i may have to ask him moment after moment lord restore my joy lord refresh my joy lord strengthen me sometimes you gotta like i told him when i told our boys when looking at different things and how you know looking at careers and things like that that they're looking into i said look don't just go through college the whole time and think you're getting you're going to do this and you get out the end of the road i set with people at the end of the road all they had to do was do their student teaching and they realized when they got to the end i don't want to do this that's mommy and daddy's dying down the drain i don't want to do this and it's more than just the dying down the drain you've wasted four years come on friends our time is too precious time is too precious and i i believe that i know that as a witness that god will lead us and he guides us he cares about every detail the bible says acknowledge the lord in all things and he shall direct thy pathways i said go out and spy out the land you're interested in going in the medical route there's plenty of medical facilities around here go spy out the land you want to look at physical i'm interested in being a nurse go spy out the land you ask god to connect me with some nurses and ask can i go around oh brother samuel that ain't real spiritual but remember the reason we do on our jobs and the things we do god's already put that talent inside of us and the reason that we do what we do is so that the natural does not become an occupant over top of the spiritual that's why things are prioritized even right now so there's times to send out spies right don't nobody get mad at me but you know sometimes i'm just going to say it you know here i am as a pastor sometimes when i hear things if i step on your feet a little bit you know just say oh that's just brother samuel but you know there's some things i can look at and say what's in that degree what's in with this right here you know because sometimes you would get to the end of it what is the outcome you're intending to do right what's the outcome after it i'm not going to call some out because i could do that i'm going to tell my people i'm talking about degrees of things because when he get gets to the end of it all and and you know when we look at it i believe that we we should send spies out i believe there should be spies out if we're interested in a young lady interested in a young man i believe we need to send some spies out and see what's there help me preach now and this is scripture friends this isn't just going back and reading we're here in an overcoming faith there's a business deal laying ahead of you send out some spies send out some fillers of the holy spirit and find out what's laying there amen when joshua did all of that notice when he did all of that what came back to him was a refreshment in that the lord has given us the city i'm glad for that i i think we ought to send out spies and and look into those things that no matter what it is in the natural whether job whether you know whether it's that of a spouse whether whatever it is a home i believe we need to do those things because how can you know unless you don't send out some spies is that right i mean when i was going into teaching i got around i wanted every opportunity beyond just what they gave me because i wanted to know what this is like i stayed beyond different times oh my i stayed beyond different times i want to know what this is like now listen i seen bad kids i seen all that you know that that could have turned me around right there and said nope ain't going to do this i had nobody talking back to me i i could have i could have made my decision sometimes within that you can say oh brother samuel i need to be strong no remember everything with the will of god are you hearing me now god's will is always accompanied with the dove the dove will never lead you into anxiousness it's just not a pattern but the peace of god is always accompanied with the will of god so let me get back into this here you know his first objective was to take this city so he's looking around jericho and he sees all the doors are closed he sees all the walls now i want you to watch how brother branham words this he said joshua was wondering how that he'd be able to take that city because it was given to him and just what would be the way that god had planned to do it i want you to notice in this quote let me read that part to you again and then i'll go to another quote joshua was wondering how that he'd be able to take that city because it was given to him how am i going to do this not if i can how am i going to do it not if i can not if not if the holy ghost is for me it's for me not if healing's for me it's for me glory be to god he needed to know what would be the way that god had planned to do it in the message uh in the message thou son of david have mercy on me brother bram said one day joshua that great warrior was taking a little walk one afternoon and studying the strategy of how to take that walls of jericho how he was going to do it so if you were to have a coffee time with joshua you would not have heard from joshua well maybe god will god might got perhaps no joshua had already had a crossing of the river jordan there had already been a circumcision every promise in the book belongs to me i may not see the plan the strategy laid out but i know that every promise belongs to me you see god's letting you and i know don't sweat the stuff that ain't your business some stuff just ain't your business it ain't my business brother brandon says i think 1964 in the message look he talks about abraham and how abraham himself would direct his eyes away from his own natural body and away from looking at sarah and he speaks of how that abraham himself only focused on the word of god not on the things that he had no control over it wasn't his business to change his body he wanted his business to produce and bring life in his womb and bring a lie or bring life and sarah's woman life back in his but it was not his business to do that it was god's business i want you to think about talk about holding on to a promise of god abraham held on to it for 25 years how many how many times have we heard that preached how many messages that you can pick up a message and hear that speak they preach and i'm not just talking about jehovah jibril series or abraham and abraham's grace covenant i'm talking about throughout the message you you don't hear you can really go without hearing jehovah jireh mentioned in a message because that's the hour that you and i are living in that god is calling a people to absolute complete trust in him there's been other promises that other age they've taken but no age has taken the promise of the rapture because it wasn't their age but this is our promise this is our age this is our time hallelujah i think how the prophet could stand there in 1963 when he preaches christ the mystery of god reveal calling that his seven seal message and he stands right there and he lets us know he says we know referring back to the seals that who that he has come he said but as far as the coming of the lord we don't know the how or the wind but we know the who we know one fold of the threefold mystery we know who has come he has descended down is that right then he comes in the message rapture what's happening he's following on to know and he stands in the message rapture and the revelation has broke not only of the who the lord himself shall descend but the how and the wind unfolds why because this is our promise the mystery of the rapture are you hearing me now that applies to our everyday life in our lunch box many times we know the who it's got to take god but god lets it wane a little bit to for us to come to a place and that he'll make knowing the how and the a wind of times we want it instantaneously well you know i'm just wanting the lord to well there's nothing wrong with asking him but remember we know it's got to be him to do it but there's a how and there's a win is that right now what let's look at the example brother brown took can we brother adam did not stop there and say well you know i god hadn't revealed you know the how in the wind so i'm just gonna i'm not gonna preach no more he kept pressing are you hearing he kept pressing in the how in the wind that's the same thing within our lives when we are faced with promises that are that are before us joshua had the token of divine assurance in his life because you we must have the token which is the holy ghost is that right we must have that and because it is the token himself that is here that can even anoint your faith to receive the holy ghost so i want to examine here just a little bit here tonight on the reality that every promise of god is made available and belongs to us we sing the song every promise in the book is mine and it is it belongs to us but with an assurance as we seek his guidance in obtaining that promise now i want you to think we're living in that in that moment where even uh where where the lord jesus could say in john 5 19 when the religious and the pharisees at that time could not understand why that that man who was crippled uh there upon the sabbath day why he was raised they couldn't figure it out and jesus responds and says my father worketh and i worketh hitherto so there's one that here that's able to move and it's an expression of the father the will of god is being expressed through the life he could say the son can do nothing in himself but what he seeth the father doing that doeth the son likewise right you catch that even as brother random setting there in that interview you know in 20th century prophet over and over where brother brad remember how many times that brother branham even when it come to the statscliff baby or there were others that that would pull and they would you know brother branham why don't you come all you got to do brother branham is say thus saith the lord and and you look at how something like that was missed uh people meaning good but i believe we ought to have more understanding that you can't make thus saith the lord happen we can't make it happen like well i'm gonna i'm just gonna it's gonna be this way you can't make it that way that is sovereignly given by god are you hearing me now uh you know like i said i know sometimes there's things that we don't want to go through but just because we don't want to go through them don't mean well i don't want to go through that so i'm just going to take this route and i'm just going to say it like this and ignore that it don't work that way that's still selfishness say god help me god help me certain things we want to ignore and we want to go around and bypass but god knows just what we have need of because every opposition is a time for god to make his glory known in our lives and let's just be honest we've got greater oppositions in our lives than jericho ever was we've got oppositions of complexes and everything else that's still there after receiving the holy ghost and there are opposition there but here's the good news if you've been born of the spirit of god greater is he that he is in you than he that's in the world i can do all things through christ who strengtheneth me so we want to look at his guidance in obtaining the promise because you know god has a plan for everything the bible said all promises of god in him are yea and amen unto the glory of god by us so you know it always depends on what we're looking at is to be looking at the promise that god has given us it that's what it depends you know whatever you look at is what you're going to talk about now joshua went out and looked at walls but he was looking at them walls and said how's they going to how's this going to happen how we get in there because god has given us this city joshua didn't get on facebook and twitter and start posting about how big the wolves were and my goodness what a terrible opposition this is and whoa me and well my he didn't do that his strategy he went out there to look at the walls and he said i know that god has given us the city he didn't know the walls were going to come down at that time that way but he knew that god had given him the city he said i don't know how it's going to happen but i just know that god is going to do it [Applause] glory be to god what if joshua would have went up there and let's say that joshua winner went up you know he just said i'll tell you what the land is ours and he could have looked over and said brother ben you got a you got a chisel and a sledgehammer let's go start busting a hole in that wall and every time we celeste was slain you know we removed that sledgehammer we're going to say in jesus name every time we take that crowbar we're going to do it that way you know what that would have been he would have built a lot of frustration now joshua could have sat there and argued and said god has given us this land i know god gave me the city but it's under his guidance it's not us taking the word it's letting the word take a hold of us that's where real overcoming takes place it's not us manhandling the word and trying to take the word and i'm gonna solve this and i'm gonna solve this all it would have been at the wall in one little itty bitty spot was some flakes of concrete probably and some rocks laying right there and joshua would have been like many of us frustrated well i don't know this is the promise of god why is that frustration many times because we don't wait on the lord but you listen friends now we're living in an age everything is so instant so you see there's pressures you have to understand that it's not de-christianizing you and i it's to understand there are things that are around us that without anybody even saying it it just seems to kind of come around us and when we get into that mode then everything is instantaneous then man when i pray i ain't heard nothing so i wonder what's going on god doesn't always answer with the text message right away matter of fact when you send a text message sometimes you don't even see those three dots showing up sometimes when you send the text message a prayer come on now a prayer to god you send it and you look back at it it don't even say red are you hearing me now sometimes we wonder what that i wonder i wonder did he get my text message i wonder did he get it why it's this the conditions of the age that we're living in but oh thanks be to god that god's word still holds true god hasn't forgotten about you god hasn't forgotten about your need let me tell you something daniel he heard your prayer the first time you prayed the victory is certain but it's how it's how i don't know about you but i don't want to be taking sledgehammers and trying to take and chip things away that's ledgehammer those things will vibrate your arms after a while right or you're trying to pry things out man that just it'd be a lot easier just to wait on god and see how god's going to do it god might my god might at least loosen the doors god might we know what happens but i'm singing in our own lives we don't know maybe the walls will come down maybe the wall maybe the doors will open we don't know but we can just stand there and say lord i know that my son or daughter belongs to you i don't know how they're going to come i don't know how you're going to bring them lord but you said that they are in heritage of the lord that is given to me you said lord that i that i and my offspring will be there with you now you can sit there all you want and say well brother samuel that's only if they're elect everybody knows that but when i want to believe just like joshua that as for me and my house we will serve the lord we are not compromisers we're believers i don't care how black it looks i don't care how difficult he looks i don't care what the situation is there's nothing beyond god but the greatest thing we can do is put away our sledgehammers put away all of our chisels because god has not given us a promise for us to try to hammer into it so it depends on what you're looking at if you look at your affliction you'll never go any further if you look at the promise of god you've got a right to every redemptive blessing that god promised in his word it's yours brother braham talks about how a christian looks always at the unseen things i want you to think of that because you know that can be somewhat of a vague term looking at the unseen things he's not talking about these eyes right here we're looking at unseen things we're talking love joy and faith and long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness and patience those are unseen forces that works from the heart of a believer but let me just go into this a little bit we look at things that we do not see if we if we're the children of abraham then we don't walk by sight we walk by faith for abraham walked by faith and called those things which were not as though they were because god said so how many abraham's children then the things that we see around us we are able to look at those things and say this is not not ignoring it it ain't like any contradicting one i said before but it's looking at the situation i see it's there like when brother brandon brought that out and i can overcome about cancer i see it's there but i'm not going to look at my affliction are you hearing me oh sure the natural thing when any we get sick or something like that boy the first thing that comes around our way boy there's a little bit of pride gets knocked out of our out of our heels a little bit we realize man just what a helpless bunch of monk that we are and how we need the lord and you begin to realize like brother branham puts it in the message breach it feels good to feel good is that right it's just being honest you know but you see we walk by faith by calling those things that are as though they are not and calling those things that are not as though they are claiming the promises of almighty god i realize that that's almost become how satan in ladies mix has almost swept in and put those things to the side to where we're no longer standing up to move on promises of god instead we want to take and make excuses for different things and accept things but i believe as believers tonight we are not setting here to make excuses or to accept something well this is the way i'll be the rest of my life i don't believe that i believe that believers are able to stand with the promise of god and are able to discern between the three realms of their life and realize that spirit that human spirit that ain't me this flesh that ain't me but the real me is that soul on the inside that's been redeemed by the power of almighty god and greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world oh brother samuel that's awful steep well then it was awful steep the way brother branham took it brother branham sat there at the table and confessed his healing brother brown never said well you know it's a medical condition i'll always have this medical condition the way the rest of my life it had kind of been hard to preach divine healing wouldn't it you understand how satan will move in so subtly where things are become accepted it may be something that you could have dealt with whether it's medically whether it's something some strain through your family whatever that it might be some besetting sin or whatever more we do not have to be acceptive of these things we are born of a higher life but sometimes those things can just creep on in there instead of brother branham he continued to confess that promise and you know when he was healed when he stepped across the banister of time is that right on the wings of a snow white dove saw that seven squirrel that one how that it would be conquered but in the meantime what did you hear you heard that confession of victory i wonder how many people sat in the meetings that dealt with ulcerated conditions and situations in their stomach that when they would hear that testimony that there would be a spark of faith that would move down there on the inside i also wonder how many devils wanted to come to the platform and say you're still battling it but he could say i'm not looking at that i'm looking at a promise that's more sure than the symptoms i'm feeling joshua let me go into this quote here a little bit and i'll try to try to come down here joshua i want you to watch this wording joshua had no way to knowing that he could take the city are you hearing me now had no way of knowing he said caleb had no way of knowing anything either but here's how they believed it because god said so believing is greater than knowing you can know a lot of things but believing's greater than knowing right because to believe itself is inspiration that has come to your heart that goes beyond your reasoning your understanding it goes beyond all that so joshua didn't know he could take that city but he believed oh i like that don't you he didn't know he could do it but he believed because god had said i've given you the land every promise oh i'll tell you this is good this is right down where the rubber meets the road it's good things to take with us there are things that you and i can look at and we do not know but we can believe god if there's one thing we can do we can trust him is that right hey god god ain't fake news now god he said he is the truth the life and the way right god don't puff you up one way and knock it out from you enough no god god says is the truth and in this hour we're not just talking about the truth itself and looking at truth but the person of truth himself is here and he's revealed himself in this generation as the amen the soviet of god see joshua brother braham said it like this joshua had found out that he'd seen that great and living god there in the pillar of fire and all the miracles that he had performed he had confidence that god would keep his word now footsteps is possession now i know this is simple we've heard these statements perhaps many of us many times we've spoke of it but but you're making footsteps we're making footsteps it's not us standing in the same place there's got to be movement and as believers we sure ain't going backwards right we're not going backwards because even when the battle gets rough and it gets hard david said he's making my feet like heinz feet amen my feet have been planted and been established so there are footsteps our possession let's take every inch of ground that god has given us if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost this is what peter said the promise is unto you and to your children to them that's afar off as many as the lord our god shall call i'll tell you if you don't have the holy ghost don't listen to a liar and tries to tell you it's not for you listen to what the word of god is saying amen listen to him who is the truth notice footprints is possession let's go get it it's ours jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's possess it the works that i do shall you do also now let me just hear this last little statement let's possess it it's god's promise don't look at the circumstances don't look at how hard it is let's possess the land that's how we look at the unseen is the word of god comes to us and speaks to our heart and that promise that god has made and what's inspired to our heart that's what we're to take and we're to confess it as our own listen friends the reason many times we don't get any further is because we're waiting on something to happen before we ever confess anything come on now oh brother samuel you know i want the holy ghost bill so bad david said i've set the lord always before me i shall not be moved if i didn't get it this service i'm gonna get it i'm gonna i'm gonna receive it he is the pursuit of my life he's all that i desire i have set the lord i put aside everything else i got everything else out of the way i'm only setting the lord before me every promise let's possess it take a hold of every promise of almighty god don't look at the circumstances don't look at how hard it is let's possess the land so that's part of the of the possession remember the bible would say that even will either be justified or condemned by our words it also said that life and death is in the power of the tongue come on now sometimes the way that we talk is what causes the atmosphere the things we go to talking on and then we start then we start confessing those things we've been entertaining in that atmosphere and it ain't god that confesses negative because every promise in him is jay and amen amen well i must not be that good god never gave you that inspiration i must not be that good of a daddy i must not be that good of a mama i must not be that god never gave you that inspiration the bible said as a man taketh in his heart so easy you need to take the thoughts of almighty god i can do all things through christ that strengthens me i may not be the best or where i should be right now but i've got confidence that god who has brought me this far will direct me the rest of the way as a believer as a father as a mother as a husband as a wife my god will direct me i'm weak let the weak say i am strong let the redeemed of the lord say so glory be to god hallelujah first john 5 4. i want you just to think of this here i'm gonna come down here but don't tune me out right now just trying to find a stop and stopping place here joshua had no way to knowing he could take that city but here's what he did he believed it because god said so and you see what happened joshua he didn't pull back from jericho god had spoke to him and said be strong and of a good courage and he told him where to draw his strength and courage from is that right see many of the times all these that we're seeing where joshua was standing here as a maya is a brother brandon would preach it great warrior joshua but joshua was also feeding on the message that had come through moses because it was those words they were not the words of man they were the anointed words of god that was personal here was a promise that was there in genesis with a genesis 15 i will bring them out with a mighty hand one little phrase not even a complete sentence but in that phrase would be a message that would be sealed up in that and then that little phrase there would come a lamb stepping forward come on now there would come a blood to bring them out of egypt a token are you hearing me when god takes a hold of a promise that's god himself stepping down and taking his word on himself and now we see the lamb step forward now we see redemption out of egypt now we're seeing all the promises of god it's god unfolding it in his time and so what god spoke to joshua listen joshua you're going to face things that could make you afraid and listen god wouldn't have put it in the word when he said don't be afraid don't fear how many times he say that in joshua 1. it almost sounds like oops somebody made a too many copy and paste here no god let it be known there's going to be time and time again where fear can arise but i've given you something that will cast out fear when it wants to come around your life i've got an anointed message where your name is wrote in there and you're a part of that word and you can draw strength from the lord in this hour so joshua when he came here he is joshua is sitting there and they've come across the land and god's got everything just right after they've crossed jordan been circumcised they've kept the passover now here comes the old corn he won the coincidence it was right on time you know what the old coin was it was a product of beth death burial and resurrection the life that went in the ground now has come up and we are partakers of that life they were eating of the old corn of the land the promises that god made they are now partaking of that promise hallelujah and so when joshua goes out here standing around jericho he's been he's been feasting on the word now friends don't listen now this this comes down to everyday life sometimes the reason that we don't have is like brother brown would say angels showing up in visitations is because we failed to keep him on our minds over the same if i just didn't have this bad situation in front of me you know i'd be able to no no you're made to possess that situation you're made to master it i think how god led brother jack standing right here the other day when he was ministering sometimes he said when you don't even uh how do you say that about praying where it seems like you just can't find the words to even pray or you just you're so weary he says at that time remember he's talking about worship start singing a song put on some music are you hearing me put on some music put on the message oh brother salmon you just don't understand no i do understand i do understand i believe that god has given us just what we have need of in this generation is that right we are made partakers of it so to come into that place let me just let me close right there joshua stands right by that wall but he has been drawing from the lord so when he comes standing and looking at those walls he's looking at him i'm sure there's a lot of thoughts could enter through his mind because the devil's always right there to give opposition like man look at this they can run chariot races up there on those walls and you're getting into this city it's tight buddy i don't know how you're going to get in there but joshua in the greatest battle ever fought had to take those thoughts and bring him into obedience and you know the first way you bring them into obedience capture them and you know the first way you capture them stop them you say well i can't now you can buy your heads and say lord forgive me lord god for those thoughts those are my thoughts are going through my mind i don't want those thoughts in my mind lord your word is true come on now and you're able to take on those thoughts that are coming through there and say but lord your word is true is that right now i don't know how it's going to come about but i know that this city belongs to us in about that time joshua sees a man now this man wasn't away from the battle he was leading him into the battle and joshua ran to him drew his sword and he wasn't there like christian bookstore theology you know with flames shooting out his legs and no he was a man despised and rejected we didn't steam him not joshua drew his sword and said are you for us or against us because if you're against us i'm taking your head off right now no man shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life it didn't matter how big he looked it didn't matter what size he was joshua had a promise and he knew listen to me he was in line with the word of god and those words came out i'm the captain of the lord's host i am come down to lead you in this battle i am come down to lead you in victory and joshua as soon as he hears it he falls down and begins to worship don't look funny you and i do the same thing as soon as an answer comes thank you lord jesus sometimes the answer will come in words sometimes audibly some indifferent but sometimes the answer just comes it's just the peace of god it just it just drops down and how wonderful it is to have an answer from god but in the meantime as we're looking at the walls know that that city belongs to us this promise belongs to us and the god who made the promise is certain to bring it to past what must i do i confess the promise bring every thought in subjection to the obedience of christ cast down every imagination every thought that tells you you'll never get over that every thought that tells you you'll never get beyond it you bring that thought in subjection by the word of god you've been given a higher authority than any ink from a doctor is that right we've got a greater report i mean my bible doesn't have superscriptions written in it does yours that has like he's the lord that healeth all our diseases and there's a little superscript that says accept pandemics except does your say that if it did you better bury that version are you with me he's the lord that healeth all our diseases no matter if his physical realm spiritual realm so he's the lord that healeth all our diseases oh glory be to god aren't you glad for that amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord jesus how we thank you lord thank you lord for your mercy lord i realize that here tonight and even as we could speak lord every one of us lord maybe some here tonight some of us the lord every one of us no doubt have come through these moments and lord there's sometimes there's things that are setting before us lord it's not always sickness sickness lord is not always it's not what we have before us there are sickness that comes but there's so many things lord have in how the word gets down to such personal places in our lives but father in the midst of all of that lord i believe god tonight lord that i'm a believer and i believe i'm speaking to believers tonight lord lives lord and hearts lord they say i'm not going to accept anything less than complete victory i'll accept nothing less than that lord jesus no matter how long maybe they've been praying lord about something in their life and maybe it just seems like lord they've gotten weak and lord they've lord of weariness has set in it becomes lord to a manner of lord where they're not even maybe even looking in an expectation anymore in their life i pray god tonight may there be a renewing of expectation in their hearts lord god may it rise as a child of abraham lord and maybe all they can do is wiggle lord the the pinky tip lord of their finger maybe tonight lord that they would just begin in that manner lord they may not see the how they don't we don't need to see how lord we just need to know who is present that god that you've made the promise and you will fulfill your word lord you're not a man that you should lie not the son of man that you should repent help us lord help every one of us lord god lord for every different need lord that's throughout the building and those in the invisible audience tonight lord i pray that god may lord jesus it be lord the promise of god that lord whatever it would be personally to that heart or that life that they lord would be able just to take a hold of it lord begin to confess that promise as their very own confess lord your deliverance to their lives lord grant it lord i pray father for you are the high priest of our confession like joshua we don't know how we don't know but we believe because you said so help us lord i pray give strength lord to each need every life we pray now in jesus name amen amen i don't know about you but i just kind of like to trade in my sledgehammer over the samuel i traded it in long ago yeah but you know it's kind of like one of those things that sledgehammer still lays in a part of this life here and sometimes we'll just seem like we can get it out and we're going to make things happen and it and it doesn't happen in a certain way i'd say god i want to trade in the sledgehammer whatever the need is lord i'll robbery i want to let go of the sledgehammer and just look to you these walls are coming down now i don't know how we're going to get in this city belongs to us remember he didn't know the walls were going to come down he didn't know that but he could say this city belongs to us i wonder before they ever walked around the city when joshua was standing there that day i wonder that joshua was standing there and somebody could have looked and they could have said that old boy is talking to himself he wasn't talking to himself he was letting it be known this city belongs to me this city belongs to me healing belongs to me deliverance belongs to me how long are you going to confess it i'm going to confess it until the effects and the evidence are evident why because he said so and he's the high priest of my confession you want to make the lord jesus you want to draw him near you want you want to draw the lord jesus that he'll just move right down go to start confessing the promise of god and watch him draw nigh glory be to god listen you got a song go ahead hallelujah draw me close to you never let me go [Music] [Music] oh to hear you say that i'm your friend [Music] oh you are my desire yes lord no one else will do [Music] cause nothing else can take your place [Music] or to feel the warmth of your embrace [Music] lord help me find the way well to bring me back [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're all i need [Music] oh [Music] oh draw me close to you yes lord oh and never let me [Music] go down again [Music] just to hear you say that i'm your friend [Music] oh that's it right there you're my desire and no one else will do no one else no one else will feel that first that desire [Applause] [Music] glory be to god [Music] of your embrace [Music] [Applause] oh yes you're all alone let that be the confession tonight you're all i need lord [Music] [Music] [Music] all i want all i want [Music] oh yes you're all that i am is [Music] oh yes help me um [Music] hallelujah you know it comes to my mind as i was standing here i believe the lord brought it to my mind you know even over the years here of pastoring you know different times of talking with different ones maybe different ones of you some that are maybe not here present different situations sometimes and personal say but say i'm going to stop taking my medicine maybe there's certain medicines that they have to take and the one thing that anybody knows that's ever taught me about this what i've always said i come back to an example that i'm so glad that we have sister dao was prayed for come right across the prayer line she got home after you know prayer was made and she started things started coming right back started going downhill so brother brother brown called him up and said hey brother branham said uh you know mama she seems like she's going down here you know you hear brother and sister down brother branham says it right around the phone he catches it by vision he said did she she stopped taking her medicine you tell her to keep taking her medicine keep taking that medicine he said god will confirm all that i tell you i could go on and on with situations like this i thank god for the balance of this message [Applause] there was a big wall standing in front of jericho standing in front of him jericho whatever you want to call it standing in front of brother neville for the neville getting to a certain age in his body where certain things with with men and things like that and troubles can come up and brother adam just pulls him aside and brother brown tells him brother neville
