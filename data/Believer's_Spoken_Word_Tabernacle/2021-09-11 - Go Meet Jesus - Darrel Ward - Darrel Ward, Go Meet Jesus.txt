how great is our god amen there's no god like our god amen there is no other god amen he's the true and living god amen and we are witnesses of that amen witnesses of him amen we just want to welcome each and every one of you amen to the house of the lord this evening we're just expecting great things from the lord and we i want to read a prayer request here in just a moment and as i prepare to read that i'm glad that brother daryl ward was able to be here with us here on these this weekend and uh you know i've made it very clear to you here over the different different times of how that i we just so appreciate brother darrell's ministry i just appreciate the times that not only he's been here but also being able to work alongside him and just see how the lord has used brother daryl as he's yielded himself to the lord so many times and just to see just how god has used the gift and so we're just we're just with a great anticipation as our brother just yields himself to the lord tonight god knows what we have need of and let me just say what we just sang here in that part he's the name above every name it doesn't matter what new name they come out with he's above it it doesn't matter what situation arises he's above it i love what they said as it came forth in the book of acts in acts chapter 4 when they received the refilling of the holy ghost their approach to what was happening in the church was they said thou art the almighty god who created heavens and earth they they took the situation and it was great but they put him and they recognized you're above this situation and tonight that's what faith does faith recognizes that god is above it not our feelings not what we think about it not even what someone else has said about it it's what god has said and god doesn't the one thing about it god don't have to update his word he just raises the standard and the raising of the standard is he makes it real by himself coming and making that word real in our midst and in our lives that's the real standard that gets raised so as we read this request here i've asked if brother juan would come as we get ready to bring brother daryl out and i've asked brother juan to sing this song tonight just had it on my heart and that is you do miracles so great and so i asked his brother juan we'll go in prayer and then brother juan will sing that and we'll bring brother darrell out so glad to have brother juan and sister rachel here with us sister angie god bless you it's good to have you here as well amen if anybody else i'm missing please forgive me this is from brother drake and he asked he asked that we would please pray for his stepfather david he survived a heart attack on monday but has been given only several days to live due to significant brain damage and just in that note right there when brother drake's mother called him on monday well she found him and he was blue and brother drake mentioned to her and he said well this is not it let's just look to the lord and in the ambulance they were able to revive him because there was nothing at that time and so as he's just been there in the in the place in the hospital hero since monday and just there just witnessing and just expressing of what of who the lord is and god is mindful we just want to knowing now that where his stepfather is at that he survived that heart attack god brought him through that and but they've only given him now several days to live because of the significant brain damage and he said we're grateful for god's miracle of survival and we pray for his will and the healing power moving forward and so we know as believers you know there's a lot of things and you hear where brother branham would make these statements and we've not just seen where brother bran has made statements we've witnessed it ourselves brother dave you've witnessed it where sister shirley had moved on but god brought her right back that was just that was just what a year and a half ago right there it just as god just moved so there's no situation that's beyond the lord sometimes the situation as i said it can hit us and seems like it just knocks the air out of us and we think oh my goodness because we can go down and know oh this person had this oh there was only a week oh this person had this and this we're either going to look at that report or we'll look at the true report we have believed the true report now healing however that healing comes and and everything it that's in god's hands because there's never ever never ever a defeat in the economy of god sometimes healing doesn't come the way that we're expecting it to come but it comes and so we want to we want to pray according to the word of god and just ask that god will just move for this need and i'm sure that there's no doubt many other needs and there's needs that even that maybe we're not even aware of here tonight as a congregation but other needs that i'm aware of that thank god these people are no longer in a hospital they're back home and so we just thank god for his mercy so let's as we just go to the lord in prayer and just ask that god would just undertake on on the behalf of brother drake's stepfather could we do that amen heavenly father lord we take this need lord before your throne you lord you see and you know this very situation lord and knowing that god that the soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds lord father that's the very burden of our heart lord in this situation as well lord we pray heavenly father god for your mercy lord jesus lord is we just ask that lord knowing that there's no situation this is nothing to you lord and lord we just ask that you would just move down in a very special way oh god we pray father for healing oh god lord for this this this life o god we pray that lord that you would just move in a special way o god lord we committed lord he's in your hands lord jesus and we want to say thank you father for the other testimonies lord different ones lord that we have received and heard of lord it encourages our hearts and knowing that there's also many needs lord that's among us lord and we just ask that god you'll move lord according to every need lord as our faith reaches out to touch you lord god i pray that lord you'll just guide and take brother daryl tonight lord the gift that you placed in his life lord and just speak very personally lord to every heart and every need lord whether it's lord over the internet it's right here you are still god and lord we just invite you lord and we pray that father tonight you just move among us in a very special way o god we love you and we thank you father in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let's just join in with brother juan as he would lead us here in this song his brother daryl just goes ahead and makes his way on out amen go ahead brother [Music] [Applause] loves as i bless your holy name [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes you deserve [Music] me [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] you [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are [Music] do you believe that tonight it amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah what an awesome god that we serve amen he's worthy of all their praise he keeps all his promises he keeps all his appointments oh what an awesome god that we serve tonight in a time of such uncertainty in a time of such confusion and a time of disappointment and violence and lawlessness that's in the land i'm so glad tonight that we have an anchor in the word of god amen hallelujah that he hath opened our eyes for us by his grace he's opened our eyes and allowed us to see the hour that we're living in amen what a privileged people we are tonight he's our god he's our comfort he's our joy he's our peace he's our healer he's our friend he's our bridegroom he's our all in all amen with him we can do all things without him we can do nothing what a privilege it is to serve the living god well praise the lord certainly good to see you again amen amen we appreciate the opportunity to come up and be with you we just trust something to be said to help you and encourage you along the way we certainly appreciate brother samuel and joe administered with him down at the byc camp this year and just did a wonderful job there and we just counted a real honor to be with our brother in the ministry with him we trust something to be said to help you to encourage you along the way if you have your bibles turn with us stand if you will and turn with us to the book of john will read from john chapter 11 starting at verse 17. amen and you know no matter what your need would be tonight we serve a god that can certainly meet that need amen and we just trust that you could just look to him that when we leave the building may there not be a feeble one among us amen amen saint john chapter 11 starting at verse 17. then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about 15 followings off and many of the jews came to martha and married to comfort them concerning their brother then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went out and met him but mary set still in the house then said martha unto jesus lord if thou has been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of god god will give it thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us thou this amen let us bow our heads i want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on a just a little simple thought the lord gave us on go meet jesus heavenly father truly lord there is thanksgiving in our hearts this evening lord as we lifted our hearts and our hands to you and worshiped lord testifying that there is no god like you lord you do miracles so great and god what a privilege it is lord to serve the living god when man will take stone or metal or wood fascinating out of god and he'll bow before a god that he made with his hands and worship some dead image but oh god tonight i'm so grateful that i don't serve a god that i made with my hands but i serve a god who made me with his hands and lord i pray tonight god that thou who spoke to the wind and it obeyed your voice may you speak to every heart that's in this building this evening and lord no matter what the need would be lord no matter what the doctor's report would be or whatever situation they would find their self in it's not greater than you lord so we look to you the author and finisher of our faith and lord may it rise up tonight and receive that which you've already done for us lord bless brother samuel lord his ministry his family the local church here dear god may signs and wonders be wrought at the hands of the believers dear god that this community would know that thou art the same yesterday today and forever receive honor and glory unto thyself for we ask these things in jesus name and the bride says god bless you saints you may be seated i want to call your attention back to verse 20. where it said then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming she went out and met him but mary sat still in the house you see brother sister i believe that these two sisters that we read about in our scripture this afternoon i believe that they represent everyone that is in this building tonight for the way i see it we can do one or two things we can do like martha when she heard that jesus was come she got up and went to meet him or we can be like mary and set still in the house because you see you're going to do one or the other the prophet of god said when you come to the house of god you never leave the same way you'll either be better or worse off and any time the word of god is presented to us it causes us to declare or to make a statement whether believe it or whether we don't amen and so i say as these two sisters that we read about we're going to do one or the other in this building tonight for jesus said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in their midst you know many people come to church for many different reasons but i want you to know that when he comes when he comes he comes in the power of his resurrection he sends healing in the form of his word he comes to pour out the holy ghost he comes to fulfill every promise that he's made to the believer when he comes he comes to bring deliverance he comes to bring healing he comes to bring forgiveness he comes to bring joy unspeakable and full of glory when jesus comes the temptus power is broken and when he comes we can either get up and go meet him or we can sit still in the house but i say to you let's not sit still his here his word says he's here let's get up and step out and possess what belongs to us this is our day this is our hour this is for our time to shine in the slight of his word amen luther had their day wesley had their day pentecost had their day but this is our day now amen hallelujah the promises of god's word they are for the believer thank you lord to us and i say let the devil rob us so none of it amen hallelujah the promises of god's word for the believer they belong to us they are by our possession brother brennan said when christ died at calvary every redemptive blessing was placed into the hand of the believer like the sister in the communist country i i know you've heard the story they they wasn't allowed to have church and so the the baker there in this little village he was a believer also and he would bake a certain kind of bread and so the believers would go to the baker and ask for this bread and inside the bread was a message saying where the service would be held that night and so by the breaking of the bread came the revelation of where jesus would be hallelujah so she gets the message and on the way to church that night in a secret meeting she runs into a soldier and you know they had a curfew you couldn't be out a certain time and he said hey where you going she said my brother died and i'm going for the reading of the will and she goes to church and they sang songs of zion and somebody got happy and started shouting somebody got healed and somebody got saved and somebody got filled with the holy ghost and they had foot washing and they had communion and oh my just i like to be in church services like that and on the way home she was so happy she was singing joyous mind healing his mind the holy ghost is mine all mine and she ran into the same soldier and he said what did your brother leave you she said oh he left me everything oh hallelujah every redemptive blessing belongs to us amen i say let's get up and go meet jesus you see the answer to every problem is jesus he is the answer you say i'm sick well get up and go meet him i'm discouraged brother daryl get up and go meet him i'm having a hard time then get up and go meet him everything you have need of jesus christ is the answer amen you see how mary knew was that death had come to their house sorrow and fear had all come to their house but martha called a revelation that caused her to get up and go meet him you see death had struck the home of mary and martha and no doubt they thought how could this happen to us jesus is our friend he's slept in our spare room he's he's set at our table we're message believers we've left everything to follow him how could the sorrow come to us how could the doctor's report be so bad we're his people we should never have trials we should never have troubles every day should be blue skies and smooth sailing every day should just be a picnic i like a nice picnic those are real nice thoughts but you see the problem of it is jesus never promised that he never said we wouldn't cry he never said we wouldn't get sick he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he never said we wouldn't suffer he never promised smooth sailing he never said there wouldn't be storms but he did say i will never leave you nor will i forsake you then no matter what happens in our life we do not face it alone amen you see sometimes god allows things to come into our lives so that he can come to us and show us just how great he is you may have a great cancer you may have a great trial you may have a great problem i'm not i'm not i'm not doubting that i'm not belittling that but i'm just here to tell you tonight how god's greater [Applause] amen look i'm not taking light of our suffering we have real tears we have real pain anybody's ever had back trouble and that nerve pain going down your leg that's real pain somebody told me the other day said you know this coveted stuff i think it's fake i said buddy it is not faith stuff about killed me real pain real sickness real sorrow amen real tears it hurts to lose loved ones i know what it is to have pain when you stand in a pull up to a gas station and have to pray to get out of the car because the pain is so bad to get gas to get home real tears real pain real sorrow real fear but a real god amen who's bigger than all of it he's bigger than all of our problems he's bigger than all of our trucks my god is bigger amen than anything i will ever face in my life mary and martha in this great time of sorrow in this in this great time of need it was their darkest hour you see they were just left alone mary and martha their their mother was gone their father was gone and now you know the lazarus he was he was supposed to take care of him he was going to be the breadwinner he was going to be the security to take care of the sisters they was going to lean on him he he was going to provide the money for the rent and now he was gone the rug if you see as we say was jerked out from under them those two girls just left alone in the world and there they sat in sackcloth and black veils and weeping and mourning over the loss of their brother and no doubt the loss of their security crying some even over their own self for the situation they found themselves in it was their darkest hour but i'm so glad that we can read in the word and find out that in their darkest hour that's when he showed up the prophet said that's just the way he does it hey brother sister this may be your darkest hour this evening right now may be your darkest day that you've ever been in but i want you to know that jesus comes along just at the darkest hour it was the darkest hour of the woman with the blood as she would ever see 12 years of bleeding and the bleeding would not stop and how it got on her nerves and the prophet of god said she spent everything and the doctor said she would never be better it would never stop the bleeding on my what a time in her darkest hour then jesus came along it was the darkest hour jairus had ever saw his only daughter lay dead it was his darkest hour that's when jesus come along amen it was the darkest hour peter and the disposals of the disciples that ever saw out there on the sea that night when ten thousand demons swear they would drown them it was third darkest hour that jesus came walking on the water it was in that dark hour that martha got the word that jesus had come you see martha realized the answer to her sorrow the answer to her darkness the answer to her fear was jesus she realized that god had a way provided and jesus was the answer for everything she was going through he was the answer then he's the answer now and if there's a tomorrow he will be the answer tomorrow and when she got word that he had come she got up and she went and met him because she knew he was the answer she went to meet the answer to her problem it reminds me of blind bartimaeus sitting there on the rocks of the of the walls of jericho and he wore a beggar's robe that identified him as a blind beggar and sitting there in the sun trying to get a few pennies he got to thinking about his life you know sometimes we get so busy living we forgot we forget what it is that we're living for i think it's good sometimes for us to slow down and stop a minute and remember where we come from remember the great things that god has done for us [Music] amen and standing there in the sun he got to thinking about his life he thought you know i i remember i had some dubs that that they would do tricks and i would get money what happened to those doves i remember my little girl got sick and i went behind the house and i i lifted my eyes to jehovah i remember praying i said father my little girl's sick don't take her from me i need her i see the world through her eyes i smell the fragrance of the flower and she tells me what it looks like and i hear the singing of the bird and she tells me what the bird looks like and we said and she looks into the sky sees the different characters that's in the clouds i need her father i see the world through her eyes don't take her from me if you let her live i'll give you my doves and she got better and he kept his promise to god oh may god help us to keep every promise that we make to god and it wasn't long after that i said i remember my wife got sick perhaps it was a pandemic perhaps he got what his little girl had and he went out behind the building again he said father my wife is sick don't take her from me lord i need her she cooks for me she keeps my clothes clean she puts my cup right where i can find it every time at the same place she puts my fork right beside the plate the same place every time so i can find it she's so good to me lord i can't make it without her don't take her from me i trust you brothers feel that way about your wife as i feel that way about mine i said lord if you let her live i'll give you my lamb and she got well and he goes down to the temple to keep his promise to god and he runs into the priest and he says you know the story we're ghost now bartimaeus said i'm going down to the temple to sacrifice my lamb to jehovah said you can't do that you need that lamb to help you get around sit here take this money go buy you a lamb he said i never promised god a lamb i promised god this lamb and if i give god this lamb he will provide a lamb for my eyes and thinking on those ways as he was sitting there he thought what made me say that a provided lamb that god would provide a lamb oh i'm so grateful for inspiration that sometimes the spirit of god will move on you and you'll say things you don't even realize what you're saying but move by the spirit of god he said what made me say that a provided lamb that god will provide himself a lamb and sitting there thinking about these things his thoughts became manifested and he began to hear a noise and he said would someone please tell me what's going on and someone said it's jesus of nazareth the lamb of god he's come and when blind bartimaeus heard that the lamb the lamb he began to cry out jesus thou son of david have mercy on me someone said hey hold your peace well take none of that screaming and carrying on around here yeah you get happy you raised one finger for a man and two for hallelujah you need to calm down a little bit you're a little pentecostal but the bible said he cried the louder jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and the bible said jesus stood still what stopped jesus it wasn't his voice he was 150 yards from him and everybody screaming and shouting he would have never audibly heard his voice then what stopped jesus if it wasn't his voice i'll tell you what it was it was his faith and i say to you if his face stopped jesus your faith can stop him tonight [Applause] jesus stood still and they said he stopped and he's calling for you hallelujah now blind bartimaeus is left with this decision that every one of us is left with in this building this evening he was left with this decision either get up off the rock and go meet jesus right we're set still you see the master was calling it required for him to make a decision either get up and go meet him or sit still on the rock and the bible said in verse 50 that he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus he got up and went and met jesus casting away that old blind beggar's robe but notice when did he cast it away not after jesus prayed for him before he ever got to jesus he was already identified himself i don't need a blind beggar's robe i've got a lamb provided amen whoa he cast off the road before he ever got to jesus he was as blind as blind could be but he saw more than 99 of the people standing there he saw a lamb provided and i say to you my brother my sister can you rise up tonight and step towards the promised word for your day cast off fear cast off asthma cast off high blood pressure cast off back trouble i don't need an arthritis robe i don't need a back trouble i don't need a glaucoma robe i've got a lamb provided amen oh glory to god god's provided way for us the prophet said that was god's provided way was to go meet jesus that's right got sorrow in your home go meet jesus got sickness in your home go meet jesus got heart aches in your home go meet jesus hallelujah if you have got a need for any thing go meet jesus go meet him he's got all the remedy and everything and then he says this he ain't got the remedy he's got the cure you got need for anything get up and go meet jesus then if god provided a way for us to go meet jesus there has to be a way to do that if god anointed his prophet to speak this quote god's way provided for us september 1952 if god anointed his prophet to speak this quote to us then there has to be a way for us to do that or god would be unjust for he told us to do something that we couldn't do so then if he said for us to go meet jesus you've got a need for anything go meet jesus then there has to be a way for us to do that or god would be unjust in telling us to do it and not make a way provided for us to fulfill it so there has to be a way for us to do it in the day that we're living in are you still with me you see in order to meet him you've got to know where he's at i know that's simple but that's just hillbilly education right there if i told you meet me tomorrow i'll buy you the biggest steak in ohio what's the next thing you're going to say exactly right where at what time amen amen he said that's good he said a little while the world will see me no more but she shall see me how how will i see you lord all right you see if there's a biblical question there must be a biblical answer jesus said the world will see me no more but ye shall see me how lord how will i see you how can i in the day that i'm living in how can i see you he answers the question little while the world will see me no more but ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you you know god open our eyes this evening and let us see lord it's not so we someday some happy day i say not sunday i say today it's not something that's going to be it's something that's here now we want to see jesus we want to see jesus but you can only see him in the manifestation of his word that's promised in the hour that you're living in you see luther saw him in his day wesley saw him in their day but you've got to see him in your day if the door back air opened and somebody came up here dragging across and bleeding everywhere and a crown of thorns people would scream and faint and everything else but that would not be jesus because he's already done that people would get so excited oh there's jesus he's bleeding that wouldn't be him he's already fulfilled that so the only way you can see him is see him in the word that's promised for the hour that you're living in jesus said i'm the vine and you're the bridge the vine does not bear the fruit but the the the the branch bears the fruit it's the evidence of the life that's in the vine the prophet of god said it this way that the only lips god has is your lips the only eyes god has in your eyes the only hands he has is your hands i'm the vine and you're the breast and what kind of fruit would it bear if the life that was in him is in his church he'll bear the same kind of life that he bore when he was here making him the same yesterday today and forever he's here in the person of the holy spirit i'm the vine you're the branch the vine does not bear the fruit the vine cannot bear the fruit it's the branches that bears the fruit and it's energized from the life of the vine and your lips is his lips when you're energized and your hands is his hands when you're energized by the life of the vine i was in nicaragua just a few years ago it's about 600 in that meeting about halfway back on the end was a sister and was going to have a prayer line that night but it was just too many people we'd been there all night so i said we'll just have one mass prayer for everybody and i said lay hands on one another and we'll pray and just as i started to pray a voice spoke to my heart and said i looked back and i saw the sisters she had her hand up and a voice spoke and said go lay your hands on her and i jumped off the platform and i went back and i put my hand in her hand and we begin to pray and when the service was over she said brother there can i speak to you i don't speak spanish just to an interpreter i said yes ma'am she said tonight when you told the people to lay hands on one another she said nobody laid hands on me and she said i thought why does nobody care for me why would nobody lay hand on me she said i just wanted somebody to care i just wanted somebody to lay their hand on me and she said i said lord why won't nobody lay their hand on me and she said when i said that she said a voice spoke to me and said i'll lay my hand on you he said brother darling it no sooner spoke hallelujah then you put your hand in my hand no am i jesus of course not but he used my hands just like he wants to use your hands your eyes your lips to pray for your brother yours is come out somebody we are a body we need one another [Applause] amen you see his ministry is in his bride which is his body we are his body on the earth question answers on the seal the bride will be the flesh and bones of christ bone of his bone flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit then where is he he's right here with us now you know we've been wearing the mask have to wear the mask you know go in places i stopped the other day traveling somewhere and i stopped to get some chips and a drink get some gas so i'm standing there in the line and this this man walked in he must have been a local because he come walking in the store and the lady behind the cash register she said why john you've changed your mask and when she said that i about shouted past potato chips because it struck me it struck me you see all that god has done he simply just changed his mask oh hallelujah the same god that was in the body called jesus is now in the body called the bride doing the same thing he did when he was here making himself the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah verily verily i say unto you the works i do shall you do also and greater we can't do nothing greater than raise the dead and open blinded eyes but that greater means more because you see in his day it was one body signs and wonders following that body now today in his bride it's a midi membered body around the world signs and wonders following the believer jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though we were dead yet shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die martha do you believe this praise the lord and she said unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world and the bible said when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly i never noticed that before but when i started it just kind of jumped out at me she didn't go busting it hey but it was a secret message to the blood king it wasn't to everybody but it was to the blood kitten oh god anybody done their dna ancestry caught 23 of me anybody done it no y'all other i did it too yeah i did it too sis man was i ever surprised i could go anywhere in the world be at home [Applause] i could never be a racist it's impossible but when i was studying the dna do you know you get 50 of your dna from your mama and you get 50 of dna from your daddy did you know that and that's why some people say you look just like your mama another say no he looks just like his daddy and the wife always says the older you get the more like your daddy it's the dna it's the genes that was passed down from your father so you get so much from your daddy and so much from your mother naturally speaking well the natural types of spiritual and i got to look and you know what i found the prophet of god said god is our father then 50 of my spiritual dna come from my daddy and then i found a quote where brother breton said we was we was nurse from the breast of el shadia he said so you see god is your mother so i get fifty percent of spiritual dna from my daddy and fifty spin oh god then what does that make the bride she's all god manifested in the flesh amen hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah she went to mary secretly and said mary the master has come and he calls for thee and the bible says in verse 29 as soon as she heard that jesus had come she rose quickly and went to meet him you see martha the woman the church tops the woman martha tops the church so martha the church comes to mary who's still sitting in the house because she lacks revelation and the church with the message of the hour comes to mary who's sitting in the house and says listen i know you're hurting i know you have sorrow i know you feel depressed i know you're nervous i know you feel like your world's caving in i know things are happening that you never thought would happen but listen mary listen he's here and the bible says when that revelation struck her heart married quickly went out to meet jesus you see when she caught the same revelation that martha had it brought the same result when martha caught the revelation that jesus was come she got up and we meet him and when mary caught the same revelation it brought the same results she got up and went and met him amen amen amen and i say to you little bride i know it's a nervous time i know it's an unusual time i know it's a time of darkness in the time of evil and a time of unrest i realized that friends but listen i've come to tell you he's here he's right here with us now nothing has caught him by surprise this pandemic did not catch god by surprise the prophet said god's body united is his bride being one him and christ together has the spirit worked in the flesh of the church like it worked in the flesh of jesus christ because it's a part of his body not twain but one they are one a husband and wife are no longer two but one and christ and his body is one and the same spirit that was in christ the same spirit that was in christ the same spirit that was in christ is in his bride his body and that unites them together with all the word and god living in there himself manifested you see all god was he poured into christ and christ is the mystery of god revealed and all christ is he has poured into his church and the church is the revelation of jesus christ amen listen to this the prophet said it's the same as it is today there is many people this quote it just makes me sad there's many people today that love the lord and don't realize you can tell them about it and yet they can't recognize that he's alive forevermore tonight good people that love the lord but they fail to recognize he's alive forevermore he is here in his church tonight good people who loved the lord but they failed to recognize that he is in his church tonight he is in the midst of us and will be till he comes in a physical corporal body he said brother what are you saying simply this he has appeared among us but he is coming to take us home got heartache in your home go meet jesus god's need for anything go meet him anything amen he's got all the remy and everything he ain't got the remedy the prophet said he's got the cure and when that revelation struck him she got up and went to meet him and i say to you this evening why set you here in the house get up and go meet him for whatever you have need of he's here his words well brother daryl i don't feel it he never said did you feel it sensational lie to you emotions a lie to you but the word of god will never lie to you he's here because his word says so amen listen can i have just a few more minutes we thank god for every miracle that we have on tape coming up the road while ago i just listened to the message life preached there in the tabernacle in 57 and listened to testimony there in 59 in the room while ago and the miracles and the things of the prophet of god calling the people out discerning them and pronouncing them healed and oh my i love to listen to those things it just lifts my faith i thank god for every one of them the great things that god has done in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s but i am so happy that i can stand here in this pulpit tonight and say i don't have to go back to 1965 and see what he done but that same god is here with us now doing things right now working through his body on the earth now making saint john 14 12 a reality verily verily i say unto you the works i do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do just for a few minutes just for a few minutes i'd like to take just just a little bit of time and share with you some of the things that i have seen my god do i had nothing to do with it i was just there when it happened to see it but he's the same yesterday today and forever i was in pennsylvania there was a sister by the name of sister betty and sister betty had been diagnosed with glaucoma and so her eyes

eye specialist sister betty came up for prayer and the saints of god prayed for sister betty she goes monday to see an eye specialist who specializes in glaucoma and he examined her eyes you know what

[Music] [Applause] [Music] holy ghost amen [Music] amen [Music] amen [Music] you amen [Music] [Applause] amen don't you just thank the lord amen god is so mindful god doesn't do anything there's nothing that happens in our lives as believers by chance there's not even things that even how that god will lead the minister things to be said things to be called out things to be expressed and how god will speak personally to our life that's god making himself known and that he cares amen in everything it's a finished work it's just our faith coming into that place of a finished work that's how personal god is just so personal that he'll take even and how you'll guide the servant of the lord tonight every testimony is a testimony and a witness that what god did for one he'll do it for you [Music] there's no circumstance no situation that's too great god is green remember brother brahman said it like this he said the two greatest enemies of faith is time and feelings the two greatest enemies of faith is time and feelings because sometimes with time then it gives it an opportunity and the enemy can move in well i guess you didn't receive anything i guess nothing really happened and your feelings sometimes with feelings you feel worse [Music] remember what brother branham directed us to he said that's a sure sign right there just like when a person has a cancer and that life is cast out that cancer itself will get bigger but the life's already been spoken to time and feelings are the greatest enemy of faith but faith can just look at that and say god just as simple as god brought it here tonight to simply just like that little woman i remember brother daryl here just weeks ago sent that on a text on a thread and you see that little woman who laid down at the altar that night laid the alcohol down and took up her freedom her liberty in jesus christ that's the same thing for whatever the need is because you realize a sickness it's a tormenting spirit when a sickness comes around it can torment the spirit it can linger but in the name of the lord jesus christ we can lay it down and take up our liberty that belongs to us you believe that tonight he accept it tonight denying all feelings denying anything of time he said they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up he's faithful amen let's just go in the fear of the lord heavenly fathers we bow our heads tonight [Music] we just know you to be that way a personal personal god the lord you bring into our lives a personal experience lord it's experience after experience after experience lord jesus [Music] there were needs that were setting here tonight we want to thank you for coming lord whether they were sitting in this building knowing that some lord are streaming by internet even in other states away from here but lord god you'll go to where you're invited now father we we just lord believe that tonight the prayer faith has already been offered up the needs have already been presented placed on the altar and the liberty that belongs to us as sons and daughters of god is taken and we are standing but that banner raised up the lord now father we ask that you would go with us lord jesus and dear god i pray that father even in the coming moments hours days lord we ask lord god that lord jesus for your grace lord god is testimony after testimony lord god of your mercy lord god of how that you've moved lord god faith lord because it wasn't as our brother said that you heard blind bartimaeus's voice it was faith that touched him it was lord the woman with the issue of blood there's no way you could have felt her touch through all those garments it was her faith that stopped you the lord jesus that's the same thing here tonight you're the same lord jesus that come right here tonight lord to make yourself known and that for every single need you are god and you care lord now granted lord we love you and we thank you and lord as our brother testified right here tonight bringing out of the scripture that beautiful nugget of how that blind bartimaeus cast off the blind beggar's garment before he ever got to you lord lord it may be needs here tonight that's not blindness as far as in the natural but it might be blind to spiritual it might be needs lord god that's here tonight in another physical manner lord but right now in the name of the lord jesus christ we cast off that blind beggar's garment [Music] we don't need it no more we don't need it no more for jesus is here thank you father thank you for those precious nuggets lord in your word that you give to us lord god oh thank you lord thank you lord jesus but you just go with each and every one lord as we go our separate ways and give brother daryl strength and refreshment in his body and his spirit tonight lord be with us lord watch over each and every one lord i pray continue to minister to those lord that are in need lord in a healing touch lord in their bodies in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you as you're being dismissed in the name of the lord remember service tomorrow here at 11. god bless you [Music] up [Music] all the ways oh [Music] is [Music] time [Music] trampled on the ground [Music] me [Music] [Music] on the ground [Music] i'm
