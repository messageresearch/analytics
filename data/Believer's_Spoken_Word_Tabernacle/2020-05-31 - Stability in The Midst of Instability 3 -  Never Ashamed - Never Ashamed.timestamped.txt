[41:26] within it there are things that we are

[41:46] grateful to God that there's a greater
[41:49] influence
[41:51] that's taken hold on our lives
[41:55] I'm telling you this this message I'm
[41:58] not gonna preach on this today this
[42:00] message is not the thoughts and ideas of
[42:03] a man
[42:09] in the opening of 1962 in the profit
[42:13] he's gonna preach the message influence
[42:15] he's out there I'm in the mark-up of
[42:17] Ally in
[42:19] Arizona and he makes this statement he
[42:23] says all he said if the people could
[42:25] realize no remember the the Angels have
[42:28] not even come in visitation yet but he
[42:31] says oh if the people could only
[42:33] recognize what has happened he said here
[42:37] this mighty one is coming oh if they
[42:41] could only recognize what he's going to
[42:43] do
[42:44] the whole opening of the seals is Christ
[42:48] taking the seals off himself
[42:50] it's him being unveiled to his children
[42:54] and you know that you know what that is
[42:56] to come fully to come under this word is
[42:58] to come fully under the influence of the
[43:01] Living God
[43:05] then we're thought to be awed boss not
[43:09] that we make ourselves odd it's not that
[43:11] at all but we're thought to be strange
[43:14] but you know the reality of it is but
[43:16] it's God so true when he's so moved in
[43:18] our lives like that then we realized
[43:21] this world is not my home
[43:23] I'm just passing through here we have
[43:27] that same urgency as us as it has a son
[43:31] daughter of Abraham as our Father
[43:33] Abraham had where he met Melchizedek and
[43:36] he begin looking for that city it's got
[43:38] to be around here somewhere hello clover
[43:41] feet of God don't you love the Lord oh
[43:44] I tell you God is so good we just want
[43:48] to just look into the word of the Lord
[43:50] first Peter chapter 2 verse 4
[44:01] first Peter chapter two verse four and I
[44:05] just want to begin reading there
[44:09] to whom coming as unto a living stone
[44:16] disallowed indeed of men a chosen of God
[44:20] and precious
[44:22] ye also as lively stones then look at
[44:27] this tying of a family a living stone he
[44:32] said a living stone precious and chosen
[44:34] of God and then it speaks to you and I
[44:37] as lively stones its Christ and his
[44:42] bride
[44:43] ye also as lively stones are built up a
[44:48] spiritual house a holy priesthood to
[44:51] offer up spiritual sacrifices
[44:55] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[44:59] wherefore also it is contained in the
[45:03] scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief
[45:07] Cornerstone elect and precious and he
[45:10] that believeth on him shall not be
[45:13] confounded
[45:15] unto you therefore which believe he is
[45:18] precious but unto them which be
[45:20] disobedient the stone which the builders
[45:22] disallowed the same is made the head of
[45:26] the corner and a stone of stumbling and
[45:29] a rock of offence even to them which
[45:32] stumble at the word being disobedient
[45:35] where and to all so they were appointed
[45:39] but ye are a chosen generation a royal
[45:45] priesthood an holy
[45:47] nation a peculiar people the reality of
[45:52] it is we didn't know we were
[45:56] we didn't know we were
[46:00] but he knew
[46:03] he
[46:05] and it takes him to make us aware of who
[46:09] we really are
[46:12] that ye should show forth the praises of
[46:15] him who hath called you out of darkness
[46:17] into his
[46:19] marvelous light
[46:21] which in times past were not a people
[46:24] but are now the people of God which had
[46:28] not obtained mercy but now have
[46:31] obtained mercy
[46:33] I'd like by the help of the Lord to
[46:36] continue that thought stability in the
[46:39] midst of instability but I want to
[46:41] really lay up on this here this morning
[46:44] never ashamed
[46:48] never ashamed
[46:51] let's just bow our heads in the water
[46:53] prayer
[46:55] precious heavenly father
[46:58] Lord even during the time Lord of the
[47:03] prayer requests we've Lord know that it
[47:06] was mentioned for
[47:07] Lord unspoken requests that were upon
[47:10] the hearts of your children and these
[47:13] requests that are spoken and unspoken Oh
[47:16] God
[47:18] they are all opportunities for you to
[47:22] move Lord for you to make yourself known
[47:26] Lord in these situations and times as
[47:30] different ones Lord with Lord I'm going
[47:33] through of surgery and think of our
[47:35] sister surely Lord your God we want to
[47:38] remember her in prayer your God that you
[47:42] would just ministered to her Lord your
[47:44] God sister Suzanne keener Lord's he just
[47:47] Lord been dealing with that pain from
[47:49] her back and down through her leg Lord I
[47:51] know what that's like Lord God I asked
[47:54] that Lord that you would minister to her
[47:57] in a special way may the angel of the
[48:00] Lord just visit Lord their place right
[48:03] now Oh God may you just touch Lord in
[48:07] her back Oh God that discomfort Lord
[48:11] that would press upon that nerve and
[48:14] send that radiating feeling Lord that
[48:17] burning Lord crawled down the leg we ask
[48:20] in the name of Jesus Christ or God that
[48:23] you'll go to that need Lord for every
[48:26] other request Lord for every need every
[48:29] one of them are important Lord every one
[48:32] of them whether they're spoken or
[48:33] unspoken and Lord we're just lifting
[48:36] them all the Lord before your throne
[48:38] this morning for every heart for every
[48:40] life that's here we need you more we ask
[48:44] that you would just come Lord anoint us
[48:46] and may we move as one unit this morning
[48:49] a speaker and hear together we give
[48:52] ourselves to you Lord in the name of
[48:54] Jesus Christ amen
[48:56] god bless yous your being seated it's so
[48:59] good to see you in the house of the Lord
[49:01] and
[49:02] I'm sure by now we certainly don't mind
[49:05] mind any
[49:08] inconvenience that is
[49:10] through this trial that we've been in
[49:13] and
[49:13] and are in
[49:17] and
[49:19] it really calls us to put things in
[49:21] perspective but I want to deal with this
[49:23] thought this morning on and begin to see
[49:29] how far we get and looking at this on
[49:32] never ashamed
[49:33] these are things that it is that it may
[49:36] not mean too much to you but just want
[49:39] to let you know these things God dropped
[49:43] and brought weeks ago
[49:45] but these are things sometimes you know
[49:47] you you you sometimes your thought might
[49:50] look at something and think well and I
[49:53] believe I believe we're beyond that to
[49:56] even to where the enemy can come and say
[49:57] well you know this is being studied and
[49:59] this is being ministered but you know
[50:01] God knows what we have Nina
[50:04] there's God knows what we have need of
[50:06] there's however far in advance God wants
[50:09] to lay something out I've had that
[50:11] happened but just to see because
[50:14] sometimes we come into events in our
[50:17] week our weekly time and sometimes we're
[50:21] looking at that but I just say this to
[50:24] you God knows exactly
[50:27] all the events that will transpire all
[50:30] the tests everything that we will go
[50:33] through in a week or in a month or in a
[50:35] year and he prepares us to be able to
[50:39] face that battle
[50:41] so when we look at this in the scripture
[50:44] to take that thought and just ask that
[50:46] God will just help us to let it just
[50:49] resonate in our hearts never ashamed and
[50:53] I want to just draw from this in first
[50:56] Peter 2:6 or we read it says wherefore
[50:59] also it is contained in the scripture
[51:01] behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone
[51:06] elect
[51:07] precious and he that believeth on him
[51:12] shall not be confounded
[51:16] that word confounded means to
[51:20] be Dishonored disgrace to put to shame
[51:23] make a shame to be ashamed blush with
[51:27] shame one is said to be put to shame who
[51:30] suffers repulse or whom some hope has
[51:35] been deceived
[51:38] we've not been deceived
[51:46] i'ma just say it in this part here we
[51:49] are and this is a really when this stone
[51:53] this which God has placed in our life
[51:56] it's the foundation a life cannot even
[52:00] begin to grow the virtues within a life
[52:05] temperance nullity can't even come out
[52:07] without a foundation
[52:10] otherwise it becomes as the Prophet said
[52:12] you're putting
[52:15] peacock feathers into a black bird
[52:17] you've got to have a proper foundation
[52:21] and there's no other foundation Paul
[52:24] would speak of that foundation and that
[52:26] foundation is not a doctrine it's not a
[52:30] belief it's the person of Jesus Christ
[52:34] the living stone the rock as David would
[52:38] refer to him he is our place of
[52:41] foundation of where we are resting and
[52:45] are anchored within this hour
[52:49] so when we find that if our foundation
[52:53] of what we're resting on in whom were
[52:55] resting in is in him then were never
[52:57] ashamed because every expectation is to
[53:02] be passed through him
[53:05] so when we come into this air in the
[53:08] scripture there's been things that I
[53:10] will just say it like this so maybe
[53:11] it'll help you to kind of
[53:13] begin to move along with me there's been
[53:16] times of things where we thought certain
[53:19] things and our thoughts did not
[53:21] translate out that way
[53:24] there's been certain things that we have
[53:27] believed and it didn't come the way that
[53:30] we had believed
[53:32] not don't let the enemy unsettle you on
[53:37] that John the Baptist was anointed by
[53:39] God speaking indeed concerning the
[53:41] Messiah and he's standing in the water
[53:43] and what John had spoken was exactly the
[53:46] Word of God and the unction by the
[53:49] prophecy but John had a different
[53:51] thought on what should be done by the
[53:53] Messiah
[53:54] and what was it that troubled him his
[53:57] thought
[53:58] was not the word where did he get his
[54:02] thought well he was looking at the word
[54:03] but you see he John John did not put it
[54:06] in a manner to say Lord if this is your
[54:09] thoughts okay you'll bring it to fast
[54:12] but just of my thoughts oh my I don't
[54:16] want it and but you see even as a
[54:18] believer God lets us see at times the
[54:20] humanity part I'm talking about the
[54:22] scriptures because this is what you and
[54:24] I deal with every day
[54:29] this is why I believe it's very
[54:31] important as the Prophet when he was
[54:33] speaking to just a group of ministers in
[54:35] taking sides with Jesus he was very
[54:38] clear I take it very personal and I this
[54:40] is a principle I've stood on not to put
[54:43] anything out to the church that is my
[54:45] ideas I'm talking about even if it's a
[54:48] collection of quotes
[54:50] you understand because that just brings
[54:53] troubling
[54:54] we're not we've god has not asked us to
[54:57] try to form or fit things or trying to
[54:59] figure out well I want to figure out
[55:01] what this is going on I want to figure
[55:02] good that's that's not what our calling
[55:05] is about
[55:07] not to get off on Thursdays services but
[55:10] a gift is not a knife where you cut your
[55:13] way into things a gift is to get
[55:16] yourself out of the way and every one of
[55:19] us we need that that that is where we
[55:21] need in our life god help us to get out
[55:23] of the way because even in our makeups
[55:25] and how we are sometimes where some
[55:27] could be more inclined this way some can
[55:29] be more inclined this way that's why we
[55:31] need the balance of the Holy Spirit
[55:34] that's why I think God I'm not resting
[55:36] in Samuel browning I'm resting in the
[55:39] stabilisers that's been put on the ship
[55:47] in Joel chapter 2 verse 23 this remember
[55:52] it not only speaks of God bringing back
[55:56] Zion the Bride of Christ into our
[56:00] homeland of the Holy Ghost but it also
[56:03] speaks of when God will gather that of
[56:07] the remnant so these they have a
[56:09] compound meaning verse 23 be glad then
[56:12] you children of Zion and rejoice in the
[56:15] Lord your God for he hath given you the
[56:17] former rain moderately and he will cause
[56:20] to come down for you the rain the former
[56:23] rain and the latter rain in the first
[56:24] month and the floors shall be full of
[56:28] wheat and the fats shall overflow with
[56:32] oil and wine can you say amen to that
[56:35] that's exactly where we are in Christ
[56:38] and
[56:40] I will restore to you the years notice I
[56:44] will restore
[56:47] men can have a desire for it but
[56:51] remember like David you've got to follow
[56:53] God's proper channel for this
[56:55] restoration to come
[56:57] and he says I will restore to you the
[57:00] years that the locust hath eaten the
[57:03] cake Orem and the caterpillar and the
[57:05] Palmer worm my great army which I sent
[57:08] among you think of this here God is
[57:11] letting it be known
[57:12] this army that has come among you I have
[57:17] sinned it
[57:20] this totally takes away the minds of the
[57:23] people like oh my goodness you mean God
[57:26] would would send and permit evil yes
[57:30] just as much as you are I as a parent or
[57:34] are charged and commissioned by God to
[57:37] set boundaries for our children
[57:40] hello somebody to bring correction when
[57:43] it's when it's needed because if not
[57:47] where's it gonna be in the future come
[57:51] on somebody you see what you see in a
[57:53] literal word little form right now it
[57:55] just becomes a big reform if you allow
[57:58] them to have where there's no boundaries
[58:00] right now to where there's no you here
[58:03] you don't encroach on other people's
[58:04] face they'll keep on doing that this is
[58:07] a charge God's given us it's the same
[58:09] thing then you find them here in the
[58:11] floor and here they are is temper
[58:13] tantrums and whatever more when they get
[58:15] older they'll be throwing temper
[58:16] tantrums on their wife or their husband
[58:18] or this or that but it's in different
[58:20] forms it's all about still getting their
[58:24] way
[58:26] now that teaching of it doesn't give
[58:29] them the new birth the teaching is not
[58:31] the new birth but the teaching is
[58:33] necessary like Moses bringing them to
[58:36] the river and Joshua comes to take them
[58:39] over see they learn there's boundaries
[58:41] in God's word boundaries where others
[58:43] could not cross over that's free
[58:45] all of this what it comes down to is is
[58:48] that God as the Prophet would Express to
[58:51] us and the unfolding of God's character
[58:53] God's not a great big dodi grandfather
[58:59] where his kids can cram all around him
[59:02] and all over him and he sees no wrong
[59:03] that they're doing that's not God
[59:06] God he is not only and him being a God
[59:10] of love it's not just something where he
[59:12] comes down to embrace us he corrects us
[59:15] when we're wrong
[59:18] that's his love that comes to you and I
[59:21] that's not you see the concept of the
[59:24] world and the way everything is always
[59:26] gone it's so far from that they look at
[59:29] love just lets me do what I want to do
[59:32] get by with everything that's love
[59:35] that's not love
[59:39] and those who allow you to do it and
[59:41] call it love it's not love on their part
[59:47] this is I told a man the one time he's
[59:50] talking about Allah you know I went to
[59:52] school and you know they got on my kids
[59:54] and and I went to her and I just I tell
[59:57] you I just told him this and I told him
[59:59] that and I looked at mr. brother you
[1:00:01] know what your problem is your love is
[1:00:03] selfish
[1:00:05] you didn't even you didn't even go and
[1:00:08] consider what they were talking about
[1:00:11] and ask them and consider that your
[1:00:14] children I'm not even give you didn't
[1:00:16] consider that they themselves could
[1:00:19] indeed be doing something that's wrong
[1:00:23] don't worry it's nobody here
[1:00:29] you say how there could be a selfish
[1:00:31] because remember when you got to bring
[1:00:33] correction sometimes that can cause some
[1:00:35] feelings come on we've all been there I
[1:00:40] didn't feel real lovely when my dad and
[1:00:43] tan my hide
[1:00:47] he always told me I'm doing this you
[1:00:49] know this hurts me worse than you I
[1:00:51] didn't believe it didn't believe it
[1:00:56] it comes to this point see these
[1:00:59] principles they run within God's Word
[1:01:01] and God allows he has permitted this
[1:01:05] right here the locusts the canker him
[1:01:07] the caterpillar and the palm worm all to
[1:01:10] come and Bend and eat away this this
[1:01:12] tree clear down to the stump - what -
[1:01:16] the life which is the heart of the tree
[1:01:19] you see it shows that within this God
[1:01:23] has permitted this encroachment because
[1:01:26] they are not really holding the standard
[1:01:30] that God has required by his word I
[1:01:34] tell you there is no greater protection
[1:01:37] than a life that stays hidden in Christ
[1:01:42] brother Branham was very clear when he
[1:01:45] says if he says in the nation's he
[1:01:47] talked about in Sweden in different
[1:01:49] places when they had the wars he said
[1:01:51] when they had things like that going on
[1:01:53] they were praying and praying in the
[1:01:55] streets and praying he said telling you
[1:01:57] he said but once after a time that war
[1:02:00] got passed then he says you find things
[1:02:03] just start laying laxing back he says
[1:02:06] the same thing here in America we
[1:02:08] wouldn't even need bomb shelters he said
[1:02:10] if the people still were holding in
[1:02:13] prayer and looking to the Lord
[1:02:18] and listen brother branham ties it in
[1:02:21] here in in um
[1:02:23] jessabelle religion and he ties it in
[1:02:26] that there was a man clear back in the
[1:02:29] Latin Elena there was a late 20s I know
[1:02:31] his name I just can't think of it off
[1:02:33] the term in my head they hold a dinner
[1:02:35] with a memorial dinner that the
[1:02:36] presidential candidates are at every
[1:02:39] single time when an inauguration that
[1:02:41] man was a declared Catholic and brother
[1:02:43] Graham says that he said was trying to
[1:02:46] get in office back then he said but the
[1:02:48] Pentecostal people got together and they
[1:02:51] prayed and God heard their prayer let me
[1:02:55] just say this very clearly this nation
[1:02:58] is beyond redemption
[1:03:00] but why has God moving on the hearts of
[1:03:03] the Pentecostal people in that hour and
[1:03:06] it was God moving on them to pray and
[1:03:09] say God intervene we're not gonna go
[1:03:12] along with this we're not gonna accept
[1:03:15] this I don't care what this man can
[1:03:17] promise to do for us let me just say to
[1:03:19] you very clearly that right there is God
[1:03:23] moving because there was a message that
[1:03:26] had to be delivered here in this time
[1:03:30] there were people there were names that
[1:03:33] were on the book that he already
[1:03:35] redeemed but he needed to make
[1:03:38] Redemption real to you and I
[1:03:41] it is God that is at work he's been at
[1:03:45] work I
[1:03:48] mean just it and this is why that even
[1:03:51] in this time you can look and think why
[1:03:55] are we not gone already why are we not
[1:03:58] caught away already it's because they're
[1:04:01] still lives
[1:04:03] names
[1:04:04] whether on that book
[1:04:09] hallelujah they're still names that God
[1:04:13] is coming to make known redemption for
[1:04:17] come on now there's still young people
[1:04:20] to save and feel with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] amen there's still family members that
[1:04:27] need saving and feel with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:29] let me tell you something God is still
[1:04:32] in the saving business
[1:04:36] hallelujah he's still in the saving
[1:04:39] business
[1:04:45] as a parent let me just say to you like
[1:04:48] this has a parent stand steadfast in the
[1:04:51] word where the enemy could try to come
[1:04:54] and where you could have done that you
[1:04:55] should have done this you should have
[1:04:57] done that there's no parent that's
[1:04:58] perfect
[1:05:00] and anyone that thinks they are says
[1:05:03] they are you need that demon of pride
[1:05:05] cast off of you
[1:05:08] it's no we're not making allowance
[1:05:11] everything but where we know we know the
[1:05:12] ground that we're standing on we know
[1:05:14] what belongs to us
[1:05:19] hallelujah
[1:05:21] wow I
[1:05:23] didn't know that was all between 25 and
[1:05:26] 26
[1:05:28] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:05:33] satisfied
[1:05:34] are you satisfied this morning
[1:05:40] I'm satisfied
[1:05:44] and praise the name of the Lord your God
[1:05:48] that have dealt wondrously with you and
[1:05:52] my people shall never be ashamed and ye
[1:05:59] shall know that I am in the midst of
[1:06:02] Israel I love that and that I am the
[1:06:06] Lord your God and none else this is not
[1:06:09] for the nations
[1:06:12] this is not for the world out there you
[1:06:16] shall know that I am in your midst and I
[1:06:20] am the Lord your God
[1:06:22] you know that's an expression to sons
[1:06:25] and daughters of God that God loves to
[1:06:29] make himself known to
[1:06:34] hallelujah and we love we love for him
[1:06:37] to make himself known
[1:06:39] Lord Jesus we've invited you you don't
[1:06:41] got to go setting there you don't got to
[1:06:43] go set in the corner we've invited you
[1:06:45] in this service we want to welcome you
[1:06:47] we want to we want to kiss the son lest
[1:06:49] you be angry
[1:06:50] we want to wash your feet the hardened
[1:06:56] none else and my people shall never be
[1:07:01] ashamed
[1:07:06] think of this scriptures here as we said
[1:07:09] this is also prophetically speaking of
[1:07:12] the regather of Israel
[1:07:15] it's called moving sovereignly to put
[1:07:20] such a desire in their heart to go home
[1:07:24] it's called that orchestrating that when
[1:07:28] that of the bride is caught away in
[1:07:31] rapture and then that of Moses and
[1:07:34] Elijah moving there upon those two
[1:07:36] witnesses that are ordained and chosen
[1:07:38] by God there there that they're there to
[1:07:42] be made ready to put into action
[1:07:45] think of it that word let me just say it
[1:07:49] to me of that word at that moment they
[1:07:52] will preach the same baptism of the Holy
[1:07:56] Ghost to that of the hundred forty-four
[1:08:00] thousand
[1:08:02] it follows the same water for you and I
[1:08:05] in order for us to see him to meet him
[1:08:09] in the air you've got to have the token
[1:08:11] you've got to have the seal
[1:08:13] God would not allow anything to happen
[1:08:16] to Israel when the wound the wars were
[1:08:18] going on it won't the winds
[1:08:21] the right hold the winds until I have
[1:08:25] sealed my servants and
[1:08:30] God declares in the Book of Isaiah they
[1:08:33] shall know me they shall know my name
[1:08:39] that Jehovah of the old is jesus of the
[1:08:43] new
[1:08:45] so where the Prophet would pick up in
[1:08:48] the coming of the Lord in the opening of
[1:08:50] the church ages and say just as they
[1:08:53] have come to know his same power that
[1:08:55] makes them ready in preparation to look
[1:08:59] for him when he comes to reveal himself
[1:09:03] physically in crop preform to the Jews
[1:09:06] you
[1:09:07] see you would not know him in corporal
[1:09:10] form if you don't know him for who he
[1:09:12] really is who dwells behind the veil
[1:09:15] you see this is why it's important to
[1:09:17] know him then you'll recognize him no
[1:09:19] matter what veil he uses you'll
[1:09:22] recognize Jesus
[1:09:24] you come to know him in his same power
[1:09:27] his same nature is same characteristics
[1:09:30] what is it it's the God restoring
[1:09:33] everything that the enemy has eaten away
[1:09:37] and yet word comes in such a measure it
[1:09:41] comes in such a reality of the Living
[1:09:44] God till it causes the people of God to
[1:09:47] stand upon God's promise that is against
[1:09:51] every scientific ideal
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:09:56] my people shall never be ashamed
[1:10:00] God building a faith in the hearts of
[1:10:03] his children in this hour where we are
[1:10:06] believing change then are thought to be
[1:10:09] impossible
[1:10:12] my people shall never be ashamed
[1:10:17] God has sent to us a message that
[1:10:20] announced to us the rapture is on my
[1:10:23] people shall never be ashamed
[1:10:32] because we've met him
[1:10:35] we come to know him
[1:10:39] it went deeper than the veil that he was
[1:10:42] using
[1:10:46] whoo
[1:10:50] it's a clear expectation see the word it
[1:10:53] brick puts them into a clear expectation
[1:10:55] the same as it's doing for you and I now
[1:10:59] then let me read it some scriptures here
[1:11:01] in in in the Book of Psalms
[1:11:04] because they who put their trust in him
[1:11:08] will never be ashamed
[1:11:13] I'm gonna make this statement here
[1:11:15] before I read this first verse of psalm
[1:11:18] 62:5
[1:11:20] our expectation must be from him and of
[1:11:26] him
[1:11:30] that means as as the Church of the
[1:11:33] Living God we're to recognize in this
[1:11:36] hour that there are things you might
[1:11:40] have feelings you might have dreams you
[1:11:42] might have everything itself is to be
[1:11:46] proven by God
[1:11:50] that doesn't mean doubting it but
[1:11:52] there's certain things just as things
[1:11:54] Roth had spoken to me I said Lord if
[1:11:56] that's you you bring it to pass it's the
[1:12:00] same thing with dreams
[1:12:01] sometimes I don't even know what he
[1:12:03] would God has dealt with me with in
[1:12:05] truth does it mean that God will
[1:12:06] continue I don't know that's up to God
[1:12:07] but the reality of it is I know I'm not
[1:12:10] trying to make anything out of it if
[1:12:12] there is something to be made out of it
[1:12:14] God will make it out
[1:12:17] that's what I found personally see this
[1:12:20] is where the whole parts of it that when
[1:12:22] he deals even with the nine spiritual
[1:12:24] gifts let it be proven before it's out
[1:12:26] before the church
[1:12:29] are you asked me we want to stabilize
[1:12:33] these things so psalm 62:5 we want our
[1:12:36] expectations must be from him and of him
[1:12:39] so here psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou
[1:12:42] only
[1:12:44] upon God for my
[1:12:48] expectation is from him
[1:12:52] he has put in my heart when I'm
[1:12:54] expecting he's put it there
[1:12:57] these are not my ideas this is his
[1:13:01] thoughts
[1:13:03] my soul is waiting on hill
[1:13:06] or glory he only is my rock and my
[1:13:10] salvation he is my defense i shall not
[1:13:13] be moved and god is my salvation and my
[1:13:19] glory
[1:13:20] the rock of my strength and my refuge is
[1:13:26] in god
[1:13:30] he is an ever-present help in the time
[1:13:33] of trouble
[1:13:34] he's a refuge for us
[1:13:39] hallelujah I find this so striking here
[1:13:42] this is the very bank of scriptures that
[1:13:46] the Holy Spirit would direct the Prophet
[1:13:48] to read and preach the message to loan
[1:13:55] alleluiah
[1:13:57] this is a refuge because it told us in
[1:14:00] that message when he preaches that twice
[1:14:02] there's gonna be a lot of things he said
[1:14:04] going on and you get your eyes he said
[1:14:06] but keep your eyes lift up your eyes
[1:14:09] you're a speaking to the seeds and the
[1:14:12] sons and daughters of Abraham that like
[1:14:14] Abraham you've had a promise keep your
[1:14:17] eyes on the promised
[1:14:20] Abraham gonna miss Mount Moriah if he
[1:14:23] hadn't had his eyes lifted up
[1:14:27] Mount Moriah is God's grace provided for
[1:14:32] the sacrifice a man he is Jehovah Jireh
[1:14:36] enrapturing grace
[1:14:39] amen keep her eyes being looking to what
[1:14:44] God has shown to us and remember the
[1:14:46] Bible so and Abraham got there he solved
[1:14:49] that mountain
[1:14:53] it was not something he was trying to
[1:14:55] look missing he saw that Mount is
[1:14:58] something within him that it radiated
[1:15:00] brother Aaron it was the same way when
[1:15:02] the wind Amon came walking down the road
[1:15:04] that day and Here Come three men brother
[1:15:06] Bram said when Abraham being spiritual
[1:15:09] he knew there was something different
[1:15:12] about that man
[1:15:14] being spiritual you know there's
[1:15:16] something different about this message
[1:15:21] this message is not an addendum to moody
[1:15:24] or Calvin or Knox or cine or any other
[1:15:28] great men they're not taking nothing
[1:15:29] away from them but God sent a message in
[1:15:33] this hour
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:38] hallelujah a word that he has come and
[1:15:42] delivered and backed up and he's still
[1:15:44] backing it up
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:49] lets us know we've got a place of refuge
[1:15:58] verse 8 trust in him
[1:16:03] what's that say at all times
[1:16:08] it isn't always easy because of the
[1:16:12] circumstances but this is admonition
[1:16:14] trust in him at all times this ain't
[1:16:19] just talking about when times our home
[1:16:21] mother these are unsettling times it's
[1:16:24] talking about even when there are things
[1:16:25] to say peace and safety
[1:16:28] peace and safety everything's on the up
[1:16:31] and up Oh Oh Lord that's prophecy
[1:16:36] they will speak peace and safety and
[1:16:39] what does it do it's trying to stabilize
[1:16:41] the world
[1:16:44] come on friends this is where it trust
[1:16:47] in him and all that this is not a
[1:16:49] scripture for just a valley this is at
[1:16:52] all times because the things that you
[1:16:55] and I know of look the things that we
[1:16:57] see those things are not eternal but
[1:16:59] that which is unseen is eternal
[1:17:03] that's why we've got to be tied so tied
[1:17:06] to him because there's a lot of things
[1:17:09] that are around us whether it sounds
[1:17:11] good or it sounds bad whether it looks
[1:17:13] good or it looks bad we've got to have
[1:17:15] our tie in him
[1:17:20] hallelujah
[1:17:24] it's as if this scripture applied even
[1:17:26] in the church you got to trust in him at
[1:17:28] all times even when it seems like things
[1:17:30] are going good or when there's things
[1:17:32] were the enemies trying to work and
[1:17:33] divide and then to all these other you
[1:17:35] gotta trust in him at all times this is
[1:17:38] a believer a believer a believer just
[1:17:41] doesn't come to church when everything's
[1:17:43] bad
[1:17:45] there some people don't even come when
[1:17:47] it's good

[1:23:53] get there
[1:23:55] David was in that stronghold it's a
[1:23:57] place of refuge God has given us a
[1:24:00] stronghold and that stronghold is in
[1:24:03] Christ
[1:24:06] remember before David ever had moved
[1:24:09] into that of Jerusalem he first built up
[1:24:12] Zion
[1:24:14] he built up the other strongholds that
[1:24:17] were fortification points coming to
[1:24:20] Jerusalem and God has prepared and built
[1:24:23] his church

[1:25:41] these eyes right here
[1:25:43] well lay out the steps have alright I
[1:25:46] don't I don't have those steps to lay
[1:25:47] out I just know what he said in his word
[1:25:49] so when there's a step that's coming
[1:25:51] forth then I'm sure he's there to give
[1:25:53] me a little bit of inspiration to take
[1:25:55] that step notice blessed is the man that
[1:25:58] trust in him the lord redeemeth the soul
[1:26:01] of his servants and none of them that
[1:26:05] trust in him shall be desolate
[1:26:10] Psalms 37 39 the salvation of the
[1:26:14] righteous is of the Lord
[1:26:17] he is their strength in the time of
[1:26:22] trouble and
[1:26:26] the Lord shall help and deliver them he
[1:26:32] shall deliver them from the wicked and
[1:26:34] save them because they trust in him
[1:26:45] so we're talking about never ashamed
[1:26:52] talking about a balanced life I'm not
[1:26:56] gonna I hope I'm not going to read the
[1:26:58] quote to you again out of Christ
[1:26:59] revealed in his own word I've read it a
[1:27:01] few services where the stabilizers have
[1:27:04] been put on the ship
[1:27:08] and
[1:27:13] that whole point is so that the ship for
[1:27:17] those it's inside the ship we gave that
[1:27:19] example if this was the table and my
[1:27:23] drinks and dinner and whatever's on the
[1:27:26] table the stabilizers that are beneath
[1:27:29] the water I don't even know that they're
[1:27:31] moving I don't even mean the waves can
[1:27:34] be rocking and reeling up
[1:27:37] but those stabilizers that
[1:27:40] are beneath the surface of the water
[1:27:44] it allows that which is visible to
[1:27:48] remain steadfast
[1:27:49] so that we're not chasing our stake
[1:27:52] across the table and then chasing the
[1:27:54] officer Costello so we're not using this
[1:27:56] right here and we're not chasing this
[1:27:58] way
[1:27:59] you saying what are you saying that God
[1:28:02] stabilizes we're not trying to chase
[1:28:04] things down
[1:28:07] but I have to try to chase things down
[1:28:10] was stable you know what that New York
[1:28:13] that allows me to do rather Dave when
[1:28:14] we're stable it allows me to eat
[1:28:24] I know some of you're like yeah we got
[1:28:26] it
[1:28:30] you said you got that it allows me to do
[1:28:35] what I'm supposed to be doing
[1:28:38] it's not up to me to have that pump oh
[1:28:42] is that pump going does the pump
[1:28:43] recognize the wave well I wonder how
[1:28:45] this way or is this way how how much
[1:28:47] these orange arrows topically on these

[1:30:44] in and here we are while on the outside
[1:30:46] if you could look out the window and
[1:30:48] they had one of those buoys out there
[1:30:50] that thing would be popping and
[1:30:52] everything else was going on but here
[1:30:54] you are in the midst of it
[1:30:57] whoo bad storm out there but man this
[1:31:00] thing's good I
[1:31:03] don't know buddy check out on me right
[1:31:05] now I
[1:31:07] can't help Who I am if I had better
[1:31:10] examples and if you think I need
[1:31:12] something you need to pray for me I
[1:31:14] just have to be Who I am
[1:31:18] balance life it's a balance walk so
[1:31:20] we're not we're not walking like like
[1:31:22] this you know it's like they talked
[1:31:24] about with people with a pelvic tilt
[1:31:26] when all of a sudden they'll go to maybe
[1:31:28] kneel down or squat down things will go
[1:31:30] a certain way now how to balance
[1:31:34] right sometimes that out of balance
[1:31:37] those things can affect everything in
[1:31:39] your in your body you say when the world
[1:31:40] is having the snap and some bones back
[1:31:42] in place have to do with sinus
[1:31:43] infections
[1:31:46] your heads not connect not disconnected
[1:31:49] you don't take your head off at night
[1:31:50] put it on the dresser everything is
[1:31:52] connected the body is connected among
[1:31:55] the Church of the Living God everything
[1:31:57] is connected
[1:31:59] that's why you can't just have a bone
[1:32:01] out of place it's got to get back in
[1:32:02] place oh
[1:32:05] my goodness all this
[1:32:08] man it's a good Lord
[1:32:13] balanced life a
[1:32:15] balanced walk with God
[1:32:19] it takes the help of the Lord I'll tell
[1:32:21] you I said I take the help of the Lord
[1:32:24] because in our first birth it's
[1:32:28] imbalanced
[1:32:30] that birth come to imbalance everything
[1:32:33] what have you did it brought us away
[1:32:36] from being equal with God
[1:32:39] it brought us away from from that
[1:32:42] reflection of the image of God it threw
[1:32:45] us out of balance just as the earth was
[1:32:47] thrown out of balance in the days of
[1:32:49] Noah
[1:32:51] see so then it takes Claude to bring us
[1:32:56] back in balance back in line the earth
[1:32:58] will have its day
[1:33:00] but because the earth is out of balance
[1:33:03] right now and spinning at that 23 and
[1:33:05] 1/2 degree tilt God is going to bring it
[1:33:08] back up right
[1:33:12] what that's its original standing oh my
[1:33:16] god didn't mean for you to be bowed over
[1:33:18] like this as far as like knuckling down
[1:33:21] to the devil but in our hearts we submit
[1:33:23] to the Lord but in our hearts when we've
[1:33:26] submitted to the Lord the upright we
[1:33:28] just read trust in the Lord he brings us
[1:33:31] back into that place remember Esther
[1:33:34] came before the king but the Kings
[1:33:36] extended his golden scepter what wilt
[1:33:38] thou estra
[1:33:42] Alleluia ask according to the authority
[1:33:46] that's been vested in your life by the
[1:33:48] word
[1:33:49] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:33:52] you ask what you will it shall be done
[1:33:56] balanced life balanced walk
[1:33:59] her
[1:34:02] the beginning to drive
[1:34:05] you look years ago and my dad was
[1:34:08] teaching me hey you know
[1:34:11] dad you know he like hey I
[1:34:14] don't want you running through every
[1:34:16] juggle
[1:34:18] then watch oh yeah don't put the brakes
[1:34:22] on when you come into a hole you know
[1:34:24] all those things yeah I understand that
[1:34:27] somehow that same vocabularies come out
[1:34:37] what I'm alluding to is that over time
[1:34:39] hitting them chuckles like that here
[1:34:42] throw a car out of line
[1:34:45] that car can still drive on the road
[1:34:49] but you ever seen them go down the road
[1:34:51] and they're going down the road and here
[1:34:53] they are like like this and then
[1:34:56] especially seeing them big vans you know
[1:34:59] like this you're like
[1:35:01] see you got to get in a certain position
[1:35:04] so it looks straight
[1:35:06] all out of line what did that
[1:35:11] continual heating of chuckles let me
[1:35:13] just say this you're not gonna be able
[1:35:15] to avoid every juggle
[1:35:20] especially if you live in a hurry
[1:35:25] it lightens you up a little bit
[1:35:28] you're gonna know your car's gonna have
[1:35:31] to go in for an alignment oh
[1:35:33] brother Samuel that's $70 unless you
[1:35:36] know you've got the skills like certain
[1:35:37] brothers have in the church but
[1:35:39] otherwise that $70 for alignment will
[1:35:42] save you a whole lot more of hundreds
[1:35:44] later on
[1:35:46] because when it's out of line it puts
[1:35:48] pressure on everything now I brother joy
[1:35:50] could come and give you a whole whole
[1:35:52] series on all this right here I'm not
[1:35:53] gonna try to go there
[1:35:57] but what I'm saying is is that we need
[1:36:00] all of us by the help of God a continual
[1:36:04] balancing
[1:36:06] sometimes we can get to look into things
[1:36:08] and we'll we'll go we'll go and if we
[1:36:10] keep going keep going and it's not
[1:36:12] checked pretty soon here we are we're
[1:36:14] going right down the road like this and
[1:36:16] for anybody to see us in the right way
[1:36:18] they've got to get turned in crooked too
[1:36:26] but the stabilizers have been put on the
[1:36:28] ship look another band says stay in the
[1:36:32] word these are the admonishments of the
[1:36:36] Holy Spirit to our life he didn't say
[1:36:37] try to figure it out he said just stay
[1:36:39] in it let God bring it all together but
[1:36:43] how I've encouraged you get in it stay
[1:36:46] in it
[1:36:47] listen to the message
[1:36:50] get into it ask God Lord reveal yourself
[1:36:55] to me
[1:36:56] read your Bible and pray
[1:37:02] pour your heart out before him
[1:37:06] see it's not to make ourselves on
[1:37:09] because any time when it becomes an idea
[1:37:12] and brother branham would use these
[1:37:14] kindest types of terms when we go to
[1:37:16] make ourselves odd we end up drawing
[1:37:18] ourselves out from everybody else and
[1:37:22] somehow another that spirit comes along
[1:37:24] and that spirit gets up on people that
[1:37:26] everybody's wrong except then
[1:37:32] then they go to separating and getting
[1:37:34] off to their self and the Prophet said
[1:37:35] that's exactly what the hounds of hell
[1:37:38] want to do I mean look at those lions
[1:37:41] and everything else when they come into
[1:37:42] a herd little an you know what I'm
[1:37:44] talking about they come among you know
[1:37:46] it's a big old group of them water
[1:37:48] buffalo it's enough to try to get one of
[1:37:50] them guys you know I mean they have to
[1:37:53] find and they look for a weak one
[1:37:56] then they try to do a tactic of spook
[1:38:00] the herd and when they spook the herd is
[1:38:02] somebody paying attention they'll get
[1:38:04] him isolated
[1:38:06] see the devil's tactic he wants to spook
[1:38:09] first try to bring fear and then get you
[1:38:11] off
[1:38:20] balance
[1:38:21] is to be balanced
[1:38:24] not tilting you know remember the old
[1:38:26] the fulcrum in the middle
[1:38:29] garlock's are just balance
[1:38:31] just weights right
[1:38:35] all this right here here comes down
[1:38:37] there's got to be we want our lives to
[1:38:40] be equal with the Word of God
[1:38:44] meaning that what the word says that's
[1:38:47] what we are
[1:38:48] that's what's being reflected and you
[1:38:52] know what the beautiful thing we don't
[1:38:54] have to try to manifest it it's who we
[1:38:57] are
[1:38:59] it's who we are
[1:39:04] it's like some of you right now if you
[1:39:06] haven't had it happen you just wait if
[1:39:08] God Terry's you get older there are
[1:39:09] certain things that I would poke fun at
[1:39:10] my dad about and this and that and now I
[1:39:13] just hear coming out
[1:39:14] of course I see a whole lot more my mom
[1:39:17] come on that's with her
[1:39:18] nothing wrong with that mom
[1:39:25] balance is to be balanced not tilting
[1:39:27] you know somebody's walking like this
[1:39:31] I
[1:39:33] remember one time some of you remember
[1:39:35] when I
[1:39:37] had a time a boy that went one part of
[1:39:40] my my back from my lower back it pulled
[1:39:42] me over like this and I was walking down
[1:39:43] I had to walk down the halls like this
[1:39:45] the one day it got so bad by the time
[1:39:47] the school went on it pulled down on
[1:39:49] this side through this leg that nerve
[1:39:51] just Oh and I'm walking like this I
[1:39:53] can't even hardly I can't sit down you
[1:39:55] know how it is you go to sit down it's
[1:39:56] like I'll just stand because if I go to
[1:39:58] sit down it's just it's the spasms or
[1:40:00] work you're out of line when you
[1:40:03] somebody walking like this something's
[1:40:04] not right
[1:40:05] something's not right so this is why
[1:40:08] Paul would say walk not as other
[1:40:10] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[1:40:13] mind
[1:40:14] never have a balanced walk with God
[1:40:18] so Lord you balance me out
[1:40:22] we need his help we need his help all of
[1:40:25] us do so rather than the balances that
[1:40:28] we would be in Lang with his word his
[1:40:30] thoughts his spirit we're in it is him
[1:40:34] stabilizing us
[1:40:38] and God has given us his word by his
[1:40:41] Spirit that we might stay stable
[1:40:44] so
[1:40:47] when they look at this here let me just
[1:40:50] go and begin just to just a few moments
[1:40:54] here to take us in look at look at
[1:40:56] something here in the word of
[1:40:59] hear a setting that we all could be very
[1:41:04] familiar with in second chronicles
[1:41:05] chapter 32 verse 1 the Bible says after
[1:41:09] these things the establishment thereof
[1:41:11] Sennacherib king of Assyria came and
[1:41:15] entered into Judah and encamped against
[1:41:17] the fence cities and thought to win them
[1:41:20] for himself
[1:41:23] and when Hezekiah saw the Sennacherib
[1:41:27] was come and that he was purposed to
[1:41:29] fight against Jerusalem he took counsel
[1:41:31] with his princess this is what has the
[1:41:34] kind did Pig saw that Sennacherib was
[1:41:37] purposed to fight against the city
[1:41:43] said what is that it's discernment
[1:41:47] I'm telling you brothers and sisters we
[1:41:50] need discernment
[1:41:56] Satan's a sly devil that's not
[1:41:58] glorifying here it's just saying let me
[1:42:00] just put you to this point but the RAM
[1:42:02] tells us in the first seal he said he
[1:42:04] can outdo any of us but he can't outdo
[1:42:06] the holy ghost
[1:42:16] this is what he did he saw the
[1:42:17] advancement of the enemy so he took
[1:42:20] counsel with his princes and his mighty
[1:42:23] men to stop the waters of the fountains
[1:42:27] which were without the city Hezekiah is
[1:42:29] one of the last Kings before they are
[1:42:31] carried away in exile
[1:42:33] here comes this advancement into the
[1:42:35] land he gathers his council princes of
[1:42:38] mighty men he says stop the waters of
[1:42:40] the fountains which are without the city
[1:42:42] and they did help him
[1:42:44] so there was Martin that was gathering
[1:42:47] much people together
[1:42:48] who stopped all the fountains
[1:42:53] and the brook that ran through the midst
[1:42:56] of the land saying why should the kings
[1:42:59] of Assyria come and find much water
[1:43:04] hezekiah saw the encroachment of the
[1:43:08] enemy
[1:43:09] when he saw it he called his captains
[1:43:12] and his princess
[1:43:15] which is bring a time he got together
[1:43:18] the Watchmen
[1:43:20] are you with me he got together the
[1:43:23] Watchmen and the Watchmen then there's a
[1:43:25] gathering of the people with what now
[1:43:28] what Hezekiah has saw perhaps the people
[1:43:31] could not see it but even if they did he
[1:43:34] wants them to be able to see it through
[1:43:36] God's eyes
[1:43:40] and so here's what they're gonna do they
[1:43:43] can't stop that of the kings of Assyria
[1:43:45] these advances that are coming this king
[1:43:48] is like he's over here in this land
[1:43:50] right now but he's sending he sent he
[1:43:51] sent and where I'm coming to you next
[1:43:53] Israel
[1:43:55] so he sends these people with messages
[1:43:58] I'm coming to get you next so he sees
[1:44:01] the advancement and brother Brian here's
[1:44:03] what he says cut off their water supply
[1:44:06] then come in the land but I don't have
[1:44:08] to entertain them
[1:44:10] the devil can send all kinds of thoughts
[1:44:13] but you don't have to entertainment
[1:44:15] all sorts of things can come your way
[1:44:17] you can cut off the water supply water
[1:44:20] is that of a source of life and
[1:44:23] refreshment you don't want to refresh
[1:44:25] the enemy's thoughts
[1:44:28] catch them out
[1:44:31] catch them out cut off the water supply
[1:44:35] what do you mean brother Samuel quit
[1:44:38] giving your time to the things of the
[1:44:41] world
[1:44:43] cut off the water supply where the
[1:44:47] devil's been saying this the devil's
[1:44:49] been doing this and this is being said
[1:44:51] and that's being said cut off the water
[1:44:53] supply
[1:45:04] I'm somebody no matter how how the devil
[1:45:07] comes you'll come to a person who's sick
[1:45:09] and tell them huh look are you feeling
[1:45:12] your body how long you been on this how
[1:45:15] long you been on this medication how
[1:45:16] long is this going on huh
[1:45:18] what should I do cut off the water
[1:45:21] supply
[1:45:22] sometimes cutting off the water supply
[1:45:24] means cutting the umbilical cord to
[1:45:27] Google
[1:45:30] preach brother send think a will
[1:45:35] last time I checked Google's not God
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:42] and I might be setting that brother
[1:45:44] Scott but I don't want to set brother
[1:45:46] Scott up but if I had something less and
[1:45:48] real question about ask brother Scott
[1:45:50] you say he's a he's a you know he's a
[1:45:52] podiatrist he's a an orthopedic or but
[1:45:55] he also remembered that's a specialist
[1:45:58] he knows all the other groundwork
[1:46:01] but even in that he'd get tired of me
[1:46:04] bugging him brother Scott what about my
[1:46:07] big toe brother Samuel now it's your big
[1:46:08] toe lastly was dumb this fella there's
[1:46:11] some news on this
[1:46:17] but there's gotta be get ready change
[1:46:19] his name to Luke
[1:46:20] they call me Paul
[1:46:22] [Laughter]
[1:46:25] amen amen
[1:46:28] but we want to cut off the water supply
[1:46:32] to the kings of Assyria
[1:46:34] cut it off let me just leave you with
[1:46:37] this and it would just stop here
[1:46:40] for sake of time
[1:46:44] this is a very important scripture
[1:46:48] and
[1:46:49] he strengthened himself
[1:46:54] this is what Hezekiah did
[1:46:57] he strengthened himself
[1:47:00] he's seen the enemy's advancement so he
[1:47:04] takes necessary action
[1:47:07] now what I'm going to read what I'm
[1:47:10] going to read here we have no account
[1:47:14] and second chronicles and second Kings
[1:47:17] and Isaiah 36 Isaiah 37 we have no
[1:47:20] account that God told him personally to
[1:47:25] do this what he's going to do
[1:47:27] but there are some things God's already
[1:47:30] told us
[1:47:32] you see friends this is where it comes
[1:47:34] being established in the word and we are
[1:47:37] to know the word
[1:47:42] if people say well I was sick nobody
[1:47:46] called me you didn't follow the
[1:47:47] scriptural order
[1:47:49] come on say a man the scripture says let
[1:47:53] them that are sick call
[1:47:56] for the elders of the church
[1:47:59] will you do kick that devil up cut cut
[1:48:02] off the waters of black nobody cares
[1:48:04] about me it had called me I was sick
[1:48:06] nobody brought me a chicken noodle soup
[1:48:08] that
[1:48:09] saltine crackers
[1:48:12] nobody nobody cares kick that devil now
[1:48:16] get out of here I'm a part of the body
[1:48:19] of Jesus Christ in whom the same black
[1:48:21] dwells that came down and moved upon my
[1:48:24] life get out of here you're not getting
[1:48:27] no more water
[1:48:28] look if you stand there as parched as a
[1:48:30] dog no more water
[1:48:37] this is Scripture if there be any sick
[1:48:41] among you let him call for the elders of
[1:48:43] the church
[1:48:45] remember we want God to be the god of
[1:48:47] the way then we have to follow the way
[1:48:50] for god to be the god of the world
[1:48:54] you're not getting no more water and
[1:48:57] you've tried to get me out of balance
[1:49:00] where I'm often my thinking
[1:49:04] nobody loves me nobody cares about me
[1:49:08] woo you need an alignment
[1:49:12] may not be high cutting it might be bone
[1:49:15] cracking
[1:49:17] he strengthened himself and built up all
[1:49:21] the wall that was broken
[1:49:27] you know what this did it caused
[1:49:30] Hezekiah to reflect where are the areas
[1:49:34] of my life that
[1:49:36] had been broken
[1:49:40] see this is discernment he sees the
[1:49:43] enemy coming
[1:49:44] addresses what addresses cut off the
[1:49:46] water supply get the people together
[1:49:48] let's cut the water supply off so he
[1:49:50] cuts the water supply off but then now
[1:49:52] the word he stands there he knows who he
[1:49:55] is he says Lord what are the places in
[1:49:58] my life he's not listen in reality we
[1:50:01] know the areas that need to be built up
[1:50:06] listen friends even coming out of
[1:50:11] and here we are and you know lives are
[1:50:13] having to resume
[1:50:15] life's going on
[1:50:19] but as the Spirit of God has and I
[1:50:22] wouldn't believe just here I think all
[1:50:24] around
[1:50:25] there's no just hitting a resume button
[1:50:28] I'm gonna be just like I was before
[1:50:31] you're either gonna be closer to God or
[1:50:33] you're further away and that's a daily
[1:50:37] walk
[1:50:40] is your life for the gospel he says if
[1:50:43] we fail to walk and follow him daily not
[1:50:45] only the spiritual day but daily we take
[1:50:48] on an organizational life what does an
[1:50:51] organization or life do always looking
[1:50:53] behind
[1:50:55] but see he's not just the God who was
[1:50:58] behind us he's before us he's leading us
[1:51:01] somewhere
[1:51:04] so he saw the areas that needed to be
[1:51:06] built up maybe your prayer life needs to
[1:51:09] be build up build it up oh
[1:51:11] god I want you to come down and build on
[1:51:13] my prayer God he you know you and I both
[1:51:15] know what areas we let down we need to
[1:51:18] build those areas up
[1:51:20] why because we're surrounded like David
[1:51:23] said in Psalms 27th the Hinderer Hall
[1:51:26] shouldn't camp around about
[1:51:30] build up all the wall that was broken
[1:51:33] and it raised it up to the towers high
[1:51:37] that's a lot of working
[1:51:39] and
[1:51:41] another wall without I
[1:51:45] saw the enemy's advancements and he went
[1:51:49] into
[1:51:50] building and repairing
[1:51:55] you know if that shows brother Brian
[1:51:57] right in the midst of the enemy's
[1:51:58] advancement this is where here's the
[1:52:00] ship the ship's it's just staying stable
[1:52:02] here we are building up Lord I've been
[1:52:05] relaxing this Lord help me get built up
[1:52:11] see where our focus becomes is on him
[1:52:15] who is there to strengthen us
[1:52:26] and repaired meal

[1:53:33] to say oh it's not a cancer he said oh
[1:53:35] no it is a cancer but what's he doing he
[1:53:39] says but you must recognize that that
[1:53:41] God who is in you has already over
[1:53:45] comment you don't get anywhere with the
[1:53:50] enemy's advancements by trying to
[1:53:52] pretend it's not there

[1:55:03] help us each and every one no matter
[1:55:05] where you're at in your life or your
[1:55:07] walk but to understand there's a
[1:55:11] besieging the enemy is all around us
[1:55:15] more deadly than
[1:55:17] coronavirus and all that but we're
[1:55:20] besieged
[1:55:21] from the day you come out of your
[1:55:24] mother's womb
[1:55:25] you've been besieged
[1:55:27] and then it gets into a certain time in
[1:55:31] a life and the enemy makes an
[1:55:33] encroachment
[1:55:36] you can look in your life and say Lord
[1:55:38] this
[1:55:41] test or this trial what we're facing or
[1:55:44] what I'm facing right now what's before
[1:55:46] me what should I do first of all cut off
[1:55:49] the water supply I know I know they
[1:55:52] didn't have it like that before but they

[1:56:46] in you
[1:56:50] that will back the devil up
[1:56:54] he wants to come again

[1:58:25] God didn't build the wall form but he
[1:58:28] gave him the strength to do it to where
[1:58:31] they could focus on what they needed to
[1:58:32] focus on knowing that the enemy's
[1:58:35] advance was there but here they are

[2:00:10] just like as we would take the pathways
[2:00:13] of your word

[2:02:45] them to see that the encroachments and
[2:02:46] advancements and the besiegement of hell

[2:03:51] it's a covering is to try to make a
[2:03:54] person tries to make themselves
[2:03:55] something Lord
