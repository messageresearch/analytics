grateful Nord the song that Lord we're singing what meaning it has Lord to our lives or the very meaning that down through the ages that Satan has fought against he could never and cannot stop your plan and you're working you try to hinder it but he cannot stop it morning you came down Lord and such humility and simplicity oh god if it stumbled the wisdom of this world whoa God how that you come and revealed yourself Lord to people who were not smart and learned people they were not they did not recognize you because of earthly wisdom but father it was given before the foundation of the world and Lord your very presence moving down in the fulfillment of a Word of God he would take a hold in their lives boy oh god that light moving in would bring us separation Lord we it's beyond what our mind Lord our mind can not comprehend it but our heart says amen oh god it's a reality that is so deep and so real it's more real than Lord the very clothes that we have on it's more real Lord oh god what what greatness came down in such simplicity Lord you would hide and reveal yourself in the same way Lord we're thankful to know that God by the grace of God we are in that program Lord included in that program and the Lord Satan cannot stop the Word of God from coming to pass we bless your Holy Name Lord we're thankful to be in that place where to be in you we asked Lord this morning if there's one here that's not their main Lord from their heart you bring them to this place I ask for God that you would bless us this morning as we gather together speak to our hearts in a personal way father may you come Lord just guide and direct the Lord every part of the service for your glory we ask that you bless the offering Lord God is to be lifted here bless the worshipper Lord as they Lord

it's you you're providing for yourself you are Jehovah Jireh Lord we thank you this morning we asked it Lord you are just the Lord moving upon us Lord further with your presence this morning in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you with real [Music] [Music] sacrifice [Music] it's personal [Music] [Music] thank you lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the name of the Lord if you have your Bibles this morning we want to go right to the book of Philemon I want to say this I know some are a number of people that stayed down after the wedding yesterday and just had just such a wonderful time and so happy for mother Brian sister Mariah and so just just good - it's also good to be back home I feel like I just got out of a suitcase there on Friday night and the boy said dad I bet you're tired in a hotel said I am I said I'm not much for many how but I I'm just I'm glad to be back home so good to see each and every one of you and we just want to look here in the word of the Lord this morning for a few moments and so glad to have brother Jerry here with us and I think the Lord willing he's going back on Tuesday mornings so we just just want to ask the Lord just to be with him and just refreshing for all the sacrifice that has been made so here in the book of Philemon I want to just start with verse with verse 8 is where I'd like to start with and when we look at this this this book for layman I know I've ministered out of it before and different things but when you look at it you realize that that Paul would take great great pains to write this letter personally to Philemon who was a believer this this letter accompanied the letter that was sent to the Colossians search that we know as the book of Colossians but Paul would see fit that this would be wrote personally to Philemon who was a brother who was the one who actually had the church enclosure in his home because remember they didn't have public they didn't have buildings like we do now that was until about 300 years later but they would gather there in their homes or in public places and this is where they had church so here is his flamin he's roped Paul is writing to him and I just want to pick it up in verse 8 he's commended him and talked about his character and now he writes to him and says wherefore though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee being such an one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ in that tremendous Paul is actually in prison at the time that he's writing this but Paul did not say I am a prisoner of Rome he realized the circumstances that he was in they were not going to dictate his joy and who he was Paul said I'm here this is not an accident but I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ I'll beseech thee verse 10 for my son honest honest whom i have begotten in my bonds which in times past was to the unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me whom I have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels my heart's affection whom I would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel but without thy mind would I do nothing that by benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly for perhaps I want you to look at this verse for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou should astre sieve him forever not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as my self if he have wronged thee or Oh at the art put that on mine account I Paul have written it with mine own hand I will repay it I'll be it I do not say to the how thou owest unto me even thy own self besides the a brother let me have joy of the in the Lord refresh my bowels in the Lord having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee knowing that thou will also do more than I say amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word your being seated you know just just something just struck my heart Lea I was reading through this portion just was directed back here and reading through this portion of scripture and you know when we look at this with a personal letter that is wrote on behalf of Philemon here he is or behalf of Anissa --mess it's wrote to Philemon and it's on behalf of a runaway escaped slave and you you you're aware would you read the New Testament where Paul would write even in the book of Corinthians that every man abide in the calling wherewith he was called and Paul would write in many of the different epistles that you had brothers and sisters setting within the church and you would have those who were servants and those who were masters and it wasn't the stigma or the connotation that we would maybe have in our mind from some of the things that are tried to be presented to us here within you know recent years and other things it wasn't it wasn't in that manner but yet Paul himself as a matter of fact you traveled to many of the other countries even when I've been to the Philippines and I've been to other places you find many times where it's not uncommon for them to have servants within their home and it becomes a manner and means of employment for somebody to be there and when you we consider this how Paul would write about masters and servants and how that you one is to conduct themselves and how they're to have their place and that we are truly indeed brothers and sisters in the Lord I look at the setting within this of where that Anissa --mess here he is Paul is in is in is in prison far away from where oh nice or nice Amos and Philemon are residing but when Anissa mmus here he is is stolen from his master and he and he actually departs and it begins to he flees and you know the reality is is that I don't know what kind of a man then onesimus was all together I don't know what the Bible does not tell us and even in history accounts of all together what type of a man did he have a shady track record I don't know but there is something about it that there was that which Paul himself wasn't the anisa mmus was not unknown to Paul Paul knew him and to think about when onesimus would would would take off and he would run from what he has done you know you can't help but wonder how that Onesimus no doubt was having to look over his shoulder everywhere he was going because you know there's something about it when a person is guilty they feel like everybody else knows their guilt it's something about it that no matter where they go they just seem in English and so they've got their head over their shoulder and there's an unrest there's a nervousness there's a that which comes about their life that's an unsettledness and there's no doubt about it that Onesimus was home that he was on the run and Oney tzimmes did not and there's no doubt he did not realize that where he was heading that there was going to be a man who would know him but more importantly than Paul knowing him there was a there was an event that was going to take place in his life that would bring a change that would be eternal he did not realize this he was just trying to run away and you know you think about it from the very beginning when the fall came in the garden it is always within the nature of man to want to hide himself from the presence of God when he knows he cannot stand in God's presence justified he wants to run from it then in reality to understand this that's why they that's why when the presence of God is moving in and a service you watch how that spirits themselves will get anxious and get nervous and calls people to do certain things the same services where the Holy Ghost is falling and people are being filled with the Holy Ghost let's say on this side there are Devils rising up right over here I've witnessed it again and again within meetings and the witness said that even how that you know Satan sometimes will will get up on when people need to really be aware of the presence of God and give themselves to the Lord who can help them with in that moment but there's something about it that fear will arise up and the reality is is we in in with the Lord we have nothing to be afraid of if there's anyone that can help us and truly the only one who ever can is the Lord Jesus himself there's other people who can talk to you they could appease you but there's nobody that can bring the settlement rupee's elect the Lord Jesus himself can give and I and I wonder you know when the nisi mist comes into this time if no doubt you know he's looking around and he probably thinks you know Here I am in this place and my nobody's gonna know me I can start Life all over but the reality is it wouldn't matter where he goes his situation goes with him well I'm gonna preach now that's why sometimes you see friends the the the real reality is not so much in a person changing their location out here it's getting into the right place in Christ you know you can change from church to church to church but the reality is you've got to get in Christ if not the same things happen pattern repeats itself given time and situations it will only continue to repeat you cannot there's only one that can break that pattern and that is the Lord Jesus Christ and coming into the right place and that's what I want to talk about this morning the right place only tzimmes did not realize it but he had arrived at the right place here was a man that he knew a nice Ennis and I wonder how it was when Paul would say on these Simmons I wonder if he looked around and thought maybe there's somebody else here that's the main that as well because they even to have the mention of his name it would mean somebody knows him and knows his situation knows his background knows his past but Paul was one that knew what it was to be forgiven Paul was one who you know went on ISA mister there there was such an accompanying presence that Paul was not one to take on nice him ascend and just say well you know we love you in this and that and he would continue on in the same condition but there was that we understand that Paul had to had the Ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ of the true atonement to where that he would be able to minister to honest honest what he actually needed to lift that condemnation over his life and be able to place within that life the real reality of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to wear how nice in this was no longer he wasn't just going to be forgiven but there had to come a change in his life because if you just forgiving there is a there is a point where the pattern can come right back again there's got to be one who can break the pattern for us it becomes a sample and a cycle is meant to be broken and there's only one that can break that and it takes the Lord Himself to come down into that heart to tie us back in to where we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world a new creation is an ad is an act of Almighty God coming down into that life and bringing a change to where that person is not trying to be different they're not trying to be good there is a life that has entered in there that is not them who's living any longer but it is Christ who is living his old life through them oh girl repeated God I'll think of this here on Intimus he comes to that that one of the first star in the right hand of him who sat on the throne and it wasn't just enough to get to Paul but Paul was able to take him to a place through the Ministry of the word to her own niece Ennis could walk out of there and he was free there's no doubt about it when Paul would write this letter and he's going to send this letter back and aneisa miss is going to be a bearer of this letter there's no doubt about it he's going to have to go and face he's going to be calling to face those that knew all about him they knew the situation they knew all of that let me just tell you friends this morning you can run and run and run and run but you'll never get away from the guilt and the condemnation until you get enterprise well actually not only forgives you but he changes your nature [Music] sometimes people try to bury themselves in so many other things they take hobbies they take all sorts of pleasure and they try to hide that's so that's crying out and it's longing for life they'll bury it in work they're buried in all sorts of other things but the reality is there's only one way it's got to face the reality then Lord I need your touch this was not a City of Refuge by name but he was he was not horny Simas was not running as he were to a City of Refuge but to understand how God had given cities of refuge in the Old Testament that for those who had you know slayed somebody an accident had happened and they could go to the city of refuge there were six cities that were appointed and all of that spoke in time of the Lord Jesus Christ himself now I want you to catch this very closely it was not enough just to come to the gate of the city and sit there if you came to the gate of the city the pursuer when then you know maybe they were chopping like the scripture would say they were chopping wood and the axe head it came off and it killed a man the person never intended to do that but they could not wait around and try to explain it to the family that would be pursuing them they simply had to drop everything and run to that city of refuge but it was not just enough to come there to the outside gate because the manslayer this is number six could actually lay ahold of that person and kill them they had to come in to that City of Refuge miss a clear it's not enough to be in a church where the truth is being preached it's not enough where the Spirit of God is where that's not enough it's not enough just to know the message you've got to get in the our church because the manslayer the Avenger is out and he's after the ladies and here Onesimus he comes to that place and he reaches this place to where Paul could write what we just read he departed from you for a season but he said this departure he's returning to you more profitable than he ever could sometimes departure is hard there's sometimes there's things that we want it to go in a certain way maybe Paul wanted on Lisa Messiah Lord deal with him I wanted to stay right here but God knows how to deal with each and every one of us God didn't make them nice you must do what he needed to do but God was watching over and orchestrating every part you tell me how did Anissa must get to this place where Paul was he didn't run because he knew Paul was there but God seemed to it he got to where he needed to be he got to one who could point him to the remedy that he needed in his life he departed from Philemon but what God did for him he was not just returning as the slave as a servant but oh my after this he was returning as they beloved brother he was returning as one who has been transformed by the same holy goes back to layman had experienced that transformation it was now apparent in Aneesa mice's life think about it this was roped here within this time and how that when you know Anissa Massoud returned no doubt the devil was trying to you know upon his mind and what are people gonna think and what is this going to be and what is that going to be but you see onesimus had already experienced the greatest act of redemption upon his soul he wasn't just hearing about the cross of Calvary out here listen this morning he wasn't just believing on Calvary but there had to come the effect of what Calvary paid the price for that it would be released into his heart in a personal revelation of Jesus Christ so he was not returning back from where he ran from under the same condemnation but he had a witness in his life that had been redeemed he came to the right place sometimes we we look at things and I think of the scripture that even when Paul would write this you know in Kalasha one of the last scriptures he would speak of Onesimus to the whole congregation and he would describe him as this a faithful beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done here Gorillaz friends I've preached this for years you can only live up to the depth of the sacrifice that's revealed to you personally if you've only lived to the depth of forgiveness and it's still things that turn your life you'll still have eyes of charge and other people come on somebody but to understand when you live to the when that depth of the sacrifice that that there is one that has atoned completely for my life I was included in that payment they've met one that has come that has brought a complete change and transformation in my life then you can look at others that there might be a situation that is bleak a situation then might is hopeless and even here that the molding and character has reset with brothers and sisters of lack precious faith yet we are looking at one another through the depth of Calvary sacrificial lamb it's important the right place that the Holy Ghost finds the right place in your life it's not enough just upon your flesh you can come here in this church oh I love the music oh I loved it I love the preaching or I love the atmosphere or I love but it's kind of no more than your flesh because you'll come here and you leave out the same way you say what are you talking about I'm talking about your heart it's got to go more than your spirit what's just your mind well you've got a right thinking about things that's all important it's all necessary but it's necessary that the Holy Ghost that he has the right place in your life you understand the Holy Ghost breeze a person to repentance a Holy Ghost brings the person into sanctification all of that is a work of the Lord and listen all of those are experiences of the Holy Ghost are you with me sometimes people wonder what happened to me when I felt what I sense what are this what are that but the reality this is where it comes down to this is why we rest our faith in the redemptive work that places us in the body of Jesus Christ Saint call all of that of a feeling you you might have felt this or felt that but when it comes down to is what is the effect after all that you said and done hallelujah this is Aroo bubbles message he was given the plumb line to measure up Jerusalem as their right measure it up to the standard of the world all of that is necessary how would a person know the Lord you could hear about it but God brings an experience to a person that they might seek him the Holy Ghost wants to ride away he wants to right place that is your inheritance once you think about this Aaron's rod was a dry dead rod it had been removed from a tree it was dead but there was a question that was called up there was a question in the vindication and God and now has them to put the rods in to the innermost part of the tablet not the first court there was no life not the second court but it was into the holiest of holies it took what was a dead branch and within 24 hours come on somebody they met victory don't take days different look how quick that this victory was within 24 hours it blossom and budded you see in look the blossoming the blooding the putting forth of almonds took place all in that time showing what that that place is the place of life it is the right place for the believer to dwell to where Christ himself his own life in you and I it produces the word through us what a comfort that is that comfort was in our life to know that we have passed from death unto life brother Samuel I don't see all things yet but you have you see and you have that resting within your hearts back there has been bass in my life amen Moses you know here he was called to replace and God is going to make himself known to Moses when Moses is asking the question you said you was going to send somebody with us who is this Lord who is he see Moses is asking God and God reveals himself his personage here God makes known and tells Moses Moses he said I you you cannot see my face he said but I will make my goodness and my mercy to pass before you and he told him he said come and stand by me there is a place by me he had to get in that place in the cleft of the rock in the place of safety and God put his hand there upon that when he was in the cleft of the rock and he passed by and he removed his hand and he saw behind her parts of a man he was in the right place but notice come by me Moses there's the place by me our place as believers our rightful place is heavenly places that's not something we earn or we merit that is our rightful position not one of the tribes in Israel not one of them could look at it and say well you know this land right here you know I'm gonna take this land it belongs to so-and-so but I'm gonna take it no sir it was a land that was given to them their newest all kinds of you know Canaanites and different ones that were around that land but brother they were not fighting for something that didn't belong to them they were fighting for what belong to them the fight with in them is because their inheritance had been ministered to them and so there was a faith within them the rose up to say this land this promise belongs to me and that's why even when God has so placed you in Christ that you look at all the promises that are around and within Christ every promise is yay and amen you are approaching those promises not with hope you promise them you approach of with faith - no he is faithful who promised he will perform and you are his son you are his daughter these promises belong to you these promises were made for you to take and inherit you're not a stranger you're a stranger in this world but this land of the Holy Ghost the revealed word of the hour this is our homeland [Applause] the Holy Ghost has said to the north give up my sons it said to the South give up my son's to the east to the west give up my sons and my daughters here was a woman here she is she comes to the well now she's coming at the time that she usually would come she's not able to come there just at any time her reputation her life that she's lived his one that would cause her only to come there at a certain time but little did she know that day she was in the right place she was coming to the right place the right man she was going to meet the right man this time here brother there with this appointment had already been made she was coming to the right place when she left that well she left there with a different testimony I hope you understand what I'm saying she didn't leave there with a pamphlet she didn't leave there with a track she met the Living God and when she went back into the city it wasn't days later it wasn't weeks later there was a witness that took place in her life when she went back in the city know that she came face to face with everybody who knew her past but rather there was a presence that accompanied her life as a daughter of God they had to give witness there is a in her life she got to the right place like a woman caught in adultery oh my you know what was going through her mind she being drugged pulled and they throw her down at the feet of Jesus I don't know I don't know what was going through her mind maybe she's waiting just for the first rock to hit first stone to hint but see there was one listen to me now they would stone it in the Old Testament they would remove that folly from the camp but there was one who was present that was able to lift and bring judgment by not removing from her and placing it back upon the one who made her do it in the first place there was a greater than song and there was a brother he was able to desert and know down beneath all this darkness of muck and mud there is a daughter of God down here he was able she had come to the house of God judgment was being married measured he was being lifted and put back on the accuser hallelujah woman were about users there's nothing more he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no what about the woman who came to Simon's house Simon the Pharisee had invited Jesus there to make fun of him once you think of this he invited him there to ridicule him Jesus went ahead and went even when he knew what was waiting on him he didn't go there for Simon he went there because one of his redeemable thoughts was gonna be there hey man there was an apartment there was a daughter of God that was gonna hear he's gonna be there and just as much as he persevered to be there she was gonna persevere she laid everything on the line she bought the right point meant and she was going to go there to ignite the Lord Jesus she didn't realize she was also being led to anoint him for his burial God was working all these parts out she was in the right place while they were making fun of him men saying if he knew what kind of a woman was touching him he knew but he also knew what was beneath the darkness in her life and he said daughter thy sins will they be many they are all forgiven I want you to think of that this morning a double L all-forgiving what about the man at the pool of siloam laid there he was 38 years old he had laid there for a long time he never could get to that pool somebody beat him to it but this day the one who sent the angel to trouble the water supernatural winner the same one who sent the angel who sent one angel after never in the same blood who sent the seven angels coddled somebody that st. wasn't descended down and he came right to where that man was at hey man that man needed deliverance they might not have seen like maybe much of a condition he could have lived a long life oh I hope you hear me this morning he could have lived a long life his disease was not a cancer or something like that he could have lived a long life but it just goes to show that the Lord Jesus does not want you walking under any little thing he came down and he brought us deliverance in that man's life he was in the right place how many times that he probably fought like a movie little closer I can move a little closer but God knew right where he was what about Joseph and Mary here they are they've already went through things that well Mary was almost you know put away and going to be stoned if it came out God reveals to Joseph so here they come and you know they've already now come through this part of it but now arrives as a decree every person must go back to their native province or or their their native land or country or city for taxation and census it's not convenient woman who is this far along it's not convenient this wasn't an air-conditioned Cadillac this wasn't come free you know leather seats with power recline and lumbar support she was gonna ride on a donkey it was not a comfortable time but you see God was getting them in the right place there was prophecy to be fulfilled and they had to be in that place in order for the prophecy to be fulfilled they did not know what was going on but God was getting them in place it shows it's not important that we know it's important that we're submissive in you [Applause] now I'm not gonna paint Joseph and Mary up to be some some eye idol Saints that well they never thought anything wrong they never and they never even said man this is rough man I don't understand what's going on let's be real they were humans just like you and I sons and daughters of God no doubt they'd complain just like you and I complain but the something deeper that I complained there's a lot of things that happened we don't understand here the king of globe is going to be born and they come to the town of Bethlehem and they come to a place naturally it would be natural to go to the inn hotel motel whatever you're going to go that and ask for a place to stay they were informed no vacancy no vacancy so they gave them barn stable out here now look at this we're coming up on a time of the year they have out the manger scenes but for many that's all it is we know he was not born in Christmas and on December 25th and I'm not here to preach on that this morning but what I'm trying to say is many times people glorify that and they failed to recognize that was a tiny here the Lord of glory the Messiah was coming among the Jews and they would reject him he found no place among them but there was going to be a Gentile bride one that was Val had no promise of covenants got no promise of adoption it was all hidden and sealed in everything Old Testament but he said I will come in a life that is filled with stench it's vile it's everything but I will come there he would come to the right place what about Elijah you know he's done pronounced judgment it's not going to do nor doing a rain gonna fall until I call for it God tells him I've got a I've got a place for you by the brook Sheriff don't worry about taking vittles with you I got it all come in larger you're not a lot to Kay believer you're a believer come on somebody you know like people I'm stocking up water and I'm strong we'll go ahead if you plan on being here for the tribulation you might need it but I'm not in preparation for the tribulation and preparation to leave this hallelujah the Bible says my God shall provide for all my needs according to his riches and glory delight thyself in the Lord and He will give me all the desires of the heart acknowledged the Lord in all thy ways and he shall direct thy path Lee's not gonna like you there the rest are in famine he's enjoying well whatever your favorite sandwiches he's enjoying the places because in this verse of scripture Elijah does not type the messenger he types the bride that bride that is hidden away in the Christ she's in the right place just listen judgment itself already is being poured out upon this world before God could ever bring that of judgment in the days of Noah the people had to get in the spirit and God brought judgment upon that but there was a man by the name of Noah he got in the spirit - but he was in the Holy Ghost then man he found himself a place of safety he was in the right place when the water started to fall hallelujah the Ravens were bringing in light you just what he had need up and when the brook dried up he told Elijah I got a word a woman down here I've commanded her to sustain thee nowhere in the scripture does it say that the Lord had spoke to the woman of Zahra pyth and let her know there's a man coming down here by the name of Elijah in this and that's gonna take place how did he command her she was afeard on the word she was standing upon the Word of God brother what did she recognize it was not the outward message of Elijah that she humbled herself till she humble herself to the revelation of the person of Christ being revealed in that hour she was not a worshipper of Elijah she was a worshipper of the same God that Elijah worshiped hallelu that's a relief anybody can recognize Elijah he could have pictures out there and they could say that's Elijah come on now I can read scriptures I can quote clothes but it's important to recognize Christ in the midst out the way doing the speaking not just enough well that's a quote that's a scripture that's a quote natural scripture anybody can read that anybody can quote that but it takes the person of Christ to make it real and bring it down personally in our lives that's who we want to recognize we don't want we do not want our eyes tied to the Vistage of a man we want our eyes our hearts tied to Christ she was in the right place she was fellowshiping with the Lord things got a little bare little slim in her house God knew about it see God had all that rearrange your I would have been biting her nails or you know putting posts on Facebook and everything we would have been doing something but we're believers aren't we man what about this what about this man who's robbed on the road and Jesus is talking about that of eternal life and love and he talks about a Levite the leave I saw this man laying on the side of the road and the Levite said I ain't gonna touch him if I touch him I'll be defiled he was already defiled I don't care how ceremonial he was he was already defied because his heart was defiled one who was guilty of what point in the law is guilty of it all if he wouldn't recognize his separation is based on the blood come on sure it was but here Jesus lets it be known here comes the here comes a Samaritan we know the story by the Good Samaritan this out of Luke 10 here comes this man now this man's got the Holy Ghost he's got a beast he's riding on he's got a power that's carrying him a man and there not a situation that can take this power from his life come on now beached him the Bible of beasts of burden his power he comes off of that beast and he goes over and he ministers to this man who is wounded I'll tell you sometimes the wounds are much deeper than what superficial wounds are outside here there's wounds that are deep within the spirit sometimes there's wounds that lay so deep within people even after God has done such a redemptive work in their life the enemy will try to bring that up in their memory it's a wound but let me just say this to you there's one who knows how to minister to your wounds no saying I may have a scar there but a scar is a sign of healing a scar is a witness there was a wound the heart here but now it has been healed there might have to been thread that'll hold that thing together until the cells that are directed to bring it all about and bring it back together but here there is sufficient to minister to that wound brother Brown called this this man he was identified as the Evangelist passing through and the Evangelist picks him up he he bonds up his wound first he pulls in oil and wine I love that don't you he had me he had the necessary essential oil in one frankincense it wasn't lavender it was the Holy Ghost hey man he had some essential oil of the Holy Ghost he had some wine so revelation brother that would give power to believe I can't be home that's what the ministering of the word does he does not take away from you it ministers to you what you really are you can rise in that He pours in the oil and wine and then he binds up the wounds and he puts him on his Beast and then he takes him to the inn and he told the innkeeper he said you take care of him and he said if there's anything else that's needed he gave him two pens is that right he gave him two pens to care for him the spirit and the word the spirit and the word he said you take care of him if there's anything he said that's needed more than that I will repay thee when I return he was there because God had brought him there and the same God that brought us here is the same God who ministers to our needs I just said to you this morning you don't have to keep packing around wounds don't walk around like well you know you don't know what I've been through and you don't know how I've been wronged and I'll you are remaining in that because you want to remain in it that is one who relieved [Music] [Applause] you've got a choice to make Calvary is not a pity party Calvary is a reality that releases lives there's a lot of horrible things that happen to people but there is a blood I don't care what Satan's lies there is a blood that patch power [Applause] what about John I'm telling my John the Beloved they're sitting around and Jesus said what is it to you if there be some that stand by which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God come with power those who were there did not understand what he was saying Jesus knew he was going to reveal the kingdom of God coming in power the outpouring of the Spirit of God from the offering up of the to atonement coming back upon the worshiper it would show John think of this now he would take job and here is John John's gonna be one and the Bible says that the saying went around this a man's not gonna die til he see the Lord come they didn't understand but you see Jesus already had said it because that's how it was going to be he was going to get John in position where John was supposed to be in order to see this of how this outpouring of the Holy Spirit after John was born of the Spirit of God notice John the Bible says I John in Revelations 1 am your brother and companion in tribulation I was on the Isle of Patmos for the testimony of Jesus Christ and that's the last time you heard about the Isle of palace matter of fact you can't find nothing out about it other than it was a snake-infested Island John don't ever mention it anymore I tell you friends the enemy would love to get you trapped in things of the past oh brother Sammy I've got over it no you still talk about it as though it was just yesterday and it's 25 50 years ago you still talk with the same hurt come on somebody it's understand week listen there's places in the world that much people feel it's not comfortable are you with me the Bible says that we are to forgive even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven us over and over in the scripture those are not comfortable comfortable promises to be fulfilled but they must be they must be they have to be fulfilled and it requires sometimes and it's not well this person is so wrong and this for so sometimes God allows people to do certain things to test and see how are we going to respond and even though they can be as wrong as wrong to be but our attitude can be wrong oh god help us John didn't realize the circumstances he was going to have to be in in order for these things to be revealed certain things in our life I guarantee we did not know we still don't know of things to come of places that we will have to be in in order for our character to be molded and fit for the throne wonder if we could have told jock John me this is this revelation is going to come to you it's gonna be a tremendous revelation but you're gonna have to watch where you step there's going to be scorpions snakes and everything else around it's called the Isle of Patmos wonder if John would have taken it but he was led there you said he was put there as an exile but notice he was led because he submitted to the Lord we wouldn't even have the back a book of revelations if every chapter John said remember me I'm in the Halep Atmos which I'll remember me I have such a terrible trial I'm in the Isle of Patmos chapter 2 Isle of Patmos chapter 3 Alabama's chapter 4 Alabama's chapter 5 Alabama's would you under read the book of Revelation your life and my life is a book those chapters you need to let these chapters and stop letting it become your book come on somebody I'm ready to pass from this chapter into another chapter I don't want to keep this chapter going let's transition let's make a transition Lord boy the testing trials in our lives this is something that came to lot to me as well you think of Joseph Joseph received dreams as a as a young man your brother and are going to bow to you seven the sheaves are gonna fall down Joseph went he told it remember even his father was looked at him a little bit strange Joseph didn't ask for that dream Joseph didn't ask for that position but that's who he was my goodness from the time God revealed it to the time he would set on the throne what he would have to go through this was necessary right here between the dream and the throne this was necessary for who Joseph there are things in our life that comes out of experience I told a person here even the other day we're talking about some things I said what I'm sharing with you is not from book knowledge it's from experience these things are shared are from experience in our lives Joseph would have to be loaded rejected rejected molded and shaped to think of it the prophetic eye in this hour would be able to look back down through there and see there was just a little bit of pride than Joseph's life and God would have to work that pride out of his life you and I would have looked in and said what's he doing in that jail what's he doing in that judgment he's in the right place God is molding and shaping him for the throne character is not a gift it's a victory the experiences in our life come from the molding of character we come here for the preaching of the word it touches our life but it does not mold our character it shapes our conscience it deals with a lot but what does it do it reveals and brings us into a yielding a submissive but it takes God molding character through tests trials and tribulation anybody want to sign up for some more I'll be honest with you I don't but he knows what I need so my rest and my faithfulness is even though there's things tests and trials hey let's be honest there's tests and trials let's come right now then when window and they come every time they count we look at it and say Lord Lord you know what's going on and yet down on the inside we know there's got to be testings and trials then it comes into that place of saying Lord just let me hold your hand Lord take me through the Lord Jesus take me through Lord I'm telling you we're in the right place for rapture the Bible said blessed are they who die in the Lord henceforth and forevermore those who are in Christ are a part of that first resurrection it's the right place for the rapture warious in Christ in Christ is the right place for the rapture I can say this without any flinching at all we have received the right message we have received the rat Holy Ghost [Applause] hallelu we have received as God hath sealed and the vindicated his world of promise in this hour by his own person through her to be the God we are in the right place for rapture we're in that safe place the Bible said by one spirit we are all baptized into one body then that brought into class we are in that place where Enoch walked he had a testimony before he was translated that he pleased God Enoch was in the right place walking with God he was in the right place at the right time we've been called back to the land of promise the church got out of the land of promise the church down through at times God would send a word but then here it would come right back into organization but there was a truth that stood in age after age after age but God here in keeping a promise of his word I think of the bones of Joseph as a memorial it was a memorial they walked by every day listen to me now it was a memorial that they walked by and it was a witness Joseph said we're going back to the land and he said when God visits you you take my bones back to the land in Burien what I let him know my bones here but there's the right place for my burial we're going back to that right place let me tell you something the very memorial of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ setting on the right hand of God or the throne of God it is the memorial that is the testimony that has he himself will come and receive a bride unto himself God at a church in the beginning that also was a memorial of that remember for the first age ever started there was the Alpha bride Amen where the Son of man was walking in phonus in their lives on the day of Pentecost they were in the right place amen and rushing mighty you in came down and have filled their vessels brother the Holy Ghost didn't get the wrong address he got the right address he didn't miss it and come to the Upper Room instead of the temple it was coming there was already a transition that had been made these were the temples he was coming to and the cloud was on in this hour come out of her my people come out of that organization that Roman that Roman Catholicism and control the demonic influence upon my people come out of her my people regulations 18 and be not a partaker of her place you know as well as I do the Bible said she had become a cage of every hateful and unclean and foul spirit I'll tell you that's not the Church of Jesus Christ that he claims for his own because the Church of Jesus Christ is where the breath is applied upon the doorpost and the Holy Spirit is there to lift and catch out every unclean and fast spirit hallelujah aren't you glad for that if I can just get rid of this let him lift it this morning we're in the right place I say you're in the right place this morning you might have come here and it might have just been Sunday morning and you had it all

he's still the same God that ministers oil and wine he bonds up the wounds he's the healer he's able to bring something from of his own self through your life that like Joseph could say regarding one of his boys he hath made me to forget all the toil and labor of my father's house it was a birth that caused him to forget he's still the same God this morning let's bow our heads I wonder how many maybe somebody here you want to be remembered in prayer this morning god bless those hands I want you to understand this this might been what I read on a fool in Philemon but this right here of onesimus this is you this is me God knows the need within your life maybe in your life it's for a complete healing in your life maybe in your life it's for healing maybe something in your spirit maybe
