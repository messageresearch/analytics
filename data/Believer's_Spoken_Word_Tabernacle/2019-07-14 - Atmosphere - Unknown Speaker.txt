let's turn if we could to Matthew chapter 9 I'm gonna just start and start right here on Matthew chapter 9 just brother Brian you can just pull that up if you don't mind I'm just gonna start here the notes are there but pull up Matthew 9 for them okay Matthew chapter 9 and I want to read here beginning at verse 18 is where I'd like to just start we'll get to this the Lord willing this morning while he's faked these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live so he's worshiping he's worshiping him and there's a request that he has and Jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of His garment for she said within herself if I may but touch His garment I shall behold but Jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour and when Jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose and the fame here of went abroad into all that land amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I just want to speak to you this morning and just so thankful to be together here once again amen to just feels like some time since I've been here and stood here and yet I've been here in in the services with you since last Sunday but I just so appreciate everything that the Lord has been doing and not just in our myths but how God has been moving among his people and it's not just something that we are witnessing here this is what is taking place around the world it's God it's not man it's God the things that we witnessed even when we were at a youth camp and gathered together there of just the presence of God just moving in such a supernatural way in the midst of those services crossed eyes coming straight under the preaching of the word Amen people hearing in their native language what was being spoken devil's being cast out young people being filled with the Holy Ghost and I just say it to you like this I would just be very very very clear with you the word that was ministered there from the very opening night all the way through and closing among of the young people that was there there was nothing at all that was watered-down it was things that was ministered the same things that you would hear has grown adults and you even wonder you look at that and you say well how that it's it's the Holy Spirit that gives understanding then I think God for this past this past weekend here Thursday we had the service here but the cadre brother Randy and the assembly came over and then we went over there was quite a bit of us were able to go over there on Friday night and it was just such a continuity from Thursday and then right into Friday and just so many different needs I even had a testimony that brother Randy even forwarded to me yesterday just an individual just as they were just coming up to to have prayer because we were each standing up there and they were just bringing and we were praying and as they were coming up for prayer he said I didn't make my request known because when I came to that place I just in my heart I believed that same angel of the Lord that stood by the Prophet was standing there so when I came the presence of God was so strong and said what was in my heart had already been the Lord is so good at me I really just appreciate me amen I love him I want to just there's a thought upon my heart here this morning and you see it there this is what I want to just just to speak on here just a few moments and see how the Lord will just take us and break his word to our hearts it's a very just one word it's a very simple word but it's a very it's a very powerful word and it's a very needed needed needed substance or needed thing in order for things that take place and that's atmosphere you realize that even when we you look at it even across the the planets that we we know was the planets nine planets and you know many of many things are spoken of even in the scriptures but there is one planet that is expressly spoken of and in terms with God in relation to redemption and how that God was actually going to bring and to restore and that's this earth and to think about it that within this earth that you and I live on one of the things that makes this earth habitable and to where it's not a habitable but you know remember to behalf of all others is that there is atmosphere around the earth and the atmosphere itself around the earth yet actually not only it allows life to be but even the atmosphere it is there and you know things that could be coming in to try to bring harm even to this earth because of the atmosphere it will not allow it to bring harm to this earth atmosphere is very important aim and atmosphere as we said it allows life and it also though also that atmosphere it prevents things from even reaching this earth many things that would try to come in to the earth when we look at the meteorites and different things like that as they're even coming in remember many of the things the fire and little thing you'll see it's because the atmosphere itself as it's coming through it actually consume it and it'll burn it up God remember the earth as the earth is a type of God bringing that back in redemption soul is that expressive and what God's desire is for our lives that there is an atmosphere about our life that is an atmosphere of life an atmosphere that when things would want to seek to come there is an atmosphere about our life that when thoughts when temptations when things can come it can come but as it comes to enter in through that atmosphere there is power there that actually is able to burn it up the Bible it sets it in the very opening the the very setting of this in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and the darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved up on the face of the waters you realize waters waters as also very much of a meaningful type throughout the scripture waters itself and will also Express of a thickness and multitudes of people when you really find a situation that is in chaos it's out of order but there's one that can bring order to chaos and that is the Lord himself and God sends forth his spirit to bring order and to bring things in to a condition that what he has already sown there in the earth by his word that those seeds can come forth so this so this this of the Spirit of God it moved upon the face of the waters and I'll say it just like this in this hour that you and I are living in when there is a congealing of waters there was a congealing of waters when the Lord Jesus walked upon this earth and to think of these waters of thickness and a multitude of people where everything itself would would just seem to be overwhelming but yet God in the midst of this hour by his Spirit would bring a people out of people and he would be a people that would actually be brought to him who in the midst of these waters in the midst of this situation of all confusion and all chaos but yet he comes on the scene and he brings order where there once was chaos what sets all of that in motion it's the Spirit of God moving according to the very desire of God itself you realize that even when we look at it in in in a service like this today you might you might be sitting here in need of healing you might be sitting here in need of deliverance you might be sitting here in need of salvation you might be sitting here in need of the Holy Ghost and to realize that before we can ever receive anything from God there must be an atmosphere that is created that is an atmosphere that will align with what the desire is in your heart and to understand before you could ever have that desire there already was a provision for that desire because me now God moving on the scene he works to bring everything in line so that there is an atmosphere now that we would step into then he can fulfill his word you know you cannot you know what brother Branham would say it many times he said we we cannot get into the last days without getting in the spirit of the last days now there's a capital S spirit meaning that of the Holy Spirit what God has promised by his word for the day in the hour that we live in and there's no way that you and I would know the promises that would even pertain or let me just say it like this we would not be alerted to the fulfillment of these promises because let me just say it to you very clearly there are men that have lived out and have been already that lived all the way down through even within the Scriptures even that have lived down through the ages where they themselves have looked at all of these events that would take place at the end time they would write of it they would express these things sometimes when you read the things they express if you read it and you read in the message you would say my goodness this was like a direct quote in this particular book that should not astonish you because the message in this hour that God has sent is not something new as far as outside of the scriptures but it is new to the ideas and to the thoughts of man because man's thoughts is the traditions of man but what God has done in this hour is not presented a new truth he himself the very person of truth has stepped forth in his fullness and gathered the loose ends of truth that has been scattered down through the ages so it takes the Spirit of God to move upon the promises of God and the people of God that pertain to that day and if not the Spirit of God moving you and I would miss it we would read over it now it wouldn't be that we wouldn't a man it but we would look at it and put it as though it's something that's way out in the future instead of realizing in order for promise to be fulfilled we must first enter into the spirit after all the Holy Spirit that is present to fulfill that promise so atmosphere is very important we have to enter into the right atmosphere and to recognize this when we look at it in the scriptures here we find here that you and I when we see the brooding of the Holy Spirit moving upon the earth here in the beginning it began to make love look how brother madam would describe it the Spirit of God here in Genesis 1 would begin to brood and he would make love to the earth it was it was brooding over it and cooing over that of the earth to bring about a change of condition it continued to brood and notice as it was brooding everything began to come forth that was already planted until now God moves into a place here in Genesis 1:26 through 28 where God broods forth now one in his own image in his own likeness I want to read this word to you because it's very important that we look here in the word because remember faith itself can only be based on the Word of God you cannot be healed unless you know it's God's will for you to be healed you must say faith only worships in the temple of God's Word verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness to see let us see God unfolding himself not multiple people let us make man in our image singular after our likeness singular and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion who notice once again and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth now remember this is not the physical man who would have the five senses this is dealing with that spirit man that one who is made in God's own image and God's own likeness so God here now notice the Dominion the the multiplying and replenishing it was not that which was was was left to better the physical man but remember it is God's desire that it would be the spiritual man that has the Dominion and truly that is really our victory is when the inner man himself has the dominion over the outer man you realize that the Lord Jesus himself coming into a body that he created body in the likeness of sinful flesh and now here the very god that what took place in genesis now is made manifest through the life of the Lord Jesus what Adam fell from now we see it restored in that of the second Adam where here you have a man that is in perfect harmony and continuity with God well here God is dwelling on the inside the image of God is veiled in that of the form of a servant and we find here that that within it this was God's desire you see listen it was never remember what Jesus said he said the son can do nothing is that right he will he was separating that it is not by the five senses but it is that inside man that that image of God on the inside that can only be brought forth by God Himself her mother and father cannot bring forward this inside man they bring forth this inside man it has to be the second Adam it has to be the Lord Jesus Christ through him by the new birth and church can't come on somebody nah man cannot do this Jesus expressly expressly stated this in John one that you and I as sons and daughters of God are not born in the will of man neither a flesh and neither that you know a blood but it is that which we are born of God and that's why we must be born again so when we are born again then now that spiritual image on the inside the seed was only the potential of what was to be made manifest in our life something appear when when when you have a seed and you plant it in the ground you you are expecting there to be a crop that will come out of that see when you plant one seed you do not get one seed you get multiple seeds are you listening that's exactly the same way that it comes in our line you take a promise of God in your life and that promise of God comes to fruition by the Holy Spirit you do not receive one seed but you actually is a multiplying of that promise and you eat of the promise and you also sew back on what has come from God and moved into your life see this is God's it since God's whole economy it's moving within our lives so to see God would desire and and has made us to be if I can say a mature creatives it is not you and I that can create things men can only work man can only take things from what has already been here and make it but God has ordained that we would be or immature creators now you know brother branham were gone and say it like this he says in the last part of divine love he says and when divine love is in your heart there's a difference in your life and everybody knows it you live like a Christian you act like a Christian you walk like a Christian and your whole system is kind to God's violent your whole system is timed to God's Bible now let's look here in James chapter 3 give me some more monitors here James chapter 3 and I want to read let's read these verses scripture here I want you to catch this there is earthly wisdom and there is heavenly wisdom what we would turn them as sometimes with earthly wisdom we can say wisdom we can say knowledge but here we're over here for heavenly wisdom we can say that of heavenly wisdom understanding that has come and we can say a revelation because faith is a revelation it comes down to faith so when we're looking at these two parts let me just simply call it wisdom versus faith God had already set forth in the beginning that his children would be under the atmosphere of the word are you with me he already set forth they would be under the atmosphere of the word but yet there are things that God did not unfold on how that all of this was going to come to pass but Satan he comes through a tool through that of the serpent and he begins to bring in and try to bring in another atmosphere if Eve would have stayed with the atmosphere of the word it would have quench every fiery dart every word that he wanted to quote and twist around it would have winch every temptation all that came around because why there was an atmosphere which sometimes we know it to be the law of the word the protection that she was in she was safe in the tabernacle of God she was dwelling there but remember she was made to go out she went out there was an atmosphere I want you to catch this she received another word and when she received that word in the womb of her mind it started everything going and it began to create another atmosphere about her life that was not an atmosphere faith but it was an atmosphere of unbelief in God's Word and this is where you and I stand every day there is battle grounds every day there's times where we've lost battles because we entertained the wrong thoughts but this is where now the Spirit of God it comes back it makes you know the restitution it brings advocacy there's a restoring back it's a turning of our heart and what's he doing he's also going to make us aware of the strength of the atmosphere that we are living in and are a part of that this atmosphere if you will just trust it not what you feel but if you'll trust the atmosphere of the word it will quench every fiery guard of the enemy every meteorite that he tries to send your way and try to make an impression or an impact on your life if we can just stay in that atmosphere then we live in victory this is the battle the battle is atmospheres so now look at this in James 3 verse 13 because both of these wisdom and faith there's an atmosphere balance there's an atmosphere knowledge itself just knowledge has an atmosphere now I want you to look at this in verse 13 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you their knowledge itself that we read about here is talking about Holy Ghost knowledge you said why I just got faith I don't need knowledge no you need in order to have faith you need knowledge but not knowledge just here you must listen you must your faith can only rest in the Word of God you have to have an understanding in the Word of God that don't mean you have to be smart it's just that this in' that's why there has to be word that's ministered that is fit for the season and the hour that pertains to your life and it pertains to the broad the desire that God has for our lives let me just drop back and preach a moment you see God when he sent the message to you and I it is the message of his second coming and it is announcing not because the people of God have been looking for the coming of the Lord for 2,000 years they have been waiting with anticipation but brother the message never come just so that we're out here looking for the second coming of the Lord but it comes with ajust as the atonement does it comes there to minister to all of the needs that we have in this journey it came to minister to our soul in ministers to our spirit in ministers to our flesh it gives direction in our life for how that we are to live and conduct ourselves while we are living and waiting with expectation in the coming of the Lord you say you say brother Samuel what are you saying well in a nutshell this is what I'm saying this is just B let me put a little - this is just brother Sanders cliff notes ok cliff notes for dummies and I'm the biggest one right here it just is simply this that man shall not live by mysteries alone but by every word of God that is revealed in this hour you understand God has come to make his word known and to direct you and I because you know what mysteries how we thank God for them we believe in that we preach that but you also have to be able to put your shoe leather on the ground and walk you also have to be advised on how to fact the devil you also have to be advised on all of his cunning ways you see Paul having the great revelation that he had did not dismiss that Paul did not say now you've been Revelator you've been shuttle the Spirit of God you got everything covered you don't need anything at all you don't need no more teaching you don't need no more instruction quite the contrary Paul labored by the Spirit of God to give direction to the people of God that they might remain in the right atmosphere of the word I'm glad that God is mindful of that aren't you now notice this here it creates an atmosphere now James 3:13 who is the last man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom so he's been endowed with understanding let him show out of his conduct his behavior this endowment with a meekness a gentleness of this wisdom see this is what this kind of wisdom does but if ye have bitter envying and strife where at in your hearts so this is the key part of even where Satan wants to get to and bring about a change in an atmosphere so this is where the Spirit of God is dealing not you you know let me just say it like this you know as a sister you know you might sit here and say well you know the Bible just said if a man being dude remember when it's referring to this of man right here it's not just referring to that of the male gender but it is expressly speaking of mankind it is dealing with because on the inside of you has has a beloved bride of Jesus Christ you know who is veiled inside of our heart is what Peter calls the hidden man of the heart so in its speaking to you and I we realize as the bride of Jesus Christ we are the moon that is to reflect the Sun so who is to be reflected in our life is the man Christ Jesus our bridegroom is to be the one that's reflected in our life when they arrested Peter and John and James what did they say they said they're ignorant unlearned outside man by their speaking but they took knowledge they had been with Jesus the inner man now had come forth and was expressing on the outside so notice but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and line not against the truth now when we look at this the Bible let me just let me just keep moving here the wisdom this wisdom this wisdom notice James is bringing a distinction this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual and devilish he's crazy he's he's letting this be known now notice for we're in being and strife is this is what this kind of atmosphere produces in being and strife that's jealousy and that of a practitioner at one that seeks to promote oneself one's idea here's the result various confusion and every evil work so you realize Babylon was a physical location Babylon became a spiritual manifestation Mystery Babylon but you realize that what Babylon itself means is Babel it means confusion it's Satan's design now what was it Babel confusion because God confounded their language they didn't understand what one another were speaking so they went their opposite ways but the Holy Spirit now we might speak different languages we might speak different tongues you might have a hard time understanding me in our natural dialect and I might have a hard time understanding you but in the Holy Spirit we have a perfect understanding by the revealed word of this of who Jesus Christ is so that's where our rest is that we might have you know this opinion or I might think this or you feel this way but that's not what's holding us together what it is that's holding us together is that of the revelation of Jesus Christ there's a greater atmosphere in our life that we are living under this atmosphere and believing and waiting for God to fulfill every promise Oh glory but the wisdom now here of James brings a difference but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle easy to be intreated full of mercy good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy if we can receive this what James is saying you can be bombarded with atmospheres but this is how you discern where is this wisdom coming from now I know and we're not just talking about things of the world but remember what James is dealing with here that there is envy and strife among the people and it's not allowing the Word of God to have free course and he's letting him know hey it ain't out here in ain't your brother it ain't your sister you've got to get the remedy down on your heart sometimes your heart gets out of sync and you've got to plug it up to God's great computer and say sink me Lord I'm all out of sorts I need an update I need a retelling of the Holy Ghost in my life Lord matter of fact I pray to God we just don't wait til we feel so low until we realize we've been entertaining the wrong things I pray to God that we realize each and every day I need to be plugged into the main source I need to be checking for updates frequently because with those updates it comes security fixes because in God there is no breaching of God's atmosphere it's only when we are not up-to-date and living in the atmosphere of God like we ought to live so he's bringing this discernment they were trying wisdom as it's coming in this is the atmosphere that it brings Lawrence said both of these wisdom and faith create an atmosphere he said you go into a church he said the pastor snail the pastor done I don't believe they don't mean that the pastor he don't get out from behind the pulpit that's not what he's talking about he's talking about stale in that it has no life he does not believe in the promises of God he does not believe that God still heals God still moves does not believe in the real baptism of the Holy Ghost but he says it'll create an atmosphere in that church he said but then you go to another assembly and he said when you go in there if faith itself has been preached that word will create an atmosphere you you understand the word creates the atmosphere Amen I just don't want earthly wisdom you might say earthly wisdom you mean you could sit in a church let me bring it down hold a message church and simply wisdom we don't want just wisdom like that we desire divine revelation and if God has made a promise in his word and we can take that promise and say Lord I know you're speaking to me I know that this is for my life right now Lord God let it become real inside of me because this knowledge that we're talking about it's not like what the Greeks say that just because they know it up here they know it but we're talking about knowledge according to how the Jews look at knowledge and the Jews do not believe you can say you know something until it has absolutely been an experience in your life I believe that's one of the areas that we fall short on so much we look at the word we understand oh my I understand this I see this but it ought to be that the things that God is opening on that knowledge of the Holy Ghost it ought to make you and I aware of what belongs to us and what we in our lives must say Lord let this be an experience in my life too many times we live below our privileges but notice here's the effect of this wisdom coming out and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so here there is a sowing when this takes place there for sowing either way but we want to be that of sowing fruits of righteousness because within that seed the seed itself it has within it the power to transform itself or become what so ever is in that seed now remember with this wisdom it brings peace it brings peace it brings sadness even in chaos yes because this guy and even in the spirit realm can be experiencing chaos he can be in being bombarded and you let it in there and they call some fear can rise and all sorts of things but the inside man himself when it's been born of the Spirit of God that on the inside it knows no fear it knows no defeat whatsoever and we can get that inside man just allow him to have control on the outside he will run things out then our flesh would want to try to present to us through and by how the enemy would anoint us with an atmosphere and try to make us calls or look at things as though it's more real oh this this very thing right here but if we can come back to that and say Lord but your word is true and they can say well look at all this and look at all that you can stand like Juna and there can be an atmosphere about your life and you say this is a nothing but lying venez amen this is why you know brother man would tell us he said as long as says there's a argument an argumentative atmosphere there's nothing God can do what can do that whether it's a church whether it's a home with us on your job wherever it's at now remember let's apply the word applying the word is it hopeless Cup I'm going to pray for it no no remember where this is at heart first don't you have to understand the Holy Spirit brings discernment to discern our hearts first you might be wanting to see the physical joining you might be wanting to have the nice words and conversations and enjoying fellowship and everything else but unless it is down in the heart first this out here it'll just stay that way it'll go right back to it it's got to be the heart itself first that's a line to the Word of God on a daughter to restore to you any piece that them over this they're very ugly acting and causing trouble you'll never be able to have a revival as long as that kind of an atmosphere is around the sometimes it's not only things that you see out here in the circus set it is then let's be scriptural about it we need to go to the person and say you know what I've got a problem and not saying you're the problem but just identify I've got a problem you see many times we go to identify things but we come with our craftsman riches and everything is we've already got a diagnose know they need a 9/16 and they need now they're gonna need a Phillips on this one right here they need an adjustment on their attitude right here oh yeah I'm gonna need that Dewalt I'm gonna need to find bits I might need a compact driver to get this into them hello somebody you see we're always diagnosing but realize realize before that can ever be right down here right down here you see you're trying to change it on your own you can't change it on your own I can't make this a healing service on my own as much as I want to see deliverance people feel what the Holy Ghost people delivered safe every time I minister but I cannot make that happen that's up to him and up to us together so here you see God in His mercy now look at this in Colossians chapter 3 let's read this here verse 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved boughs of Mercy kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering you tell me that your flesh has this and you know I'm going to tell you you're alive now I know some of us have a little bit more of a maybe a leeway than other people have hello some of us seem to be maybe a little bit morning we're a little bit quicker than others don't go classifying people based on that this is not the classification are you understanding me now he said put on as the elect of God this word put all means to sink into it lets us know there's an atmosphere to tap into a boasts and I'm born again as the son of the son and daughter of God this is the access friends you know one thing that has become more real to me here over the past weeks and months let me just tell you great big secret I need a refilling of the Holy Ghost every day I have realized I have realized the effects of being filled and refilled and refilled and filled and refilled how what kind of effects I've noticed how I look at problems I don't look at in the same way it don't mean that I put up my eyes and say old problems don't exist we've got a perfect Church bearing no spirits in my church that's a lot there is always going to be spirits and things that have to be dealt with but it's how we're looking at it Amen it's how we're looking at situations what affects this the atmosphere this is where the pudding on it isn't just oh yeah I need to be forgiven oh let me see oh yeah here's yeah there we go f o RG forgiven I need to go forgive brother take rest you know any I need to go and ain't like that in sinking into something it means you got to get out of something and get into something it ain't gonna be just picking up a jacket where I'm gonna pick up meekness right now know all these work together if Jesus Christ is Savior deliver Redeemer everything all together then this access brother it has what we have need of atmosphere atmosphere somebody say atmosphere verse 13 for bearing one another Oh Lord forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave unison told my church discipline these scriptures are not talking about church discipline this is talking about living as sons and daughters of God with one another church discipline has its own scriptures of how forgiveness is extended and restored are you with me let's be let's be scripture on this and let's stand in the Word of God and let's not let confusion try to take our minds you see because there's gonna be things in ought to me there's things that will come up and we ought to be able to forgive be able to look past what someone has done well I don't agree with them well so what do you know their heart do you know their heart if any man has a quarrel against any I don't I don't see Facebook I don't see posted on Facebook you know meant all these things on Twitter but just don't mention their name of course because you're calling names that don't say that in my version does that say that in yours no because that's not of God you see that's an atmosphere and you're creating an atmosphere and let me just say like for those of you that will read that junk there's an atmosphere that comes into your home and then when you side with people who side against or you are taking in an atmosphere against the word you need to stand with the word well I don't see this I don't understand this Eve didn't see it Eve didn't understand it but if she would have stood under the word she would have been under the atmosphere of the word and that is protection if she could have just simply told the devil listen the serpent was somebody she went to church with y'all gonna be able to take this the circle was not what are you I never seen you before who are you no no this was someone she had contact with but you see what happened here Satan used that he used that Satan didn't even care about the serpent I hope you hearing me he did not care that creation that God had created as an upright beast it was only a fool that he could use Satan doesn't care if he can use your Facebook your Twitter your mouth my mouth he don't care he'll use it as a to what to create an atmosphere menaces will got the atmosphere accomplished that I wanted to accomplish now there's confusion hahaha this is my kind of dwelling at a mine at a man I don't like confusion oh but notice here and above all these things put on charity oh my now wait a minute we put on all of this right here but now above all these things put on charity help me understand isn't the Holy Ghost the love of God sure God is love right the love of God in our life but how to have this over the love of God in my soul then why is he telling me above everything else put on charity because it's got to begin on the inside in our life before it ever becomes manifested as an outward expression it's got to be here on the inside before it can ever be manifested on the outside that's why the dying if there's things that you can look at that you're praying about in your life relationships hear me now that you're praying about listen friends don't go trying to repair relationships on your own let your heart be repaired to God because they listen no matter who you are who you are I don't care if you're the most spiritual person that you think you are when you are wronged and somebody says something against you I don't care if it's a boss I don't care if it's in your house I don't care if it's on the job if it's in church it doesn't matter your flesh is going to stay you know why because you're fresh ain't born again your spirit ain't born again but it's the inside man who is born again when God filled you with the Holy Ghost he could have gave you your theophany for your human spirit he could have changed this flesh to a glorified body but he says no I'm start with the inside I'll get the inside man right and he'll take dominion over this little piece of earth and I will manifest redemption through him by the power of bringing this in subjection and obedience to the Word of God because the word is the man Christ Jesus above all these things put on charity though I can tell you what it's just putting the devil on the run you know because the devil likes to try to put these things over on you well if you were this and you were this you would have this and you would have this they know what is I'm there I have access to this charity but in having access to it I've got to put it on and that don't mean put on that means put on that means sink in to sink in to sink in to so it means you got to get in to something atmospheres that are battling that are trying to pull you here and there but you got to sink into that atmosphere how do I get into that atmosphere lord I need to lover this hole so lord I need to let my wife Laura lein in Omaha Lord I need a love on it and I know you're trying to do that on your own but you need to say Lord let my heart Lord be right in this situation I know what your word says I'm the son of God I'm a daughter of God Lord I'm asking you to help me oh then you're inviting the atmosphere the Spirit of God can begin to descend and which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God be the umpire that's what this word rule means let it be the umpire in your heart well here we go this hidden man here he is I'll tell your Lord that right there that they sent that was an inside corner he had caught the right-hand corner of that strike zone Lord I didn't you know it was a strike I know it was a strike thoughts it was a ball not just you know that they meant that with me in mind God said let it pass I know they were striking at me I know they were this I know where were that but the catcher the pitcher the batter you don't have to say and if you want to try to interact with the umpire he can throw you out out of here I ain't kicking you out of the body you understand what happens the Gov just flutters away the dev just flutters away because you're not willing to listen to the umpire which the umpire is the absolute it's the peace of God it is the revelation of Jesus Christ in our hearts and there's been times that we've argued with the umpire all of us let me just make sure nobody hiding up here from the back wall all the way out there and if somebody's hiding and they're sitting at their computer at home it's you too and we've had noted the Bible says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption don't don't get that atmosphere don't let it remove from your life but invited in and listen let's just be honest we know and we're wrong oh yeah we know when we're wrong what happens all we're trying to bring Dominion into this time lord I but you know what the only way you bring Dominion is by submission say to the Lord forgive me my own stubbornness Lord mouthed folson at this old stinking flesh Lord but father your word is right I was wrong in my ideas if it's not Lord God your thought it's wrong I don't care how real it seems it's wrong oh that's when we're standing his sons and daughters of God identifying wisdom identifying atmospheres let me just try to wrap this up here and find a place after which you are also called in one body and be you thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom which has been spoken you remember Jesus said in John 15 we want to bear fruit of him right he said if ye abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done Lord I'd like to have a boat with twin cams I'd love to have Lord God a package of them expandable broads no no no your your your honor you're not letting a word of Christ dwell in you I'm not saying listen friends I'm not saying that we don't have needs in our life you understand what I'm saying what I'm saying is is that notice when God deposits is a word here we are dwelling in him are our desires it is about him we want to see more of him we want to see more of his life in us sometimes we we allow the devil to steal so many things from his Lord I want to see more of you I want to see more of your mana I want to see more of you my life and and you don't we don't take the things that have been ministered pray over and really pray over them and really give ourselves you know to the Word of God I'm not just talking about sitting down and formally reading it I'm not just talking about just setting you know just listening to a message and and I'm not just talking about just feeling about just just praying just little prayers but I mean enter in what God is expressing to you and I it's an atmosphere of that word I'll tell you brother and sister when I leave here in these services that atmosphere does not leave right here when I'm at this pulpit as a matter of fact the atmosphere many times then as right here when I'm ministering is the same atmosphere that is there when God delivers the thought on my heart let me just tell you right now before this right here would drop in every earlier in the week just that thought was permeating in my heart on atmosphere I said Lord what do you want me to speak on here I've got one service before brother oil comes in what is it then Lord that you would have me to speak on because there's other things that are just waiting in the docket to be exposing but you know what it is it's God what do we have need of with in this moment in this time in our life what's waiting my wait for years I don't know that's in his hands let the word of Christ dwell in you richly you know if this means to dwell it means let it be the influence let it be the influence you know let it be the atmosphere in our life give ourselves to it don't just don't just take you and listen to you know don't just take in victory here this morning and then when you go out of here where all my victory may be caught there and he's meeting your needs even right now and maybe there's things that will pray over I don't know God knows but this said when you leave out of here don't just leave out of here and say oh my what victory you're gonna have to maintain that victory that victory is going to be tested but remember the same God that brought it to you is the same God that goes with you to see that it's kept what do I do if I prayed for here today I've got sickness and my body what I do live in the atmosphere of the word look at the promises of God concerning healing it is God's will for you to be healed if I was sick in my body I would read the promises of God that pertain to healing well listen I don't know where all of them are located hey you can start with Isaiah 53 you can start with Isaiah 53 you can start right there you can pray over that that will give you enough for weeks then you begin you begin from there and you watch how the Holy Spirit won't even build from there through the Book of Psalms my Lord David through the Psalms David is being healed in his physical body David is being healed in his mind David is being healed in his spirit even at times when David so he would be so troubled he would say so take courage in the Lord filled with promises of healing healing it's the children's bread and it belongs to you my brother my sister let it dwell in us Rick should live under that hat mysteri of the word let's finish this here stop teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs how can this how can this be because it's got to be a song in here you know God gives you songs to sing God will give you a song to sing that'll pertain to the experience and the season you're in now it may not be altogether a new song but it's a new song on a hue far away let's say me that's an old song oh but when you have an experience in your life that you need to go to Calvary it's a new song see you're not singing it under old traditions and old forms I know then that stanza I know them that's line oh it's experience it's not routine this is my life this is my need right now amen any tries to make me down I mean I do but my sins are gone you don't matter if you know all the words you're singing there's a message in that song where is it a pleasant atmosphere going on and what is it singing precedes the world B port battle before battle they don't just walk out brother Dave and say I'll tell you what the Sifl or here that's it the Lord here does say the Lord it now singing singing goes before the world so you can see this is victory in our life it's creating an atmosphere an atmosphere of woosh that's what singing is about singing is not about I can hit the right note you can hit the right note no singing is about we think of all that but singing is about us worshiping under the revelation of who he is to me begin to enter into that in our hearts my brother Brad I'm walking down through Memphis let me just remind you just the case he's a white man in Memphis I hope I didn't offend nobody cuz y'all know me real well but here he is you see I've heard stories about Memphis and in these stories for white people I heard stories from from black people who said I wouldn't go down in Memphis now I don't know no doubt there's good brothers and sisters down in Memphis to st. listen friends there's rotten things all around there's rotten white people there's rotten Puerto Ricans there's rotten Mexicans there's rottenness there's rotten all around but God's children oh brother and sister and their son they don't even know they're God's children but you see what happened in a time when it was so separate separated segregated tensions were so hot Oh God are you gonna hear me now tensions were high if he would have been thinking in his mind he would not have went down there one day brother Ram had something against against the black people but sure as I hold my tensions are high how better not be going there how better not be doing this but you see he was being led by the Spirit of God there was another atmosphere as he went down the street he was singing one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them you know that song pertains to it is sons and daughters of God that have been born of that same Pentecostal experience that they had in the upper room he was singing about the authority that he had as a son and daughter of God he created an atmosphere and when he got there that blessed sister was standing there she was right on the gate she was already in an atmosphere this is the Bible brother she was that I am that shooter my man hello I am her I'm just asking West God's Elijah cuz if I'm that Sunna mine there's a little I just sent to me whether she was in that atmosphere her son had a need in his party it was a need in their home and she knew that the relationship was not right between him and the Lord so you know what she did she entered into an atmosphere of prayer prayer brought an inspiration that I am that you know my woman and she saw a vision that Elijah was going to come you know what that atmosphere did it had him leaning on the fence good morning parson how'd you know I was a person I saw you coming before God already showed me now contrary to our thinking to her the atmosphere she was in he was finished she once said in his hand you know God said something his word and I read this story you know about shippment woman that Norfolk could I just didn't you know I and I read this other stroke no no I don't know if she I don't know if it had been preached within weeks I don't know why it was but I know I think she was connected with that promise and she said this promise is me for my situation right now God gave me this boy come on somebody she lookit hit daddy won the round I don't know what happened to him but she was not looking at any of the conditions maybe he was born out of wedlock maybe it was this maybe that now how about that faith will not entertain hindrance as it was one thing this is my son this is my boy and the promise belongs to me that God will send His Word and raise my child up well it was an atmosphere about her life you know what kind of atmosphere was an atmosphere of life oh no doubt Satan was sending his meteorites into her you know you stay out here in the cool night air and you get that nasaan you you could actually get more sick you know and your sinuses could flare up and this and that every time there meteorites was coming in there was an atmosphere satan could say then you know who your black paint know what may gonna come down here come on somebody let's just speak your prayer let's just speak your plane but you see what there are lives and hearts of God touch color in ain't about color we're seeing the sons and daughters of God God has a bride that's made up of many Kindred's nations that comes that's the atmosphere of the world I'm telling you that's why the rebellion in the world in this hour because the atmosphere of the revealed world it brings unity it brings different nationalities cultures ethnicities it brings it together in the body of Jesus Christ it's a war but blessed be the name of the Lord the lamb has prevailed [Applause] no you howl alone if they would take that and put that as a bill sign that into place then it would be Jesus said all lives matter don't get offended on me now but Jesus would say I'm come that you might have life and have it more abundantly but you see what Satan wants to do is bring confusion in the strife hatred dissimulation in the emulations that Satan's working but the working of God brings harmony brings unity brings brotherhood sisterhood where was a I've been gone from here a long time ago go ahead closing have already been gone I knew you'd come she identifies herself you ever heard of me nope well now I'm william branham I pray for the sick never heard of you see she wasn't honoring him by any reputation rather this one was not just somebody who knew about books and tapes and could read this is somebody who knew that God still moves she knew that the Holy Ghost still moves still walks in scandal he walks in fresh you see what kind of atmosphere she was in it was an atmosphere of life so they go in the house they get in the house the brand said I've been in King's palaces been in many fine places he said but I never what was it it was a presence of God it was the atmosphere that had already been created in the home the atmosphere that Jesus didn't have to put nobody out he could just stem here now I'm not going to get into that of gyruss as we just won't get to it but you see the atmosphere that we live it's important she began to pray but then said I knew I know she talked to him before I could tell how she talked to her man God don't want fancy talk he just wants to hear from you well I have a hope I get the text right he just wants to hear from you he dislikes hearing from you he don't have a gray little bubble when your text shows up without an image it's your face it pops up that's the one in my book I knew I knew they would they would come into the manifestation sooner or later you all hold on I got to take this test right now I've got to respond to this right now and it might just be a Texas says appreciate you I thank you Lord government for your mercy thank you Lord God that you would even give me an order vision for this ditty thank you Lord for providing for me you see what it is you're worshiping by the revelation of who he is to you and it begins to create an atmosphere that he can move into you see it's our faith in Him that'll create an atmosphere but our faith it creates the atmosphere that his faith moves down and doesn't work and does the work you know the end of a story with it some of you may not brother branham met that boy met him getting on a train parson parson he said you remember me no no I was that boy he was out on some waters two words dark dark but as they kept on breaking mama didn't like what is it the Spirit of God was moving upon the waters atmosphere was being changed you had a son of God and you had a daughter of God mama don't you let the devil try to put you down let me tell you something you stand as a daughter of God and you're praying right there remember as a daughter of God you have access with God because the same the same man Christ Jesus that is on the inside of your husband is the same one who's on the inside of you say Lord is close let's just close nor help me to live in that atmosphere to realize you're an amateur creator I'm an amateur creator every situation there'll be things maybe right now maybe right now you need a a change of atmosphere and the Holy Spirit's been speaking to your heart this morning perhaps tomorrow there'll be things were tested maybe tomorrow Tuesday but you see it's live in that atmosphere that's your privilege that's your privilege my privilege to live in that atmosphere one of the clearest signs you know when we're not living where that is one of the clearest indicators how many of you like indicators that let you know because when we start getting a little bit of a feeling that just isn't right brother Samuel that's my flesh I know I know my mind battles me too so so what do we do about it that's the time you say I need to take a trip so what do you do you did get on your garments of humility your priestly garments and you say Lord there's some fruits that I know need to come out of my life I can't make it happen but you caused almonds to come out of a branch you're the same one who brought life inside of me and your life coming forth through me know what I'm standing here as your son as your daughter and I'm gonna stay here in this atmosphere I may be IVA let the cares of life pull me out of it maybe I've let failures things where I've let meteorites and meteorites has struck in my service and I'm just living under the impact of meteorites the Lord I'm walking back into your presence because there's more meteorites it's going to come but you are my Savior you're a moderate Deemer your mind [Music] fear you're on and on and on he is the spheres around our life so no matter where it is that you're at maybe in your life you've never moved into that place to where that hidden man has come down there maybe you've never surrendered but you know where I'm at no matter where you're at this morning he can do for you what you need done in your life he can he can bring you strength oh no I know you may not be able to get get that crater mark out you can't get it out the crater mark but what you can do is let that crater mark that scar become a testimony of God's healing power God might take the scar upon your life and say see my healing power was greater than any scar any wound it was greater and he restores the atmosphere well what does that mother said no faith you approach him by faith this is where God calls you Lord Jesus you're the same yesterday today and forever you've never changed your father as we Lord come into this moment we are mindful Lord that in our lives that this atmosphere is so important Lord so many times what I pray myself included in this prayer so many times the Lord we live below our privileges there's victories we can see in our life father you know what our needs are this morning so Lord as you brought your word your word you would you would send it the Bible says you sent your word to heal your people healing itself Lord God would begin first even recognizing there's healing Lord God you come Lord to heal soul heal the spirit heal the body but I don't know what what the needs are better throughout the assembly there's might be needs more that some that I could be aware of but Lord I'm not aware Lord that there can be other needs that could be here but father we want to Lord God move by faith this morning we want to walk into that place as we moved from the outer court into the inner court Lord God speaking to you then we moved to that innermost place of rest or maybe it's relationships husband wife the family maybe it's between Lord families maybe it's Lord on the job Lord you know but Lord as we come into that place of rest we come they're not as beggars we come there as sons and daughters of God every time Lord we've ever been defeated it's when we got out of that every time when we got away we got out from under living there your God from that of the Chicano or daily in our lives as Paul said we got to die daily our God we repent daily or Jesus whistles Oh God may every Lord atmosphere of doubt and unbelief and fear Lord Grodd I'll take the authority by the Holy Ghost in your word under the shed blood of the Lamb as a son of God commissioned by you I take authority Lord God over every unclean spirit over every spirit of condemnation fear doubt and unbelief [Music] Satan you can't remain here any more when the children of God had been touched by his presence and from their heart they're Paul SATA yes Lord move Lord move Satan take your hands off in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've already been defeated the atmosphere in this building it's not the atmosphere of a man physical man but it's the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ the omnipotent God the omnipresent one omniscient [Music] I wonder if we just couldn't say Lord raise our hands Lord I want to take a trip into the holiest of Holies let's say brother said no I've got the Holy Ghost set that's not all together when I'm talking about but I'm talking about coming back in bringing your thoughts bringing their of your emotions our feelings I'm gonna take it in to the Holy stories and I know that what I have need of that my god supplies and want to sink into that atmosphere [Music] changing of me I want you to think of this as your hands are up the prophet of God when he would express concerning the final pole and final change of his ministry he told Leo and Jean he said I want you to write this down on a paper and I want you to put it up in that office the trailer and that is that the final pool the final change in the ministry will not be so much a change in the ministry as it will be a change in me how about it this morning say Lord a change in me a change in me you have access to this this morning as a son and daughter of God if you don't know the Lord all you can know him this morning you can surrender your heart to him you might have walked in here not knowing you're a son and daughter of God but you can walk out of here this morning with the realization that your sin bare the Lord Jesus Christ he's already he's already paid the price that you could walk out of here free he can feel you with that newness of life that satisfaction on the inside that she'll never find from any of the pleasures of the world see God will not take altogether there's certain desires that could be in your natural life that those desires themselves are not desires that God would take from you but he'll simply put them in the right place desire to be married that's not a wrong desire sometimes it's turned in a worldly not the desire to marry but the term lust itself God does not removed the desire to be married the husband in a while but Satan would try to provoke that desire and that's what we would know it's lust but the holy ghost can move down and put that in its right place why don't you just let him have his way [Music] anybody like

God just come yeah I want you to look at these words cover me when I'm hurting for him to cover us it means that we're under him when David would say let me be under the shadow of that Menace so in order for that to come apart come to past we believe that he heals hurts we believe cover me when I'm not strong we're big enough to acknowledge we're weak cover me when I'm going through the storm Lord my ship is being tossed sails might seem like they're being torn so we acknowledge the Lord I need your help in this trial you know what that is let's fail that's not weakness I'm gonna say I'm strong that that's true let the weak say I'm strong but remember it's faith that brings an atmosphere well we just read here in gyrus none which they have time to really get into it was faith that brought the atmosphere then God moves down and God takes control put that song back up here please cover me when all seems hopeless they better had times where things seemed hopeless you're praying about things and it don't seem like nothing's change a matter of fact it's going the opposite way cover me when when my faith is gone anybody's faith been gone well not mine brother Samuel Jobs was but you see sometimes when it is the faith itself here it's residing in our life what it is to get everything connected back again cover me when my faith is gone I notice my faith your faith my faith is different than his faith but his faith will operate through our faith so cover me when my faith is gone Lord I need strength right now your word is true you see how does faith come VIN faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word start entertaining that of the word now there might be a song that used to start singing in your heart remember real songs real songs are based on the word in an experience David said thy songs thy statutes have been my solace in my pilgrimage let the peace that passes all I understand cover me cover me see David knew what he had access to all of these problems were standing out here like this brother Carlos you know and what David said David said I'm gonna take all my problems and I'm gonna put Jesus above I'm gonna take how I feel I'm gonna put Jesus above that I feel hopeless but I have hope in him I'm expecting him to move I put him above all things so you know how it is with kids they do this you might feel like that's going on like this
