TRANSCRIPT
========================================
reaches to such a place to what he himself is going to do we know that it is the will of God is that right we know it was the will of God for him to offer up his life but yet it was not something he could just merely do or even be drug to he couldn't be forced to do it but it had to be something that he was willing to do it but in the willingness to do it Paul picks it up and gives us an insight even in Hebrews chapter 12 when he would speak to you and I about everything that we go through and he would say consider him who endured contradiction of sinners lest you be weary and faint in your mind for Paul goes on to say you have not resisted against blood but he makes known to us that the Lord Jesus himself was able to endure for the joy that was set before him how could he endure the cross it was not just he was not just fixated upon the cross what he was focused upon is what would actually the joy that would come from him going to the cross oh my what a what a life that was lived and here this same hold has taken place in Paul's life because Paul realizes here when he says that I must fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ that there is a wanting of the afflictions of Christ to be borne by me remember when the Lord spoke to Paul and said I will show thee what great things thou must suffer for my name's sake and so Paul goes on in this you know the meaning that it would be that I would supply in order to repay the benefits which Christ conferred on me so that the greatest the greatest benefit and the greatest supplying of this is not is not something that Paul is being mandated to do but where Paul himself remember he would refer to himself again a prisoner of Jesus Christ and he would refer of the love that had taken hold he wanted the people to understand that what he was doing was not about something of where he was compelled in service because remember Paul was a Pharisee of Pharisees is that right Paul knew what it meant to do acts of service are you with me but Paul was saying this is different this is not an act of service because the Pharisees the Lord Jesus said they would go around and make long prayers and pretence and everything they did was about a show Paul's letting know that this is not about a show this is not done out of a show this is out of love with Paul even when himself when he would go even into Rome the Bible would tell us that he was not bound with cords as far as physically but he says I go bound in the spirit so this was here when he would even speak again he said I am constrained by the love of God so this had so wrapped in his life to wear that Paul would you know speak of this that there would be the fulfilling or the filling up of the measure of the afflictions its laid upon me we understand that the tests and trials that come our way these are not tests and trials that are randomly falling but everything God knows right along the way and how that everything is all working together for our good it is everything that's working God is moving everything and moving so that in our lives that the glory of God might be declared and the thing that God has to get out of the way is us now watch how Paul will speak of this here once again in Philippians 3:7 what things were gain to me those are counted loss for Christ we could just preach on this verse for four weeks now what was gain to me there's a lot of things that can be gained to me and we're not just talking about jobs and other things like this but if things what is if that's something that profited or advantages me in some way if it's something that will lift me Paul said no no no no that is what I count a loss for Christ hi yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord want you to watch what Paul's putting this Paul is he is in such a place here that where Paul notices purpose everything else is so fading away and it continues to fade away the closer that Paul gets to the end of his race everything else is fading away it's not it's not his focus upon himself he's becoming greater as a matter of fact that's becoming less and and that's where we know even where we're at and even where we ought to be in our journey and where God desires to bring us is that it's not about us it's about him it's about his body amen it's about the purchase of his blood it's not about me you know God you know God will put us in situations that actually where he will God will never make a decision for us but God will put us in place as to where we can make decisions we can say things and do things that will be about me or elevate of me or my point or God will do all of that to see what are we going to do what are we going to take in this or would always say wait a minute let me take the backseat and let Christ be the front God will allow that you say what brother semi I've been there enough I feel that we all have been there we all have failed in that area we're not trying to preach you know something to where that it's honor it's not unattainable no but to recognize when it doing something like that we know and it's mites are hard we can say I said that out of turn right there I shouldn't have said it that way something that even could smart a heart because the desire when cry just moved into our lives our desire is that he would be the one on display and it moves us were constrained by that and he goes on to say for whom who for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ mine what a way to look at these things that nothing else matters except the excellency of Christ Jesus verse 9 let's go in let's go men amigo just a little further and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that God has supplied get is it is not you or me that has made ourselves righteous but we are receiving his righteousness plus sickness in another place you know in the book of Romans where he says they going about to obtain their own righteousness have missed the righteousness of Christ the righteousness of Christ is not something that we can come to and finally we merit it no even to come to a place to where Christ himself takes us as his own is because he has released sufficient grace to bring us to that place of what love has called for hallelujah so it's his it's his grace his love that's working here Paul says look at this in verse 10 that I may know him Paul already knew him but he wants to know him more that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering ah I want to be a participant in his sufferings how can he say this because as a man and a woman do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband to have and to hold for richer and poor in sickness and in health do you take him or do you take this woman do you do this not just in the good times and when everything's up and everything's going but you see this is a uniting being made look at this being made conformable unto his death pulsing now I want that same working that was within the groomer I wanted to work in me to bring me to the conformability to what he himself became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I want that to work in me to wear that I myself am so constrained think about how Paul himself had one walking around and these men are men of God these men are men of God and God allowed him to advertise but then Paul himself notice how the Prophet will put this here he picks it up and Christ the mystery of prisoner of love and he speaks of these things it's not something insignificant but he said notice how Paul himself wanted to speak to that spirit and remove that from there woman he said but he waited until God said do it you see it was he's a prisoner of love he was constrained by love when you constrained by love it's not about you it's about him oh my if by any means I might attain under the resurrection of the dead Paul speaking of that first resurrection blessed are the dead who die in the Lord were death hath no more a man not as though look at this not as though I had already attained either were already perfect these verses scripture I know we've read them so many times but they're still they still grips my heart I trusted grips your heart Paul was letting him know hey I'm not perfect how could he say that he cuz don't recognize I'm still here in this tabernacle I'm still here so God gotta work there's things that God is moving perfecting in my life but I follow after all glory be to God if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus once laid hold on your life what's laid hold on my life our desires I follow after that the one who has laid hold on me I follow after that that I might apprehend that I may lay claim to him who has lay claim on me the Bible says it like this in Hebrews 10 verse 12 verse 10 Hebrews 2:10 sorry for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings let me just say this listen to me now he was the perfect Lamb of God Emanuel are you with me he was perfect there was no fault there was no flaw there was no blemish that's not what this is talking about but the completion the perfection of this journey is that he that is the captain might also be partaker of sufferings not just a Calvary but even as the Prophet would speak of that book that he read about the Prince of the house of David when he had seen that funeral and he says it's raised in that book somewhere he said I don't know whether it's so or true or not he said but that man when he said the Lord Jesus went over and it says he grown in himself having a headache and brother Dan always takes this part he says he didn't have to do that he didn't have to be sick he never had to experience weariness he didn't have to but you see God himself so subjecting it he's so subjected himself to where when he became one of us that he could saw I did fine with you and me and let me tell you something he saw identified with you and I he did not leave his body in the grave but he raised it up for our justification and he took it back to the throne and what is it it is a reminder when he walked here in humanity and he also releasing to us that same life that lived in that body and that that same life might be a faithful mediator in you and I so even when you don't know how to pray there's stains sometimes that come your way and your heart is so moved you don't even have words you might get up to pray and you set up I just don't see my knockin Preah I don't see like I got words can come out and and yet what's happening in the midst of it the spirit maketh intercession with groanings that cannot be honored hallelujah this was all made possible by the captain of our salvation glory be to God this was not one like that captain the Prophet talks about his little boy had just a sore throat and here was the man that had been crushed by the tank and hit man said they put that they put that captain's boy ahead of this man that had been a soldier that had been crushed by a tank and brother and said they put that little boy ahead they had a sore throat but this one he put our needs before his knees he didn't have to be sick he didn't have to experience temptation but he did for you and me or what dead of love I all that day on Calvary he was just one man the perfect man He gave His life and made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others now watch how watch how this comes through here that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine what's how he's separating this going to church doing good things that's fine but that's not what we're talking about we're not just talking about going to church and doing good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life so a person could go to church do good things that's fine and still not living for others eternal life we're not serving him out of fear out of out of out of torment but our service to Him why we do what we do is because we love him grace is what he did for me works is what we do in appreciation for that grace that was given to us so the things that he would Express to us in his word it's not a question of you have to but it's has he expresses it we look at it and say yes Lord and then sometimes even later is where he makes known the meaning in a greater way of what we have already given ourselves to why why do you do that because you love him we love him it proves look at this because love love don't seek a reward it proved it you understand what I mean love don't seek a reward if you do something and then what if what if let's say yeah but the Joey brought some of those nice chocolate-covered strawberries to my house I'm not giving him a hint or anything like that but then let's say that you know I just forgot to even think him about or even mention something and then let's say that but Shane he brings some nice you see will say chocolate covered strawberries to keep it saying but the joint may have brought 12 of them Shane only brought three but all of a sudden I get up you know in that net and that service and I'll say you know I but saying I really appreciate you bringing him in strawberries by my house if you brothers need to know my garage code I'll give it to you I really appreciate that now let me ask you something if brother Joey out of that out of that there's a temptation that could come to say how do you think him he didn't think me but you see listen it's not saying the thought wouldn't come it's not saying the thought wouldn't come because the enemy look we are not ignorant of Satan's devices but the thing that brother joy what he what what would brother Joey do then in that point what would be the part to do to say you know what this time it forgets many times there's no doubt he just forgot but really could say I could tell by looking at him he had all 12 of them I know he enjoyed him you understand what I'm saying it's about love seeketh not her own love seeketh not her own it proved look at this eternal life is living for others it proved when it come to the Lamb of God in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others now watch how he places this living for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man force wander called that names or say other things hey there's a part about us that could get stirred up Obul to Samuel I've had the Holy Ghost for years I have to but you're blessed in get the Holy Ghost your spirit didn't get the Holy Ghost come on now don't listen friends don't sit here and say well I owe it no we don't always catch it we don't always catch it but he who has caught us catches us and he will direct us back to the sacrifice and remember directing us back to the sacrifice is the sacrificing of our own will which is the sacrificing of our own feelings that we might be the true sacrifice that I might redeem him how can you redeem you cannot redeem without a sacrifice there's no redemption without shedding of blood those same I'm gonna have to shed blood blood his life let me ask you a question how did you and I become lovable were you lovable was I lovable no thanks brother Brian he knew me before God got a hold me some of the rest you did too one lovable none of us were lovable none of us but who made you and I lovable he did he made us lovable as a matter of fact when we were dead and sin and trespasses the Bible tells us in the Book of Ezekiel he gave us a new heart and a new spirit he gave us a new spirit as the Prophet said because we could not even get along with ourselves much less with anybody else and then he placed his spirit in us by the new birth whoa he says you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were sons your sons you're taking Christ place your son so don't live for yourself live for others well brother branham I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man that's not it who easy to live for somebody who has a temperament like yours don't look at me strange now here within this just just our little group we are different there are so many differences in the way that we approach things and we think things and we go about things God has arranged all of that you know why because there's parts about us that need to be rubbed it's not about highlighting your temperament or my temperament as though oh this is so good it's stinking it's rotten it's no good but God will take something like that and he will use that to rub rub you rub me woo look what he says live for live for that man who hates you live for that person who'd kill you if they could that's what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life even when he was on the cross Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing my when you get it that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the Sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary now you ever how many of you watch a sheep been shorn anybody ever watched a sheep where it's getting its wool take off okay well they've got little clips and little things out there some real interesting things that's on even on YouTube or other things out there where they've got men who actually they still do that for a living even in other countries and you know what that's sheep when it comes up there that sheep will come over to this side of the pen boom it'll go in that side and then it'll come over here but you know what those who are sharing it know how to handle it they take that sheep and put it into place to where the Sheep is not going to be injured but then when they put it in that place then the wall could be sheared off let me tell you something Almighty God is overseeing the shearing of our lives when he led the lamb to Calvary and the Bible speaks in Isaiah 53 he was led as a lamb dumb before her Shearer's showing our part in there it is him bringing oversight and what do we do in the midst of the shearing is to rest in his hands and he shears away the wool what is the wool the Wolves not something you manufacture it's produced by virtue of who you are and it's necessary that that will be removed from you because in that wool sometimes parasites can get in it not mud and dirt can get so into a place to where it can actually bind a sheep down to where they can't even get up out of the mud and so God says I need to shave and cut this part down because I want you to be able to move and respond to my call aren't you glad this isn't the devil that's got you and I in a pen and he's getting you an Isis I tell you what Joshua I'm a POW and no no no that's it's not the devil putting you and I in a in a hole no no no God is overseeing the trial and as they put those sheep down there and hold it over oh my there they position it in such a way even when they're teaching the men that are going to be taking over as apprentice and so forth in this they're showing them how to handle the sheep during this time I tell you that just makes me want to rejoice makes me want to cry to know his hands have never left me even when I'm in the midst of the trial in the shearing his hands are right there to make sure the less I would hurt myself you looked on towards Calvary he says look I focus you look on towards Calvary I said I hope this helps I hope this helps you to get in a place that's what the tabernacle speaking of locally says that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose Church isn't going to church just to play music and sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins at the house of God we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ allowing the word to work in our life and the word will cut the word is a discerner of the thoughts and into the heart tenzin intents of the heart it separated as the bone and the moral it gets right down in there and brings a separation because there's sometimes friends we and ourselves as much as we would have and as we can look in the word but sometimes God has to come right down and bring a separation for something that we are united and standing with and God has to say it's not my mind that's not my attitude That's not me he has to separate that and he knows if he can make himself known and point that out than he has the Shepherd his sheep which he knows my Mane will unite with him he made a way that we could sacrifice ourselves aren't you glad he made a way through his sacrifice he made a way that you and I might sacrifice to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he led second Corinthians 4:6 let me move on here for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that's that's frail that earthen means frail jars of clay that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us everybody knows us what everybody in here knows what a clay pot is you take a clay pot and it could be very beautiful or even when you look at a flower pot if you drop that it's gonna break if you even set it down too hard it's gonna break you see the Lord Himself he treats you and I as a loving husband that we are the weaker vessel so as an earthen vessel notice this here we are troubled look at this in verse eight we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus I want you to think of this scripture always bearing about not it's there's not a moment there's not a time that is to go by we're not bearing about we're always bearing about carrying about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus what was the dying of the Lord Jesus listen friends it's just like we looked at on Sunday if all that we do is look at Calvary we miss the dying that was taking place all along he was dying to his own will to serve fully the purpose of God death is not at just an event it is a process it's true we must die to be born again but through that death and that new birth then releases you and I to a place that we can die to his purpose be served always bearing about always sometimes here we are you come out of a wonderful service and here you are a Friday morning my just thinking about the service or on Monday morning or maybe don't even make it to Monday morning and all of a sudden something transpires or takes place you receive something in the mail and you check the mail yesterday but the bill or whatever that should have come to you went to your neighbor and now it comes to you and all and when you're looking at whatever you're looking at her whatever it comes here are you in the midst of it and you know you think what in the world is going on you know brother Branham said it like this in the message why Christ speak he says speaking of where the children of Israel came down to the Red Sea he said you watch after a good service he said where the glory of God has begun to fall among the people of God he said Satan then is permitted to come right among them to try to do what deaden or take away from what God has done but remember what has been brought to you and I what is ministered what is brought here is not with enticing words of man's wisdom because that will fade but that your faith might and then the power of God oh you might you might be falter in one place and why is this going on but then God can move right down and say but remember I have spoken to you their faith is standing in the power of God of that visitation just like Moses at a visitation at the burning bush you had a visitation always always always always when do we rests we rest beyond the river always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus why that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body in our body look when we speak a body soma when we speak of body this entails all of our emotions all of our feelings everything that is associated therewith for we which live look at this hour alway delivered unto death for our
