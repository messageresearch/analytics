happiness brother Sam my just a precious friend many years I don't get to see them as much as I like we send each other a text or something every now and then let each other know that we're we're still kickin and but he was out our way here this last year and June so enjoy just I guess I've told it more than one place that that Samuel Browning is the best kept secret the message I really think you ought to preach every convention and just a fantastic fantastic brother and I've told this to many people probably never tell it to him so if he gets the archive bill he'll know but there's a few people in the world that I can just sit around and talk to for endless hours but brother Samuel from the day I met him just week and I just can't get away from him he just he's always got something interesting he's always he never loses my attention and we just kind of see things eye to eye and I just appreciate him and so glad there and I found out that he comes from good good souring his family it was just amazing I never really got to spend a lot of time with our dear brother Browning but with the sister Pat we've had a marvelous marvelous visit and just well I just know where he got it a man just can sit there fellowship with that sister all night and sister Kim came over well we just we brought in the new day I'll tell you it just seemed like every day it was a wonderful fellowship the food oh my word just I don't know I don't know if I'll be able to act the the same ever again I don't know just just really really felt like we were treated like kings and queen and my just a real real blessing so we just want to thank you and thank the family everybody for their hospitality and and just to come into the presence of the Lord you just don't I don't want it to just just a word of encouragement a word of admonition this morning don't let it become common just and entertain this sweet spirit always you just well I can tell you you just don't know what you got sometimes since so it's just really good to be in a lively church and we just appreciate that so much this morning and so I suppose if you have your Bibles this morning and would like to stand as we read the work I'd like for you to go with me into the book of Acts chapter 2 and no doubt every Sunday school student could quote these scriptures by heart but we don't probably preach from them like we should but just a bit of a thought that came to my heart and so we'll just try to move with this as best that we can we're in Acts chapter 2 and there we want to begin reading at verse 37 Acts chapter 2 and verse 37 now when they had heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and under the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise can you say that with me the promise it's a promise is unto you and unto your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call let's pray together father we thank you Lord this morning O God for this this great word Lord that is before us no doubt that men have embraced these scriptures down through the annals of history Lord we realized that that it's a time-tested memorial and that when men and women would believe these things that they would receive the very benefit of the promise Lord and so Lord we just ask you today Lord as we humble ourselves before your mighty hand Lord and we come to bless your name and to honor this day this Day of Resurrection Lord the rest of the world is going in saying it's falling apart but father here this morning there is a little elect lady today Lord that has gathered to honor the resurrection - to bestow all of her praise upon the the one who is all deserving the Lord of glory the very mighty God so we praise you today we worship you we pray father that you will now take these scriptures and thoughts Lord and quotes that we have and Lord may you begin to weld them and blend them Lord and homogenizer God into our hearts the very meanings and Lord the very power and the very spirit of these words may they become real and living to our hearts as we give you all the things and praise Jesus lovely name god bless you friends you can have your seats this morning we what to I don't know why but it to pray it if my eyes start leaking and so and but we want to also while we're here just for some foundational scripture text I would like for you to look with me also in the book of Hebrews chapter six and while you're turning there I'll tell you a little story happened one time there was a fellow he was of some Spanish or Latin descent and so he had a bit of an exit and he had actually said some things that we were in quite agreement with but my my son was listening to him preach and we got home and we really are away home and my wife asked me says well what about this and what about this and my son Ian really never ever says anything about spiritual things or anything like that and he just piped up he said he said I knew that man was off I said what I said I didn't know he was paying attention you know and he said I said whoa please Sonny expound upon this upon this great discernment that you have and he said well he I knew when he couldn't say Hebrews he said he booze he said I knew he was off right then I said oh my goodness I said sometimes that's about as far as our discernment go and so but it's Hebrews and so we're here there in chapter 6 this morning and I also want to read out of the book of Philippians so we won't be done with our Bibles here for just a bit I want to read out of Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 1 and I just just what I'm doing here is showing that there's not a contradiction from Acts chapter 2 as we move on into Paul's writings here and as we begin reading in verse 6 he says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrines of Christ let us go on into perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith towards God of the doctrine of baptisms and laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the Dead and of the eternal judgment he said but this we will do if God permit it so it wasn't saying that we're doing away with them but we're just not going to go back because he's going to take the Hebrew Church on into some deeper doctrines but he said but we will do this if the Lord permits we'll go back and lay these things again because that's how people learn is that right about schoolteachers we know we learned by repetition is that right by by Rhian stilling those same rudimentary thoughts over and over and then adding to them and go back and go through those same elementary thoughts again and then add to them so you don't so Paul was not saying we're doing away with them but that we he didn't have the the he wasn't going to spend a lot of time on that presently because remember he was writing this out as a letter and so he says these are things that we do believe but and then he went on into the greater applications of the scriptures there so he began to deal with some election and so forth thereon later in the chapter now if you go over into the book of Philippians want to kind of amplify this a bit further and we're in Chapter three and there we want to begin reading at verse 12 Paul writing to the Philippians rich here he says not as though I had already attained either this is Philippians 3 and 12 he says not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend for that which also I an apprehended of Christ Jesus brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark pressed towards them the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus amen so now we have we have this little foundation that we've built here that we have a promise of God and I want to title the message this morning back to basics and so here we find that the Apostle Peter here at the inaugural sermon of the church brother BAM tells us this was the birthplace of the New Testament church was on the day of Pentecost and so we find that when the power of God had fallen and been dude with him with power from on high they came forth in acts 2 and they were they were shouting and praising God and speaking in tongues and and glorifying God and and then there was such a manifestation of the Spirit in these people's lives and so we realized that brother Branham tells us that he is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same in every respect I've ever said seen of discrepancy and every respect outside of the corporate body amen the same yesterday today and forever if you teach or preach anything other than that that is a seat of discrepancy so we look back and see what the first church was and then we begin to realize that we're many times far cry from what that first church was but we but but as Paul said here I'm laying aside all the things of my past and I'm pressing for the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus we want to go back we want to we want to teach the deeper things we want to go many times and and expound on the on the on the greater revelations of the hour and the time that we live in which is 100% needed I believe that we should do it on a regular basis that's why we have a fivefold ministry that's why we have teachers and pastors that can do these things but sometimes the Evangelist has to come by and take us back to those those the basics and take us back to the the things because we got new people we got young people we've got people that are just gave their heart to the Lord and now they they need to be brought back into the end of them into the stream with the rest of us that have been around so long and got all Moss backed and sit on our pews so long that you know we just you know we don't we wonder sometimes why our children won't come to the island walk to the altar well I believe that we should lead my experience and lead by example amen and so sometimes I think that the reason that young people don't get a real fire baptism is because old people are not willing to lead and show the way amen amen myself in and so we just you know you just sometimes you just gotta you just got a set an example and blaze the trail for him like we were saying the other day now here was this Paul was preaching these things and showing that were that were not to do away with those things we're not to just be we don't get beyond those things but you know we find that the Bible says that we should repent every one of you well we don't ever stop repentance you know and I found that repent many times is misinterpreted because the word repent is a roman drill command that means about-face that's literally what it means to go the other way but well it's it's just many times it's it's lost in that interpretation oh well I was doing this and now I'm gonna do something different well no not altogether that way because repentance is an ongoing experience that every believer will have until the very time that they die or they receive a body change in and I found that the repentance if we could really understand repentance it is the condition of your conscience in the presence of God and so whenever a person and will take their conscious and they come into that presence and they begin to realize I've been doing this and I've been doing that and I said this and I thought that and I acted like that and then that begins that sets that that conscience becomes convicted and that then you turn from those things where you change that attitude that is a that is a great form of repentance it's something that must be done on a daily hourly moment-by-moment basis they keep yourself clean in the presence of God now it's not like the denomination is taught that if you went one mile over the speed limit and you wrecked your car and died and right there that you go to hell immediately they don't that's so that's so beyond what Paul was trying to say here and so we find out that when a person has truly repented and has been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and they've been filled with the Holy Ghost are born again they're there there are new creature in Christ Jesus they've passed from death unto and then they can no more die than God Himself can die they can't be lost any more than God can be lost you're saved you're sealed into the day of redemption is that it and so the the fear is gone but we still want to be right we still want to live right we want to live holy in that holy spirit allows us to do these things now from the message fellowship we're gonna take a bit of a turn here he says God chose a place a place I like this called Adam and Eve and shed the blood of an innocent one and covered them with the substance of this innocent one with the blood upon them and that was the basis that men could talk to God and hear his word and and get his word was under the shed blood and so when we realized that repentance and remission from sin for the Bible says that you'll be be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins well we it's not that the water remitted your sins but it's that you're going to the water to identify yourself in his death burial and resurrection and the supreme sacrifice that the Lord Jesus Christ made that day on Calvary and you go down in representation Andry repentance you're sorry for your sins you're you're turning from a life of sin to make Christ your Lord and King and then you go down in baptism typing the death you're raising again in a type of his resurrection and then he himself identifies your faith and since back the Holy Ghost upon you the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a gift a free gift you did not deserve it you did not do anything to earn it but it's God's grace amen the unmerited love in favor of Almighty God and bestows upon you the very life amen that was in him and if that life Amen that brought him out of the grave if it Wells in you in a quicken your mortal body hallelujah in this life and in the world to come brother madam uses this place in the message fellowship that we read as the approach to God he said it's our approach that matters it means everything and so we find today when young people go for a interview they go in there and they got you know gauges that look like a toilet bowl in their head and you know big ol rings in their ears and you know they got studs in their nose and in their cheeks and you know they got dreads hanging down their neck and they want to go get a job and and a natural leader or boss or or superintendent or whatever just anyways for them called it slop dough what a language yeah just a slop goal just just you know sauntering in there and just a slob and think that you're going to get anywhere with that and so if you're taught from your earliest times of applying for position of any kind of a job and you know that you go dressed accordingly you find out what is acceptable with the type of you know if I was running a framing crew and I was building houses and I had a young man come up to me with a shirt and tie on and you know a real nice pair of you know Pierre Cardin slippers on or whatever you know I just don't think I'd really want that man on my framing job I just don't think that's the way to come that way maybe with a nice flannel shirt on and some blue jeans and a pair of work boots and you know a shake my hand give me a good grip and I said well that feller he knows how to work you see he would even get my attention you see but if it gives me a little limp and wrists like that hey coming on my job I'm telling you right now and so it's your approach you see and so if you were going to get an executive job then you may want to dress in a shirt and tie in and look look the part and because you're in a more of an executive type position but but Bevin talks about the approach to God he said oh you come in there and say old daddy Oh God you know I said you're not going to get anywhere with the Lord to approach to God and so that's why repentance was the very rudimentary the very foundational the very matrix of our Christian experience was repent they said men and brethren what shall we do he said repent every one of you well I find that that if we can truly find that place of true heartfelt godly sorrow and we could turn our heart to God and come to him repentant and and in truly truly submissive to the Holy Spirit you wouldn't have to agonize at an altar that you wouldn't have to go through 25 camp meetings in two or three or four dozen preachers laying hands on you if you come the right way friends and truly submit yourself to God and bow before him and true heartfelt repentance Amen the Holy Ghost is already on the way [Applause] in the Bible we find in Exodus chapter 3 that Moses had an approach and he came brother the Bible says in Exodus 3 verse 4 he says when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called to him out of the midst of the bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I now when Moses said here am i he wasn't he wasn't at describing the geographical GPS location of where he was standing because God already knew where he was standing and so but what Moses was saying when he said here am I is that I'm not concerned about my Geographics I'm not I'm not concerned about my my um location God already knew where it was but what what he was identifying back to God was his condition and his position here in my Lord I'm I realized that I'm in the presence of something supernatural I mean I'm here Lord in a position to submit to whatever this voice is saying I'm in a condition to hear and to receive instructions Moses said and and Moses said unto God this is later in verse 11 he says Who am I and I thought this was striking as I looked at it because Moses said Who am I and when God spoke back to him he said I am he just reversed it said I am and Moses said Who am I but he says Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh whom that I should bring forth the children Israel out of Egypt look at his this is his approach because now then the Lord's telling him I'm going to use you I'm gonna keep I'm gonna take you and I've seen that I've heard the cries of my people and I've seen the the persecution that they've received under their taskmasters and I know all these things and I've heard their cries and I'm going to send you down there he said but Who am I that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt verse 13 it says and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them the god of your father's has sent me unto you and they shall say unto me what is his name and what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thou shalt say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you and so now that when Moses now we just kind of extrapolate here from from this point and we get down and now Moses brother BAM talks about him you know he was God it was veiled in Moses as a wonderful statement he said Moses became God and that God now dwelt in Moses and Moses was the veil that God lived in and he come down and got his wife he got his son and he got on a donkey and they went on their way down there he got his stick and they said Moses where are you going so I'm going down to Egypt to take over and he said a one-man invasion Airi force and so here it goes Moses he's on his way down there now when he gets there the very thing that he said to the Lord what was going to happen happened because he said he said the Lord your God has sent me to deliver you and they said well what is his name and he said I am that I am now then Moses now takes on the very first person of God he didn't say he is that he is or he was that he was or he will be that he will be know that Moses then becomes a very mouthpiece of God Lord told him he said you'll be God to Aaron and Aaron will be your prophet and so then here comes Moses I am that I am has said now we be proved that this warned that he was sent by was the one who sent him because now what does he do he begins to turn snake because he was given a sign did he sign in the hand a sign then he was by this stick that he had was turned into a serpent and leprosy and these curses that these plagues that would come by his very spoken word and so now then he became the very representation or as we could say the ambassador of Almighty God now then when an ambassador goes to another country and he goes there with what they call diplomatic immunity he is not he is in the country but he's not under the jurisdiction of that country he is under the jurisdiction of the country from whence he came hallelujah oh let me tell you Moses come down to Egypt as an ambassador of Almighty God he came down there with the very word of the king of the land from whence he came he came down there with the power and the authority to do whatever so ever that God had commanded him to do to set those people free he was ordained hallelujah of Almighty God to go down there and use whatever force necessary Oh glory to God Moses came down there is a weapon of mass destruction he came down there bearing Haman chemical biological and nuclear warfare he wasn't going to go down there and shoot him with a BB gun or a little bow gun or something like that no sir he went down there and drop anthrax on he did I looked it up in the thing that the burning on their head same word anthrax he wasn't joking around he's trying to drop in fire bombs napalm started coming out of heaven he started dropping it on their crops and on their fields out of a clear blue sky hail came down and burned like fire Moses was under the authority of the one who had sit here are you with me today church glory to God oh my you might help me a little bit getting warm up here dear moody tells a story about a young man he was a dual citizen of both the Great Britain and of the United States he had hired on to a merchant ship that worked in the the western Atlantic Caribbean theatres there they were good merchants work all down through there they back and forth across the Atlantic and one time there was the ship was accused and was identified as a pirate ship and the whole crew was taken captive by the Cuban Navy and they were brought and put in jail in Cuba and so he was been tried and convicted of piracy and even though he was a merchant he was an innocent man he did not was not a pirate but they tried him convicted him and sentenced him to death by firing squad and so during the time of his trial he was able to get a message out that could get to either the British or to the American consulate and to send help because and so the the American I believe it was consulate maybe both were able to come and hurt his case he was able to prove his innocence II to both American consulate and the British Consulate and they went to appeal his case to the Cuban government the Cuban government said that they're that they're a decision and that their their their sentence was final and that this man would be shot regardless of what they said they got a word back to the arm the United States and to Great Britain Great Britain and to tell the authorities that there was a man of both nation national citizenship that he was going they were going to shoot this man and that he was an innocent man and that he was a a citizen of the United States and of Great Britain and so the day came that he was to be executed and they they carried him led him down to the to the place of the wall where they were going to execute him by firing squad and so the man you know he had made his appeal he had done all that he could do and they they bound his hands behind his back and they led him to the place of execution they gave him his last words and they put a basically a hood over his head and stood him there and they began to the drum began to sound and the soldiers began marching into the the arena to perform the execution and as they get to this certain place they stop the procession they're standing there with their weapons in in in in in arms at port they're ready and they're giving the final prayer the far last rites the friar was there going through all the things and then they give the command to to take aim and as they begin to take aim or they say ready and they ready themselves and they drew it at about that time two men came running into the arena both of them streaming with their national flags and they ran to the man and the American grabbed the American flag took old glory hallelujah and wrapped the man in the American flag and the British man wrapped him amen in the British flag and they stood back and said fire all this if you dare Oh hallelujah amen and they put their weapons down because the Cubans did not warrant both nations amen the rulers of the sea and the rulers of the land they didn't want those two armies in their backyard Alleluia why because those ambassadors have the word of their nation fire Oh hallelujah well let me tell you came in one day Adams race Oh Adams race was was under execution orders remember Jesus came amen and he wrapped his blood and his rooms of righteousness around his little head oh why because he was a prisoner who had made his appeal when you repent of your sins you've made your appeal [Music] Amen now it was up to the nation from of his citizenship oh I'm not a citizen of this world any longer I've changed my residence I'm a citizen of glory and then I'm a citizen of the kingdom of God and now because I've changed my citizenship it's up to my nation to protect me it's up to my nation to rescue me it's up to my nation to save me oh you had to deliver me and to restore me back to my homeland oh praise be to God hate me what did he do but he ran out to him and greeted his son and wrapped his robes around him oh he said now prepare the banquet board but remember this man was blind in a hood over his head his hands were bound and he was helpless when we can get to that condition friend that's when God can do the most for you when because Paul said he said I sought the Lord I sought him for all these things and because of this thorn that was in my flesh and this messenger of Satan was sitting there to buff at me I saw the Lord thrice and the Lord spoke and said my grace is sufficient my face is sufficient in your weakness you're made strong Alleluia o my prophet of God says in this poor and sick and crippled up world is waiting for deliverance he said and they're looking at a signpost have mercy a signpost a signpost is nothing but a sign to prove the commission so when you're out here you see the sign over here that says there's so many miles from Lorraine or Sandusky er you know Cincinnati or Toledo or wherever you're headed you don't run out there and embrace the signpost I'm here I'm here I'm here you know it's at fifteen miles you still got a ways to go so that's what really I was saying here he says there he says there look there waiting for deliverance and looking at a signpost have mercy a signpost is nothing but a sign to prove the Commission so brother moon shows us that there was a sign he said and the sign was at one place he said the cross and the Bible were at another place he said in the middle was the words of the Commission oh my so now we begin to look at what is the Great Commission we can go throughout all the Gospels and we can find where the Bible tells us in Matthew 28:19 go into all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost and then we come over and we read our acts 2:38 which clarified what Jesus was saying based on one who had the keys of the kingdom and it comes and tells him to repent exactly what Jesus had told him to do he went and preached and exactly word for word we find over and that Jesus also tells him and in Luke's Gospel he tells him the same thing and we can spend a lot of time just going verse by verse over these things and so this this commission the Great Commission was given to the church and in mark 16 there which will read some of these as we get a little further down the road he said but the to prove the Commission brother man says there is a new ministry it's just been revealed to me pray for the sick get the people to believe you God can never leave that that's his commission no matter what goes on how much I fail I fail miserably I should never have went ahead with in signs that wasn't the will of God but God has blessed it anyhow but I'm ready to leave this mountain I want to go across Jordan I want to carry the Commission get the people to believe you so now that so we saw that brother Branham was given a commission what was the Commission now the the he says here was a commission I charge you were God and the elect angels and Jesus Christ the Commission was pray for the sick the question was insufficient to do it for this cause you were born this is the means of your peculiar look to peculiar birth and life that you are to pray for the sick if you'll get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer alright so now we have so we're reading about brother brown's commission and and so then he says but they won't believe me he said I'll give you as Moses was given two signs I'll give you two signs and so then those signs became the thing that the people began to look at and that's why they could get healed and when the discernment came they believed they got healed the discernment came they believed that got healed he took him by the hand see the bumps on his hand go all these things he said it was this this and this they would believe he'd grabbed their hand again it would be gone they got healed he would prophesy and discern their thoughts and intents that their heart they got healed they believe they believe believe believe they would come to that they would come to the platform ascend up he was just going to want to pray for him they're just going to pray for you I'm just gonna pray for it they come through the line and as he would pray he would say now that I'm just gonna pray for said no no brother Branham but my case is special I have a special need I have a very special need I need you to I need you to use one of those gifts and that they were looking for those signposts and not looking at the word the Commission was to preach the gospel the good news read the word but they didn't want that they wanted a sign so then he would perform the sign and then they would get well they would go off the platform the next one comes and said but my case is just as important as his case and so he'd have to do it again and he said about six of those that he said they'd have to carry him out the platform he said how many thousands of people didn't get prayed for because they look to the sign he said oh he said he said he said how cruel was that for me to allow them to cause me to use the gift he said I even became to her relied on it myself he relied on that to pray for the people but the word was give the people to believe by how by preaching the gospel important that we understand something here because this was not just an individual Commission given to one man called William Brennan I've got a Bible full of places where the Bible tells me to go and preach to be in season and out of season to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover to get the people to believe if we can preach the gospel he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth and is baptized shall be healed shall be delivered a men shall be it's the same word to the same people even just that we don't have this Messiah son operating in my life does not change the Word of God because when we begin to look at a signpost we'll never get to go where we're supposed to be he said we got a man can do a trick with his hand oh you ought to see it we got a man that can take a stick and make a snake out of it come and see that was just a signpost wasn't no different than in our day and God forbid then it becomes the same thing today oh well we just you know oh we just can't let the you know the pastor pray for us we're gonna have that evangelist oh he's just this that now or we got to go to some Kant lenient we've got to be under seven or eight days of meetings and it's got to become so electrified and everybody's falling out in the aisles before we can get healed I would I would that we could have little sister had he right walk in the building she didn't need all that she heard the testimony she said ain't nothing but the truth and God gave her the soles of her t cents hello oh my I think that we need to get back to basics hey hey hey man we've been circling this mountain a good while my brother man says I want to get away from this mountain I went across Jordan he said I want to carry the Commission get the people to believe you we got a man that could do a trick with a hand with the sticks and that was just a signpost that wasn't the Commission they wasn't waiting for a signpost god help us they were waiting for deliverance the children of Israel down there weren't waiting for a man to come down there and do a trick with a stick that's the way they interpreted it that's not what it was that was a sign to them to show them that hey yes the I am is here the I am is here but how much greater in the hour that we live in that if we can come and show you infallibly by the Word of God that you can be healed you can be delivered you can be saved and set free filled with the Holy Ghost based on the written word of God he said that was given to the church to prove that Satan could be defeated anytime anywhere and under any circumstances we have the greater when we don't wait I don't believe we've had our sign was a Malachi 4 prophet he came we saw the sign this message is the truth I don't need any more signs once I passed that first sign since so many miles you know the Lorraine or Sandusky or where we're going I don't need that sign no more huh I got onboard navigation tells me where I'm going oh my baby what is our boy navigation it's called GPS God's position sensor Oh My gods position satellite hallelujah it's telling us it's a guy that's the holy gold he said the Holy Ghost will lead God and direct you into all truth and I've got I've seen the signpost I know where I've been I don't know where I'm going Oh but let me hear the Commission going to all the world and preach preach preach with all that's in you hallelujah he said in these signs will follow them that believe you see get the people to believe and the science will follow you were to pray for sick people if you'll get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing she'll stand before your prayer not even cancer it's time to get our eyes off of the signpost and get to looking at the Commission what was the Commission the Gospel he that believeth amen in his baptized shall be saved is the word Sozo means both salvation and healing it was all it was a complete Amen it was a it was a it was a like we're sharing with brother Paul there's a whole life package hey man it said but it's blessed assurance its whole life it even has roadside assistance any man hallelujah it won't just get you in the grave it'll get you out praise the Lord brother BAM speaking of had he right I just want to inject this she said brother Branham that's nothing but the truth she didn't just say it from here or from here but God spoke it out of her heart amen she didn't say it from here she said it from here they said but God spoke it from her heart oh my think about it friends now no I I brought you to a place and these are all loaded statements everything I've said up to this point is loaded very loaded because we want to see that God did him to sign he sent in today's of Moses Synod in our day that the Commission was given we have a great Commission we have that we have the Bible all of these things are pointing us to the very self same thing but then we come down to the Book of Revelations in chapter 10 and the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and we find that it didn't say in the days of the seven angel or there be a lot of us they would be in a world of hurt you see but he said in the days of the voice and so there and then brother family what was the first thing that he speaks when it first recorded words that we have as they've just got some of these new recording gadgets that's what he said first words that we have and the message there about these recording gadgets now what were they for they were for a season and a time and the very fact that the voice could be recorded would be a sign to an electric of people because there would be an electro-pop people that would be looking for the voice they weren't looking for the man I don't need the man to come back I don't need discernment I don't even need the Lord Jesus himself to come and stand here oh you're a stretch no because brother Branham said if he was here he couldn't do anything more for you than he's already done brother Branham couldn't lead us any more to the message if he was standing here if he did have a return ministry he wouldn't have anything to say because in the days of the voice and then the voice of the seventh angel the mystery singular of God would be finished finito completo huh it'd be over finished doesn't need any more we've got all we have need of my thing is they said well we got to get beyond brother Brennan I was like I don't make sense because how can you get beyond if you've never got to I can't go beyond I never got to let me get what that prophet had let me walk in the shoes that he walked in hey man let me walk in the spirit in the fellowship and the approach to God that he had when I can walk like that then I'll get the results that that man gone [Applause] but what he said I'm ready to leave the mountain I want to go across Jordan I want to carry the Commission but you got to get the people to believe and so then we come and the Bible says in mark 16 and verse 15 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they said at me tinha watch this is this is monumental and and in the Bible says that he abraded them with their unbelief and their hardness of heart because they believe not on them which had seen him after he was risen and so now we have an hour day we had I witness 'as they saw the minute miracles the signs of wonders everything that happened in brother Browns life we have the tapes we have the audible personal testimonies of a man that that saw the unbelievable things done in our day there's no reason for me to doubt those things I don't have to doubt that brother Branham could call you out of the back row when he couldn't even see a little boy laying down in the back row on the floor and have the prophet of God reach out there and tell him and say mister mr. farmer you've been wondering if this ministry was true he said but I tell you you have a son he's there beside you the boy was laying on the floor down on the floor laying there he was club-footed crippled had to wear braces hallelujah no he said there's a boy laying there he's got he's got a disease in his feet he says brother he said brother farmer I give you that boy's healing and He healed the man's wife too I don't need the sign anymore I've got the fulfillment I know the boy [Applause] he's a preacher in this message named forest farmer you can go meet him and Walnut Ridge Arkansas few won't - everybody will walk all day long I've heard it with him that man had nothing wrong with his feet or his leg but he had braces and his feet was turned inside and couldn't walk without braces but he walks just fine today Oh another sister just went off the scene here the other day I had her personal testimony told how she was called out now how do they audience God and healed her I don't need the sign no more we got so maybe I oughta just build a profit or if I could have just come through the Brotherhood Oh friend you got so much more than the prayer line heaven brother haven't had to repent for using those things over and over he said of her winner he said he said I'm so sorry he said I had to repent to my church for using these signs I have to repent to the churches of the world I done wrong had done wrong direct quote and so why would we want to go with the wrong although brother brother says but God did use it he used he gave him the signs to use but he abused it the people abused it they got their eyes on the sign and got their eyes off the Commission the gospel was we before brother Branham the gospel is an arrant it's infallible it's an adulterated it's powerful it's the Living Word of God it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the old mine I'm so glad God sent a sign in our day I'm so glad that God raised that brother branham I'm so glad that we had a prophet I listen to him every day of my life but let me tell you that the Commission was to them and to you here this morning is to believe believe the Commission Jesus said the works that I do shall you do so believe the gospel we don't need brother branham to come back we don't need a superstar preacher to come around and then your mother can pray for you your sister can pray for you Oh young men can pray for each other better haven't said anybody can go and have a healing campaign housewife could go have one I didn't make it up what he abraded them because of their unbelief and hardness of heart because they didn't believe them which had seen him after he had risen we have infallible testimonies hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them brother Perry brother brother Eddie all these different ones that were there they saw it they saw those eyes come in their head brother Billy Paul all these different ones they saw the feet come straight they saw the legs grow out they saw that the eyes come they saw the lame walk the crippled the blind see the Deaf spoke even people that never served God testified know a woman that never served this message not one day in her life said in their brother branham called around told she was a barren woman and she bore children after that she never served God at all he says and then he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature that was the Commission to preach the gospel the good news the good news for him is risen amen in that same Jesus that they saw go away has come again in like manner in our day oh let me tell you the word Christ is here the word crew the word Messiah the word theophany the word Melchizedek is here among us we don't have to go off to a far off place we don't have to go up high in the heavens or down below the sea he's here now he's near Haman as our limiting senses will allow us Therese how to cut tab and eat or they she boy girl man woman that believeth and is baptized shall be saved either believe it not shall be damned and they self these signs will follow them that be believed talking to believers can you say I believe Lord sometimes we have to say lord help my unbelief but I believe I believe and I don't need I don't need a sign oh I you know I was I was wondering if I'd even tell this but I Philippe necessary I had just gotten saved and I started going I just started preaching just within just a couple of just a short time I was going to Arizona State pin and I was I was preaching there to a group of what they call the outside trustees these guys that could leave and come back but they had to come back every night and they were but they were read they were resident there in in the what they called the outside trustee unit at the Arizona State pin and I was I walked to the pulpit there was a group of men there probably twelve fourteen men there was a couple of brothers that came with us that were just there to support and play music and so forth walked into the the little fellowship there and I walked up and took my text and I was sitting there and all of a sudden it was though my eardrum had broken it was like I'm just like there's a hissing vibration noise in my ear and I was like oh my goodness and I just got up there to preach Oh huh oh my how can't preach like it I can't even talk hardly it was just a excruciating pain and I said brothers y'all have to pray for me something just happened to my ear feels like a broken speaker it's very painful and and I just I don't think I can go like this and there was a brother sitting there his name was David Fritz some of you may know him he went to Tucson Tabernacle for years and years he's retired now his precious brother brother David Fritz and brother David says brother Dale he says I've got the same thing in my ear he said I broke my eardrum on the job here just while back he said been suffering with it for a long time I said brother I never had nothing wrong with my ear in my life I said you pray for me and I'll pray for you and we believe God will heal us he said I believe that so we got her I laid my hand on his ear he laid his hand on mine we started praying a couple of seconds later both of our ears popped and we never had no trouble ever again huh I've never had nothing wrong with my ear before but it was a sign well I forgot about it I just loved it ago I never I never I never looked for those kind of things ever again in my life years later let's like 2007 there's 1983 or for somewhere along in there or late 83 early 84 all the way 2007 I go to the Egypt I'm in the I'm in the in the Great Pyramid we go down all the way down the bottom got there my translators with me he's a brother from Lebanon named Pierre we went down the bottom we're on our way back out of there we're about halfway out and you got to bend over coming out of that tunnel coming up out of there and we're crawling her way out of there about halfway up he blows the LCL ACO LLC whichever one it is on the outside of his leg right here blows his knee out I mean he was like he's down on his knee crippled he's hurtin I mean he can't his big guy kinda like me and and so he can't and he was just crawling out of that out of the bottom of that tomb we got him up there and literally had to give him a shoulder so he could get him back to the car he stayed like that for oh that was on a Monday and all day Tuesday he just laid in bed iced his leg couldn't get around Wednesday we had church service that was the last service that I would be there and I had to fly out and he was our only translator and so he goes to the service and he's literally uh you know just crippling you know having it I think it's sound actually how to help him in the church he's in there and he's down in the basement of this church or this hotel and there's a basement conference room where we were at well I'd get there mother Tony admin gives me a ride over there we get out I'm getting out of the car I step out of the car and my knee blows out and I'm like oh what in the world and so I'm crippling my way down and but I had told Pierre about what happened back all them years ago I had forgot about it wasn't even in my mind I was tube Livius I thought oh here we go broke my leg you know I get in there and when I walk in the room I look up and peers jumping over to me and I'm jumping over to him and I said brother Pierre I believe God's fixing to do something I said your knee hurts right here he goes yes sir I said the same God that healed that boys ears go fix him to heal your leg we laid hands on each other both knees pop same time we jumped around the place shouting horrified why it was a sign it was a sign but I'm not looking at the sign the same God that gave the sign Amen is still here today whether I feel anything that I don't feel anything he's still the same Jesus well needless to say that thing has happened to me multiple times since then it waited such a long time probably because I didn't have the character to handle something like that I don't know that I do now but it still happens from time to time I'll get this unexplainable pain in my back upset stomach unexplainable just before and then all of a sudden somebody will come with that very issue and God heals them every time it's not failed once the one time it didn't happen immediately it was because the sister said God don't heal that way she said God don't heal that way and I felt better said I knew the Lord healed her but she walked away Oh still hurting and everything and in her mind she said God don't heal that way she went home put on the tape and brother Branham says on the tape God can heal you anywhere she jumped up said praise God she was oh my leading into this oh my these signs will follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I didn't say anything about feeling a pain or having a gift or a discernment or sign in the hand or anything it just says they believe lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's why brother Branham could say reach over and take your neighbor lay your hand on your neighbor there and pray a group prayer he said and then come back weeks later he said the testimonies would just come rolling in rolling in of all the people that got healed how many times brother man talk about the different ones about little rate Rebekah setting up there seeing that woman that need to be prayed for and said she needed it but she couldn't get up she couldn't raise her hand said daddy you couldn't see her no way and so he said she had such a burden on her heart said the very next night she brother Branham called round could even see her so where she was said she got she had a prayer car but she couldn't something hit maybe she didn't get a repair Kardon and she couldn't be seen but brother BAM still called her out because of Rebecca's prayer so now as I get ready to close these signs signpost brother Graham called him these kind of things they were to get the bear said what was it it was the healing was given as the bait on the hook he said they see the bait they take the bait and you get him with the hook so the healing and all these things all this the supernatural and so forth that there's many that saw those things that never ever serve God brother Bennett said that many times believers would come through the the the prayer line and not get healed he said but prostitutes could come and they would leave healed and never give their heart to the Lord he said that's when he had to change his ministry why because people would operate in faith and get healing but what was the greater healing was the salvation of your soul because Abraham said over and over he said a person can get healed today and die and go to hell tomorrow or that same disease can come back on him they'll die later of the same disease because they they they didn't do what the scripture showed them so it was more important to get right with God than any other thing now in the days of the voice brother Branham makes a statement he says now the words of Jesus it was referring back to the words when he spoke to the rich young ruler and said follow me he said those words are going around the earth and they've never stopped they said and those words come to each and every one of us so those words are still being uttered through the scripture through the preaching through the he said they're just in the out there and the Airways that we have a machine now that can pick it up and call it radio and TV so forth but in that in that dimensional room this word follow me is still out there it's still going around and around the earth every word that Jesus spoke is still out there going around the earth every sermon that every gospel preacher has ever preached is still out there going around the earth that day it's just still going and going and going brother Brown said that every a wicked thing that you ever thought Amen is out there on a magnetic tape he said the Bible says that you'll have to give an account for every idle word you've ever spoken it's still out there it's going around and around and around and he said on that great magnetic tape in that day he said it'll be played back to you I got quiet that's what he said the Bible said Jesus said it argue with him and so now then there's so so so because of that then when those prayers those that I'm just I'm pointing to something here this is like I said it's loaded because those prayers those blanket prayers that brother Branham prayed as a seventh messenger which is identified in the scripture that said in the days of the voice and so now then we don't have the means to play back the words of Jesus all we have is just the Bible record of it but there's many sermons that Jesus preached that we'll never hear just read over there in the pen I think it's John 4 where he goes over to Samaria and he discerns the thought of the of the of the of the Samaritan woman remember the story he tells her all that was in her heart and everything she never doubted about how many husbands that she had and she says sir I believe you're a prophet he says that's true he said women Messiah cometh he'll do these things that are me the Bible says she left her waterpot she went down into the city remember the story the part you probably don't remember because you just got the part of the broom tells but she went down into the city brother and said the whole town got converted secondarily from her testimony all right so she went down there the town comes out believes on the Lord Jesus because of her testimony but then the Bible says I bet you don't remember this that he they constrained him to stay with them he constrained that they constrained him to stay with him and he stayed two more days and went after two days of preaching to him then they said we believe not because of the woman's testimony but because of what he said [Applause] Oh hallelujah let me tell you those words are still going around the world What did he say I don't know but whatever it was it made them people believe hallelujah and so now my thought is we're getting back to basics here because we need it well sometimes we just get so caught up in the ethereal and you know we get it we get so afraid of of what the devil's throwing on us and you know conspiracy and global warming and you know and all these things well we've proven infallibly by the Word of God that there is global warming amen it's not a new doctrine it's been around for a long time Peter said that the earth shall burn with fervent Heat global warming the Bible says and when that fourth angel loses amen he's going to he's going to let his plague out on the Sun he's going to burn the people that's global warming sound like to me I'm just not going to be here to see it but we'll walk out on the ashes amen after it's all over so so in the days of the voice this voice is continuing it goes around the world it's playing every day somebody's house is playing one of these tapes but what I thought was God spoke to the Prophet and told him if you can get the people to believe nothing will stand in the way of your prayer and I thought well we go over into John 17 and we read Jesus's prayer and it's still in effect we read a sermon and the sermon is still in effect what about a prayer are those prayers still in effect I say they are I say they have to be because he said in the days of the voice and that voice is still playing he said rapturing faith lays and those messages what was it it was when he began to pray for the people and they got well in there but now we're playing the tape back just like we read the Bible back we read the Bible back we hear a sermon preached we get faith it raises our faith we receive our promise we get healed we get delivered we get set free we get saved we get it whatever we come for whatever your uh your how does he say that the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass in your life that's not poetic license friend that's the Sante Lord hallelujah so then the prophet comes and he says Heavenly Father oh it's a prayer he's praying he doesn't call anybody by name here it's just a blanket prayer and if you can believe it today this same prayer is in effect it's the Great Commission if you can believe that God sent a prophet and that Malachi 4 and revelations 10 was for you and you can believe than anything that that prophet said we'll come to pass in your life Patti right did it he wasn't quoting scripture he was just telling about a personal testimony she said that ain't nothin but the truth and God spoke out of her if you can believe like she believed God will speak out of you too Heavenly Father the hour is here he said the building's warm but it's time the time has come watch what he says I remember once our dear Lord when you looked up and said father the hour has come so if he could say the hours come and God would move on the time when the Lord Jesus spoke if you think Jesus didn't get his prayers answered hello it was God he said he always hears me yeah well brother Ram said when you pray through the blood of Jesus Christ God doesn't hear you he hears him so now who's praying you or him so God always answers his own prayers so when you pray God hears if you pray through the blood you have to hear you the hour is here the building's warm but the time has come I remember dear Lord when you looked up and said follow the hours come you Chuck we're past this time where we're already we're here to cross over Jordan the hour has come for the following the way of the church hours come the hour has come that religion would spread the world without salvation that if you've ever seen it it is now religion everywhere Muslims Hindus New Agers Christian Science my job is witnessed Mormon every all these what is it religion no salvation in it the whole you should rejoice you should be exceedingly glad you should give God praise as smarty because true religion come on your way with Salvage head with a saving grace please the hour has come for your church to rise raise out of the dust and shake herself and come to herself and realize positionally that she is the Church of the Living God and has rights over ever never well that was just good for 1952 that prayer reverberates in my say God I've been crawling around here on the earth like a worm crawling around there the devil kicked me down and beat me down lie to me and then hinder my faith and and condemn me and make me sorry for you know just even being a human all the time and I just don't know if I could even get up sometimes I look at the mirror and I just see a failure all the time but I'm here to tell you it's time to shake that dust off realize positionally that she is the Church of the Living God and has rights over every death I'll just throw this in you seem to like these kind of things do you realize that in the United States when somebody is arrested for whatever the thing might be whatever case it is that it is their right to remain silent Fifth Amendment they have a right to appeal they have a right to stand before a jury or their peers that right they have a right for a lawyer and if they cannot afford a lawyer a lawyer will be appointed to me this is called Miranda you get those rights when you're arrested you get those rights but I'm here to announce this afternoon friends that I'm not arresting the devil this is not a civil disobedience it's not a traffic ticket he is an enemy combatant and enemy combatants don't get rights they get Gitmo they get they get stuck in a hole somewhere they don't get their rights or no they don't get they don't have the right to food or anything else all that saw the other you know or they call it the Geneva Convention so that's all went out the window a long time ago their enemy combatants they got one right that's a bullet that's all they get I don't have to read them their rights I don't have to accept their surrender him to do anything and I'm here to tell you the devil has an enemy combatant he's he's looking for a soul and for the souls of your children he is ruthless relentless Haman and merciless but don't you think we should we should give him his rights he has no rights brother BAM said he has no rights he forfeited his rights at Calvary amen and you have the Church of the Living God and has rights over every devil every redemptive
