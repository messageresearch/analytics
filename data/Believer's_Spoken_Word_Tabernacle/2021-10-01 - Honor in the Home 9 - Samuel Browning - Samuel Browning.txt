found him but he found us amen and we're so so thankful about that i'll tell you that never we never get over that if [Music] if we do we'd have problems amen to realize where he has brought us from and the grace that god has given to us i tell you it gives us strength for every test and every trial because that's where the real joy of the lord is based on the joy of the lord isn't based on that everything goes just exactly like we had planned or the outcome that we wanted but the joy of the lord is our strength because he is the strength of our life so that's real joy and that's a joy that the world didn't give and the world can't take away amen and he made a way that we could have that joy and have it overflowing in our lives amen good to see brother brian and sister moriah here amen so thankful for god's grace and bringing them i want to uh mention to you i received here just a text over the weekend for brother homer longoria brother homer's not going to be able he just felt like he wasn't going to be able to make it because he's had a number of um funerals to do and over the past a month and so uh we're not gonna go with those with those meetings which was this coming which was been next weekend so i i still want to want brother homer to come i try to say i still want you to be here so um you know and there's been some very close to him that um that he has lost so um we'll just lord really make arrangements for that you'll be in prayer for that um as you're turning in your scriptures i'm just going to make an announcement that way i have just some of the time here let's turn to first corinthians 13. and just as you're turning there just to make an announcement here i just just just received this on my desk here today and that is over a brother paul lafontaine's there brother cadre diggs is going to be there this saturday at 6 00 p.m so that's i just just received that on the desk and i want to make you aware of that and then also uh brother jeff snodgrass he's going to be having meetings here and uh brother daryl ward will be ministering there on friday october 15th through the 17th so i i'll have these can be posted in the in the restroom there brother brian you mind taking these and then after servicing just post them there please that way they're not forgotten about and then if you be in the men's restroom if you need to you know you can always add maybe ask one of the brothers to if you need to get the information off of it or something we can get that uh to you and uh so let's look here in the in the word of the lord here in 1st corinthians chapter 13 and verse 4 and i'm just going to read these two verses of scripture and then we'll let you have your seats and first in verse 4 charity suffereth long and is kind and charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself and is not puffed up and it does not behave itself unseemly and that's where we really want to continue to draw from it does not behave itself unseemly amen let's just put our heads in order of prayer heavenly father lord jesus as we have lord gathered here tonight lord how thankful we are for your mercy and your grace lord you lord allow us lord to just be able to have this opportunity to come together lord and to worship you father with brothers and sisters of like precious faith i know there's those lord that are tuning in by way of the internet too and i just pray that lord that your spirit o god would just minister lord to the seen and unseen audience lord may you speak to our hearts in a very personal way lord we just want to invite you lord because we just don't want to have just lord a gathering we desire that you would just come and speak to us lord and even as the word is coming forth lord our worship has not ceased but our worship is even as the word itself lord is moving lord and discerning dealing with our life giving guidance giving leadership and life being imparted oh god lord we just ask that lord you'll have your way in this service help us lord i pray for these next few moments just to step aside oh god lord to enter into the realms lord of eternity oh god and to draw strength from you lord may we just look to you for no matter what lord's situation it is we know that you are the answer o god and lord we just look to you now father we give ourselves to you ask that if we've said or done or entertained any thought or anything that would be displeasing to you forgive us father we pray and may you just have full preeminence now lord in this service for your glory we ask him in jesus name amen amen god bless you as you're being seated i just lord willing here i want to i'm not going to do it tonight but lord willing i want to have some of the brothers when we went there to the men's meeting and i'll probably speak a little bit more about that at the beginning of sunday's service but it was certainly a real refreshing and rewarding time that we had there together and just just a great uh a great time fellowship around the word you know when you consider it and i know there's some others that's been there as well you have all together seven services in three days so that's saturday is just you you get up on saturday and saturday it's non-stop and so we just we had just such a wonderful time god was so gracious uh even through the ministering of the word i really appreciate your prayers and just to see how that god just just moved so marvelously among us there and i know that the brothers that that we had just such a wonderful trip down there and we had a good we had a good trip back as well and uh yeah we thank god for safe traveling mercies and the only snafu or hang up we had was going through a state where everything was locked down and closed and you know trying to find somewhere to eat you know and you just boy i said we're already being put to the test right after this meeting [Laughter] i mean may god help us you know you start thinking maybe we should have went the other way down back that we came down you know but uh god was so so good to us and and um so we just we really thank the lord for his mercy and his grace you know um one of the things that i we even when i think of it in the time and the hour that we're living in and i don't know how god will we'll take it even in coming services but i i would say this one thing that i put before the brethren down there in speaking in some of the sessions there is that we're living in a time that we what we are seeing in this generation is the actual product or manifestation of where the prophet by inspiration could see the outcome of the seeds that were being sown back there we're not seeing seeds now we're seeing the product this is harvest time and not just wheat all is coming to harvest everything is coming to maturity and so with that in mind the ways that i i look just being pressed of the lord to look at it that we we cannot as take anything for granted and just take it in a manner then well this will just come automatically this will just come this way or this but satan is very subtle and yet he's very intentional in all he does he's got a motive and he's got his objective brother bram tells us how he studies our life and he waits for just a moment he waits to see where is that word at in our lives and so my my challenge not only to the brethren there but i just bring it here forward tonight is that if satan as he is intentional we are to be very intentional we we're to be i mean it things that we we do uh the things that's just like how god would has has led us and we're dealing with these things even within first corinthians 13 and how the holy spirit been dealing with it in terms of of the marriage covenant and those things like that it is a time of great intention it's nothing to be assumed because when because this this is the mind of god this is god's mind the prophet tells us in written form now it takes the holy spirit to bring this to life to where we can read a verse but when god gets a hold of it it's no longer just a verse it becomes a living reality that we are standing in front of and there is an examination that takes place in our life or should be a reflection that we take inventory and say lord i see a lack here i'm asking for strength that that might be made flesh in my life lord let it drop down from just my knowledge of agreeing or just saying that is true but let it drop from my head down into my heart let it come into that place to where it's no longer conscience but it's subconscious and that's why we need as the word is ministered before us we need the living reality of jesus christ because god comes to fulfill his word he's the one that puts upon the garments of his word and makes them manifest to you and i and so when we we look at this here in the scriptures in first corinthians 13 and i want to just move very quickly into where we were dealing the very the last time on thursday we were together and we were drawing out of out of ephesians 5 and which we have been with that of a of a husband and a wife and i want to just say it in this which i've said it over and over but it behooves to be reminded in this time paul is writing to believers in ephesians 5. there's other scriptures there's other parts that pertain to one who has a believing spouse and to one that and and this other the spouse is not a believer there's writings for that and paul takes into account knowing that there will be situations like that as well but i i believe with all of my heart that even within those situations like that i believe when we look at ephesians 5 just like when we read first corinthians 13 there's something about the word of god it comes and it challenges our life you know we just don't want to say amen to it because it's the right thing to say and say well yeah i agree with it amen by agreeance i know but we want to say amen so be it in my life let there be a so be it because there's the promise of what we inherit if we will bless ourselves in the god of the amen that is that in the scriptures as it lays there so we want to take him inventory of the word and and this is the way that i believe we should approach it in ephesians 5 is just as that's to be a reflection of christ and the bride and then in the earthly uh between believers a husband and wife it should be our prayer even as a husband to say lord let me be the kind of husband that you are to your bride there's no better example this trumps every book from christian bookstore i'm not against books you understand i'm not against books i know some go i'm not but but i am against this right here because everything that's there it ought to come through the filter of god's word because there's a lot of psych that's out there that all it is is psych and let me tell you something there's a lot of good principles but those principles do nothing if there's not the operation of the holy ghost on the inside to bring it to fruition in our life so i believe that paul is he's dealing with this that as a husband and wife not only this reflection is to be but there is victory that within this life there's a testimony that even as the wife can actually go to the lord in prayer and say lord let me be that wife as your wife as the brightest unto you let me be that way o god see we were looking at psalms 23 and i want to just move back into that because those three psalms of psalms 22 23 and 24 when we look at those psalms right there we see that the very the very uh first psalm when we look at it it's it's here it writes of of of the messiah as he's giving his life for the sheep my bones my bones they stare at me you know the scriptures then it's then it goes in the same psalm to the rising i will declare thy name unto the brethren so in order for the rising to come into that place of victory there had to be a giving a dying a yielding first and then when it rises to that place then we come into psalms 23 which is where you and i walk here in a union with the lord jesus christ and this is a psalm of great care because he gave his life he rose again now we share his life we are joint heirs as i write so now being joined heirs then he is there to provide and care for her every need and then when it's all said and done psalms 24 open up ye everlasting gates what is it all of this down here now makes way for the position but that position there is reflected in its care it's reflected in the giving and the healing see over there in psalms 24 it's not just a time that oh this is reflected in psalms 24 no that king is reflected through psalms 22 and psalms 23. so i look at this in psalms 23 and what a what a psalm you know many times the only time that people read this psalm they think about funerals you know wow this is a funeral song no this is i look at psalms 23 and and i'm just going how god just so inspired it to my heart this is a psalm that deals with marriage this is a psalm that deals with a husband and a wife this is a psalm that deals with a home this is a psalm that deals with the believer and his shepherd oh glory the word holds application in all seasons of our life psalms 23 1. let's just jump right back in there the lord is my shepherd and i i shall not want is satisfied completely there's no question there should be no question in our life whether god loves us or not as a matter of fact god wants to make sure you and i he just doesn't say you know what i told you that a year ago or i told you that last week he desires to make his love known to you and i it's not a love that suffers just being poured out are you hearing me it's reality that his love because why that brings stability in our lives it brings strength in our lives this is why when we look at this the bible you know would say that for those who fear him there's no want in him and i know these are scriptures these you know as husbands and things can look at and say my you know as we said last week these are big shoes to fill but remember i would take this approach just as from my heart to say god let me be this kind of a man i didn't preach this there to men's meaning this is here but let me be this kind of a man let me be this kind that lord that that is a shepherd that's because a shepherd is one who is looking out for looking not only for things present but for things to come and see that's totally contrary with the spirit of this age the spirit of this age is i'll i will stay in my world you're in your world how do we know what's in your world text me find out text me or maybe tweet me or instagram me but you're sitting on the chair and i'm on the sofa well this is our world that's not how that's not how that a home is to operate in two separate worlds is to operate in one union [Music] we're walking here aren't we he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters let me just stop here for a moment and say this when the word of god comes across to our path we have got a decision anytime you're open you become vulnerable are you hearing me now anytime you're open you become vulnerable this is why many times people look at the word and they'll run from it now they can sit right here but they run from it they close off and won't allow the word to evaluate their life why because when you become open you become vulnerable and whether we open ourselves or not the bible says in hebrews chapter 4 we stand naked before him all things are open before him so what should i do i would just open and say lord you're the one examining me i'm not here to make excuses i'm here i want to align with the word don't make excuses if they're saying the word showing up i will allow myself because when we say being vulnerable you're not in the presence of a condemour we are in the presence of our high priest one who can move for us on our behalf who wants to speak to us in a very personal way i say that's a great quality in this hour to be able to be open that's a great quality that's one of the things if you understand as as him as our husband that's one of the things that brings security in our life because he's so open with us he doesn't hold anything back he shows every little thing in our life he doesn't smooth things over what what is that that's openness it's honesty and it brings confidence because that's what that's what one thing that really it brings strength to us as the bride of jesus christ because we know he says things honest and openly even when it cuts so when he says i love you you're the apple of my eye i have trust in that because i see here he's truthful in all things he's open and honest [Music] he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he's faithful in all his care he takes god think about it brother battle would take a message things that ought to be and speak of that message dealing with how our life has come here under the pre-planning of god the forethought he'll wrap in the scriptures of of john 14 i go away to prepare a place and he begins to do the whole when we look at that he's dealing with it god made that there are certain things that you would like here mountains or planes or whatever it is that that you enjoy that you like god knew you would like those and he seen that all of that topography would be set in a certain way and then brother branham takes us and says if god so pre-planned your birth naturally and even knowing these things that you would like to see that they are set up here in this earth then how much more has he made preparation for you to come back into that mansion that body that theophany that place with him with union god has already made provision he's a god it boils it down to this right here god is one who works in preparation he's mindful and i tell you when i look at that in the scripture right now we this is a challenging thing for us because sometimes we feel like let's just be honest we're just glad that we've made it nine o'clock time for bed let's just be honest there's sometimes with the days and with things that go through in the day we're tired we're weary let me tell you something every demon out of hell has been released revelations chapter nine it is forces that are coming against us not just laws there's demonic spirits that are coming every single day that you're battling you're fighting through you're overcoming you're persevering and your soul don't get weak but your spirit and your body gets weak is that right but god knowing then all of these things he provides he works he works to provide care and that's where i i love that that we can look to the lord and say oh god help me lord to really to see that preparation to see those things lord that that can be done because you see when we look at a shepherd and sheep i want you to recall in ii samuel 12 3 this is nathan standing before david after david took bathsheba uriah's wife and once you just the the thing that i want you to focus on is not what i just mentioned i want you to focus on how god likens bathsheba in this quote the wife he said the poor man had nothing save one little you lamb but this was his this was his wife but notice not just a grown you one little you lamb so still the treatment with great delicacy oh my which he had brought and nourished up notice he brought and nourished them and he grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter that's a term of endearment in the scripture for a husband to refer it's a term of endear so so how god has referred this in this leadership now coming back to the scripture where we we we stopped last week in psalms 23 3 he restoreth my soul and truly we can say there's only one that could restore our soul to the right position and that's our shepherd he came to lead us to that place and it wasn't something out here it was actually a yielding to where the blood would reach the innermost part of our life to where now his presence now it's it's it's agape love that has worked on us the love of god but the love of god works even on our filial love to where we love god we begin to respond to the things of the lord but if that is all under the influence of agape love until agape love the holy ghost sets down on the holiest of holies so it's under see the baptism of the holy ghost is the love of god the seal of god upon our soul and how is it all working it's not our love doing it we love him because he first loved us it's his love the spirit of god brooding over us bringing us to this place of complete surrender because the holy ghost does not come without complete surrender you see that's why in reality the baptism of the holy ghost is very simple to receive it's very simple repent that's full surrender this will surrender full dying out him comes he'll come when it's according to his word he'll always come every when the pattern of the word is followed he comes he came in moses temple came in solomon's temple it's very simple repent repent means die you abort that old life see that's why the tears can be shed but yet god's not looking at our tears because if god was looking at the tears many people would have received it god's not looking at the tears he's looking at the heart because that's the place that faith must move in order for him to receive himself inside it's all his work because that inside is the real temple of almighty god he restored my soul and yet as we're looking that there are times that we see in our life we go through it as an assembly we go through it in marriage we go through an individual walk there's times we we'd love to stay on the mountain all the time we would love to but there's times we get weary and it's not weary oh we're being sinful the bible says be you not weary in well-doing i'm gonna ask you to raise your hand but sometimes there's been things that you feel like i you know what i really feel like i'm doing the right thing but it seems like everything else is going the opposite way what should i do be not weary in well-doing what does that mean it means keep doing what is the right thing to do don't ever give up on the word because the word can't fail [Applause] amen he restoreth my soul notice let me just make you i take a few scriptures here uh of how that when we look at even in our home and our marriages and even in our life when we even come to the house of god when we're around one another as brothers and sisters this should be our testimony and when i say that when i read it don't don't all of a sudden shrink down in your seat but we want to read it and then let's look into the avenue that god has provided that this can be in our life philemon chapter well there's only one chapter this is the personal letter that's wrote on behalf of onesimus back to philemon remember niecemas is the one who ran away paul and he runs and paul sees him and he now becomes a son of the gospel he becomes fully converted he becomes uh one that paul could have such such confidence in and now onesimus runs back with a message in his hand that in a quote he's now it says this is me i've been pardoned so philemon now notice notice the greeting concerning philemon for we have great joy and consolation and thy love because the bowels the the innermost parts of the saints are refreshed by the brother it's nice to get around refreshing people isn't it that's wonderful second corinthians 7 13 and these are just a few places here but with with the definition that i want to look at therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we were for the joy of titus now paul's in the midst of a test and trial here right now and he's saying this is where we were we were joined because his spirit tituses his spirit was refreshed by you all our spirit needs refreshment the real place of refreshing is behind the inner veil but that refreshing has a conduit and a channel to affect others is that right brother bram says you've been around sometimes good people and you're you're around them and they're good people after you're there's an atmosphere that's about them that's just maybe they're good people but they're very condescending not something that maybe say but you just catch it in their spirit man are you hearing me it's an atmosphere brother ben tells us that you create an atmosphere by the things you think on right so then in order to be refreshed when we look at this it's to um the the the scripture says to or the definition says to cause or permit one to cease from any movement or labor in order to recover and collect his strength to give rest refresh to give oneself rest to take rest to keep quiet of calm and patient expectation [Music] lord i need a refreshing [Music] at some time we just have to be honest you know what i need a refreshing. you know there's times that they and listen these are things that we we should be asking for lord i need a refilling of the holy ghost it's one filling with many refillings by the same i just asked him for a refilling yesterday asking for another one today it's a daily walk brother says this in another place in the message he says when you begin to feel like the buckle and the armor is kind of slacking down he said take the buckle and tighten it up and ask god for a refilling of the holy ghost it's a refreshing in his presence that's what caused aaron's rod to move from a dead rod to one that butted blossomed and produced almonds it was the place of refreshing so this is where brother adam will say in the messi's divine love what type of people aren't we to be if we're a christian what type of atmosphere should we live in now i want you i'm just i'm speaking this very plainly the gospel does not give any um superscript letter that states this can only be if so-and-so's living in victory nobody else's life should be a determination on whether you walk in victory this is the hour as the bible says in the book of isaiah i understand sometimes there's things that's very close to you you feel the breath they're right beside you or one ever more it's very close but this is the hour as it says see she from man whose breath is in his nostrils it's one recognizing this that there is a mighty god that is present to influence and direct our lives understand these are things that what a privilege we have sometimes you know the devil is mastery at trying to make us feel hopeless you come into a situation or something you're wanting to change and he then brings it in sense to where it's now you looking at it through your finite eyes and how this can be i'm telling you that's impossible through our finite eyes but when we can look through the eyes of god get in the atmosphere of the holy spirit brother it opens up the impossibilities to where it becomes possible to us as believers [Music] brother man so what type of people are we to be if we're a christian what type of an atmosphere should we live in look what he says this is the kind of atmosphere we should live in in a consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in notice live in with our heart see this is why the enemy battles at you satan remember he's intentional this is why here you are getting ready to get off work and then somebody has to say something this rumor has to come about because you were thinking man when i get out of here whoo i'm gonna have a nice refreshing bath in the car cleansing of all the critical spirits and everything else has been around and here i am to walk in my priestly garments and my i'm just going to have a man it's going to be a wonderful evening and all the and satan knows just how to put that board in the spoke of your bicycle so we're not ignorant of that but at the same time knowing knowing you know there's things that you begin to learn hey you know what you begin to learn things like sunday morning like oh well i'm always late for church oh why am i is this for church oh i'm at this for church you know what these are times where we have to really be at sons and daughters of god oh my i don't know what the ground we're gonna walk on right now it's just coming fresh and we're just going to take it it's all organic and it's packed with vitamins and minerals sometimes we look at things like that instead of just looking and saying now wait a minute what can be done so we're not in this predicament come on now i mean if you're in a predicament when it comes dinner time you start saying wait a minute here what can we do i know we do honey we'll put on a slow cooker meal on tuesdays that may we got dinner when it's time for dinner what are you doing you're taking away a preparation that should be the same thing not just come into the house of god you ought to look at what can i do it's the same thing when it comes to things that you know where the enemy wants to trip you up or whatever more you can look at that guy coming across the plant and say adios buddy i see you tomorrow because you know when that guy comes you know he's packing something you understand i mean i've told you this many times there when when i was there in teaching i kept a folder on my desk that had papers in it what were they nothing nothing those you work in office and teaching look you know you got you got people that come at the end of their time what do they do they come and what they want to do is run down the boss run down this why do we have to do this why do we they didn't get nothing done so i kept that stack of things i could hear some of them coming down the hall i took that stat that folder had nothing and no papers of importance and i just walked out of my my man what are you gonna do i'm heading to the copy room brother samuel that's acting but it got me out of that stuff come on now we know people the bible's looking look at this let's apply this also in all things the bible said know them that labor among you we should know those things even among our workplace you know here comes the gossiper here comes a critic no i don't know we're just going what time you see this is victory of what kind of atmosphere we should live in this is where we as sons and daughters of god are reigning over situations reigning in maturity remember brother graham says overcoming is recognizing the devil at every one of his tricks what type of atmosphere we should live in in a soothing consoling soothing healing atmosphere we should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer how do i say constantly in prayer paul said pray without ceasing how do i pray without ceasing because prayer is not a is not the position of your body it's the frustration of your heart you can be praying right there in the car i'm not saying that we don't we all know we need our times alone with god but i'm just going to say it like this don't limit it to where oh i've got to be in my prayer closet here or this bedroom or i've got to be right here pray pray without ceasing when there's things that comes to you offer up to god in prayer just ask god lord guide me today watch over me today you say what are you doing as a son of god you're inviting the atmosphere of the holy spirit down to say lord i want to live in that healing consoling atmosphere i want that to radiate from my life so i'm inviting you who is the influence of my life lord let it be the atmosphere here it's raining the sons and daughters of god it's not letting the devil turn around and beat you back this way well you're not living up to that you're not it's taking the channel to the word and say this is my god-given right as a son and daughter of god and devil you are exposed psalms 23 3 let me read the next part here [Music] he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake so the paths that he chooses the path he's leading me and these are paths of righteousness for his namesake no this is it says this is complete responsibility this is complete ownership you see when the fall took place in in eden as soon as sin came in soon as sin came in it began to pass the buck she gave to me so he wasn't protected lord you know the one that you had me call and go over you know and speak to her youth can't this this one [Music] don't you lord the woman thou gave us me he trusts he tried to do put it back on god come on listen let's just be honest it's within our nature to deflect i'm not talking about our our our our new birth i'm talking about in that old nature that first nature that sticky part that we still have it's in our nature to deflect [Music] i mean it's so much in this age right now that the person robbing the store they blame the police for being there and they did it if you hadn't been here i wouldn't got caught if you didn't have these cameras [Music] proverbs 13 3 you see because the leadership that even as as a as brethren and even the pastor on and on and on and on that we have to seek for is for the wisdom of almighty god and this is why look how that it would speak of how that wisdom and i want you to catch this remember how solomon would write by inspiration concerning wisdom he never writes of wisdom as being the masculine he writes it as the feminine because it comes you see revelation is not something that's forced a man is not even to be for it's it's something that's to be very open and delicate and received [Music] are you with me brother brown takes out i think it's question answers 54 he speaks about how he says people are studying and studying and studying you know in the book ecclesiastes does much study worries and brother brahman says you forget back he said a lot of that studying and he talks about where it takes people and then brother rhymes and talmud don't study but what he's dealing with is people as a person just study study study and he says you're forgetting to yield to him in love and that's what it is it's yielding to him in love so these ways the paths of righteousness here's what these paths of righteousness are proverbs 13 3 13 and then i'm going to go to verse 17. happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that gideth understanding verse 17. her ways this is wisdom her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace so the paths of righteousness are ways of pleasantness and paths of peace i want you to just to catch this here just to really be very mindful of this part it's very very very important reflecting the right leadership in our homes regarding each situation is very very important because the wife she's the moon and she's going to reflect the light when the sun is absent i never forget this before i was married i never forget i was listening to um i was in a camp meeting brother harold hildebrand was ministering back in 95. and uh he he was and he talked about how he was referring to this right here and how the wife is like the moon and he was talking about a situation you know that uh you know that had taken place and some things maybe that have been said about him or this or that and the wife knew about it maybe this brother was contentious or whatever more so the wife knew about it well then some years later then you know this brother had come everything was able to be smoothed out man i mean they were just but he said one thing he said that when i my wife my wife saw this brother what she remembered is that that contention in what had been in the past she wasn't aware of those things the restitution that had been made so she was still reflecting what light had been emitted previously you see this is why it is very it's very very important this is why i just i'm just going to follow him this is why even when the bible says let not the left know what the right is doing or the right not the left you know what i'm saying don't you we we don't go about and do that this is why even in a family in a home you know it's not to take things and entrust it to somebody else for example nobody should know the weaknesses of your husband but you nobody should know the weaknesses of your wife but you sometimes and listen i'm speaking now to even of the flesh that exists because sometimes the flesh can't handle that the flesh will remember that come on blood's thicker than water i've seen it i mean not any phrase i've seen it i've seen it you see the the thing that then you say well brother simon what are you saying within that i'm saying that just the bible says love coverth a multitude of sin the love is to be that to where not only it covers but it puts the best light forward this is why there's things that if some that if a person or family leaves the church i'm not going into anything with anybody you say why would you do that because if they would ever to come back to visit or come back here i don't want that on the minds of the people well i know so and so does it that's up to them every church is sovereign but for me there's some things it's nobody's business because why i don't want anything troubled i don't want you i don't want to tutor your perception to change concerning any brother or any sister oh brother samuel i have the love of god and then nobody's questioning that we're not going to question that but there's things that we have to operate in wisdom right so you see this is why this reflection of light it should be like the prophets of old remember what god how the prophet identified the prophets he called them reflectors of god's light and the seven stars are in his right hand power and authority headship hold what does it do it emits light to scatter darkness so then the entrustment is is that that our lives reflecting the right leadership that tends to righteousness not bitterness grudges discord but promotes unity the bible says for a man i i could go on that point for a while but i'm not going to in first corinthians 11 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man see the sun and moon relationship first corinthians 11 1 we were talking about he leadeth me paul could write be your followers of me even as i also am of christ so paul was saying you follow me to the degree that i'm following christ so it's not just following me but it's the following as i follow christ that's the real confidence that's the stability this is the path of righteousness because you see there's a lot of things in paths of righteousness that we can look at that a lot of things can come up with even in a home let me say this like this you know it's not hard to lead when everything is you know hitting on the right cylinders but now becomes a challenge when adversity strikes the home maybe a son or daughter or something's not going right on the job or a teacher or a professor or or something else now it becomes a crucial that you lead in adversity and leadership in adversity is not taking the side of leadership is lead through god does it we'll see as we go on god doesn't remove us from tests from trials from adversity he leads us through brother brahma says oh god give me grace to go through it you say why because it's crucial now because later on in life it's not just now it's later on in life that if it's not led in the right way if the wife is not lit in the right way then maybe there's words that are said things that come in to the home maybe a sister or there's a disagreement or whatever it's crucial leadership is needed at that moment at that time to guide even the thoughts to guide it in a place of restitution to guide it in a place of giving a place and understanding to work with that why because you're inviting peace is that all right so this is where in our lives we are all oh boy brother branham like he puts it there in the latter part of 65 we come here with a human grab bag we get all that i mean we you know it's like we're pound full in our first birth of junk i know everyone has got pride about our last name order more but you know what your your last name like my last frame is full of rottnest and junk and we're all made out of the same calcium potash petroleum it's not putting anybody down it's recognizing that our inadequacies that oh we're not superior we we do things this way good somebody else does things another way god has all varieties in his kingdom and they're all needed right so you see these are things that we have to evaluate in our life this is part of the word dealing in our life that even as husbands and in our home as leaders as pastor any place of leadership we don't want complexes sown so we need the discernment of the holy spirit that there listen nobody walks around and says you know what i got a complex [Music] no think how the prophet felt when that was made known to him what it was he didn't know what it was at first are you hearing me he preached the seals with that complex come on now he preached the seals then he takes messages like humble thyself not a doctrinal message it's instruction standing in the gap instruction standing in the gap it's a life that's lived when something is dead wrong but you hold to that what's right and you be the breach that fills the gap he's standing in that message and how he says he feels in that message go back and listen to the first part of it how he feels he said i'm in the place right now that's something going downstream he said i could stand and laugh at it told you so i'm not making you understand this but see you one thing about you find one this is one thing i love there's many things i love but and one thing with the message brother branham reflects i take that example he reflects in his life he didn't everything that man everything i do is like glaze you know on krispy kreme donuts and it's smooth and it's tasty and it's i tell you this and that sure god spoke to him a lot but he reflected in his life that's why i can follow a man like that because he was dead honest he didn't put the blame on everybody else he took responsibility when he stood there and he saw the preview of the bride listen to the words when he saw that church of america he said i was ashamed and i said to god is that the best we can do he never said these sorry preachers out here and this and that he was a man of reflection why god this was a man a son coming to maturity a wave sheet to show that real sons and daughters of god will reflect they'll take the counsel the word because they want to align with the word more than anything else [Music] not through complexes we don't want to sow complexes in because you find one complex can be passed to another generation [Music] my friend let's not look outside we can do that i'm talking about inwardly i'm talking about when what did you say what a second what i do well it isn't something you go around and say god show me my complex god show me all my no what it is when the word is dealing with our life it's dealing with our life if there's complexes that's had that it's always you know everybody's out to get me everybody's like that's a complex you need god to resolve that god's not out to get you oh my brother's out to get me my brother's saying this my sister oh yes i do i know it i know it i know it no that's a complex and a complex is operated by a spirit and it's not the holy spirit and remember that spirits itself sown are the germ within seeds that's why we have to be careful what we sow for what god's not mocked whatsoever a man soweth judge shall he also reap is that right this is why my goodness i said my goodness because i'm looking i'm looking at time proverbs 11 18 this is why when the bible says the wicked worketh at the deceitful work but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward you see paul would write about you know even the things that we're to think on thinking about atmosphere he would write about that in philippians 4 8 then going to philippians 4 9 notice what paul how paul would speak concerning leadership here those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do so paul would say paul could say like this he said paul's saying i'm not saying do as i say i'm asking you to do as i do come follow me see that's it's an invitation come follow me be followers of me as i also am of christ and the god of peace shall be with you all so this this part here let me let me my my my my let me try to to to to wrap this this this part up right here [Music] this is very imperative in leadership and what i'm going to just deal with here just a few moments in what we're looking at the paths of righteousness he leadeth me because his leading is very gentle it's not forceful it's not a demand but his leadership is is an invitation to you and i it's what's a provision for you and i i'm not this isn't painting got up to be you know powdered sugar and maple syrup and that's not what i'm saying because we realize he corrects us he lets us know if if something's wrong because we're a reflection of him and he can say that's not my attitude concerning that you're the moon i'm the sun and the sun's an attitude is not that attitude so we need to get this right here you need to reflect the right light so he's quick to to to help us on that and one of the greatest ways like as paul would write husbands love your wives even as christ who loved the church and gave himself for it even as so it's very imperative in leadership true leadership is responsible for creating an atmosphere of confidence trust and faith i want you to notice of how uh in in isaiah 62 and you just just give me just a few moments here in isaiah 62 verse 4 this is god bringing israel back home 144 000 but it also speaks spiritually of the bride too because there's a land that we were out of and god brought us back into the land of the holy ghost he's brought us back into this place thou shalt no more be turned forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hepsidha and thy land beulah which means married for the lord delighteth in thee in thy land shall be married so the land was laying there but now when the right people get back into the right place then there's an expression of the union of the glory that belongs to the people of god just like in our lives when we get into the right place get in christ then thy land shall be called married it begins to the word itself is now living in flesh for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee so that that that word that land that's coming into view thy sons shall unite with it as the bridegroom rejoiceth and this is what i want you to take in the bride as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee you think god delights in you well you better believe it he said you're the apple of my eye oh he's he's known he's watched over us clear back from the mind of god we were in his loins all coming all the way down he made sure this one would come together with this one it might look like this is not going to happen but god said there's got to be this king of the bell got to be that certain ting of the bell ting because remember you you didn't your parents or you did not give yourself the seed but remember even when we look at our temperaments and our makeups and all those things like that god had such an arrangement god oh my he's over it all he's watching over it all my goodness and we have a few things to make out for the insurance company in our hair well those i have there it's all frazzled god's got all this notice problem you see this is part of leadership proverbs 5 18 let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth let her be as the loving hind and pleasant row and let her breaths and breath satisfy thee and all times and be thou ravished always with her love notice with her love remember brother brown talks about the older couple and he's doing i think a renewal and he told brother brown he says she's just as beautiful as ever and she said he's just as handsome as ever and of course the older brother brother brahm tells it on tape he said the older brother says you know he said of course my eyes are not as good as they used to [Music] brother ever had a way of telling things he could get away with it you know you know there's things that brother brown had but you see what it is thy love be thou ravished always with her love in the message you must be born again brother braham says he speaks of he says a woman he said take another man in your arm you marred the mold that you were taken from remember that when you act like a man you're out of your place and when man begins to get too let me just stop here for a moment act like a man and you're out of your place remember let me let me just deal with this that comes to me remember ahab you remember ahab ahab was a spoiled brat [Music] maybe we shouldn't i don't know where these footnotes coming from but ahab seen something that he couldn't have is my lip pooched out enough [Music] nabot wouldn't sell me his vineyard i want his vineyard i want it i want it i've always got what i got when i wanted it daddy always got it for me mama always got it for me brother bram said you take a man like that or marry he'll make life hell on earth that's a direct quote because that's the kind of leadership he's exacting i always get what i want i always get what i want it's got to be my way it's it's gone so he pounced see he's out of his place so here she steps forward [Music] oh darling they won't give that to you i'll get it for you i'll chew him out for you see it's feminism working right there [Music] you're just going to basement and play games and i'll take care of acting out the role this is all free [Laughter] maybe we shouldn't stopped on that line right there but i'll take care of it for you oh would you honey would you take my role for me you jellyfish this is what ahab was a spoiled brat he never had the right he never got the right kind of leadership because the right kind of leadership you might have said well his daddy armory and everything else you know they wasn't all that bad brother adam tells us like this he said i know you know there's people that say they're pretty good people they don't drink they don't smoke they don't do this brother brahma said like this take this kentucky grammar the wrongest thing they could have ever done is not lead their children to christ wrongest they didn't get the right leadership so what you're doing because you get the right leadership with god let me tell you how that exhibits itself through the home it's a life of submission the children know daddy's getting his leadership from someone above it's coming down the wife knows he's getting his leadership from one who is above what does that bring security because we're not under that of flesh and blood we're under the oversight of the holy ghost oh my but you see then then jezebel steps up oh honey i'll do battle for you i know how to take people down on facebook i know how to rip them down on instagram i know honey i mean i willed a sword but i've got a tongue oh lord my i know honey you see what it is what's she doing she's out of her place cause he's out of his place come on friends there's been too many times where you see men where the where the wives is doing everything and well there will she'll go fight my battles she's not to fight your battles brother branham says she's in the battles with us sometimes just a little bit of encouragement from her ready to go he wanted nabot's vineyard see it went from wanting that matchbox car i gotta have that moves from matchbox car to a vineyard i'm a bit personal now moves from matchbox car till if he can't get what he wants when he wants it he pouts you can interpret that what is that failed leadership it didn't get corrected throwing a temper tantrum in the floor now it's a temper tantrum in the marriage oh god help us wow wrong leadership it starts young that's why brother brandon when he preaches the message leadership he says when you started out it was somebody taking you and guiding you along like that with a finger is that right teaching them how to walk let's stop here i said just a few minutes and we that quote just exploded like a roman candle on me when you act like a man you're out of your place and when man begins to get too and babying this and that and the other he's out of his place i'm trying to get out of this quote well my wife just raises the kids she's the one that does all the correction who you're not in your place you're the one who is to oversee the guidance and direction and leadership because leadership works with the vision of the future are you with me man we better stop on this quote it's the truth it's the truth brother samuel that's pretty plain intentional intentional intentional intention things aren't going to happen osmosis when you act like a man you're out of your place when a man begins to get us get to get two and babying this that and the other he's out of his place he's boss he's ruler i gotta close that because we i just feel more and more just coming as husbands and as daddies sure we want our children to love us but we want the right kind of love we want the love that brings faith and respect not a love that says well daddy's my favorite why because really what it is daddy gets me to get away with what i want to get away with no i tell you what no daddy loves to correct his children i don't care how good of a home run slugger he is nobody likes correcting their children i mean dad my dad used to tell me you're right it's gonna hurt it hurts you worse than me i'm the one feeling it i know man i'll tell you i don't know how we're getting here i know some people oh brother samuel we don't believe in the belt we don't believe in this we don't believe in this you can't take that out of scripture granted every child is different but if timeout ain't working you need a timeout and if you're counting to 10 a working and you ain't learned how to count to ten yet and they stop doing that then you don't need more math classes you need to come and take the word of god because the bible says the rod driveth the foolishness out of the heart of the child that's the scripture that's how god deals with us god didn't just take us in and say oh you're so sweet you're so lovely the bible said he that cometh to god must be chastened and proven first what is it the word begins to deal with our life to what drive the foolishness out so that he can step in oh lord [Music] my witness needs let let it just come down and just rain it's it's a wonderful presence here isn't it because you see this is our desire to line up with the word of god lord let it just let it so saturate in on my life he leads us in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake it's not always maybe the paths that we would choose and sometimes it's not the things that is the easiest it's time sometimes of adversity but that's where leadership shows it shows even in the moments of adversity the light that we're walking in what leadership evening light in this hour that we're living in it shows greater and more brighter why it's it's not just because he's here in his fullness but remember it's the contrast the darkness declares the opposition of the light it's a contrast the light is so great because the darkness also it shows it up it's so great we're living in a time of gross darkness but your light has come my light has come let me say lord i want to walk in that atmosphere i want to live in that atmosphere i want to help me to be the the right kind of leader and guide even in every in every situation no matter what it is lord help me to be under your influence for the leadership and the guidance within my life let's just pray heavenly father lord [Music] you're so mindful and you're so merciful to us lord you're so good you're so faithful lord and lord as we lord look into these things that you would open to us and you would speak so personally to our hearts lord we're challenged and as your children we look into this mirror of the word and father to be open with you because you already know i'm glad that lord that we can look to you i'm glad as sons of god as daughters of god and say lord from glory and to glory change me lord keep keep changing me lord from glory unto glory unto glory unto glory lord let it be in me lord as lord a husband could pray lord let me be as you are to your bride and the wife could say let me be as the bride is to you lord let that be reflected lord in my life oh god i'm so glad that we can go to you and father in reality we can bring that we can just speak those things that thy will be done in earth even as it is in heaven this is our desire oh god that you would have your way lord guide
