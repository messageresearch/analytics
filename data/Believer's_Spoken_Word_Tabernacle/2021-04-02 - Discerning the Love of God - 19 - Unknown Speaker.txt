that a church he said they can get their soul their spirit their mind all lined up he said you'll see a mighty church in action amen amen and i thank god that he equips us with his power by the new birth but then we can bring everything else in subjection you know it's not about our strength it's history it's about us yielding letting god do what only god can do amen don't you love him and i want you if you would let's turn in our bibles to first corinthians 13 and as you just be with the prayer self this weekend brother nathan erickson will be here this this coming weekend and willing i'll um leaving out here in north carolina here in the weekend to be there to minister for the very coffees so i just ask that you just keep us keep myself in prayer and just just have his way in those in those services down there as well and um just to remind you of the meetings that we have coming up here memorial day and i really haven't uh i haven't put anything out to really just to broadcast it and i know different brothers even of other things that other meetings myself going into it's not been really too many things that's been put out except for um you know the meeting over in brother paul's that's coming up here in april they kind of kind of put that out but as far as with the meetings here and i've got different things that will just kind of keep you posted as it goes throughout the year i've got different meetings and different things booked through the year here and um i'm just trying to do what we can to maintain things and have a little bit of control because i i want you all and everybody else who's part of this assembly uh i may be a little bit selfish but i i'm having the meetings for us right here so i want to give i want to give right here the congregation preference here even within the seating and things so um right now there are just some things we're just praying about and looking at that with the memorial day meetings coming up you know brother andrew will be here so just keep that in prayer if you would okay and we'll just want to continue to stay in prayer with everything that's um around us and things like that and just asking god that he'll just continue to guide us let's just let's look here in the scripture and maybe before we read it let's just let's ask his blessing here heavenly father lord jesus how we love you lord we just appreciate you and lord we are just in need of you lord tonight we need you lord and we desire that you would just come by our way lord that you would just speak to us in a very personal way and pray heavenly father then lord as you know the needs there's needs that's here there's needs that's lord over your god streaming by way of the internet lord some not able to be your lord with sickness lord in their body lord your god you know the need lord those that are here just pray that lord jesus said may your words find its mark oh god father may the enemy lord god may it just be routed lord from any hole we pray o god lord we just ask lord that you just minister lord to every part of our being tonight oh god help me just to get out of the way lord that you can say what you want to say father i pray lord we commit ourselves in this congregation into your hands lord for your glory in the name of jesus christ amen amen uh first corinthians 13 4 and i'll just read there and i'll just let you be seated paul opens up charity separate law and is kind charity envieth not charity wanteth not itself and is not puffed up or displays itself hardly you know this very term that we've looked at there's other parts here in the scripture that we lord willing will get to where it deals with this part and spirit of god would address this as being puffed up and it deals with uh to swell up from from a blowing to make proud or to bear one song bear oneself loftily you know you think about that many times we could walk outside and say my it's windy today but you don't see the wind but you feel it you see the wind as it's moving upon the leaves on the tree is that right many in the meetings didn't see the angel the lord but you saw him what he was doing that only he could be the one doing it so when we we look at this we know that that this this type of wind we don't we don't want that in our life of that which would elevate self but you know the reality is is that when we and ourselves if we would have an inflated idea or a thought it'll eventually show itself and we don't we only think we want to be is a billboard or a display of the love of god say lord just search me if there's anything in me lord that's not right guide me each day in each part of my life may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated to begin to you know you look at this and throughout the whole scriptures when paul is dealing with this charity of how this very the love of god would would be the governments of the church of the living god and we know that charity itself paul would write it never fails now we only know there's one who can't fail and that's god so we know that that when we're speaking of charity that of the love of god we're speaking of god we're speaking of his nature and this is where paul would say that the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by that of the holy ghost and so when we when we would look at this and we are looking at the very divine nature of god we're looking at parts of attributes or characteristics that would come from the very nature of god and when we think of it that the divine nature of god when it comes into our lives surrendered lives by way of the new birth it's such a contrast to that of the first nature it's such a contrast and so there where you know at one point in time i think of it as i was just just looking at it here today and just reading just some things a particular quote and brother brown said he said before he said before you receive the holy ghost he said you weren't in a battle at all you know there wasn't a battle he said before you become a christian he said but as soon as you become a christian he says and you say i've got the holy ghost he said every gun out of hell is trained against you it's traps and everything that's set all around us and we realize this is we've been looking at this by the spirit of god that that maturity and an adoption of sons and daughters of god it's never for us to have our sight set in a place as though that we are going to reach a perfection in ourself as in a manner that well i'm never going to make a mistake or i'm never going to you know to fall into this where i say something i shouldn't have said but what we realize is that the longer and the more that as we're walking with god we come to a place to distrust our own abilities more and more we come to a place to rest upon him more and more we recognize our need and our littleness and that's the thing you can't you can't be close to god and still feel big but when you really get close to god now i'll say it like this a person could pray 12 hours a day but yet they're not praying they could come out of there they could pray 15 hours a day but if they never really enter into that place in prayer then they'll come out of there and they fill a stuffed shirt they've done something and they'll come out of there and instead of walking in humility they'll come out of there with such criticism and picking people apart and if you've not made it into the presence of god so coming into the friends of god is not about how long you stay how long you stay on your knees or maybe you're laying on your bed or you're walking around or you're driving your car but it's about really entering in and really enter into prayer and just really making it a place to where that you can come into those places we can come into those places to where it brings out brings more humility out in our lives and so we want to examine this here tonight i want to look here at the very character of god we've looked at here within of some some of the previous services and we've looked at certain parts and how that men would start out kings that were appointed kings but how they would allow something to arise in their life and to where it would take them from the very even where god had used them mightily but they would get to feeling so confident within themselves and we began looking at that we looked at nebuchadnezzar last week of how that god and his mercy and you think of it nebuchadnezzar wasn't a believer but yet god in his mercy would take that as an example to you and i as believers if god could have such a care and a respect because nebuchadnezzar was regarded as his servant to serve the purpose and will of god to bring judgment on egypt to bring that upon israel he served that purpose and god himself would allow him to come down to be consumed to a stump but not all the way and then here once he came to a place to recognize that it's god who put him in position it's god who gives authority it's god who gives power it's god who does all of these things once he came back to a place of realizing that this is not what i've done but this is what god has done you see god had to allow the situation to come in order for that hold of that spirit that had got upon his life for that power to be broken and then god as we looked in the scripture he says then i returned unto my reason it was a returning and see we see god's grace if god would do that for nebuchadnezzar a one who was not even a believer how much more will god in his mercy and grace deal with our life with a heart that desires to please him that desires to walk and and just to say lord i i'm not interested in that i have to do anything i just want to have fellowship with you i just want my life to be a place that you can say of all the places i want to go there because i feel welcome in that place i feel welcome in that life i'm invited and that's the desire that we would have and should have in our lives and so when we look at this of true greatness it's entirely contrary to that of how the world because the world that we know not the earth but the world that we know is a system that is not a system of god but the world is the system that came about because of the fall and we recognize we're heading back to a place to where the very world itself the the systems the governments and all those things which are all controlled by satan will all pass away there's there's going to be a cleansing of all of this there's going to be a cleansing there'll be a millennium there'll be a new heaven and a new earth this is all it's all leading into that place and as the earth as a redeemable attribute is coming into that place you and i as a redeemable attribute of god god has already come to our heart to bring a change into ruling the administration what was in our life and he rides in in such humility and authority and power that it dismantles the very hold of the enemy upon our life and there's a new ownership there's a new life there's a new man there's a there's a new creation in christ jesus look at this scripture in isaiah 57 15 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place this is god speaking with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit contract meaning dust and that of humble meaning that of lowliness or of human humiliation so what a contrast you and i the world let me just say the word and i don't mean to say that we are like the world but i'm saying that you and i we still after being redeemed are thinking about things god continues to work and change we would never have put these two together like this and thought of it a high and lofty one who is all holy who's all powerful but yet he dwells with those who are of a contrite uh and humble spirit that's a paradox it's not something we could ever put together but that's who god is because that's exactly who he is this is his greatness and paul paul would write to the church of the living god and he would express to them the working of this divine nature and he would speak in philippians 2 5 and let them know the privilege that's given to them and says let this mind be in you he wasn't speaking of this matter here he's speaking of that nature that character of life let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god i love this i love that he meaning he was not reaching after straining pushing pulling to become something this is who he was and he realized that and he yielded to obedience to the word he thought it not robbery he wasn't straining it wasn't pulling it shows you and i that this is god does not require nor does he call nor does he desire that we would strain pull or push he wants us to yield in obedience to the word verse 7 but made himself these words to me are just tremendous but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men so it was not enough that he was made in the likeness of sinful flesh but he took upon him the form of a servant this is this is how that his life would be depicted or viewed it's a life of servanthood and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross how many know the way up is down wherefore he said god also hath highly exalted him why because of what we read in the previous two verses this humility to the word where he took on the form of a servant here he humbled himself and became obedient to the death you couldn't get any lower and because of this he's exalted to that of the throne as it says god also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of the father think of what the lord jesus said when he speaks to nicodemus he said no man have to send it up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven he's he's declaring at this time that what where the sons of god had fallen from their position in heavenly places here he is walking upon the earth and yet there he is also in heaven at the same time in heavenly places he's manifesting this position that belongs back into the very lives of sons and daughters of god and he's declaring it no man ascends you cannot even go into heavenly places unless you first descend you cannot go into heights unless you go into the depths you see this is not that of the world the world looks at if i'm going to get higher i'll step on who i need to step on in order to get there but that's not the way god works god works in a measure that in order to be exalted in order for heights it's to come to the greatest depths and when it comes to that of greatest steps the only thing that it comes to in our lives like it was in the lord jesus he came not to serve himself he came to minister on our behalf he wasn't thinking about himself when he did what he did he thought about you and me he thought about our needs he thought about what it is that you'd be going through tonight and he made a way and served the purpose that you and i might be able to draw on the benefits of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ what a life that there's no puffed up part about that hallelujah so you see this is why over and over brother branham would deal with this and i want to just keep moving of the way up is down i want you to think of this how that he would enter into a fallen creation when he would come let me just say it to you like this it would be like you and and forgive me if you've been in a situation that's been like this but it would be like you or me taking a house or a trailer or whatever it is and it's one that's been condemned it's one that's been boarded up it's got the yellow tapes on it and it says nobody shall occupy because there's things that don't meet the conditions or satisfactions of occupancy it's overrun with rats it's overcome with all sorts of things there's all sorts of filth but you would go to that house you would purchase that house you would come into there let me tell you something you would look at that what a massive filth and everything let me tell you something when god came down to become one of us he came to that of a life of a race that was under condemnation and he came he came under that of the law he came in order to bring a real change and transformation in our lives nothing puffed up about that at all as a matter of fact the scripture would say in hebrews 2 14 that for as much as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetimes subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham he was taking on not the nature of angels not the nature of god he took on the seed of abraham he adorned himself in a garment of humiliation oh my wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to secure them that are tempted think of this many men of people can make things and and they get reputations for it they can make a little something a little gadget and they get a you know big name for it is that right but here's the lord of glory who created all things let me just say it to you and i don't know how else to word it if anybody could have had a big head he could have but he came down and made he actually think about this he made himself of no reputation he orchestrated it in such a way it was according to his word he would come but he would make himself of no reputation amen i thought brother graham says it like this these words to me have just just just ring out in my heart he says he brought himself down god jehovah in veiled in flesh come down to sacrifice himself for our sins and sickness the love of god could not be thought of listen to this how deep how pure how rich how high to know god would do such for his enemies not for his lovely ones who love him but for his enemies he could have been puffed up but he came with such humility now he didn't come with just humility for those who would love him he came even for his enemies this is this is more than man you understand this is more than man that's why brother brown would say it over and over he said this was god in flesh it was god anointed that flesh brother and sister it can be no other way in our life except god anoints our life there is no way possible for you and i to be able to manifest this and live this without the holy ghost in our life and a continual surrender on our life humbling ourselves to his leadership think of this hey brother adam when you know he would go on and speak it again he says to think of this true redemption how he came down worthy robed himself no home no place to go humiliated himself brought himself down in sinful flesh and took upon him not the nature of angels not the nature of god but he took on himself the nature of man that he might walk with man eat with man sleep with man and die for man he had to become little in order to redeem us i want you to think about this for a moment he had to become little in order to redeem us god had appeared many times throughout the old testament god had appeared god had come right in flesh but it was not that of redemption but you see when god when it came time for redemption god could not step out as a full-grown man like he came when he came to abraham are you with me now when he came to abraham that's speaking of the end time god does not reveal himself as an infant in the end time god reveals himself in the maturity of his word in his bride that's an end time sign but in order for that to be god had to become little he had to become a baby he had to come to a place as the scripture says isaiah 7 14. i want you to think of this a man in his right mind let me say it like this a man thinking about this if he would have god would have passed it by isaiah isaiah put this down in your notes isaiah would have no doubt put it down his notes may be under inspiration then come back and look and say there's no way in the world but you see god was not interested in what isaiah thought and isaiah only knew to yield and speak as god put it in his lips to speak god would bring that to pass be therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and then it goes on the government shall be on his shoulder now just for sake of time i'm not going to read the rest of it but right here in isaiah 9 6 there is the beginning here's where the littleness comes and throughout that period of time in his life to where it moves into a place after his resurrection then we experience this the government shall be upon his shoulder there is a lot of humility oh if i can say it this way there was a lot of humility that had to take place after that colon where it says given a lot of humility a lot of life that had to be lived and yet you don't see it right there are you with me there's a lot of things in our life where there's a humbling and a humility and god dealing with our life and things want to come and try to inflate and puff up but within the midst of it when it's all said and done it goes right to the next junction when we stand there that day when our bodies have been changed brother you talking about glorious to be able to stand there and say god you've given me grace you're present for the bill for the brian we made it by the grace of god god gave us strength to make it god gave us grace to humble ourselves now it continues on what greatness what greatness iran takes us into this when he refers to this israel and he talks about the nations talks about russia talks about the other nations he said they're each one i want you to listen to statement they're each one wanting a messiah each one are wanting that but brother braham says what it is they want a messiah that they can control you see you can't have a messiah that you can control he's either going to be the messiah or he's not the messiah and they believed israel they believed there's many scriptures we could go to but they believed they needed a general they believed we need to get out of this roman rule we need to get them out of here we need to drive them out we we need to do all of this they didn't need a general they needed a baby they didn't need a general they needed a baby the religious spirits of that day wanted to try to control the lord jesus when they couldn't control him and then after pentecost when they couldn't control them then that's when they wanted to shut them up are you with me but they they claimed they were looking for him or looking for him but what god gave them is what they needed they needed brother brahma says it like this they needed humiliation they needed to be humiliated he would look at it god we need a general you gave us a baby but they needed a deliverance more than just the people who was over them and oh the romans are oppressing us they needed a deliverance on the inside they needed a change of nature they themselves were in need of a baby why because through that baby that virgin birth then could be a life that would be rendered unto god that his own life could come back and lead us to a place of becoming a baby born again in christ what greatness what humility one thing you find that god himself is not worried about being misunderstood god does not do like you and i sometimes and think well i hope they got it i hope they got it i hope he got to hope this hope oh my trust that god doesn't work that way god is at rest god is confident in his word he's confident in his word in our lives he's not worried he don't bite his nails he doesn't do none of those things he doesn't pace the floors but god his word will always come to pass in its season god will always bring in work and condition in our lives so that when it's time for that word to come to pass our lives and our hearts are ready in that time and in that place oh my god think of this this humility look what jesus said let me break in on this for a moment jesus when he was here and he remember he's speaking to the disciples in matthew 18 1 the disciples are asking him who's the greatest in the kingdom of heaven now remember all they've known is this kingdom of this world though they've been jews all they've known is this kingdom but now here comes the entrance of another kingdom this kingdom is that of the person of jesus christ god dwelling there in the very form of humanity and so that all they can think of is is all they've ever known and so they're thinking who would be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child look look how he does this he turned from the direction you're going and now look and become as a little child you realize that it takes the grace of god to lead us into repentance paul would say it's the goodness of god that leads us to repentance and at that point everything itself you realize even repentance nobody can do it for you pastor prophet nobody can do it it has to be god dealing with your heart and you have to make a decision based on how that he's revealing himself to you and then a further decision comes on whether or not you are willing to actually become as a little child think of that here we are my we know so much and we know everything and god says i want you to become dumb oh that's oh my goodness i i don't know about that but what is it about a little child a little childing dumb children ain't dumb i'll tell you what sometimes children got more discernment than adults got are you with me i mean a child but what is it about a child a child just simply believes a child don't try to figure it out a child don't try to explain it a child when mom or daddy says you know what i want you to stop this okay you know eventually yeah it gets to a place of why but all daddy or mama has to say sometimes this if you go this direction this will happen to you you're one you know this will leave you and this and that okay lord i i'm not gonna go that way you see become as a little child in other words we are one who needs to be led by our heavenly father so to become as a little child one who simply just trusts that what the father is saying yes that's my father he said it i believe it i act according to it because he said it whosoever therefore shall humble himself look at that humble himself now this is not something that the pastor can do for you it's not something that any matter of fact you find this same thing take place over and over and it has to be in our lives because god himself will not humble he will not humble us just all the time but god will have things that will take place in our life that we can recognize and we humble ourselves in recognizing lord i got a little bit too big lord i got a little bit too big in my thinking lord i i got a little bit too big and my feelings are what i was saying and god by his grace remember he won't do it for us sometimes he has to let trials test circumstances come our way to help us to see where we think ma i'm acting like a little child and that's saying you know and here god says no you're acting like a spoiled brat you're acting like a teenager that knows everything nope i can't have that i need you to act not like a teenager don't become like a teenager those are your teenagers tonight i apologize to you but you understand this god does not want us to be teenagers he wants us to be children children oh my so whosoever shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven now brother brown would talk about this here and let me just let me dwell with this just a moment he talks about when a life and how that god you know god will come into a heart in a heart you know we'll we'll we'll accept the lord jesus christ and and really it's not you accepting him it's you recognizing he's already accepted you and you repent of your sins and you follow on in the word to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and and to receive the gift of the holy ghost but you see when god comes into a life a person can you know open their heart and god is as it is that god himself will come in into that life and here you know he was on the outside and they let him come in now in the door and here he is he's he's standing on this mat and it says welcome but he's standing there and brother brown says the first door that's on the right is the door of pride i find it striking when brother branham would deal with this because you know the right hand or right side it deals with power and authority and to find that the very thing that is upon the very first door that the lord jesus wants to deal with after stepping in in our life as our lord and savior he wants to step in he's coming a savior he wants to be lord but the very first door that he needs to deal with is that door of pride but remember the lord jesus does not walk around with battering rams and saying hey hey gabriel you get on that side and i'm on this side and we're just going to we're going to bust this door down no he doesn't do that he's a gentleman he'll stay right there on that mat as long as you make him stay there if that's all you give him in your life he'll stay right there the whole time he's a gentleman but if you'll let him deal with that door of pride now that door of pride itself it will go to thinking well if i give in to this what are they going to think about me at work what are they going to think about me you know down here with my friends and brother brown goes into it what if i you know i stopped wearing the makeup but i stopped cutting my hair and i stopped wearing the pants and i stopped running around stop looking at this stuff and stop making they know the the dirt cutting in on the dirty jokes with the boys and everything else what are they going to think when i stand there and say hey i don't want to be a part of that no more and you see when that begins to come out because what's the matter you realize there's a stand that must have to be taken in order for him to move off of that place in your life you're the one who's got the control jesus is not himself walking around kicking down doors he himself is waiting on you and i to open the doors that he will come in but you see when he comes into that door of pride one thing that's wonderful about it he comes in and humiliates us are you with me he'll cause you to testify and say things that you know what i know i used to be that way but god has done something for me i want to serve him i want to live for him and you know what you might bear that humiliation you might feel that maybe a little bit of redness as it trickles over you and it might seem like that humiliation but there's something on the inside you're so happy that you can say i identify with him why because you've allowed him to have that door of pride and he comes in and he humiliates you these are the prophets words here i'm just not reading them word for word but that's exactly what he comes in to do to where now you've all of that is gone from your life you don't care right i don't care what so-and-so might feel are thinking and you're being arrogant you realize i care more about what he thinks that's what i care more about i want to entertain my jesus i i'm not interested in entertaining these things you know what that does that causes him to move off of that doormat right into your life and you know that's the same way it keeps on in our life he will only deal with our lives as we'll lay he'll speak to our heart and service and it's up to us to say yes lord amen yes lord i surrender yes lord lord take that out of me lord let it be lined up with your word he won't just come and do it it's got to be a welcoming amen and do you think of this when brother branham would tell us in the church age book that when the preaching of the word goes forth the sword goes forth brother bran would say in the message shalom he said oh god let the sword of the word come through sweep through our lives with such sweetness what does it do it cuts away holds in our life you may not you might be sitting there hearing the word and your hands may not even go up you but you are here you are so inclined to the word and your heart is saying amen your heart is saying yes lord and what's happening the sword of the word is cutting things right away from your life and giving you strength think of this he humbled himself to that place brother brahms he says it just like this he says to think of this you know in our lives he says if we can humble he says you've got to humble yourself until you see that until if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will it's humbling of self to abide in him like the church you don't abide in the church we come here on thursday we leave come here on sunday we leave but you see this abiding in him is where we are baptized into him by one spirit it's where just as we had a baptism here on sunday and you seen as we baptized brother louie right there in the in the in the in the pool he didn't baptize himself did he i mean he didn't you know get up here and just lay himself back no but we had to direct him and say now look you take your arm you hold it right here and you put it over your nose we will lay you back and we will bring you up that in itself is what god does not man by the baptism of the holy ghost it's god taking a life to where life says okay lord yes lord i want more than anything lord to be so submerged in you and you come to that place just listening in obedience to his word and he himself comes and baptizes you into himself oh my in that wonderful of submission now to think when we think of this you know a lot of times as i'm reading across this this quote and reading across some of these things here today even brother branham he speaks of it many times we we talk about where he was born and we say oh you know let it i think the song says let your word be born in the manger of my heart brother brahman says it like this and why little bethlehem he says he came to a stable that was so polluted this is the king of glory he wasn't born in a nice home wasn't born in a nice hospital he didn't have all these requirements well i gotta have this kind of crib i gotta have this kind of rocker gotta have this kind of this i gotta have this kind of this i gotta have that it wasn't he didn't lay out all these requirements the word had already given the requirements so god humbled himself and came according to his word in a stable over manure pile over stench it was not a beautiful place where he was born and brother branham brings it on down and he deals with it like this he says when you can realize about yourself that you're nothing but a stinking stable our life well well i mean naturally god would want to come and associate with me really remember that condemned house i talked about infested with rats well i never had that and i never had this and i never had that but our lie we were still under condemnation we still were of that first birth man who's born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble but he himself would come condense in and identify himself with us oh my this is why brother brown can say if you just open your heart it's very simple and take the word in he said watch the change that comes in your life when he comes look at this scripture for you know second corinthians 8 9 for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that through his poverty might be rich this was ongoing in his life it was not speaking that he was rich naturally because he wasn't he didn't even have a place to lay his head the lord jesus didn't even have a home to go to that he could say hey i want to invite you over to my house he had no house to call his own but he became poor rich in what rich in that it was the fullness of the godhead bodily god the god of glory that had stepped down into a body of time are created body that he had made in order to reflect his word through he became poor what a what a contrast to that of the world to that of the earth it looks at become poor but you see this is god's character this is what real charity is it's that of where it becomes poor that through his poverty we might be made rich once you think of this not only did he not have a place to lay his head and home and things but you know he didn't have to be sick he didn't have to know what a headache was he didn't have to know what it was to be frustrated as the prophet put it in perfect faith he didn't have to know that but he did it he did it are you with me i hope you understand what i'm saying he didn't have to know that you say why why didn't he have to know that because remember there had to be a price paid in order for the redemption of our soul that that life might come back but in order that he might be a faithful and merciful high priest that he might be the right kind of a mediator that he might understand when you and i would go to him and say father i'm tempted awful bad here father i feel a pull here or i'm sorry about this or or i'm sensing this he's able to stand there he felt he felt what it was to be tempted are you with me he knows what it was brother to have to turn your head he was tempted by sex tempted by drinking tempted in all these matter let me bring it on down he was tempted to rebuke them at times where the father said don't say nothing he was tempted to go there and say i'm gonna debate you but the father said turn around and walk out of the temple are you with me we're talking about a life that was so governed by god let me tell you something that's not a pie in the sky the virgin birth came that you and i might be born of that same spirit and god by his spirit in dwelling in our lives would be able to so mold and shake and conform us to that glorious image the character that's raptured out of here will be the same character that was in the bridegroom listen these words here i i can't these words they just grip my heart brother brahm says concerning him he said he humiliated himself he stripped himself of all heavenly glories and came down don't just leave this here this is what this same life does in you and i it doesn't cause us to vomit or puff ourselves it there's sometimes where we have to strip away strip away and humble to the word strip away our feelings or where this is my point in this and we've got to strip away are you hearing me it's because it's easy to get puffed up when you're right and you know you're right and the other person's wrong that's easy but that still is not a right to be puffed up because let me tell you something there was nobody more right and perfect than the lord jesus but he laid aside his splendor brother brahm says god's stripping himself coming out of the ivory palaces taking upon himself the form of sinful flesh to humiliate himself you catch these words to humiliate himself to come down to be kin folks to the poorest beggar there is in the world tonight how many walked by blind bartimaeus how many walked by him but jesus came down and the call of blind bartimaeus stopped the sun that day the sun stood still and he turned and he heard the cry not from these ears he heard the cry of blind bartimaeus through that of the spirit it was crying out for healing you know how that cry came blind bartimaeus was sitting there he had gave away his turtle doves he gave away the lamb that was his eyes when he went to offer that lamb because he was blind like you would have a dog that would be a guide dog that got him around and the priest brother random drama class the priest stopped him bartimaeus you can't give that away that's your eyes that's what you need in order to get around here's another lamb or we could preach on this but here's what blind bartimaeus said i didn't promise god any lamb i promised him this lamb god don't want anything else but our life he wants everything about our life listen you might say well i pray and i read thank god for that but god don't want your fruits he wants your life sometimes i've had people tell me well i'm praying and i'm reading and i'm this but god don't want your works god wants your heart he wants your heart and anything even if it's religious that stands against surrender is an enticing spirit amen are you with me sometimes people take fasting they'll take speaking in tongues they'll take everything else except surrendering their life but a surrendered life invites the presence of god like david when he offered there on the threshing floor they wanted to give him an offer he said no i won't offer something to god that cost me nothing amen he came down can i have just a few more moments here and we'll come to a close there's just no way to get it and isaiah 53 when it speaks believed our report to whom is the arm of the lord the strength of god revealed goes on to speak he'll grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground you realize jehovah is a baby jehovah is a toddler jehovah as a teenager are you with me jehovah all the way through and no form no communist we should when we shall see him there's no beauty we should desire him but brahman said it like this he said he was probably a little skinny spindly looking fellow didn't look like a king to look at him and say [Music] so this is where redemption is going to come through this is what you're sending us but you see god doesn't measure character by the stature of a person amen that's what satan does let me tell you something that's false are you with me in the book of revelations when john was getting that that private tour there when the angel pulled back and showed him when john was wandering on the woman and just with an amazement wow she's so religious and here the anointing the word he comes in and uncovers and shows what that great religious church is filled with hatred the blood of the martyrs of the saints and as soon as her character was revealed john said her beauty is not real beauty because real beauty is real character amen that kind of beauty is the kind of beauty that satan brings about but the beauty that god brings about is a character in humility to his word so he would have bypassed those in that day my here's here's the one that's going to here's the one that's going to bring deliverance but it was the character of god's own life that was dwelling behind this life let me just bring this down here let me think i want you to think of this just for a moment i wish i could go on but i i know i just can't here you want to think of humility brother brown would deal with humility in such a way in the message victory day and he talks about how we think about greatness and he says you know how we can get greater and greater and greater and greater he says you know god will just pull back then a paragraph on down he deals with what real greatness is and he says you know you can get to a place where you get greater and greater he's talking spiritually now he says greater and greater and greater until he says you're so humble that people just look right over the top of you you see when jesus was here it was that of a humility it wasn't just because it's like as brother brand said he was a spindly looking fellow he never went anywhere to try to get a following he never tried to corral people he just simply when they would speak to him whether it was philip andrew amen what did he say to him follow me leave leave that follow me but they were following not not that of a man it was not even the man part that actually got them but the man part was that vessel that tent that the lord pitched that god's own character could actually be manifested through that would actually draw them in leadership and here it was to such a place where brother brown could make a statement like this to where he says 99 and 9 10 of the people didn't even know he was on earth it wasn't because he was in hiding he wasn't quarantined hello there was a plague on but he came to deal with the plague are you with me he wasn't in hiding he was in the temple with him as a matter of fact when they went they came into the garden to take him he said i've been there in the temple and you didn't take me he walked right among them the god of glory jesus wasn't the aaron boy he was god come down to redeem you and i [Applause] and they looked right over the top of it it didn't come according to how they think it ought to come but here let me tell you how how much it was looked over the humility is those who ate with him fished with him slept where he slept and everything else when the fulfillment of the word came and he's fulfilling word prophecy is being fulfilled events that are taking place are being made clear by prophecy but yet their eyes are withholding to know what's taking place more prophecy is being fulfilled in those last moments on the cross and then as he descends there into the lowest parts of hell he steps out in luke 24. he begins to talk to him they said are you a stranger are you a stranger but their eyes were withholding withholding you say why would their eyes be withholden because they needed their spiritual eyes opened they needed to see him that he is the fulfillment of the messiah he is the fulfillment of the world why because that was important that they know now it's time for the fulfillment of the word in their life the outpouring of the holy ghost it was such humility that they looked over it yeah they couldn't see it couldn't see what was going on what was taking place but when he began to open the word to their hearts and they got in that day they said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way when he came into that place he took the bread and he broke it and they recognized this is our master this is the lord jesus they recognized him in the fulfillment of his word such such humiliation do you realize on calvary our bookstores paintings and everything else they'll cover it up on the crucifixion but he was stripped there the scripture says who for the joy that was set before him hebrews 12 2 for the joy that was set before him he despised the shame the cross he didn't want to go it was not the cross that he wanted to go to but he went there he endured humiliation for you and me he took and paid the price for you and me but then because of that then he could come and take a hold of our lives amen boy you think one but you would think coming into a garment of likeness of sinful flesh that which he created and he would step into it and that would be a garment of humiliation about our lives where god found us and where god brought us from but god said i can come i can do a work on that house i can flip that house i can i can do that i can change this and change that i i'll remove it from a condemned status and you know what i ain't gonna sell it i'm going to live in it myself [Laughter] i'm going to put my furniture in i'm going to decorate it the way i want to decorate it lord you would take a condemned house i bought it off the market you can never return to the market you've been redeemed nothing puffed up about that at all but humiliation humiliation where he would step down become one of us amen and then come and bring us to himself oh my god may god help us as we look at this character this life this nature that we've been born of this same spirit that that same nature would live in us if you have and i encourage you be born be born again let the spirit of god how that the lord spoke it here so clearly tonight just take the word into your life that don't mean just with the casual but but really let it come into your life let the word come in sell out to that and say god let this word be born in my life you let the word come in and it'll produce a word life it'll produce a transformation it'll produce a change but remember he won't do it unless we let him off of that carpet right there i could sit right here and say jesus move over there and so-and-so's life samuel i'd love to but they have to invite me but jesus go to that door in their life but samuel i'm a gentleman hallelujah they must invite me amen what about when he comes down speaks to our hearts deals with our lives maybe in little gary we're feeling pretty good about we're feeling right about maybe justified about something god comes down and deals with our life i don't know lord i don't know they don't seem like right now what they've done to me they're not worthy of love that's the time they need love amen none of us could be worthy of love he loved us when we were unlovable and because of that he's made us love them friends these are not things that we you and i can do on our own we can look to god and we can ask god we can be honest with god and say lord help me lord amen help me lord jesus let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you dear god for your mercy tonight lord thank you for your word lord truly this is lord so the character your own character in life so contrary to that of our first nature our first birth to that of the world but lord jesus i'm just so thankful lord god how that you would come lord if i can say it this way just as your prophet would say it that you would come and be identified with me brother branham would say it that he would be humiliated by being identified with me one who's illiterate cannot pronounce his words correctly but yet he would come lord when i think of that what about each of our lives lord help us lord help us lord when there's times lord that would come about our life maybe things lord that we feel like we're writing and maybe we are right maybe we are right maybe we're even justified in something but lord when we think about the character of your life [Music] well that changes things lord help us lord i ask you to help us help us to apply this in our life help us lord we just don't want to hear the word that lord we want to receive it help us to apply it in our life god help us that our we would yield that god that you can shape and mold our lives being conformed to your own glorious image in our walks our actions our behavior because lord we realize that one of these moments we're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we won't take any grudges with us matter of fact lord we can't even have grudges to go help us help us lord god to unpack any weight that's hindering because that weight's hindering right now lord jesus in that moment we will take nothing of this life with us except our character and our character is not a gift the holy ghost is a free gift the holy ghost is the gift of god we can't earn it we don't marry it but it's yielding ourselves and lord you coming and accepting the sacrifice it's not us accepting you it's the fire of god coming down and consuming the sacrifice but then lord is that life would work within our life [Music] after we've accepted that invitation the lord that our character might be molded to your own glorious character lord jesus i realize as i stand here every one of us lord it's our it's up to us to humble ourselves i realize this congregation my wife nobody can humble me for me lord i have to humble myself i have to do that lord just like each and every one of my brothers and sisters these are things lord that they must do but lord we don't do it out of law we do it out of love help us lord i pray that we can stay in that place lord when you use us speak to us help us lord that we'll become more simple littler as the prophet put it staying in a place where you can use us if you need to lord lord i just want to stay in a place that you're welcome to come that you feel welcome you feel a welcoming spirit i pray lord may we let this mind be in us lord may we not lord walk according to our own thinking i realize lord this is molding this is character molding and shaping but lord jesus i ask lord help us because there's times lord we've still taken our own thinking lord lord i confess that the lord jesus that's my desire as that mind that new creation on the inside lord god to walk lord according to your mind lord not mine but you are smart help us lord i pray for your mind for its greatness but its greatness and that of humility help us lord if there's any area of our life that's puffed up would you just lord deflate us deflate that lord we don't want that in our life help us we feel like we're a little better or think this or that lord that's none of you help us lord i pray [Music] granted lord may we adorn those garments [Music] maybe lord it's a garment that we're adorned with that we can say well i don't know that this person's personality or the way that they're made up it's just you know we just don't seem really to hit it off but may we adorn that garment of humility not that you intended for every one of us that we would be best buddies with one another but we would have loved one for time in humility lord help us lord i pray because i'm sure lord i'm positive sure there's a lot of things that you look over in our life a lot of times lord we can see as we look back down through it but god you've been so merciful you've come lord jesus when we did deserve it help us i pray father help us lord the name of the lord jesus christ he wants me to live [Music] there's just no more love for i could never [Music] i ever to live [Music] the way that he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to [Music] my lord sing the course
