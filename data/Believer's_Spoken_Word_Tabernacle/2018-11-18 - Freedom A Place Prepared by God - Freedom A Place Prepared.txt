the greatest way that we can approach him is as it says in the very opening part of Hebrews 11 he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek Him amen we just thank God for His mercy here this morning so good to have each and every one of you and some of you I know we've been dealing with sickness throughout the congregation a little bit and it seems like we we press through those times and that's what makes it so precious to be able to come together when we all can be here in the house of God and it's it's so true we are so thankful to have brother my goodness brother Michael I almost forgot your name brother Michael I couldn't I couldn't say brother and sister Jennifer I mean that just wouldn't be right now you didn't take her name she

Lord God we are here this morning Lord even as we looked at it last week Oh God to humble ourselves and to wash your feet Lord Oh God we just thank you for keeping your appointments Lord and father from the depths of our hearts or God beyond every circumstance Lord Jesus we want to reach you Lord granite this morning father we pray in Jesus name Amen amen revelations chapter 12 verse 1 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being the child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne amen that's speaking of of Israel there we know the man child to be Jesus Christ is that right verse 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death amen may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated notice in the opening here of the scriptures you keep reading in the scriptures here this is the woman a woman the woman we can keep going all the way down through the chapter you have Israel that is spoken of here the elect of Israel that was waiting on the promise of the Messiah to come which was the Lord Jesus Christ then you have where the scripture picks up here a woman she fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of God for her to feed and be nourished that speaks of the elect Church of the Living God the Gentile church then you have here in another place where it would go on further into the scriptures and it picks up Israel again then it picks up also the remnant those that do not have the life of the Holy Ghost but they in the time of the tribulation they'll have to give their lives for what they believe but in the midst of this here I just my heart just very drawn to a point here I don't know how many weeks ago it was and but at any rate I was drawn to a point here I begin to look into this scripture in verse 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days as believers we recognize that this precious book that we hold in our hands and that we read from is not just an account of history but it's a book of prophecy and as believers these are not stories but these are events that what God has done before he will also do again there are times that God has chosen to speak prophetically of things that were and are to come there's other times that God has spoken in conjunction with what has been spoken through the prophets where God would speak through the lives of individuals in prophecy of what also was to come we find that within the scriptures as Peter was moved by the Spirit of God where he says that no scripture is of a private interpretation isolated without him being able to dovetail with the rest we understand that you know scripture can be taken here there but yet it must line up and always highlight Jesus Christ if it's truly in the thought in which it was given in it will never ever take away nor will it add to what was already said but it will just bring forth the real true reality of the Lord Jesus Christ because you know it takes it the only way that error is ever known as and exposed it there must be truth to expose the error and there must be truth that is able to repel error from moving any further and when I look at this as my heart was just taken within this this this scripture and just looking at it you're aware that I find it just quite fitting but God knows what he's doing I come across the statement here where brother Branham is dealing with this nation and what day that we're coming upon here we're coming upon the Lord willing this coming Thursday would be Thanksgiving Day and brother Branham makes this statement regarding it in from the beginning it wasn't so in 1959 and he says concerning this day he says it's was set aside for our pilgrim forefathers to give things for what that he had done for them the blessings that he had given to them and the crops that they had been able to bring forth he said it's one real American day and he goes on all the other days like st. Patrick's and so forth come from across the seas but this is an American holiday Thanksgiving Day he goes on to mention and give an admonition of what should be done by those who were there within that meeting as Thanksgiving Day was approaching he said it would be good for you he says to get your family together and to enter take God's Word and to tell your children about this tell them that this nation was built upon such as that that our forefathers who fought to bring this freedom to us and left the other country so that we could have freedom of worship freedom of speech and freedom of press and so forth and we're thankful yet for it we don't know how long it will last that way but I say this long may our lands be bright with freedoms Holy Light protect us by thy might Great God our King I don't bring this this morning with the intent that Thanksgiving is coming up if this inspiration had dropped in the middle of June I would have preached it in June because it's something to be preached no matter what day of the year we're in of what this think and it would be a time Wow V not just something that is on a day but how that we live our lives when you look at this in the scriptures of revelations 12 verse 5 you know sometimes there's a great space of time that takes place between scriptures being fulfilled you see that in the life of the Lord Jesus when you read the Gospels in the time of the resurrection you'll find this account in mark this account in Luke this and John this in Matthew in all the events there's none that are contradicting but yet every one of them has a sequence of events that are divinely placed by God in a direct order there are things that were being fulfilled in throughout the resurrection of the Lord Jesus we find here in verse 5 of Revelations 12 of where you find the Church of the Living God who was waiting on the promise of the Messiah remember brother Branham puts it like this and the message birth pains it was a small remnant of believers who were actually waiting on the Messiah to come brother Bream actually names them off few believed on the massive amount it was a few believers he said at church that was waiting on this promise was a small little church so when it comes down to it we know that the promise of the Messiah of how that God would come and we find that within this year that this manchild that was to come forth here the Lord Jesus this was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne and then we find quite a space of time between verse 5 and verse 6 because after this you find after her here that he is caught up the sacrifice remember the Holy Ghost is sent back down to the people the promise the very reason of the Messiah coming in order to bring Redemption that his life might come back we find that God begins to move and remember the scripture says that this gospel shall be preached first beginning at Jerusalem and then unto the uttermost parts of Judea we find that how that the word itself you know civilization we recognize that civilization even as we know it now civilization is not of God civilizations of the devil we recognize within that discernment of what was the very purpose when you think of it God had already set a civilization upon this earth mat of by his word but then when Cain himself after he slew Abel remember he he went out from the presence of God and as soon as he goes out from the presence of God he begins to build a city and civilization begins to come forth from there it was there the purpose of it it was not something that was ordained of God but yet God Himself will once again have a civilization upon this earth but it will not be a man-made civilization it's a civilization of faith whereby it actually begins in the heart of the believer through him by the new birth and that new birth can never be overthrown that Satan can never prevail against the kingdom God once it is moved within the heart he can come against the vessel in whom it is veiled in he can come against that but he can never ever overthrow that revelation in the heart of the believer you see Satan was a loser in heaven and he's going to be a loser on earth are you with me today there is no there is no all of a sudden reversing of the story and he's going to become a winner but Satan himself God has allowed even all of this to take place that the purpose of God all the great attributes of God may begin to come forth and you find how that when the civilization would actually begin to progress civilization follows that of the Sun it follows that of the light moving from the east unto the west find of how there was such a high concentration right there within the East but then how that the word itself would begin to move remember here it was within the time of Asia Asia Minor you find it moving there across the Mediterranean then you find the word moving from the meditator from across the Mediterranean then moving into Germany then here the word is there in Germany begins to strike Luther's heart and then from that and Luther then it moves across the English Channel and then from the English Channel it makes its way to this scripture right here a land a place that's prepared by God now watch this this is God overseeing this you won't find this in the history books you won't find this in secularism you'll find a lot of other things but God this this place that you and I live in right now on top of this land it was a place prepared by God reserved for a work and a finishing up in this hour now watch this here in verse 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness now this is very this is very a tremendous did awfully no not all but the woman fled who's the woman the elect the elect fled and left the elect go with the light is that right but true Lutheran's who might have still been around when Wesley begin to break forth with sanctification they moved on with the lights because what it was they weren't tied so they weren't tied to words they had met Jesus Christ you see their life they they knew that pillar fire and they moved on it was the same way with those a true Methodists that would move on when the gifts the restoration of gifts would begin to take place here and fall and the Spirit of God began to manifest that the same way it would be true Pentecostals that would then move on in in the advancement of the light within this hour so within this the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God that they should feed her there notice the purpose of it she fled to this wilderness a place that was prepared of God for what reason so that she could have a better living so that she could just do whatever she wanted to do not so it was a place that she might be fed of God now think of this here when you look at it brother Branham puts it like this and I didn't include these I'm just going to refer to these throughout brother Graham says from the persecution of the church and all through those dark ages that people come over here what is America America was established at Plymouth Rock for one purpose freedom of religion and the Bible said that she fled from the dragon and had a place prepared in what now what's the dragon who was the dragon Rome she fled from the face of the serpent she fled from that Roman system that had been encroaching and kept moving along as light would come open what what what happened after light and word and truth would be revealed after so long a time remember there were fallen angels that would get ride around there and then they would begin to influence and you would have people who didn't meet the God that Luther met they didn't meet the God that Wesley met people who did not meet the same God that Williams Seymour and many of those out there in Azusa Street and the same thing applies to us in our messy it must be a meeting with the Living God not enough just to know about the truth but it must meet face to face with God because he's the one you got to know his voice now to think about this what was America he said when she come here she was nourished for a limited time a time time of dividing just about a hundred and sixty-five or seventy years where she had a place prepared you know it's amazing to me even in just a little bit of countries that I've been able to travel in it's amazing to me the advancement in this in this in this country right here compared to other places I've been it is absolutely incredible how that this advancement would be within here and I know there's all kinds of sin I know that it that sin is just heaped up but to think within just a little bit of time of how much has has blossom forth I'll talk about a lot of the things of infrastructure and roads things you and I just take for granted but I'll tell you what in other countries they'd like to be able to have roads like you and I have even if it's a road that would be a country road with chip and seal you understand what I'm saying but you see within it notice the scripture depicts this nation our nation as something of very young as a lamb a lamb rising up out of the land think about it here when we look at the pilgrims when they came they came here it was in the early 1600s there had already been others that had already visited here already been settlements and different things that had set up here and to think just within this time a Declaration of Independence in 1776 and you know look from this time 1776 to 1956 and 1956 is when the Spirit of God would call the Prophet in Billy Graham was called in Oral Roberts was called in they did not understand why they were being called back here to America and canceling all of their revivals across the country it's because that God was going to give a final reckoning and invitation whereby America would either accept the gospel or she would reject it and we know she rejected it in 1956 so too think of it she wasn't even 200 years old when she rejected the gospel of Jesus Christ you know what she did she rejected the very reason that she was here turn right around and rejected it this place was a place prepared by God a place whereby that he might feed his people we're not talking about natural grain we're talking about the freedom to hear the Word of God the Word of God that'll change a lot sustain a life it puts an anchor and a divine connection between God and His creation that they can be fed that their dependency is not upon a church upon a man but their dependency is upon the Living Word of God these were people who believed that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I ask you who put that burden in their heart I'll tell you who put that burden in the heart the same God who put the burden in Abraham's heart to be a pilgrim and leave his land the same God who put the burden in Luthor's heart to throw down that Eucharist and everything else and say that's not the body of my Lord that same burden that pulsates in your heart this morning to know there is a land beyond the river the same God the same God now think of this here the rejection of the gospel in 1956 my and then another important event which I don't know if I'll get to this morning but the election of President Kennedy in 1960 of which the prophet called the worst mistake this nation ever made him glory be to God now watch here brother BAM goes on and says now the woman fled he's quoting the scripture the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of God God prepared America for freedom of religion that she would be fed there a thousand two hundred and threescore days bloom M goes on to pick it up in Jezebel religion the parallel he said oh it's striking the parallel between Israel of the Old Testament and America now both of them were great nations both of them had been founded and people had come here because of religious persecutions think of how that Israel with Pharaoh they were in bondage they had been deprived of privilege they had become slaves watch this now but he said God made them a promise in the Bible what was Israel going by a promise in the Bible Moses did not walk down there was something that had been he had hatched out no it would have never worked come on friends it had been like leading a bunch of people out and they'd have been drinking kool-aid and all and would have come up died dead you understand if this was not something that was hatched up it was the Spirit of God who remembered the promise that he made to Abraham God does not forget his promises he does not forget his word but God will remember his word in the season though it might seem like he's forgotten but God is always right on time you see what God had to wait for is for the people who were dwelling in that land known as the amorite God had to wait to the kaepa fool you see Israel was looking at one thing Moses was looking at one thing but there's a part of the scripture that could not swing it into full into full manifestation because they were waiting on that cup of iniquity to fill up in order for there to be a release from Egypt you see every part of the prophecy of God has so many calls within it so many little parts of that will and everything must move and synchronized with in time nothing can get out of time but God will see to it that every stays in time and here's the wonderful thing just as much as God sees to it that the prophecy stays inside if you and I are a part of that word my brother and sister the same Holy Spirit that is manifesting that prophecy as we being a part of the word oh my God will see to it we do not miss what we need to be here any else aren't you glad about that now watch this God and made them a promise in the Bible or in his word and by his prophets that he give them a land and they'd come into this land and drove back the occupants of that land and had possessed their inheritance let me pause here just for a moment you see a lot of the things I don't dabble a whole lot in secularism I don't even doubt anything entertain myself with the politics and all the stuff of this world you know it's like right now young people you go to college plug your ears and just say God give me what I need so I get my certificate and be able to get the job if you're going there because I'll tell you right now some of the greatest reprobates are the professors in those places some of them they have no idea about what is the real foundation and the real principle of these things they want to paint everything like oh it's oppression whoever told them that come on somebody we're talking about a spirit what man what has never talked about is how one tribe would dominate another tribe come on somebody I stood right there brother worm you know what I'm talking about I stood right there in the cape coast castle one thing in our history book will tell us is how the white man went into Africa and chased down all and chased down all the black men that simply is not true I stood right there in the cape coast castle and I even after the guide has mentioned it I asked him I said sir I want to ask you something again right here there's a lot of heinous things where there were English men who were there in that fortress but who brought that who brought the Africans those here who brought them in here some of their own Chiefs and chiefs from other places and sold them for tobacco sold them for liquor you don't tell my brother Michael those things stand right there in the castle's that'll never be roped in the history books you know why because if it's get back then spirits continue to move what spirit you're talking about the Roman Catholic spirit that can keep people focused off of the real thing it keeps them to where they're fighting one another instead of being focused on Jesus you see that's Satan's objective if he can divide the kingdom he can conquer it come on somebody oh my both Sammy this ain't a history course I know it's not but the Bible is a history book now look at this here they come into a land drove back the in occupants of that land and had possessed their inheritance for God had a purpose of doing that oh brother man said so is this great nation of ours we come here and on Plymouth Rock this nation was founded on freedom of religion because our forefathers had fled Roman persecution of the modern Jezebel system and had come up and stood many great persecutions and martyrdom under the false system of Jezebel oh he said God had made the promise to the church to the woman to come into this country God had a place a place that the woman the church the elect could flee to aren't you glad Satan here that Roman system bringing persecution oh it was she was trying to snuff everything out but about that time as it stepped on you notice there were times God allowed them to stand right there in the face of it I think of William Tyndale I think of John house I think of mighty men of God that stood there in labor to be able to bring this word that you and I have the Bible that you and I have impact with us there were men who gave their lives to see to it that this word would be put into our hands ultimately with the burden moving by the Spirit of God knowing that it takes the Word of God and the Spirit of God moving on that word to move it into the hearts of the people people would stand but about that time after God said enough testimony has been given enough testimony that these are people who have not been brainwashed they met me Locke the Hebrew children they didn't hear from God that God was going to meet him in the fiery furnace but they stood they said we don't know what God's gonna do but we know he's going to deliver us from your hand either way and God was silent in that time and he let them stand and what was it their faith was proved in the midst of that time and then God brought a delivered same way even in this time here where the enemy would come in and God will allow a testing and a trying of that word that revelation that had been given in that hour and then there would be another place that would open up here Wesley OMA sanctification by the blood and then there would be another part that would open up aren't you glad that God has a place that has been prepared for you and aren't you glad that after the test and trying's are over here after we have been proven out that you and I have a place that is prepared for you if I go away I will prepare a place for you aren't you glad you have a place prepared by God think of this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost under God's inspiration they were motivated you know it takes inspiration you can't do anything without inspiration you've got to be inspired there was never an artist that you're a picture just because he was bored there's never been a writer who wrote a book because he was bored there's never been a songwriter who wrote a song simply because he didn't have anything else to do that day it was inspiration that struck and when inspiration strikes you cannot control the timing of when that inspiration strikes you've just got to be ready to capture it and be captured by let me tell you something that God was moving within the hearts of these men and women and they were being moved by the Spirit of God you know they didn't have all the things that this is the prophecy this is exactly what's taking place but you know they were being by the Spirit of God there was a hunger that was rising in their life you know he wasn't what they heard about Jamestown it wasn't what they heard about Roanoke Island it was not about all those things that they heard about they did not come here because it would be better soil to plant potatoes no sir these were not carnal people these were people who were inspired by the same Holy Ghost that inspires the elect children of God today they came here to this place knowing that their life would be in jeopardy in the voyage across that ocean they knew their life they didn't even have a promise there would be a house or something awaiting of they did not know how they would do it you say what is said that was motivating them the liberty and freedom to be able to worship God that's what was motivating these people Omaha you see brother BAM says God had a reason for it God was going to show the world what he could do with a little band of people that wanted freedom and freedom of religion to serve God it don't take a big a lot of people it just takes people with a hunger for God come on somebody he don't take a big group of people it only took a group of people who had a hunger for God you realize that many of them died on the voice over half of them died on the voice over here I think they started out 106 and in the 51 of them died and there more of them that died within the first few of the first year or whatever more that was here even some of them McCain went ahead and returned back years later but there were those who came here with the original purpose I'm telling you right now they were right in step with the prophecy of Almighty God you see it isn't something that they felt spiritual but they were spiritual they were spiritual because they failed and they were not going to give heed to that Roman Catholic system that had already taken over that angling in church had a different name but it was still that Jezebel system they realized you know what during a man that's my Holy Ghost they stood for that the Holy Ghost it is an inner power a conviction of divine truth it was not something that they were going to be ruled by men you know what it was it was a desire within their heart the same as it was within Abraham there is a land it God had stirred their hearts think about it there had already been a discovery made of this place somebody had already been here and they heard about it they heard about this land and when they heard about this land what they envisioned was Liberty that was exactly what God had in mind are you with me now think of this here a purpose brother Bremen goes on now I think these are important statements brother Ben goes on to say in time tested or faith produces the goods he said here's where our forefathers landed for this freedom of religion on Plymouth Rock it is from these sacred soils here that praying men and women went forth to establish this great spiritual economy that we are privileged to serve today no American could be ashamed of their forefathers who landed in this country brother Branham I wish I could say the same thing today but then again he said no American could be oh let us have meal I'm not being political I'm just saying what he said he said no America come on no American could be ashamed of their forefathers who landed in this country went to church packing guns whoo who came here for freedom of religion went on horseback covered in old wagons fought the Indians and so forth to get to go to church lord have mercy what kind of excuse to you and I have they fought to go to church it was not something easy they didn't have some kind of a nice car and it was an easy passage sometimes coming to the house of God it meant their life but the reason they were here the reason daily they did what they did is because of their desire and hunger to share living car they didn't want to serving by a Creed they didn't want to serve him by a Dogma these were not people that were saddled with forms they knew there's a living person I must have that person [Applause] hello glory what a parallel between here this nation in Israel remember as I refute uu refer to a few places in the scripture when God met Moses he told him I want you to go down I want you to carry this message to my people I've come down and I'm sending you I want you to bring them out of the land that they're in and I want you to bring them unto a land that floweth with milk and honey he was reminding them of the promise that belonged to him then you find when Moses comes down if I could refer just to a few places as they stood there before Pharaoh Moses would express in Exodus 5 thus saith the Lord God of Israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness see Moses when he came down the word of the Lord did not come down there to make life easier as a matter of fact when the word began to move on the scene life got a little bit harder it didn't get easier it got harder as it came closer to the fulfillment to think of how that when they stood there before Pharaoh and they would make known of these things Pharaoh simply envisioned it he's moved on by spirit to God said I'll allow his heart to be hardened and you know what Pharaoh's interpretation of this is these people are idle they got too much time on their hands so you know what I'm going to do they can go gather their straw now than themselves why why why did he say that that they will not regard vain words do you see what Satan the scoffer and the mark marker would want to do as though the promise of God the coming of the Lord I tell you right now this morning don't you look for it well it might be a month off it might be a year off it may not be an hour or a minute off don't regard what's being spoken as pain words the promises are sure and remember the spirit of the scoffers in the last day 2nd Peter chapter 3 it says that men will look and say well all things continue as they always have been really it takes spiritual discernment you've got to have spiritual discernment in this hour in order to have spiritual discernment you need to be spirit filled and to be spirit filled is where you have your own experience with Jesus Christ to where you're hearing his voice notice favor goes on to tells him what's how favor oh then we'll start to relax you see the devil was gonna chest and say are you gonna stand on this are you gonna stand on it what God's revealed to you are you gonna stand on it see it isn't just what he's revealed and then look they're out of the land but no what's revealed has it captured your heart to where there's a stand on the inside so much so that Pharaoh you know subtly here he comes along it says to tell you what an accident you can go sacrifice but just do it right in the land I mean you can stay right here and Moses said we will not do that we will not do that the Egyptians would rise up upon us they don't they don't want no part of it you see what it is - a real heart that's desiring to worship God hid in just any place here's a chosen place that God has for the believers to worship and let me tell you something that place it's not a land that place is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the gate that's the place to worship how many times you know you'd find brother Ramos who has moved under the inspiration of God come out of this mess coming out of her my people the exact voice of the scripture and how many times then brother Brandt would tell the people he would tell them and say you know what go ahead and go on back to your church you'd be a real good Christian you know what it is if those people got a real true taste and a real good dose of the Holy Ghost and the Word of God had struck their heart there would not be anything there within that church or that place that would be able to hold him there might be other people that would stay there but there would be people who would flee to a place that God had prepared you see the Bible said that the woman fled into the wilderness she was not packed away she fled there was a way that was open where did that way begin it began a lot farther and farther back than the Mayflower or the Speedwell that way itself it was made in their heart that Liberty was burning in the heart that high cancer the Lord God freely it was already in their hearts the way was already in their hearts when Moses said no I ain't staying here you let us go three days journey three days journey not just one day not just two days but three days not just justification not just sanctification come on all the way we want to hold a feast unto the Lord glory be to God a complete separation why a separation where a new land is opened unto us call him be to God in the highest oh my and Pharaoh said I'll let you go and you may sacrifice to the Lord your God watch this again you may sacrifice to the Lord your gone in the wilderness but just don't go overboard I mean too far keep your senses about you that's the problem census we keep our census and we need to lose our census we're wasn't so interested in keeping our mind instead of losing our mind and that we might find the mind of Christ see Satan's willing to make compromise and you say blessed God I'm standing on what God did in mind in my life you're going to be tested you will be tried and the devil will say hey it's alright no problem you can just worship God right here in the land I mean after all you know it's about your heart where your heart is your body will follow you can't tell me you can't tell me or tell anybody else my heart is really for God and your body is somewhere else because if your hearts for God then it will cause your body to stand in the presence of God come on friends I mean either we've got quickening power on the inside of us or we don't either we've got the fulfillment of the word that talks about the quickening power of God that's able to bring this body and subjection or we don't let's not kid ourselves let's not fool ourselves we're living in a late hour Satan will make you prove when Daniel purposed in his heart he said I'm not going to defile myself with the Kings meat or his wine Daniel was living right in the midst of Babylon but he was still living and overcomer he was still live in a separated life I believe Daniel a testimony he didn't have the Holy Ghost like you and I have it but what a testimony it is that the children of God in this hour being able by the grace of God by the Holy Ghost to live right in the midst of hail Satan seen and yet living and overcoming live how is that possible because the overcomer is on the inside and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death you can love your life God let him know you're gonna I brought you on eagle's wings in Exodus 19 and I brought you to myself in Exodus 23 god affirmed to Moses then I'll send my angel before thee to keep being the way and to bring the end of the place which I have prepared only heed his voice so this angel of the Lord that was in their midst was not a mute he had a voice so the pillar fire led him by the word it was the age of the Lord in the word leading the people come on friends it wasn't Moses words Moses in order for Moses to know what to do oh I love how the prophet puts it in God does God change his mind he said Moses looked up there of that pillar fire he got his information from the logos that was following them in order to tell the children of Israel what to do you see it was a channel that God had in that hour of channel it was God's grace that had been provided for them that they might know God's will and pathway through the wilderness aren't you glad God has provided that for you and I also Moses think of how Moses within the midst of it he would ask Lord let me see your face he would ask them and without scar Lord the one thing that oh that that means the most to us is that your presence would go with us Moses said if your presence doesn't go with us then don't you carry us one more step you see Moses even though he was given the word he realized that the word itself it is a possession that belongs to us as believers but it must be the waymaker himself the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord that is directing the camp of the Lord and opening up the way and the promises and so Moses said we are just content to abide where you are biting and when it's time to move when you're moving we want to move and he said it shall be how is it that it shall be the house how will we be distinguished from all the other nations of this earth is it not in that Dai presence will go with us well was it a Moses here was pressing that desire that it's not just enough to be a church but in order to be the church spoken of in the Word of the Living God it must be the Holy Ghost Omaha no wonder the Prophet said that a church itself or it can have everything so right like a bejeweled corpse that's laying in a casket but without the Holy Ghost he said it is nothing there must be the Holy Ghost in the camp to lead the Church of the Living God it must be the Holy Ghost supply what for you and I have meet up he's taking the word that he delivered for his prophet in this hour and he is ministering to our needs and that same one ministering to our needs that deals with our life is the same Lord God that'll pack us across the Jordan one of these mornings notice God goes on to say here he gave warning and Deuteronomy that they would keep the statutes and the judgments that were being given you see this is a great learning lesson Liberty is not just do whatever you want to do that's called confusion you know what that comes out of that comes out of was it is it Alexander Crawley who were the guy that the Satanic guy do whatever thou fill us to do that don't come from God God sir Liberty has boundaries he didn't let the sea say I'll tell you what see you just go wherever you want to go today daddy loves you you go wherever you want to go today no he said I've got the moon here and yours boundary set for you God even has ways that the water will flow him water flows south or it'll float north there's certain ways depending on where it's positioned on the hemispheres of this earth who orchestrated that Almighty God everything has an order and must abide within its order it has boundaries when God replace Israel in the land there were boundaries that were special for it let me tell you something we ought to be zealous about the boundaries that God has given us in Christ we ought to be selya's about taking every bit that God has given to us in this hour and also just as Elias with maintaining what God has given us but he told him when people begin to see the statutes and the judgments in your life they will say this is what they'll say when they see the word in action in your life they will say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people for what nation is there so great who have gods so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is and all things that we call on him for what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day and then God makes a very important statement I believe it's verse 11 he said don't forget to tell you teach your children your children's children these things and he says especially especially the day you stood before the Lord your God you see it's more than just statutes and judgments we want to teach them the word of the Lord but what what are we talking about with teaching submitting to his word instructing them in the word of truth this house is guided by the Holy Ghost the token is applied here you can they can memorize all the statutes all the judgments but friends let it be that the life that is behind specially the day that thou students there let it be the life of the Holy Ghost the token on display that punctuates the word the statutes that's being expressed because it's that life it's him him who is the word that they will heed to see God was letting him know this you know brother Brown will make this statement he made Israel the most mightiest nation in the world and she stayed that way until she got out of the will of God what did he do with America he made her the mightiest nation in the world until she's getting out of the will of God he said all then he goes into talk about America our forefathers who came here for religious freedom the vehm goes on to say I want you to catch this these Americans he talks about George Washington they came across the valley for Juno and has been in multiple times when I went to New York and then this last time when I drove up to Connecticut and I think about as I crossed the Delaware River there there's not a time that I don't cross then my boys even this last time going to Connecticut I said it again I said there's not a moment I can't think about when they cross through ice George Washington prayed all night it wasn't because he was such an expert general sometimes what you get to looking at is this outside part but what was it what was it these men were men of God they had spiritual discernment about their life you tell me how the majority of that arm not even having shoes how is it that they could have won the war that they want how is it because God was with them because they were with God you know why it was the purpose the motive the reason behind it how did they get the right motive how did they get the right purpose they were in line with God you think there might not have been things that try to come up in their heart but I believe with all my heart spiritual men like George Washington to him they could hold those men and hold him to a place I'll tell you when they're giving out orders you might as well say they were taking texts and preaching there was there was lives and hearts my brother and sister that were being held in line with one principle with one motive with one purpose you know what it was freedom liberty that's what was pulsating in their heart that's the same thing that's moved into your heart that's moved into my heart when that earnest that downpayment that deposit of the Holy Ghost has moved into your heart from the other ha it's a witness by the liberty that you are born of right now that there is a place I'll never grow old I'll never be sick but I'll be in his presence day after day moment after moment what is it that keeps you going that Liberty on the inside oh there's a Liberty bail that's much greater than one hung in Philadelphia and when that Liberty Bell was read that was another bail that was rent that was one whose side was ripped on Calvary and there was a loosening there of reconciliation a loosening of Redemption a loosening and a judgement was poured out upon the Prince of this world all of those who were waiting in paradise that had offered up the lamb by revelation they were standing there they were hungry they were waiting what were they looking for that land Abraham was looking for that land they had a principle the Prophet said something that they had to fight for Psalms 33 12 blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord brother branham just flatly says it he said this nation is a Catholic nation and it's the truth because of what she did it is a Catholic nation he said because of her leader now hold on you see friends don't try to save this sinking ship just make sure you get in the gospel ship just make sure that you don't sink trying to turn it around because there ain't no turning it around now the Lord is that spirit 2nd Corinthians 3:17 and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty you see God let him know and Deuteronomy 6 I'm just referring to these places here God let them knowing Deuteronomy 6 when you get in the land you start enjoying wells that you didn't dig you start living in houses that you didn't build you start eating no vineyards that you didn't plant when you start drinking water from wells you didn't dig what is it he's provided at all but notice what he told them be careful that you don't forget the LORD thy God which brought you out of Egypt what was he telling them don't get comfortable in your surroundings why because why were they in the land they had to get back in the land in order for the Messiah to come when you get in the land start looking for the Messiah don't get comfortable with all of this you know you say well why did God provide wells why did God do this because God said if you'll just keep me first in your life I will make sure you have a good success but when you try to start doing it on your own and you belong to me I'll make sure you fall flat on your face so that you can recognize you're here you're here not to serve your purpose you're here to serve my purpose and that in itself is the tender mercy of God let me try to close here how did this happen of where we see it now how did it get to where it is now familiar scripture to us Isaiah 14 how are their fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground look at these last words which didst weaken the nation's Satan cannot overthrow God's purpose but what he seeks to do is weaken once it gets weakened by what not heeding to the Lord God he seeks to weaken little by little like he did in the Garden of Eden he just began to talk to her then he began to insert words and change words what's he doing he's weakening her the whole time he's disarming her and she doesn't even know it this is Satan's tactics thou didst weaken the nation's Daniel chapter 2 verse 40 and the fourth Kingdom speaking of this that of the Rome and the fourth Kingdom shall be as strong as iron watch this for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise see the iron this beak act that the characteristic of this fourth kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar the dream Daniel interprets is this of the Roman kingdom the same spirit that's been throughout the earth all the way from the beginning that dragon we read about the red dragon Satan the devil oh it's all speaking of one and the same person he has his own church he has his own religion he has his own preachers come on friends notice this he breaks into pieces what does this iron do it breaks into pieces and subdues all things it comes in with flatteries flatteries comes in with flatteries moving things to pieces very very innocent the Bible says in Revelations 13 I'm coming down I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth notice not out of water out of the earth this is the place that God had prepared for the woman to flee here she is revelations 13 America represented as a woman here she is and I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon notice when it first comes up like a lamb like a Lamb of God freedom of religion freedom of worship but they had two horns you see this lamb never became a ram is that right brother Ram takes us and lets us know he said what this is that's our American Buffalo and do you realize under President Obama is when they actually put forth that this to be a national symbol of the United States the American bison I've got the articles right in front of me I'm not gonna refer to him today but to notice within this time of where it sounded prophecy you see you look at and say well what God promised there but God also promised what would come about you see it never was a land notice Israel God would give him Shiloh but after a while he would move on God would give them places and Israel would be in the land but even when God brought Israel into the land Israel in the majority did not remain true to God let me tell you friends it's not a place here on this earth that'll help you to be spiritual it's a person you want to live a victorious life you can taught it you can try to take a tour of churches you can try to find them a sign this church try to find it here try to find a pair but there's one place you need to make sure you get and that's in Jesus Christ when you ever meet him face to face you then have come to your place of rest and you'll know where you belong in the body you have access then to all of that you see this is the reality it isn't that all of a sudden because that all grows old understand how many times people start a job all this is the best job in the world this is the wonderful job in the world one week two weeks three weeks five what are you doing I'm just waiting to all of a sudden some of the cons start coming out on it because it's not the Utopia with what is it you say been the same - what is it it's because there's something there the real longing a real thirst within us there is a place there is a place that is the satisfying of all things there is a place it's a longing it's a thirst and I'll tell you what when you meet the Lord Jesus Christ you have met the satisfy of your soul you might be disappointed in life this could disappoint you this could let you down this charm might flow fall through this might happen but you have met the satisfier and the sustainer of your soul and although all those other things they can try to affect you but you have met him and he really is freedom he really is Liberty there is no Liberty outside of the Lord Jesus Christ that is that land the smally it is that land of the Blessed Holy Ghost the land of the world of this hour that God has opened up to us once Satan had it all and down through the ages the Creed's and the dogmas and everything has been all sewed up and didn't want the Holy Ghost the person of Christ within the church but God here a promise by His Word just like he promised that he made a way for the woman to flee into the wilderness God by virtue of a promise of his word he opened up the way for you and I he opened up the promise within this hour for you and I and we and we lock those pilgrims that came over there you notice what they're called pilgrims no wonder brother Bantam could say an invisible union brother enim you say this is not much of a Thanksgiving message he said ho I think it's a very fitting message for the occasion they left that Roman persecution and because they left it behind you know what he was saying they died to it they left it behind then they could be married to the anointed Word of God Liberty the Holy Spirit was free to move among how did this happen in Israel how did this happen here in this United States little by little letting down on the standard of the word little by little Satan kept coming in to where brother Branham when you listen to the message hybrid religion or titled condemnation by representation brother M spends the first half of that message telling the people what did I tell you about going to the voting booth last week he let him know you made the biggest mistake this America has that it's ever done listen to me he said they voted in a man who stands for that Roman Catholic system and brother Brian asked the question how did it come that way brother Graham said it's because the voice of politics has overrode the voice of God he said if the voice of God had been proclaimed in the churches the voice of politics wouldn't have stood a chance he said but what happened in here is people sold out their birth rights and voted him in and you know what he said put him there the woman's right to vote when the Spirit of God had given him a vision back in 1931 and said the woman would rise and the woman's vote would put this one in why did it do it I find it I find it remarkable that brother M goes on to saying Jezebel religion the reason that he was put in is because people were so caught up with the political we get bigger tax cuts we'll have more money in our paycheck I know it's just a little phrase stuck right in the middle of that message but you see what it is brother have said people sold their birth rights for that right there you know what it is money love of money you gotta ask yourself the question are you planning on staying here in this world are you interested in getting out of here you see this is what the brother BAM is talking about you realize in this hour this is not the mind of William Branham this is not this is the mighty God that is speaking through that vessel I get to find the hour and the time when this Jezebel system has rose to power because of letting down letting down letting down little by little by little by little the almighty dollar took precedence how did this get in look where it's at now look right then I don't have time to read these statements to you but I want to bring it into this place can I just closed closed down on this era many of these points and I think it deserves a little bit more time than what I can give but I want to just draw you to this place right here what happened to Israel after all this Conley background brother Graham said they begin to get carefree they begin to get where they didn't care what went on they begin to get slack in their worship to God worship that God goes a lot much deeper than just here our lives our worship to God how we live and conduct our life on a daily basis in a home on the jobs and in the score they begin to get slack in their worship to God although they held a form of religion just like we have they had a form of godliness but they begin to get free with their people and they begin to bring in different heresies into the church and the worship of Balaam begin to creep in i'ma just birthrights [Music] let me just draw to this place here I believe this to be admonition for us Israel that could come to this place but they got away from the purpose of why they were in the land what happened in this land that we're in the purpose is lost freedom is preached that you can live any kind of life that ain't freedom that is not what the forefathers meant that's not what was meant whatsoever but notice what's been interpreted today no more there's a standard but in other words what word is used the same word that was used among the Roman Empire when they conquered and conquered another nation you know what the word was tolerance that's not my makeup that's exactly what history states when they took over another country in their religion they said you don't stand against it but you must tolerate them tolerance Wow that word is broadcast everywhere in it tolerate tolerate you must have tolerance we must spend for the word of God we must stand on the Word of God must stand for principles remember we are tested we will be tested we will not leave this world without being tested by every word are we gonna stand on every word I say tonight or this morning I believe we need to take the approach what Paul told the Galatian Church stand fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage you know that Liberty that struck your heart what God has started in your life what God has done in your life don't let the enemy bring you any compromise but let it be settled in your heart that it's oh it's gotta be all him I don't want to farm I want him think about Ezra Ezra that came back into that place after they had been put out of the land because of disobedience and then you had people in that hour that were wanting to compromise I think of this morning how just my heart it ring out in this morning or last night Ezra stood in that place and said God had given us grace to return to this place he given us a nail in this place and we will hold the standard here remember Nehemiah Nehemiah went right down through the scrolls there were men who were claiming to be priests there claiming to be a part of it and me and I went right down through the scrolls and he said you're not a part of what number what is written here in the word you don't belong in the priesthood get out you with me these were not why would they were these guys saying these things to be harsh it was not that they recognized God has brought us back here there's a standard to be kept I'll tell your friends if we get Lexton our thinking if we get laxed in our our ways you better be careful that you're not left behind hold on the same you're preaching fear I'm preaching reality it's not because you come to a message Church that you're safe or just because you know that brother Branham is the prophet of the hour or the messenger now you better know the prophet of the hour the Holy Ghost you better know the Spirit of Truth you better have a real true experience with God if you don't have an experience with God you will be left behind in the tribulation that is a fact it's to be in a place of freedom well I can't get over this I can't get over this there is a place of freedom there is a land of freedom come on somebody there is a place of adoption there is a land of liberty there is a place as the word went forth and it rose within the heart of these Pilgrim Fathers to recognize there is a place that we can worship freely I'm telling you this morning there is a place there is a person where you can worship freely you can live a real godly life you don't have to worry about what family says or what they say on the job but when you meet him and come into this place it's him it's all that matters he will equip you Jacob to meet he saw that's what he'll do there is a place and see Israel came into this place but what Israel started to do is let down I mean such wonderful delicacies such wonderful things I think God for the revealing of this word but listen friends don't you get complacent don't get complacent you ought to be more prayer if the words really struck in our heart it ought to be more of a design hope brother Samuel I see so much sin why don't you quit looking around come on somebody the Bible says in that X is equal chapter 9 then it says I want you with an corn to seal those who cry and sign for the abomination of the wicked that's done in the city I say does anybody got a burden a burden not about all everybody's failing everybody is this everybody's that Jesus ain't failed Jesus ain't gonna fail Jesus has a bride Jesus has a bride that's an overcomer there are overcomers in this hour but Satan's tactic is to try to get you to look like the word ain't being effective but the word is effective the word is having an effect on his people after all those words that the Prophet told us very simple how can you have faith for somebody else and you don't have the faith for your own self but once you got the faith for yourself you've got that token then you know hey that same power of God did the impossible for me it can do it for them too you say you've got the faith that's needed in this hour the faith to face impossibilities Paul letter no there's gonna be Grievous wolves Paul wants you to stay with us no I've done my part now the word that's been spoken he who spoke it through me will bring it into effect but I'm gonna let you know just so you're not startled there's gonna be grievious Wolf's rise up there's gonna be men rise up from among your ranks speaking perverse things there's gonna be ministers as Paul goes on to tell in Corinthians our deceitful workers he lets the church to know this don't be alarmed by this but what does he say stand stand take unto you the full armor of God that you might be able to stand I don't know what ground that God has given you but whatever ground that God has given you you not only had to fight to take it you said well God gave it to me yeah he did it God gives it to you but you gotta fight to take it and once you take it you gotta fight to keep it if there's no such thing as setting back on a picnic the land is a land of overcoming and in this land remember has Paul our beloved Paul would say I press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ Jesus my Lord you say old brother Paul said brother I count not myself to have apprehended but uh I seek after that I might apprehend that which I'm a pretend enough Paul recognize I've got a race that I'm running but I just jogging I ain't just running a race just be running with buddies I'm running a race to obtain the prize I bring in my body in subjection being temperate in all things decisions that I'm making on will this further my walk with God or will it hold me back you say you've got to make that decision each and every one of us have to make that decision day after day and moment after moment either you're gonna have take more ground or you're gonna lose ground but you're the only one that can determine that but there are promises I'll tell you this morning there are promises to be taken in God there's a promise of the body change there are promises to be obtained within this hour they are not things that are a pipe dream it's a reality promises that are real you say I wait till I get this and then I'll get real serious with God how about getting serious with God right now you keep putting it off you're let Pharaoh keep telling you you can worship in the land or maybe you can just go a day outside of the land but why don't you just draw the line this morning and say you know what I'm not just going just one day out to feast I'm going on a three-day journey I'm going all the way with the Lord all the way let's bow our heads dear Jesus Lord a place that's been prepared for us this nation that we live in warden I hear how your prophet would say it over and over still one of the greatest nations to live in the Lord where it's come to right now it's a place Lord God that we're looking to leave and not just hear of this nation but there's a bride all over the world Lord God that's being brought together in you the fulfillment of your word of Ephesians 1:11 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you would get there all things in Christ even one Lord it's you drawing and has drawn us together [Music] Lord not in a club not as a gathering of people but in you in you or Jesus I asked this morning [Music] Father on behalf of each and every one your God you know the needs throughout this assembling this morning I pray God if there's a longing in the heart there's a place for that longing to be fulfilled there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond Lord I pray this morning that God made that great libertine that great sounding of jubilee May had strike within the hearts I pray father that if there be any Lord where they've let Pharaoh talk them to just staying around in the land well they believe the message but they just they really haven't made a step they haven't stepped out they believe it by knowing that it's truth mentally but they haven't really made a step I pray this morning Lord may they take courage to know the Lord had sure desire but they would be free because just to have a knowledge is not freedom but Lord freedom is the person of Jesus Christ or maybe they've made a step out but they realized this morning I want to go all the way I want to go all the way and feast with my lord I want to open the door that he will come in because the latch I've got control over the latch I want to open the door to have a feast with my lord where he would come in sup with me and I with him hearts this morning the Lord throughout this building God our hearts tremble with the responsibility of this hour knowing that it's not upon iron our strength but it's us yielding [Music] there's a cloud of many witnesses around us they're Saints that's already gathered on the other side Lord God from down through the ages and some Lord that's been gathered over the years from around our ranks Lord they've already overcome their standing there in a body you prepared for them [Music] they've lived for your coming as we're living for your coming lord I pray Heavenly Father this morning [Music] may we take courage may Lord God from within our hearts we stand fast in the Liberty realizing Lord that Satan does not come in like a firestorm but he comes in subtly he comes into weakened weakened weakened little by little by little the Bible says that Delilah pressed on Samson daily it says the same thing for Potiphar's wife regarding Joseph oppressed upon him Delilah wanted to know what's the secret of your strength Lord I pray this morning throughout this congregation God calls our hearts to reflect deeply are we still standing on the same ground that we've stood on when you got a hold of our life or are there things that we've compromised on under the heading of wisdom god help us I pray right now father is your tender mercy what poor God throughout this congregation Lord every one of our hearts Lord this is our heritage Lord got your word that you've delivered to us in this hour which is not a new word Lord it's the prophesied promise of this hour from the scripture Lord a restoring of the original Bible faith a land where the church had gotten out of but it's a land we've been brought back to Lord father I pray that from the depths of every heart may there be a real renewing here this morning Lord realizing we're in the fight the fight of our life the battle is on it's a heated engagement this is the greatest battle ever fought spoke in the Daniel chapter 12 a time of trouble such as there never was the battle that the Prophet would stand here in this time and say there's a battle that's fixin to be engaged here in a little while Lord we're right here in this time a time Lord God were this bride the second Eve is being tested Lord Jesus we need you Lord more now than we ever did him help us Lord from within our hearts or God made the vision be fresh wood may every decision Lord that's made may it be passed through the word filter may it be evaluated and looked at what would my lord same with this draw me closer to him or take me further away or God may every whispering voice of Pharaoh may it be broken from around the hearts of your people Lord and may father rise within the hearts to say I'm not just gonna stay here in the land I ain't going out just a little bit I'm going all the way all the way I'm going all the way until I fall into the arms of Jesus granted Lloyd this place that you prepared for us and we're longing Lord for that land oh god granted Lord may there not be one that'll miss it and look Oh granite Lord God may there not be one thing Lord that captivates them beyond your presence Lord may you be Lord God the very theme of their heart may you be the one Lord that is set before him Lord and they seek after Oh God and everything surrendering every part of our life Lord nor did any part Lord this to be cleaned up or God now you've given us the grace Lord God that it might be brought in line granite Lord Jesus help us lord I pray may God the same conviction that's upon Lord the Congregation upon hearts right now Lord God don't pull it back Lord even when they get home but may it continue Lord until father all things are satisfied with you I pray Lord it's you it's you that we love learning it's not because this building is recognized as a church that that's not what makes it a church that's not what makes it a place of worship but it's hearts that have a desire to hear from you to live for you Lord living for your coming grant it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] very shameful you like to
