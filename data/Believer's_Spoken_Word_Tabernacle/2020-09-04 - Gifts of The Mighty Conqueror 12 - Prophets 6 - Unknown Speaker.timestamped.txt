[40:02] in our midst and i want to make mention
[40:04] to you i'd like to meet real quickly
[40:06] real quickly in the conference room with
[40:08] the
[40:09] musicians all the musicians and the
[40:11] songwriters just real quickly after the
[40:13] service and back there in the conference
[40:15] room
[40:16] and
[40:17] so if we could do that
[40:20] let's look here in the scriptures
[40:23] in deuteronomy 18
[40:25] i'm just going to go ahead and go there
[40:27] first to
[40:29] begin with and
[40:33] just like to say it's so good to see see
[40:35] different faces here just really really
[40:37] good to see you and
[40:39] and
[40:40] so glad that he's here
[40:42] amen amen
[40:46] let's look here in the word of the lord
[40:50] we've been looking at this here
[40:53] out of ephesians 4. i'm not going to
[40:55] read from there but we've been looking
[40:57] at
[40:58] one of the gifts of the mighty conqueror
[41:00] that god would set in the church
[41:02] is that of prophets and we recognize
[41:05] that that that that term prophets it
[41:09] means one who foretells or tells forth
[41:12] under divine inspiration
[41:14] and and the
[41:16] and any any any preacher every preacher
[41:19] would could fall in underneath that when
[41:21] truly under the inspiration of the holy
[41:23] spirit but we're not just talking about
[41:26] when we're looking at this here in the
[41:27] scripture what we've been dealing with
[41:29] not just talking about just a a preacher
[41:32] a pastor apostle a teacher evangelist
[41:35] but we're talking about when god would
[41:37] send
[41:39] a man to
[41:41] an age or god sends a promise of his
[41:45] word
[41:46] to deliver his word
[41:48] to his people and that's what we're
[41:50] talking about that's what we're dealing
[41:52] with and that's what we're looking at
[41:53] that the blessedness of what god and
[41:56] god's mercy and his care that he would
[41:58] give to us so i want to just look here
[42:00] pick this up in deuteronomy 18 12.
[42:04] and god is talking about why he's going
[42:06] to dispossess
[42:08] the inhabitants that are already in the
[42:11] land
[42:12] before he brings israel into it he says
[42:15] for all
[42:16] all that that do these things are an
[42:18] abomination unto the lord now he's
[42:20] talking about all those who were you
[42:22] know given to necromancing and
[42:24] witchcraft and everything they were
[42:25] seeking it comes down to one thing they
[42:28] were seeking other source other sources
[42:31] for their leadership
[42:33] and so because of that it became
[42:35] apparent in their life and this is why
[42:37] god's going to put them out
[42:39] so he says and because of these
[42:41] abominations the lord thy god doth drive
[42:44] them out from before thee
[42:46] thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy
[42:50] god that means a completeness and a
[42:53] wholeness of self
[42:54] for these nations which thou shalt
[42:57] possess hearkened unto observers of
[43:00] times and unto diviners
[43:03] but as for thee
[43:05] the lord thy god hath not suffered thee
[43:07] so to do
[43:09] what a blessing
[43:11] i say it's a blessing to be able to hear
[43:14] from god
[43:16] it's a blessing to be under his
[43:17] leadership and not to be given to all
[43:21] the other voices
[43:23] it's a blessing to have that of where
[43:26] god leads us into life and a real
[43:29] reality of himself
[43:31] amen could we go on in verse 15
[43:34] the lord thy god will raise up unto thee
[43:37] a prophet from the midst of thee
[43:40] of thy brethren like unto me and unto
[43:44] him
[43:45] shall you hearken
[43:46] according to all that thou desirest of
[43:49] the lord thy god in horeb in the day of
[43:52] the assembly saying let me not hear
[43:54] again the voice of the lord my god
[43:57] neither let me see this great fire
[43:59] anymore that i die not and the lord said
[44:02] unto me they have well spoken that which
[44:05] they have spoken
[44:07] and i will raise them up a prophet from
[44:10] among their brethren like unto thee
[44:13] and i will put my words in his mouth
[44:18] and he shall speak unto them all that i
[44:20] shall command him i want you just to
[44:22] catch this
[44:23] it's not enough that this man would have
[44:26] the ability to read right
[44:29] but god said i'm going to put my words
[44:33] my thoughts
[44:35] into his mouth
[44:39] it's one thing to have the bible it's
[44:41] another thing to have the word of the
[44:43] lord
[44:49] out verse 18 again i will raise them up
[44:51] a prophet from among their brethren
[44:54] like unto thee and will put my words in
[44:57] his mouth and he shall speak unto them
[45:00] all that i shall command him
[45:03] and it shall come to pass that whosoever
[45:05] will not hearken unto my words which he
[45:08] shall speak in my name
[45:10] i will require it of him
[45:12] but the prophet which shall presume to
[45:15] speak a word in my name which i have not
[45:18] commanded him to speak or that shall
[45:20] speak in the name of other gods even
[45:23] that prophet
[45:24] shall die
[45:26] brother bran picks that up and says when
[45:28] that happens he said it isn't
[45:30] necessarily that that man dies right
[45:32] there
[45:33] it's that death has set in
[45:36] death has set in on his life
[45:39] spiritual death sets in
[45:43] and if thou say in thine heart how shall
[45:46] we know the word which the lord hath not
[45:50] spoken
[45:52] when a prophet speaketh in the name of
[45:54] the lord if the thing follow not nor
[45:57] come to pass
[45:58] that is the thing which the lord hath
[46:00] not spoken
[46:02] but the prophet hath spoken it
[46:04] presumptuously
[46:05] thou shalt not
[46:07] be
[46:08] afraid of him
[46:10] it doesn't matter what seems to be
[46:12] demonstrative power around him
[46:16] if what he says does not come to pass
[46:19] the teaching is off don't be afraid of
[46:22] him
[46:23] you stand upon the word amen
[46:27] we stand upon thus saith the lord
[46:32] amen
[46:34] glory be to god god bless you tonight as
[46:35] you're being seated
[46:39] so if god would bring it in this way
[46:42] as we read in the latter part of those
[46:45] verses and god would
[46:48] knowing
[46:49] that there would be
[46:51] others that would arise
[46:54] that and and and there had been others
[46:57] that arose there was a balaam
[46:59] balaam was a prophet
[47:01] balaam remember balaam was one whom
[47:04] god would move upon
[47:06] but
[47:07] recognizing that balaam himself was one
[47:11] that
[47:12] never
[47:14] had that of the word of the lord to
[47:16] really bring about
[47:18] the
[47:18] joining the people unto god but remember
[47:21] it was calling them into bondage
[47:25] and so there would be prophets that
[47:27] would arise god
[47:28] knowing that this would happen think
[47:30] about even from the garden of eden where
[47:33] satan himself when he began to talk to
[47:36] eve i mean it was uh
[47:38] if i can say it like this it was a great
[47:40] anointing
[47:41] that was there that began to fall upon
[47:44] eve in that time but the anointing that
[47:47] was coming upon her
[47:49] if she could have just tried it and not
[47:51] went by her feelings she would recognize
[47:53] that this anointing is not saying the
[47:56] same thing that god has already given us
[48:00] this is why that when the bible says
[48:02] beloved try every spirit whether it be
[48:05] of god or not
[48:06] the bible would go on to tell us in
[48:08] matthew 24 that there would be many
[48:10] false christs many false anointed ones
[48:13] and how that we would know the
[48:15] difference is by their fruit or their
[48:18] teaching of the word where where are
[48:20] they placing within the word if they
[48:22] bypass the word or they hook it up here
[48:25] or or just negate it then we recognize
[48:28] that we're standing on the word we're
[48:30] not standing up on an emotion we're not
[48:32] standing upon anointing we're standing
[48:34] on thus saith the lord amen
[48:38] and a true anointing of the word will
[48:40] always seek to position us in the word
[48:43] and build our faith in the word
[48:46] it will always it will always come in
[48:48] that measure so god
[48:50] knowing that there would be
[48:52] uh many that would arise different ones
[48:54] that would arise and they would come
[48:56] against uh israel and then we find this
[49:00] we've been looking here in the book of
[49:01] jeremiah a little bit you find that
[49:03] there were even prophets that were there
[49:06] in the time of jeremiah the time of
[49:08] ezekiel the time of isaiah there were
[49:10] others that were
[49:12] were very anointed but we recognize that
[49:15] just like those prophets that came up
[49:17] there
[49:18] and spoken spoke to ahab and said go on
[49:22] up and take ramos gilead we recognize
[49:24] that was a lion spirit that got in the
[49:27] mouth of those prophets
[49:29] now you ask everybody standing there and
[49:31] say was there anointing on in that place
[49:35] in that hour they would have told you
[49:37] there was a strong anointing but you
[49:40] recognize that every anointing must be
[49:42] tried by the word
[49:44] it's got to come back to is it tying the
[49:48] people to the word because you see if it
[49:50] ain't tying you to the word then you
[49:52] need to look where's it tying you to
[49:54] many chances and many times it's tying
[49:57] you to the reasoning of man which
[49:59] actually ties you to man and it grounds
[50:02] your faith
[50:03] so the power of god and the word does
[50:05] not become an absolute to your life it's
[50:08] grounded and god doesn't want his
[50:10] children then our faith would be
[50:12] grounded as a matter of fact god wants
[50:14] our faith to be in him not that we can
[50:17] explain it but simply we believe and
[50:20] know that he is the living god and he's
[50:22] ever present to perform the promise that
[50:25] he has made in this hour and to know
[50:28] that we are a part of that promise
[50:31] though your name may not have been wrote
[50:33] there within that promise yet when god
[50:36] manifests that promise there is
[50:38] something that just resonates within you
[50:42] that you cannot explain because it's the
[50:44] characteristic of that word being made
[50:47] manifest that's actually calling out
[50:50] your name
[50:53] just like when your name is called in
[50:54] the midst of a crowd or uh classroom or
[50:57] whatever more it gets your attention and
[51:00] this is what gets the attention of god's
[51:02] children is when he
[51:04] makes his promise real to you and i
[51:09] so
[51:10] if if if when a prophet when the when as
[51:13] he said in your heart when you say how
[51:15] am i going to know uh
[51:17] the word which the lord has not spoken
[51:20] and then he lays it down very clearly
[51:23] that you watch because what that man is
[51:26] saying will not follow
[51:30] now that that is true in that in that
[51:32] regards then we which it is true then we
[51:36] recognize the contrast that was spoken
[51:38] above that when he speaks in the name of
[51:40] the lord and it comes to pass hear him
[51:44] because it's not him that is speaking it
[51:47] is the lord speaking through him let me
[51:48] just give you examples here how that god
[51:51] will take right what was going on down
[51:54] in egypt god took miracle after miracle
[51:57] those miracles never ever helped pharaoh
[52:01] those miracles never built his faith
[52:04] into a place it never did that the only
[52:07] thing those miracles did it brought
[52:09] hardship on pharaoh and pharaoh said go
[52:12] if you only get this out of here i'll
[52:14] let the people go as soon as it was
[52:16] lifted pharaoh went right on back to
[52:18] being pharaoh but you see those miracles
[52:22] were not for the egyptians those
[52:25] miracles that were being done by god it
[52:28] was a creation of god when it was spoken
[52:31] like brother brown would say it like
[52:32] this he said when moses spoke about
[52:34] those flies coming he said when he spoke
[52:37] it there wasn't nothing right then he
[52:39] said but after just a little bit of time
[52:42] here came one green fly then another
[52:44] green fly then another green fly it
[52:47] began to multiply why it was not the
[52:50] voice of moses alone but it was the
[52:52] voice of the creator almighty god that
[52:56] had veiled himself in the voice of moses
[52:59] and he was speaking and bringing forth
[53:02] those miracles for one purpose that the
[53:05] people might recognize it is god among
[53:09] you
[53:11] amen
[53:13] it never benefited pharaoh but it
[53:15] benefited the believer
[53:20] it benefits the believer amen
[53:23] so when we when we we we we see it in
[53:26] that manner brother brown would pick it
[53:28] up like this and he says now anyone
[53:30] knows that the word of the lord comes to
[53:32] the prophet
[53:33] not to the priest but to the prophet
[53:35] that's amos 3 7. the bible said so the
[53:38] word of the lord coming to the prophet
[53:41] now stay with me now remember he didn't
[53:43] say the bible comes to the prophet he
[53:46] said the word of the lord
[53:47] [Music]
[53:48] there's a great difference than having
[53:50] having a bible and having the word of
[53:52] the lord
[53:53] we believe that the bible itself is
[53:55] god's mind in printed form
[53:59] we believe that's god's will but we need
[54:02] god to come on the scene we need
[54:05] inspiration the same one who spoke it
[54:08] and moved upon those who wrote it we
[54:11] need the inspirer of that word to come
[54:14] and make that word alive and make it
[54:16] real and when it is he manifests himself
[54:20] in that word
[54:23] nature being the same
[54:25] his character being the same
[54:27] so when we recognize this this is where
[54:31] the word of the lord comes unto the
[54:33] prophet and we know if it's the word of
[54:35] the lord and the prophet is true then
[54:38] his words are true then his words come
[54:40] to pass and that's his credentials that
[54:43] first it's the word and first god is the
[54:47] word so nothing is to be put before the
[54:49] word
[54:52] there were many many many
[54:55] uh visions and testimonies right in
[54:58] brother adam's writing brother brown's
[55:00] uh the ministry that was right there
[55:03] testimony after testimony after
[55:06] testimony things that were spoken that
[55:08] this is going to come to pass i'm
[55:10] talking about things where god would
[55:12] reveal to the prophet that there is a a
[55:14] little lamb that's caught up there in a
[55:17] certain place and and she's crying out
[55:19] for healing talking about georgie carter
[55:21] and here you know he wouldn't even
[55:23] though god could have given the name at
[55:24] that time but god didn't give that name
[55:26] at that time but he gave that vision and
[55:28] then things would continue to open and
[55:31] remember brother brown would tell us you
[55:32] can listen to it in visions of william
[55:34] branham be a good message to listen to
[55:36] or or a tape to listen to and brother
[55:39] branham as he brings that these are just
[55:41] some of the visions that god had spoken
[55:43] they weren't visions per se of the
[55:45] mysteries of god but they were there
[55:48] given by god that the elect of god might
[55:51] recognize there is something different
[55:54] about this man's ministry that stands
[55:57] out different from any other man this
[55:59] man was just not claiming things and
[56:02] talking about things and and blowing
[56:04] things up this man was speaking things
[56:08] that god was revealing to him and he was
[56:10] looking to god to bring him to pass i'm
[56:13] talking about a man that didn't even
[56:15] understand what visions were there were
[56:17] things where others in that time had
[56:20] told him that's of the devil you'll run
[56:22] yourself mine but aren't you glad that
[56:24] god in this hour he had a man that could
[56:27] be separated unto him and god would say
[56:31] this is a part of my word where men have
[56:34] ripped this out of the word i am called
[56:36] to restore my word that ain't the only
[56:39] thing he restores he restores back the
[56:42] light of sons and daughters of god
[56:46] amen it's a sign to you and i don't know
[56:52] hallelujah
[56:55] this ain't just another ministry
[56:59] oh like the white moody we're like no
[57:01] this ain't just another ministry this
[57:04] ain't me propping this up but i'm gonna
[57:06] stand and identify god has identified
[57:09] this word himself
[57:13] [Music]
[57:23] when there was disputes
[57:25] against this
[57:27] message god seemed fit there was a man
[57:30] this man wasn't a believer he was a
[57:32] critic
[57:33] and he took a picture when the prophet
[57:35] walked on the platform at houston texas
[57:38] he wasn't a believer this was a critic
[57:41] and the whole testament of george j lacy
[57:44] a chief investigator with the fbi when
[57:48] that negative prince brother the seventh
[57:50] negative when it came out brother in
[57:52] prayer it was identified that he says
[57:55] the camera lens of a photo my my mind it
[57:58] will not take psychology
[58:01] he said that is the only thing only time
[58:04] of evidence of a supernatural being
[58:07] that's been photographed oh if i can
[58:09] just preach for a minute there was a
[58:11] seed of god on the inside of you that
[58:14] one psychology could never change you he
[58:18] took a supernatural joy in this hour and
[58:22] there's a picture being developed in
[58:25] your life
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:31] you pass through the dark room of your
[58:33] own will
[58:36] you come out who are once darkness now
[58:39] are you light in the lord
[58:41] [Music]
[59:00] if it's the word of the lord and the
[59:01] prophet is true
[59:03] then his words are true
[59:05] then his words come to pass
[59:07] and that's his credentials
[59:12] there's no such thing as
[59:14] who are you linked to
[59:18] what organization you're part of
[59:22] every man of god every believer of god
[59:24] gets his papers from the same school
[59:30] are you with me i'm talking about the
[59:33] school
[59:34] of almighty god where god calls hearts
[59:37] and lives unto himself and he presses
[59:40] his own image
[59:42] to where that man or that woman we're
[59:44] not walking under the authority of a
[59:45] school we don't need the authority of
[59:47] the school we've got the authority of
[59:48] almighty god behind us you don't have to
[59:51] ask somebody can you live a christian
[59:52] life let me preach and i have you don't
[59:54] have to ask the devil can i live a
[59:56] christian life you've got authority
[59:58] under this word to rise up and live as a
[1:00:01] son and daughter of god
[1:00:04] hallelujah you don't have to ask nobody
[1:00:10] oh my
[1:00:11] god
[1:00:12] and then if he speaks a word and it
[1:00:15] happens
[1:00:16] then that shows that god has divinely
[1:00:19] set that man
[1:00:21] now we were looking at it even some
[1:00:23] weeks ago
[1:00:26] about it with ezekiel
[1:00:28] that's not the only place that's
[1:00:29] mentioned but remember when god was
[1:00:31] going to take ezekiel
[1:00:33] he told ezekiel in the word
[1:00:36] eat up the scroll he
[1:00:37] is dealing with the prophet by vision he
[1:00:40] sees a scroll that's before him
[1:00:42] now in order to eat this crow
[1:00:44] it's got to be open before him
[1:00:47] you can't eat what's not open
[1:00:49] [Music]
[1:00:51] but when it's open then you can eat it
[1:00:53] what was god saying in that vision god
[1:00:56] was letting it be known
[1:00:58] that the pattern all the way down for
[1:01:00] the prophets
[1:01:01] and the pattern for every son and
[1:01:03] daughter of god we must be a partaker of
[1:01:07] that word it cannot be something we just
[1:01:10] carry out here but it's got to be
[1:01:12] something that we become one with we
[1:01:14] become energized with the very nutrients
[1:01:17] with the very life of that word living
[1:01:20] on the inside of us that's why jesus
[1:01:21] said my words they are spirit and light
[1:01:24] he said except you eat the flesh of the
[1:01:25] son of man and drink his blood you see
[1:01:28] they were looking at it and said this
[1:01:29] man's a vampire but what they failed to
[1:01:31] recognize here was the book and that
[1:01:34] book was standing there before them and
[1:01:37] flesh this was a scroll this was that
[1:01:39] word right here on display in that time
[1:01:43] they themselves were invited to be
[1:01:45] partakers of that word
[1:01:48] now as ezekiel being a prophet let me
[1:01:49] just try to stay within this this
[1:01:51] channel he was to be a partaker of that
[1:01:54] word now remember the spirit of god
[1:01:56] spoke to him and said eat the words all
[1:01:59] that i give you so it was the spirit of
[1:02:02] god this was not ezekiel giving himself
[1:02:05] word or interpretation this was the
[1:02:07] spirit of god that was interpreting the
[1:02:10] word he was placing it inside of ezekiel
[1:02:14] you recognize that what god does with
[1:02:16] the prophets is a is a direct desire of
[1:02:19] what god would call and is calling every
[1:02:22] son and daughter of god back to back to
[1:02:24] a divine authority where the word itself
[1:02:27] is dwelling inside of you and you are
[1:02:30] inside of it in other words the word
[1:02:33] itself is living out its life through
[1:02:36] your life
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] so he would become ezekiel would become
[1:02:44] the spokesman
[1:02:46] of the thoughts of god to the people
[1:02:49] who were supposed to be the people of
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:52] now when we look at this
[1:02:54] you know it's no wonder where the
[1:02:56] scripture said in in peter that holy men
[1:02:59] of old
[1:03:00] that word holy means men
[1:03:03] who were set aside
[1:03:05] sanctified by god set apart and god
[1:03:08] could come and move through their lives
[1:03:11] they wrote the scriptures under divine
[1:03:14] inspiration
[1:03:16] things that they themselves that god
[1:03:18] would not god would put a seal on it
[1:03:21] even to them that they themselves would
[1:03:23] not even understand it even in that time
[1:03:26] but god would go ahead and lay it out
[1:03:28] and the same god that would lay it out
[1:03:30] is the same god that would then open
[1:03:32] that seal upon that inspiration when it
[1:03:35] was time for a people upon earth to come
[1:03:38] in line with that word you see god is
[1:03:41] always letting it be known that the
[1:03:43] devil don't have no tricks on him the
[1:03:45] devil doesn't have anything on him that
[1:03:48] oh my i wasn't planning this no sir if
[1:03:50] god already knows everything the end
[1:03:54] from the beginning he's already prepared
[1:03:56] of what is needed to meet the challenge
[1:03:59] of the hour
[1:04:02] so we recognize these were vessels that
[1:04:05] were set aside and yielded to the
[1:04:07] leading of the holy spirit where where
[1:04:09] even things that was against their own
[1:04:11] thinking they were more inclined
[1:04:15] to the leading of the holy spirit than
[1:04:17] their own thinking
[1:04:21] that's a very powerful
[1:04:24] call to our lives
[1:04:27] inclined
[1:04:28] god taking prisoners that are inclined
[1:04:31] more to his word to the inspiration
[1:04:34] that's coming
[1:04:36] more than we are to our own reasonings
[1:04:40] you know how it is your own reasonings
[1:04:42] if you let go your own reasonings or
[1:04:44] reason you right away from the promise
[1:04:47] your own reasonings are reasoning right
[1:04:48] away that well it can't be for you or it
[1:04:51] ain't for you but this is why the bible
[1:04:53] says he didn't say that reasonings
[1:04:55] wouldn't come it said cast them down
[1:04:58] you've got an authority and a right to
[1:05:00] cast them down now when we look at this
[1:05:02] here how god god would so take that gift
[1:05:05] or that calling that god had placed that
[1:05:08] one that was foreign and god would wrap
[1:05:10] himself in that life of that individual
[1:05:13] you know that would blind the carnal
[1:05:16] the carnal believer or the car that of
[1:05:18] the world they would so blind because
[1:05:20] all they could see was that man all they
[1:05:23] could hear was that man's voice
[1:05:25] but to the elect of god you realize the
[1:05:28] scripture said from among your brother
[1:05:30] and i'll raise one up
[1:05:32] it wasn't talking about a denomination
[1:05:34] god don't bring prophets out of
[1:05:35] denominations
[1:05:37] he talking about from the elect from
[1:05:39] among thy brethren
[1:05:42] god visits and god makes himself known
[1:05:45] and that word comes forth it's not for
[1:05:47] everybody i know sometimes we want to
[1:05:49] try to get it to everybody and i think
[1:05:51] there's a desire that we should want to
[1:05:54] share that which god has done for us
[1:05:57] what it means to us what he himself is
[1:06:00] to you and i in this hour but we
[1:06:02] recognize we did not bring ourselves
[1:06:06] into that quality that quality was
[1:06:08] laying inside of us it was a sovereign
[1:06:11] and is a sovereign work of almighty god
[1:06:14] it takes god to turn the heart it takes
[1:06:16] god to open the eyes it's not a man or a
[1:06:19] church or a system can do it it's god
[1:06:22] sovereignly moving just like a great
[1:06:24] magnet that comes through a room those
[1:06:27] that are magnetized to it will be drawn
[1:06:29] to it and they will move with that
[1:06:31] magnet
[1:06:33] hallelujah this is god's promise and
[1:06:36] fulfillment of his word so you know
[1:06:39] it's god's voice speaking through that
[1:06:41] man let me read just a few verses of
[1:06:43] scripture here are familiar in exodus 3
[1:06:45] 7. here is where god
[1:06:48] is is now he's got moses attention now i
[1:06:52] want you i want to remind you
[1:06:54] moses
[1:06:55] knew the promise all right
[1:06:57] yeah
[1:06:58] are you with me he knew it
[1:07:01] he could quote it
[1:07:04] he had been raised on it
[1:07:06] hallelujah he knew the bible
[1:07:09] but he didn't have the word of the lord
[1:07:12] personally
[1:07:16] this is why
[1:07:17] the baptism of the holy ghost the real
[1:07:20] baptism of the holy ghost is the voice
[1:07:23] of god speaking personally to you
[1:07:29] it's where god is laying claim
[1:07:32] upon your life
[1:07:36] hallelujah
[1:07:37] now here his own ideas remember moses
[1:07:40] had some had a good idea
[1:07:42] but his idea only killed one egyptian
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:47] there might be one thing you can get rid
[1:07:48] of in your life
[1:07:50] but if it's still there in your heart
[1:07:51] you ain't got rid of it
[1:07:54] but we're talking about a god who can
[1:07:56] come down
[1:07:58] he don't just replace heart valves this
[1:08:01] one said i'll give you a new heart
[1:08:03] i give you a new spirit and then i'll
[1:08:06] put my spirit on the inside of you i'm
[1:08:08] talking about one who does a full work
[1:08:11] for you and i there
[1:08:14] the bible says in verse seven here when
[1:08:16] god had got his attention and the lord
[1:08:18] said i have surely seen the affliction
[1:08:20] of my people which are in egypt and i've
[1:08:22] heard their cry by reason of their taste
[1:08:24] masters for i know their sorrows
[1:08:28] and i am come down to deliver them out
[1:08:31] of the hand of the egyptians and to
[1:08:32] bring them up
[1:08:34] out of that land onto a land a good land
[1:08:37] and large unto a land flowing with milk
[1:08:39] and honey under the place of the
[1:08:41] canaanites the hittites amorites
[1:08:42] parasites herebytes and jebusites now
[1:08:45] therefore behold the cry of the children
[1:08:48] of israel is come unto me notice how
[1:08:50] what god is declaring he declares once
[1:08:53] again in verse 9 the reason that i'm
[1:08:56] here the reason i'm come down i'm
[1:08:59] sending you down there i've come down to
[1:09:02] deliver them from the hand of oppression
[1:09:05] that they are under i've heard their
[1:09:07] crimes let me just say this now
[1:09:09] israel was going about their lives and
[1:09:12] everything was all right sure it was
[1:09:14] burdensome sure it was bothersome sure
[1:09:16] there was things that they they wish
[1:09:18] they would they wish that they were free
[1:09:21] but it but their cry went from a
[1:09:23] difference of complaining and it moved
[1:09:26] from a way that they themselves were
[1:09:29] longing for deliverance from the
[1:09:31] oppression
[1:09:32] if they could really see it and they did
[1:09:34] that there was an oppression that they
[1:09:37] were under and god said i've seen their
[1:09:39] sorrow now notice moses was out there
[1:09:42] minding his own business but god said
[1:09:45] i've heard their
[1:09:47] i wonder how many of them in that hour
[1:09:50] said why amram are you up there praying
[1:09:52] again or they looked at others why are
[1:09:55] we still praying why are we still
[1:09:56] looking for a deliverer things are worse
[1:09:59] now than it's ever been but that's when
[1:10:01] faith really declares itself faith the
[1:10:04] faith itself will find its worship in
[1:10:07] the temple of god's word it will stand
[1:10:10] there and say god has said it i may not
[1:10:12] see it feel it understand it or not how
[1:10:15] it's going to be but god said it and i
[1:10:18] am tied to that word i'm a part of that
[1:10:20] word i'm looking for god to fulfill that
[1:10:23] word
[1:10:25] god heard their cry
[1:10:29] i wonder how many times the devil told
[1:10:31] him you're crying meaning nothing
[1:10:35] but god was going to come and personally
[1:10:38] let him know
[1:10:40] he was going to send
[1:10:42] his word
[1:10:44] by a prophet
[1:10:46] and that word was going to address the
[1:10:49] present conditions and was going to call
[1:10:52] them out of from under that oppression
[1:10:57] oh i wish i could really preach here
[1:11:00] i've seen the cry of the children of
[1:11:01] israel to come unto me and i have also
[1:11:04] seen the oppression where with the
[1:11:06] egyptians oppress them come now
[1:11:08] therefore and and i will send thee unto
[1:11:11] pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[1:11:14] people the children of israel out of
[1:11:17] egypt
[1:11:18] now when we think of this how god is
[1:11:21] going to deliver
[1:11:22] this
[1:11:23] this of his people from what is the
[1:11:25] mightiest nation
[1:11:27] on the earth
[1:11:28] there's not a mightier nation not a
[1:11:31] mightier army
[1:11:32] and god's sending a man down there
[1:11:35] this man doesn't have tanks behind him
[1:11:40] he doesn't have an armed militia behind
[1:11:42] him
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:43] he's one man
[1:11:45] and his family's with him
[1:11:49] he's in the minority as far as when it
[1:11:52] comes to individuals but he's actually
[1:11:54] in the majority
[1:11:56] [Applause]
[1:11:57] because god is with him
[1:12:01] amen
[1:12:03] now when they come into this god is
[1:12:05] letting them know
[1:12:06] i'm going to come down i've come down
[1:12:08] but i'm going in the form of a man
[1:12:10] in verse 8 you know how when moses is
[1:12:13] talking with god and i want to get to
[1:12:15] this place of the voice
[1:12:17] and how god would speak to moses and it
[1:12:21] says it shall come to pass if they will
[1:12:23] not believe thee neither hearken to the
[1:12:26] voice of the first sign that they will
[1:12:28] believe the voice of the latter sign
[1:12:31] it shall come to pass if they will not
[1:12:33] believe also these two signs neither
[1:12:36] hearken unto thy voice then thou shalt
[1:12:38] take of the water of the river and pour
[1:12:40] it upon the dry land now remember the
[1:12:43] generation that receives the word is
[1:12:45] blessed
[1:12:47] but those who reject it judgment is
[1:12:50] poured out
[1:12:52] this is what was taking place right here
[1:12:54] that if they refuse the first two signs
[1:12:57] then in this last one i want you to pour
[1:12:59] blood out they will take water of the
[1:13:01] now pour it out it will become blood
[1:13:03] that was a judgment sign
[1:13:06] and the water which shall take us out of
[1:13:07] the river shall become blood upon the
[1:13:10] dry land now as we said the voice of god
[1:13:12] is contrary to the voice of man
[1:13:15] this is why god would say in isaiah 55
[1:13:17] my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:13:22] my ways are not your ways
[1:13:24] but they're higher yes amen
[1:13:27] you see
[1:13:28] in this time of the exodus that was
[1:13:30] going on we recognize that what is going
[1:13:33] to happen here
[1:13:35] down in egypt
[1:13:36] is actually going to be a conflict a war
[1:13:40] that's going to be fought
[1:13:42] there's going to be the voice of god
[1:13:44] that's going to come against the voice
[1:13:46] of reasoning
[1:13:47] are you with me now
[1:13:49] the voice of reasoning has caused one to
[1:13:52] rise up who knew not joseph you see he
[1:13:56] did not know the blessings of joseph is
[1:13:58] that right
[1:13:59] and so because of that then we recognize
[1:14:02] that the voice of reasoning would rise
[1:14:04] up you see when we read in the
[1:14:06] scriptures you and i read it and we see
[1:14:08] how that you know pharaoh made an edict
[1:14:11] and his edict was to take the children
[1:14:14] and t and every man child that's born
[1:14:16] that day of the israelites they were to
[1:14:19] take that child and they were to uh
[1:14:21] instructed the midwives they want to
[1:14:22] take it and you know to throw it in
[1:14:24] there to the crocodiles and you
[1:14:26] recognize that the whole the whole
[1:14:28] objective was is that satan himself
[1:14:31] their spiritual powers that are at work
[1:14:34] let me just say this brother and sister
[1:14:35] you and i
[1:14:36] i believe that god by the grace of god
[1:14:39] with the holy spirit he
[1:14:40] gives to you and i eyes that go beyond
[1:14:43] what we're seeing and hearing here i
[1:14:45] want you to understand that what has
[1:14:47] been going on what is going on it is
[1:14:50] demonic battles in another realm
[1:14:53] there are demons and and fighting but
[1:14:55] yet at the same time while all hell is
[1:14:58] right here and it's able to manifest
[1:15:00] through people's lives then at the same
[1:15:03] time all heaven is right here as well
[1:15:07] god is here and he's manifesting himself
[1:15:10] in and through the lives of the
[1:15:12] believers it
[1:15:14] matters what your eyes are set to as to
[1:15:17] how you'll be affected if your eyes get
[1:15:19] on the natural earthly carnal things you
[1:15:23] can be affected but if your eyes are
[1:15:25] focused upon the promise and your eyes
[1:15:28] are focused on the living god then there
[1:15:31] is a strength that stabilizes you in
[1:15:33] this hour because you know this is not
[1:15:37] my home this is not my destination i'm
[1:15:40] just a pilgrim and a stranger i'm
[1:15:43] passing through
[1:15:45] i've already got my passport with the
[1:15:47] visa the token i've already got it and
[1:15:50] i'm ready to make my departure
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:59] they were taking the children and
[1:16:00] killing them
[1:16:03] brother we'll pick this up and third
[1:16:05] exodus he said that's exactly when he
[1:16:07] talks about the spiritual powers at work
[1:16:09] he said this is exactly he said what the
[1:16:12] enemy has done when he came in i talked
[1:16:14] about that previous election with john f
[1:16:15] kennedy and how that he came in and he
[1:16:17] ties this in what's happening down in
[1:16:19] egypt to that of the image that that
[1:16:22] nebuchadnezzar that daniel saw where you
[1:16:24] find that the iron and the clay
[1:16:26] intermingling the intermarrying you know
[1:16:28] getting a catholic boy and a protestant
[1:16:30] girl and all these things and trying to
[1:16:32] break down through intermarrying and all
[1:16:34] that part you know what it all comes
[1:16:35] down to of hybriding that satan himself
[1:16:39] he has he he is not able to stand
[1:16:42] against the revealed word of the hour
[1:16:44] satan is not able to stand against that
[1:16:47] word but what he can stand against is if
[1:16:50] there is a seed that is hybrid in there
[1:16:53] which would actually be the voice of
[1:16:55] reasoning then that itself it comes from
[1:16:58] man and that is powerless before satan
[1:17:00] but when god's voice comes on the scene
[1:17:03] oh my brother satan cannot stand before
[1:17:07] god's voice
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:10] you see it was a conflict going on it
[1:17:12] was the voice of god coming by the way
[1:17:14] of his word by promise and it was going
[1:17:16] to challenge the voice of reasoning
[1:17:19] the voice of reasoning had put many of
[1:17:21] them in spiritual depth and threw many
[1:17:23] of them in that bed i threw many of them
[1:17:25] in that nile river but there was a word
[1:17:28] now listen to me now just as the voice
[1:17:30] of reasoning it tries to come and
[1:17:33] suppress the reality of who the real
[1:17:35] children of god is but when god's voice
[1:17:38] begins to sweep by his dynamic power
[1:17:41] there is life and see on the inside
[1:17:44] brother it causes that life to rise
[1:17:47] above reasoning why it is the same wind
[1:17:51] of the holy ghost it moves down and it
[1:17:54] takes that heart that is so pressed and
[1:17:57] cast down and looking down but it begins
[1:18:00] to lift that heart into a place to say
[1:18:03] this is who i really am i know i never
[1:18:05] was this this is who i really am what's
[1:18:08] doing that the resting mighty wind of
[1:18:10] the voice of god coming by his promise
[1:18:15] so god's voice is very important
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:20] brother brown would say like this if the
[1:18:22] voice comes
[1:18:23] the same old voice
[1:18:25] you see a sign
[1:18:26] and the sign that the man is doing is
[1:18:28] the same old school of thought
[1:18:30] then you can say right there
[1:18:32] that didn't come from god
[1:18:34] notice not saying that oh my goodness
[1:18:37] what a sign no
[1:18:39] the school old school of thought
[1:18:41] they might have a sign
[1:18:43] maybe sick is healed
[1:18:45] but
[1:18:46] if it's not the voice coming by way of
[1:18:49] the word
[1:18:50] it's not of god
[1:18:52] brother brown would say in many other
[1:18:54] places as well but we can see that in
[1:18:56] the scripture you see god god gives to
[1:18:58] you and i the discernment and where that
[1:18:59] you and i can stand in this hour if it
[1:19:01] keeps identifying the same old school of
[1:19:03] thought it never did it never has it
[1:19:05] would be against god's program it's got
[1:19:07] to be something new
[1:19:09] it's got to be something that the people
[1:19:12] don't understand see it cannot be
[1:19:15] confined to the reasonings of man
[1:19:18] god's voice our understanding of the
[1:19:20] word is not because we are good readers
[1:19:25] truth be known most of you even that are
[1:19:26] good readers even if you're advanced and
[1:19:28] you read you know this particular level
[1:19:30] you realize most of the reading that we
[1:19:31] do is sixth grade level reading
[1:19:33] newspapers on and on and on and on and
[1:19:35] on and on and on
[1:19:36] okay and well we won't go there but
[1:19:38] anyhow the the the things that you
[1:19:40] recognize that that with that it's going
[1:19:42] to take more it's more than just reading
[1:19:45] we don't need reading
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:50] even though the bible would say in the
[1:19:52] in revelations chapter 1 blessed is he
[1:19:55] that readeth and heareth the words of
[1:19:57] this book but it's not based on just you
[1:19:59] and i reading from our own understanding
[1:20:02] or hearing from our own understanding
[1:20:04] but our inspiration we are under
[1:20:07] inspiration of god we're not reading by
[1:20:10] our own thoughts or our own thinking but
[1:20:13] we're reading by coming under the
[1:20:15] inspiration of almighty god so that way
[1:20:19] when we look at the bible itself it's
[1:20:21] not just well this is the bible but now
[1:20:24] when we open the bible it's not just a
[1:20:27] letter but it has become light to you
[1:20:29] and i and the word is open the voice of
[1:20:32] god is speaking out of there and we see
[1:20:35] him to be the same yesterday today or
[1:20:37] forever you see any true word of god
[1:20:40] doesn't need another book to back it up
[1:20:43] it don't need to add another book to the
[1:20:45] bible but what god has sent he comes to
[1:20:48] make alive and a real what he's promised
[1:20:51] in his word
[1:20:55] hallelujah
[1:20:57] so notice
[1:20:58] it don't need to be sin if it's the same
[1:21:00] old school of theology
[1:21:02] yet it's it's got to be identified in
[1:21:03] the word
[1:21:04] that it's for that day you see he said
[1:21:06] the positives of god's word there's no
[1:21:08] slip ups to it it's got to be the truth
[1:21:10] got to be vindicated by god the truth
[1:21:12] and the man who speaks it has to be
[1:21:14] vindicated of god to be a seer from god
[1:21:17] or it's wrong
[1:21:21] it goes on he says now the signs are
[1:21:23] from god everybody all right
[1:21:27] the voice that follows the sign
[1:21:29] must be the voice of god speaking from
[1:21:31] the word
[1:21:32] for that age
[1:21:35] the simple the simple things that
[1:21:36] brother branham would take us back to
[1:21:40] there was a deliverance that was needed
[1:21:42] from egypt
[1:21:44] even though moses knew
[1:21:47] how god had visited noah
[1:21:51] but it had to be the message
[1:21:53] of christ for that generation
[1:21:57] it couldn't just take the form of
[1:22:00] building an ark again that was not what
[1:22:02] the inspiration of christ had revealed
[1:22:05] in that hour
[1:22:07] it had to be the inspiration of christ
[1:22:10] in that hour that would reveal that in
[1:22:12] that ark was safety are you with me and
[1:22:15] then it would reveal in this time of the
[1:22:18] exodus that the real deliverance would
[1:22:20] come after the blood had been applied
[1:22:23] and that the firstborn were brought
[1:22:25] under the blood which is also the ark of
[1:22:28] god which is the place of safety which
[1:22:30] is his life
[1:22:32] so it's finding the inspiration of
[1:22:36] christ for that hour
[1:22:40] can you imagine what it would have
[1:22:41] looked like standing in egypt they could
[1:22:43] have had an ark they could have built
[1:22:44] the most elaborate ark in the world that
[1:22:46] was not god's plan for the day
[1:22:50] you understand it was the same
[1:22:52] characteristic same nature to be hidden
[1:22:55] in a place of safety
[1:22:57] under the blood the blood itself it
[1:23:00] became that place of safety that the
[1:23:02] deaf angel could come up to that door
[1:23:05] but when it saw the blood oh
[1:23:07] my
[1:23:08] the deaf angel didn't look inside there
[1:23:11] and see who was in there the death angel
[1:23:13] came and was strictly told that when i
[1:23:16] see the blood i'll pass over you let me
[1:23:19] just tell you something tonight you
[1:23:21] might be sitting in a safe and a
[1:23:23] situation you might say you don't know
[1:23:25] my life but i'm going to tell you
[1:23:26] tonight when a worshiper came to worship
[1:23:29] god the the high priest he never
[1:23:32] inspected the worshiper he inspected the
[1:23:36] sacrifice that he was bringing let me
[1:23:38] just tell you something the sacrifice
[1:23:41] this word that's coming forth right now
[1:23:44] it is jesus christ the passover lamb and
[1:23:48] if you can bring that layer and identify
[1:23:51] yourself he ain't inspecting you whether
[1:23:54] you're worthy you're saying i identify
[1:23:56] with this lamb
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:00] and god takes the lamb
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:06] and this time he takes you with him
[1:24:15] god give signs
[1:24:17] always give signs
[1:24:18] he told them that's what they look for
[1:24:20] in the signs
[1:24:21] god gives signs to attract the tension
[1:24:23] of his people now you might say brother
[1:24:25] samuel we don't need signs no more you
[1:24:26] speak for yourself
[1:24:30] all right
[1:24:31] i got a piece of my wife with me
[1:24:38] i love you honey but you know my
[1:24:40] weaknesses
[1:24:46] we need signs
[1:24:48] i said we need signs and wonders
[1:24:52] you see these are things
[1:24:54] this is where we have to walk by the
[1:24:56] balance of the holy ghost
[1:25:00] it's true the bible says that a wicked
[1:25:02] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:25:04] a sign but the prophet of god will pick
[1:25:06] up that scripture and says what it is
[1:25:08] these are people who are longing just
[1:25:10] for an emotion
[1:25:12] he said people can get emotional at the
[1:25:14] sunset but that don't mean that you've
[1:25:16] received a resurrection sign
[1:25:18] so we need signs and wonders and brother
[1:25:20] branham would pray oh god every once in
[1:25:23] a while come among us and let us see
[1:25:26] lord god yourself that you're still the
[1:25:28] same yesterday today and forever
[1:25:33] that's a longing of believers
[1:25:36] brother graham stands in perfect faith
[1:25:38] and he says as believers we are longing
[1:25:40] to see
[1:25:41] real apostolic times again why because
[1:25:45] the word brings that reality it's an
[1:25:48] expectation because it's him in our
[1:25:51] midst
[1:25:53] he's the one who heals the sick he's the
[1:25:55] one that delivers the oppressed he's the
[1:25:57] one that feels with the holy ghost
[1:26:02] hallelujah he's the great one in our
[1:26:05] midst
[1:26:13] god give sign to attract the attention
[1:26:15] of the people
[1:26:16] he said let's study this signs are given
[1:26:19] to attract the attention of the people
[1:26:20] because
[1:26:22] listen to this when a god-sent sign is
[1:26:24] given
[1:26:26] god is getting ready to speak
[1:26:31] it'd be kind of foolish to start
[1:26:33] speaking and you don't got people's
[1:26:34] attention
[1:26:35] right you know how it is like in a
[1:26:37] wedding or birthday gathering and you
[1:26:39] want to do a certain event
[1:26:40] well everybody's there for the birthday
[1:26:42] or for the wedding or whatever
[1:26:44] right right
[1:26:46] but you just don't start
[1:26:47] somebody don't come up and just start
[1:26:48] saying
[1:26:49] well i want to just say how i appreciate
[1:26:51] the groom and the bride so much i really
[1:26:54] appreciate them
[1:26:56] you want to make sure what they're
[1:26:58] saying
[1:26:59] everybody hears
[1:27:02] right
[1:27:03] now you may have to have some big i mean
[1:27:05] you may have to have somebody who can
[1:27:06] come up and say everybody be quiet
[1:27:09] they might be louder than the pa but
[1:27:11] right or they can whistle and
[1:27:14] they get everybody's attention why
[1:27:18] because something's got to be said
[1:27:22] and what has to be said you need to hear
[1:27:24] it
[1:27:26] is that right
[1:27:28] it's just like when you know the buses
[1:27:29] they stop at those railroad tracks they
[1:27:31] open the doors everybody on the bus has
[1:27:33] got to get quiet
[1:27:36] right
[1:27:37] because you know why they're told don't
[1:27:39] just go by lights because sometimes them
[1:27:41] lights can fail
[1:27:42] but the sound of the train will never
[1:27:44] fail
[1:27:46] is that right
[1:27:47] so there's a reason when god gives a
[1:27:49] sign he's ready to speak
[1:27:52] oh my
[1:27:53] if it comes from heaven it's from god
[1:27:54] and god is ready to speak and he's
[1:27:56] trying to attract the people's attention
[1:27:58] and the word comes to his prophet and
[1:28:00] the prophet is identified by the sign
[1:28:02] that he shows and then he comes to the
[1:28:04] word comes to the word and the word is
[1:28:06] made manifest that settles they don't
[1:28:08] need any interpretation god's already
[1:28:10] interpreted just as perfect as it can be
[1:28:12] god gives a sign to attract the
[1:28:14] attention of the people now
[1:28:16] when we look at this with with with
[1:28:18] israel remember when israel came out
[1:28:20] they were under a natural lamb
[1:28:22] a natural blood is that right it was a
[1:28:24] type
[1:28:25] of the lamb of
[1:28:27] the lamb uh the blood of the lamb
[1:28:30] speaking of the lord jesus under that
[1:28:32] natural lamb they could come out and
[1:28:34] murmur and complain
[1:28:35] but once a heart gets under that lamb
[1:28:39] the the blood of the lamb of god once
[1:28:41] that heart comes under there oh it ain't
[1:28:43] saying that there ain't times that ain't
[1:28:45] hard but there's there is a delight
[1:28:47] within us that you know what we found
[1:28:49] the joy of our life that he is our life
[1:28:52] and and we don't understand every way
[1:28:54] that he'll lead us in the tests and
[1:28:56] trials and as they come but we know one
[1:28:58] thing that he is mine and i am his yes
[1:29:03] but all these signs and wonders even the
[1:29:05] opening of the red sea
[1:29:09] think how david david would say this
[1:29:11] david would say it i think also in
[1:29:13] another part of the psalms but he would
[1:29:14] say our fathers understood not the
[1:29:17] miracles
[1:29:18] they they did not become wise by them
[1:29:21] this is what it means to understand they
[1:29:22] did not become wise remember what the
[1:29:24] wise is the wise is the type of those
[1:29:26] who have their vessels filled with oil
[1:29:29] who have understanding the bible in the
[1:29:31] book of proverbs says the wise is able
[1:29:33] to take correction
[1:29:34] and grow from that correction
[1:29:36] they were not able
[1:29:38] they were not able to understand the
[1:29:40] miracles that it what god was doing god
[1:29:43] was letting known to them his love his
[1:29:45] care of his promise it was grace that
[1:29:48] god had provided to them a prophet with
[1:29:51] a pillar of fire and this word to lead
[1:29:54] them all the way through think about it
[1:29:55] these are individuals that walk upon dry
[1:29:58] ground they saw the red sea open they
[1:30:01] ate a manner that came down there were
[1:30:03] quails that came down in the camp they
[1:30:05] drank from that water in the rock
[1:30:07] brother it was supernatural all around
[1:30:10] them but they never itself accepted to
[1:30:14] recognize that that supernatural god was
[1:30:17] identifying himself according to the
[1:30:20] promise to build their faith in the
[1:30:23] promise that they were a part of it
[1:30:26] they seen it they heard it
[1:30:28] but it was never mixed with faith
[1:30:32] let me just tell you what god is doing
[1:30:33] when god speaks to your heart
[1:30:35] listen it's time to understand that it's
[1:30:38] god speaking to my heart
[1:30:40] don't try to reason and out like well he
[1:30:42] might have been you know he might have
[1:30:43] been sad even if i wasn't here if you've
[1:30:45] been streaming and you got a need god
[1:30:47] will find it right to your doorstep
[1:30:49] god knows your address he knows what you
[1:30:52] got need of it's not a chance that even
[1:30:54] you're here any of us tonight it's not a
[1:30:57] chance that i'm preaching what i'm
[1:30:58] preaching tonight it is ordained of
[1:31:01] almighty god and god knows exactly what
[1:31:03] we have need of he comes to meet the
[1:31:06] conditions of the hour
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:14] now think of this
[1:31:18] let me just have just a few more moments
[1:31:20] is that okay
[1:31:22] i want to try to get us to a certain
[1:31:23] place here tonight
[1:31:27] if they had understood by divine
[1:31:28] revelation
[1:31:30] it would they they would have walked
[1:31:33] like caleb and joshua walked
[1:31:37] opposition opposition was there
[1:31:40] the devil is always there to oppose
[1:31:42] promises being taken
[1:31:45] to show you as far as when it comes to
[1:31:47] the natural man the impossibilities
[1:31:51] the odds are against us
[1:31:54] but when we can recognize god made the
[1:31:56] promise
[1:31:58] and i'm going to stand on that promise
[1:32:01] with the lord
[1:32:04] then it's up to god to bring that
[1:32:06] promise to pass
[1:32:08] faith says i don't know how he's going
[1:32:10] to do it
[1:32:11] but i know he's going to do it
[1:32:14] i know i belong to him and he cannot
[1:32:16] fail
[1:32:19] you see this is why
[1:32:21] are you with me now
[1:32:23] this is why it's got to be more
[1:32:25] than just moses was a mighty man of god
[1:32:28] right
[1:32:29] are you hearing me
[1:32:30] it's got to be more than just myself and
[1:32:33] moses oh he's a mighty man of god this
[1:32:34] has got to be a personal revelation that
[1:32:37] this is the man that has met god face to
[1:32:39] face and god has come down to deliver
[1:32:42] the message that he that is going to
[1:32:45] under unfold to me my inheritance it's
[1:32:48] going to take me from egypt it's going
[1:32:50] to take me into my position
[1:32:52] you see that's a that's got to be a
[1:32:54] revelation if it's just man moses is a
[1:32:57] mighty man of god there'll be a balaam
[1:32:59] come along
[1:33:01] come on now there'll be another one with
[1:33:02] signs and wonders and whatever more but
[1:33:04] let me just tell you something balaam
[1:33:06] wasn't even close to moses
[1:33:09] i'm just going to say it hands down
[1:33:10] there ain't been another ministry on
[1:33:11] this earth that present close to william
[1:33:13] branham's ministry
[1:33:16] i say that unabashedly i say it
[1:33:18] unashamedly because it's absolutely the
[1:33:21] truth there ain't never nearly one of
[1:33:24] them as a matter of fact you found every
[1:33:26] one of them pl osborne and the rest of
[1:33:29] them that was right there they
[1:33:30] themselves were appalled and and looked
[1:33:33] at how that god would use that man and
[1:33:36] think of how t.l osborne would say it he
[1:33:38] said we had forgot how jesus christ was
[1:33:41] so god in this generation came down and
[1:33:44] made it known to you and i that he's
[1:33:46] still the same and this is how he really
[1:33:49] is god took the flesh of william branham
[1:33:52] and veiled himself to this world but to
[1:33:55] you and i that have eyes to see
[1:33:58] it takes us beyond that veil we can see
[1:34:01] it's the living god and to understand it
[1:34:05] that what god demonstrated there
[1:34:08] it's the same god working in power
[1:34:10] bringing his word to pass in our life
[1:34:16] oh i feel like preaching or dancing or
[1:34:18] something
[1:34:19] praise god
[1:34:24] someone out of breath i might run a
[1:34:25] little bit
[1:34:30] see they would have come under that word
[1:34:31] now just let me let me i'm trying to
[1:34:33] hone this down
[1:34:35] bill brown would say it like this when
[1:34:36] if god puts his word
[1:34:38] in a person
[1:34:40] well it's not that person anymore it's
[1:34:42] him
[1:34:43] if the man is saying it in himself it
[1:34:45] won't amount to anything
[1:34:48] but if he but if the word of the lord is
[1:34:51] in the man it'll come forth
[1:34:53] it'll be just exactly right
[1:34:56] he refers us to deuteronomy where we
[1:34:59] read where we read from let me skip on
[1:35:01] down to the next paragraph paragraph 19.
[1:35:03] that's how god has he's talking about
[1:35:04] god's program he's got his regular
[1:35:06] program laid out here in the bible we
[1:35:08] know how to read that out but there are
[1:35:11] certain things listen now there's
[1:35:13] certain things that to the church and to
[1:35:16] the time and things that he hasn't got
[1:35:18] written here in the bible
[1:35:20] example the things that
[1:35:22] some of that
[1:35:23] just even sharing with you even here
[1:35:25] tonight how that the spirit of god would
[1:35:27] tie together what's going on
[1:35:30] down there in egypt where there was
[1:35:31] spiritual death happening to the
[1:35:33] children
[1:35:34] it would tie it into that of revelations
[1:35:37] 2 well i will cast her children into a
[1:35:38] bed of death
[1:35:39] into that of tribulation it was tying it
[1:35:42] in to that of daniel of that image down
[1:35:44] there in the feet you see these are
[1:35:46] things listen that are laying all in the
[1:35:48] scripture but it takes a divine
[1:35:50] inspiration a word from god to be able
[1:35:53] to tie those promises together not to
[1:35:55] and many other people they just look at
[1:35:57] it and say wow that's something but you
[1:35:59] see it's something different when the
[1:36:01] inspiration of god who inspired daniel
[1:36:04] who inspired the different ones that
[1:36:06] were down there when moses wrote exodus
[1:36:08] it's something different when the
[1:36:10] inspiration of god comes upon that word
[1:36:12] and reveals to you who you are it
[1:36:15] reveals to you a time it reveals to you
[1:36:17] what's going on it isn't something to
[1:36:19] you and i just walk away from and say
[1:36:21] wow that's something but it's god he has
[1:36:24] checkpoints that are laid out in his
[1:36:26] word that lets you and i know that
[1:36:28] though that is a historical event that
[1:36:30] was prophecy that is prophesied of this
[1:36:34] hour of this exodus of this time
[1:36:38] there are things that are written not
[1:36:40] written in the word such as abraham and
[1:36:43] sarah having a body change that's not
[1:36:45] wrong in the word
[1:36:48] but yet abimelech
[1:36:49] he wasn't
[1:36:50] had an old grandma
[1:36:52] don't mean defend grandma's tonight but
[1:36:54] he wants
[1:36:55] grandma
[1:36:59] you know
[1:37:00] he's like i heard brother ron spencer
[1:37:01] say one time he's here with a bamboo
[1:37:03] coming up we're here with sarah coming
[1:37:05] up on a cane in alabama look lusted
[1:37:07] after her
[1:37:08] no
[1:37:09] not an old grandma
[1:37:12] you're with me
[1:37:16] it's not wrote in the world
[1:37:20] but inspiration comes to to pick that
[1:37:23] out of the word
[1:37:26] things that are wrong in there and not
[1:37:28] only that but also things that are
[1:37:31] announcing things to come that were even
[1:37:34] telling the people the organizations at
[1:37:36] that time if you go in this way of
[1:37:39] organization death awaits you your
[1:37:42] members will die the pentecostal church
[1:37:45] will die you see god was already making
[1:37:48] it known ahead of time it was not rope
[1:37:51] per se in the word but the inspiration
[1:37:54] that is tied to the promise of the word
[1:37:56] and this hour the word brings a vision
[1:37:59] and a sight
[1:38:08] i don't mean to stop and say is that
[1:38:10] clear but
[1:38:13] i know it takes him to make it clear but
[1:38:16] so there's certain things that to the
[1:38:17] church and to the time things that he
[1:38:19] hasn't gotten written in the bible so he
[1:38:21] puts listen to this so
[1:38:24] he puts his voice into a person
[1:38:27] and they speak it forward
[1:38:30] speak it for
[1:38:32] then the way to judge that person is
[1:38:33] find out whether it happens what they
[1:38:35] say if it does then keeps it keeps
[1:38:37] happening that way well then you know
[1:38:38] that comes from god
[1:38:40] and then we have the confidence to make
[1:38:41] ready for the things that's coming amen
[1:38:45] i say amen to that tonight
[1:38:48] we see the things that's unfolding
[1:38:50] that's why i said
[1:38:51] even here on sunday i think back to it i
[1:38:53] think
[1:38:54] when we look at things listen friends
[1:38:58] you go back
[1:38:59] and you listen to the message
[1:39:02] these things that's happening and while
[1:39:04] we see the condition of the world
[1:39:07] it should not be let me just how do i
[1:39:09] say this
[1:39:10] things sometimes the way you see things
[1:39:12] taking place are happening
[1:39:14] it's almost jaw-dropping
[1:39:17] like how in the world
[1:39:20] but yet
[1:39:22] god has detailed it yes
[1:39:26] you listen in the message the third exit
[1:39:27] brother brown deals with the spirits
[1:39:29] that are at work trying to bring
[1:39:31] distraction
[1:39:32] before that exodus
[1:39:34] the racial tensions and everything like
[1:39:35] that he's dealing with all that
[1:39:38] the spirit of god says government can
[1:39:40] never turn it around what government has
[1:39:42] pushed in
[1:39:43] he said it takes the baptism of the holy
[1:39:47] ghost
[1:39:48] amen that's the answer it's what we've
[1:39:49] been proclaiming that's the real answer
[1:39:51] is the holy ghost
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:55] you see all that the enemy wants to do
[1:39:57] it stokes its spirits that are being
[1:39:59] stolen but the real spirit of god brings
[1:40:01] divine love
[1:40:04] you see all those things and everything
[1:40:05] that is taking place we recognize that's
[1:40:08] all distractions
[1:40:11] so i say in love don't be distracted
[1:40:15] on any
[1:40:17] front
[1:40:18] you understand
[1:40:20] don't be over here on this or don't be
[1:40:21] over here on this
[1:40:23] stand with him who says i stand in the
[1:40:25] midst
[1:40:27] are you with me
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:32] oh man
[1:40:35] i know i lose some of you on that
[1:40:37] sometimes but i pray god will help you
[1:40:41] yeah isaiah 8 20.
[1:40:47] i want you to see this here god lets it
[1:40:50] be known in isaiah 8 20.
[1:40:53] if they speak not according
[1:40:55] to this word
[1:40:57] it's because there's no light in them
[1:41:01] what does light come to do
[1:41:03] what why do you have life
[1:41:06] i mean
[1:41:08] you got to be able to see
[1:41:10] right
[1:41:11] now you might say
[1:41:13] i can get around my house at night
[1:41:15] let me come in and move your furniture
[1:41:17] around
[1:41:20] and then you'll wake the whole house up
[1:41:21] stubbing your toe
[1:41:24] you know why
[1:41:26] because
[1:41:27] you're presuming
[1:41:29] has finally caught up somebody moved
[1:41:32] things around
[1:41:34] and you're just presuming okay
[1:41:36] arm length away from this wall
[1:41:38] yeah past that chair that desk chair
[1:41:42] but you let somebody put the desk chair
[1:41:43] out here and you got oh yeah armament
[1:41:45] that's the way it always is boom all
[1:41:47] right
[1:41:49] what does light do
[1:41:51] light takes things
[1:41:54] that are mysterious
[1:41:56] and just uncovers the
[1:41:59] darkness can be spooky
[1:42:02] darkness can cause worry it can cause
[1:42:04] fear
[1:42:06] but when light comes it drives back any
[1:42:09] darkness
[1:42:11] it drives back
[1:42:12] shadows
[1:42:14] see this is why when darkness is the
[1:42:16] long as the enemy can try to keep
[1:42:18] darkness upon the promise
[1:42:20] it can bring fear that's right but when
[1:42:22] he comes and makes himself known by way
[1:42:25] of the promise and you begin to look in
[1:42:27] and you begin to see light and say
[1:42:29] that's me
[1:42:31] that's for me you know what's happening
[1:42:33] darkness is fleeing away amen and as you
[1:42:37] begin to see yourself darkness is
[1:42:39] fleeing away
[1:42:40] shadows are being pressed back why light
[1:42:43] is more powerful in the darkness
[1:42:47] we could we could we could darken this
[1:42:49] whole building and you give me a match
[1:42:53] plan a little match i know i like that
[1:42:55] match up guess what it'll light it up in
[1:42:57] here a little bit
[1:42:58] i mean it ain't going to light it up
[1:43:00] like
[1:43:02] but it is light
[1:43:04] it don't matter how small that light is
[1:43:06] it's greater than the darkness
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:16] that's why brother branham would put it
[1:43:18] just like this in the message messiah
[1:43:21] god himself moves into your life as you
[1:43:23] surrender your life to god he said it's
[1:43:26] like a little white button
[1:43:28] and the more that you can let him have
[1:43:30] the right away push out envy
[1:43:33] bitterness strife you say how do i push
[1:43:35] it out when he comes and deals with it
[1:43:37] because your heart is saying lord
[1:43:39] i want to be full of you
[1:43:42] i i want to be in you lord i want my
[1:43:44] life completely i don't want in one area
[1:43:46] of my life outside of you and as you're
[1:43:48] doing that now notice what it's doing
[1:43:50] it's inviting him to come and make
[1:43:52] himself more real to you and though it
[1:43:55] started out as a little button of light
[1:43:57] the more as he would deal with your life
[1:43:59] and you say yes lord the more that
[1:44:01] little black button it's growing within
[1:44:03] you you know what that is because
[1:44:04] obedience to the word it allows the
[1:44:06] light of the word to grow in power and
[1:44:08] strengthen your life until eventually
[1:44:11] the things that as you begin to witness
[1:44:13] and see things that you thought that
[1:44:15] were impossible but it now is becoming
[1:44:18] possible to you because the living god
[1:44:21] is coming in and performing his word
[1:44:23] through your life he's building faith on
[1:44:26] top of faith on top of faith if thou in
[1:44:29] thy heart can say unto this mountain be
[1:44:32] thou removed
[1:44:34] plucked out and cast into the undersea
[1:44:37] and don't doubt in your heart it shall
[1:44:39] be even as you have said
[1:44:44] that light grows
[1:44:46] you know when it grows it just kind of
[1:44:47] pushes things out
[1:44:50] it'd be like if i put like 10 of brother
[1:44:52] williams on this pew with brother brian
[1:44:54] and sister barb and brother brother
[1:44:57] tender brother william kept on coming
[1:44:58] one two three four eventually
[1:45:03] these two might get pushed out
[1:45:06] i know it's a real simple example that's
[1:45:08] the same way the word coming in your
[1:45:10] life
[1:45:11] as you're taking in the word you become
[1:45:13] the word
[1:45:15] it's pushing out darkness it pushes out
[1:45:18] desires it pushes out holes
[1:45:21] [Applause]
[1:45:28] it's the power of this life
[1:45:30] [Applause]
[1:45:36] oh my let's just
[1:45:38] let's just stop here
[1:45:46] hallelujah
[1:45:48] let's just bow our heads
[1:45:51] lord jesus
[1:45:56] you're so faithful lord
[1:45:59] oh god you come to minister courage
[1:46:03] love
[1:46:04] and ability
[1:46:06] lord your light
[1:46:08] as you come by your word
[1:46:12] lord it's you that
[1:46:15] gives strength
[1:46:17] to the believer
[1:46:20] lord it's you that pushes back darkness
[1:46:23] it's you that comes lord
[1:46:27] and you give strength
[1:46:29] that thoughts that would arise
[1:46:32] that would speak contrary to what the
[1:46:34] word is saying about us
[1:46:37] you come
[1:46:38] and that word gives us strength
[1:46:40] to cast that down
[1:46:43] father
[1:46:44] you know the needs here tonight
[1:46:49] lord jesus
[1:46:51] we've looked at it here a little
[1:46:52] bit a little broke up way
[1:46:55] of how that the word of the lord
[1:46:57] will come to the prophet
[1:47:00] this is what we realize lord that
[1:47:04] we're men in this hour
[1:47:06] many were and still there's contentious
[1:47:09] debates about
[1:47:10] do we need the greek or every right word
[1:47:12] or this or that
[1:47:14] that god you would you would come by
[1:47:16] your presence
[1:47:19] and you would send
[1:47:21] your profit in this hour
[1:47:25] and it would speak to our hearts to let
[1:47:26] us know
[1:47:27] we don't have to be great learned people
[1:47:31] that's not what it is
[1:47:33] we don't have to know all the greek
[1:47:35] don't have to know all the hebrew
[1:47:37] don't have to know all the vernacular
[1:47:40] as a matter of fact lord
[1:47:42] you would express yourself
[1:47:44] and you would tell us
[1:47:46] through the prophet of god
[1:47:48] that it's going to take more than just a
[1:47:50] student comparing
[1:47:52] bible verse
[1:47:54] to bible verse to make the book real
[1:47:57] it'll take
[1:47:59] a work
[1:48:00] or the word that's used an operation of
[1:48:04] the holy ghost
[1:48:06] it will take you to come upon this word
[1:48:11] lord god that this word would become
[1:48:13] alive to us
[1:48:18] lord jesus
[1:48:21] i believe god that's the desire
[1:48:24] that's what you call each and every one
[1:48:26] of us
[1:48:27] as your children
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] then lord
[1:48:32] that the word of the lord
[1:48:34] that inspiration
[1:48:36] it would come to our hearts
[1:48:38] it would come lord
[1:48:40] to bring conviction
[1:48:42] it comes to lead us
[1:48:44] in the path of life
[1:48:46] it comes to bring us back home
[1:48:49] we could read the bible and read the
[1:48:51] bible
[1:48:52] and still never make it back home
[1:48:55] but you come
[1:48:58] the author of the word
[1:49:00] and you come and you make that word
[1:49:02] alive and real
[1:49:05] it's not even anything that we can
[1:49:07] explain we can't even understand it
[1:49:10] of how
[1:49:11] you're working
[1:49:12] but in lord it just takes hold of us
[1:49:15] sure as we walk on with you
[1:49:17] we begin to understand more and more
[1:49:20] our faith would grow but lord we find
[1:49:23] this we walk on with you
[1:49:25] we recognize
[1:49:26] more and more the simplicity
[1:49:30] that we are your work
[1:49:32] it's you working in us
[1:49:34] it's you working through us
[1:49:37] and it must be you lord god
[1:49:39] performing your word in our life in
[1:49:42] other words lord
[1:49:44] it doesn't make us dependent upon our
[1:49:46] reasoning
[1:49:47] it makes us dependent more and more upon
[1:49:49] you
[1:49:53] lord jesus
[1:49:55] i pray tonight
[1:49:58] that as you've spoke to our hearts
[1:50:01] you know every need that's gathered here
[1:50:04] i just asked the lord
[1:50:06] that you administer to those hearts the
[1:50:08] requests that they have for you
[1:50:10] may you come lord may they be honest
[1:50:12] before you
[1:50:13] may you come lord
[1:50:15] and just may they take that request
[1:50:17] before you
[1:50:18] may they not come before you as a pauper
[1:50:21] or a beggar but may they recognize lord
[1:50:24] jesus that what you have
[1:50:26] made known to them what you are speaking
[1:50:28] to them
[1:50:32] lord you're calling them
[1:50:34] as sons and daughters of
[1:50:36] god if there's any lord that's bound
[1:50:39] with sin tonight
[1:50:41] lord god under the authority of the word
[1:50:43] of god and the holy spirit
[1:50:45] to that heart lord that maybe doesn't
[1:50:47] have the strength to walk free
[1:50:50] but tonight lord god from their heart
[1:50:52] their desire is i want to be free
[1:50:55] then lord god
[1:50:57] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:50:59] lord i speak to that unclean spirit
[1:51:02] the lord god would seek to hold that
[1:51:04] life in oppression
[1:51:06] satan in the name of jesus christ you're
[1:51:08] defeated
[1:51:09] and you know you're defeated and you
[1:51:11] lost the victory
[1:51:13] our lord jesus christ is right here
[1:51:15] among us
[1:51:16] and in the name of jesus christ take
[1:51:18] your hands off

[1:51:33] hearts
[1:51:35] realizing

[1:51:56] becomes settled that i'm healed

[1:52:07] them lord
[1:52:11] satan coming and trying to trouble
[1:52:13] about results that can come lord jesus

[1:52:23] report
[1:52:25] that we have received the life of the
[1:52:28] one who manifested that report from the
[1:52:31] arm of the lord
[1:52:33] i pray dear god
[1:52:36] may they take that rest from the voice
[1:52:38] of god may it be that voice that would
[1:52:40] so lord speak into their heart tonight
