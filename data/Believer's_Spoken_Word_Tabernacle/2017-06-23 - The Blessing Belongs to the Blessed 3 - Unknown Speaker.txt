and we thank you Father the name of Jesus Christ's name and you love him tonight hallelujah it's so good to be here of course we could come to this building but what makes it really good to be here is to be in his presence amen and to know that we're coming before the throne of the Living God we have an expectation in our hearts don't we amen let's turn in our Bibles to Romans chapter 9 we want to just read a few verses of Scripture and then we'll let you have your seats in verse 1 of Romans 9 all said I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my form where I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are Israelites to whom pertain it the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God bless forever amen may the Lord bless as you're being seated and we'll just continue to read in verse 6 there Paul goes on not as though the Word of God have taken none effect but they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but an Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed but this is the word of promise at this time I will come and Sara shall have a son and not only this but when Rebekah also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated we want to continue look at that fall here tonight the blessing belongs to the Blessed and we want to just look at this in the unfolding and the opening of the scripture but I would like to started looking at the scripture in means of this that we know that God deals with every generation God deals with every heart God's not obligated to give one person more than one opportunity he's only obligated to give one opportunity so God will move through and by his word to give direction give leadership to his children that are within the time and the day that we are living a lot of times it would seem like when we are looking at things that it would seem as though that we have forever what we don't as a matter of fact it's very imperative for our lives that we move when God is moving David when he had let it be known of the Lord that God let him know when he should go out to battle and that's when he would hear the rustle and the mulberry leaves we know that that rustling was not a natural wind but that was the angels of God that were going before David so David would know it was a sound that would come through and move the natural leaves in the branches but it was not a sound that was emanated from natural means it was a sound that was emanated from the angels of God and how that they were moving to go before him it's very important that we move when God is desiring for us to move you think about it that was here within the scriptures that we're looking at it and God is making known that of election of this between Jacob and Esau so let's just break in here tonight upon this knowing many of the things that we can look at and we can read by way of Scripture even and where we're reading in Romans nine we know somewhat by the outcome but yet we know everything that God has laid out in Scripture is not a past happening but it is prophetic that continues to repeat itself all the way down through time even that of what took place even in the garden with Abel and Cain it continues to repeat itself all the way down to the very consummating of time when we look here in the scriptures we break in on a place in verse 19 of Genesis 25 and it says these are the generations of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebekah to wife the daughter of the fuel does say the Sirian of panorama the sister of Laban the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren and the Lord was entreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elders shall serve the younger and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb now when we look at this in the scripture it doesn't take much to understand that there's probably we could agree that among us here tonight there is no one else that'll be my twin there's no one else in this building here that you would be setting and say that could be your twin so a twin is not somebody who just merely would resemble or half well you know the kind of got eyes like brother Samuel maybe knows but there must be such a place to where the scripture would identify that it's twins it must have very similar features very similar characteristics very all of these things that would be to the place to where you could look and say these are twins but yet all the way on the outside it could be it would be twins but see what God looks at is down below because God God sees is what part is that corresponding part that is actually truly of him in the election so here when we're looking at this in the scripture how that Rebekah has asked of the Lord why is this struggle going on within me why is this struggle taking place and how that God makes known to Rebekah he makes known to her personally that what is taking place there are actually two manners of people there are actually two nations that are within the womb that it will be separated from that vows verse verse 25 goes on to say and the first came out read all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's hill and his name was called Jacob and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare him or bare them sorry and the boys grew and he saw was a cunning hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents I want you to watch this verse here and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebekah loved Jacob my lord Isaac loved Esau but Rebekah loved Jacob now you remember that within this Rebekah has spiritual insight to what has been taking place within her wounds she's actually had it spoken directly to her by the Lord it's not something that Rebekah is going to wonder when she's seeing a Esau this way and Jacob this way she's already heard in the message of power transformation that in the last days it will be twins that will come forth from the same movement same church but will be different fathers are you with me so our twin is not something that's out there our twin is right around where we're at are you lift me now because when we're looking at this we come to begin to see that as Isaac himself loved Esau and I would dare I would definitely say that probably within each and every one of us when you look at how that Isaac could look upon Esau he saw himself how brother Ram will tell us many different times how Esau was a much better man morally than what Jacob was Esau would have been the person that if you would have looked at you would have said he saw my water what a really a fantastic person what a upright person morally but you begin to realize how that the scripture will talk about Jacob in that how that it will always describe Jacob to be a deceiver and a supplanter but that was according to his first birth because down beneath that there was a real true seed of God but yet what you would see an assault sparked according to how the Prophet would tell us in the message he said what you would see on Esau up here but yet he said God was able to look down to the heart of Esau and see a deceiver down there on the inside so it's what what it is on the inside will come out nobody can hide that it will actually manifest whatever the seed is on the inside the germ itself will manifest if you understand it in then we understand in the right life the rain nor the Sun that cometh down upon the earth it does not take a tomato seed and make it an orange see neither does it make it an or untick an orange seed and make it a lemon see the only thing that does is release the germ that's always there that's the same thing with the quickening power of God the quickening power of God does not take you and turn you from a pig to a sheep it releases who you always were it reveals that you are always a sheep of God it changes the nature that is true but it releases who you were now you and I without the Spirit of God no matter how much of an inclination and a desire to serve God we can never be able to please God in the right way and serve Him in the right measure unless he himself will come and release us so that we're not serving him according to our own dictates but we are serving him according to his life moving within us so it's not our sacrifice it is the sacrifice he has provided and were identified in that by having the life of the sacrifice in us so if you look at Isaac and we could say that Isaac himself being a type of the father the written word and you would look at Esau Esau was one who was able to abide by the written principles of the word Esau was one who was able to take principles in the word whether it be finances marriage on and on and on and Esau was actually able to move and operate within certain principles and you know what God if we can look at it in this slide there's one not one of us who would say no I don't want somebody who works beside me at the job that will just go by the principles of the word I'd rather have a drunkard I'd rather have this I'd rather have that but we would rather have someone that at least we could talk about the scriptures with someone that if it's no more than just salvation we would enjoy that instead of hearing what somebody did this past weekend we still know that it takes the same grace of God to save that person as it does that other person as far as to open their eyes but when you look at it in terms of how that within Esau Esau was a man that if we can look at it in this measure he had such natural determination the man had such resolute self will he had the ability no doubt to make in a way in one sense of the word his body to obey the word but yet it's not that kind of obedience that God is looking for because if it's still in the heart you're still a sinner it's got to be where you're free from the inside where it's not something that I can't do this I better not do that because if I do this how the Lord will get me and I left if I could just do this but when you're free you're free it's not about what you can't do it so I can't do this but it's a what God has set you free and now it's about what you want to do so when we're looking within these here how that Esau within himself it was much like when you look at it Isaac loved Esau now think of this Isaac loved Esau being that of the natural man but that should not stumble us because the Lord Jesus loved the rich young ruler is that right why did he love the rich young ruler he saw that this young man had such potential within his life he had the ability not because that he was born of the Spirit of God but he had the ability by even natural determination and self-will if you think about how the Prophet tells us in blasphemous names when he talks about the virtues that are a part of our mountain and he talks about those virtues and he says there are people in the natural that can have these virtues he said but that is not the virtues that we're talking about we're talking about the virtues that are birthed in you by the Spirit of God as you continue to grow and the maturing of those virtues moving out of your life by God's own workmanship so when we're looking at these things there are a lot of things and you know when we look at it even among your going to book stores there are bookstores of self-help books books that are done one that are set around for those having great self-will and being able to somehow conjure up a way that would be pleasing to God but you and I know better that there is nothing that we can do that would be pleasing to the Lord within our own self is that right but God Himself knowing that he provides the way that we might be acceptable in his sight so when you see that how that the rich young ruler mahi could you know he could keep all the commandments and the Lord Jesus if he could have called him a liar if he was a liar but he won the liar there right he said I've kept all the commandments from my youth and Jesus admired him but he said one thing thou lackest go sell what you have and give to the poor but Jesus we know was not talking about starting the first Salvation Army or goodwill industries or whatever more but we recognize that what the Lord Jesus was looking at that there was still something that he had that was actually hindering him from receiving what he said he wanted you see Christianity and that of the gospel is truly a free gift but it does not come without a price it does not come without a death we're not just looking at Calvary and what the Lord Jesus done as though it is a covering of sorts but we recognize it is the very provision that has been made for you and I that we can enter into that blood cell by his own life we are baptized in that blood cell to where it's no longer God seeing us he sees the blood that's what the Holy Ghost does a man but here this this rich young ruler he handles all these abilities but he did not have the ability to submit himself he comes in the presence of eternal life but he lacks the ability to surrender kept all the commandments I'd say he's a lovable person wouldn't you come on friends Isaac loved Esau Jesus loved the rich young ruler so you see it doesn't matter even with Isaac loving Esau that couldn't change Esau's destiny even Jesus leaven the rich young ruler that can't change his destiny you see that's why when we look at these things when we keep the word and the things that are said we keep it in light of the word that's why we just don't take the statement where brother random is told all that ever loved you and you love you'll be there with you and thinking of that in terms of just natural terms that well we love brother Branham so we're going to be there rather I don't love this let me tell you something no doubt if you walk down the streets of Jeffersonville there were many people that loved brother Branham when wasn't talking about a natural flesh man we're talking about the spiritual revealed truth we're talking about when he said to receive a profit in the name of a profit the identification of Jesus Christ a man is to fall in love with Jesus Christ routine your friends there can be a lot of people that loved other random and there'll be many left behind in tribulation because this message is not about loving brother Branham in his flesh this message is to fall in love with Jesus Christ and it'll fall in love with Jesus Christ you have the right respect and the right admiration for all of God's people hallelujah here Isaac loved Esau but Jesus Jesus loved the rich young ruler but I want you to look at Rebecca you see it's revealed to Rebecca what's taken place name n notice in verse 29 of Genesis 25 and Jacob Saad pottage and he saw came from the field and he was faint and he saw said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red potage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day that birthright and Esau said Behold I'm at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swearing to him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way and thus Esau despised his birthright the blessing itself belonged to he saw there was right in his myth he knew about the birthright but he could not see the value of it he did not value it for what it meant they men that very right was a plan to passing on of the blessing that God had given to Abraham amen that blessing was not just mere words that blessing was life it was that same blessing that Paul speaks in Galatians 3 the blessing of Abraham that we know to be the Spirit of God moving upon that life I want you to think of this just for a moment God knew even that was in Isaac that the birthright was to go to Isaac I'm talking about now not not not not not here within the scripture when we're looking at Jacob and Esau and I want you to notice here was Abraham that had to take Isaac and the blessing went forth over Isaac there was a patriarch of that home let's Pelt that blessing now let's attach this now the blessing itself although that it was reserved as Isaac but there had to be that word that blessing had to become a word that was spoken when Isaac was ready to receive it he many was God showing a pipe boundary every time it would be the patriarch himself coming to pronounce the blessing upon his children when it was time for them to be born of his spirit to receive the blessing of the Lord the patriarch was on the scene Amen is the same in this as we're looking in this case the blessing belongs to the bless and when we look at it here in the scriptures as we're looking at it now and you see how that Isaac loved Esau and Rebekah loved Jacob you know it would seem like that if anything it might seem like it should be the other way around but you know Isaac or Esau was a good letter Christian come on somebody but you see letter killeth what is important is to have the spirit that gave the letter then the spirit will express and live the letter through you amen now notice within it how that the scriptures go on in Genesis 27 verse 1 it said it came to pass that when heizak was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called Esau his eldest son and said unto Him my son and he sent unto him behold Here I am so Isaac at this time when it comes time for the blessing his eyes have grown dim remember there's got to be some eyes to see where the blessing gets to come on somebody there's gotta be some eyes on the scene that know where the blessing is to get to what is Isaac the written word they man the word itself but notice how that there's got to be spiritual discernment to catch when it's time for that word to be brought for name n Rebekah don't move out ahead of time but the Bible says that when Isaac's eyes had got them you know let me tell you God is right on time running late he ain't early he's right on time amen right on time here where Isaac's eyes were need to become dim but how did he Isaac communicating here with Esau he said behold now I am old I know not the day of my death now therefore take I pray thee that weapons Rock quiver and I bow and go out to the field and take me some venison and make me savory meat such as I love and bring it to me that I may eat that my soul may bless thee before I die now you know here is Isaac giving direction to Esau of what I want you to do that you might receive the blessing let me say this clearly we understand this that God did not have to send a new Bible that's not what God has done in this hour but he has made this Bible become a new book and as a matter of fact down through the ages when God has spoke it's been God identifying himself in the promise of his word that he is given and he identifies himself to be the same yesterday today and forever amen he had dinner Faiz himself he don't have to convince his children that he's still the same it's just a part of the DNA of who they are with his presence Woo's opponent there's a response that begins to move inside of him it begins to draw him why because they are up his loins and when his presence begins to move in the media his presence will not move apart from his word his presence moves with his word are you with me jesus said except you are born of the water and the spirit it takes both to bring a birth the water born of the word and the Spirit of God making that word alive and real in the hearts of the believer it becomes what you have been longing for and the reason that you've longed for it the reason that nothing else could satisfy is because God Himself placed that desire within you that you would desire and you would thirst after righteousness and that's why you are blessed whosoever along event first have the righteousness but praise be to God you're not just blessed but you are to receive the blessing the blessing belonging to the blessed God had already laid this out concerning Jacob and Esau Rebecca I already know it the Holy Ghost already knows are you with me yes sir it already knows you see it's got to come to where the word that God has given a person can look into the word and and they can look here within certain parts of the scripture and they can look at it but yet it takes the Holy Spirit coming by way of the promise of his word to be able to make that word alive and real you say what are you talking about by the Sanyo I'm talking about from where it raises off the printed page to where it's not just letter but it becomes a habitation it not just a habitation but there is an entranceway there that you can walk in and become a part of this word where it's no longer just a letter but it takes on flesh [Applause] so here esau receives direction from the written word being baptized and so forth but for Jacob Jacob just doesn't receive direction from the written word he receives what the Spirit is revealing the written word to him what is that leadership Esau taking direction by what he can read what he knows do this do that but here is Jacob now here's Jacob Jacob's not even around when this is being said Jacob doesn't know but Rebekah knows whether it be to God in verse 5 that says Henry Becca heard when I was expect to Esau his son and he saw went to the field to hunt for visit for venison and to bring it and Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son notice this her son who is Rebekah son Jacob will reveal God you see friends we just don't want to be sons of a written word come on now we want to be sentence of the holy spirit amen sons of God born of his spirit not just sons of the flesh come on somebody crashes the mystery brother mem said many theologians can take this Bible and tie you into places why he sickos they have known him in the flesh right what is that they are fleshly Christians but those are not the Christians of the promise listen friends when you look around and you see people on the world and they say I'm a Christian don't look at them and say in in one sense of the word no you're not they might be truly looking to the Lord Jesus Christ for all that they know and they're looking to the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior but listen to this they're not a Christian to the depth of the election that God has made known to you is that right in the message identification 1964 the Prophet said that God's thoughts are the Christian of today what's he talking about the elect then he picks it up recognizing your day and it's message brother and sister more riding pass pray fast very fast pray God's going to send a moving revival he said what it is they had died by being Christians they feel the pull of the hour but by not being part of the Bride they don't recognize what's taking place are there Christians yes even to where that the Prophet could say within this when he talks in Hebrews chapter 7 part 1 he said you know that what himself was a Hebrew surely was over there here he was lot himself was a Hebrew but you'll never hear in the scripture where he will come out and say lot the Hebrew but yet he was Hebrew but Abraham was that of the depth of election the true Hebrew of God you can see it's the depth that's why many can look at this word and they can rejoice over promises but you and I can hear this word and it's because our name is written in the Lamb's section in that which is about Christ it's Christ the Lamb declaring himself and you and I are a part of that thought now does that mean that we go around and say whoa cause everybody's Christians everybody's going to the rapture no that's for the elect listen frames the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost by way of the new birth is for the elect and a lot of times the things are said and things are passed off as being the new birth but the new birth itself can only come through and by the word and by the spirit and the prints of God bringing a change to where the person will reflect Jesus Christ in this hour notice it goes on in verse 6 so what Rebekah heard she spoke unto Jacob her son saying behold I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother saying bring me venison and make me savory meat that I may eat and bless thee before the Lord before my death now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which I command thee look at this obey my voice you know what Rebekah wretches this is the time she catches the seasons and the times she recognizes this is the time where the blessing is going to be handed out she catches that now Esau has already went on he's going to get what the written word what Isaac has told him to go get but Rebekah huh amen a type of the spiritual woman a type of the spiritual bride a type of the Spirit of God catches what the very desire is for the hour are you listening it's just like when Esther was called in from out in the byways and all the rest of the women they received love letters justification they came to the Shushan palace and as they're there they begin to go through the days of purification sanctification they're purifying them removing all of the stench of the world and then they're placing into them the great Epocrates of different oils that will actually saturate and move into the pores so that it would be an aroma when they walk in to the night with the king but remember every one of them is giving an opportunity to decide what they want to go in before the king with but Esther deferred her choice amen showing she was part of retention after Esther she said Haga what do you say what does the king want and and hey God made known to her what the King wanted and she went in before the king and the King delighted in her she knew Rebecca knew this is the time he saws busy about all of his business but she knew this is the time now notice in the scripture here and I want to leave this in in John 16 verse 12 notice how the Lord Jesus would speak concerning that of the Holy Ghost he said I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now so he had many things to say unto them but he said you're not able to handle this right now so the Lord Jesus is mindful that this was not the time the things that need to be given or even expounded upon this is not the time but remember it's him I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now so who is going to say it and when will it be said he will say it in his time howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you the Lord Jesus is declaring there's not an end to his ministry there's not an end to him speaking come on somebody you see he continued speaking after his death of the Bible said he went and preached in hell they men he came on back up and after a resurrection here he is walking among his disciples and he is speaking to them things pertaining to the kingdom of God then he is received upon hi and then he did then he releases back into the church his own life and his own lot his spirit coming down can you find Peter begin to stand up on the day of pinnacles and begin to identify the season and the time that were living it and he identifies the time by the prophecy in the word they man the children of God we're not ignorant to what's going on around us we can see the identity of where we are by the word amen the Jacob bunch look for the identity by the scriptural signs where are we at in the word Peter begins to turn that key who was that speaking on the day of Pentecost Christ hey man he calls them to the fulfillment of the prophecy come on somebody Peter what stand up there that day in reading them a text the Bible was not even written at that time it was the same Spirit of God who was had been moved upon Cornelius his heart and Cornelius said I was told to sin for a man down there by the name of Peter you know the story well notice if Courtney listen to me now if Cornelius is a seed of God do you believe he was then why didn't God just give him the Holy Ghost right there why didn't God just do it there must come through and by the word what word the word that is fulfilled the present word and notice when he comes into the house of Cornelius Cornelius says he says were all here he said we're gathered he said we're ready to hear words from thee and to obey words of what life who was it that was speaking Christ I have many things yet to say unto you who was it that was speaking after the Lord Jesus even had went through the communion supper even when the Lord Jesus had spoke in John 6 and said except to eat the flesh of the Son of Man and his blood he did not expand on it he did not explain it but it was years later under the ministry of paul what he said I have yet many things for saying to you the same Lord Jesus took the world that had been given and he expounded on that word - who - his believing children that's the same thing that the angel of the Lord has been doing his doing and will continue to do it's the same Holy Ghost that gave this message that is expounded upon the things that he has spoken why were you and I grow repeated God that's why the Scriptures could say and Paul could sort of permanently declare it in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 3 how he spoke in the in days pass into the father's through the prophets but in this last days through his son it's the same Lord Jesus speaking the same one doing the speaking but this is where it comes you must have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying not eyes to read what the Spirit has moved upon others - right not even fingers to put it on and push play but you must have ears to hear where we can't create that that that doesn't happen in this church where all of a sudden you said here at 10 years five years and all of a sudden you're endowed with the ability to hear know your experiences are not schooled into you your experiences are predestinated by God we're not schooling people into the truth we're not teaching - we're all of a sudden they begin to say wow I'll tell you what that just makes sense that's a knowledge of the truth that's not a union I'll pay your friends many of the problems right now there's been a lot of divorces but not a lot of deaths been divorces separating maybe walk in a separated life but not a death a divorce you can hang them up for the occasion come on somebody laughter his divorce and he's doubt there is no racing of that men again and then you can truly be married to Jesus Christ the virtuous son of the Living God yes sir notice here he is the Lord Jesus Christ speaking is the same the same Lord in Hebrews chapter 2 verse 11 for both he but Saint the bath and they who are sanctified are all of one for which calls he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praise I will declare thy name unto my brother thy name his life his character his nature who will I will personally declare it to who to my brother notice in the seven churches 1954 we're referring to revelations chapter 1 he said now notice here in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like the Son of man what one like him who was this his bride one like him watch how it was clothed with the garment down to the foot the holiness of Jesus Christ covering her has washed her from her own sins with his own blood Girt about the paps not a man a woman with a golden girdle the gospel that held the power and glory of God over the body of Christ I want you to watch this very carefully here because we know that we know that there is the spirit of how that everything would run so close to where it would be as though that it would make and in in the church themselves says well we have the power to give life and we have the power you know to forgive and we have the power to do this but the church in and of its own accord does not have any ability to bring any birth the church does not have the power to forgive sin there's only one who can forgive sin and that is the Lord Jesus Christ only one that can feel you with the Holy Ghost and that's the Holy Ghost Himself the Lord our church cannot do it listen to him and how a perfect can I'll do it I just heard brother MC here just the other day hearing recognizing a cue in the word he said you come up here when the Spirit of God is moving I can't feel you but he is the one who can do it in the message birth pains 1965 he said I wish that I can do it for people but I can't why because you know that that is the answer so to think of this here of how that it must be him because if you look in the scriptures when it speaks speaks of in the time of job he talks of he that's born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble let me tell you something he that's got just a church life is a few days old and full of trouble come on he's just born just to the flesh of this message is a few days old and full of trouble come on friends I'm talking about being born of the Spirit of God when I look and talk about the term message I do not talk about written words I'm looking at the message is Christ it is the very one who's been sealed within the word and steps forth we're not children of the flesh we are children of the promise by the Holy Ghost glory be to God when the Prophet went beyond the curtain of paths he said are these all branham's no who are they they're your people people those who come under that revelation of Jesus Christ any man those who are born of the Spirit of God so we look at this here even in the scripture because it says whosoever is born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble so recognize that the church apart from Christ himself in the midst of that church walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks apart from Christ there is no true impartation of life but because he's in the midst he's the way he's the truth he's the life in the Garden of Eden there were two trees set forth for birth purposes is that right tree of life then you have the woman tree - those two trees right there I know three of knowledge of good and evil but I'm talking about the two set forth for birth the Tree of Life and that's in the woman tree you isn't it out but here within it rule is it that really brings the birth to the children of God it's the Tree of Life if we're born just to the woman it dies it fizzles it's just like our first birth it grows any there's no way you can hold but when we are born of the Spirit of God it's an anchor that holds within our lives as a matter of fact that's why Paul could say picking up from thinking about over him in the Book of Revelations 21 where John saw that New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven has a bride adorned for her husband there right and Paul begins to declare in the book of Galatians that I headquarters that where we are born of is that mujra New Jerusalem which is from above she is a mother of us all come on somebody amen Mel Olivia so here we find that that true real spiritual bride but Jesus Christ she is the life of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man there's all kinds of birth that's coming forward there's churches giving birth just some types of things that's coming forward but the real spiritual pride of Jesus Christ is bringing for children that are solid upon the water is the Spirit of God that's moving in her mist because she can't birth them it takes him the Shepherd to birth the Lambs Amen hallelujah when he comes on the scene he has everything that is needed to release the victory to release the birth to release the blessing whoa he came not only to bring a blessing he came to be the blessing hallelujah this is where the scripture it is it is given to us it stands over and over even in the prophets ministry it's not just a scripture that's given out just as a cliche never let us never take things that way when he says that right now we ought to be a harmony between the bride and Christ such a harmony of John 5:19 that whatsoever the son see at the father doing that do it the fun like life amen and the father loveth the son and he shows him things let me tell you about the Holy Ghost it would not be possible without the Spirit of God given eyesight revealing the word to us we go right over it I hope this don't bother you but there's a lot of things when you look at how God is laying in his word service after service day after day as you're giving yourself what's God doing he's laying all his word in you see it's like a house if your house you want electricity you got to put wiring in it I don't care how much electricity they can bring to your box if you don't got the right wiring in your house I don't care how much is on tap you're not going to benefit from it being on tap you only benefit when it gets in your house and the Word of God when the word is coming forth there's a lot of wiring that goes on oh yes sir we believe that the Holy Spirit had come down and moved right through the wife we want him to do that but there's some times where he's got to come and straighten wires out where they're shorts that come about there's grounds that come about and he has to come and deal with those things why that the current might flow I'll tell you I got to thinking about it today how that Thomas Edison you know he would trying to find that filament that was needed for the ball he tried all sorts of things he tried all kinds of material eventually he got that of a horsehair he I can't remember the alloy or the metal he dipped it in but he dipped it in there he put that in there and that electric that was invisible it was able to harness that electric and light up the room it was an ordinary horsehair but it had the alloy on it that was able to handle the electricity and bring what was invisible to life let me tell you inside of a real child of God there lays the necessary filaments that are desired for this hour in this age and the Spirit of God moving opponent as you're immersed into the alloy of God's precious metal it begins to light up the way that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever ye are the light of the world look how Rebecca says in verse 9 of Genesis 27 she tells Jacob go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and I will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth he saw had to go way out in the field and get what he had but Rebekah says what you need is already provided but you got to go get it Rebekah let him know what is here under your nose go get why because Rebekah has heard what Isaac is saying and Rebekah what she has read she shall not speak of herself she revealing to Jacob this is what you need to do but remember it's not that of the woman tree its Christ himself in the midst of his bride hallelujah it is Christ revealing himself Saint Jesus in brought forth a man he tells her he let he let see she loves Jacob no and he said she says and thou shalt bring it to thy father and he that he may eat that he may bless thee before his death now when you you know you think of it like with Jacob you know Jacob here he is he's we read in the scriptures in John 9 it for Dean rock his predestinate is the Bible just said that the purpose might stand according to election but it ain't just something that he's just gonna walk right into it's the same thing that took place in Genesis 1 God speaks the Spirit of God begins to move and do what give direction to Jacob what it's God's promised that I will show into these a path of life it's calling Jacob into this place you know it might seem like that you know when we look at things within that of even the election sometimes it's just like that it doesn't mean that it's not going to come without labor right just like we looked at that in one one Thursday some months ago the gift is a free gift they're right not of works lest any man should boast it's a free gift but yet that same free gift is the same free gift that Paul says in Hebrews for labor to enter into it's the same thing that Jesus could say labor not for meat that perishes but labor for that which endureth unto eternal life so what is the labor is the labor self-effort in works no the labor is yielding hearing what the Spirit is saying and yielding in obedience to it that's the laboring not waiting on something to come to you you move to it come on somebody remember who I knew I don't think talking about here in the beginning the service it's time to move when it's time to move it's not just something that is worked up and just well you know this this might be the time and no it's not a work up it's God himself come sovereignly coming and making known this is the time all of this time think about this here is Esau out there hunting for the game and all the same time Jacob is being led on what to do he's already bought the birthright is that right but yet he still is not receive of the blessing pronounced on him so here Rebecca continues to talk to him and you know Rebecca says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins oh no that was Peter on the day of Pentecost but you see it's the same leadership of the Holy Spirit come into the Jacob Bunch are you with me in hell and Jacob said to Rebekah his mother behold Esau my brother is a hairy man and I'm a smooth man my father peradventure will feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them notice a prayer a surety the Holy Ghost brings full assurance that the atonement is effectual your curse beyond me that's what the Holy Ghost when it moves on the heart he'll let you know I came down from glory for you I went to Calvary for you I'd die for you I shed my blood for you I rose for him I came back for you your curse beyond me hallelujah only obey my voice and go fetch me then and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savory meat such as his father loved and Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau which were with her in the house and put up up on Jacob her younger son and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob Rebecca knew what Isaac liked she knew the right balance of the spices why because Rebecca was acquainted with the shekel of the sanctuary she knew she had the right measuring tool she knew just how much of this instance how much of this spice how much of this she knew just how much was needed and then she'd hear he brings it to her and she prepares it and puts it back in his hands and says now you go in before him Jacob didn't look at her and say I won't wear that what all while we're goat skins for what I he didn't care it didn't matter to Jacob what he had to do to get the birthright it didn't matter he didn't matter his flesh or his left might have been trouble but notice what is working the timing of the Lord is moving on his life to where he's not caring about wearing something goats goat hair all over him upon the smooth of his neck he's not worried about that at all because it's the timing that he's moving in at that time the Spirit of God is upon him calling him to the place of life can I go just a few more places watch this here in the scripture how then when you look at it in verse 18 he came unto his father and said My father he said Here I am who art thou my son and Jacob said unto his father I am Esau by first morning I have done according as thou badest me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me and Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou has found it so quickly my son all of this he said because the LORD thy God brought it to me amen what is Jacob realizing I wouldn't pass it will pass me right back you wanna pass right by me but Rebecca my mother said hey son this is your day this is your time this is your message this is your hour this is a time of blessing the Lord thy God have brought it to me right in the presence of God here is Jacob is saying the LORD thy God and brought it to me and Isaac said unto Jacob come near I pray thee that I may feel thee my side whether thou be my very son Esau or not and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felled him and said the voice his Jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of his so he went into the presence of God he saw here but Jacob down here Helena in the presence of God here was all that of the Esau first birth but down only inside was taken that which was truly the first born of God all my brothers sister his placement in life was against him every pain was against him in this life but he no matter what everything in life is against you it matters is God for you if God is for you who can be against you the Lord God have brought it to me and he discerned him not because his hands were here he has his brother Esau his hands so he blessed him so he really wasn't blessing Esau he was blessing Jacob the blessing of the Lord belongs lest let's just stop here tonight was it easy no even up to this point of what was stopped tonight how God goes on to speak for Isaac Jacob to think of how that God even in the midst of this time is uttering through the very lips of Isaac the very blessing upon Jacob let me read verse 27 he came near him and kissed him he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord had blessed therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let people serve the ination bow down to thee the Lord over thy brother let thy mother sons bow to thee cursed be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be he that blessed thee these are the same words that the Lord uh turd to Abram when he was down in the earth Caddy's I believe with all of my heart this was not just Isaac speaking but the spirit of a God had moved down at this time he borrowed Isaac's mouth but he was the same Lord God who was he speaking to is in that it wasn't something that was handed to Jacob it wasn't something that came easy but because Jacob was a part of it here he is he's able to be moved are they're fierce and trepidations I just read to you there was what if I go in there and he's he begins to feel me I'm not like he saw and instead of being blessed I'll be cursed but remember when you're being bitten by the Spirit of God it's the greatest time in the world to come but come in the clothing of his word his presence inviting you in I think of it tonight I think like when we look at their that little - the pool the Bible calls it the pool that was there by the Sheep the Sheep gate and it talks about how that at a certain season the water was troubled at a certain season but all of them were gathered around there waiting for the angel to come down in trouble the water here was that man who was laying there been laying there for years they pulled the festive here comes down the Lord Jesus he comes down and he begins to talk to that man you know it's like how brother bantam tells us he said many times he said we get compassion confused with sympathy he said our human sympathy would have healed everybody and felt sorry for everybody he said but that compassion was drawn to the one that it was sent for and here when he asked this gentleman this question this man he asked him a question this condition or as far as why that you know he's not able and notice what this what this man says he said when it is troubled I have no man who can carry me there he knew he needed someone with more strength than he had that's why he was still laying there by that pool trusting season after season he was going to get well season after season he was going to get no glassing or my he waited there for years but he waited there because he knew that was a place the blessing was going to come and the Lord God lifted him not by his physical arms but he lifted him by his word take up that bed and walk and the man immediately arose and took up his bed let me tell you he was lighting on the waters to be troubled but the one who had sent the angel was the one who was present he was that travel the water he was there it was the season for him to move into the water of the word I'll tell your brother and sister tonight is the season to move in tonight is the season tonight is the night to be born of the Holy Ghost tonight is the night to repent tonight is immaculee aside every weight and every sin that does Elisaveta tonight is the night to receive your healing tonight is the night to receive your deliverance the waters troubled amen by the man Christ Jesus traveled to do I release the virtue that you need so then how you came in you leave different you might have been on a better depression a better oh me oh my but God Himself is letting you know that you don't have to stay on that bed he's lifting you by way of your word of his word what do I have to do you have to say tonight is my night this is my season this is the season of The Lord's visitation to my heart what do I do be obedient to the Spirit of God has stepped into the water if he did you to put up on these garments let alone but get before him and move in to him say Lord take me deeper take me deeper Lord take me into that life Lord don't look at what you're being don't look at the husband's don't even look at your failures don't be obedient that's a different voice that's a voice that's contrary to the voice of God don't pay attention how long you been on the palette pay attention to his presence amen the blessing belongs to the blessed was that I do move into it clay let's say this is my time this is my hour this is my season he came all the way he said away from me he provided for me what I need I didn't have the faith to clamor to this but he the Lord God have brought it to me the Lord God has increased my fee then I might do one pick up my bed and walk now is the time now is the day this is the moment you believe that with all your heart Oh glory be a god oh my I don't feel like tonight I'm preaching a sermon it's an announcement amen it's an announcement

of God hallelujah there is power in the blood of the Lamb very man if you had besetting sins hanging around you don't you get focused on those things you focus on him who said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee you focus on him who releases the blessing and you say unto Him Lord I'm gonna walk into this water you're troubling the water your presence is here I'm ready to move who you're speaking to my heart Lord and I'm ready to move hallelujah he didn't shovel the water to work him up he troubled the water that they might recognize his presence is present hallelujah present to heal I'll tell you brother and sister he's passing right through here I don't say that to you lightly I say that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he's passing right through here that same holy clothes

what-ifs away from all the bridges they had come back Lord God so right here where Jacob think back on this blessing that has been spoken over his life for Jesus from that blessing from that change nor from that reality well that's the real joy and the hearts of the believers lambs Lord we get down we get discouraged the Lord the real joy is knowing that we passed from death unto life we're knowing that we have met you nor doubt you are the love of our life there's no return or the hardware think I'm prayed to not Lord God if there be any Lord that's only spiritually divorced there's not been a spiritual death may there be a dying for that first Adam that first nature or God but they might be married [Music] come to you Brandon whoa Jesus may you give strength more encouraging what's in each of your children Lord as we stand here we think of Jacob we like Jacob we would have missed it would have passed us right online bored we realized that even the real purpose and reality of this message could pass right on by the more Jesus were thanks we're thankful one I realize oh my god this message it's you it's sent to make known to us who we are the message Lord we know it's not the letters of the message is the person of Christ moving Lord in the South drawing us to yourself I pray Lord Jesus grant more draw the requests of each and every one of your children [Music] no I think of that in the scripture God promised said unto Jacob that the dew of heaven your portion there's times that no doubt we all like rain there right we all agree and we had some rain here this past week I thank the Lord for it but there's also do now Badu itself you never hear the dew fall you never even hear the do when it's going back up in here it's a secret coming and a secret going are you with me brother Ram tells us he said of this upon this earth he said this day there's been millions of gallons of water that has went right back up and nobody heard it wasn't it was water it was dude but because it didn't come with a great khali bush and the rain pounding down you can kind of look at and say well it just do let me tell you something that dude is a promise just as much as we need the rains we need to do aren't you thinking don't ever despise the dude we rejoice we think God for the rain and let us also rejoice him to do because when God blackened his presence in unity you spoke of the dew of her mother you do is a very precious thing inside just like in your life you realize Madhu tells the story of your material you don't hear it you don't necessarily even see the effects of the do state what's it doing it's mature aren't you glad that you have ears to hear nice you're glad that the Holy Spirit and speech team but you're glad to lead you God you aren't you thankful that the message is not just words aren't you grateful that the scripture is not just words but it's alive its life its life yes meaning its leadership to our lives you know it's times when you've had to put things together I've had to put things together there's some times they've given me things with manuals sometimes I do I'll go ahead and read I'll look through the manuals sometimes I cannot really not for the life me I cannot understand sometimes the manual I look at and think they surely left out one step they surely left something out what that where is it at what I'm grateful for is we're not left with a manual but the chief mechanic the author himself knows just how every piece Gilles together no doubt that mechanic looking over that open hood that not know now he was frustrated don't know what I'm talking about whether you're honest or not no doubt he got frustrating was trying his best to make those things work but here this chief mechanic comes up and they don't
