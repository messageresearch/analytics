think we've really missed the purpose of why we've come together amen we're just gonna i don't mean to have you up and down but if you just be seated just for a moment there's a perhaps i should do a better job communicating to the to the song leaders they're not they're they're not fitness trainers they're song leaders but you you a good time of worship you get your work out you've heard me quote it before brother brown said it used to be we didn't have to build all these big gyms he said we got we got our exercise in church [Laughter] that's a direct quote you know and uh i've said it over and over you know it really uh for me and i think for you as well when we come together uh like this you know uh there's certainly times after i've finished ministering that i'm i'm kind of weary and tired but i also found the same thing that even when i don't minister i'm weary and i'm tired after the service and i believe the reason of that is because we just we just want to enter in and we're actually entering in to heavenly places amen these bodies themselves eventually they'll it'll be a catch up here amen it'll catch up with what god's already done on the inside amen so i just want to ask my mom if she would come and just give a testimony of ben can you thank you sir it doesn't matter where you just come on out here they can see you i want me to stand by you god bless you this morning i just had it on my heart to give a testimony of what what god did last week during those services up for weeks i've had so much pain in my uh right hip and all the way down my leg that i couldn't hardly play the piano without spending days afterwards just in so much pain i couldn't even sleep at night so last sunday when they gave a chance for prayer i just kept feeling that nudge and something just kept saying no you'll be all right just stand here and claim it but and i know you can do that too i've done that but for some reason i just felt to go up and i went up and it was prayed for by the brothers and when i went back to my seat sat there and we were still worshiping the lord and all of a sudden something just warm started in my heel and my foot and went all the way up to my hip and every bit of that pain is gone i just want to thank you amen amen amen god is good isn't he amen he's the same he's the same yesterday today and forever amen we just so appreciate him so much and uh i just you know when we look at the services that we had here last week you know you i looked at you know how things how things kind of get started and you i just look at the opening service and then i just kind of looking at the next service and you know there's times i know the needs and there's other times i just sense things in my spirit and you're just praying and i just had just a real resolve as we we do and i believe we should as believers when we come to the house of god we just have an expectation god's going to speak to us god knows about our need like we looked at that on thursday night he's attentive to our needs and and you know no matter what the text that's read sometimes when the text is read right there it just strikes our heart and we say oh my here it is and then there's other times when the text is read and you can say oh i don't know my that where is this going to go but you know it whatever the text is that's read god is in control and there's ways that god you've seen this as believers over the years how god will take a text and god brings that text he'll bring it right down and he ministers right to our needs and god will take a man that's yielded to him and he will cause that man that man will follow him right off of the text write down certain pathways and you know brother brandon said it like this he said people say brother brown why you go down all these other roads he said because everybody i have preached to doesn't live on the highway [Laughter] i like that simplicity because you come to a place and i think that's the greatest thing you know brother bram tells us over and over of what a real true gift is it's to get ourselves out of the way and i believe that that's what really the the gift of the holy spirit does within the life of an individual as well it helps us to be able to get out of the way so that god can do what he's already purposed to do in our life and that's always the biggest battle that's the biggest that's always the challenge and satan throws every sort of hindrance that he can to try to hinder that working in our life but if we can just continue just to yield to the lord and be honest with him say lord i need help right now or maybe i'm feeling this way and just invite him in and allow him just to move within that channel and if there's things that's in the way god is merciful to as we acknowledge that to just help us and give a strength to overcome that and that that would be pushed aside so that the holy spirit can just flow right through our lives i want to just just look into the word here just a few moments this morning and if you could would you just stand with me i just i thought last sunday and i i didn't want to after the service was over it was just one way i felt like i could have just come back and just reiterated some points because i we looked at if you just look at the thought no turning back on sunday you think well yeah it's just no turning back but the holy spirit came down so personally and helped us to see how little things little minute things that we can get caught up in that actually cause our attention to be taken away from where it needs to be and this is an hour if there's an hour we need to be locked in on the lord jesus christ this is the hour it's always been for every believer it was never a time to live loose but this is a time all hell is against this revelation every every demon power has its guns and everything set to try to deter and let me just say this to you don't underestimate the enemy but always try every spirit and evaluate everything that comes across your pathway in your life and look you know sometimes we look at things as evil and we think oh my you know smoking or drinking or these are all this all attributes of unbelief it is terrible it's all attributes of unbelief but evil is anything that hinders spiritual growth that's evil see it totally because remember the word doesn't when jesus came remember he didn't do away with you know where it says uh in in the scripture thou shalt not lust after your neighbor's wife now the word coming in flesh it magnifies and said whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust in her heart so it took away from the actual act to where it got down into the very condition in the heart because that's where things began and that's what that's what calvary that's what redemption came to do is deal with this on the inside so the word coming in our midst it doesn't uh you know just cause things to step back it really gets down to a place for us to evaluate what is evil anything that hinders spiritual growth and i'm not going to preach on that but i just i just think there's so many things that brother daryl was just ministering by the spirit of god things that the enemy would like to try to bring in to try to divide and everything else and i tell you i think we ought to just let everything else go and be single minded single vision single focus because when it all when you know when we get to the other side there ain't going i mean you know it always amazed me in lorraine lorraine you know it's a small city now some of you think it's big but i hate to burst your bubble it's not big it's not a it's not a cleveland it's not a it's not a new york but i always amazed me how the lorraine had even its divisions in the past it had its you know the mexican section the puerto rican section you everybody and it's amazing for a little city they got all these different catholic churches and this is where the puerto ricans go to church and this is where the uh you know the the polocks my there's so many different pollocks everywhere in lorraine you know my goodness you know i mean all these things you know what i'm saying that always amazed me and and that always amazed me in that part but you understand that's not how heaven is going to be it's not going to be a segregated section over here or this over here this over here you see what the holy spirit is doing right now it gathers together the real family of god it's not about it's not about skin color it's not about ethnicity it's not about all it's it's god gathering his word his children back to himself and god remember it's just like a great great bouquet of flowers god has a great bouquet and i'm glad about that really really thankful for that well that was free no charge let's look here in the scriptures here in second corinthians and chapter five and i want to look here at verse 14 and i want to read that we read these scriptures a couple weeks ago when we begin to uh just looking at the living voice of god and we know that the voice of god is alive and the voice of god has been alive and so as we were looking at that of the living voice of god we begin to look at the thought within that of the testimony and so that's what i want to begin to speak to you on this morning this kind of direction i'm going the testimony in verse 14 of second corinthians 5 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead and that he died for all that they which lived should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation so i want you to catch this there's no other reconciliation to god but by jesus christ amen he is the word is the blood it is the life is that right to wit now notice this this same ministry of reconciliation is with this it comes in the same measure the same pattern as verse 19 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation he didn't remember even when the woman who was caught in adultery every one of them came around with stones and ready to stone her jesus just riding in the sand he did not even look up but he just said the one that's without sin let him cast the first stone and immediately stone started falling and started dropping because none of them could stand there in the presence of the word and be able to say well i'm without sin but you see now the lord jesus he turns to the woman and he says woman where are thine accusers you see the first thing that the word comes to do is dismantle all the accusations of the accuser the word comes to deal with the accuser talking about satan he comes to deal with that then he causes her to look around where are they at well there's no man lord he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more so now not only the accuser has been dismantled to hold but now he comes to bring a loosening to her life go and sin no more if if the lord jesus allowed those trespasses if he could look at her life and say oh no i i can't i can't touch her life or oh it's just such a terrible life it's such a horrible life but the lord jesus knew what was beneath that life you know what that was that was genesis 1. the earth was dark and void genesis 1 is the story of redemption of a child of god we were we were with darkness covered over our life but down on the inside there was a seed and that's what god came to deal with and bring to himself oh my god and now he has committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ brother brown would call us delegates as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's dead for he or we pray you in christ dead be ye reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him let's pray heavenly father lord jesus we just are so thankful lord for the testimony of god and knowing that lord there's other testimonies of your grace and your working lord we thank you father and lord once again this morning lord we just sensing lord your presence here now lord we just invite you o god that you would have free course here lord in every life and every heart this morning father i pray that god made every lord life lord walk in a real freedom and a liberty and father we take oh god the authority to bind satan and every one of his affliction diseases whether in the physical or the spiritual realm or in the soul that oh god that healing will come lord to every life and every heart lord may you come lord and speak to us this morning in a very personal way we pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you're being seated amen i want to just brothers i don't know if i'm going to need this or not today but i need to go ahead and have it for that for that slide i may need it may god help me not to trip on it if i get a little excited brother school it won't disturb me just don't turn it on now so i want to just deal with this thought just a little bit on the testimony i read this to you last last weekend and if you haven't read or listened to the message what house will you build me i mentioned it to you a few weeks ago it's 27 minutes long it just is so much instruction that's given in that little message of god's desire and the burden that this message find its rightful place in the hearts and lives of the people brother brahms also admonishing the people within uh their time and their dedication to the to the local work that has started right there with brother greene but i want to just break in on this here just to really get to our point brother branham you know he's noticing a condition i want to just read over this once again he said i know that each one of you if you feel like i do i'm so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i just can't hardly stand it some experiences i just had up in the mountain just to feel that once again that something that when i was first saved was so glorious to my heart and we can come into a place and we can sit and and see it among us that we are drying as we sit here in the desert i get among my brethren they talk with me and i talk with them always in a little way of watching and filling out there with the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong i begin to fill us all reclining and getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us now to me i believe that this is more than just just of words that's being said i believe that this is a reflection of something that we should really reflect in our life not just today but ongoing every day it should be something that we'd because not to just take anything for granted because it's very easy for the things and the cares of life to encroach and to come about and to try to take away and begin to extract this from our lives and so this is why we need a continual renewing this is why we need a continual refilling of the holy ghost brother branham would put it like this he says when you feel yourself getting a little relaxed he said it's time to tighten up the buckle he said and ask god for a refilling of the holy ghost so i just believe this is where in our lives of how that we we're to really live we must worship in the spirit where the spirit of god not only our message should be the flame of the hour it should be the flame in our hearts it's got to be in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself he says i'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real christian now let me just let me just go brothers if you'll give me that give me that um uh the the overhead there just a moment here and let me just i'm gonna bring us back here just for a moment we're dealing with how that in this part and i want you to think of how when brother bradman says that this this message being the flame of the hour it must be the flame in our hearts or we can't rightly present it to others so we recognize that a presentation it's more than just what we say but it's got to be a presentation of life that's what this that's what the life and the token of the lord jesus christ does it brings to our life the real testimony of jesus christ and then our life becomes a disclosed testimony that i in every action that we do it is testifying to something everything that we do is a testimony and so god's desire when we look at how that this is here how god had given this to moses this burden you see that every one of us that are sitting here today are a three-room house we are body we are spirit and we are soul three is perfection it's perfected in threes and so you find that how god here when we look at this and we were looking at this the last time on these three courts and this is just this this here now just moving to a snapshot or a side view of of that tabernacle there to break that down and as we looked at that here uh the the week here before and we were dealing with it this being the body on the outside the body to where how you know that a life can here come and hear the word of god and the repent of their sins they hear the word they're enjoying the word but they're still sin still the nature is still in the life yet they're hearing the word hey how can you come to god without hearing the word you've got to hear the word the bible said when the truth itself has to be sounded out i think paul rehearses this in in romans 10 i believe it is where he says that whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved he says how shall they call upon him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher is that right you see this is why that he says then how shall they preach unless they be sent so the real ministry the real god calling let me just say this i'm not discrediting any other preacher or minister or in their organizations but i'm speaking right now and have to declare the real ministry of redemption is to call a life into a place of a union with jesus christ to where our life is changed it's more than just getting people to a church because people can come to a church and they can sit in a church you say a message church yes even a message church and they can sit in the outer court eat the word eat the manna and go back out and there's not a change in their life the same things continue repeating over and over why they've only come to the first court there's got to be a moving into this place to where the message the flame it moves into our heart it's got to go deeper than just this in the spirit realm because the spirit realm itself now it's entering into a place of consecration to where now how how the spirit of god is moved to sanctify that life right there in that spirit realm remember they had the lampstands those lights that are in there brother bram says right in there he said you'll find people they'll come to this place and they've just come far enough to have enough knowledge of the word that they can argue and debate and fuss and everything else but that's not the objective of the word of god the word never come to make us smarter never came to make us better it never came to make us intellectual god's not interested in our natural smarts if the objective of the word is to become a is to be alive and it would discern the very intents and thoughts of our heart and draw us into a place of relationship back here in that innermost part of our life to where god now sets down and resides in our life let me say this this out here this right here this is where brother branham could make the statement in these two courts out here that you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day and every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell because where it matters that holy ghost it's got to come in here to where it raises up a new man or a new woman on the inside hallelujah don't let that scare you enter right into that these are statements throughout the message don't let that scare you at all because the holy spirit coming here it must come to a place to where it's more than just we enjoy the word or more than where we're just out here in fellowship with the saints and maya go to this church and might go here and might feel so good but the same life continues out there that's not the objective of the gospel the gospel has come to bring a transformation in our life the weather you're here in church right here you're outside on friday on saturday or monday on tuesday and on wednesday you are a reflection of the presence of almighty god because your victory isn't that you're around brother samuel your victory isn't around well i'm around other believers your victory is i have met the lord jesus christ and i have received that victory on the inside and brother that victory can never be defeated it's never been defeated he triumphed over every prince power every devil every demon he rose up on that easter morning hallelujah you see now as we look at this here brothers go take that off if you don't mind for a moment thank you now i want to just refer to a few places here in acts chapter 7 and i'm just for sake of time just let me reference here i don't want to skip around i don't want to there's times to preach evangelistic words just i don't want to do that i want to just i want to lay i want to lay these things in as god has laid them in you see here the burden in acts 7 stephen picks this up he's announcing to them to those pharisees and here think of it here they are he's announcing to them the word that was prophesied stephen preached the word that hasn't has been fulfilled he reached back in there and pulled out the shadows and tights he brought it down to show that this was god's mind to come in flesh pay the price of redemption that then his own life could come back in and not just anoint us and leave and anoint us and leave but that he might come and abide in that place now you see when the word comes and deals with it when he is speaking to these people they got mad they were religious people they got mad the bible says they gnashed on him with their teeth what gnashes dogs nash come on now let's not mince words they gnashed on him because the word brought them to a showdown the word was exposing their phony religious forms and how that they had all this on the outside but they were full of dead men's vote you know what it was the same ministry that was there in the lord jesus that could charge him on the inside and said your heart's not right you do everything for a show everything is lighted up on the outside but inside you are full of dead men's bones this same holy ghost the same lord jesus now speaking through stephen was calling them out let me tell you what the best thing they could have done was said you know what as the word was dealing with their life and exposing their life the greatest thing they could have done is said lord have mercy on me lord have mercy on me instead of trying to take their position the greatest thing they could have done is said lord have mercy on me because the bible tells us like this none of them could withstand that of the presence of god that was moving through stephen the bible even said his face his countenance shone like that of an angel remember we looked at it two weeks ago when moses came off the mountain his face shone is that right he had received from god the word and here his face was was a glow with the glory of god here stephen was stephen wasn't carrying around two tables of stone it was now the living god the living word on the inside of stephen and that same shekinah glory that always the pillar fire always accompanies the word that same pillar of fire was right there with stephen and they the bible says that his countenance it's shown like that of an angel and they could not withstand the presence of god let me tell you something that's why it takes more than just flesh because this flesh would crumble this natural birth would crumble but that spiritual birth on the inside hey listen we might as well preach while we're here brother branham is standing right beside his daughter right beside his wife and here they go on the lord takes them on home and remember how the enemy he said he came right up next to me started saying all these things and brother brahma says even in his spirit he was agreeing with him he said the things that he was saying but he says i was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be talking about god he said that i'm not going to serve him but he said something rose up on the inside always said if that new birth hadn't been there that typos hadn't been there you know what that shows that there is one thing our flesh is defeatable our spirit is defeatable but the word cannot be defeated i'm talking about the word down on the inside of our soul destined trials can come and you feel like you're at your as the psalmist says at your wit's end but there's an anchor on the inside that holds you in the midst of the storm oh my i want you to catch how this was made known there in acts 7 and stephen reaches back and he pulls out of isaiah 66. it speaks of how that you know moses built that tabernacle verse 46 he goes on to say about david david had the desire who put that desire in david god did david didn't know he was the man for that he didn't even know that but when god revealed it it set motion in david's life is that right who found favor before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob but solomon built him a house howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my wrath rest hath not my hand made all these things in the ephesian church age brother braham said man was created for god man was to be the temple of god the place of god's rest the holy spirit was man the temple in second corinthians 6 and verse 16 as it would speak here and we recognize paul would pick this up what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them walk in them i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be you separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you you see what the word does the word calls for separation and consecration see as we move through those courts from the outer court to the inner court it moving in a time of consecration this is where it moves us in a time of consecration matter of fact the holy place itself that second chord that's a real place of consecration right there that place not coming into that of consecration it then it leads us into a life of consecration did you hear me from a place of consecration to a life of consecration that's what the working of the holy spirit does in our life it calls us from separate and to consecrate ourselves unto god let me just say this if you don't separate and consecrate you'll get no further with god and i don't care how long you've been sitting here i don't care how long if you don't consecrate your life to god you'll get no further and it ain't like you've got a placeholder or a place marker you either go forward or you're going backward preach brother samuel thank you i will you're not going to stay the same you're either going forward or you're going backward that's what they call backsliding come on now you see this is where we want we want to continue to move forward in the things of god there are things that god is dealing with even in our life right now to deal with a greater consecration in our life little things that need to be straightened up you say oh brother samuel god don't care about little things really the bible says in the book of zechariah that this would be a day that people would despise small things brother branham would pick it up there and question answers on the seals and he said people look at all this other about cutting hair and this and that all that's not all necessary and you know being in the house of god brother brown goes into that he says but he said remember if you can't obey it in the little things god will never reveal it in the other things you see because whatever god reveals he reveals are you hearing me what he reveals he reveals god doesn't reveal something here and then it's like sealed up right here oh no no god hiding in simplicity right and revealing himself through the same so the revelation to well i've got the revelation but but you don't see it in my life no the revelation it flows through our life to conduct our lives this is not a church fire this is holy ghost fire [Applause] [Laughter] glory be to god in the highest oh my notice this come out from among them and be you separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you see god will deal with the life as they're coming in get rid of this get rid of that stop doing this stop doing that god ain't trying to pick on anybody god's desire is to come and dwell on the inside of you and listen god is not going to habitate with a sinful nature it's got to be a life that's cleaned up and made ready and consecrated for him we oh my i will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty now i want you to catch how moses he built this tabernacle from the heavenly pattern is that right then he was caught up and god revealed to him his desire of the tabernacle which was was the type of god's desire now to come back and redemption and come and dwell in man god revealed this to moses this was not an earthly vision moses didn't get this from egypt but he was caught up and god revealed to him the heavenly pattern i hope you're hearing me the material was already on earth brother branham said in marriage of the lamb i think brother darrell quoted last week in 1962 we have the material on earth now to make the bride ready what was being received there in sabino canyon the pattern was revealed back into the holiest of holies oh my so it's a pattern because if god didn't bring down there's not more holy ghost it's the same holy ghost that now has always been here the god that always was now that same god the veil is taken off of him is that right that's what the whole ministry of brother branham this is the ministry brother and sister one of the parts is to declare when you see the healings taking place the discernment that was to announce this same jesus is alive and well that's what brother brahma could say the purpose of my ministry is to announce he is now here deserving of spirit 1960 he said that's what all hell is against is the spiritual revelation that christ is here right now hallelujah oh my so solomon you know he solomon built the the the the the tabernacle solomon took by the same pattern that god gave moses and by the spirit he built that tabernacle we read about but i want you to notice this was only a type of the true tabernacle it was only a type because when this true tabernacle was pitched you could look the bible says in isaiah 53 there was no beauty that we should desire him let me just say it and i'm not saying this to be funny or that jesus would have not been on a gq magazine just to put it in perspective that when he stood before the pharisees they looked at him and said you're not a man more than 50 years old he wasn't but a few days over 30 years old he looked older because of the burden and hound that he had come through that of the woman yet it was a creation of god are you with me god coming down and god pitched that tabernacle mary didn't pitch that tabernacle god borrowed the womb this is the creation of god this is god creating himself a part of his own creation come on now how did god come down and god supplied both egg and sperm it was god himself that created a body for himself to come and dwell in you know what god was showing this is my pattern my pattern is that my children who are the word will be borne of the word amen i'll bring them back to myself they'll hear the call of my voice my sheep know my voice amen and a stranger they'll not follow this is why think back to what brother jerry preached here the very first service when he was here in july the favor of god quit wondering oh you know i've got god's favor i'm asking you as god spoke to you if god has spoken to you what should i do brother samuel i'll tell you what i'd do i'd start throwing wood in that fire come on now i'd get that fire blazing so hard what would i do i'd lay in that word i'd a man that word i'd get myself in that word because god has spoke to me let me tell you what god's speaking to you does it silences every other voice of doubt for god has spoken who can but prophesy i tell you what you need to do is yield to the voice of god [Applause] don't just walk out of church man praise god i got god's favor and then here it is it looks like i hope it's all right my wife you know i tell you them mosquitoes have been horrible this year i like setting out at night about the third round of coffee of the day i like setting out at night but their mosquitoes have been about all i can take what'd you do sip and swat because i want to sit outside my wife she said honey she said i bought you some of these little citronella things that can be put out there them things were teacups you know them little tea lights i mean that mosquitoes was coming by them and getting warmed and coming over and biting me a little cold i gotta warm my wings now i'm ready so you see them little them little little tea lights them little things on there i mean we could have had them all around the patio them things weren't doing a bit of good i don't know but eventually you know we had got one of these others that we found you know on just a simple one made by i think off or something like that and put it on there but my point is is that that itself had bigger flames you don't want to if you're in here and you've got a little tea light don't walk out of here and say well i'll tell you what glory to god i got a little tea light how about trading in the tea life how about laying in the word and saying we're going to get this fire going so hot buddy it will cause the irradiating of the smoke it'll keep away every one of the foul spirits and demons of doubt what should i do i bury myself in the things of almighty god media friends the reason that we get down so much is because we forsake our own mercies brother samuel there's time i'm just off the notes and we're going to go there's times brother samuel that i feel down or i don't feel like this or i don't feel like that join the party there's many times all throughout that we don't feel like but what must i do well brother samuel i don't feel like i'm getting anything when i put that message on put it on anyhow play it anyhow put it on in the car pray anyhow i feel like my prayers are going up and bouncing off the ceiling let them bounce off the ceiling they're not bouncing off the ceiling do it anyhow you say what are y'all what am i doing you're standing there with a real testimony that though i don't feel it though i don't see anything but i know this word has an effect on my life i'm talking about living inside of the interval my my mind you see god god told them let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them he told them in exodus 25 9 i want you to do it according to the pattern now i know i'm moving a little quick here according to all the pattern that i show you now the very first thing when god asked them i want to let them make me a sanctuary god said i'm there to do it after the pattern that i show them now what if you'd had somebody in there that said i think this would look better like this what would happen he wouldn't have come because when he came when the tabernacle was finished when he came that was him declaring the revelation that was given has now come into manifestation according to my pattern that's the same way the holy ghost comes in a life it's coming according to the pattern of the word but you see if man alters that word well all you got to do is just just believe that jesus christ was the son of god but that life in him came to dismantle the hold of the enemy that's part of the truth but that ain't all the truth is that right amen that's like getting a piece of apple pie and you eat the first one so you can get to the second one you know and you get you you eat that first one you know well there's more where that come from is that right i know that's a little carnal but it'll get the point across but i want you to notice what god begin with first on this tabernacle the very next verse they shall make an ark god never dealt with all the outside parts well they need to do this on the outside the white abyss and need to have you know the the wood on the outside you know dipped on the bottom in the in the braze and you know for walking the brazen judgment of god and god didn't work on the outside first god was letting them know it's got to start on the principle part the inside that's what the holy spirit comes to deal with the inside you see friends this is why we can get the outside right where everything on the outside man whoo glory to god they're a message believer that can be conformity are you hearing me that can be conformity oh they know everything right down to the line remember inside of that holy place this is where when the holy ghost don't get all the way down to the inside and bring about a change this is where you find critical spirits preach somebody unstable people i'm going to preach it gets to the inside arguing doctrine when i disagree with you and i disagree and everything drawn fences why they've never went deep enough to be born again that's why the token hear me now hear me clear that's why the token is just more than you got the right kind of dress on are you hearing me if you get the holy ghost on the inside it'll show on the outside but you can have everything right on the outside and still be unconverted on the inside [Applause] you might fool a lot of people but god will let situations come up listen god don't do that to shame nobody there's things that god allows to come up well i look at as it's the mercy of god so that that person can recognize i haven't went deep enough i need a deeper walk with jesus christ but if you don't heed to the spirit you can stand right there in the seven golden candlesticks and make every excuse in the book of why you can't live an overcoming life why i can't do this and i can't do that god will never accept our excuses but god will accept if we can say lord i need to go deeper lord jesus take me deeper lord and i'll tell you right now as a child of god i want to go deeper i want to go deeper in him i want to be more like him this testimony i said i wasn't going to preach like evangelistic but i'll tell you that motor's kicking today i actually prefer the other gear but remember the ark god told moses the testimony that i give you this i want you to put it in the ark all the commandments i want you to put it inside of this ark so it now becomes the ark of the testimony this is where the heart of an individual see that little part the bible says in the book of proverbs as a man thinketh in his heart so is he is that right the little part brother branson remember he said science was criticizing us said oh you know uh there's you know that scripture is all wrong a man thinketh in his heart but brahm said he said now science has found out there's a little space right there in the heart a little a little part where there's nothing that's right there he said that's the soul you see the soul is the nature if the nature never gets changed dandelions keep growing back because the root of the problem is that sin nature are you with me now this is why god works from the inside out in our life so i want you to look at this here just for a moment because see whatever's on the inside will reflect itself on the outside um i don't know who's back there right now running them slides but can you go me knock me knock me back into the slide here just for a moment click it back this uh that tabernacle sorry i want you to look at this here to get my glasses on you see this right here i want you to look at this you see these colors right here that right there is leads into the holy place now i don't have here on my screen but the veil that leads into the whole list of holies it has the same colors this has the same colors you know what all them colors are they are colors all four colors that represent christ the foreign living creatures they represent the life the nature of jesus christ the holy ghost are you hearing me this is why that this is why that that when the holy ghost remember he comes and he descends here into the most holy place what does it do it reflects itself from the inside to the outside that's what the seal or the token of the baptism of the holy ghost does it ain't just something where somebody can look at you and you say well i'm a christian i'm a christian yeah i really am i'm a real message believer but you see there's a presence that accompanies your life it not only reflects itself in the way we conduct ourselves in the way that we dress but it reflects itself in the faithfulness of the faithful one who has come to make us faithful amen are you hearing me it must reflect itself so it's gotten there if something's being shown on the outside that's different from the inside we do not handle and say well that's just my flesh that's an excuse that's been used as an excuse too many times it's true we've got to bring that outside man in subjection but many times that has been an excuse for an unconverted life come on now i'm going to preach brother brown will take romans 7 and he'll deal with romans 7. he'll deal with it in a manner to where you have those that are converted and how you know how it is we're just preaching moments ago you deal with times there's a battle at times to pray there's a battle at times to read there's a battle at times to come to the house of god and things are always convenient remember brother rahm talked about that oh his stroke got a little scratchy and he said the flesh told me just call up brother neville and say brother neville i can't do it tonight but brother branham said i will not do that i gave him my word that i was going to preach tonight i'm going to be there let me just tell you something that's what this message produces [Applause] that's what this message produces this message is not a knife cutting and slicing up here and you're like wow what a demonstration wow that's a sharp knife no it produces the same sharpness in our life this ain't no gimmick where it's cutting up here and man the power of god that isn't it's not a gimmick where all of a sudden then you buy the knives after the demonstration and they won't even cut the fuzz off a peach come on now you know what i'm talking about oh by these knives right over here everybody just step right up make room right up here we're going to let you we're going to demonstrate these knives and you get the knives and you wonder did i get the fisher price set or did i get the same manufacturer they got let me tell you something the holy ghost that does the ministering right here and reflects it is the same holy ghost that moves down into your life he'll come with the same sharpness same authority same power same glory oh my brother brian kick me back to the just take that off please here and i want you to notice what david said in psalms 86 11. everybody all right now if you're saying i'm all right it's all right it does good psalm 86 11 teach me thy way oh lord now this is david i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name this is david remember david speaking unto the spirit of christ this is a prophetic a request a desire this could not happen in the days of david just like the other messianic psalms it couldn't happen in the days of it but it was the spirit of christ showing that there would be a people that would come in line with the same holy spirit that spoke through david that in this hour would come under the unction to be united with jesus christ is that right and now how god would have the prophet picks this up in the message uniting time and sign to show now is the time now is the season for the bride herself is standing on her feet now for her to be united with jesus christ notice unite my heart to fear thy name not not my mind not my body my heart amen to do what fear thy name what's fear reverence this is not fear of oh i wonder who's watching me no this is re fear the fear of the lord the bible said is clean amen all right amen i mean this isn't the fake stuff these guys riding around with no fear yeah right yeah right i mean anybody tells you from a police officer or whatever more they'll tell you at times when they go into certain things like that there's an adrenaline that kicks in to help them and keep them during that time it is a way that god has made even in the body are you hearing me so you you recognize some of that part right there so when we look at this the fear of the lord is clean it's not a slavish fear but but david said unite my heart to fear thy name to reverence thy name in psalms 119 11 thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee now i want you i want to remind you david here was in a time remember he could say take not thou uh holy spirit from me because david did not and could not experience the new birth because there had to come the perpetuation of calvary the bible said he shall make his soul an offering for sin so david could hide the word into his heart we don't do this and we don't do that and david loved the word david said i love the word i love the law it's like honey in my mouth he loved it but you see even though david had hid the word in his heart it didn't keep him from an adulterous spirit getting a hold of him are you going to preach with me now they said you couldn't you can't look at and say well my you know david hall he must not love the lord no he loved the lord brother bram tells us in that outer court just in the body a person can love god you say how can that be possible because it's filial love agape love comes with the baptism of the holy ghost a person can love god love the things about god that's why a person can my love you know and this is why sometimes people get around the message and the reason that they really like the message it's not revealed to them but they just look at it it's like it's oh boy it's something that's really after that roman catholic church and man it really exposes the government those were the kind of people unless god changes them they wore the tie-dye shirts and the flip-flops back in the 60s are you hearing me they were hippies there they're hippies here brother sam you preaching straight it's because they never got a converted nature that's why people can take the scriptures and take the message and try to validate their own sinful life come on now but you can't make the word validate a sinful life people have their pet peeve quotes and everything else but it's time to take all the word of god and if there's a part that takes off our hide the bride of jesus christ raises up and says amen to the word of god because it's in every word that's going to get us out of here at the end of the book in revelations 22 john was commissioned by the angel that was revealing it still it not it's a time to speak these things out and whosoever takes away from this word or adds to it his part will be taken out of the book of life this is why it's very important here and i don't believe i'm talking to people this morning that want to go around and make excuses and put blame on everybody else well if so and so didn't do this i wouldn't act like this the reality is you act like that because there's something inside of you the problem is you're still blaming everybody else come on friends see this is where people can rest right in that spirit realm and brother brown says it in the message images of christ he said you hear somebody always making a lot of noise he said that's a sick person come on images of christ they're always making a lot of noise chatter about this talking about that going around behind this one's back going around that that's a spiritually sick person you know what the problem is they need the baptism of the holy ghost preach brother samuel i think i will these are exact quotes right here but you see when it comes to it oh brother samuel me or listen this is what i would do i would do and i'll tell you how i do i want to look in that word and when i see something not lining up with that word it smites my heart god help me to line up to that lord forgive me why because that is the caliber of the bride of jesus christ we're not here to make exceptions we're not here to give satan any room or any place we want to be testimonies of the fire of almighty god psalm 16 11. look what david said prophesying thou wilt this is a resurrection psalm this is a psalm speaking of the resurrection the suffering and resurrection of the lord jesus christ thou wilt show me the path of life it might be gloomy but in the evening time there shall be light in the evening time the path to glory you shall surely find in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore now let me just let me just bring this down here and in hebrews 10 i read this closing out last time to you and i just i want to refer to this here they want to get us to to a certain spot and i do just just just just even in our in your heart right now say lord help me to really be attentive right here just to lay this lay this part in god declared all the way from in jeremiah this was spoke in ezekiel this was spoke and here paul reaches back by the spirit of god and picks up and announces what has taken place for you and i for by one offering hebrews 10 14 he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified this offering the offering was the perfect supreme sacrifice that then through that sacrifice and the dealing of the holy spirit to bring us into that place of union with him to where united in our hearts is perfected forever there's no going back there's no going back wherefore the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their minds and into their hearts and in their minds will i write them praise the lord hey there used to be different things in your heart and in my heart right right and and it came out that's why brother baby talking about his children and come follow me there he said or any he said you can take any he said the good children he said whatever's in him he said i don't care if you put them in a remote wilderness whatever zen is going to come out whether you put them in a high school here or you put them out there whatever's in i'm going to come out is that right because really really really it's who we are when nobody else is watching amen are you with me oh my oh my my mama i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them well remember remember in ezekiel 36 i'm kind of moving around a little bit but remember in ezekiel 36 sister roseanne are you controlling that can you move down to ezekiel 36 it's down there a bit but if you can get down there i'd greatly appreciate that yeah there we go a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you wow well i need a new heart sure you did sure we did and we need we needed a new heart and a new spirit because what we had we couldn't even get along with ourselves much less anybody else or god you understand what i'm saying you could set but then when god begins to deal with the heart a new heart and new spirit this is where many times where people stop with a new heart and a new spirit a new way of thinking they begin to look at the word the word looks simple man i like this i enjoy this and they've repented and maybe they've won they walked on in you know the water baptism and there's come a sanctification about their life and my goodness they're they're looking and say man i don't have the same you know these desires and things that i used to have i don't have that no more but remember there is a further work of the holy ghost all of that was a process that he might come and indwell our life so there's got to come about a change he said i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit and i will take away glory be to god the stony heart out of your flesh and i'll give you a heart of flesh you know why because god when he wrote those commandments he wrote them on tables of stone but nobody can ever live them on tables of stone but it had to come by the work of the holy ghost that could draw you and i into a place to where you might have set you might have lived your life for so many years and the holy spirit begins to deal with your heart bring conviction to your life begin to show your life where would you be and it begins to deal with your heart this is who i made you to be and that's why you can't feel comfortable in the world anymore why because the holy spirit is desiring to reconcile you to himself he got to do he's got to dismantle that stony heart that's a supernatural work are you hearing me that's a supernatural word that's a work of the holy ghost making way for the holy ghost himself hallelujah and i look at this and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and shall keep my judgments and do them this is exactly what was being spoken of right up here in the in the bible in hebrews 10 we are reading where god said i will write my laws in your heart and in your mind and verse 17 and hebrews 10 17 and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there's no more offering for sin because the debt not only has the debt been paid but it's been made real to you that old nature has has died and there's a new man on the inside now but samuel are you are you saying that we don't still have to repent oh no we we die daily you understand me we die daily it's daily bringing this outside man into subjection to the what's on the inside can i have a few more moments thank you thank you second corinthians 3 17 now the lord is that spirit look at this word and where the spirit of the lord is there is what now i don't only believe that that's to be in the house of god but this scripture is speaking deeper than just being inside of these walls we believe in a liberty to worship god a liberty the holy spirit the preaching of the word brings liberty but brother we're talking about more than just dancing and shouting we're talking about it means a liberty that you can live a free life in jesus christ [Applause] where where the inside where the flame of the message in our heart where that spirit is the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen not tithe no longer amen amen glory be to god and we all with open face beholding is in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord we're still being changed is that right i mean you know it's like like paul i mean paul he was the smallest one still is paul when he was born he was small okay but baby just like you and i were babies i know it's hard to believe i was ever that small but i was but you know what i started eating 30 and you know what i got sent to school college everything else come along that was all part of my growing up but i had to be born before i could ever mature you understand me you're not born fully mature but when you are born again of the spirit of god then you live in the presence of the king you're living under his presence that can ripen this word and make it alive and quicken your life i'll tell you that requires some sacrifice don't it it's liberty he had made me free let me go through a couple scriptures here in romans 8 2. now don't remember i said just say god help me stay with this for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death see it's a new creation if john 8 36 if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed revelations 21 5 and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new galatians 6 15 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus you catch that we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them some of you you've heard me give this example a lot i've never seen one of them seed packets they got at lowe's or home depot or menards you don't talk about them seed packets you buy them dandelions or tomato seeds or whatever on the back of them they tell you what zones they grow in they also have all these words and sometimes they'll even give pictures i like when they get pictures because because before that you're just looking at words you're thinking well because it don't look like what you see out here right away are you hearing me you know when you get to looking at it it's coming up you keep looking at that picture there yeah it don't look like that yet but i trust there's a right seeds inside of here how do you know if you got the right seeds in that packet because when you plant them all the words are made manifest in the expression of that life you just plant them you water them and what happens the words that was wrote there on that packet they begin to declare themselves that's the same way it is inside of a child of god inside was that seed of god god already wrote everything there in that seed but when the holy ghost comes brother what does it do it releases that seed that was dead the writings that was already there ordained for this age it begins to release it and her life reflects what is in the writing you see like this like this the church here some of you are aware of this some of you are not we first moved in this building thank god it was god blessed us with this building there's things that you know we were able to come in here and we were able to start having services but there was some carpet that was in here didn't need to be replaced man and there was some lights i won't call them what i think they were but there were lights in here they needed to be replaced i'm gonna talk about the ones we had in here before we just replaced these there were some things painting remember how it was some of the painting and things how the rooms everything it wasn't like it was out there brothers just did a phenomenal job with that and with this too i didn't need every moment we'd stop and give him a hand clap but you know what that was when they came in here and they put on all them coats of paint and they did all them white trim and put them in the white doors and even when they put in these lights and all the and put in put in new carpet got pads on the pew so i could preach longer it helps maybe we need something for the lumbar support you know but here's what i'm going to tell you that didn't change this building it didn't change it at all it was just a renewing we gave it what you call a facelift but you see god doesn't come in the new birth to give us a facelift god don't look and say you know they need a change of carpet that's what it is no we need more than a change of carpet we needed more than a change of lights we needed more than just a change like i'm gonna you know five steps to a better me we needed more we didn't need that we needed a change that's what the new birth is it brings a change on the inside it's a new creation [Music] this is why as a young person or anybody else you can drive i'm gonna trying to live this and brother samuel it's so hard it's because down here on the inside thank god i mean there'll be a lot of things that will save you from even as you give yourself to the word but remember what that consecration is about say god kill this old nature inside of me kill this whole nature because god won't move into a house where somebody's living already it's got to be dead and then then the spirit of god all these scriptures we just read right here it's a creation of god then you know what's inside of you the word of reconciliation you know what's inside of you words that was in the book are you with me then you know what's inside of you the same holy ghost the lamb now holding the book in your life are you with me the same spirit of god moving in your life and declaring himself to be alive and well now i realize let me just bring this down here i know i've been saying that a lot and you might think man this guy must be a rookie plane driver but you see let me just let me bring it on down here because sometimes we can look up here and we say my goodness yes and we're looking at everything way out here and well i you know yeah i i believe there's a change on the inside i i believe that i i i witnessed that in my life the desires are gone and the lord he's the love of my life well then it it'll show itself on the outside are you hearing me this is why when the scripture says in romans the gentiles we didn't even have the law we didn't have the law we didn't know thou shalt not doubt we didn't know that but here the holy ghost comes and when he moves into our life now the scripture says that gentiles which don't have the law do by nature the things contained in the law showing that the indwelling the writing of this is the new birth it's where the living word the person of jesus christ comes down on the inside you see this is why let me just let me let me read this and i am i'm closing who is this melchizedek when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god he that's born of god does not commit sin it means practice he cannot sin because there there is therefore now no condemnation to them that's in christ jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking if i could just just get in christ and it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you're a new creation christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life see it what is it i will put my spirit inside of you and i will cause you to keep my statutes amen my judgments in the hebrew man says like you women claiming you got the holy ghost and going out here and wearing shorts and things how could you do it you see because he's the spirit of truth he won't go against his word come on now this is the bible it's an abomination for a woman to put on any garment that pertains to a man that's scripture paul said let her be clothed in modest apparel modest the very word modest in your bible means free flowing not clingy that's the bible oh brother samuel i'm wearing a dress it'll not show every form [Music] see the holy ghost on the inside will line up with that word oh brother sam you're trying to make this do's and don'ts if you've got the inside goods that wants to line with the spirit of almighty god are you hearing me modest apparel is free flowing garments and that also goes for the men that want to wear them britches that are all skin-tight nothing but a bunch of homosexuals that design them things you know what they like their clothes so good they want to see them on you preach brother samuel well this is all free anyhow like you women claiming you got the holy ghost and going out here wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of god in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be soul certainly it can't be he's not a filthy spirit he's a holy spirit the holy spirit won't let you look at filthy stuff on the internet preach brother samuel he won't let you look at those things like that i'm going to preach it the holy ghost does not produce an up and down and in and out life the holy ghost produces a sanctified life that's rooted in the things of god and it declares itself nobody should have to ask if you're a christian your neighbor ought to know you're a christian nobody should wonder in this congregation if you really are on fire for god you ought to declare itself in your life don't worry that fire you don't think it'll do it's a consuming fire it'll burn up sin it'll burn up unbelief but it'll set you on fire down on the inside brother to where no test or trial can ever blow out that holy fire [Applause] come on now then when you become subject to that spirit it throws your whole being subject to the spirit remember whatever's on the inside reflects itself to the outside is that right and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened hallelujah made a life remember what he's talking about remember we talked about the holy ghost look out here on dirt you let water come on dirt weeds will come up right right you can't look down there and say well why isn't there any wheat coming up did you plant wheat there if you didn't plant wheat fair the rain ain't going to release no wheat because there ain't no wheat there but if there's wheat there when you let the rain come in the sun it'll bring up the wheat that's why when you get in the presence of god it takes the presence of god to draw out that seed on the inside what's the holy spirit wanting to do he's wanting to anoint more than a flesh than a spirit he's wanting to anoint his word because when he anoints his word then that word is made manifest it throws the body see the body becomes subject i mean my hand don't tell my brain hey this is what i want you to do it don't my intelligence tells my hand pick this up i got a need right here pick this up see what's ever in here reflects itself oh my and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question aren't you glad you got on the inside that will agree with a correction when it deals with your life aren't you glad there's something on the inside you know what that is it's an amen so be it soviet amen lord amen to the word of god oh my i'll tell you what when the holy ghost he comes he brings conviction but oh what grace comes that we might line up with it oh brother bram said what is it it's the earnest of the resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin and mire and corruption and now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly that's the earnest you're going in the rapture that's the earnest that's the token that's the seal that's the testimony and then what does that testimony what does the testimony do inside of us it gives us a testimony see then everything that we do or say it's a testimony this is why it's not us trying to prop up one another's you know our life is what our testimony is our life is what our testimony is it's not what we say it's what our life declares i'll tell you right here today if if my life wasn't declaring it i'd wanna desire to be the line up with that lord i want the inside man right lord let the holy ghost go down to the inside i want it right on the inside hi brother samuel how do we get there look i've got no doubt people be streaming and even sitting right here we first repent but we don't go through these things just to go through them come on now we repent and we're baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of our sins then you receive the gift of the holy ghost when the gift of the holy ghost has come that brings a new creation it brings a change on the inside now let me just let me drop this in here too as well every moment and every day of our life as a believer there's no greater desire we have than that he would be glorified and displayed in our life [Music] and if there's something in our life that's hindering that if there's something that's crowding that out that's where as a believer we start taking inventory and saying wait a minute there's stuff coming in the temple that don't need to be here and i want to remind you sweet jesus came in the temple one day but he had platted ropes and sweet jesus came in and cleaned house are you with me the bible said he had eyes filled with anger anger at who at the condition that was on the inside to clean out those things that were hindering the temple from being used and declared how it should be it's meant to be a house of prayer a house of consecration a life that's lived fully for jesus christ you love him this morning tell your friends let's give everything we've got don't just give everything you've got give let give him your whole life put everything you've got into it evaluate your life you know sometimes you look at things and you think how could this be and how could that be sometimes you realize sometimes it's the associations that people keep and sometimes the associations and they say well i'm just trying to you know win them to the lord who's winning who who's winning who let's stop playing games who's winning who come on now i mean he's like this you lay down with the dogs that got fleas you're going to get up with fleas on you this is time that we as sons and daughters of god we've got up we've got a prize to lay hold on it's not just a rapture but the rapture is everything but it's to live a victorious life right here right here to live a real overcoming life right here and now oh my god i'm thankful for his mercy aren't you i'll tell you if we can just sit there i don't want to stand there like those pharisees did to stephen i want to stand with the heart that says lord make me more like make me more like you we want to be real men and women real sons and daughters of god we want to be honest in the face and the presence of jesus christ i'll tell you i not we'd want to just let the word come and just sit but let let's move let's enter into that word if there's things that need to be made right let's get it made right let's get it cleared out of our life if we need the holy ghost let's get the holy ghost are you hearing me amen whatever that you have need of to repent let's repent let's get let's get in to the spirit of the word and that things can go to happening the way it needs to let's pray heavenly father lord jesus i realized lord this morning that even lord throughout the night lord just it's like a lot of times it is on lord the saturday nights and things of just lord just waking up lord at all times and just praying and just looking to you and just thinking about the service lord just pondering and oh god i thank you father for just even how lord through these weeks and times and then how that you would come today lord i thank you for helping us to be able to step out of the way lord this is a moment of grace that's given to us a moment of grace that we can walk into it lord i pray across this building this morning perhaps even those that are streaming and will archive this service i pray for everyone lord oh god we want to give our due diligence lord we want to be very sure there's lives lord there's hearts at stake the rapture is upon us lord there's lives lord and hearts that can set here and need more than just a new page being turned and need more than just a fresh start and need a real change on the inside oh god we see the world every time january first rolls around all kinds of resolutions that are made broken in no time because man's word man's word fails even in the best attempts and everything that a man can do a man's word he will fail but god your word can't fail because it's you [Music] now lord i pray here this morning that oh god as you see and you search every heart you knew lord all that even would be gathered here this morning you know even those that are streaming those that are archived you know every one of our needs now lord the greatest compliment that we can do is be honest in your presence lord the worst thing that could be done is to become offended at you the word lord we to want to invite that word the living god down into our lives lord for hearts lord that god are in need lord i need a real transformation on the inside i need more than just a church life i need a transformation on the inside i need to know you lord jesus in the power of your resurrection lord i need a strength on the inside lord i need a real testimony lord on the inside of my life lord i need an experience that goes deeper than just my flesh and just my spirit i need an experience on the inside it's a word experience that changes my life and that my life becomes a reflection daily of what a christian is that no matter where i'm at my life reflects that of a christian it reflects that fire on the inside the lord you are the theme of our life oh god granite grant it right here this morning may there be new life oh god that would enter into lives and hearts lord god i pray may the holy ghost come lord god right here that's present lord and father and move to every life in a very personal way to bring a transformation oh god to where now it leaves as a new creation they've got an inward power on the inside lord when the spirit of god the word begins to speak regarding the things in the word there's a desire on the inside that says amen lord soviet in my life [Music] o granite lord [Music] it gives strength to lay down the things of the world it gives us strength in the mess in the midst of tests of trials and tribulation there's an anchor that holds us lord we're not holding ourselves like brother daryl quoted from that of what brother branham said about billy are you holding on to your religion he said no he's got a hold of me oh lord god as you as your prophet said it many times lord as we can say we've let go but you never let go you never let go now lord there's no doubt there's lives that's setting right here they have been transformed they've been changed [Music] but lord maybe there's things that's cluttered up in their spirit [Music] there's a lot of other appointments and things that's now cluttering in their life [Music] lord where your word said give no place to satan pull down strongholds oh god granted may the may the overcoming life on the inside may it come out that same consuming fire that moved down on the inside made that same consuming fire move out of their lives right now lord as they look to you father like they sent men after after elisha they were going to try to take him but the fire of god issued out and consumed them god granted let the fire of god just lord move and consume every thought of doubt every thought of complacency may the lord realize as children of god that as they grow they've got to continue to eat they've got to feed their experience they've got to continue lord to put wood on the fire it's not enough it's if there's a hunger in our lives and there's only one can satisfy that hunger there ain't enough pig skins that can satisfy and enough footballs and basketballs that can satisfy the only thing that can satisfy is the lord jesus christ ready lord god i pray this morning lord may it be your sons and daughters of god that rise up oh god and found the lord just feeding on that word lord and that faith muscles would begin to grow granted lord i pray granted lord just clearing out all the clutter of our life things lord god to where it was an open space now it becomes like a trail through a hoarder's house oh god i ask in the name of the lord jesus christ when it may the holy spirit lord god just move down lord to every life lord where there's things lord that's cluttered up lies lord and tried to hinder it lord from really serving the real purpose of why they've been put here upon this earth lord in the name of jesus christ oh god may they receive lord of cleansing in their life may they be in alignment lord with the spirit of almighty god grant it lord those that lord have infirmity in their bodies [Music] lord god as they raise lord god their hand to you father we come according to the word of god the lord as you said by my stripes you are healed now lord as your prophet told us and i've heard but now i see when he would ask a person why do you want to get healed do you want to get healed so you can continue to own the same way you've been or do you want to be healed to serve god in a greater way granted lord i pray this morning i believe god behind hearts a desire to be healed is lord god that in my lord god be even that much more fervent lord i pray father may the same holy spirit lord god right now just go lord to brood upon that body the same pillar of fire lord god that's right here with us right now lord god the same holy ghost that moved lord god in that testimony that my mother gave lord moments ago may that same holy spirit lord god just move to every need right now granite lord may hearts and lives god forsake every sin forsake everything of the world granted lord they that name the name of christ depart from iniquity granting lord god oh jesus oh for the mercy of god amen oh don't you love him oh friends he comes this way because he loves us he comes this way he loves us he speaks to our heart in such a personal way because he loves us if we can understand that he loves us he chastens us he corrects us he rebukes us but right through that right there he ministers strength to our lives to be able to rise right up within that that's god's grace coming behind judgment to minister to our lives that we can rise in him because his desire is that we would not be condemned with the world god wants to see himself so reflected in our lives if you went to a mirror and you looked in that mirror and you seen somebody else you'd say what in the world's going on here something's wrong with this this ain't a mirror this is a picture [Music] god wants to see himself when he looks in our life and we want to see him when we look into him don't we amen let's just worship him let's worship him let's the holy spirit oh my oh my it's just such a sweet and such a thickness let's just worship him let's just invite him in let's take this opportunity like abraham did that day when he recognized who was there he began to entertain him he began to entertain him sit down right here sit down sit down hallelujah oh my oh yes lord god sing brother brian great leaders [Music] oh yes oh god amen if anybody like prayer come at this time i'll be happy to pray with you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] it is the joy of thy salvation [Music] within me [Music] oh granted lord god [Music] within me oh [Music] oh god yes lord jesus and [Music] cast me not away from my presence [Music] restore unto me [Music] [Music] within me the way he wants me [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want [Music] [Music] i could never ever [Music] [Music] he wants me [Music] i want to give him until there's no more to [Music] there's just no more love for i could never and over and over again i keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again before he gets i keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again now when i first fell in love with jesus oh i gave him all my heart [Music] yeah more than i did right at the start but when i look back oh all the tests and [Music] it trials makes me know i love him so much more than i did falling in love with him over and and over and over again well i keep falling in love with him over and over and over again over and over and over again there's a hand that i hold on oh yes [Music] yes lord [Music] it's fresh and new each day over and over and over and again over and over and over and over again well he gets sweeter and sweeter [Music] between my lord [Music] [Music] a mystery never becomes clear without supernatural teaching is that right that's a direct quote out of the message it never becomes clear without supernatural teaching it takes the holy ghost to come and he quickens he inspires that word to our heart over and over and over again there's things that god shows in our life you know there's sometimes there's things that you just don't even realize the importance sometimes of it there's certain things that we have done around our house or even on our automobiles like when you take your automobile and you go have the oil changed they rotate the tires you don't think nothing about it thirty dollar fifty dollar job thing well it's time to go get it done but you know by doing those things like that it prevents other things down the line it actually will cause that thing to run longer now sometimes i remember when i was just a young guy real young still am but i remember you know what brother richard i i'm looking at this is how much i'm making four dollars and 25 cents an hour i got to pay that to have an oil changed you know what it was brother brian i didn't understand everything that went with it i did it i did it i'm glad i did it but i didn't understand everything that went with it but you know what for the erin it caught a lot of things sometimes they could say hey you were low on transmission fluid if you hadn't brought that in here at that time your transmission would have burned up and that would've been thousands of dollars you see just in checkups it kept major things at bay listen to me now that's what staying in the presence of god does that's what when we look at it that's what staying in prayer does that's what coming to the house of god does are you hearing me these are little these are checkups in the presence of god and as we grow older in the lord you begin to realize more and more of the value of it if it hadn't been for the lord my god just came just like that see we begin to see those things that are very important may god help every one of us that our lives be a real reflection of him in every way if there's times in your life look when there's been that of the new birth there's times you have to have a renewing right sometimes you get a new couch set or you paint you change the paint colors say hey you know what we need to change colors around here you don't change you don't go get born again after you've been born again you with me sometimes you just need a refreshing a renewing is that right and those times of refreshing and renewing here comes the love of god oh my you know everything she started gotta loot start to get a little sticky about stuff you know like [Music] someone so looked at me this way they said something like this but you find when you get another renewing and a refreshing of the holy ghost oh the love of god it just has a way of taking those spiny prickers on a cactus opens above like a leaf what does that him his presence his presence you have access we have access as children of god let's stay there let's live there let's dwell there any good amen let's bow our heads heavenly father it's just been a delight to be in your house this morning lord i know lord god is and each time no matter how much lord of the study that's went into it i'm reserved to follow you and lord how that you would just cause us to weave through different things and places but i i just trust lord as you're in control that you brought it all together but it's been a delight to be in your presence now lord i pray right here right now as we leave father the presence of one another but not to depart from your presence i pray father may there be testimonies of lives that god have been surrendered and consecrated new life has come in lord may there be lives lord of renewing may father the word itself maybe to a heart that just hasn't really surrendered may the presence of god this word that you spoke today may it accompany him lord through the weak may it lord move it lord to a place to where it's no longer a stony heart but becomes a heart of flesh [Music] oh god from that old cantankerous spirit to a new spirit to a welcoming lord granted lord go with your children this week lord as they go their different ways to school lord all these things that lord as we [Music] things that are taking place all around us lord god i ask for your hand of mercy upon each and every one dear god upon the school children lord upon my brothers and sisters lord god as we go day by day father lord in serving and fulfilling the task that
