say it adios not amigos adios no friends with that we're not friends with the world oh my getting in a wonderful time amen amen amen amen hallelujah i just want to maybe to read a few things to you if you want to have your seats just for a moment i'll probably be giving just a little bit of a break i'm not going to take too long but i just wanted to kind of give you a few updates here from different things that have come in over the time regarding from brothers and sisters that are there in ukraine as um just i'm kept up to date on the different threads that that i'm on the mission threads and so forth and this right here was just something uh first i'll read you one that came in from yesterday which would have been either friday saturday morning there or maybe friday evening here for us and there's been there's been many but i'm just going to read these particular two and this is one from marapol there in ukraine it says shalom dear brothers the city is now surrounded today or tomorrow it seems they will be taking the city military operations continue missiles keep striking there are long lines with water food medicine atms and gas stations thank you very much for the support i want you to what listen these these statements this isn't our war but we are their target and we have thus saith the lord to be strong and mighty in the faith of the fathers also with his precious presence and that is everything for us we pray about innocent people and those in the bride who are in these circumstances and we pray for wisdom of what to do in these conditions we are ready to help if anyone here is in need right now so this was one in maripole this is the more towards the western southwestern part of ukraine so he's writing to the other brothers that are there and that's why he's saying if we are ready to help if anyone here is in need right now we read what they're doing right now as we read and discuss the messages with the family praying and fellowshipping which is essential needs in our minds may god be with us he's our anchor god keep you also we cherish you and love you and then brother barry had also forwarded this one this morning just trying to keep all of us up to date and that from some of the believers in the country brother eugene and his wife brother eugene's an interpreter there and he was he's writing kiev i hope i think i got that pronounced correctly they are surrounded by terrifying news but they are choosing to have short prayer meetings with other believers close by over their phones they're actively encouraging each other especially the sisters among them everyone's ordered off the streets until 8 a.m tomorrow and everything is closed and quiet at the moment shops are completely empty they realize this is not their battle but the battle is the lords and they are confident of his presence among them the economy is destroyed and even for february they only receive 10 of their pay for the whole month anyway and so uh there's um we've tried to get funds in there and so there's been testing to try to get funds we could get it into the believers and uh it's just some of the things right now is you know trying to find ways around things but there are a number of believers that are in there and you know the other day as i'm just thinking about these things i just couldn't help but think of the mercy of god of how that when you look of how that when all that broke that union of the soviet union in 1989 then you many of you are aware here from this assembly and i think sister chrissy you're right there from bcf you're very much aware that god took men like brother lonnie jenkins and um brother eugene braun and brother jason watkins also was with him brother berry coffee was very instrumental brothers that went into these countries when everything broke and went in and brought the message in there and you know i can remember st setting in a family camp and i believe it was 2006 when brother uh barry was mentioning of how the time remember they were trying to get the message hubs or a printing station so you can download the material without having to ship things in and the objective that burden at that time brother bisco had that burden to get that in there to where they could print the messages and this is anywhere in the world there's print stations all over but it was with that burden i remember brother barry making the statement he said we don't know how long that's going to stay open so they the believers we want to get these things in there so before it gets closed off and so i tell you what the message itself you're not going to stop the message from getting to every one of god's children there will not be one elect seed of god miss it because from one election is it is for the word to have failed and the word cannot fail the word cannot fail though heavens and earth pass away but my word shall never fail so we want to as we prepare to look into the word of the lord this morning we want to have have special prayer for the brothers and sisters there in ukraine and that god would just be merciful and just continue to give them strength and just to continue to pray for them throughout the time as well the other thing is i want you to keep in mind sister i want to give you an update here on sister linda my my aunt linda on thursday we she called me and i got a call that had come in and you remember she had went back into the icu she was there were some some difficulties some things that there was having and so she on thursday had had been released from the icu she's back into a normal room and uh she called me and i was a little shocked because i've just been trying just sending texts and i'll say this to you um she can't really you know it's kind of maybe a little difficult to respond to text but it means so much seeing a text coming from you in that time just an encouraging word you know maybe a husband and wife alike or just sending a text you know just say sister we love you we pray for you you know that's just ammunition against the devil and so it just means a lot so we just had prayer there on thursday in the afternoon here before service and the prince of the lord just came in a really wonderful way and i want to just continue to hold her up in prayer that god will just continue to strengthen her and i know there's many other there's other needs here that is among us as well and we want to be mindful of that in this hour as well that god just continue to pray for one another amen this is a this is a real moment uh real time that we're in and so if we could let's just stand before we read the word and if we could let's just join our hearts together in prayer amen not only over the service but let's pray for the brothers and sisters there in ukraine i know it's been mentioned already once here this morning heavenly father lord as we just come before you this morning lord we want to say lord how we just appreciate and we love you lord oh god what up what a wonderful atmosphere and presence the lord is here oh god once again this morning lord we don't take that for granted lord but we're mindful oh god and we're so thankful lord jesus we lord it's the delight of our life oh god that you would come and you would speak to our hearts and you're such a gentleman lord you you give us that opportunity lord to worship you and to invite you and lord true to your word you dwell in the praises of your people we've entered the courts with thanksgiving in our hearts lord this morning though there are many needs among us lord different lord ailments and things that are experienced lord in the lord the body but father despite all of these things we are entering your courts with thanksgiving in our heart because lord the thanksgiving that's in our heart has nothing to do lord with our flesh or the external conditions that thanksgiving is that our soul has been redeemed and we know that we have that assurance in you lord and it is joy unspeakable and full of glory now father for these needs that not only are among us but our brothers and sisters lord that are gathered there in ukraine lord oh god i know that throughout this assembly many no doubt have seen lord different videos and things lord that has been put out there lord and even some of the things i've shared with them this morning lord i pray that god as we just ask that you'll strengthen our brethren lord god the pastors lord the husbands lord wise every believer oh god we believe that lord even in this moment oh god that lord there are hearts and lives that oh god that lord can find that place of safety in you lord i pray that god that you'll just speak lord and strengthen them lord watch over them lord jesus we pray and god to know that even as there's things lord that are so bleak among them lord with lord having lord even some of lord necessities lord just reading we're one of the brothers lord where he had lord place back a little bit of water but i was reminded lord even the other day you still have ravens lord you oh god the angels of god are still present lord lord god as you said in your word that the angels of god are encamped about them who fear you and love you oh god may you just lord minister to our brothers and sisters in this moment i pray that god that you'll just lord strengthen them lord and deliver them we pray father lord we ask this morning that god as we take this moment to look in upon the word and we remember our sister linda lord in prayer that you'll just continue to undertake for her oh god and just to strengthen her and her life oh god moving upon her body oh god the lord we we claim that promise lord that it's by your stripes we're made whole father and lord we just look forward god to singer once again lord setting right there lord in that chair oh god we take lord every footstep lord every footstep is possession o god now we ask that lord that you'll just come lord and speak to us through your word may our hearts be warmed by your presence lord this morning i pray that god that you'll just help me just to get out of the way and and just speak lord what you desire to say lord may you receive all the glory and honor may hearts lord may our hearts just be lord drawn closer to you lord may lives o god this morning lord be lord surrendered and may there be a filling of the holy ghost lord that would just set down o god of the personal christ lord in our spirits lord we pray that you'll just move in a very special way now lord we love you and we thank you father in jesus name amen and amen amen let's turn to first thessalonians chapter 4. i know we were right in the middle of where we were at last week honest reflections but i just just putting it before the lord was ready to go move with those things but i'm just just feeling so pressed just to speak to the church here just a few moments and just to exhort us even in the time that we're living in not that any message doesn't but just to be very very particular here first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 but i would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord now notice what authority is coming here we're saying this to you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i want to just just look at this take that that word comfort one another with these words and that word comfort means to address one to speak to one uh to exhort to entreat one and earn which is an earnest and humble request so it's this this comforting is also to me there's a request that's being made to console also to encourage and strengthen by consolation to comfort and be comforted and i just like to say it in this way if i can just say it like this comfort one another with these vindicated words the message of the hour these words the promise that we are partakers of his coming he is our strength he is the standard of our life which is the thunder against the enemy amen may god bless you bless the reading of the words you're being seated sorry to have you up and down but i want to just speak here just this morning here and just try to move along as much as i can but i would like to speak on discerning the time and then also continuing that part it's time to leave discerning the time and it's time to leave now in psalms 27 i'm going to read from there go right to their next because when brother branham would take the text for the message the rapture what we just read in 1st thessalonians 4 is the rapture is the event and i want to just say it in this way that the rapture itself is not a day it's not a moment it's a cycle right it's a it is it is not something we are waiting on we are waiting on the climax and the finality of it because the rapture itself is on yes amen god is sent a word in this hour to gather the people unto himself to bring deliverance in lives where our lives that were once bound and subject to that of sin and that of that first birth but god has sent a word to call us in rapture to call us out of that into a real living experience and say we've entered into that cycle the seventh church age is still going on is that right but the bride is caught up into heavenly places the bride is the promise of what god has said to him that overcome yes so god psalms 27 let's look here and when brother branham would read this he this is the text he would take for the rapture and brother brandon would refer to this this text right here as some as some background and i want to just deal with that a little bit on some background and and so when we look at this in psalms 27 we're going to read the background for the rapture notice a psalm of david the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host shouldn't camp against me now notice verse three this is getting into personal battles personal attacks my heart shall not fear amen the war should arise against me in this will i be confident one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me i want you to notice this here in verse 5. that's good for in the time of trouble he shall hide me this is not me hiding myself he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will see you i will sing praises unto the lord now i want to just just take here as a background when we look at that thought and you know no doubt when brother brown preached that message how many thought that maybe he should have taken the text from first thessalonians corinthians chapter 15. but you see when we know that those are glorious glorious events and the promise of the changing of the body but to see the background of things that would be taking place within that time and i want you to keep in your mind discerning the time the background itself you know is the area or the scenery behind a main object it usually frames it in and it's also the background is is also the part of a picture or design that serves as a setting to the main figures or object but it appears the furthest from view it's also a circumstances or a situation prevailing at a particular time or underlying a particular event so the background most of us everybody here has seen a picture and where you there might be a main main object on that picture maybe it's a horse or horses and a pasture but you see the pasture would be the setting the trees behind it is the that's the background but the horses is what the focus is but you see when we're looking at this we recognize that the background itself is not the main object of focus but it rather the background is just it's the scenery it's the setting the circumstances that are prevailing at that time are not the focus they are just part of the background of what's taking place so when we look at end time conditions that have been prophesied through the word of god and we see it all the way down that has been typed out what has been lived now and when we find ourselves very much in a time when as it was in the resurrection of the lord jesus and he would come to his disciples when they were in a state of bewilderment they did not know what was taking place they didn't know what had happened their thoughts about things had been you know it wasn't happening the way they thought it ought to happen but he came and he began to draw near unto them as he was speaking and they were talking about him and what he began to do was he listened to them and he began then to unfold to them the events to them that they could not understand that were taking place but he begin to place them that the things that are happening are not out of order it might be out of the order of your thinking but it's not out of order as a matter of fact he goes back and he starts clear with with moses and he brings it all the way up through the psalms and to the prophets because to show them that the events taking place those modern events they're made clear by prophecy and it is that god keeps and watches over and fulfills every one of his word and i i look at it within this hour when i think of that scripture of luke 24 we are in an hour in a moment in a time where there has been a resurrection out of darkness where they wanted to put him away and you know seal him away and steal away his presence and close off the holy ghost but he has resurrected he has come forth according to his promised word and he has drawn near to begin to declare the things that we see in this hour in this time we're not out of line we're not out of hand it's right in line with where we ought to be and god in this hour would come through a veil remember moses came the first time with the ten commandments he was now the second time he came down he was bailed with the veil over showing the word would return once again in the end and the bible would say in this hour of how that it is it is there to receive a prophet in the name of the prophet the characteristic god identifies himself with his prophets by bringing his word or making that word to come to pass and be visible through that life so to receive a prophet in the name of a prophet is to receive a prophet's reward but what's a prophet's reward you say to me a friend of a prophet it is to receive life amen because the prophet himself remember the church is where it'll take people from the true life but you see god sends a prophet with the word of the lord you know israel they had the law but they had not the word of the lord for god would send the prophet with that saith the lord the word of the lord and he would not be pointing them to something new but he would be calling them uh he would be calling them just give me this right here or give me go get me the please oh my cut me right in stride that's all right but god would send a prophet with the word of the lord and that prophet would come with thus saith the lord and identify right now this is the hour this is the season and would call the people back to the original call them back to where they drifted from you see this is why you need a prophet because a person can carry the bible but they can drift from the original life of the lord jesus christ god sends a prophet and god himself steps down in that gift to manifest that promise that he is still the same yesterday today and forever you say why is that necessary there are promises that pertain to you and i and we need to have a certainty when we approach the promises of god that what god has said god will make good upon every promise we're not here under a hope so maybe so we're here under the certainty and banner of the holy spirit notice what his end time conditions noah's day the conditions there were conditions background that surrounded in noah's day while the ark was being built while the entrance into the ark the place of safety these were in time these were conditions that would be repeated here at the end time beauty of women right eating and drinking now let me just pause here just a moment you know it's within a woman to want to be beautiful come on god put that in there but satan likes to take that thirst and pervert it are you with me you see look at it in type of the church the bible you know covers her in revelation 17 the church as a woman and see here she she's covered but yet she's not covered when the word comes it uncovers all of the garments and the clothing and the religious attire it uncovers and shows really she's naked and to be naked is to be out from under the blood out from under the word is that right so when we we see this the noah's conditions in this in this time that we're surrounding beauty of women eating and drinking and you see with eating and drinking there's nothing wrong with eating the right things right you might need a little too much but you understand drinking everybody's got to do those natural things right right we got to do that but they were married and given in marriage that giving and management they were just sleeping around i'm just being very frank let's just cut the chase they were married given in marriage you see everything boundaries no restrictions it was just all out now notice that was all going on that was a condition while god visited a prophet by the name of noah and his family was laboring under that absolute that he received in that hour in abraham's day you realize because these are these are promises within the word that were given to you and i in this hour that in in the coming of the son of man this is how that is going to be let me just say it to you in this manner look at this with abraham's day what was in abraham's day it was the prevailing sodomite conditions that served as the background is that right those those were the background that wasn't the focus that wasn't the focus but you see god had a word in that hour that like noah was focused abraham was focused all this this background around him was not the focus it was just happenings that was going on a setting in the background but in the midst of a sodomite condition when it had reached into that place elohim came down and took upon flesh and he went with a mission to bring that or cast the doubt out of sarah's life now remember the only way oh i hope you're hearing me now the only way to cast out doubt out of sarah it was not him wrestling and out of her it was the word coming and uncovering the doubt that laid in her heart and all she had to do at that moment remember she wanted to hide it that's the natural tendency within any life is to get away from the light but the light is not to harm you the light has come to deliver you the light has come to set you free it's a thief satan is a thief a robber he seeks to destroy he wants to remain hidden in your life but the light comes that you might walk in liberty well i don't want nobody to know about that jesus knows about it oh my you don't got to tell me or tell nobody else but you've got to be honest with jesus amen so he came to dissolve doubt that was there in sarah's heart all of these background conditions that were going on that has the word would dissolve that doubt and we know it dissolved the doubt because the bible tells us that sarah herself judged him faithful and she received strength amen to conceive that strength that she received brought about a change in her body in order to meet the conditions that the promise called for is that right and then the same elohim that was there now remember he promised i will visit that room again are you hearing me now he promised in this end time i'll ride that trail again and he came but not the same flesh but he came in the flesh of his church and the lord visited sarah even as he said he would be a secret coming is that right but background conditions that were wrong within that hour but it was the dynamics that came to quicken the mechanics there in order for them to receive the promised son so to say it in this way as paul would write to timothy in the last days peerless times shall come now there's a lot more that i would just go ahead and you get a chance to read it or you're familiar with it a lot of those conditions you see it's right upon us even now there are things that you can i tell you when the reason when you read the message right now and you hear the message and it sounds as though that the prophet of god is standing here right now that ought to even be a greater clue that this was not the mind of a man this was the discernment of he which was which is and which is to come it's almighty god that was standing behind a veil of flesh it was the word that was wrapped up there that would be spoken in this hour for that word would come behind badger skins in the lives of his children hallelujah it seems like he's just right here when you're reading the message listening to the message is that right because there it is it's identifying seeds we're seeing hearts come forward amen this is harvest time this is why when you hear brother make the statements and he'll talk about how but satan had moved his seat there from paris and over into hollywood and to identify of how that out of hollywood when he would preach invasion of the united states he would tie it in to that of ahab and jezebel that would allow that to be brought at him and he would announce he said there are streams of demon powers that are streaming there out of hollywood i find that very peculiar streaming out of hollywood not only were they streaming in that hour through other forms of media and everything but right now there is streaming going on and reaching all over the place is that right this is why the bible could say in the book of genesis chapter 6 that the earth was filled with violence through them violence could not get loose in the earth unless it had channels to come through and there was channels that was reserved or available to actually be expressions of violence but oh let's look on our side now there was a man by the name of noah who was a reserved channel unto god that just as much as streams of demon power and violence would enter the earth god had a man upon the earth that would be a channel that righteousness could be dispensed in that hour that a people in that hour could be moved by the spirit of god into the place of safety prior to judgment i'll tell you it's a wonderful thing in this hour to be moved by the grace of god into the place of safety you see peerless times are right upon us brother brandon would say it over and over in different places in the message and i'll just refer to a few he talks about divorce and rape and crime he said stop it if you can but you can't stop it right he said it's god said it's going to be it's just right for judgment purpose in your heart that you'll not defile your defile yourself from the things of the world in the message 1963 he that's in you i'm just referring to these brother but that's there in the message but the bible said sin is worse than it ever was it will continue to get worse and there is no national repentance the nation is gone just you as individuals is that right sin will get worse and worse until one day the skies will catch on fire she'll fall to the earth and the earth will burn with fervent heat but the redeemed won't be here then they'll be gone it goes on to say in hebrews chapter seven great peerless times are at hand and more trouble laying in the road and we know that there'll never be better times we know that we're at the end times will continue to get worse and worse until jesus comes you see nobody can promise you better times and if somebody is you better run from them that's not according to the word of god that's a false spirit but the real spirit of god yes can announce that there the times is getting worse and worse but there's a place of safety that you can run into there's a place that in the midst of judgment you can receive mercy there is a place that while all of this distress is going on there is a place where you can have real joy and be stabilized against the pressures of this hour you know rapidly i read this quote to you on thursday night it'll rapidly get worse it's not going to gradually but rapidly get worse and it refers when russia goes down there to get that oil and that's all she needs and he says now get ready to meet christ he's sending great revivals and meetings and stirring the full gospel people signs and wonders appearing everywhere great wonders to draw his people together and one day he shall come the deliverer now in malachi chapter 4 verse 4 from your scriptures to us it should be i said it should be remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord notice before i will send him to you it'll go throughout all the world but i'm sending him purposely for you you see that ministry of a prophet is a ministry of life it's a ministry of mercy it's a ministry of grace but if it is rejected it becomes judgment but before oh thank god for his mercy and desire friends before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord somebody say before before satan would have loved to have you but before [Applause] how many were at their last moment or their wits end or wherever you're at but before the enemy can take you [Applause] god had a promise in his word hallelujah it's necessary that this word would come across your path and draw you into a place of surrender and transform your life can i say it like this even when you were in your mother's womb it was one of the safest safest pregnancies there was you know why because god was watching over his seed hallelujah the enemy could have tried to come with all sorts of upset and diseases and everything else but before god has a preparation now verse 6 here well we could preach on that but let's just try to go verse six and this is what he'll do he shall have a tv station and gather everybody to himself no amen this is what will be the evidence he will turn the heart of the fathers to the children that was the first coming that is identified in the scripture as the ministry of john the baptist right because see the ministry of elijah remember what it is it's calling them out they were all caught up under baal right truth right it's a calling out and the living god come on the scene to manifest himself john's ministry was a ministry of preparation for god himself to come on the scene is that right there's got to be a preparation that's made that's just why the coming of the holy ghost in your life there must be a preparation the holy ghost just doesn't come there is a preparation that is made and that preparation comes by the spirit of god dealing with your heart through the word and what is he doing he is preparing the pathway for himself now here's here's the promise that we're living in and the heart of the children to their fathers so the heart of the children back to the apostolic fathers lest i come and smite the earth with the curse of returning right back to the same original pentecostal blessing not pentecostal organization pentecostal blessing going back to an acts 2 and 4 experience is that right now notice in matthew 17 i i'm just reading these things to lay a little background here now here are the disciples they came to him and they said the scribes they're saying that elias elijah must first come well they were right right right elijah must first come you say wait a minute i thought you said it was john the baptist it was the spirit of christ with the same characteristic that it was in elijah is that right same characteristic that caught him back to the original sacrifice notice elias truly shall first come and restore all things he's speaking of the time we're living in shall first come now notice how he changes in verse 12 but i say unto you that elias elijah is come already he was announcing that ministry has already come and they knew it not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist now look at this jesus never had to say this is john the baptist but he identifies it with the word and when he identified it with the word among believers that's where understanding comes to believers believers do not receive understanding from a textbook from a manual the believers receive understanding that comes by the ocean of the holy ghost taking a hold of the word and begin to break the seals off of it and be able to understand oh this is the hour we're living in are you hearing me this right here was a key moment for their lives because to recognize this was john the baptist what's it doing it's putting them there in line of the scripture to where we are at right now now brother adam will take it up in the message the rapture and identified in this way and he said there's too much supernatural vindication of god's written word of this hour for something not to be approaching us he said you hear these brothers standing up behind the platform and saying a message of the hour he said what they are actually getting at it's god's promise of this hour that he promised of what he would do and we see him scripturally vindicating it foretold it's perfectly each time because it's god saying it well the rhyme goes on i i've just always you know been drawn to this here in marvel how you know you understand that this message supernaturally under the orchestration of the holy spirit and let me tell you this message has not been manhandled and it will never produce itself through the handling of man but when when it is the spirit of christ remember it's the spirit of christ that must pack the message of the hour is that right it must be the spirit of christ because it takes the spirit of christ the dynamics of god to produce the mechanics and give life to him and cause it to move down the road you know we're not interested in being associated around something we're here this morning because of life there's a yearning in our heart and if you don't have that this morning let me announce why you're here you're here because there's a drawing power that's trying to draw you to the healing stone that's announcing to you right now that the fountain is open in the house of david the promised word of god in this hour it'll clean your life up it won't just bring you to an altar over and over it'll clean your life up it'll take habits out of your life it'll place a reality on the inside by the new birth that you're a new creature think of this and the message of rapture goes on i love how it says it here he says you know and we go back in the scriptures he says and it may seem foreign to us but we turn right back in the scriptures without even knowing where to look and the holy spirit brings out and just puts the whole word together makes the picture there to show us the hour we're living in we're changing dispensations you see he was announcing within that message of the rapture you know it continued to hold in all the way through the message it was honing in on one goal and that was a relationship between god and his people where a bride would be united with christ where that god himself would finish the mystery the his temple the house that he was building by revelation that he would he himself that built that house by the revelation of himself personally would come and cap it all off with himself are you hearing me now now you see this is why he can announce and say we're not building a wall we're building a house amen that's why the coming of the lord the announcement the silence is because he descended to his tabernacle come on and there's a woman up on earth who's learning in silence hallelujah oh glory be to god notice he says in end time evangelism the end time messenger and message should meet with end time conditions oh he said the message could not have been preached 40 years ago no the end time message and messenger has got to meet back there in them days they probably wouldn't have worked but it's got to cope with end time conditions be converted believe the gospel signs that's the message of today wash your souls in the blood of the lamb and believe in the gospel that the end times signs are here the seed of the gospel has been taking place oh my i love you just preach a message called that's the message you see that's in the message is the restoration back to the original pentecostal blessing oh hallelujah back to where the same one who was who was crucified who went down into the grave and descended into the lowest parts of hell and rose upon that easter morning and leading captivity captive had a meeting with his disciples and then he ascended on up on high and he was there holding the password to get in open ye up the everlasting gates and they said who is this king of glory oh my who is this it's the lord mighty in battle oh my he won the second person and overcome oh my he won the secretary that came down it was the lord himself that descended down hallelujah and the gates open you the gates of righteousness glory be to god and he sent back the holy spirit back down upon earth and that holy spirit being manifested in the lives of the believer it reflected the mighty conqueror as he was seated there on the mercy seat it reflected it back in their life giving them dominion over sin flesh the devil and the world amen glory to god i feel like speaking in tongues it's a preparation hour that we're in matthew 16 1 the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven he answered and said unto them when it is evening you say it'll be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it'll be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed that's a resurrection sign now brother brown will take this and i'm going to say this if you haven't listened to the message uniting time and sign i i've been for weeks just listening to it over and over not with the intent of ministering this but if you haven't listened to it i'll give you the date here it's a 1963 august the 18th and brother branham would take in that message and he identifies right where we're at which is throughout the message and he would speak of how that god in this hour he was rebuking that scriptures we read he was rebuking the clergy for them not knowing what was taken place and he said you know god writes it so plainly so nobody could escape it right you see god gives brother brown said it's always been god's way so they were asking him for signs he said god he he gave him natural signs so that everybody would know what time it is he would have prophets that the prophets would come and as it would say in the scripture he had understanding by visions from the lord and the word of the lord came to the prophets of old so the prophets give a sign so a prophet himself is a sign a prophet is a sign of impending judgment amen you see according to what god has promised within this hour so we find that even within this you know let me just pause here because i feel that coming to me it's just like when you look at hebrews chapter one and i know there's a lot of individuals that like to go in this and i'm not going to say that it'd be people that are around our ranks but sometimes there's things that can come around and say well you know the law and the prophets were until john but the understanding of that scripture is all that the law and the prophets spoke of concerning the messiah come on now because there was still more to be fulfilled and when the scripture said in the book of hebrews chapter one that in sundried times he spake to the fathers in the prophets but in this last days has spoken to us through his son his son is the word is that right and then remember that when the church ages started the word was lost it had been little by little by little right it had been speaking there through the sun but in this hour we're not under a partial light amen but the bible we're under the sun is shining in its strength as a matter of fact the bible says in the book of isaiah that the strength of the sun would be seven times strong we are living in the hour where the sun is shining in his trip why would it need to be in his strength because it takes a harvest time life to bring harvest time conditions and harvest time ripening there shall be light in the evening time amen he's speaking through his son through his word to you and i personally yeah oh my but you see the religious in that day the pharisees sadducees and them they thought they were living pretty peaceful so they weren't looking for no messiah they weren't watching for the sign brother brown would pick it up and say these signs are given for believers he would say it don't matter how many pillar fires could appear on the platform it'll never have an effect up only upon believers you see the word is what takes an effect that's right and i'm so glad i'm glad it ain't up to man who decides who i'm gonna preach now man we'd like to cut it off come on friends we've had isms come around our message and want to cut things off and i've got the revelation you got to come to me and you got to seek it out but let me tell you something there is not a child of god that will stay in a condition like that where they're isolated off why we are born by one spirit into the body of jesus christ it's a longing in our heart to be united with the rest of the body there is no big eyes and little use the only thing is jesus christ and that's the only thing we care about hallelujah how are we going to get down all these fences we ain't tearing the fences down just let the water the resting water of the holy spirit come forth it'll cause the water level to rise it'll bring out everything where there were barriers the water level will rise and there's no more barriers you know what the problem is some of you need to let the water rise in your own life you got too many barriers in your life you're busy building fences about this and fences about this look it's a natural thing within our life to build fences to say i don't want to be hurt nobody wants to be hurt and neither am i telling you to put yourself into a place to be hurt but it's time to invite the holy spirit on the inside it's time to open up and say god i need a refilling or if you haven't been filled i need a feeling lord i need to be delivered of the fences in my life the barriers that have wanted to hold me back oh god let the resting mighty wind come down lord hallelujah he pointed out jesus pointed out national signs heavenly signs earthly signs so there's natural signs national signs earthly signs and there's heavenly signs now remember in the scriptures where jesus would take in matthew 24 and in matthew 24 he would unfold the seals in there he would unfold even the whole what brother brown called the amateur tribulation of the eichmann time it's everything was unfolded clear down into the coming of the lord and the turning the dealing with the jews and wrapping all that up but here's something that we find in the scriptures matthew 24 32 now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is nigh so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors now just in case you didn't know but i i'm just going to take it as though you don't know but i believe you do but abandonment identified that the same night that the angel of the lord came to him and commissioned him there in may of 1946 is the same hour where israel become a nation now i know when you go look it up on the internet you don't want to point out 1947 or 1948 but if you go to dig a little deeper there it's in 1945 when the president of the united united states here that actually allowed members to go in there are you hearing me now you see god has spoke to this that this would be a parable that in this time you know if you want to know what time it is as far as is it getting close to quitting time you look at your watch if you want to know is it time to you know plant potatoes you look at your calendar right but israel is god's timepiece you can look at it and you see what's taking place and israel has been back there in her homeland now i want to i want to switch here just a little bit and i wanted to pick up another place here and let's look in the book of daniel chapter 2. in order to just deal with this here just just a few moments on this image in verse in verse 36 or let me start in daniel 2 34. thou saw us till that a stone was cut out without hands now daniel is is seeing he's showing now in these verses exactly what nebuchadnezzar saw a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broke into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth now now in daniel 30 daniel 2 36 how daniel begins to unfold the interpretation to the king now you know when we look at this here i want you to understand this for a minute daniel remember we set a prophet to receive a prophet in the name of a prophet there comes life death was upon this kingdom nebuchadnezzar he said when them those astrologers soothsayers whatever they were they came and why don't you just tell us a dream nebuchadnezzar said i'm going to kill every one of you because i know all you'd want to do is me tell it to you and then you want to twist it around and try to bring it out like this but you see in that moment daniel speaks out and he says you tell the king don't be hasty there was somebody in the kingdom who knew there is a god who interprets what he sends he interprets it thou king are the king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beast of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thy hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold and after these shall arise another kingdom and farrier to thee another kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with my reclaim now that fourth kingdom is that roman kingdom now remember this vision right here i don't have time this morning but this vision it parallels daniel 7 revelations 12 and revelations 13. remember papal remember that of pagan rome that beast it received a wound but that wound was healed right where pagan rome there went powerless but now that through papal rome there was a revival right is that right and so when the scripture here identifies i want you to catch this here satan's number has already been called out before he ever advanced amen oh my notice how that the iron itself it shall it shall go forth then into the feet and the toes brother branham would say it in this manner he said you know when you think of he says revelations 13 3 i'm just going to refer to this was wounded to death the pagan roman empire but it came back to life as the holy roman empire rome as a material nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely but it mattered not now for her religious empire would keep her on top of the world governing from the inside where she would not appear to do so from the outside are you with me she doesn't have an army but see she sweeps in and just able to take the nation see everything putting forth see all these things were adding up everything from even the seed in hollywood all these things are moving forth and if there is a weakening and a weakening and a weakening and then here when it moves into that place think about where we're at right now i know they just there's one gentleman retiring from the supreme court but do you realize the makeup of the supreme court right now seven catholics two jews and one of the jews is retiring i've studied to find out what is the lady that they're putting in there now she has professions of faith as a matter of fact when you go to look her up she's on the catholic headlines just read it last night on the big catholic report you see came in and took it without a shot i need more time to preach this to preach some of these behind the scenes parts but i just got to move on today because i'm not gonna i'm not gonna dwell within that but you see how it it's just it's setting it up and you even get the conservative parts the envy evangelicals and everybody yes yes yes yes it's a conservative appointee yes yes yes you see what it is it's rallying against something that's setting them up i'm not going to preach this this morning but notice daniel chapter 2 verse 42. let's go on and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken you see anything that's divided will fall are you hearing me now that's why you can't be a divided christian you can't have a divided heart you can't love the things of the world and say well i love god you've got to make up your mind and be totally sold out because to be divided in this hour is to be overthrown that's what david could say in psalms 86 unite my heart to fear thy name oh god it's an hour where things are coming to try to divide and divide and divide right satan knows if he can come and divide he can conquer is that right you see you can't live a victorious life as long as you're divided a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways brother samuel why do i keep on having this trouble cause you haven't surrender your life to god you need to invite god come and kill this whole worldly nature in me amen brother samuel i'm a pretty good guy i'm a pretty good girl but remember good guys and good girls go to hell too amen [Music] come on friends the rich young ruler that guy was a good guy but he lifted up his eyes in hell because he rejected eternal life you can't serve god with the divided heart the message of the hour came to turn our hearts that's what the real word birth is that's what the real baptism of the holy ghost is it's turning your heart back to the apostolic fathers to where you're united with this word fully in your life i'm going to preach in a house it's not enough just to go along with it it's not enough just to come here to church you've got to meet jesus christ you've got to meet him yourself [Music] that's what this message calls us back to as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and where has thou saw its iron mixed with my reclaim they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay brother and will pick this up as a prophet of god and he'll deal with verse 43 and speaking about intermarrying catholics marrying protestants what does it do weakening let me tell you something brother brandon said that you take a good woman and a bad man he'll either make him a bad woman or make her a bad woman or she'll make him a good man is that right but let me just let me let me let me move on to that quarter is that all right if you really met jesus christ that's who you need to get married to first you get married to him first he'll tell you who to marry you can trust his judgment because you're not looking out here seeing if you can find christ but if you're trying to find christ you'll find your mate come on friends see everything satan works oh my satan works to try to break break things he tries to break the power and influence of this word upon your life that's why i want you to hold on to them old friends i ain't got nothing against them people i'm not saying you should either but look what they're doing to your life if you're spending more time around worldly people and worldly friends you need to check your appetite on the inside you're mixed iron and clay you're trying to mix the holy ghost with a cesspool how can two walk together unless they be agreed [Music] hallelujah preach brother samuel thank you i think i will this is not a time to be divided all right that's the truth oh my you see in the thy tyrant age brother brown would pick this up all throughout the message but i'm going to read it from here he says i want you to recall the vision of daniel i think i have this one the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet that was iron and clay see the iron is the roman empire but now it's no longer solid iron play is mixed in it yet it's there and running world affairs in both the democratic nations and more despotic ones the roman church is in every nation it is mixed up in it all mixed up in it all [Music] let me give you a little something on the iron and clay remember when khrushchev beat his shoe on the desk at the u.n october 1960 well there were five eastern nations there and five western cruise ships spoke for the east and president eisenhower for the west in russian khrushchev is clay and eisenhower means iron you can look it up the two main leaders of the world the two big toes of the feet of iron and clay were side by side we are in the end of it all tell me it was just by chance that the shoe was taken off i don't think so you see others look at look at friends even in this hour or you can see all sorts of youtube videos and you see different ones i i've seen a heading on a youtube video all the iron and clay is mixing together and then when i looked at it and said well they might be able to they might be able to see that part of it because you can read commentaries and commentaries will talk about that but you know what the difference is is not only to see that but to identify the scriptural sign in this hour it's one time one thing to see a natural sign it's one thing to see a national sign it's one thing to see an earthly sign but you must see the heavenly side because it's a heavenly sign that unlocks every other sign is that right and the heavenly sign is his word may manifest so notice the shoe taken off and beaten on the desk the two big toes eisenhower and khrushchev five eastern five western can i have just a little bit more time amen now the bible tells us and i'm just going to make some references here the bible tells us in romans 13 daniel also records this as well that god sets kings up and takes kings down right nebuchadnezzar thought nebuchadnezzar thought he was the big cheese you know i'm the guy everybody daniel said no god takes down and god sets up whatever means it has to come by god will take down and god will set up is that right now notice there is in romans 13 1 there is no power but of god the powers that that be are ordained of god amen it doesn't listen to me you're wasting your time aaron everything about the president about everything else so true you wait because let me tell you something it couldn't be there unless god ordained it are you hearing me it couldn't be there unless god ordained it come on friends it wasn't people or ballots that put him there god ordained it now i mentioned to you the statement here on thursday night regarding the seven visions i want you to think of when brother branham speaks of this that as he is announcing that were at the end and remember what he said regarding 1977. you know even brother george smith standing here but i told you the day i you know we've heard that many of the older even older ones here that's heard this brother dave you've heard it already but when they asked for the branham why was it why was it just 1977 you were looking at you said because it was so dark i couldn't see nothing beyond 77. yes now i'm going to tell you when you go back and study brother lonnie did a tremendous study on this and breaking it down but when you go down and you just ted it yourself you look at when america rejected the gospel in 1956 billy graham or roberts brother ministries sweeping across this country it was announced and declared this is a pivotal year and you look after the rejection of the gospel you say well they were carrying around the bible the gospel is not the written word the gospel is the holy ghost the manifested word of the hour and they rejected it you're with me just reading here last night think about it the earthquake that took place in alaska there some days there with that visitation on mount sunset and that earthquake there in alaska it shook buildings clear over in switzerland brother branham pulls us together and identifies he said that happened on a good friday and he said wasn't there an earthquake on another good friday when they rejected our lord jesus christ he said see that earthquake came showing jesus is put out that's why 1963 the ministry that comes forth to ident and indict this generation to indict the churches there's an indictment that's been made hallelujah and these visions brother bram said seven continuous visions that came there in june of 1933 i'm not much of a math guy but i know that that is close to being 90 years 89 years ago june now let me say this brother brown goes through these seven visions and he speaks of them you mind if i read them not all word for word but just refer to it for a few of them the first vision mussolini's invasion into ethiopia incredible brother branstad when he told that in his church some people got mad he said that cost me a lot but you see all he's doing is telling the vision the next one was the rising of adolf hitler a dictator over germany the next one would be in the realm of politics and i want you to watch this third vision in the realm of politics and he would show me the three great isms fascism nazism communism and the first two fascism and nazism would be swallowed up in the third and the voice admonished watch russia watch russia keep your eye on the king of the north and that's a yeah russia this is 1933. it was not called russia it was called the ussr soviet union but the holy spirit is time was calling it out watch russia now let me just d can i i've already started this far let's see if they're the same you tricked us no but notice watch russia the voice the voice of admonish watch russia watch russia the fourth the fourth vision showed great advances in science that would come after the second world war you know the remote control car right you're going to go back and look it up ford had one of the first ones 1925 remote controlled newspapers right out on it are you with me things have been going on all the time now the the fifth one the fifth version the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women cutting her hair wearing men's clothing but you see that that women in the natural is only reflecting the church because why a cut hair listen a cut hair symbolizes rebellion when israel in the book of jeremiah walked away from god god said go ahead and cut your hair off why because inwardly they were rebelling against the word and the word is her veil and remember when she removes the word she's removed the authority and the veil of the word the fifth vision now over and over through the message and i'm just gonna take what the prophet said i see it over and over and over again he says five of the seven visions are fulfilled now you and i can say in this hour the sixth vision where there was a rose up in america most beautiful cruel woman that's twofold are you hearing me you look it up in sixfold daniel even the daniel vision how brother brown would say it how the spirit of the lord would have him say it right there in that message and identify he says there i see the woman standing in a purple dress come on friends we also know it's speaking of the roman catholic church where did that show us we're at the seventh vision is the last vision when i heard a terrible explosion and i looked and i saw nothing but debris caters and smoke all over the land of america now let me just say this you heard that watch russia we see what's going on right now within the world i want to remind you when brother band will draw you know brother brown would pick up the over and over you'll hear him in the message he'll say what in the world's wrong with these preachers crying out against communism he said well i don't agree with it he said but it shows they're looking at the wrong thing see a trap of the enemy he said they're crying out against and everything he said what's wrong with them he said what they don't recognize that it's a tool in the hand of god to bring judgment on the see satan knows how to put smoke screens to get you looking at the right thing and he'll come right in the back door if he can get you looking at the wrong thing he'll come right in the front door that's why you must look unto jesus looking unto him looking for him if you're not looking for him looking for him down into him satan can come in so easily that's why brother branham could tell us and just just this statement like this he said the reality is he said russia is only one percent communism are you with me only one percent communism he said but it's the controlling percent let me finish it now he said well look hollywood's only one place but it's controlling he said he look at our churches two-thirds of people professed christians but hollywood has influence over them one little place has influence now he says look he says how that all of this control would come out he said now you would look at that he said and you would say one percent he said 99 of russia is still on the christian side but you see say how could he say that he said it over and over in the message he said what they need is a messenger a voice of god you know what that is they needed the ministry of malachi 4 in this hour to give them courage to stand up again because communism raised up because the church failed are you hearing me brother braham said the reason communism is in russia is because the church was there and they were failing to produce what the word set it off to produce and he said don't look clear over there he said look right here at home he said it's not the worm on the outside it's a worm in the core you say he said one percent how can one percent question answer in the seals how can one percent control 99 he said that ought to explain it to you right there if god didn't permit it it'd be thrown out a long time ago because russia is going to be the one that brings her doom in one hour russia is going to drop the bomb the spirit of god spoke through the messenger of this hour and said thus saith the lord they will drop the bomb on the vatican so rome's not you know rome is to rule the world not communism are you hearing me boy i'm telling you it is amazing all of this can be right here you see that's why god has sent us a word within this hour to be zeroed in on what's taking place come on friends let me tell you something all the rest of these groups that's rising up listen to me now with the communistic themes don't focus on them or we're going to rid them out of our nation you're going to be left behind you got your focus on the wrong thing there will be no national repentance come on friends all of these things are inspired in that way but there's another inspiration that has come to the believer the rest of the world won't receive this inspiration it's not an inner inspiration to stay here it's an inspiration to leave here brother samuel that makes me sad sad for for what you see the country going through but do you shouldn't be living in sadness you ought to be living in the joy of the lord get your focus on the right things just say the lord get your focus on the right things hallelujah some of you know more about politics and you know about the message that's right shame on you you're backslidden i don't care how much you know about the politics you ought to be bearing your nose in the message you ought to be getting in the message you want to know more about what's going on brother samuel i come to hear it preach you ought to be getting into it there's no excuse it's on our phones it's everywhere all around us [Applause] brother samuel that's strong strong meat belongs to them that's full age it's a tool in the hand of god brother braham says there's three curtains you heard him say this as he said you've got he said the iron curtain the bamboo curtain he said but there's another curtain it's called the purple one that's the one he said you want to watch for it's going to take over and you be very careful it's so so deceitful he said oh everybody's scared about communism you see that's all that's a setup even for this hour i'm not going to touch that today that's a setup only but he says what communism is is it'll burn the with fire because it's playing right in the hands of god but he said you know as we're looking at these things he says don't watch the iron curtain meaning meaning russia bamboo curtain china but watch the purple current that's the one that's going to get you he said now communism is nothing in the listen to this statement a tool in the hand god's hand playing right up it won't amount to nothing don't fear about that that's listen to this statement now that's something to throw you off of the track of looking we can bring it down very very simple if satan can get our focus diverted he can come right in if he can get your focus in your home diverted he can come right into your home come on now you've got to keep your eyes centered on jesus christ it's to stay lined up not just well i believe the message no he's got to be lined up because if you're not focused on the right thing he can come right in come on friends this is where he says something that'll throw them off track and what they're looking for he said but don't you never foreseel don't you never watch communism but you see there's a heavenly sign i wish i had i wish i had strength to preach this right now there's a heavenly sign brother brad said all these other signs that's taken place he said there's another uniting that's going on amen and that's what i want to point you to amen there's another uniting that's going on come on friends god is uniting with his bride amen think of this uniting taking place where god himself a heavenly sign god come down according to his word and god stands here in revelations 10 how the holy spirit descending down in a heavenly sign and god would manifest himself through the ministry of malachi 4 but remember that manifestation was only to announce he is the same and it's the same experience for the bride of jesus christ it's a heavenly sign i'm just gonna have to pull up there i just don't i just feel just to pull and stop right here lord willing we'll pick it up here again but i want you to to notice this here there is a heavenly sign and while the rest of the world they can look and they can see different signs earthquakes you can hear a lot of those things even among religious people and they would say things you see this sign we see this sign but you see the difference is when the word of the lord has come it identifies this is the season right now and there's a scriptural manifestation and with that scriptural manifestation is so that we might enter in to union with him who is the word let me say this in this hour we just we'd have to stop there i'm sorry i can't just feel just to just stop there i don't want to give you too much this is an hour friends there's no more playing church really to be playing church is is not the right thing to even go along with i'm just going to tell you don't be living off of a past experience either brother samuel i've seen the message was true years ago but do you if you really see it's true do you understand what it's pointing you to it's calling you to a real life not just to be associated around something but to be united with jesus christ because remember there is a call there is a word that goes out to bring us and to unite us together with with jesus christ that's a heavenly sign that the believer is in tune with don't i say it to you like this this is not an hour to just be content with coming to church that's right let me just say this yes don't you let the devil tell you that you can't have the same experience i got it oh brother samuel brother samuel i'll never be like you god don't want you to be like me you're to be like jesus and i want because i want you to understand brother samuel's fire ain't my fire it's the fire of god so what you see you can be a partaker of what is dealing with your life you can be a partaker up you see you can come you can hear and you can walk away you can come here and walk away but there's got to come a time to where you say enough is enough i'm tired of being me come on now we walked around this mountain long enough it's time to cross jordan it's time to go in to the promises of god i'm telling you what we read here in first thessalonians 4 the rapture the secret coming listen friends you talking about the rest of the world wanting to know what's going on but those that have set around this message that's true and you've set and you've heard it and the word has spoken to you and said you need to repent you need to get right you need to surrender your life and you will allow reasoning to hold you back well i don't know if i can i i don't know if i could do this and i don't understand this it's not asking if you understand he's asking do you believe will you do what he that is speaking to you is asking of you is to hear his voice it ain't about what you've been what are you willing to do right now we're so close we're so close right now things we that you know we're looking around it can happen at any moment that's why i say as fathers that's why i say as husbands make sure your eyes are right because if your eyes aren't on the right thing your household won't be walking in the right thing come on friends oh brother say we're going to have pleasures of the world but if pleasures of the world are coming ahead of god you've got the wrong order in your life we need to be focused on the coming of the lord he's our joy amen he's our delight that ought to be what we look forward to if you look forward to things more than the world then you do come into the house of god you need a checkup oh friends and what an hour to have a real checkup i'm talking about the love of god this word is not do's and don'ts i have to do this oh we got to do this you're missing something you say one of my message you're missing the love of god the baptism of the holy ghost that's what you're missing but i got news for you he's here he's here he's here to deliver you he's here to set you free he's here to give you a real experience i say spirit of god move yes praise god i tell you you do what you got to do you get to him if he's to come to this altar you get to him the altar is not him but whatever you've got to do to get to him get to jesus because the one of these mornings unless you're one that has a key here there won't be no gathering and you'll be wondering where's everybody at where's everybody at cause lord knows everybody's usually here when i get here where's everybody at uh-oh and the voice comes but remember it won't be the holy spirit but it will be a voice of torment it's happened and you missed it brother samuel that scares me it shouldn't it should it ought to bring a warming to your heart amen because we don't know the day nor the hour you don't know the moment but it's to live ready so i want you to think of it how do you want him to find you when he comes because the coming of the lord is upon us you see if you really think of it we're saying i'm looking for the coming of the lord do you realize the coming of the lord he comes in your life daily he comes service after service it's a coming of the lord what's it doing it is as the promise said in revelations chapter 1 he will send waves of glory it's coming of the lord right then moving in upon the church of the living god it's a time if your focus has been is out of line it's a time to get it refocused friends you see there's got to come a time that within a life you know we speak about rededication and we should have a rededication the word of god calls us to that but i want you to be able to discern between dedication and rededication make sure you've had an original dedication with the fire of god you see this experience that god is giving to us in this hour it's not an experience that we say i can't wait to get back to church so i can repent again but this experience is a life that comes on the inside that brings deliverance it breaks the whole and the power of sin over your life so you're not walking around beat down and repenting of the same thing over and over and over you weren't made to be the tail you're ordained to be the head you were made to be the master of that and rule over it this is the day let the let the worldly image be mixed but let us be united let the worldly image be mixed well it's got worldly strength that strength of the iron behind it but it's weak the brittleness of clay think how paul would word it in second corinthians chapter four he said we preach not ourselves but christ jesus and we have this treasure in earthen clay vessels that the power may be of god and not of us oh it's something about it when the power of god comes on the inside that's the strength the lord is the strength of my life he's the strength that projects himself through this clay this clay is weak this clay gets down this clay gets discouraged this clay experienced sicknesses this clay can feel fear this clay can experience worry but that strength on the inside oh my it's a power in this hour that's able to stand there against every flood of the enemy that he would bring your way i'm talking about a hidden power in your life let me tell you something don't leave from here if you don't have that it's an hour to receive it prepare your heart it's not something you just say well i don't know if god will give it to me you might as well stay in your seat he won't do it like that but let me just give you the scripture for this is the promise unto you you repented been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ if you have it that's the commandment that's are the orders that's preparation and you shall not maybe not might but you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and them that are far off as many as the lord our god shall call don't you realize the call that's going on in your life is the holy spirit calling you to himself [Music] it's drawing you so you can stand with a real clarity and repent lay it all down and welcome his presence into your life let's pray father lord jesus your presence lord is so so sweet lord hear lord if we can say in the closing moments that we are living in lord lord god the things that we see going on around us even reports i read here in the beginning where you would speak lord through the prophet when he would speak of that in the third vision watch russia watch russia and yet the understanding of that is don't focus on russia see signs around us taking place lord things that come around the lord jesus how we can see lord just how subtle the enemy is we see lord god right in here in our own country started out lord as a lamb [Music] the lord god had had two horns [Music] civil and ecclesiastical we see where we're at lord right now lord god just receiving just even a a news clip lord from another minister here just the other day if we're in finland one of their government officials is going to prison even a minister because they tweeted out a scripture from the word of god out of the book of romans that speaks against sodomite condition [Music] and the man on the cast is that of a lawyer from texas and he said get ready that's what's coming here [Music] lord jesus we know one thing your prophet told us he said the bride will not be closed up shall be taken out now lord i'll leave that in your hands [Music] they might take our churches i don't know i know the prophet spoke of those things but i also know that the one thing that he told us to be focused on from 1954 all the way through he said the thing that i see next for the church of the living god is the rapture lord that's where we're focused now lord jesus i pray across this congregation [Music] surely lord god i do not believe that these people have come here this morning to be seen i don't believe lord god they come here lord to see me but there's a drawing lord that's going on there's a yearning lord something that's far greater than the work of man the lord i don't know what they would have need of in their life [Music] i know lord jesus if they have never met you face to face they need to meet you because this world has nothing to offer the lord god continues to get worse and worse and worse and worse there's there's no turning around for the world but for you my brother my sister this is a precious opportunity of the mercy and grace of god the bible would say to forsake your thoughts and to receive the thoughts of almighty god if i was you this morning and i was sitting here in that place in that condition this is what i would do i would cast down my reasoning i'd cast down every doubt i'd cast down every voice that is speaking contrary to the voice of god because the voice of god this morning that you have heard that's went beyond your natural hearing and that's moved down there to discern your heart that's a voice of life those other voices are voices of death voices that would want to keep you and hinder you but why don't you accept the voice of liberty the voice of freedom the voice of jubilee the voice this morning that you can be free you don't have to carry that load of sin no more you don't have to carry that lord what do i do release it unto the lord jesus christ repent let it down and say god i give my life to you i give it to you lord i surrender my life lord lord god i want the holy ghost lord jesus i want it more than anything i want every head bowed if you wouldn't mind every eye closed i wonder how many hands throughout the building hearts that would be on us say brother samuel pray for me pray for me now i'm not going to do all the praying i want you to pray with me but hearts and lives that even right now remember when you're raising your hand it's more than just your hand but a real designation because behind some of these hands there's there's the request lord i want the holy ghost i'll tell you a couple with that right there say god let my heart be prepared to receive you lord god give me the grace lord god that my heart has prepared to receive you lord i want my life o god to be on fire with you lord i want to be changed lord god oh god heavenly father [Music] lord jesus your mercy lord is right here with us lord i pray god that right there lord jesus lord upon that heart dear god may it be a real pouring out lord to you lord lord god is not just something lord jesus that we lord god or just would be just saying the lord are real pouring out of our heart lord knowing that god is your desire to fill us with the holy ghost it's your desire to change us lord it's your desire that is the heart of the message o god is to get into christ lord jesus what courage lord that your children would have to raise their hand father i know there's a blessing o god and the blessing of the holy ghost lord to move down in their life a courage lord god that would cause them to raise up and say i doubt all of my doubts i need to be born again of the spirit of god i want to be born again i want my life to be changed i've known about the message i've heard about god but i need the holy ghost oh god granny lord this morning may the lord not look for a sensation may they not look for a feeling but may lord god there not be a ceasing lord in their hearts until down on the inside there's such a satisfaction and a death to the things of the world lord god to where there's nothing of the world that's left there lord god but it's been consumed by the fire of almighty god where their life has become a sacrifice oh granted lord may they lord god just pour themselves out continue to pour themselves out or lord god as they are honest in your presence you'll move for them lord i wonder how many this morning say i've got a loved one i've got children got a wife got a husband i've got loved ones but i i desire the holy spirit to go out for to turn around they're to get their attention they'll say i mean you don't know how bad they are how bad were you you don't know how steep than sin they are but nothing's too far for jesus hallelujah he went down into that pigpen and he turned that prodigal son's heart away right around why can't we just join together right now and say holy spirit the enforcer of god god gave you those children not to be a they're they're to be a blessing to you god gave you those children they're your inheritance don't allow the enemy to tell you well then they're they're going the opposite way they'll never make it in you stand there on god's word and you claim them as part of your inheritance and let's ask the angel of the lord to deal with their heart that god would turn their heart right now heavenly father lord jesus there's husbands there's wives there's loved ones there's children right here among us lord god lord jesus we ask dear lord god that the same angel of the lord that god that has redeemed us and spoke to our lives lord that that same angel of god would go forth lord and begin to deal with those lives lord take the feathers out of the nest oh god cause the lord god to begin to look lord and to seek after you lord god oh father it might be something that they could say i need to get back in church but may it really be something lord that god you go down and deal with their heart lord in a way that god they begin to think about home lord the ways of complacency of this life lord god begins to turn lord god in their hearts lord god oh father granite lord may you move lord move upon those lives move upon those hearts lord we pray oh god bring them home lord bring them home lord jesus ready lord we pray father oh in the name of jesus christ amen oh my hallelujah could we just worship him a little bit oh my he's so good to us isn't he there's no other place i'd rather be than to be in his presence [Music] things change in the presence of god outlook changes all things doubts loser hold discouragement fades and we receive encouragement from him [Music] oh there's just something special about the presence of god to a believer david said that which i will seek after david what's your secret what's the secret to victory in this background time my desire he changed me and my desire is to dwell in the house of the lord i want to dwell in his presence i want to be in step with him i love to hear his voice i love his presence i love him [Music] david how are you facing this time my desire and i'm seeking after that hallelujah just let the holy spirit continue to move right here among us if you'd like prayer if you'd like to come to the altar pray you're more welcome but just just let's continue to just entertain him entertain him right there in your heart in your life oh my precious moments precious moments go ahead brother brian hallelujah lord jesus if you'd like to stand or if you'd like to sit whatever i just want you just just to continue to enter into his presence friends that's what's the most important it's not the position of your body right now it's just enter into the presence of almighty god just get shut away with god [Music] never let
