stand and and go to him in a word of prayer I'd ask you to um keep brother Brian holder and I think think that probably was mentioned uh in the prayer request this morning he's uh flying out has to fulfill a obligation for his job his employment and so they just had returned from Arkansas and so um not something that brother Brian wanted to do um but just ask for God will give him safe flights and uh be with him through the whole uh uh appointment that he has there with the business and things like that also ask that we would remember um my Uncle Bobby in prayer and I certainly want to say thank you for your prayers for him and uh I just had got um a text yesterday when it was here that um he he's uh you know there's been different complications at times when I was there to see him last Friday and uh he's there's certainly been a lot of improvement Within different things uh through his journey but they had to uh take him to Cleveland Clinic um they're the just on Friday and uh so theyve running different tests and uh you know there's things that just as I've just tried to be right there to encourage my aunt along the way to say you know it's a journey yes and uh you know I've stood there sometimes you don't know exactly why God the experiences we come through but I can remember as I I shared with them from the beginning and I've continued to hold to that I said when my dad could not even move his right side and there was no he couldn't speak at all there was no movement and you you you Elders you remember that that were here he could not move his right side at all and not even the framing of even mumbling he that that wasn't then it came about and so I've just I took that and I've just just continued to express to them and been right there to with with my uncle just to minister to him there at the bedside just trying to encourage him and and um just trying to minister to him with the things of the Lord and I can tell you they have been so thankful for the prayers that's right and they have asked me to thank you and my my aunt told me she said I know we would not be standing where we're standing if it was not for the prayers because things that have have we've seen I've seen things turn and you know we would like to see things a lot of times come quickly yeah we' like to see situations turn around quickly but you know the promise is they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recoverall amen time is not under our control but faith in a God who does all things well in his time God knows exactly what he's doing and I just want to just ask you I told them I would bring special prayer because you know how it is within the nursing homes and things they they lower the bed which they should they lower that bed but he had rolled out of the bed the other day and uh you know when you get sores and things like that on you're trying to get comfortable and um I just I don't mean to take up time with that but I'm asking you just to hold him in prayer and um I know we've got many other needs Among Us that are here and so good to be gathered together in it amen so good to be able to come together and take our needs and what we have on our hearts to pray amen for one another what a blessing that is amen let's just go to him in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we want to say thank you Lord for the way that's been made before us thank you Lord that you have opened up the way and you have given to us that approach Lord to you you said if we would ask the father anything in your name that you would do it Lord and father we're Lord bringing these petitions there's many needs that were spoken already this morning there's many unspoken requests Lord sometimes there's things on our hearts that if it came to try to write up on paper to put it in a text to even Lord try to articulate it in some way we fail to have the word sometimes to describe how that we feel or the circumstance but Lord we look to you who looks upon the Heart Lord and you know dear God the needs that each of us have from the spoken to the unspoken Lord you know Lord in the scriptures Lord as you have given us your word where you said cast your cares on me for I care for you Lord we believe that Lord we have found that to be the truth Lord and now Lord we bring these requests Lord from that of Lord Brother briyan as he'll be flying lord and there with the job and I know just asking for wisdom Lord just going through that whole uh uh uh process Lord that would be there Lord I pray that you would just guide and direct his footsteps may you just be with him Lord I pray God on the flights give him safe traveling mercies Lord and bringing him back to his family and to us Lord and guide him Lord and through it all dear God that his light would just continue to shine as a witness Lord to others I pray we pray Lord for my Uncle Bobby and I remember many others Lord that are in need of healing as well I think of brother Ron Spencer brother Keith Buchanan Lord sister Joy Lord I pray oh God that for each one Lord and many other requests Lord God I'm asking that you would move down in a very special way touch each one Lord as you know our needs Lord oh God it's not up to us to direct the stone that's in your hands Lord but we stand here Lord God with just to take that that little slingshot that you've given us Lord it may not look like much Lord but oh God how that prayer Lord is able to stay there Lord with faith behind it Lord and direct it Lord God to the forehead lord of the enemy Lord now father may you just move in a very special way Lord I pray for my uncle and for every one of these needs Lord may you move Among Us in a special way this morning you know every need that's here you know every physical need you know every Lord emotional need you know the spiritual needs Among Us Lord now father would you just help me to just step aside I'm only here Lord to just be a vessel that is you the great physician the great surgeon Among Us Lord oh God we only want to hand what's what you asked to be handed oh God what you would bring to our attention Lord and oh God I pray May our hearts Lord just even right now just be so seasoned with Divine love Lord move among us we pray in a special way in Jesus name amen amen God bless you amen I wonder if you'll turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 I trust you each of you had a wonderful uh time together or holiday and we certainly have we have so much to be thankful for and I'm grateful that Thanksgiving for me one of the things that I always uh do uh there's some good traditions and one thing that I always do is I I just like getting up real early that morning and listening to Invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet preached that on the me on the Thanksgiving day and he said oh what a Thanksgiving message and I I can think about that I'm so glad that my old husband's dead I'm so glad not just divorced I'm glad that he's dead and I'm glad I've been married to Christ the word aren't you oh that's a lot to be thankful for amen uh 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and we want to read a few verses of scripture um Paul says it is not expedient for me doubtless to Glory I will come to visions and Revelations of the Lord I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth for such a one caught up to the third heaven and I knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body I cannot tell God knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable Words which is not lawful for a man to utter of such a one will I Glory yet of myself I will not Glory but in mine infirmities for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fool for I say the truth but now I forbear lest any man man should think of me above that which he Seth me to be or that he heareth of me and lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice three times that it might depart from from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me now what Paul's saying he's not worshipping his weaknesses or thank God that I'm sick but what he's saying is is that now I've realized that when this has come that it's a Time To Worship the Lord even in a greater measure and I say God help us this is what Paul he says he's he came to understand that that the power the Bible says that the power of Christ May rest upon me you you realize this phrase in the scripture the power of Christ it means that the tent of his presence would set down upon my life that's what I want don't you I I I want I want that Lord that would invite his presence in the midst of that time because it's actually something that's so divinely prescribed by God therefore I take pleasure in infirmities now watch this in reproaches in necessity so Paul just didn't limit it to what when his eyesight would come and go now he's learned to recognize I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in Necessities in persecutions in distresses for Christ's sake for when I am weak then am I strong amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to if the Lord will will help us here uh once again here this morning I'd like to speak on did you do number two on the big button um I'd like to speak if the Lord would help us here on sorry it that was me that was me it was not there we go it should be coming up I'd like to speak on overcoming hindrances and this is really uh things that we've many times we've we've as we've been looking at some of this and there's many parts to it some other things that the Lord just some weeks actually when we begin on this really begin to deal with my heart one Saturday night because when you I want you to think of this as as a message Believers and I realize that we may have some new ones that would be here but it's very fitting that Paul would would Place many things in the book not only in the writing in the Corinthians but also in the Galatians and think of how that brother Brana would take uh such a key message of Christ is the mystery of God revealed which is really it's the seventh seal and he would spend he would take we would look at the amount of time that he would take he would take I just looking at it again yesterday he would take over close to 45 minutes at the beginning of that message and Express on the operation within the Church of the Living God of how that Satan would want to try to come against the church and try to bring division try to try to bring things to where we look at one another in a different way and you might we might wonder and say well why would it be that has the Holy Spirit would lead the prophet to speak within such a way through that message and you know many other messages discern discernment of spirit Discerning of the body of the Lord many of these that you see the title which are quotes that we're familiar with where it would deal with how that the church itself and in our lives would be so ordered uh of God and you know sometimes we're just we're looking at things we want to get to the heart of the matter in the sense of this is what God has called me to do God has called me to be an expression or a billboard but you see sometimes it's the things that come so subtly in our life that can actually be hindrances and the spirit of God is the one that comes by to be able to pick that up up in our life to help us to see that the desire that is burning within our hearts that God has placed there that these are things that he works to help us to uh be able to discern and then yield them over to him and I want to think look at this in this manner I've and looking at a perception and how that Paul's perception of what's taking place within his life remember he said three times I besought the Lord that God would remove this now this was not a besetting sin in Paul's life brother brandom deals what this was this was a this was an ailment this was something that would expose or bring to light where his eyes remember the Bible says you can see how I've wrote in a big hand writing and brother Bram said ever since he saw that Pillar of Fire on the road there to Damascus he said it always affected his eyes and to think that how that here Paul would God would use him so effectually as as a witness to be able to minister to so many to where that no doubt that there were many that that even we wouldn't have record of that they would actually be healed of some of the same ailments that Paul would actually suffer with in his body sometimes it's hard for us to understand that when we look at how that how many times that the prophet would no doubt pray for individuals I mean countless of times you can take on your table app and type in nervousness you can type in nervous mental oppression type in and almost every time a great deal of time within that you're going to find that there was an effect that that nervousness or that oppression actually had upon a person to cause them ulcers cause them stomach issues so something that would be in the emotional realm would actually affect this physical body because our bodies were not meant to actually experience those types of trauma and so it would be amazing how that the prophet no doubt would pray and it would he would pray under the direction of of the Angel of the Lord and how many individuals received their healing and deliverance from the very thing that the prophet dealt with and it would come in every seven years it would come in a very great way as a matter of fact it would come in such a way that brother BR would think that he was going to lose his life brother Bram tells us of how that God at one time and uniting time and sign he said of how that the Lord eventually has he spoke to him and said Don't Fear it he said now think of it he could have taken it just as easily as he told me don't fear it anymore so he God could have just taken it right from his body like he did for many other individuals but God would allow that to remain and sometimes in our minds we we we can look in such a way and our perception is that everything as far as maybe within our physical body or we have to be feeling on the mountain and man when I feel like I'm on the mountain who don't like to feel like when you're on the mountain but sometimes those are the greatest times that we're actually stronger and God's not as strong or preeminent if I can use that word in our lives as he wants to be you see it's totally contrary to the way that we think about things because his thoughts are so much higher and and sometimes we look at and we think well I you know I maybe I I'm not had such a good week or maybe you know I've had to deal with this at work and man everything was going so right and then I found out this and and then this news came and and then this and you realize some of that we think man I I got to get all this stuff out of the way so I can really serve God the way that he's called me this stuff is nothing but a bunch of junk that's in the way and the truth of the matter is that God permits those things to come about to remind us of our need of him and it brings us to a place of humbling ourselves and calling on God to say Lord I need you you so what would you say it is absolutely prescribed by God and God knowing that in our lives we would need this Divine assistance so that we in ourselves don't become a hindrance quite amazing how that Paul looked at this thing and he looked at it Lord these eyes I need to be able to write these letters what you're laying on my heart to express to the Brethren to the churches Lord Heal My Eyes Lord I I I need to be removed from these circumstances and yet actually what it was what he viewed as a hindrance was actually a prescribed Moment by God because God was bringing this to Paul for Paul to see Paul I don't want you to be a hindrance I don't want you you you're you thinking you can do something about this when you feel like that this very eyesight is a hindrance to what I've called you to do it's not it's actually a moment where my grace is sufficient and actually whether you feel it or think it my strength is actually at its greatest point in your life when you feel the very weakest but the key is is when we can surrender our weakness a lot of times the way that we sometimes are natural human ways look friends these are things we still have to deal with it's things that sometimes that we'll want to go and hide behind something or you know just try I I just man I got to get away I I just this I just that and sometimes we miss when God allows situations to show the humanity to show our need that's the time we don't want to run that's the time to make sure we're in that strong tower and say Lord I need you Lord I I Surrender Lord this weakness to you maybe it's something that comes up on the job something that comes up in the church something that comes up in the family maybe it's a sickness maybe it's a doctor's report maybe it's Financial I don't know whatever measure of which things could be used but how that God himself will so allow these things that are so contrary to our perception and we are doing everything in our manner to try to get them out of the way right isn't it amazing how the prophet will speak on tension and how that tension is actually a blessing and tell us that can you imagine if you didn't have tension in your life you'd be a ragd doll if you didn't have tension where tension itself in that of a belt you know how it is you still got belts on your cars and there's certain main Drive belts that have to be there I don't care how how luxurious the car is if the belt itself is broken the car's not going anywhere and brother brandom rescribed he says that tension to a Christian is actually always am I pleasing to my Lord that's always the question upon the heart of a Believer Lord am I pleasing you Lord am am I am I am I am I walking Lord where you want me to walk and the prophet said imagine what we would be without that tension and then he said something that you know I don't how many times I've quoted this quote read through it I I I've preached through it but you know God just has a way of saying a certain thing at a certain time and you know he said can you imagine if a marriage did not have tension in it he said how in the world would that husband and a wife you'd never have anything to work on wow that's not according to our perception but you see in order to work on something it requires submission it requires yielding and the many things that we would look at in our life the prophet would say it like this he would say it if you haven't listened to that message perfect strength through perfect weakness I I don't know how many times I you know I listen to that message but I I'll just tell you I keep on getting more and more out of it through the times don't even know when I'm going to preach out of that or whatever but if you haven't listened to it in a while just take some time don't you don't have to go through it all in one day but just take some time and really listen to that message of how that brother will deal with that aspect of it of of how that within you know even within our lives that God the very things that we would make excuses for are the very things that God will use to tackle the job but what matters is whether we hang on to our weaknesses or whether we'll submit them you know why the weaknesses God allows those weaknesses to be shown he doesn't do that in a way to degrade us he doesn't do it in a way so much to humiliate but yet there is a part of it that God wants to bring out of us a humility that will actually surrender more to him that will yield it to him in other words I don't want to make excuses for things there might be baggage that we've received and man this happened to me when I was a child and this I was ridiculed like this at school or or this was happened all those things are real no one no one is saying that those are not real but it's what we do with it friends it's what we do with weaknesses in our life maybe things the way that we are built and so forth God is not let me just tell you this right now God is not interested in trying to make every one of us exactly the same that's right real true Oneness with God is Not sameness God doesn't want you to be like somebody else God only wants to be himself inside of you and God will manifest his glory wherein we think but my weaknesses or this is showing up or this reproach or this was said and this affected my spirit or this was done and this so affected me in such a my goodness if that hadn't helped happened and sometimes we're so busy trying to oh if I would have done this if I should have done this if this wouldn't have happened if this instead of all of that it's one of those things that Satan is taking us on a detour from the real reality that God is allowing us to see our weaknesses and our need of him you realize when Moses got before the burning bush that God made known to him as his presence just dwelling there God never had to tell him this is your weakness this is your weakness this is your weakness he revealed to Moses seven weaknesses but how did he reveal those weaknesses God never called one of them out but in the presence of the Angel of the Lord Moses recognized his infirmities and his inab abilities you say why did God keep talking with him when he said I can't do this why does God keep dealing with us why does God keep dealing with us as I told him the other day Lord I don't understand why that you put up with me I don't understand that Lord I just I really can't I mean with things that I look over in my life and how that you can find God will lead us down certain Pathways of things that he'll move and deal in our life and sometimes we're so interested about I've got removing this but remember God listen to me now the prophet said in the message absolute he said God brought me here with all of these no accounts put in me so he could dig it out of me now God doesn't send an excavator down and say hey everybody get off the site no that's not how God digs it out God digs it out as we yield to him and then he said okay I'll bring my back ho down in there right now and I'll begin to move down you see I'm so glad that he digs it out you know what he really does it isn't that all of a sudden those weaknesses are gone from our life but God digging it out is where we can realize that Lord I want it self to be emptied up because the prophet said God takes those weaknesses as they're yielded to him and he pours himself in and uses himself they are opportunities for for God to display himself what a perception totally contrary to the way that I think it's contrary to the way that you think and I can tell you this right now that even after this service is over there's things within it God speaking to the moment to the season not only we're in or what we would be coming to but I can tell you right now that this is something I pray that will so resolve in our hearts and the Holy Spirit would just be present to bring it back back to us when we come into situations Necessities reproaches infirmities that to bring it back to us Lord I want to just yield right now I want to yield to you because remember every time anything takes place God's not asking you and I to become like robots to where all of a sudden we know what's going on that's not what God's trying to do but if we can just say Lord for this moment see what God's trying to do is build us for this moment and when he builds us for this moment he's preparing us for the next moment and then within that it comes to that place of prayer you know there's certain things that you know over through time that I I don't know about you but I'm sure everybody can there's things that I have God has spoken and things the where that it's helped my life in such a way that it's things that I've never forgotten about and then yet there's other things that won't seem to be in the Forefront of my mind but in in the midst of a situation sometimes of things to where that when I'm looking to the Lord and calling out to the Lord you know sometimes it's days will go by sometimes maybe a week will go by and then all of a sudden he'll bring to remembrance a certain quote that the prophet of God has said a certain scripture he'll bring you say why couldn't he have brought that before well I I you know I'm not going to put it all on God but you know there is an element to it that the Bible said that that experience it brings hope it says tribulation worketh patience and patience is endurance is that right and through that it brings out experience and experience hope hope in other words that in this situation I am trusting God to Stand and Deliver Me and move upon this situation I don't know how I don't need to know how I don't need to know the next step of the way many times we in our Humanity want everything explained out Lord I'd like to see everything from start to finish like that of a vision if God wanted to do it that way he'll do it that way if he sees that it would be beneficiary not to you but to his kingdom in our lives but sometimes God being a faithful parent he knows exactly how much to give us and then he's trying to build and mold and shape because God is term determined in his heart that he's going to have mature Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah that's what I want to be don't you yes sir you know it would seem so incredible of how that God would Place such a treasure as the holy spirit in in an earth and vessel it doesn't seem fitting I mean it would be like you taking the greatest picture picture you know and putting it in some old tattered frame that just maybe it's falling apart maybe you've got like duct tape on it and you've got such a picture maybe it's the picture on the road to emus maybe it's the picture the Hoffman's head of Christ and the only thing that you would have is a frame that might be held together with glue some duct tape and everything else you would look at that and say that frame is not fitting for the picture of my Lord let me tell you friends that frame is a lot better than what our humanity is within our Humanity there's things that on my duct tape would look like would look like dokin seats on a Cadillac I mean the way the glue would be on that picture frame but God knows he chose us when knowing all of that would be there why so it would bring us to a place God knows that you and I would have such a need in our life because still in this flesh even after the New Birth has come we will deal with pride remember how the fall came about where Eve she fell under the midst of Temptation to the enemy and how that she fail remember lust of the eye lust of Flesh and pride of life it was wanting to bring something out of her and you know that's remember the prophet tells us indoors IND door that's one some of the first places that where Satan will move he'll take maybe a new convert or a new life and how Satan will come in right there upon that door of Salvation and he's standing right there on the welcome M but remember he wants to be Lord of the entire Temple but he'll not force his way in but remember he'll stand right there remember Jesus will take what we give him but brother Ram say how he says that that first little door that we have to deal with is that little door called Pride brother brand would refer to that Pride as little pinned up black Devils called Pride little things things such as you know that would enter into the and then desire for Prestige the desire to fit in the desire to be accepted above friends let me just tell you if you if what you have as friends require you to act like them they aren't friends I'll just tell you that flat out they're using you like a knife on a stick of butter that's not friends but real friends whether you agree with them or not they are friends is that right if there's things that you have to do think of this friends it will never be when we look at all of this how that Satan will use these things in such a way to try to ens snare someone but oh if it could be such a glimpse and a view of the king of glory who laid aside such Splendor and we could ask him how did you feel leaving the ramp parts of Glory to lay aside that of that of your godship and come down in that of humanity you left that of the myriads of angels and you came down to subject yourself to take upon a body of Flesh off humiliation to walk in this way to be ridiculed to have things set against you to be called a drunken soldier's child to have all of these black marks placed upon your name if we could ask him how do you feel he would say it has been worth it it is worth it because why he did not come for his own self he came to be a blessing and to bring the blessing to you and I he came he laid aside Splendor he did something that no devil could ever do he laid aside his Splendor and adorned himself with such humility that he might win our hearts to him oh God let us get such a glimpse of that if if you not pray if you've not got a glimpse of the love of God that came down and paid a price for you and sent back the Holy Ghost to let you know and knock on your door I love you may God give you such a revelation of Calvary to see what he has done for you what a perception what a perception yes what was looked at in defeat was not defeat but the Bible said he was crucified in weakness but he liveth by the power of God hallelujah he submitted himself listen the last parts of Jesus third pole Ministry was not displays right it was humility that's right behind closed doors ging himself I think that that scripture is so powerful to me look how scripture is placed there's no coincidence Jesus the Bible says in the Book of John knowing that he come from God and going back from God very next scripture he dorned himself with a towel that's soj and begin to wash the feet of his disciples you see what real I wonder if real realization of our son ship has not been placed out here in some realm of like Aza Street Pentecost where it's going to have some massive expression of divine gifts it's not no amen the gifts are needed right but the gifts remember the gifts God has placed the gifts in their place when you come in my house you don't trip over pots and pans those are Bridal gifts are you hearing me now but they're not in storage we use them right right we use them we get them out as we need them but they're not on display so every time you come over we feel like we've got to display tongues I mean got to display the stock pot in order to somehow convince you oh my we don't have to do that but you know what sometimes through those very things a meal can be served and things done and you don't even know what pots been used right right you see the majority of the gifts are not even right here on display and brother bam actually says when they operate within Perfection will meet in the back room that's good that's right that's very it's very right that's very true but you see the thing about it is it's something about us the way that we look at things and God I tell you the that's why I'm saying for God to deal and work with me I don't know may maybe the rest of you don't feel this way but I I feel this way Lord through your patience and longsuffering for my life how you work with me and my perceptions sometimes have been so wrong I am so glad that he has been so patient with me and he would work with me and say Samuel you know what you've had the wrong perception but he did not look how God moved he did not somehow try to convince me or bring me to his side he just LED he just manifested himself he just kept leading and he kept dealing with my life until I come to a place and say oh Lord my what I thought is not what you thought at all and you know what and then God can step back and say now you're seeing it like I'm seeing it son but you see all of that of seeing things God wants his word to come down in such a way so that we do not become puffed up in our heads because you know there's such a vast difference we need knowledge is that right we we need knowledge but remember what we need we need Holy Ghost knowledge we need spiritual revealed truth we need God to reveal things to us we we need them I I need I want more of God like we were pray we were ministering the last time we were together we want to keep seeking more and more for God not just because oh we want to do this but to realize staying humble before God is staying in prayer staying with a Reliance on him that's one of the simplest of ways that we stay within humility is that all right now notice within this here there's many different points and parts and we'll just see how the Lord would what he would allow us to be able to get to here even this morning but I want you to just to think of it here within this manner because the prophet would speak about in these things of there's a reason why we come to church now you you know many times this message Believers you hear Brother Ram say this particular phrase in many different messages he'll say it and how can I overcome but he'll says it right here in perfect strength by Perfect weakness and I ask you just a moment of why do you come to church why do I come to church what's the reason what's the purpose behind it well I I would definitely say that we come to be fed is that right but you see even feeding itself feeding itself there's also another part to it when the prophet of God would tell us in Christ the mystery he says he says if your heart does not burn to get in here when the church doors are open he said it's time for you that you got to praying to do what get in here and fellowship with your brothers and sisters now this is a certain realm or a part of Fellowship that we have here that as we'll come together and we're fellowshipping one with the other now listen if it was just all about us you or me or whatever more I could just say you know what I don't need y'all I can just look in a computer screen and I can just preach to all of you but I'll tell you what I've done that before God was gracious to us when we had to do that but what good would that do you see there's something about it to be able to feel that that pull as it's coming and needs are coming together and you know what it is it isn't just about you or it isn't about me when we come to a meeting and we come together it's not so much just about us alone but as we'll begin to pull on the gift of almighty God it's kind of like this if you had a certain dish at Thanksgiving you liked like for me I love sweet potato casserole not anybody's I like my wife's she says it's more like dessert but I like it with a pumpkin in it the sweet and condensed milk two two two two in part of that time the topping on the top I'm not trying to make your mouth water but I'm just saying this to you that you know what if that's something that I have I desire and say man I cannot wait for Thanksgiving I mean forget the turkey forget everything else let me to the sweet potato casserole guess what you may not have asked for sweet potato casserole but you being in my house and she puts on that at down the table now if you like sweet potatoes or youve never tried it guess what you're going to be benefited because I have asked for that that's right and that's the same way when we come to the house of God don't let it become something in our mind our perception that it's just oh I've come to feed and we're just like you know getting our own little stall and we're just feeding that way no it's something to wear together that the Holy Spirit begins to flow throughout the body there are needs and as we're pulling on God there are things that maybe a brother or sister does not even feel like they can lift up their head but in the presence of God when the Eagles of God begin to feed oh more there is the godhead bodily being assembled and needs are being met lives are being changed Deliverance is coming faith is being lifted I am My Brother's Keeper Hallelujah I am I am cuz you know what I'm not going in this rapture Everybody by myself you're going with me and you know what you ain't going by yourself without me you might look and say brother Samuel come on man you need to get with the program maybe God's letting you see things in me that need to get with the program for you to be able to pray in humility say God help my brother you know why and it ain't so much allog together just me alone but it's God allowing things to get out of your life as well remember it isn't always about I can just get all this out of the way I'll be the absolute Apex perfect Christian I think our perception of what we perceive that to be is totally not what God perceives it to [Music] be I say God help us am so the reason we want to come to church is on right if I just read this now watch this brother BR says it like this he says there's little things that we do that's what we come to church for is to find out where our faults is and the things that we might better ourselves by how many of you like to go sit down with the boss and the boss you know on that review now every one of us will like sitting down with the boss interview say I tell you what you everything man you you do everything just right right now listen our flesh would like that we we you know depending on how we're made up sometimes affirming words and things like that depending on how we're made up but yet there's a part of it that we also know there's areas there's some areas I need to grow in I may not know what they are but you see if there's a boss that's above us that really cares about us then it's going to point out of ways that things could actually improve and sometimes those things when they come out that way woo they sting at first right they sting let's just be honest friends they sting at first but you know what it's what we do with them oh sometimes they'll smart a little bit my man it stings oh my goodness you talk to your wife about it talk to your husband can you believe can you you see this is where the balance of things that we don't want the prophet of God even talked about this in what was surround him he said we don't want a bunch of Yes Men right we want real Real Men of God we also want that I want I want God to be honest with me don't you this Rapture means everything this Rapture means everything to me I I want to be where he's at as a matter of fact everywhere he's at in the word that's where I want to be right now I don't want to be left behind I want to be where he's at in press and truth that's where I want to be and because of that desire I want to be listen I don't want to miss out on nothing that he's doing I Want to Be Right a part of what he's doing now it may not be what my part I might think but I know he's got a part in it for me and whatever it is whether it's something on the front or something behind the scenes No matter what it is Lord I just want to be a help to what you are Desiring to do in this hour now think about this he says if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church but we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that's strong Now find out our weaknesses that's these are things that this has really requires a real courage of a child of God this is where a lot of testing comes in of in our lives of how God will work with our lives and deal with our lives and it's also our perception on it listen friends God is not God is not here ridiculing us and I want you to understand this maybe your concept of the message has just been Conformity out here you can be ever so conformed out here and you miss the Rapture but if you're conformed in here it'll reflect out here are you hearing me it'll reflect all the way through because whatever God does within it'll show itself on the on the outside but you see if it only is perceived as just putting on a new coat we don't need a new coat we need a new man in the coat that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do it comes to change our very nature it gives us strength so that it's not us conforming but it's yielding and being transformed by the renewing of our minds say Lord if you find yourself look look friends if you find yourself with any little bit of resistance to the word of God well this was applied this way or this was applied that way listen just lay aside all vessels and look straight at the word of God and if the word of God if this is what it's laid out say Lord remedy everything within me to match the very word of God and the character the heart of it Lord God let it be so formed in the depths of my life now watch this brother brand would make this statement how many ever heard of this term high horse I mean it's a it's a common term you know that's that's used and I think it's still used today but you know when we look at this of what a high horse would be it' be like that of of pride of arrogance there's a lot of different ways in which that this very thing would mean and it would be something this of a high horse would be something to where that owners and different ones of Estates and so forth they would show their prestige or who they were by riding on a horse so that they were able to look down upon their subjects wow they put themsel they put themselves in a position to be able to look down on others and so they would they would this is what the whole this is where a high horse actually comes from it comes from that the parts of you know Masters and servants and other things like that but you know sometimes it could even be to where as when I was doing the studies on it to where somebody would make sure that they had a more brilliant horse one that would be maybe a little bit larger a little bit bigger to where that they still had the upper as it were Echelon to be able to somehow have at least an angle to look down now let me read what the prophet says here in perfect strength he's asking that God would help us as a people to be able to understand these things God I hope that this gets down deep to us when brother brand preaches this message he includes himself you hear me when brother BR preaches perfect strength he includes himself he realizes for the furtherance of the ministry that's coming on of that third pull he says I need more of a killing of William brandom more of an emptying up notice he says both here in the tape world that you realize you've got to become nothing not a know- it all not a great somebody but a nobody got to come to dust you've got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing true and don't ever rise above it for as soon as you rise above it you rise above God let me ask you the question that that second paragraph when he says don't never rise above it when I read that that shows the possibility that still lays there in our Humanity right you've notice you've got to keep yourself in the dust and on the road to Damascus you've got to keep yourself off your high horses ain't it incredible he didn't he wasn't saying in this message now he deals with the new birth of Us coming to a place to know that we're nothing that surrender through all of our efforts through all of our try to finally come to a place of surrender full surrender that the spirit of God can move in and bring about a real Divine change in our life but that no we are nothing staying in the dust listen the new birth is there to equip us with that reality that without me you can do nothing but remember keeping ourselves in the dust right does not mean walking around oh I'm nothing I can't do nothing right I can't do anything right that's good preach that's not surrendering no our weakness if you can receive it in that way it's actually Pride cuz none of us likes our weaknesses to be exposed that's right none of us likes our weaknesses to be talked about you take a husband and wife that'll sit down and we begin to sit down sometimes things will will arise that allows us to be able to talk with one another I'm not talking about getting out of chalkboard and ripping somebody down and pointing out this and this and this let me tell you something we both both as husband and wife are flawed human beings and we both need the grace of almighty God but notice this high horse that would be here it's evident remember when Elijah was taken beyond the curtain of time or when he moved from one dimension into the other remember even how brother Brandon would ALS also would also speak of that and referring it into the scriptures when he was caught up there there when the Jordan was split and here he was he was caught up and he was raptured and Elisha saw it and he threw back the same garment there of The Same Spirit upon Elisha brother Braham says there was horses that was gathered in the bushes and he said when it came time for Elijah to go God loosened those there was the host or the myriads of angels thousands upon thousands upon thousands and here Elijah slips into that place and the Chariot moves down and here the very power that's needed when you think of horses think of power they are beast of power and they were loosened for that moment to carry him from one dimension to another they serve their purpose but yet after the New Birth is come in our lives God does not strip away the high horses they're still tied up right here hallelujah that's good yeah and we've got to keep ourselves off of them the difficulty within that is we're talking about a spiritual spiritual thing we're not talking about a natural thing remember the prophet of God when he preaches the seals and he stands up there and he preaches there and he's dealing with the first seal remember he's taken a stab at it throughout some of the other places drawing from other men's conclusions is that right he did the best that he could at that point in time but you see it was an urgency that was moving in that hour there was an urgency why this was the season for the seals to come open but it just wasn't the junction or the moment of time but seeing the burden of the hour even as the prophet would begin to look into those things and yet he would call that white horse rider the Holy Ghost but you see when the spirit of God came to the place to open it up to what it was what seemed so innocent that's good there was one detail that was left out yeah that's right there was no arrow in his bowl that's right the other detail as it was left out it was not coming to conquer for Christ it was coming to conquer the people and lead them away from the victory that God had brought down to earth through Calvary and through innocency it was Leading the People in a ride on a beast of power Hallelujah it was leading them from their humility from the Purity just doing it as on a ride coming in very innocent listen friends when I look at the seals I don't look at the seals as Doctrine it is Doctrine there is an event of what Satan it exposes what Satan's attempted Destruction has tried to do and come against the Church of the Living God all the way down through it reveals also our place it reveals our name reveals our position but look friends I don't just look at the white horse rider even anybody there has been men that could have taught and have taught these things and the white horse rider is the Antichrist Spirit and the black horse rider is the is you know death and and you know the r red horse rider church and state coming together we don't need that kind of knowledge alone we need the Divine application of discernment by the spirit to discern Satan's attempted ride in our own lives in our own homes in our church we need the discernment of the Holy Spirit to take the cover off of him let me tell you brother brandham does not have to come back and preach the trail of the serpent it has already been laid [Applause] out and I want to remind you this thing that we comb his hair if you've got it feed it take care of it baby it pamper it I want to remind you this is the Serpent's meat uhuh book of Isaiah serpents meat right here this is what Satan likes to come and try to anoint you know what he wants to try to do pull us out into these Realms anybody ever felt anxious before maybe I'm just the only one remember there's a few other people agree with me but at that point you know in that feeling anxious wait a minute that ain't the spirit of God making me feel that way right there can be a seriousness of the moment like let's say if we're sitting in the house of God but the spirit of God will never produce anxiousness that'll be the enemy trying to get in there like let's say God calling upon a life God dealing with the heart right here in service and here he is the gentleness and the sweetness the wooing of the Holy Spirit to bring us to a place of open up to yield our weaknesses to him not walk away closed but say Lord Lord God strip it all out of me dig it out of me Lord God so you can pour yourself in I realize Lord that this in itself it's not so much of a hindrance but it is a prescribed moment for you to come and move down in my life but Satan will try to slip up and bring anxiousness but the dove of the holy spirit is always with sweetness and tenderness to bring about a real release in our life places where we can put our feet spiritually but even in our lives when we have felt anxiousness in other places remember when the maniac Came Upon the platform and the prophet is standing right there he was temp tempted to be pulled out into another realm he even had people around him that was trying to pull him out of another realm the policeman good men I I thank God for the policemen but here they were they were coming they were getting ready to lay hands on that man to tell you the truth they have shredded he' a shredded every one of them policemen why cuz he was anointed there was a devil that was there upon him who knows what would have taken place on that platform maybe he would have ended up dead I don't know maybe others would have ended up dead do you just in that moment the right thing to doen when the prophet yielded he said he be to thank different thoughts concerning that man and that allowed the Holy Spirit to move down amen High horses were tied he could have got on them Hallelujah and we would have read a different story right listen friends all of the spirits and things that we have out here you better be careful who you're beeping at when you're riding down the road there's enough people that's on enough stuff and it's not even dope that's out there it's stuff that's prescribed through doctors and everything else and even when you lay all that aside there's enough things where individuals even have listen they're tormented and we're at the end time this is why this is where it's at it's not going to get any better the prophet tells us in Jubilee year 1954 it's not going to get any better it's only going to get worse God help us to stay off our high horses let's look at this high horse just for a moment here subtleness of it something that could happen so easily of things that we could have in our lives that God has done for us remember Brother Brad would tell us healing salvation he'll go through many things he said it will hold out as long as your faith holds out right everybody with me still right brother BR then takes us into perfect perfect Faith now remember perfect faith cannot operate when anything in that channel is not right whether it's unconfessed sin or it's Pride anything gets in the way it starts weakening faith brother Ram tells us even complaining weakens Faith now watch this here is a situation of a sister here she is standing before the prophet said yes lady you're standing before me you're a Christian you're suffering with the blood pressure you're real nervous you got gallbladder trouble nervous upset brings her to a blood pressure and there's something strange about you you've accepted your healing once before on the same thing but you got too Hottie with it wow and it got away wow the very thing that she had in her possession she got too Hottie with it now brother Rand doesn't go on to say as far as how was it that she was acting I don't know was she testifying in a way to where it was lifting her faith up to where as though she had such great faith I don't know maybe it was at even at a coffee shop or at other places and it got to somehow some way it was in place to where that God could no longer abide in that same place and you know what it did it invited those same things that she had been free from it invited him to come right back into her life gallbladder trouble blood pressure why she got too hotti with it was it that she got careless in her life and in her walk with God was it that she just got to thinking was it she just got to thinking are you with me was it that she just got to thinking how many times we going to pray for so and so about gallbladder trouble God healed me where's their faith at I don't know the prophet doesn't go on and say but he just says you got too hoty with it brother random talks about out in the trailer park power transformation talks about the little sister sitting there in the wheelchair he said we prayed for her time and time again why that God has not healed her I don't know why but brother Bram goes into another part in the message this day the scripture is fulfilled not the long one the short one right after the event happens in Arizona and he talks about how the people got together in that trailer park and you know what what was looked at as a place they could have looked and said God why don't you heal her I don't understand why you're doing this but brother Brown tells us he said the people got together and they made her home conducive for a wheelchair oh wow ramp the door being widen we would look at that God raise her up what a witness she'll be but God said through this situation I'm not trying to interpret it but look what happened God's love would just was displayed in maybe not seeming to be such a spiritual way but it was a care for her well-being it wasn't just people standing at the altar and praying oh God healer oh God healer oh God healer they knew he was a Healer that's so so good but they took it upon themselves out of love Hallelujah to make her Dwelling Place accessible to her now I don't have to ask you our Humanity the way that we think of glorifying God is so far contrary oh yes to what we think and God does it in such a way to ensure he's not going to share his glory with nobody that's why he's placed his glory in this earn frail vessel that's like a clay pot that if you're not careful and you don't set it down just right if it's too cold and you bring it inside suddenly in the hot it's liable to crack it's liable to break you got to handle it with care well who is it that handles us with care CU we sure don't do very good on our own right sometimes the way we handle our attitude handle our emotions handle everything we don't do too good friends but aren't you glad that there is one on the inside of us that like when God told Joshua do not be afraid or dismayed dismayed don't be shattered in a bunch of pieces aren't you glad that there's one who holds us together oh yes when we feel like we're in a million pieces that is so good and we wonder oh God I I want to be stronger God said no no no you're too strong you're getting to a place you're getting there you're getting there oh God I just Lord take it out and take this away from me Lord I you know this thing Lord I I seem like this this area and this part and maybe my respond here or this this was said to me oh God just remove this boss Lord oh God put powdered sugar all over my wife Lord God oh Father dust my husband with honey Lord but God permits these things for one purpose hallu that we would surrender our weaknesses and see our weaknesses let me tell you something it takes a real son and daughter of God to be able to stand in the mirror of God's word and hear what the word is saying and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word anybody can look at the word as long as we're being pattern on the back and listen to me there are services and times that God he works in such a way how sometimes that he'll move over here and this way and other times man you you're swinging so high up in the ramp parts of glory and other times you're just pulling up your toes and your shoes with man I don't want to be on the Flames God has a way of even bringing the church and he swing back and forth why he keeps us in a place of humility not of wondering not of tore up don't misunderstand me God doesn't keep us tore up but he keeps us in a place of looking to him amen but how was it that this little sister got too Hotty I I don't know but I just pray Lord help us because whatever it was whether it was something she said whether it was a way she started to carry herself whether it was a way that she started to do I don't know but somewhere along the line it became a welcome mat for those same Spirits gallbladder blood pressure other things to come right back I don't want no welcome at on those things now watch the prescription watch what the prophet tells her her husband's already passed on to be with the Lord and watch what he tells her he says sister now you go on your road rejoicing and saying and the sister says I had doubts about my healing and I lost it now go watch this be humble and sweet and Jesus will be with you amen she lost it by getting too hotti and now here's the prescription be humble be sweet and Jesus will be with youall that's what we want Lord Lord I want him to be with us God help us that in these parts there's other places that we could go with this here this morning I just I'm just going to pull up right here but these high horses that are still tied right in here just because they're tied there and every once in a while oh every one of us have Rotom every once in a while the thing of it is is when you get up there on the high horse it's kind of hard to get down yeah yeah yeah yeah because a lot of times you had to climb a ladder to get up there and you get up there into where it's everything and we're just looking down on everything else you know there is a place that God does lift you and I but it's not on high horse on the wings of an eagle and when he lifts us on the wings of an eagle oh it's true we can see things but you know what we're seeing we're not looking down on somebody else but on the wings of the eagle we can begin to see things like it is when you zoom in in and out on your Maps Google Maps whatever you use Apple Maps Google Earth any of those things and you can zoom right in and you can move right down the road take 3d pictures and you can see what what the address what the house looks like business looks like you can move right down you can zoom out and see all the different directions of the parking how traffic comes off should I get off at this exit ramp and travel here should I you you can see all of that why from The View up there but notice what that view is all about that Eagle View is not about looking down yeah it's about looking to the answer looking to our destination are you hearing me that's good looking to the end that is so good say God help us am many other ways of this subtleness of these high horses but you know what it's kind of like that little black dog in our life I want these high horses to be starved to death would it not be no Marvel if when God gave you the Holy Ghost he totally done away with every high horse but instead he said they're just going to stay tied up right there in your flesh and it'll be a testimony syvia is that you God bless you good to have you Lord have mercy God allows them high horses to be tied up in our flesh right that his glory might be made manifest but you know what if you ever get on a high horse and we have God will give us Grace to get off of it but a lot of times coming off a high horse it won't be pumpkin pie apple pie it'll be humble pie and God does it in such a way you know why he does that because part of that humility sometimes the ways of things of getting up there on that high horse God has to allow the situations not to to be so nice and sweet and coming back down but God does things in order to teach us and shape us and mold us don't you love him Lord thank you for the right perception kind of makes you look at your weaknesses a whole lot different doesn't it it doesn't make us make excuses for him we don't want to do that we want to yield un to him when we come into His presence and we can see certain things listen Satan would love nothing more than to get you isolated from the rest of the body get you if he can get you look he can get you isolated he can just start waylaying on you he can just start waylaying and get you down and everything else you know how it is why he's trying to weaken you and now for us what if we see our brother our sister in need don't get on your high horse but come wrapped in humility and say Hey Brother Hey sister praying for you right I love you see sometimes we can look we not we're not careful these high horses are so subtle we can climb up on the high horse and say well if they would have done this if they would have done this if they would do this if they and we're not careful listen friends we understand there's times where even in our own life where there has to be correction but you know what God hadn't asked me or you to be the enforcer restoration of the brid tree the holy spirit is the enforcer to God's word and the whole thing that the prophet said if you need your healing if you need the Holy Ghost if and he lays out a whole bunch of needs he said just yield and let him take you there hallah amen this is where I stand cuz there ain't none of us have a right to get on our high horse if we really start looking at weaknesses and faults of one another we're all in trouble we're all in trouble well that isn't making us a little group you know that sits around with folding chairs and sings Kumbaya and we'll never be any better people that's not what I'm talking about it's every one of us individually recognizing our need of almighty God and as he deals with our life as weaknesses are made known don't pull back from him but say God Amen help me Lord even be this honest with him and say help me to surrender in the Right Way Beyond Lord I might think I'm surrendering but God help me let my heart match what you're calling for you allowed this Lord to show up something that maybe something that I seen where why did this brother go astray why did this sister go astray sometimes God allows those things to happen that we might be tested whether or not we'll climb on our high horse or whether we'll go in humility see sometimes remember our perception on things is we've got to get everything just right in the church we've got to we've got to iron it all out if that was possible denominations would have been a success it's not a man that can iron out a people it's the power of almighty God I have Got Confidence as the scripture says not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord we don't need to manufacture anything we just need to let the Holy Spirit say Lord if my part you know how it is when you got two hoses together sometimes to get out certain things around my shed I've got two hoses each of them 50t in length and sometimes to get out there and water my plants around the shed and when we had a garden I had to get a thing in order to join those hoses together your part my part god might call you call me and he has and he will in some instances to join things together and place Us in places to say will you stand in the breach will you stand in the Gap will you make up the Hedge will you stand there on behalf of your brother but they're wrong Lord but I want to know are you going to get on your high horse or you going to stand in the Gap what are you going to do I said Lord hallu the only thing I want to nourish is I want to nourish if I can say it this way that horse that Beast of power that came and changed my nature like Rebecca I want to water it I want to water it I don't want to water them high horses it's amazing how them high horses still there I don't want to water them Brother Carlos I don't want to water them they can still be tied up but greater is he that is in me than those High horses better are tied up let's pray Lord Jesus may you Lord I pray the words that you've delivered Lord to our hearts this morning Father I'm asking you Lord right here for my own life and for the life of this assembly for every brother every sister those that would be here those that would be streaming those that would archive it everyone that would look at it Lord as their home assembly I'm asking you Lord help us father Lord sometimes lord it's like when we you can hear those horses sometimes and they'll make those snor in sounds and they're standing around many times we've been down there in Amish Country and walk through different barns or even sometimes down the sidewalk and you just kind of hear them they kind of Click their their uh Hoopes where they've been Shaw and you can hear it on the pavement sometimes you can hear that snort whatever we say it is that they're doing Lord in various settings in times Lord of weakness necessities reproaches I can hear them Lord father on behalf of myself and behalf of every one of us in here I pray heavenly father that you would forgive us Lord I know Lord that no doubt Lord as we've sat here individually in our lives we've went through times and things where we've you brought us to be able to come to that realization Lord forgive me forgive me Lord for getting up that high horse but Lord our desire now that you've helped us to see you've not taken the high horses away yet in one sense when the New Birth has come you have delivered us from the ruling power that was in our life Lord the reality is we didn't need a new devotional we didn't need a lot of other things that we thought we needed what we needed was a new Administration I thank Lord when this Earth as it's going through its stages of redemption [Music] in that time lord god of the Millennium when this Earth will fall under the administration of the son of David the Bible says that the knowledge of the Lord will fill the land the Sea and the sky it'll be a new Administration the old Administration is done away with Lord I pray here this morning if there's one that doesn't know you in that way for the things that Lord that you have spoken and ministered to our hearts you're not requiring and asking us to somehow conform Our Lives you're not laying down better steps on how to be a better person that's not it but Lord you're speaking to Sons and Daughters of God reminding us of our position calling Hearts to the realization of whether or not they have received the necessary change of administration or so much so to we that when things would arise within their lives this is where the Prophet speaks of such a difference between he says sometimes and he said it multiple messages he said I've wondered why is there sometimes there's people that are up here on the housetop and then they're down in the valley now he wasn't talking about going through things but he's saying sometimes here they are man they're a Christian today and then they're you know just out just wondering the next day he said what is it that would be difference cuz you meet some people and they're like on the they're on the housetop seemingly every day maybe they're not all together when we look at it and say ma they must not have anything going on their life no it's they have a hidden source of joy in their life by a new Administration to where when Gloom would surround us the lights of the Stars would grow dim the lights of the candlesticks would be blown out as though in our spirit things would become clouded but we have a different Administration in our lives we have a strength within the joy of the Lord to know that we have passed from Death unto life Lord I pray this morning if there would be one that would be here under the sound of my voice Lord that would be able to say in that way Lord I Surrender my weakness I Surrender Lord my first birth Lord I've tried I've made many attempts but Lord I realize I need a different Administration in my life Lord I don't need mental exercises Lord I need divine revelation oh God let me seek Calvary in full view Lord let there come Lord a real Administration by the baptism of the Holy Ghost into my life that'll give me power to subdue my enemy granted Lord I pray that you would help us help every one of us that are gathered here Lord father you've helped us to see in these things this morning how subtle like that little sister or something what she had received a divine blessing of the Lord and she'd got too hotty with it Lord I would say if there's any divine blessing that we could receive from you may we remember that we've received it we didn't earn it we didn't Merit it but we've received it from you may we worship you in it Lord maybe Lord as we looked at it with that sister there might have been other sisters Lord maybe she couldn't understand why prayer was being offered up and here they weren't being healed of gallbladder trouble they weren't being healed of this and healed of that but Lord you know what I'm grateful for and help us to remember [Music] it I don't know why I don't know why I don't understand why Lord there's others that you've moved down and you have taken cancer completely from their body and while there were others that were in positions as mothers a young mother a [Music] father and you would take them they received their healing but they just didn't receive it on this side Lord God this is where I Trust You Lord I don't question you I trust you but help us to stay off of our high horses help us Lord we all need of your grace we might hear the clicking of that hoof on the ground we might hear the snort of that horse trying to Allure us to mount that high horse God help us realizing that even in your great providential wisdom you allow situations to take place to test us how we'll respond how we will act help us Lord Lord I believe I can speak for every one of us Lord we want to conduct ourselves Hallelujah as Sons and Daughters of God I just want to nourish that great Beast of power the Holy Ghost oh Jesus you rote into our lives as the mighty [Music] conqueror And We Worship You Lord there's no situation there's no circumstance nothing is too great for you Lord forgive me Lord I don't say it lightly but God forgive us this is our heart's cry Lord help us to be sensitive help us to wait on you help us to look to you give us Grace Lord give us discernment of spirit lest we mount on high horses I don't want to mount on high horses there's another promise that says Lord [Music] God we shall Mount up on the wings of an eagle oh God that's how I want to mount up Lord I don't want to be mounted up [Music] Lord on high horses let me be carried on the wings of an eagle let this Dove leading Eagle Lord God let it carry us Lord oh granted Lord I pray help us [Music] Lord oh thank you Lord Jesus aren't you love [Music] him oh man oh can just worship him just thank him for his goodness like the Holy Spirit would talk to us last week let it be just a moment

hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah you know that little sister that we referred to today I want you just to think about that for a minute of how that God could have just looked down on her and said stay that way you became hottie I healed you once I delivered you but aren't you glad some weeks ago as we were ministering on this brother BR says I'm glad he's not hottie to where he would go down he he talks about Rosella Griffin God came down in that meeting and delivered her of her need aren't you glad that he doesn't come down and he could get on his high horse but you know what Pride don't belong to God we looked at it the other time I don't know if it was the last time we were together or whatever more but there's a certain element of certain things of of of with pride that we can look at that we know did not come from God but instead God would write in in such humility and such Authority and so take over in that situation I'm glad that he came to me like that because what I read here of this little sister every one of us could put our name right there no matter what the situation has been somewhere along the line now you know what as I sit right here and the Lord would take us through that what was it what was that part of hottie that she got I don't know you know as the Lord was just bringing that today he's just fitting those things to our life but you know what it was more important than to have some certain thing of she did this or she did this she that you know what's more important is to realize how to keep it away that's what's more important stay sweet and humble and Jesus will be with you that's what's more important you see when God deals with us on these things it isn't that he's asking us somehow to just oh if I could just muster up enough strength no that's the problem our strength our strength we need his [Music] strength but his strength it manifests itself remember with Aaron's Rod it was dead but when he got in the presence of the Lord it budded blossomed and bore almonds where in his presence that's the key cuz we could go out of here and listen brother BR would say it many different times when he would come to the end of the Statue of a perfect man and he said I raised both of my hands before this congregation and I pledge myself before God and this congregation that I will not cease until I see every one of these virtues flowing freely through my life and pledges are wonderful things and he'll draw us to that place you know in our lives it's a wonderful thing for us to say Lord I need to be closer and I want to be closer that's a wonderful things friends don't ever despise that it's it's a wonderful thing but you know what the where all that comes about where those pledges can become reality is just simply entertaining his presence like when Abraham when they came to his tent door Abraham said sit down right here we're we're going to go get something for you right it's like you go over to somebody's house I could walk into your house and you say Hey Brother Sammy don't don't run away come sit down here you can have my chair you want something to drink want some coffee you want a piece of apple pie now you're talking my language you know what you're trying to do you're trying to entertain me yes you know what it is maybe there's a just you just you're thankful to see somebody maybe it didn't so necessarily me but you're just glad to see somebody and you say hey sit down you see the whole the whole thing is is to entertain him and Satan knows if we entertain the angel of the Lord things happen and that's why he'll try to get us to entertain so many other things he'll try to get so many other things on our on our mind but see the real the real reality God's not looking for you to be so strong as a person man if I could be like no no you don't have to be like nobody else just entertain him entertain the angel of the Lord be like Gideon wait right here wait right here I got something in my house I want to bring out to you entertain him entertain the presence of the Lord you leave out of here after the service you say how do I entertain him when I I go out there to eat man them kind of atmospheres out there and this or that you entertain him by keeping it right there in your heart continue to worship over it continue to pray over it throughout the week Lord you spoke to my heart this one thing dropped in my life Lord continue to entertain him and you know what it keeps those High horses over there don't you love him aren't you just so I'm so thankful for him amen God bless you father we don't Lord want to ask for the close upon this service for Lord there's no opening or closing to your working in our lives it's only a [Music] continuation now Lord I'm
