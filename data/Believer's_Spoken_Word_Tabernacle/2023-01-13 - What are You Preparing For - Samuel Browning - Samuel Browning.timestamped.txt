[31:48] Lord when they constrained you and said
[31:51] no Lord we want you to come in Lord we
[31:55] we want you to come in they did not even
[31:58] know it was you but it was something
[32:00] that they were speaking from their heart
[32:03] of what was already stirring them
[32:05] drawing in their heart and causing their
[32:08] heart to burn and Lord it brought about
[32:11] Lord a constraining that we want you
[32:14] Lord to turn in Lord and speak to us
[32:16] Lord here tonight we are Desiring oh God
[32:20] that Lord that you would come and
[32:22] commune with us Lord our hearts the Lord

[32:49] in our lives Lord we pray heal the sick
[32:52] that are among us the Lord those that
[32:54] are streaming Lord touch their bodies
[32:56] Lord touch lives we pray o God as your
[33:00] word Goes Forth Lord May the spirit of
[33:02] God just cause our bodies to obey that
[33:05] confession that rises in our hearts Lord
[33:07] we love you and thank you now father in
[33:10] Jesus precious name amen
[33:14] amen let's look in Job chapter 21.
[33:24] and we'll look at verse 17.
[33:31] foreign
[33:33] and as I told you here just even though
[33:35] I think a few weeks ago I
[33:38] had no intentions of of moving or this
[33:41] chapter was just going to make a
[33:42] reference to at a point
[33:45] of what job where a conclusion was being
[33:46] drawn but
[33:48] the Lord seen fit otherwise so we just
[33:50] want to obey him
[33:52] in verse 17 of this chapter now this
[33:57] whole chapter remember what job is
[33:58] answering is all there's been the
[34:01] accusations throughout that's it's just
[34:03] been dropped all the way but then even
[34:06] the chapter preceding this in chapter
[34:08] 20. where it was just an unloading
[34:12] of speaking of how that these things
[34:17] that were the wicked that all of a
[34:20] sudden their prosperity and all these
[34:22] things it just it just fleeth like that
[34:26] and job would God would see fit because
[34:31] remember job is a prophet he may not
[34:35] have the inspiration for what he is
[34:38] facing right now but he is still
[34:40] speaking by inspiration that he has
[34:43] received to bring discernment even in
[34:46] his generation so the message if you can
[34:49] see this that the message job and his
[34:52] message are not two separate things he
[34:54] and his message are one
[34:55] and it's been it's bringing a
[34:57] discernment even from what job and so
[34:59] job is laying this out it's a contrast
[35:01] to what they are saying and so we want
[35:04] to look at that in verse 17 just moving
[35:07] into that a little further tonight how
[35:09] oft is the candle of the wicked put out
[35:11] and how oft cometh their destruction
[35:14] upon them God distributeth sorrows and
[35:18] anger so in other words how that things
[35:20] are able what job is saying how they're
[35:22] able to linger how things go on the
[35:24] wicked continue to prosper it goes on
[35:26] but you remember the wills of Prophecy
[35:29] are sure
[35:30] it turned slow
[35:32] but it sure is that right and the Bible
[35:35] is very clear whatsoever a man soweth he
[35:38] reapeth
[35:39] right
[35:40] amen so notice verse 18 they are as
[35:44] stubborn now he's talking about the
[35:46] wicked they are as stubble before the
[35:49] wind and as chaff that the storm carryth
[35:54] away
[35:56] and so when look verse 19 and God layeth
[35:59] up his iniquity for his children
[36:01] he rewardeth him
[36:03] and he shall know it or aren't you
[36:06] thankful
[36:07] that your iniquity is not laid up for
[36:09] you
[36:10] aren't you grateful that your iniquity
[36:12] it's already been taken care of and
[36:15] you've recognized that and you've
[36:17] accepted that
[36:19] amen aren't you grateful your sins are
[36:21] not you're not something you're coming
[36:23] to but there's things that's already
[36:25] behind you
[36:26] amen I'm thankful for that
[36:29] verse 20 his eyes shall see his
[36:31] destruction and he shall drink of the
[36:34] Wrath of the almighty for what pleasure
[36:36] hath he in his house after him when the
[36:39] number of his months is cut off in the
[36:42] midst shall any teach God knowledge
[36:44] seeing he judgeth those that are high
[36:47] one dieth in his full strength being
[36:50] holy at ease and quiet that's quite a
[36:54] contrast
[36:56] quite a contrast
[36:57] his breasts are full of milk this speaks
[37:00] of this man's life as far as with the
[37:02] Natural Things is natural life he's full
[37:05] of nourishment
[37:06] he's nourished his life is full of
[37:08] nourishment and another dieth in the
[37:11] bitterness of his soul and never eateth
[37:14] with pleasure and they shall lie down
[37:17] alike in the dust and the worms shall
[37:20] cover them
[37:21] amen how many know that that death don't
[37:24] have any respect whether it's rich or
[37:25] poor
[37:27] death don't take into account how much a
[37:29] person has or doesn't have
[37:31] as a matter of fact when you read on in
[37:33] the Book of Job the Bible says that in
[37:36] hell it's naked there's no clothing
[37:39] there's nothing that is there there's
[37:42] everything that people have put their
[37:44] stock in in his life there is nothing
[37:46] there
[37:48] but oh my
[37:50] for the righteous for the believer I'm
[37:52] not helpless not prepared for me it
[37:54] wasn't prepared for you it was made for
[37:56] the devil and his angels a matter of
[37:57] fact it wasn't made for human beings
[38:00] right and and God even in the midst of
[38:03] his grace will provide us red lights
[38:05] roadblocks everything else to try to
[38:08] stop a person from going that direction
[38:11] amen I want to really I want to just
[38:13] heed to that amen may God bless you
[38:15] bless the reading of the word as you're
[38:17] being seated I just want to just speak
[38:19] on just a little question here tonight
[38:21] out of this and we'll see how far we get
[38:24] and I want to just really
[38:26] um to think about how that there are
[38:28] preparations that are that are in place
[38:31] that's been in place and they're really
[38:33] quite
[38:35] um different it's a contrast of what's
[38:37] going on this world is preparing for
[38:41] judgment
[38:42] and the bride is preparing for rapture
[38:46] there's a preparation going on and so
[38:48] the question that we want to be able to
[38:51] take in and to really reflect upon is
[38:54] what are you preparing for
[38:56] what are you preparing for
[38:58] you see the Bible tells us here that
[39:00] when we we recognize that when the
[39:02] reality strikes our hearts that this
[39:06] life itself has never really been about
[39:09] this life
[39:12] this life is not about this life it's
[39:14] about the next life it's all it's
[39:17] preparation this is why that when you
[39:20] look at the scriptures in Hebrews 11 the
[39:24] Bible says by faith Noah being warned of
[39:28] God of things not seen as yet
[39:32] moved with fear with the reverence he
[39:36] prepared an ark to the saving of his
[39:39] house by the which he condemned the
[39:42] world and became heir of the
[39:44] righteousness which is by faith
[39:47] now God provided all that was needed but
[39:51] God didn't go out and harvest the trees
[39:54] for Noah
[39:55] God didn't cut him down for Noah but
[39:57] Noah had to go and he moved upon that
[40:00] and you know to to take and what was
[40:03] needed in order to bring about what God
[40:07] was calling for you know when you are I
[40:09] look at it in our life of what God is
[40:12] calling Our Lives to and when the God
[40:15] speaks to a heart and is drawing our
[40:18] hearts to him to walk with him you know
[40:21] God is not asking us as though that we
[40:24] already had the necessary material but
[40:27] God is letting you know that what he's
[40:29] calling you and I too he has already
[40:33] provided so it's not something that we
[40:36] have to do or to work ourselves into but
[40:40] it is to accept what God has already
[40:43] provided and to think about how that
[40:46] noise he labored he worked he toiled he
[40:50] prayed he he continued uh just you know
[40:53] giving himself to the Lord all for this
[40:56] purpose it was a preparation for that of
[41:00] the Ark for the saving of his household
[41:03] so in the midst of it now this is why
[41:05] withdrawing from here when we look at
[41:07] job's friends job's friends were looking
[41:11] at and the only way that they could
[41:13] understand things taking place remember
[41:16] brother Brown tells us that they only
[41:18] knew job theologically or at God
[41:22] theologically they did not know God by
[41:24] Revelation so the only way that they
[41:27] could interpret that God was just was
[41:30] that job was a secret Sinner and you'll
[41:34] notice as we said everything that they
[41:36] focused on was everything in this realm
[41:39] that could be seen they were not focused
[41:42] on what was the most important and that
[41:45] was a relationship with God and a
[41:48] fellowship with God they didn't focus on
[41:51] that and yet that that was the very
[41:54] harsh desire here of job job was
[41:56] expressing all throughout and he
[41:59] continues what job is longing for job's
[42:02] not saying I want my cattle back Joe
[42:04] missed all of these things family and on
[42:06] and on but job said what I desire is
[42:09] there is one that could put his hand on
[42:12] God and me a life oh that I could come
[42:15] before his seat that I could hear his
[42:18] voice once again what was job's focus it
[42:22] was not upon those things down here that
[42:25] had been removed but his Focus was what
[42:28] was the most important thing is my
[42:30] fellowship with God
[42:33] and that's still the most important it's
[42:36] always been the most important to every
[42:39] believer that's lived upon the face of
[42:42] the Earth as a matter of fact it has
[42:44] been that that has caused lives to be
[42:48] classified as oddballs because of the
[42:51] decisions that they would make in life
[42:53] they would make decisions in life not
[42:57] based upon the natural means but their
[43:01] decisions would be based upon the
[43:03] spiritual realm because one thing a
[43:06] Believer can rest in surely Spirit sure
[43:09] is mine things tests can come troubles
[43:11] but there's one confidence that a
[43:13] Believer has that when I am following in
[43:16] the will of God God will take care of
[43:19] everything that is going on around me
[43:22] he's a Waymaker so if I'll follow him I
[43:25] trust him he will open the way for me
[43:30] Noah pounded away in a preparation
[43:33] he labored for this now I want to just
[43:36] transition into this moment here in
[43:38] second Peter chapter 3 that speaks even
[43:41] of the moment that we are living in the
[43:44] Bible would say beloved I write unto you
[43:46] that in both which I would stir up your
[43:50] pure Minds by the way of remembrance
[43:52] that you would be mindful of The Words
[43:54] which were spoken before by the holy
[43:57] prophets and of the Commandment of us
[44:00] the Apostles of the Lord and Savior
[44:02] knowing this verse that there shall come
[44:06] in the last days scoffers walking after
[44:10] their own lust
[44:12] is that right now let me just kind of
[44:14] just pick that up he would come as
[44:16] scoffers and brother Bram goes into that
[44:18] here but let me just continue to read
[44:19] the scripture he says and saying this is
[44:22] what the scoffers what would come forth
[44:25] from out of their lives where is the
[44:28] promise of his coming
[44:31] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[44:35] things continue as they were from the
[44:39] beginning of the creation
[44:42] now you cannot you can talk or hear
[44:45] different people saying different things
[44:47] where people are even in a place to
[44:49] recognize in one way something's going
[44:52] on
[44:53] or we're at where I've been we're in a
[44:56] serious moment they can see conditions
[44:59] in the world and you and I are looking
[45:01] at it as though it's not just a natural
[45:04] progression this is the hand of almighty
[45:08] God
[45:09] it is because we're lives according to
[45:12] prophecy have rejected the spirit of God
[45:15] they have turned him down that's the
[45:17] reason this nation in itself it had its
[45:20] opportunity and in 1956 it turned down
[45:24] and rejected the Holy Ghost and that's
[45:28] why we see that as it has propagated and
[45:31] where it is even right now of the
[45:33] ungodliness and all that is right here
[45:36] even among us we see the effects of that
[45:40] and notice where is the promise of his
[45:42] coming so it's putting a question Upon
[45:46] This Promise the Bible says for this
[45:48] they willingly are ignorant of that by
[45:52] the word of God the heavens were of old
[45:54] and the Earth standing out of the water
[45:56] and in the water whereby the world that
[45:59] was then being overflowed with water
[46:01] perish in other words Judgment of what
[46:04] was to come was all around them
[46:07] it was all around them
[46:09] but the heavens and the Earth which are
[46:12] now by the same word are kept in store
[46:15] reserved unto fire against the day of
[46:18] judgment and Perdition of ungodly men
[46:21] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[46:24] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[46:28] thousand years and a thousand years as
[46:31] one day and the Lord is not slack
[46:35] concerning his promise has some men
[46:37] count slackness but his long-suffering
[46:40] to us word I'm glad about that not
[46:43] willing that any should perish but that
[46:45] all should come to repentance now God's
[46:49] not going to lose one of his elect
[46:52] when we stand there that day there will
[46:54] not be one wedding robe if we can use
[46:56] the analogy there will not be one
[46:58] wedding rope or one theophany there and
[47:01] God said they just didn't make it no God
[47:05] has already prepared just as he prepared
[47:08] the ark Noah preached 120 years but God
[47:12] when he gave the dimensions of that Ark
[47:15] he knew the only ones that would
[47:17] actually heed and listen would be that
[47:20] of Noah and his family so God when he
[47:23] sends his word let me tell you something
[47:24] God has an expectation God does not send
[47:28] his word with a hope so or you know
[47:31] there might be somebody no his word is
[47:34] part of his predestinated Redemptive
[47:37] plan and God is moving down to bring a
[47:40] rescue for his children
[47:43] glory be to God but the day of the Lord
[47:46] will come as a thief in the night now
[47:50] back there in verse 9 there'll be
[47:51] there'll be lives thank God for the
[47:54] mercy of God that are given an
[47:56] opportunity to come to Salvation
[48:00] is that right
[48:01] but remember the bride itself is the
[48:04] only ones elected for the rapture
[48:07] is that right
[48:08] there'll be many others of names that
[48:11] were the grace of God spilled over from
[48:13] the Lamb's Book of Life onto the book of
[48:15] life that received salvation
[48:18] is that right brother Brandon said where
[48:20] they were not trusting in their church
[48:22] but they were trusting in Jesus Christ
[48:25] for their salvation that's why brother
[48:27] Brandon said a Catholic man he said if
[48:29] he's trusting in the church he's lost
[48:31] but if he's trusting in Jesus Christ
[48:33] he's saved
[48:34] is that right now you know there's a
[48:36] further call for the bride and listen
[48:38] you're not going to keep the bride back
[48:40] there the bride's not going to be one
[48:41] that becomes complacent and says well
[48:43] you know what praise God I'm saved
[48:45] that's all it is because even those that
[48:47] are in that place there's no desire for
[48:50] further truth but they are walking in
[48:53] the light that God is open to them but
[48:55] for the bride brother there's something
[48:57] that you and I cannot even explain what
[49:00] he is it's a deep that's calling to the
[49:03] Deep there is more light to be revealed
[49:05] and that's why we can't even settle can
[49:07] I bring it down here we can't even
[49:09] settle for a lifestyle just being in a
[49:13] message Church there is something that
[49:16] draws us to an expression I've got to
[49:18] have more of him
[49:22] glory be to God
[49:24] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[49:28] thief in the night
[49:30] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[49:32] with the great noise and the element
[49:34] shall melt with a fervent heat the Earth
[49:36] also in the worst therein shall be
[49:38] burned up
[49:39] so think about in The Hour That here we
[49:41] are just very briefly here for these
[49:43] scriptures it's a Time
[49:46] of preparation and God has seen to it in
[49:50] this this is the hour We're Not Looking
[49:54] for the rapture we have entered the
[49:57] Rapture cycle
[49:59] is that right we have entered into that
[50:01] into that place with God God himself
[50:04] Desiring no you and I could not make
[50:07] ourselves Rapture Worthy
[50:11] we couldn't do that even with all of the
[50:14] knowledge that was out there we could
[50:17] not make ourselves Rapture worthy but
[50:20] you and I will ordained for this so
[50:22] because of that God is responsible to
[50:26] himself remember he swore by himself it
[50:29] is God himself that is committed to his
[50:31] Word of Promise to prepare a way for you
[50:34] and I as a matter of fact God knew that
[50:37] you and I would desire the Holy Ghost he
[50:39] knew there would be a desire in our
[50:42] hearts for him a desire for Rapture a
[50:45] desire for escape God knew that and God
[50:48] prepared that for you and I that's why
[50:50] this meeting here tonight is not a by
[50:53] chance it's not something that you know
[50:55] God didn't know about God knew all about
[50:57] it and God knew even each and every one
[51:00] of us where we would be positioned that
[51:02] God knew what we would need and he made
[51:06] a preparation for us
[51:09] and so in this hour the unfolding of the
[51:13] Rapture has it's been unfolded in this
[51:16] hour where the Lord himself shall
[51:19] descend and he has in the shout the
[51:22] voice and the Trump and we understand
[51:24] he's doing all three as he's descending
[51:26] it's unfolding in the life of the
[51:28] believer that shout is the living bread
[51:31] of life it's his own life that then that
[51:33] life becoming wrapped up and there
[51:36] hemorphied in the life of the Bride then
[51:38] it is that same life that same voice
[51:40] that moves throughout the body of Jesus
[51:43] Christ and will literally raise the dead
[51:46] in Christ remember Jesus never ever when
[51:49] he raised he never looked back and said
[51:52] hey the rest of you come on but it was
[51:54] the Fulfillment of Prophecy in his life
[51:57] that announced to them the move is on
[52:00] it's time to move upward it's time to go
[52:03] that's why it's not what we're saying
[52:05] here it's what's being said here that
[52:08] has the greatest impact
[52:10] glory be to God and this is why in the
[52:13] hour that we're living in whole how we
[52:15] thank God for such Grace that has come
[52:17] our way we did not deserve it it is
[52:19] light that has come to our way God
[52:21] promised in the evening light in the
[52:23] evening time there would be light he
[52:25] promised he would open up the pathway
[52:27] the light for you and I and show us and
[52:30] God in His Grace has stood true and he
[52:33] will stand true to the Fulfillment of
[52:36] every promise
[52:38] the Bible said there'd be scoffers as I
[52:40] read to you here in the last days and
[52:42] brother Branham when you notice he'll
[52:43] take that in the message the Rapture and
[52:45] brother Brad will speak of how that
[52:47] those scoffers that they would arise and
[52:50] the whole objective with the scoffers
[52:52] and he'll he'll talk about how that
[52:53] Moses went down into Egypt and he said
[52:56] here he went down to lead out a group of
[52:59] people with only a stick in his hand but
[53:01] remember what that stick was it was the
[53:03] rod of judgment
[53:05] and within that stick that stick
[53:06] remember brother Ram tell us he said if
[53:08] they could have ever got that stick out
[53:10] of Moses hand he'd have been whipped but
[53:11] what that stick was a type of it was a
[53:14] type of the deity that's in the name of
[53:16] Jesus Christ oh my when when that was
[53:19] standing there there was a Divine
[53:21] Vindication what Moses was saying
[53:24] remember when he was there he said how
[53:26] am I going to get these people to
[53:27] believe me how will they know how that'd
[53:29] be a logical question but you see it's
[53:31] not a natural working on a natural you
[53:34] and I are not here because well this all
[53:36] makes sense to me this all lines up
[53:38] there'll be other things that will come
[53:39] that might make more sense we are not
[53:42] here tonight because we are perfect and
[53:44] good in our reasonings and our ability
[53:46] some of us might have more of an
[53:48] intellectual draw than others but we are
[53:51] not here because it makes sense we are
[53:54] here because of divine revelation even
[53:57] the things that we believe and we preach
[53:59] are beyond our own understanding but
[54:02] it's by revelation
[54:04] are you with me you say brother Sammy
[54:06] what are you saying I'm saying we're not
[54:07] a bunch of apologetics that's what I'm
[54:09] saying amen we are inspired Holy Ghost
[54:12] Field believe us amen that God himself
[54:16] has inspired and met we have met him
[54:19] face to face so as we look at this here
[54:21] we recognize the scoffers they would
[54:24] rise and brother Brown would tell us of
[54:26] how that the scoffers and what they
[54:27] would do and remember how when Moses
[54:30] threw the stick down he uses this
[54:31] example that Janice and Jamboree stood
[54:33] through their sticks down as well and
[54:36] when their sticks they were they they
[54:38] turned to serpents as well but it was
[54:40] Moses stick that consumed them now think
[54:43] of it Pharaoh himself never focused upon
[54:46] that but when he saw that miraculous
[54:49] being done he looked at that as though
[54:52] it's a Vindication and it hardened him
[54:54] against God's promise in that hour
[54:59] that's why brother Brown could say he
[55:01] said you can take he said a person and
[55:03] they're wearing shorts and bobbing their
[55:04] hair and on and on he said and maybe
[55:06] they can speak in tongues and pray for
[55:08] the sick and this and that and he said
[55:09] you try to tell him that their life is
[55:12] not right with the word of God he said
[55:14] and they'll tell you real quick the Holy
[55:16] Ghost falls on me
[55:18] but for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:20] there's only one Vindication and that's
[55:23] a life that the word itself will
[55:25] interpret
[55:26] there's only one Vindication amen is
[55:29] that right from the Rapture you know all
[55:31] of that brother said all those
[55:32] impersonations are kinds of things to
[55:35] upset the people and just say it very
[55:37] simply there's not another message to
[55:39] come we have received the end time
[55:41] message we have received the necessary
[55:44] preparation from God that you and I can
[55:48] receive of that and be made ready in the
[55:52] coming of the Lord
[55:54] now I want you to look here at Psalms
[55:57] 37.
[55:58] let's look here at this just for a
[56:00] little bit
[56:02] and thinking of how that
[56:04] with job's friends and because we know
[56:06] that I want you to understand this this
[56:08] whole our whole journey here
[56:10] brother Abraham says that and who is
[56:12] this from Melchizedek we we bypassed our
[56:15] theophany and came down here to be
[56:17] tested and tried and tempted and when
[56:20] that's over then we go back home
[56:23] in the Hebrew series
[56:25] he places it like they do at the
[56:28] shipyards over in New Jersey
[56:30] when they before they ever put out a
[56:32] vessel on the sea it must go through
[56:34] a testing or Proving Grounds
[56:37] and this whole life is The Proving
[56:39] Grounds
[56:40] let me just say God is not if I can say
[56:44] it this way that you don't misunderstand
[56:45] me or taking life God is not watching
[56:48] our life
[56:49] like somebody watching a a play or a
[56:51] drama and wondering what the next scene
[56:53] is going to hold
[56:54] God is not sitting there and thinking oh
[56:56] my goodness you mean this person went
[56:58] this way or this or man this one's that
[57:01] nothing surprises God you know when job
[57:03] was standing God wasn't surprised God
[57:06] knew what was in him Journey how did he
[57:10] know what was in him because God knows
[57:12] himself
[57:14] and God's confidence was in himself that
[57:17] job he's a chip off the old block
[57:21] that's where his confidence was at so
[57:24] God is not looking at your eye God is
[57:27] not giving us a test or a trial or
[57:29] permitting things to come our way in
[57:31] order to try to get us to fail God is
[57:33] not doing it that way but every test and
[57:36] every trial is for the molding and the
[57:38] shaping of our life right here within
[57:41] this Earth the actual shaping of our
[57:44] character right now
[57:46] so God's not God's not worried
[57:48] he's he knows exactly what he's doing
[57:52] Psalms 37 1
[57:54] . notice how David would write of this
[57:57] fret not thyself because of evil doers
[58:01] neither be thou envious against the
[58:04] workers of iniquity now just allow the
[58:06] Holy Spirit to just bring it right down
[58:08] and apply it right home in our life
[58:11] for they shall soon be cut down like the
[58:14] grass and wither as the green herb
[58:18] so right now it might be green this
[58:20] might looking good it doesn't matter
[58:22] what you interpret this in boss or
[58:25] anything else or anything within this
[58:26] life it looks like my the world except
[58:29] mine look at this this person and you
[58:31] know they're not even serving God mine
[58:33] look at them advancing to the real
[58:35] believer that's never ever really a real
[58:38] focus in our life
[58:40] because once as a Believer you've met
[58:42] God nothing else matters at all
[58:46] there's only one thing that you have and
[58:48] that's a desire to please the Lord
[58:51] now notice within this Psalm 1714 from
[58:54] men which are thy hand O Lord from Men
[58:57] of the world which have their portion in
[59:00] this life whose belly thou fillest with
[59:03] thy hid treasure they are full of
[59:06] children and leave the rest of their
[59:08] substance to their babies so they have
[59:10] their portion in this life Hey listen
[59:12] this is the Millennium for many people
[59:15] but this is not the Millennium for me
[59:17] and I'm not even talking about false
[59:19] teachers I'm talking about for how the
[59:20] world this is their millennium this is
[59:23] they they're hey they're enjoying
[59:24] themselves there I mean you know here's
[59:26] Thursday night there's many of them
[59:27] already their weekend has started
[59:29] tonight
[59:30] won't you say we start our weekend
[59:32] tonight
[59:34] you're going to repeat it this is what
[59:36] they're look they're they're living for
[59:37] they go through they make it through
[59:39] Monday they make it through Tuesday they
[59:41] make it through Wednesday they persevere
[59:44] through Thursday because they know
[59:46] here's Thursday night and Thursday night
[59:48] we'll be able to help them get through
[59:49] Friday morning through the donut line
[59:51] through the coffee line everything else
[59:53] because of what the weekend holds for
[59:55] them oh I'm glad as a Believer we are
[59:59] not caught up in those things I'm glad
[1:00:01] that we have found our source of
[1:00:04] satisfaction and rest I'm glad we're not
[1:00:06] looking for the next thing to come along
[1:00:08] and the next ball team to rise up and
[1:00:10] the next one is I'm glad that that is
[1:00:12] not my focus I'm thankful that there is
[1:00:15] a more sure place and a place of real
[1:00:19] rest and refreshment to where even when
[1:00:21] we can lay our head on the pillow at
[1:00:23] night we've got joy
[1:00:26] amen we've got rest we've got
[1:00:27] Thanksgiving in our hearts amen notice
[1:00:31] now job would speak of these things here
[1:00:33] in previous chapters regarding this of
[1:00:36] the wicked prospering in job 9 24 the
[1:00:39] Earth is given into the hand of the
[1:00:41] wicked notice it doesn't belong to them
[1:00:43] but it is given into their hand
[1:00:46] see how job misunderstanding this
[1:00:48] Revelation he knew that the Earth itself
[1:00:51] it belongs to God the Earth itself but
[1:00:55] it has been given into the hands of
[1:00:57] wicked oh my but whoever gave it whoever
[1:01:00] wherever it belongs to it's got to come
[1:01:03] back to
[1:01:04] he covers the faces of the judges
[1:01:07] thereof if not where
[1:01:09] if not where and who is he job 12 6 the
[1:01:14] Tabernacles of robbers prosper
[1:01:17] and they that Pro provoked God are
[1:01:20] secure wow
[1:01:22] remember there's so many places here in
[1:01:24] the scripture there at ease
[1:01:26] they even rest upon themselves in this
[1:01:28] previous chapter of job 21 and they make
[1:01:31] the statement of
[1:01:32] why should i serve him I've got a good
[1:01:35] why do I need to serve God I ain't poor
[1:01:38] I ain't broke I ain't troubled well I
[1:01:39] don't serve you because I'm poor I
[1:01:41] didn't serve him because I'm troubled I
[1:01:44] served him because I loved him and the
[1:01:46] reason I love him because he first loved
[1:01:48] me
[1:01:49] it had to let me get to a place in my
[1:01:52] life all those sitting around in a
[1:01:54] message Church acquainted with it but
[1:01:55] God had to allow me to get to a place in
[1:01:58] my life till I recognize this I needed
[1:02:01] him
[1:02:03] not just knowledge of quotes that I
[1:02:05] could finish but I needed him
[1:02:10] hmm
[1:02:11] and God knows how to let us get to those
[1:02:13] places to recognize that the message is
[1:02:15] not about doctrines the message is not
[1:02:17] about I know this and the message is
[1:02:20] Christ revealed to you and I and in US
[1:02:24] Lord be to God that's the whole purpose
[1:02:26] notice into whose hand the Tabernacles
[1:02:29] of robbers prosper and they that provoke
[1:02:31] God are secure into whose hand God
[1:02:35] bringeth abundantly
[1:02:38] now see a person could look at that and
[1:02:40] think Lord have mercy what blessings my
[1:02:44] look at man alive look they're
[1:02:46] prospering look at what but be careful
[1:02:49] what you're looking at
[1:02:53] are you with me remember brother Brown
[1:02:55] told us there's as many Penny ears as
[1:02:56] there is millionaires
[1:02:58] you know what a penny area
[1:03:00] and hope and acting thinking like
[1:03:02] they're a millionaire and spending like
[1:03:03] they are when they're pennies
[1:03:08] let's just be Penny ears
[1:03:10] but I mean real ones
[1:03:12] amen we're not interested in the riches
[1:03:15] of this world because it corrupts
[1:03:17] is that right but notice into whose hand
[1:03:19] God bringeth abundantly verse verse 13
[1:03:22] of job 21 as I refer to this moments ago
[1:03:24] they spend their days in wealth their
[1:03:28] life is wrapped up in wealth and in a
[1:03:32] moment
[1:03:33] go down to the Grave
[1:03:35] that first part of that scripture Satan
[1:03:37] is a bigger sister in that right there
[1:03:40] wow you know not only did it have it
[1:03:42] before with all the television ads and
[1:03:44] everything else but all the Billboards
[1:03:46] that are out there but now it just goes
[1:03:48] right across the phone screen
[1:03:50] it's got the latest and greatest and and
[1:03:53] the next thing in line and what's it do
[1:03:55] it's keeping the people chasing after
[1:03:56] the next day
[1:03:58] oh Lord this is the next Style
[1:04:00] oh Lord this is the next town you know
[1:04:02] what's happening being led right to
[1:04:04] judgment
[1:04:05] everything LED right to judgment keeping
[1:04:08] everything before him because what their
[1:04:10] focus is on the wrong thing
[1:04:14] but you know James said this life itself
[1:04:17] it's just a vapor
[1:04:19] it really is
[1:04:22] it's just a season I don't know we could
[1:04:24] probably testify this going around the
[1:04:26] room sometimes it is so hard for me to
[1:04:28] capture
[1:04:28] when I think of that the age I'm only 47
[1:04:32] I know I don't look anywhere near it
[1:04:34] look a whole lot younger but it's hard
[1:04:37] for me to capture that when I look at
[1:04:39] certain pictures of my dad and myself
[1:04:40] that I'm the age now that he was as a
[1:04:43] matter of fact a couple years older
[1:04:45] it's hard for me my mind be honest with
[1:04:47] it's hard for my mind to wrap that
[1:04:48] around because you don't want to know
[1:04:50] why I look at everybody else as being
[1:04:52] older than me
[1:04:53] it's hard it's you know you look at you
[1:04:55] look at things like that but you realize
[1:04:57] you know what this life is but a vapor
[1:04:59] I mean to me you talk to me I could you
[1:05:01] know you you know as you can get around
[1:05:02] people you went to high school with and
[1:05:03] you talk about like things or just
[1:05:04] yesterday and you know what here it's
[1:05:06] been 30 years ago for some of you maybe
[1:05:08] a lot longer than that
[1:05:10] and you know what and I remember seeing
[1:05:11] people that come back that have been out
[1:05:13] for 30 years and they were talking about
[1:05:15] the Glory Days in their football and you
[1:05:16] thought wow these people are old Lord
[1:05:18] have mercy
[1:05:21] it's funny how we think about things
[1:05:22] right the youthful mind always looks at
[1:05:25] it like I've got all the time in the
[1:05:26] world or I've got all this out there but
[1:05:28] when you begin to look back you realize
[1:05:30] wait a minute where did these last years
[1:05:33] go
[1:05:35] where did they go
[1:05:38] right it's just but a vapor now notice
[1:05:41] when we consider this here even in the
[1:05:45] midst of Psalms 37 let's go on in verse
[1:05:48] 3. now watch this admonition this is
[1:05:50] what I want us to look at the admonition
[1:05:52] to direct and focus our lives into
[1:05:54] because this is what job remember this
[1:05:57] is what job has been about throughout
[1:05:59] his life at his whole life matter of
[1:06:00] fact job's testimony even in Job 31 is
[1:06:03] that God knows I've never even said
[1:06:06] regarding gold and worshiped it or
[1:06:09] delighted in it I've never done that
[1:06:11] whatsoever I've trusted him
[1:06:14] job had that testimony so job knew what
[1:06:17] he was speaking of here so here our
[1:06:20] trust and our focus is to be in him so
[1:06:22] the Bible says in Psalms 37 3 trust in
[1:06:25] the Lord and do good
[1:06:28] so shalt thou dwell in the land and
[1:06:31] verily Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself
[1:06:35] also in the Lord
[1:06:39] and he shall give Thee the desires of
[1:06:43] thine heart
[1:06:45] so there's no way that we can really
[1:06:47] Delight ourselves in the Lord and our
[1:06:51] desires not be about him
[1:06:53] right there's just no way because when
[1:06:56] he comes moves into our life Everything
[1:06:59] Changes even our request when God is
[1:07:02] beginning to even deal with our life our
[1:07:04] request and the things begin to fade
[1:07:07] from around us and our requests begin to
[1:07:11] be upon him and what he is speaking to
[1:07:14] us about right even starts with
[1:07:17] forgiveness repentance on and on and on
[1:07:19] so notice in verse 5 commit thy way unto
[1:07:22] the Lord trust also in him and he shall
[1:07:26] bring it to pass
[1:07:28] yeah I'll say the same thing help me
[1:07:31] Lord because committed means you know
[1:07:33] what to put it on to roll away to to
[1:07:36] place into his hands
[1:07:39] and sometimes you know that's an easy
[1:07:41] word but sometimes that's a hard thing
[1:07:43] for us to do even as Believers it's a
[1:07:46] hard thing to do we're saying Lord I
[1:07:48] want to commit it and it isn't like that
[1:07:49] we're laying on a pillow and God's
[1:07:51] saying here you have it no Lord I wanted
[1:07:53] you to have it no God will never throw
[1:07:55] it back at us
[1:07:56] but the hardest thing is for us to
[1:07:59] commit it to him
[1:08:00] and yet brother Brown would tell us that
[1:08:02] is one of the most powerful weapons that
[1:08:04] God has given us as the Church of the
[1:08:07] Living God
[1:08:08] to commit is when we come to that place
[1:08:10] it's just Lord just of a faith and I
[1:08:13] trust you and you know I've said this
[1:08:14] many times right here in prayer on phone
[1:08:16] and counsel and everywhere else I would
[1:08:19] be honest now I'm telling you this
[1:08:20] because of my experience I would be
[1:08:22] honest enough to say Lord I'm maybe not
[1:08:25] there right now but I ain't gonna pack
[1:08:27] this around many longer I'm asking that
[1:08:29] you'll help me to come into that place
[1:08:31] of committing this into your hands
[1:08:35] now remember you can't Tinker with it
[1:08:38] and commit it at the same time
[1:08:40] because if you're tinkering with it it's
[1:08:41] still on your work desk
[1:08:43] you hadn't put it on God's work desk you
[1:08:46] know they have a like like the manhole
[1:08:48] my my you know the guy that would be
[1:08:50] like the the master he would bring in
[1:08:52] the apprentice and The Apprentice was
[1:08:53] learning to trade but the one who would
[1:08:55] be here at the desk he's the one who
[1:08:56] knew all about the trade he's the one
[1:08:58] that could teach the apprentice and
[1:08:59] bring him along in in that whole time
[1:09:01] and you know many times we're over here
[1:09:03] trying to get God God I'm asking you to
[1:09:05] solve this problem Lord I Lord I need
[1:09:07] you to do this and God said you still
[1:09:08] got it on an apprentice desk you need to
[1:09:10] bring it over to the Master's desk
[1:09:12] that's a committal yeah committal is is
[1:09:15] where our hands are off of it
[1:09:17] now this is part of focus and admonition
[1:09:20] in our lives because there's things that
[1:09:22] you know we come face to face with that
[1:09:24] there is no way that we're going to be
[1:09:26] able to resolve it there's things in the
[1:09:27] workplace and on and on family and
[1:09:29] everything else there's no way in the
[1:09:30] world we can spend all of our strength
[1:09:33] all of everything and yet when it all
[1:09:34] comes down to it all we've done is tired
[1:09:37] ourselves
[1:09:39] anybody ever been there
[1:09:41] yeah I've been there
[1:09:43] and he shall now notice this is what
[1:09:45] he'll do if we commit our way unto the
[1:09:48] Lord he will bring forth thy
[1:09:50] righteousness as the light and that
[1:09:52] judgment as the Noonday
[1:09:56] so it isn't something that's just
[1:09:58] like this in our life but that's what we
[1:10:00] want
[1:10:01] right but it's things that God who as we
[1:10:04] commit our ways unto the Lord and you
[1:10:05] know when you committed one of the sure
[1:10:07] signs when you've committed it I've
[1:10:08] committed it we're resting
[1:10:11] it doesn't matter whatever comes up it's
[1:10:13] a line vanity
[1:10:14] uh it's in God's hands I don't accept
[1:10:17] nothing that's a sign of a committal
[1:10:19] it's a rest
[1:10:21] now you might have everything else
[1:10:22] that'll try to speak against it what's
[1:10:24] Satan trying to do draw you out
[1:10:26] what was Satan trying to do to job draw
[1:10:28] him out
[1:10:30] that's what he was trying to do now
[1:10:32] notice verse seven I want you to hone in
[1:10:34] on this part of it here because
[1:10:37] Satan's desire is always to try to get
[1:10:41] us
[1:10:42] entangled with the Affairs of this life
[1:10:47] the part of that is that we are looking
[1:10:50] at things that we see we taste we feel
[1:10:54] on and on and on things that are right
[1:10:56] out here around us
[1:10:57] and we are prone to want to try to solve
[1:11:01] it within the first two realms
[1:11:04] we're prone
[1:11:06] that's a part of the weakness in our
[1:11:08] lives and you might say well but the
[1:11:10] same of that that's not necessarily no
[1:11:11] it is a weakness it's a weakness in our
[1:11:13] life that we are prone to that part of
[1:11:15] it to try to solve to try to help to try
[1:11:18] to help God out in some way but notice
[1:11:21] it's Satan's desire is to always get us
[1:11:23] entangled verse 7 rest in the Lord
[1:11:26] and wait patiently for him
[1:11:32] fret not thyself because of him who
[1:11:35] prospereth in his way
[1:11:38] because of the man who bringeth Wicked
[1:11:42] devices to pass notice how he's talking
[1:11:44] about our focus and where we're to be
[1:11:45] focused in on cease from anger you know
[1:11:48] what that tells me these situations we
[1:11:51] can be angered
[1:11:52] we could be frustrated oh Lord Brother
[1:11:55] Sammy you're talking about Believers I
[1:11:56] know I am that's who I'm preaching to
[1:11:58] tonight that's who David's writing to
[1:12:00] cease from anger
[1:12:03] and forsake Wrath
[1:12:07] fret not by self in any wise to do evil
[1:12:13] for evil doers shall be cut off but
[1:12:17] those that wait upon the Lord they shall
[1:12:21] inherit the earth
[1:12:24] for yet a little while and the wicked
[1:12:26] shall not be yea they Thou shalt
[1:12:28] diligently consider his place and it
[1:12:31] shall not be notice where the Wicked the
[1:12:33] evil doers and how that their lives
[1:12:36] would Prosper even to things Within
[1:12:38] These verses that would literally vex
[1:12:41] the righteous or it would move and the
[1:12:45] righteous could look on but notice what
[1:12:47] David is admonishing by the spirit of
[1:12:49] God do
[1:12:52] in world
[1:12:53] ly even of things that you could
[1:12:56] seemingly seem justified
[1:13:00] is that right
[1:13:01] sometimes the greatest traps remember
[1:13:03] are the things that are so unnoticeable
[1:13:07] like oh my in the workplace I'm going to
[1:13:09] lead a crusade against all of the bosses
[1:13:12] and I'm gonna you know they've done this
[1:13:13] and they've done that in my bed there
[1:13:15] are some things that might need to be
[1:13:17] uncovered but sometimes that can become
[1:13:19] the greatest detriment and trap because
[1:13:21] the enemy is moving upon us and we get
[1:13:23] into this philanthropist thinking I hope
[1:13:25] I said the word right we get into this
[1:13:27] thinking right I'm just gonna you know
[1:13:29] I'm just gonna help everybody and what
[1:13:31] happens is it heats up our meditation it
[1:13:33] eats up our mind it eats up our prayer
[1:13:35] time it eats up our reading time you
[1:13:37] might have did all sorts of things for
[1:13:39] the company but where has your life been
[1:13:42] with God in the meantime
[1:13:46] this is why he said fret not because
[1:13:48] there's going to be times that we could
[1:13:50] become very fretful about things well
[1:13:53] that ain't Fair they're doing this and
[1:13:55] and this but just just just just just
[1:13:57] look to the Lord wait
[1:13:59] patiently
[1:14:01] on the Lord
[1:14:02] notice verse 11. but the meek Oh Glory
[1:14:06] shall inherit the earth and shall
[1:14:09] Delight themselves in the abundance of
[1:14:12] Peace the meek those who give place
[1:14:16] the Bible says give place to Wrath
[1:14:18] the meek shall inherit those who give
[1:14:20] place in the powerful the Bible says
[1:14:22] Moses was the meekest man in the earth
[1:14:25] and yet make us Moses also had a temper
[1:14:28] but you know what he was the meekest man
[1:14:30] in the earth because Meek means to give
[1:14:32] place he gave place to almighty God he
[1:14:35] gave place to the revealed word of God
[1:14:37] and it worked in his life it moved in
[1:14:39] his life it brought him into position in
[1:14:41] his life the meat shall inherit the
[1:14:43] earth give place to the word of God and
[1:14:46] the word of God working in your life
[1:14:47] will give you strength over that which
[1:14:51] could cause fret
[1:14:53] is that right
[1:14:55] notice the wicked I know I'm speaking
[1:14:57] tonight and there we could just pause
[1:14:58] between every scripture and every
[1:14:59] testimony and say hell you go ahead and
[1:15:01] give a testimony we give testimonies
[1:15:02] after every one of these scriptures
[1:15:03] tonight the wicked plotteth against the
[1:15:06] just and gnasheth upon him with his
[1:15:08] teeth
[1:15:10] the Lord shall laugh at him for he seeth
[1:15:12] that his day is coming so you mean God
[1:15:14] doesn't stop his plots
[1:15:16] you mean God just doesn't lean right in
[1:15:18] upon his children and say oh the wicked
[1:15:21] is plodding against you
[1:15:23] God reveals what's necessary to be
[1:15:25] revealed but there's other plots that
[1:15:28] can be made but just remember Esther
[1:15:30] anything that Haman makes as a plot God
[1:15:32] still has his mind on you
[1:15:34] amen God has not forgot about you
[1:15:38] notice the wicked have drawn out the
[1:15:40] sword they have bent their bow to cast
[1:15:42] down the poor and the needy and to say
[1:15:44] such as be upright of conversation and
[1:15:46] their sword shall enter into their own
[1:15:48] heart and their bows shall be broken
[1:15:52] I'd say it in this way we don't want
[1:15:54] there's a lot of things that we could
[1:15:56] enter into
[1:15:58] there's things you can enter into in
[1:15:59] family
[1:16:01] there's things you can enter into in the
[1:16:03] workplace
[1:16:04] there's things you can enter into all
[1:16:06] around us it's spirit
[1:16:09] let me tell you something there's a
[1:16:11] spirit of destruction that's all around
[1:16:13] us
[1:16:16] it's a spirit that's out to destroy this
[1:16:19] world there's a spirit of this world
[1:16:22] and remember just as much we're looking
[1:16:24] in the age of the Rapture and the
[1:16:26] Rapture that's that word is not even
[1:16:28] mentioned in the scripture but it's that
[1:16:30] mentioned caught up
[1:16:32] we shall be caught up there's a lot of
[1:16:35] things we can get caught up with
[1:16:37] you get caught up with family you get
[1:16:39] caught up with jobs you get caught up
[1:16:40] well what are you preparing for
[1:16:43] because whatever you're caught up in is
[1:16:46] what you're preparing for
[1:16:49] is that right I mean you know how it is
[1:16:50] you can stand around in the workplace
[1:16:51] there's plenty of critics there's people
[1:16:53] everywhere that they you know they can
[1:16:55] tell the boss how to do it better and
[1:16:56] you know what I I and there's some times
[1:16:58] where there's things that could be
[1:16:59] legitimately right there's been boots on
[1:17:01] the ground that have walked know the
[1:17:03] whole thing before all these things are
[1:17:04] given out that's true but how many times
[1:17:06] I wonder is it testing you or I to see
[1:17:09] what our attitude is going to be at
[1:17:11] and we fret ourselves and you know it's
[1:17:13] like the jump rope that's going around
[1:17:14] and here we are you know they're hey Sam
[1:17:16] you ready to jump in okay and here we
[1:17:19] are in a one and a and a two Anna who I
[1:17:21] don't know all those Rhymes and things
[1:17:22] like that and here we do we jump right
[1:17:24] into criticizing
[1:17:27] is that right we Jump Right In man and
[1:17:29] before you know it
[1:17:30] oh Lord I've entered right into this
[1:17:32] I've been and you know what as a
[1:17:34] believer
[1:17:35] oh there's convictional sent right in on
[1:17:37] your life
[1:17:39] amen there's a commitment wait a minute
[1:17:40] here what am I doing entering into this
[1:17:42] what am I doing come on under this
[1:17:44] listen friends that can be even
[1:17:46] bitterness within a family
[1:17:49] Spirits are real
[1:17:52] they're meant to be discerned and
[1:17:54] withstood
[1:17:56] say God help me I don't want to get
[1:17:57] caught up in those things you know
[1:17:59] brother random made a statement I can
[1:18:01] show you and I minister to you those
[1:18:03] different places in the message where
[1:18:05] brother man will say I have purpose in
[1:18:07] my heart never to have a negative
[1:18:08] thought to blast it out then you find
[1:18:10] him a few years later making the same
[1:18:12] statement again you know why because
[1:18:14] it's aware of that there is a continual
[1:18:18] cleansing and washing of Water by the
[1:18:21] word God didn't have to allow the
[1:18:24] prophet to put that to put that before
[1:18:25] us but one thing about it brother Ram
[1:18:27] didn't hide anything from you and I you
[1:18:29] know why that's an example for you and I
[1:18:32] to follow in our life that sometimes
[1:18:35] there's going to be sticky situations
[1:18:37] there's going to be things that we get
[1:18:39] caught up in and God in his grace will
[1:18:43] move down and speak to our heart and we
[1:18:45] say whoa what was I caught up in
[1:18:48] what was I even thinking about
[1:18:51] what is it God's grace
[1:18:54] to our lives
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:56] oh my notice this
[1:18:59] a little that a righteous man hath
[1:19:02] is better than the riches of many Wicked
[1:19:05] for the harms of the wicked shall be
[1:19:07] broken but the Lord
[1:19:09] upholdeth the righteous these are our
[1:19:11] promises now
[1:19:13] the Lord knoweth the days of the upright
[1:19:15] and their inheritance shall be forever
[1:19:18] they shall not be ashamed in the evil
[1:19:21] time and in the days of famine they
[1:19:23] shall be satisfied but the wicked Shall
[1:19:26] Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall
[1:19:28] be as the fat of lambs they shall
[1:19:31] consume and into the smoke shall they
[1:19:33] consume away
[1:19:35] now you see God is always
[1:19:38] trying to narrow this down here God has
[1:19:40] always said his word
[1:19:42] to be the object of our Focus
[1:19:45] not man's ideas God called us out of
[1:19:48] that God called us by his grace you know
[1:19:50] look man was looking at the word of God
[1:19:53] but they had all sorts of
[1:19:54] interpretations
[1:19:56] and they had man's ideas man's
[1:19:58] interpretations God brought us out of
[1:20:00] that
[1:20:01] and I I just stand firm on this I'm not
[1:20:04] going back into that
[1:20:05] I'm not going back into anybody who well
[1:20:08] I'm going to correct brother brownham
[1:20:09] and I'm going to tell you about brother
[1:20:10] Brown's opinions sorry I don't have no
[1:20:12] time for that stuff
[1:20:13] because God God never called me to look
[1:20:15] down on the message God called me to get
[1:20:18] under it
[1:20:20] God called me to look up not down on it
[1:20:22] God called me to look up because that is
[1:20:25] Jehovah the eagle sweeping through
[1:20:26] because here's what it all comes down to
[1:20:28] at the end of the day it must say the
[1:20:32] same thing
[1:20:34] is that right plain and simple so when
[1:20:37] we look at this God has always set his
[1:20:40] word to be the object of our focus and
[1:20:43] then through that Focus as as a life
[1:20:45] would be drawn away an attraction would
[1:20:47] take place think of Moses think of
[1:20:49] Abraham On and On Through the scriptures
[1:20:51] through that Focus then there would come
[1:20:53] forth a relationship because it would
[1:20:55] not be that of a letter and a man but it
[1:20:57] would be God himself who is the word and
[1:21:00] there would become a relationship there
[1:21:01] it would be a fellowship and through
[1:21:04] that relationship and fellowship there
[1:21:06] would be a strengthening that the man
[1:21:09] receives along with leadership
[1:21:12] to navigate
[1:21:13] through not only plenteous and precious
[1:21:17] times but tumultuous times as well
[1:21:21] because he's just not God when
[1:21:22] everything's going right
[1:21:23] he's just not God when we understand
[1:21:25] everything simple song that was sung
[1:21:27] years and years ago
[1:21:28] he's not just God of the mountains he's
[1:21:31] God in the valleys
[1:21:33] that's that's where he likes to prove
[1:21:35] himself
[1:21:36] so the focus itself has always been upon
[1:21:41] him
[1:21:42] and he is the word how many know that
[1:21:44] prophets themselves are reflectors
[1:21:47] meant to reflect that Believers are to
[1:21:51] be reflectors too to reflect that life
[1:21:53] for that life to be captured and that
[1:21:55] same light and as a reflector it doesn't
[1:21:58] diminish the light but it's the same the
[1:22:00] light that would shine within the same
[1:22:03] Brilliance that would go forth and I
[1:22:05] want you to think of this in this
[1:22:07] focusing here
[1:22:08] Abraham
[1:22:09] I like how Brother Band put it in the
[1:22:11] message look and Look Away to Jesus and
[1:22:15] brother Rand will talk about Abraham's
[1:22:16] life because Abraham had had some ups
[1:22:19] and downs
[1:22:20] he had a lot of testing a lot of Trials
[1:22:23] he sometimes the tests and trials that
[1:22:25] Abraham had one of them was just waiting
[1:22:30] 25 years that was just one of them
[1:22:33] okay
[1:22:34] but so there was many things you know
[1:22:36] the other thing he had
[1:22:38] there was misunderstandings of the
[1:22:39] promise
[1:22:41] brother Brown said he focused out the
[1:22:44] misunderstandings
[1:22:46] Satan could have just no doubt stood
[1:22:48] there and said you got it wrong that
[1:22:49] time buddy
[1:22:50] but you know what he had to do Focus
[1:22:52] that out
[1:22:54] well how do you focus something out
[1:22:56] there's I can't focus out brother just
[1:22:58] way if I'm looking at him
[1:23:01] the only way I can focus him out is I'm
[1:23:03] going to have something else that I'm
[1:23:05] focused on and when I'm focused on then
[1:23:08] that gets focused out
[1:23:10] I can still see when I look at brother
[1:23:12] Trevor I can see him in my peripheral
[1:23:14] but I'm not focused on him but whoever
[1:23:16] I'm focused on I'm going to lock in and
[1:23:19] I'm going to walk towards him and the
[1:23:20] closer I get the more as I'm walking
[1:23:22] towards brother Trevor he's no longer in
[1:23:24] my peripheral any longer oh my can't you
[1:23:27] see it even or what we're focusing on
[1:23:29] we're looking sometimes at the problem
[1:23:32] instead of looking at The God Who said I
[1:23:36] am your deliverer I'm your Waymaker and
[1:23:40] keep walking towards him the test or the
[1:23:43] trial is not a time to Desert him it's
[1:23:45] not a time to leave him it's not a time
[1:23:48] to stand and say master I The Apprentice
[1:23:51] can handle this situation no but as an
[1:23:55] apprentice say you know what this is
[1:23:57] bigger bigger bigger than me
[1:24:00] this is more than what I can handle so
[1:24:03] Lord I'm going to place myself on your
[1:24:05] desk because really the real problem is
[1:24:08] not the problem it's us
[1:24:11] and so we can say Lord I put myself on
[1:24:14] the altar I put myself on the desk
[1:24:18] oh my I'd like to go on but I'm going to
[1:24:20] stop right here
[1:24:22] Abraham focused out
[1:24:25] and he focused in
[1:24:27] on the promise of almighty God
[1:24:31] this is what job job's having to do
[1:24:33] right now he's having to focus out all
[1:24:35] the distractions all the accusations
[1:24:36] everything all around him
[1:24:39] and job
[1:24:41] is standing on what God
[1:24:44] has spoke to him and what he knows to be
[1:24:48] the truth and it's a part of his life
[1:24:51] so what job
[1:24:53] job is as it mentions here in the
[1:24:55] scripture there's a preparation
[1:24:57] that's underhand there's a preparation
[1:24:59] that's that's going on even before us
[1:25:02] here even tonight
[1:25:04] and I want to walk in that preparation
[1:25:07] I want to walk in and I want the word to
[1:25:09] come and to shape me to cut cut away
[1:25:12] those things that are not pleasing to
[1:25:15] him
[1:25:16] I want I desire his grace
[1:25:19] for the trials that he sees in His
[1:25:21] Infinite Wisdom that he's permitted for
[1:25:23] my life Lord give me Grace to go through
[1:25:25] because I sure can't make it on my own I
[1:25:27] need your grace
[1:25:29] and you know the beautiful thing about
[1:25:30] it is he never forsakes us
[1:25:33] he never pulls back from us as a matter
[1:25:36] of fact through every test and every
[1:25:38] trial
[1:25:39] is if I could have kept on reading here
[1:25:41] tonight God said never said he'd take
[1:25:43] away
[1:25:44] the trials but God said when the trouble
[1:25:47] does come I'll be the strength of my
[1:25:49] people
[1:25:50] I'll be their strength I'll strengthen
[1:25:52] them I'll keep them I'll make a way for
[1:25:54] them
[1:25:55] oh my God let us not fret ourselves
[1:26:00] in that of the wicked and the wickedness
[1:26:01] but let us Delight ourselves in the Lord
[1:26:04] so you're either going to fret in the
[1:26:05] things of the world or Delight in the
[1:26:08] things of God we've got a choice
[1:26:10] well brother Sammy you don't know my
[1:26:12] situation you don't know everything
[1:26:13] that's going around I don't have much to
[1:26:15] be delighted in really
[1:26:17] where did God bring you from
[1:26:19] what did God do in your life
[1:26:21] how did God speak to your life and God
[1:26:23] has moved upon your life and drawn you
[1:26:26] will not worship him for just of where
[1:26:28] he is right now we're worshiping him for
[1:26:31] who he is
[1:26:33] delighting myself in the Lord you're
[1:26:36] talking about Heap and coals of fire on
[1:26:38] the enemy's head
[1:26:40] it may not be like you're running around
[1:26:42] and you know dancing around but there's
[1:26:44] a delight within your life and it says
[1:26:46] in the midst of it all I can be negative
[1:26:49] I could be bitter I could be
[1:26:51] exasperating in my life but instead I
[1:26:55] choose
[1:26:56] to Delight myself in the Lord
[1:27:00] and let me tell you something what you
[1:27:02] feed on
[1:27:03] you will become
[1:27:06] if you dwell on the negative well I
[1:27:08] don't watch no evil this or I don't but
[1:27:10] if you feed on negative negative
[1:27:12] thoughts negative things you're entering
[1:27:16] right into that spirit and you know what
[1:27:18] it's coming right out it's affecting
[1:27:20] your life it's affecting all the rest
[1:27:22] around you
[1:27:24] what are you saying Brothers don't enter
[1:27:26] into that spirit
[1:27:27] get into the spirit of the word
[1:27:30] the same what do you mean by in the

[1:28:21] all the distractions and focus in on the
[1:28:25] promise

[1:28:57] to that preparation
[1:28:59] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[1:29:01] of Prayer
[1:29:03] Heavenly Father
[1:29:07] Lord a question that you
[1:29:09] would place before us Lord out of these
[1:29:11] scriptures
[1:29:13] what are we preparing for
[1:29:16] Lord one thing that we can
[1:29:18] always just be able to look
[1:29:21] at our lives and where everything is
[1:29:24] that even right now Lord
[1:29:26] God we can we can even see
[1:29:29] that God even by the decisions and by
[1:29:31] things the Lord that right around us
[1:29:34] Lord
[1:29:35] it'll tell Lord what we're preparing for
[1:29:39] I pray God those in the sound of my
[1:29:41] voice those that are
[1:29:43] Lord whether here or the internet Lord
[1:29:47] May the hearts Lord as David said
[1:29:52] I thought on my ways
[1:29:54] and I turned my footsteps
[1:29:57] God I pray tonight Lord
[1:30:00] May Lord as we Ponder there's one thing
[1:30:03] for sure Lord
[1:30:04] we don't want to miss it Lord
[1:30:07] and it's not just about missing that
[1:30:09] moment but it's also about Lord God this
[1:30:12] life right here because it's true none
[1:30:15] of us want to miss that Lord there's
[1:30:17] nothing of this Earth
[1:30:20] that's worth it
[1:30:22] nothing Lord
[1:30:24] but God I pray
[1:30:26] help us help us Lord in the midst of it
[1:30:29] Lord that our lives Lord
[1:30:31] when Lord things can come Lord around us
[1:30:35] like David mentioned and spoke of Lord
[1:30:37] things that could pull and draw Upon Our
[1:30:40] emotions Lord
[1:30:42] but help us Lord I pray
[1:30:45] help us Lord
[1:30:48] God that we would focus out those things
[1:30:50] Lord
[1:30:52] and focus in on you
[1:30:55] we know Lord there's only one thing Lord
[1:30:57] to be able to focus it out we first have
[1:30:59] to focus in on you
[1:31:01] and through focusing on you everything
[1:31:03] else around Lord goes into the
[1:31:05] peripheral it's blurred
[1:31:07] it becomes the Lord not the focus of
[1:31:09] what we're looking at
[1:31:11] and what we're being drawn to
[1:31:13] Lord we realize here we're standing in
[1:31:15] this moment
[1:31:17] Lord the change of the body is upon us
[1:31:20] the Rapture we're living in this
[1:31:22] generation In This Moment Lord we're
[1:31:25] living in this time
[1:31:27] that which all have looked and waited
[1:31:30] for Lord
[1:31:32] how that Lord that live long for this
[1:31:35] time
[1:31:36] and yet here we are standing Lord in
[1:31:38] this moment
[1:31:39] God me every heart I pray be ready to go
[1:31:43] if they're not may they receive the
[1:31:45] grace Lord that God to be made ready
[1:31:49] Lord
[1:31:50] to go
[1:31:52] may you move Lord I pray Lord as you're
[1:31:54] just moving Lord God by your spirit Lord
[1:31:57] Lord any life or God any Heart Lord
[1:32:01] that's become distracted Lord
[1:32:03] which Lord with things of this earth and
[1:32:07] the cares of it Lord sometimes with
[1:32:09] things lord it's just not even sinful
[1:32:12] but can become distracting Lord if we
[1:32:16] allow it to Lord
[1:32:17] help us Lord
[1:32:19] in the simplest of way o God that
[1:32:22] everything like Abraham
[1:32:25] Abraham's focusing in on the promise of
[1:32:27] God
[1:32:28] Abraham walked in his life
[1:32:33] the closer Lord is he just drawn closer
[1:32:36] and closer to you
[1:32:37] decisions that would be made in his life
[1:32:41] would be made based on the promise
[1:32:45] your Prophet told us that Lord when it
[1:32:47] came to the separation of lot the whole
[1:32:49] basis of that decision
[1:32:53] was certainly not based on Abraham's
[1:32:55] feelings
[1:32:56] because your Prophet told us he looked
[1:32:58] in the human side of Abraham and said
[1:33:00] that bothered him real bad
[1:33:03] that he had to separate from lot it hurt
[1:33:05] him
[1:33:06] he loved lot
[1:33:08] but it was the promise
[1:33:10] that Abraham held
[1:33:13] that caused him to make
[1:33:15] the decision to separate
[1:33:19] Lord I believe father all through here
[1:33:21] Lord
[1:33:23] many times we can look at Lord where
[1:33:24] we've had to separate from Friends
[1:33:28] family sometimes Lord even things around
[1:33:30] us right now co-workers and everything
[1:33:32] else and Lord to separate sometimes it's
[1:33:35] things Lord that we even have to
[1:33:37] separate from and not come under the
[1:33:40] influence
[1:33:42] of those other things Lord
[1:33:44] sometimes Lord even the people Lord that
[1:33:46] are under the influence they don't mean
[1:33:48] bad
[1:33:49] but Lord God sometimes the Lord those
[1:33:51] Spirits Lord and the way that it can
[1:33:52] just start to work Lord every one of us
[1:33:55] know it Lord you get around the fire
[1:33:56] you're going to smell like smoke you're
[1:33:58] going to smell you've been like a round
[1:33:59] of Fire
[1:34:01] sometimes the Lord God as it comes in
[1:34:03] the workplace family on and on you get
[1:34:05] around criticism for you know it you'll
[1:34:06] start criticizing everybody else
[1:34:09] you get underneath where there's
[1:34:10] bitterness it'll affect your life
[1:34:13] oh God help us Lord
[1:34:15] May there be Lord Jesus May our lives
[1:34:18] and our hearts say Lord I don't want to
[1:34:19] be caught up in that Lord I want to be
[1:34:22] caught up in you Lord God forgive me
[1:34:25] Lord if I if we've turned that way Lord
[1:34:27] any heart here tonight I believe there's
[1:34:28] Grace sufficient right here tonight Lord
[1:34:31] God you're not here shaming us you're
[1:34:32] here to direct us Lord the Lord to help
[1:34:35] us Lord recognizing that Lord God this
[1:34:38] flesh Lord can be so easily pulled upon
[1:34:40] but I'm thankful that there is an
[1:34:43] attraction from within Lord God that
[1:34:45] substance of your own being Lord of your
[1:34:48] own self oh God the Lord you would draw
[1:34:50] Upon Our Hearts the Lord God and there
[1:34:53] is an aligning with the plan and purpose
[1:34:55] of God just say Lord forgive me I got
[1:34:58] out of Step Lord I realize that I got my
[1:35:01] eyes on the wrong things I got caught up
[1:35:03] in the wrong thing Lord God help me Lord
[1:35:06] I pray father help us Lord we need your
[1:35:10] leadership Lord
[1:35:11] traps that are all around us and like
[1:35:13] your Prophet said like a child a little
[1:35:16] toddler we would stagger right into
[1:35:18] those things but Lord we're looking to
[1:35:20] you that you would help us Lord God you
[1:35:23] never told us to walk around fearful
[1:35:25] because of traps but we are just the
[1:35:28] Lord instructed if we would just keep
[1:35:29] our eyes on you
[1:35:31] God help us Lord and I'm thankful Lord
[1:35:34] when we have fallen in a trap I'm
[1:35:36] grateful there is Grace sufficient Lord
[1:35:38] for us to get back up brush ourselves
[1:35:41] off and get back right in Step Lord
[1:35:44] thank you for your mercy tonight Lord
[1:35:47] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:52] amen what are we preparing for
[1:35:55] amen I'm getting ready to leave how
[1:35:57] about you
[1:35:58] amen
[1:35:59] amen I I'm getting ready to leave
[1:36:03] you know sometimes we look at that and
[1:36:04] say why yeah I'm too boy I can't wait
[1:36:06] for the Rapture morning no no sometimes
[1:36:08] God when he's letting you and I know
[1:36:10] are you getting ready to leave that
[1:36:11] bitterness
[1:36:13] are you getting ready to leave that
[1:36:16] see because Rapture itself is to be
[1:36:18] caught up
[1:36:19] Rapture is to be one rescued
[1:36:22] is to be delivered not as one that
[1:36:24] doesn't belong or is not fitting for it
[1:36:26] but it's how God sweeps right in that's
[1:36:28] what a rapture and you know the Rapture
[1:36:31] itself it's not going to be like some
[1:36:33] special day to where that everything was
[1:36:36] just absolutely right your breakfast was
[1:36:39] just right everything was just right you
[1:36:41] were changing the oil on the car and man
[1:36:43] everything was going perfect
[1:36:45] now as a matter of fact when God showed
[1:36:47] up to Abraham's tent Abraham and Sarah
[1:36:49] that morning had just had a spew or
[1:36:52] heated Fellowship
[1:36:56] right
[1:36:58] but it didn't stop God
[1:37:00] you see of the Rapture will be another
[1:37:02] moment in the life of the believer
[1:37:06] because the Rapture is already working
[1:37:08] in our life right now think about how
[1:37:10] many times that God already we've had
[1:37:12] our minded to do a certain thing or even
[1:37:14] a feeling about a certain thing and then
[1:37:16] hear the spirit of God will just move
[1:37:18] and turn it right around and we feel
[1:37:20] that thing man that we thought we was
[1:37:22] going to do or we thought this and this
[1:37:24] just goes maybe it's been a feeling
[1:37:26] maybe it's been something that's been
[1:37:27] built up what is that that's a power of
[1:37:30] a rapturing message that we're setting
[1:37:32] under what's it doing is catching us
[1:37:34] away so I think it's time for us to say
[1:37:37] you know what I I'm ready to leave
[1:37:40] hey man I I'm ready to leave I'm getting
[1:37:42] ready to leave not just looking in the
[1:37:44] future but even right now I'm ready to
[1:37:46] leave this behind
[1:37:48] he is my deliverer maybe you walked into
[1:37:51] church tonight and you thought how am I
[1:37:53] going to get out of this but don't worry
[1:37:55] your Romeo news jug just where you're at

[1:38:00] ladder right against the wall he's able
[1:38:02] to ascend move right down and bring you
[1:38:04] right with him and you thought how will
[1:38:06] I ever get out of this thought my mind

[1:38:11] him come
