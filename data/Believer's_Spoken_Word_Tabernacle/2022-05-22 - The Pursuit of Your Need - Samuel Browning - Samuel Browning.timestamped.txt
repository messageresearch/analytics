[10:42] i was reading in the book of luke
[10:45] the other day and it just kind of struck
[10:46] me
[10:48] when jesus was in the garden and you
[10:51] know they came to get him
[10:54] he said you know why didn't you get me
[10:56] when i was in the temple why didn't you
[10:57] take me then why didn't you get me these
[10:59] different places and uh
[11:01] he said well now
[11:03] it's your hour and it's the power of
[11:05] darkness is why you're allowed to do
[11:07] these things
[11:08] and the thought just kind of struck me
[11:10] that you know it was their hour in the
[11:12] power of darkness but that didn't stop
[11:14] the resurrection
[11:16] he still rose
[11:18] his plan still went forward even the
[11:20] things they did to him was all part of a
[11:22] a four purpose
[11:25] so i just uh that that just kind of
[11:27] struck me how even though you know god
[11:29] let them have have have the power and
[11:31] said hey this is your hour you know go
[11:33] ahead and do what you're going to do
[11:34] it's not going to stop my plan it's not
[11:36] going to stop the resurrection

[36:21] see each and every one of you
[36:23] amen we missed you last week
[36:27] amen they say a picture is worth a
[36:29] thousand words well
[36:31] but i want to say this that um
[36:33] i just um
[36:36] we're thankful you know that we have the
[36:38] ability
[36:40] just a little bit lower been a little
[36:41] bit softer for me right now
[36:43] we have just um thankful
[36:46] i thought about this for the brothers
[36:48] that have worked so diligently to be
[36:51] able to make it available to streaming
[36:53] or when we do have needs and we're not
[36:55] able to be here and be able to go back
[36:57] into the services and look at them and
[36:59] watch them and
[37:00] all the efforts that they put in for
[37:02] that and
[37:04] i just i wonder if we just couldn't give
[37:06] just a praise offering to the lord and
[37:07] at thanksgiving
[37:16] brother sean and brother
[37:18] brian have just done such a wonderful
[37:20] job and
[37:21] we just we thank god for that i thank
[37:23] god for that burden
[37:25] amen that that is there it's such a
[37:27] blessing to us
[37:29] um
[37:30] just a reminder here this coming
[37:32] thursday there won't be any service and
[37:34] preparation for the
[37:37] meetings that are coming up here this
[37:38] weekend
[37:40] and i know there's a meeting in the
[37:43] conference room
[37:44] right after the service for the sisters
[37:47] i heard that was announced
[37:49] and
[37:51] also there's announcements that we've
[37:53] posted on
[37:54] in the restrooms it's coming out to you
[37:56] email i think it's on facebook but it
[37:58] just has the breakdown of
[38:01] itinerary of everything that's taking
[38:03] place this weekend
[38:05] so what i would ask if if you would
[38:10] make yourself
[38:12] aware of those things so if someone
[38:14] comes to you and says where's that youth
[38:16] event at and and you don't look and say
[38:19] youth event
[38:21] youth event where where's
[38:24] oh we're having a fellowship dinner
[38:27] can you hear me back there
[38:29] make sure that you look over it's in the
[38:32] restroom there we're also going to have
[38:34] some copies because of the addresses so
[38:37] people can punch in the addresses for
[38:39] things that way that when we have
[38:41] visitors that are coming in here because
[38:44] from my understanding right now
[38:46] uh at least from south carolina that's
[38:48] not even including from anywhere else
[38:50] it's they're bringing a bus
[38:52] so there's a group of people coming in
[38:54] from south carolina here for these
[38:55] meetings
[38:56] so that's exciting
[38:59] amen
[39:00] you know brother branham said it like
[39:02] this when he first saw the pentecostals
[39:05] and he saw him and he began to see how
[39:07] that they were just coming together he
[39:10] said i saw him in the hotels he said
[39:11] they were just hugging one another he
[39:13] said people were so happy said they were
[39:15] spending he said parts he said you know
[39:17] they had to spend parts of their living
[39:19] to get here to a meeting he said but
[39:21] it's like there was no condemnation
[39:23] among them such love he said and
[39:25] something struck my heart and said
[39:27] i believe
[39:29] that this is just how it's going to be
[39:31] before the rapture
[39:34] bees
[39:36] swarm
[39:37] and have a revival
[39:39] amen the geese get together
[39:42] is that right before the great migration
[39:45] and we're going somewhere there's a
[39:47] there's a purpose there's a rapture here
[39:49] upon us
[39:51] and this is just a little foretaste of
[39:53] glory
[39:54] what a privilege that we have and i'll
[39:56] say as an assembly a privilege just to
[39:58] be able to host something for a few days
[40:02] to serve god's people
[40:05] i think that's wonderful
[40:07] i also want to
[40:08] make known to you if you if you don't
[40:10] know what to do
[40:12] then just say
[40:13] find out from brother aaron sister
[40:15] amanda

[40:21] damascus what would you have me do lord
[40:24] what can i do to help out what what can
[40:26] we do in any way

[46:11] lord
[46:12] in jesus precious name
[46:14] amen
[46:17] amen you love the lord
[46:20] amen if you'll turn with me in
[46:22] the scriptures to mark
[46:24] chapter 5.
[46:36] and i'm going to read if you don't mind
[46:38] here there's a few verses of scripture
[46:40] that i
[46:41] just have to read and
[46:43] draw our context from this morning
[46:47] mark chapter 5 and verse
[46:49] 21.
[46:59] and when jesus
[47:01] was passed over again by ship
[47:03] unto the other side
[47:05] much people gathered unto him and
[47:08] he was nigh unto the sea
[47:10] and behold there cometh one of the
[47:12] rulers of the synagogue
[47:15] gyrus by name
[47:16] and when he saw him
[47:18] he fell at his feet
[47:20] and besought him greatly saying
[47:23] my little daughter lieth
[47:25] at the point of death
[47:27] i pray thee come and lay thy hands on
[47:31] her
[47:32] that she may be healed
[47:34] and she shall live
[47:37] jesus went with him and much people
[47:39] followed him and thronged him
[47:41] and a certain woman which had an issue
[47:43] of blood 12 years
[47:45] and had suffered many things of many
[47:48] physicians and had spent all that she
[47:50] had
[47:51] and was nothing bettered but rather grew
[47:54] worse
[47:55] when she had heard of jesus
[47:59] came in the press behind
[48:01] and touched his garment
[48:03] for she said if i may touch but his
[48:06] clothes
[48:07] i shall be
[48:09] whole
[48:10] i want you to notice in both of these
[48:12] instances
[48:14] they knew
[48:15] if i could just get to jesus
[48:18] my case
[48:20] is settled
[48:25] that's faith
[48:26] and straightway the fountain of her
[48:29] blood was dried up and she felt in her
[48:32] body that she was healed of that plague
[48:36] and jesus immediately knowing in himself
[48:39] that virtue that strength had gone out
[48:42] of him
[48:43] turned him about in the press and said
[48:46] who touched my clothes
[48:49] and his disciples said unto him
[48:51] thou seest the multitude thronging thee
[48:54] and sayest thou
[48:56] who touched me
[48:57] and he looked around
[48:59] about to see her
[49:01] that had done this thing
[49:04] but the woman fearing and trembling
[49:06] knowing what was done in her
[49:08] came and fell down before him and told
[49:11] him all the truth
[49:13] and he said unto her
[49:15] daughter
[49:16] thy faith
[49:17] hath made thee whole
[49:20] go in peace
[49:22] and be whole
[49:23] of thy plague
[49:25] if the lord will help us i'd like to
[49:27] speak this morning on the pursuit of
[49:30] your need
[49:32] may god bless you bless the reading of
[49:33] the word as you're being seated
[49:36] pardon me i i see there's some different
[49:38] one visitors and maybe faces god bless
[49:41] you welcome
[49:42] and some of you i maybe recognize ben i
[49:45] think i recognize you
[49:48] but it's good to see each and every one
[49:49] of you amen
[49:52] this thought when we look at this the
[49:55] pursuit
[49:56] of your need and i want to just
[50:00] lay in this morning so you can see a
[50:02] direction of where i'm going is
[50:05] is when we're looking at with a need and
[50:08] we see that there's faith
[50:10] in order to receive anything from god we
[50:13] must have faith
[50:15] and i want to lay some things in this
[50:17] morning that really deal with what is
[50:19] the basis
[50:20] of faith
[50:22] and the ways and the measure and the way
[50:24] in which
[50:25] that
[50:26] need what we have need is of
[50:29] how that is obtained
[50:31] from god
[50:33] and i when we look at this the word uh
[50:36] just from our our thought the pursuit of
[50:38] our need to
[50:39] be in pursuit it's the action of
[50:41] following or pursuing someone
[50:45] or something
[50:47] and in order to pursue something
[50:49] it's got to be important to you
[50:52] it's got to be something that is worth
[50:54] following
[50:55] it's something that there is a drawing
[50:58] that's causing you to follow that
[51:00] someone or that something
[51:04] and i know that when we think of the
[51:06] word need
[51:09] when we see this the word need it means
[51:11] to require something because it's very
[51:15] essential or it's very important
[51:18] it's also circumstances in which
[51:21] something is necessary or would require
[51:24] some course of action
[51:26] it's a necessity
[51:28] and so when we think of a need and
[51:31] most of the time things that would
[51:33] accompany when we would have a need or a
[51:36] person has a need
[51:38] there is even a sense
[51:41] of urgency or desperation it comes forth
[51:45] it
[51:46] seems to come up even in the
[51:47] conversations it's things that's upon
[51:50] their mind and what's in the forefront
[51:52] because the need itself
[51:55] is what
[51:56] goes beyond
[51:57] everything else that is around us or
[52:00] life you this is what you become focused
[52:04] upon
[52:04] this need
[52:06] and so it's something when we look at
[52:09] this and i would raise this question to
[52:11] start with this and to think of it in
[52:13] this manner
[52:15] that
[52:16] with every
[52:17] need and no matter what that need is
[52:22] god
[52:23] is the satisfier
[52:27] of that need
[52:28] that's in your life
[52:31] and i want to just begin with a question
[52:33] like this that brother branham would
[52:35] pose
[52:36] in the message
[52:37] what was first
[52:39] the savior
[52:41] or a sinner
[52:43] what was first the savior or a sinner
[52:46] the savior was first
[52:49] which is more powerful savior or sinner
[52:52] if a savior can take away the sin he's
[52:55] more powerful
[52:57] well why did he let sin happen in the
[52:59] first place to show
[53:01] that he was a savior
[53:04] which was the most powerful a healer or
[53:07] a sickness a healer
[53:10] then why did he let sickness come
[53:13] to show
[53:14] that he was a healer
[53:16] oh brother bram said i feel religious
[53:18] right now
[53:19] that's why that's his
[53:22] attributes
[53:24] so when you think of that he says that's
[53:26] why he lets trouble come
[53:28] that's why he let sorrow come
[53:31] to show that he is
[53:33] joy
[53:35] that's why we got a night
[53:37] to prove
[53:38] there is a day
[53:40] that's why we got temper to show there
[53:42] is peace
[53:43] it's pro
[53:45] and con
[53:47] so the attribute
[53:49] all of this here
[53:51] for
[53:52] as a healer
[53:53] as a savior
[53:55] deliver
[53:56] all of those are attributes to meet
[54:00] our needs and those attributes were
[54:03] before
[54:05] there ever was a need
[54:08] before there ever was a sinner he was a
[54:11] savior
[54:13] is that right
[54:14] before there was ever a disease he was
[54:18] already the healer
[54:20] before there was anyone ever bound he
[54:23] was already the deliverer
[54:26] before there was anyone who was lost he
[54:29] was already the shepherd
[54:33] so before our need
[54:35] he was
[54:36] and he is all things that we have need
[54:39] of
[54:41] in psalms 42 7 david would tap in by
[54:44] inspiration a very familiar scripture
[54:47] deep calleth unto deep at the noise of
[54:50] thy spouts all thy waves and thy billows
[54:54] are gone over me
[54:56] brother branham would say it like this
[54:58] he says now if you're looking for god
[55:01] that shows that there's something
[55:04] somewhere
[55:05] here
[55:06] that you're looking for
[55:08] before there is a desire in here
[55:12] there has to be
[55:14] something
[55:15] create
[55:16] that
[55:18] desire before now look very simply
[55:22] before there was a fin on a fish's back
[55:28] before there was a fin on a fish's back
[55:31] there had to be a water first for him to
[55:35] swim in or he wouldn't have had need of
[55:38] the fin
[55:40] see it's it's only the fourth thought
[55:43] it's already been prepared
[55:46] god put that fin on him to swim in the
[55:50] water so there had to be a water first
[55:53] before there was a fin on his back
[55:56] before there was a tree to grow on the
[55:59] earth
[56:00] there had to be an earth first for it to
[56:02] grow into or there wouldn't have been no
[56:04] tree to grow
[56:06] it would make no sense simply in your
[56:08] home yard or whatever if you could want
[56:11] the most beautiful bush shrubbery tree
[56:13] but if you have no place to plan it what
[56:16] good does it do to have it
[56:18] before you go and purchase it you must
[56:20] first make sure you have room for it and
[56:22] of course a lot of times
[56:24] we
[56:25] we go ahead and say oh i realize i i
[56:27] didn't need this bush oh oh i thought i
[56:29] needed this picture here oh i didn't
[56:30] need this picture there's no more space
[56:32] to put it but
[56:33] that's us and our finite mind
[56:36] not god
[56:38] god is infinite
[56:40] god already had it planned before notice
[56:43] even in that of creation when you go
[56:45] back to genesis 1 before god ever
[56:48] brought forth the botany life the
[56:51] previous day was already made and came
[56:55] to a preparation to sustain
[56:58] the word that was to come next
[57:02] so it's we find it's a constant
[57:04] unfolding but what unfolds there's
[57:06] already been preparation that's been
[57:09] made ahead of time and that's all from
[57:11] god notice he says if there's a desire
[57:15] in the human heart for more of god how
[57:18] many have a desire for more of god
[57:21] if there's a desire in the human heart
[57:24] for more of god there's got to be more
[57:26] of god somewhere to respond to that deep
[57:30] calling to the deed
[57:32] he says now if there's something in your
[57:33] heart that tells you that there is
[57:36] divine healing in god well now before
[57:40] you could have that in your heart there
[57:42] has to be a creator to put that in your
[57:46] heart
[57:48] and and brother brown we'll go into a
[57:49] simple example that was present within
[57:52] the medical part at that time where they
[57:55] could not figure out why there was a
[57:57] little boy
[57:58] who was eating the petals off of a
[58:01] bicycle
[58:02] chewing them up and they could figure
[58:04] out what's going on and they begin to
[58:07] test and what it was is this little boy
[58:11] lacked sulfur in his body
[58:15] and the reason he was chewing on petals
[58:17] was not because he was infatuated with
[58:19] petals it's because in that pedal with
[58:23] sulfur
[58:24] now i'm going to ask you who directed
[58:27] him to that a little fella was it was
[58:30] there a scientist sitting around and say
[58:32] oh you have sulfur uh you have a need of
[58:35] sulfur let me just tell you where
[58:36] sulfur's at uh it's right here in the
[58:38] petal there was a already there was a
[58:41] desire there was a lacking in his life
[58:46] and that lacking is what was causing
[58:48] that craving but before he could ever
[58:51] have that craving there was already a
[58:54] source to satisfy it
[59:00] if there's something in the human heart
[59:02] craving divine healing
[59:05] there's a fountain open somewhere
[59:08] when he says think about it when you
[59:10] were back yonder just with a lukewarm
[59:13] experience and your heart began to crave
[59:16] for more of god there just had to be a
[59:19] fountain opened somewhere
[59:21] and god sent it and when you're craving
[59:24] for a divine healing there's got to be
[59:27] there's a creator
[59:29] putting that creation in your heart it's
[59:33] calling out deep unto the deep because
[59:36] there's a fountain
[59:37] somewhere
[59:39] so it's god
[59:41] creating that desire that longing in
[59:45] your heart for
[59:46] him he already has your need covered
[59:52] now i want to say it in this way god has
[59:55] a purpose for all his works which we've
[59:57] just been looking at this god has a
[59:59] purpose god is not an author of
[1:00:02] frustration
[1:00:04] things are not just well this is just
[1:00:06] happening because no it doesn't work
[1:00:08] that way god
[1:00:10] is a god of purpose
[1:00:13] everything from there even when we look
[1:00:16] uh from the beginning even where the
[1:00:18] stars themselves the bible says that
[1:00:21] every star it has a name it even speaks
[1:00:24] of even the constellations that are put
[1:00:26] there the scriptures were referred to in
[1:00:28] the book of micah in the book of psalms
[1:00:31] and how that the bible would say that
[1:00:33] the heavens declare the handiwork of god
[1:00:37] there's a story that is told the story
[1:00:39] of redemption is told right there right
[1:00:42] through everything of the skies and it's
[1:00:44] reflected here even in earth it's all
[1:00:47] wrote out
[1:00:48] and god is a god of purpose everything
[1:00:51] that he it does as we were looking there
[1:00:54] in genesis 1 everything is unfolding the
[1:00:58] very purpose of god let me just say it
[1:01:00] like this when you go to see a drama how
[1:01:03] many have you ever seen a drama a play
[1:01:05] before
[1:01:06] okay that drama or play it's not
[1:01:09] something that's just being ad-libbed at
[1:01:11] that moment
[1:01:13] that drama has already been wrote
[1:01:16] someone has composed it someone has
[1:01:18] thought it through
[1:01:19] and there is someone that could pick it
[1:01:21] up and they begin to identify parts for
[1:01:24] that play and when you sit there or i
[1:01:26] sat there what we begin to behold is
[1:01:29] that drama which was already wrote it's
[1:01:32] acting out the plot the scenes the
[1:01:35] villain and who all it is let me just
[1:01:37] say this this drama has been already
[1:01:40] from before the foundation of the world
[1:01:43] in the mind of god in revelations
[1:01:46] chapter 13 the scripture tells us that
[1:01:49] the lamb was land before the foundation
[1:01:52] of the world when we read isaiah 53 it
[1:01:56] says he was slain he was bruised and yet
[1:01:59] he was not even manifested on this earth
[1:02:02] as the lamb of god but isaiah 53 isaiah
[1:02:06] was picked up into the realms to see it
[1:02:09] was a finished work but that drama had
[1:02:12] to be
[1:02:13] acted out
[1:02:16] and so that's the very thing that's
[1:02:18] taking place even now it's an unfolding
[1:02:21] that's why the things as a as a believer
[1:02:23] we're not looking around to the events
[1:02:25] or things in the world and say oh my
[1:02:27] what's going on but we can see because
[1:02:30] in the the bible is a book of prophecy
[1:02:33] the bible says what have what what is
[1:02:36] hath already been
[1:02:38] the spirits and things that we see upon
[1:02:41] the earth today it was already back
[1:02:43] there in the days of sodom as it was in
[1:02:45] the days of lot and noah we we see all
[1:02:48] of this it's unfolding in this time but
[1:02:51] all while all of that wickedness and
[1:02:54] evil is unfolding there is a great
[1:02:57] reality of the righteousness of god
[1:03:00] that's being unfolded among his children
[1:03:03] in this hour
[1:03:05] we're being caught up in that
[1:03:07] in everything he does
[1:03:09] or brings to pass it's because of that
[1:03:12] which he purposed in himself
[1:03:14] second timothy chapter 1 verse 8
[1:03:17] be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:03:19] testimony of our lord nor of me his
[1:03:22] prisoner but be thou a partaker of the
[1:03:25] afflictions of the gospel according to
[1:03:27] the power of god who hath saved us i
[1:03:31] want you just to look at this verse very
[1:03:32] clear carefully who hath saved us and
[1:03:36] called us with an holy calling
[1:03:40] not according to our works
[1:03:43] but according to his own purpose and
[1:03:46] grace
[1:03:47] which was given us in christ jesus
[1:03:51] before
[1:03:53] the world began
[1:03:55] but is now
[1:03:56] made manifest by the appearing of our
[1:04:00] savior jesus christ who hath abolished
[1:04:03] death and hath brought life and
[1:04:05] immortality to light through the gospel
[1:04:09] now when you put it in in into the into
[1:04:12] that perspective this purpose and grace
[1:04:16] it was already established there in
[1:04:19] christ jesus before the foundational
[1:04:21] world the purpose that you and i are
[1:04:24] here upon this earth right here this
[1:04:27] morning was already established in
[1:04:30] christ before the foundation of the
[1:04:32] world
[1:04:33] to say it if you have eternal life or
[1:04:36] come to eternal life you always were and
[1:04:39] you were in his thinking before the
[1:04:41] foundation the world
[1:04:43] as a matter of fact brother branham
[1:04:44] would put it as simple as this he says
[1:04:46] for you there's some part in you that's
[1:04:48] eternal and that eternal only belongs to
[1:04:51] god and in god was his thinking of you
[1:04:54] setting right where you're at now in his
[1:04:56] thinking i stood at the pulpit because
[1:04:59] he's infinite and knows all things
[1:05:01] therefore he could tell the end from the
[1:05:03] beginning because he's eternal and you
[1:05:05] being a son of god or a daughter of god
[1:05:09] then you were in his thinking at the
[1:05:11] beginning and when the holy spirit come
[1:05:14] listen to this carefully when the holy
[1:05:16] spirit come and you're on earth walking
[1:05:19] around here as a sinner but way down in
[1:05:23] your life there is something
[1:05:25] you don't know what's taking place but
[1:05:28] you're hungry
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:31] who put that desire there within you
[1:05:34] sunday school teacher didn't do it
[1:05:37] pastor didn't do it
[1:05:38] god put that desire in you and that
[1:05:41] desire come from him
[1:05:46] oh my oh he says there's something in
[1:05:50] you
[1:05:51] something you never put in there it's
[1:05:54] something that you couldn't desire to be
[1:05:57] in there it's something that's contrary
[1:06:00] to your own nature
[1:06:02] it's the foreknowledge of god that's
[1:06:05] taking place
[1:06:07] think of it he says jesus was born the
[1:06:09] son of god to be emmanuel god's full
[1:06:12] expression in a man and he found him in
[1:06:16] perfect obedience down at the river
[1:06:18] jordan being baptized by that prophet
[1:06:20] and as soon as he obeyed him and walked
[1:06:22] out of the water the heavens opened to
[1:06:25] john and he saw the holy ghost
[1:06:27] descending from heaven and he said this
[1:06:29] is my beloved son perfect obedience the
[1:06:32] spirit had sought him out in obedience
[1:06:36] oh wayward man or woman this morning
[1:06:40] when you're sitting here and there's
[1:06:42] something in you telling you this is
[1:06:45] right
[1:06:46] it's the holy spirit seeking you out to
[1:06:49] bring you to a knowledge of truth of
[1:06:52] this hour that we're living in now that
[1:06:54] it's not of an hour gone by but it's a
[1:06:57] present god
[1:06:59] right now
[1:07:02] it's the holy spirit something in you
[1:07:04] that will tell you this is right
[1:07:08] what is it it's the holy spirit
[1:07:11] what's he doing he's coming to minister
[1:07:14] to the need
[1:07:16] he's coming to minister to that need and
[1:07:19] when he comes listen to me when he comes
[1:07:21] to minister to that need that need that
[1:07:23] was within our life am i trying to fit
[1:07:26] in here try to satisfy with this try to
[1:07:28] satisfy with this try to satisfy with
[1:07:31] this but when he comes along what
[1:07:33] happens is he begins to pull upon that
[1:07:36] need and you begin to recognize that
[1:07:40] this is who i have really been looking
[1:07:43] for and what i've been looking for all
[1:07:46] my life what is it grace has come to you
[1:07:49] when you or i could not find him or find
[1:07:53] our way or make sense of the need that
[1:07:55] lay in our life but god knew where you
[1:07:58] were got nowhere i was and god comes by
[1:08:01] your way he begins to stir up that need
[1:08:04] that's on the inside that only he can
[1:08:07] satisfy
[1:08:14] in genesis 1
[1:08:16] in the beginning
[1:08:19] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:08:23] period
[1:08:25] and the earth was without form and void
[1:08:28] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:08:30] deep
[1:08:31] and the spirit of god moved
[1:08:34] upon the face of the waters
[1:08:36] there's a purpose
[1:08:38] god created
[1:08:40] heavens and the earth and how this
[1:08:43] creation notice even how everything is
[1:08:45] coming into its place it's the earth
[1:08:48] even at that moment here without form
[1:08:51] it's it's void it's just it's covered
[1:08:53] over with darkness and there's just like
[1:08:55] a sign of judgment here it is but yet
[1:08:59] beneath that darkness there is seed
[1:09:02] beneath that darkness there's a purpose
[1:09:06] and beneath that darkness there's a god
[1:09:09] above it all that is going to move back
[1:09:12] the darkness and change this earth from
[1:09:16] a chaotic state lacking order and
[1:09:19] lacking purpose it's going to reveal the
[1:09:22] purpose of the earth itself
[1:09:26] who can do that but god
[1:09:30] a man of the earth was without form and
[1:09:33] what happened the spirit of god
[1:09:36] began to move
[1:09:38] it began to brood upon the earth
[1:09:41] oh brother adam would say it like this
[1:09:42] and believe in god he said do you know
[1:09:44] what how did god make the earth this
[1:09:47] earth that you're sitting on this
[1:09:48] morning
[1:09:49] people don't want to believe in faith
[1:09:52] how did god make the earth he spoke it
[1:09:55] you see it he spake and the word come
[1:09:59] into existence and this world this
[1:10:02] morning is the spoken word of god and he
[1:10:06] believed his own word
[1:10:09] are you with me now
[1:10:11] here it is watch it if god and you're an
[1:10:14] offspring of him and god is in you
[1:10:18] he will believe his own word
[1:10:21] can i read that again
[1:10:23] if god you're an offspring of him i did
[1:10:26] not become
[1:10:28] just the son of james and pat browning i
[1:10:31] was in my daddy and my great great
[1:10:33] granddaddy in my great great great great
[1:10:35] granddaddy it was all way down and let
[1:10:38] me tell you as a son and daughter of god
[1:10:40] it's not a happenstance we were in the
[1:10:44] loins of god's mind before the
[1:10:47] foundation of the world
[1:10:50] brother samuel i don't know if i can
[1:10:51] believe that if you're a believer
[1:10:54] there's something that's greater than
[1:10:56] your belief it's god's belief that
[1:10:59] begins to move in your heart
[1:11:04] i mean think about it in the days of
[1:11:06] noah when noah said it's going to rain
[1:11:10] they could shoot the moon in those
[1:11:12] places
[1:11:14] come on friends they weren't just like
[1:11:15] you know cavemen walking around with
[1:11:17] rocks and and campbell suit cams with
[1:11:19] yarn tied around
[1:11:21] they were advanced civilization
[1:11:24] is that right but to find out that that
[1:11:27] within that they could prove
[1:11:30] noah what you're preaching about there
[1:11:33] is no proof out there but noah had a
[1:11:36] greater proof
[1:11:37] than any scientific part
[1:11:41] and that proof was god had spoke to his
[1:11:44] heart and they had a choice everybody
[1:11:46] had a choice whether they wanted to
[1:11:48] believe it or they didn't want to
[1:11:49] believe it but the message that came was
[1:11:52] not for everybody it was preached as
[1:11:55] though all would be saved but god knew
[1:11:58] there was an elected part that was going
[1:12:01] to go in that ark no one ever had to
[1:12:03] make one renovation no one ever had to
[1:12:06] say you know what we need to build a
[1:12:07] bigger housing complex in this ark
[1:12:10] because there's more people than god
[1:12:12] ever intended god built the ark with the
[1:12:14] specification knowing everyone that
[1:12:17] would be there they already had a place
[1:12:20] in that ark before that ark was ever
[1:12:22] mentioned before it ever came in to
[1:12:25] manifestation their place was already
[1:12:28] there from the mind of god let me tell
[1:12:30] you something you might be wondering why
[1:12:32] you're sitting here this morning but
[1:12:34] there's already a place that's been
[1:12:37] allotted to you in jesus christ and this
[1:12:40] word that god has sent in this hour it
[1:12:43] pulls upon your heartstrings
[1:12:48] hallelujah
[1:12:49] and if god
[1:12:51] you're an offspring of him and god is in
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:54] he will believe his own word
[1:12:58] though it can't be seen
[1:13:00] felt
[1:13:01] taste or anything
[1:13:02] you'll believe it
[1:13:04] why
[1:13:06] for god
[1:13:07] in you
[1:13:09] will believe his own word
[1:13:11] then you don't look at things you see
[1:13:14] you look at things that god said
[1:13:19] the bible says in hebrews 11 3
[1:13:22] through faith
[1:13:24] we understand that the worlds were
[1:13:26] framed by the word of god now let me
[1:13:27] just begin to just move into a place
[1:13:30] here
[1:13:31] faith
[1:13:32] is not blind
[1:13:36] that's called hope
[1:13:40] faith
[1:13:41] is vision
[1:13:44] faith
[1:13:45] is sight
[1:13:46] faith
[1:13:48] has a reason
[1:13:49] faith has a purpose
[1:13:52] faith is a substance
[1:13:58] are you with me now
[1:14:00] through faith we understand
[1:14:04] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:14:06] of god so that things which are seen
[1:14:09] were not made of things which do appear
[1:14:12] romans chapter 10 verse 16
[1:14:15] think about faith here
[1:14:18] but they have not obeyed the gospel
[1:14:22] for isaiah said
[1:14:24] lord
[1:14:24] who hath believed i report think about
[1:14:28] when the lord jesus
[1:14:30] stood there
[1:14:32] his life
[1:14:33] god was confirming
[1:14:35] every word
[1:14:37] that was spoken regarding the messiah
[1:14:40] right through his life it was no longer
[1:14:42] a written a written canon of scripture
[1:14:46] but now
[1:14:47] it was flesh it was acting out
[1:14:50] it was no longer something in the drama
[1:14:52] to be
[1:14:53] it was now
[1:14:55] being acted out that part when when
[1:14:57] jesus said lord i come in the volume of
[1:14:59] the drama or the volume of the book
[1:15:01] which is written of me i come to do thy
[1:15:03] will oh god
[1:15:05] is that right
[1:15:07] to see when he stood there yet many that
[1:15:10] were reading the script
[1:15:12] they looked and they saw him and they
[1:15:14] said you're bill's above
[1:15:17] you're a chief of devils
[1:15:20] huh
[1:15:21] and they they they walk so piously so
[1:15:24] confident within their religious as a
[1:15:27] matter of fact within their life
[1:15:30] you don't read anywhere in scripture
[1:15:31] where you can get a glimpse
[1:15:33] as though that they had any need of what
[1:15:36] the messiah was
[1:15:39] what they were longing for was a messiah
[1:15:43] that would vindicate them
[1:15:47] they wanted a messiah that would match
[1:15:49] what they wanted
[1:15:52] but the messiah are you hearing me now
[1:15:54] but the messiah jesus never came to
[1:15:57] match what they wanted he came to meet
[1:16:01] the needs that were within his subjects
[1:16:08] hallelujah
[1:16:11] look at this so then faith
[1:16:14] cometh
[1:16:15] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:16:17] god so
[1:16:18] faith of the vehicle
[1:16:22] the agent
[1:16:24] by which faith comes
[1:16:26] is by hearing the word of god
[1:16:30] now there's a lot of big difference
[1:16:32] between listening at something and
[1:16:33] hearing it
[1:16:35] a person could listen to the gospel as a
[1:16:38] drunk
[1:16:38] a dope addict a prostitute
[1:16:41] all those other things and listen to it
[1:16:43] and say yeah it's true
[1:16:45] they listen to it
[1:16:46] they could hear it
[1:16:48] but when you really hear it
[1:16:50] you understand it
[1:16:51] and when you're on you say how do i know
[1:16:53] i understand it it changes your life
[1:16:57] there's a change that moves on the
[1:16:58] inside there's something that reaches
[1:17:01] down to minister to that need that
[1:17:03] you've tried to satisfy in a battle or
[1:17:05] bottle tried to find it in a woman tried
[1:17:08] to find it in a man tried to find it in
[1:17:10] a job tried to find it in a stock tried
[1:17:12] to find it in all the sorts and things
[1:17:14] but it can never ever be satisfied
[1:17:17] because there's only one and that is the
[1:17:19] living god who put that thirst in you
[1:17:22] that need and there's a pursuit for that
[1:17:26] need in your life
[1:17:28] when he comes across and begins to touch
[1:17:32] begins to stir that need up in your life
[1:17:36] so faith cometh by hearing
[1:17:38] and hearing by the word of god
[1:17:42] let me refer to one place in the
[1:17:43] scripture
[1:17:46] there was a little woman in joshua too
[1:17:49] by the name of rahab
[1:17:53] and i just want you to watch this
[1:17:55] here is the word going forth she's here
[1:17:57] in the promised land
[1:18:00] the scriptures what she begins to
[1:18:03] give account
[1:18:05] to those two spies who come in there
[1:18:07] she says
[1:18:09] we have heard
[1:18:11] all the lord
[1:18:13] has done before you
[1:18:15] we've heard about the red sea being
[1:18:16] dried up
[1:18:18] we've heard about the kings of zion and
[1:18:20] all the rest of them the bashan and all
[1:18:23] of those kings that god has brought down
[1:18:28] we've heard these things she said and
[1:18:30] our hearts have melded and neither is
[1:18:32] there courage in any man
[1:18:35] because of you for the lord your god he
[1:18:38] is god in heaven above and in earth
[1:18:40] beneath now notice
[1:18:43] everybody in jericho
[1:18:45] is hearing this
[1:18:47] they're hearing
[1:18:49] the moving and the working of the lord
[1:18:54] there's no question in jericho
[1:18:57] who is the lord
[1:19:00] and speaking of they were filled with
[1:19:03] other deities they had all gods all
[1:19:05] around there in jericho but there was no
[1:19:08] question on who was the greatest
[1:19:11] their gods were gods of walls gods that
[1:19:14] they had to pick up and put a pedestal
[1:19:16] and they had to pack their god around
[1:19:18] and put their god on the pedestal and
[1:19:21] they were the ones that made their god
[1:19:23] but how much different it was from that
[1:19:25] of the children of israel how much
[1:19:27] different it is between you and i and
[1:19:29] them because we did not make god god
[1:19:33] hath created us
[1:19:35] it is not i who have to find a place for
[1:19:37] him it is him that has found a place for
[1:19:40] me
[1:19:41] it is not i that have to pack him around
[1:19:44] he packs me around
[1:19:47] i don't have to prop him up he props me
[1:19:51] up
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:19:57] we've heard these things
[1:20:00] they all heard
[1:20:02] remember
[1:20:03] faith cometh by hearing
[1:20:05] and hearing by the word of god
[1:20:09] now they knew judgment was coming
[1:20:12] their courage in their hearts was melded
[1:20:17] right they were nervous
[1:20:19] but here's the difference
[1:20:21] rahab's hearing the same thing
[1:20:24] there's no courage that this city is
[1:20:26] going to stand
[1:20:28] but here's something that begins to move
[1:20:30] in her heart this was always there
[1:20:34] but now
[1:20:35] when it came time and the lord is moving
[1:20:38] into the land
[1:20:39] she was there behind those walls
[1:20:42] she was trapped behind those walls but
[1:20:46] she was hearing the same report and when
[1:20:50] she heard that report
[1:20:52] she asked them a question
[1:20:54] show kindness and mercy to me and to my
[1:20:58] house and give me a true
[1:21:01] token
[1:21:04] there was a reason now now here a faith
[1:21:08] that begins to move while the rest of
[1:21:10] them doubt was taking place there is a
[1:21:13] faith that begins to move within her
[1:21:17] heart
[1:21:18] and notice that faith begins to move and
[1:21:21] when these spies come there
[1:21:23] this is where then now what's already
[1:21:26] moving that longing that she's had that
[1:21:29] desire that you know where she's had to
[1:21:32] try to find it this way satisfied here
[1:21:34] satisfied there but nothing could
[1:21:36] satisfy but now when here she hears the
[1:21:39] lord is moving and it's just something
[1:21:42] that just stirs within her if i can just
[1:21:45] just get into his presence if i can just
[1:21:48] receive from him there is a need that
[1:21:51] was already in her life but now when she
[1:21:54] begins to hear it begins to stir up a
[1:21:57] pursuit of that need to where that need
[1:22:01] begins to take priority over every other
[1:22:04] need in her life and she says give me a
[1:22:07] true token
[1:22:11] she had a desire
[1:22:12] to be free
[1:22:15] i want you to think of this
[1:22:17] faith itself
[1:22:19] it's based on some
[1:22:22] reason you've got to have some reason
[1:22:26] some purpose
[1:22:28] thinking of our texts that we've read
[1:22:31] it's got to be the right motive
[1:22:35] and that reason and that motive has to
[1:22:38] be
[1:22:39] him
[1:22:42] in first peter chapter 3 verse 15 it
[1:22:44] says sanctify the lord god in your
[1:22:47] hearts and be ready always to give an
[1:22:49] answer to every man that asketh you a
[1:22:52] reason
[1:22:53] of the hope that is in you
[1:22:55] with meekness and fear
[1:22:58] so what's the reason you're doing what
[1:22:59] you're doing
[1:23:01] what's the reason you're walking as you
[1:23:03] walk
[1:23:04] what's your reason that you abstain from
[1:23:06] this
[1:23:07] what's your reason see your reason
[1:23:11] your reason
[1:23:13] it declares the faith
[1:23:15] and faith declares the reason
[1:23:18] now just listen to this because there's
[1:23:21] needs
[1:23:23] that you and i
[1:23:25] would have in our life
[1:23:26] there's no doubt setting in this
[1:23:28] congregation this morning
[1:23:30] there's lives and hearts
[1:23:32] that need
[1:23:33] to meet the lord jesus
[1:23:35] you need a savior
[1:23:37] there's lives that need
[1:23:39] the full work
[1:23:41] of redeemer
[1:23:43] and to receive the holy ghost
[1:23:45] there's live setting here this morning
[1:23:48] you see the holy spirit look savior is
[1:23:50] to save you from your sins save is to it
[1:23:54] is a repentance and it cuts off the past
[1:23:57] sin
[1:23:59] but what the holy ghost does see
[1:24:01] sanctifying comes in to cleanse out the
[1:24:04] desires and the holy spirit comes to
[1:24:07] redeem and remove anything that was ever
[1:24:12] against you not just your past
[1:24:14] but your nature
[1:24:16] your life has been changed from the
[1:24:18] inside out
[1:24:20] not a 10-step program
[1:24:23] not a five-step program
[1:24:26] but it's called meeting jesus
[1:24:27] face-to-face
[1:24:30] give me a true token
[1:24:33] hallelujah
[1:24:34] notice a reason and i hope so notice
[1:24:37] brother brandon picks this up in a
[1:24:39] paradox
[1:24:41] and he says you know
[1:24:42] of course he says you can't have faith
[1:24:46] unless you've got some reason
[1:24:49] you've got to have a reason first
[1:24:52] there's got to be a purpose
[1:24:55] just like when you come to the house of
[1:24:57] god or anything you do there's got to be
[1:25:00] a reason
[1:25:02] there's got to be a reason and what does
[1:25:04] that do when you've got a reason you've
[1:25:06] got a purpose that's faith
[1:25:08] faith must have a reason
[1:25:11] so faith isn't just something that's
[1:25:12] just well it's just it's just out here
[1:25:14] no faith
[1:25:16] has a basis
[1:25:19] you can't have faith unless you've got
[1:25:21] some reason he said i tried to say last
[1:25:23] night some people's faith is in their
[1:25:26] textbook some people's faith is in
[1:25:28] something else but depends on where your
[1:25:30] faith is
[1:25:32] i want to believe god's word what he
[1:25:33] says is true then i've got to see
[1:25:36] whether it's his will or not now let's
[1:25:37] just get down on this
[1:25:39] if it's his will i gotta check out my
[1:25:42] objective to it and then my motive in
[1:25:45] doing it
[1:25:46] my motive is your motive is what's your
[1:25:49] motivation behind it
[1:25:51] why
[1:25:53] why do you want god to give you the holy
[1:25:55] ghost
[1:25:56] why why do you want to be saved
[1:25:59] why
[1:26:01] what's the motivation behind it
[1:26:04] it would seem like that that that should
[1:26:06] not even be a non-question if
[1:26:09] that that if a person is asking for that
[1:26:11] but you see what matters is what's the
[1:26:13] reason because if there's no reason
[1:26:15] behind it no real true motive then it's
[1:26:17] not faith
[1:26:19] it will not come to pass
[1:26:22] god had a reason when he stepped forward
[1:26:25] and everything began to unfold remember
[1:26:27] this purpose and grace
[1:26:29] was in him before the foundation of the
[1:26:32] world
[1:26:33] this reason was in him he has a reason
[1:26:36] in everything that he's doing
[1:26:38] notice he says i if i do it he says if i
[1:26:42] do it and i say and ibraheem gives an
[1:26:44] example here is this okay
[1:26:47] i really just want to lay this in here
[1:26:48] this teaching he says i'm going over the
[1:26:50] mountain here there's a mountain before
[1:26:52] me there's a million people on that side
[1:26:54] perishing and i got 100 million over
[1:26:57] here i'm preaching to well if i can't
[1:26:59] get over around or under the mountain or
[1:27:01] nothing and yet something in my heart
[1:27:03] keeps telling me
[1:27:05] go over the mountain go to them go to
[1:27:08] them and i can't get it over
[1:27:11] then jesus said thou shalt move this
[1:27:13] mountain
[1:27:15] are you hearing me now
[1:27:17] there's a need who put that who put that
[1:27:19] in his heart god put that in his heart
[1:27:23] the need that we need was already there
[1:27:26] but god stirs that up because as an
[1:27:28] instrument to go preach the gospel and
[1:27:31] god says go over this mountain here
[1:27:34] and he's looking at the mountain that
[1:27:36] mountain's awful high i don't know if i
[1:27:37] can even get around i don't know if i
[1:27:38] can get through it i i don't know but
[1:27:40] he's but what it comes back to is that i
[1:27:41] didn't put that in here
[1:27:43] god put that in there then if god put
[1:27:46] that in there then i can say to this
[1:27:48] mountain be thou removed
[1:27:52] it says now the thing of it is he says i
[1:27:55] never created that and there's something
[1:27:56] created it's a before good cause
[1:27:58] paragraph 99 now the first thing he says
[1:28:00] i'll have to say well if i go over there
[1:28:02] and this side can only pay me so much a
[1:28:04] month and over here
[1:28:07] he says my motive's not right
[1:28:10] my objective's not right i will be
[1:28:12] catching it
[1:28:13] something's putting it in his heart go
[1:28:15] over there
[1:28:17] god's putting it in his heart go over
[1:28:19] there
[1:28:20] but if his motive
[1:28:22] even though god's putting in his heart
[1:28:24] if his motive's not right it's not going
[1:28:26] to work
[1:28:29] god
[1:28:30] is a very
[1:28:31] detailed
[1:28:32] god
[1:28:34] very purposeful
[1:28:36] he will not share his glory
[1:28:39] with no
[1:28:40] one now this is really where we get down
[1:28:43] to faith we're talking about coming to
[1:28:45] needs
[1:28:47] pursuit of needs
[1:28:49] he says
[1:28:50] if i go you know i go over there he says
[1:28:53] well now what if i say in paragraph 100
[1:28:55] now i don't care about the money but
[1:28:58] when i get over there someday you know
[1:28:59] what i don't care about the money but
[1:29:01] someday when i get over there the ages
[1:29:03] to come they'll pick up a great big
[1:29:05] monument and say brother branham the
[1:29:07] great missionary
[1:29:09] still
[1:29:10] my motive
[1:29:12] is not right
[1:29:15] but when i don't care if they ever know
[1:29:19] who went over there here's the key
[1:29:22] he's just in my heart
[1:29:26] then i'll speak to that mountain and
[1:29:29] it'll happen it's got to amen
[1:29:34] so in other words i'm not just coming to
[1:29:36] receive the holy ghost because everybody
[1:29:39] else is
[1:29:41] i'm not just coming through a prayer
[1:29:43] line because everybody else is
[1:29:45] i'm not just coming to the altar because
[1:29:47] everybody else is
[1:29:50] i'm not just coming you know for healing
[1:29:52] because well you know i don't know what
[1:29:54] else to do but there's got to be a
[1:29:57] reason there's got to be a purpose and
[1:30:00] that has to be him
[1:30:04] oh brother samuel i want my marriage
[1:30:06] straightened out so i'm going to serve
[1:30:07] the lord wrong motive
[1:30:10] it's true the lord jesus can either
[1:30:12] straighten out your marriage or give you
[1:30:14] grace to walk alone
[1:30:17] but we don't put those things ahead of
[1:30:19] him seek ye
[1:30:21] first
[1:30:23] the kingdom of god and all these other
[1:30:27] things
[1:30:29] shall be added unto you
[1:30:32] hallelujah the same god that rises that
[1:30:36] need within your life to cause you to
[1:30:38] pursue that need that same god can take
[1:30:42] you as an instrument as a channel as a
[1:30:45] conduit of his power his love his mercy
[1:30:48] and work on your spouse work on your
[1:30:51] family he said if i be lifted up from
[1:30:54] this earth i will draw all men unto me
[1:31:01] it's got to be about him
[1:31:06] he says see your motive
[1:31:08] and your objective depends on who you
[1:31:10] are and what business
[1:31:12] that's where the church misses it he
[1:31:13] says so far they get worked up in an
[1:31:16] emotion
[1:31:17] first thing you know in enthusiasm
[1:31:20] and you don't stop to check it back here
[1:31:23] again
[1:31:24] you check there for sure then it's thus
[1:31:26] saith the lord see whether it's right i
[1:31:28] would say it like this it would be good
[1:31:32] that even
[1:31:33] before we come to the house of god
[1:31:36] then we
[1:31:37] come with a real reason
[1:31:41] and we come with a real purpose
[1:31:44] not just showing up i wonder what i i
[1:31:46] just wonder
[1:31:48] you know i wonder how the service is
[1:31:49] going to go today
[1:31:51] that's not the right reason
[1:31:53] and you sure won't get nothing
[1:31:56] you say how do i get something because
[1:31:58] you're coming
[1:31:59] with the reason
[1:32:01] that i want to hear
[1:32:03] from him
[1:32:05] i've got needs in my life
[1:32:08] and there's something in me i want more
[1:32:11] of him see brother samuel what if
[1:32:13] there's a lot of other things that's
[1:32:15] clouded out there there can be satan
[1:32:17] would love to fill your life with
[1:32:20] earthly carnal material things that you
[1:32:24] could argue and say it's not sinful but
[1:32:27] anything that starts crowding out him or
[1:32:30] lessening that desire or your fervency
[1:32:34] it's building unbelief and doubt
[1:32:38] you want to have your life filled with
[1:32:40] things that build faith
[1:32:46] are you with me
[1:32:47] that's the reason we read our bible and
[1:32:49] we pray
[1:32:51] is to bring us into a place to be
[1:32:54] sensitive for god to speak to us
[1:32:57] not that we would be able to walk around
[1:32:59] and quote this scripture and quote this
[1:33:02] quote that's not the purpose the purpose
[1:33:05] of being in the word and being in prayer
[1:33:08] is so that we remain
[1:33:10] sensitive to him
[1:33:16] now jesus said
[1:33:19] i'm coming down here
[1:33:23] but in matthew 21 i want to finish
[1:33:24] laying this in is that okay
[1:33:27] the scripture
[1:33:28] we've read this for many times here
[1:33:30] jesus has come
[1:33:32] verse 18 in the morning as he returned
[1:33:33] into the city he hungered and when he
[1:33:35] saw a fig tree in the way he came to it
[1:33:37] and found nothing there on but leaves
[1:33:39] only
[1:33:40] and said unto it let no fruit grow on
[1:33:42] thee henceforth forever and presently
[1:33:43] the fig tree withered away this listen
[1:33:46] to me now it wasn't even the time for
[1:33:47] this fig tree to have fruit on it
[1:33:50] but it had a false representation
[1:33:54] leaves were still on it
[1:33:56] are you hearing me shouldn't have been
[1:33:58] any leaves on it but the leaves were a
[1:34:00] false representation because when the
[1:34:02] leaves are on the trees he knew when
[1:34:04] leaves are there there ought to be fruit
[1:34:08] that's why in this hour when the holy
[1:34:10] spirit would send the word he's seeing
[1:34:13] things he saw things among the churches
[1:34:15] and he's looking will i find faith upon
[1:34:18] the earth will i find fruit what's he
[1:34:20] doing this is the season for fruit this
[1:34:24] is the season let us be glad and rejoice
[1:34:27] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[1:34:29] this is the season for the rapture this
[1:34:32] is the season of the fullness of the
[1:34:34] holy ghost this is the season where the
[1:34:37] root where the fruit is ripening in the
[1:34:40] top of the tree you see an expectation
[1:34:43] for this hour
[1:34:46] and when it came among the churches the
[1:34:48] church just says we're rich
[1:34:51] we're increased with goods
[1:34:53] we have
[1:34:55] need
[1:34:57] of nothing
[1:35:03] and they put him
[1:35:05] out of the church
[1:35:07] now i ask you this question
[1:35:09] if jesus is on the outside of the church
[1:35:12] pray tell me who's being worshipped on
[1:35:14] the inside
[1:35:17] the scriptures tell spelled that out
[1:35:19] very clearly
[1:35:22] is that right
[1:35:24] it's not worshiping god
[1:35:28] you hearing me
[1:35:32] verse 20 when you when the disciples saw
[1:35:34] it
[1:35:35] they marveled saying how soon is the fig
[1:35:37] tree withered away
[1:35:38] and jesus said unto them verily i say
[1:35:40] unto you if you have faith notice if you
[1:35:42] have faith
[1:35:43] and doubt not you shall not only do this
[1:35:46] which is done to the fig tree
[1:35:48] but also if you shall say unto this
[1:35:49] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:35:52] cast into the sea it shall be done
[1:35:54] and all things whatsoever ye shall ask
[1:35:57] in prayer believing
[1:36:00] you shall receive
[1:36:03] believing what's believing
[1:36:06] it's faith
[1:36:08] how do
[1:36:09] what do we have faith we've got a reason
[1:36:12] i've got a reason for asking for my
[1:36:14] healing
[1:36:15] i've got a reason for asking for the
[1:36:16] holy ghost
[1:36:18] i've got a reason for asking for
[1:36:19] deliverance
[1:36:21] are you with me there's a reason i'm not
[1:36:23] just haphazard i'm a reason you see when
[1:36:26] there's a reason when there's a reason
[1:36:28] you ever heard you heard people speak
[1:36:30] about other people and say man they're
[1:36:31] driven
[1:36:32] man they're focused
[1:36:34] man they're intense
[1:36:36] come on you know
[1:36:38] man they're just this is all they can
[1:36:39] talk about you know why that's what's on
[1:36:41] their mind that's what's number one
[1:36:43] that's what's focused
[1:36:46] and that's that's when god begins to
[1:36:48] deal with the heart
[1:36:50] and where your need of him
[1:36:53] it becomes greater
[1:36:55] than every other need
[1:36:57] in your life
[1:36:59] brother samuel it's not there yet but
[1:37:01] you keep feeding
[1:37:05] that need
[1:37:06] he put that there
[1:37:08] and the pursuit of that need
[1:37:10] he satisfies
[1:37:12] that need
[1:37:15] let me just close or bring this in this
[1:37:18] moment
[1:37:19] jesus said
[1:37:21] this is the confidence in first john 5
[1:37:23] 14. this is the confidence that we have
[1:37:25] in him that if we ask anything according
[1:37:27] to
[1:37:28] his will
[1:37:29] he heareth us
[1:37:31] and we know that he hear us whatsoever
[1:37:33] we ask if we know that we have the
[1:37:36] petitions
[1:37:37] we know that we have the petitions that
[1:37:39] we've desired
[1:37:40] of him
[1:37:45] let me just let me just
[1:37:48] abraham says this is our promise then
[1:37:51] in the message inspiration
[1:37:53] it's just our faith in doing what he
[1:37:55] said when he said ask the father
[1:37:56] anything in my name and i'll do it
[1:37:57] whatsoever he asked in my name you shall
[1:37:59] have
[1:38:01] kind heavenly father and his kindness
[1:38:03] has given us this privilege of having
[1:38:05] what we would want or desire as long as
[1:38:08] it's in his will of course
[1:38:10] and we know when it's his will
[1:38:13] if it's according to the word then we
[1:38:15] know it's his will
[1:38:17] how many believe it's his will for
[1:38:18] healing
[1:38:20] that's his word
[1:38:22] if it's his word it's his will
[1:38:25] are you hearing me now there's no
[1:38:26] question if it's his word
[1:38:29] if if his word says repent and be
[1:38:32] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:38:34] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:38:36] ghost that's his word
[1:38:39] that's his will
[1:38:42] are you with me
[1:38:44] so we know that's his will
[1:38:47] we know when we ask according to his
[1:38:49] will now brother graham steps back in
[1:38:51] the same message and he's talking about
[1:38:53] the first thing that i always try to
[1:38:55] find out was whether it's god's will or
[1:38:58] not to do a certain thing
[1:39:00] and then test
[1:39:02] my motive
[1:39:04] towards doing it
[1:39:06] if i have no selfishness
[1:39:10] nothing
[1:39:11] and i know it's god's will and i'm doing
[1:39:13] it for that
[1:39:16] purpose
[1:39:17] everybody say purpose
[1:39:19] because it's his will he won't fail you
[1:39:22] then so my purpose my reason must be
[1:39:26] because it's his will
[1:39:30] not because
[1:39:32] man if i could you know
[1:39:34] stop blind so much i'd be a better
[1:39:35] business guy
[1:39:38] i could stop cheating so much i'd be a
[1:39:40] better husband
[1:39:42] man if i could just if i could just get
[1:39:44] her get rid of these prescription drugs
[1:39:46] that dope me up you know i i would think
[1:39:49] more clearly i'd be a better daddy all
[1:39:51] those are good things
[1:39:53] but it's got to be according to his will
[1:39:58] what's the motive and the reason behind
[1:40:01] it
[1:40:02] the reason and the motive it must be
[1:40:04] about him
[1:40:06] lord i need
[1:40:08] you
[1:40:09] i need healing i need deliverance i need
[1:40:15] freedom i need you it's about you lord
[1:40:20] not about my status in society not about
[1:40:23] making my business better not about me
[1:40:26] it can't be about me it can't be about
[1:40:29] you it's got to get to a place to where
[1:40:32] the need itself is greater than any
[1:40:36] other need
[1:40:44] if it's his will
[1:40:46] and you've got a selfish motive in it
[1:40:49] it's just the same as it not being his
[1:40:51] will
[1:40:52] it won't
[1:40:54] work
[1:40:57] that's why i've said
[1:40:59] you could take and bear with me a moment
[1:41:01] you could take hundreds of young people
[1:41:04] older or whatever
[1:41:07] and they can come
[1:41:08] for the holy ghost
[1:41:10] but if they're not coming for
[1:41:11] really the right reason
[1:41:14] they're not going to receive it
[1:41:20] are you hearing me
[1:41:21] think back to our texts now
[1:41:24] it's not just with the holy ghost i i
[1:41:26] hope this is
[1:41:27] i don't just hope i know
[1:41:29] god woke me up early and put these
[1:41:31] things
[1:41:34] there's needs setting right here
[1:41:36] this morning
[1:41:38] needs throughout all this building
[1:41:41] i'm certain of that because we've come
[1:41:42] together because we're a needy people
[1:41:49] i'm not strong on my own neither are you
[1:41:51] our source of strength is in the lord
[1:41:57] but the same when it comes to
[1:41:58] deliverance it comes for healing
[1:42:00] it's got to be our need our reason
[1:42:05] i'm not going to read this quote this
[1:42:06] morning but can i refer to it very
[1:42:08] quickly
[1:42:09] brother branham if you haven't listened
[1:42:11] to the message i have heard but now i
[1:42:13] see listen to that over the next few
[1:42:14] weeks
[1:42:15] and brother braham is dealing with this
[1:42:18] he says you want god to heal you
[1:42:21] why
[1:42:23] why do you want god to heal you
[1:42:25] so you can continue to live the way that
[1:42:27] you've been living
[1:42:31] or do you want god to heal you
[1:42:33] so that you could serve him
[1:42:35] you could serve him better
[1:42:38] what's the reason
[1:42:40] everybody wants to be well is that right
[1:42:42] my goodness when a couple weeks ago when
[1:42:44] i you know for that day or those 12
[1:42:46] hours whatever
[1:42:48] man i was i just started praying for
[1:42:50] others in need just started praying for
[1:42:52] others
[1:42:53] you want to be well you it feels you
[1:42:54] come back to that man i want to feel
[1:42:56] good again
[1:42:57] right
[1:42:58] i want to be able to try to keep
[1:42:59] meetings and appointments that i've made
[1:43:01] and things like that and you're
[1:43:02] wondering man am i going to be able to
[1:43:03] do it the next day everybody there's not
[1:43:05] one person in here that doesn't like to
[1:43:07] feel well
[1:43:09] and i'm not only talking about in your
[1:43:11] physical body i'm talking about even in
[1:43:13] your mind
[1:43:14] and emotionally
[1:43:16] and in the greatest
[1:43:18] greatest healing of all
[1:43:20] your soul
[1:43:24] there's a pursuit of a need
[1:43:27] and let's just just just pause this here
[1:43:30] and come back to our text for a moment
[1:43:33] here was a man
[1:43:34] by the name of jairus
[1:43:37] ruler of a synagogue he had a nice
[1:43:39] position
[1:43:41] a matter of fact what was surrounding
[1:43:42] him
[1:43:44] they wanted nothing to do with jesus
[1:43:48] but there was something already in
[1:43:49] jairus heart
[1:43:51] that was placed there
[1:43:54] and when he began to hear
[1:43:56] about jesus there were things that began
[1:43:58] to stir up in his heart
[1:44:01] but god allowed a situation to arise
[1:44:05] that would force
[1:44:07] that need
[1:44:08] to the forefront
[1:44:14] what grace
[1:44:16] grace
[1:44:17] i'm sorry what grace
[1:44:21] what grace came to me what grace came to
[1:44:23] you
[1:44:25] the need that i had the need that you
[1:44:27] had
[1:44:29] for the lord and god allowed a situation
[1:44:31] i know
[1:44:32] sometimes
[1:44:34] people can come we can come into
[1:44:36] situations that are bitter
[1:44:37] that are hard
[1:44:39] situations that could turn people and
[1:44:41] question why god why did you do this why
[1:44:42] did you take this one why did you
[1:44:44] situations could come in their way but
[1:44:46] what grace is given
[1:44:49] when god can move down and there's a
[1:44:51] need that's already there and god begins
[1:44:53] to speak to that need and it causes that
[1:44:55] need that's been there the whole time to
[1:44:58] come to the forefront
[1:45:01] lord
[1:45:02] it's you that i need
[1:45:05] something begins to pulsate in your
[1:45:06] heart he's all i need
[1:45:09] this is what i need this is what i've
[1:45:10] been longing for he's the one this is it
[1:45:13] right here i'm finding something i'm
[1:45:15] finding that which is touching my life
[1:45:21] jairus don't you go down there
[1:45:24] you know your friends will unfriend you
[1:45:28] they'll take you off of that twitter
[1:45:30] account
[1:45:32] like other people
[1:45:35] they'll do all of that
[1:45:37] but jairus said
[1:45:39] too late
[1:45:41] you see at one time listen to me now he
[1:45:43] had that need that was there the whole
[1:45:46] time down in his heart he knew that
[1:45:48] jehovah was still a god of miracles
[1:45:52] but khan allowed a situation to come to
[1:45:55] where that need it came to the forefront
[1:45:58] in his life
[1:45:59] and at one time all that pressure he had
[1:46:02] what am i going to do what if they get
[1:46:04] rid of me at the synagogue what if my
[1:46:05] friends don't like me what if this one
[1:46:07] happens what if my husband what if my
[1:46:09] wife one of my associates on the job
[1:46:11] what are all all those things around and
[1:46:13] what happens that need begins to rise to
[1:46:16] where that means more to him
[1:46:20] than any associates
[1:46:22] his daughter is at the point of death
[1:46:26] and he makes his way someone says jairus
[1:46:30] jesus has just landed on the shores
[1:46:34] jairus is gone
[1:46:37] he's desperate
[1:46:39] there's a need
[1:46:42] and he's in pursuit
[1:46:44] of that need
[1:46:47] he doesn't even think about what would
[1:46:49] be the chances or the odds that i'll get
[1:46:52] to him he's not even thinking about that
[1:46:56] because faith is finding an unseen
[1:46:59] source
[1:47:01] he's moving into a channel and he gets
[1:47:04] to the lord jesus that's a that's a
[1:47:06] miracle
[1:47:07] that's a paradox out of the crowds that
[1:47:09] are around
[1:47:11] and he gets there and says
[1:47:15] the bible says this he besought him
[1:47:20] greatly come to my house
[1:47:23] lay your hands on my daughter
[1:47:26] and not she might
[1:47:28] she shall be well
[1:47:32] what was he doing saying to this
[1:47:34] mountain
[1:47:35] be thou removed
[1:47:38] and on the way here's a woman 12 years
[1:47:42] 12 years she's had an issue of blood
[1:47:44] she has spent her money
[1:47:47] for physicians to help her nothing wrong
[1:47:49] with doctors
[1:47:50] thank god for doctors
[1:47:54] but those physicians
[1:47:56] couldn't help her
[1:47:58] maybe they gave her all sorts of pills
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:01] all sorts of tests and everything and
[1:48:04] she no doubt would leave this time
[1:48:07] lord
[1:48:08] i trust this works
[1:48:11] i trust this works
[1:48:13] i'm trusting you lord
[1:48:15] you know like when you take your
[1:48:16] medicine you should pray over it
[1:48:19] right
[1:48:22] it didn't work
[1:48:25] 12 years she suffered
[1:48:28] but then the bible says she heard
[1:48:31] about jesus
[1:48:34] she heard
[1:48:35] about him who
[1:48:37] he
[1:48:38] is
[1:48:40] and she said in herself
[1:48:44] if i can touch him
[1:48:47] it's over
[1:48:49] if i can get to jesus
[1:48:51] it's over
[1:48:55] and she made it
[1:48:59] what was it
[1:49:00] the pursuit
[1:49:02] of her need
[1:49:04] and her need
[1:49:06] his need
[1:49:08] your need
[1:49:10] my need
[1:49:11] is him
[1:49:14] let's pray heavenly father
[1:49:19] lord in this
[1:49:21] audience and congregation of
[1:49:28] people this morning over children of god
[1:49:31] brothers and sisters of light precious
[1:49:32] faith

[1:49:44] now lord
[1:49:48] as faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:49:50] by the word of god
[1:49:53] lord there's one thing that we strive
[1:49:56] and we
[1:49:57] is the very purpose of all of our life
[1:50:00] is that the word of god
[1:50:02] would have the preeminence here lord
[1:50:06] is that lord jesus
[1:50:09] that you were just lord
[1:50:12] it would be your word it's not a
[1:50:14] it's not a fanaticism
[1:50:16] it's not an emotion
[1:50:19] but god the word of god
[1:50:23] the spirit of god coming upon the word
[1:50:26] and speaking that word to our hearts and
[1:50:28] something begins to speak on the inside

[1:50:40] this is
[1:50:42] what you've been longing for
[1:50:46] that of the holy spirit lord
[1:50:49] moving down
[1:50:51] to minister
[1:50:52] to these needs lord

[1:50:58] there's many needs
[1:51:00] we all have need of you lord and that's
[1:51:02] just not something we just say it's the
[1:51:04] truth
[1:51:07] lord there's need

[1:51:10] physically in our bodies
[1:51:14] there's need lord god for healing

[1:51:40] now lord as your word has declared
[1:51:43] when they
[1:51:46] made their way into the house that day
[1:51:47] and some of them couldn't get into it
[1:51:49] but
[1:51:50] there was four of them that carried a
[1:51:51] man and they took the roof off of that
[1:51:53] place and lowered him
[1:51:55] right where you were standing
[1:51:58] the bible says that
[1:52:00] you were present
[1:52:02] to heal them
[1:52:05] the lord
[1:52:07] there's no amount of words alone that
[1:52:09] can take away suffering
[1:52:12] there's no words alone that can bring
[1:52:14] healing
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] but you father you are the word
[1:52:20] and lord your presence your spirit
[1:52:22] brooding even right now
[1:52:25] you're here
[1:52:27] to cause those needs lord in that life

[1:52:31] already here
[1:52:34] but lord i pray
[1:52:37] that may there be lord there's needs
[1:52:39] that rose to that place this morning

[1:52:57] reason

[1:53:03] before there ever was a fin on a fish's
[1:53:05] back there was water to swim in
[1:53:08] before there was ever a tree
[1:53:10] made to grow there was an earth prepared
[1:53:12] for it to grow in
[1:53:15] before there was a need in your life for
[1:53:18] a savior
[1:53:19] he was already a savior
[1:53:22] before there was a need for a deliverer
[1:53:25] he was already a deliverer
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:29] why don't you just let him minister to
[1:53:31] your need this morning

[1:53:59] god

[1:54:02] place to walk

[1:55:44] bring liberty it brings freedom
[1:55:48] and when we can look and recognize
[1:55:51] that lord there's nothing wrong with
[1:55:52] your word
[1:55:54] there's things lord that we can look
[1:55:56] back and say maybe my motive just wasn't
[1:55:58] right my objective just wasn't lying but
[1:56:01] i'm so glad
[1:56:03] i'm so glad
[1:56:04] that we can look to you and pray and say
[1:56:06] lord don't let me go until my motives
[1:56:09] right lord
[1:56:10] let my motive be lined with your motive
[1:56:13] lord
[1:56:15] lord i want the word to keep working on
[1:56:17] my life i'm going to keep feeding on the
[1:56:19] word like david said i've set the lord
[1:56:21] always before me i want the word to so
[1:56:23] move and to deal and change and move in
[1:56:26] my life lord to where every motive and
[1:56:28] objective is lined up with the will of
[1:56:30] god
[1:56:32] granted lord we pray
[1:56:35] for the pursuit
[1:56:37] of our need
[1:56:40] in jesus precious me
[1:56:42] amen
[1:56:44] amen if you'd like to stand and
[1:56:47] change our position of seed but
[1:56:50] let's just worship him let's just allow
[1:56:53] just the water of the holy spirit just
[1:56:55] to come down upon that seed a seed has
[1:56:57] went forth a word has went forth
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:03] things like this when you see brother
[1:57:05] branham would take in many different
[1:57:07] places and there's times
[1:57:09] because when we speak about faith and
[1:57:11] there's
[1:57:12] it gets really down
[1:57:14] it moves away all the confusion moves
[1:57:16] away everything else it takes away
[1:57:18] frustration
[1:57:19] when we can see that part what's the
[1:57:21] motive what's the objective it's god's
[1:57:23] will
[1:57:24] now what's my motive in it
[1:57:26] what's my objective in it
[1:57:28] and when we can stop back to that place
[1:57:30] to where
[1:57:31] it's just about him
[1:57:34] that's what it's about
[1:57:37] you know you can ask god to bless your
[1:57:39] business you can ask god to bless
[1:57:42] the things that you're doing
[1:57:44] that's not sinful
[1:57:46] you can ask god
[1:57:48] because god promised he would do that
[1:57:50] and when you do it with that manner that
[1:57:52] lord
[1:57:53] because i want you to be glorified i
[1:57:56] don't want none of these things to be a
[1:57:58] distraction
[1:57:59] i want to be focused on you
[1:58:02] lord you're my provider you're the one
[1:58:03] that provides my meat you're the one
[1:58:06] that provides my clothing you're the one
[1:58:08] that provides lord
[1:58:10] i'm asking for your blessing that's not
[1:58:11] sinful
[1:58:13] i know that there's things that where
[1:58:14] people in the world and things has been
[1:58:16] taken in that way and oh you know naming
[1:58:18] and claiming and you know god will give
[1:58:20] you a bmw that's foolishness
[1:58:24] there's principles in god's word
[1:58:27] but our our purpose in everything why do
[1:58:30] we ask god listen god's just not in the
[1:58:33] healing business
[1:58:34] he said beloved
[1:58:36] i would that thou would just prosper in
[1:58:40] health
[1:58:42] even as thy soul doth prosper
[1:58:45] sometimes i wonder if we're praying so
[1:58:48] much for healing and saying god lead me
[1:58:50] in the right healthy way
[1:58:53] that got quiet
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] lord help me because your word said you
[1:58:58] would then i would be in health why why
[1:59:00] would you want to be in health
[1:59:04] why would you want just like one of the
[1:59:06] first times when they came about my back
[1:59:08] and they said oh you know you're backing
[1:59:09] your discs and things in your back you
[1:59:11] know 19 years ago i looked at and i
[1:59:14] filled this prescription bottle tylenol
[1:59:16] for i turned it around the side and it
[1:59:18] said may cause drowsiness so i ain't
[1:59:20] taking that
[1:59:21] i'm not against medicine
[1:59:23] but i told my wife i said if i take that
[1:59:26] then i'm not going to be able to study
[1:59:28] i said i'm going to study because god
[1:59:30] has called me to preach his word
[1:59:33] i didn't take it i did not refuse to
[1:59:35] take it because i was bigger than that
[1:59:37] but there was a purpose there was a
[1:59:39] reason
[1:59:40] that was about him
[1:59:43] not about me if i've got to get a
[1:59:45] recliner and prop up my leg so that pain
[1:59:47] that fire going down my leg i will do
[1:59:49] that
[1:59:51] and we did that for that time
[1:59:53] but a reason
[1:59:55] it's a reason so when we're praying for
[1:59:57] things what's our reason
[1:59:59] it's about him
[2:00:02] we can let it get to that place where
[2:00:03] it's single where it's about him
[2:00:05] lord bless my marriage lord that you
[2:00:09] would be the center lord
[2:00:11] the unseen one in our home lord god
[2:00:14] bless our marriage in such a way to
[2:00:16] there's such a love and atmosphere of
[2:00:19] the holy spirit pharaoh god to where
[2:00:22] when we fail one another we're mistakes
[2:00:24] where we let one another down in our
[2:00:26] human instrumentality there's such grace
[2:00:29] and such love
[2:00:33] that you're glorified that when it's all
[2:00:35] said and done whenever people are saying
[2:00:38] how do you have a marriage like that you
[2:00:39] can say it's because of jesus
[2:00:44] how you're able to face these things all
[2:00:46] this is coming upon the job and this is
[2:00:49] happening this happened and you can say
[2:00:50] because i've asked god that god would
[2:00:53] bless the works of my hands that god
[2:00:55] would lead me and god would guide me
[2:00:57] because he promised he'd take care of me
[2:01:02] oh so you're wanting a you're wanting
[2:01:04] this you're wanting that no
[2:01:07] nothing wrong with having other desires
[2:01:09] and having dreams but there's one thing
[2:01:11] that i want i want him
[2:01:14] above everything else
[2:01:15] i want him to be glorified i want my
[2:01:18] life to be lived in such a way that
[2:01:19] there's no entanglements of the world
[2:01:23] what is it it's a need that's rising in
[2:01:26] our life
[2:01:27] that's what the rapture is in the heart
[2:01:29] of a believer it's rising above every
[2:01:32] other need
[2:01:34] [Music]
[2:01:36] it's the pursuit
[2:01:38] of that need
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] i say oh god
[2:01:43] let us move with that real reason
[2:01:45] let us move with that real purpose
[2:01:48] let us set our sights our affections on
[2:01:51] things above let us move in that lord
[2:01:55] do you love him
[2:01:58] amen
[2:01:59] pray over those things
[2:02:01] pray for him
[2:02:03] god we want you to bless our church
[2:02:06] we want you to pour out your spirit lord
[2:02:08] god
[2:02:09] we want you to move among us lord we
[2:02:11] want you to save lord and lord our young
[2:02:13] people we want you lord god to deal with

[2:02:27] peace that same joy that same reality
[2:02:30] where i once was
[2:02:32] that they come to know you lord
[2:02:35] then it's about him
[2:02:37] not about how well you know the message
[2:02:39] or how well you can explain the
[2:02:40] scriptures that'll never win anybody
[2:02:44] the bible says be will be able to give a
