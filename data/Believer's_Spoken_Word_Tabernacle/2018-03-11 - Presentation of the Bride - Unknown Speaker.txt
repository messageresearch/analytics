of returning back to our inheritance there's been all of the promise been called to the rest day after day but all here we stand in the in the very brink any moment any moment I was just thinking the other morning you know many times I'm sitting there and you know I'm looking at things and I know it's sometimes it ain't the light because it's still dark and I'm just sitting there in the living room and just listening to a message and you just see something and you're looking at the window I thought I said Lord wouldn't this be wonderful if you come today I said oh wouldn't had just be wonderful I believe that unless I really believe that you know brother George Smith when he was here he referred to that that part where when sister media was really missing her mother and he mentioned that party said she's sitting right there in that chair and you know the thing of it is is that we we know we don't talk to them but to think of that reality that they are closer they're closer and they're they're getting closer but it's not just them getting closer we're getting closer it's God bringing us right into that place that that what he already has made a way for me I'll tell you I know it's simple but it's just to me it just so swallows my heart up and I feel my heart just get so big to really to think about it that it is God who sought us out God already made the Covenant was already made and he came and drew us unto himself and the Covenant being fulfilled is not about what we're gonna do it's what he has already done the only thing he needs us to do is just get out of the way and surrender I'd say lord help me help me just to be more surrender just so that life can flow through and you know one thing about it I love and how that truly the the message of the hour brought such a true portray of the Lord Jesus Christ he's a gentleman he's a gentleman he know he knows how to treat his wife in that wonderful he knows how to woo her and bring her into that place he doesn't demand her and say now you've got to be yielded know he knows how to woo her in that wonderful oh my it's so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and we had such a wonderful service last night and my I just so thankful for the presence of the Lord the word that came forth I just want just to share a few slides with you before we take the mission offering just so you have a little bit of an idea v what we're looking at with a project here and if they would pull that up d do you have that there I just wanted to show you you're aware that within the Philippines there's thousands of islands that are there I'm not going to try to give the exact number but I want to hone in to the area that we that really the need is is for if you go to the next slide you see right here is it starts to hone in a little bit more out of Manila and it's actually gonna be in this area right up in here what we're actually looking at go to the next one would you please and that hones right in and this is that Salim eylem island here that we brother Gerry myself had and went to and ministered there that evening and we just took a boat or ferry from the mainland and went out there and and ministered and there's brothers from from Ty Ty and palawan that are actually gonna be working on this boat go and go to the next slide there you see what are the boats that only the only transportation to that island of too lame there is is by boat and it's when they get there to that Island you can kind of see how the mountainous it is go to the next slide and the where it is is we went in one place over here I don't know exactly where it's at but the one little brother who's actually taken over a church where that another pastor used to go over this island but that other pastor also there was a boat that was there he could do it this little this little brother brother VIN brother then actually he actually will walk over these mountains and get to the other places but it you know that also takes it takes quite at a time so he's walking right now in doing that and one of the things that was expressed it's not just for brother VIN but you've got so many congregations because there's this looks like one big island but there's so many multiple little islands that that map doesn't even show it around - Liam Island and they have so many needs to baptize souls that have come in through the Expos plus there's a need to follow up with these churches that have all come in and so that that's the whole purpose with the boat so that they're able to get around a little bit more quickly and efficiently to try to take care of these needs and there's it's not brother o L himself that's the one going out he's actually trained brothers to actually go in and so those brothers along with brother ven they're branching out and making their ways into these places to follow up as well so go to the next slide this is the boat the boat itself now you know if I looked at a boat like this there's no way that I'd go out in it they're not gonna go out in a boat like that either but what it is this back in the first part of December there was a storm and then they were actually able to secure this boat and that boat it itself what was already it was already being used and the brothers that are there from Titan palawan they actually are gifted to be able to work with even building a boat they even told me we can build one from scratch if we have the money they're a gifted to work with that fiberglass and things like that so the purpose is this - - actually they're rebuilding this boat right here and it's 1,400 dollars to take care of that that need in order to to get that out and make it usable for the Brethren if you go to the next slide this is just a picture if you remember from when from when we were traveling to the island off of - Liam this is a little bit bigger of a boat obviously and it has the tarp over and things like that but that one is not quite that big but you can kind of see there's it's not plush seats in that boat at all it's a little itty bitty benches and you're looking down through BIM bamboo strips below and you can see the water coming in the boat and how they've kept the pump taking it out so you're just looking at it you you know you don't look at those things you look away and say I'm just trusting the pump we'll take it away but so I don't think I have another slide out their sister Tabitha at all okay yeah so you see them coming into the port there of - Liam Holloman just one of the ports right there and and they usually have these are the boats obviously that where you they taxi them in and out and you've got a couple guys working that that boat that we're looking at to help them be able to obtain that that's something that the brothers themselves will just be taken that boat in around in those mission trips into those islands and things you know the thing is I certainly want to say that we certainly appreciate the faithfulness and what God has allowed us to be able to do what little part that we can have it's it's a blessing that we can even that we can have a little part and you know to them that boat itself well that that boat would be like just imagine maybe somebody here having a Cadillac or something it's what it means to them it's not just a boat but what it means is is that the gospel itself they're gonna be able to cover more territory and getting that in getting the word out so we're just we're thankful for that and you know there's follow-up we know that from the scripture when there's there's the groups that come in and there's such a need for for follow-up and taking them on in into the word and you know you can look at things that will just hand them a book but that that won't in the scriptural way the scriptural way is you go preach the gospel and then you've got men that God would put in there to actually follow up and find out how many times Paul would send Titus and Timothy and different ones what would he send them to do go check up on the churches go see how things are going see how the Brethren are moving along and and I believe with all my heart friends that if as lives are getting really positioned in the word and that message is really taking heart within people's lives I believe that that same angel of the Lord he never left us that same manger the Lord is here to lead us he's he's the one that's directing the Church of the Living God that the the ministry of the Prophet it brought us back to that realization that he's still the same Living God and I'm thankful for that bringing it right back that that as the Holy Spirit himself he is the prophet of the hour aren't you glad for that he is the prophet of the hour he still revealing his word he's still saving the lost he's still filling with the Holy Ghost he's still the same God and you know what we're not getting out of here any sooner until each one that is a part in that Lamb's Book of Life to that last name has been splashed beneath the Clorox bleach we're getting close but until that time we're gonna keep on pressing blood Brent said it like this in 1965 he says he's up in Washington he said I don't know he said that last one might be one over there in Africa he said it might be one over here he said but the church itself will keep slugging along you know slugging along it isn't that everything is it's we're gonna keep pressing there's all kinds of opposition and tide but remember it's not us it's that force behind us God's determined to fulfill his word and he is gonna have a bride he does have a bride amen you love him this morning we just want invite the brothers if they'll just come and we want to lift the the the mission offering this morning and then I'm just gonna turn the service right over to brother Jeff and I want to say it's just been such a privilege to have brother Jeff and sister Marie here with us and appreciate them coming up and and visiting here with us and just bringing the word of the Lord amen we all have needs this morning but we're and we're in the presence of the one who has already met every need amen Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you this morning Lord our hearts are just so thankful that you have Lord not only given us another day another opportunity but father as we thank Lord over and over how precious and how dear Lord you are to our hearts Lord we love you we appreciate you Lord God we love we love everything about you Lord not just what you have done or could do for us but it's you Lord that we have fallen in love with Lord no matter Lord the times that you've told us yes and then the times you've told us no father you're faithful and we love you lord i pray this morning that lord as we lift this offering lord i pray that god you'll bless the worship Lorna's from their hearts Lord that they would just give according to Lord how you've directed in their hearts and I pray that father you'll just take Lord and multiple a Lord and just Lord see Lord to it that father that what is given Lord we give it Lord with a desire that it might be a blessing Lord to your people we might never ever Lord meet Lord the children of God that Lord will be touched Lord Jesus on this side but father we're just so thankful that you would allow us to have a part Lord imagine when the tabernacle was being built that day Lord God even those Lord that were able to spin Lord the goats hairs they may not have felt Lord maybe as much like those that had Onyx stones or whatever more but father every part was necessary and you know Lord hits you assembling your body together Lord all of your gifts everything Lord and father we just ask Lord this morning that you'll just Lord take us into the further part of this service speak to our hearts Lord through your servant Lord this morning I pray minister to each life Lord we give you the praise honor glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you give this morning amen I want to say we certainly appreciate having sister los in here and sister Gracie amen glad to have them here with us and any other visitors that that that we've had I don't think I see any other visitors and it's good to see that everybody made the clock change now for some of you I was gonna say don't change your clocks you leave your clocks the same way but it's good to see that we made it and we've got a little bit more daylight got a little bit more daylight and that wonderful hey friends these things it's wonderful to be able to have that and and just to now be able to turn our hearts to the word of the Lord what the Lord would have forced my my what what a people we have to be able to expect God to come on the scene and speak to our hearts and that wonderful let's sing that little song is our brother comes turn your eyes upon Jesus turn your eyes upon Jesus [Music] for his wonderful face and the face we meeting in the light of his glory and rays turn your eyes war let's turn your eyes upon Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] basil or again I want to thank our brother for asking us to come in to to be with you all and I sure appreciate you all you're a very easy group of people to preach to and I I appreciate that cuz I preached in places it's not easy to preach he's the Lord you know there's just certain things that you have to go through sometimes and as a minister that's one of the things that you go through there's gonna be those times when you preach places it yeah they don't really like to hear the word preached they like to get together they have meetings and protracted meetings whether bentham said but you know when people come together because they love the Lord they like to hear the word he meant you know there's there was something I wanted to say before I have everybody standing I'm not good with words I prefer to let the Lord just anoint and then and then go but you know the Browning family has always been a just such a special people to us and I just really appreciated brother James so much the last time that I was with here with you he was in the office and we were just talking a little bit and he looked at me and he said he said well Jeff I'm tired and I thought you know I understand that but nowhere near like he did you know and I looked at him and I said brother if it means anything at all to you I said you're one of my heroes and he kind of looked at me and I said brother look you were preaching this gospel when I was a little sinner boy out there in the world I said but you you stood true to the word I said many times when ministers turned against you because you saw the revelation of the word for your day I said you still pressed forward and you still let a people to Christ and I said brother here you're one of my heroes and I'd like to say this I really believed that he was one of our true pioneers of the message and you all that have been able to sit under his ministry and Samuel you grew up there under under him you know you're privileged people you're a very privileged people I thank God that we have men that we can look to like that and it's not just men that we have to look back through the scripture to see their life but it's men that we actually have been able to for take up their lives we've been able to receive from them what God has done for them it's a it's a great privilege in this hour to to be a part of the Bride of Christ I really appreciate our brother and certainly certainly have been praying for you and praying with you with that said let's stand together and let's go to Matthew chapter 16 and certainly desire your prayers this morning that the Lord had just helped me to get out of the way and I told brother Samuel I felt like an evangelist last night but what I'm what is on my heart this morning what the Lord has put on my heart I I really need to stay in in a pastoral frame and I don't know if y'all gonna let me do that or not I was just listening to the service back there I was getting more excited every time there's another song was sung and I you know I appreciate that at just such a wonderful atmosphere in Matthew chapter 16 we'll begin in verse 17 and these are very familiar scriptures to us but you know I believe the Lord can can bring things out of them to help us so we know this is they come off the mountain Jesus had had looked at the disciples and asked them said you know who to me and say that I am and they had their different things to say but he finally looked at looked at him he said now who do you say that I am and jesus answered and said blessed art thou simon barjona because Simon had a revelation see he had a channel brother mem called it a channel open to God and because of the channel that had been open to him he was able to recognize what was actually taking place he wasn't just recognizing that Jesus was a good preacher he wasn't just recognizing that that Jesus had a way with people but he said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and he said blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now I always like to look at a scripture exactly the way it's written he said I will build my church it's never going to be a group of people that builds a church although it takes a body of believers to be a church praise the Lord but under the leadership of the Holy Ghost he said I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against him and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let's bow our heads together you have an unspoken request on your heart you won't just raise your hand to the Lord he he certainly knows every need Heavenly Father we stand before you this morning or Jesus just so happy to be in the house of God so blessed or Jesus to be able to stand where we stand today see the things that we see Lord we have been given eyes to see ears to hear a heart to receive Lord we just ask you to come today and just take this vessel take the gift that you've placed in my life Lord and make you be a blessing through the word to the people today and Lord may you anoint them and help them father to be able to receive this word the way that it has come to me Lord and helped me to just really get out of the way so that you can lay this before the people so we can actually see little closer Lord what's taking place right now at this time where we are in this present day truth Lord and father will give you the praise for it we love you we bind every demon power in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask you just to move among us and have Liberty or in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you you can be seated I want to read verse 18 again he said I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock we know that that rock was revelation but he says I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it if you just look at the word build and you you know look at the definition that's there it does say it's to build a house to erect a building to bring something up but it says it's to bring it up from the foundation you realize God is not gonna build a church a building anything of that nature he's not going to build it up without having the right foundation under it well his foundation is Revelation and that's the foundation that every single one of us has to stand on because we're a part of that church and if our relationship is built on anything outside of the revelation of God's Word then God's going to have to tear it down and bring us to a place where we can be built by Revelation God said I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it as long as we allow God to build the church then the gates of Hell can't prevail against it it's not that they won't be against it the Prophet said that the gates of hell are gonna be against the church but he said it can't prevail against the church as long as the church stays in the revelation of the word that we've been given then Satan cannot prevail against us praise the Lord I'll preach the message at home a while back you know said never lose a battle I realize that a lot of times we hear a statement like that and we think but yeah that's impossible it's not impossible if you stay behind the word if we stay where we're supposed to stay the scripture tells us in 1st Peter there in the stature of a perfect man if these things be in you and abound this should cause you to where you shall never fall that's what the word says now God obligates himself to his word so when he speaks the word he puts it out there that's just another piece that he's putting into the church that's something else that he's doing to build that church to bring that up to the place that he wants it to be Amy now we know that before the foundation of the world and God had in his mind what he wanted the church to me praise the Lord this word also means to found or to establish something it says to promote growth in Christian wisdom affection grace virtue holiness blessedness and to grow in wisdom and piety hey now that's what God said he's gonna build this church out of him praise the Lord you realize that those are the things that are unseen heymy our armor is unseen those things that are real are unseen those things that are most beneficial to us are those that are unseen we have to believe by faith and faith is a relation so we have to walk in Revelation in order for us to even be where God wants us to be now you probably think I'm changing gears I don't know where I'm going but I want you to stick with me all right I want us to go to Genesis chapter 1 for a minute and we're going to start in in verse 1 and I'm trying real hard to stay in pastor mode okay Genesis 1:1 everybody knows this we could probably quote it by heart you know but in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth so there was nobody else that was there there was nobody to direct him there was nobody to tell him how to do it there's nobody giving him a better idea but in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth the earth was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light he saw others there's nothing so deep about that but there is because that's exactly the same thing he did to you and I when God came to us we were without form and void where the darkness was all over up and God had to come and bring us out of darkness into his marvelous light so when we start looking at the scripture and we see what God did a God God created the heavens and the earth and God is actually getting ready to build a garden he's going to build what a Garden of Eden upon the earth and this is the way that God is doing this God said let there be light and there was light and I blame him said he spoke the word and then he had to believe that it was going to come to pass now we don't think about God had to believe his own word but God operates on the same thing we have to operate on I know we we don't put the Lord there like that but look when Jesus was on the earth he didn't use his great powers to defeat the enemy he stood on the same word that you and I have to stand on many of us would never ever have the ability within us that Christ had in him because he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily but he didn't go to some supernatural power that laid within although it was there come on if he can if he can say Lazarus comfort and a man had been dead for four days jumped up on his faith and come walking out of there he could have used that power to defeat Satan but he didn't he went back to the same thing that you and I have to stand on now God said I will build this church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it God builds by the word they meant he's still building by the word God said let there be light praise the Lord God spoke the word and somehow or another that word knew just exactly what molecules what atoms whatever needed to happen to bring light upon the earth God spoke the word and he did exactly what it needed to do he Solar said God saw the light that it was good and he divided the light from the darkness God saw how good that the spoken word was so he realized that I can't allow this word to just get mixed up in anything so I have to separate it he's still separating brother/sister come on the final separation is not going to be what we think it is a lot of people talk about the final separation they want to go away over here - the what - the white throne judgment where he separates them as a sheep from the goat but the final separation for the bride is when you can separate from you when you can put let feel you know see taste feel smell you know when you can lay that down when you can lay that spirit round now and just let God deal with your soul you take this word the same way God speaks it and you watch it do the same thing in your life that it did when God spoke it that's a creative power in the Word of God praise the Lord God didn't just come and use the word so that he could show how powerful that he was although it shows how powerful that he is come on God was setting a precedent this is the way I'm always going to build things this is the way I always do it he never has to change his program he never has to change his plate that's why brother Branham said when the same circumstances are met in the same way God has to move the same way that did before or he made a mistake the first time he doesn't make mistakes so he doesn't he'll never change his mind come on you know there must have been a real mindset of the people in Brother bantams day that actually thought God changed his mind because of some of the thing that was spoken in the work but God never changed his mind God just gave people an opportunity to go on in their own way praise the Lord God never changed his mind with Balaam he didn't say okay I guess I made a mistake and you can go on down there he never changed his mind at all he didn't want him going down there and he did not allow him to curse those people prays a lot but Hezekiah god never changed his mind Hezekiah still died job just gave him a little more time on the earth that's what he asked for but he didn't change his mind at all it was Hezekiah time and he was coming you understand what I'm trying to say God and use this word to build a church and he's still building a church and that word is not going to change God's not going to decide that someday you know it's just getting too hard for my people down there on the earth and I think I'm just going to make it easy for him now sister it's not easy to be a Christian if it was the whole world to be Christians that's right I was listening to a brother preach in a funeral one time and he was talking about people you know they think that and I've heard people say it you know people I used to work with you know Christianity is just for the weak really oh how come you're not a Christian you know a lot of people want to they want to see a real man you know and they want muscles that are this big and a guy that's six foot eight and all weatherman said that's brute but he said a real man is measured by his character a real man is measured by the bags and the knees of his breath where he's been down pray talking to his creator what man looks at and sees is such a great thing God just laughs at it it doesn't mean it's foolishness to God but it's what man wants to hold on to now if you think about it from the standpoint that that I'm trying to bring across here God has used one element all the way through and that's the element that'll take us out of here God is using his word to build a church and we're a part of that church so he's going to use that to build us praise the Lord if God's Word I said I was going to try to stay in pastor mode all right I'm slowing down here all right I get ahead of myself and I can't help it you know because if when inspiration strikes I just go with it amen everything that God did he did by His Word and and that's something that if we can really grab ahold of that and let that become a part of our daily understanding our daily revelation of the word now what God does he's going to do by the word then we're going to be very far from failure we're going to stay away from failure because we're basing what we do on God's Worth and remember Hebrews 13:8 brother man's favorite scripture you know he said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so as long as we're here that word that he has used down through time that word is what God is going to continue to use in Genesis chapter one and verse 26 is that God said let us make man in our own image after our likeness you know I've heard lots of people talk about it you know who was God talking to I'm glad we had a prophet goes by Ben said he was talking those things he'd already created it wasn't two or three different gods that was up there he was just talking to what he had already created and he said let us make man in her own it he didn't want them being out of the picture and not even know what was going on so he was let's watch what's going on let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle over all the earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth some God created man in his own image and in the image of God created he him male and female created he them the next verse he said and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air or their every living thing that moveth upon the earth here God is placing Adam on the earth in dominion authority now he's telling Adam multiply and replenish the earth so Adams going to multiply and replenish the earth and he's not around and he's got to do it the same way God does upon this rock I'll build my church upon this revelation of the word I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it when brother Branham was hunting you know him and God begin to speak to better man he said what are you doing here well I'm hunting well how many do you need he's if brother bear had to believe that was God speaking to him and when brother Brahim actually preaches perfect faith he said God challenged me to take him at his word and in faith now listen faith is a revelation he said in in faith I accepted the challenge I spoke and the squirrels were there Adam was born straight from the Word of God the very mouth of God Adam came forth as spoken word we realized this was not man in a flesh body that was standing there Adam was not created in a flesh body if we go to Genesis 2:7 that's where Adam is actually brought and placed into a body but right here it's something of a higher level praise alert now remember we're going back and forth with the church we're going back and forth with what God's desire was God was going to build a church let's go back to the beginning and look at how God built his church in the beginning he did it by the Word of God and when the came forth then those that came forth from the word had the authority to use the letter in the same exact manner a man and God gave them the right to use the word God told him to multiply and replenish God told him to have dominion but this was a direct order from God praise the Lord there was nothing out of the way for Adam to take charge of the world that he was in there's nothing wrong for you to take charge of your life by God's work there's nothing wrong with you having dominion so well I'm a sister you know and as history they're supposed to be under headship and all that right but this body belongs to you come on we all have to know how to possess our vessel in sanctification and honor and well we have a right by God he's given us the right to have that Dominion and we have authority over the Hat by the Word of God the very same way that Adam had an authority here we have authority today I hadn't used the same thing that God did the word we're going to use the same thing to praise the Lord let's just look at Genesis 2:7 just that one verse that said and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul man became the Word made flesh he's the Lord it wasn't the Word made flesh until then but at that time then the word became flesh and when the word became flesh the Revelation begin to begin to pour forth in a different way now Adams got something different to work with look remember the prophets had God put us in our earthly bar in these bodies to contact our earthly home now God had created Adam put him in the garden to dress it and to keep it yes he could dress it according to the word yes he could keep it by the word but when God put him in a body then it was just giving him more to work with at the time more to enjoy these blessings that God had given him praise the Lord Genesis 2:18 says and the Lord God said it's not good that man should be alone I'll make him an help meet for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field now watch the way God skips all this it's not good that man should be alone and then he says then God formed every beast out of the field from out of the ground every fowl of the air and he brought him unto Adam to see what he would call him and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof now how did Adam know those names he had that direct line with God he had dominion he had authority so he had a right to name those animals and because Adam knew where he came from I don't knew that he came from the mind of God Adam there he was the thought there so coming from the mind of God he knew what was him the mind of God so when an animal came before Adam Adam didn't have to say I wonder what that is he already had the mind of Christ he already knew what was in God's mind and he said that's an elephant and God said that's exactly right so he met because he knew what God's thought was when that animal was brought on the earth he didn't have to look at an oak tree and say I wonder what kind of oak tree there is he knew it was an oak tree he recognized the acre and that was on it he recognized the type of leave that was there because in the mind of God when the thought was being projected from God Adam was there in that projection hallelujah I'm trying hard to be a pastor y'all help me here okay Adam named all of them and and that was the name thereof so God didn't change it God didn't say Adam you messed up no he left it died exactly the way it was is that in Adam gave names to all the cattle to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found in hell made for him and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam he put him into a silent and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof now in this silence God actually he actually goes into the word that's been made flesh and he takes a part of this word that's been made flesh and brings it out of there now Adamson in a deep sleep so Adam doesn't know exactly what God's doing praise the Lord God was forming a bright Amen now I want you to think about in the in the silence in Adams silence God was forming the bride but he was actually taking a part of Adam to form this rhyme God did not create something else not did not go get something else but God went right into the where and pull the part of the word out and took that word and molded it and shaped it into a bride hey Beth verse 22 he says and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman woman means of man and he's had any broader under the man I can just wonder while all this is going on if God said in verse 26 let us make man in our own image and after our likeness you know let us do it I can wonder you know in my mind now I don't have no quotes to back this up okay but I'm just dramatizing a little bit but I just wonder how many of those angels was looking over the banister and going I've never seen him do this before he just speaks it and it happens and then what's he what in the world is he gone I don't know but it came out of him he got that from Adam you mean well what did he kill Adam no he said he's still breathing I mean you can tell he's breathing over there but guitars off Hamlet's what is he over here now sister we think you know what oh that's really a dramatization but it's an but you know if you're looking at scriptures it says there's things that angels desire to look into raise the look that was things that angels could not come to the earth to do there were things that angels were created to do and that's all that they can do some of those were created to say holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God Almighty that's what they were created to do and they don't complain about it they just do it but that's what they're created to do they don't have anything outside of that that they can do please alert but when God put Adam on the earth he made Adam just like him and what God had the ability to do Adam had the ability to do everything that God was Adam was so God Himself goes into Adam and bring something out of Adam that Adam himself maybe didn't even realize was there and God has to put Adam in this deep sleep so that he can go in and pull this thing out of him sometimes we don't even want we just wondering why he's going on where is God but why am I going through this situation look he may be bringing something out of you to form you into what he wants you to be they met when the Potter has a vessel upon the wheel that vessel that's there does not tell that Potter slow down slow down I'm getting dizzy you know they don't do that come on because when you're on the wheel you don't have a voice Amy he turns it just as fast as he wants to turn it and he slows it down when he wants to slow it down if he needs both hands on there to squeeze it a little bit and to shape it a little he used his bow but if he only needs one finger to kind of roll the edge he just uses one finger remember Jesus he told me he said if I cast out Devils by the finger of God hood of your son's cast them out by so it just takes God's finger to cast out the devil he's all you just don't know circumstance mother says just get the finger of god damn and all you gotta do is just get the finger of God he said brother if I want the fullness if you get the finger the rest of it comes with it hey man don't try to make it so big that you can't get to it better sister he's more willing to fill us than what we've evened is harder on it but the man said he wants to give it to us more than we wanted he wants us to have the kind of relationship that Adam had in the garden he wants to bring us into that place and what it's not doing in this day he's taking this word and molding and shaping this ride he's putting her in a place he takes the rib and he brings him brings the rib to Adam I want you to watch what takes place in verse 23 Adam immediately knows who she is she bets if he was sleeping yeah but that was a part of him I want you to think about this okay God brought Adam out of Adam made of Eve but presented Adam back to Adam in feminist form praise the Lord that's more than intellectual conception can understand but it's the truth not nonetheless when God comes back and presents the woman to Adam the first thing he said this is now this is now bone of my bone this is flesh of my flesh and she shall be called woman because she came out of me well how did he know she came out of him even in the silence it didn't stop the revelation from coming forth hallelujah better sister just cause people say car they do another it does emit he's not doing anything it doesn't mean the revelation is stopped it has never stopped it never will stop God still dealing with the people that's in that channel of people that he is this day presenting the Christ said therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh the true unity of the word is when we become so one with the word that the reflection that we have is Christ in feminist form whenever Adam preached this message but it's history it wasn't so that we would be able to talk about what a mighty prophet that it was and he was a mighty prophet but that's not what God gave him gave us a mighty prophet for he didn't give them Moses so that they could talk about what a great man Moses was he gave them Moses to bring them out of their bondage to teach them who they were and to bring them to the possession that he had for them hallelujah God gave us a prophet for the same thing to bring us out of our bondage to teach us what it takes to possess what belongs to and then God through that same ministry showed that he had come back to the earth to lead the church again he moved through that same man to speak the word to bring things into existence well the Balaam said himself he said Christ has had more success in my ministry than he did his own when he was on the earth better been said now I didn't say my ministry or he didn't he said I didn't say me he said Jesus Christ he has had more success in my ministries that he's done more signs and wonders and miracles right here in Jeffersonville then he did the whole time that he was on the earth he said cuz God finally broke through here but there he never could get broken through praise the Lord you know the scripture says when I return shall I find faith what is he looking for is he looking for people that believe that he's the Christ that died to save us no he's looking for people that by revelation they're standing they are the word for their hour they are what's been delivered in this day praise the Lord I want you to just think about this Eve was a further revelation of Adam rizal if you had just stood there and looked at Adam in it in his body in male form you would have never thought of of an Eve all you would have thought of was Adam that was standing there all you had thought of was you know I saw him the other day and you know he called it lying over and it came over and just he started patting it and talking to it and you know now I saw him do this and I saw him do that but all the time there was something else in there there was so much more that was laying in there that nobody would have known had God not brought that revelation out of him and it's such a perfect time for the believer today because look he can bring out of us what he's already put there I preached on the seed one time at home and I had a brother that brought me a little plaque he said anybody can tell you how many apples are on a tree he said but nobody or I mean how many seeds are in an apple he said but nobody can tell you how many apples written in C praise the Lord you don't know how that seeds going to produce when he goes in the ground some bring 30 some bring 60 some bring 100 right but whatever is in that seed is in that seed when it goes in the ground and if God before the foundation of the world placed a seed in us then God knows exactly what that seed is going to bring forth praise the Lord our problem is the ground that it's in praise the Lord you know if you don't break up the ground brother Jeff we have moved past all of these emotional things in this hour I'm sorry but you're deceived that's right weatherman said if you want to see God move he said you need a broken contrary spirit he's had a broken up weepy spirit he said that's what creates the atmosphere for birth raise the Lord I know that we can become so revelaed that you know we have our emotions under control my brother let somebody bust your toe with a hammer and we'll see what kind of emotion control you have I'm sorry I hope we don't have any English teachers in and I supposed to say burst right right soul or sometimes you know in the hour that we live as a sister we actually have to bring it in a form of humor because you accept it better that way if the sword comes out and just starts cutting people just go we're above that we don't need nobody brother branham didn't know how to preach then that's my example that I go back to because he lived in my day praise the Lord Jesus didn't pull punches and Pat people on the back and hand out lollipops and suckers and candy he come in and he laid the word down praise the Lord and those that walked in he became the word for their day knows that submitting to that word became the word for their day hear me what I'm going to say they became a further revelation of Christ praise the Lord the the the greatest thing that we can ever do for William Branham is become what William Branham preached how many believes that John was the messenger of the Covenant is that what brother Branham said John standing there preaching behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said I must decrease and he must increase his disciples hung around for a few days you know and a few days later Jesus comes walking by again and John said behold the lamb of God to go after him follow this word John's disciples didn't say John we don't want to leave you we love you John's disciples gave him the greatest compliment that they ever could have given him they turned and then went after the living work they didn't stick around with John they didn't keep holding on to John's Kotel they didn't keep saying whoa John you know what's gonna happen are you going to raise up again are you gonna do that it wasn't that way at all they turn and they went right after the Living Word that was the greatest compliment that they could've ever paid John they believed what he preached and then they allowed it to be manifested in their lives hallelujah the greatest thing that we can do for this message by the sister to prove that this message is the word that's been laid first is let it be made fresh in us that's the greatest thing that we could ever do to show that he is alive today to show that the power of law is just to say his to let the power of God have preeminence in US he might let the power of God when he comes down and begins to washing cleanse alive that him washing cleanse us amen oh don't pull back on him but Daniel told a little story when he was at the church last time but Daniel 40 from Africa you all know brother Daniel well I'm sure he told a little story about when they were little boys and he said when we were little boys he said just like all little boys we didn't like to be now older boys shouldn't be that way he's the Lord so I've got a grandson that's 15 he said but I didn't sweat today I don't need to take a shower but ender said you know because of him being a little boys and just wanted to play all the time you know he said there was things that got into the soil there were diseases that got in the soil there were different things you know ticks and lice and different things and he said they'd get in there and they'd get these things on them and because they didn't you know take a bath and clean up and they'd go in and crawl in the bed and they'd get him do the same thing the next day just like little boys like to do they started getting these sores all over he said they just pop up all over and he said here it went home because where he was at he stayed in the compound to go to school and on the weekends he'd go home so he went home on the weekend he said his mother looked at him and said what you know how they say what she said we can't have this so you have not been bad bathing oh but mama no you have not been bathing said you go in there and get ready he said so my mama would go to the market and he said she would get a sponge you know he said you guys know what sponges or he said they have a smooth sponge and a rough sponge he said my mother always got the rough sponge he said and she would buy antiseptic soap and he said and she would come back and she would put water over the fire and she would heat that water up and get it to boiling and just get it so hot he said she would take that rough sponge and don't have rubbing our skin is that I would crimes of all I heard so bad it hurts said she never cared about my tears she didn't care cuz he was in pain she was trying to help it he's a lord and after she had scrubbed him down and got him to where he felt like he was just about to die then she'd pour that in a septic soap on there and then she'd start scrubbing him again you know sometimes you come to service and you just get scrubbed and raked over the coals and all that kind of stuff you know I walked out to service one time laid my hand on burned he said don't do that brother he said I'm bleeding all over you know that mama had a desire because knowing what would take place if she didn't get in there and get that out of his system it would kill him and he said God loves us much more than a mother could ever love us and he knows when there's something in her system it's got to come out so if he's got to scrub us every service he's going to scrub us we're going to be washed by the water of the word and we should be so thankful for that God doesn't want a disease people you know take a lamb back there for offering that was a diseased lamb come on it didn't matter what the people look like the man could have been a leper and brought an offering and they could have said oh you're a leper we can't accept not offering but that's not the way it was done but I tell ya the man's lamb took his place [Music] God is just so desiring to bring us to a place the way the word itself speaks out of our lives because look a lived sermon always speaks louder than any words we could ever say right look we can come in here and preach like a house on fire on the weekend but if you jump in your car and you drive down the road and you see me pulling into a bar everything I preached is null and void because I'm not expressing Christ except when I'm behind the pulpit preaching the word and the gift will operate if there's people there to pull on the gift maybe instead God will speak to a hypocrite to speak to his people here's a look I pray we're not no hypocrites in here this morning but you understand what I'm trying to say God wants us so full of the Holy Ghost that we we're on display brother sister this is the evening time when the token came into existence and the token had to be put on display it wasn't something that they could keep in the house it had to be put on the door of the little the over and everything everything had to be done exactly the way the prophets told him to do it had to be laid in order in that way because God was expressing to Egypt these people are separate from you these are different these are my people and I have come down to deliver them and bring them out of here I'm glad God still comes down to deliver us and bring us out of our our bondages and different things the hardest birth that there is but his sister is a person that's been born and raised in his message you pastors in America shaking his head like that he had a good Holy Ghost field Mama and Daddy but he didn't give him the Holy Ghost he had to have it for himself he had to have that experience for himself you should be so thankful that he had a mother and father that told him that you know his father being the man that he was he could recognize the gift that was in his life better man said most of the time other people recognize the gift long before you do huh he couldn't recognize the gift that was in his life he could as a Samuel you're gonna be a great man you're gonna be a great minister of the gospel son I want you to take the service Sunday you don't even have the Holy Ghost yet you gonna put him in a pulpit that's contrary to what our prophet taught us come on I know brother James wasn't that way better James was one of those minutes it's not let's pray let's get in the presence of God if that gift is ever gonna operate God's gonna have to operate it if it'll ever be a blessing to anybody God's gonna have to make it a blessing you need the Holy Ghost son raise the Lord Frey's we need more parents to teach your children now not patting them on the back and tell them how wonderful they are they never make mistakes we all make mistakes at least most of us raise your hand last night when I asked come on I don't think I'm being a pastor right now can I change gears for a minute can we go to numbers chapter three from it somebody is really pulling so brother when you get ready you want me to stop just tell me I usually give them opportunity home to say hey man at least once and I say that's all it takes numbers chapter 3 and verse 5 oh I want to just look at something for me said the Lord spake unto Moses saying bring the tribe of Levi near and present them that's the same thing that God did he brought Eve and presented her to Adam now here he's teaching the ministry in that day bring this tribe up and present them to the high priest he said present them before Aaron the priest that they may minister unto me O God what a privilege Prince what a privilege that we have we had been given opportunity to minister to the king of kings and the Lord of lords we've been given opportunity to do something for him that would bless him raise the Lord he blesses us all the time he's constantly pointlessness son out here it's a beautiful thing I love it when the Sun shines it blesses the whole world but God set it for us the blessing is for the Bride of Christ they just happen to be a beneficiary of our blessing the rain falls on the just and the unjust but it's for the just right he said verse 7 says and they shall keep his charge and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation to do the service of the tabernacle he's calling them for a purpose he said they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation in the charge of the children of Israel to do the service of the tabernacle and thou shalt give the Levites and entire people with him said that was the bride all right he said the Levites was the bride he said they shall give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel oh my he came and he presented them a gift as it were and the gift was a people just as God brought Eve to Adam that was a gift to Adam and the gift was a further revelation of who he was Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 it said therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel God telling them I've got a gift on the way I'm bringing something to you Isaiah 9:6 I'm gonna run scriptures for a minute okay under us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty God the everlasting father the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon the kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this God again dropping the word in there the Messiah is on his way and God taking the word and building that body amen everything he said in those scriptures said this is what he's going to be when he gets here I'm taking my word and I'm building this tabernacle but I'm gonna leave him praise the Lord now under the inspiration of those prophets it was spoken word spoken word spoken word it was the thought of God that had been projected a prophet had been caught up to catch the thought of God and it was God projecting the revelation of the word to the people but as long as it stayed has spoken word they couldn't have the fullness of the revelation oh my we can say bread man said babe and said brother BAM said brother and said but it's different when God says it to you it's different when it's made flesh in you it come becomes a completely different book the message is completely different when you realize you're a part of this man message you're a manifestation of what this prophet said in Luke chapter 2 verse 11 and said unto us or underused is Born This Day in the City of David a savior which is Christ the Lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising the heart and saying glory to God in the highest and on earth peace and goodwill toward men the word just became flesh praise the Lord we don't think about it we just see a baby in a manger brother BAM said it ought to be striking Jehovah in a manger Jehovah over a manure pile Jehovah crying like a baby and he said but that's what it was God had been made flesh on the earth yeah I want to read you a quote from we have seen his star and have come to worship Him brother band says he said notice as we go along he said now I won't take too long or try not to when I hear him say that I thank you Lord I'm glad he put that in there he said notice we find going along Jesus he said now the children won't understand it but I want to I want to say it here for you adults when Christ Jesus was being formed in Mary that's when the persecution said in praise Allah he said that's right that's when her persecution started see and it's the same thing in you he's at Genesis 4 he says Galatians 1 and then he says Galatians 4 9 Tencent when Christ the hope of glory is formed in you see Christ is being formed in year and when you're dying in Christ is coming to life watch the persecution said watch the struggles come on what's the battle increase he's a lord he said watch the persecution say watch trouble start on every head watch the devil go on a rampage certainly Christ is being formed in you oh my that ought to make you feel so much better about the trial that you're going through right now come on better sister look you know whether Christ has been formed in you or not you know whether what you're going through or not is your fault or not if it's your fault don't blame it on God just repent and get back to a place where he can continue to form himself in you it's that simple God's not mad at you because you fell on your face when you backs littering there like that he loves you just to say and he's always there to reach a hand out to us he's always there to bring us back into his presence praise the Lord when the word begins to become flesh then the persecution sets in praise the Lord even for a child that's being born on the earth when the child is still in the mother a child doesn't worry about anything all of its nourishment is there everything that it needs is right there it doesn't worry about breathing it doesn't worry about blood pumping through its pain it doesn't worry about any of those things it's all there it's it's self-contained if you will but you know as soon as that child is born the first thing that happens is you know better man said sometimes it's just the shock of being born that makes them cry out like that you know what I'm gonna say right where the band said a child that's born without any noise is dead he said it's stillborn right he said what does the doctor have to do he said the doctor has to pick it up and give it a little posterior protoplasmic stimulation and he said and it begins to cry out and he said in unknown tongues to itself I guess praise the Lord come on little sister I still believe in a real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and many feelings after that they met it's not a one-time experience that's going to take me all the way through it's an everyday experience that'll take me all the way through he meant it's something that we've got to have every single day of our lives mm-hmm I quoted some of this last night but I want to read it to you real quick out of Matthew chapter 2 and verse 10 he said when they saw the star speaking of those major you know what we call the wise men when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto Him gold frankincense and myrrh now I want you to watch the word was made flesh and God had those men testified on the earth that that child was what he said that he was gold frankincense and myrrh deity in service to die that's what better man said it stood for gold was the deity frankincense was the service myrrh was the bitter death he was going to die he said deity in service to die so God coming to the earth had himself presented with what would reflect him oh god I hope we can really catch what I'm trying to say by the sister what we're in the I don't know how long I've been preaching but right now I really don't care hey man we're in the hour of presentation better sister we're in the hour the rapture is at head Bela madam said that seven times seven times its completion the rapture is it head the time appointed is it head Billy Graham has gone home there's nothing there for Sodom anymore it's time for the bride to leave christ has descended the Lord Himself descended from heaven with a shout and what is he doing he's taking that word that's been made flesh God has come down not into this brother feminist phone and he's actually presenting this Living Word back to Christ it's presentation time brother Branham told us God was building a masterpiece you can't be a masterpiece unless you're a piece of the master hallelujah it's time that the presentation is taking place a may if God can speak and say let there be in their laws then God said let there be a bride and there is a man he said let the word come forth and it has let my word live and it is hallelujah you believe that this morning let's just stand to our feet I think this is a good time to just worship praise the Lord the presenting of the bride the time when God has come down and taken this very word that he's built this church with and presenting it back to Christ he so been Jeff I'd sure like to have some quotes on that wall there's plenty of them there I'm just on about page three there's plenty of those things there brother Bantam even said in the masterpiece that this bride was the masterpiece that God was creating he said it over and over and over what God was doing and spoken word his original said brother Branham actually said that God will come and he will actually take a bride and he will present that bride to his son Jesus Christ amen but says I don't I don't think that we have to have quote after quote after quote after quote after quote if we'll just look at what God's done in our lives if we'll just look at the molding and the shaping that he's done in our own life where he's brought us from to where we are right now and what's he doing come up here don't come up into my presence you're under an eagle anointing come up out of Laodicea we're in the bride age now come up here to a place where I can give you a further revelation raise the Lord what greater revelation can we have with a sister then we belong to him we're a part of him there's no devil in hell that can stop you from being there it's the wired being made fresh for the sister that defeats Satan on every head when the word becomes a part of you and you and that wire become what but a madam said you'd become what you I think I quoted it last night but your beginning is you're in and if you started with God then you're going back to God hey bear but what's he doing he's got a ministry in this hour he's got men that are anointed of the Holy Ghost that are coming in here and even in the midst of our trials the midst of our circumstances the midst of our faults and failures in shortcoming he's lifting us up and showing us a mirrored image of Christ in us Christ in you the hope of glory praise all our power heads together Oh father I know sometimes I just get so excited Lord and I maybe I just skipped over too many things that I didn't need too long it's not my desire to wear your people out Lord but if we can just really catch what was spoken it's going to transform our lives or we're gonna go out of here we're gonna be different people than we were when we came in in here we're gonna go out of here and we're going to look at ourselves in a different way we've come to that place for that we need to be like Esther when there came a threat against Esther Lord Esther invited the devil to the banquet Esther invited the problem before the king hallelujah Oh God give us enough spiritual revelation and spiritual strength this morning Lord to bring our problems to bring our circumstances to bring our enemy before you this morning Lord God hallelujah the king gave Esther the right not to change the word but just put that word in a place to where it would benefit her and it would destroy her enemy Oh God I believe today Lord Jesus she's giving us the word you've placed the word within us but you placed it upon our lips also that would defeat our enemy I pray you're helpless father I pray that you really really help us to see the revelation of what's been preached this morning Lord not because I think I'm a rebel ated person but Lord God what Adam was was presented back to Adam what laid there all that time was presented back to Adam learn the Prophet said when you hung on Calvary Lord they drove that spear through your side he said out came blood and water and he said the bride was born there at Calvary now Lord you closed up the side of Adam and Eve could never get back in there again but the side of Christ was never closed because our perfection is in Christ without Christ we can't even be perfected without the anointed Word will never become what we're supposed to become so you left that off so that our identification would be in our husband our identification would be in that anointed word it would be in our second death as the second II identify the feminist form but told me earth helped us today lord help us father we love you today we just thank you so much we're such a privileged people or talk I pray that our worship is pleasing to you this day Lord and I pray that this word father would just go over and over and over in our hearts Lord it'll be able to have full preeminence in our lives oh Jesus I just I ask your blessing to be upon my brother Samuel today Lord upon this little church Lord Jesus every person that comes to this church Lord they count this their church home or maybe those that would even view or stream the services and things Lord I pray Lord that your spirit would just be poured out upon them father that you would bless the church here as it grows warden father if it be your will add to the church daily such as should be saved Lord but many of us still have family members father that need to come back into your presence God we're taking our token and we're placing it over there Lord it we're asking that the blood of Jesus Christ be placed between them and the enemy that would try to destroy them all hallelujah I believe today Lord there's a group of people on the earth that is raised up in the midst of Satan's Eden under an anointing Lord that no matter how dark it you they're still gonna shine a lot more they're still gonna be overcomers father they're still gonna believe the word there's still gonna be a manifestation of Jesus Christ in this hour help us oh god help us Lord Jesus to stay in that channel whether you can use us the most lawyer and will give you the praise the honor and the glory for commit ourselves and the services this weekend to your asking you to bless your bride around the world or asking you to bless the fivefold ministry father just pour out your spirit among us or Jesus
