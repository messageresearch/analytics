[36:16] and it's a glorious thing as you see God
[36:18] moving supernaturally
[36:20] through those gifts and through his body
[36:22] that's something that as the body
[36:25] Believers we desire to see and that's
[36:27] where uh just like brother random puts
[36:30] it in the rising of the sun he says this
[36:32] is our desire is to see him glorified
[36:37] I said we don't want to see a church or
[36:39] anyone he said we want to see him
[36:40] glorified and so Paul here in the uh
[36:45] ending of this chapter but covet
[36:47] earnestly the best gifts and yet show I
[36:51] unto you a more excellent way
[36:56] amen may God bless you and bless the
[36:59] reading of the word as you're being
[37:00] seated
[37:03] I want to just I want to just speak here
[37:06] on just a few moments on just
[37:10] a thought on yielding
[37:12] to Divine love
[37:15] because when we look at a useful life
[37:18] and knowing that as God used
[37:22] job in a very very special way we know
[37:25] it was a useful life as the prophet put
[37:27] it that he had been used of God and he
[37:31] had given himself to the Lord there's
[37:34] always a battle Satan is always coming
[37:36] in every way to in some way hinder the
[37:40] Avenue and the channels in our lives he
[37:44] can't stop God's word from being
[37:46] fulfilled but Satan busies himself just
[37:49] like a beaver would try to Dam up an
[37:53] area to keep water from flowing and
[37:56] Satan Works within that to try to hinder
[37:59] and this is where Paul is speaking to
[38:02] the Believers that the gifts are truly
[38:06] is something that was we see and the
[38:08] Supernatural and gone moving but Paul is
[38:11] also letting him know that don't
[38:13] underestimate this but as a matter of
[38:15] fact let this be what your focus is
[38:18] because if Divine love is not your focus
[38:22] then the gifts themselves are under the
[38:25] governance of what
[38:27] so it brings us to this place that
[38:30] everything in in everything concerning
[38:32] our lives in the church and our home and
[38:35] on and on it should be governed by love
[38:38] I I want my actions governed by love I
[38:41] want my attitude governed by love and
[38:43] that's something that just doesn't take
[38:45] place but if you see here tonight
[38:47] there's ways that we can place ourselves
[38:50] I believe that all through this building
[38:51] here tonight we can all say hey I want
[38:55] to have the advantage on this tonight I
[38:57] want to have the advantage and I believe
[38:59] God comes to speak to us so that we
[39:01] would have the advantage and the upper
[39:04] hand because the scripture has said very
[39:06] clearly and you realize in your heart if
[39:08] God before us who can be against us but
[39:11] to recognize that these are things that
[39:13] God is putting before us I show unto you
[39:16] a more excellent way so it's a way
[39:18] that's being set before us just like
[39:20] when God would open the way to Moses and
[39:25] he would show the way to Israel it
[39:28] wasn't the way that Israel journeyed was
[39:31] not necessarily what the man or we in
[39:34] our flesh or Israel would have chose but
[39:36] God knew what they were able to handle
[39:39] at certain times God knew that the Red
[39:42] Sea that that moment they would never
[39:44] have chose that you or I would never
[39:46] have chose the Red Sea but you see in
[39:48] every situation God is working and our
[39:52] testimony is being built and it's being
[39:55] built so that our faith rests upon the
[39:57] power of almighty God the only thing
[40:00] Israel had to do is yield to the word of
[40:03] God and when Moses spoke the word and
[40:06] the Red Sea was parted they walked
[40:09] through in obedience to the word that
[40:11] had been spoken God took care of their
[40:14] enemies God took care of everything else
[40:16] that was pursuing them God was just
[40:19] letting it be known that I'm the one who
[40:21] makes the way and if you just walk in my
[40:24] way I will open what needs to be opened
[40:27] I I'll take care of what needs to be
[40:29] taken care of and that really boils down
[40:32] to just trust and so as we think about
[40:35] the presence of God and his presence it
[40:38] manifests his character and his ways to
[40:41] us one of the things that brother
[40:43] Branham would point out in even a year
[40:46] prior to the opening of the seals and he
[40:49] would speak of how that all that God
[40:51] might come and open those those uh those
[40:54] seals to us and he says and when he does
[40:57] he said what it will be is a revealing
[41:00] of his divine nature and his character
[41:05] because there's only so much that a man
[41:08] a man can probe into but when God
[41:11] reveals himself in his fullness of his
[41:14] person of who he really is then he
[41:17] doesn't need a man to speak or to try to
[41:20] describe but God is there to make
[41:22] himself known his character and that's
[41:25] why that in our lives we are not called
[41:28] nor did God do it in a manner so that we
[41:31] would try to imitate brother Branham or
[41:34] someone else but God was letting us see
[41:36] that through this vessel that is yielded
[41:39] to me if you will yield to me no matter
[41:41] what your battles no matter what the
[41:43] situation even through all of the stages
[41:47] of maturity I will make a way for you
[41:53] so when we read these scriptures I'm
[41:56] going to go into First Corinthians 13 4
[41:59] I want you to remember this as we read
[42:01] these scriptures that this is God's own
[42:04] character and life being made manifest
[42:07] through our lives as the children of God
[42:11] is that okay
[42:13] when we read these scriptures here that
[42:15] we're going to read in First Corinthians
[42:17] 13 4. we read them last week and I want
[42:19] to just start back into this and so it's
[42:23] not it's God's own character his life
[42:25] being made manifest you or I are the
[42:29] channels that God can pour himself into
[42:32] and make himself known through in our
[42:36] lives and so it brings it to this point
[42:40] if we just lay this for the background
[42:42] that you'll actually go through the
[42:43] whole message tonight and seeing it
[42:45] through this this perspective and that
[42:47] is it is in our trying or our striving
[42:51] but it's our yielding to him
[42:56] it's our yielding to him now in First
[42:59] Corinthians 13 4 here it says charity
[43:02] now this this charity this is God God is
[43:06] love this this scriptures that we're
[43:08] reading is not scriptures that a person
[43:11] can climb up and attain to outside of
[43:15] the Holy Ghost dwelling inside of you
[43:18] because that's what it is it's not a
[43:20] work of man this is the holy spirit man
[43:23] can love God in his spirit with feel
[43:25] your love but this is agape love this is
[43:28] the Holy Ghost operating through a
[43:31] surrender life and a vessel it's God
[43:34] taking us on so I want you to think of
[43:36] it it's not you it's not me it's God
[43:39] displaying himself
[43:41] charity suffereth law and this kind
[43:44] charity envious not charity vonneth not
[43:48] itself and is not puffed up it does not
[43:52] behave itself unseemly it seeketh not
[43:56] her own is not easily provoked and it
[43:59] thanketh no evil and you know that means
[44:02] to keep records and everything else
[44:04] rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth
[44:07] in the truth
[44:10] it doesn't matter if someone disagrees
[44:12] with you or not the objective is is I
[44:14] want truth to prevail
[44:16] and when I'm talking about truth I'm
[44:19] talking about the person of Truth
[44:21] himself I want to see righteousness
[44:23] prevail
[44:24] I want to see anybody fail I don't want
[44:26] to see anybody miss it if we have that
[44:28] attitude then we're falling off of what
[44:31] God is calling us to
[44:35] so it's sending the desire within us
[44:38] that look uh you know let me just say it
[44:41] like this uh the only the only place
[44:43] that you'll probably ever go that
[44:45] everybody agrees with you is a graveyard
[44:47] and that's because nobody can talk
[44:49] but here we are assembled together and
[44:52] you know what God's God's placed it in
[44:54] such a way oh I'm going to find a church
[44:56] that suits me or do we mean that I'm
[44:58] going to find a place that everybody
[45:00] thinks like I think agree like I agree
[45:02] good luck with that
[45:04] you can't even do that in your own home
[45:08] come on now but you see God designed it
[45:11] and said it that way for what purpose to
[45:15] show greenness in our life that we must
[45:18] have the sun to bake out all the
[45:22] greenness in our life
[45:27] Hallelujah
[45:29] oh my
[45:31] verse 7.
[45:33] beareth all things this is what it does
[45:35] it Bears all things believes all things
[45:38] hopes all things endures all things
[45:43] we were looking at that verse last week
[45:45] it just comes to my mind that's where
[45:46] you want I want to believe the best
[45:48] about a person
[45:50] yeah but the same you might be wrong so
[45:52] be it
[45:53] so be it oh you're wrong about this but
[45:56] I want to believe the best for somebody
[45:59] [Applause]
[46:01] is that right that's what that's how our
[46:03] lives should be well so and so I don't
[46:05] care what so-and-so said
[46:07] all right are you hearing me
[46:10] we're talking listen we're talking about
[46:12] being stewards of the grace of God and
[46:16] there's things that you and I have
[46:18] stewards over I've got stewards over be
[46:21] careful little ears what you hear
[46:23] we're gonna have to break out the Sunday
[46:25] School Song now do we but I tell you
[46:26] what it behooves us sometimes be careful
[46:28] little ears what you hear be careful
[46:30] little eyes what you see
[46:32] be careful little mouth what you say
[46:35] whoo
[46:38] charity I love this charity never fail
[46:42] us but where there be prophecies they
[46:44] shall fail to serve the purpose whether
[46:47] there be tongues they shall cease
[46:49] whether there be knowledge it shall
[46:51] vanish okay now I I brother random makes
[46:55] this statement and I played this before
[46:57] the service and I want this is to me at
[46:59] the end of the service here in Divine in
[47:02] the message love and brother Ram is
[47:04] talking about the atmosphere that is
[47:07] coming to the building he's calling the
[47:09] people's attention that the atmosphere
[47:12] that they are sensing in right there at
[47:15] that moment in the meeting is different
[47:17] from when they walked in the building
[47:19] and and he's letting them know that what
[47:22] it is it's God projecting his love right
[47:25] now and he said it is the angels of God
[47:28] that are moving up and down the aisles
[47:31] now remember you say oh praise God the
[47:34] angels of God remember brother random
[47:36] tells us regarding Zacharias and
[47:38] Elizabeth who was John the Baptist
[47:40] parents he said it was an angel that
[47:42] visited them and in the Bible brother
[47:44] and said notice in the Bible it says
[47:46] that they were an upright people and he
[47:48] said if you want God to visit your home
[47:51] he said just as you entertain in your
[47:54] life in your walk with God you live an
[47:56] upright in life before God does that
[47:58] mean that you're mistake free no but it
[48:01] means that you recognize I've got an
[48:03] atonement and nothing has to linger or
[48:06] is going to linger I'm not going to let
[48:08] one Speck 11 build and build and build
[48:11] but we're going to take care of it yes
[48:13] we're in this flesh but it's not an
[48:15] excuse I want my place my whole my life
[48:18] to be a place that the holy spirit is
[48:21] welcome
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:24] oh my brother Brian said this I'm so
[48:27] happy and thinking of this I don't have
[48:29] this one listed there but I just want to
[48:31] refer to it and thinking of Charity
[48:33] never fail us I love this he said so
[48:35] happy that we can introduce to a dying
[48:38] shaking World under the impact of an
[48:41] atomic age Cobalt bombs sin but
[48:44] introduce a love that can never be
[48:47] stopped by any bomb or anything
[48:52] that's the power the power of divine
[48:54] love
[48:55] oh brother Samuel it's not working
[48:57] charity never fails are you hearing me
[49:01] the breakdown is not in Divine love the
[49:04] breakdown becomes with the instrument
[49:06] that Divine love is trying to be
[49:08] projected through
[49:10] it's us that want to keep ourselves as
[49:13] an instrument that Divine love can flow
[49:15] through
[49:16] is that right so we know that when we
[49:19] see this uh brother Branham even goes on
[49:22] in that quote there and I just I'm just
[49:24] referring to us I don't have it on the
[49:25] screen but he says and one he says here
[49:27] he is right now he's talking to the
[49:29] people at the end of the service here he
[49:31] is right now and his love is spreading
[49:33] forth and that's what makes you feel
[49:38] his love is spreading forth that's when
[49:41] it comes down to it it's God's love
[49:43] drawing Upon Our Lives now you and I
[49:46] have a choice we can either surrender to
[49:49] it I believe that's why Satan wants
[49:51] people to be so busy just check into
[49:53] church like we're checking in on the
[49:55] clock and check out I did my duty but
[49:57] that's not how we're to come to the
[49:59] house of God
[50:00] we're to be sensitive because maybe God
[50:03] wants to do something in your life
[50:06] is that right
[50:07] but God knows how to get attention to
[50:10] where it comes to a place that there's
[50:12] things that we are not going to be able
[50:14] to punch in and punch out we are going
[50:16] to have to labor and be desperate before
[50:18] God God knows how to bring us as his
[50:21] children into this place and I I just
[50:23] say if we can just go ahead and give
[50:25] ourselves to it but you know what I
[50:27] don't want to live my life in that way I
[50:29] don't want to just say God you got this
[50:31] time to work with me by this time I'm
[50:33] gone see ya
[50:35] I don't want to live that kind of life
[50:37] you say why because that is a life
[50:39] that's under the influence of the world
[50:43] come on friends we're talking about Sons
[50:46] and Daughters of God either the world is
[50:48] going to control you or you're going to
[50:50] control it
[50:52] is that right it's just like with
[50:54] everything in your life either you will
[50:57] be a master over it or it will Master
[50:59] you
[51:00] brother Brian said he's here right now
[51:02] and his love is spreading forth that's
[51:04] what makes you feel the way you do he's
[51:06] projecting his love to you now come here
[51:09] and he will show you his grace he will
[51:12] take all your sin away all your worry
[51:14] away all that's wrong with you he will
[51:16] make it all right so it comes down to
[51:19] yielding to the presence of almighty God
[51:22] now when you think of it it's yielding
[51:25] to the love of God being projected to us
[51:27] I I referred to a scripture last week of
[51:30] how that the Bible says that the love of
[51:33] Christ constrainteth us and that word
[51:35] constraineth as we looked at it last
[51:37] week it means to direct us to guide us
[51:40] to lead us I'm thankful for the
[51:42] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[51:45] see God's a father are you hearing me
[51:47] now God don't birth his children and say
[51:50] raise yourself
[51:52] the Bible said that a child left to
[51:54] itself bringeth its mother shame
[51:58] God is purposeful in raising and
[52:01] maturing his church brother man tells us
[52:04] like this taken Hebrews chapter 12 as in
[52:06] speaking of how that those who are born
[52:09] of his Spirit were are then after being
[52:11] born of his Spirit are trained to
[52:14] conform to His Image in their walk
[52:18] I'm glad he's a faithful teacher I'm
[52:21] glad he's there that God just didn't
[52:23] step back and say well you know what
[52:25] we're going to put you on autopilot
[52:26] you've been born again God doesn't work
[52:28] that way he doesn't even call you to
[52:31] work that way but he speaks to you and I
[52:33] and says mortify the Deeds of your body
[52:37] he lets us know there's a Warfare that
[52:39] goes on the spirit lusteth against the
[52:42] Flesh and the flesh against the spirit
[52:44] it's a Battleground that is going on
[52:48] is that right
[52:49] so we see there is a constraining by the
[52:53] love of God and to remember we have been
[52:56] bought with a price we're not our own
[53:01] is that right I mean there's some things
[53:04] that we can look at and say hey man I
[53:07] need God to take this well don't just
[53:09] let God have this problem or have this
[53:11] and have this situation and then tell
[53:14] him and other things hey I got this I
[53:16] know how to handle people
[53:18] preach with me now
[53:21] preach with me now I got this God I know
[53:24] how to do it but maybe what God is
[53:26] wanting and he's going to do is display
[53:28] the grace of God to where you step back
[53:31] and say wow I didn't even realize that
[53:33] that was in me in that way and watched
[53:37] the supernatural take place my day is
[53:39] something you're talking about walking
[53:41] on water sometimes I wonder if our
[53:44] Ambitions are on things that we'll never
[53:46] do
[53:48] come on now if God wanted you to walk on
[53:52] water then he'd have you walking on
[53:53] water but in the meantime he's calling
[53:56] you and I to walk over our first bird
[54:00] he's calling on us to tread over our
[54:03] feelings tread over our attitude to walk
[54:06] above that how can I do it Lord because
[54:08] he has Biden us to come and follow him
[54:13] so it's the love of God constraining us
[54:15] which is to control us
[54:18] I'm glad about that aren't you
[54:21] it's urging us
[54:24] we don't know what urging is
[54:27] we sometimes we have it in our homes
[54:30] wives there's the urge the husbands
[54:33] husbands urge the wise
[54:37] and who's been in that wall a little bit
[54:39] huh
[54:42] urging
[54:43] boy this
[54:45] is pain it looked awful nice on these
[54:47] walls
[54:48] urging
[54:51] sorry I don't mean to bring up bad
[54:54] things but you get what I'm saying the
[54:56] love of God controlling
[54:58] urging us see notice he it's not God
[55:00] going to say well I'm just going to
[55:02] override you no he's controlling us he's
[55:05] direct and urging us impelling us in the
[55:08] right direction and this is where that
[55:10] when we see this word Consecration and I
[55:13] really want to just step into that word
[55:14] tonight on the word consecration because
[55:18] when you think of this word consecration
[55:20] it's a word that means where something
[55:23] has been dedicated
[55:26] for a certain purpose like this church
[55:28] is consecrated
[55:31] for service
[55:34] dude we don't you know this church is
[55:36] not just well when we're not having
[55:38] service it becomes a multi-faceted room
[55:40] you know we're playing kickball and
[55:42] don't know this is a place that's been
[55:44] set aside
[55:46] for us
[55:47] for God to come down and meet with us
[55:49] and speak to us we've dedicated it that
[55:51] way
[55:52] we've dedicated that and dedicate our
[55:55] lives that way so if we think about how
[55:57] certain things can be dedicated in a
[55:59] certain way then it brings it down for
[56:01] our lives to where our lives if what we
[56:04] dedicate ourselves to that's where
[56:07] consecration is and I want you to
[56:09] remember brother random talking about
[56:11] the bull I'm just going to read some
[56:12] simple things here but there's some
[56:14] points in here that I will I'm just
[56:16] looking for the Lord to just draw and
[56:18] minister to us and he's talking about
[56:20] this bull that was there in the field
[56:23] when he walked upon it and he didn't
[56:25] Brothers didn't even know that that bull
[56:27] was there
[56:28] he didn't know matter of fact the last
[56:30] time he had heard about it was that bull
[56:32] was down on a different farm and
[56:34] remember it had actually killed a black
[56:37] man it had killed him so brother random
[56:39] you know now knowing he walks he walks
[56:41] across here and brother Brandon said
[56:43] here he come and something happened
[56:46] I wish that would happen all the time
[56:52] it just don't do it but when I see a
[56:57] real tremendous sick case and something
[57:00] happens now notice when I see a real
[57:03] tremendous sick taste so he sees a need
[57:07] and when he sees that need as it begins
[57:09] to enter in on that need that's there
[57:12] what does it do he says something
[57:13] happens it isn't it isn't man he said
[57:16] it's not man it's when God can get a
[57:20] hold of a man it's when it's consecrated
[57:25] that's what I want to be it's
[57:26] consecrated
[57:28] and God won't do that for me
[57:31] the pastor won't do that for me
[57:34] can I say this the Holy Ghost won't do
[57:36] that for me
[57:37] that's on me and you
[57:40] being consecrated
[57:42] to dedicate Hey listen you and I to work
[57:44] we have a choice of what we dedicate
[57:47] ourselves to yeah you know what he said
[57:49] by dedicate when we give our substitute
[57:51] when we place as a higher priority above
[57:54] something else that's what we dedicate
[57:55] ourselves to the holy spirit will not
[57:58] consecrate or do this for us but it will
[58:01] yield to him he'll lead us into a deeper
[58:04] Consecration and let me tell you
[58:06] something it's greater than just Bulls
[58:09] or Maniacs or Hornets but it will
[58:12] produce the love of God in your home
[58:15] it'll take situations on the job it will
[58:19] give you victory in your life
[58:26] brother said what's on the platform when
[58:28] the Visions happen
[58:29] what's when evil spirits what's what
[58:32] takes place it's a surrender to the Holy
[58:36] Spirit
[58:37] now see brother random could have just
[58:39] no he could have refused
[58:41] Divine love is coming in
[58:45] Divine love just didn't take brother
[58:47] Adam and put him if I can say this way
[58:49] you know put him in a full nelson or how
[58:51] you know or a headlock or you know a
[58:53] cradle mood he didn't come in and do
[58:54] that to him let me go let me go no
[58:59] but he had to surrender remember the
[59:02] Holy Spirit
[59:03] is a gentleman
[59:07] he's a gentleman
[59:08] and brother Branham had to surrender
[59:12] to him in other words to let Divine love
[59:16] have the right of way
[59:19] right
[59:20] it's kind of like those yield signs that
[59:22] they have getting on that nobody pays
[59:24] attention to
[59:25] yield means go faster and cut everybody
[59:28] else off
[59:31] come on you know what I'm talking about
[59:33] right
[59:35] so but yielding itself is where you're
[59:38] trying to merge in to the traffic so
[59:41] it's not us putting ourselves in the
[59:43] Forefront but with sins here is God's
[59:46] presence moving down and it's overriding
[59:49] our feelings
[59:51] it's overriding our thoughts come on
[59:55] friends we need the grace of God we need
[59:58] Divine love to step in in this moment
[1:00:00] that's not unchristianizing you
[1:00:03] that's letting you see of the resource
[1:00:06] that you and I have within us
[1:00:10] Satan will inject the thought and then
[1:00:12] turn around and accuse you for thinking
[1:00:14] it preach with me now
[1:00:17] he'll turn around and do that what's he
[1:00:19] doing anointing that old flesh what's he
[1:00:22] doing he knows if he can get at you that
[1:00:25] the yielding will shut down but if you
[1:00:27] can remember I am nothing without the
[1:00:30] grace of God and that thought came in
[1:00:33] but I dismissed that in the name of
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ
[1:00:38] talking about battling against spirits
[1:00:43] he comes in and takes over watch how he
[1:00:45] controls it just watch how it takes
[1:00:48] place it's God it's not man oh if we
[1:00:52] don't mean living that God let us live
[1:00:56] there
[1:00:58] oh my I want to be welcoming don't you
[1:01:02] notice Brethren said the Bull's standing
[1:01:04] there about 20 yards from me he rose
[1:01:06] here and he come great long horns oh
[1:01:10] brother Pam said This is the End
[1:01:13] now you'll realize when you read this in
[1:01:15] and you heard me go through this before
[1:01:17] brother Brown's thoughts when he begins
[1:01:19] to come in fear sets in in this moment
[1:01:22] this is the end of the Bible actually
[1:01:24] says it in that way in other places in
[1:01:25] the message this is the end now notice
[1:01:28] and instead of hating that bull it seems
[1:01:32] strange I love him notice it seemed
[1:01:35] strange so it was strange to the prophet
[1:01:39] standing there right now that he did not
[1:01:42] even feel angry towards that bull you
[1:01:44] know what he's letting us know this is
[1:01:47] not something that I did
[1:01:50] I did not strive or work myself up and
[1:01:54] repeat after me 20 million times I do
[1:01:57] not hate you I do not hate you I do not
[1:01:59] hate you don't take another no it was
[1:02:01] him yielding
[1:02:05] let me just say it like this
[1:02:08] let me just say this very plainly if he
[1:02:10] would have knew that bull was in there
[1:02:11] guess what he wouldn't have walked in
[1:02:13] there
[1:02:15] the Bible said not to tempt the Lord
[1:02:18] come on somebody the bad brother bam
[1:02:20] tells us Jesus don't clown for nobody
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:24] if he'd have known that was there he
[1:02:25] wouldn't have walked in there Brother
[1:02:27] Robinson matter of fact if I'd had my
[1:02:28] gun and it wouldn't have been in my
[1:02:30] truck I'd have shot him
[1:02:33] is that right
[1:02:34] but you see this is God taking over
[1:02:40] I'm just going to say a plane God did
[1:02:42] not include this example that he's going
[1:02:44] to produce amongst the bride a bunch of
[1:02:46] bull Whispers
[1:02:48] Hornet Whispers
[1:02:50] you're like dog Whispers
[1:02:53] that ain't what God was trying to do
[1:02:56] who I'm going to be in a wild animal
[1:02:58] tamer I'm gonna do this and I'm going to
[1:03:00] do that it's like my dad said when there
[1:03:02] were different ones that came one to
[1:03:04] talk about in the Millennium or whatever
[1:03:05] more and you know the dad said well you
[1:03:07] go sleep with the lines and we'll find
[1:03:09] out tomorrow
[1:03:10] yeah
[1:03:10] because the Bible said the lion will lay
[1:03:12] down with the lamb
[1:03:14] is that right then at that time that's
[1:03:17] when it'll be if God chooses it
[1:03:19] sometimes we've been building it out
[1:03:21] there's experiences through this
[1:03:22] building right here where some of us
[1:03:24] would have been bitten by dogs or other
[1:03:25] things if not the grace of God had
[1:03:28] stepped into our lives
[1:03:30] but we didn't work that up
[1:03:32] [Applause]
[1:03:34] you see this is not erotic Christian
[1:03:36] Life a Christian Life is based on rest
[1:03:38] not but I got to do this and I've got to
[1:03:40] make this happen this is not what that
[1:03:42] is at all
[1:03:43] instead of hating that bull it seemed
[1:03:47] strange
[1:03:49] I loved him I wish I could explain it
[1:03:52] but let me tell you something brother
[1:03:54] you'll never come in contact with the
[1:03:56] greater force in this life than love yes
[1:03:58] sir I do know this is important I do not
[1:04:01] try to conquer Demons by kicking them
[1:04:08] how did Jesus do it
[1:04:10] hold your peace
[1:04:12] right right
[1:04:13] and come out
[1:04:17] he did not kick the objects where the
[1:04:19] where Satan had him bound
[1:04:21] yeah
[1:04:23] hello now
[1:04:25] I do not try to conquer demons I mean
[1:04:27] I've been in I've been in the places
[1:04:29] where I've had to sit on their legs
[1:04:30] while we prayed for them and and
[1:04:32] everything in in different meetings and
[1:04:34] case after case and situations coming
[1:04:36] but never was anything physically
[1:04:40] sometimes laboring for that for hours
[1:04:43] until that Spirit when it's finally
[1:04:45] exposed and it would leave
[1:04:47] but here's the thing I don't try to
[1:04:49] conquer them by kicking them
[1:04:51] notice well what do you do I love God
[1:04:55] but wait a minute the demons there how
[1:04:58] are you overcoming the demon because I
[1:05:00] love God
[1:05:02] because I cannot love God if I've got
[1:05:06] the wrong attitude towards that
[1:05:11] are you hearing me see Satan wants to
[1:05:13] draw us out in the flesh instead of
[1:05:16] hating the bull
[1:05:19] love is what God is God is love love
[1:05:22] moves god brother Brown goes on to say
[1:05:25] and why are people so tossed about he's
[1:05:27] talking about hearing a man you know
[1:05:29] standing up at a big tent and you know
[1:05:31] and and and and things he was talking
[1:05:33] about casting out evil spirits and this
[1:05:35] is an important Point brother Rams says
[1:05:37] I don't have no doubt about that but
[1:05:39] evil spirits are not cast out by cruel
[1:05:43] indifferent living
[1:05:46] the most powerful weapon there is in the
[1:05:50] world is love
[1:05:54] remember Satan is the god of force
[1:05:58] are you hearing me now but God by Divine
[1:06:01] love God overcomes
[1:06:05] how did Jesus defeat him in the
[1:06:07] Temptations by love
[1:06:09] come on you know I'm quoting to you by
[1:06:12] look see for us in our mind we're
[1:06:14] looking by love he loved God he loved
[1:06:17] the word he loved his father he loved
[1:06:21] above that situation you say well
[1:06:23] brother Samuel don't I love if you let
[1:06:25] down on your character and say well I
[1:06:28] believe the word but it's okay to act
[1:06:30] like this you're letting down
[1:06:32] because remember the word is not a
[1:06:35] letter
[1:06:37] but it's a character being revealed
[1:06:41] sometimes it didn't balance scripture
[1:06:43] it's about his nature
[1:06:46] and Satan what he wants to do because as
[1:06:49] soon as he can draw us out in the flesh
[1:06:50] I don't care
[1:06:51] Who We Are we're defeated
[1:06:54] as soon as he gets you out from behind
[1:06:56] the Fortress of the word and that's the
[1:06:58] word in our soul
[1:07:01] that's the reason of the times that
[1:07:03] we've had to repent is because we got
[1:07:04] out from behind that Fortress
[1:07:08] yeah this is why when brother Brown
[1:07:10] would go on to say it says when you see
[1:07:12] he says a person like that and he's
[1:07:14] talking about that maniac and I'm going
[1:07:16] to read about that in a minute he said
[1:07:17] but don't don't never think that it's
[1:07:20] the man
[1:07:21] it's the devil that's in the band
[1:07:25] notice where are we training our sights
[1:07:27] because all we see is a manifestation
[1:07:29] but it's not the man
[1:07:32] it's the devil if Satan can get his eyes
[1:07:35] what they treat me off for they're doing
[1:07:37] this or that he's doing this or he's
[1:07:39] that the way Satan wants is to get our
[1:07:42] eyes on flesh and blood and it's not
[1:07:44] about flesh and blood
[1:07:51] um
[1:07:54] God help us
[1:07:58] brother Branson goes on in this he says
[1:08:00] you never cast The Devil out by the
[1:08:03] wrong attitude
[1:08:07] Never by the wrong attitude
[1:08:10] if there's one little bit of anything
[1:08:13] in your heart
[1:08:14] against that person it'll never work
[1:08:19] one spec clogs up the channel
[1:08:24] is that right
[1:08:26] or brother Samuel then how in the world
[1:08:28] am I going to do that because sometimes
[1:08:29] I can't help when different things come
[1:08:31] in you may not be able to help when
[1:08:33] things come in but you do have
[1:08:35] jurisdiction over what you let's say
[1:08:38] there's a lot of people that can come
[1:08:39] and knock on your door tonight but
[1:08:42] you've got to be able and willing to let
[1:08:44] them in
[1:08:46] right somebody can come in and knock on
[1:08:48] the door and want to sell you a bunch of
[1:08:50] junk it's your you're the one that
[1:08:53] decides whether or not you're going to
[1:08:55] listen to it and you're going to buy it
[1:08:57] come on somebody
[1:09:00] and then you wonder how did this junk
[1:09:01] end up in my house because you let them
[1:09:03] in you listen to their spill and you
[1:09:06] bought it
[1:09:09] come on listen salespeople are slick
[1:09:14] I've had them when they find out they
[1:09:16] kind of probe around a little bit and
[1:09:18] I've come to her you know you recognize
[1:09:20] it and because I want to witness to
[1:09:22] people but I also realize I've been
[1:09:24] around different ones and want to sell
[1:09:25] me things and then they'll try to get me
[1:09:27] on the scripture
[1:09:29] you know what I'll sit there and witness
[1:09:32] to you but I ain't going to buy your
[1:09:33] product
[1:09:35] if I don't need it now that ain't
[1:09:36] puffing me up I'm just telling you if I
[1:09:38] don't need it I don't need it
[1:09:41] and I don't want it
[1:09:45] right but you know what I'm saying
[1:09:48] so you never cast out the Devil by a
[1:09:50] wrong attitude it takes love to do that
[1:09:56] Hey listen friends when brother Brandon
[1:09:58] developed that when that complex was
[1:10:00] developed
[1:10:01] he didn't go around and look for a
[1:10:03] complex
[1:10:06] come on
[1:10:08] but here it was after laboring and
[1:10:11] things being said being misunderstood
[1:10:13] things going on and notice he said I
[1:10:16] built myself a complex he never put that
[1:10:18] on the devil
[1:10:20] he said I build it
[1:10:23] but notice what he said he said I've got
[1:10:26] to stay around here and I have got to
[1:10:28] pray and seek God and you will find
[1:10:30] brother Branham after the message
[1:10:32] standing in the Gap as a matter of fact
[1:10:34] before he ever preaches standing in the
[1:10:36] Gap he preaches to a group of young
[1:10:37] people come follow me and he lets the
[1:10:40] young people he don't know let the whole
[1:10:42] cat out of the bag in that service but
[1:10:43] he lets him know he said I was on the
[1:10:46] wrong road he said but by his grace I'm
[1:10:50] back on the right Road
[1:10:52] you know what it was he was brought to
[1:10:54] that mountain range and said if you ever
[1:10:57] doubt come back here your name is wrote
[1:10:59] all over here
[1:11:01] oh let me tell you your name is founded
[1:11:05] in the Lamb's Book of Life if you want
[1:11:08] to know if God cares about you he's
[1:11:10] included it his presence makes it real
[1:11:13] this message is that mountain Reigns for
[1:11:16] you and I that lets us know when I look
[1:11:18] in the word of God if I get down if I
[1:11:21] get gloomy if I get discouraged I can
[1:11:23] look back through the sacred Sands and
[1:11:26] know that God has picked me up and
[1:11:28] revealed himself
[1:11:30] to me
[1:11:36] sometimes it's just that it's just that
[1:11:38] way
[1:11:39] because it isn't just well I'm going to
[1:11:41] speak that wrong attitude out of here
[1:11:45] I believe in speaking the word but
[1:11:47] sometimes I think sometimes we're
[1:11:49] wanting things without some real
[1:11:51] grunting it out
[1:11:53] in desperation not in not that it's
[1:11:56] about us but there were times there's
[1:11:58] times of desperation that God places us
[1:12:01] into
[1:12:03] um
[1:12:06] foreign
[1:12:08] you feel the feeling leave thank God
[1:12:11] what are you doing there's ground being
[1:12:13] gained what do I do keep praying
[1:12:16] because maybe within uh by the all of a
[1:12:18] sudden turns around at five o'clock in
[1:12:20] the evening hear that same feeling wants
[1:12:22] to come right back in there what do I do
[1:12:23] pray it right back out
[1:12:26] well he wants to come back the next day
[1:12:28] pray it right back out
[1:12:29] [Applause]
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:44] I'm not going to say that
[1:12:46] it takes love to do that and love is the
[1:12:50] most powerful force it wasn't nothing
[1:12:52] wrong or anything like that but I just
[1:12:53] you know love is the most powerful force
[1:12:56] that there is in the world have you
[1:12:58] notice a devil is always hate
[1:13:01] hate is of the devil
[1:13:03] when people hate someone remember it's a
[1:13:06] terrible devil to despise or dislike you
[1:13:11] mustn't do that
[1:13:15] you mustn't do that
[1:13:18] true amen
[1:13:20] that's right that's right help me Lord
[1:13:22] Jesus
[1:13:25] notice
[1:13:26] brother Brown goes into this I'm talking
[1:13:27] about the maniac here
[1:13:30] he says now when it comes to these
[1:13:32] crisis
[1:13:33] I'm sure that we might label things in
[1:13:35] our life and they are crisis what is a
[1:13:37] crisis is when we need God
[1:13:40] we need God to move
[1:13:43] right we need God to move I don't care
[1:13:45] what it is it's a crisis
[1:13:48] come on Friends
[1:13:50] that one's Sovereign Grace now notice
[1:13:52] when we come to these crisis that's when
[1:13:54] Sovereign Grace steps in
[1:13:56] something happened in my life he's
[1:13:58] talking about that Maniac now I I I wish
[1:14:01] it would if it ever comes again that
[1:14:02] it'll never leave
[1:14:04] I only wish that there was some way that
[1:14:06] I had power this morning to project to
[1:14:08] this group of men and women here and he
[1:14:10] would never leave you like when the
[1:14:12] maniac at Oregon when he ran to the
[1:14:14] platform to kill me many of you read the
[1:14:16] book something happened there you've
[1:14:19] often wondered I guess how those things
[1:14:20] happen right you've often wondered it's
[1:14:24] something in the stead of despising that
[1:14:27] man though he was there to take my life
[1:14:32] now remember I think it was I don't know
[1:14:34] how many weeks ago it was but we took
[1:14:35] that scripture when it speaks of if they
[1:14:38] Smite you on the right cheek turn your
[1:14:40] other cheek right
[1:14:43] hello y'all didn't go to sleep on me now
[1:14:45] did you we weren't wearing a big help me
[1:14:47] Jesus moment right now
[1:14:49] okay but remember when it says you know
[1:14:52] if they want to take your uh coat give
[1:14:54] them your cloak also what the whole the
[1:14:57] whole objective within that whole realm
[1:15:00] of scriptures is is don't get caught up
[1:15:04] in the spirit they're Anointed with and
[1:15:07] coming at you in because there's times
[1:15:09] you've got to go to the union on your
[1:15:12] job
[1:15:14] and you're not backslid it isn't that
[1:15:17] well you're not really doubting you're
[1:15:18] really doubting God if you really have
[1:15:20] faith hey it's written in the law book
[1:15:22] it's part of the contract if it's there
[1:15:24] ain't no need for me to sweat about it
[1:15:27] talk to the Union steward and let's get
[1:15:29] things rolling
[1:15:31] it's talking about not coming under
[1:15:33] vexation
[1:15:35] because as soon as you come under the
[1:15:37] spirit that is being projected to you
[1:15:39] you're defeated
[1:15:41] is trying to draw draw us out
[1:15:44] it's something in the state of despising
[1:15:47] that man though he was there to take my
[1:15:49] life I love I just love how it's worded
[1:15:51] a Divine love set in for him
[1:15:57] brother did you work it up no
[1:16:00] were you I need Divine love right now no
[1:16:03] no it's set in
[1:16:07] what was it
[1:16:08] he was welcome
[1:16:11] he was welcome
[1:16:13] he was welcome at any time
[1:16:15] do you see why that the enemy battles
[1:16:18] your life in my life he wants to make us
[1:16:23] non-useful
[1:16:27] that's why he comes at you with the
[1:16:29] attacks he comes at you don't look at it
[1:16:32] well well if I could just get this out
[1:16:33] of the way if this person hadn't said
[1:16:34] this if this you realize what that's all
[1:16:36] about it's there to try to shut down the
[1:16:39] channel
[1:16:39] but if you can say God I need your grace
[1:16:42] I need Divine love to set in right now
[1:16:45] and right here I needed working right
[1:16:48] here first
[1:16:52] he called me a hypocrite and a snake in
[1:16:54] the grass ooh
[1:16:57] thousands of people sitting there
[1:17:00] spit in my face brother Brown dramatized
[1:17:03] that I was
[1:17:05] Drew back his fist and said I'll break
[1:17:07] every bone in your body
[1:17:11] talks about how people were sinned no
[1:17:13] doubt sitting that are setting out in
[1:17:14] that meeting we're sitting there but
[1:17:16] instead of despising the man
[1:17:19] Grace came in in a moment when I needed
[1:17:23] it
[1:17:25] let me tell you something when you and I
[1:17:27] needed Saving Grace came in
[1:17:29] [Applause]
[1:17:31] when we needed it we didn't work
[1:17:33] ourselves up to it we weren't worthy of
[1:17:35] it but Grace came when we had need of it
[1:17:40] I don't believe consecration that God is
[1:17:43] speaking about tonight is making
[1:17:45] ourselves worthy or working ourselves up
[1:17:47] but it's saying God let me be a channel
[1:17:50] because I don't know the next pasture I
[1:17:53] walk through there might be a bowl
[1:17:56] I don't know the next job situation I
[1:17:59] don't know in my family I don't know in
[1:18:01] the church I don't know here but in
[1:18:03] everything Lord I want to be a useful
[1:18:07] life to you Lord
[1:18:10] Hallelujah
[1:18:12] sometimes you might look at it and say
[1:18:14] well I didn't stop no bull maybe it
[1:18:16] wasn't a bull you were stumping
[1:18:18] maybe somebody on the job was watching
[1:18:21] how you were acting
[1:18:23] and they look back and say
[1:18:25] something's different
[1:18:27] now Dan come and talk to you about it
[1:18:30] but they've watched you for a while
[1:18:31] something's different
[1:18:33] how you're able to endure those things
[1:18:35] and take those things or because that
[1:18:37] what they realize is flesh alone can't
[1:18:39] do that
[1:18:41] right people can be pushed to a certain
[1:18:43] place
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:47] just how it is I love this next this
[1:18:49] next part
[1:18:51] Grace
[1:18:52] sets in and projected a Divine love into
[1:18:56] my heart I love that
[1:18:59] but Ryan I thought it was already in my
[1:19:01] heart it is
[1:19:02] but I'm saying it's already there but
[1:19:05] Grace stepped in when I I couldn't end
[1:19:08] there was no mustering of the strength I
[1:19:11] could not do what was called Grace
[1:19:13] stepped in and projected a Divine love
[1:19:17] into my heart that I could project to
[1:19:21] him
[1:19:22] and thought
[1:19:24] there stands a man
[1:19:27] like I am
[1:19:28] he likes to eat and drink and his family
[1:19:31] but the devil
[1:19:33] has him bound
[1:19:35] so the love of God constrained me and
[1:19:37] the man humbled himself and fell across
[1:19:39] my feet Grace stepped in When Love Was
[1:19:41] projected now was that man changed no
[1:19:44] Brethren tells us he he never was
[1:19:46] changed he wasn't delivered because he
[1:19:48] actually worshiped those spirits
[1:19:51] that's a whole different different
[1:19:52] thought but I want you to think about
[1:19:54] this I loved him now it's not loving the
[1:19:57] expression brother Graham didn't love to
[1:19:59] spit rolling down his face brother Ram
[1:20:01] did not love being called a snake in the
[1:20:03] grass it was not all I just love that no
[1:20:05] you don't that that's not being true
[1:20:07] I loved him what were you loving him
[1:20:11] that I realized beneath this darkness
[1:20:14] that is around him there is a real
[1:20:18] person that would not act this way
[1:20:21] whether they're Christian or not they
[1:20:23] would not act this way
[1:20:26] hallelujah what does that take that
[1:20:28] takes God
[1:20:31] it's like the man with the box of
[1:20:32] chocolates remember his wife was giving
[1:20:34] him all kinds of problems I know I
[1:20:36] preached on that for years but you know
[1:20:38] when every time when he'd come in from a
[1:20:40] meeting but being with brother random
[1:20:41] man all of a sudden she'd start and
[1:20:43] start in on those Pentecostal and it
[1:20:45] wasn't her
[1:20:46] it was a spirit
[1:20:49] right there was influence as she was
[1:20:52] under
[1:20:52] no doubt her church what they taught
[1:20:54] days of Miracles his past and all those
[1:20:56] other things she was she was under the
[1:20:58] influence of that but brother Brian
[1:21:00] remember he would get there out in the
[1:21:01] middle of the floor and brother said
[1:21:03] they would spin around and around and
[1:21:04] around and around him trying to cast
[1:21:06] that devil off of Brethren told him he
[1:21:08] said you go about it all the wrong way
[1:21:16] so sisters if you got a box of
[1:21:18] chocolates tomorrow that don't mean that
[1:21:20] you're got spirits on you
[1:21:23] it just means the husband's another boy
[1:21:25] I'm gonna butter her up good
[1:21:28] well not a lot of amens I mean sister
[1:21:30] should have been shouting praise
[1:21:31] breaking here or something I mean glory
[1:21:34] to God sending them amen's preach it
[1:21:36] brother Samuel
[1:21:37] but a box of chocolates what was it it
[1:21:40] was the expression of love
[1:21:44] you see sometimes when there's needs
[1:21:46] that we're praying for if it don't
[1:21:48] happen in the time frame or we don't
[1:21:50] feel well I don't feel they're still
[1:21:52] acting this way this is still going on
[1:21:55] remember charity never faileth
[1:22:00] oh but it's that no no no no no no
[1:22:03] this this right here had nothing to do
[1:22:06] with the bull with the maniac or with
[1:22:09] the Hornets it had everything to do with
[1:22:11] a man being consecrated to God and God
[1:22:14] being able to step in
[1:22:15] and when God stepped in
[1:22:17] he just yielded to it it was like
[1:22:19] stepping right into a channel just just
[1:22:21] flow with it
[1:22:23] that's that's how I I wanted to be Lord
[1:22:27] maybe my feelings or thoughts or where
[1:22:29] it would be a natural of despising but I
[1:22:32] want to be able to step into that
[1:22:33] channel and when the holy spirit moves
[1:22:35] down just just just run with it just go
[1:22:38] right with the love of God
[1:22:44] so attacking anything it'll never get
[1:22:46] anywhere
[1:22:47] you can't attack a spirit
[1:22:49] it won't it won't work that way it's
[1:22:52] simple care for one another this is
[1:22:54] where First Corinthians 14 1. let me
[1:22:57] just try to at least bring it down to
[1:22:59] this point right here
[1:23:01] first first Corinthians 14 1 follow
[1:23:04] after charity and desire spiritual gifts
[1:23:09] but rather that you may prophesy this is
[1:23:10] important follow after charity
[1:23:15] if you're going to follow pursue pursue
[1:23:18] after make your Pursuit your goal
[1:23:22] follow after charity
[1:23:25] oh it is Charity it's not something
[1:23:27] separate from God
[1:23:28] is love
[1:23:30] this is agape love this is God
[1:23:33] follow after that let that be your focus
[1:23:36] let him be the focus I want you to think
[1:23:39] of this
[1:23:40] this is why it's important on where
[1:23:42] we're keeping ourselves we are living we
[1:23:45] are living in a time of great busyness
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:50] but sometimes when we can all step back
[1:23:53] and really step back right now because
[1:23:55] you see it with young people you see
[1:23:57] whether that everything all across the
[1:24:00] board
[1:24:01] you can go into a restaurant and you see
[1:24:05] people sitting around a table and
[1:24:07] they're not even talking
[1:24:15] come on now
[1:24:17] we've got to be occupied
[1:24:20] we've got to be entertained
[1:24:24] I'm saying it in this manner because
[1:24:27] there's things that God has given us
[1:24:31] when we sat around a dinner table
[1:24:33] when we sat around with one another
[1:24:36] it should be an investing in one another
[1:24:40] Samuel that ain't very deep I'm not
[1:24:42] going to get to where I want to get to
[1:24:43] tonight
[1:24:44] but it's very true
[1:24:48] the art of conversation is almost lost
[1:24:55] and we were made listen that's where we
[1:24:58] were made and the conversations and what
[1:25:01] we would have with one another that's
[1:25:03] where there should be a release within
[1:25:05] our lives I can't get into all those
[1:25:07] things and chemicals and things in our
[1:25:09] body but Satan wants to hijack those
[1:25:11] things
[1:25:13] oh I've got so much going on I just need
[1:25:15] an outlet I just need this I I just need
[1:25:17] this and and we're in a busy time we're
[1:25:19] under pressure
[1:25:21] you see when it comes down to it at the
[1:25:23] end of the day at the end of the day
[1:25:25] what has it done for us I'm friends
[1:25:27] listen I don't believe that God's
[1:25:28] against some pleasure in our life but I
[1:25:30] believe we need to have restrictions
[1:25:33] are you with me I believe that we're a
[1:25:35] people we're talking about ruling and
[1:25:36] reigning in the Millennium I believe we
[1:25:38] are people that ought to be able to say
[1:25:39] to rule and Reign Over our own flesh
[1:25:42] Rule and Reign Even in our own homes
[1:25:45] it's what we keep ourselves to because
[1:25:47] it's not us working ourselves up into
[1:25:50] something but it's recognizing Satan
[1:25:53] would love to do nothing more than to
[1:25:56] clog up our lives
[1:25:59] it's what we're giving ourselves to and
[1:26:01] this is what Jude 1 verse 20 says
[1:26:04] beloved building up yourselves on your
[1:26:08] Most Holy Faith now who's building us up
[1:26:14] building up
[1:26:16] yourselves
[1:26:17] so it's you and I that's responsible
[1:26:21] it's like a person that says well I'm
[1:26:23] not growing so I'm not growing so I'll
[1:26:25] go here I'll go there I'll tell you what
[1:26:27] I'll just go to another church I'm not
[1:26:28] growing really
[1:26:31] you realize growing is not about the
[1:26:34] pastor the word comes forth but you've
[1:26:37] got to give yourself to God
[1:26:40] we have to pray we have to read we have
[1:26:42] to get into the things of God
[1:26:45] right everybody like in the days of
[1:26:48] Nehemiah everybody's got a section of
[1:26:50] the wall and with your family you have a
[1:26:54] section of the war that you're to be
[1:26:56] building with a sword in one hand and a
[1:26:59] trial in the other slapping on the
[1:27:01] bricks
[1:27:03] is that right
[1:27:05] everybody has their responsibility
[1:27:09] building up yourselves on your Most Holy
[1:27:12] Faith praying
[1:27:14] in the Holy Ghost
[1:27:19] it takes more than just praying over
[1:27:20] oatmeal
[1:27:25] I'm friends I'm not talking down to you
[1:27:27] I'm encouraging
[1:27:30] that it's not it's more than just a
[1:27:32] little here a little there but it's
[1:27:34] really seeking after God
[1:27:39] it's talking about a consecration in our
[1:27:41] life we want to see Divine love I'm
[1:27:43] telling you taking the Rapture it's
[1:27:45] going to be divine love taking the
[1:27:46] rapture
[1:27:50] what kept them out of the land brother
[1:27:52] Brahm tells us in turning northward what
[1:27:54] kept them out of the land became so much
[1:27:56] Division and bickering among brothers
[1:27:58] and cutting this one down cutting that
[1:28:00] one down cutting this one down that did
[1:28:03] not allow them to go into the land of
[1:28:05] Canaan
[1:28:07] it'll be divine love
[1:28:10] keep yourselves in the love of God
[1:28:12] looking
[1:28:14] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:17] unto eternal life
[1:28:21] let me just end with this quote here I'm
[1:28:23] ending
[1:28:24] brother Brahm says I can't produce it
[1:28:26] I can't work it up God's got to give it
[1:28:32] I think that's important
[1:28:34] now you see this is why you and I have
[1:28:36] to press in this hour because even
[1:28:39] though you and I can look around and say
[1:28:41] huh what's this Spirit of entitlement
[1:28:44] around here and what's this and what's
[1:28:45] that it's all the spirits of the world
[1:28:47] but do you realize it wants to try to
[1:28:50] infiltrate Even in our lives
[1:28:53] and we're under pressure
[1:28:55] where we can become very weary from the
[1:28:57] toils of life and listen it is it's more
[1:28:59] than just even the laboring with hands
[1:29:02] the laboring with our minds or whatever
[1:29:04] more
[1:29:05] we're fighting against two hundred
[1:29:08] thousand thousand demons
[1:29:12] they've been released from the river
[1:29:14] Euphrates
[1:29:16] spirits on every hand that have been
[1:29:18] released against the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:21] Christ
[1:29:22] and you know what he wants to shut down
[1:29:23] it wants to shut down the moving of the
[1:29:26] Holy Spirit I'm not just talking about
[1:29:28] in the church I'm talking about in our
[1:29:31] individual lives
[1:29:32] he wants to shut down no matter where
[1:29:35] even you're at in your walk with God he
[1:29:37] wants to stifle it if he can
[1:29:42] I say God help me to have discernment
[1:29:45] help me to just stay in a place to where
[1:29:47] my eyes are anointed where I'm sensitive
[1:29:49] then I may not understand what's going
[1:29:51] on but I want to be sensitive enough to
[1:29:54] just step in the flow when Divine love
[1:29:56] is moving I want to step right into it
[1:29:57] and let's just go with it
[1:29:59] that's where I want to be Lord I want to
[1:30:01] be in that place to yield to it when it
[1:30:04] came brother Raymond did try to figure
[1:30:05] out about the maniac or the bull or the
[1:30:07] Hornets he just let go
[1:30:11] brother Graham tells us like this he
[1:30:13] says
[1:30:13] sin
[1:30:15] separate sin by separation talking about
[1:30:17] how God how the Divine love sin had
[1:30:20] separated that Divine love God told Adam
[1:30:22] and Eve not to eat those certain fruits
[1:30:23] and they did Sin brought separation and
[1:30:26] sin by separation brought
[1:30:29] hatred malice strife and envy what
[1:30:33] happened they separated
[1:30:36] from Divine love
[1:30:39] now God didn't that God didn't do this
[1:30:42] they separated themselves from Divine
[1:30:45] love so what happened it opened up
[1:30:49] because we're going to be a channel for
[1:30:51] something
[1:30:52] is that right we're going to be a
[1:30:54] channel we were made to be in channeled
[1:30:56] watch how brother M says this and when
[1:30:59] you
[1:31:00] separate from Divine love
[1:31:03] so if it's talking to me when you
[1:31:06] separate from Divine love
[1:31:09] then you can't overlook your brother's
[1:31:11] mistakes but but it's my brother's
[1:31:13] mistakes but I have no power to overlook
[1:31:15] them when I've separated from Divine
[1:31:18] love so what that lets me know if I
[1:31:21] can't Overlook my brother's mistakes my
[1:31:24] sister's mistakes they're not the
[1:31:26] problem I've got away from the source
[1:31:29] that gives me Grace to overlook it
[1:31:36] when you separate from Divine love then
[1:31:38] you can't overlook your brother's
[1:31:39] mistakes no more you gotta ball him out
[1:31:41] for it you can't Overlook sisters
[1:31:44] mistakes no more
[1:31:45] because
[1:31:47] you've got away
[1:31:49] from that Divine part
[1:31:51] that love part
[1:31:53] but if you really love the Lord Jesus if
[1:31:55] sister or brother does something to you
[1:31:57] oh well that's all right they didn't
[1:32:00] mean to do it that's the kind of love
[1:32:03] that Christ had father forgive them they
[1:32:07] don't know what they're doing
[1:32:11] I believe that that's the degree in the
[1:32:14] groom
[1:32:15] that's the degree
[1:32:17] in the bride
[1:32:19] see it's impossible for you or I that
[1:32:22] doesn't lay within this to overlook
[1:32:25] people's mistakes
[1:32:26] that doesn't lay in here I don't care
[1:32:28] how good your DNA is I don't care how
[1:32:30] much wonderful teaching you had in your
[1:32:33] home thank God for wonderful teaching
[1:32:35] but it takes Divine love
[1:32:39] to be able to over look
[1:32:43] oh my I wish I had more time to preach
[1:32:45] this right now
[1:32:47] said what if he had held my sins against
[1:32:50] me
[1:32:51] what an awful person I was but he loved
[1:32:55] me so well that he forgave me for them
[1:32:58] notice what did he love not my sins
[1:33:02] not my mistakes he loved me
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:09] glory be to God
[1:33:11] when I was undone he forgave me he loved
[1:33:16] me a pure love and when Adam separated
[1:33:19] himself from pure love of keeping God's
[1:33:24] word in his heart
[1:33:26] when he did that these other faculties
[1:33:29] come in Malice Envy strife and hatred
[1:33:37] so whose fault was it
[1:33:39] notice Brother Brad and put it he didn't
[1:33:40] say that serpent no he didn't say oh
[1:33:43] that devil no when Adam
[1:33:46] failed to keep God's word in his heart
[1:33:50] if he would have kept God's word in his
[1:33:52] heart
[1:33:53] then he would have been able there would
[1:33:55] not this would not have entered malice
[1:33:57] in being strive but the Samuel is it
[1:33:59] that simple I believe it is
[1:34:02] I believe it is see it's remember it's
[1:34:04] always Satan's objective to try to make
[1:34:06] the atonement complicated
[1:34:08] brother grandma said like this he said
[1:34:10] God's not complicated
[1:34:12] it's just simple it's just giving
[1:34:13] ourselves to God say Lord this is your
[1:34:16] word it's like tonight when I look at

[1:39:24] loved one of something that they're
[1:39:26] going through and Lord the love of God
[1:39:28] can step down
[1:39:30] and not taking sides with the wrongful
[1:39:33] feeling but the love of God would step
[1:39:36] down and bring it right back to the word
[1:39:38] to where that loved one can be
[1:39:40] stabilized and encouraged and
[1:39:42] strengthened Lord and their eyes can be
[1:39:44] lifted up Lord from looking at the
