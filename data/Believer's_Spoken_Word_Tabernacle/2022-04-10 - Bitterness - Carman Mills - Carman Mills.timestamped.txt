[34:28] a wonderful time to serve the lord
[34:31] it's a terrible time for the world
[34:34] but it's a wonderful time to be serving
[34:36] the lord
[34:37] it's a wonderful time to know
[34:39] we have a sure foundation
[34:42] amen there's a clear direction amen of
[34:44] where we're going
[34:46] know who we are know who it is that's in
[34:48] our midst
[34:49] amen and to know that
[34:51] he's the god of his word
[34:54] he fulfills his word right to the letter
[34:58] he doesn't ask us to
[35:00] in ourselves to fulfill it he just asked
[35:02] us believe it
[35:04] and when we believe it we we act in
[35:06] faith and we know that god he will do
[35:10] what only he can do
[35:12] amen we're just so
[35:14] so grateful for the grace of god this
[35:15] morning
[35:17] thankful to have brother carmen mills
[35:19] here with with us and he'll be
[35:21] ministering the word of the lord to us
[35:22] this morning
[35:23] in just a few moments
[35:26] and uh
[35:27] he had quite an ordeal getting here he
[35:30] was supposed to come in
[35:33] yesterday
[35:34] to be here
[35:35] and
[35:36] as i told you before he wanted to come
[35:38] by just to fellowship and i told him
[35:41] months ago i said well you're not just
[35:43] going to come and fellowship with me if
[35:44] you're coming you're going to speak for
[35:46] me because that's what a real friend
[35:47] would do
[35:48] and it'd be a blessing to the to the
[35:50] body of jesus christ so
[35:53] needless to say all of those things
[35:55] sometimes with um
[35:57] customs and there's certain things they
[35:59] change here or there
[36:00] needless to say
[36:02] he didn't get into his hotel last night
[36:04] till one in the morning
[36:06] so
[36:07] we were able to get him there from the
[36:09] airport
[36:10] after 12 after midnight
[36:12] and so
[36:15] i just i look at it like this with
[36:16] everything that's taken place i just
[36:18] seen it yesterday and we prayed for each
[36:20] time maybe he'd make this connecting
[36:22] this bag would go through and so forth
[36:24] but i told him on the phone i said i'll
[36:26] tell you what's happening satan's
[36:27] fighting this
[36:29] satan's fighting it
[36:31] because god knows
[36:33] god
[36:34] there's things that god's arranged this
[36:36] there's things that god has
[36:39] in store for us this morning and i
[36:41] believe that with all my heart i don't
[36:43] believe meetings or services are just
[36:45] in a coincidence i i don't believe that
[36:48] at all i i watch even as a pastor here i
[36:51] watch how god will change a direction to
[36:54] where as i told you last week i stood
[36:56] here on sunday morning with two outlines
[36:59] which way do i go
[37:02] god knows what he's doing and if how
[37:04] much more
[37:05] god will direct and bring everything
[37:07] around and god will take
[37:09] a gift in a man's life that
[37:11] well for many of you you don't know
[37:13] brother carmen first time you'll meet
[37:15] him
[37:16] but you watch god come down and use that
[37:18] gift
[37:18] he's the same god that came down and
[37:21] stood before abraham's tent door
[37:25] he's the same god who stood there when
[37:27] the pharisees couldn't recognize who he
[37:29] was
[37:31] the greeks couldn't recognize who he was
[37:33] but the believers that were ordained to
[37:35] life could recognize though they
[37:37] couldn't explain it that there is one
[37:40] behind the veil that's doing the
[37:42] speaking and let me just say that that
[37:44] same lord jesus
[37:46] the son of man is right here with us
[37:49] this morning he's the same almighty god
[37:52] he's the same god that dissolves the
[37:54] doubts in sarah's heart the same god who
[37:56] moved to a place to where sarah could
[37:58] look at the word and judge him faithful
[38:02] and receive the strength that was needed
[38:05] in order to bring forth he's the same
[38:07] god this morning
[38:08] and if we can just say god let my eyes
[38:10] be so keen on that let my eyes of our
[38:12] heart be so open to recognize lord you
[38:16] and the needs that i have in my life are
[38:18] right in you and they can be released to
[38:21] me this morning just invite him even as
[38:23] the words come and just invite him
[38:25] because god will take the man of god and
[38:27] direct that gift and god will he's going
[38:29] to speak to us this morning i have the
[38:31] utmost confidence in that brother carmen
[38:34] he and i had met one another
[38:36] uh been over about four years ago
[38:39] there at byc
[38:41] and uh just
[38:43] just really connected just really had a
[38:45] good
[38:46] friendship and
[38:48] things around the word of god to where
[38:50] just such a openness here i you know
[38:52] i've i've got i've got quite a bit of
[38:54] friends like that that you don't have to
[38:57] worry about am i going to step here they
[38:59] believe this or you know i just first of
[39:01] all you just like just let's just be
[39:02] ourselves and we can just lay it all out
[39:05] and i love that and brother carmen he's
[39:08] just that kind of a of a brother and i
[39:10] believe you're really going to be
[39:11] blessed this morning also right after
[39:13] brother carmen ministers we're going to
[39:15] have the baptismal service with sister
[39:18] judith is here to be baptized in the
[39:20] name of the lord jesus christ amen and
[39:24] so
[39:24] any of the other visitors we have here
[39:27] god bless you even my brother back there
[39:29] god bless you this morning amen good to
[39:31] have you back with us
[39:32] amen then this evening or this afternoon
[39:35] i i don't know we'll see where the
[39:37] service will go i'm thinking four
[39:39] o'clock right now but uh for the
[39:41] communion and foot washing but we'll
[39:43] just have to see the way the morning
[39:44] service goes in the time and the reason
[39:46] i've done that instead of always setting
[39:48] a time is because we have even people
[39:50] traveling in and i don't i don't want to
[39:52] create a long lag
[39:54] between the services so we'll just um
[39:57] would that be okay
[39:59] you look and say what other choice do we
[40:01] have
[40:02] but really we try to do is there's not a
[40:04] lag
[40:05] so you don't have to find somewhere to
[40:06] go you can get a bite to eat and then we
[40:08] can come back and have the communion and
[40:10] foot washing and i'm looking at
[40:12] tentatively if possibly that that could
[40:14] probably work at 4 pm but we will set
[40:16] that in stone
[40:18] here right at the end of the of the
[40:20] morning service and
[40:23] so i think that's that's it
[40:26] uh also the prayer requests different
[40:27] ones we've been offering up prayer
[40:30] um
[40:30] for
[40:31] you know continue to keep brother ron
[40:33] spencer in your prayers
[40:35] god will just continue to move for our
[40:37] brother in a special way
[40:39] as well as
[40:41] for
[40:43] sister erica parker for the donny's
[40:45] daughter that we just continued to
[40:48] remember her in prayer both of them
[40:49] dealing with with cancer and um just
[40:52] asking brother donnie was just asking
[40:54] that
[40:55] uh we'd pray that her body would respond
[40:58] to the treatment that she's that she's
[41:01] been going through
[41:02] so we just want to remember them in
[41:04] prayer continue to remember them upon
[41:05] your heart sister linda cavillo as well
[41:08] i just continue to remember them upon
[41:10] your heart and our sister as well she's
[41:12] in very good spirits she's strong
[41:15] everything that she's come through and
[41:17] we just and i just say it like this as
[41:19] he as these needs come to you throughout
[41:21] the day just pray for him you might be
[41:23] at work you might be walking through the
[41:25] supermarket wherever it's at even at
[41:26] that point in time and even outside of
[41:28] your prayer closet just pray for them
[41:30] just bring them up in prayer say god
[41:31] just just move lord for sister linda
[41:34] move lord for those different needs
[41:37] and um

[41:40] special offering this morning for the
[41:41] building project as well and i almost
[41:44] forgot that i'm glad the brothers stood
[41:45] up back there
[41:46] and
[41:48] so if they'll come this morning we'll
[41:49] just ask prayer and then right after we
[41:52] ask prayer and they're taking that up
[41:54] we'll ask and invite brother carmen to
[41:57] come and just minister the word of the
[41:58] lord

[44:22] [Music]
[44:30] the truth that sets
[44:33] me free
[44:35] [Music]
[44:37] according
[44:46] to me
[44:53] [Music]
[44:57] according to
[44:59] your lord
[45:05] to
[45:06] your promises
[45:09] [Music]
[45:15] [Music]
[45:18] upon
[45:19] my heart
[45:22] the
[45:23] truth that sets me
[45:27] [Music]
[45:28] [Applause]
[45:30] according to
[45:32] your word oh
[45:35] [Music]
[45:44] lord well it's good to be with you this
[45:47] morning
[45:49] good to be in the house of the lord this
[45:51] morning
[45:52] how many of you come looking for the
[45:54] lord to speak
[45:56] that's good
[45:58] because i don't have anything to offer
[46:00] but he certainly does
[46:02] man and so if we can just get ourselves
[46:04] as often as said we can get ourselves
[46:06] out of the way and just let him use us
[46:08] just like this microphone allows you to
[46:10] hear me
[46:11] then maybe he can say something to you
[46:14] one nice thing and i like about going to
[46:16] a new place is
[46:18] is you know i don't know yet
[46:20] i know brother sanchez i know our
[46:23] brother and his family
[46:24] i don't know you but he
[46:26] does and i'll speak very direct and
[46:29] things like that
[46:31] but you know if the pastor says it you
[46:33] can say well he was preaching right at
[46:35] me
[46:36] but if i do it you can say god was
[46:38] preaching right at me
[46:40] so because i don't know you and i and
[46:42] i'll tell you in advance i'm not here to
[46:45] to bring anything new
[46:46] i'm not here to
[46:48] try to make an impression
[46:50] i don't do that
[46:52] but if the lord could use me to help
[46:54] somebody for the derral ward you all
[46:56] know him he preaches a message he calls
[46:59] it his icebreaker message
[47:01] called for the sake of one
[47:03] and i i
[47:05] really like to operate that way so
[47:07] sometimes even how the lord leads me i
[47:09] may speak on the subject i'm speaking on
[47:10] this morning might only resonate with
[47:12] one or two
[47:13] i'm not concerned about if everybody
[47:15] gets something out of it i want to i
[47:17] want to be able to be used for that one
[47:19] that may be in a particular spot
[47:22] maybe there can be something said for
[47:23] that one because jesus you know would
[47:26] would go long journey sometimes for the
[47:29] sake of one
[47:30] and so if i can just be yielded to the
[47:33] lord maybe he can speak to one
[47:35] amen so just just a short background
[47:37] before we pray
[47:39] we're
[47:40] from uh eastern canada into brunswick
[47:43] just east of maine been there for
[47:46] well i've been there all my life the
[47:47] church was established in the late 60s
[47:50] or maybe in 1970 we built a church a
[47:52] message come our way in the
[47:54] mid latter 60s my father was in
[47:56] pentecost at the time when he received
[47:59] the message and then brother carr who's
[48:01] currently the pastor still the pastor
[48:03] there and preaching at 92 years old and
[48:07] preaching the message ever since he came
[48:09] in just shortly after my father my
[48:11] father was not called to the ministry
[48:13] but he was we've always supported the
[48:15] work there and i married one of his his
[48:17] daughters and so he's my father and i
[48:20] assist there in the ministry i minister
[48:21] every week there and
[48:23] the lord has done some amazing things
[48:25] over the years we certainly have seen
[48:27] the hand of god move our church is
[48:29] called works of faith assembling we
[48:31] certainly have seen god work
[48:34] when we've been able to acquire faith
[48:36] god has some miraculous things at times
[48:38] and healings and
[48:40] supernatural things
[48:42] but we've also seen the devil work as
[48:44] you have too
[48:45] you know he certainly makes his presence
[48:47] known but but we still serve a living
[48:50] god
[48:51] and is able to do anything that he ever
[48:52] did he can do today i believe that so
[48:56] uh so i was raised
[48:58] a little bit in the pentecostal church
[48:59] but i was young when we came out of it
[49:01] into the message so i'm one of those
[49:04] message kids as you might say
[49:06] but been serving the lord for over 50
[49:08] years in the message and i've been
[49:10] preaching for about 40 maybe a little
[49:12] over 40 years preaching this message
[49:14] so uh i still believe it's true
[49:18] i still believe it's enough
[49:20] to get us through i don't believe
[49:22] there's any other message we need i
[49:24] believe it's enough we can just apply
[49:26] ourselves to it amen
[49:28] so this morning i'll get you to stand as
[49:30] we would pray and that and as was
[49:32] already mentioned i want to remember
[49:34] sister eric brother donnie reached out
[49:36] to me this morning to say that sister
[49:37] eric is going for treatments again
[49:39] tomorrow and asked if we would pray and
[49:41] i told him i was here visiting that i
[49:43] would mention it to you folks so just
[49:45] remember her as as my brother mentioned
[49:47] in your prayers not just now but later i
[49:50] got i have daughters and i i know if it
[49:52] was my daughter i'd want everybody
[49:54] i could get a hold of to pray and so
[49:57] that's why i really
[49:58] would not like us to reach out for her
[50:00] today but also down the road because
[50:02] many times these trials are not just a
[50:05] day or two you know they drag on and
[50:07] you need faith for those rough times and
[50:09] so i just believe the lord can minister
[50:11] to her need and and everybody's need
[50:13] today let's just let's just come speak
[50:15] to the lord this morning
[50:17] lord we come to you
[50:19] lord recognizing that in ourselves we
[50:22] have no
[50:23] value at all lord
[50:25] our efforts are worth nothing lord if it
[50:27] isn't for
[50:28] your grace and mercy to work in us and
[50:30] through us and so this morning we come
[50:32] to you
[50:33] lord we come and appeal to your grace
[50:36] to
[50:37] reach out to those that are in need
[50:38] today we think of sister erica that's
[50:40] going for these cancer treatments
[50:42] brother spencer also with
[50:44] dealing with cancer for a number of
[50:45] years now and and others lord we ask
[50:48] that your hand of mercy would reach down
[50:51] upon them once again lord and touch
[50:53] their bodies and bring them healing and
[50:55] if it it be that you're taking them
[50:57] through this route to their healing lord
[51:00] we we're fine but lord just give them
[51:02] strength and give them faith as they go
[51:04] through this trial
[51:05] lord bless this part of the service this
[51:07] morning again
[51:08] we offer ourselves to you
[51:11] that you would take complete and utter
[51:13] control of this vessel that lord i would
[51:16] not
[51:16] have any of my own thoughts or words to
[51:19] to say but it may be yours lord and for
[51:22] those that are here that are in need and
[51:24] maybe they don't even know
[51:26] they have a need but you do lord and may
[51:28] you speak to them we pray through your
[51:31] word this morning we ask in jesus name
[51:34] amen
[51:36] let us read from exodus chapter 15
[51:39] two verses of scripture
[51:41] verses 22
[51:43] and 23.
[51:50] exodus 15
[51:52] verses 22
[51:55] 23
[51:59] so moses brought israel from the red sea
[52:04] they went out into the wilderness of
[52:05] shore
[52:06] and they went three days
[52:08] in the wilderness and found no water
[52:11] when they came tomorrow they could not
[52:12] drink of the waters of mara for they
[52:14] were bitter
[52:16] therefore the name of it was called
[52:18] mara
[52:20] it may be seated
[52:24] i want to speak this morning on the
[52:26] thought
[52:27] of bitterness
[52:29] and in a little while i want to speak on
[52:31] the root appearance
[52:35] and as i said you know this this migrate
[52:38] over the top of people's heads because
[52:40] it's not relevant you're not in that
[52:41] situation but
[52:43] uh there might be one here there might
[52:45] be somebody you know i've spoken this a
[52:48] number of places and i was quite
[52:49] surprised
[52:50] in myself of the people that
[52:53] connected with it and the people that
[52:55] were struggling
[52:56] with this thing
[52:58] sometimes we think well we're so far
[52:59] along that these things shouldn't even
[53:00] be an issue anymore
[53:02] but you know we're not all in the same
[53:04] place in our walk
[53:06] every church you know you have people
[53:07] that are so far along you have people
[53:09] that are just starting out and
[53:11] and so we have these struggles and of
[53:13] course all of us no matter how far we
[53:15] are along the devil is is after us
[53:18] so he walks about as a roaring lion
[53:20] seeking whom he may devour you're not
[53:23] immune from his attacks the prophet said
[53:25] there's there's never a day that goes by
[53:27] that the devil is not punching at you
[53:30] and i think if you serve the lord you
[53:31] know that to be true
[53:33] he doesn't give you much of a break the
[53:35] bible says you know to resist the devil
[53:37] and he will flee from you
[53:38] but he doesn't flee for very long
[53:40] not very long and he's back
[53:43] you're in a service you're in a youth
[53:44] camp you know how many times i've spoke
[53:45] to the youth and they get so excited at
[53:48] these youth camps and and they have an
[53:50] experience i remember a young man that
[53:52] we brought from home
[53:54] he hadn't been going to church him and
[53:55] his brother hadn't been going to church
[53:57] but they wanted to go to youth camp and
[53:58] sir come to youth camp
[54:00] and and they come to the youth camp and
[54:02] the older brother the younger brother
[54:04] nothing happened he went back the same
[54:05] but the older brother seemed to really
[54:07] get a hold of something we thought you
[54:09] know we were thinking maybe he did he
[54:10] was a bit more social he got in with the
[54:12] youth and he
[54:14] really seemed to like something was
[54:15] happening and he got caught up in the
[54:17] atmosphere of the meeting and even at
[54:19] one point when they had testimonies he
[54:21] he stood up and talked about how the
[54:23] lord had met him and had freed him from
[54:26] from things you know and so we
[54:28] were very happy to hear that
[54:31] but once you get out of that atmosphere
[54:33] and we drove back home
[54:35] he never actually came back to church
[54:37] again he went immediately back to the
[54:39] same place he left
[54:40] and so
[54:42] the devil never leaves you alone but
[54:44] when you're in these environments of of
[54:45] camp and even in service this morning as
[54:47] the spirit of the lord might begin to
[54:49] work you're going to start to feel
[54:51] something maybe and the lord begins to
[54:52] and you feel confident but
[54:54] but sometimes we don't press all the way
[54:56] through and get that real deliverance we
[54:58] need so then you walk out and as soon as
[55:00] you're out that door the devil won't
[55:01] bother you in here but when you go at
[55:03] that door when you're alone away from
[55:05] the people he comes in
[55:08] but if god really comes down and doesn't
[55:10] work in your life
[55:11] then you've got somebody that's there
[55:13] with you the bible says i can do all
[55:14] things through christ which strengthens
[55:16] me
[55:17] but if you don't have that then you're
[55:19] like the sons of skiva you try to rebuke
[55:21] the devil and he says who are you
[55:23] who are you
[55:25] but you know if god comes in a lot
[55:27] can be done and you can overcome
[55:29] anything the devil throws your way
[55:32] as we look at the scripture
[55:35] here
[55:36] israel had come out of egypt went
[55:38] through the red sea and you remember
[55:39] they were rejoicing
[55:41] three days before the scripture they
[55:43] were rejoicing
[55:44] thanking the lord they saw a miracle
[55:47] take place of god and yet three days
[55:50] after
[55:51] they encounter a trial in the wilderness
[55:54] and all of a sudden they're murmuring
[55:56] and they're complaining how quickly
[55:59] the sound of the timbrel
[56:00] timbrel changed to the sound of
[56:02] murmuring
[56:03] how easily it is
[56:05] and all of a sudden they're murmuring
[56:07] what's going on what are we going to do
[56:08] you brought us out into the wilderness
[56:10] and all of these things
[56:11] how quickly how quickly after a great
[56:13] meeting you know when the power of god
[56:15] comes and all of a sudden the devil
[56:16] comes right after and you think
[56:18] and he tries to undo everything that
[56:20] you've you've thought you've gained in
[56:22] those services in those meetings and in
[56:24] those times
[56:27] we'll say sometimes you know make great
[56:28] statements when the lord's
[56:30] presence is among us
[56:32] i shall not be moved i'll stand and yet
[56:35] tomorrow we're tossed about on the
[56:37] stormy seas
[56:39] how easily it is you know with humanity
[56:42] we're changeable there's so much about
[56:45] this world that is changeable with god
[56:47] we know he's the unchangeable god
[56:49] but with us things change a lot
[56:53] and so
[56:54] the only thing that we can really have
[56:55] confidence in are the things not so much
[56:57] the things we see but the things that we
[56:59] don't see
[57:01] and so they they come to this place
[57:04] these bitter waters
[57:06] of mara and they had been used to the
[57:08] waters of the nile in egypt great waters
[57:10] good waters to drink now they're coming
[57:12] to these bitter waters of mara
[57:16] and what were they going to do what was
[57:18] going to happen they began to get
[57:20] bitter
[57:21] it was a bitter experience in a very
[57:23] literal sense
[57:25] and so as we as we introduce this
[57:26] thought of bitterness i wanted to define
[57:28] it firstly
[57:30] bitterness is a is a is a chronic and a
[57:33] pervasive state of smoldering resentment
[57:35] that's how it's defined
[57:37] sometimes it's it's described as as
[57:41] holding on to or showing feelings of
[57:43] resentment animosity or vindictiveness
[57:47] other words we use to describe
[57:48] bitterness sometimes are
[57:50] are are people who are merciless who are
[57:53] unforgiving or hold a grudge
[57:56] and often with bitterness a person who's
[57:59] bitter has a perception that some
[58:01] injustice has been done
[58:03] to them
[58:05] the bible says in the proverbs that a
[58:07] brother offended is harder harder to be
[58:10] won than a strong city
[58:13] we have to be careful in our testimony i
[58:16] i've known people that have been so
[58:18] zealous for god that they're careless in
[58:20] some ways and very vending to people in
[58:22] the world that may be living not such
[58:24] good lives and instead of being a
[58:26] testimony
[58:27] for the lord the prophet said there
[58:29] needs to be an attractiveness to the
[58:30] gospel
[58:31] but sometimes we are so vindictive that
[58:34] the world looks at us and said why would
[58:35] i want to have what you have
[58:38] you preach at them and then you say i
[58:39] want you to be like me well they don't
[58:41] want to be like you
[58:43] brother branham said we need to project
[58:45] love that's the only thing that's going
[58:47] to save the sinner is the love of god
[58:49] not the vindictiveness and
[58:51] not that kind of approach
[58:54] but this bitterness as we take this
[58:56] example in the scripture where did it
[58:57] come from well in the case of mara it
[58:59] came
[59:00] you know the waters and the earth are
[59:02] really generally pure but they come up
[59:04] through these desert sands and they type
[59:08] the earth and that earth in fact the
[59:10] desert sands was what tainted the water
[59:13] and made it bitter
[59:14] and we know that earth
[59:16] is a type of sin when god supplied water
[59:19] you remember came out of the rock didn't
[59:21] come from the earth
[59:23] and so a lot of times the experiences
[59:25] with the lord that should be sweet to us
[59:26] sometimes because of our own sins
[59:28] and our own failings cause those
[59:31] experiences to be bitter when otherwise
[59:33] they should be sweet
[59:36] and so
[59:38] but what's interesting about this this
[59:40] situation that god put them in he knew
[59:42] they were going to be facing this trial
[59:47] and so
[59:48] we have better trials too and he knows
[59:50] every trial that comes before it arrives
[59:53] so yesterday when i come here i had all
[59:55] plans to be here in the middle of the
[59:56] afternoon
[59:58] i had a delayed flight but i had a big
[59:59] layover i thought i had lots of time and
[1:00:01] then it was just chaos as i missed the
[1:00:05] flight and all these things that i they
[1:00:07] had to go through and it would have been
[1:00:08] very easy
[1:00:09] and very tempting to get
[1:00:11] bitter and angry and frustrated but i've
[1:00:14] learned a long time ago that doesn't
[1:00:16] really help a whole lot
[1:00:18] and in this day and age if you're in an
[1:00:20] airport and you get frustrated very much
[1:00:21] it could cause you lots of grief
[1:00:23] as you know
[1:00:25] so
[1:00:26] but god knows how and god wasn't i was
[1:00:30] surprised that all this happened in some
[1:00:31] ways but god knew it was going to happen
[1:00:33] before i did
[1:00:35] and he knew what the solution would be
[1:00:37] before i did
[1:00:38] and how it was going to be and how it
[1:00:40] would work out
[1:00:41] and so
[1:00:42] you know god never gets frustrated
[1:00:44] he never gets upset he's never shocked
[1:00:47] we get shocked we get surprised but he
[1:00:49] never is
[1:00:50] because he knows everything he knows
[1:00:52] everything that's going to take place he
[1:00:53] knows the end
[1:00:54] from the beginning
[1:00:57] well god knows how
[1:00:58] to sweeten the bitter waters of any
[1:01:01] trial that we face he knows how to do
[1:01:03] that
[1:01:06] and when there is a problem that you
[1:01:08] face when there is a trial that you face
[1:01:10] there's always a remedy
[1:01:13] spurgeon once said that as as soon as we
[1:01:16] have a prayer
[1:01:18] god has a remedy
[1:01:20] but that's the thing when we have the
[1:01:22] trial do we pray about it do we go to
[1:01:25] the lord and say i have this thing i
[1:01:26] don't know what to do about it or do we
[1:01:28] just charge in and try to solve it
[1:01:30] ourselves
[1:01:33] often we just make things worse when we
[1:01:35] do that
[1:01:36] prayer is always the answer that we
[1:01:38] should start with not end with
[1:01:41] and say lord what is this about i don't
[1:01:42] know what it's about i don't know where
[1:01:44] it's going but but i need some help
[1:01:47] and we could criticize israel for their
[1:01:49] unbelief and say well they should have
[1:01:50] knew better they look what god just did
[1:01:52] for them but but how often have we done
[1:01:55] the same thing as that
[1:01:56] how often have we done the same thing
[1:01:59] and so god you know always has a remedy
[1:02:02] for every problem for every trial for
[1:02:04] every test he has a remedy
[1:02:06] and and often the remedy is in place
[1:02:08] there before the trial is even there
[1:02:12] that's the interesting part about it and
[1:02:14] the interesting thing here in the
[1:02:16] scripture if you notice in this
[1:02:17] scripture we're still in exodus 15.
[1:02:21] i want to i want to draw your attention
[1:02:23] to exodus 15 and verse 25.
[1:02:27] so moses did
[1:02:29] as in a good example to us
[1:02:31] the bible says he cried unto the lord
[1:02:34] that's what he should have did we have a
[1:02:35] problem here lord what are we going to
[1:02:37] do
[1:02:39] but notice what happens here the lord
[1:02:42] showed him a tree
[1:02:45] where did that tree come from
[1:02:47] you know that tree was always there
[1:02:50] a tree
[1:02:51] grew
[1:02:52] sometime dozens of years ago maybe
[1:02:54] hundreds of years ago
[1:02:58] sea germinated up a sitting there
[1:03:00] lived its entire life
[1:03:03] for this moment
[1:03:04] that was its purpose it was born
[1:03:06] as jesus was born to die
[1:03:09] that was his purpose
[1:03:11] it was ignored how many people would
[1:03:12] have walked out there walked by those
[1:03:14] waters walked in the desert perhaps
[1:03:16] and saw this tree and never gave it no
[1:03:18] heed
[1:03:20] but it had a great purpose it just
[1:03:22] hadn't fulfilled it yet but it was there
[1:03:24] it was the remedy
[1:03:25] the problem just hadn't arrived yet but
[1:03:28] the remedy was already there the tree
[1:03:30] was there
[1:03:31] and of course he cuts down the tree the
[1:03:33] tree had to give its life in this case
[1:03:36] to answer the problem it cast the tree
[1:03:39] into the waters the waters were made
[1:03:40] sweet
[1:03:42] and there he made them a statue in an
[1:03:43] ordinance and he proved them and so
[1:03:46] you know for every
[1:03:48] bitter well there is a healing tree
[1:03:51] for every door that's locked there's a
[1:03:53] key
[1:03:55] for every trouble in your life in my
[1:03:57] life there's a remedy
[1:03:59] god has a remedy and often that remedy
[1:04:00] is there on hand before the trial is
[1:04:03] there
[1:04:04] but we sometimes can't see it the tree
[1:04:07] was there they were all there they saw
[1:04:08] the tree but they didn't know that was
[1:04:09] their answer
[1:04:11] they didn't know that's what that was
[1:04:12] going to get them out of their problem
[1:04:14] but it was there
[1:04:16] and we know the cross jesus came to die
[1:04:19] on a cruel tree as it were
[1:04:22] we know that in that lies the answer
[1:04:25] and in there lies the power to make any
[1:04:28] bitter trial
[1:04:30] sweet any bitter waters sweet
[1:04:34] when a believer suffers an important
[1:04:36] thing to understand is sometimes we
[1:04:38] equate suffering with punishment but
[1:04:40] there is no wrath of god in a believer's
[1:04:42] suffering
[1:04:44] there is no wrath of god when when when
[1:04:47] suffering comes to a believer it's not
[1:04:49] coming so much from god's hand like we
[1:04:51] would discipline our children but it's
[1:04:53] really coming from his heart
[1:04:55] you remember the scripture in the new
[1:04:57] testament that talks about how fathers
[1:04:59] raised their children and said you know
[1:05:01] they chastise us for their benefit for
[1:05:03] their profit how many fathers and
[1:05:04] mothers sometimes you know they get
[1:05:06] angry and they discipline their children
[1:05:07] because they're frustrated
[1:05:09] but the bible says when he chastises us
[1:05:11] it's always for us our benefit
[1:05:14] always for us every test every trial
[1:05:16] every suffering you go through it's for
[1:05:18] us
[1:05:18] it's for our good it's for some purpose
[1:05:21] that god has everything god does
[1:05:23] to a believer is with intention
[1:05:26] it's not arbitrary it's with intention
[1:05:29] and it's for your benefit
[1:05:32] therefore trials are not to make us
[1:05:34] bitter but better
[1:05:37] they're to make us better not bitter
[1:05:41] and so
[1:05:43] the other thing to notice about this
[1:05:44] scripture before we move on
[1:05:48] is that
[1:05:49] god did not say okay these waters are no
[1:05:52] good
[1:05:53] i'm going to take you over here and give
[1:05:54] you good water
[1:05:55] he took the same waters that were bitter
[1:05:58] and made them sweet
[1:06:01] you've heard that song probably you know
[1:06:03] sometimes
[1:06:04] the lord calms the storm but sometimes
[1:06:07] he calms me
[1:06:08] he doesn't always take you out of the
[1:06:10] trial he doesn't always remove the trial
[1:06:12] sometimes he just
[1:06:14] allows you to get through it and makes
[1:06:16] that bitter trial sweet
[1:06:18] it's not always about sometimes we pray
[1:06:20] lord deliver me deliver me take me out
[1:06:21] of this no that there may be a purpose
[1:06:23] for that
[1:06:24] but he can make that trial something
[1:06:27] manageable something tolerable something
[1:06:28] that's not a bitter experience because
[1:06:31] the prophet has said that god doesn't
[1:06:32] want us to be
[1:06:34] unhappy he made us human beings were
[1:06:36] made to be happy we were designed that
[1:06:38] way and god wants that but that doesn't
[1:06:40] mean we're not going to have trial
[1:06:43] there's a story
[1:06:44] uh i'll relate it i have a lot here so i
[1:06:46] don't want to do it if everyone knows
[1:06:48] it's about the carrots the eggs and the
[1:06:50] coffee beans have you heard that
[1:06:54] okay
[1:06:55] a young woman went to her mother
[1:06:58] complaining about her life and how
[1:07:00] things were so hard for her she didn't
[1:07:02] know how she was going to make it and
[1:07:04] wanted to give up and it's surprising
[1:07:05] this was a young woman going to remind
[1:07:07] it's a story but there's a lot of truth
[1:07:08] to it and i can tell you that in the
[1:07:10] real world there are a lot of young not
[1:07:12] just young women but young people
[1:07:14] even children my my my wife works in the
[1:07:17] art as a nurse there and there
[1:07:19] i hear stories many times of young
[1:07:21] children sometimes 9 10 years old to
[1:07:23] come in
[1:07:24] that
[1:07:26] want to commit suicide that feel they
[1:07:28] have no purpose in life they don't see
[1:07:30] anything they don't see any future well
[1:07:31] a child that age
[1:07:33] that should not even be a thought that
[1:07:34] enters their mind but that's the kind of
[1:07:36] age that we live in
[1:07:38] and so she was like that this woman she
[1:07:40] was just didn't know how she was going
[1:07:41] to make it so
[1:07:42] tired of fighting
[1:07:44] well the mother brought her into the
[1:07:46] kitchen and she
[1:07:47] took three pots and put them on the
[1:07:49] stove and put water in them and
[1:07:51] set them to boil
[1:07:53] she put
[1:07:54] raw carrots in one
[1:07:56] eggs in the other and beans in the third
[1:07:58] one coffee beans
[1:08:00] and she
[1:08:01] let them go for about 20 minutes she
[1:08:02] turned off the burners brought them out
[1:08:06] put the carrots on
[1:08:07] in a bowl and the egg
[1:08:09] and then the coffee
[1:08:10] was there and she said what do you see
[1:08:12] and of course she didn't see a whole lot
[1:08:13] more than what started carrots eggs and
[1:08:15] coffee
[1:08:17] and she said what's the point
[1:08:20] well the mother started to explain
[1:08:22] to her that each of these these objects
[1:08:24] faced the same adversity which was the
[1:08:27] boiling water
[1:08:29] but each of them reacted in a different
[1:08:31] way
[1:08:32] so you had the raw carrots they they
[1:08:35] went in hard unrelenting you know people
[1:08:37] like that
[1:08:38] tough
[1:08:39] but the bitterness of trials and
[1:08:41] experiences and you may all know people
[1:08:43] like that i know people like that
[1:08:45] that had an answer for everything but
[1:08:48] over the years
[1:08:49] those trials beat them down i had a
[1:08:51] brother tell me one time his children
[1:08:52] went to the world one became homosexual
[1:08:55] and things and he just said he said i i
[1:08:57] don't have any fight left in me
[1:08:59] and so
[1:09:00] that's what trials can do
[1:09:02] now the egg's very different it was soft
[1:09:04] and malleable you see people like that
[1:09:05] too just very fragile
[1:09:07] with the bitterness of trials and the
[1:09:09] adversity of the hot water
[1:09:11] they become hard-boiled
[1:09:13] become hard
[1:09:14] very opposite to what it started
[1:09:17] but the coffee beans was very different
[1:09:20] the coffee beans
[1:09:22] transformed the water
[1:09:25] the very thing that should have
[1:09:27] destroyed it was the thing that actually
[1:09:28] brought out
[1:09:30] what good is what's the coffee
[1:09:34] and so which one are you
[1:09:36] that's what she asked her i asked you i
[1:09:38] asked me which one am i
[1:09:41] when trials come that adversity comes
[1:09:44] how do you respond what does it do to
[1:09:45] you
[1:09:46] does it change you or do you change it
[1:09:49] you change the circumstance
[1:09:51] if you are like the coffee bean then
[1:09:52] when things are at their worst you get
[1:09:54] better and you change the situation
[1:09:56] around you how do you handle adversity
[1:09:59] how do you handle trials
[1:10:04] paul said in romans you know that we
[1:10:05] glory the tribulations
[1:10:08] knowing the tribulations worketh
[1:10:10] patience
[1:10:11] remember these things are always with
[1:10:13] intent god wants to bring there's some
[1:10:14] good things in you and then me and so
[1:10:17] these trials are not designed to make us
[1:10:19] bitter or or
[1:10:20] the the way the carrots and the eggs are
[1:10:22] no it's designed to bring out these
[1:10:24] attributes of god
[1:10:26] that he puts in your life and it takes
[1:10:28] the trial to do that
[1:10:30] so we shouldn't reject that we shouldn't
[1:10:32] say i don't want that no it's and not
[1:10:34] that we embrace them either nobody wants
[1:10:36] a trial
[1:10:37] but understanding that when it comes it
[1:10:38] must be that god has something
[1:10:40] he wants to do with me
[1:10:46] trials as i said are to make us better
[1:10:48] not bitter
[1:10:49] in fact the bible says in psalms you
[1:10:51] know the scripture when david talked
[1:10:53] about search me oh god know me and try
[1:10:55] me try me david actually prayed that the
[1:10:58] lord would try me and know my thoughts
[1:11:01] now
[1:11:02] you know if we meet these trials head on
[1:11:04] and god delivers us take us through
[1:11:07] then the bitter experiences that we have
[1:11:09] don't have to be something that develops
[1:11:11] into a much more serious problem that we
[1:11:14] want to go to look at in hebrews and
[1:11:16] that is something called the root
[1:11:19] of bitterness
[1:11:21] i want to go to hebrews 12
[1:11:25] and verse begin at verse 14 and 15 and
[1:11:27] we're going to kind of tear these
[1:11:29] scriptures apart a little bit and and
[1:11:31] see what we can learn of it
[1:11:36] hebrews 12
[1:11:37] 14 and 15.
[1:11:41] it says
[1:11:42] to follow peace with all men and
[1:11:44] holiness without which no man
[1:11:46] shall see the lord
[1:11:48] notice the verse 15 that we're going to
[1:11:50] focus on looking diligently
[1:11:53] lest any man fail of the grace of god so
[1:11:58] notice the advice and then where he goes
[1:12:00] with it lest any men fail of the grace
[1:12:02] of god
[1:12:03] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:12:07] trouble you
[1:12:08] and thereby many be defiled
[1:12:11] so we are warned in the scripture not to
[1:12:13] fail not to be left behind not to miss
[1:12:16] the grace of god and what is the issue
[1:12:18] it's this root of bitterness springing
[1:12:21] up
[1:12:22] well let's talk about that this root of
[1:12:24] bitterness we know what a root is it's
[1:12:26] something that
[1:12:28] germinates underground it stays
[1:12:30] underground as long as it's rooted and
[1:12:31] the roots are generally always
[1:12:33] underground they're not visible to the
[1:12:35] naked eye we can't see the roots
[1:12:37] conditioned from above the ground
[1:12:39] generally
[1:12:40] it can lie dormant sometimes for months
[1:12:43] it can even lie dormant for years in
[1:12:45] some cases
[1:12:47] and such is the case with the root of
[1:12:50] bitterness there's a tree i read about
[1:12:52] called the chinese bamboo and the
[1:12:54] chinese bamboo has a root that forms in
[1:12:57] it
[1:12:58] for something like four years and in the
[1:13:01] fifth year
[1:13:02] so it grows underground undetected you
[1:13:05] could walk over it don't even know it's
[1:13:07] there and then in the fifth year it
[1:13:08] springs forth
[1:13:10] and it says about the chinese bamboo
[1:13:12] that it can grow to 90 feet in six weeks
[1:13:16] growing as much as three feet in a
[1:13:17] single day
[1:13:20] so that's how powerful this springing
[1:13:22] for because we want to take this analogy
[1:13:24] to the scripture here in a moment
[1:13:26] something else
[1:13:27] another example i want to just highlight
[1:13:29] as we go
[1:13:31] minister one time
[1:13:33] tells a story that in the springtime he
[1:13:35] went out and found
[1:13:38] something on the ground that looked like
[1:13:40] a
[1:13:40] the way he described it looked like the
[1:13:42] lid off of a of an indian basket that's
[1:13:44] how we described it it was like a woven
[1:13:46] perfectly flat
[1:13:49] he took it he brought it into the house
[1:13:51] and when it get in the house where it
[1:13:52] was warm
[1:13:53] the thing suddenly uncoiled and he
[1:13:55] realized that it was a snake
[1:13:58] so there was a trigger there the heat
[1:14:01] and just like with root of bitterness as
[1:14:02] we'll talk about sometimes the heat of
[1:14:04] trials at that root that's there that is
[1:14:07] what causes it
[1:14:09] to spring forth but before we talk about
[1:14:12] how about the springing forth we need to
[1:14:14] talk about how does this thing form in
[1:14:15] the first place of where so that we can
[1:14:17] watch out because we don't want
[1:14:19] any bitter experience and trial that we
[1:14:21] face has the potential to become one of
[1:14:23] these roots of bitterness
[1:14:26] but you know a root this is very simple
[1:14:28] stuff but it's very true
[1:14:30] and so for anyone who knows anything
[1:14:32] about gardening you know what does it
[1:14:33] take for a root to form well it takes
[1:14:35] two things
[1:14:36] it takes a seed
[1:14:37] and it takes soil
[1:14:39] you just need seed and salt that's all
[1:14:41] you need but you got to have both
[1:14:43] the seed of bitterness is something we
[1:14:45] all have experienced and that is a hurt
[1:14:48] some kind of a hurt something's happened
[1:14:52] to hurt you and every one of us have
[1:14:53] been hurt in our lifetime
[1:14:55] you can't live in this world and not be
[1:14:57] hurt
[1:14:58] sometimes it's intentional
[1:15:00] sometimes you know there's just people
[1:15:01] in the world that are just that are just
[1:15:03] nasty they're just
[1:15:04] do things to hurt and they do it
[1:15:06] deliberately
[1:15:08] but i want to make the point that it
[1:15:10] doesn't matter
[1:15:11] how the hurt comes
[1:15:13] that's not the point it's still a seed
[1:15:14] of hurt and it still has that potential
[1:15:17] it's what you do with it whether or not
[1:15:19] it becomes a root of bitterness it could
[1:15:21] be intentional it could be unintentional
[1:15:24] and there's a lot of those that happen i
[1:15:25] had a sister come to me one time
[1:15:27] apologizing for something that i
[1:15:29] she thought or
[1:15:31] and i couldn't even relate to it i
[1:15:32] didn't know what it was i didn't have
[1:15:34] any animosity i didn't have you know but
[1:15:36] sometimes people get offended
[1:15:39] over something that there was never any
[1:15:41] intention but it's still a hurt to them
[1:15:43] it's still real to them when they have
[1:15:44] that experience
[1:15:46] and and we shouldn't be dismissive of it
[1:15:48] i've known people to get upset you know
[1:15:51] over just small things sometimes but
[1:15:52] it's real to them
[1:15:54] it's a real problem to them and then
[1:15:55] they get hurt
[1:15:57] sometimes it's real
[1:15:59] sometimes it's intentional sometimes
[1:16:01] it's unintentional sometimes it's just
[1:16:02] imagined there wasn't nothing at all
[1:16:05] nothing even happened somebody you know
[1:16:06] you walk by somebody they don't shake
[1:16:07] your hand you've all heard that you know
[1:16:09] the preacher didn't shake your hand well
[1:16:11] it
[1:16:12] you know sometimes i've walked by people
[1:16:13] many times their minds on something you
[1:16:16] walk right by them maybe they had their
[1:16:17] hands i didn't see it
[1:16:19] you know but people know me enough now
[1:16:20] to know i would never do that you know
[1:16:22] there's a saying and it's not even from
[1:16:24] any religious person that
[1:16:26] it says you know that
[1:16:27] when men speak ill of you it's actually
[1:16:29] from plato which is not that i follow
[1:16:31] philosophy but i i like if it's true
[1:16:34] it's true
[1:16:35] when men speak ill of you live so that
[1:16:37] nobody believes them
[1:16:38] and that's always been
[1:16:40] my principle
[1:16:42] i've had people say things you know but
[1:16:45] when i look at that someone who says
[1:16:46] something about me that's untrue
[1:16:48] i look at it sometimes and i say well
[1:16:50] they they clearly don't know me the
[1:16:52] people that know me
[1:16:53] which are the ones i care about the
[1:16:55] person out in the world that doesn't
[1:16:56] like me if there is somebody like that
[1:16:58] or has this idea
[1:16:59] that's false i'm not going to waste my
[1:17:02] time
[1:17:03] especially if they're a critic trying to
[1:17:04] answer it
[1:17:06] the people that i care about the people
[1:17:07] that know me they know how i live
[1:17:09] they'll they know whether that statement
[1:17:11] is accurate or not because of the way
[1:17:12] i've lived
[1:17:14] i believe you can live down a lie you
[1:17:16] can live down these things and so
[1:17:18] so it's a hurt that's how it starts it's
[1:17:20] a seed
[1:17:21] but then the seed needs soil
[1:17:24] and that soil
[1:17:25] is is the heart that will harbor
[1:17:28] the hurt that will nourish that will
[1:17:31] dwell upon it that will
[1:17:32] basically feed it
[1:17:34] and that's kind of what happens so that
[1:17:35] hurt comes and you
[1:17:37] you you begin to take it personal and
[1:17:39] you maybe you don't you don't deal with
[1:17:41] it the way you should
[1:17:43] and rooted out before it has a chance
[1:17:45] but you you dwell on and then something
[1:17:46] else happens and it just keeps it keeps
[1:17:49] growing
[1:17:50] and none of those things individually
[1:17:51] that contribute to the growth of that
[1:17:54] by themselves
[1:17:56] are are worth even the attention that
[1:17:58] you're giving it but it nevertheless has
[1:18:00] that effect and so the root begins to
[1:18:02] form and it begins to grow
[1:18:05] but most of us you know we we we have
[1:18:07] these bitter experience we have
[1:18:08] something somebody hurts us we deal with
[1:18:10] it we move on but some people don't deal
[1:18:13] with it and move on and sometimes it's
[1:18:15] very hard there are things that have
[1:18:17] happened to people in this world that
[1:18:18] when i look at it i think i don't know
[1:18:21] how i would deal with that sometimes and
[1:18:22] i'm going to talk about some of that but
[1:18:24] but still the grace of god is greater
[1:18:27] than anything that you can experience i
[1:18:29] believe that god is able to heal any
[1:18:32] hurt that happens there are people that
[1:18:34] have done some very terrible things
[1:18:36] and we look at them out there in the
[1:18:37] world but they could be people that come
[1:18:40] to the lord and all of a sudden they
[1:18:41] have this baggage in their life
[1:18:43] something happened they were abused or
[1:18:44] whatever all kinds of things
[1:18:46] they have to be able to move on from
[1:18:48] that god is able to free them from that
[1:18:52] now as this root's forming it's as i
[1:18:54] said it's hidden from you but sometimes
[1:18:56] there's some little things that leak out
[1:18:57] in a person's
[1:18:58] personality and their character because
[1:19:01] you know there are these things are
[1:19:03] inside but they do affect you to a
[1:19:05] certain extent even before they spring
[1:19:08] forth
[1:19:09] if i was to ask today if anyone here
[1:19:11] felt they were bitter probably nobody
[1:19:13] would admit it that's one of the things
[1:19:15] one of the problems with it too because
[1:19:16] if you have a root of bitterness
[1:19:19] you know you can't
[1:19:20] even begin to be free of it until you
[1:19:22] acknowledge that it's there god has to
[1:19:24] reveal to you that it's actually a
[1:19:26] problem
[1:19:27] and i've had people i've spoken this
[1:19:29] i've had people come up i couldn't even
[1:19:30] believe
[1:19:31] that had
[1:19:32] roots of bitterness in their lives
[1:19:35] that you know sometimes from years
[1:19:38] and so so you have to know it has to be
[1:19:40] revealed that it's that it's there but
[1:19:42] these little traits you can kind of see
[1:19:45] kind of exaggerated emotions sometimes
[1:19:47] now this doesn't mean that everybody
[1:19:49] that has these traits i mentioned is
[1:19:51] bitter i'm not saying that but though
[1:19:53] people that are bitter
[1:19:54] you'll notice certain things that are
[1:19:56] common for example they can often be
[1:19:58] very sensitive they can be touchy
[1:20:01] easily offended
[1:20:03] people that are bitter now some people
[1:20:04] are they may not be bitter but this is
[1:20:06] certainly a trait sometimes of people
[1:20:08] who are harboring these bitter
[1:20:10] roots
[1:20:12] they're often judgmental critical
[1:20:14] moody and can be withdrawn
[1:20:18] they're not very good at expressing
[1:20:20] gratitude
[1:20:22] when they do express
[1:20:23] things it's either that they're harshly
[1:20:25] critical or vainly flattering but it's
[1:20:28] not really genuine it's it's with that
[1:20:30] criticalness in it
[1:20:32] they're ones that are known to hold
[1:20:34] grudges sometimes for a long time
[1:20:36] they're and they have a very hard time
[1:20:38] to forgive
[1:20:40] it's one of the big things is this
[1:20:42] difficulty to forgive
[1:20:45] the bible says you can't be forgiven
[1:20:46] unless you forgive
[1:20:51] as far as their personality well it can
[1:20:53] vary
[1:20:55] they can be like a porcupine
[1:20:57] they have a lot of good points but
[1:21:00] they're not very nice to be around
[1:21:05] they can be like an iceberg very cold
[1:21:07] solid
[1:21:08] indifferent sour
[1:21:11] or they could be whiny
[1:21:13] over
[1:21:14] with self-pity over every little thing
[1:21:16] and
[1:21:17] clearly exaggerated emotions over things
[1:21:20] that really most people wouldn't even be
[1:21:22] bothered by
[1:21:24] and you know those little
[1:21:26] symptoms leak out but
[1:21:28] when it becomes a problem of course is
[1:21:29] that at some point
[1:21:31] it
[1:21:32] it it springs forth and that's what we
[1:21:33] want to we come we want to come to but
[1:21:37] it in it infiltrates the lives of pretty
[1:21:39] much everyone there's people that are
[1:21:41] bitter in all walks of life it's not
[1:21:43] just
[1:21:44] the poor or uneducated but it's everyone
[1:21:46] that experiences and it's certainly
[1:21:50] christians are not immune or people that
[1:21:51] come to church are certainly not immune
[1:21:53] to getting these bitter roots
[1:21:58] the bible speaks about how that
[1:22:00] is and it's in families a lot too now
[1:22:03] that husbands should love their wives
[1:22:05] there's a scripture that says love your
[1:22:06] wives and be not bitter against them but
[1:22:10] sometimes instead of being the bitter
[1:22:12] half or better half we are the bitter
[1:22:14] half
[1:22:15] we can be
[1:22:17] and so even in churches
[1:22:19] you can have and of course every there's
[1:22:21] nobody here like that i'm sure
[1:22:23] you can have bitter brothers and sour
[1:22:25] sisters
[1:22:27] in the church
[1:22:30] but it's the thing about it is when it's
[1:22:32] when it springs forth and i've seen it
[1:22:34] spring forth it's not pleasant to see
[1:22:38] but if you notice the scripture if you
[1:22:40] if you go back to hebrews
[1:22:42] uh the scripture we read because i said
[1:22:44] we want to take it apart a little bit
[1:22:46] i want you to notice the first symptom
[1:22:50] in hebrews 12 and 15
[1:22:53] where it says lest any root of
[1:22:55] bitterness
[1:22:56] springing up
[1:22:58] trouble
[1:22:59] you
[1:23:01] the first symptom
[1:23:02] the first issue with this root of
[1:23:04] bitterness when it springs up and even
[1:23:06] before it springs up to be quite honest
[1:23:08] it's going to give you trouble
[1:23:11] even though the bitterness that's in
[1:23:13] your heart if you have it often is
[1:23:14] directed to someone else perhaps maybe
[1:23:17] even to god
[1:23:19] and
[1:23:20] but it's your the one that's going to
[1:23:22] suffer for having it
[1:23:24] the very fact that it's there this
[1:23:26] bitterness will trouble
[1:23:28] you it bitterness is like an acid that
[1:23:31] destroys its own container
[1:23:33] it is
[1:23:34] it blows out the candle of joy it
[1:23:36] affects your mood and everything
[1:23:39] but it can also affect you physically
[1:23:42] and i'm going to read a quote of brother
[1:23:43] branham's but before i do that i'm going
[1:23:45] to talk about just some basic medical
[1:23:47] things here it can affect you physically
[1:23:50] something i learned when i looked at
[1:23:51] this well even maybe before
[1:23:54] is is our brains the way our brains are
[1:23:56] made we have a part of our brain
[1:23:58] which is known as the limbic system and
[1:24:00] it's where our emotional center resides
[1:24:03] and
[1:24:04] we know that you know there's parts of
[1:24:06] our brain that control our mobility and
[1:24:09] allow us to move our limbs but what many
[1:24:12] people don't realize and i didn't at one
[1:24:14] time
[1:24:15] is that the emotional center of our
[1:24:16] brain has nerve connections that connect
[1:24:18] to every organ of our body
[1:24:22] which means that your emotional state
[1:24:24] can have an effect on literally almost
[1:24:26] every bodily function that you have
[1:24:31] that means that turmoil in the emotional
[1:24:33] center of the brain can actually cause
[1:24:35] impulses
[1:24:36] to be sent that can result from anything
[1:24:38] from a headache to itching in the bottom
[1:24:40] of your feet
[1:24:41] and sometimes even more severe things it
[1:24:43] does it in three primary ways
[1:24:46] it changes the blood flow to the organs
[1:24:49] your emotional state can change the
[1:24:50] blood photo organs it changes the
[1:24:52] secretion of certain glands and it
[1:24:54] changes the tension of your muscles
[1:24:56] that's how it primarily does it
[1:24:58] one of the most common examples we all
[1:25:00] know of is embarrassment
[1:25:02] when you're embarrassed and there's a
[1:25:03] lady i just hired to be an assistant
[1:25:06] manager and she
[1:25:08] is one of these ones that gets that
[1:25:10] gets red in the face easily and i told
[1:25:12] her i said
[1:25:13] no we've hired you but we haven't talked
[1:25:15] to the other candidate who happened to
[1:25:16] work in the same office so don't tell
[1:25:17] nobody
[1:25:18] and every office has a busy body and so
[1:25:21] her her friend you know wanted to know
[1:25:23] if she got the job because it was a
[1:25:24] little while if you got the job i think
[1:25:26] you got the job and she kept coming in
[1:25:27] and pressing her well after we told her
[1:25:31] she was pressing her some more and she
[1:25:32] said i was trying to avoid it but she
[1:25:34] said i kept getting red in the face
[1:25:36] so she never actually told her anything
[1:25:38] but she basically gave it away and she
[1:25:40] had no control of that but it was
[1:25:41] because of her emotional condition she
[1:25:43] was very happy that she got the job and
[1:25:45] all of that and all of a sudden her face
[1:25:46] is getting red she didn't want it to get
[1:25:48] red she didn't have any control of it
[1:25:51] and so but that was just the emotions at
[1:25:53] work when people are nervous and they
[1:25:55] stand up in front of a crowd and they're
[1:25:58] not ones used to speaking in public
[1:26:01] their mouth will dry get dry they'll
[1:26:04] stop secreting saliva you don't want to
[1:26:05] do that but it happens you almost can't
[1:26:07] speak sometimes and i've had it happen
[1:26:09] you know where you that's why you have
[1:26:11] water sometimes you do get that and you
[1:26:12] just you don't want that to happen but
[1:26:14] it does
[1:26:16] emotional stress can affect the tone of
[1:26:18] your muscles people's muscles will
[1:26:19] tighten up when they're angry or when
[1:26:21] they're frightened
[1:26:22] to produce pain
[1:26:24] it's why people with chronic anxiety
[1:26:26] often suffer severe headaches
[1:26:28] because of the anxiety
[1:26:30] and so
[1:26:31] it's it it's there's an area of medicine
[1:26:34] they call psychosomatic medicine
[1:26:36] cycle of the mind it's home of the body
[1:26:39] and uh so that's kind of where some of
[1:26:41] this comes from
[1:26:42] but
[1:26:43] even back in time in wartime just to
[1:26:45] give you some examples there were men in
[1:26:46] world war ii one time that a bunch of
[1:26:49] them were parachuting over uh
[1:26:52] near germany i believe it was or in a
[1:26:53] particular area and they began to get
[1:26:55] fired at by the germans
[1:26:57] and of course that fear another strong
[1:27:00] emotion
[1:27:02] actually was so powerful that it
[1:27:04] affected
[1:27:05] their intestines which are used to move
[1:27:07] foods through and and without getting
[1:27:09] too graphic about it
[1:27:11] you know some things happen that they
[1:27:12] didn't intend to happen
[1:27:14] again because of that emotion of fear
[1:27:16] when they bombed the english cities in
[1:27:17] world war one i believe it was
[1:27:20] there was
[1:27:21] thousands of civilians after they bombed
[1:27:23] the cities the next day that complained
[1:27:26] of chest pain of heart
[1:27:28] pain
[1:27:29] they didn't have any issues with their
[1:27:30] heart but they complained of it and i
[1:27:31] actually experienced this myself in 2016
[1:27:36] i was building
[1:27:37] the house that i live in now
[1:27:40] i was built in the house working
[1:27:41] full-time preaching every week
[1:27:43] and
[1:27:44] for about a year and a half and then one
[1:27:45] weekend i got a
[1:27:47] break a chance for a break wasn't really
[1:27:49] a break but i was i flew to montreal to
[1:27:51] preach a couple of services
[1:27:53] and for some reason that change of pace
[1:27:56] when i
[1:27:57] and it's first time it happened to me
[1:27:58] i've had it happen a few times since i i
[1:28:01] flew to montreal and the brother picked
[1:28:03] me up at the airport and as we're
[1:28:04] driving the hotel i began to experience
[1:28:06] severe chest pain that radiated through
[1:28:08] my back i got weak
[1:28:10] and clammy and all a lot of the symptoms
[1:28:12] that go with the heart i called my wife
[1:28:14] i i know from my
[1:28:16] history
[1:28:17] i knew i wasn't having a heart attack i
[1:28:19] wasn't concerned about it because i've
[1:28:21] had many
[1:28:22] tests and different things before but i
[1:28:23] still was concerned enough that
[1:28:26] you know i was having a hard time to
[1:28:27] function i was getting sick so called my
[1:28:29] wife and she thought yeah probably
[1:28:30] should get a check she didn't think it
[1:28:31] was either
[1:28:33] but we should you know so i went in
[1:28:35] i was in the hospital for 10 hours they
[1:28:37] ran all kinds of tests on me couldn't
[1:28:39] find anything
[1:28:40] no reason for it
[1:28:42] and i went home did a bunch of other
[1:28:44] tests stress tests all kinds of things
[1:28:46] no issues with my heart whatsoever
[1:28:49] but i have noticed
[1:28:50] in
[1:28:51] the last five years i've had it maybe
[1:28:53] once or twice a year there would be
[1:28:55] certain times certain stressful times
[1:28:57] maybe physical maybe uh mental due to
[1:29:01] things that were going on that would
[1:29:03] trigger these things sometimes i can
[1:29:04] stop them and sometimes it can't they
[1:29:06] last for 20 minutes sometimes half an
[1:29:08] hour i had it happen most recently when
[1:29:10] i was in virginia after preaching for
[1:29:12] brother mike walsh i never told him
[1:29:14] about it uh maybe a day or so we went
[1:29:16] driving to visit brother lloyd went to
[1:29:18] have some lunch and as soon as i stepped
[1:29:20] out of the car i had it and it lasted
[1:29:22] about 20 minutes extremely painful
[1:29:26] somehow it's stress related never been
[1:29:29] able to find anything they thought they
[1:29:30] would check some gastro but it it's been
[1:29:32] very rare very intermittent now i don't
[1:29:35] don't ever take this as as your solution
[1:29:37] if you have this problem you should
[1:29:38] always get things checked out but in my
[1:29:40] case they ran every test they could
[1:29:42] they don't have an answer for it but i
[1:29:44] do believe that so there was a there was
[1:29:47] a british physician in the 18th century
[1:29:49] by the name of john hunter and he was a
[1:29:51] pioneer in in in the in the field of
[1:29:53] surgery
[1:29:55] and he
[1:29:56] had angina an angina is caused by you
[1:29:59] know an inadequate blood supply to the
[1:30:01] heart and he
[1:30:02] he noticed that his angina attacks would
[1:30:04] be triggered by
[1:30:07] because he had a temper when he would
[1:30:08] get angry it would trigger these things
[1:30:10] so he made a statement one time which
[1:30:12] turned out to be quite prophetic for him
[1:30:13] he said the first scoundrel that gets me
[1:30:15] angry is going to kill me
[1:30:17] and so
[1:30:18] it happened to be that sometime after
[1:30:20] that he was in a meeting with a bunch of
[1:30:22] with a board of directors uh it was at
[1:30:24] st george's hospital in london and they
[1:30:26] were meeting and he got in a heated
[1:30:28] argument with some of the board members
[1:30:30] and he and he walked out of the room
[1:30:32] into the next room but when he did he
[1:30:34] felt dead of a heart attack
[1:30:38] so it comes back to this you know
[1:30:40] psycho cement not that not everything
[1:30:42] can be explained away by that but it's
[1:30:44] here's what i want you to read to you
[1:30:46] from the message brother brown said in
[1:30:47] the infallibility of god's spoken word
[1:30:50] 1956
[1:30:52] i'll say this i'll preface it this quote
[1:30:54] with this statement that it is most
[1:30:56] certain that you can be sick and not be
[1:30:58] bitter that's for sure
[1:31:00] but it's just a certain that if you
[1:31:01] harbor a bitter root for a long period
[1:31:03] of time it will
[1:31:05] affect you somehow physically you will
[1:31:07] have an effect from it it will affect
[1:31:08] you it will scripture says trouble you
[1:31:12] brother brown says this
[1:31:13] he said i was telling the boys a while
[1:31:15] ago i said about how we must be happy
[1:31:17] all the time
[1:31:18] god doesn't want you to be sad do you
[1:31:20] know what ill temper does he say that
[1:31:21] old temper is one of the awfulest old
[1:31:24] things
[1:31:26] he said it's about sixty percent of the
[1:31:28] cause of all sickness is temper
[1:31:32] 60 of the cause of all sickness he said
[1:31:34] his temper yes he said them tantrums you
[1:31:35] fly loose which often is how the bitter
[1:31:38] uh root
[1:31:39] it springs forth is usually in some sort
[1:31:41] of an emotional
[1:31:43] he said them tantrums you fly loose he
[1:31:45] said remember you're just developing a
[1:31:47] cancer an ulcer or something like that
[1:31:49] when you do it when you get all stewed
[1:31:51] up about somebody i won't go back there
[1:31:52] anymore wait till i give them a piece of
[1:31:54] my mind he said remember you're the one
[1:31:56] that's going to pay for it
[1:31:58] you're the one that's going to pay for
[1:31:59] it
[1:32:01] but the person that's bitter doesn't
[1:32:02] think that right they think it's it's
[1:32:04] the other person but
[1:32:06] you know i read one time bitterness is
[1:32:07] like drinking poison and then waiting
[1:32:10] for the other person to die
[1:32:12] that's what it's like they don't they
[1:32:14] don't many times they don't even know
[1:32:15] i've heard people that have a critical
[1:32:17] attitude about somebody they just have
[1:32:19] they feel that they've this person's
[1:32:21] done stuff to them and i said well why
[1:32:22] don't you go and straighten it once you
[1:32:23] go talk to them oh no i can't do that
[1:32:26] meanwhile they harbor this resentment
[1:32:28] they harbor this bitterness against them
[1:32:30] and that person doesn't even know
[1:32:32] doesn't even know they have it they're
[1:32:33] not bothered by it but this person's
[1:32:35] frustrated
[1:32:38] there's a there's a doctor a medical
[1:32:39] doctor he's a christian man he wrote a
[1:32:41] book back in the 60s i actually haven't
[1:32:43] his name is dr essai macmillan he he
[1:32:46] wrote a book called none of these
[1:32:48] diseases and
[1:32:50] and and part of this he has a chapter in
[1:32:52] there called the high cost of getting
[1:32:54] even
[1:32:55] and and he talked about how that uh
[1:32:57] physical
[1:32:58] maladies like ulcers and high blood
[1:33:00] pressure kind of like what brother brown
[1:33:01] said in strokes are often connected to
[1:33:03] harboring resentment and hatred toward
[1:33:06] he others
[1:33:07] a link like that and he said it might
[1:33:09] well be written on thousands of death
[1:33:11] certificates that the victim died of
[1:33:13] grudgitis
[1:33:14] that's what he said
[1:33:16] and he made this statement i thought was
[1:33:18] really
[1:33:18] quite interesting he said that the
[1:33:21] moment speaking about this resentment
[1:33:24] and hatred to others he said the moment
[1:33:25] that i start hating a man i become his
[1:33:28] slave
[1:33:29] i become a slave he said i can't enjoy
[1:33:31] my work anymore because he even controls
[1:33:34] my thoughts
[1:33:36] my resentments produce too many stress
[1:33:38] hormones in my body i become fatigued
[1:33:40] after just a few hours of work
[1:33:43] the man i hate may be miles from my
[1:33:45] bedroom but more cruel than any slave
[1:33:47] driver he whips my thoughts into such a
[1:33:50] frenzy that my inner spring mattress
[1:33:52] becomes a rack of torture
[1:33:54] he said i really must acknowledge that i
[1:33:56] am a slave to every man and who might
[1:33:58] pour out my wrath
[1:34:01] but we don't think of that we think the
[1:34:02] other person but you know they never
[1:34:03] they never many of them never know that
[1:34:05] you have this resentment you don't deal
[1:34:07] with it right you're the one that
[1:34:09] suffers it troubles you
[1:34:11] it affects you
[1:34:14] but it doesn't just affect you if you
[1:34:16] don't deal with it you don't fix it
[1:34:18] if you go on in hebrews 12 and 15 and
[1:34:20] read the next part
[1:34:22] hebrews 12 and 15
[1:34:24] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:34:26] trouble you
[1:34:28] and thereby
[1:34:29] many be defiled
[1:34:32] we talk about covet
[1:34:34] being infectious and up home we have
[1:34:36] this norovirus that's really bad as well
[1:34:38] extremely infectious
[1:34:40] well bitterness is one of those
[1:34:42] infectious diseases spiritually
[1:34:45] infectious diseases
[1:34:47] and just as you you know need to get
[1:34:49] inoculated and vaccinated for to not
[1:34:51] catch certain things
[1:34:53] well you've got to be really careful
[1:34:55] when you're dealing with a better person
[1:34:58] because those spirits i've dealt with
[1:34:59] bitter people and and i've set one time
[1:35:01] with a man he he had things against the
[1:35:03] church and the pastor and things and i
[1:35:05] talked to him for for hours and i didn't
[1:35:07] have the issues he had but after
[1:35:09] spending those hours working with him
[1:35:11] and listening to might come out of there
[1:35:12] and it was i i had to do everything not
[1:35:15] to take on a little bit of that there's
[1:35:18] a there's an infectious nature with
[1:35:20] these spirits
[1:35:21] and so that's why the bible says if
[1:35:23] someone's in trouble you know you that
[1:35:25] are
[1:35:26] the weak person is not the one that
[1:35:27] should be helping the person in trouble
[1:35:29] you need to be strong the bible speaks
[1:35:30] about that need to help those that are
[1:35:32] weak because there's a there's an
[1:35:35] infectious nature to these things and
[1:35:37] that bitterness is on that person if you
[1:35:38] don't if you're not careful it can jump
[1:35:40] on you
[1:35:42] criticizing the pastor next time thing
[1:35:44] you know you're criticizing the pastor
[1:35:48] brother mentions this in
[1:35:50] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:35:52] 1963's he said love one another above
[1:35:54] everything
[1:35:56] love one another no matter what the
[1:35:57] devil tries to say he said you're all he
[1:36:00] was preaching you're all one big group
[1:36:02] now sweet group but remember my warning
[1:36:05] satan won't let us stay that way
[1:36:07] and again i come here i don't know any
[1:36:09] situations here you're all one sweet
[1:36:10] that's how i see it
[1:36:12] that's how i always want to approach it
[1:36:14] but the devil doesn't want it to be that
[1:36:16] way
[1:36:17] he said he'll shoot everything if if he
[1:36:19] has to bring somebody in to make his
[1:36:20] target he'll bring some critic in he
[1:36:22] said
[1:36:23] unbeliever and set him down cause him to
[1:36:25] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:36:27] and things so they get in you get used
[1:36:28] to them all there's a good brother good
[1:36:30] sister and then he said he'll shoot that
[1:36:32] guy with some kind of poison stuff
[1:36:35] and then he said he'll start through the
[1:36:37] church with it
[1:36:39] now if you aren't careful it's going to
[1:36:41] be a problem but brother branham said
[1:36:42] don't take sides with it don't have
[1:36:44] nothing to do with anything else you
[1:36:45] stay right loving and sweet and kind to
[1:36:47] one another
[1:36:48] pray for the man that he'll be saved to
[1:36:50] or the woman
[1:36:51] whoever who it is pray for them and
[1:36:53] stick with one another
[1:36:55] and he said stay with your pastor
[1:36:58] because he's a shepherd you give him
[1:37:00] respects he'll lead you through because
[1:37:02] he's ordained of god to do so
[1:37:07] so we always have to be watching
[1:37:10] for the enemy to be trying to slip in
[1:37:12] another message enticing spirits 1955.
[1:37:15] amongst a lot of people he said we find
[1:37:17] where emotions and so forth there
[1:37:19] becomes tattlings and backbitings and
[1:37:21] all kinds of ungodly things brother
[1:37:23] brown said brother that's sulfuric acid
[1:37:26] in the church
[1:37:28] sulfuric acid in the church it's demon
[1:37:31] power spirit of men and women who get
[1:37:33] among one another try to push off and
[1:37:35] say this one's not right that one's not
[1:37:37] right
[1:37:38] and he said you chase it down nine times
[1:37:39] out of ten it's the person making the
[1:37:41] stir that's not right
[1:37:44] god hates discord among the brethren
[1:37:48] we have enough trouble with the devil at
[1:37:50] us
[1:37:51] we don't need to be at each other
[1:37:53] we need one another
[1:37:55] and it's like i said about brother
[1:37:56] rankin's daughter you know if i have a
[1:37:58] need
[1:37:59] i want everyone to pray i don't think
[1:38:01] well that person i don't like that
[1:38:02] person i don't want them to pray for me
[1:38:04] i want everybody to pray
[1:38:06] we shouldn't we shouldn't be looking for
[1:38:08] enemies we have enough of them
[1:38:09] out there
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:14] the way that this kind of root develops
[1:38:18] and comes to the place of springing
[1:38:19] forth i want to
[1:38:21] i want to jump over to a scripture in
[1:38:22] ephesians chapter four because there's a
[1:38:25] progression i said to you that it can
[1:38:26] sometimes go for a long time but there's
[1:38:30] a progression to it
[1:38:34] in ephesians 4
[1:38:36] we're going to read
[1:38:37] verses
[1:38:38] begin at verse 26 and we're going to
[1:38:40] skip a couple
[1:38:41] and read
[1:38:42] verse 26 ephesians 4 26 be angry and sin
[1:38:46] not let not the sun go down upon your
[1:38:48] wrath really good advice the enemy comes
[1:38:51] in tries to hurt and cause should be
[1:38:52] don't let the sun go down upon your
[1:38:55] wrath neither give place to the devil
[1:38:58] so that's something kind of good advice
[1:39:01] to try to even stop that seed from being
[1:39:03] able to germinate
[1:39:05] but for those that it has let us look at
[1:39:08] let us look first at verse 30 and grieve
[1:39:10] not the holy spirit of god whereby ye
[1:39:12] are sealed
[1:39:14] unto the day of redemption it's
[1:39:15] interesting that the scripture that
[1:39:17] follows this one that we quote so often
[1:39:19] grieve not the holy spirit whereby you
[1:39:21] are sealed
[1:39:22] well if it's saying grieve not that
[1:39:24] means it's possible to do it
[1:39:27] without you know going into any detail
[1:39:29] but let's look at verse 31
[1:39:32] i'm going to read it through and then
[1:39:33] we're going to break it down let all
[1:39:35] bitterness
[1:39:36] and wrath and anger and clamor and evil
[1:39:39] speaking
[1:39:41] be put away from you with all malice
[1:39:45] and be kind one to another tender harder
[1:39:47] forgiving one another even as god for
[1:39:48] christ's sake
[1:39:50] hath forgiven you
[1:39:52] i won't dwell a lot on it but if you
[1:39:53] look at this you'll see a progression so
[1:39:55] the bitterness it starts off let all
[1:39:57] bitterness bitterness is that harboring
[1:39:59] of the hurt that you got and you're
[1:40:01] holding it there that bitterness
[1:40:03] but it doesn't stop like that you're
[1:40:04] harboring it there
[1:40:06] and then it begins to come to the next
[1:40:10] point which is wrath and that word is
[1:40:12] derived from a word that refers to to
[1:40:14] heat
[1:40:15] it's like an internal heat like a like a
[1:40:18] smoldering like a slow burn take oily
[1:40:20] rags and and light them and then stick
[1:40:22] them in a confined space like a closet
[1:40:24] where there's not much oxygen and they
[1:40:25] will smolder and they will smolder
[1:40:28] there for a long time and then when you
[1:40:29] open the door of course
[1:40:31] it burst forth so this raft this
[1:40:34] internal heat the smoldering goes on so
[1:40:36] sometimes it can be there and they just
[1:40:37] people are just smoldering inside over
[1:40:39] things and they just hold that there
[1:40:42] and then
[1:40:43] as it begins to manifest it turns to
[1:40:45] anger and angers that outward expression
[1:40:48] of what's going on inside
[1:40:50] that bitterness that's there that
[1:40:52] smoldering it begins to express itself
[1:40:54] through this anger and then clamor which
[1:40:57] is uncontrolled and loud speech most
[1:41:00] people
[1:41:01] when this bitter roots brings forth
[1:41:03] they're not quiet
[1:41:04] they're very loud
[1:41:06] they're very angry and they express it
[1:41:08] in very strong terms and then it turns
[1:41:11] into evil
[1:41:13] speaking
[1:41:15] where people say things that if they
[1:41:18] were stopping and thinking about it even
[1:41:19] after it's all settled they would regret
[1:41:22] it
[1:41:23] saying very very bad things parents
[1:41:25] sometimes do it to their children
[1:41:27] sometimes husbands and wives do it i
[1:41:29] wish i never married you or telling kids
[1:41:30] that they're stupid or you know
[1:41:34] that's bad stuff evil speaking
[1:41:38] be put away from you and then it says
[1:41:40] with all malice malice is the desire to
[1:41:42] hurt or to injure someone and people
[1:41:44] that are bitter when they lash out that
[1:41:46] is their purpose they want to hurt
[1:41:49] wherever they're directing it they want
[1:41:50] to cause some injury
[1:41:53] like a man hitting his wife or child you
[1:41:55] know a disgruntled employee you you know
[1:41:57] of those things but it can be raped down
[1:41:58] into our ranks too where we we're saying
[1:42:01] things evil things with the intent of
[1:42:03] hurting that's what it's for it's not
[1:42:05] for you're not trying to help them it's
[1:42:07] not constructive criticism you're trying
[1:42:09] to hurt that's what this does that's
[1:42:12] what it does the bible says you need to
[1:42:13] put it away from you
[1:42:16] but that's not always an easy thing to
[1:42:18] do
[1:42:21] we'll talk about that but before i do
[1:42:22] that i want to
[1:42:24] i want to talk about a character in the
[1:42:25] bible
[1:42:27] by the name of a hitherfield
[1:42:29] i want to talk about the bitterness of a
[1:42:31] hitherfield
[1:42:33] now you probably know about him he's he
[1:42:35] was david's counselor an absolute
[1:42:37] counselor as well
[1:42:40] and if you go to ii samuel as we try to
[1:42:43] put this together
[1:42:45] ii samuel 16
[1:42:47] and verse 23 he wasn't just like any
[1:42:48] counselor
[1:42:50] he was
[1:42:52] a counselor that had such
[1:42:55] wisdom and such respect
[1:42:57] the people there's a scripture that
[1:42:59] really highlights the the the
[1:43:02] value that was placed upon his council
[1:43:05] in second samuel 16 and 23
[1:43:08] it says in the council of a hitherfield
[1:43:10] which he counseled in those days was as
[1:43:13] as if a man had inquired at the oracle
[1:43:17] of god
[1:43:19] now that's that's pretty powerful so
[1:43:21] that tells me if i'm trying to
[1:43:22] understand a hitherfield because i want
[1:43:24] to understand his bitterness i need to
[1:43:25] understand something about him this is a
[1:43:27] man that's not uh shallow
[1:43:31] i mean people come to him for council
[1:43:33] the king come to him for counsel and it
[1:43:35] says it's as if a man inquired at the
[1:43:37] oracle of god so was all the counsel of
[1:43:39] a hitherfield both with david and it
[1:43:41] wasn't just with david notice and with
[1:43:44] absalom
[1:43:45] he didn't lose his gift
[1:43:47] when he turned on david
[1:43:50] he didn't lose his gift he still had
[1:43:51] that
[1:43:53] but why did he turn on david is what we
[1:43:55] want to dig into what caused a
[1:43:57] hitherfield to turn on david
[1:44:00] in the book of psalms you can read where
[1:44:02] david talks about it's in psalms 41 and
[1:44:04] 9.
[1:44:05] david talks about mine own familiar
[1:44:07] friend he wasn't just a counselor to
[1:44:09] david scholars will tell you that psalms
[1:44:11] 41 and 9 is referring to a hypothetic
[1:44:14] that he was not just a counselor he was
[1:44:16] david's friend
[1:44:18] he said my own familiar friend in whom i
[1:44:20] trusted
[1:44:22] which did eat of my bread hath lifted up
[1:44:24] his heel against me
[1:44:28] well what caused that
[1:44:30] what caused david's friend and a
[1:44:32] counselor of such wisdom and such
[1:44:34] respect to turn away from david
[1:44:38] and conspire with absalom we know
[1:44:41] there's people that are shallow and that
[1:44:42] will go wherever politically makes sense
[1:44:44] you might say well absalom was in charge
[1:44:46] so it made sense for him to do that but
[1:44:48] a hitherfield
[1:44:49] you know from the scriptures would
[1:44:50] suggest that he was a much deeper
[1:44:52] thinker than that
[1:44:53] he wouldn't have just ran
[1:44:55] away because you know my opportunity for
[1:44:58] for growth is better with
[1:45:00] absalom but he definitely we know that
[1:45:03] he conspired with absalom
[1:45:06] against david
[1:45:08] and we know that the lord dealt
[1:45:09] with david and and encountered that uh
[1:45:13] council of a hitherfield
[1:45:16] but what i want you to
[1:45:17] and and when his counsel just for time's
[1:45:20] sake i won't go through that but
[1:45:22] when his counsel was defeated we know
[1:45:23] that
[1:45:24] that he was so discouraged he went out
[1:45:26] and hung himself
[1:45:29] but i want to
[1:45:31] i want us to try to understand what
[1:45:32] happened to hitherfield and what caused
[1:45:35] him to change
[1:45:38] the name of his fell means brother of
[1:45:39] folly or brother of ruin and such was
[1:45:42] his life even though he had all this
[1:45:44] wisdom in this great council
[1:45:46] to understand what happened to a
[1:45:47] hitherfield
[1:45:49] we need to go back nine years
[1:45:51] nine years from when this happened
[1:45:54] back to the time when that seed was
[1:45:57] first planted and the root began to form
[1:46:00] and you can read this in second samuel
[1:46:02] 11-1
[1:46:03] uh well ii samuel 11 we will
[1:46:07] we will just i'm just going to draw your
[1:46:09] attention to the third verse but this is
[1:46:10] the time when david
[1:46:13] saw bathsheba on the roof and he took
[1:46:15] her and you know the whole story how
[1:46:17] that through deceit and and he had
[1:46:20] her husband killed all these things that
[1:46:22] he did terrible things
[1:46:24] and but i want you to notice verse three
[1:46:26] so you can draw see where we're coming
[1:46:28] from with this in verse three davidson
[1:46:30] inquired after the woman and one said is
[1:46:32] this not bashiba the daughter of eliam
[1:46:35] the wife of uriah the hittite
[1:46:38] so eliam was uh
[1:46:41] bashiba's father
[1:46:43] and in second samuel 23 and 34
[1:46:47] i'm just drawing this together
[1:46:49] you'll read
[1:46:50] that eliam was the son of a hitherfield
[1:46:53] the gillian
[1:46:55] which would make a hitherfell her
[1:46:56] grandfather
[1:46:58] now i'm a grandfather
[1:47:00] and if i think about that i think about
[1:47:01] david who had all his wives
[1:47:04] if i imagine
[1:47:06] king coming and taking my granddaughter
[1:47:08] or my daughter
[1:47:10] and doing what he did and causing her
[1:47:11] husband to be killed
[1:47:13] and my human self i wouldn't be very
[1:47:15] happy about that
[1:47:18] and he was he was he there was some
[1:47:20] depth to this man and so he looked at
[1:47:22] that and thinking
[1:47:23] how could david do that with all that he
[1:47:25] had how could he how could he do this
[1:47:27] and it would have seemed like david got
[1:47:28] off with it yes the child you know the
[1:47:30] lord took the child's life that was
[1:47:32] conceived and all that but i'm sure
[1:47:33] hithaphel was looking at that thinking
[1:47:35] that doesn't seem like much you know
[1:47:36] with all that he's got he got off pretty
[1:47:39] easy
[1:47:40] and you might say i don't know if i
[1:47:41] believe that and some scholars might say
[1:47:42] well that might not have been the same
[1:47:44] hithaphel but there's got to be a reason
[1:47:46] why and and to show the vengefulness of
[1:47:48] it we'll go to a scripture in a few
[1:47:50] moments
[1:47:52] but the point of all of this is when
[1:47:54] you're looking at your
[1:47:56] circumstance and the trials that you
[1:47:58] face in the things and the injustices
[1:47:59] that might have been done to you it's
[1:48:01] the same thing the bible tells us that
[1:48:04] that we should not avenge ourselves
[1:48:07] sure david did wrong and he paid for it
[1:48:09] he may not have paid for it the way his
[1:48:11] phil thought he should or even his
[1:48:13] father the bible doesn't speak about
[1:48:14] what his father thought but
[1:48:16] but
[1:48:17] but he did pay for it
[1:48:18] and it and it's not up to us to exact
[1:48:21] vengeance upon those who might hurt us
[1:48:23] it's not our job the bible says
[1:48:24] vengeance is mine i will repay
[1:48:26] saith the lord that's not our it's not
[1:48:28] our job
[1:48:31] now but just to just to kind of
[1:48:33] to make this point
[1:48:35] in second samuel 17
[1:48:40] when he's he's conspiring with absalom
[1:48:43] second samuel 17 1-2 this is the
[1:48:45] scripture that i think kind of helps
[1:48:48] help me when i looked at it to reinforce
[1:48:50] the sinking because if isabelle was just
[1:48:52] conspiring with with absalom and he had
[1:48:54] no real vested interest in it he was
[1:48:56] just there doing his job
[1:48:59] when you look at the scripture it kind
[1:49:01] of doesn't go along with that so when it
[1:49:03] says in in second samuel 17 1 and 2
[1:49:06] moreover hitherville said to absolutely
[1:49:07] let me choose 12 000 men
[1:49:09] i will arise and pursue after david this
[1:49:12] night imagine the counselor going out to
[1:49:14] pursue after david why did he want to
[1:49:16] pursue after david
[1:49:18] why did he do that and notice the second
[1:49:20] verse and he said and i and i will come
[1:49:23] upon him while he is weary and
[1:49:25] weak-handed and will make him afraid
[1:49:29] because isn't that what bitterness you
[1:49:30] want to do you want to make them afraid
[1:49:31] you want to hurt them but watch what he
[1:49:33] says and all the people that are with
[1:49:35] him shall flee and i will smite the king
[1:49:38] only
[1:49:39] i will smite the king only
[1:49:41] why would it why would he do that if it
[1:49:42] was not there was some really serious
[1:49:45] bitterness going on
[1:49:46] in his heart
[1:49:49] that's how powerful that bitterness can
[1:49:51] be
[1:49:52] that's how powerful it was
[1:49:54] for a hisophile
[1:49:59] i want to talk
[1:50:00] about corey
[1:50:02] can boom for a moment
[1:50:04] well no before we do that we'll start to
[1:50:06] address
[1:50:07] the solution to this problem a little
[1:50:08] bit a root bitter root how do we get rid
[1:50:12] of it well
[1:50:13] the types and shadows are good a root
[1:50:16] you really have to get rid of the root
[1:50:18] so i've had you know in my home there
[1:50:21] and planted grass you get these weeds
[1:50:23] that come in and sometimes you go to
[1:50:24] pull them up and you just snap the top
[1:50:25] off and you think oh it's gone
[1:50:28] no it's not gone the root's still there
[1:50:29] come back a little while later and it's
[1:50:31] right back where it was
[1:50:33] to get rid of the root you've got to get
[1:50:34] rid of the root you just can't get rid
[1:50:35] of the fruit of it there's the root and
[1:50:37] the fruit you can't just get rid of the
[1:50:38] symptoms you can't deal just treat the
[1:50:40] symptoms
[1:50:42] you have to get rid of the root itself
[1:50:44] it must be
[1:50:46] uprooted and it takes the grace of god
[1:50:48] to uproot it that's why the bible said
[1:50:51] when it talks in the hebrews there it
[1:50:52] said let us not fail of the grace of god
[1:50:55] you can't get rid of it on your own it's
[1:50:57] the grace of god
[1:51:00] but god is able to take out the root now
[1:51:02] let me i want to talk to you about corey
[1:51:04] ten boom you're familiar with her she's
[1:51:06] the one who wrote the book the hiding
[1:51:07] place but she's the dutch watchmaker
[1:51:10] uh that
[1:51:11] their her and her family they
[1:51:13] they were hiding the jews
[1:51:16] uh in wartime
[1:51:18] and got caught got caught actually by a
[1:51:21] german soldier who impersonated you know
[1:51:23] as if he was someone who needed help and
[1:51:24] they they caught them and then they put
[1:51:26] them into prison and corey and her and
[1:51:28] her sister betsy was put in a woman's
[1:51:31] concentration camp in ravensbruck
[1:51:33] and
[1:51:35] they
[1:51:37] you know they held little worship
[1:51:39] services together she managed to sneak
[1:51:40] in a bible one of the testimonies
[1:51:41] amazing uh what the lord can do
[1:51:44] they searched them when they brought
[1:51:46] them in and they weren't allowed to have
[1:51:47] bibles or anything but she had a bible i
[1:51:48] think pinned to her back or something
[1:51:51] and she said when she come up to the
[1:51:52] line and they were looking
[1:51:54] at people one at a time she said when
[1:51:55] they come to her the guard didn't see
[1:51:57] her he said he literally didn't see her
[1:51:58] and she just walked by so that's how she
[1:52:00] got the bible in and so they
[1:52:02] met together and so on
[1:52:04] well
[1:52:05] her sister died
[1:52:08] there she was weak
[1:52:09] and uh
[1:52:11] frail and over a period of time she just
[1:52:13] got sicker and finally she died and then
[1:52:16] 15 days later she was released but her
[1:52:18] sister was one that
[1:52:20] really exemplified even more than corey
[1:52:22] ten boom did maybe for a while she was
[1:52:24] the positive one among them and a great
[1:52:26] inspiration to her and
[1:52:27] you know she told corey before she she
[1:52:29] died that she said there is no pit so
[1:52:31] deep
[1:52:32] that
[1:52:33] god is not deep or still
[1:52:35] and so
[1:52:37] after her
[1:52:38] her
[1:52:39] sister died corey was released about 15
[1:52:42] days later and then a week after that
[1:52:43] all the women of her age were sent to
[1:52:45] the gas chambers if you're probably
[1:52:47] familiar with that this story that i
[1:52:49] hadn't read before
[1:52:50] was that she
[1:52:52] after the war time she used to go around
[1:52:54] and speak to some of the survivors and
[1:52:56] she actually had a home for survivors of
[1:52:58] the holocaust she went to germany went
[1:52:59] to munich one time and she was speaking
[1:53:01] there
[1:53:02] uh talking about the love of god and how
[1:53:05] they needed to you know be able to move
[1:53:07] on and forgive and so on
[1:53:08] and she was actually in germany giving
[1:53:10] this talk and at the end of it
[1:53:13] there was a and i'm going to read her
[1:53:15] account of it the best i can i always i
[1:53:17] always find this very moving because
[1:53:19] putting myself and what she would have
[1:53:21] gone through and what she had to be
[1:53:23] facing with here and it relates to our
[1:53:26] thought with bitterness i think how
[1:53:27] powerful the love of god is
[1:53:30] she said i i was a church in munich that
[1:53:32] i saw him a balding heavyset man in a
[1:53:35] gray overcoat and a brown felt hat
[1:53:37] clutched between his hands and the
[1:53:39] people were filing out she had finished
[1:53:40] speaking talking to them and
[1:53:43] they were filing out but he was coming
[1:53:44] towards her
[1:53:45] and
[1:53:47] it was in 1947
[1:53:50] and she was had come speaking about the
[1:53:53] forgiveness of god and she said it was a
[1:53:55] truth they needed to hear
[1:53:57] she was talking she said she had this
[1:53:59] mental picture in her mind that was her
[1:54:01] favorite mental picture
[1:54:03] talking about the sea and how
[1:54:06] she said the sea is never far from a
[1:54:07] hollander's mind and she
[1:54:10] liked to think in her mind about how
[1:54:12] our sins were cast into this sea when we
[1:54:15] confess our sins god cast them into the
[1:54:17] deepest ocean they're gone forever
[1:54:20] and so
[1:54:22] as they left this this man begins to
[1:54:24] walk up
[1:54:25] and she said at one moment i saw the
[1:54:27] brown overcoat in the brow or the
[1:54:28] overcoat and the brown hat and then the
[1:54:30] next moment i saw a blue uniform and a
[1:54:33] visor cap with its skull and crossbones
[1:54:36] because this man was
[1:54:38] one of the guards at the
[1:54:40] concentration camp where she was
[1:54:42] so then all of that experience come back
[1:54:45] in a rush
[1:54:46] the huge room she said with his harsh
[1:54:48] overhead lights pathetic pile of dresses
[1:54:50] and shoes in the center the shame of
[1:54:52] walking naked past this man
[1:54:55] he said i could see my sister's frail
[1:54:56] form all of those images were there in
[1:54:59] her mind
[1:55:02] and so
[1:55:03] he comes up to her and he put his hand
[1:55:05] out
[1:55:06] said you know how he was appreciating
[1:55:08] what she said he said it's how good it
[1:55:11] is to know
[1:55:12] uh as you say that our sins are at the
[1:55:14] bottom of the
[1:55:16] sea well she's
[1:55:19] now confronting her own
[1:55:21] she didn't think she know she's trolling
[1:55:22] people how they had to now she was being
[1:55:24] confronted
[1:55:25] never really realized
[1:55:27] there was an issue there
[1:55:29] you put a sand out
[1:55:31] she said now she said an eye who had
[1:55:33] spoken so glibly of forgiveness fumbled
[1:55:34] in my pocketbook rather than take the
[1:55:36] hand
[1:55:39] she said he wouldn't remember me of
[1:55:40] course how could he remember one
[1:55:41] prisoner and he didn't remember
[1:55:44] but she said i remembered him and the
[1:55:45] leather crop swinging from his belt was
[1:55:47] the first time since my release i had
[1:55:49] been face to face with one of my captors
[1:55:51] and she said my blood seemed to freeze
[1:55:53] not hard to understand
[1:55:56] and so he said you mentioned ravensbruck
[1:55:58] in your talk he said i was a guard there
[1:56:00] and you know but he said since that time
[1:56:03] i become a christian i know that god has
[1:56:05] forgiven me for the cruel things i did
[1:56:07] there but i would like to hear it from
[1:56:08] your lips as well and he put his hand
[1:56:10] out again the second time
[1:56:12] will you forgive me
[1:56:15] what would you do what would i would i
[1:56:17] have done
[1:56:19] it seems too simple
[1:56:20] it shouldn't be that easy
[1:56:25] she said this is what she went through i
[1:56:27] want to read in her words she said i
[1:56:28] stood there
[1:56:29] i who sins every day had to be forgiven
[1:56:32] and could not
[1:56:34] betsy had died in that place could he
[1:56:36] erase her slow
[1:56:37] terrible death simply for the asking
[1:56:42] that's what she was dealing with
[1:56:44] she said it couldn't have been many
[1:56:45] seconds he stood there but it seemed
[1:56:47] like hours as i wrestled with the most
[1:56:49] difficult thing i ever had to do
[1:56:52] for i had to do it i knew that
[1:56:55] the message that god forgives has a
[1:56:56] prior condition that we forgive those
[1:56:58] who have injured us
[1:57:01] if you do not forgive men their
[1:57:02] trespasses jesus says neither will your
[1:57:04] father in heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:57:09] she said i knew it not only as a
[1:57:10] commandment of god but as a daily
[1:57:12] experience
[1:57:13] since the end of the war
[1:57:15] she said i had a home in holland for
[1:57:16] victims of nazi brutality and here's her
[1:57:19] own statement as she's reflecting she
[1:57:21] said those were able to forgive their
[1:57:24] former enemies
[1:57:26] were able also to return to the outside
[1:57:28] world and rebuild their lives no matter
[1:57:30] what the physical scars
[1:57:32] those who nursed their bitterness
[1:57:34] remained invalids
[1:57:36] it was as simple and as horrible as that
[1:57:39] that was what she witnessed
[1:57:44] but you know we're called upon
[1:57:46] to do the same
[1:57:47] thing brother branham says before i go
[1:57:49] on with this i want to read a quote in
[1:57:51] the 10 virgins and 144 000.
[1:57:54] brother brown said
[1:57:55] if you have the holy spirit you're part
[1:57:57] of god because you're his
[1:57:59] he sealed you and he's in you working in
[1:58:01] you the signs that he does you do also
[1:58:04] we think about signs i want you to see
[1:58:05] what he says
[1:58:06] now does everybody understand that it
[1:58:08] takes the holy spirit to be gods
[1:58:11] holy spirit if you are of the holy
[1:58:13] spirit you do the works that jesus did
[1:58:15] and then what does he say
[1:58:17] he said when they spit in your face and
[1:58:18] beat you around like that he said there
[1:58:21] was no root
[1:58:23] of bitterness
[1:58:26] when they spit in your face and beat you
[1:58:27] around he said there was no root of
[1:58:29] bitterness
[1:58:31] that's the real test you know i speak a
[1:58:33] thought on about trial of your faith
[1:58:35] brother branham said
[1:58:36] anyone can have faith when the mountains
[1:58:38] are moving but when it turns backwards
[1:58:41] he said that shows if you have real
[1:58:43] faith or not
[1:58:46] oh he said no root of bitterness he
[1:58:48] looked down at them and said father
[1:58:49] forgive them they don't know
[1:58:52] what they're doing
[1:58:54] and jesus counsels us in the
[1:58:56] in the scriptures that when we stand to
[1:58:58] pray when you stand praying he said
[1:59:00] forgive and if you have ought against
[1:59:02] any
[1:59:03] and you're i understand you're gonna
[1:59:05] have communion later it's always
[1:59:06] important we always do this i'm sure he
[1:59:08] does our brother does too but
[1:59:10] if you've got you're gonna take
[1:59:12] communion you need to do a little
[1:59:13] searching is there anything there and of
[1:59:16] course you should do that every day
[1:59:17] anyways
[1:59:18] you know it shouldn't be something you
[1:59:20] have to wait to communion but
[1:59:21] but if you do if you got something there
[1:59:24] if you stand praying forgive if you have
[1:59:26] ought against any your father which is
[1:59:29] in heaven may forgive your trespasses
[1:59:30] but if you do not forgive
[1:59:32] and it's as simple as this in the
[1:59:34] scripture if you do not this is mark 11
[1:59:36] if you do not forgive neither will your
[1:59:37] father which is in heaven forgive your
[1:59:39] trespasses if you can't forgive one
[1:59:41] another you're not going to get
[1:59:44] forgiveness
[1:59:46] it's as simple as that and she knew all
[1:59:47] of these things
[1:59:49] so she says she stood she said i stood
[1:59:50] there with the coldness clutching my
[1:59:52] heart but she said forgiveness is not an
[1:59:54] act of an emotion
[1:59:56] i knew that too forgiveness is an act of
[1:59:58] the will
[2:00:00] and the will can function regardless of
[2:00:02] the temperature of the heart
[2:00:04] so as she's
[2:00:06] getting ready to respond she silently
[2:00:08] prays she said jesus help me i can lift
[2:00:10] my hand i can do that much
[2:00:12] but you supply the feeling
[2:00:16] she didn't have the feeling she had a
[2:00:18] coldness and bitterness in her heart
[2:00:21] but she said i can lift my hand you
[2:00:22] supply so she said woodenly mechanically
[2:00:25] i thrust my hand into the one stretched
[2:00:26] out to me
[2:00:28] and as i did she said an incredible
[2:00:31] thing took place
[2:00:33] this is her words she said the current
[2:00:35] started in my shoulder and raced down to
[2:00:37] my arm and sprang into our joined hands
[2:00:40] and this healing warmth seemed to flood
[2:00:43] my whole being bringing tears to my eyes
[2:00:47] and then she said i forgive you brother
[2:00:49] with all my heart
[2:00:52] and she makes a statement she said for a
[2:00:54] long moment
[2:00:56] we grasped each other's hands the former
[2:00:58] guard and the former prisoner
[2:01:01] and she said i had never known god's
[2:01:03] love so intensely as i did
[2:01:06] then
[2:01:08] that's that's the power of forgiveness
[2:01:13] i was in israel in 2018 and we went to a
[2:01:15] glass art museum just as a part of the
[2:01:17] many things we visited there and
[2:01:19] there was a lady there that was running
[2:01:21] it and touring around we come to this
[2:01:23] memorial of the holocaust and it was
[2:01:25] this sculpture was a really darkly lit
[2:01:27] room and kind of a face
[2:01:29] kind of faces there and blood it was
[2:01:32] just a really really dark image
[2:01:35] and she's speaking about it there and
[2:01:36] she said you know the reason we have
[2:01:38] this here
[2:01:39] is so that we will never forget
[2:01:42] and never forgive
[2:01:44] and i remember we're all standing there
[2:01:46] 24 of us ministers and their wives and
[2:01:49] the different ones and there's like
[2:01:50] literally an audible gasp in the room
[2:01:52] because
[2:01:53] that's not the way a christian is but
[2:01:55] what if you what if you were in their
[2:01:56] shoes
[2:01:58] i just read an incident in ukraine of a
[2:02:00] lady
[2:02:01] who's in a car and there was a
[2:02:04] strike close by and the car got damaged
[2:02:06] and they were trying to get out there
[2:02:07] was a fire and she had
[2:02:08] a young child and a daughter maybe
[2:02:10] around 12 and her daughter got injured
[2:02:13] from some shrapnel she was trying to
[2:02:14] help her and then all of a sudden the
[2:02:15] shell struck close by and literally blew
[2:02:18] her daughter's head off
[2:02:20] and she made a statement she said if i
[2:02:21] had the opportunity to shoot putin she
[2:02:23] said i would do it right now and
[2:02:24] wouldn't hesitate
[2:02:26] but you know what that's not that's not
[2:02:28] what a christian would do
[2:02:30] there's that human side of us that gets
[2:02:32] very angry when we hear about these kind
[2:02:33] of injustices done
[2:02:36] but it's not the right response for us
[2:02:38] it's still god's job to do that if we
[2:02:40] were in the middle of holocaust and all
[2:02:42] these things and we were in ukraine
[2:02:43] right now dealing with some of the stuff
[2:02:45] they're dealing with
[2:02:47] there would be those that human side
[2:02:49] that would be incredibly hard not to
[2:02:51] gravitate to not to hate not to get
[2:02:52] bitter
[2:02:54] and a lot of them are going to have that
[2:02:55] struggle
[2:02:56] when this is over
[2:02:59] but they're only going to hurt
[2:03:00] themselves
[2:03:01] in the end
[2:03:04] we must forgive we have to forgive
[2:03:06] here's what brother branham said about
[2:03:07] the root
[2:03:08] and getting rid of the root
[2:03:12] hebrews chapter 2 and 1957 brother
[2:03:14] branham said after all it is the
[2:03:16] experience of passing from death to life
[2:03:18] when the old things die and all things
[2:03:20] become new christ becomes real old
[2:03:23] things drop away old roots of carnality
[2:03:26] you know how to dig a root out brother
[2:03:27] brown said
[2:03:28] he said we used to take the grubbing
[2:03:30] hole
[2:03:31] and get down at it and dig it until
[2:03:33] there wasn't a speck left
[2:03:35] and that's what has to be done with the
[2:03:37] root of bitterness
[2:03:39] until there's not a speck left and they
[2:03:41] said if there be any root of bitterness
[2:03:44] spring up into you grub her out
[2:03:47] he said that's right that's what the
[2:03:48] holy spirit does
[2:03:50] root out all the roots
[2:03:52] dig them out pile them up and burn them
[2:03:56] get rid of them then he said you'll get
[2:03:58] a good crop then
[2:04:01] you get a good crop then cory ten boom
[2:04:02] said forgiveness is the key that unlocks
[2:04:04] the door of resentment and the handcuffs
[2:04:07] of hatred it is a power that breaks the
[2:04:10] chains of bitterness in the shackles of
[2:04:12] self selfishness
[2:04:16] am i okay for time
[2:04:20] i want to talk about naomi
[2:04:24] in her bitterness let's go to ruth
[2:04:26] chapter one
[2:04:33] ruth chapter one
[2:04:36] beginning at verse 1.
[2:04:43] now this story
[2:04:45] starts off you know what not on a very a
[2:04:47] good note the bible says here in ruth
[2:04:49] one and one it comes to pass in the days
[2:04:51] when the judges ruled that there was a
[2:04:53] famine in the land
[2:04:55] a certain man of bethlehem judah
[2:04:57] went to sojourn in the country of moab
[2:04:59] he and his wife and his two sons
[2:05:01] the name of that man was elimelech
[2:05:03] the name of his wife naomi which means
[2:05:05] my delight
[2:05:07] the name of his two sons maelon
[2:05:09] chilean
[2:05:11] ephrathites
[2:05:13] of bethlehem judah
[2:05:15] came to the country moab continued there
[2:05:16] well
[2:05:18] it goes on to say like naomi's husband
[2:05:20] died she was left and her two sons
[2:05:22] and they took them wives of the women of
[2:05:24] moab the one of the name was orphan one
[2:05:27] was ruth and they were there for about
[2:05:28] ten years and then
[2:05:30] the two sons died in verse five and the
[2:05:32] woman was left over two sons and her
[2:05:34] husband
[2:05:36] well i don't think that was the plan she
[2:05:38] had when they went there i expect they
[2:05:40] plan to go there for a little while and
[2:05:41] come back she loses her husband loses
[2:05:43] her children your children are supposed
[2:05:44] to die
[2:05:45] before you do you know that's the way we
[2:05:47] feel
[2:05:48] and we think about it it's very hard to
[2:05:50] lose a child i haven't experienced it
[2:05:52] but i know many have lost children
[2:05:55] sometimes tragically and it's very
[2:05:56] difficult to move on from it
[2:05:59] and so
[2:06:01] she's feeling this emptiness she's there
[2:06:03] with her daughters in law they're not
[2:06:05] you know they're not israelites or jews
[2:06:08] any you know so she just she's
[2:06:11] discouraged
[2:06:12] all of these experiences that happened
[2:06:13] to her
[2:06:15] not part of the plan and a lot of things
[2:06:17] happen in our lives i can tell you a lot
[2:06:18] of things i've experienced over the
[2:06:20] years i wish i didn't experience
[2:06:23] doesn't have any control over there's a
[2:06:25] lot of things happening in our lives we
[2:06:26] don't have control over but we do have
[2:06:28] control over how we respond to those
[2:06:30] things
[2:06:31] it's up to you whether those things are
[2:06:33] going to destroy you or you're going to
[2:06:34] be made better by them somehow
[2:06:36] i have to believe that everything that
[2:06:38] happens good or bad is god has some
[2:06:40] good purpose for it
[2:06:44] so israel you know the reason they had
[2:06:46] the famine israel had fallen into
[2:06:48] idolatry might not have been her problem
[2:06:49] but that was israel and so israel dealt
[2:06:51] with it has always been dealt with by
[2:06:53] god as a nation so they all suffered
[2:06:57] but they were still the people of god we
[2:06:59] know that
[2:07:00] and he leads
[2:07:02] he led them just as he leads us
[2:07:04] sometimes
[2:07:05] through the still water sometimes as it
[2:07:07] says in the psalms though i walk through
[2:07:08] the valley of the shadow of death you
[2:07:10] know i will feel no evil thou art with
[2:07:11] me
[2:07:12] god is with us whether we're on the
[2:07:14] mountains or whether we are in the
[2:07:15] valley
[2:07:17] eliminate made a choice though he didn't
[2:07:19] have to make that choice he went to moab
[2:07:21] maybe he was a bad choice
[2:07:23] we make bad choices too sometimes
[2:07:25] doesn't mean god rejects us
[2:07:27] we may suffer a little bit more for it
[2:07:28] when we make those wrong choices but
[2:07:30] doesn't mean god's you know writing us
[2:07:33] off there's been many men and women in
[2:07:35] the bible made bad choices
[2:07:37] and god still stuck with them think of
[2:07:39] jonah running away from god different
[2:07:41] ones
[2:07:42] god could have just said jonah you
[2:07:44] didn't even start it's one thing if you
[2:07:45] start and you need some help to finish
[2:07:47] jono didn't even want to start
[2:07:49] you know if it was you or i we just say
[2:07:50] well forget him let's get somebody else
[2:07:52] that's actually willing to do it
[2:07:54] but you know
[2:07:56] we serve a god of second chances and
[2:07:58] third chances and four chances in fact
[2:08:00] he gives us
[2:08:01] probably more chances than we ever
[2:08:03] deserve
[2:08:05] but that's the kind of god we
[2:08:06] serve and so they go and they take
[2:08:08] moabite wives and all of that now i'm
[2:08:10] sure that's not what naomi wanted but it
[2:08:12] happened they take these mob wives all
[2:08:15] of this experience so at the end of
[2:08:17] these 10 years
[2:08:19] you know she's
[2:08:20] she feels empty
[2:08:22] and naomi
[2:08:24] begins to develop a bitter root
[2:08:27] grief you know doesn't have to become
[2:08:29] bitterness but it did for naomi because
[2:08:32] of her response to it
[2:08:34] the way she responded to it and so she
[2:08:36] makes a decision to go back and so we're
[2:08:39] still in the book of ruth we'll just
[2:08:40] pick another verse there in the book of
[2:08:42] ruth and
[2:08:43] the daughters say well you know we want
[2:08:45] to we want to go back with you we'll go
[2:08:46] back with you and notice that her
[2:08:48] response is a reflection of what's going
[2:08:50] on inside in ruth 1 and 13.
[2:08:53] when they say you know we'll come with
[2:08:55] you she said would you tarry for them
[2:08:57] you know speaking of if if they had you
[2:08:59] know other children would you wait until
[2:09:01] they were grown would you stay for them
[2:09:02] from having husbands name my daughters
[2:09:05] for it grieveth me that word grieveth
[2:09:07] comes directly from the word morar which
[2:09:09] means to be bitter
[2:09:11] i'm bitter i'm basically bitter
[2:09:14] it grieveth me much for your sakes that
[2:09:16] the hand of the lord has gone out
[2:09:17] against them so she feels they got a raw
[2:09:19] deal too
[2:09:20] you know when she's feeling bad for them
[2:09:22] she's feeling bad for her she's bitter
[2:09:26] and you know job the great
[2:09:28] man joe perfect
[2:09:30] the one that god allowed to go through
[2:09:32] such a deep trial he he went through
[2:09:33] some of that too
[2:09:35] he says in one place why why is light
[2:09:37] given to him that's in misery and life
[2:09:40] to the bitter and soul
[2:09:41] you know he he he went through those
[2:09:43] load times we go through those low times
[2:09:46] but that's god didn't want
[2:09:48] job to stay that way he had no intention
[2:09:50] for job to stay in that neither did he
[2:09:52] want naomi to stay in that condition
[2:09:55] well we know that ruth stays with naomi
[2:09:57] and they travel back so now if we jump
[2:09:58] down to the 19th verse of chapter one
[2:10:01] they return to bethlehem it says the two
[2:10:03] of them went until they come to
[2:10:04] bethlehem to come to pass when they were
[2:10:06] come it says all the city was moved
[2:10:08] because that family was well known and
[2:10:10] in the city and and they were all
[2:10:12] stirred and they said is this
[2:10:14] naomi remember we said it meant my
[2:10:16] delight that name and she was so
[2:10:19] bitter in her soul
[2:10:20] that she says don't don't call me naomi
[2:10:23] call me mara which means bitter
[2:10:26] i don't even why because the meaning
[2:10:28] didn't reflect the way she felt she said
[2:10:30] now god didn't call her that
[2:10:32] but she called herself that it was it
[2:10:34] was her
[2:10:35] call me mara bitterness for the almighty
[2:10:38] had dealt very bitterly with me watch
[2:10:40] what it was verse 21
[2:10:43] i went out full and the lord has brought
[2:10:45] me again empty
[2:10:48] i wonder how many has had that even in
[2:10:50] your lives and my how many of us have
[2:10:52] started out i know when i started out
[2:10:54] with children and family you know you
[2:10:55] look for certain things to happen then
[2:10:56] all of a sudden here we are fast forward
[2:10:58] 30 years later and
[2:11:00] there's some empty spots there things
[2:11:02] that you didn't plan on i've had things
[2:11:04] that i didn't plan on happen
[2:11:06] and so you feel that way but
[2:11:08] it doesn't have to take you down into
[2:11:10] this pit of despair like it was for
[2:11:12] naomi she said i went out full and the
[2:11:14] lord had brought me home again empty why
[2:11:17] would you call me naomi seem the lord
[2:11:18] had testified against me and the
[2:11:20] almighty has afflicted me
[2:11:22] it's easy it's easy to allow yourself to
[2:11:24] go down that road and feel like
[2:11:28] you know this i guess it's my lot i'm
[2:11:29] not just going to always be this way and
[2:11:31] then just be bitter in spirit and just
[2:11:32] kind of try to survive
[2:11:34] well that's not the way god wants us to
[2:11:36] live
[2:11:38] she lost a lot
[2:11:39] and that was 10 years she lost her
[2:11:41] husband
[2:11:42] her children she lost her security in
[2:11:44] the bible days they relied on the men
[2:11:47] for support for financial not like today
[2:11:49] where everybody's working you know the
[2:11:50] husband wife and the kids and the dog
[2:11:52] are all out working to make things to
[2:11:55] make ends meet
[2:11:57] back in those days you didn't have a man
[2:11:59] someone to support you it was very
[2:12:00] difficult she lost her security her
[2:12:03] possession she lost her status she lost
[2:12:04] her reputation
[2:12:06] more importantly most importantly she
[2:12:08] lost her close relationship she would
[2:12:10] have had with god
[2:12:12] so she was in a very low place
[2:12:15] but you know
[2:12:16] it doesn't matter as i said before where
[2:12:18] the hurt comes from whether it's real or
[2:12:19] imagined
[2:12:21] whether it's from an enemy or a friend
[2:12:23] or in this case god
[2:12:25] it's all about your response god did not
[2:12:28] plant the bitter root in her
[2:12:30] she allowed it to be planted the enemy
[2:12:33] sowed the seed and she allowed it to
[2:12:36] take root
[2:12:38] she allowed it to germinate in that
[2:12:39] heart and nourished it and fed on it by
[2:12:42] dwelling every time i heard come it was
[2:12:43] just that's just a little bit more just
[2:12:45] kept feeding it and she developed this
[2:12:47] bitter root because she couldn't let go
[2:12:50] of the burden in her case it was she
[2:12:51] needed to let go of that bird and not
[2:12:53] carry it i read a story one time about
[2:12:55] two monks that were
[2:12:57] walking and they come to this uh river
[2:13:00] and they saw a woman that wanted to
[2:13:01] cross this river but there was no bridge
[2:13:03] and one of the monks she'd always wanted
[2:13:04] to help and said well we'll we'll help
[2:13:06] you across and so
[2:13:07] he they join their hands the two monks
[2:13:10] and they carry this woman across the
[2:13:11] other side and and she goes on her way
[2:13:13] and thanks them and then they get going
[2:13:15] and walking down the road that these two
[2:13:17] fellas and the
[2:13:18] the second monk the one who didn't
[2:13:19] volunteer said you know i'm
[2:13:21] i'm uh my back is bothering me and i'm
[2:13:24] just i'm having so much pain and all of
[2:13:25] that and i can't go on a diet and he
[2:13:28] returned to the first guy and said well
[2:13:29] aren't you aren't you uh aren't your
[2:13:31] back while they knew he was near
[2:13:32] backward and he said no
[2:13:33] he said the problem with you is you're
[2:13:34] still carrying the woman but i set her
[2:13:36] down a long time ago
[2:13:39] sometimes we bear the weight of these
[2:13:41] losses and these troubles you don't need
[2:13:43] to carry those things
[2:13:45] you don't need to carry them god has his
[2:13:47] own timetable as far as fixing things up
[2:13:49] and he did come around for naomi as well
[2:13:51] and she she got some of that joy back
[2:13:54] but god has his own way in his own time
[2:13:57] whether it be for a loved one that's
[2:13:58] gone
[2:13:59] out to the world and it's just sometimes
[2:14:01] like almost destroys i've seen it i was
[2:14:02] in costa rica and a man his daughter
[2:14:04] kind of didn't want to serve the lord
[2:14:06] and went out and he was he was about
[2:14:07] ready to give up serving the lord
[2:14:08] because his daughter wouldn't serve the
[2:14:10] lord and i said that's that's not the
[2:14:11] right response how do you ever expect to
[2:14:13] get her back if you're going to go out
[2:14:14] and join her
[2:14:15] this is the time you need to stand
[2:14:17] strong as
[2:14:18] you know when the rains break is when
[2:14:19] you need to hold on to the lord not just
[2:14:21] give up
[2:14:23] but sometimes we carry those things
[2:14:26] but god has a time you know he always
[2:14:28] had a time with israel
[2:14:30] and you know until that time arrives we
[2:14:32] don't know what it is for us and our own
[2:14:34] personal lives until it arrives and
[2:14:36] nothing else is going to happen too much
[2:14:38] israel one time you know was told that
[2:14:39] they were going to go down into babylon
[2:14:41] because of their sins again for 70 years
[2:14:44] and you know what
[2:14:46] nothing was going to happen until that
[2:14:47] 70 years went by they could have prayed
[2:14:49] they could have did whatever they wanted
[2:14:50] they had a lot of time now they knew
[2:14:52] what it was
[2:14:53] we just don't know in our case god still
[2:14:55] hasn't allotted time
[2:14:56] for you to go through whatever it is and
[2:14:58] for there to be something come out of
[2:15:00] that
[2:15:01] he knows when it is but when he told
[2:15:03] them about that
[2:15:05] you know he told them that that i will
[2:15:07] perform you know after the 70 years he
[2:15:09] said i will perform my good word to you
[2:15:11] i believe that he has a good word for us
[2:15:13] too
[2:15:14] that he has plans for us you know
[2:15:16] there's a scripture i think has been
[2:15:17] quoted a lot by ministers i know the
[2:15:19] thoughts that i have towards you say the
[2:15:21] lord thoughts of peace and not of evil
[2:15:23] to give you an expected end i believe
[2:15:25] god has those thoughts for every one of
[2:15:26] us if you're a child of god that he has
[2:15:29] he wants you to succeed he doesn't want
[2:15:31] you to fail
[2:15:32] he's not allowing these trials to come
[2:15:34] to destroy you but to build you up to
[2:15:36] strengthen you
[2:15:37] as i said to make you better not to make
[2:15:39] you bitter
[2:15:42] and so god had plans for naomi too well
[2:15:45] it's kind of odd the way it goes
[2:15:47] sometimes we god answers and does things
[2:15:49] in a way that we don't expect or
[2:15:51] anticipate
[2:15:52] in ruth chapter four
[2:15:54] we all know the story of ruth and boaz
[2:15:57] and all of that will finally ruth and
[2:15:58] boys get together and she conceives and
[2:16:01] bear a son but what's really interesting
[2:16:03] is how the bible talks about that
[2:16:07] ruth 4 and verse 14
[2:16:11] because naomi felt she was empty
[2:16:13] watch this and the woman said to naomi
[2:16:15] blessed be the lord which hath not left
[2:16:17] thee naomi this day without a kinsmen
[2:16:21] that his name may be famous in israel
[2:16:24] verse 15 and he shall be a restorer
[2:16:28] of thy life
[2:16:30] and a nourisher
[2:16:32] of thine old age
[2:16:34] she was old by this time but god still
[2:16:36] come back around and answered
[2:16:38] her for thy daughter-in-law which loveth
[2:16:40] he is better to thee than seven sons
[2:16:44] is hath born him
[2:16:46] and naomi took the child and laid it in
[2:16:48] her bosom and became a nurse unto it
[2:16:49] watch verse 17
[2:16:51] and the woman her neighbors gave it a
[2:16:53] name
[2:16:54] saying
[2:16:55] there is a son born to naomi
[2:17:00] she couldn't even have a son but that's
[2:17:02] the way they looked at it
[2:17:04] there was a son born to naomi they
[2:17:05] called his name but he is the father of
[2:17:07] jesse the father david amazing how god
[2:17:09] come around and restored some of that
[2:17:12] loss
[2:17:13] that she had
[2:17:16] what about us what about you
[2:17:18] has anyone here allowed
[2:17:20] such a root bitterness to form from loss
[2:17:23] or from anything else
[2:17:26] god is able to free and i want to close
[2:17:29] with one more
[2:17:31] story i guess you would call it
[2:17:36] maybe the instrument players could come
[2:17:38] as i relate the story and play the song
[2:17:41] just as i am without one plea
[2:17:44] and i want to relate this story
[2:17:46] about a woman by the name of charlotte
[2:17:49] elliot
[2:17:50] she was born in 1789 in england
[2:17:54] she was an embittered woman daughter of
[2:17:57] christian
[2:17:58] parents raised to serve the lord but she
[2:18:00] had a disability
[2:18:02] that caused her weakness and pain
[2:18:06] and like anyone
[2:18:08] with
[2:18:09] an infirmity you desire if you're a
[2:18:11] christian you're praying you're asking
[2:18:12] god
[2:18:14] to heal to deliver
[2:18:17] but it caused her to become bitter
[2:18:19] because god didn't seem to want to heal
[2:18:21] her at least in her mind
[2:18:23] she said if god loved me he would not
[2:18:25] have treated me this way
[2:18:28] so she became very bitter
[2:18:31] and her parents brought a minister
[2:18:34] in may of 1822 she would have been 33
[2:18:36] years old at the time he brought a
[2:18:38] minister to have lunch with him hoping
[2:18:39] maybe he might
[2:18:41] might be able to say some words or do
[2:18:42] something and so they're sitting at the
[2:18:44] table having supper and
[2:18:46] she
[2:18:49] loses her temper
[2:18:51] and begins to rail against god and
[2:18:53] against her family and a real violent
[2:18:55] outburst her parents were so embarrassed
[2:18:57] they they got up and left the room
[2:19:00] leaving her there with the minister
[2:19:02] he just looked at her across the table
[2:19:04] and began to talk to her
[2:19:07] and he said you know you must be tired
[2:19:09] of yourself
[2:19:10] aren't you you're holding on to this
[2:19:12] hate and anger because you have nothing
[2:19:14] else in the world to hold on to
[2:19:17] so you have become sour you become
[2:19:19] bitter and resentful and he began to
[2:19:21] speak to her and she began to respond a
[2:19:23] little bit she said well what is your
[2:19:24] cure
[2:19:26] and he said the very faith that you're
[2:19:28] trying to despise
[2:19:31] he just kept talking to her and
[2:19:33] finally her heart softened a little bit
[2:19:35] and she said well if i wanted to
[2:19:37] become a christian and share the peace
[2:19:39] and joy that you possess what would i do
[2:19:43] he said you would give yourself to god
[2:19:46] just as you are now
[2:19:49] with your fightings and your fears and
[2:19:50] your hates in your life you might be
[2:19:51] here today with struggling with
[2:19:53] something you think well i'm not in you
[2:19:54] know sometimes people come to church and
[2:19:56] have a bad attitude you think well god
[2:19:57] can't do nothing let me tell you god's
[2:19:59] not afraid of your bad attitude
[2:20:03] if you want if you have an inkling of
[2:20:06] of wanting to get help from god
[2:20:09] it doesn't matter what your attitude is
[2:20:11] he's not afraid of it he'll help you
[2:20:14] and so he said come just as you are and
[2:20:18] so she said i would come to god just as
[2:20:20] i am is that right
[2:20:22] and so she did she come to god just as
[2:20:24] she was and her heart was changed that
[2:20:26] day
[2:20:27] and you know sometimes we think and we
[2:20:29] know the prophet said this too that
[2:20:31] sometimes the reason we can't get
[2:20:32] healing is because of unconfessed sin
[2:20:34] and different things like that
[2:20:35] but in charlotte's case
[2:20:37] god did not heal her
[2:20:40] she had the infirmity her entire life
[2:20:42] she dealt with it her entire life but he
[2:20:44] healed her in a more important way
[2:20:47] he could have healed her body but she
[2:20:48] had this bitterness the bitterness was
[2:20:50] the real problem
[2:20:52] he healed her bitterness
[2:20:54] but you know even people with
[2:20:56] infirmities are or various things you
[2:20:58] know we all have a purpose
[2:21:00] we all have something that god wants us
[2:21:02] to do every one of you in this building
[2:21:03] have a purpose
[2:21:05] to serve
[2:21:06] it might not be what somebody else is
[2:21:08] sometimes you're like well i can't
[2:21:09] preach i can't do this no you still have
[2:21:11] a purpose you have a purpose and you
[2:21:13] need to find it it's important to find
[2:21:16] your purpose
[2:21:18] and so
[2:21:20] she couldn't do a lot physically
[2:21:22] but she had a gift of being able to
[2:21:24] write poetry and her brother who was a
[2:21:26] minister
[2:21:28] by the name of henry elliot he was
[2:21:29] raising funds for a school
[2:21:31] for children of poor clergymen and so
[2:21:34] she
[2:21:35] wrote a poem and they sold it printed it
[2:21:38] and they sold it across england to raise
[2:21:40] money
[2:21:41] for this
[2:21:42] uh school
[2:21:44] and that poem
[2:21:45] since has become
[2:21:47] the most famous invitational hymn ever
[2:21:50] written it's one billy graham would use
[2:21:52] a lot it's the one they're playing right
[2:21:54] now just as i am
[2:21:57] it was this woman that wrote that
[2:21:59] because she experienced it
[2:22:00] she came to god in the middle of her
[2:22:02] bitterness and was delivered completely
[2:22:04] from it not getting her healing but
[2:22:06] delivered from the most important thing
[2:22:08] that was hindering her walk with god
[2:22:12] do i want us to sing it today and i
[2:22:14] don't know if there's anyone here
[2:22:16] dealing with
[2:22:17] with any of this if it's resonated with
[2:22:19] anyone
[2:22:21] but if you're here with any kind of
[2:22:22] bitterness in your heart any kind of
[2:22:24] root like that you do not have to leave
[2:22:26] here the way you come
[2:22:29] you might be angry right now you might
[2:22:31] be upset right now it doesn't matter god
[2:22:33] is here to root that out if you want it
[2:22:36] rooted out but you have to be willing
[2:22:38] to admit it's there
[2:22:39] and let god do it but he can
[2:22:42] he can deliver let's sing this song
[2:22:44] together
[2:22:46] just as i am
[2:22:50] just
[2:22:52] as i

[2:37:18] his word

[2:37:29] thank him for the valleys
[2:37:34] i thank him for the storms
[2:37:43] cause if i never had
[2:37:46] a problem
[2:37:48] i would know
[2:37:50] that he could solve them
[2:37:55] i wouldn't know what faith
[2:37:58] in his work
[2:38:00] [Music]
[2:38:00] [Applause]
[2:38:04] through it all
[2:38:10] through it all
[2:38:14] i've learned to trust in jesus
[2:38:19] i've learned to trust
[2:38:22] [Music]
[2:38:32] oh
[2:38:41] [Music]
[2:38:44] i can just make another statement i
[2:38:46] don't i'm sorry i kept you so long but
[2:38:49] a lot of times the things that causes
[2:38:51] bitterness and just from the folks that
[2:38:52] are up here is the things that we
[2:38:54] sometimes we deal with in in our
[2:38:57] families in our lives things that we
[2:38:59] we can't fix and and our brother might
[2:39:01] remember when we spoke about worry at
[2:39:04] the youth camp i told him i said there's
[2:39:05] two things you should never worry about
[2:39:08] and that is things that you can change
[2:39:10] things that you can't change
[2:39:12] which is basically everything
[2:39:13] and so those things that you're dealing
[2:39:15] with some of these with families that
[2:39:17] are just not doing what they're supposed
[2:39:18] to do
[2:39:20] you've got to cast that burden upon the
[2:39:22] lord
[2:39:23] he said cast your burdens on and he
[2:39:25] he'll carry them
[2:39:27] you can't carry those you can't take
[2:39:28] those you can't fix those things but but
[2:39:30] the bible says the heart of the king is
[2:39:31] in the hand of the lord and he can turn
[2:39:33] it however he wants to
[2:39:36] and so if it's something you have
[2:39:38] control of sometimes there's things we
[2:39:39] do need to do we got to go here we got
[2:39:41] to talk to this one but then there's
[2:39:42] sometimes it's out of your hands all
[2:39:44] together
[2:39:44] and when it is you need to get your
[2:39:46] hands off it because you just cause more
[2:39:48] trouble
[2:39:50] for them and for you
[2:39:52] so if i can encourage you to try it's
[2:39:54] hard i deal with the same thing
[2:39:56] sometimes you you want to fix it
[2:39:58] especially as brothers we're fixers you
[2:39:59] know we got a problem we got to fix it
[2:40:02] sometimes there's problems we can't fix
[2:40:05] but we serve a god who can fix them
[2:40:07] and we can't be worrying about them we
[2:40:08] can't be bitter about them it's hard you
[2:40:10] see people doing things you think you
[2:40:12] shake their head why are they doing that
[2:40:13] but
[2:40:14] you can only do your part you can sow
[2:40:16] some seeds and a word here and a word
[2:40:18] there but then after you've done your
[2:40:20] part let god
[2:40:22] do his part
[2:40:23] amen god bless you i really appreciate
[2:40:25] it being here amen
[2:40:28] i'll pray for her sister
[2:40:34] [Music]
[2:40:42] when i
[2:40:43] look into your home

[2:58:37] amen
[2:58:38] i tell you
[2:58:39] well there's a
[2:58:41] lot you could be sad i think i have
[2:58:43] i don't know how many pages of notes
[2:58:46] that are there
[2:58:48] you know no matter how many times
[2:58:51] i've even had situations where people
[2:58:53] had logged onto the
[2:58:56] internet here from services years ago
[2:59:00] and would write me
[2:59:02] different ones
[2:59:04] and some of the things that i dealt with
[2:59:06] in family services
[2:59:08] they would write
[2:59:09] and you sometimes we look at the needs
[2:59:12] and we all have needs in our life
[2:59:15] and begin to think about these things
[2:59:18] because you know medical science some of
[2:59:20] the things that brother
[2:59:22] carmen was referring to
[2:59:24] medical science
[2:59:26] is finding out things
[2:59:29] but that god through his prophet there
[2:59:31] is a litany of quotes
[2:59:33] that i've read to you and this is from
[2:59:34] back in
[2:59:35] 16 17 years ago when i taught on some of
[2:59:38] those things in the beginning
[2:59:42] yet you know what
[2:59:43] it's always gotta it's always continual
[2:59:45] practice
[2:59:47] you know one of the first things they'll
[2:59:48] do to a cancer patient some of you
[2:59:50] remember this when we just took some
[2:59:52] services on forgiveness
[2:59:55] before they give that treatment to that
[2:59:57] cancer patient
[2:59:59] they first of all
[3:00:01] i know maybe some people have had it and
[3:00:03] they haven't experienced this but what
[3:00:04] they have found
[3:00:06] is that if that person has a grudge in
[3:00:10] their life at all
[3:00:12] it will do no good to take that medicine
[3:00:17] now this is what medical sciences found
[3:00:19] out
[3:00:21] now
[3:00:21] think of
[3:00:22] this the token
[3:00:25] the life of the word
[3:00:27] the prophet called it the medicine
[3:00:30] and that word is continually we want the
[3:00:33] word and we want the word to be
[3:00:34] effective in our life and the times
[3:00:36] where we're looking at it and it's not
[3:00:38] just bitterness but sometimes there's
[3:00:40] other things and this is why we need the
[3:00:42] word of god
[3:00:44] where it comes down where the rubber
[3:00:46] meets the road
[3:00:48] because
[3:00:49] god has ordained you and i just as much
[3:00:52] as
[3:00:53] this this this little clock up here that
[3:00:56] sometimes i overlook
[3:00:58] it's meant to tell time
[3:01:01] but you know what if there's something
[3:01:02] wrong with it
[3:01:03] if the battery's bad in it i don't care
[3:01:05] what it's intended to do
[3:01:07] if it doesn't have the battery or if
[3:01:09] there's something out of line in it it
[3:01:11] cannot do
[3:01:12] what it's intended to do
[3:01:14] and that's how it is with our lives
[3:01:17] we are ordained to be channels that god
[3:01:20] would come and fulfill his word through
[3:01:22] and to think to me this is how i look at
[3:01:25] it the love of god that god comes down
[3:01:28] not just in a service
[3:01:30] like this
[3:01:31] but in a service like this and then
[3:01:34] through services and then in our
[3:01:36] everyday life to come to that place
[3:01:38] because seeds are going to come
[3:01:41] they're going to come the bible says
[3:01:43] offenses
[3:01:44] will come
[3:01:45] [Music]
[3:01:47] and i always thought it was very good i
[3:01:48] heard
[3:01:49] you know i've used it
[3:01:51] but one of the first times i heard it
[3:01:52] put this way brother wayne used it in
[3:01:54] this sense out of spoke out of spiritual
[3:01:56] food and diseases brother braham says we
[3:01:58] need to be accumulating the faith the
[3:02:00] things that god is doing in this hour
[3:02:02] let it be accumulated in our life
[3:02:04] but i like how the contrast is too if we
[3:02:06] can accumulate faith in all the
[3:02:07] experiences what god's doing what he's
[3:02:09] revealing what he's doing in our life
[3:02:10] then it also shows there it can be an
[3:02:12] accumulation of hurts
[3:02:15] offenses
[3:02:16] that just get built up over time
[3:02:19] but i'm glad
[3:02:20] that we got a god
[3:02:23] who's not too big
[3:02:25] that he'll come down and say
[3:02:26] that's my daughter
[3:02:28] that's my son
[3:02:30] they were not ordained for that and i
[3:02:33] come
[3:02:34] to lusa
[3:02:37] i'm so glad about that
[3:02:39] it makes me so proud of my god
[3:02:42] how loving how kind that he is i've seen
[3:02:44] him change lives i know what it is for a
[3:02:46] soul for a life to be changed i've had
[3:02:49] that experience but how wonderful it is
[3:02:51] that after we've experienced that that
[3:02:53] he'll come to us
[3:02:55] when we don't deserve it and he'll let
[3:02:58] us know
[3:02:59] my son my daughter this is a hindrance
[3:03:05] let's
[3:03:06] deal with this
[3:03:12] i love that scripture in the song of
[3:03:14] solomon i'm going to let you go
[3:03:16] but i want you to notice what solomon
[3:03:18] would say
[3:03:20] take
[3:03:21] us
[3:03:22] the foxes
[3:03:24] not you us
[3:03:27] what i see the father doing that i do
[3:03:30] likewise
[3:03:31] the father worketh and i worketh
[3:03:32] hitherto take us
[3:03:35] the little foxes
[3:03:38] that destroy the vine i'm glad
[3:03:40] i'm glad that he is an ever-present god
[3:03:44] i'm glad that he's not ashamed to come
[3:03:46] down and take my hand
[3:03:49] i'm glad
[3:03:51] that he's
[3:03:52] ashamed
[3:03:53] to not
[3:03:54] and take our hands
[3:03:56] oh god don't ever let me be ashamed
[3:04:00] let me stand and say you're right lord
[3:04:02] let me stand and confess it and say
[3:04:04] that's true lord
[3:04:06] not just in a service but you realize
[3:04:08] how the word of god comes to us even in
[3:04:11] this hour that there are things that you
[3:04:13] and i can have responses to
[3:04:16] this has happened to me
[3:04:19] but then after i'm removed from it a
[3:04:21] little bit you might have your
[3:04:22] frustration and you get along with god
[3:04:24] and you begin to realize wait a minute
[3:04:28] your approach is wrong
[3:04:31] your attitude is wrong
[3:04:32] i'm talking about me now
[3:04:36] god begins to deal and you begin to
[3:04:38] realize wait a minute
[3:04:40] this is you
[3:04:41] this is me
[3:04:43] me trying to deal with it
[3:04:47] i'm glad he comes that way he said
[3:04:50] brother samuel what does that happen
[3:04:51] well sometimes i just have teary eyes
[3:04:53] and i keep things right there i can pull
[3:04:55] up in the truck or in the car and i can
[3:04:58] wipe my eyes and say god
[3:05:00] forgive me lord for getting in the way
[3:05:05] help me lord to get out of the way
[3:05:07] [Music]
[3:05:08] i'm so glad
[3:05:10] i'm so glad i'll tell you
[3:05:13] what a communion service
[3:05:16] communions later today but
[3:05:19] [Music]
[3:05:21] what a service
[3:05:23] because what we are coming here in a few
[3:05:25] hours to do
[3:05:27] this is really not communion communion
[3:05:29] is our daily walk with god
[3:05:34] brother branham tells us he said you can
[3:05:36] have communion with someone as long as
[3:05:38] there's no edge
[3:05:40] there between you
[3:05:42] you get that edge out of the way
[3:05:44] whatever it is then you can
[3:05:47] it's free
[3:05:48] i'm glad aren't you glad
[3:05:52] i'm glad
[3:05:53] just so many things i know god has spoke
[3:05:56] to our hearts this morning
[3:05:59] my cup is full
[3:06:02] but my cup is not just full
[3:06:04] my heart is healed
[3:06:07] my life is touched
[3:06:10] you see i don't just look at a service
[3:06:12] like this and say oh god my congregation
[3:06:15] oh god my congregation
[3:06:17] i want this word to search my life
[3:06:20] that's how i when i listen to the
[3:06:22] message of the hour
