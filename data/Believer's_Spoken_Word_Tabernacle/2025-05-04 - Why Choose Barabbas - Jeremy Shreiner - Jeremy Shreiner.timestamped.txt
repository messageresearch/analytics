[24:46] or
[24:49] two. Every bridge is crossed and burned.
[24:53] But through all the wreckage I have
[24:56] learned, there is one thing that I can
[25:01] never lose.
[25:05] If I got
[25:08] Jesus, I've got all that I could ever
[25:13] need. Take this world away from me and
[25:18] I'll be
[25:19] okay. If I got
[25:24] Jesus, there's a hope that's there deep
[25:28] inside. A joy that I can never hide.
[25:33] safe place to fall. If I got
[25:38] Jesus, I've got it
[25:42] all. I've seen wings turn to strength.
[25:47] I've seen failures met with grace. And
[25:51] it's not from what I've done. It's
[25:55] Christ in me.
[25:59] A miracle I can't explain. Oh, he's g me
[26:04] his name. I'm the rightest man that I
[26:10] can ever
[26:13] be. I got Jesus.
[26:18] I've got all that I can ever need. Take
[26:23] this world away from me and I'll be
[26:28] okay. I got
[26:32] Jesus. There's a
[26:34] hopeless deep
[26:37] inside that I can never hide. The safe
[26:42] place to fall is my
[26:47] Jesus. I got it
[26:52] all. Someday that trump is going to
[26:59] stand and the king of
[27:04] will come.
[27:08] If I need the light and see my
[27:13] soul, I'm going
[27:17] home. I got
[27:19] [Music]
[27:21] Jesus. I got all that I could ever be.
[27:26] Take this world away from me and I'll be
[27:31] okay.

[35:34] We have a little meme that we turn
[35:36] around and we, you know, send around.
[35:39] And of course, I don't like to joke
[35:41] around too much, but we'll send around a
[35:43] meme and it's kind of like the has a
[35:46] bunch of birds that look to the back of
[35:48] the church when there's sound
[35:50] problems. So, but I sir appreciate
[35:53] everything they do to make it make it
[35:55] run smooth. And um we're so glad to be
[35:59] gathered tonight in the presence of the
[36:01] Lord. And uh I just believe the Lord has
[36:04] something for us once again. And um so
[36:08] we just want to we want to pull on the
[36:10] gift of God. And we've set aside this
[36:13] this service here tonight. and you know
[36:15] for with young people but I have been a
[36:18] witness myself how God has come through
[36:21] many services that have been with young
[36:23] people in mind and God speaks right to
[36:26] my heart and that's what I've always
[36:29] found no matter where we're at God he's
[36:31] able to speak to us because it's not
[36:33] about big great deep things it's about
[36:36] seeing him and if we can see him in this
[36:39] service and hear his voice and our
[36:42] hearts be open that's That's what it's
[36:44] all about. Amen. And he as he speaks to
[36:47] your heart, just say, "Come, Lord Jesus.
[36:50] Just have your way." Amen. I think what
[36:52] a what a privilege it is. Amen. For the
[36:55] for the Lord just to come among us in a
[36:58] in a time like this. Amen. I believe he
[37:01] wants to do some things for us here
[37:03] tonight. Don't you? Amen. And so, we're
[37:05] glad to have brother Jeremy here with
[37:07] us. And um we just want to pull on the
[37:09] gift of God tonight as our brother would
[37:12] come. Let's sing that song. I pledge
[37:15] allegiance to the
[37:17] lamb. I thought about the song. I really
[37:20] appreciate the specials and I was
[37:22] thinking about when sister Aacia was
[37:24] singing and I thought about brother Ram
[37:27] tells that story about Sarah and Becky
[37:29] on his lap and you know Becky was able
[37:32] to get there ahead of time and she
[37:35] said she said I I got daddy. And little
[37:38] s little little Sarah's lips was
[37:40] quivering. And brother Bram reached out
[37:41] and he said, "Come on over here." And he
[37:43] picked up Sarah and he pulled her close
[37:46] and she said, "Listen,
[37:48] You might have all of daddy, but
[37:51] daddy's got all of
[37:53] me." And that's what we want tonight. It
[37:56] It's precious to have the Lord in our
[37:58] life, but Lord, I want you to have every
[38:00] part of my life. I want you to have
[38:02] every bit of me, Lord. Amen.
[38:06] Oh, I
[38:08] pledge
[38:11] alance
[38:12] to the
[38:14] lamb with all my
[38:19] strength with all I am. And I will sing
[38:26] to
[38:28] honor
[38:30] [Music]
[38:34] his
[38:36] legions
[38:40] to the
[38:43] lamb. Oh, I
[38:46] pledge
[38:49] alent
[38:50] to the lamb.
[38:54] With all my
[38:57] strength, with all I am, I will
[39:03] sing to
[39:07] all my
[39:10] [Music]
[39:28] So thankful for your
[39:29] [Music]
[39:49] Father with you, God. We just ask that
[39:52] you would just do this for us tonight,
[39:54] Lord. That you would just bless us,
[39:55] Father. God, that the word would not, we
[39:58] know it won't return void, but Lord, let
[40:00] all of our hearts and minds be centered
[40:02] upon you this evening, Lord. We thank
[40:05] you. And we want to surrender ourselves
[40:06] to you now. And when we leave this
[40:09] place, whether it be a young person,
[40:12] Father, or the oldest alike, it doesn't
[40:14] matter. May our hearts be closer to you
[40:17] by your word. In thy precious, holy name
[40:20] we ask it. Saint says, "Amen." Amen. You
[40:24] love him tonight. Amen. I believe you
[40:27] do. Amen. And just so good to be back in
[40:30] the house of the Lord this evening.
[40:32] Amen. And I'm going to go different
[40:34] because I'm going to save it till the
[40:36] end. I want to dive into this and then
[40:38] we'll we'll have ourselves a youth
[40:40] singing after the after we get through
[40:42] this if if if we haven't been thrown out
[40:44] by then yet. So, um so we're just glad
[40:48] to be here. Man, I've enjoyed the
[40:50] worship. Amen. And the specials. Uh what
[40:53] a what a testimony to see young people
[40:56] come together and worship the Lord.
[40:58] Amen. I I think I have this set up here,
[41:01] brother.
[41:01] I hope I got this all ready to play.
[41:05] There we go. It's working. Uh tonight,
[41:07] um for the ministers that understand
[41:10] this as well, we're going to turn to
[41:12] Matthew chapter 21 first. Uh this
[41:15] morning, I was kind of going in a
[41:16] different direction for tonight. And I'd
[41:18] say 30 minutes or 45 minutes before we
[41:21] left the hotel, the Lord began to direct
[41:24] us this direction, which included slides
[41:27] again. I'm like, why? And uh this is all
[41:32] still new to me. So uh but we pray
[41:34] tonight that it'll be an encouragement
[41:36] to you. There there's going to be words
[41:39] in this tonight that maybe some of you
[41:41] young ones won't understand, but I don't
[41:43] understand them all either. But I I felt
[41:46] led to leave some of these words as we
[41:48] get through this and we're dealing with
[41:49] some situations to try to bring forth
[41:52] the natural and the spiritual side to
[41:54] this. and pray by the end of it uh the
[41:56] Lord will uh have painted a wonderful
[41:59] picture for you. Verse
[42:02] six says, "And the disciples went and
[42:04] did as Jesus commanded them and brought
[42:07] the ass and the colt and put them and
[42:10] put on them their clothes, and they set
[42:13] him thereon. And the very great
[42:15] multitudes spread their garments in the
[42:17] way. Others cut down branches from the
[42:20] trees and straw them in the way. And the
[42:22] multitudes that went before and that
[42:25] followed cried, saying, "Hosana to the
[42:28] son of David. Blessed is he that cometh
[42:31] in the name of the Lord. Hosana in the
[42:34] highest." And when he was come into
[42:36] Jerusalem, all the city was moved.
[42:38] Notice that all the city was moved
[42:41] because of this great cry, saying, "Who
[42:44] is this?" And the multitude said, "This
[42:47] is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of
[42:51] Galilee." Uh, you can have your seats.
[42:53] And while you're doing that, I'd like
[42:54] you to turn to Matthew chapter
[42:56] 27 because now we're going to go to a
[42:59] different uh a different situation. Now,
[43:04] we've just come through Easter and uh
[43:06] you know, all the the religious world
[43:09] went through all of the emotions of it
[43:11] all and perhaps doing what they know
[43:13] upon their heart. Even us in our own
[43:16] churches in a sense perhaps have done
[43:18] the same thing. But we're going to be
[43:20] asking a question as you can see already
[43:22] up there is why choose Barabus? So now
[43:26] let's go to verse uh 15 of Matthew 27.
[43:29] It says now at the feast the governor
[43:32] was want to release unto the people a
[43:34] prisoner whom they would and they had
[43:38] then a notable prisoner called Barabus.
[43:42] Therefore, when they were gathered
[43:44] together, Pilate said unto them, Whom
[43:46] will ye that I release unto you,
[43:49] Barabbus or Jesus, which is called
[43:52] Christ? For he knew that for envy they
[43:56] had delivered him. And when he was set
[43:58] down on the judgment seat, his wife sent
[44:00] unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to
[44:03] do with this just man, for I have
[44:05] suffered many things this day in a dream
[44:07] because of him. But the uh chief priests
[44:10] and elders persuaded the multitude
[44:15] persuaded the multitude that they should
[44:18] ask Barabus and destroy Jesus. The
[44:22] governor answered and said unto them,
[44:23] "Whether of of the twain will ye that I
[44:26] release unto you?" And they said,
[44:28] Barabbus. Why were they saying this? We
[44:31] really want to come again down to the
[44:33] the the heart of the matter here. Pilate
[44:35] saith unto them, "What shall I do then
[44:37] with Jesus which is called Christ?" They
[44:41] all say unto him, "Let him be
[44:44] crucified." How did we go from hosana
[44:50] to crucifixion?
[44:52] These are things that we really want to
[44:53] ponder because of how quick the
[44:55] turnaround was. And the governor said,
[44:58] "Why? What evil hath he done?" But they
[45:01] cried out the more saying, "Let him be
[45:04] crucified." So they weren't satisfied.
[45:06] Let him be crucified. And when Pilate
[45:09] saw that he could prevail nothing, but
[45:11] that rather a tumult was made, he took
[45:14] water and washed his hands before the
[45:16] multitude, saying, "I am innocent of the
[45:19] blood of this just person. See ye to
[45:22] it." And last two verses. Then answered
[45:25] all the people and said, "His blood be
[45:27] on us and on our children.
[45:32] God help us."
[45:34] Then released he Barabus unto them. And
[45:37] when he had scorged Jesus, he delivered
[45:39] him to be
[45:41] crucified. So as we take this thought
[45:43] for a minute, let's go back to the
[45:46] beginning, the entrance of Christ.
[45:49] And because I believe this is very
[45:51] important to to really lay this out and
[45:54] we go back to this verse
[45:56] 8 and God help us to understand by the
[46:00] end. And a very great multitude spread
[46:02] their garment in the way. We just read
[46:04] this but I want to just bring this out
[46:05] and that's why I put it on the slide.
[46:07] Others cut down branches from the trees
[46:10] and straw them in the way. And the
[46:12] multitudes that went before that
[46:13] followed cried saying hosana to the son
[46:17] of David. Blessed is he that cometh in
[46:19] the name of the Lord. Hosana in the
[46:22] highest. So as we as we take a look at
[46:25] this now today, you and I when we sing
[46:27] hosana or we sing hosana, blessed be the
[46:29] rock or we are worshiping God, right? It
[46:32] it's a form of worship. But if we go
[46:34] back uh to to this day, the crowd crying
[46:38] hosana is more than just mere worship.
[46:41] There's actually a meaning to this. You
[46:44] will actually find this in Psalms 118:24
[46:47] where it says, "This is the day which
[46:49] the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and
[46:52] be glad in it. Save now, I beseech thee,
[46:56] oh Lord. Oh Lord, I beseech thee, send
[46:59] now prosperity." So what this is is this
[47:02] is actually a direct connection to the
[47:04] word hosana. And again, some of these
[47:06] words I don't fully understand. Perhaps
[47:08] you could say it better. But let's look
[47:09] at this. The term hosana originates from
[47:12] the Hebrew phrase as it shows there
[47:15] hosana meaning save we pray or save now
[47:18] as appears in Psalms
[47:20] 118:25 part of the hell prayers recited
[47:24] during Jewish festivals uh like Passover
[47:26] or sukot when the crowds shouted hosana
[47:30] during Jesus's entry into Jerusalem the
[47:33] Greek text reflects the Hebrews term of
[47:37] the dual significance here so as we're
[47:39] looking at This this was literally when
[47:42] they're crying hosana. This was a
[47:44] literal plea of a call for divine
[47:47] rescue. This was not just an aspect of
[47:51] hey here he comes. Let's worship him.
[47:53] Let's give him ad adoration. But
[47:55] actually this is them crying out you
[47:58] have come to save us. Hosana save us.
[48:02] Save us. the the messianic praise by the
[48:05] time of Jesus it had become an
[48:07] exclamation of joy and reverence for the
[48:11] anticipated Messiah. So by this time
[48:14] they were looking for someone to come
[48:18] and to save them to take them out from
[48:20] their problems to get them from that
[48:22] rulership of the Romans. So thus in the
[48:25] Greek context of the gospels, hosana
[48:28] functions as a bridge between Hebrew
[48:31] tradition and Christian worship,
[48:33] embodying both a cry for deliverance and
[48:36] celebratory acclaim for Jesus as their
[48:40] savior. So if we can just say this
[48:43] carefully, there was a
[48:45] misunderstood coming. They misunderstood
[48:48] it. Notice what the prophet says here.
[48:50] He says, "Now Jesus had come." Now, I
[48:52] only have a portion of this quote here
[48:53] and I'm going to go through a little bit
[48:54] more. Jesus had come and he had proved
[48:57] to the people by every means. How many
[48:59] can say that Jesus proved the
[49:01] scriptures? So, there was nothing out of
[49:03] it, right? He fulfilled everything that
[49:05] the scripture said. I want you to
[49:06] understand where the hour that you're
[49:08] living in, scripture is being fulfilled.
[49:11] This is not just us trying to to force
[49:13] the scripture, but this the word of God
[49:16] is being fulfilled. Now many of them had
[49:18] drawn the wrong conception of his coming
[49:22] and that's the reason he was
[49:24] misunderstood. He says pardon the
[49:26] expression but that's the reason tonight
[49:29] he's misunderstood. They draw the wrong
[49:32] conception of what he is. Says now I
[49:35] believe while I was standing there I
[49:37] heard my associate here read the
[49:39] scripture of saying and the campaign
[49:41] themes are always Jesus Christ the same
[49:44] yesterday today and forever. And he
[49:46] quoted it in Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ
[49:48] is the same yesterday, today, and
[49:50] forever. Now when he come they when he
[49:53] came they the great group of Israel was
[49:56] certainly eyes open wide looking for a
[50:01] messiah.
[50:03] So they were actually looking for a
[50:04] Messiah.
[50:06] I want you to understand that they they
[50:08] were looking for it but they were
[50:10] looking for him in the way they had been
[50:13] taught.
[50:15] that he would come.
[50:17] He says, "Well, now any good spiritual
[50:19] thinking or even intellectual thinking
[50:22] person would know that he did not come
[50:24] contrary to the scriptures. He'd come
[50:27] contrary to the
[50:29] understanding of their scriptures, not
[50:32] contrary to the scriptures." But they
[50:35] had been taught by their teachers in
[50:37] such a way that the teachers had the
[50:39] wrong conception of him. Listen, the
[50:42] further we get away or the further we
[50:44] get closer, the closer we get to a
[50:46] rapture, you begin to see this. We need
[50:49] to be careful with what we're listening
[50:51] to and what we're putting our ears to in
[50:54] our conception of it.
[50:58] Right? So, but they had been taught this
[50:59] way and and may I not, he says, and may
[51:02] I not hurt feelings by saying this, but
[51:04] perhaps it could be that way again.
[51:07] You know, if he is the same yesterday
[51:09] and today and forever, he probably will
[51:11] come a little different than what we are
[51:15] expecting him to come.
[51:17] You ever went to a service and he came
[51:19] different than we expect? Absolutely.
[51:22] He's just being who he is. So, we cannot
[51:26] just put God in our own personal box.
[51:30] Right. Even in even in youth meetings,
[51:33] in youth camps and youth situations, we
[51:35] cannot put them in what we perceive is a
[51:38] youth
[51:39] box. God wants us to grow. So there was
[51:42] a
[51:43] misguided
[51:45] expectation. So I want to ask, what
[51:48] expectations are we leading our churches
[51:51] and youth to? What are what expectations
[51:54] are we what are we telling them about
[51:56] the word? What are we telling them about
[51:58] the Holy Ghost? What it will produce.
[52:00] Right. Amen. What will the Holy Ghost
[52:02] produce? It produces more than a
[52:04] reaction. It produces a life of
[52:07] character. The character of Christ, not
[52:10] the character of a father or the Listen,
[52:13] I want to say if there was anybody that
[52:14] was as close as we could put it to it,
[52:16] we would understand that it would be the
[52:17] prophet of the hour. But I want to even
[52:19] go beyond that character. I want the
[52:22] character of Christ, not putting him
[52:24] down. You follow what I'm saying? So
[52:26] listen, don't just be looking to a man
[52:28] even though we look just as we look to
[52:30] Paul and we look to all of these things.
[52:32] And we're thankful for the leadership of
[52:34] the Lord because we needed that in this
[52:36] hour. Not just needed, we still need it
[52:39] in this hour. But young people, we
[52:41] cannot just be led blindly. We've been
[52:44] led with open eyes so you can see it for
[52:47] yourself. Listen, you have I don't care
[52:50] if you're seven years old, 8 years old,
[52:52] or however old you are. If God opens it
[52:54] to you, it's for you.
[52:58] Not to just have a misguided e
[53:00] expectation. Could it be that we become
[53:02] too political in the pulpits or too
[53:05] legal or too loose or our own
[53:07] convictions and a lot of times we look
[53:10] at legalism and we put it upon a
[53:12] personality or we put it too loose.
[53:15] Somebody says that somebody's too loose
[53:16] and actually it's just because of our
[53:18] own convictions. See the message is not
[53:20] your conviction
[53:22] nor is it my conviction but it's the
[53:25] word of God alive. All I can say is
[53:27] this. Whatever put put goes between you
[53:31] and God is a problem.
[53:34] I'm just going to simplify this. I've
[53:36] always done this. How many's ever played
[53:38] the game Uno?
[53:40] Okay, so that's not a a bad thing in the
[53:42] East. Okay, good.
[53:45] But you know, Uno and you always have
[53:47] that one person that always gets the
[53:48] lucky of drawing all the the the draw
[53:51] four cards and but you're the one that
[53:52] ends up with 16 cards and and I just
[53:55] that's always seems to be my luck. But
[53:57] and so there's literally nothing wrong
[53:59] with that game.
[54:01] But if that game takes the place of God,
[54:05] if all you can think about is that game,
[54:08] then that game becomes wrong. You see,
[54:10] we have just put it to worldly things
[54:12] that we've been that have been preached
[54:13] about in the pulpit and and we we can
[54:16] definitely say drinking and smoking and
[54:18] cussing and pornography and all of these
[54:20] things. Oh yeah, they're wrong. They're
[54:21] for absolutely. But anything even our
[54:25] own opinion,
[54:27] if it's put in between you and God, it
[54:30] becomes wrong. Amen.
[54:34] So uh so here we find they had a
[54:37] misguided expectation in a sense they
[54:40] they looked at him as the political
[54:42] messiah. Many Jews in Jesus's day longed
[54:45] for a military political liberator to
[54:49] overthrow the Roman oppression. Someone
[54:52] like Judah Makabe uh in 190 to 161 BC.
[54:57] He took back the temple of Jerusalem and
[55:00] continued fighting for political and
[55:03] religious freedom. Listen, I'm not
[55:04] saying what he did was wrong because he
[55:07] got the temple back. This temple
[55:09] takeback is where Hanukkah comes from.
[55:12] So, he did a good thing. But in the Jews
[55:14] conception, they were looking for that
[55:16] type of Messiah, one that would come and
[55:19] would take away their problems and give
[55:21] them back that land fully. And when they
[55:24] cried
[55:25] hosana, they were likely invoking Psalms
[55:29] 118's hope for a king who would restore
[55:32] Israel's earthly
[55:34] uh power.
[55:36] I want you to understand. So, so there
[55:38] was this misconception here. He is, he's
[55:41] going to be like this guy. We've got the
[55:43] temple back. And you know, Rome even got
[55:45] to a point where they allowed them to
[55:47] still have their religious worship.
[55:52] And they naturally were not content with
[55:54] that. They wanted more. And here comes
[55:58] Jesus. And though the scrolls and the
[56:00] scriptur had been taught Jesus is going
[56:02] to do this, they thought he was going to
[56:04] come. But what did Jesus do? He
[56:07] deliberately upset their expectations.
[56:11] For he entered Jerusalem humbly on a
[56:14] donkey.
[56:16] Also quoted in Zechariah 9:9. So, he
[56:19] didn't come in with a with a military
[56:21] rulership as they wanted. I mean,
[56:23] listen, our Messiah should be coming in
[56:25] on a chariot. He should be bringing
[56:27] soldiers with me. They should have some
[56:29] swords and ready to cut some heads off.
[56:33] I know that's brutal, but that's that's
[56:34] what they were wanting. But then he
[56:36] preached the kingdom that is not of this
[56:38] world. They were looking for the kingdom
[56:40] of this world. And he said, "No, that's
[56:42] not what we're here for. I'm not here to
[56:45] make your life better." Hold on. The
[56:48] Holy Ghost was not given to you young
[56:49] people to just make you have a good
[56:52] life.
[56:54] And to become content with this life. I
[56:56] mean, what is the point of it? We want
[56:58] out of here. Why would the Holy Ghost
[57:01] come to make you content with
[57:02] everything? That's not what it's there
[57:04] for. And he rejected armed rebellion,
[57:07] which we we find in Matthew
[57:09] 26:52. Remember when he when uh uh Peter
[57:12] took out that sword and cut that ear
[57:14] off? No, we're not doing that. Put it
[57:15] back. That's not what I'm here for. But
[57:17] you've already read it. His mission was
[57:19] spiritual liberation from sin and not a
[57:23] political revolution. Then why are we
[57:25] trying to turn to a political
[57:27] revolution?
[57:31] We're not here for that. We're here for
[57:33] spiritual liberation. We're here to
[57:35] teach our children and to get our young
[57:37] people to say, "Listen, don't do these
[57:39] things. We don't want to just wait till
[57:42] you do it and then give you deliverance.
[57:44] We want you to grow up and know, don't
[57:46] fall for these things. Don't do as I
[57:49] did. It's like we're just sitting back
[57:50] and say and waiting uh uh for for
[57:53] failure to happen because well, they're
[57:54] going to fall anyways. That's not the
[57:57] case. Let's lead them and guide them
[57:59] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[58:01] that spiritual liberation. God help us
[58:04] with that. So, we find as in the
[58:07] previous quote, Jesus went completely
[58:09] against this thought. Jesus deliberately
[58:12] upset these expectations and the
[58:15] deliberate and prophetical occurrence
[58:17] had brought, catch this, a negative
[58:23] unity. Well, lurking for unity, right?
[58:28] Okay, Satan's like, "Well, I'll give you
[58:29] a unity." Yeah, but it becomes a
[58:32] negative unity
[58:36] that would bring the course of history
[58:38] to one of the saddest days coming to the
[58:41] most glorious. You see the crowd's
[58:44] dramatic shift. Notice that. How quick
[58:47] was it? How quick did it go? He's the
[58:50] guy
[58:51] to crucify
[58:54] from acclaiming Jesus as the Messiah
[58:57] Palm Sunday to demanding his crucifixion
[58:59] on Good Friday indeed reflects here it
[59:03] is here's some words that you may not
[59:04] understand but I'll I'll put them up
[59:05] here in a minute reflects the dynamics
[59:08] like a phenomenon called
[59:11] deindividuation also known as herd
[59:13] mentality.
[59:16] How many people actually wanted to cry
[59:18] crucify?
[59:21] But because they were a part of a group,
[59:25] they had put themsel with that group, it
[59:28] became a herd mentality.
[59:32] Notice there was such a worship and an
[59:34] appraise and an adoration. He is and
[59:36] then it got to the the city and because
[59:38] there was this there was literally a
[59:40] move in the city. Who is this guy? Why
[59:43] are we saying he's the Messiah?
[59:46] So now everyone thinks he's the
[59:49] guy and then we come to this where we go
[59:52] from, hey, he's the guy to because we
[59:55] have this de-individuation or herd
[59:57] mentality, they would eventually cry out
[1:00:00] for the life of a murderer over the life
[1:00:03] of a lifegiver.
[1:00:05] So what is this? The thoughts of
[1:00:06] de-individuation.
[1:00:08] This occurs when individuals in a group
[1:00:11] lose their sense of personal
[1:00:14] identity and
[1:00:16] accountability leading to behavior they
[1:00:19] might not engage in alone. And this is
[1:00:23] often fueled by anonymity, heightened
[1:00:27] emotions or group cohesion.
[1:00:31] So you come together, they were there,
[1:00:33] they were worshiping, they were a part
[1:00:35] of it. And because of that, they begin
[1:00:37] to lose their identity. Listen, I'm glad
[1:00:40] that we've got young people sitting up
[1:00:41] here. That to me is a a beautiful thing.
[1:00:45] But each and every one of these young
[1:00:47] people have to have their own personal
[1:00:50] relationship and identity with God.
[1:00:55] God help us to to to bring this to bring
[1:00:58] this home in this. So what do we find?
[1:01:00] So because of this then there is a loss
[1:01:03] of
[1:01:04] self-awareness. Individuals in a group
[1:01:06] may feel less aware of themselves and
[1:01:09] their own
[1:01:10] actions because a person is so engrossed
[1:01:13] in what the group is doing and being a
[1:01:15] part of their own self-awareness
[1:01:19] suffers. What you would do by yourself
[1:01:21] out there or even if you were a young
[1:01:24] person or a father or mother sitting in
[1:01:26] a pew with no one else here. If we're
[1:01:28] not careful, we change based upon the
[1:01:32] group.
[1:01:34] They follow the crowd no matter what the
[1:01:36] size. You can look at this in youth camp
[1:01:39] in in youth camp emotion as it can play
[1:01:42] a huge role in this. You might think
[1:01:44] that I'm against those things. I'm
[1:01:45] absolutely not. I just don't want the
[1:01:47] young people to lose their identity.
[1:01:50] We're not just doing it because someone
[1:01:52] else is doing it. We worship how the God
[1:01:55] has placed it upon our hearts. Listen,
[1:01:57] not everyone worships the same. Somebody
[1:01:59] may uh uh be all over the place and it's
[1:02:02] coming from the heart and you may just
[1:02:03] want to stay right where you're at and
[1:02:05] it's coming from your heart. Well, by
[1:02:07] all means, be that way without a
[1:02:09] critical spirit.
[1:02:11] Instead of trying to get everybody to do
[1:02:13] the same thing to where it's group
[1:02:15] cohesion, if we can just have group,
[1:02:16] then we've lost our self-awareness. And
[1:02:19] when we lose our self-awareness, we
[1:02:21] don't know who we are. When you get
[1:02:23] amongst your friends in school, if
[1:02:25] you're not careful, you lose
[1:02:26] self-awareness. Or on the job, you lose
[1:02:29] self-awareness and it becomes group.
[1:02:30] Listen, that's what everybody wants to
[1:02:32] do. Come together. Let's unify. I mean,
[1:02:34] I mean, shouldn't that's what we're
[1:02:36] doing in this age today, right? We want
[1:02:37] unity, don't we? We've got to be careful
[1:02:39] with that because if we're not careful,
[1:02:41] it turns into loss of self-awareness.
[1:02:44] And then when this happens, we have
[1:02:46] reduced
[1:02:47] accountability which is the perceived
[1:02:50] anonymity or self a loss of self can
[1:02:53] lead to a decrease in personal
[1:02:56] responsibility for their actions.
[1:03:00] You can see this in road rage
[1:03:03] or online
[1:03:06] warriors. You have
[1:03:08] anonymity. I will say that word so many
[1:03:10] times I'll probably mess it up tonight.
[1:03:13] And if not brought under control feeds
[1:03:16] power to the rage. People will do in
[1:03:19] their car what they will not do to your
[1:03:21] face
[1:03:23] because I'm behind the wheel. They don't
[1:03:26] know who I am. There's a lot of uh uh uh
[1:03:30] what do you call those Christian fishes
[1:03:32] on the back of the cars? I think they
[1:03:33] lost their Holy Ghost
[1:03:37] or they bought someone else's car. I
[1:03:39] don't know what it
[1:03:41] is, but they reduce their
[1:03:43] accountability. It becomes easy to Oh,
[1:03:44] I'm going to get them
[1:03:48] back. Oh my. And then we have group
[1:03:52] identity. Individuals may identify more
[1:03:55] with the group's norm and values
[1:03:57] potentially leading to behaviors that
[1:03:59] would be unusual for them as an
[1:04:03] individual. I want to say this. I
[1:04:06] believe it's good. And and I even seen
[1:04:08] it in my my kids. My kids had got to a
[1:04:11] point to where uh and if they're
[1:04:13] watching you, you're gonna get talked
[1:04:14] about, Eli and Ethan, wherever I go. So,
[1:04:17] good luck. You know, I had seen it to
[1:04:20] where they had kind of gone into a shell
[1:04:22] where they were by themselves and and
[1:04:24] they needed to be pulled out from that.
[1:04:26] And so, taking them to youth camp helped
[1:04:29] them come out of it. So, there's good in
[1:04:31] this, but you cannot lose your
[1:04:33] self-awareness. what God how God has
[1:04:36] created you. Think about this with
[1:04:38] Ananas and Safire and their motivation
[1:04:41] because in Ananas and Safire there was
[1:04:43] such a mighty move during this time that
[1:04:46] you know if you if you look about it
[1:04:47] everyone was selling what they had and
[1:04:49] they were giving to the church they were
[1:04:51] giving because of the move of God. And
[1:04:53] if you look at the scripture you don't
[1:04:55] find where they were begging for it.
[1:04:57] They were not asking for it. There was
[1:04:58] such a move people were wanting to do
[1:05:01] this for the cause of Christ. Right? So
[1:05:03] then you find this because this is a
[1:05:05] good group thing. We look at this of
[1:05:08] Ananas and Safire's motivation in
[1:05:10] craving acceptance, their desire for
[1:05:13] status. You see, because the couple sold
[1:05:16] their property, but secretly kept part
[1:05:19] of the proceeds while claiming to donate
[1:05:22] everything. Their lies stemmed not from
[1:05:26] greed alone but from a desire to be seen
[1:05:29] as equals in the
[1:05:31] group to gain the honor according to
[1:05:34] Barnabas without the same
[1:05:37] sacrifice. So the tragedy of Ananas and
[1:05:40] Safire highlights
[1:05:42] attention. A healthy community fosters
[1:05:46] accountability
[1:05:48] and mutual care, but toxic
[1:05:51] conformity stifles honesty and grace.
[1:05:55] You see, the early church's response to
[1:05:57] this situation, severe but purifying,
[1:06:00] ultimately strengthen its witness. So
[1:06:03] when you have a healthy community within
[1:06:05] the church, that's necessary. So I'm not
[1:06:09] saying that you that you should uh
[1:06:11] always uh pull yourself away from the
[1:06:12] assembly. No, the having the proper move
[1:06:15] of God in the church is healthy. But if
[1:06:18] it becomes oppression or toxic
[1:06:20] conformity, it'll stifle honesty because
[1:06:23] we're not here to to to be like the
[1:06:26] Joneses. That's right. I don't know if
[1:06:28] there's any Joneses here, but that's
[1:06:30] just an old statement. We're not here to
[1:06:32] be like this one or that one. Listen, uh
[1:06:34] uh if it's only the widow's might, give
[1:06:36] the widow's might. You see, so it's not
[1:06:39] about conforming to what someone else
[1:06:41] does, but from your heart. So notice
[1:06:43] this this crowd effect on Palm Sunday,
[1:06:46] the crowd's exuberant praise. Hosanna
[1:06:50] was collective expression of hope with
[1:06:54] individuals caught up in the fervor of
[1:06:57] me of the messianic
[1:06:59] expectation. After all, they have been
[1:07:01] taught there would come one, but most
[1:07:04] likely conviction taught instead of word
[1:07:10] taught. I want that to sink in.
[1:07:12] Conviction taught instead of word
[1:07:15] taught.
[1:07:16] Because there's a lot of people that
[1:07:18] have convictions and they're okay. Or
[1:07:21] personal convictions. Listen, I'm not
[1:07:23] knocking personal convictions. If you
[1:07:25] have a personal conviction, perhaps you
[1:07:27] need that personal conviction to keep
[1:07:29] you in your straight and narrow. But you
[1:07:32] cannot always push your personal
[1:07:34] conviction on the next person.
[1:07:37] I get it. We're not here to offend our
[1:07:39] brother and and and I'm not here to put
[1:07:41] things in front of you that would hurt
[1:07:42] your feelings. You understand what I'm
[1:07:44] saying? But because it had got to such a
[1:07:46] point where their perception of the word
[1:07:49] and their thought of how it would be
[1:07:51] then caused this this this big uh uh
[1:07:54] frantic uh hosana this is the guy and
[1:07:58] then before you know it by Friday the
[1:08:01] same crowd same
[1:08:04] crowd think about it crucify hosana to
[1:08:08] crucify
[1:08:09] here anonymity in the mob combined with
[1:08:13] agitation
[1:08:15] from religious leaders
[1:08:18] eroded moral reasoning and enabled the
[1:08:22] shift towards violence.
[1:08:25] They weren't violent one week before.
[1:08:29] In fact, this was the guy. But now
[1:08:32] because the same herd mentality they had
[1:08:35] here
[1:08:37] moved to this and now they were now they
[1:08:40] were let down.
[1:08:42] Hey, I thought that if I came to church,
[1:08:44] everything would come together. That's
[1:08:46] not what he said.
[1:08:49] That's not what was preached. You heard
[1:08:50] the wrong word.
[1:08:52] And now that we've come to the
[1:08:54] situation, people become violent. Then
[1:08:56] by this, they are offered what would be
[1:08:59] the most ridiculous offer on any other
[1:09:02] day. any other day. If they were by
[1:09:04] themselves and they had Jesus, the one
[1:09:06] who fed the 5000, the one who opened the
[1:09:09] blinded eyes, the one who did these
[1:09:11] things, if they were one-on-one with
[1:09:12] him, I believe they would not have
[1:09:15] perhaps cried this. We're talking about
[1:09:16] the crowd in general. We know the
[1:09:18] Pharisees and all of these things, what
[1:09:20] they were wanting in their desires. But
[1:09:21] I'm trying to bring us to an
[1:09:23] understanding that a lot of times we
[1:09:25] base our decisions based upon c being
[1:09:28] caught up in something. All right.
[1:09:31] Notice. So, I I want to I want to kind
[1:09:34] of bring this. The the life of a
[1:09:35] murderer or the life of a healer
[1:09:40] in in your right mind, what would you
[1:09:42] say? I want the healer, man. Give me the
[1:09:45] healer.
[1:09:46] Let Let Barabus stay where he's at.
[1:09:49] We're going to get to something about
[1:09:50] Barabus in a moment, though. So, let's
[1:09:52] bring this into a little little uh
[1:09:55] something that that I I ran across in
[1:09:58] France.
[1:10:00] France was reeling from a documentary.
[1:10:02] Oh, here I go. I can't say that with
[1:10:04] Hannah. She
[1:10:06] doc documentary. Thank you. It's not a
[1:10:08] documentary. It's a
[1:10:10] documentary. They were reeling from a
[1:10:12] documentary about a psychological
[1:10:15] experiment disguised as a game show. So,
[1:10:18] this whole thing is a disguise.
[1:10:22] Researchers stage a fictitious reality
[1:10:25] show to see how far people would go in
[1:10:28] obeying authority, especially if
[1:10:32] television reinforces that
[1:10:35] authority. Now, the disturbing result
[1:10:38] alarmed the French. Hopefully, it alarms
[1:10:41] all of us. So here they created this
[1:10:44] game show and the fictitious game show
[1:10:47] had all the trappings of a real TV quiz
[1:10:49] show including a beautiful and
[1:10:51] well-known hostess and a a very rockous
[1:10:55] uh audience if I said that right. So an
[1:10:57] audience that is a Ford and they're
[1:10:58] they're ready to go and a group of
[1:11:01] contestants posed questions to a man
[1:11:04] sitting inside of a box in front of them
[1:11:07] in an electric chair.
[1:11:09] So perhaps you've heard this before. So
[1:11:12] here we find this this whole crowd is a
[1:11:15] is is in this and the hostess and a
[1:11:18] chanting audience urged the players who
[1:11:20] had levers in front of him. So each
[1:11:22] player had a lever in front of them to
[1:11:25] send jolts of electricity into the man
[1:11:28] in the box when he gave an incorrect
[1:11:33] answer. Even when the players screamed
[1:11:36] out in pain for them to stop, 80% of the
[1:11:40] contestants kept zapping
[1:11:43] him. I want that to sink
[1:11:46] in. In reality, the man in the electric
[1:11:49] chair was the actor and wasn't really
[1:11:52] being shocked, but the players and the
[1:11:56] audience did not know that.
[1:11:59] And we look at this uh this uh
[1:12:03] documentary makers say reality
[1:12:06] television relies increasingly on
[1:12:09] violent, humiliating, and cruel acts to
[1:12:12] boost their ratings. And they say they
[1:12:15] simply wanted to see if we would go so
[1:12:19] far as to kill someone for
[1:12:21] entertainment.
[1:12:24] And they continued the supposed game of
[1:12:27] death.
[1:12:29] until this is the real guy sitting here.
[1:12:32] Until under the pressure of the game,
[1:12:35] one person pushed long enough to what
[1:12:39] supposed was to kill the
[1:12:42] man. In his mind, he thought it was
[1:12:45] real. But he became so filled with that
[1:12:49] mentality and so caught up in that
[1:12:51] moment. Come on, let's bring these two
[1:12:54] ties together.
[1:12:56] He says, now this is this is the man
[1:12:58] that said this. He said, 'I wanted to
[1:13:01] stop the whole time, but I just
[1:13:03] couldn't. I didn't have the will to do
[1:13:06] it, and that goes against my nature. He
[1:13:09] said, "I haven't really figured out why
[1:13:11] I did
[1:13:13] it." So, think about this. A higher
[1:13:16] percentage of participants willing to
[1:13:18] shock the subject shows that the
[1:13:21] manipulative power of television further
[1:13:24] increases people's willingness to obey.
[1:13:27] I don't want you to just get hung up and
[1:13:29] think I'm speaking about television
[1:13:30] because this goes well beyond that.
[1:13:35] The the day after the talk shows
[1:13:37] ruminated over the documentary,
[1:13:40] comparisons were being drawn to the
[1:13:41] manipulation of the masses in Nazi
[1:13:44] Germany. One of the game show
[1:13:46] participants, I just read it, talked
[1:13:48] about his haunting experience, saying
[1:13:51] that he wanted to stop, but he pushed it
[1:13:54] so long until they finally said, and
[1:13:57] this man acted like he died. And in the
[1:14:00] footage of the game show, the hostess
[1:14:02] yells, "And you've
[1:14:05] won." After this actor leans over as if
[1:14:10] he was
[1:14:12] dead, what have we won by losing our
[1:14:17] personal relationship?
[1:14:21] The host. So, as this guy makes this
[1:14:23] decision, the host then counters. He
[1:14:25] says, "You know, I actually pulled up
[1:14:27] the footage of you supposedly pumping
[1:14:30] 460 volts of electricity until the actor
[1:14:34] pretended to be electrocuted. But it
[1:14:36] sure didn't seem like you were stopping.
[1:14:38] What happened? It became to such a
[1:14:41] condition, being so caught up in being
[1:14:43] to push something. The peer pressure
[1:14:45] being all around it. Hey, guess what?
[1:14:48] They're doing this. They're doing this.
[1:14:49] I'm going to win. And before you know
[1:14:51] it, somebody was crying crucify.
[1:14:56] When one week before we were in worship,
[1:15:00] we were at youth camp. Hold up.
[1:15:05] I want that to really sink in. Notice
[1:15:07] what he says here. Brother Brandon makes
[1:15:09] a statement. He says, "And the blind
[1:15:10] traditions or systems could not see that
[1:15:13] that was God by their own prophet that
[1:15:16] who the word came to that said he would
[1:15:19] be God." The blind system. So they had
[1:15:21] rejected the word and desired a
[1:15:24] murderer.
[1:15:29] Instead, Barabus
[1:15:32] The sheep being led to the slaughter.
[1:15:34] Jesus's way of leadership was not
[1:15:37] ingrained in the human mindset. They
[1:15:39] wanted blood and he would not bring it
[1:15:43] through the Romans. Instead, he gave
[1:15:45] them
[1:15:46] his. They wanted the Romans blood, but
[1:15:50] he gave them his blood. They were
[1:15:53] crying, "Listen, you're the guy that's
[1:15:54] going to take me from these problems,
[1:15:56] and you're the guy that's going to
[1:15:57] avenge us of all of the wrongdoing and
[1:16:00] all of the hurt feelings and all of the
[1:16:02] times we were thrown in jail for no
[1:16:04] reason. You're the guy." And he says,
[1:16:06] "No, I'm not that
[1:16:07] guy." They could not see it. And many in
[1:16:11] the crowd expected Jesus to declare
[1:16:13] himself as his polit political liberator
[1:16:15] when he instead submitted to the arrest
[1:16:19] and refused to resist. And then their
[1:16:23] unmet hopes turned to
[1:16:27] rage. And what is this? This is a
[1:16:30] psychological response to cognitive
[1:16:33] dissonance. So what is it? clinging to
[1:16:37] Barabus, his violent resistance as a
[1:16:40] safer
[1:16:42] alternative. I want that to sink in.
[1:16:45] Now, if you look at history in general,
[1:16:47] the Romans did not imprison
[1:16:49] anybody that was their
[1:16:52] own. So, Barabus was actually a fighter
[1:16:56] and a resistor for Israel.
[1:17:00] And because of their and because of
[1:17:03] their disappointment and because Jesus
[1:17:06] just turned himself in, basically it
[1:17:09] exploded their mind and and because of
[1:17:12] their desire for blood,
[1:17:15] Barabus became the safer bet.
[1:17:22] What does this even mean? This cognitive
[1:17:25] dissonance it is a psychological
[1:17:27] phenomenon occurs when people hold
[1:17:29] conflicting beliefs or values or when
[1:17:32] their actions contradict their beliefs
[1:17:34] leading to discomfort and a drive to
[1:17:37] reduce inconsistency. Okay, let me make
[1:17:40] this that goes every over everybody's
[1:17:42] head even mine. So let me just bring
[1:17:44] this out. It's like smoking despite
[1:17:48] knowing the risks. A person who spokes
[1:17:50] despite being aware of the health and
[1:17:52] spiritual hazards might rationalize
[1:17:55] their habit by saying it's just one or
[1:17:58] I'll quit eventually. So they know the
[1:18:00] risk yet they're willing to go this
[1:18:02] route. They knew the risks of what they
[1:18:05] were doing by calling Barabus. But
[1:18:08] because of their frustration, because of
[1:18:10] their desire to uh to have their needs
[1:18:13] met, they were willing to go with the
[1:18:15] risk. You can also look at this in peer
[1:18:18] pressure. A teenager might engage in
[1:18:20] risky behavior such as drinking and
[1:18:22] smoking or whatever it is to fit in with
[1:18:24] their peers even if they know it's
[1:18:27] wrong. Look at Peter himself who said,
[1:18:31] "I'm not going to deny you." Listen,
[1:18:33] you're sitting here now and you're like,
[1:18:34] I'm going to be a believer. I'm going to
[1:18:36] do these things. But when you are put
[1:18:38] with those of the world and you're put
[1:18:40] under that pressure, Peter before uh uh
[1:18:44] before the Holy Spirit in his life
[1:18:46] denied the Christ under pressure.
[1:18:50] Think about this. What did they say?
[1:18:52] They got so much into a condition and
[1:18:55] knowing the risk they said then answered
[1:18:58] all the people and said his blood be on
[1:19:00] us
[1:19:02] and our
[1:19:04] children destroying the lives of their
[1:19:07] children based on mere
[1:19:10] frustration. They were willing to give
[1:19:13] their children's
[1:19:15] lives. And how many lives today are
[1:19:17] being destroyed as young people are
[1:19:20] calling for Barabus because it's the
[1:19:23] easier life.
[1:19:26] And we don't care about the
[1:19:27] consequences. I've heard this before. I
[1:19:29] don't care about the consequences.
[1:19:32] I this is just how I feel. I want to sew
[1:19:34] my wild oats or however you want to say.
[1:19:36] This is the way I want to go and this is
[1:19:38] what Listen, I I'm going to say this
[1:19:39] with all of my heart. I don't believe
[1:19:41] that we have time for prodigals.
[1:19:45] And you say, "Are they not going to come
[1:19:47] in?" No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm
[1:19:48] saying, don't give it a second thought.
[1:19:52] Don't let his blood be on our hands. I
[1:19:55] got to care about those consequences. I
[1:19:57] want to care about those consequences.
[1:20:00] And think about what he says. What will
[1:20:01] I do with Jesus called the anointed
[1:20:04] word? You've heard it. You know it's the
[1:20:06] truth. It's thoroughly vindicated. He
[1:20:08] says, "A murderer? Why would you desire
[1:20:12] a a a denominational murder of the word
[1:20:14] than the innocent Christ? Would you
[1:20:16] crucify? Would you dare take Barabbus?
[1:20:19] Could you call for a Barabbus? How dare
[1:20:21] anyone do that to call for Barabbus, the
[1:20:24] murder of the word, than to take the
[1:20:26] word itself, which is life. Notice he
[1:20:28] says, "And it's on your hands." Right.
[1:20:33] And I like this is uh to think about how
[1:20:36] he got this thought of what shall I do
[1:20:38] with Jesus called Christ. He says when I
[1:20:40] heard of the murder of President
[1:20:42] Kennedy, this message fell on my heart.
[1:20:45] I thought what will that man do? And no
[1:20:48] way out of it now. He might awoke by by
[1:20:52] this time and realized what lays ahead.
[1:20:54] He says and you're going to you're going
[1:20:56] to awake sometime here or on the tape
[1:20:59] wherever you're at. You're going to
[1:21:00] awake sometime, sinner, and realize that
[1:21:03] there's blood on your hand. Notice,
[1:21:05] notice the seriousness he's putting in
[1:21:07] the people and the blood of the son of
[1:21:10] God, and you're guilty of murdering him.
[1:21:12] Uh your sin murdered him. Your unbelief
[1:21:14] u uh in his word, your failing to see
[1:21:17] his
[1:21:18] identification grieved away the Holy
[1:21:21] Spirit. Notice he said to see his
[1:21:23] identification. Listen, he wants you to
[1:21:25] see who see him as he truly is. Not in
[1:21:28] the perception of a man or perception of
[1:21:32] a of a conviction or but how do I really
[1:21:36] see him? How do I really do I really
[1:21:38] know who Jesus is? Is he is he personal
[1:21:40] to me? And he says, "What will I do with
[1:21:43] Jesus called Christ?" Pilate said he had
[1:21:46] been placed in his hands and the blood
[1:21:48] of Jesus Christ is placed again on the
[1:21:50] hands of this congregation. and it's
[1:21:51] placed on the hands of the nation and
[1:21:53] around this world where these tapes has
[1:21:55] been and the things that's been
[1:21:56] vindicated and proved of God. Now, what
[1:21:58] will we do with that with this Jesus
[1:22:01] that's called the same yesterday, today,
[1:22:03] and forever?
[1:22:05] We'll skip down a little bit here. Says
[1:22:07] we must face the facts that he's on our
[1:22:09] hands because we've seen him in his
[1:22:11] word. We've seen him a vindicate himself
[1:22:13] and we know that he's the same
[1:22:14] yesterday, today, and forever. Listen,
[1:22:18] he did not come to just give us better
[1:22:20] things
[1:22:22] and to make us feel good and to make us
[1:22:24] have the the, you know, all the funny
[1:22:26] feelings and all of those things. He did
[1:22:27] not come to to to make everything come
[1:22:30] politically together and to be the best
[1:22:32] church and the greater church and the
[1:22:33] best ministry and the best pastor and
[1:22:35] the best youth group and the best all of
[1:22:37] this and that. Listen, I remember going
[1:22:39] through that being a small church myself
[1:22:41] where where we're at and and I remember
[1:22:43] starting to travel around to places and
[1:22:45] then social medias uh explodes with all
[1:22:48] kinds of testimonies coming from other
[1:22:50] different churches and and I begin to
[1:22:52] get discouraged within my heart and just
[1:22:54] say, "God, uh I there's nothing
[1:22:56] happening
[1:22:57] here. I know you've never went through
[1:22:59] that."
[1:23:01] And then God began to deal with my heart
[1:23:04] and and I began to remember this miracle
[1:23:07] and this thing that God had done and see
[1:23:09] this salvation brought to this one and
[1:23:12] this one and this one and all these
[1:23:14] things. And God began to remind me. He
[1:23:15] says, "Why are you looking out there?
[1:23:18] Look what I have done for you. Come back
[1:23:21] to this situation. I don't want to be
[1:23:23] Israel and be caught up in the crowd and
[1:23:25] the further of all of those things and
[1:23:27] lose my identity.
[1:23:29] I'm not here to preach the way you want
[1:23:31] me to preach or to teach the way you
[1:23:33] want me to teach. Brother Samuel's not
[1:23:34] here to do it. Brother Nathaniel,
[1:23:36] Brother Randy, and all all the ministers
[1:23:37] that may be here. We're here to go as
[1:23:40] God has called us to go and to go that
[1:23:42] way and to not just and and to not have
[1:23:45] an attitude that we're better than
[1:23:46] anybody or or or or any of these things,
[1:23:49] but say, "God, what do you want from me?
[1:23:51] If I'm going to preach to one or if I'm
[1:23:53] going to preach to 500, if I'm going to
[1:23:55] stay in my local body, let me do this.
[1:23:57] Let me respect the ministry that I've
[1:23:59] been put under. Let me respect the
[1:24:01] ministry that God has called in this
[1:24:03] day. Young people, don't be looking
[1:24:06] around.
[1:24:07] Focus on what God is doing for you in
[1:24:10] your local body.
[1:24:12] God will bless you for doing that. God
[1:24:15] has something for you. But the problem
[1:24:17] of it is is we're always looking around
[1:24:19] for something better.
[1:24:22] Look at what God is doing for you. God
[1:24:24] gave you a wonderful church. God gave
[1:24:27] you a one wonderful leadership. And that
[1:24:29] leadership may make mistakes, but guess
[1:24:32] what? The one that you're looking to is
[1:24:34] doing the same thing.
[1:24:37] Because there's no perfect pastor.
[1:24:39] There's no perfect evangelist. There's
[1:24:41] no perfect apostle. There's no perfect
[1:24:44] prophet you in in that that realm. You
[1:24:46] know what I'm talking about. There is no
[1:24:48] perfect anyone but Jesus Christ. And he
[1:24:51] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:24:53] forever. I want to come back and not
[1:24:56] choose Barabus because it feels better
[1:24:59] or looks better. It's shiny. It's
[1:25:02] glittery. It's all kinds of things.
[1:25:04] Listen, everyone's doing it. It doesn't
[1:25:06] matter if everyone's doing it. And I'm
[1:25:07] not talking about worldly things. I'm
[1:25:09] bringing it back home to this message.
[1:25:11] We are I don't people don't get caught
[1:25:14] up in trying to find the next big thing.
[1:25:17] You're going to if you're not careful,
[1:25:18] you'll start crying for Barabus.
[1:25:25] We're not here for better financial gain
[1:25:27] or better worldly friends or even
[1:25:30] friends in this church. What if God
[1:25:32] never never gave you a friend in the
[1:25:34] church?
[1:25:37] What does the scripture say? He is a
[1:25:39] friend that's sticker closer than a
[1:25:41] brother. I've seen friends in the church
[1:25:45] literally talk themselves out of
[1:25:47] blessings.
[1:25:50] Wow.
[1:25:53] I told my my my my my boys this and I
[1:25:55] said, "Listen," I said, "I grew up
[1:25:57] sitting in the same pew just like you
[1:25:59] are right now, sitting next to a
[1:26:01] brother. I don't know if y'all are all
[1:26:02] related or not. I have no
[1:26:05] clue. But I sat in the pew with my
[1:26:08] friend, grew up with him, stayed the
[1:26:10] night with him. We would come under the
[1:26:12] same leadership of the same uh word as
[1:26:15] it were from our pastor, Brother Clark,
[1:26:17] and the the same anointing." And and I'm
[1:26:20] thinking, God, the same thing that I
[1:26:21] heard. And yet over half of them walked
[1:26:24] away from God.
[1:26:28] And I look at that and I say, "Brother,
[1:26:30] how do I deserve this?" I don't.
[1:26:34] I'm thankful that that there was those
[1:26:35] that saved. And I want to say this, I
[1:26:37] still haven't given up hope on them. I
[1:26:40] haven't thrown the towel in on them. As
[1:26:41] long as there's breath in their body, I
[1:26:42] still am praying for their souls that
[1:26:44] they come in. But we can't become so
[1:26:47] attached to the person sitting next to
[1:26:48] us
[1:26:50] that if we start listening to them over
[1:26:52] the word of God
[1:26:54] and they may be a close friend and they
[1:26:56] be may be somebody that was raised in
[1:26:58] the same church and you've known them
[1:26:59] for 10 years, 15 years or 20 years. It
[1:27:02] doesn't matter. That's right. Hold to
[1:27:05] Jesus.
[1:27:07] You be the light that shines. You be the
[1:27:09] one that holds on because you never know
[1:27:11] when you might be the one that will help
[1:27:12] him out.
[1:27:14] This is why the question is, what is the
[1:27:17] Barabus in our life?
[1:27:20] What is it that thing that is calling at
[1:27:22] us and drawing at us? Have we got so
[1:27:24] caught up to where we're pushing that
[1:27:26] lever and we're thinking we're doing the
[1:27:28] right thing and we're thinking we're
[1:27:29] going the right direction, but really
[1:27:31] we're following a crowd.
[1:27:34] Can you choose tonight what it is?
[1:27:37] Because I want to ask this question.
[1:27:38] What is it in a sense worth? What is
[1:27:40] worth missing out on the resurrected
[1:27:42] Savior? I have come to give you life.
[1:27:45] Why choose Barabus? Why choose death?
[1:27:47] Why be separated eternally when his arms
[1:27:50] are wide open saying, "Here I am for
[1:27:53] you. Here I am to give you everything
[1:27:56] that you'll need. You're going to go
[1:27:57] through some hard times. You're going to
[1:27:58] go through struggles. You know, I know
[1:28:00] of people who uh who are I would still
[1:28:03] call them young, but they're quite a bit
[1:28:05] older who are not yet married and they
[1:28:07] struggled with trying to find the right
[1:28:09] one. And listen, Satan will always throw
[1:28:11] them at you. Right,
[1:28:14] he'll always throw them at you. So, make
[1:28:16] sure our hearts are in tune to God. Oh,
[1:28:20] Lord, I I wish that I could preach this
[1:28:22] tonight on how I feel and how I want
[1:28:23] these young people to be so sold out to
[1:28:26] God. Listen, that it becomes more than
[1:28:28] religion. I sat on that pew and I held
[1:28:30] my Bible. I did the right part. I
[1:28:32] remember following somebody and and and
[1:28:35] the way this individual uh uh you know,
[1:28:37] sealed up the Bible and put it in there,
[1:28:38] I did that. I walked like them. I talked
[1:28:40] like him. and and and I prayed and I and
[1:28:42] I wanted to be like him and and then
[1:28:44] before you know it, I moved to this
[1:28:45] person and and I and I imitated this and
[1:28:47] I imitated that. It's okay for that
[1:28:49] imitation at a certain age, but after a
[1:28:51] while, you need to start knowing Jesus
[1:28:53] for yourself
[1:28:55] to where you don't just move uh uh uh
[1:28:57] from one situation to another situation
[1:29:00] based upon your circumstances. Because I
[1:29:02] hate to say it, life is not going to
[1:29:04] turn out like you think it is. You're
[1:29:06] not all going to be a hero.
[1:29:12] I didn't know I was going to be a
[1:29:14] plumber, and I'm not getting into that
[1:29:16] tonight.
[1:29:19] I didn't know, but I was I was in some
[1:29:22] pretty bad situations.
[1:29:25] I didn't know what what was going to
[1:29:26] happen in my life. I wanted this type of
[1:29:28] life. I wanted this. And how many
[1:29:30] disappointments have come my
[1:29:32] way? And disappointments will come your
[1:29:35] way. And situations will come your way.
[1:29:37] I'm going to tell you the tell of two
[1:29:38] stories. Can I go just a little bit
[1:29:40] further on these two stories? I'm going
[1:29:42] to tell you the tell of two different
[1:29:43] stories. And I don't know if anyone's
[1:29:45] listening back at home, but uh I just
[1:29:47] feel led to bring this out. Anyways, so
[1:29:49] we had a situation years ago of a young
[1:29:52] couple who had who had just gotten
[1:29:54] married and and they were uh uh they
[1:29:56] they were pregnant for their first child
[1:29:59] and uh I don't know how far along they
[1:30:02] were. I don't know. May do you remember
[1:30:04] Hannah?
[1:30:06] Whatever that means. 17 or 18 weeks.
[1:30:09] That seems like a long time to me. I
[1:30:11] have no clue. But anyways, it was a long
[1:30:13] time. She definitely was showing. And
[1:30:15] and and I'll never forget this, brother
[1:30:17] Samuel. I was to speak that that I would
[1:30:20] believe it was a Sunday night when we
[1:30:21] were still having church on Sunday night
[1:30:22] or maybe it was a Saturday and I was
[1:30:24] praying on the front row and and just
[1:30:26] all of a sudden something began to come
[1:30:29] all over me. I be just cry out for no
[1:30:31] reason. I don't know what it was, but I
[1:30:33] was just crying out in agony. And 30
[1:30:36] minutes later, uh, as they were on their
[1:30:38] way to church, they were one block from
[1:30:40] our church and someone ran a stop sign
[1:30:43] and and and that stop sign, it killed
[1:30:45] killed the
[1:30:47] child inside of the womb. And I will
[1:30:50] never forget, it was my first experience
[1:30:52] as a pastor to go and to be with that
[1:30:54] family and she had to give birth to that
[1:30:57] child. and and to hear the cry of that
[1:31:01] mother and that and and to hear the
[1:31:02] burden of that mother and that father
[1:31:05] and crying out to God, God, please bring
[1:31:08] this child back to life. Please, I'll do
[1:31:10] anything. I'll do this. And there was
[1:31:12] just this agony for days. And and and
[1:31:15] then you just you think about sometimes
[1:31:17] you sit back, you're like, "God, why?
[1:31:20] Why is this happening?
[1:31:22] What what can we do? I believe you're a
[1:31:24] miracle working God." And it seems like
[1:31:26] everybody's faith just begins to turn to
[1:31:28] that
[1:31:29] situation, but nothing ever
[1:31:33] happened. But I want to say this, that
[1:31:36] couple is still serving the Lord and now
[1:31:39] has two beautiful young ladies.
[1:31:43] You see, a lot of times we're only
[1:31:45] looking to the miracles
[1:31:47] of the healing and the and the
[1:31:50] supernatural. But listen, to me, it's
[1:31:52] supernatural to be able to go through
[1:31:55] dark times like that and still hold on.
[1:32:00] If we only point out all of these things
[1:32:04] and you become the individual that goes
[1:32:06] the other way, how are you going to
[1:32:08] feel? We need to be honest that God
[1:32:10] works in both sides. Cuz if we're saying
[1:32:12] over here where everything is all the
[1:32:15] cancers always fall off and I'm all for
[1:32:16] that. But if that's all we're pointing
[1:32:18] to and that's the miracle and that's the
[1:32:20] thing, then we're actually negating the
[1:32:22] fact about all those people who died at
[1:32:24] the stake. That's right. And seen their
[1:32:28] children killed before them and saw a
[1:32:30] sunder. Listen, we need to go back to
[1:32:32] the horror of these times and remember
[1:32:35] that was ugly times.
[1:32:38] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:32:40] And if all we're pointing to is this, we
[1:32:43] forget this. Then what about when you go
[1:32:45] through something? Well, why? I guess
[1:32:47] God doesn't love me.
[1:32:50] Because he loved them enough to do this.
[1:32:56] I want to remind you young people and
[1:32:58] each and every one of us that we're not
[1:33:01] immune to tragedy and situations.
[1:33:05] That's why you got to know where you
[1:33:06] stand.
[1:33:09] That's why it can't just be a crowd
[1:33:11] mentality and caught up and I'm all for
[1:33:14] those things and I'm all for getting
[1:33:16] excited with that crowd. But listen,
[1:33:18] I've seen the miracles tonight. Listen,
[1:33:20] it excites me to hear the testimony of
[1:33:22] our brother singing. Maybe I I Is that
[1:33:25] okay? It's okay. I'm looking at you and
[1:33:28] I done forgot your name, but Paul,
[1:33:30] brother Paul, I was I had it before you
[1:33:33] said it, but you get behind here
[1:33:35] sometimes. To me, that's a testimony to
[1:33:39] get behind here to worship God and to
[1:33:41] not have a care in the world of what
[1:33:43] Satan thinks about it. Let them say what
[1:33:46] they want to say. Keep worshiping God.
[1:33:50] I don't care what the world says about
[1:33:51] it. Keep worshiping God. It may not be
[1:33:54] the way you want it to be, but it's the
[1:33:56] way God called him to be.
[1:33:58] And that's the thing we've got to look
[1:34:00] at. I can't make you be like me and vice
[1:34:04] versa. God. And then you turn to the
[1:34:08] other side. We had a miracle of
[1:34:09] ourselves. And this is where I begin to
[1:34:10] say, "God, why this?" You uh I don't
[1:34:14] know if any of you met my little girl,
[1:34:15] Evelyn, but she's uh 8 years old now.
[1:34:19] And I will never forget uh one uh the
[1:34:22] day it was on a Sunday afternoon. And
[1:34:25] here we go again asking the question to
[1:34:26] my wife. How far along were you, dear?
[1:34:30] Who? All right. 20 weeks. That's not a
[1:34:32] who, but that's a question. 20 weeks.
[1:34:34] 20. She's 20 weeks. So that at 20 weeks,
[1:34:37] her water broke on a Sunday afternoon.
[1:34:40] We go to the hospital. And of course,
[1:34:41] when you go to the hospital, a lot of
[1:34:43] times doctors and nurses, they see so
[1:34:45] much they've just become hardened.
[1:34:48] And so we come in and they're hardened.
[1:34:50] They're just like, "Oh, nothing's wrong
[1:34:51] with you. You know, you're this, you're
[1:34:53] that, and uh you you're just somebody
[1:34:55] that's coming in and just being all
[1:34:56] nervous about the situation." And we go
[1:34:59] in there and they do the test and they
[1:35:01] find out that it is the fluid. her water
[1:35:04] had broke and it had been uh for some
[1:35:06] hours now and I'll never forget that
[1:35:08] moment sitting in that hospital and or
[1:35:10] my wife's laying down and I'm standing
[1:35:12] next to her and we held hands and we
[1:35:14] just looked at one another and since we
[1:35:16] don't know where where we're going to go
[1:35:17] from here but we trust the Lord and I
[1:35:20] just felt to to text some of my my my
[1:35:22] brothers and sisters ac across the
[1:35:24] message and just say would you please
[1:35:26] pray for us and that the will of God be
[1:35:28] done. Amen. And so we begin to pray and
[1:35:31] after this prayer, we begin to get text
[1:35:33] message coming in about uh uh you know,
[1:35:36] God did something here and God did
[1:35:38] something there. And it's good to hear
[1:35:39] that, but we're still here in this
[1:35:42] situation.
[1:35:44] And they kept doing test after test and
[1:35:46] I don't know if it was two hours in and
[1:35:48] basically everything showed and and so
[1:35:50] they immediately turned from their
[1:35:53] sourness to it'll be all right. It'll be
[1:35:57] okay. there's no hope for the child. So,
[1:36:01] uh, you know, they changed their
[1:36:03] attitude towards us because in their
[1:36:05] mind that was all there was to
[1:36:08] it. I don't know what it's called, but
[1:36:10] she had gone beyond something. What do
[1:36:13] you call it? Okay. When she she looks at
[1:36:16] me like
[1:36:20] that, she'll remember
[1:36:23] later. Anyways, be gone gone beyond the
[1:36:26] point where there was no hope that the
[1:36:27] child could not be born.
[1:36:30] What viable?
[1:36:32] Wasn't viable. Whatever that means, but
[1:36:34] I said that for y'all sisters to get the
[1:36:36] the the
[1:36:37] message and they changed their reaction.
[1:36:39] And so it had been come at such a point
[1:36:41] in time and then after all the testimony
[1:36:44] started coming in and the prayers began
[1:36:45] to come in, they came in and they did
[1:36:48] one last test. And of course, you know
[1:36:49] the ending of the story, but I'm just
[1:36:51] getting through it. And that one last
[1:36:53] test they did showed no
[1:36:56] signs of the fluid anymore. No signs.
[1:37:00] And they're like, "Well, that's very
[1:37:02] odd. We we need to come in there because
[1:37:04] there had been so much fluid lost that
[1:37:07] there's no there's not going to be any
[1:37:08] fluid around the child. So there's still
[1:37:11] no hope. So even though there's no I
[1:37:13] mean even though so they keep they go to
[1:37:15] the next problem. Even though there's no
[1:37:17] signs of it, there's not enough fluid in
[1:37:19] there to keep the child alive."
[1:37:21] Okay. So, they come in and they do a
[1:37:23] sonogram, right? Sonogram. And when they
[1:37:25] went in, they did the sonogram, there
[1:37:27] was not only was the the the the sack
[1:37:30] completely sealed, it was back filled up
[1:37:31] with all the fluid that was needed
[1:37:34] within the span of 30 minutes.
[1:37:40] And
[1:37:42] so, I told you two stories.
[1:37:46] Which one's greater than the other?
[1:37:51] They're exactly the same.
[1:37:56] I want that to sink in. We cannot raise
[1:37:58] one over the other. We We start We start
[1:38:02] uh uh looking at our testimonies and we
[1:38:04] start labeling testimonies and we start
[1:38:07] uh you know put them in one over the
[1:38:08] other and this one and this one. No,
[1:38:10] they're both the same cuz one we have a
[1:38:12] child. We already know where the child's
[1:38:14] at.
[1:38:15] And parents that haven't given up.
[1:38:18] Hallelujah. My daughter, though I'm
[1:38:21] thankful that she's with us, she has to
[1:38:23] face this devil and she has to face
[1:38:25] these things. Yes, I'm thankful for the
[1:38:28] miracle that she is with us. I would not
[1:38:29] trade not having daddy's little girl.
[1:38:34] But none are greater. They're all the
[1:38:36] same. So the miracles in this church,
[1:38:39] not there's not one greater or another.
[1:38:41] Young people, you there's no greater
[1:38:43] young person or littleer young person.
[1:38:45] Your testimony is no better or liter
[1:38:47] than anybody else. God has brought you
[1:38:50] on this earth for a reason to not be uh
[1:38:53] so uh uh uh discomforted by all that's
[1:38:56] going around you right now. If you can
[1:38:58] still hear me, if you're still with me,
[1:39:00] can you think of one thing that God's
[1:39:01] done for you? One thing that God has
[1:39:04] done for you,
[1:39:06] young people, can you think of one thing
[1:39:08] that God's done for you? It might be as
[1:39:10] simple as I ate today. Well, it's the
[1:39:13] grace of God that you did.
[1:39:15] Hallelujah. Let's go a little deeper
[1:39:18] than that. What else has he done for
[1:39:19] you? Think about that. I'm not I know
[1:39:22] there's silence here and that's that's
[1:39:24] taboo to have that silence and to think
[1:39:25] of questioning. But now I want you to
[1:39:27] think of this. Think of one thing that
[1:39:29] God has done for somebody else.
[1:39:32] Can you thank God just the same for that
[1:39:35] person that you can yourself?
[1:39:38] You see, he is the same yesterday,
[1:39:40] today, and forever. I don't want to
[1:39:42] choose Barabus over Jesus. This is the
[1:39:45] best picture that I could find in the
[1:39:46] sense of uh uh the just the face and and
[1:39:50] understanding how could we say no
[1:39:54] to him.
[1:39:56] What is worth saying no to him?
[1:40:01] There is nothing in this life that is
[1:40:02] worth it. There is no entertainment
[1:40:05] there. And I'm not I'm not against the
[1:40:07] right things. There's no friendship.
[1:40:10] There's no spouse. There's no nothing
[1:40:12] that is worth saying no to him.
[1:40:16] If you could close your eyes and your
[1:40:18] heart and you can see and you can see
[1:40:20] his arms are wide open and he was
[1:40:22] saying, "Would you just trust me
[1:40:24] tonight? Would you just drop all that
[1:40:26] you had? Listen, I might have not come
[1:40:28] in the way you had expected. I might not
[1:40:31] be relieving you of all of your
[1:40:32] problems, but if you'll just hold my
[1:40:34] hand, I'll take you through those
[1:40:36] problems." Barabbus is not worth it. He
[1:40:40] is not worth it. I want to take you
[1:40:42] through those problems. I want to take
[1:40:44] you through those questions of life.
[1:40:46] You're not alone in these things.
[1:40:50] How many people are choosing Barabus
[1:40:52] because it feels better when simply just
[1:40:56] saying, "Lord, I will." He said, "Take
[1:40:59] up your
[1:41:00] cross and follow me."
[1:41:04] Let's bow our heads. Musicians come.
[1:41:07] What is
[1:41:08] worth as his arms are wide open? Is
[1:41:12] financial gain worth it? Is better
[1:41:14] worldly friends worth it? Is better
[1:41:16] things worth it? Or is
[1:41:17] he worth it all?
[1:41:21] Amen. I I I know I was back and forth. I
[1:41:25] know being a young person service, I I
[1:41:28] hope that they could understand just a
[1:41:30] little
[1:41:31] bit. I don't want to get caught up. Even
[1:41:34] tonight, can I say that? Even tonight, I
[1:41:37] don't want to get caught up in a
[1:41:41] crowd situation. I want you to have your
[1:41:45] identity
[1:41:46] with God.
[1:41:48] You know who you are.
[1:41:52] What has he done for you? Well, Brother
[1:41:55] Jeremy, it's been tough. I'm not taking
[1:41:56] away the fact that it's been tough.
[1:41:58] Listen, I want to say there's been hard
[1:42:00] hard times for that young couple.
[1:42:04] for
[1:42:06] sure, but they're still standing.
[1:42:12] I could go testimony after testimony in
[1:42:14] my own life of the things that God did
[1:42:17] for me or for my
[1:42:19] wife. I could talk about things that
[1:42:22] happened happened in my church. I could
[1:42:24] do that and that's all fine. But I want
[1:42:28] you to look at your own life right now.
[1:42:30] I want you to get to your identity. Who
[1:42:32] you are in Christ. to what Christ has
[1:42:34] done for you and think on these
[1:42:37] things. Think on these things, young
[1:42:39] people. What is he doing for me? I I
[1:42:43] don't want you to just be a good boy or
[1:42:45] a good
[1:42:47] girl and look the part and act the part.
[1:42:51] Even now, you can find out who you are
[1:42:54] in him. What's your identity, young
[1:42:57] person? What's your identity? Who are
[1:43:01] you in your own heart? I just I'm just
[1:43:04] feeling this. Say your name in your own
[1:43:05] heart. You can even say it out. Say your
[1:43:07] name. My name's
[1:43:09] Jeremy. Say your
[1:43:12] name. Are you listening to me? Are you
[1:43:14] hearing it? Say your
[1:43:17] name. He knew that name before the
[1:43:20] foundation of the world.
[1:43:24] And he calls you by name.
[1:43:28] Now, I'm not putting you above him. I'm
[1:43:30] trying to tell you your
[1:43:32] identity. It is not your past. It is not
[1:43:35] your family's past. It's not the
[1:43:37] addictions of the past. Cuz addictions
[1:43:40] come to rob you of your
[1:43:46] character. I I can't get away from this.
[1:43:48] I'm sorry. Say your name
[1:43:50] again. You've heard a lot of
[1:43:53] things. You've heard a lot of things
[1:43:54] about that name. The enemy has been
[1:43:56] talking to you a lot about that name.
[1:43:58] You'll never be the same. Look at the
[1:44:00] battles that you're going through. And
[1:44:01] it's a hard battle and it's a hard
[1:44:03] struggle. But he I'm pointing to that
[1:44:06] face right there. It's the best thing I
[1:44:08] can do. He knows your
[1:44:12] name. Can you hear
[1:44:14] him saying your name?
[1:44:19] You've heard the enemy say a lot of
[1:44:20] things, but can you hear him say your
[1:44:22] name? Forget about the pastor and the
[1:44:23] hurt of tomorrow and all the things that
[1:44:25] we've got to go through. Please don't.
[1:44:27] We'll we'll be able to step. We're going
[1:44:28] to go outside these doors and we're
[1:44:30] going to go face those things. But just
[1:44:32] for a minute, let his presence come in.
[1:44:35] Can you hear your name?
[1:44:39] Hallelujah.
[1:44:44] Right
[1:44:45] here. Right
[1:44:47] here. He's seen the tears that you've
[1:44:49] cried. He's seen all of the heartaches
[1:44:51] of your life and all of the the
[1:44:53] difficulties and the struggles and the
[1:44:55] many times. Listen, we've all
[1:44:56] questioned, haven't we? I could look at
[1:44:58] all three of you young men right here
[1:45:00] and said, I'm didn't say you questioned
[1:45:01] the message, but I'm saying we've had
[1:45:03] questions in our heart and he knew the
[1:45:06] questions before you even asked him. And
[1:45:09] he had an
[1:45:12] answer. The answer is here tonight. Why
[1:45:16] are you looking for
[1:45:18] Barabus? Because Barabus has become the
[1:45:20] comfort
[1:45:23] zone. But
[1:45:25] listen, no matter how comfortable it may
[1:45:30] seem, call for him,
[1:45:35] Jesus. Now you've said your
[1:45:37] name. How about say his
[1:45:40] name?
[1:45:43] Jesus. Jesus.
[1:45:48] Something happens when you say his name.
[1:45:51] Amen. Jesus.
[1:45:54] Hallelujah. You see, you're to be you're
[1:45:56] married to that name.
[1:45:59] So, you cannot take your name away from
[1:46:01] his name. Come on, don't leave me now.
[1:46:05] You cannot take your name away from his.
[1:46:07] I am Mrs. Jesus
[1:46:10] and he called me by name. Listen, I
[1:46:13] heard what Ellie had to say. I asked all
[1:46:16] the questions. I've listened to the
[1:46:17] tapes and I've been riding that camel
[1:46:19] long enough. But he pointed me to my
[1:46:22] Jesus.
[1:46:24] And it's time for you tonight to get off
[1:46:26] of that camel and light into that tent
[1:46:29] and meet Jesus face to face.
[1:46:33] Say it one more time, but not in your
[1:46:35] heart. Say it with your voice. Jesus.
[1:46:38] There's something about that name.
[1:46:40] Jesus. all the all the devils in hell
[1:46:44] begin to shake. And I'm not working you
[1:46:46] up tonight. I'm telling you, it's a
[1:46:48] reality to know when you say the world
[1:46:50] can say that name all they want. But
[1:46:53] when you who are called by that name,
[1:46:56] say the name of Jesus, everything drops
[1:46:59] around it. Let's close the door for a
[1:47:02] moment. Let's get in behind the veil for
[1:47:04] a moment before we get into the world.
[1:47:07] Can you get behind the veil and come
[1:47:09] into that presence and just say his
[1:47:12] name? Jesus. Oh, I love you, Jesus. Oh,
[1:47:15] I thank you, Jesus. You are my
[1:47:17] everything. You're my all. What if he
[1:47:19] never did anything for you again? What
[1:47:22] if he never in a sense healed your body
[1:47:24] again? What if he never did anything?
[1:47:26] It's still enough that he called me by
[1:47:29] name. He pulled me out of the pits of my
[1:47:32] hell and said, "I'm going to place you
[1:47:35] in a in a position that you won't even
[1:47:37] understand." And it's not just me, but
[1:47:40] it's you as the elect lady. He has
[1:47:42] called you from that miry pit.
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:47] Don't go back to it.
[1:47:50] Hallelujah.
[1:47:51] I'd like everyone from the age of uh 21
[1:47:56] and down to stand. 21 and down to stand.
[1:48:04] You're not alone.
[1:48:08] You're not alone.
[1:48:11] I don't care what the world says. I
[1:48:13] don't care what religion says. You're
[1:48:15] not alone.
[1:48:18] Guys, you're not alone. Ladies, you're
[1:48:19] not
[1:48:22] alone. He knows you by name. Hallelujah.
[1:48:26] He hasn't forgotten you. Amen. Everyone
[1:48:29] else in this church that sees these who
[1:48:31] are standing,
[1:48:33] can you place it upon your heart? I will
[1:48:35] remember them in
[1:48:38] prayer. There's some hands raised and
[1:48:40] there's some hearts being raised. Will
[1:48:42] you remember them in prayer? See, you're
[1:48:44] not alone. I'm giving you the authority
[1:48:46] to turn around and look. I want you to
[1:48:48] look. There's hands that are being
[1:48:49] lifted. There's hands that are being
[1:48:50] lifted all around. They care for you.
[1:48:53] Listen. What is it? It's not them alone.
[1:48:55] It's Christ in them that's pulling for
[1:48:58] you. Somebody's got to finish this race.
[1:49:01] Somebody's got to take the baton. It
[1:49:03] might be this little guy on the right
[1:49:05] who probably doesn't understand a
[1:49:06] quarter of what I'm saying, but I'm okay
[1:49:08] with that. It may be him that'll finish
[1:49:11] this. It may be this guy, anybody here,
[1:49:13] that's going to finish this race. But
[1:49:15] who's going to finish it? Somebody's got
[1:49:18] to finish it. We're not going to be here
[1:49:20] forever.
[1:49:22] I want to go. Don't you? Amen. I want to
[1:49:25] get beyond this place now. Let's all
[1:49:26] stand together. None of us are alone.
[1:49:31] None of us are
[1:49:33] alone. He's here
[1:49:35] tonight. And I don't want to choose
[1:49:38] Barabus. Why choose
[1:49:40] him when the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:49:43] of Lords and the Prince of Peace is
[1:49:45] before us?
[1:49:47] Lord
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:49:51] Jesus. God, I I
[1:49:54] I I'm sorry, Lord. I feel so inadequate.
[1:49:58] Dear Lord, we feel inadequate. God, in
[1:50:03] this presence, Lord, what what can we
[1:50:05] do? Nothing without you.
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:09] Oh Lord, would you touch the hearts,
[1:50:11] Lord God, of these young children?
[1:50:14] Lord, I remember what it was like to be
[1:50:16] there and to not understand where I was
[1:50:19] coming or going.
[1:50:21] Sometimes if we're not careful, we
[1:50:23] overspiritualize everything and we're
[1:50:26] just trying to grow up, Lord. God, would
[1:50:28] you lead them? Would you help
[1:50:32] them? Oh, he's calling you tonight.
[1:50:36] Lord,
[1:50:37] if you're here tonight and you're a
[1:50:39] young person and you feel like you want
[1:50:41] to take a next step and you mean it from
[1:50:43] your heart, this is not herd mentality.
[1:50:45] Don't look at anyone else around you. In
[1:50:46] fact, close your eyes, bow your heads.
[1:50:49] This is not her
[1:50:52] mentality. But if in your heart you've
[1:50:54] been feeling a
[1:50:56] tug and you want to go further, you want
[1:50:59] to take that next
[1:51:00] step, I want you to just come and take a
[1:51:03] step of faith and come and stand up here
[1:51:06] tonight. Just stand before him and say,
[1:51:09] "Lord, I'm taking a step of faith. I
[1:51:12] don't even know where I'm going to go. I
[1:51:13] don't know what to do, but I need a
[1:51:15] closer walk with you." Maybe you need
[1:51:17] the Holy Spirit. Maybe you don't have it
[1:51:19] yet and there's been a pull in your
[1:51:21] heart and a pull in your life. Listen,
[1:51:24] it doesn't take five years to get
[1:51:26] it. One moment in the presence and he
[1:51:29] can come in and change you.
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:33] Anybody tonight?
[1:51:36] I want something more. I want to take
[1:51:39] that step. Come and stand before him.
[1:51:42] Don't be afraid about anyone around you.
[1:51:45] Listen to that still small voice in your
[1:51:47] heart.
[1:51:48] saying, "Will you will you take my hand?
[1:51:51] Will you break through that pride that
[1:51:54] everything's okay? Quit looking like the
[1:51:56] part. It's time to to take off that that
[1:51:59] the masks and be honest with yourself.
[1:52:03] Lord, I need
[1:52:06] you, Lord Jesus. Deal with the hearts
[1:52:09] tonight. I don't think you put this in
[1:52:10] my heart for no reason.
[1:52:13] Father, if there'd be one
[1:52:15] tonight that would heed that call, that
[1:52:18] would come
[1:52:19] forward. If there would be one, I know
[1:52:22] he's dealing with hearts. I don't know
[1:52:23] who, but I know he's dealing with hearts
[1:52:26] tonight. Don't put on a show. Don't put
[1:52:29] on an
[1:52:30] act. This is the moment where he is
[1:52:33] calling
[1:52:34] forth. Who will it
[1:52:37] be? Who is hearing that in their heart?
[1:52:40] That still small voice is saying, "Lord,
[1:52:42] I just need you. I'm not ashamed of the
[1:52:45] gospel. Who will it be
[1:52:48] tonight? Father God, you see our our
[1:52:51] sister who has come. Father, those that
[1:52:53] are hands are raised, Lord Jesus.
[1:52:54] Another
[1:52:55] one, don't be ashamed of it. Even now,
[1:52:59] the enemy comes. Even in these moments,
[1:53:01] he comes and he attacks your minds and
[1:53:04] and you begin to feel this uneasiness
[1:53:06] about you. I rebuke it in the name of
[1:53:08] Jesus. Would the peace that pass
[1:53:11] understanding begin to come into our
[1:53:13] sisters hearts? Father God, begin to
[1:53:16] deal with him. Don't be ashamed of it.
[1:53:18] Is there
[1:53:19] another? Is there another that'll come
[1:53:21] and say, "Lord, I need a touch from
[1:53:23] you." Now, I've called I've called these
[1:53:26] young people and I pray that they've
[1:53:28] made that the decision in their heart.
[1:53:30] You're doing it on your own, not because
[1:53:32] of others around you. You've come and
[1:53:34] you've taken that step.
[1:53:36] Now, would there be anyone else in this
[1:53:38] building tonight that's saying, "Father,
[1:53:39] I I have found myself being pulled a
[1:53:42] little bit to the side, and now I feel
[1:53:44] the tug at my heart, and I I want to
[1:53:46] become back balanced with your word." Or
[1:53:49] whatever it may be. There's something
[1:53:50] that you want to give. Just come and
[1:53:52] stand in the presence of the king. You
[1:53:55] say, "Well, he can do it right here."
[1:53:56] Absolutely. I believe in that. But God
[1:53:58] is asking for a step of faith tonight.
[1:54:01] And I have to be honest with that this
[1:54:03] evening. for those that have come and
[1:54:05] that have stood now. Sisters, brothers,
[1:54:13] in your heart,
[1:54:15] wherever you are, cuz I don't know where
[1:54:16] you are with him. Only he
[1:54:20] knows, the prayer and the desire and the
[1:54:22] burden of your
[1:54:24] heart. Do you believe that he can meet
[1:54:26] you right where you're standing?
[1:54:30] the ministers in this building
[1:54:32] tonight. I I just feel to go this route.
[1:54:34] If you want to just come
[1:54:37] forward, the ministers in this building,
[1:54:40] if you if you don't mind, just come
[1:54:41] forward and I want you to just you maybe
[1:54:44] not even have to lay your hands on them.
[1:54:46] Whatever you feel, but I want you to
[1:54:47] pray with
[1:54:48] them. Let them know that you're there
[1:54:51] because this is a unity, brothers, where
[1:54:54] we come together. This is a unity.
[1:54:57] Brother Samuel in the beginning said,
[1:54:59] "Whatever the Lord lays upon my heart,
[1:55:00] so I just feel this. This is not
[1:55:02] premeditated. Let's break through those
[1:55:04] chains. Let's pray with them together.
[1:55:08] You're not alone." Now, everyone else in
[1:55:10] the church, let's not let's not think
[1:55:12] that we're out of this. Let's bind
[1:55:14] together in a proper
[1:55:16] unity for what is happening in this
[1:55:19] building tonight. something at this
[1:55:21] moment as our as these brothers just go
[1:55:23] through and begin to pray with those
[1:55:24] that have stood forward. Whatever the
[1:55:26] Lord lays upon your
[1:55:28] heart, this moment matters more than
[1:55:32] anything else that is going
[1:55:34] on. They're all standing across this
[1:55:36] place. So, just go to each one as you
[1:55:38] feel led in your
[1:55:40] heart. Where is standing out there now
[1:55:43] in in the audience, if the Lord lays
[1:55:46] someone on your heart, standing up here,
[1:55:47] pray with them right where you're at.
[1:55:49] Lord, touch them. Let's not lose our
[1:55:52] burden for these young people. Let's not
[1:55:54] lose our burden for these uh uh for our
[1:55:57] fellow brothers and sisters. Let's push
[1:56:00] aside all the barriers. Let's push aside
[1:56:02] all the differences and see what God has
[1:56:05] in store for them.
[1:56:08] Do you love the Lord tonight? Now, let's
[1:56:10] show it with our compassion for these.
[1:56:12] Let's just sing this.
[1:56:15] I'd rather have Jesus. Is that what
[1:56:16] you're playing?
[1:56:18] I'd rather have Jesus. I'd rather
[1:56:23] have Jesus
[1:56:26] than
[1:56:28] silver or
[1:56:31] gold. I Oh, you know, I have him over
[1:56:34] anything else.
[1:56:36] Now, let his presence just move to this
[1:56:40] place. Fathers and
[1:56:42] mothers, reconsecrate your marriage.
[1:56:46] Stand together if you need to. Right
[1:56:48] where you're at, grab them by the hand.
[1:56:51] Say, "Lord, reconsecrate our marriage.
[1:56:54] Reconsecrate our
[1:56:56] homes. Lord, we want to be rededicated
[1:56:59] right where we're at. We want to draw
[1:57:01] closer to you. If we've let doubt creep
[1:57:04] into our homes, we give it back to you.
[1:57:06] Reconsecrate our
[1:57:09] relationships. Let's push beyond the
[1:57:11] things. Let's break down the walls and
[1:57:13] barriers tonight.
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:17] Hallelujah. Or be
[1:57:20] held in
[1:57:23] sin dread sway.
[1:57:27] [Music]
[1:57:30] I'd
[1:57:32] rather have
[1:57:35] Jesus
[1:57:38] than
[1:57:41] anything in this
[1:57:44] world. Oh, there's nothing in this world
[1:57:47] worth it, young
[1:57:48] people. Oh, just keep on singing that.
[1:57:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:54] I raus
[1:57:55] [Music]
[1:58:02] Jesus, you see these young people. You
[1:58:05] see their hearts, Lord. Lord, I pray
[1:58:08] that you would move in their lives.
[1:58:11] God, I know things are hard and there's
[1:58:13] difficulties in life. But God, may they
[1:58:16] find you tonight personally. May they go
[1:58:19] behind the veil themselves, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:22] Lord, not by because of their friends,
[1:58:25] Father, but because there's a call in
[1:58:26] their heart for more of you. Lord, I
[1:58:29] pray that you would draw them, Lord
[1:58:30] Jesus. Only you can do it tonight.
[1:58:34] Only you can do it tonight.
[1:58:36] [Music]

[2:09:50] Hallelujah. Can you magnify him when
[2:09:53] you're by yourself?
[2:09:57] Don't just make a promise you can't
[2:10:00] keep. I want to magnify you every day of
[2:10:03] my life. Lord, I want it to be more than
[2:10:06] a song. I want it to be more than just
[2:10:09] voices. You know what? I'm not going to
[2:10:11] miss this opportunity of us coming
[2:10:12] together in this unity right now. This
[2:10:14] is where we build our strength together.
[2:10:16] But I want to leave this place and I
[2:10:18] want to still magnify you, Lord.
[2:10:21] I want to know that those giants that
[2:10:23] are outside them doors that they have
[2:10:25] got nothing against the word of God. It
[2:10:28] wasn't David by himself. It was the word
[2:10:30] of God with David.
[2:10:34] I'm not trying to pump you up to think
[2:10:36] that you can do this all alone. You
[2:10:37] can't. You got to have God with you.
[2:10:40] You got to take that word with you.
[2:10:43] Don't just leave it here.
[2:10:46] I want to magnify you, Lord. I want to
[2:10:49] worship you, Lord. I want to give you my
[2:10:51] all, Lord. I want to go beyond who I am,
[2:10:55] Lord. I don't want to run and hide
[2:10:57] anymore. I don't want to isolate myself
[2:10:59] anymore.
[2:11:01] I need you, Jesus.
[2:11:04] With all of my
[2:11:05] heart, I need you.
[2:11:09] Perhaps maybe I know we might sing songs
[2:11:11] a little differently, so bear with me.
[2:11:14] Give me the key of F.
[2:11:18] Yeah, key of F,
[2:11:25] please. Why would I worry when giants
[2:11:29] come calling my
[2:11:35] name? My God is so much bigger than
[2:11:40] troubles I face.
[2:11:46] Oh, why would I hunger for power,
[2:11:50] riches, or
[2:11:53] faith? Hallelujah. Cuz my God is so much
[2:11:59] better than all of these
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:03] things. So I won't be
[2:12:09] shen. I won't be moved.
[2:12:13] Why? Cuz my God is
[2:12:17] faithful. It's right here. His promise
[2:12:21] is
[2:12:23] true. So I speak to the
[2:12:29] mountains. Oh, it's time to
[2:12:32] move. Hallelujah. Cuz my God is bigger,
[2:12:38] better, stronger, greater than
[2:12:43] you. Oh my enemies scatter cuz they know
[2:12:50] the battle is
[2:12:53] on. Hallelujah. Oh my God is stronger.
[2:12:59] The victory already won.
[2:13:04] Oh yes, he died for my ransom and rose
[2:13:10] up on the third
[2:13:13] day. Oh, can you say it now? Cuz my God
[2:13:18] is greater
[2:13:20] than hell and the
[2:13:24] grave. So I won't be shen.
[2:13:30] No, I won't be
[2:13:34] moved cuz my God is
[2:13:40] faithful. His promise is
[2:13:45] true. So I speak to the
[2:13:50] mountain. Oh, it's time to move. It's
[2:13:55] time to move. Because my God is bigger,
[2:13:59] better, stronger, greater than you.
[2:14:04] There's no
[2:14:06] mountain. Oh, and there's no mountain to
[2:14:10] hide. There's no valley to low. There's
[2:14:14] no fear that I had. He doesn't already
[2:14:18] know. There's no problem to make.
[2:14:21] There's no weapon too strong. There is
[2:14:24] nothing for God that's
[2:14:27] impossible. There's no mountain to high.
[2:14:31] There's no valley to low. There's no
[2:14:34] fear that I have. He doesn't already
[2:14:38] know. There's no problem to me. There's
[2:14:41] no weapon too strong. There is nothing
[2:14:44] for God that's impossible.
[2:14:51] So I won't be shen.
[2:14:56] Oh, I won't be
[2:15:00] moved. Oh my God is
[2:15:05] faithful. His promise is true. Come on.
[2:15:09] It's your promise tonight. So I'll speak
[2:15:13] to the
[2:15:16] mountain. Oh, it's time to move.
[2:15:20] It's time to move cuz my God is bigger,
[2:15:25] better, stronger, greater. One more
[2:15:31] time. My God is big.
[2:15:41] Hallelujah. Oh yes.
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:50] Hallelujah. Worship him tonight. Give
[2:15:52] the Lord a hand clap of praise. Lord, we
[2:15:55] love you. Lord, we thank
[2:15:59] you. Hallelujah.

[2:16:22] Brother Randy, I can't wait.
[2:16:24] I want to get over there and I want to
[2:16:27] worship him. I don't feel like I can do
[2:16:30] it right. It's not about emotion. I'm
[2:16:32] just talking about I just don't feel
[2:16:33] like I can thank him enough.
[2:16:36] What he did for me,
[2:16:38] what he brought me through, what he will
[2:16:41] bring me through.
[2:16:43] Don't give up. you don't give up. Don't
[2:16:45] throw in the
[2:16:46] towel. It'll be worth it all when we see
[2:16:50] Jesus. It'll be worth it all when we get
[2:16:52] beyond this flesh and we get to that
[2:16:55] place. Oh God, it'll be worth it all.
[2:16:59] Can you say that? Even so, come quickly,
[2:17:02] Lord Jesus. And it's not because of the
[2:17:05] problems or the trials. I just want to
[2:17:06] see your face. Hallelujah. I just want
[2:17:10] to see your face. I know this is
[2:17:13] different. And now I feel like I'm all
[2:17:14] over the board. Give me the key of F

[2:21:16] arms of Christ.

[2:25:43] Yes, I owe my every breath,
[2:25:50] Lord, for all that you have done.
[2:25:58] We owe our every breath to him.
[2:26:01] He's taken us through so much, brothers.
[2:26:02] I'm not trying to take your time. I'm
[2:26:04] fixing to turn into our brother. I love
[2:26:06] to worship, too.
[2:26:08] I love to thank him for what he's done
[2:26:11] and his his his
[2:26:14] everything that he's done for us. Amen.
[2:26:17] What could we say? How much time could
[2:26:19] we give him?
[2:26:21] I'm not just talking about tonight. I I
[2:26:23] get that. But every day of our life,
[2:26:26] God, even driving down the road, I want
[2:26:29] to worship you. If no music is playing,
[2:26:33] I want to worship you, Jesus. If
[2:26:36] everything's falling apart around us, I
[2:26:39] want to praise you.
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:26:42] Because of all you've done,
[2:26:46] God help us.
[2:26:49] God, help us. Do you love him tonight?
[2:26:52] Perhaps I'll sing one more as we turn it
[2:26:54] to our brother. I'm actually fighting on
[2:26:56] what to sing. So many different songs
[2:26:58] that's on my heart. I think I choose not
[2:27:01] to play the piano, though. I think I
[2:27:03] choose to maybe let you play for
[2:27:06] me. I'm blessed with a wonderful wife. I
[2:27:09] can thank the Lord for for her standing
[2:27:11] with me through all these
[2:27:13] times. You know, I like this
[2:27:17] song. You remember it's my desire. My
[2:27:25] desire. It's
[2:27:27] my desire.
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:33] to live
[2:27:36] for
[2:27:38] [Music]
[2:27:41] Jesus. It's
[2:27:43] my
[2:27:48] desire to be just like his.
[2:27:57] Though
[2:27:58] often I failed
[2:28:03] him and brought him much
[2:28:11] shame. It's
[2:28:14] my
[2:28:18] desire to
[2:28:21] live for him. Oh, here it is. This is
[2:28:26] true. If
[2:28:29] you could see where
[2:28:33] Jesus brought me
[2:28:36] from to where I am today.
[2:28:43] Oh, then you would know the reason
[2:28:49] why I love him.
[2:28:56] So now you can take all this world, its
[2:29:04] wealth and
[2:29:07] riches. I don't
[2:29:10] need earth's fame.
[2:29:13] It's my
[2:29:18] desire to
[2:29:21] live for
[2:29:26] him. Oh, it's
[2:29:29] my
[2:29:34] desire to help
[2:29:38] some today.
[2:29:41] [Music]
[2:29:43] Someone who may have
[2:29:49] failed failed to see the
[2:29:54] way. Here it
[2:29:56] is. For I too I too was once so lost.
[2:30:05] till I
[2:30:06] found my way back to
[2:30:11] God. So it's
[2:30:14] my
[2:30:19] desire to
[2:30:22] live for him. There's a reason behind
[2:30:26] it. Oh, if
[2:30:29] you could see where Jesus, he brought me
[2:30:37] from to where where I am today.
[2:30:43] Oh, then you would
[2:30:46] know the reason reason why I love him.
[2:30:55] So come on, you can take it now. Oh, you
[2:30:59] can take take this world, all its wealth
[2:31:05] and its
[2:31:08] riches. I don't
[2:31:10] need earth's fame.
[2:31:13] It's my
[2:31:19] desire to
[2:31:21] live for him. Can we sing that whole
[2:31:25] chorus one more time? Do it together
[2:31:26] now. If
[2:31:29] you could see where
[2:31:33] Jesus brought us
[2:31:37] from to
[2:31:39] where we are
[2:31:42] today. Oh, then you will
[2:31:46] know the reason reason why I love him
[2:31:53] so.
[2:31:57] Oh, now you can take take this world,
[2:32:03] all its wealth and its
[2:32:07] riches. I don't
[2:32:10] need her fame. It's
[2:32:14] my
[2:32:19] desire. Oh, it's
[2:32:21] my desire.
[2:32:26] Oh, sing it now. It's
[2:32:29] my
[2:32:34] desire to
[2:32:36] live for
[2:32:42] him. Hallelujah. It's our desire, Lord.
[2:32:46] We give it all, Lord, to you
[2:32:49] tonight. Hallelujah.
[2:32:52] I want to say God bless you from my
[2:32:53] heart as we're turn it to brother Samuel
[2:32:56] and young people. I I I hope you heard
[2:32:59] just something tonight. Just little.
[2:33:02] Don't follow everyone else. Keep your
[2:33:05] identity in Christ.
[2:33:08] He'll always get you through.
[2:33:11] How easy it can become one day
[2:33:14] worshiping and the next day crying
[2:33:16] crucified. Stay firm on the word and
[2:33:18] he'll get you through it. I love you
[2:33:20] with all of my heart. I may never see
[2:33:21] you again, but I'll see you here, but
[2:33:23] I'll see you over there. Can you say the
[2:33:26] same thing? We're going to see each
[2:33:27] other on the other side. Let's make it,
[2:33:29] brothers and sisters. Let's do it. God
[2:33:31] bless you. That I want to say this, too.
[2:33:34] Thank you, brother Nathaniel, and all of
[2:33:36] those that have come and and supported
[2:33:38] and in and this our brother. And it's
[2:33:41] good to see the unity of the faith.
[2:33:43] We're here for one thing, and that's for
[2:33:45] Christ. Amen. God bless each and every
[2:33:47] one of you. Amen.
[2:33:49] God bless you. I appreciate
[2:33:52] you. Thank you, brother. Thank you.
[2:33:59] Take that, devil.
[2:34:02] I said, "Take that, devil." Hallelujah.
[2:34:06] Aren't you glad you pressed through all
[2:34:08] the tiredness and the weariness?
[2:34:11] Amen. And see what God has done right
[2:34:14] here among us tonight.
[2:34:17] You know, I think it was in in my own
[2:34:20] life and I think last week when I was
[2:34:21] ministering here on Sunday of the things
[2:34:24] that were that even how God started in
[2:34:26] my life. I was 19 years old when the
[2:34:29] Lord got a hold of my life. I'm sure
[2:34:32] there's a lot of bumps in the road.
[2:34:33] There was a lot of things, but but I
[2:34:35] tell you, it all starts from a decision
[2:34:38] and just letting the Lord just take over
[2:34:40] your life. Just let him be the Lord of
[2:34:42] your life. Just every day, Lord, just
[2:34:45] come deeper. just come deeper. Just come
[2:34:47] deeper. And you know the thing of it is
[2:34:49] is that you don't look for a feeling, a
[2:34:53] sensation, just him. He's the one that's
[2:34:57] tuck tugged on your heart. And brother
[2:34:59] Jeremy said this over and over. And
[2:35:02] there's a little statement that's made
[2:35:03] and a lot of people have claimed that
[2:35:06] they're the author of it, but Google
[2:35:09] says otherwise. Not like Google's an
[2:35:11] authority, but comparison is the thief
[2:35:14] of joy.
[2:35:16] Don't ever compare yourself with someone
[2:35:18] else. Just compare yourself with the
[2:35:21] word. And you know what? How God has
[2:35:23] made you. The Bible said you were
[2:35:25] fearfully and wonderfully made.
[2:35:27] You know how I am in church. That's how
[2:35:30] I was on the football field. That that
[2:35:33] didn't change me. But there were other
[2:35:36] guys that I was with. They couldn't
[2:35:37] understand. They said, "Browning, why
[2:35:38] are you always running around and
[2:35:39] hugging everybody and and you didn't
[2:35:41] even make the tackle? Why in the world
[2:35:43] you running down the field after
[2:35:45] everything in the running back scored? I
[2:35:48] said, I'm happy. This is my team. This
[2:35:52] is how God made me. But God might have
[2:35:55] made you a little bit different, but
[2:35:56] it's no less.
[2:35:59] It's no less. We worship God in the way
[2:36:02] that he's made us. And it comes from our
[2:36:05] hearts. Don't you love him? Isn't he
[2:36:08] good?
[2:36:09] Oh, I tell you, I think about this
[2:36:11] service tonight and that's all I can say
[2:36:12] is take that devil.
[2:36:18] God is so good.
[2:36:20] Amen. And just keep pressing. Just keep
[2:36:22] taking the word of God. Amen. And just
[2:36:25] keep pressing on. Amen. Hallelujah. So
[2:36:29] thankful for Brother Jeremy and Sister
[2:36:30] Hannah for them
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:35] coming. Amen.
[2:36:43] Amen. We just so appreciate appreciate
[2:36:45] that. Appreciate the sacrifice they've
[2:36:47] made and to be here and we've just
[2:36:50] really enjoyed being able to get to know
[2:36:52] Brother Jeremy here over the last few
[2:36:53] years and Sister Hannah and I knew it'd
[2:36:55] be a blessing to us. And I I believe God
[2:36:59] has just just really done some really
[2:37:01] wonderful things in our lives this
[2:37:04] weekend, I tell you. And you know what
[2:37:08] the things that God has has done.
[2:37:11] Sometimes you don't always see the fruit
[2:37:13] immediately, but fruit itself will come
[2:37:17] from the word that's been received. Just
[2:37:20] taking that in and listen what God what
[2:37:23] God even God has done here tonight or
[2:37:25] maybe it was Sunday morning or maybe it
[2:37:27] was last night. You
[2:37:29] confess what he has done.
[2:37:33] You confess what he has done. And the
[2:37:36] prophet said, "When you confess what he
[2:37:38] has done, watch God make your body obey
[2:37:43] your confession."
[2:37:46] Because you're confessing on what he has
[2:37:48] done. Aren't you thankful that God sent
[2:37:51] this message
[2:37:53] not to reveal a man, but to reveal Jesus
[2:37:56] Christ
[2:37:58] to point out to you and I his desire for
[2:38:02] personal relationship?
[2:38:04] Amen. I could say this and young people
[2:38:07] would know it. He's been after your
[2:38:09] number for a long time. You know what?
[2:38:12] He's always known it. And today, right
[2:38:15] in the midst of all of this, he sent a
[2:38:18] personal text. Amen.
[2:38:22] Isn't God so good?
[2:38:24] God is so good. Don't ever let the enemy
[2:38:28] tell you that there's nothing that's
[2:38:30] taking place. He's a liar. He only wants
[2:38:33] to try to discourage you. You stand on
[2:38:36] what God what you know that God has
[2:38:38] touched your heart and what God has done
[2:38:40] and you have that resolution right here.
[2:38:42] I'm not going back out here the same way
[2:38:44] I come in. It's not mind over matter.
[2:38:46] I'm taking God at his word.
[2:38:50] Amen. You believe that tonight? Amen.
[2:38:53] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts.
[2:38:57] Heavenly
[2:38:59] Father, Lord, once
[2:39:02] again we stand here to say thank
[2:39:05] you because Lord, we are so so
[2:39:09] appreciative of your grace moving by our
[2:39:11] way. Lord, so thankful how that you have
[2:39:15] moved to touch our
[2:39:17] hearts. Once again, I pray, Father, for
[2:39:21] each one.

[2:39:32] Lord, that Father, by your presence,
[2:39:34] Lord, just moving down that you would
[2:39:37] give them,

[2:39:41] want to be identified with you
[2:39:45] at all
[2:39:46] cost. I want to be identified with
[2:39:49] you. I want that relationship, Lord. I
[2:39:53] want you to be the
[2:39:55] complete and sole
[2:39:58] influence of my life. Lord, I pray, dear
[2:40:03] God, grant every desire, those that
[2:40:05] were, Lord, right there in their seats.
[2:40:08] I know there was fathers, mothers,
[2:40:10] grandparents. There's others, Lord, that
[2:40:13] have come here with needs as well. I
[2:40:16] pray, Father, as we leave from here
[2:40:18] tonight,
[2:40:20] Lord God, as that song says, I'll take
[2:40:23] Jesus.
[2:40:25] Lord Jesus,
[2:40:29] that's our choice, Lord.
[2:40:31] It's you, Father, and you
[2:40:33] alone. Lord, through every course and
[2:40:36] decision of life, may we look for you.
[2:40:38] May these young people, may each one,
[2:40:40] Lord, look to see you in the choices
[2:40:44] they have before them. and always Lord
[2:40:46] to choose that which would Lord Jesus be
[2:40:50] a path that would lead them closer to
[2:40:52] you. Father, go with your children now,
[2:40:55] Lord. May you be with Brother Jeremy and
[2:40:58] Sister Hannah. Bless them, Lord. Bless
[2:41:00] the assembly there, Lord, in Amarillo,
[2:41:02] Texas. Lord, dear God, their fruits,
[2:41:05] their labors. It's so beautiful, Lord.
[2:41:07] The great bouquet of ministry that you
[2:41:09] have, Lord. How we thank you, Father,
[2:41:12] for all the uniqueness, the different
[2:41:15] the differentness, Lord, if we can say
[2:41:17] it in that way. I'm thankful for that,
[2:41:19] Father. you know what you were doing.
[2:41:23] And Lord, we just so appreciate, Lord,
[2:41:24] how you've come by this weekend. Lord,
