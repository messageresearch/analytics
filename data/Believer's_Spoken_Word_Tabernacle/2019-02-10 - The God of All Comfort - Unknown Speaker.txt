there was the Lord moving in that little girl's life sometimes it got moves with we don't watch out we missed guys doing so let's get ready for the word and I know he's behind me this thing he's my rock and my soul and my sword now get out of here help [Music] [Music] it's my room in the middle of the week [Music] bless you this morning you may be seated just for a few moments do they know what to do back there I want to just just show you a few of the of the pictures as well as of a need within the Philippines that the Lord willing we'll try to do what we can to attain that I also want to make mention to you that from last week just want to say in regards to the mission report today on the January mission offerings we would want to say thank you for an offering of 1031 dollars and we have been in contact with brother Tim Dodd from Cloverdale Bible a he's taking care of a lot of the things within Uganda as far as a lot of needs and the things I've mentioned to you from time to time brother Stephen a Bali who was here there is such a great need in that country right now for Bibles they just don't have Bibles and even clothing just it's a very very dire situation even with food and so forth but brother and Stephen in Bali I text brother Stephen we stay in contact and so he'll be following up with this and then I'll be able to share with you the things that will take place there the Lord willing so I wanted to say god bless you I want to just show you real quick we we raised in the mid well and the mission offering we took up an offering toward two boats and actually ended up being one and then another need was presented and I want to just show you where that where that's coming from we have here a boy that's terrible sorry I don't need to put my opinion up there but right here let me just mark this out - Liam island is is right over it's right over here this looks like a piece of land it's not it's a lake it's the lake inside and it's surrounded by the land and it's right out of Manila and you see it right here a little bit more clear it looks like a sword that Island and we came out of here this is where I ministered at in bras and I came out to the island here brother Jian had met me and we went there and that was with brother VIN and but the VIN does a lot of the mission work there along around the island and it's just simply he just was walking just walking and just going so then we were able to secure a boat and so this was his response to me and brother VIN it's really kind of cute because with the email part I don't think he understands it he writes me inside of the what it's all about line so I have to open up they're all about line and really expand it and get this but I wanted to share this with you how are you brother Samuel thank you for everything to support to buy this boat and now weekly we use for mission purposes god bless you all and you'll see brother VIN right here and brother Vince may be about this tall and there is his family and some of the other brothers going with him you see him once again and here's the boat that they were able to secure and they redid it and you'll see here in a moment it can't no I don't know if you can see that or not but you know what it says on the side right of Christ so they're able to use that that vessel and they've done a lot of a lot of work on that so the the other boat that we were able to help with and this is in allowing the Palau and islands in Philippines and this is located right right here and it's just when you zoom in on it's just the multitude of islands and just to try to get around there and brother oh L Roden says trust all is well with you as you read this thank you for helping the work in Palau an island the ministers of Thai Thai town and Pali on plowin are now raring to set sail and start evangelizing the near Islands in northern plowin area there are 30 some small islands in this region that we wish to reach with the message and now the Lord has gifted us with a vehicle to be able to do that palawan is also one of the richest fishing areas of the country and the boat will be a tremendous blessing to the believers of the four main churches that work together in this place and right here you can see this boat now this the difference with this as I believe with this boat they built this the brothers that were here were able then to take it in which it kind of kept costs down there and so they were able to to build that boat so they wanted to express their thinks in in helping with that right now there's just a need I received this from brother Roel there is a need in in tight I for the church building repair and brother Rowell wrote this and he says I also wanted to share with you the need to replace the wall of our church meaning the church that's there in in tight I'm not not brother oels but the church there in plowin we needed we helped build this church in 2010 and the wooden structure has been eaten by termites and the bamboo mesh walls are falling apart they are needing $600 to rehabilitate the building and hope you can help us again and here's a look at the building and brother oels church and then by God's grace they were able to help them to build that and so brother o is just he sent pictures of the building and so forth tell you what it kind of makes us ashamed of ourselves if we complain about what God's given us and so this is that's just the that's the end of it there's so we just want to lift you know towards that need if there's things that you were unprepared today or what have you that's it's fine you can still you know if something you pray about it and the Lord puts it on your heart and you want to give something next week as well that's fine we can get that going there too a brother or well and they'll and the brothers will get that there was another need that came up and I did put pictures on it and what it is it's it's one of the brothers that brother Dre and I will redid the first set of meetings when the when the property was surveyed it wasn't done properly so then the brother they already built the church building okay brother I think brother Chad lamb and those down at believers Christian Fellowship help them help brother lanlan build that building well now it comes out that some of the building is on a lot they don't whole so I'm asking you that you would just pray as well because you know it's just the enemy coming against also and I understand we want to be good business and good stewards and and some of you know you know you go into some of those other places you know brother keener like you think over in Taiwan and sometimes it's just not always the things are not done quite as sometimes efficiently and everything you know and so the brothers are very very good with things but it's just this situation happened and so it's they're kind of right now the ladies really the ladies really pushing them you know with for money and it's not money as far as bribery it's just with the money to trying to get the land and trying to secure that part so I haven't heard any more back from brother Rowell and I haven't emailed him anymore because he's asking us to come so I didn't want to respond to that email but brother Giri you know was there really looking for that right there to go and so we're just you keep that in prayer as well and in October they're asking us about that and I guess I'm kind of the the the person that I look at and say you know if you can't go send somebody I'll take the latter part I know he said but the same year week well you know I I just and I really mean that with all my heart I would stand behind anybody than any of the brothers is they feel led to go but I do love that love the people there I know we love them and and they wanted to extend that greeting to you so this morning we just want to lift the the mission offering this morning and just trust that the Lord will just richly bless you and like I said if there's something that I know we wasn't prepared for that but we have even through next week so if we could let's just bow our heads as the brothers would come for the lift of mission offering Lord Jesus we just want to say that we we love you Lord we thank your father's so much Lord for Calvary we thank you O God that reality Lord has spoke to our hearts that we are the reason Lord personally Lord it was not a wholesale affair but it was a personal personal offering Lord were thankful that you make it real to our hearts Lord we thank you for the testimonies thank you Father for the songs of worship thank you Father for your presence Lord thank you father for meeting the needs of your children or sometimes when we look upon these needs and we're not rich people Lord your God we just aren't we love you and Lord we think of that little song little is much when God is in it Lord you are still the one Lord who takes and multiplies more than enough so lord I pray for these needs we as a congregation we give our hearts together Lord and we just ask that you would just take Lord multiply and we pray that you would move on the heart of that Lord lady Lord who owns that property no doubt Lord she doesn't maybe understand Lord your God the way that she's looking at it Lord maybe Lord we would look at things on infringement on our property but God I pray that you would move on her heart and I ask Lord that you would help her to see and understand in it God created her heart Lord just filling it Lord with with grace Lord in this situation we pray that God you would guide and direct brother lanlan Lord father be with the saints of God throughout these places Lord in the tolima islands and the Palau and islands O God may you father ever be with the Lord that souls Lord that our evangelize for the kingdom of God for this is our desire Lord last one comes in we go home papa and we're longing for that day Oh God may you continue Lord to bless the work the translation work the books that are going out God brother in esto jr. Oh God strengthen our brother strengthen brother Ernesto as well Lord we thank you for your for mercy Oh God yes that you would just bless your word this service speak to us very personally Lord we

now your way let's just singing once again let's just let it be a personal prayer Lord have your way Lord have your way [Music] Holy Spirit feel of heart and have your way and as we weigh or with an expectation with faith and as we pray come speak your word intern and god bless you this morning it's certainly good to be with you and we want to just look into the word of the Lord here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and good to have some different ones back and I meant to say this last Sunday sister Patsy good to have you back amen our sisters really just been battling the sickness throughout the time and I know different ones and you know I thought about brother and sister keener they were back with us last week too and they came came back they weren't battling sickness but they know there was things they had to take care of clear over next to the Philippines and Taiwan and we're glad to have brother Claudio back with us too each and every one and you Drake Rebecca's good to see you here amen it's good to see each and every one in the house of God and we've got some that are missing this morning but we just hold them up in prayer someone some had some different commitments and so forth but we just want to turn our hearts and open to the word of the Lord remember next Sunday a fellowship dinner not this Sunday next Sunday this Sunday we'll have to find something else to eat but a fellowship dinner next next week so I just think God that we have a place that we can gather I really think God for that and have fellowship let's look in the word of the Lord here this morning in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 and we'll just read a few verses here Paul says blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforted us in all our tribulation I want you to look at this verse here let's just kind of you know kind of move it around in our mouth a little bit and just chew on a little bit who comforted us in all our tribulation so God didn't remove them from it but he gave them come in the midst of the tribulation now here's the reason that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God so Paul saying it's not our comfort that's being expressed it's the comfort that we've been comforted of the God of all comfort and then by that comfort we're able to comfort you wow it sounds like a body sounds like a body for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation that's comfort that's encouragement so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which which also we suffer for whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the suffering soul shall you be also of the consolation may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I wanna I'd like to speak to you this morning if the Lord would just help us hear the God of all comfort the God of all comfort and brother branham made this statement here and to think of this he says I'm so glad to know that he speaking of the Lord Jesus can be found amongst the brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us he stands bias when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he is still God and He loves us he was he was the expressing of God and all how I believed that he Long's and once you just let's just look at this here just very slowly oh how I believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit now watch the ice place needs to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the Living God he said all that well expressed what he said or the poet said living he loved me I want you to catch this this as he makes this the statement here that we would be so anointed with his spirit there's a lot of things that we can be anointed to do but the Prophet brings us to this into this place that he says oh how God is longing that we would be so anointed that we could go to each other you see it's one thing I can know maybe seems like maybe brother joy is going through something or another brother and under the sister it's one thing for me to know it but you see what brother bream says that we would be so anointed with the Spirit of God that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and we could give the expression of his sympathy well why don't God give it he is he's using you he's using you remember on the road to Damascus when Paul was taken off of the horse off of you know he says who are you Lord who are you he says I am Jesus whom thou persecutors you see the offering up of the body now the life coming back down into the very mystical body of Jesus Christ the attributes of God gathered together that which was a part of him his bride and now here Christ is being expressed through his bride and a reflection of that expression is that life itself what it did in the bridegroom this is also part of hitting on 16 cylinders it will also and must do the same thing in the bride he says it gives the expression that it would give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from a heart now you know I know it might be simple but these words mean something not as it trickles but as it pours so God let me be so filled up that it's able to pour you see you and I are priests believer priests we have a responsibility and that responsibility our walk with God as you would say that we were praying in the Holy Ghost building up your most holy faith and it's it is bringing it's just creating that reservoir because within our lives remember virtue goes out of the believers live and as we would go to one another and it don't necessarily mean just somebody everyone in the church but sometimes it's right in our home sometimes it's it's right there sometimes you pass it in in the workplace and you might come across a family member it might be someone who's not even walking in the same light that we're walking in that don't make a difference we still have sympathy now we'll get to that in a little bit but notice it pours from my heart that's really don't have to be primed a channel to express your sympathy notice remember what the Lord Jesus and you find this all the way through the Lord Jesus the ministry here and then it continues on through there of the Apostles a new commandment I give unto you that you love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another we believe in signs and miracles and they follow them that belief but I want you to think of this with all the signs and wonders that could follow a life if there's no love behind that and an expression then where where are the person or people's where are they being drawn to are you isn't me you remember signs and wonders you know bro Graham takes us there and we look you you read in the resume of the church ages and brother Branham just brings back you know in a very wide angle and he deals with the motive behind he said all those these ministries he said all kinds of results they're getting he said but what is the motivation behind what they're doing it's for self so it brings it back although all this is taking place but yet everything that's being done is herself so this is something that you know it's one thing for me to have a love for you and you to have a love for me but you see even though I have that in my heart and you have that in your heart how does one another how do we know that and even how does the world know that there's got to be such an expression like the Prophet spoke up in the message humble thyself when they came down there and when the church was starting there in Jeffersonville and they asked for the RAM how do you keep a people together so in love with one another and and things like that it wasn't that they didn't have troubles it wasn't that they didn't have times a disagreement but you see what was prevailing was is the love of God and that's what was it was a mystery to the people how do you do this and brother brems says it's not me he said the gospel is being preached but you see in that the gospel is being preached remember there's also the love of God that's coming forth the Holy Spirit it's moving in the hearts of the people oh my I think of how you know where the scripture says in Philippians chapter 2 verse 1 he says if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfil ye my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory no but don't don't set yourself apart but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves I won't ask but every one of us say lord help me every every moment friends pride is all around you realize sometimes you can be praying for God to change a certain person and it has nothing to do about that person it's all about what's bothering you that's selfish prayer that's pride it had none there it's like I don't want to be bothered no more with this God change them Lord help them Lord my brother my sister help them Lord God what it is here and you're not even entering in your you're actually praying Lord Oh God stop the pestering Lord I don't want to be pestered I don't want to be bothered with this anymore God says well you're not getting it so we keep rubbing and keep rubbing keep rubbing look up Paul goes on to say look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others you mean Paul had to speak this to believers yes you mean they weren't we oh they were wheat inside of kokuboro you see it's speaking this because in some of the in in different things they had to be admonished what were they being admonished it wasn't that Paul was putting something in but Paul was trying to get them to see you have to continue to die and yield that that life might flow through you and notice where the scripture you know there's a place in the scripture there where I didn't put this up but in acts 9:31 it says after when Paul himself here when God took ahold of Paul's life the Bible then says then had the churches rest through all Judea and Ganga and Galilee and Samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost and they were multiplied you see God knows just how to comfort us and this is what Paul is dealing with if there's any consolation in Christ if there's any encouragement if there's any comfort if everything and then Paul comes into it fulfill you my joy be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one of mine so when we when we look at this we come back even to the text and remember Paul is speaking the God of all comfort there's things notice if God is the God of all comfort then Satan also has a deception to that as well because real comfort it's real encouragement and real encouragement is that of truth in truth by truth for truth you see this this is where Paul could look at and say in this if you'll allow me to paraphrase that text we read what God has permitted and has he comforts us in our tribulations he does that that we in turned by that same comfort we might be able to comfort you when you're going through tests or trials and I think God for that I really do I think God for that so much because when I look around the course many times I'm in assembly and many of you know I've done this many times when sometimes there's things that one might be going through and I'm not talking about something so personal it might be something you know of a job situation or whatever more and there's things that would come back to my heart and remember this brother or this sister you know if it's a sister to sister a brother to brother they went through that exact thing somewhat similar hey you know what they're they're gonna be able to really get down and minister to them there's things that I can you know have an understanding and say brother sister we're praying for you my you know I try to consider that trying to look at but you take somebody who's been there in those shoes they not only can minister and help them but they're able to also really get in there and pray for him because this is a body first Corinthians 12 25 that there should be no schism no division in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another you know it's one thing for this statement to be here but you see God's desire that there be no schism so God will allow things to happen that causes us to have to break down walls now sometimes walls isn't about you having a difference with somebody sometimes walls themselves is you just getting over yourself me getting over myself what he was talking about going beyond our comfort did to see God has a way of that he has a way of that and you see listen friends everything in itself even when that's coming out of our life it's still God working and maturing on us to cause us to see it's him it's him that's doing the working we're just channels and you know what that does it brings forth the rest that's already in us and we in it it brings that rest to a greater reality and then you look at something that you or I could look at and say well this this expression and how this comes forth but what it does you want it no it's more than just the expression of this brother or the sister it opens us in the channel for God to continue to speak to us and lead us in his word that the members should have the same care one for another this phrase same care it means to take thought to take care for to look out for a thing to seek to promote one's interest a caring or providing for so it's the promoting of the interest of one another I think it's good that we get to know one another you with me it's just like when we had the testimony service here that night on Thursday night you know one of the statements that was made and we don't always know what someone's going through but you know there's others that might be closer to this person or whatever more that they were aware of it and they were entering in in prayer but one of the individuals you know made the common sense I didn't even know that brother so-and-so was going through that I didn't even know so what that did on that testimony service not only was it a blessing but it opened them up to what they already knew God is working but it opens them up to hey I need to be a little bit more in tune of what's going on and that don't mean walking around with a no plan and say brother ray what are you been going through this week are you suffering with a cold okay it's a head cold brother no that's not what it's talking about being sensitive doesn't necessarily mean you can always see it you sense it you don't see someone here sometimes I know when you those of you there sitting in the front things like yeah you didn't always see who's behind you and and things like that but sometimes when you don't see one another or you see something it's one of those things where it just moves on your heart check up on the person did I say that too strong let me say it stronger check up on the person what you don't have to say hey brother I this is a both Samuel Eto'o calling here is the interrogation list I want to know where you were on the night of 33rd no it's contact them and just say hey brother sister we missed you appreciate you because really the greatest thing we can do is pray for them we don't need to we really don't need to know the problem and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it and one member be honored all the members rejoice with it now you know the devil likes to get in all that stuff because when one member is honored then the devil has come as a pride you need to be elevating nobody but Jesus Christ you see you look how the devil will work the devil is always working to try to undermine the working of the Holy Spirit in the body of Jesus Christ do we need encouragement we do do we need discouragement we do let me let me let me speak on that for a moment when brother Branham takes us there in the Ephesian Church age he says we're Garn were in that Paul says that God is not quick to forget your work and labor of love and then he takes over in the Ephesian age of how he praises them and brother brems says we as husbands as pastors dads so forth couldn't learn a whole lot from this phrase on how to run our churches and how to run our homes he said and that is know when to encourage in the right things and the wind to discourage them in the wrong things I mean look if your wife makes something that doesn't appeal to you you don't sit there and say hey this was wonderful I mean this was good you just you respond say it was this good honey how did it feel no it's good she knows it's good it's it's palatable I've ate it but I'm not jumping off the ceiling so don't put it on the menu so without me saying I don't care for this I don't like this I there's just a way of going about it so when Paul speaks of this here when one member suffer all the members suffer with it not all of us are going to be able to identify with the exact suffering of what's taking place with maybe this person or this family or whatever more but sometimes it's where we are able to look at and say lord help them I mean lord I haven't been down that but I don't I don't even know how that would feel Lord but would you just help them Lord you see this is evident that there was a need for this to be reminded in the body and the body encouraged in this it was a need that they would be encouraged because sometimes it's our lack of awareness and yet the grace of God would have speak to us on the things that were to ask for in that wonderful sometimes you know for myself and and I say this this is just a it's not a strong point it's a weakness and whatever but you know sometimes I'm so focused on the that I overlook things that have great meaning sometimes you can be so focused on doing something that you fail to even express sympathy or empathy to a person hey brother Dave can you go on back there and do this instead of come up and saying hey god bless it's good to see you today how you doing can you help me out see that's that's a little different now you might look at that say all brother the same or that no it is needful sometimes it's things that God has you know what and God don't mind God don't look down at us and said your parents should have taught you that he's the ultimate parent and he had Paul spend all this time with throughout not just in Philippians not just in Ephesians not just in Colossians not just in Philippians not just in Philemon all the way through because why there is a part about us whether we've learned this or we didn't learn it or there's things that we need to be admonished in hey be a little bit more considerate when the church said help me Lord now it's evident that this needed to be prayed for Romans 15 5 now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus so to be like-minded toward one another that's I've been granted from God that's not just something oh that's just part of my natural makeup to a certain degree but when it overrides our comfort zones when it moves beyond just our natural abilities to look at a person's face to where it just moves in our heart and some about it we can't get that person off our heart or get this you see what that is that's granted by God for us to be like-minded not just for that one time but God is making known to you and I hey you're a priest here you're a believer priest you're to be sensitive you're a porter you've got certain things and charges that you're to watch over be mindful of this be sensitive this don't just get so occupied in your life be sensitive to my leading and we all need help I think we all could say Amen lord grant it to me Lord grant it to me keep Lord keep granting it to me Lord verse 6 goes on to say this is why that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ notice how Paul is dealing with this The effect of this granting of a prayer to be like-minded is something that actually brings unity oh my goodness you mean being considerate of one another and and praying for one another and I just don't mean oh yeah I'm praying for then no but I mean really what you're taking burdens upon your heart and not just when you're in your prayer closet but actually being the channel whereby God's as sympathy is actually expressed through your life such as walking up to the brother and say brother I love you I appreciate you brother and we mean it with all the hearts I don't need to know what necessarily they're going through it may not even be anything they're going through they don't have to be going through anything it's just something sometimes it just it grips my heart I don't know how it is just sometimes you know I come out of a service and my texts are flying around I just you know at different times or things throughout the week or different is certain things sometimes just Brittany and say hey I'm praying for hey I appreciate you hey I thank God for you and I mean that with all my heart because there's something about it there that ray something that's her Lord God I can't wait for us to get together again you don't have nothing to do with me preaching it is a love for his body his people 1st Thessalonians 4 9 as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for year your selves are ton of God to love one another now did Paul not write no Paul wrote about the love of God remember he would even write to the Galatians and say by love serve one another but what Paul is expressing here is that when this writing there is a teaching that has come forth when Christ Himself the love of God has entered into your soul by the new birth you have received of the love of God and you have had a personal teaching of God's love of how that you ought to love one another well how is that when you and I were unlovable he came he paid the price while we were yet sinners and he came and sought us up he actually cleaned us up there might have been some of us that had to go through you know certain stages a little longer and God was working with our life long-suffering yet the body of Jesus Christ the local body we were gathered with my they were long-suffering they were putting up with our immaturity and whatever more but the putting up with it is because they had confidence and with a God who was in their life that if they would pray that prayer and holding you up and encouraging you and supporting you that what God did in their God will do in you that is a work of the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ the Son of man inside of his body so this is the teaching Paul was speaking of first Thessalonians 14 Paul goes on to say for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in Macedonia so it's evident they not only loved them they expressed it but we beseech you brethren that she increase more and more suppose not taking anything from them such as you are not expressing the love of God but Paul said we're beseeching you we're encouraging you were admonishing by the Lord that you increase more and more so how could they increase more and more was it that they were going to go out and look for how many soup summers that they could set up and no it was that they themselves would put themselves in a place of being more sensitive to recognize that his body needs ministering to [Applause] first Peter 3:8 watch this finally be he all of one mind hmm you know this is kind of like when you're deciding on where you want to go eat at no my wife tells me nope mm-hmm cuz every time I decide you say no no I don't say she said what do you want honey she said because it's your stomach that matters you can tell that finally be of one mind and she know the right pick if I get to pick where we're going to eat hands down but you see when you look at that you're trying to in that now you got pretty boys in the car and they've got one and this one's calling this one one's calling this lord have mercy where we go but can you imagine now let's let's take it from that carnal natural example and noticing of how why would that be because Benjamin has a pilot for certain things Ben Zachary has a palate for fine delicacies of golden arches Paul has certain tastes for certain things you know Paul like steak Ben likes barbecue you know and my wife you know well gee you know she kind of likes the dainty you know half a sandwich and thimble of soup type places and things for me I like the places that have the salsa and the chips and the so you can see lord have mercy what a divided opinion that is there somehow somehow we're going to get to a restaurant brother keen or somehow but how we're gonna do it it's gonna require some compromise because we don't want to be sitting at that yeah Oh had those damn enrolled dinner rolls at the steakhouse that yeast met but no no no no no no big one mine to where that it's not something wrong why don't we go this way what but it's it's it's looking to the Lord and you know this is something that it's just us turning switches this is what Peter is expressing by the unction of the Holy Spirit then the people of God say lord help me to be of one mind and Lord teach me if there's places in my life where I'm lacking and I'm not moving together with the body finally Behe all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous this word compassion having compassion one of another it's having compassion one of another suffering or feeling the like with another sympathetic now if you notice it's a key point having compassion one of another this is not a one-way street but you might say that seemed like a one-way street I've expressed it to this I've expressed of this I've expected but remember your expression of love has nothing to do with what somebody will do back to you sometimes you realize that the expressions of love that are given out we do not give it to be recognized we do not give it so that all it will be given back to me we give it because the representation of the Holy Spirit in our life says pour out sympathy for my brother pour out sympathy for the sinner enter in for this right here and we are under his direction because we're not the high priests we are just the priests under the high priest hmm one of another so it's got to be reciprocated now sometimes when you look at it it might be one person or somebody they don't know how to reciprocate things back remember how brother Bram talked about when he saw the Pentecostals hugging one another on the floor grabbing one another you know what the back bill the RAM said I've never seen nothing like that in my life but brother Ram didn't look at it and say well I'm gonna be hugging nobody I ain't gonna know he began to recognize that and then he himself what after seeing that expression then brother ban and himself seemed the endearment of what that meant oh god help us love as brethren be pitiful this word pitiful means having strong vows having that residing within our hearts that's what this speaking of compassionate tender-hearted tender-hearted not calloused not hardened on though the cares of life and other things that come on then it works to try to harden you see if this is what God is asking and and this is beingin honest throughout the churches and the believers there then it shows that within that that if this is being am honest Satan is attacking that you know sometimes you can look at the message Christ the mystery of God revealed some three three-and-a-half hours long and you could say well let me speed up to where brother BAM starts reading the text in Luke 24 you miss what he's saying there because what he says before there when he gives direction to the church on about discipline and how we're to love one another if something stinky comes in a poison or whatever more you just yield and you hold yourself together unite with that pastor there you stay with the word you see well why is that that's not disconnected from the message you want to see Christ who is the mystery of God revealed and Satan knows friends when we've been born the Spirit of God he ain't gonna get us on doctrine he ain't gonna get us and running around in the world those things are gone brother sister but the thing that he'll work on is that all sticky carnal nature but girl repeated or greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world Paul goes on to say here's the ephesian church the sons of God remember those that brother brand would always say that Paul could speak and teach deep things this is deep be kind one to another oh Lord maybe he was talking to the Sunday School class no he was talking to the children of Abraham oh yeah oh yeah see we need to stay simple and be you kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you now notice how Paul would go on here in Ephesians 4 verse 14 seeing them that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the Son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need this phrase to be touched and the same of feeling it's to be affected with the same feeling as another to sympathize with to feel for have compassion or remember we read last week God himself in order to understand what temptation was in order to understand that as the Prophet said in order to justify man God Himself came down and he took upon the body his body his son which he created and he walked here and he lived in that body and redeemed you and I and as he redeemed you and I remember through the whole process of redemption and the journey he so subjected himself to where that he himself was actually able to feel temptation remember God cannot be tempted James 1 but remember Jesus was tempted you're saying Jesus wasn't gone well no he was cause but remember the body itself the body was not God but God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself are you with me it had to be a virgin body a virgin born body blood that was not of what was here on this earth in order to be able to redeem you and I back because it was blood that took us out it would be blood that would bring us back home so he in through the whole process think of this now if the resurrection of the Lord Jesus he does not leave the corporal body here but God takes his corporal body and there it is seated on the throne as a memorial you know that memorial is that just as he ascended you're ascending to just as he was raptured up you're going to be raptured - it is a witness that what he himself was able to prevail and move beyond all the atmospheres of evil that he himself through the new birth in our soul would actually bring us to a place of where he is father I would that they be with me where I I'm out and yet we're not there and yet were there when we have been born again of the Spirit of God we have been connected identified yoked with our theophany our representation in heavenly places that was always there and were identified and reflecting we have representation there so if this is our high priest he can be touched he a means he understands he understands Paul goes on and Paul expresses of how the field of believers saw this saw this and his need that he had Hebrews 1034 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your Goods knowing in yourselves that she have in heaven a better and enduring substance look how this was Paul so looking at what was the origin or the route as they caught and were able to minister that compassion they recognized there is a better enduring substance waiting on me that's what they were living by not notice you know as we've said these words here I think over the past a few weeks or what-have-you but you know there's a difference between sympathy and empathy we need both of them sympathy is when you can and you can actually enter in and say I've been there I've been through that somewhat just like that and then empathy is where maybe you have not been through that but you're able to enter in and say boy this is guy that's got to be rough that's just my lord that's just got to be rough you know with me here brother branham is talking about a situation has taken place where a lady she could not get off of her heart to go pray for this baby she couldn't get her off her heart she she kept on saying no that the sister is already here in a meeting but she's brother bands gonna no doubt the Holy Spirit oh called it out it it'll be healed then and she couldn't get off her heart brother Brent tells in another message he said she came up to the sister I love this she said sister she said would you mind she said if I would pray for your baby she said the Holy Spirit just keeps dealing with my heart said would you mind she said now sister she said I know you're here she said and you'll probably be on the platform she said you go ahead and go to that platform she said but will you just let me obey the Holy Spirit what he told me to do I hope you're with me it didn't say right here this is the prayer of faith you ain't gonna even need to go up that platform if that would have been the case there would have been nothing done you risked me it'd have been nothing done because it would have been through strife and vain glory you with Holy Spirit sensitive friends very sensitive now notice brother ram goes on and he's talking about what took place and it happened to be that this lady was about the third or fourth one in line the lady with the baby that was sick well the little mother up in the building you know up in the top she was so happy she said oh thank you Lord I'm so glad for that little mother that was on my heart so forth so so for that poor little sick baby when the little baby got in the prayer line and come up close to where we were standing where I was standing I looked at her that brother I said we got it on tape and he says I a Connor assets sister your baby is suffering with and yes I forget what it was some kind of a disease or trouble said you've come from a certain place and you are so-and-so miss a certain name and said but your baby is already healed said because the Holy Spirit spoke to that little lady standing up there in the balcony she's already prayed the prayer of faith for your baby you see it's just examples like this if you even look closely in the book of Acts you see the Ministry of the body of Jesus Christ it's just like that we have that ministry one to another we need the Christ in one another let me say that again we need the Christ in one another I'll tell you this right here I've witnessed many times things that I've had questions and I've prayed about and God would bring a minister not necessarily an older minister a younger minister and they would minister and right there whether they said it exact or weather was something the Holy Spirit just so inspired at that moment right there it open and my rejoicing had to do with God opened it to me now you know what I didn't care how old the person was or how young they was because I believe there's a gift in that life and the Holy Spirit who is the Ancient of Days is going to speak to my need it has nothing to do with the veil ho glory be to God the venoms let me read this next part the compassion of that mother for the baby would have went far beyond what I'd have had for it you catch that the compassion of that mother what was it she was a mother she had been a mother it's evident that within her life she had experience as a mother what it means when a baby is sick and it gripped your heart see the Holy Spirit it wasn't just her naturally looking upon somebody and trying to naturally fix it it was the Spirit of God listen to me the Spirit of God moved behind the experience that she had went through as a mother and you don't even know what kind of experience or experiences she'd been through maybe there were experiences where her baby was at the point of death maybe it wasn't experience where she lost her baby we don't know what it was but any rate the Holy Spirit was able to move in there and she was able to say dude you might have her proof for your baby what was that non earthly compassion it was the compassion she was so anointed with the Holy Ghost [Music] I'm gonna reading the rest of that but I'm gonna read that one again is that alright the compassion of that mother for the baby would have went far beyond what I'd have had for it so you see the gift of healing he said if God ever speaks to your heart to go pray for somebody this end just brother man this is from me to you you do you do what God tells you to do always follow the Holy Spirit listen I'm not a preacher but if you're born of the Spirit of God you are in the body and subject to any of the non spiritual gifts the probably said those gifts meal throughout the body it might be a one tonight and not on one tomorrow really many times here listen friends the gifts are working it's just that we don't always see them because the visible ones would be that of tongues and prophecy interpretation which are the least I appreciate them but I want you to understand sometimes when people say we want to see the gifts that gets already working even when you have been moved on your heart to call somebody texts about it send them a card do email whatever it is maybe it's the contact with them babies to say hey you think we can get to Cologne advert for a lunch hey you think we can get together for coffee or whatever more or something just in that manner do you realize it's a spirit of God working through your life glory to be the God you have been able to so surrender yourself and move so far away from the cares of life until the Lord Jesus can move right behind the experiences in your life and my life that he's comforting us in and then through that that comfort is able to pour out to others Colossians 3:12 put all therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved boughs of Mercy kindness humbleness of mine meekness long-suffering the joy this in just automatic he's telling put all that praise mean sink into the garment that is given to you do you realize you were ordained to be a priest of God you were ordained you are part of that family that he has redeemed but then when the Holy Spirit the great Road of God moves upon that seed on the inside it releases the coloration that he is the line the oxen and the Eagle it releases the Ministry of Christ through your life it is now a priestly garment and what does he say put off well don't already have it on we do but sink into it surrender submit [Music] this word vows it's a word that dudes derive from spleen you know what a spleen is a minister on that sometime ago a spleen is what cleans your blood and your blood cells if there are cells that are bad it takes them you don't let them pass through a certain opening because it can't fit through that opening so it has to go to the other opening it has to get broke down and remoted aren't you glad oh we've got a real spleen of God come on somebody we're cells themselves remember we don't want bruised sails bruised sails can start a cancer so having the spleen of God say lord help me to have that so active so active in you that it's arresting wrong thoughts when the devil tries to send this thought about your brother said no hi I'm taking that I know where that's coming from well you know how there's an ulcer I ain't taking that that maybe there might be certain things that bothered me like that but I am taking your word for it I haven't even taken your word for it you're out you're just right here you are to obey me are you with what's this here the Hebrews they regard this the bow as the seat of the tender affection especially kindness benevolence compassion hence our heart tender mercies affections a heart in which mercy resides and these mercies bowels of Merced have a have a reserve you know what it is to have a reserve of something it means it's there it's reserved it is awaiting display so you've got to keep filling it up right they had to keep on putting oil in the ball how did they put all in the bowl the oil was poured down from on high come on now coming down in through the main stem it comes down into the ball and then the branches are replaced from that so it's keeping the love of God in our heart Mercy's his bowels of mercies compassion pity mercy vows in which compassion resides a heart of compassion emotions longings manifestations of pity I don't know I don't know if you've ever read it but many times there's a many prayers I have that brother Neville prayed that brother Bram called him to pray there's many different prayers I just have them saved away they just bless me listen to this prayer brother Neville is asked to pray in the message father Denton different identifications of the true church if his prayer is in brackets brother Browns words are outside of the brackets father the great problems and the trials of tomorrow will seem us nothing as we're able to hold by hand and walk through a theme the events is truly Lord we pray Lord that that would give us a deep-seated compassion one for the other knowing that while one is in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing that week - one of these days shall go through like circumstances God give us the Spirit of Jesus in us till we fail for each of enough until there will be unity between us until we can serve thee together give us a deep-seated compassion you see what he's doing he's asking one grant that he would grant us to be this way lord help me Lord help me Lord God but then that deep-seated compassion would be within me Lord not just where I'm just concerned about me and thinking about me but it below you means such a deep seat of compassion that while one is in trial hardness of testing may we have that knowing that we ourselves too will go through some times what I found I'm just going to speak very plain sometimes what I found is sometimes the people who do not expressed expect the most why didn't they call me why don't they do this why not to do that you need to tell that devil get off my shoulder you are not running down my brother and my sister like that get out of here because they might have had something going on too maybe there was something you see what is giving them the benefit of a doubt it's keeping out malice it's keeping out all of those things instead of son oh lord please let the computer turn on because I don't want to pull something I don't want to always say sometimes people won't let in by nobody know their feelings out here they'll just put it on Facebook Oh Lord where'd this come from no just put it out there for everybody to see I'll tell you what Facebook itself is gonna be one of the greatest damn nations for people because there is an effect of your actions whether you say it here or you say with these are you with me yes we need to be very sensitive look the scripture said offenses will come you're going to be misunderstood I'm gonna be misunderstood and we have in but it's with standing with deep-seated compassion do you realize it's got to be something of a reserve operating in our life now right now you might not be having any difficulty or anything whatsoever and there might be nothing you're going through but yet within the midst of it it's actually staying right there in a constant fellowship with God to where you've got such a deep-seated compassion I'll tell your friends right now listen a person can say I'm praying I'm doing this and that brother Graham says if you're praying and you're rejecting the word you are not communion with the Holy Ghost you've been communing with Devils I'm gonna be very straight right now there's no way you can stand in the presence of God and accuse another brother or sister and in Mercy itself is being residing within your heart let me tell you something it's not looking and being critical of one another and of the body of Jesus Christ we've got to recognize these things what if I ever had a time of success of praying for anyone how many know there was success in the ministry brother banner he had member of the Graham said notice I said he had success he had more success in my ministry he had that didn't mean that God overrode brother Branham he's a channel if I ever had a time of success of praying for anyone is when I could enter into the fellowship with them feel their infirmities feel their conditions then something in you goes down beyond the reasoning and praise the prayer faith for the sick you've got a feel for a man you've got to sympathize with him you've got to be with him before you can help him you've got to be with him before you can help him what is this Redemption Redemption Redemption before you and I could be where we are in him he came to me then y'all but it's a me that's work I know it's work its work as a parent you with me brother Bantam all throughout you know the message and take the very beginning of the message indictment program starts out with there and he deals with the teenage children things and he said we must suffer with them you know sometimes you want to wring their necks sometimes you want but you must suffer with them because you know what really they do know it all I mean they don't know I mean you know you you have to suffer sometimes with them suffering means it's not always saying you know what be quiet you don't know what you're talking about well sounds like I've experienced something you with me these things are brother Ram deals with suffering sometimes suffering is where we're able to say wow because you can do more damage with this it's sometimes just to say Lord I need the greater is He that's within me to take a hold of this tongue that will set it on fire Lord's call calls it Lord and you let the Holy Spirit just put the bits in the mouth and throw a beat of God then you enter into some sort of a deepness not a mind you what I mentioned before I'll tell you what I think it's wonderful being a daddy being a parent it's it's wonderful you come through those transitions but it's also very reflective you're looking at how do I continue to win their heart Lord help me know when to speak and help me know what to say you with me they're going through their time and listen friends you and I have been through that time maybe some of you have been maybe some of you are whatever listen there's times even after we've been born again in the kingdom of God some of us have come to a place to over spiritual teenagers nobody can tell us nothing preach brother Samuel I will we know it all man I mean we were the lungs well you know we so there's you gotta suffer and thank God there were people who suffered with me and thank God you still are suffering with me but don't worry it's reciprocated I'm suffering with you too I love you then you enter into some sort of a deepness notice then you enter into some sort of a deepness it's the love of God it's beyond human love I mean know what I'm talking about when it comes down and you realize something has taken over something is here controlling me when I ought to feel like this or out to be like this or the Bulls coming where's the gun but then his presence takes over and to think brother BAM didn't say you dumb animal why no world you even come in after me they should have slaughtered you when you killed that man before Ronna if he'd have done that there wouldn't have been any more messages but what did he do he took that animal now notice that animal would not be able to extent understand his words it went like a dog that he had trained and that dog can kind of you know pick out the sounds and the tones no he hadn't been around that but what it was it was the atmosphere of the Creator that had moved down and was being expressed through those words I'm sorry I walked through your pasture I didn't mean to disturb you I'm sorry Oh God help me Lord Jesus help me the remm says I'm gonna tell you something you may clasp me a fanatic after this but I feel like I want to tell you something anyhow many things happen like that and frankly all my ministry has been wrapped around that one thing if I can love that or fall in sympathy with it in my ministry nothing next quote I've seen you I've been practically over the world several trips overseas seven or eight trips among the heathens and everywhere and I find this that the most forceful thing I can think of is love if I'm praying for a person if I can't have the feeling of that person upon my heart it never works so it wasn't just brother branham walking around and whoever I lay my hands on and I pray for or I take my hat off not even Nina lay my hands on if I just pray you know God's gonna come and back that up it was not so he had to enter in to the feeling once you think of this I just just through the testimony last night I would just listen to a little bit of brother Branham when brother Billy was out there around the fire they were preparing steaks and Sabine Yochanan and brother Branham walked over behind him and he knew Billy was real nervous and they're all tired up and he took off his hat he didn't say anything out loud but he just prayed for him when he got over brother Branham got around with the people that the brothers are there that day around the campfire and he was unlacing his boot while he was talking with the brothers and he told him he said you know he said I took off my hat he said some time ago he said when Billy was cooking them steaks he said because you don't know what he goes through in the meetings he said he's so tore up he's so nervous he said the things that he has to endure he said I just I asked God to let him have a good evening he said brother Branham kept on taking off his boots and finally got it off and brother Billy said his ankle was about that big around it was black and blue and he told the brothers he said you know he said this happened when I was hunting he said I tripped over a post he said now that's been back since October he said you know I've prayed for the God to heal that everyday so but it's got worse I heard I asked you did you hear me he said this gift is not for me it's for his people I prayed since October you know what this date this was brother Billy said it was February February I prayed and it got worse I wonder I wonder when I look at that right there I'll tell you I told my wife last night I said you know that speaks up it speaks not of the DNA of Branham it speaks of equality of the Lord Jesus Christ working in the heart of his people to where if he said how about that it had not permit a disease to come on you and I take you home would you be willing to do it would you be willing that your your heart would beat out as a testimony though he slay me yet I'll serve him would you be willing to be so anointed for that or we say Lord oh Lord I'm gonna prefer my brother wait a minute me that one right there Lord I hope you understanding me oh can I have just a little bit more time when I think no brother brems says if I can have the feeling of that person upon my heart if I can't it never works so evidently brother Joey he experienced never works right he's experienced where it's where it hasn't worked because if you know where it works then you also know when it doesn't work you've experienced it I won't ask you to raise your hands but we've been there when I think notice when I think what if I was standing in their place what if that was my baby what if that was my mother my wife my sister my brother when you feel that wave for them then something begins to move out compassion goes out and catches the patient and brings them back a frenzy said I know that God loves you now watch brother branham deals with this this chain of sympathy here let me read you this quote here now two out of out of the message blood Ram is talking about what took place on the day of Pentecost now when you look at this at what took place on the day of Pentecost there and you think about it here the same Holy Spirit that same life of our high priest moves down into Peter and the rest of a notice brother Bob said here they come about two or three days later he said in their coming among he said the man who's laying by the by the gate called beautiful and he said when Peter said silver and gold I don't have any but such as I have I give it to you take up your bed and walk brother M said the young man sprung up with a great big a man and he said what happened he said it was that chain of sympathy and when she catch this it was the chain of sympathy the compassion of him the Lord Jesus that said I had compassion on the sick that same spirit had taken place in the old fisherman's heart chain of sympathy yeah he's tied in to the mercy seat he's tied in to the high priest and so are you and I if we are born at the spirit of Almighty God we are part of that chain of sympathy so when you think of a chain of sympathy you know how many times you you think of it in in the midst of of a service how many times brother Branham tell us in a service where he said there were demons that would be calling that one to another right he talked about how he said when one was called out here he would also know there was somebody out there suffering with that same thing because n demons would try to communicate with one another in order to strengthen against what God was wanting to do and they were trying to build a chain of unbelief but then at the same time when there were believers in there that kept on entering in and then when those out there were entering in then what you found was a wall of faith that was beginning to build among the people and when that wall of faith would begin to build then God would come and move brother mem says it like this in Jesus Christ the same he said now we're strangers to one another and you believe the Holy Spirit is here now what I have dear sister I have to feel for you you know it has to be something that I sympathize with you he says there's too much of this cold odd Christianity today dried and cut you've got to feel for the people well brother Samuel they need to get right maybe you are the channel that the sympathy can pass through to reach their heart oh they may not turn around after one time two times three times this month next month but you are anchored in a chain of sympathy knowing all it takes is one touch Wow because you has a priest or a witness of that and there is vows of mercy hmm so to think of this here and brother BAM deals with there's too much cold out Christianity you know that's a spirit that's promised for this last day without natural affection without feeling not without it whatsoever and so to look at this now we can deal with that a lot but I want you to think of it like this here you are and here we are setting in a service like this brother Doug and in the midst of a service while the word is coming forth and to think of it as that word is coming forth there might be things brother Joey that maybe it's not what you're particularly going through at that time and it might be thing brother ray that you are gods already brought you through but yet within it you might be sitting there and you're looking at this thing and brother Brian you look at and said that channel right there I'm gonna pull somebody in here has a need I know I've got needs and I know that right here we're here and I'm gonna pull on the gift of God I am going to submit myself to the flow of the Holy Ghost there are needs to be met in this service you know what you're doing you are creating a wall of faith it's not about how they know that yeah I can finish that quote yeah I know it scripture come that it ain't about that this is not a recital this is where we come to worship the Living God that he moves among us and meets and ministers for the needs of his children and to think that we can so unite ourselves together it may be something we maybe were praying about something brother Joey and his son we've got in our heart and we've come here and we're expecting God to answer I mean we're expecting and maybe the way that service is directed it may not you may look at that text say huh it don't look like it's gonna come my way today but you know what I know that God is able to pass my way because was a kiyose it looked like he was going to go the other way when he walked with the two on the road to Emmaus it made as though he would keep on going but I know he's still God he knows my need and in the midst of that time maybe has the service unfolds it don't seem like anything's coming down your pathway but you recognize as a priest of God it ain't about you you submit yourself and say come on man of God preached Holy Spirit visit us move among this congregation Lord speak to the needs of your children Lord God you might walk out of here and your need wasn't met but you're so blessed you mean God would do that yeah he would see whether are we over our selves because we're priests after all huh think about how brother Brandt would talk about that greatest battle ever fought he said think he said if they're going to get people in one Accord there won't be one feeble one in the building in the next five minutes he said anyone would be one person desiring the Holy Ghost of what they would receive it do you see how the enemy is working it's even in that place friends of that compassion of where we enter into the word y'all still with me where we're entering into that of the word and allowing the Holy Spirit to move a chain of sympathy I know I asked you a little bit before but can I have a little bit more thank you brother Doug I want to read this to you because when we're dealing with this sympathy and empathy it deals with it that it's more than just us looking around in our local assembly however that is also a great problem because sometimes I find where people just live everything is else out where remember there is one great big body of Jesus Christ around the world many little outposts and within every local body that local body is just like your family unit but your family unit is a part of other family units that's just like the body of Jesus Christ obviously you're gonna be more aware and in tune with what's going on in your home then you are with what's going on elsewhere that's how it is in a local body that's the blessing but the Rev says you have people who love you and pray for you how can they pray for me for maybe some need that I've got over in Africa unless I contact him and say brother Steven would you pray for him brother Samson would you pray for me brother Timothy would you unless I contact him they're not gonna know but you see you know who knows you Yuda God has placed you here in my life to help me however there are times when maybe another situation has taken place maybe in another another assembly brother Andy or or some something has taken place is like what they can place at their church over there where we can actually enter in and reach out and help out when I ask brother any is there anything we can do to help you or anything at all you can reach in and pray when they had that pipe bust you know I'm talking about when you have those things it's like that you see it may not be well that's not part of my similar but they're part of the body of Jesus Christ come on church it's a body of Jesus Christ now watch this in a personal experience with God I feel it's necessary for me to read this to you Bill Graham said this great evangelist it's on the field today perhaps wouldn't agree with me on divine healing our lovely brother Billy Graham but the other day when I was listening to a radio program coming across the nation I heard that he was in Germany in the hospital or something sick with a kidney block I could not help but stop right there feeling the sympathetic feeling for our brother women he disagrees with you yes but he's my brother the sympathy they don't believe it maybe he don't see the same light you do but he's my brother feeling the sympathetic feeling for our brother and had prayer for God to deliver him and as the days went on in his service I heard he was better so he's paying attention I heard he was better how you feeling now brother joy I feel better I heard he was better and back in the service again God is using our brother in a great and mighty way of getting people saved and we sure appreciate him and I would ask all Christians to pray for our brother as we see the hand of God with him saving the loss now I pray that God will deliver him completely I hear that he's still feeling pretty bad so I pray that God will completely deliver our brother so he can preach the gospel what's this he reaches a type of people that perhaps wouldn't even come to listen to me in the message warning before judgment brother Brent says there's three messages of the hour he said there's a message that Billy Graham is caring of repentance he said there's also the message he said of divine healing and gifts that Oral Roberts is preaching and catching but there is the message of the hour that is for the bride of Jesus Christ the elect of God listen friends it is and we look down on anybody else that we don't have that attitude if you do you need to say God get that away from my life because it ought to be grateful hey if somebody can't see the light that we can see I can shout with them on salvation I can shout with them on justification I can shout with them on sanctification because why I know it it's God's mercy think about it what if there hadn't been a Billy Graham what if there wasn't in all Roberts it's God's mercy remember what lot said down there and Sodom thou hast multiplied by mercy to me O God I'm coming down Philippians 3:10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death paul said before the Fellowship of his suffering bearing persecutions with him you know paul he he was a man who had suffered with christ and when that slave talking about Philemon when that slave over there had run away I like that Paul had borne so much persecutions so many things of Christ I hope you with me are y'all still with me or would you rather me just close he had borne so much persecutions it's one thing going through it it's another thing bearing it I may say lord help me bear it help me God that Lord if I complain and we do complain sometimes help me real quick lord help me to remember it's for my good you know Paul had to Rick recognized to do that to glory in his infirmities he said that the power of Christ may rest upon me you know what that is the power of Christ that's the tent of God that's what that phrase means the power of God that in my his tent his tabernacle is abode my rest I've learned to do what glory in my infirmities not run around and said Lord God I'm sick no batting yet that's ignorant but it's just say Lord you're faithful you're so good listen you can hardly get around a month ago you were having to hold you hold your leg back here and preach just stand up but huh he's he's good his faithfulness and his goodness to have nothing to do with it that I'm in pain it has everything to do with who he is you understand this is what glory in infirmities even though in Furman's these things it comes against us and man it really tries to take a toll on our life it wants to make us feel this sometimes you know when you don't feel good you become more irritable and the church said Amen and become more short but then in the midst of it when something can raise within you say Lord you're so good you might be crying and your tears may not beating but because of what you're thinking about it might be the pain you're in what you're saying Lord you're good just hear the power of the power of Christ or the joy he just puts the tent down and says let's have a meeting it just puts that tent down right there and there's a meeting going on right inside the little room I mean the tent Oh Lord could the third pole be that simple it is setting his tent upon our lives Paul had borne so much persecutions so many things of Christ to win that runaway slave runaway Paul said and he wrote back to his master after the slave had been converted he said don't treat him as a slave anymore treat him as a brother said if he owes you anything charge it to me when I come I'll pay you he had been solid fellowship with Christ in his sufferings till he know what it was to be an outcast he said do you know what it is to be an outcast okay so he knowed what it was to fellowship in his suffering so he knowed how to sympathize my father's it's just clothes I can't go any further were the persecutions were the testings were the trying's were they easy no they're not easy for you and me you could look at things this brother or this sister but really remember trials trials are not oopss oops the predestinated appointments for the molding of our character and in the molding of our character for the jury it brings more sympathy more empathy out of our lives it helps us you know by the way we want to be sensitive to people but sometimes what it is is that God knows how to bring about tender-hearted miss sometimes we could sit down and say hey you need to be more tender-hearted but God says I know how to tender you aren't you glad glad he's let those things happen for you and for me the test the trials that you've been through for me the comfort that God has come and ministered to you that you might minister that same comfort to me I'll say lord help me to be a faithful Channel help me Lord to bear the persecutions the tests the trials help me Lord to receive your comfort you know you know how it is sometimes there's things sometimes you just don't know what to say to somebody I just be honest we the same as a pastor no one I don't I don't I don't go into anything I have a thought of what almost say unless there's something God puts on my heart and says here let's tell them this most of time it's done I don't buy the same and sometimes do you walk away and don't say anything yeah sometimes I just say it's listen cuz you know what the Lord knows what's needed sometimes people just need somebody to listen to him sometimes they don't need an answer they just need somebody to listen and as you're listening from the bowels of Mercy for the David's it's pouring out there's an atmosphere being created like was in that pasture where the bull is that where the bees were buzzing there's an atmosphere because you and I'm going to the Spirit of God our amateur creators and when we projected love think about this brother Chris when we projected love but the brand says it like this he says when love has been projected and it's come to the end of itself and it can do no more Sovereign Grace steps in and takes control and produces what love has called for Oh God I just feel so challenged I've felt challenged for weeks and months or a month and looking at this but the joy in his presence I'm more challenged I'm more challenging I want more the love of goddess who feel God help me to be more sense help me Lord help me not to get let to overlook but to be mindful of it I know for you or from me it may not be that we're we've got a text or call over by the church but what I'm just let the whole thing I believe the Holy Spirit is telling us be sensitive and recognize that there are things that God has brought you through that only the compassion that the Holy Spirit will take a hold of in your life can actually pray the prayer of faith for someone else don't you let Satan put your your position down you are a believer priest you hear me you're a believer priest you're part of a royal priesthood there's things that you have went through experiences it has not been for naught but it's been so that the Holy Spirit can move down and then move behind that experience and reach out to somebody else I think God for the body of Jesus Christ I think God for the Holy Ghost I thank God for sensitive arts is in Lord if there's any callus about Samuel rub it down Lord I don't want to be calloused I don't want to let things go unnoticed working on me lord help me to be tender hearted in the midst of a world that the whole had miss fear is about me it's about this about the Lord your God greater is He that's in me let me sink into that garment Lord let me yield my life Lord put on put on therefore is the holy beloved elect of God Hypersport anybody else have a request like to go before the throne of our Heavenly Father maybe this morning you're here without the Lord in your life but you just would want to be remembered in prayer you say Lord remember me remember me brother say me when you put when you pray would you remember me that God would just continue to move on my heart he's a gentleman my brother and sister if you don't want today he's a gentleman he cares about you he lets you know his care for you he'll do for he'll do for you what mommy and poppy when it comes to the end of its way he goes beyond that cuz he's able to do something for your soul that mom and dad have prayed for he's able to do that let's just go to him in prayer would you do me a favor how about maybe it's a brother or a sister or a husband and wife or brother to brother sister sister

to sister or a husband and a wife or brother to brother if you got to move out of your seat go ahead go ahead and do that huh that'll be fine we'll we'll wait for that if you want you feel to go over here or somewhere you go ahead and do that would you and let's just let's let's pray together God is so good he's so good maybe brother Dave maybe brother Adams right back here hey brother Adam yeah right there let's pray Lord Jesus we're standing here old God has brothers and sisters of life precious faith no goodness no righteousness of our own we stand complete in you father your word has gripped our hearts Lord and we're asking Lord that father is Lord I stand here Lord with my brothers what god these hands that Lord that you've given to us Lord and you use as branches of the grape vine Lord God were asking from our hearts as believer priest together Lord we're asking that God that you would so move in a deeper measure in our life as Paul said that the god of patience and consolation that you would grant to us to be like-minded one of another Lord Father that we would yield and sink into that garment that we've been enshrouded with Lord God that same garment Lord that as your prophet called the chain of sympathy that unites us Lord God with our high priest the true atonement the mercy seat all Lord God I pray father Lord as your love would flow and move throughout our lives Lord we ask that you would help us to father further surrender Lord deepening Lord the love of God as your prophet called for it that we would be so anointed with your spirit Lord to where we would Lord God go to one another feeling for one another Lord expressing your sympathy as it pours from our hearts Lord God father to one another in testings in trials in sickness in suffering Lord we pray this morning Oh God that father your presence Lord when moving deeper forgive us Lord forgive us Lord when we have allowed Lord God the insensitivity to build not that we meant to Lord but of this life sometimes the cares of this life Lord but father we realize Lord the value the suffering that you permitted us and permit us to go through and you comfort us that with that same comfort we might comfort one another father I pray this morning your God that not only for those that are gathered in this visible audience but I pray father God for sister Stephanie Lord sister Betsy Lord there are others Lord God that father a part of that invisible audience a part of this local body a part of the great body of Jesus Christ I pray Heavenly Father that God that as they would have their hands lifted up Lord in their hearts open lord I pray that God may our hearts Lord becomes so anointed with the holy spirit Lord or God that the expression of love one to another Lord bind us together Lord God with cords of love that cannot be broken I think your father for my brothers and sisters I thank you lord I thank you Lord God we bless your wonderful name not if there be one here that doesn't know you but I pray God in this atmosphere when they can recognize this is more than something brought by human but it's the love of God that moves down and and would call to their heart and let them know that there's a better way that they don't have to live or even try to live that way but they can just give themselves to you and maybe in their heart right now lord it's just simply where they say Lord take me to the Lord I don't know how to walk the walk but Lord will you come and will you Lord God guide my footsteps Lord will you tender my heart Lord father the things that may be that in their heart they can know that they still love certain things but they would be mindful enough of your presence to say Lord would you just Lord move that love out of my life Oh God bet the love of god would move and he'll grow greater and push out Lord all the things of the world because Lord I want you Lord that atmosphere Lord that I sense Oh God I realize it's you it's the person of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the age of the Lord it's it's what I've been looking for it's what I've been craving for all my life it's just satisfying it's something about it it's not this building but it's your
