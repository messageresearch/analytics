[40:31] just going to
[40:32] just try to move right back in where we
[40:34] stopped last week in psalms
[40:37] and verse 14. if you don't mind i'm not
[40:40] going to read that
[40:41] that whole passage of scripture but i
[40:44] want to just begin at verse
[40:45] 14 and to
[40:49] to draw from there
[40:55] in psalms 80 and verse 14
[40:59] return we beseech thee oh god of host
[41:04] look down from heaven and behold
[41:08] and visit this vine and the vineyard
[41:11] which thy right hand hath planted and
[41:14] the branch that thou
[41:16] made it strong for thyself it is burned
[41:20] with fire
[41:21] it is cut down and they perish at the
[41:24] rebuke
[41:25] of thy countenance let thy hand be upon
[41:29] the man
[41:30] of thy right hand upon the son of man
[41:33] whom thou made is strong for thyself
[41:37] so will not we go back from thee
[41:41] quicken us and we will call upon thy
[41:43] name
[41:45] turn us again o lord god of hosts
[41:49] cause thy face to shine
[41:52] and we shall be saved
[41:55] amen may god bless you and bless the
[41:57] reading of the word as you're being
[42:00] seated
[42:07] we as we've been looking at this part
[42:10] and i want to just hit a few points
[42:14] that in review and i'm not going to
[42:15] labor on these points
[42:17] but just to where we've come from of
[42:19] even in last week
[42:22] and we've been looking at god god has an
[42:25] expectation
[42:26] for our lives we we
[42:30] many times we we we as we've talked
[42:32] about that we see
[42:33] many times we're expecting god i'm lord
[42:36] i'm expecting you to do this but
[42:38] remember god is also has an expectation
[42:41] for us
[42:42] that god has already he's done
[42:44] everything that needs to be done
[42:46] he has he has paid the price for
[42:49] everything
[42:50] and he is raised up and he's seated on
[42:53] the right hand
[42:54] of power and authority so everything
[42:57] all that whatever your need could be
[43:00] he's already provided for it
[43:03] and you know as you can look in the
[43:06] scriptures many times it says
[43:08] uh you know he was he was bruised for
[43:11] our iniquities and the chastisement of
[43:13] our peace was upon him and
[43:15] by his stripes we are healed and he goes
[43:17] on to say in psalms 103 that
[43:20] i'm the lord that healeth all thine
[43:22] diseases
[43:23] i'm glad he just didn't list them
[43:25] because then you'd have to have
[43:27] addendums to that or amending and
[43:29] everything else but
[43:30] god's got it covered don't matter what
[43:31] comes up it's covered under the awe
[43:35] all has got it covered is that right
[43:39] so we find that this expectation that
[43:42] god would have of our lives that
[43:44] is a desire that that our lives would
[43:46] bring forth
[43:47] fruit of of the lord that it would be
[43:51] an expression of his life working in
[43:54] us to bring out what he already has
[43:57] sown in our lives we can't do that of
[44:01] our own accord
[44:02] that takes the operation of the
[44:04] quickening power of god
[44:06] moving through that channel that seed of
[44:09] god that he placed within us to
[44:11] release every leaf every apple all that
[44:15] is in there
[44:16] it takes god to come and to release that
[44:19] through our lives and
[44:20] our part is yielding to him
[44:24] amen so we then we looked at the the the
[44:27] part
[44:28] that the ground itself because david is
[44:31] writing and
[44:32] calling back to memory of how that god
[44:35] brought this vine
[44:36] out of egypt and we recognize they were
[44:39] in egypt
[44:40] they were always the vine of god but it
[44:43] could never be expressed
[44:45] when they were in the wrong ground
[44:48] so we looked at that even last week on
[44:50] those two parts that
[44:52] you know the the even when it comes to
[44:54] the parable of the sower of the seed
[44:56] that there is
[44:57] ordained ground when god sends his word
[45:01] to a generation there is ordained ground
[45:04] that in the scripture
[45:06] god refers to that as good ground
[45:09] that that upon that good ground that
[45:11] here
[45:12] the word itself will find its place in
[45:15] that life now
[45:16] that good ground is that seed it's the
[45:19] choice soil
[45:20] for the word to come to it's it's as the
[45:24] prophet would call it in one place
[45:26] the womb and here it is of where that
[45:28] the spirit of god will come and
[45:30] raise that life up and begin to express
[45:33] through that life
[45:34] there is one part of a good ground but
[45:37] then there's also
[45:38] within when that ground itself and the
[45:40] life is pulsating within that
[45:42] it cannot pulsate within that without
[45:45] them being and dwelling within the good
[45:47] ground
[45:48] or the choice ground and that is in
[45:51] christ is that right for we are
[45:54] all baptized into one body by one spirit
[45:57] we don't join this
[45:59] we we don't come into a place that we
[46:01] learn enough to be a part of it that
[46:03] this is not what it is
[46:05] it is a sovereign work of the holy
[46:07] spirit that god
[46:08] drawing on your heart to bring you to
[46:11] the place that he has
[46:13] prepared for you where the very
[46:16] expression of
[46:17] who you are as a son and daughter of god
[46:20] can really be made manifest
[46:22] that can never be made manifest down in
[46:24] egypt you can never be manifest as a son
[46:26] and daughter of god
[46:28] while dwelling in the world and we're
[46:30] not just talking about outside of the
[46:32] church walls
[46:33] to dwell in the world is still to be
[46:35] under that first
[46:36] birth and allowing it to reign in your
[46:39] life
[46:39] that's still an egyptian bondage but the
[46:42] spirit of god comes to
[46:44] lead you out from under the taskmaster
[46:47] and oppression
[46:48] of sin into the glorious liberty
[46:52] in christ himself in the holy ghost that
[46:55] that life on the inside
[46:57] might begin to express what god always
[47:00] knew and thought about you that's an
[47:03] overcoming life
[47:04] and so then as we we look at this we see
[47:07] of how that
[47:08] david you know in expressing to god
[47:11] that you would find where israel would
[47:14] you know
[47:14] israel how that god would visit them and
[47:17] you know they would go astray and god
[47:19] would visit them and then they would
[47:21] come back and
[47:22] then they would go astray and then they
[47:24] would come back there was a
[47:25] call here there's something more that
[47:28] was needed and this is where in the
[47:29] channel we were
[47:30] starting to work with last week there
[47:32] was something more
[47:34] that was needed because they offered up
[47:37] the provided sacrifices of
[47:39] and as brother braham says the land of
[47:41] palestine was
[47:42] bathed in the blood of heifers and lambs
[47:45] and everything but you see
[47:47] that blood could only cover it can never
[47:50] fully deal with the sin question
[47:54] because that blood itself it could allow
[47:57] man to come into a place of fellowship
[47:59] with god but it was only
[48:01] a type of the fellowship that god
[48:04] desired to bring
[48:06] his children back into and that's in a
[48:08] fellowship
[48:09] that could only come through and by the
[48:12] blood
[48:12] of the lamb of god where the life within
[48:15] that blood cell
[48:16] could come back upon the worshipper and
[48:19] call
[48:20] them into a place of fellowship where
[48:22] they're not
[48:23] under condemnation where they actually
[48:26] there is in a place of of authority it's
[48:29] a place that they're not
[48:31] trying to hold on or if i can just do
[48:33] this
[48:34] it's different we're no longer under the
[48:36] strength of our first
[48:38] nature that first nature
[48:42] has a strength but this is why that that
[48:45] first nature
[48:46] has to die that strength has to perish
[48:50] in order that god's strength can come in
[48:53] and fully manifest itself in
[48:56] the power of the resurrection he doesn't
[48:59] raise up the old man
[49:01] he raises up that seed that son or
[49:04] daughter of god
[49:05] that's on the inside the same one who
[49:08] revealed himself to john
[49:09] i'm he who was dead and i'm alive
[49:12] forevermore
[49:13] you and i were dead in sin and
[49:15] trespasses
[49:16] but now that the holy ghost has come the
[49:18] quickening power
[49:20] to raise you up you can say i once was
[49:23] dead but now i am alive
[49:26] in christ
[49:28] [Applause]
[49:29] i've received a greater is he that is in
[49:32] me
[49:32] than he that's in the world something
[49:35] more
[49:35] was needed and then we looked into that
[49:38] part of the right
[49:40] conditions that were needed in the
[49:42] condition that god himself would
[49:44] would would would come and and return
[49:48] it there you know god will always come
[49:51] where he's invited and you know a hunger
[49:55] itself
[49:56] brother brown will talk about this and
[49:57] as believers and as you listen to the
[49:59] message and
[50:00] and and even in the scripture it says
[50:02] blessed are they who do
[50:04] hunger and thirst for righteousness you
[50:07] couldn't have a hunger
[50:08] unless there was already something to
[50:11] meet that hunger
[50:13] the bible said the deep call it to the
[50:14] deep at the noise of thy water spouts
[50:17] before there could ever be a hungering
[50:19] for god
[50:20] there was a god there to make himself
[50:23] real to you and i there was something
[50:26] about it that maybe you
[50:28] stumbled in as brother branham put it at
[50:30] a mission one night and you gave your
[50:32] life to god and there was a hungering
[50:33] there was a calling but
[50:35] yet within that there's something more
[50:37] you just couldn't be satisfied
[50:39] there's a hunger that god put in you
[50:42] and it's that hunger that was in you
[50:44] that would not allow you to get content
[50:47] or comfortable in any other place you
[50:50] were
[50:50] meant to live in christ
[50:54] you weren't meant and ordained for a
[50:56] church life that's not what you were
[50:59] meant for you were meant to be an
[51:01] expression
[51:03] of the living god in this hour in this
[51:06] generation
[51:07] you were meant to be god's advertisement
[51:10] in this hour that is still the same
[51:13] yesterday today and forever he still
[51:16] delivers he still heals the sick
[51:18] he still feels with the holy ghost he
[51:20] still breaks chains
[51:22] your life is an advertisement there's no
[51:25] greater
[51:26] advertisement than the power of god
[51:29] moving through your life
[51:32] it's the right conditions of a heart
[51:35] that's hungering
[51:36] and in desperation for god
[51:39] so when we come into this here this
[51:42] morning
[51:43] and i in psalms 80 verse 14
[51:46] here david here he is under inspiration
[51:50] now
[51:50] you you realize this as a bible reader
[51:53] david
[51:53] is under an inspiration this is a this
[51:56] is inspiration that is prophecy
[51:59] of even when israel themselves will come
[52:02] into their rightful position
[52:03] as the 144 thousand and you see that
[52:06] that'll break right in and
[52:08] the psalms and hosea all the way through
[52:10] the old
[52:11] the old testament and here david is
[52:13] calling for this place
[52:15] return we beseech thee oh god of host
[52:19] look down from heaven and behold and
[52:22] visit this vine now
[52:23] when you look at this return return
[52:28] return oh god it would seem as though
[52:32] that he is the one that's went away
[52:37] but god didn't drift
[52:40] god didn't drift away it was the people
[52:44] that drifted away is that right you see
[52:47] this is why that we must have a type
[52:50] host
[52:52] this is why that the baptism of the holy
[52:55] ghost
[52:56] is an absolute in your life paul would
[52:59] write
[53:00] of it an anchor of the soul that reaches
[53:03] within the veil why do you put an anchor
[53:06] on a boat
[53:08] not for decorations is that right
[53:11] you don't put it on there brother chad
[53:12] you don't put on there for decorations
[53:14] i've been out there with you guys you
[53:16] guys put put them anchored down
[53:18] and at times we can be fishing out there
[53:19] and all of a sudden where we thought
[53:21] we're on the shoreline like man
[53:22] i'll tell you what look at that ride
[53:24] there cedar point finally you start
[53:26] realizing
[53:27] hey where'd that ride go we were at a
[53:28] cedar point why
[53:30] it starts drifting without an anchor
[53:33] this is why there must come an anchor in
[53:36] a life
[53:37] because it anchors us in him we can
[53:40] drift only so far
[53:42] are you hearing me you can drift only so
[53:44] far
[53:45] that's why even at times in your life
[53:47] you can get cool
[53:49] as a believer you can only drift so far
[53:52] and god will pull back his presence
[53:56] he'll pull his presence back why because
[53:59] you and i were meant to live in his
[54:02] presence
[54:02] and there's something about a believer
[54:05] when there's just
[54:05] it can be everything else that's going
[54:08] right but when they don't have the
[54:10] presence of god in their life
[54:12] it's like everything's wrong because
[54:14] it's him
[54:15] that makes everything right
[54:18] [Applause]
[54:21] hallelujah glory be to god
[54:24] so when we look at this that it was not
[54:26] god that drifted
[54:28] they had drifted so you know a drift it
[54:30] can be so subtle as we were
[54:32] looking at that then you can begin to
[54:34] allow other things to
[54:35] begin to take preeminence or first place
[54:38] which we we recognize to backslide
[54:42] that's to get cool now don't draw back
[54:45] on that word
[54:46] because i want you to remember when we
[54:48] talk about backsliding
[54:49] we're talking about cooling off are you
[54:52] hearing me
[54:53] i'm not just talking about you know in
[54:55] and out and in and out because
[54:57] when we're looking at backsliding you
[54:59] know this is where as the prophet would
[55:01] he would take us in the scripture that
[55:03] the prayer of a righteous man availeth
[55:05] much and he would begin to speak of this
[55:07] he said now
[55:08] a righteous man is not a sinless man but
[55:11] he said a righteous man is one
[55:13] who confesses his wrong
[55:16] see stays in a place then think of it
[55:19] the prayer
[55:20] the prayer of a righteous man of the
[55:22] fervent prayer not just a prayer let me
[55:24] back there that was pressing on my heart
[55:26] a fervent prayer means a boiling up you
[55:29] know
[55:29] that of where it's a zeal of a passion
[55:32] how does a man stay in that kind of a
[55:35] state
[55:36] because there is a place of cleansing
[55:40] where you can stay clean and refreshed
[55:44] and you can wash and you can bathe in
[55:47] the washing
[55:48] of water by the word
[55:51] hey you know how easy it is to
[55:53] accumulate things clean out your car
[55:54] one time right
[55:58] clean out your basement one time or your
[56:00] other room or whatever one time or your
[56:02] drawer sister's in your kitchen that's
[56:04] just your catch-all drawer
[56:05] look how fast that those things can pile
[56:08] up over time
[56:08] i'll just put this here i'll just put
[56:10] this here things can pile up
[56:12] awful quickly is that right
[56:16] and you see so then this is where there
[56:18] must be
[56:19] a continual cleansing let me say this
[56:21] friends this is something that's
[56:22] personal to you and i
[56:24] just coming to church won't do it
[56:29] you see it just coming coming the house
[56:31] of god is very important but you've got
[56:32] to live and you've got to stay in that
[56:34] presence
[56:35] that's what jude said building yourself
[56:38] up in your most holy faith
[56:40] faith praying in the holy ghost keeping
[56:42] yourselves in the love of god let me
[56:44] just tell you like this
[56:45] it's a battle to live there every day
[56:51] because this flesh is under there's a
[56:54] there is an anointing and a spirit
[56:56] upon this age and the spirit upon this
[56:59] age
[56:59] is not just a spirit only for people's
[57:02] rights
[57:02] but it's a spirit that's on the last day
[57:05] that is a spirit that seeks
[57:07] for soft easy living
[57:11] think about it what kind of an age are
[57:13] we in most neurotic age there is
[57:15] the prophet would say it like this he
[57:17] says it's an age
[57:18] that is unfit for humans to live
[57:21] in thank god there's a place
[57:27] that we can go to and let off the
[57:30] pressure
[57:34] hallelujah there's a place that we can
[57:36] dwell
[57:37] and we can come into that place and look
[57:40] to god
[57:41] and ask the lord and you know as brother
[57:43] bran would put it he said
[57:45] this is where he said if paul had to die
[57:48] daily then so must we die
[57:52] daily we have to repent daily i'm not
[57:55] looking for things to repent for
[57:58] are you with me you see i'm not just
[58:01] running and saying
[58:02] oh god forgive me and not well i don't
[58:05] even know what i'm asking for
[58:06] we recognize that there are things day
[58:09] in
[58:09] and day out that i'm not talking about
[58:11] willful sin
[58:12] if there's still willful sin you need to
[58:14] get your soul under the blood
[58:17] come on friends this is the truth this
[58:19] is the gospel of the hour
[58:21] if the desire of sin is still there you
[58:23] need to get down at the altar and stay
[58:25] there
[58:25] until that desire is quenched in your
[58:28] life
[58:29] don't baby it don't pet it don't make
[58:31] excuses for it
[58:32] let him come down and kill it
[58:36] that's exactly right see and then in
[58:40] that spot
[58:40] this is where we live then in the
[58:42] presence of god
[58:44] inviting his presence to wash our lives
[58:47] to dress our lives to tend to our lives
[58:57] oh my lord jesus help me so it's
[59:00] constant that we have
[59:02] to live in the presence of almighty god
[59:05] you see
[59:05] this is where in the book of hosea how
[59:08] god
[59:08] would say in hosea i will go and return
[59:11] to my place
[59:13] till they acknowledge their offense and
[59:16] seek
[59:16] my face in their affliction they will
[59:20] seek me
[59:21] early so god's departure
[59:24] is a lifting of his presence the
[59:27] scripture
[59:28] also says grieve not the holy spirit of
[59:31] god
[59:31] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[59:34] your redemption
[59:36] is that right so when we begin to look
[59:38] at these of how
[59:39] that the drifting and things would begin
[59:42] to move aside from there
[59:44] brethren would take this even in the
[59:46] ephesian age and you know
[59:47] let me just say it like this if as paul
[59:50] would write
[59:50] under inspiration it would show in the
[59:53] scriptures where he would talk about
[59:55] that a good soldier does not entangle
[59:58] himself
[59:59] with the cares or the affairs of this
[1:00:02] life
[1:00:02] that he might please him who hath called
[1:00:05] him
[1:00:06] and once again that is a battle to stay
[1:00:09] cut free from things that would like to
[1:00:12] wrap around your life
[1:00:13] and keep you grounded
[1:00:17] are you with me it's things you know
[1:00:19] that how that the enemy would like to
[1:00:21] come in that way
[1:00:22] good people sometimes with good
[1:00:25] intentions can get tangled up
[1:00:28] are you with me so we're not here you
[1:00:30] know with our head up and our nose up so
[1:00:32] we can catch a bucket of water this
[1:00:34] morning
[1:00:34] we recognize we need the grace of god
[1:00:37] the discernment of the holy ghost in our
[1:00:40] life
[1:00:42] we don't want to walk by our own
[1:00:44] intellects our own reasonings our own
[1:00:45] thoughts on things
[1:00:46] we need the discernment of the holy
[1:00:49] ghost we're living in an
[1:00:50] hour where there are things that are
[1:00:52] called good that are
[1:00:54] absolutely evil
[1:00:57] this is one of the most deceptive age
[1:01:00] since
[1:01:00] that of the garden of eden come on now
[1:01:03] we're things that's
[1:01:04] looked at and presented as though this
[1:01:06] is good and this is okay
[1:01:08] but it's filled with death is that right
[1:01:12] now you see what begins to happen you
[1:01:14] know brother brown takes it in this
[1:01:16] manner and he'll talk about how
[1:01:18] that the fervent desire to please god
[1:01:21] a fervent desire in other words that you
[1:01:24] care
[1:01:24] what god cares about you care what he
[1:01:28] thinks about things
[1:01:30] come on it ain't fillers out here and
[1:01:32] what does brother so and so and what the
[1:01:34] sister so and so
[1:01:35] you might be talking to somebody that's
[1:01:36] really backslide and you might be trying
[1:01:39] to ask what they think about it
[1:01:40] you can have a firsthand audience with
[1:01:43] almighty god
[1:01:46] if you really want to please him you go
[1:01:48] to him
[1:01:49] and you can ask him lord what do you
[1:01:51] think about this
[1:01:55] because when it's all said and done if
[1:01:57] that life goes off that way and you
[1:01:59] follow it god is not going to excuse you
[1:02:01] for following them
[1:02:02] when the right way has been set before
[1:02:04] you
[1:02:07] it's funny sometimes how spirits they
[1:02:09] will want to align like it isn't brother
[1:02:11] ram talked about in the service you
[1:02:13] could take an epileptic demon
[1:02:14] it'll begin to call for another call for
[1:02:16] another what's it trying to do
[1:02:18] bring reinforcements
[1:02:21] brother we don't want to align with
[1:02:23] spirits of this world
[1:02:25] we want our souls our lives to be
[1:02:28] aligned with the spirit of the living
[1:02:30] god
[1:02:31] oh my the passion brother bram talks
[1:02:33] about the passion to know
[1:02:35] his word i'm going to ask you to raise
[1:02:38] your hand
[1:02:38] but when's the last time you prayed for
[1:02:40] god to reveal himself to you
[1:02:43] you see when you can look back at that
[1:02:45] and say well my you know it's been some
[1:02:47] time
[1:02:47] it's there's there's a waning of the
[1:02:49] passion
[1:02:50] a passion you know somebody that's
[1:02:52] passionate about something you don't
[1:02:53] have to ask them
[1:02:56] get around them for a little bit you'll
[1:02:59] know what they're passionate about
[1:03:02] is that right it comes out their life is
[1:03:05] all wrapped up into it
[1:03:07] this is god's desires that you and i
[1:03:09] would be
[1:03:10] passionate in serving him
[1:03:13] it's a life filled with passion
[1:03:16] amen for his word oh and brother bram
[1:03:19] said the cry
[1:03:20] for reaching out in the spirit is all
[1:03:24] but gone becomes a less watchful
[1:03:27] attitude now let me let me move on here
[1:03:30] you see
[1:03:31] when david would begin to speak call for
[1:03:34] this return
[1:03:35] oh god i want you to look at three
[1:03:37] scriptures here that are in this passage
[1:03:39] right here
[1:03:40] you see there they're going to invite
[1:03:42] him
[1:03:43] return return we beseech thee o lord of
[1:03:46] hosts
[1:03:47] o god of host now notice in verse 3 of
[1:03:50] psalms 80
[1:03:51] turn us again o god and cause thy face
[1:03:54] to shine
[1:03:55] and we shall be saved go down to verse
[1:03:59] seven
[1:04:00] same words except in the middle o god
[1:04:03] of hosts in verse 19 the last verse
[1:04:07] turn us again o lord god of host
[1:04:10] it is what it is the condescension of
[1:04:13] elohim he who dwell alone
[1:04:15] now god of hosts with the angels and
[1:04:18] with his children and
[1:04:19] now come down in flesh in the flesh not
[1:04:22] just in jesus christ but
[1:04:24] in the flesh and tabernacling in his
[1:04:27] sons and daughters of god
[1:04:29] this is the accident this is the spirit
[1:04:31] of god
[1:04:32] that is calling out in david david here
[1:04:35] a man that did not live in a time that
[1:04:38] you and i live in
[1:04:40] he did not experience the redemptive
[1:04:43] power
[1:04:43] of the holy ghost like you and i
[1:04:45] experienced it
[1:04:46] david said i've heard thy word in my
[1:04:49] heart that i might not sin against thee
[1:04:51] but david never received the water of
[1:04:53] life that the word would become a
[1:04:55] reality
[1:04:56] in his life but still he was in contact
[1:05:00] and inspiration with god that his life
[1:05:03] could be in such
[1:05:04] harmony that it would recognize this is
[1:05:07] the very
[1:05:08] desire of almighty god
[1:05:11] oh my cause thy face you see this
[1:05:15] is one thing turn us again
[1:05:18] turn us again cause thy face to shine
[1:05:22] it it comes to this place but unless
[1:05:25] god moves
[1:05:30] the bible says except the lord build the
[1:05:32] house david labor
[1:05:34] labor in vain
[1:05:37] there there are many many that even in
[1:05:40] looking at the scripture
[1:05:42] to be fulfilled scriptures even of this
[1:05:44] age
[1:05:45] and we've spoke a little bit about this
[1:05:48] that you find that
[1:05:49] even before it happened the same way
[1:05:51] before the lord jesus as well
[1:05:52] you had men rise up and claim to be the
[1:05:54] messiah and led people off into the
[1:05:56] wilderness
[1:05:57] that was only a distraction that was
[1:06:01] trying to take away
[1:06:02] from the real that would come is that
[1:06:05] right
[1:06:06] it's the same way with the ministry that
[1:06:08] god promised and has sent
[1:06:10] in this hour the ministry of malachi 4.
[1:06:13] this is why you had
[1:06:14] all those who rose up before of elijah's
[1:06:16] mantle and elijah's robe and
[1:06:18] this and that and alexander dowey and
[1:06:21] all the rest of them you see
[1:06:22] there there were many of them that were
[1:06:24] were good people they were good men
[1:06:26] but the thing of it is when we're
[1:06:28] looking at a promise of god
[1:06:30] it's also to have patience for jesus
[1:06:33] said
[1:06:34] in patience ye possess ye
[1:06:37] your souls
[1:06:40] so a patience is not you know just
[1:06:42] wandering around and
[1:06:44] you know well lord you just tapped me on
[1:06:45] the shoulder you know sometimes you've
[1:06:47] been waiting on somebody to show up at
[1:06:48] your house and
[1:06:49] you just tell your wife hey you know
[1:06:50] what text me when they get here
[1:06:54] right just text me when they get here
[1:06:56] call me when they get here right because
[1:06:57] they're not on time you don't know where
[1:06:59] they're at there might be a few other
[1:07:00] things that you want to do
[1:07:02] jesus doesn't work that way
[1:07:05] are you with me this is an hour to be
[1:07:07] watching
[1:07:08] and waiting the bible said be
[1:07:11] ready for you know not what hour that
[1:07:14] the son of man
[1:07:15] cometh so the patience is not
[1:07:18] wandering around but the patience is
[1:07:21] locked in
[1:07:22] steadfast and waiting on god to fulfill
[1:07:25] his promise and in the meantime allowing
[1:07:28] the word
[1:07:29] to prepare us for the word that we're
[1:07:32] waiting on
[1:07:35] glory be to god you see the word holds
[1:07:37] the preparation
[1:07:38] for our life this is why david could
[1:07:41] write turn us
[1:07:42] again he realized we we in ourselves we
[1:07:45] cannot
[1:07:45] turn ourselves you realize for you to
[1:07:48] repent
[1:07:49] it wasn't that something it was a good
[1:07:50] idea that struck your life
[1:07:52] the bible says the goodness of god
[1:07:54] leadeth to repentance
[1:07:57] is that right it takes the spirit of god
[1:08:00] dealing with the heart
[1:08:01] dealing with the life to begin to turn
[1:08:03] that life around it's the same thing it
[1:08:05] takes the spirit of god
[1:08:07] bringing conviction in our life to
[1:08:09] convict us
[1:08:10] of where we are wrong where we are
[1:08:12] falling short
[1:08:13] and then to help us to see this is the
[1:08:16] place that i have for you
[1:08:18] and here is the pathway to that place
[1:08:22] and that's every service
[1:08:25] amen that's every service cause thy face
[1:08:29] to shine so we need him to shine
[1:08:32] in the fulfillment of his word because
[1:08:35] when he shines
[1:08:36] it is the fulfillment of his word so god
[1:08:39] god is expressing through david turn us
[1:08:42] again so
[1:08:43] it's going back it's it's thinking back
[1:08:45] it going back to how that god's
[1:08:48] god's desire where he would move among
[1:08:50] them
[1:08:51] in his power you see it was not a mighty
[1:08:54] hand
[1:08:54] of man that brought him out of egypt
[1:08:58] it was the mighty hand of god amen
[1:09:01] hallelujah it was god's power that moved
[1:09:05] down
[1:09:05] in his word and the people caught it
[1:09:09] and they recognized it so it's to
[1:09:12] remember
[1:09:13] remembering back you know this is why
[1:09:15] let me just say this to you
[1:09:16] this is why the hour that we're living
[1:09:19] in when god
[1:09:20] would tell the ephesian age that first
[1:09:22] church age that was already a fallen
[1:09:24] woman
[1:09:25] remember from whence thou art fallen
[1:09:31] go back in your mind go back to the time
[1:09:34] of
[1:09:34] of where of purity going back in your
[1:09:36] mind where
[1:09:37] there was a real consecration and and
[1:09:39] look from where you drifted
[1:09:41] how many knows that's not comfortable
[1:09:43] when you have to sit there and look
[1:09:44] and you have to first of all acknowledge
[1:09:46] there's been a little drift
[1:09:50] now listen to me now don't don't don't
[1:09:52] don't tuck your head between your knees
[1:09:54] and oh
[1:09:54] poor me poor me that ain't repentance
[1:09:58] come on now it's part of responsibility
[1:10:00] it's like i tell my boys at home don't
[1:10:02] hang your head
[1:10:03] you own it you own it you take
[1:10:05] responsibility for it
[1:10:07] be a man
[1:10:10] come on now don't be passing the buck on
[1:10:12] somebody else and if this
[1:10:13] no own it it's responsibility
[1:10:17] is that right you see part of that then
[1:10:20] we look at how
[1:10:21] that they drifted from that and god
[1:10:24] tells them
[1:10:24] remember of what you were but you know
[1:10:28] god doesn't leave that memory up to a
[1:10:30] man's mind
[1:10:33] god had messengers in that day paul
[1:10:36] even though he had passed off the scene
[1:10:38] was the messenger
[1:10:40] to that ephesian age he was the
[1:10:42] messenger that would be the
[1:10:44] pattern that every other true messenger
[1:10:48] and minister of god would be patterned
[1:10:51] like is that right one of the seven
[1:10:54] stars
[1:10:54] in the right hand of god now remember it
[1:10:57] is not the church
[1:10:58] that brings the man on the scene it is
[1:11:00] not the church that says
[1:11:02] my we need a move of god then this guy
[1:11:04] right here he's the one that's going to
[1:11:06] bring it
[1:11:06] that's a move of man and it'll die
[1:11:09] because it started with man
[1:11:10] but when one of those stars that are in
[1:11:13] the right hand
[1:11:14] when god sees that it's time that my
[1:11:17] church remember
[1:11:18] who they are god don't send them a
[1:11:20] picture
[1:11:21] god don't send them a bunch of letters
[1:11:23] he brings
[1:11:25] himself down in the ministry of those
[1:11:29] seven stars brother he ain't leaving it
[1:11:32] up to this man's mind and
[1:11:33] wonder what this is like and wonder
[1:11:35] what's life that's like
[1:11:37] god does not catch his eagles by the
[1:11:40] imagination
[1:11:41] of man his eagles are caught
[1:11:44] when he himself begins to fly
[1:11:48] over in the fulfillment of his word his
[1:11:51] children begin to say
[1:11:53] that's my daddy that's my papa
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:58] now let me get to this age
[1:12:04] the scripture said there would be a
[1:12:06] prophet
[1:12:07] raising it would raise up lacking unto
[1:12:10] moses
[1:12:11] is that right the opening of malachi 4
[1:12:14] remember ye
[1:12:15] the law of moses
[1:12:18] hallelujah what to come into the full
[1:12:21] promises
[1:12:22] of god is that right we are headed
[1:12:25] into a body change we are headed back to
[1:12:29] we're headed to the millennium is that
[1:12:31] right
[1:12:32] so here in this hour god it had to come
[1:12:35] with such clarity
[1:12:37] because the church is not just you know
[1:12:40] in the very beginning stages but the
[1:12:42] church coming
[1:12:43] in full maturity and in order for the
[1:12:46] church
[1:12:46] there to be a uniting because the
[1:12:48] scripture said that there must be
[1:12:50] a uniting with that of the word whereby
[1:12:53] that let us be glad and rejoice for the
[1:12:55] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:12:57] then in order to for that of the
[1:12:58] marriage of the lamb
[1:13:00] then the lamb himself must be present
[1:13:03] and the lamb is not a church but the
[1:13:05] lamb is the word
[1:13:07] the holy ghost himself my my my the son
[1:13:10] of man revealed
[1:13:11] in this generation and you think of it
[1:13:14] that you and i here we are standing
[1:13:16] in this time and god coming down through
[1:13:19] a prophetic anointing
[1:13:20] remember what a prophet is called to do
[1:13:22] there is a gift
[1:13:23] they are they are ordained by god to see
[1:13:26] and look
[1:13:27] past as brother braham said be on the
[1:13:29] music beyond the church
[1:13:31] beyond the creed they are ordained by
[1:13:34] god
[1:13:34] to look back into their my my mama
[1:13:37] they're ordained to look back into there
[1:13:40] just like a man
[1:13:41] who's standing outside of a circus and
[1:13:43] that man everybody else can't see in but
[1:13:46] that man
[1:13:46] has the ability to get above that fence
[1:13:49] he can begin to describe
[1:13:50] things that are inside of that fence
[1:13:53] he's describing it
[1:13:54] to the people that are there are you
[1:13:56] with me god
[1:13:57] sent a prophet in this hour in the
[1:14:00] fulfillment of his word
[1:14:01] he did not leave the interpretation of
[1:14:04] what a real son
[1:14:05] and daughter of god is into the minds of
[1:14:08] man
[1:14:08] it scrupled it up but god had a prophet
[1:14:11] in this hour
[1:14:12] in the fulfillment of his word he could
[1:14:14] pick him up and let you and i know
[1:14:16] we were always a thought of god we were
[1:14:19] always a gene of god
[1:14:20] we were always a son and daughter of god
[1:14:23] are you with me
[1:14:24] [Applause]
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:27] you take away the ministry of the
[1:14:29] prophet you take away the glory of jesus
[1:14:31] christ
[1:14:34] because it releases the glory of his
[1:14:36] redemptive grace
[1:14:38] it's not a man's word coming in the
[1:14:40] church it's the word of the living god
[1:14:44] this is why david said turn us again oh
[1:14:47] god
[1:14:49] god of host oh lord god of hosts
[1:14:52] it's god condescending down
[1:14:58] well before there was time there was the
[1:15:00] eternal
[1:15:01] there was the word and we were there
[1:15:04] with him
[1:15:05] in his thoughts
[1:15:11] i'm trying i'm trying i'm trying to
[1:15:13] behave
[1:15:15] but when he comes it just does something
[1:15:17] to me
[1:15:20] this cry brother richie for heavenly
[1:15:22] things you know when you begin to cry
[1:15:24] for heavenly things
[1:15:27] you might say well brother samuel i've
[1:15:28] cried for a new house or i've cried well
[1:15:30] there ain't nothing wrong with asking
[1:15:31] god for those things
[1:15:33] but when you begin to cry for heavenly
[1:15:36] things
[1:15:39] when you begin to cry from heaven for
[1:15:40] for heavenly things then
[1:15:42] you see it's god moving upon that heart
[1:15:45] it'll be met with heavenly things
[1:15:49] amen when hearts are desiring to be
[1:15:51] lined up with god in his word
[1:15:53] he said i'll hear from heaven then
[1:15:56] are you with me you see let me go here
[1:16:00] into this part of the scripture
[1:16:02] the bible says we beseech thee oh god of
[1:16:05] hosts
[1:16:06] look down from heaven and behold and
[1:16:08] visit this vine
[1:16:10] they needed a heavenly visitation
[1:16:15] they didn't need an earthly visitation
[1:16:17] they needed a heavenly visitation now
[1:16:20] all the roots that were within earth
[1:16:23] couldn't do it
[1:16:24] it was searched all over is there a man
[1:16:27] worthy
[1:16:29] are you with me i couldn't find no one
[1:16:31] worthy
[1:16:32] is that right so look down from heaven
[1:16:35] and behold
[1:16:36] and visit this vine they needed a
[1:16:38] visitation
[1:16:40] this is what i'm coming to they needed a
[1:16:43] visitation
[1:16:45] you know when you think of the word
[1:16:48] visit if i told you you know brother
[1:16:50] brian if i said i'm going to come to
[1:16:51] your house and visit you
[1:16:53] brother willie if i said i'm going to
[1:16:54] come visit you if i show up on your
[1:16:56] doorstep and i've got a u-haul behind me
[1:17:02] you think this guy didn't come to visit
[1:17:05] he came to stay
[1:17:09] is that right
[1:17:13] that's how we look at visit like if i'm
[1:17:15] going to come to your house and
[1:17:16] we sit down you know and have coffee i'm
[1:17:19] going to come there for a period of time
[1:17:20] and then
[1:17:21] i'm going to leave that's not how god
[1:17:25] visits his people
[1:17:29] god don't just come and just leave
[1:17:32] god comes with a purpose
[1:17:36] when god comes to make a house call or
[1:17:38] make a visit
[1:17:40] it's because there's some hearts that
[1:17:42] are moving
[1:17:43] and he himself his presence is just
[1:17:45] moving when
[1:17:46] you know when that word is getting ready
[1:17:47] to be fulfilled
[1:17:49] it releases it's like an energy that
[1:17:51] gets released a divine energy
[1:17:53] it begins to stir let's think of it
[1:17:55] think of how that when
[1:17:56] the ducks and everything else when
[1:17:58] there's going to be an earthquake
[1:18:00] nobody's out there sounding them on the
[1:18:02] alarm matter of fact they probably won't
[1:18:03] even trust the weather men we do trust
[1:18:05] they don't they don't go by that there
[1:18:07] is something within them
[1:18:09] they are alerted to go to gathering they
[1:18:11] get away from the walls when an
[1:18:13] earthquake is coming what is it
[1:18:15] you know like brother ram said nature
[1:18:17] calls it instinct
[1:18:18] i call it god god put that within them
[1:18:22] just like
[1:18:23] those of you that are deer hunters you
[1:18:24] know you know people can say you're
[1:18:26] crazy looking at the moon or a high
[1:18:28] pressure system or a low pressure system
[1:18:30] you know deer and other wildlife move
[1:18:33] ahead of a front
[1:18:34] after it passes through they come out
[1:18:36] again now fish
[1:18:37] i don't know i just go according to
[1:18:38] y'all but you realize there's something
[1:18:40] that is
[1:18:41] about that that you don't have to go
[1:18:43] tell the deer hey guess what
[1:18:45] there is a storm coming or snow's coming
[1:18:48] you don't have to tell them that
[1:18:49] they're in tune with the pressure
[1:18:52] that is going on around them
[1:18:56] hallelujah if animal life can be in tune
[1:19:00] with those atmospheric conditions what
[1:19:03] about the believer
[1:19:05] when the word is in a part of
[1:19:07] fulfillment brother
[1:19:09] there's an atmosphere that's being
[1:19:11] released
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:16] hallelujah oh my god begins to stir
[1:19:20] his children now when we look at this
[1:19:22] that visitation it ain't like what you
[1:19:24] and i
[1:19:25] and what we do when we visit god he
[1:19:28] comes and he remains
[1:19:33] so the real purpose let me just set this
[1:19:34] before i run through some scriptures
[1:19:36] the real purpose of a visitation is that
[1:19:39] his word might be fulfilled
[1:19:42] that's a visit from god and he will
[1:19:45] always come
[1:19:46] in the fulfillment of his word
[1:19:50] think about abraham and sarah here they
[1:19:51] are sitting before
[1:19:53] the tent door and here god
[1:19:56] comes down with two angels
[1:20:00] god don't have a placard on his chest
[1:20:02] i'm god
[1:20:04] abraham abraham was walking in step
[1:20:08] with him and he recognized there's
[1:20:11] something
[1:20:12] spiritual about this man
[1:20:15] is that right and he began to entertain
[1:20:18] him
[1:20:21] he didn't just say hey i'm glad you came
[1:20:24] down today man it's wonderful
[1:20:27] he moved to entertain him you see
[1:20:30] this was a time god had already spoke to
[1:20:33] him
[1:20:33] in the previous chapter and other times
[1:20:36] but god
[1:20:37] had laid out a promise from the
[1:20:38] beginning that it start to come
[1:20:40] a little bit more clear to where god had
[1:20:43] told him in the previous chapter
[1:20:45] that i'm going to visit sarah
[1:20:48] in the set time next next you know in
[1:20:51] the oncoming year i'm going to visit her
[1:20:53] is that right and so he was waiting for
[1:20:56] that visitation
[1:20:58] he was there and when god made himself
[1:21:00] known
[1:21:01] abraham moved to entertain him now
[1:21:04] notice
[1:21:04] god came down and for and now when the
[1:21:08] scripture
[1:21:08] as it stands there we find that how that
[1:21:11] god is standing there
[1:21:13] and he begins to speak to abraham and
[1:21:15] he's asking his whole purpose of this
[1:21:17] visit
[1:21:18] is sarah
[1:21:21] glory be to god where is sarah thy wife
[1:21:26] he didn't say where is hagar hagar's not
[1:21:28] even in
[1:21:29] mentioned in the promise
[1:21:33] amen where is sarah thy wife
[1:21:37] and here god begins to express i'm going
[1:21:40] to visit her
[1:21:42] at the set time you know next month
[1:21:47] and sarah in her heart laughed
[1:21:50] why she's looking at herself sarah
[1:21:54] doesn't know who this
[1:21:55] is
[1:21:59] oh let me preach now brother branham
[1:22:01] says there in the tent that morning
[1:22:03] there was a little bit of a scuffle
[1:22:07] a little bit of words were exchanged
[1:22:14] we'll say it like brother john
[1:22:16] lafontaine we won't call it arguing
[1:22:17] we'll be a little bit more
[1:22:18] self-righteous we'll call it heated
[1:22:22] fellowship
[1:22:24] and sarah now look how brilliant puts us
[1:22:26] is it to anything too hard for the lord
[1:22:27] he said sarah had begin to look at the
[1:22:30] caravan that was carrying
[1:22:32] this certain types of clothing down to
[1:22:34] sodom and she began to ask
[1:22:36] abraham hey look at what they're getting
[1:22:38] down there do you think this would be
[1:22:40] all right do you think this
[1:22:41] and abraham was stood there and told her
[1:22:44] sarah
[1:22:45] that is not for something that we are to
[1:22:47] be
[1:22:48] a part of oh my aren't you glad the word
[1:22:50] was able to stand there in that time get
[1:22:52] back in step
[1:22:54] we're not to be a part of sodom it stood
[1:22:56] right there
[1:22:57] amen our husband the word is there
[1:23:00] brother
[1:23:01] when he took the veil off and he put it
[1:23:03] there on his shoulder
[1:23:04] we are depending and resting in him
[1:23:08] he's the one who's watching over our
[1:23:10] lives
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:13] satan would like to try to get us tied
[1:23:15] up before the promise
[1:23:17] comes to pass but oh let us look to our
[1:23:21] husband the word the holy spirit is
[1:23:24] there to direct us
[1:23:25] and guide us
[1:23:33] sarah recognizes this is missing more
[1:23:36] than a man
[1:23:38] this is more than a man only god can
[1:23:42] know what's in my heart
[1:23:45] but the god who knew what was in her
[1:23:46] heart was there on a visitation
[1:23:48] to dissolve the doubt
[1:23:52] glory be to god see god comes with a
[1:23:54] purpose his visitation
[1:23:56] was to dissolve the doubt in sarah's
[1:23:59] heart
[1:24:00] come on now you see abraham's faith oh
[1:24:04] my
[1:24:04] i just got to preach a little bit you
[1:24:06] see abraham's faith
[1:24:07] brother ram tells us in believing god he
[1:24:09] said it never really was sarah's faith
[1:24:11] that performed the promise
[1:24:13] it was abraham's faith but you see
[1:24:15] abraham's faith had been placed upon
[1:24:17] that generation
[1:24:19] and it was not abraham himself it was
[1:24:21] the faith of almighty god
[1:24:23] that was moving down through sarah's
[1:24:26] heart this is why the scripture could
[1:24:28] say
[1:24:28] that she judged him faithful
[1:24:32] you see god had dispensed that and she
[1:24:34] was abiding
[1:24:36] under that word under that life under
[1:24:38] that faith it had an effect on her life
[1:24:42] it was a visitation she received a
[1:24:45] visitation
[1:24:47] some time went on by things happened
[1:24:50] right they journeyed on down to goreer
[1:24:53] but here comes
[1:24:54] in genesis 21 1 and the lord
[1:24:58] visited sarah
[1:25:01] this time he wasn't he didn't come in
[1:25:04] that flesh body he used
[1:25:07] but he was riding the same trail again
[1:25:10] preach with me now
[1:25:12] and the lord visited sarah as
[1:25:16] he had said and the lord
[1:25:19] did unto sarah as he had spoken now let
[1:25:23] me tell you something
[1:25:24] sarah wasn't just standing there you
[1:25:26] know like somebody with strings on
[1:25:28] the word that had went forth brother
[1:25:30] under that visitation
[1:25:32] when god was standing there present in
[1:25:35] flesh
[1:25:35] that word had so gripped her heart to
[1:25:38] where
[1:25:39] she judged him faithful and the bible
[1:25:42] said she received
[1:25:43] strength to conceive
[1:25:47] that's the only way you get anywhere
[1:25:48] with god that's the only way the holy
[1:25:50] ghost comes
[1:25:51] that's the only way every promise comes
[1:25:53] is you must judge
[1:25:54] him faithful who made the promise
[1:26:01] for sarah conceived and bear abraham a
[1:26:04] son in his old age
[1:26:05] at the set time of which god had spoken
[1:26:07] to him
[1:26:08] my here in genesis 50 verse 24
[1:26:12] here's joseph on his here he is down in
[1:26:15] egypt
[1:26:16] remember there's a promise that god had
[1:26:17] made to abraham
[1:26:19] and now here is joseph down there in
[1:26:22] egypt
[1:26:24] jacob's already passed and here is
[1:26:26] joseph and joseph makes this statement
[1:26:28] to his brethren and he said
[1:26:32] i die and god will surely visit you
[1:26:35] and bring you out of this land unto the
[1:26:37] land which he swear to abraham to isaac
[1:26:40] and to jacob
[1:26:43] now i'm not going to read the rest of
[1:26:44] verses but jacob joseph let him know
[1:26:47] don't you leave me here you take my
[1:26:50] bones
[1:26:50] with you amen amen though i've gone by
[1:26:54] the way of the grave
[1:26:55] the promise is sure
[1:26:58] because god made the promise abraham
[1:27:02] didn't make the promise
[1:27:03] god made the promise and joseph was tied
[1:27:07] in
[1:27:07] to the same god who spoke to his
[1:27:10] great-grandfather
[1:27:11] abraham glory be to god
[1:27:16] oh my then we find here here you find
[1:27:18] moses
[1:27:19] here he comes here's a period of time
[1:27:21] 400 years
[1:27:22] now 40 years after the 400 years now
[1:27:25] remember
[1:27:26] why was that 40 years 40 is a type of a
[1:27:29] generation is that right because
[1:27:32] when moses came down there and you know
[1:27:35] he slew that egyptian
[1:27:37] they rejected him you see any time
[1:27:41] there's a rejection look what happened
[1:27:43] when it came time to cross over into the
[1:27:45] land of canaan
[1:27:47] had to let that generation die off right
[1:27:50] god will not take in a generation
[1:27:52] anything that's disobedient to his word
[1:27:55] god can't work with anything that doubts
[1:27:57] his word
[1:27:59] is that right this is why he could speak
[1:28:01] of caleb caleb had a different spirit
[1:28:03] from the rest of him because caleb
[1:28:04] fully followed the lord
[1:28:07] is that right so we find how here god
[1:28:10] comes down
[1:28:11] and he says he speaks to to to moses
[1:28:14] this is what i want you to say
[1:28:15] he says let me jump to the end of verse
[1:28:17] 16 of
[1:28:19] exodus 3 i have surely visited you
[1:28:22] and seen that which is done to you in
[1:28:25] egypt and i have said i will bring you
[1:28:27] up
[1:28:28] out of the affliction of egypt unto the
[1:28:30] land
[1:28:31] of the canaanites now as we go on here
[1:28:35] you find that here remember god sends
[1:28:38] aaron
[1:28:39] out to meet moses is that right he sends
[1:28:42] him out to meet
[1:28:43] moses and he says to moses aaron will be
[1:28:46] your spokesman now aaron
[1:28:50] aaron can't be moses spokesman if he's
[1:28:52] saying something different from moses
[1:28:55] so whoever wants to claim to be aaron
[1:28:57] you say something different from moses
[1:29:00] it might be aaron but it's the aaron of
[1:29:02] a golden calf
[1:29:03] preach with me now because we are not
[1:29:07] turned back to idol worship we are not
[1:29:09] turned back to the worship of man
[1:29:12] come on now this message never came
[1:29:15] to cause a man or a personality to be
[1:29:19] exalted
[1:29:20] god will not share his glory
[1:29:23] or his worship with any man
[1:29:29] he said i am god alone
[1:29:33] is that right so a real aaron is what
[1:29:36] god says through the prophet in the
[1:29:38] message spoken word
[1:29:40] his original seed he said there stood
[1:29:42] moses with the vindicated word
[1:29:44] and his help mate standing right beside
[1:29:46] him who is the helpmate of the prophet
[1:29:49] it is the wife of the lord jesus where
[1:29:52] the spirit
[1:29:53] of the living god is pulsating through
[1:29:56] in the same original glory
[1:29:58] and power and vesture it is the helpmate
[1:30:01] of almighty god
[1:30:02] what is the help mate it is the womb in
[1:30:05] order to bring
[1:30:06] his promise through
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:10] we're not filled with empty words
[1:30:14] it's the spirit of god moving in our
[1:30:16] life
[1:30:19] hallelujah it's a word that's pulsating
[1:30:23] in our heart and our life brother this
[1:30:25] pride
[1:30:26] is the final voice to the final age
[1:30:29] under
[1:30:29] her messenger
[1:30:30] [Applause]
[1:30:33] nobody in between i don't care how good
[1:30:35] they are how fancy they are
[1:30:37] nobody in between
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:30:40] are you with me under the messenger is
[1:30:43] to be under
[1:30:44] the word is to be under the blood
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:50] come on now glory be to god because
[1:30:53] it is that word that comes through the
[1:30:55] messenger
[1:30:56] that reveals the provided approach to
[1:30:59] the throne of almighty god
[1:31:01] are you with me it opens the pathway
[1:31:03] back into sonship
[1:31:04] it opens the pathway come on now it
[1:31:07] opens the pathway
[1:31:08] across that of the laver to let you see
[1:31:10] here's the pathway
[1:31:11] through the blood of the lord jesus
[1:31:13] christ into a real union
[1:31:15] with almighty god
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:19] my let me get back to my scripture here
[1:31:21] aaron stood there
[1:31:24] and here aaron performs the signs
[1:31:27] that god gave to the prophet is that
[1:31:30] right
[1:31:31] but it was before the people of god now
[1:31:34] i want you to watch what the people of
[1:31:35] god said
[1:31:37] the bible said the people believed in
[1:31:38] verse 31 of exodus 4
[1:31:40] and when they had heard that the lord
[1:31:42] had visited the children of israel
[1:31:44] and that he had looked upon their
[1:31:46] affliction then they bowed their heads
[1:31:47] and worshipped
[1:31:50] when they had heard he had visited you
[1:31:53] see it wasn't like oh he visited out
[1:31:55] there
[1:31:56] in the desert not just a visit out there
[1:32:00] remember he said i'm come down and
[1:32:02] behold i send you
[1:32:05] come on now his visitation it wasn't
[1:32:08] left somewhere it wasn't left out in
[1:32:11] sabino canyon
[1:32:13] come on somebody when the head was
[1:32:15] coming because the body
[1:32:17] was on earth are you with me
[1:32:21] it was coming with the visitation that
[1:32:23] the head and the body
[1:32:24] might be united together this is the
[1:32:27] marriage of the lamb
[1:32:30] is that right and the people witnessing
[1:32:32] god's visitation
[1:32:34] they weren't just looking at wow this
[1:32:36] sign wow this one you see this is where
[1:32:37] pentecostals get off
[1:32:41] they believe brother adam was a prophet
[1:32:43] but they believe it in terms of oh it's
[1:32:44] signs
[1:32:45] oh it's wonders oh he did this and he
[1:32:48] did that
[1:32:49] that ain't what a prophet is signs and
[1:32:52] wonders
[1:32:52] accompany but remember the bible tells
[1:32:55] us in the book of acts
[1:32:56] that jesus was a man approved of god
[1:32:58] among them with
[1:32:59] signs and wonders following
[1:33:03] is that right what it comes down to is
[1:33:06] is that as god told moses i'm just going
[1:33:08] to preach as it's coming
[1:33:09] what god told moses he said if they
[1:33:11] won't believe the voice of the
[1:33:12] first sign then he said it'll be the
[1:33:14] voice of the second sign
[1:33:16] is that right if they don't believe that
[1:33:17] then it'll be that of the latter you see
[1:33:19] what it was it was not the sign but it
[1:33:22] was the voice
[1:33:23] of the sign that catches the attention
[1:33:26] of the believer because there's many
[1:33:29] listen friends
[1:33:30] there's different ones now i'm going to

[1:33:52] the natural abraham seed they crucified
[1:33:56] the lord jesus when he came they
[1:33:58] couldn't recognize the word

[1:34:07] day and rejoiced to see it what did
[1:34:10] abraham see
[1:34:11] the visitation of the son of man in that
[1:34:14] day

[1:34:17] redeemer
[1:34:18] that would then come in this last days
[1:34:21] in the fullness of his word

[1:37:40] forgive me for a minute lord i'm loving
[1:37:42] this
[1:37:45] hallelujah you know here was a woman
[1:37:49] by the name of hannah
[1:37:52] she was known as a barren woman she
[1:37:55] cried
[1:37:57] she she sought god you know and there
[1:37:59] was one who was her adversary the bible
[1:38:02] says and mocked her
[1:38:06] scoffed at her i got more children than
[1:38:08] you
[1:38:12] this is what i want you to look at here
[1:38:15] the bible says that the lord
[1:38:17] visited hannah so that she conceived
[1:38:22] it took a visitation from god
[1:38:25] [Music]
[1:38:27] hannah i want let's look at it for a
[1:38:29] minute can we do that
[1:38:31] i wonder if you could see hannah here
[1:38:32] she is maybe around her devotions and
[1:38:34] her and you know her husband and you
[1:38:36] know and they were praying and
[1:38:38] um sister so and so that said they
[1:38:41] they'd like to have a baby
[1:38:42] could we pray for them in devotion
[1:38:44] tonight sure honey
[1:38:45] we'll pray for him and they get together
[1:38:47] and they're praying even though that's
[1:38:48] the desire in her heart
[1:38:52] see she's not wrapped up in self
[1:38:55] are you with me now let's just dramatize
[1:38:56] it a little bit is that okay
[1:38:58] that's probably how it was with
[1:38:59] zacharias and elizabeth
[1:39:02] they were taking prayer requests for
[1:39:04] other people and praying about them and
[1:39:05] god was answering
[1:39:06] prayers come on now
[1:39:10] and it seemed like they had been
[1:39:12] forgotten
[1:39:15] but god hadn't forgotten them god's got
[1:39:18] an ordained appointed time
[1:39:22] hallelujah and don't handle think of it
[1:39:25] you think at times
[1:39:26] her or elizabeth at times in their
[1:39:29] spirit they weren't maybe
[1:39:30] faster but i don't understand her lord
[1:39:33] this but there was a faithfulness on the
[1:39:35] inside of them
[1:39:37] that kept them into a place to where
[1:39:39] that the angel
[1:39:40] of the lord came down and visited
[1:39:43] zacharias
[1:39:44] and elizabeth home let me tell you
[1:39:46] something though there are many things
[1:39:47] you don't understand
[1:39:49] i don't understand they're promises that
[1:39:51] you're holding on to
[1:39:52] but god has never forgot about one of
[1:39:56] his promises
[1:39:57] what do i do stay in a place and let the
[1:40:00] atmosphere
[1:40:01] of the promise you're holding on to let
[1:40:04] it create an atmosphere
[1:40:05] that god can come and visit
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:13] oh my it came that moment that hannah
[1:40:17] herself she had remained faithful and
[1:40:20] god had a reason
[1:40:22] couldn't do it any time before it had to
[1:40:24] be in this appointed season
[1:40:28] hallelujah hey listen friends this is
[1:40:30] not a bible story this is a reality of
[1:40:32] prophecy for our lives
[1:40:35] god will always fulfill his word in his
[1:40:37] time and in his season
[1:40:39] and the prophet tells us in satan's eden
[1:40:41] that our experiences are predestinated
[1:40:43] from the hand of almighty god
[1:40:46] is that right now notice this visitation
[1:40:49] coming down here
[1:40:50] notice in luke 1 68 here you find
[1:40:54] zechariah so here he is the visitations
[1:40:56] come
[1:40:57] here zacharias john has come on the
[1:40:58] scene his tongue has been loosed
[1:41:00] blessed be the lord god of israel for he
[1:41:02] hath
[1:41:03] visited and redeemed his people
[1:41:09] john had been born they're waiting on
[1:41:12] jesus to be born
[1:41:13] but you see the promise had already now
[1:41:15] been confirmed that here's what's to
[1:41:18] take place
[1:41:21] amen because the prophet here john was
[1:41:24] was the prophet that was to go before
[1:41:26] him in
[1:41:27] the power and the spirit of elias is
[1:41:30] that right
[1:41:31] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:41:33] children that's what it says
[1:41:34] through notice in verse 78 through the
[1:41:36] tender mercy of our god
[1:41:37] whereby the day spring former on high
[1:41:40] hath
[1:41:41] visited us to give light to them that
[1:41:44] set in darkness
[1:41:45] and in the shadow of death to guide our
[1:41:47] feet into the way of
[1:41:49] peace you see israel was a vine
[1:41:54] when we read in our texts brother drake
[1:41:56] they had they had
[1:41:57] that it had burned and it had been ate
[1:41:59] down but here's the thing
[1:42:02] the life is in the roots
[1:42:08] the life is in the roots and this is why
[1:42:10] i could say
[1:42:11] visit this vine visit the vineyard that
[1:42:14] you planted with your right hand oh god
[1:42:18] visit it visit it with your strength
[1:42:20] with your power
[1:42:22] well god didn't send another you know
[1:42:25] something different down
[1:42:26] but god intended here he came as brother
[1:42:28] ram would put it this way let me just
[1:42:30] paraphrase and put these things together
[1:42:32] he says god in his own predestinated in
[1:42:34] his own great infinite mind planned the
[1:42:36] plan to put a real vine down
[1:42:38] he planted on this earth the vine the
[1:42:41] righteous vine not a denomination not a
[1:42:43] church not a creed
[1:42:44] but a man himself made flesh and he
[1:42:46] manifested his peace
[1:42:48] his power the great angel of god the
[1:42:50] great jehovah was with him and in him
[1:42:52] dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:42:54] and men did not believe him and
[1:42:56] disbelieve him because
[1:42:58] he would not cooperate with their creed
[1:43:01] but finally they led him away to calvary
[1:43:04] and there that blood cell was broken of
[1:43:06] the precious son of god
[1:43:07] the body in which jehovah lived there
[1:43:10] came forth a vine
[1:43:12] with its roots in glory
[1:43:15] amen how many know he is the root and
[1:43:17] offspring of david
[1:43:20] amen he came to deal with the root
[1:43:23] because the problem was in the roots
[1:43:28] amen you know you snap a weed off it'll
[1:43:30] come back if you don't get the root
[1:43:32] is that right so he came to deal with
[1:43:35] the real problem
[1:43:36] in the roots but there came one whose
[1:43:38] roots
[1:43:39] were not of the earth the roots from
[1:43:41] glory
[1:43:44] larry be the god in the eyes with its
[1:43:46] branches
[1:43:47] on earth to produce a church of the
[1:43:50] living god
[1:43:50] that would show forth his resurrection
[1:43:53] power
[1:43:54] oh he said who are these men and women
[1:43:56] that would deny the church
[1:43:57] the vine of the living god do you notice
[1:44:00] catch this
[1:44:00] that here the vine from heaven came down
[1:44:04] that what that it might release the life
[1:44:07] into
[1:44:08] that of the church of the living god
[1:44:11] is that right so it had to come in that
[1:44:13] in that manner he said now notice
[1:44:15] it's the presence of the lord jesus with
[1:44:17] his church to live
[1:44:18] and to show forth his predestinated
[1:44:20] branches that he's caught before the
[1:44:22] foundation of the earth
[1:44:23] and his church today with the glory of
[1:44:26] his resurrection
[1:44:28] living in here
[1:44:34] so he went from an ant from a type to an
[1:44:37] anatype
[1:44:39] so remember something more had to happen
[1:44:41] it took
[1:44:42] god coming down there were branches on
[1:44:48] earth
[1:44:50] that were bearing the wrong kind of
[1:44:52] fruit
[1:44:55] but he had to come down to be able to
[1:44:57] separate that life
[1:45:01] that was operating through us
[1:45:05] man there had to be an atonement that
[1:45:06] was made that his life could come
[1:45:08] back into the believer
[1:45:12] i want you to think of this here david
[1:45:15] you know when david would express this
[1:45:16] this this visitation
[1:45:18] it was a visitation from heaven and let
[1:45:20] me just let me bring this down
[1:45:22] you see without a visitation from heaven
[1:45:26] israel now this is this is when it takes
[1:45:28] place with 144 000 and god
[1:45:30] brings a ceiling to israel they are
[1:45:32] called
[1:45:33] to the true atonement by their two
[1:45:35] witnesses
[1:45:36] but i want you to i want to remind you
[1:45:38] the same message that those two
[1:45:40] witnesses
[1:45:41] preached to the 144 thousand is the
[1:45:44] message
[1:45:44] you're under yeah
[1:45:48] are you with me this is the message that
[1:45:51] calls us to
[1:45:52] the true atonement
[1:45:55] this is not of the killing of the lamb
[1:45:57] it's pointing
[1:45:58] back to the lamb that was slain is that
[1:46:01] right
[1:46:02] this is the feast of the atonement here
[1:46:04] we're called into that
[1:46:05] into that place of what's open to you
[1:46:07] and i right now is a fountain
[1:46:09] that's open in the house of david amen
[1:46:12] it's the life of almighty god the blood
[1:46:14] that's been shed
[1:46:15] to cleanse the life to make him ready
[1:46:17] think of israel think of them when
[1:46:18] they're getting off the plane
[1:46:20] some of you watch that on their their
[1:46:21] ali isles and whatever more they're
[1:46:22] getting off in their short britches and
[1:46:24] their pain all over their face and their
[1:46:25] ear bobs and
[1:46:26] hair butchered off and some of them got
[1:46:28] all kinds of hair color and everything
[1:46:29] else going on
[1:46:30] things that you can even visibly see on
[1:46:32] the right right on the outside
[1:46:33] you know that ain't of god what do you
[1:46:35] know has to happen brother
[1:46:36] it ain't just the outside that's got to
[1:46:38] be clean the inside's got to be clean
[1:46:40] there's got to come a fountain open in
[1:46:42] the house of david
[1:46:43] just knowing the law ain't enough
[1:46:45] knowing the psalms ain't enough
[1:46:47] knowing the prophets is not enough
[1:46:48] listen to me now knowing the message is
[1:46:50] not enough
[1:46:51] you've got to meet the lord jesus christ
[1:46:53] the god of this message
[1:46:56] that's the fountain that's open in the
[1:46:58] house of david
[1:46:59] you'll never get clean on your own you
[1:47:01] can try to lick your spots they only
[1:47:03] stand out
[1:47:04] the only thing you can do is ask for god
[1:47:08] there be a visitation from heaven
[1:47:13] i need a visitation from heaven in my
[1:47:15] life
[1:47:18] amen think of it
[1:47:21] i'm not i'm bringing this down i'm not
[1:47:23] just i'm not trying to take up your time
[1:47:26] these things are eternal life
[1:47:29] this is very important here not because
[1:47:32] i said it
[1:47:33] but let me say this to you there were
[1:47:35] many that saw the lord jesus in their
[1:47:37] day
[1:47:38] many that came in contact with him
[1:47:40] there's many that ate of the fishes and
[1:47:42] loaves
[1:47:45] they didn't walk on with him they
[1:47:48] enjoyed the miracles
[1:47:49] enjoyed the meals that was it
[1:47:53] that's what they enjoyed but see it
[1:47:55] wasn't life to them
[1:47:57] they didn't recognize who was behind
[1:47:59] that veil
[1:48:00] the bible says he came to his own
[1:48:05] think about it if you went to your
[1:48:07] family and you here you are
[1:48:08] your family should know you and your
[1:48:11] family says
[1:48:12] who are you and you look at them say i'm
[1:48:14] your daddy
[1:48:16] when you say i'm your mom you would look
[1:48:18] at them and say
[1:48:19] good lord they've lost their mind they
[1:48:22] don't even know who i am
[1:48:25] let me tell you something he came to his
[1:48:28] own
[1:48:31] they were holding the written word they
[1:48:34] had moses
[1:48:35] word
[1:48:38] but they didn't recognize him in their
[1:48:42] midst
[1:48:44] he came to his own and his own received
[1:48:47] him not
[1:48:48] but as many has received to him
[1:48:52] to them he gave the authority
[1:48:55] the rights to become sons and daughters
[1:48:59] of god
[1:49:00] can we look at a few of them thank you
[1:49:03] here was a woman there by the well
[1:49:05] she went out there every day you know
[1:49:07] what that was of her father
[1:49:09] jacob she got water day after day but
[1:49:12] that water never changed
[1:49:14] her life that water left her hungry but
[1:49:17] one day
[1:49:18] god himself said i must needs go by
[1:49:21] samaria she didn't know that day
[1:49:24] a trip to the well that day of who was
[1:49:26] going to be sitting there
[1:49:27] but god was coming down to visit and
[1:49:30] redeem one of his genes
[1:49:32] his redeemable thoughts back to himself
[1:49:36] and god redeems his children by the
[1:49:39] visitation
[1:49:40] of himself in the form of his word
[1:49:45] she left the whale she left the pot
[1:49:48] and she went and said come see a man
[1:49:52] who's told me everything that i've ever
[1:49:54] done
[1:50:00] no no condemnation on her life
[1:50:04] you know why because the person that
[1:50:07] went there
[1:50:07] want the same person that came from
[1:50:09] there
[1:50:11] come on now hallelujah
[1:50:14] oh my the darkness that was over her
[1:50:16] life she was always a seat of god
[1:50:19] but brother look here she is standing
[1:50:21] here she is standing
[1:50:23] she's talking to him he's talking to her
[1:50:27] she thinks this is just a jew i'm a
[1:50:29] samaritan
[1:50:30] but what did what did the word tell her
[1:50:33] if thou knewest the gift
[1:50:36] of god that speaks to you
[1:50:39] you would ask him for a drink and he'll
[1:50:42] give you a drink you will never thirst
[1:50:44] again
[1:50:46] he's letting her know who she's in the
[1:50:48] presence of
[1:50:51] what was happening this vine
[1:50:54] with roots and glory began to pulsate
[1:50:57] out
[1:50:58] and because down on the inside was a
[1:51:00] predestinated
[1:51:02] branch of almighty god it caught that
[1:51:04] pulsation i perceived
[1:51:08] i perceived not a prophet and
[1:51:11] if paul said it again and that branch
[1:51:14] responded again
[1:51:15] to the place i know that messiah
[1:51:18] cometh amen what's happening the
[1:51:23] pulsation
[1:51:24] of the life from the roots is striking
[1:51:26] that branch
[1:51:28] and that branch is responding you see it
[1:51:30] comes down to this place
[1:51:33] to receive that visitation
[1:51:38] brother brandon would tell talk to the
[1:51:39] congregation and the message desperation
[1:51:41] please just just lock in with me here
[1:51:42] just a few minutes
[1:51:44] he said if we're not careful he didn't
[1:51:47] tell people
[1:51:48] this to make him fearful he wanted him
[1:51:50] to see
[1:51:51] he said if you're not careful what's in
[1:51:52] your midst will pass
[1:51:54] right through you
[1:51:59] it's to give ourselves to him
[1:52:03] now let me just say this there's a lot
[1:52:05] of humble acts
[1:52:07] that a person can do
[1:52:11] brother branham talks about in a message
[1:52:12] desperation
[1:52:14] he said taking our shoes off won't
[1:52:17] satisfy it
[1:52:20] taking our hat off or whatever won't
[1:52:22] satisfy it
[1:52:23] but a life that brings
[1:52:26] forth the fruits amen that's humility
[1:52:30] because it's
[1:52:32] laying down our life
[1:52:35] that his life might flow through us
[1:52:40] and that's constant submission i'm i'm
[1:52:43] closing this is just tying up these
[1:52:45] loose ends but don't don't
[1:52:46] this this ain't the time for a bathroom
[1:52:48] break i'm just i'm not saying that to be
[1:52:50] funny i'm saying that because this is
[1:52:51] the thing
[1:52:54] that sometimes friends the things that
[1:52:56] we remember how brother brown says in
[1:52:58] christ the mystery he said
[1:53:00] god's trying to reveal these things to
[1:53:02] you he said but you let
[1:53:04] family you let your job you learn all
[1:53:07] these other things
[1:53:08] take it out of you
[1:53:11] see it it had already been placed there
[1:53:14] but he said you let these other things
[1:53:16] take it
[1:53:16] out of you what god is trying to reveal
[1:53:19] to you
[1:53:20] it's a battle that goes on
[1:53:23] this is why just coming to the house of
[1:53:27] god
[1:53:28] just serving the lord is not just well
[1:53:31] i've come here on sunday
[1:53:32] or i've been to church here thursday all
[1:53:34] right i've got it's it's not coming and
[1:53:36] we
[1:53:37] i've checked off my duty for the week
[1:53:39] that ain't it
[1:53:40] amen that's that's not what god
[1:53:44] that's not what a visitation of god is
[1:53:46] about
[1:53:47] it's where it takes in a reflection in
[1:53:50] our lives
[1:53:51] that where we're really honest before
[1:53:53] god we look into the word of god and
[1:53:55] lord
[1:53:55] where am i lacking where am i lacking
[1:54:00] where is it in my life that's lacking i
[1:54:03] want it lord i want my life
[1:54:05] to move on further i want my life i want
[1:54:09] i want my life to grow
[1:54:10] lord in you see this is a part of the
[1:54:14] visitation that's inviting god in
[1:54:17] to really obey his voice to take it in
[1:54:20] and
[1:54:21] pray over that word reflect over that
[1:54:23] word because his visitation he
[1:54:25] comes that his word would be fulfilled
[1:54:28] in our lives
[1:54:32] there's no greater there's no greater
[1:54:34] thing that can take place or
[1:54:36] countless number examples we could go
[1:54:38] through here in the scriptures of
[1:54:39] different ones that just through prayer
[1:54:41] that just had laid out before me
[1:54:42] different ones brother brian sung of
[1:54:44] mary be it unto me according to thy word
[1:54:47] there was a visitation that was made
[1:54:50] let me just let me just give you the
[1:54:51] contrast so maybe that'll that it lays
[1:54:53] it open
[1:54:54] if you walk out of this service today
[1:54:56] and you know even in your heart
[1:54:58] that you're not where you should be with
[1:55:00] god then you're not entertaining him
[1:55:04] it's a visitation with god entertain him
[1:55:08] as the service is going on invite him in
[1:55:10] and be honest before god says lord if
[1:55:12] there's somewhere that
[1:55:13] that you're cooled off or you're lacking
[1:55:14] invite him in and say lord jesus
[1:55:17] remedy this in my life lord strengthen
[1:55:19] me lord in those areas where i've been
[1:55:21] weak
[1:55:22] he's not ashamed he came down here this
[1:55:24] morning to speak to you and i
[1:55:26] he's desiring that fellowship you think
[1:55:29] you don't like things between you and
[1:55:31] him
[1:55:31] he don't like things between you and him
[1:55:34] his love for you and i
[1:55:35] shows us these things so that you and i
[1:55:37] can say lord
[1:55:38] forgive me cleanse me lord because why
[1:55:42] the desire is this visitation
[1:55:44] it brings a change in it there's a
[1:55:47] transformation and we are
[1:55:48] changed from glory unto glory even by
[1:55:52] the spirit of the living god
[1:55:54] amen it's a visitation not just go out
[1:55:56] and well i'll go back out you know in my
[1:55:58] life and
[1:55:59] mine wasn't that a good service and

[1:57:24] because that visitation has come to us
[1:57:28] and we've accepted it by his grace
[1:57:30] through a part of himself he put within
[1:57:32] us
[1:57:33] and we've entertained him

[1:58:34] to minister to all of our needs

[1:58:42] us
[1:58:43] to release the desires that we have
[1:58:46] in him god knows the desire that you
[1:58:49] have
[1:58:51] jairus recognized him it released the
[1:58:53] power of resurrection in his home

[1:59:32] evaluation of our lives
[1:59:34] oh every thought in his presence
[1:59:39] hearts it's made known
[1:59:44] but god you know god doesn't god doesn't
[1:59:47] bring things to our attention
[1:59:49] to condemn us but god comes and he
[1:59:53] you bring conviction in his presence
[1:59:56] there's things that

[2:00:19] the very anytime a thought or feeling
[2:00:23] would be in our lives as though that i'm
[2:00:26] doing all right
[2:00:27] i'm doing pretty good that's a dangerous
[2:00:30] spot to be in
[2:00:31] not that you should be in a place to say
[2:00:33] oh i'm terrible i'm right no no

[2:00:39] your need of more of him
[2:00:42] lord i need more of you

[2:01:12] but i would i would say here in this
[2:01:14] time
