[35:08] with you and
[35:09] thank you for the songs that were sung
[35:13] amen you you got uh
[35:17] stuck with me again two weeks in a row
[35:20] but um i kind of ward a little bit with
[35:24] moving on but i'm just gonna go back to
[35:26] joshua 10 if that's okay
[35:28] and uh didn't quite get all the way
[35:31] there
[35:32] last week so we just trust that the lord
[35:35] is still
[35:36] is still bringing inspiration amen
[35:39] praise the lord the 10th chapter of
[35:42] joshua in the 22nd verse
[35:45] then said joshua open the mouth of the
[35:47] cave and bring out those five kings
[35:49] unto me out of the cave and they did so
[35:52] and brought forth those five kings unto
[35:54] him out of the cave
[35:55] the king of jerusalem the king of hebron
[35:57] the king of jarmoth
[35:58] the king of latish the king of eglon and
[36:01] it came to pass when they brought out
[36:03] those kings unto joshua
[36:05] that joshua called for all the men of
[36:07] israel and said unto the captains of the
[36:09] men of war
[36:10] which went with him come near put your
[36:13] feet upon the necks of these kings
[36:16] and they came near and put their feet
[36:19] upon the necks of them
[36:20] and joshua said unto them fear not nor
[36:23] be dismayed be strong and of good
[36:25] courage for
[36:26] thus shall the lord do to all your
[36:28] enemies
[36:29] against whom ye fight and afterwards
[36:32] joshua smote them and slew them and hun
[36:34] hang them on five trees and they were
[36:36] hanging upon the trees until the evening
[36:38] so you may be seated may god
[36:40] bless his word tonight and i know uh if
[36:42] maybe if you weren't here
[36:43] last week we just we'll just re
[36:46] face it for a minute here but but uh
[36:49] brother bannon would preach the message
[36:51] uh the greatest battle ever fought and
[36:53] he would talk about how there's five
[36:55] there's five gates or there's five
[36:56] inlets to the to the soul and there's
[36:58] there's
[36:59] one way to to to control that and that's
[37:02] by self-will there's there's one thing
[37:04] that governs all those gates and that's
[37:05] self-will and so
[37:07] last week we kind of got into how that
[37:09] these five kings
[37:10] uh we labeled them as those five inlets
[37:12] to the soul and i think it's uh
[37:14] it's uh imagination memory conscience
[37:17] reason and affection
[37:19] and and these these kings as if it were
[37:21] or we we typed last week and then
[37:23] and then the gate to the cave being your
[37:25] self-will right
[37:26] that remembers that and if you weren't
[37:28] here now you're caught up so
[37:32] but last week we just got into a little
[37:34] bit of of uh of
[37:36] of what it is to battle our memory and
[37:38] what it is to battle our imagination but
[37:40] overall we're talking about
[37:41] battling our self-will and and really
[37:44] giving a full surrender to god that we
[37:46] can overcome our self-will and our
[37:48] self-decisions and our
[37:50] in our own it's not a mind over matter
[37:52] type type sermon but it's an actual
[37:54] faith in god's word that
[37:55] if we could just lay aside our own cares
[37:57] if we could lay aside our own reasons
[37:59] like joshua said here he said
[38:01] this this example that i'm giving you
[38:03] that you're putting your foot on the
[38:04] neck of these kings these great kings
[38:06] that everybody was so afraid of
[38:08] this example here he said but fear not
[38:11] nor be dismayed because every enemy that
[38:13] you come against
[38:15] you will be able to do this same exact
[38:16] thing too and i believe
[38:18] once we've conquered the devil and once
[38:19] we beat a devil and once we know what it
[38:21] feels like
[38:22] to have victory then it's much easier
[38:24] for us to enter into it the next time
[38:26] because we know
[38:27] that the word will work the same way it
[38:29] did on that one it will work on the next
[38:31] one and
[38:31] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[38:33] and forever and if he defeated that
[38:35] devil by the truth there
[38:36] he'll have to defeat the next devil by
[38:38] the same truth so if we could just
[38:40] if we could just look to these things
[38:42] and it be encouraging to us
[38:44] it's not it's not a a downer message or
[38:47] uh
[38:48] or a feel bad in ourselves message
[38:50] because we have a battle against
[38:51] self-will but
[38:52] it's a promise that god gave us that we
[38:54] can overcome these things and there will
[38:56] be a generation that will overcome these
[38:58] things and
[38:59] i believe i expressed that last week i
[39:01] believe we are that generation that will
[39:03] overcome these things and
[39:04] i believe we're seeing them overcome uh
[39:07] day by day i was so encouraged when i
[39:09] got done last week the brother back here
[39:11] told me that he was reading joshua 10 on
[39:12] the way to church and
[39:14] and how he was going over that very
[39:15] scripture i thought well the lord's
[39:17] in perfect control and and i know that
[39:19] he has a time and he has a season for
[39:22] for every person for every stage of life
[39:25] and sometimes the word
[39:26] might just be for a specific person in
[39:28] the building and maybe it didn't mean
[39:30] much to you at that time of life but
[39:32] somebody else is at a different season
[39:34] but
[39:34] but god is on time every time and i know
[39:38] that if we have a question or we have a
[39:40] desire or we have a longing for a deeper
[39:42] relationship with him
[39:44] he on time to answer that request
[39:46] tonight i
[39:47] i myself i i am being pulled
[39:51] more than i ever have been pulled to to
[39:53] live a fully surrendered life to god to
[39:56] to get rid of my own thoughts and to get
[39:58] rid of my my inabilities maybe we were
[40:00] born with
[40:01] or maybe you inherited down and you
[40:03] might have a certain personality or a
[40:05] certain nature because you were born
[40:07] that way with it
[40:08] but there's a season for everything to
[40:10] come out there's a season for
[40:12] for every king to be called out of the
[40:14] cave and to be put under your feet and
[40:16] a lot of times we're we're kind of set
[40:18] up in this life for failure by our own
[40:20] nature
[40:21] but god placed a victorious seat in
[40:23] there before there ever was
[40:24] a personality trait handed down before
[40:27] there ever was a nervous spirit that you
[40:29] maybe got from your
[40:30] your grandma or your grandpa or a lust
[40:32] spirit that you inherited from some
[40:34] family member before that was ever there
[40:36] god put a a a seed of victory inside of
[40:40] us
[40:40] and and that's what we're trying to dig
[40:42] down to we're not trying to overcome
[40:44] this by our mind or
[40:45] or by our own intellectual conception
[40:47] but we're trying to dig down deep enough
[40:49] so we can find that seed that god
[40:52] planted here
[40:53] before there ever was a trial before
[40:55] there ever was a rainy day before there
[40:56] ever was a mistake made in your life
[40:58] god put that seed in there and many
[41:02] times we have to we have to go through
[41:03] the desert and we have to walk a long
[41:05] walk before we realize
[41:07] that that we just need to surrender
[41:10] god has a very uh particular way of
[41:12] getting us to surrender and
[41:14] for moses he had to go through life for
[41:16] 40 years and
[41:17] and and learn all these smarts and
[41:18] educations and
[41:20] and how to how to control this and
[41:22] control that and just to find out that
[41:23] he would have to go wander in the desert
[41:25] for another 40 years and forget
[41:26] everything that he learned about it
[41:28] and paul would have to forget everything
[41:30] that he learned about in his life and
[41:32] and just become a surrendered vessel
[41:34] that he could be used by god and
[41:35] i don't think we're going to get there
[41:37] any different than that and
[41:38] so last week maybe we we we conquered
[41:41] the king of memory and we conquered the
[41:43] king of
[41:43] imagination but uh brother bannon would
[41:46] say that
[41:46] those those things that were given are
[41:48] all right as long as they line up with
[41:50] the word of god
[41:52] now our memory is a gift of god if it
[41:54] lines up with the word of god and our
[41:56] imagination can be used of god if it
[41:58] lines up with the word he says they're
[42:00] all right but if they disagree with the
[42:02] word
[42:02] don't you listen to them now
[42:04] imaginations conscious memories reasons
[42:07] and affections they're all right if they
[42:08] agree with the word but if your
[42:10] affection doesn't agree with the word
[42:12] then get rid of it you you blow a flu
[42:15] right quick
[42:17] remember last week we talked about
[42:18] cleaning out the channels
[42:20] if your reason disagrees with the word
[42:22] get away from it that's right the engine
[42:24] if your memory
[42:25] if your imaginations if your conscience
[42:27] anything disagrees
[42:28] with what's on the inside get rid of it
[42:31] what you got then you've you've got a
[42:33] solar system i like that
[42:35] a solar system it's god that set the
[42:38] stars in order and said hang
[42:40] there till i call you then stay there
[42:42] that nothing's going to move them
[42:44] when god can get a man in his hands till
[42:47] he can get senses conscience everything
[42:49] cleaned out
[42:50] until it stands with god behind it in
[42:52] the spirit
[42:53] there's not a devil in the world can
[42:55] poke a doubt in there that's right
[42:57] he come around and say you don't feel
[42:59] any better your conscience has even gone
[43:01] to that the flu is
[43:03] so clear it shouts hallelujah now i know
[43:05] that all of us have probably professed a
[43:07] healing in our life and then there the
[43:09] devil comes to say well you don't really
[43:11] feel any better but what the prophet is
[43:12] telling us there
[43:13] is look past what you feel and feel past
[43:16] what you feel it
[43:17] and look to the unseen realm that god
[43:19] promised that you would be healed
[43:21] and that's what he's speaking of
[43:22] clearing out a channel where we're not
[43:24] depending on what this feels like
[43:26] or what we can see with these natural
[43:27] lives but we know that there's a greater
[43:29] promise there
[43:30] that god said if they lay their hands on
[43:32] the sick
[43:33] they shall recover and that is a promise
[43:36] from god and we believe it's still in
[43:37] effect in this day
[43:38] and if god said it that settles it in my
[43:41] mind now
[43:42] now my my senses might argue with that
[43:44] they might say well what about this and
[43:45] what about that and they pull us this
[43:47] way in that way but if we can get that
[43:49] channel cleared out
[43:50] if we can get that flu cleared out and
[43:52] just have a have such a contact with god
[43:55] in our faith that we know
[43:57] no matter what it looks like it might be
[43:58] looking like it's pulling the other
[44:00] direction
[44:00] it might look like we can't get under it
[44:02] or we can't get around it we can't get
[44:04] over it but brother brahm said that's
[44:05] the time when you give in to self-will
[44:07] and you say lord
[44:08] i can't fight this anymore but i have
[44:10] faith that your word is true i have
[44:12] faith that you are god
[44:14] and you are a rewarder of those that
[44:16] diligently seek you
[44:17] and i seek after your face tonight and i
[44:20] don't know how i'm going to get through
[44:21] this situation
[44:22] but you promised that i would get
[44:24] through it and he said when those
[44:25] channels are gone
[44:26] when they're cleared out you could just
[44:28] say hallelujah enemy comes against you
[44:30] says well you don't feel any better
[44:32] your mind battle's not any better
[44:34] tonight than it was last week
[44:35] you just look past what you feel and get
[44:38] that channel cleaned out he said glory
[44:40] to god it shines out certainly just
[44:42] as clean and clear for the word of god
[44:44] to work through
[44:45] the power of god see that's the main
[44:47] thing we've got to give a way for the
[44:50] power of god to work in our life
[44:52] we can't have it filled with doubt and
[44:54] what ifs
[44:55] what about this it says that your
[44:58] battleground
[44:59] your battleground is back here at the
[45:01] beginning back here in the soul back in
[45:03] your mind
[45:04] that opens the mind is the gate
[45:09] rather your mind opens up and accepts
[45:11] the spirit or it rejects the spirit
[45:13] you can have little consciences and
[45:15] little feelings little sensations
[45:18] all these things but that has nothing to
[45:20] do with it
[45:21] that's just little sensations and things
[45:23] but when it comes to reality
[45:25] your mind opens it up your mind either
[45:28] accepts it or rejects it that's it
[45:30] friends
[45:31] he says oh god let none of them miss it
[45:34] that's where our battle is taking place
[45:36] it either is going to accept this
[45:38] or it's going to reject it we can't walk
[45:40] down the middle we can't stay on the
[45:41] fence we can't
[45:42] have one foot in and one foot out and
[45:44] and then we wonder why we're
[45:46] struggling in our life and we wonder why
[45:47] we can't seem to keep a victory in our
[45:49] life is because we have one foot in
[45:51] and one foot out but he said you'll
[45:53] either reject it or you'll receive it
[45:55] you'll either accept it or you'll deny
[45:57] it and so we have to make a decision
[45:58] remember we're talking about
[46:00] the weapon of choice it's in our hands
[46:03] uh this this battleground it's in our
[46:05] hands it's it's it's something that we
[46:06] are deciding
[46:08] with what we are going to choose we're
[46:10] going to choose
[46:11] what god has placed within our our life
[46:14] before there ever was a battleground
[46:16] now we have to recognize who we are and
[46:18] what's in there i believe we know that
[46:20] but he goes on to say what caused that
[46:22] because because eve never disbelieved it
[46:25] but she just
[46:26] took a reason that would be reasonable
[46:29] this would be all right
[46:30] and it caused every death every sickness
[46:32] every sorrow every heartache
[46:34] and how are we going to get back in if
[46:36] it caused if it cost 6 000 years of this
[46:39] how are we going to get back with
[46:41] anything less than
[46:42] every perfect word the way it's written
[46:45] the devil won the battle over the human
[46:47] race by reasoning with the human race
[46:49] just
[46:50] reason why it stands to reason this
[46:52] would be
[46:53] it stands to reason if the reasoning is
[46:56] contrary to the word then the reasoning
[46:58] the reason is wrong the word is right
[47:01] just the way it's written
[47:02] don't put any private interpretation to
[47:04] it just say
[47:05] it the way it's written and believe it
[47:07] like that see god has took care of it
[47:10] it's just exactly the way it's supposed
[47:13] to be
[47:14] so let's just believe it that way
[47:17] i think that sounds pretty simple right
[47:19] church let's just believe it the way
[47:21] it's written let's not put our own
[47:22] interpretation to it and i'm talking
[47:24] about your own
[47:25] your own imagination your own reason
[47:27] your own conscience your own affection
[47:29] and maybe you want don't want that to
[47:31] quite go this way because you have
[47:32] affection that's fighting against that
[47:34] but it's time to just take the word for
[47:36] what it says and don't put
[47:38] your own interpretation to a lot of
[47:39] times we throw that off on
[47:41] denominations or it's denominational
[47:43] move but i'm just talking to the
[47:44] individual tonight what about you
[47:47] you receive the word it can't put your
[47:49] own interpretation to it he says now
[47:51] it's the word every word the holy spirit
[47:54] in a man
[47:55] every sentence in the bible the holy
[47:56] spirit in you will punctuate it with an
[47:59] amen
[48:00] because the holy spirit wrote the bible
[48:02] and if he's in you
[48:04] how can he say well that was for another
[48:06] age or that was for this or that was for
[48:08] that
[48:09] how can he say that and be the holy
[48:11] spirit in you
[48:12] can't do it he has to say amen to it
[48:15] because he wrote it in the first place
[48:17] right
[48:17] so if we have the baptism of the holy
[48:19] ghost we can't do anything else but say
[48:22] him into this word
[48:23] so if we took on the headship of christ
[48:26] and we took on the baptism of the holy
[48:27] ghost
[48:28] we have surrendered our weapon of choice
[48:31] we have surrendered what we want and
[48:33] what we're going to dictate and we're
[48:34] just going to let god have his way how
[48:36] many would like
[48:36] god to have his way in your life how
[48:39] many would like god just to make every
[48:41] decision in your life or you wouldn't
[48:42] have to
[48:43] you wouldn't have to wander and you
[48:44] wouldn't have to guess and you wouldn't
[48:46] have to
[48:46] to play that game in your mind but you
[48:48] would know without a shadow of a doubt
[48:50] god chose this way for me and if you
[48:52] have that confidence
[48:53] let's just use this for example if god
[48:56] told me
[48:58] that i was gonna go fishing today and i
[49:00] was gonna catch five fish
[49:02] now it might sound crazy but what if god
[49:05] came down and he told me you're gonna
[49:06] catch five fish today
[49:07] you better believe i'm gonna buy a
[49:09] fishing pole
[49:11] and i'm gonna go out and i'm gonna go
[49:12] fishing i don't care where i'm at i'm
[49:14] gonna find a body of water why because
[49:16] god told me that now it might sound
[49:19] simple to us but
[49:20] but what about if god told you that
[49:22] you're going to overcome every
[49:23] circumstance in your life
[49:25] now a lot of times we walk through this
[49:27] life defeated and down and we're afraid
[49:30] and we're we're scared to reach out in
[49:31] our faith but god
[49:33] who created the stars and he created the
[49:35] galaxy and he created the earth and
[49:37] and he was here before there ever was a
[49:39] problem or there ever was a circumstance
[49:41] he told you as an individual that you
[49:44] will overcome
[49:46] every enemy that you face in this life
[49:48] every
[49:49] every situation that you can't seem to
[49:51] get through you will be an overcomer on
[49:53] the other side
[49:54] that's not a guesswork that's not a
[49:56] maybe so but i'm getting my fishing pole
[49:58] and i'm going fishing remember the story
[50:00] brother ma'am said when
[50:01] when there was a there was a woman sick
[50:03] and she was dying and they were having a
[50:04] war of whether
[50:05] let the catholic priests come in and do
[50:07] the blessings for death or whether they
[50:08] would let brother branham come in and
[50:09] pray for her and
[50:10] and you remember the story and and so
[50:13] they they decided let brother branham
[50:14] come in and pray and he waited on a
[50:16] vision waited on a vision and he said
[50:17] thus saith the lord shall live and the
[50:20] man says goodbye
[50:22] i'm going to get my house ready my
[50:24] wife's coming home tonight see if we
[50:25] could have that kind of faith
[50:27] in every promise that god gives now we
[50:30] have a thus saith the lord
[50:32] for every promise of god we don't need a
[50:34] man here to stand here and say
[50:36] that promise is for you as an individual
[50:38] but god said
[50:39] let there be light and there was light
[50:41] as he said let there be an overcomer
[50:43] there would be overcomers i believe we
[50:45] got to fulfill that prophecy in our life
[50:48] i believe we are the overcomers of this
[50:50] age we can't put it off for another age
[50:52] we can't put our own interpretation
[50:54] on it but we have to overcome that
[50:57] spirit of reason
[50:59] that's the that's the hardest one for us
[51:01] to overcome because it's how our mind
[51:03] works it's how we tick it's how we
[51:04] we go back and forth and you're probably
[51:07] reasoning why i'm up here right now
[51:08] and some of us are thinking thoughts a
[51:11] million miles away and some of us are in
[51:13] the moment and some of us have seven
[51:14] different thoughts going on at the same
[51:16] time
[51:16] but all that works together in in our
[51:19] our old nature it works together to
[51:21] fight the move of god
[51:24] but a surrendered life it can be used by
[51:26] the lord a surrender life
[51:28] it will be used for the purpose that it
[51:30] was given he says if it's the word
[51:32] it is so now we know we've got
[51:34] counterfeits everywhere that's right
[51:36] it's a battle
[51:37] you've got to know your enemy you've got
[51:40] to know your armor
[51:41] your armor is the word your enemy is
[51:43] something that will reason
[51:45] against it now i tell you dear you don't
[51:47] have to do this
[51:49] our church is the biggest church we got
[51:51] more uh-huh
[51:52] intellectual giants and you listen to
[51:54] him a few minutes he will have you so
[51:56] far away from the truth till you won't
[51:58] know where you're at
[52:00] that's right now we find this great
[52:01] enemy of god
[52:04] now as long as they will believe that
[52:05] word i can never get to them
[52:08] this is satan the great enemy of god as
[52:10] long as they believe that word i can
[52:11] never get to them as long as that little
[52:13] family in eden keeps behind that word
[52:15] i can never touch them neither can he
[52:18] today
[52:19] amen he's still blocked off that's right
[52:22] but if i can use some real good strategy
[52:25] and just reason it out i give some human
[52:28] reasonings because she's human if i can
[52:30] just give human reasonings then
[52:32] well well we'll win the battle satan and
[52:35] his angels but then
[52:36] eve gave away so therefore we know our
[52:40] enemy by his attacks
[52:42] maybe you didn't get it just right the
[52:43] way i said it we know our
[52:45] enemy when anyone any spirit
[52:49] any person tries to disagree with god's
[52:52] word
[52:53] are we in agreement remember that's
[52:56] your enemy that's your enemy he says it
[53:00] again
[53:01] we know his old attack that's the one he
[53:04] broke the human race down with
[53:06] and that's the way he breaks them down
[53:08] yet today and that's the way he gets you
[53:10] away from god
[53:11] is to disbelieve his word and the only
[53:14] way that you can ever stay in fellowship
[53:15] with god
[53:16] and talk to him in the cool the evening
[53:18] is to stay
[53:19] fortified in the word on both sides
[53:23] let the curtain of god's word drop all
[53:25] around you and be a drop
[53:26] right in the middle of it that's right
[53:28] then you're fortified
[53:31] another message you would see well
[53:33] what's my subject it's the conflict i'm
[53:35] just laying it foundation and then we'll
[53:36] we'll parachute quick i'm not going to
[53:38] keep you a long time the conflict satan
[53:40] tries to get you to
[53:42] reason about it and don't you do it
[53:45] you'll probably hear be sick of these
[53:46] quotes about not reasoning but
[53:48] you will never say that nobody told you
[53:51] and don't you do it but after you become
[53:53] a christian
[53:55] then you are fortified by the word and
[53:57] any promise
[53:58] in the word didn't know i was going to
[54:00] say that
[54:01] i'm just going to say it again but after
[54:03] you become a christian
[54:05] then you are fortified by the word and
[54:08] any promise in the word remember last
[54:10] week when i read that quote about
[54:11] no man has a right to preach the gospel
[54:13] unless first he's met god face to face
[54:15] and then he says
[54:16] and no person has the right to call
[54:18] themselves a christian
[54:19] unless they've met god face to face on
[54:21] the sacred sand so then he says once you
[54:24] become a christian
[54:26] then you are fortified by the word and
[54:28] any promise in the word
[54:30] you are when you become a christian
[54:32] you're placed behind the word of god
[54:34] now there's your fortress your safety oh
[54:37] my every promise in that is yours
[54:40] only thing you have to do is just reach
[54:42] and get it and go right on with it
[54:44] how you know it's going to work i don't
[54:46] know how it's going to work
[54:48] i don't know the only thing i know that
[54:49] god gave his children the best attack
[54:52] that they could have
[54:53] and the best thing to attack with
[54:55] because he knows
[54:56] the working of the enemy this message is
[55:00] the most powerful weapon
[55:01] on the face of the earth the devil hates
[55:03] this message with everything that he's
[55:05] got
[55:06] he's throwing reason in your mind he's
[55:08] throwing reason at your family
[55:09] he's throwing reason at the church he's
[55:11] throwing reason at somebody you know
[55:13] because he hates this message with
[55:16] everything that he's got why because it
[55:18] is the attack that god gave the bride in
[55:21] this age
[55:22] there is no other weapon that will
[55:23] defeat him in this stage but the message
[55:25] of this age it can't come another way
[55:28] it's not going to be in another time
[55:30] it didn't come in years past we didn't
[55:31] miss it but it's right here
[55:34] right now the weapon of this age will
[55:36] defeat the enemy
[55:38] of this age there is no other way for
[55:41] him to be defeated
[55:42] you will not defeat him mind over matter
[55:45] or by intellectual conceptions or
[55:47] by if that was the case we could all
[55:48] just go move to dallas and go to church
[55:50] with brother joel
[55:51] but it's not by our thinking or by our
[55:53] intellectuals
[55:54] but it's by the word of god and god has
[55:57] a season for the word to come out
[56:00] and be revealed and i believe we are
[56:02] living in the season of revelation and i
[56:04] believe we are in the season of a
[56:06] manifested word
[56:07] where it's not just words on a page or
[56:10] some testimonies of a kentuckian
[56:12] but it's right now in a flesh life where
[56:14] we can walk it and we can
[56:16] talk it and we can feel it and we can
[56:17] touch it and we see
[56:19] it happening in our life one step at a
[56:21] time of course the devil's against us
[56:24] of course he's raging against us with
[56:26] everything it's not just you sitting
[56:27] there
[56:28] it's me and it's your neighbor it's the
[56:29] one next to you and the one thing that
[56:31] we all have in common is the devil is
[56:33] trying to fight us right now in this
[56:34] moment
[56:35] why because he's scared of what you
[56:38] possess he's not scared of you
[56:39] he's not scared of your words he's not
[56:41] scared of your your power or your
[56:43] strength
[56:44] he's scared of what you possess and what
[56:46] you possess
[56:47] is the vindicated word of god in this
[56:50] hour there is
[56:51] nothing that scares him more than that
[56:52] now maybe i'm going a little fast here
[56:54] but that just
[56:55] energizes me because i know that despite
[56:58] my mistakes
[56:59] despite my faults or my insecurities or
[57:02] my inabilities
[57:03] this word will prevail no matter what
[57:05] this word will overcome every devil no
[57:08] matter what
[57:09] this word has already defeated every
[57:12] enemy
[57:12] even death itself and what do we have to
[57:15] fear if death is defeated there's
[57:16] nothing else to fear because we know
[57:18] where we're going
[57:19] if he should come and take me today i'm
[57:21] not afraid of death because it's just a
[57:23] gateway
[57:24] to the fulfillment of this word this
[57:26] word trumps all
[57:28] this word goes before everything
[57:32] and he gave it to the church
[57:36] the word why did he give it to the
[57:37] church because the word
[57:39] is eternal and if god made a promise
[57:41] that is eternal there's nothing nowhere
[57:44] can stop it
[57:45] turn every atom upside down and turn it
[57:47] backwards could never
[57:49] pierce the word of god one little word
[57:50] see because jesus said both heavens and
[57:52] earth will pass away
[57:54] but my word shall never fail see it's
[57:56] the best
[57:57] weapon there is it's the word of the
[58:00] eternal god
[58:01] now what is the word of god the word of
[58:04] god
[58:04] is god himself so god gave the believer
[58:08] himself amen it's god himself he gave
[58:12] the believer himself to attack the enemy
[58:14] by
[58:15] in other words he's the father and the
[58:18] word is god
[58:19] then the word is our father we're born
[58:22] by the word and he's standing in the
[58:25] forefront of his children
[58:26] there you are he's standing out there
[58:28] for his children
[58:29] what are we scared about the rapture is
[58:32] sure the coming is sure
[58:34] every blessing that's been promised us
[58:36] is ours it all belongs to us
[58:40] i take that and i'll run with it i'll
[58:42] take that and i'll i'll defeat every
[58:44] enemy in front of me and
[58:45] if it didn't get him the first time i'll
[58:47] just whack him again with it every
[58:48] promise
[58:49] is mine every chapter every verse
[58:52] every line every promise is mine and if
[58:55] he doesn't move
[58:56] just hit him with it again and if he
[58:58] doesn't move just hit him with it again
[59:00] because you know this word will prevail
[59:02] despite your own inabilities despite
[59:05] your own flaws
[59:06] this word will prevail against the gates
[59:09] of hell they tried to come against it
[59:11] and they tried everything they had
[59:12] but it's already been proven that this
[59:15] word wins
[59:16] every time so if we're fortified behind
[59:20] the word
[59:20] we can't lose if we're fortified behind
[59:23] the word there's nothing
[59:25] that can stop this move there's nothing
[59:27] that can stop the bride
[59:28] because we are fortified behind the
[59:30] greatest the greatest weapon that there
[59:33] ever has been on the earth
[59:34] and it is the weapon of this word it's
[59:37] not just
[59:37] gentle and meek and kind but it has a
[59:40] double-edged sword in it and it will cut
[59:41] down every enemy
[59:43] that stands within your path it will cut
[59:45] down every
[59:46] every reason in your mind every
[59:48] imagination that it will cast down
[59:50] it will cut down every foe that you're
[59:52] fighting in your life today i know
[59:54] because it's fulfilled in this hour
[1:00:00] that's the very thing our faith is based
[1:00:02] on that the word
[1:00:03] will overcome oh
[1:00:07] satan might say come around over on this
[1:00:09] side and i'll reason it out with you
[1:00:11] uh oh you got behind the father then see
[1:00:15] don't you do that you stay right there
[1:00:16] where the father stands right where it
[1:00:18] says
[1:00:19] it's thus saith the father see thus
[1:00:22] saith my father thus saith my father
[1:00:24] it's going to defeat him as sure as the
[1:00:26] world
[1:00:27] it's got to all right but when you get
[1:00:29] out from behind that
[1:00:31] like eve did the battle is lost
[1:00:35] now poor eve she listened she lost her
[1:00:37] place
[1:00:39] she got out from behind the fortress now
[1:00:42] you think about that and
[1:00:44] just put it into it put it into
[1:00:46] something that we can make tangible
[1:00:47] and and we have a we have a fort that is
[1:00:50] impenetrable
[1:00:52] there's no way you can get in there's no
[1:00:54] way that you can overcome it there's no
[1:00:55] way that you can break through the gate
[1:00:57] there's no way they've tried and tried
[1:00:58] and tried to try
[1:01:00] but but as soon as we step out from that
[1:01:02] fortress
[1:01:03] as soon as we step out from that fort
[1:01:05] then we're out from under the protection
[1:01:07] of it
[1:01:07] we're just out there vulnerable and
[1:01:09] we're just on our own and it's real
[1:01:11] quick we find out how weak we are when
[1:01:12] we step
[1:01:13] out from under the word when i would try
[1:01:16] to do good
[1:01:17] evil is always present and as soon as i
[1:01:19] slack off on the things of god
[1:01:21] boom it seems like i just go right back
[1:01:23] to where i was before
[1:01:25] now i'm not just saying that about you
[1:01:27] that's our that's our walk
[1:01:28] but see he says it's your mind that
[1:01:31] opens the door
[1:01:32] or closes the door and listens to your
[1:01:34] conscience
[1:01:35] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:01:37] affections but when your mind closes
[1:01:40] itself to these things
[1:01:41] and let god the spirit of his word come
[1:01:44] in it blows the rest of the stuff
[1:01:46] out every doubt is gone every fear is
[1:01:49] gone every sensation of doubt is gone
[1:01:51] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:01:53] standing there but the word of god and
[1:01:56] satan cannot battle against that no sir
[1:01:59] he cannot battle against it
[1:02:00] now we know that's true these battles
[1:02:03] has raged since the day of the garden of
[1:02:05] eden the
[1:02:06] battle of the human mind satan started
[1:02:08] it what did he do
[1:02:09] when he met eve he he didn't deny god's
[1:02:11] word but he whitewashed it
[1:02:14] he stopped up some little channels here
[1:02:16] somewhere he said
[1:02:18] he said but surely god had not said
[1:02:20] stopped up some little channels
[1:02:22] somewhere
[1:02:23] got in the way just a little put a bit
[1:02:24] of a little log in the way and
[1:02:26] and and and and dammed up our our our
[1:02:29] walk with god
[1:02:30] and he put a little blockage there in
[1:02:32] the channel remember i think we
[1:02:33] referenced that last week about the
[1:02:34] message getting in the spirit brother
[1:02:35] graham says
[1:02:36] you got to blow the logs out of the
[1:02:37] channel you got to clear out every log
[1:02:39] in the channel and
[1:02:40] you got to you sometimes you got to dig
[1:02:42] pretty deep to clear out your old
[1:02:43] your old affections and your old
[1:02:45] imagination and your old reasons
[1:02:47] you got to dig pretty deep and and
[1:02:48] brother branham would bring in the
[1:02:50] scripture
[1:02:50] uh dig this valley full of ditches right
[1:02:52] and he would say that
[1:02:53] that jehoshaphat there he was he was
[1:02:56] partnered up
[1:02:57] with the king of israel uh jeroboam i
[1:02:59] think it was or jerome
[1:03:00] and and they came together in a
[1:03:02] partnership now one of them was a
[1:03:04] righteous man and one of them was just a
[1:03:06] hypocrite pretending
[1:03:07] to have the faith right we're not going
[1:03:09] to go back and read it i know we all
[1:03:11] know the story and so they end up
[1:03:13] unevenly yoked on this venture together
[1:03:16] and
[1:03:16] and a lot of times that's how it works
[1:03:17] when you're a good righteous person
[1:03:19] and there'll be somebody there that
[1:03:21] wants to attach on to that because they
[1:03:23] know that
[1:03:23] that you're righteous and god will hear
[1:03:25] you and so they'll attach themselves
[1:03:27] onto you but
[1:03:28] in reality they're just bringing you
[1:03:29] down and so you got to be mindful of
[1:03:31] that when we walk through life and maybe
[1:03:33] that was
[1:03:33] for you young brothers here or somebody
[1:03:35] out there but
[1:03:36] but you can't be unevenly yoked and walk
[1:03:39] in the perfect will of god
[1:03:40] and so they find themselves out in the
[1:03:42] desert and they find themselves in
[1:03:44] and and they've gone out on this trip
[1:03:45] and they've they've prepared and they've
[1:03:47] thought about battle and they've brought
[1:03:48] their
[1:03:49] weapons and they brought their swords
[1:03:51] and they brought everything that they
[1:03:52] could think of
[1:03:53] to get out there and battle but you know
[1:03:54] what they forgot one thing and it was
[1:03:56] the water
[1:03:58] they started out an adventure through
[1:03:59] the desert and they forgot to pack water
[1:04:01] for them and for their camels and for
[1:04:03] their animals and there they are out in
[1:04:05] the middle of nowhere
[1:04:06] and they've run out of water and
[1:04:08] sometimes that's how we end up in our
[1:04:10] own spiritual walk is
[1:04:12] we'll have made it seven days journey
[1:04:13] like they did and then they realized we
[1:04:15] don't have water and a lot of times
[1:04:16] we'll come to church
[1:04:18] and we'll play the part and we'll we'll
[1:04:19] sing the songs and we say amen but then
[1:04:22] we find out i don't really have the holy
[1:04:24] spirit with me or it's
[1:04:25] i left it back somewhere i don't have it
[1:04:27] like i used to have it or
[1:04:29] i i realized that i have i need more of
[1:04:31] it and so they found themselves in that
[1:04:33] condition
[1:04:34] and and we know the whole story won't go
[1:04:36] through it and they call on the word of
[1:04:37] the
[1:04:37] the prophet of the lord and he comes and
[1:04:40] there's so much there to preach on but
[1:04:41] we'll just
[1:04:43] we'll just get to the point he says make
[1:04:45] this valley full of ditches
[1:04:47] now that doesn't make sense in your
[1:04:50] reason
[1:04:51] that doesn't make sense in your mind
[1:04:52] that you would go out and use the last
[1:04:54] little bit of strength you have to go
[1:04:56] out and dig
[1:04:56] holes in the middle of the desert but
[1:04:58] that's what the prophet said to do
[1:05:00] and then brother branham would use a
[1:05:02] type of of a soldier going out there and
[1:05:04] he would begin to
[1:05:05] he began to dig out his ditch and he
[1:05:07] says there he would find
[1:05:09] an old coffee pot or an old tea kettle
[1:05:12] or
[1:05:13] or some old thing an old cobblestone
[1:05:15] down there that was from prior
[1:05:17] civilizations now we might just read
[1:05:19] over that but it really talks a lot
[1:05:20] about our struggle in
[1:05:22] life there's a lot of things in there
[1:05:24] that we didn't put there
[1:05:25] we didn't put that coffee pot in there
[1:05:27] we didn't put that cobblestone in there
[1:05:29] but here's this soldier is he's digging
[1:05:31] down in the dirt and he's hitting things
[1:05:32] that he didn't bury there
[1:05:33] but he's got to dig him out of the way
[1:05:35] to have a clear channel and so maybe you
[1:05:37] didn't put that mind battle in there and
[1:05:39] you inherited it
[1:05:40] and you and you got it somewhere and you
[1:05:42] picked it up along the way and you never
[1:05:43] planted it in there but you have to dig
[1:05:45] it out
[1:05:46] you have to take a shovel and you got to
[1:05:48] dig it out by the word of god because
[1:05:49] there's no other way he said if you just
[1:05:51] dig
[1:05:51] if you just dig this much that's all the
[1:05:53] water you're going to have but if you
[1:05:55] can dig this much then that's all the
[1:05:56] water you can have you can be full of
[1:05:58] the water
[1:05:59] but if we're not full of the spirit of
[1:06:01] god we've got to get the shovel out
[1:06:03] does that make sense if we're not full
[1:06:05] of the spirit of god like we want to be
[1:06:07] we got some more digging to do we have
[1:06:10] some more things to surrender we got
[1:06:11] some more self-will to give up we gotta
[1:06:13] we gotta dig down a little deeper now
[1:06:15] it's not your fault you you were born
[1:06:17] with that
[1:06:18] maybe you were born with that nervous
[1:06:19] spirit or you were you were born with
[1:06:21] that that depression upon you but you've
[1:06:23] got to dig it out you can't just leave
[1:06:25] it there
[1:06:25] it's stopping your water from flowing
[1:06:28] it's stopping your revival from coming
[1:06:30] we've got to take the shovel
[1:06:32] of the word of god and dig it out now i
[1:06:33] know that's that's a rough analogy but
[1:06:35] that's the way the prophet brought it
[1:06:37] we've got to make the valley full of
[1:06:39] ditches and you know what happened they
[1:06:40] dug it out and they dug it out and they
[1:06:42] toiled with it and they ward with it
[1:06:44] and the next day when they woke up the
[1:06:46] whole valley was full of water why
[1:06:48] because they
[1:06:48] surrendered their self-will to the word
[1:06:51] of god they surrendered what they
[1:06:53] thought was the right thing to do
[1:06:54] to what the prophet of god said to do
[1:06:56] and it ought he
[1:06:57] god honored that move by filling that
[1:06:59] full of water we
[1:07:00] we know the rest of the story that when
[1:07:02] the kings their enemies looked out upon
[1:07:04] him
[1:07:05] they just saw seas of red and i think
[1:07:07] that's a prime example of how when the
[1:07:09] enemy looks at us
[1:07:10] he cannot see past the blood of christ
[1:07:12] as long as we stay in this fortress
[1:07:14] as long as we stay behind the word he
[1:07:17] can't see us
[1:07:18] he can't get to us he can't touch us
[1:07:20] there's nothing he can do to us because
[1:07:22] we're under
[1:07:23] the fortress of the word of god but
[1:07:25] we've got to make
[1:07:26] a total surrender it's no coincidence
[1:07:30] that we're seeing a second crucifixion
[1:07:31] of the word of god in this age
[1:07:33] a total surrender it's not going to be
[1:07:36] any different than it was when you could
[1:07:38] just imagine how
[1:07:39] christ what he must have heard
[1:07:42] going down the the road of golgotha and
[1:07:45] and and all the things that were said
[1:07:47] and people that maybe had followed him
[1:07:49] and heard him preach and
[1:07:50] and were there for the miracles and they
[1:07:52] ate the bread with the five thousand and
[1:07:54] they were lepers that were healed and
[1:07:56] they were they were they were blind that
[1:07:58] could see and there they see him
[1:07:59] dragging his cross down the road and and
[1:08:01] they would say see i
[1:08:02] i told you he wasn't a prophet i told
[1:08:05] you that he was just a man and
[1:08:07] i told you it was just emotion or it was
[1:08:09] just a sensation and
[1:08:10] and there he is dragging his cross
[1:08:12] fulfilling the very thing
[1:08:14] that they're speaking about it's no it's
[1:08:18] no
[1:08:18] coincidence that we're facing the same
[1:08:20] thing in this hour i told you it was
[1:08:22] just some emotion or
[1:08:23] it was just a lot of hype or there was
[1:08:25] no factual things behind it and the very
[1:08:27] people
[1:08:28] that that maybe were blessed by the
[1:08:30] message of the hour coming are now
[1:08:32] turning their back on it why because it
[1:08:33] was prophesied
[1:08:34] that they'll crucify him again but there
[1:08:37] were people
[1:08:38] that still recognized them as the coming
[1:08:40] christ
[1:08:41] as the christ that was bearing the sins
[1:08:43] of the world that was taking them to the
[1:08:45] cross
[1:08:45] that would be their eternal destination
[1:08:48] they were watching their eternal ticket
[1:08:50] walk down the road of galgotha they
[1:08:53] couldn't carry it
[1:08:54] they couldn't bear it but it was the
[1:08:55] word becoming manifest
[1:08:57] and i see that in this day i see this
[1:09:00] message
[1:09:01] being my eternal ticket over there there
[1:09:04] is nowhere else i can look to there
[1:09:06] is nowhere else i'm interested in
[1:09:07] hearing from but i know that i
[1:09:09] came in contact when i recognized this
[1:09:12] as eagle food
[1:09:13] i came in contact with a supernatural
[1:09:15] being that is a me
[1:09:17] that's somewhere out there that i know
[1:09:19] that god had in his mind
[1:09:20] before the foundation of the world and
[1:09:22] when i came into this message
[1:09:24] that made contact with me and no matter
[1:09:27] what
[1:09:27] devil tries to break that out of me you
[1:09:29] cannot take that from me
[1:09:31] why because i've overcome that choice
[1:09:35] this is the truth if god puts me in hell
[1:09:37] tomorrow
[1:09:38] this is the truth i will stand on this
[1:09:41] word
[1:09:42] there is nowhere else there is not
[1:09:44] another foundation
[1:09:45] there is nowhere else to run to i'm not
[1:09:48] going to be reasoned out of it why
[1:09:49] because i was given a revelation
[1:09:52] before there ever was a mind to battle
[1:09:54] before there ever was a battleground
[1:09:56] chosen this word was put in my heart
[1:10:01] the devil can try a real believer cannot
[1:10:05] run from this
[1:10:06] he can't walk away you can try you can
[1:10:09] backslide
[1:10:10] you can back up you can sin you can you
[1:10:12] can depart from the ways you can run
[1:10:14] from your parents you can run this way
[1:10:16] you could
[1:10:16] but you cannot leave this word because
[1:10:18] god will not
[1:10:20] lose a one he cannot forget them
[1:10:23] he has not forsaken them there is not a
[1:10:26] prodigal out there that he can't touch
[1:10:28] there is not a situation out there that
[1:10:30] he can't reach down and just at any
[1:10:32] moment
[1:10:33] activate that gene scene in that person
[1:10:35] he did it for me
[1:10:37] friends i wasn't looking for him when he
[1:10:39] activated it in me i was running
[1:10:41] i was a hypocrite i was looking for
[1:10:43] anything but this life
[1:10:45] and he came down and activated that seat
[1:10:47] in me why because he won't
[1:10:49] lose one he can't it's part of him
[1:10:54] they're just as much part of him as as
[1:10:56] this is my arm i'm not going to forget
[1:10:58] about it i don't know
[1:10:59] i know where it's at all the time and he
[1:11:01] knows exactly
[1:11:03] where you are you might be looking to
[1:11:06] run the opposite direction but god has
[1:11:08] other plans for you
[1:11:09] and when god interrupts your plans it's
[1:11:12] a supernatural event
[1:11:14] all reason cast down all imagination
[1:11:17] casts down
[1:11:18] your affections cast down no wonder why
[1:11:21] we're fighting such a battle in this age
[1:11:22] with affections
[1:11:24] the bible speaks about it man turning
[1:11:26] away from natural affections
[1:11:28] and many of it's sneaking into the
[1:11:30] church
[1:11:31] now maybe it might get a little a little
[1:11:33] tight a little rough here but but it's
[1:11:35] got to be preached about it
[1:11:36] somebody's got to take a stand i'm not
[1:11:38] just going to put it back on the prophet
[1:11:39] and push play
[1:11:40] let him say it but i'll i'll take the
[1:11:42] same stand he's
[1:11:43] he stood for because i believe it is the
[1:11:46] word and we cannot let that little devil
[1:11:48] come in here
[1:11:48] and just make us slide a little bit when
[1:11:50] did the men of god be
[1:11:52] more concerned about how they look than
[1:11:54] how they approach the father when did we
[1:11:56] become more concerned about
[1:11:57] about fitting in with the fashion world
[1:11:59] it's not just on the women
[1:12:01] it's in men wearing designers that are
[1:12:05] owned by homosexual people and
[1:12:07] and wearing clothes that are designed by
[1:12:09] by perverted spirits and it snuck his
[1:12:11] way into the church and to our young
[1:12:13] people and
[1:12:14] and and we just deal with it i'm not
[1:12:17] going to deal with that i'm going to
[1:12:18] preach the gospel i'm going to preach
[1:12:20] the truth and
[1:12:20] even if it hurts my own flesh and blood
[1:12:23] i'm gonna preach the truth of this
[1:12:24] gospel
[1:12:26] we shouldn't lighten up we shouldn't let
[1:12:28] up we shouldn't it's not time to let off
[1:12:29] the gloves it's not time to
[1:12:31] to let the pressure up but it's time to
[1:12:33] preach the word without favor
[1:12:35] without natural affection our affection
[1:12:38] turning from
[1:12:39] from from from having an affection
[1:12:41] towards god towards
[1:12:43] anything else anything that exalteth
[1:12:46] itself
[1:12:47] above the lord we've got to overcome
[1:12:50] that affection
[1:12:52] we've got to overcome that reason it's
[1:12:54] time to draw the king out of the cave
[1:12:57] i like how joshua did it put your foot
[1:12:59] right on the neck of that you know why
[1:13:01] because once
[1:13:02] can you imagine being the other four men
[1:13:03] of war that he called and the first one
[1:13:05] comes up and he grabs the king of
[1:13:06] jerusalem out of there
[1:13:07] and he throws him on the ground and he
[1:13:09] puts his foot on their neck
[1:13:11] and the other four say you can do that
[1:13:13] you can put him under your foot
[1:13:15] you can take that mighty king that that
[1:13:17] we've been running from
[1:13:18] and we've been scared of and we've been
[1:13:20] afraid of and you can put them under
[1:13:21] your foot
[1:13:23] oh yeah and those other four i bet ran
[1:13:25] up to those other kings and grabbed him
[1:13:27] i got something to say to you
[1:13:29] i know i've been battling you for 33
[1:13:31] years this reason
[1:13:33] and this imagination and this affection
[1:13:35] it's time for you to come under my foot
[1:13:37] i don't know how old everybody else in
[1:13:39] here but that's how long i've been
[1:13:40] battling mine
[1:13:41] we got to put them under our feet and
[1:13:43] say i'm surrendering
[1:13:44] everything that i am i want to get rid
[1:13:46] of every bit of self-will
[1:13:48] the power of your choice has held you
[1:13:50] back from a complete victory
[1:13:52] i can say that from my own experience
[1:13:54] the power if you would have chose that
[1:13:56] years ago
[1:13:57] you'd be so much further down the road
[1:13:59] and i know there's veterans in here and
[1:14:01] elder people but
[1:14:02] if the shoe doesn't fit just say amen
[1:14:06] we've got to surrender our self-will
[1:14:11] it's the only thing that'll liberate us
[1:14:13] it's the only thing that'll free us
[1:14:15] we're never going to just wake up one
[1:14:16] day and be satisfied
[1:14:18] with our own our own ambitions or our
[1:14:20] own goals or our own imaginations we're
[1:14:22] not
[1:14:23] it's not just going to change that way
[1:14:24] but we've got to surrender our self-will
[1:14:26] to god's will if we can surrender what
[1:14:29] we want
[1:14:30] to what he wants you can wake up and say
[1:14:33] his mercies are new today
[1:14:35] his mercies are new today i feel the
[1:14:37] goodness of god in my life i feel
[1:14:39] his presence all around me why because
[1:14:41] your will is dead
[1:14:44] i know that hurts us tonight it's the
[1:14:46] hardest thing that we have to do is to
[1:14:48] kill our own will
[1:14:49] but it's the only way we're gonna make
[1:14:50] it
[1:14:55] i know if you think i'm taking off my
[1:14:56] jacket means i'm going long but i'm not
[1:15:03] we've got to possess every gate
[1:15:07] now we're not going to do it by our own
[1:15:09] power
[1:15:10] we're not going to do it by i'm just
[1:15:12] going to push through this i'm going to
[1:15:13] i'm going to prevail through this i'm
[1:15:14] going to fast for two weeks and
[1:15:16] i don't care what it takes i'm going to
[1:15:17] overcome this but if we could just make
[1:15:19] a surrender
[1:15:20] if we could say god i want to make a
[1:15:22] total surrender to you i want to take
[1:15:25] humility like i've never taken it on
[1:15:27] before that's the hardest thing i think
[1:15:29] for us
[1:15:29] old-time christians to do is take on the
[1:15:32] real humility and say you know what
[1:15:34] i need more of god i might have been
[1:15:38] coming to church and sitting in a pew
[1:15:39] for 40 years
[1:15:41] i need more of god i've got to have more
[1:15:44] of his spirit
[1:15:45] i've got to i've got to have more of him
[1:15:47] making my decisions i've got to have
[1:15:49] liberty
[1:15:50] because if there's not liberty then you
[1:15:51] might as well give me death if
[1:15:53] if i can't have liberty in my walk with
[1:15:55] god if i can't have liberty to praise
[1:15:56] him
[1:15:57] no wonder why their spirits coming
[1:15:59] against the movement of the spirit in
[1:16:00] the church and saying that we can't have
[1:16:02] liberty in our worship and
[1:16:03] that we're only allowed to sing these
[1:16:05] songs and we're not allowed to play
[1:16:06] drums and
[1:16:07] we're not allowed to clap and we're not
[1:16:08] allowed to sing and we're not allowed to
[1:16:10] say hallelujah no wonder why there's a
[1:16:12] spirit coming against it because it
[1:16:13] hates
[1:16:14] liberty it hates liberation in the
[1:16:17] children of god
[1:16:18] and i rebuke that spirit in the name of
[1:16:20] the lord jesus christ to say that you
[1:16:22] cannot have
[1:16:23] my liberty you cannot take my freedom
[1:16:26] you can lock me up into jail like paul
[1:16:29] and silas
[1:16:29] but you will not take my praise you will
[1:16:32] not take my worship you will not
[1:16:34] take my song even if you if you bind me
[1:16:36] up in chains i'll sing till the walls
[1:16:38] come down why
[1:16:39] because i know who my maker is
[1:16:42] and you and your jail and your chains
[1:16:45] are no match for him
[1:16:47] they are no match and he does he he
[1:16:49] deserves more worship
[1:16:51] now in my situation chained to the wall
[1:16:55] put yourself in paul's shoes standing
[1:16:57] for his word
[1:16:58] oh you think he would just come down
[1:17:00] with a shout and just
[1:17:02] grab paul before they captured him and
[1:17:03] there he is in jail
[1:17:06] chained to the wall he says you know
[1:17:08] what silas
[1:17:11] god's been so good to us
[1:17:14] i can just imagine paul and silas there
[1:17:16] just just sharing testimonies
[1:17:19] of god
[1:17:22] just a little chorus come up hmm
[1:17:32] how sweet
[1:17:33] [Music]
[1:17:35] the sound and then silas chime in
[1:17:40] that had saved
[1:17:46] like me
[1:17:50] i once
[1:17:53] was lost
[1:17:56] but now i'm found
[1:18:02] oh i was blind remember this is paul
[1:18:04] singing
[1:18:05] but now i
[1:18:09] see and they can just hear
[1:18:12] and the walls begin to shake and the
[1:18:14] other prisoners begin to what's going on
[1:18:16] around us and what's happening around us
[1:18:18] but what was happening was the son of
[1:18:20] god was making contact with his maker
[1:18:23] he deserves the praise no matter what
[1:18:25] spirits you're you're fighting he
[1:18:26] deserves the praise
[1:18:27] no matter what much you're crawling
[1:18:29] through he deserves the praise no matter
[1:18:31] what affliction you're fighting today
[1:18:33] he deserves our praise and no spirit is
[1:18:36] gonna take that from me
[1:18:37] no no no person is going to dictate to
[1:18:39] me how i praise my god
[1:18:41] because he deserves everything that i
[1:18:43] can give him
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] and we know they went free why because
[1:18:49] their chains were gone
[1:18:50] that song broke right through their
[1:18:52] chains my if we could just try that
[1:18:54] friends if we could just get out of our
[1:18:55] comfort zone in the way that we're
[1:18:57] comfortable worshiping and
[1:18:58] in the way that we're we just have a
[1:19:00] limit and that's as far as we'll go but
[1:19:02] if we could ever break past that
[1:19:04] god will break every chain that we have
[1:19:06] if we could ever get past
[1:19:08] the way that we're comfortable
[1:19:09] worshiping the lord he will break every
[1:19:11] bind that we have
[1:19:12] he will break every chain he will break
[1:19:14] every wall he will even tear down the
[1:19:17] stronghold of the enemy
[1:19:18] and others around us will go free it
[1:19:20] wasn't just paul and silas that escaped
[1:19:23] but everybody around him broke free out
[1:19:24] of that jail why because the praises of
[1:19:27] god
[1:19:27] will break free from every yoke of this
[1:19:30] world
[1:19:31] if we could just get past our comfort
[1:19:33] zone and say god you're worthy no matter
[1:19:35] what i'm going through
[1:19:36] you're worthy give me liberty or give me
[1:19:39] death
[1:19:40] i don't want to just walk this way and
[1:19:42] crawl my way through and just
[1:19:44] wowzy wowzy woo and woe is me and maybe
[1:19:47] i'm going to make it and
[1:19:48] tomorrow i'm not even a christian and
[1:19:50] the next day i come to church and maybe
[1:19:51] i'm gonna make it
[1:19:52] no but give me liberty or give me death
[1:19:55] let me know who i
[1:19:56] am let me know where i stand let me have
[1:19:58] a revelation to see that my eyes are
[1:20:01] open
[1:20:01] and though he should slay me yet i'll
[1:20:04] trust him
[1:20:05] though he should cast me in hell yet
[1:20:07] i'll love him because i know
[1:20:09] that he is my maker and there is none
[1:20:12] beside him
[1:20:13] no one else is going to get my praise
[1:20:14] with him
[1:20:16] he deserves every breath that we are oh
[1:20:18] david would say
[1:20:19] let everything that have breath praise
[1:20:22] ye
[1:20:22] the lord because he recognized my
[1:20:26] mistakes
[1:20:27] it doesn't matter what my mistakes are
[1:20:28] they're going to happen tomorrow
[1:20:30] but he deserves my praise
[1:20:33] he deserves my praise he's always on
[1:20:36] time
[1:20:37] paul and silas weren't worried they
[1:20:39] weren't afraid that he wasn't on
[1:20:40] schedule
[1:20:41] but right in that moment he showed up on
[1:20:44] time
[1:20:44] and and no brick wall stopped him no
[1:20:46] chain stopped him no guard stopped him
[1:20:48] but when god
[1:20:49] wants to wake up that seed when god
[1:20:52] wants to make a supernatural meeting
[1:20:54] with you
[1:20:54] there's no building that can stop him
[1:20:56] there's no spirit that can stop him
[1:20:58] there's no there's no demon in hell that
[1:21:00] can stop him there's nothing that can
[1:21:02] stop
[1:21:03] god from reaching one of his children we
[1:21:05] got to recognize who we are
[1:21:07] say lord i'm your child i have need of
[1:21:10] you
[1:21:11] i'm in a situation i don't know how to
[1:21:13] get around it i don't know how to get
[1:21:14] through it i've tried to
[1:21:15] ignore it i've tried to set it aside but
[1:21:17] it still keeps coming back
[1:21:19] just sing his praises and watch him show
[1:21:21] up on the scene
[1:21:23] [Applause]
[1:21:26] it works every time it's never failed
[1:21:29] it will bring him on the scene without
[1:21:31] fail
[1:21:32] he's always on schedule
[1:21:37] you think he should have showed up years
[1:21:39] ago you think he should have showed up
[1:21:41] months ago before you said that thing or
[1:21:43] before this took place
[1:21:44] he should have showed up but he's always
[1:21:47] on schedule
[1:21:48] the three hebrew children are walking
[1:21:50] into the fire
[1:21:52] thinking surely god's gonna come blow
[1:21:54] this out surely god's gonna come make a
[1:21:56] way or we're gonna we're gonna jog off
[1:21:58] to the right at the last second and
[1:21:59] we're gonna miss it
[1:22:01] but there they go into the fire
[1:22:05] think about it they're believing
[1:22:07] trusting that he's
[1:22:08] he's the heavenly father he's a
[1:22:10] supernatural god
[1:22:11] thinking anything's possible the fire
[1:22:13] could just extinguish
[1:22:17] the door could just blow off the place
[1:22:20] there could be a
[1:22:20] there could be a a a wall just break
[1:22:23] loose and we run
[1:22:24] but no he's always on schedule
[1:22:28] there they are the three three hebrew
[1:22:30] children about to take that step
[1:22:33] past their reason pass their affection
[1:22:36] pass their self-will oh he never
[1:22:40] promised
[1:22:41] that the cross would not get heavy
[1:22:44] that the hill would not be hard to
[1:22:48] climb he
[1:22:52] never offered our victories without
[1:22:55] fighting but he
[1:22:57] said help would always come
[1:23:00] in time
[1:23:03] just remember when you're standing
[1:23:07] in the valley of decision
[1:23:10] and the adversary says
[1:23:14] given they could have bowed right there
[1:23:17] and it would have been all over just
[1:23:19] hold on
[1:23:22] our lord will show up
[1:23:26] and he will take you through the fire
[1:23:30] again
[1:23:33] he's never missed an appointment friends
[1:23:35] he's never laid he's always on schedule
[1:23:38] and you think that they take that last
[1:23:40] step into the fire this is it
[1:23:42] and they prepared to meet their maker
[1:23:44] little did they know he'd come in a way
[1:23:45] that they never expected him to come and
[1:23:48] how many men did you throw in that fire
[1:23:49] well we only put three
[1:23:51] well i see four and the fourth one is in
[1:23:53] the likeness of the son of god
[1:23:55] whom they never had met before he had
[1:23:57] never walked on the earth before but
[1:23:59] they recognized
[1:24:00] that presence is a supernatural presence
[1:24:06] friends he's never late you might think
[1:24:08] he forgot about you
[1:24:10] you might think he's forsook your
[1:24:11] situation but he's right on time
[1:24:13] but look what it required from the three
[1:24:16] hebrew children
[1:24:17] total surrender total surrender
[1:24:21] how did they know he was going to show
[1:24:23] up i can't explain how
[1:24:25] but i know he said he'll be there
[1:24:28] i'll not leave you i'll not forsake you
[1:24:32] i'll be with you even in you a
[1:24:35] total surrender you know we make a total
[1:24:39] surrender
[1:24:40] it puts us in the most the most
[1:24:42] dangerous place that we can be to fight
[1:24:44] the devil the devil hates it when we can
[1:24:47] make a total surrender why
[1:24:48] because we have nothing to lose i don't
[1:24:50] have anything to lose i
[1:24:52] i don't have nowhere to go back to i'm
[1:24:54] not fighting to go backwards i have
[1:24:55] nowhere to retreat from but i've made a
[1:24:57] total surrender
[1:24:58] and me fighting as if i have nothing to
[1:25:00] lose makes me very dangerous to the
[1:25:02] devil because
[1:25:03] i can stand on every promise without
[1:25:05] fear without failure
[1:25:07] without discouragement without doubt
[1:25:09] because i know
[1:25:10] that there's nowhere to go back to i've
[1:25:12] burned every bridge behind me
[1:25:14] i've laid it all down i'm going onward
[1:25:17] though he saved me yet i'll trust him
[1:25:21] jesus didn't come to the potentates and
[1:25:23] the kings and the priests
[1:25:24] he came to men who had nothing to lose
[1:25:26] he came to fishermen who didn't have
[1:25:28] clothes he
[1:25:28] he came to men who didn't know their
[1:25:30] name they couldn't read they couldn't
[1:25:31] ride
[1:25:32] he said those are the guys i want i
[1:25:34] resemble that remark those are the guys
[1:25:36] i want maybe we're not worth nothing in
[1:25:37] this life
[1:25:38] but god came he said those are the
[1:25:40] people that i want
[1:25:41] those people that can fight like they
[1:25:44] have nothing to lose
[1:25:45] those people that can come into a battle
[1:25:48] and never look back they can never
[1:25:49] just like joshua i want to note that
[1:25:51] these five kings were drawn out on the
[1:25:53] same
[1:25:54] day that joshua set for the sun to stand

[1:25:58] the faith that was built up in the
[1:26:00] troops of god

[1:26:54] christian there's not backwards

[1:27:34] he's got church he wants us to stay back
[1:27:36] and
[1:27:36] he wants us to hold back why because we
[1:27:38] will destroy him
[1:27:42] with this revelation the word
[1:27:46] is in me the word cannot fail
[1:27:50] the word has already defeated you boo
[1:27:53] devil blue devil remember the story the
[1:27:57] guy said the devil get closer to him and
[1:27:59] he would say boo and he'd get bigger and
[1:28:00] he'd get afraid and he'd get bigger and
[1:28:02] then finally he said boo devil the devil
[1:28:03] gets smaller
[1:28:04] that's just a silly illustration to some
[1:28:06] of us but it's reality friends
[1:28:09] boo devil oh you think you had me but i
[1:28:12] got news
[1:28:13] you think you had me in a corner but
[1:28:14] i've got nothing to lose
[1:28:16] i've got everything to gain by defeating
[1:28:18] you everything that i love is on the
[1:28:21] other side of you
[1:28:22] so you better watch out devil because i
[1:28:23] have the best weapon that there is to
[1:28:25] defeat you
[1:28:26] i have a weapon that's already it knows
[1:28:29] your weak spot
[1:28:30] it can poke you right there you you came
[1:28:32] against the wrong son of god
[1:28:34] you came against the wrong person
[1:28:36] wandering through this
[1:28:37] age because this weapon
[1:28:41] we'll defeat him every time any place
[1:28:45] anywhere we've got to recognize
[1:28:48] who we are we've got to make a total
[1:28:51] surrender
[1:28:52] we've got to surrender everything that
[1:28:55] we are
[1:28:56] we could just turn to the book of luke
[1:28:58] as we're trying to close
[1:29:05] he says if i believe i believe if a man
[1:29:08] ever come in contact with christ all
[1:29:10] the devils out of hell will never make
[1:29:12] him deny it again
[1:29:14] if you just imagine you got there it's
[1:29:16] something different
[1:29:17] but you know no matter how much
[1:29:19] disfigured i'll ever be
[1:29:21] i'm a human that's right because i was
[1:29:23] born a human
[1:29:24] and if you ever get christ in your heart
[1:29:26] you're a christian
[1:29:28] you're a son of god a daughter of god it
[1:29:31] makes you act different look different
[1:29:33] walk different talk different associate
[1:29:35] in different parties amen
[1:29:36] you'll never forget it if you ever make
[1:29:39] contact with him
[1:29:41] you believe that to be the truth i know
[1:29:44] we do
[1:29:45] praise the lord
[1:29:49] and the 23rd verse the 9th chapter and
[1:29:51] the 23rd verse
[1:29:55] and he said to them all if any man will
[1:29:57] come after me
[1:29:59] let him deny himself and take up his
[1:30:02] cross
[1:30:03] daily and follow me
[1:30:06] how many times have we read right over
[1:30:08] that verse and not really taking it into
[1:30:10] context
[1:30:11] if any man follow me let him deny
[1:30:15] himself my that's hard to do
[1:30:19] oh it's a hard it's a hard hurdle to
[1:30:22] deny your own self-will
[1:30:24] to deny everything that gears you and
[1:30:26] and everything that moves you
[1:30:28] and and to look past what you feel and
[1:30:30] what you see and
[1:30:32] but you know what you've got nothing to
[1:30:35] lose
[1:30:38] where are you going to go back to what
[1:30:41] are you going to turn to
[1:30:43] who else has the words of eternal life
[1:30:45] peter would say
[1:30:46] where else are we gonna go but to this
[1:30:48] rock are we gonna we're gonna find a way
[1:30:50] through our own math and our own skills
[1:30:52] and our own science and our own
[1:30:53] intellect we'll never find it that way
[1:30:56] but he said if any man follows me let
[1:30:59] him deny himself
[1:31:01] daily take up your cross and follow me
[1:31:05] i believe that's our commission in this
[1:31:06] age deny ourselves cast down every
[1:31:09] imagination and every reason
[1:31:11] and every affection and take up our
[1:31:14] cross
[1:31:14] and follow him not just
[1:31:18] not just walk into battle but be
[1:31:20] fearless in battle
[1:31:22] abraham said when joshua recognized who
[1:31:25] he was
[1:31:26] he was fearless in every situation when
[1:31:29] david
[1:31:30] recognized who he was he was fearless
[1:31:33] in every situation when shane recognized
[1:31:36] who he was
[1:31:37] he was fearless in every situation when
[1:31:40] brian
[1:31:41] recognized who he was he was fearless in
[1:31:44] every situation
[1:31:45] when mariah recognized who she was she
[1:31:48] was fearless in every sin why
[1:31:49] because god's word cannot change it
[1:31:52] won't be different for you than it was
[1:31:54] for david
[1:31:55] it won't be different for you than it
[1:31:56] was for joshua i believe with my whole
[1:31:58] heart if a child of god needed the son
[1:32:00] to stand still in this hour
[1:32:02] he could say son stand still and it
[1:32:05] would obey him why because we're back to
[1:32:07] the same authority
[1:32:08] we're back to the same word we're back
[1:32:11] to the same
[1:32:12] revelation that joshua had do not let
[1:32:14] the words of the prophet depart out of
[1:32:16] your mouth
[1:32:16] be strong very courageous and i will
[1:32:19] give you the lamb
[1:32:21] be strong and very courageous and i will
[1:32:23] give you your healing
[1:32:24] i will give you salvation i will give
[1:32:27] you your family
[1:32:28] it's a promise from god in this hour
[1:32:29] that we can walk fearlessly
[1:32:31] into every battle that we go into passed
[1:32:34] our doubt
[1:32:35] past our imagination past our fear
[1:32:38] why because we've surrendered our
[1:32:40] self-will
[1:32:42] invincible army does not mean that you
[1:32:44] won't be hit at
[1:32:45] right right she will be in invincible
[1:32:48] army doesn't mean that he's not going to
[1:32:50] hit us it just means that whatever he
[1:32:51] hits us with
[1:32:52] will not stop us because we cannot be
[1:32:55] stopped
[1:32:56] because we are invincible and if if we
[1:32:58] are invincible then what do we have to
[1:33:00] fear brother brahma will say
[1:33:01] you can't lose once you get that
[1:33:04] revelation
[1:33:05] you can't lose there's nothing that can
[1:33:09] take that from you
[1:33:11] remember remember in that meeting
[1:33:12] brother branham would would pray for
[1:33:14] those two sisters no they wouldn't get
[1:33:16] in the prayer line they were in the
[1:33:17] shadow
[1:33:18] uh trying to get in the shadow of him as
[1:33:19] he was staying in the hotel right so he
[1:33:21] walks they were planning on him
[1:33:22] walking by and they were going to be
[1:33:24] healed in his shadow like peter
[1:33:25] but instead he finds him there in the
[1:33:28] parking lot of the hotel and he says
[1:33:29] what can you sisters
[1:33:30] what what can i do for you say well we
[1:33:32] couldn't get a prayer card and we
[1:33:33] couldn't make it the line and she's got
[1:33:35] you know i think it was mental illness
[1:33:36] and
[1:33:37] she's got mental illness and he said
[1:33:40] uh well let me pray for you and he began
[1:33:42] to pray and he got a vision he said thus
[1:33:43] say the lord
[1:33:44] you'll be healed and right then in that
[1:33:46] moment she was healed and you know what
[1:33:48] they began to do they began to testify
[1:33:49] about it they began to go share with
[1:33:51] this one and that one
[1:33:52] and say we met him in the parking lot
[1:33:53] and he pronounced healing and i can
[1:33:55] think clearly for the first time in
[1:33:56] years and
[1:33:57] i've been delivered from that spirit and
[1:33:59] they began to testify and then two men
[1:34:00] came to him in the parking lot
[1:34:02] and they said we're from the fbi
[1:34:04] remember
[1:34:05] we're from the fbi and and and and we're
[1:34:08] we're here
[1:34:09] to to expose william branham as a false
[1:34:12] prophet
[1:34:12] this isn't anything new we're facing
[1:34:14] friends we're here to expose william
[1:34:16] branham as a false prophet
[1:34:17] and and you've been testifying about
[1:34:19] your healing and you know it really
[1:34:20] wasn't that way and and we're going to
[1:34:22] use that testimony against him and you
[1:34:24] better stop testifying if you love him
[1:34:26] because we're going to use that against
[1:34:27] him and
[1:34:27] what is it's a fear tactic of the devil
[1:34:30] stop testifying about what god's done
[1:34:32] for you
[1:34:32] stop testifying about what he's doing
[1:34:34] and and what you believe he's going to
[1:34:35] do because
[1:34:36] it's really going to bring a reproach
[1:34:37] upon your faith of course the devil's
[1:34:40] going to tell you that friends
[1:34:41] but you know what they did brother
[1:34:42] branham happened to be walking through
[1:34:44] the parking lot and they were packing
[1:34:45] their car
[1:34:46] and he said well what are you doing he
[1:34:47] said we're leaving the meeting we're so
[1:34:49] sorry

[1:34:56] are you talking about what are you
[1:34:57] talking about
[1:34:58] well there's two guys from the fbi here
[1:35:00] and they're gonna they're gonna
[1:35:01] they say they're gonna expose you and
[1:35:03] and you're just a fake but we know it's
[1:35:05] the truth because she was healed and
[1:35:07] and we're so sorry to bring that
[1:35:08] reproach upon you and and
[1:35:10] and she said i i hope you're not mad and
[1:35:12] brother bam said no why would i be mad
[1:35:14] he said the devil's mad the devil's
[1:35:17] upset because you got your healing and
[1:35:19] and he said let the fbi come you know
[1:35:21] why because he didn't have anything to
[1:35:23] lose he said let him come investigate me

[1:35:28] and you're claiming to be the fbi and
[1:35:30] you're claiming to expose me tonight he
[1:35:32] said but you're two backslidden
[1:35:33] preachers
[1:35:34] that have gotten away from the will of
[1:35:36] god that have gotten away from the
[1:35:38] things of god
[1:35:39] and you're trying to scare people out of
[1:35:41] this meeting he said come down here and
[1:35:42] face me you know what
[1:35:43] they wouldn't come they wouldn't come
[1:35:45] face him why because he had nothing
[1:35:48] to lose he was a vindicated word prophet
[1:35:51] he knew that god told him it was thus
[1:35:53] saith the lord it was not his word
[1:35:55] but it was god's word through his lips
[1:35:58] if we could get the same revelation in
[1:36:00] our life
[1:36:01] to know that we have nothing to lose let
[1:36:04] the fbi come and investigate me
[1:36:06] come on let him investigate you come on
[1:36:09] fbi what i have nothing to lose
[1:36:13] come on devil what are you gonna expose
[1:36:16] me as a fraud
[1:36:17] you can expose me as a fake i have
[1:36:19] nothing to lose
[1:36:20] because i know that god called me i know
[1:36:23] that god filled me with the spirit i
[1:36:24] know that god placed me in this age
[1:36:27] to defeat you upon your own battleground
[1:36:29] you chose the battleground
[1:36:31] and i'm going to defeat you on this
[1:36:33] battleground because i have
[1:36:34] thus saith the lord
[1:36:38] that's a quote the bride
[1:36:41] will have thus saith the lord why
[1:36:44] because she stands
[1:36:45] upon every word she stands upon
[1:36:48] every promise and though the gates of
[1:36:51] hell will come against me
[1:36:53] they shall not prevail why because they
[1:36:55] already lost the battle once
[1:36:58] and they'll lose it again friends we've
[1:37:00] been made more than conquerors in this
[1:37:02] hour
[1:37:03] let the enemy come let the winds assail
[1:37:06] there was demons on every wave that cast
[1:37:08] up in the boat
[1:37:09] but you know what he said we'll crest
[1:37:12] every one of them by the word of god
[1:37:15] we're promised people with the promised
[1:37:17] word
[1:37:18] in a promised hour god's not missed us
[1:37:22] he's not late he keeps his schedule
[1:37:24] every time
[1:37:25] and just when it looks like you're going
[1:37:28] down in the battle
[1:37:29] he shows up
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:32] the prophet of god would call him our
[1:37:34] captain of deliverance
[1:37:37] just when it looks like there's no other
[1:37:38] way he shows up
[1:37:41] but we've got to get rid of this old
[1:37:43] mind we've got to get rid of this whole
[1:37:44] this whole temper this old imagination
[1:37:47] this old conscious
[1:37:48] this old reason we've got to clean it
[1:37:50] out get the shovel of god's word out and
[1:37:51] dig it out
[1:37:53] we got to make more room for him i say
[1:37:55] less of me
[1:37:56] and more of him dig out every unbelief
[1:38:00] dig out every doubt every maybe you've
[1:38:02] prayed for things for years and years
[1:38:04] and years and to the point where you you
[1:38:05] feel discouraged in your mind
[1:38:07] hold the line god will
[1:38:10] show up right on time he has not
[1:38:13] forgotten your prayer
[1:38:14] prayers do not expire but hold the line
[1:38:17] and keep fast to that faith
[1:38:18] he will show up he will deliver
[1:38:22] that's not my words that's a promise
[1:38:24] that's an eternal promise of the father
[1:38:27] he will show up on time parents don't
[1:38:29] give up on your kids
[1:38:31] there's nowhere they can go that's too
[1:38:33] far there's nowhere that's too deep you
[1:38:35] might think that they've said too much
[1:38:37] but what is that to god when he comes
[1:38:39] and he changes that heart
[1:38:40] that's your understanding of it that's
[1:38:42] not god's
[1:38:44] don't lose faith on them hold the line
[1:38:48] hold the line of this word don't cave
[1:38:51] don't compromise
[1:38:53] don't back up hold the line
[1:38:56] friends we've been given a perfect word
[1:38:59] we we
[1:38:59] we were given a perfect profit in a
[1:39:01] perfect age
[1:39:03] so that makes us perfect overcomers
[1:39:07] we have to have battles to overcome we
[1:39:09] have to have trials to be victorious
[1:39:11] we have to have sickness to be healed we
[1:39:14] have to have been lost to be saved
[1:39:19] we have to have had a self-will to make
[1:39:21] a surrender
[1:39:24] i choose now lord take it out
[1:39:28] lord take out my own decisions and my
[1:39:30] own reason and my own will and
[1:39:31] take out my own ambitions and take out
[1:39:33] my own my own
[1:39:34] what i think would be would be
[1:39:36] liberating give me your liberty
[1:39:38] give me liberty in your word give me
[1:39:39] liberty in your spirit i i want to
[1:39:41] worship you like i never have i
[1:39:43] i don't want to do the same thing
[1:39:44] expecting different results but i want
[1:39:46] to reach past what i feel
[1:39:48] i want to look to an unseen realm we
[1:39:51] could just stand to our feet tonight
[1:39:57] if we can fight every battle like we
[1:39:59] have nothing to lose
[1:40:02] you know that poor that poor woman
[1:40:06] was beat up abused nobody nobody thought
[1:40:09] she'd ever make anything of herself
[1:40:10] nobody thought she'd ever succeed
[1:40:12] she'd ruined her life she'd thrown it
[1:40:14] away
[1:40:16] but she heard of a jesus
[1:40:20] who could forgive sins now you think
[1:40:23] about that in your own reason
[1:40:25] there's a man walking and some say
[1:40:28] that he's beelzebub and some say that
[1:40:31] he's just a false prophet and some say
[1:40:33] he's just a good man and some say he has
[1:40:34] good morals but some say he can forgive
[1:40:37] sins
[1:40:39] and she takes everything that she has
[1:40:41] she burned
[1:40:42] every bridge she took every penny she
[1:40:45] had
[1:40:46] this isn't about money it's about your
[1:40:48] self-will
[1:40:50] and she dumped it all out she said fill
[1:40:52] up that box
[1:40:53] with oil we know the story but she goes
[1:40:56] it wasn't an easy road she takes the box
[1:40:58] she walks into the house and there all
[1:41:01] her critics are
[1:41:03] and there he is at the other end of the
[1:41:04] house and she has to take that box and
[1:41:07] walk
[1:41:08] past every critic saying who knows what
[1:41:12] calling her who knows what bringing down
[1:41:15] every condemnation
[1:41:18] she's overcoming her her her imagination
[1:41:23] her conscience her memories
[1:41:28] she's overcoming everything one step at
[1:41:29] a time why because she sees something at
[1:41:32] the other end of the room
[1:41:34] i've got to get to that jesus
[1:41:37] i've got to get to him i need to lay
[1:41:40] aside everything that they're saying
[1:41:42] everything that i'm remembering you
[1:41:43] don't think every spirit in hell was
[1:41:45] raging against her to try to stop her
[1:41:47] from making it across that room
[1:41:48] i've got to get to jesus
[1:41:54] and when she gets to him maybe in her
[1:41:55] mind she thought i'd say
[1:41:57] she'd say i'm sorry or she'd say forgive
[1:41:59] me or if thou be or
[1:42:02] you know when she got there she got into
[1:42:04] his presence she didn't have words
[1:42:07] there was nothing she could bring to say
[1:42:10] but overcoming all of those affections
[1:42:12] and all of those reasons and all of
[1:42:15] those memories by the time she got to
[1:42:17] his presence
[1:42:18] she was so overwhelmed all she could do
[1:42:20] was weep
[1:42:22] all she could do was weep at his feet
[1:42:24] being in that august presence knowing
[1:42:26] that
[1:42:27] all of those memories all of those
[1:42:30] imaginations
[1:42:32] just like that had been forgiven
[1:42:38] she washed his feet
[1:42:41] she poured out everything that she owned
[1:42:44] everything that she was she poured out
[1:42:46] on his feet she began just weeping and
[1:42:48] washing his feet and
[1:42:51] i love you jesus i praise you jesus
[1:42:56] something that nobody had done before
[1:42:59] this wasn't she wasn't following a
[1:43:00] pattern
[1:43:02] but she was really getting into the
[1:43:03] spirit of worship
[1:43:06] and there he brings out her accusers and
[1:43:10] then he says those words of eternal life
[1:43:12] to her
[1:43:14] thy sins which are many
[1:43:18] are all forgiven the greatest thing we
[1:43:22] can do is overcome our self-will
[1:43:24] friends i hope i hope it made sense
[1:43:26] tonight and you can you can take
[1:43:27] something to heart from this
[1:43:30] we are chosen to do this this isn't a
[1:43:33] maybe or i think you can do it
