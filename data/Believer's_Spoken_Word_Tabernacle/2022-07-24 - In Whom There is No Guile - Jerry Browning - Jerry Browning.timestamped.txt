[41:00] amen let's give the lord a handclap of
[41:02] praise this morning
[41:04] amen
[41:06] praise the name of the lord
[41:10] amen
[41:13] so good to be in the house of the lord
[41:15] so good to be gathered together amen in
[41:17] his presence
[41:19] amen is this these are
[41:21] truly the highlights of our life
[41:23] amen to be in his presence because
[41:26] what takes place in the presence of the
[41:28] lord
[41:29] it then affects everything else
[41:32] throughout the course of our life
[41:35] god don't need a lot of time he just
[41:37] needs
[41:38] just a moment
[41:41] think of it for the rapture itself will
[41:43] be changed
[41:44] in a twinkling of an eye even before you
[41:46] could bat your eye that's how fast the
[41:48] change will come
[41:49] it shows god working among his people to
[41:52] bring us to a place
[41:54] of such yieldedness such trust in his
[41:57] presence
[41:59] god only needed five minutes and it
[42:01] wasn't even five minutes he needed
[42:04] but it was five minutes in the presence
[42:05] of the lord where moses
[42:08] walked out
[42:10] as a conqueror
[42:12] where 40 years of training could never
[42:15] accomplish it
[42:17] it just shows god knows what every one
[42:19] of us have need of here this morning
[42:22] i'll tell you i just want to take in the
[42:24] word of the lord as it's coming we had
[42:26] such a wonderful time here on thursday
[42:28] just a wonderful
[42:29] word of the lord that god has given to
[42:31] us
[42:32] and i'll tell you
[42:33] that way of dying there's no other way
[42:35] to replace that
[42:37] but to think of it that through that
[42:39] through the new birth in our life
[42:41] because it can't come without a death to
[42:44] self
[42:45] but that makes way for dying daily
[42:48] how many testify to that
[42:50] dying daily
[42:52] thank god that there's a greater life on
[42:54] the inside
[42:56] to bring this other part in subjection
[42:59] and
[43:00] we desire to please him don't we
[43:02] amen just so enjoyed every
[43:05] my goodness the song song service and
[43:07] just enjoyed the the special singing
[43:10] amen i i love that so much
[43:12] what uh what a word that god has has
[43:14] given to us and i want to say here this

[43:27] us here this morning and then as well on
[43:29] thursday evening for us
[43:31] uh
[43:32] also want to say it's just been a real
[43:34] real joy and a real privilege for us as
[43:37] a congregation to have sister soriano
[43:39] here with us
[43:40] amen
[43:45] and
[43:48] we're going to have a little foretaste
[43:51] of what that marriage supper is going to
[43:52] be like
[43:54] because we have a fellowship dinner
[43:55] planned
[43:57] this for this afternoon
[43:59] and we just are we want to

[44:12] and also to fellowship with one another
[44:15] amen

[54:39] philip findeth nathanael
[54:41] and saith unto him we have found him of
[54:43] whom moses in the law and the prophets
[54:45] did rise
[54:47] jesus of nazareth the son of joseph
[54:51] nathanael said unto him
[54:53] can there any good thing come out of
[54:54] nazareth
[54:56] philip saith unto him
[54:58] come and see
[55:00] jesus saw nathanael coming to him and
[55:03] saith in him behold
[55:04] an israelite indeed in whom is no guile
[55:09] nathanael said unto him whence knoweth
[55:11] thou me
[55:12] jesus answered and said unto him before
[55:14] that philip called thee when thou was
[55:16] under the fig tree i saw thee
[55:19] nathanael answered and said unto him
[55:20] rabbi
[55:21] thou art the son of god thou art the
[55:24] king of israel
[55:26] and jesus
[55:28] answered and said unto him because i
[55:29] said unto thee i saw thee under fig tree
[55:32] believeth thou. thou shalt see greater
[55:35] things than these
[55:37] and he said him verily verily i say unto
[55:40] you hereafter ye shall see heaven open
[55:43] and the angels of god ascending and
[55:45] descending upon the son of man you may
[55:48] be seated
[55:51] i'd like to
[55:53] title this message this morning in whom
[55:55] there is no guile
[56:00] to
[56:01] be without guile
[56:03] means to be free of deceit
[56:06] it means
[56:08] to be free of cunning or hypocrisy or
[56:12] dishonesty or
[56:13] in thought or action anything false
[56:19] beguiled means to deceive or to lead
[56:22] astray
[56:23] just the
[56:24] opposite of
[56:26] having no guile
[56:29] there was one in the garden who was full
[56:31] of guile
[56:34] and the bible says that
[56:38] the serpent was more subtle than any
[56:40] beast of the field
[56:42] and that he
[56:46] used his
[56:47] beauty
[56:49] and his substitute
[56:51] to beguile the woman
[56:54] and the way that he did it was by
[56:56] starting out quoting her the words
[57:02] if we could say the serpent began to
[57:04] preach a sermon to eve
[57:10] and it he
[57:12] got eve to agreeing with him
[57:16] he got eve to saying amen
[57:19] what you say is true
[57:22] and then after he got her
[57:24] going along that path
[57:27] then he injected something
[57:30] that was a little different
[57:33] from the message of the hour
[57:36] but he started off by using quotes of
[57:38] the message
[57:43] and
[57:44] eve said
[57:46] yes it's true we can eat of every tree
[57:48] the garden of
[57:50] every tree of the garden except the tree
[57:52] of knowledge of good and evil for in the
[57:54] day we eat thereof we shall die
[57:59] and the serpent said surely
[58:01] you'll not die
[58:04] i mean
[58:05] why would god create you
[58:08] just to kill you
[58:11] surely he's not going to kill you surely
[58:13] you're not going to die but what god
[58:15] knows is the day you eat thereof that
[58:18] you'll be as gods
[58:21] friends i want you to know something
[58:23] they already were as gods
[58:27] they had rule over the earth
[58:32] the prophet says adam could speak to a
[58:35] tree and move it from one place to
[58:37] another
[58:38] they were already gods over this
[58:41] this earth
[58:43] but you see
[58:44] satan wanted to be god
[58:47] over the earth
[58:51] and the only way he could do it was to
[58:53] knock man out of his position
[58:56] [Applause]
[58:59] and so
[59:01] he went
[59:02] excuse me but he went to the weakest
[59:04] league
[59:08] he didn't go talk to her why adam was
[59:10] present
[59:12] he waited till he could get her off to
[59:14] the side
[59:16] away from adam
[59:18] to where he can begin to work on it but
[59:21] look at the way the devil does it today
[59:25] he doesn't want to come while christ is
[59:27] present
[59:29] he wants to come to the church if he can
[59:32] gets you a side where you're aside off
[59:34] to yourself and then begin to talk to
[59:37] you
[59:38] and you see
[59:40] where eve went wrong was
[59:42] she began to listen
[59:46] the church began to listen
[59:51] i'm going to tell you something there
[59:52] are many out there today
[59:54] that are trying to beguile the church of
[59:57] god
[1:00:00] you see what do i do about these sites
[1:00:02] and believe the sign and all these
[1:00:04] different things don't listen to them
[1:00:11] i'm not afraid you'll be deceived
[1:00:14] because
[1:00:15] the prophet said this this eve of this
[1:00:19] age cannot be deceived
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:23] [Applause]
[1:00:25] but why give it your time
[1:00:30] it's a waste of time
[1:00:33] listen i was never in one of brother
[1:00:35] branham's meetings but i know it's true
[1:00:39] i know that he spoke the squirrels into
[1:00:42] existence
[1:00:43] i know that he's that when he spoke a
[1:00:46] little fist came back to life
[1:00:49] so how do you know the same way i know
[1:00:52] that god come down through jesus christ
[1:00:56] and took mud and anointed a blind man's
[1:00:59] eyes and he saw again
[1:01:01] i wasn't there but i believe
[1:01:04] why because there's something inside of
[1:01:08] me that says amen to it
[1:01:15] i'm not afraid of being shaken
[1:01:20] i don't want to hear their argument
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:24] [Applause]
[1:01:26] let me just bring this into perspective
[1:01:28] for you
[1:01:31] in this world today
[1:01:34] there are those that argue for the lbgt
[1:01:37] or whatever it's called
[1:01:39] all right
[1:01:40] i'm not going to be deceived by them
[1:01:42] because i know what the word says
[1:01:45] but i don't want to give time to their
[1:01:47] arguments
[1:01:49] i don't want to give time to what they
[1:01:51] have to say
[1:01:53] because i know
[1:01:55] what the word says
[1:01:58] and i know that the word said that
[1:02:00] before the great and dreadful coming of
[1:02:03] the lord that he would send elijah the
[1:02:06] prophet
[1:02:12] and no man
[1:02:13] that stands up today and puts all of his
[1:02:16] filth on the internet
[1:02:18] can stand up to the elijah that came in
[1:02:21] this day
[1:02:22] [Applause]
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] it isn't about
[1:02:34] him calling someone's name out or
[1:02:36] telling him where they're from telling
[1:02:38] things that nobody could know but god it
[1:02:40] isn't just that
[1:02:44] he never failed
[1:02:47] it never would he never once had to say
[1:02:49] oh excuse me uh i'm sorry i got that
[1:02:51] wrong
[1:03:03] let me see them
[1:03:05] bring eyes
[1:03:07] into eye sockets that had no eyeballs
[1:03:12] and say excuse me little girl i forgot
[1:03:14] to ask you what color you wanted
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:21] the word that we have received did not
[1:03:23] come through enticing words
[1:03:26] but it came through power and
[1:03:28] demonstration of the spirit
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:31] [Applause]
[1:03:33] it didn't come in a beguiling way
[1:03:37] when it came to call out of pride
[1:03:41] from the beginning ways of the religions
[1:03:44] of the day
[1:03:45] [Applause]
[1:03:56] remember adam and eve
[1:03:58] they hid themselves
[1:04:00] before they realized they were naked
[1:04:03] the prophet said
[1:04:05] show me an apple that could do that
[1:04:11] he said let's start passing out the
[1:04:12] apples
[1:04:19] friends listen
[1:04:21] brother branham saul
[1:04:23] as it were he saw a woman wearing like
[1:04:26] fig leaves just things to cover up
[1:04:29] certain areas
[1:04:32] they don't even do that anymore
[1:04:35] it's went beyond that
[1:04:43] the prophet said before the coming of
[1:04:45] the lord this world will go totally
[1:04:48] insane
[1:04:51] when i was a boy and heard those words
[1:04:56] i had a different thought on perhaps
[1:04:57] what they meant
[1:04:59] i was thinking about people losing their
[1:05:01] minds going into institutions and all
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:04] no friends this world's insane
[1:05:12] it's
[1:05:13] they wear around things it makes you
[1:05:14] think of the story of the emperor's new
[1:05:16] clothes
[1:05:19] the bible says they're naked and don't
[1:05:21] know it
[1:05:32] he said who told you you were naked
[1:05:36] adam said the woman you gave me
[1:05:39] she gave me the fruit night eight
[1:05:42] she said the serpent beguiled me
[1:05:46] the serpent deceived me
[1:05:49] why because she began to listen to him
[1:05:53] and after some time
[1:05:55] it began to sound pretty good
[1:06:03] i think about these people
[1:06:05] who have left
[1:06:08] churches
[1:06:10] over their pastor leaving the message
[1:06:14] and then they begin to
[1:06:16] go back and listen to what he has to say
[1:06:18] and listen to what these others have to
[1:06:20] say and the next thing you know
[1:06:22] they leave and go back
[1:06:25] like a dog going back to its vomit
[1:06:32] paul says they went out from us because
[1:06:34] they were never one of us
[1:06:40] i've got i've got no interest in
[1:06:42] listening to the devil
[1:06:44] i've got no interest in listening
[1:06:47] to the serpent
[1:06:49] i got no interest in listening to the
[1:06:52] serpent's seed
[1:06:57] this is a day of identifying
[1:07:04] jesus told us
[1:07:06] that when they speak evil of you rejoice
[1:07:08] in that day
[1:07:10] and they cast your name as he
[1:07:11] he says rejoice in that day because so
[1:07:14] did they the prophets and i've always
[1:07:16] went to that scripture and said that was
[1:07:18] an identifying scripture
[1:07:20] because it shows identification there
[1:07:23] were those that are fulfilling the part
[1:07:25] of the prophecy that jesus prophesied
[1:07:27] and they're casting people's names out
[1:07:29] as evil
[1:07:31] but there's those that are having their
[1:07:32] names cast out as evil
[1:07:35] and it shows what side there are
[1:07:41] i would not want to be standing in the
[1:07:42] shoes of one that's casting out the
[1:07:45] prophet's name as something evil
[1:07:49] he was a man he was not god
[1:07:56] but he was a prophet
[1:07:59] and the bible says touch not mine
[1:08:01] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[1:08:12] god said to the serpent
[1:08:15] because thou has done this thou are
[1:08:16] cursed above all cattle
[1:08:19] above every beast of the field
[1:08:22] upon thy belly shalt thou go listen
[1:08:24] friends if he was already on his belly
[1:08:26] what kind of a curse would this have
[1:08:27] been
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:31] he wasn't
[1:08:32] the bible says he was the most subtle
[1:08:35] beast of the field not serpent
[1:08:40] not reptile
[1:08:43] there were reptiles
[1:08:46] but he was not a reptile
[1:08:49] he was a beast
[1:08:53] brother says they're looking for the
[1:08:55] missing link
[1:08:57] he says and they've been trying for
[1:08:59] thousands of years to get a chimpanzee
[1:09:02] to talk
[1:09:04] and they'll never accomplish it
[1:09:07] he said they can get it to do sign
[1:09:10] language they can get it to to tip its
[1:09:12] hat they can get it to smile he said
[1:09:15] that's like gehan hall to a horse
[1:09:26] god so
[1:09:27] [Music]
[1:09:28] cursed the serpent
[1:09:31] to where now it is not even recognizable
[1:09:35] that's their missing link the prophet
[1:09:37] said
[1:09:38] was the serpent in the garden
[1:09:42] it was a beast
[1:09:44] walked on two legs the closest thing to
[1:09:47] man
[1:09:51] listen he says i'll put enmity between
[1:09:54] thee
[1:09:54] and the woman
[1:09:56] and between thy
[1:09:58] seed
[1:10:01] and her seed
[1:10:04] two different seeds
[1:10:06] right here god tells you the serpent had
[1:10:10] a seed
[1:10:12] i don't see why it's so hard for people
[1:10:13] to accept serpent seed
[1:10:16] because it says it here clearly this
[1:10:18] isn't something some man made up
[1:10:23] between
[1:10:24] thy seed so the serpent had a seed
[1:10:28] and her seed and her seed was the
[1:10:32] promise of one to come that would
[1:10:35] restore creation back
[1:10:38] one that would come that would redeem
[1:10:40] man back from its fallen state because
[1:10:43] he said
[1:10:44] it shall bruise thy head
[1:10:48] i want you to know that on calvary he
[1:10:51] crushed his head
[1:10:53] [Applause]
[1:11:11] god put him plumb back
[1:11:14] words
[1:11:15] friends what what did he do
[1:11:17] he changed the molecular structure
[1:11:21] of the serpent
[1:11:23] and caused him to crawl on his belt and
[1:11:25] he says from this day forward you shall
[1:11:28] the dust shall you eat
[1:11:35] so he wasn't doing it before that
[1:11:42] turned me to second corinthians chapter
[1:11:44] 11.
[1:11:56] verses two and three
[1:12:00] paul writes for i am jealous over you
[1:12:02] with godly jealousy
[1:12:05] for i've espoused you to one husband
[1:12:08] that i may present
[1:12:10] you as a chaste virgin to christ
[1:12:15] but i fear lest by any means as a
[1:12:17] serpent beguiled eve through his
[1:12:19] subtlety
[1:12:21] so your mind should be corrupted from
[1:12:23] the simplicity that is in christ
[1:12:31] here we find paul saying
[1:12:34] as the serpent beguiled eve
[1:12:37] i fear
[1:12:39] lest that your minds
[1:12:43] would be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:12:45] that is in christ
[1:12:49] what is the simplicity that's in christ
[1:12:52] only relief
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] well how is this going to happen only
[1:12:58] belief
[1:12:59] how is he going to do it only belief
[1:13:05] you know a child
[1:13:08] faith
[1:13:09] the bible refers to it
[1:13:11] a child like faith
[1:13:14] perhaps i've told you this story before
[1:13:16] but years ago when my family and i lived
[1:13:19] up here
[1:13:20] our youngest boy nathaniel he was sick
[1:13:24] he was just just a young child i don't
[1:13:26] even remember if he was in school yet or
[1:13:27] not
[1:13:29] and
[1:13:31] the other
[1:13:32] his siblings were going outside to play
[1:13:34] in the snow
[1:13:36] and his mother told him you can't go
[1:13:38] outside and play you're sick
[1:13:41] and so he left and he went upstairs
[1:13:44] and he found his papa brother bill
[1:13:47] and he says papa i'm sick pray for me
[1:13:51] so he prayed for him
[1:13:54] nathaniel came back downstairs and began
[1:13:56] to put on his coat
[1:13:58] his mother said i told you you couldn't
[1:13:59] go outside you're sick he said i'm not
[1:14:01] sick anymore papa prayed for me
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:04] [Applause]
[1:14:07] and he wasn't sick anymore
[1:14:11] look friends this this i'm not telling
[1:14:13] you some kind of fairy tale i'm telling
[1:14:15] you when he put on his jacket he was no
[1:14:18] longer sick
[1:14:19] why because he didn't believe he was
[1:14:24] he believed that prayer
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:29] [Applause]
[1:14:35] my little granddaughter rose she gets
[1:14:37] something wrong she comes with papa pray
[1:14:40] for me
[1:14:41] why because she believes
[1:14:44] that once she's prayed for everything
[1:14:45] will be all right
[1:14:49] i thank god their parents teach them
[1:14:51] like that
[1:14:53] but that childlike faith that's the
[1:14:55] simplicity that's in christ
[1:15:00] if we could have that childlike faith
[1:15:02] whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:15:06] you shall receive it
[1:15:10] if you ask for a fish will i not give
[1:15:13] you a fish
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:23] that's the bible
[1:15:25] he says your earthly fathers know how to
[1:15:27] give good gifts how much more to your
[1:15:29] heavenly father
[1:15:31] that he knows what you have need of
[1:15:33] before you even ask
[1:15:36] but he wants to hear his children ask
[1:15:42] friends look
[1:15:43] he's my hero
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:51] when
[1:15:52] my children were growing up if they
[1:15:54] broke something at home they would take
[1:15:56] it to their mother and say here fix this
[1:15:59] and she miraculously would fix it
[1:16:03] to them tape glue or whatever it took
[1:16:06] fix it
[1:16:08] if it's broke mom can fix it
[1:16:11] she was their hero when they were little
[1:16:12] children
[1:16:16] now they
[1:16:17] have a problem they call me dad i got
[1:16:20] this dad i need that and
[1:16:22] you know what i do it doesn't matter i
[1:16:25] go and do it you know why i like being
[1:16:26] the hero
[1:16:35] god is your hero
[1:16:37] he is there for you and has always been
[1:16:39] there for you he said that he will be
[1:16:42] with us even in us
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:46] hallelujah so it isn't just that you're
[1:16:49] looking for somebody that's out here but
[1:16:50] he's right in here
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:56] he's here to heal
[1:16:59] friends you're not going to need divine
[1:17:01] healing during the millennium
[1:17:04] once the rapture takes place you're not
[1:17:05] going to need divine healing why because
[1:17:08] we're going to be restored
[1:17:10] back to the way it was at the beginning
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:14] but we need it now
[1:17:17] now is when we need divine healing
[1:17:20] and he said i'm the lord thy god that
[1:17:23] healeth all thy diseases
[1:17:27] a double l
[1:17:34] hallelujah
[1:17:36] i'm sure if we give time there would be
[1:17:38] many testimonies throughout this
[1:17:39] assembly of different things that god
[1:17:41] has already healed you from
[1:17:44] he's still that same god today
[1:17:48] hallelujah
[1:17:56] i think when you go home tonight brother
[1:17:58] branham says and humble thyself if
[1:18:00] you'll read the book of jude
[1:18:03] where it says i earnestly contend for
[1:18:05] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:18:07] saints
[1:18:09] they got away from from it
[1:18:12] how man of corrupt mind and so forth
[1:18:16] have come in and beguiled the people
[1:18:18] away from the real things of god
[1:18:31] when the children of israel
[1:18:33] were in the wilderness
[1:18:36] and there were snakes serpents that came
[1:18:39] in among them
[1:18:40] poisonous serpents
[1:18:43] and god instructed moses
[1:18:46] to make a brass serpent
[1:18:49] and put it on a pole
[1:18:52] and then if anyone was bit when they
[1:18:54] looked at this brass circle on the pole
[1:18:56] they would live
[1:19:00] and what the br brass represents
[1:19:02] judgment
[1:19:05] and the serpent represented sin from the
[1:19:08] garden
[1:19:11] and it was made of brass because it
[1:19:13] represented that sin had already been
[1:19:17] judged
[1:19:18] when was sin judged when he said her
[1:19:22] seed will bruise thy head
[1:19:27] he had already judged sin
[1:19:30] so when they looked at this
[1:19:32] representation of the brass serpent on
[1:19:35] the pole sin being judged
[1:19:38] they were healed
[1:19:40] they lived
[1:19:43] sin has already been judged today
[1:19:50] divine judgment had fallen upon sin
[1:19:54] brother adam says
[1:19:56] patmos vision
[1:19:57] judgment had already passed upon him
[1:19:59] when he was when yet there was no sinner
[1:20:02] salvation being entirely of the lord
[1:20:04] he trod the winepress of the fierceness
[1:20:06] of the wrath of god alone
[1:20:08] his vestures were dyed crimson with his
[1:20:10] own blood
[1:20:12] the fiery furnace of the just judgment
[1:20:14] of wrath god was his portion he suffered
[1:20:17] the just for the unjust
[1:20:19] thou art worthy o lamb of god for thou
[1:20:22] has redeemed us by thine own blood he
[1:20:26] was wounded for our transgressions
[1:20:28] bruised for our iniquity the
[1:20:29] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:20:32] and by his stripes we are healed the
[1:20:34] lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of
[1:20:37] us all he suffered as no man ever
[1:20:40] suffered even before the cross he had
[1:20:42] shed great drops of sweat like blood
[1:20:45] from his body
[1:20:47] as in the intense agony of the ordeal
[1:20:49] ahead and the very blood separated in
[1:20:52] his veins
[1:20:58] the chastisement of our peace
[1:21:03] is upon him
[1:21:06] how many times
[1:21:09] have we been in situations
[1:21:12] where we felt no peace
[1:21:15] no rest
[1:21:20] but god would come
[1:21:23] in his infinite mercy
[1:21:26] and he didn't sit down and explain to
[1:21:29] you how everything was going to turn out
[1:21:31] right
[1:21:33] he just comforts you
[1:21:35] with his presence
[1:21:37] and your faith
[1:21:39] that everything's going to be all right
[1:21:42] because his word says all things work
[1:21:45] together for the good of them that love
[1:21:47] the lord that are called according to
[1:21:50] his purpose
[1:21:54] a peace
[1:21:55] that passes all understanding
[1:21:57] just comes down upon you
[1:22:04] so how are you going to get out of this
[1:22:05] i don't know but he's the liver
[1:22:14] corrupted from the simplicity that is in
[1:22:17] christ
[1:22:20] brother branham said
[1:22:22] here's the simplicity of
[1:22:24] prayer
[1:22:27] your faith
[1:22:29] he said it's not how long your prayer is
[1:22:33] it's if you believe
[1:22:36] he was talking to a man who had
[1:22:37] tuberculosis brother branham prayed and
[1:22:40] said dear god
[1:22:41] you who have made the death here in the
[1:22:43] blind see and the dumb speak thou can
[1:22:46] heal our brother of this tuberculosis i
[1:22:48] pray father you'll grant it may leave
[1:22:50] him in the name of jesus christ god
[1:22:52] bless you my brother now look
[1:22:54] it's not
[1:22:55] how long the prayer is it's your faith
[1:22:58] that does it
[1:23:04] christ brother adam said preached in
[1:23:07] simplicity
[1:23:08] is what stirs the people
[1:23:13] if i be lifted up i'll draw all men unto
[1:23:16] me christ preaching simplicity
[1:23:21] not
[1:23:23] the deceitful words
[1:23:26] and and wily ways
[1:23:28] and oh i've got this great mystery you
[1:23:31] must understand
[1:23:34] now
[1:23:36] i'm the only one that's got this
[1:23:39] god gave it to me
[1:23:42] and
[1:23:43] if william branham was here
[1:23:46] why he had to sit and listen to me
[1:23:51] you say surely not
[1:23:53] oh yeah that's been said
[1:24:00] a man one preacher said
[1:24:02] and he got his people believing he was
[1:24:04] the only one that had the true
[1:24:06] revelation of the godhead
[1:24:10] and that if brother branham was here
[1:24:11] he'd have to sit down and listen to him
[1:24:13] to get it straight
[1:24:16] well they didn't believe that he was the
[1:24:17] prophet that come to finish all
[1:24:19] mysteries then
[1:24:22] they didn't believe the word then
[1:24:27] cunning ways deceitfulness
[1:24:31] beguiling the people
[1:24:36] men have come and
[1:24:38] tried to call people out
[1:24:43] one one man preaching called out a
[1:24:46] certain sister i won't name her
[1:24:48] but y'all she's well known
[1:24:51] but they called her out and said you've
[1:24:53] got such and such a problem
[1:24:55] if you know this sister she stood up and
[1:24:57] said no i don't
[1:25:00] you're wrong
[1:25:02] yeah you do you just don't know it
[1:25:05] well time proves all things you know
[1:25:08] she didn't have it
[1:25:15] when christ is preached in simplicity
[1:25:17] yet in its power
[1:25:20] when christ the living god has been
[1:25:23] brought to reality to the people
[1:25:27] that's what god did in this last age
[1:25:31] we we hear that
[1:25:33] brother branham's ministry came to
[1:25:35] introduce christ to this age
[1:25:39] well didn't people already know christ
[1:25:41] didn't people already know about christ
[1:25:43] they had been beguiled
[1:25:46] they had been led astray
[1:25:49] from the word that had been delivered to
[1:25:51] them in their day
[1:25:54] and so god sent a prophet
[1:25:56] to tie up all the loose ends and bring
[1:25:58] everything back and put us back on the
[1:26:01] path of the word
[1:26:07] but he saw in a vision
[1:26:11] the presenting of the bride
[1:26:14] of course he mentioned about
[1:26:16] the bride of miss usa
[1:26:19] but then when he mentioned about said
[1:26:21] the bride must come again and you
[1:26:24] mentioned about the bride of christ
[1:26:25] coming and he saw
[1:26:28] some couple getting out of step in the
[1:26:30] back
[1:26:33] he said stay in step
[1:26:36] that's what god's telling us today
[1:26:39] that's what he's telling us in this time
[1:26:40] the messages that you hear preach is god
[1:26:43] telling us
[1:26:44] getting us in step get us back in step
[1:26:49] do not be beguiled like eve was beguiled
[1:26:53] away from the simplicity which is in
[1:26:55] christ jesus
[1:27:03] brother says i'll tell you brother what
[1:27:05] we need today is old-fashioned simple
[1:27:07] gospel holy ghost preached in his
[1:27:09] simplicity
[1:27:17] when we say
[1:27:19] god heals
[1:27:22] friends
[1:27:23] then
[1:27:24] he's up to the challenge
[1:27:28] you can put it to the test
[1:27:31] he'll heal
[1:27:42] some years ago there was a sister in my
[1:27:45] assembly
[1:27:46] she was very sickly
[1:27:49] and she was
[1:27:50] constantly going into the hospital
[1:27:54] and anytime she would go into the
[1:27:55] hospital i would go up and pray for
[1:27:58] and god would raise her back up
[1:28:02] her brother tried to entice her away
[1:28:04] from the church
[1:28:08] she was
[1:28:09] she was uh single she was on her own
[1:28:14] she had
[1:28:16] no
[1:28:17] family around there around our church
[1:28:20] but she came faithful
[1:28:24] and
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:27] even times when she had to sit in a
[1:28:29] wheelchair
[1:28:30] she came and was faithful
[1:28:33] the brother tried to entice her away to
[1:28:35] come down move where he was at and we'll
[1:28:38] just have church up here on the
[1:28:40] mountain last i heard
[1:28:43] he was getting high on cocaine
[1:28:48] but she said no
[1:28:50] god sent me here
[1:28:53] she said god told me this that brother
[1:28:56] jerry was my pastor
[1:28:59] and i'm not leaving here
[1:29:02] so many times as i said she went in the
[1:29:04] hospital the last time she went in the
[1:29:06] hospital her brother showed up there the
[1:29:08] same time i did and they led us in the
[1:29:10] back and she would always ask me
[1:29:13] brother jerry
[1:29:15] is god going to take me
[1:29:18] is this my time is god going to heal me
[1:29:21] and i would pray for her time and time
[1:29:23] again and god would raise her up
[1:29:27] but this time there was something
[1:29:28] different it dropped in
[1:29:31] and i told her i said sister
[1:29:34] what more healing could you ask for
[1:29:36] than to be in a new body in the next few
[1:29:39] moments
[1:29:42] that was good enough for her
[1:29:45] she had been holding the doctors off
[1:29:47] from giving her any kind of medication
[1:29:49] that would make her go unconscious until
[1:29:51] i got there
[1:29:53] to talk to her
[1:29:55] after i left from talking to her because
[1:29:57] they had her in intensive care they only
[1:29:58] let you in there for so long then she
[1:30:00] told them go ahead and give me the
[1:30:02] medicine
[1:30:03] she was in so much pain her legs had
[1:30:05] bust open
[1:30:09] and then i got a call later on that
[1:30:10] night
[1:30:11] from someone and they said brother jerry
[1:30:14] said she's unconscious
[1:30:16] she's up here at the hospital said i've
[1:30:17] got something i want to confess to her
[1:30:19] could you come up here and and pray for
[1:30:22] her that god will bring her back to
[1:30:27] so i went up there and i asked the
[1:30:28] nurses
[1:30:30] put him aside said i'm her pastor i want
[1:30:32] to ask you if she come back to how would
[1:30:34] her state be
[1:30:35] they said she'd be out of her mind
[1:30:38] i went in there
[1:30:39] i didn't pray out loud
[1:30:41] i just took all of her hand i said god
[1:30:43] if there's nothing stopping her from
[1:30:45] crossing over and being with you then go
[1:30:47] ahead and take her
[1:30:48] don't bring her back awake in this life
[1:30:52] and i walked out
[1:30:54] they called me by the time i got home
[1:30:55] they called me said she's passed
[1:31:00] she was healed
[1:31:03] she was walking in a new body
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:09] she no longer had all the diseases and
[1:31:12] ailments that she suffered in this life
[1:31:22] hallelujah
[1:31:28] that's the simplicity of the gospel
[1:31:34] philip findeth nathanael and say to him
[1:31:36] we have found him
[1:31:38] who moses in the law and the prophet
[1:31:40] said right jesus nazareth son of joseph
[1:31:45] nathaniel said unto him can any good
[1:31:47] thing come out of nashville
[1:31:50] that's a bad place
[1:31:55] he was skeptical
[1:32:00] philip didn't try to say anything else
[1:32:02] to convince him he just said come and
[1:32:03] see
[1:32:06] come and see for yourself
[1:32:11] so nathaniel gets up
[1:32:13] and he goes
[1:32:15] to
[1:32:16] see for himself
[1:32:18] and as he's approaching
[1:32:21] jesus says
[1:32:23] behold an israelite indeed
[1:32:28] in whom
[1:32:31] is no guile
[1:32:34] there is nothing false about him
[1:32:44] jesus never said he was without sin
[1:32:48] he said he was without guile
[1:32:52] he was without deceit
[1:32:57] friends
[1:32:58] there's not a one of us can stand up and
[1:33:00] say we're without sin
[1:33:05] in the bible it says if any man say he
[1:33:07] is he hasn't sinned he's a liar
[1:33:13] but we can be without guile
[1:33:16] we can be without deceit
[1:33:18] we can be without falseness
[1:33:22] brother of adam says he never liked
[1:33:23] anybody who put on something they
[1:33:27] like uh
[1:33:32] you remember in the bible when the
[1:33:34] pharisees
[1:33:36] came
[1:33:38] jesus gives this
[1:33:40] parable by the pharisee two men come to
[1:33:42] pharisee in a publican
[1:33:45] the pharisees stands and said i think
[1:33:47] the i'm not as other men
[1:33:49] are extortioners unjust adulterers even
[1:33:51] as this publican
[1:33:54] i fast twice a week i give tithes of all
[1:33:56] i possess
[1:33:58] he didn't say a thing about pride
[1:34:03] because he was full of that
[1:34:08] but the publican you know what a
[1:34:09] republican was he was a look friends
[1:34:12] israelites looked on
[1:34:14] other israelites the republicans they
[1:34:16] were tax collectors for rome
[1:34:20] and they looked at the other israelites
[1:34:23] that would stoop to becoming a tax
[1:34:25] collector for long for rome they looked
[1:34:28] down on them they wanted nothing to do
[1:34:30] with them
[1:34:32] can you imagine the other disciples when
[1:34:35] god when jesus called matthew
[1:34:39] we don't want to associate with him
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:45] but in the bible the republicans smote
[1:34:47] his breast he wouldn't even lift his
[1:34:48] eyes up to heaven
[1:34:50] he smote his breast and said god have
[1:34:52] mercy on me a sinner
[1:34:56] and jesus said
[1:34:58] which one of the two went out more just
[1:35:04] the pharisee was trying to justify
[1:35:06] himself
[1:35:08] i don't do this and i don't do that and
[1:35:10] i don't do this
[1:35:12] and this is what i do i fast and i i
[1:35:16] give my tithing and
[1:35:28] which one was more just the one trying
[1:35:30] to justify himself
[1:35:35] or the one steeped in self-deception
[1:35:41] and guile
[1:35:43] the pharisee was full of guile full of
[1:35:45] deceit
[1:35:55] saul got lifted up in the bible
[1:36:03] he didn't obey god
[1:36:06] he kept the best of the
[1:36:08] of the cattle the best of the sheep
[1:36:12] brought even brought the king back
[1:36:17] i have kept all the words of the lord
[1:36:21] samuel says what's this lowing of the ox
[1:36:24] that i hear
[1:36:28] and here's what he tells him he says
[1:36:33] thou has done foolishly thou has not
[1:36:35] kept the commandment of the lord thy god
[1:36:37] which he commanded thee for now would
[1:36:39] the lord have established thy kingdom
[1:36:41] upon israel forever but now thy kingdom
[1:36:44] shall not continue
[1:36:46] the lord hath sought him a man
[1:36:49] after his own heart
[1:36:52] and the lord hath commanded him to be
[1:36:54] captain over his people because thou has
[1:36:57] not kept that which the lord commanded
[1:36:59] thee
[1:37:07] stephen
[1:37:08] before he was stoned spoken and talked
[1:37:10] about and said david
[1:37:13] the son of jesse a man after god's own
[1:37:15] heart
[1:37:20] but david wasn't free of sin
[1:37:23] david wasn't free of mistakes
[1:37:27] but he was free of guile
[1:37:40] psalms 32
[1:37:42] 2 says blessed is the man
[1:37:44] unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity
[1:37:48] in whose spirit there is no guile
[1:38:10] david
[1:38:15] when he was confronted with his sin
[1:38:20] he confessed
[1:38:22] and he asked for forgiveness
[1:38:27] saul made excuses
[1:38:30] well it was the people
[1:38:32] you know
[1:38:33] the people were pressing on me and
[1:38:35] because of the people i i kept the best
[1:38:38] and and besides we were going to
[1:38:40] sacrifice them to to
[1:38:42] god he says obedience is better than
[1:38:46] sacrifice
[1:38:51] obedience is better
[1:38:53] to obey god
[1:38:56] hallelujah
[1:39:02] then you nathaniel was not a man that
[1:39:04] was free of mistakes
[1:39:06] jesus never said that
[1:39:09] he never said that nathaniel was never
[1:39:11] going to make any mistakes
[1:39:15] but friends
[1:39:16] nathanael
[1:39:18] when
[1:39:19] he saw the demonstration
[1:39:22] of the power
[1:39:24] of god in jesus
[1:39:28] he said
[1:39:29] you're the son of god
[1:39:32] there was something inside of him that
[1:39:34] recognized
[1:39:39] he was skeptical when philip told him
[1:39:42] but when jesus spoke to him
[1:39:45] it touched something on the inside
[1:39:47] something a man couldn't touch
[1:39:50] something a man couldn't do
[1:39:53] but when he heard the words of almighty
[1:39:56] god
[1:39:58] it brought something alive within him
[1:40:04] it isn't man's words that have brought
[1:40:07] you to this message
[1:40:09] it isn't man's words that have brought
[1:40:11] you to this
[1:40:14] but it's god's word
[1:40:17] it's god's voice
[1:40:19] that is spoken through the men that god
[1:40:22] has placed
[1:40:24] it wasn't their words it wasn't their
[1:40:26] voices but it was the voice of many
[1:40:29] wallets
[1:40:34] eve didn't recognize the voice behind
[1:40:37] the voice
[1:40:40] the voice of the serpent had a voice
[1:40:42] behind it it was the voice of satan
[1:40:48] and i'm going to tell you something
[1:40:50] those that are
[1:40:52] trying to lead people away from this
[1:40:54] message
[1:40:55] they're serpent seed
[1:40:58] the voice that is behind them is the
[1:41:01] voice of
[1:41:02] satan
[1:41:04] recognize the voice
[1:41:13] i just believe
[1:41:15] that it happened amen
[1:41:23] hallelujah
[1:41:28] i don't have a facebook but
[1:41:32] i have saw on facebook
[1:41:35] some of these ones that
[1:41:38] look if you got a facebook i'm not
[1:41:40] condemning you
[1:41:41] but i've saw on facebook
[1:41:44] some of these ones who have left the
[1:41:45] message
[1:41:47] pictures of them sitting around a table
[1:41:49] outside drinking beer
[1:41:54] pictures of them with their cut hair and
[1:41:57] wearing pants
[1:42:00] why because they were under such bondage
[1:42:04] now they can do what they want
[1:42:10] they've been beguiled
[1:42:12] they've been deceived
[1:42:16] and they're being used by satan
[1:42:27] brother brahm says i've made many
[1:42:29] mistakes i still make them
[1:42:32] we'll always make them
[1:42:34] but when i make them the holy spirit
[1:42:36] tells me what's wrong
[1:42:38] then i repent right there
[1:42:41] that's the simplicity of the gospel
[1:42:43] that's the simplicity that's in christ
[1:42:45] jesus
[1:42:48] when you're made of wherever you you
[1:42:50] repent right then
[1:42:52] lord i'm sorry i didn't mean that
[1:42:54] i didn't mean to do that
[1:43:01] lord forgive me i didn't mean to do it
[1:43:04] you helped me now and i walk right on
[1:43:06] the same cause just no sooner than it
[1:43:09] goes from my lips
[1:43:13] if we confess our sins he is just you
[1:43:16] forgive them
[1:43:18] is that right
[1:43:21] the devil said you know what i tell you
[1:43:22] you're supposed to go do a certain thing
[1:43:24] you didn't do it uh-huh you sinned
[1:43:26] didn't you i say i confessed it
[1:43:31] said well i tell you no don't talk to me
[1:43:34] i have perfect faith in he who told me
[1:43:38] if i confessed my wrongs he'd forgive me
[1:43:41] so i confessed it just go on away from
[1:43:44] me i don't care anything about you
[1:43:46] anyhow so just keep moving on walk
[1:43:49] boldly right on
[1:43:51] into it if death lays there that's all
[1:43:54] right move right on into it with perfect
[1:43:56] faith that god has promised he'd raise
[1:43:58] you up at the last day
[1:44:08] i got a lot of respects for a man when
[1:44:10] he does make a mistake
[1:44:11] he's got the courage enough to rise and
[1:44:13] try again
[1:44:16] we're all going to make mistakes the
[1:44:18] best makes mistakes
[1:44:21] for i have made many mistakes in my life
[1:44:23] as we all have but i always be thankful
[1:44:26] to god for grace to let me rise and try
[1:44:29] again
[1:44:34] i believe the song is entitled forgive
[1:44:36] me lord and try me one more time i think
[1:44:38] it is
[1:44:41] if i fail or if i sin let me rise and
[1:44:43] try again
[1:44:46] take me back and try me one more time
[1:44:48] i love that
[1:44:53] we know we make mistakes
[1:44:57] but you mustn't look at that
[1:44:59] it's not your mistakes because you're
[1:45:01] always going to have them
[1:45:04] stumble and falling has not one thing to
[1:45:06] do with it
[1:45:07] a real true servant if he stumbles he'll
[1:45:09] get right up again if he wobbles god
[1:45:12] will pull him right back into the path
[1:45:14] as long as he's in the path of duty
[1:45:17] as long as he's in the path of duty
[1:45:19] god's obligated to him knowing
[1:45:21] that he's just a man
[1:45:23] or a woman
[1:45:26] we're human
[1:45:32] when i got the whole yost
[1:45:35] i got it in here
[1:45:39] down in my soul
[1:45:42] i still got a human spirit
[1:45:45] i still got memories of my sin
[1:45:50] i still have to deal with reasoning
[1:45:53] i still have affections and imagination
[1:46:01] and this flesh is still in contact with
[1:46:03] this world
[1:46:04] this flesh didn't get the holy ghost
[1:46:08] this flesh is still in the fallen state
[1:46:11] this flesh still
[1:46:12] signifies that sin
[1:46:15] in the garden
[1:46:17] it still signifies
[1:46:19] of one who was beguiled
[1:46:24] but there's something in here that
[1:46:25] cannot be beguiled
[1:46:30] because man didn't give it to me
[1:46:33] and man can't take it away
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:36] hallelujah
[1:46:38] there's not one thing that any man can
[1:46:40] say that will shake me
[1:46:43] i'm unmovable
[1:46:48] i'm at rest i stand firm like a tree
[1:46:52] planted by the water i shall not be
[1:46:55] moved
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] and one day
[1:47:00] i'll stand with the large redeemed
[1:47:02] before the throne of christ
[1:47:08] hallelujah
[1:47:16] got no time for their foolishness
[1:47:22] i know it for what it is
[1:47:25] it's the beguiling ways of the devil
[1:47:30] and the bible said there would be a
[1:47:32] great falling away
[1:47:34] before the man of sin was revealed
[1:47:37] and that's what that's what we're
[1:47:39] experiencing that tells you what time
[1:47:41] we're in
[1:47:43] where we're at on god's timeline
[1:47:46] the great falling away
[1:47:50] right
[1:47:51] before
[1:47:53] the man of sin is to be revealed and
[1:47:55] before the man of sin is revealed
[1:47:58] the bride goes up
[1:48:01] the bride will not be here
[1:48:06] hallelujah
[1:48:08] i'm looking forward to leaving
[1:48:12] i've got too much over there
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:18] i've got more laid up over there than i
[1:48:20] have here
[1:48:25] i've got more to go to heaven for
[1:48:29] than i did yesterday
[1:48:33] hallelujah
[1:48:39] there's not one thing can hold me here
[1:48:45] i'm thankful for all god gives me but
[1:48:47] not one of them am i willing to hang on
[1:48:50] to and miss the rapture over
[1:48:57] hallelujah

[1:49:52] holiness
[1:49:54] i'm not putting on to be a righteous
[1:49:57] person
[1:49:59] but my righteousness is because of his
[1:50:01] righteousness

[1:52:21] he was subject to like passions
[1:52:26] he was tempted
[1:52:27] he was tested
[1:52:32] but yet when he prayed
[1:52:35] it stopped raining
[1:52:39] that was god judging israel for their
[1:52:41] sin
[1:52:42] the heavens came as brass
[1:52:46] judgment
[1:52:53] and when he prayed again
[1:52:54] it rained right
[1:53:02] he wasn't sinless
[1:53:06] but he was without guile
[1:53:11] elijah wasn't a put on
[1:53:14] he wasn't an actor
[1:53:18] friends when he was up there on mount
[1:53:20] carmel
[1:53:22] and he put out that challenge
[1:53:24] he said go ahead
[1:53:26] said uh
[1:53:29] call your god bill come down and set a
[1:53:31] fire to your sacrifice
[1:53:36] boy they were doing all kinds of things
[1:53:40] the bible said they even cut themselves
[1:53:42] and screamed aloud because elijah said
[1:53:45] maybe your god's gone on vacation
[1:53:48] maybe he's gone on a long trip
[1:53:52] and he can't hear you
[1:53:54] and they screamed the louder
[1:53:58] but no fire came down
[1:54:02] but elijah said the fire was going to
[1:54:04] come down and consume his his
[1:54:06] sacrifice that wasn't no put on
[1:54:11] he could say that because god had spoke
[1:54:14] it was thus saith the lord
[1:54:20] without the channel just see who's the
[1:54:22] true god
[1:54:24] god was obligated
[1:54:27] prove
[1:54:28] he was the true god
[1:54:33] hallelujah that wasn't a you can imagine
[1:54:37] then we find out who were the actors
[1:54:40] who were the ones who were putting on
[1:54:41] before the people
[1:54:44] who were the fakes
[1:54:48] who were the fakers
[1:54:57] but elijah
[1:54:59] was true
[1:55:01] he was real
[1:55:03] he was just
[1:55:04] who he was
[1:55:08] he never presented himself to be sinless
[1:55:10] but he presented himself
[1:55:13] to be a servant
[1:55:14] of jehovah
[1:55:18] hallelujah
[1:55:21] i don't know nothing false
