home from Brother Paul in the congregation and it's real good to be here with you again and um we'll just read the word and then I'll I'll let you be seated and then we'll just get reacquainted a little bit Psalms 107 verse 8-22 oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and filth the hungry soul with goodness such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in Affliction and iron because they rebelled against the words of God and contemned the counsel of the most high therefore he brought down their heart with labor they fell down and there was none to help him then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and break their bands in Sunder oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron and Sunder fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted their their soul uph whth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of Thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing it's just pray father we come before you this Thursday evening and we're we're thankful Lord we're grateful we've sung the songs of Zion Lord we've worshiped you father and now Lord we look to your word and just ask that you speak Lord help us each one to get out of the way that we could speak and hear from you in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated we greet you in the name of the Lord this evening and it's good to be here it's good to stand before you um I'm understand that you were praying for me through my trial that we've been through and uh so I want to personally thank you for all your prayers and um I have no explanation as to what it was I have no explanation as to why I'm standing here now other than that it was your prayers that that brought me out and um I honestly don't know what took me in so um we're just on the other side and we're grateful and I I just wonder I just wonder sometimes if God does it just to just there's something in it I know that there's something in it so I'm grateful for that but um I don't know how much you heard but um we started back in August last year um the first weekend we were out school shopping and and uh I just just not feeling too good and um uh just I I don't know what how to describe it really next morning the same thing happened um and then a right after that uh it just seemed like it was it was heart attack symptoms um and so just the full thing full spectrum of it and um so that went on I had about six episodes in about a week and a half um finally was up in I work up in Ann Arbor in the office a couple days a week remote a couple more and I was I was just feeling the worst I had and so I went to my boss's office and I said there's a fire station around the corner I said I think I need to go get checked and so from there they checked me out and they said well would you like us to call the ambulance and I said well you're the professional so you tell me and they said well why don't we call them they can check you out okay well they get there and she's checking me out you know they chat with you and everything and then she stood up and she said well what hospital you want to go to and I said well is it that bad and she said well let me you know so you just you hear all stories you know brother-in-laws and things that fell over dead and she was saying because they didn't get checked out and they should have and um so I said well let's go so that started the journey and it was just a roller coaster ride from there um a lot of things in between but I had gotten so weak that um we had a fall Fellowship in October and I I just I I couldn't hardly walk and from that point um I just couldn't walk across the house even uh so I again I don't have an explanation they finally ruled out the heart um and then they they went on to the the brain and I'm grateful that they found a heart and they found a brain so that that rolled out a lot for a lot of people who were wondering I got pictures so so I'm grateful and you know but it it it just um well I just put it this way uh so Janu come January was I was starting to do a little bit better January 1st we got the flu um and it was the worst probably one of the worst flu that I had had well they said probably because coming out of whatever it was I was coming out of went into the flu I went right into pneumonia and bronchitis and um so it just it just wiped me out and it was like if I couldn't have been down lower physically emotionally spiritually it was like the Lord just said well there's a little bit lower you can go and so we went there and uh so I was there was one night I I was coming out of that and and I guess apparently it's something that can happen when you come out of pneumonia but you can break out into like a rash type and um so I I ended up having these bumps all over my back and uh uh coming out of the pneumonia and um I was sitting in the chair and my wife and I were talking and I said well I said I'm going to go sit on my ash Heap and scrp whatever this is and she didn't find that too funny but I did and uh cuz if you know job and the story of Job And so um you know I just been filling my heart you know to go read job and that was kind of the the push to go read job so uh I'm going to read to you out of job tonight we read in Psalms and I'm just trusting that the Lord as I was studying um this is something I preached two parts of back home and there was there was a little SE in there just the Lord kind of took me different um yet last night and and today so I just pray it's a blessing to you I'm just stepping in faith trusting in Him because it's a little different than what I expected but um if you don't mind I'm going to read out of the NIV I hope that doesn't offend anybody but it just reading the book of job I had to have three different translations to get through it and and to come out with some kind of understanding so I'm going to read in uh job 36 starting at verse 4 and um you can follow along again I'll read in the NIV so it'll be a little bit different but um I like I I chose this version because I didn't feel like it was removing anything but it it put it into layman's terms for me Eli who speaking um which if you the story of Job there's three friends come to job well there's a fourth that just kind of showed up I guess I don't know but um it talks about eliu and um we'll we'll just talk a little bit more about him in in a bit but verse uh four be assured that my words are not false one who has perfect knowledge is with you and he's not talking about himself here he's talking about Jesus about God God is mighty but despises no one he is mighty and firm in his purpose he does not keep the wicked alive but gives The Afflicted their rights he does not take his eyes off the righteous he enthrones them with Kings and exalts them forever but if people are bound in Chains held fast by cords of Affliction he tells them what they have done that they have sinned arrogantly he makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil if they obey him and serve him they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity in their years and contentment but if they do not listen they will perish By The Sword and die die without true knowledge the Godless in heart Harbor resentment even when he Fetters them they do not cry for help they die in their youth among male prostitutes of the shrines but those who suffer he delivers in their suffering he speaks to them in their Affliction notice he speaks to them in their Affliction he is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious Place free from restriction that's good to the Comfort of your table Laden with Choice Foods so as you go through job you realize that you know nobody's been through as bad of a trial as job I wouldn't say um as I was reading job you know you look for a time frame because if you've been through a trial of any length of time and and I just want to say this right off to the start is you know you can't compare your trial to mine and I can't compare my trial to yours because we know that trials were predestinated for you they're tailored to you and that doesn't seem very fair but yet if we know that our trials are more precious than gold yeah have F gold then we know that we can have confidence that that trial has a purpose and that it's the refining fires that's going to bring more if you know anything about gold and and the refining fire as the master smith beats the gold he's beating out all the dross and all the all the imperfections all the impurities and he knows when that gold is refined when he can see his reflection in it and so we go through through our tests and our trials knowing that it's it's the master beating us beating the draw out beating the the impurities out and so that he can see himself so that you reflect Christ in in his fullness and so we don't know exactly how long job's trial was we know that he lost everything in one day the first chapter of job you'll you'll find that while while the servant yet spake the other servant came and while he yet spake the other servant came and while he yet spake the other servant came so this is just bam bam bam bam bam I I don't know job was just probably whiplashed by what just happened and then it says that we get we get another uh inclination as to how much time and um brother I see you back there I just want to say I appreciate the violin you played God bless you the violin has a special place in my heart I just love it and so where were we uh so we know that he after that first day he sat in silence for seven days on the ash Heap because it says when his friends came that they sat in silence they they they uh rent their clothes they sat with him mourning for seven days and they were silent and um we'll get a little bit this this shifted more towards his friends it was just something that when I was preaching I just felt strongly to go into more and so you're getting it tonight but um he uh you know they said as I was reading different things on job and on his friends they said thee best things that his friends did was they just sat with their mouth shut for seven days where they got into trouble was when they opened their mouth and tried to comfort job so so and you know I think I've said it before here and and I remember actually I believe um saying it here was that you know that that little story about the boy and he lost his parents in the fire and you probably remember and um just couldn't get him to talk talk and another little boy came just going quickly through it and U and it just reminded me this this here was where I saw that in the scripture was how do you comfort somebody who's going through a trial how do you comfort someone who's going through a loss sometimes it's just sitting quiet and and crying with them just just sitting with them and and not saying much I think you know we have pure desires to help and comfort each other and uh sometimes though it just it's it's I don't know how to say this and and it not sounds uh straight but sometimes it's just not helpful um I I found that you and I don't mean that in a bad way I just mean there really it's only God who can Comfort blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted and the and he is the comforter amen so then in job 7:3 are you staying with me okay this is coming out faster than I thought it would so uh job uh just a lot of hay on my Fork I guess job uh 7 and verse three we get another uh insight and he says there's it says months of long nights of misery job refers to there's months of of long nights of misery and so we know that this trial probably went on for months and and you know it's a trial in a day can make you feel exhausted by the end of the day you make it three days you make it a week but you you go months and and it's just exhausting it it and and it really it can have an impact on us in ways that I I I didn't realize it could have an impact on you and and I'll just say this from my experience just being uh transparent is you know really you can you can turn to a lot of things in your trials and when you're feeling that low and um you know you can turn to a lot of things that that you shouldn't there there's a lot of things out there that we can draw comfort from and and Satan puts those things before us and and a lot of times they're just easier to turn to and you know especially when you're feeling low spiritually and and emotionally and and just mentally you're just you you don't have it it feels like you don't have the mental compartment to to Really retain anything and so you just well there's no point in going to it so you you know choose an entertainment or something is that okay so then in in uh job 4 uh we we just I just want to give you um just relating with job through his trial and and just the the emotions and everything that he goes through job 4 and verse three again this is the in the NIV one of job's his first friend uh talking think how you have instructed many how you have strengthened feeble hands your words have supported those who stumbled you have strengthen faltering knees but now Trouble Comes To You job and you are discouraged it strikes you and you're dismayed it comes to you and you faint and you're grieved and and you know it's just kind of like job you're down but here let me slap you in the face and knock you down a little bit lower and job really didn't need that he didn't need that not at all it comes to you and you faint and are grieved job in his trial now this is through reading the book of job job and his trial becomes weary of life and in multiple places he said God is coming against him and and it feels it's without cause and that this trial has no purpose God's doing it just because he's God he's just doing it because he's God and he can be mean that's that's the reason he's doing it God's doing it because he's God job's purpose and plans are shattered in verse 17:1 it says job's purpose and plans are shattered and and you know sometimes you can be going headlong and you've got your plan you've got your purpose you've got your vision and and you're walking towards you you're moving towards it and then all of a sudden it's just like someone takes the rug and just rips it out from under you and and then and then stands back and laughs at you right and these are all the things you can feel in a trial and and so uh 1716 it's job says his hope is gone uh 1911 job says God has counted him among his enemies this is how job's feeling through his trial chapter 19 job describes feeling alone abandoned and desolate and one of the things you know I thought of was Jesus on the cross cried out my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me we know that David said the same thing prophesying that that those words and and I think as Christians we all we can all go I think we all go through those times where we just we step back and we say my God my God why have you forsaken me I don't understand this lord it's too heavy verse uh I believe it's 15 and chapter 19 job says I am full of confusion wow I am full of confusion job in his confusion he he says he says if I could just speak with God so job's going through this trial and he and he just doesn't feel like he's connected with God at all he he's God where are you where are you in this trial I if I could just the tri fine take me through the trial but if I could just hear from you and yet it's like God just goes silent and it's the worst feeling yes it is it's the worst feeling to feel you're going through a trial and and the one who who is is supposed to be there to comfort you the one who's there that you're looking for answers from it's it's like he's just silent and it's and it's heavy it's a it's a heavy burden to bear it and and it and and your your emotions and it's one thing to be down physically but then spiritually you can be down and emotionally you can be down and and mentally you can be down and then you dip into depression and and it's and it's just an awful state to be in and and by the way you're responding I know that you're relating to to to job to myself and to each other and I and I think friends I think that many times we we we want to be spiritual we want to be strong and yet there's times in life when we're just not and I think and I think that that's okay and I think that we shouldn't put on a front I I in fact I don't when you're when you're in the depths of it it's just like God said says you can try but you're not going to put on a front this time no matter how much you want to seem strong to everyone around you you're just you're going to be you're going to be weak right now and we know that in our weakness he's made strong and and that's hard to understand and it's hard to accept but yet through the trials of life and through our weaknesses he's made strong job and his absolute confusion says if I could just speak to God if I if I knew where he was right I would walk up to his to his door and I would knock on the door and I would say God I need to talk to you but but he he didn't feel he couldn't find that place and so because he couldn't find that place himself job actually says if there was just a mediator if there was somebody that I knew that could put their hand on me and put their hand on God and just mediate for us and I believe that job was looking ahead to see Jesus Christ on this Earth to know that there's one mediator between God and man and that's Jesus Christ there's a high priest of our that of our profession there's he he knows your Affliction he can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity and even when you don't feel like it he's touched by the feeling of your infirmity and I'm just I just feel compelled to say this now I wanted to say it later but if you watch The Book of Job I in in the first two chapters you'll find that God was fully aware what was going on with job Satan came to God and and God said where are you going where did you come from where are you going and he says have you considered this is God have you considered my servant job have you considered this man have you considered this woman have you considered this child have you considered him Satan and and you know Satan says well yeah but you know look look of course any man will be that way look at you got a hedge around him and so then he he afflicts J then we have the the the first day all this is taken from job and then it says that Satan came back and God says hey have you considered job job is completely unaware what is going on in this other dimension I I believe that job would hey wait wait a second Lord I'd like to be uh can we have a meeting here but God says have you considered my servant job again the second time and then Satan says well yeah but a life for a life I mean look at you I mean any man this is this is external stuff but you touch let me touch his flesh he'll curse you and God says okay you can touch him take him as far as you want to go but you can't take his life glory and so it doesn't matter what the trial is there's a there's a point Satan can only go so far and he might he might flirt on that line but God is watching in the whole time and I and I know that Satan knows he can't cross that line God's just watching him God's God's sitting there and he's just all eyes on job and he's watching glory and Satan can I come down here yeah it's Thursday night I'll wake you up and I imagine Satan's just walking and he's just touching job you going through a trial right now you don't got to answer that and he just he just touches job and he's taken him so far and then he looks back to see if God's watching just cuz he wants to take him just as far as he can but he turns and look and God's watching him the whole time burning a hole right in the back of Satan say I'm watching you watching you buddy so if you're going through a trial just know he can only go so far amen glory amen amen that's good so in this state of job feeling this way of going through this trial of trying to find God in from stage left comes three friends three friends and you know you look at it and you just want how in the world can you call them friends but I was thinking about this and it just I'm I'm just going to go this way if it's okay tonight I just trust the Lord here but you know it's it's uh these These are men that that they sat with each other they laughed with each other they fellowshipped with each other they they they talked about deep things of God together and And yet when you're reading job job and his friends if I could just bring it to speak maybe our speak our language they could they could talk message talk right they could talk the scripture they could of course they didn't have a Bible then but you know I'm just putting it in our terms they could talk the word they could talk the message of the hour they could talk these things they could talk the talk and they could walk the walk they knew quotes they knew scriptures but yet they through the whole book They're swinging it at each other they're using the precious word of God to bring harm to one another they're just swinging it left and right and they cut this way and cut coming back and and you know really um no just when you look at it um if I can say it this way it's it's really I just thought you know this is a bunch of old guys sitting around talking about who knows more than the other one right is that okay yeah okay they really had a time though of telling each other what each others knew I know this and I know this and I know that and bless God and you know it's just this back and forth and it's just like my goodness guys you should have more wisdom than this yeah stop and I imagine you know so any anyway but then one of job's friends and this is this is just what I labored in in in study and one of job's friends tells him he says and and I'm assuming he meant it more as a dream than a vision but he calls it the vision I think a vision of of the night has a dream or a vision and he tells job this job I'm going to tell you something now I had a vision for your life I I dreamed a dream and this job this is thus saith the Lord for you and it and it and it's we saw a prophet in our day and so we know the reverence of God for someone who has a gift of vision and prophecy we reverence that sure you don't want to argue with that and and understand I'm not talking about our Prophet now I'm just talking about that reverence for that gift that we can we can understand we can we can relate with that but then you have somebody come and say I had a dream for you I had a vision for you the spirit is leading me now and we can look at look at our day and the prophet in our day and everyone wanted a vision for them for for their life for their need I I have this need and if I could just get to brother brandom if I could if he' just see a vision and he could just tell me if he could just tell me what's going on in this trial if he could just give me direction what what decision do I make I and really it takes the faith out of your life right I know I know it's there to build Faith but you know I I if it we can just relate it back to the Jews you know lay lay on of hands and and seeking a sign and Jesus said a wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign but yet you have a Roman Centurian come and he said Lord I'm not worthy for you to come in my house just speak the word and that's the way we know that that's the greater that's the greater faith is is just speak the word we just look to the word and that's and that's where our faith rests but we know that that men and women of that day became reliant on that gift they they had to see a vision and we're not exempt from that I think if we lived in that day we had that going on we it's easy to become ring on so we cannot start to understand this scenario here with job so what a fearful thing when he says the spirit is leading me I have thus sayith the Lord for you job but if you look at his vision if you look at this dream and if you look at you know the Spirit came to me in the night and the and the hair it stood up on my body it was just oh it was a fearful thing and and I don't mean to poke fun at this but when you start looking at what the spirit said to him first of all he couldn't make it out it was Fuzzy it was it was it wasn't clear and and it and it it was fearful but yet when it started speaking and and I in my Bible now they didn't have Bibles now but in my Bible when you take that back to the word there's there's anytime an angel came It Was Fear not I'm come from the Lord fear not not and it was a clear I I I could be wrong friends you can correct me afterwards but I don't remember any time in the scripture where someone says that was an angel of the Lord and I couldn't make out his figure Joshua saw a man he knew it was a man and his sword he had a sword in his [Music] hand so it just the the vision was flawed and if job had a Bible I don't think he could take that Vision back to the word the things he was saying and and it it was something along the lines of God doesn't use man he can't trust him or something like that well we know that that's false because God uses man all the time even with his his his uh all his faults and failures so the vision just doesn't line up with God's word so you start to see this this image of this man coming and and he's he means well he's sincere but yet the whole thing is flawed are you with me yeah job's friends continually tell him he's not speaking or living the message true he's not speaking or living have you ever heard that before I can't I I mean if I went off of what people said I'm not a Christian because I've been told that so many times you're not a Christian you're not message enough and and I don't know where we get off thinking we can tell each other you don't have the Holy Ghost because we know that even Beyond a vision even Beyond a gift the gift of the Holy ghost is the greatest gift you can ever receive in your life the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what we're striving for that's what we're longing for that's what we want is the very spirit of God living in you leading you guiding you directing you fellowshipping with you when you don't feel him you know he's there because he's living in you the holy ghost means everything to us and yet if you have somebody especially somebody you have confidence in tell you well you don't have the Holy Ghost that'll set you back and I and I just I just don't agree with it I I that maybe that's just me personally but I just don't agree with that because there was a time in one of brother branham's meetings he was being criticized for the woman that was playing the piano it was a young girl and he said I know the way she's dressed he said I I wish she wouldn't wear that either but he said but you know you you come to her and you lash out and he said you might hinder what God's doing in her life to say she don't have the Holy Ghost you don't know that and you might hinder her and you might you might break her spirit by saying that you might break the work of God that he's doing in her life maybe she just hasn't come that far yet but yet we feel spiritual we I feel L of God to tell you you don't have the Holy Ghost have mercy Lord people are always seeking something spiritual I believe it's a pure desire most of the time time cuz I was thinking you know that that one man was chasing after Paul and uh I I forget who was with him at the time but they were chasing after Paul and he said hey how much how much for the Holy Ghost I'll pay you for it right and we know that he was just wanting to make gains off of doing the works and so that's why I say most of the time the desires P are you with me tonight is this okay okay I believe um people failed to understand the anointing God has placed in his church for the edification of his bride we know that there's a five-fold Ministry and there's different anointings there's different gifts in that fivefold and and each one has its place each one has its purpose and in Desiring the spiritual and the supernatural they'll call their Pastor who's the Ox of the team not spiritual enough because he's the ox and and this is this is just um somebody preached this at our church a while ago I can't somebody asked for the link I said hey I'd like to listen to that too so this is this is where some of this is coming from and in Desiring that and and so they look at their pastor and they say he's the ox of the team and the ox is down on the ground he's he's he's pushing he's pulling he's working and that doesn't seem very spiritual ual when the ox is full of sweat when he's tired after a long day it's it's not very fun it's not it's not very spiritual and so they'll look at the pastor and they'll say he's not spiritual enough he doesn't preach the word of the hour like brother so and so so he must not be he's there's something missing in his ministry and so it starts to make him unsettled and they start looking at at at other Ministries that are more spiritual and it's it's funny I'm finding this um even just as assistant pastor back home I just sometimes I think the Lord just gives me little taste to know what the pastor goes through I I I don't know but a pastor will preach a series for weeks and then the Evangelist comes and everyone in the congregation says oh my goodness I've never heard this before and the poor Pastor the poor ox has just spent months preaching the exact same thing but you know it's not as it's not as charismatic it's not as flat it's not as just coming through and and you know ripping tearing it's just it's it's the ox and he's taking his time and he's just he's he's laboring with you and he's making sure you know he's making sure you know that this this brother comes and this sister comes and he's just hey let's take oh nope wait we got to go back here we don't we not miss leaving any come on come on this way where the Evangelist is just like hey you get up or you get out you and he's just flying through the aisle and and you know but but poor Pastor you know he's just ax of the team and he's got to Bear it just keep keep trudging along but you know the Evangelist the teacher they get it's it's a higher uh it looks better it sounds more spiritual but it's different anointings yeah that's it and Paul Paul said that the Corinthian Church was comparing themselves amongst themselves and then called him carnal for doing it yeah so you know I understand that you know that was men maybe saying well I'm not this gift and I'm not that gift and so I'm not this I'm I'm not as good as this one but I'm better than this one and so there's carnal comparisons that way but yet you can have a congregation or or or the body of Christ around the world that you know they gravitate towards one Minister and that's fine but yet but yet are you with me okay felt a little stiff there but you know they'll gravitate towards one Minister because you know because he's better he's flashier and and and yet you leave what about the little guy over here that the he's a faithful Pastor he's a faithful Minister and he's and he's his reward will be just as great as the as the big name preachers and so you can have the body of Christ comparing men and well I got to have this one pray for me when brother bandam said if you just have your pastor pray for you you don't you can't get to your P have the sister pray for you she can lay you can lay hands on each other brothers you can lay hands on each other and so you know we just it's it's just this it's just something in human nature that we we gravitate towards these things we we we start comparing ministers and we compare you know we compare ourselves amongst ourselves and we ought not to the prophet called it carnal comparisons right Paul said one man SWS another Waters but God gives the increase so I don't care how good the ministry is over here or the ministry is over there or or this church compared to this church it's God gets the god gets the glory it's God who Waters it's God who who's who's bringing forth the life that's in the plant amen job's friends kept telling him he's got sin in his life job you got sin in your life there's something wrong you're not as spiritual as we are because you're going through this trial you've got to have something in your life there's got there's something wrong somewhere they assume the role of God and boldly declare that God is doing what what God is doing in job's life overriding God's ability to to speak to job to himself it just moneyed the waters I know job felt like God you're not speaking to me but then his friends start speaking and it just made things muddy job's trial if you read the book job's trial was not because of sin and his friends were wrong why and I just asked myself why do we as mortal humans gravitate towards the negative towards something like that well there's sin in your life why do we gravitate towards that way someone sinned and that's why they don't have the Holy Ghost and that's why that explains it is it because we're putting it as something we think we can control or something that we can do in it now I know you you if you haven't realized this you can't give yourself anything from God the scripture says who can add one cubit to his stature by trying sis I want you to be seven foot tall can you do that tomorrow tomorrow morning it's 8 now you got 12 hours make yourself 7 foot tall you couldn't do it you could try you could just you know stand in the shower watering and throw fertilizer at your feet and you'll never be seven foot tall not by tomorrow anyway but what what can who can add one cubit to his stature who can who can give themsel the Holy Ghost and and and now oh help me you know we we know that there's things you got to hunger and thirst and but you can't even give yourself that hunger and thirst that has to come from God oh yeah hunger and thirst I I want you to be in church every time the doors are open well you have to have a hunger and thirst to be in church every time the doors are open and and the minister the pastor the minister can't give that to you you can't give it to yourself I think you can pray you can certainly pray God I don't I'm I this is missing in my life and you you have to go to the one who can give it to you if ye as fathers and mothers know how to give your children good gifts if you know how to give your nieces and nephew's good gifts how much more your heavenly father and then Jesus says how much more the he the Holy Ghost PR the Lord so we know we've heard these things you seek it you you seek and you shall find you got to seek it you got to get hungry for it you have to stay at the altar well you cannot oh boy you can't stay at the altar 24 hours a day 7 days a week until you feel like you've got the Holy Ghost the the the wind comes where it listeth and who can tell where it way it went and so so you know the the man that was I I this is completely free the the man was was seeking God he was seeking what his wife had and it was just brother Bram said well brother the the moment that you picked up that pamphlet and you couldn't get away from it that was God dealing with you and he said you mean I've had it this whole time and he said yeah how simple how simple and yet we complicate it we we you know that's why I I think you know we we gravitate towards the negative because well you don't have the Holy Ghost well you just got to stay there till you get it well you just gave them something to do oh yeah and if it's a gift you don't do anything for a gift I hope this is this okay brother okay deacons if I'm off just start waving your hands and close the service but it's just it's just something that I it's it's it's a burden on my heart because young people young people and old but especially young people when they're told you know you you don't have this you need this and and now I I do believe God put a pastor in your life and I believe that God can speak through a man of God to you but I think I think as men of God we can we we can give oursel too much Liberty to tell you what you need and what you don't need when God's the one who can tell you that you don't need to come up here in a prayer line and me tell you what you have need of God can speak to you through the preaching of the word that's how that's how he does it I mean that's the intent is it not while while Peter yet spake these words amen friends I feel the Holy Ghost here cuz I did not have any of this so I just pray I pray you receive I pray you receive God bless you amen we are all over Lord you know this is another statement that I don't I think we throw around too much is well you just need faith I'm sorry but again you'll just you'll just crush somebody who's who's trying to believe who's who's praying who's who's ask who's seeking god well you just need Faith yeah I just think we got to be careful because that crushes somebody's spirit and and then what you know you might be responsible someday for them giving up it's it's brother bham said it's our attitude our attitude can determine their outcome can determine their destination and so we have to be careful with our attitude we have to be careful with our knowledge we have to be careful when somebody new comes into the congregation comes to visit we have to be careful how are you looking at them how are you how are you talking how are you interacting do they feel welcome here I want to read John John chapter n can can you pull that up well I'll just keep turning John chapter 9 verse one John chapter 9 verse one are you with me tonight amen and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and a and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind so here's that thinking again yeah this man's this man's blind because somebody somewhere sinned yeah this is Jesus's response Jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor has par but this is the reason he's blind that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work so Jesus is saying this man is blind because God is going to get the glory praise the Lord and the man was healed yeah so I just bring this out to say you know we gravitate towards those things they don't have this they did this this this is in their life and yet Jesus Jesus argue with this I mean my Bible this is in red Jesus said nobody sinned this is that God would be glorified and then you have a young woman in a wheelchair sitting in the services and she's a Wallflower for the Lord bringing God glory sitting in a wheelchair well wouldn't wouldn't jumping up out of the wheelchair and running the aisles wouldn't that bring God the most glory and yet her attitude sitting in a wheelchair brought God glory that's there are elements of God let me just you know the blind man he couldn't help being blind his parents couldn't help him there was an appointed time and purpose for him to be healed there's an there was an appointed time for you to accept Christ and be filled with his spirit I believe and only God knows when that is yes sir now this is a quote says nothing you can do God already did it and you just have to accept it and by Sovereign Grace believe it not just just have faith your faith the scripture says is a gift and a gift from God it's Sovereign Grace that gives you Faith to believe oh my I just wor Matthew 16:18 you don't have to turn there I'm just going to reference a story it's been something burning in my heart and I just if if the Lord will help me this will all make sense by the time we're done Matthew 16:18 jesus takes his disciples to cir Philippi cere Philippi is is um at the at Mount HB I think and and at this mountain the the the Heathen the Greeks the the Romans they've set up shrines on this mountain because in this mountain there's a there's a cave and in the wintertime I think I don't know if the waters come out or recede in the spring the waters flow and so people in their nature to you know have something spiritual have something that they can do in it they believed that this was a gate to the world right that that the God and it became the god of fertility that they worshiped here and they did unspeakable things um and and I just we'll just leave it at that it became the epicenter of pagan worship of the worst kind true and yet Jesus brings his disciples to this place there Jesus Jesus asked who does man say that I am and then he asks well who do you say that I am so Jesus is standing among pagan gods in the Pagan place of worship in the middle of sexual disgraceful acts Jesus goes where no other person who's following Jehovah would go not only by himself but he brings disciples with him he steps into the worst of sin I want you to catch this because wherever you're at tonight Jesus steps into the worst of sin to speak the word of what was prevailing power over sin and the enemy now in this place this gate to the underworld it's actually called the gates of hell right right and it's here that Jesus says Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it so Jesus brings his disciples to this place of the worst kind that's called the gates of hell and he says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it so I you know I was just reminded as I was looking at this that the rock that I'll build my church is the rock of Revelation and upon Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the Revelation that God has given you Jesus Jesus says his church is going to be built on this now I'm quoting now Satan tries to destroy confidence in the word but when she believes the bride believes uh disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her it's the revelation of God that gives you authority over the devil so it's through that Revelation and and and and we could say Revelation is is is Faith and how do you get Faith Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so when you come to church and the word is coming forth you're being ministered Revelation you're in that channel that God can speak to you and that God can give you Faith you're in that channel that God can give you prevailing overcoming power that Satan cannot th he has no he's powerless against it God is instilling he's giving you that gift I I I'm just trying to say it in as many ways as I can to get it to you and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen but it's it's um it's it's you know Satan tries to destroy confidence in the word and he'll do that through many forms now I just read you a quote now remember this Christ is in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time that he's cast in the Lake of Fire now I want you to to put this in with the story of job job is is is in a trial and he's in the lowest point of his life spiritually emotionally physically and and here comes these friends and they're speaking things that's discrediting the word of God in job's life are you with me it's discrediting it it's it's it's causing destruction to job it's it's bringing him down it's it's it's fighting against job and his walk with the Lord are are you with me Satan fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army now I think so many times we get caught up on the Greater Works that we leave off the the Revelation that we leave off the the relationship with Jesus Christ if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before prise the Lord he will be as definitely thed today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain the power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we Prevail over them now if you think back to the scriptures that we read at the beginning it talked about the the gates and how God would he would break the gates he would hear them in their distress and and even in their sins he would hear their cry he would deliver them thank you Jesus the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you but you'll Prevail against them job's friends were sincere though they were sincerely wrong right God gets angry at them and I wonder if if God became so angry at them that is because job became so confused it was driving job into discouragement and hindering job's faith in God that's good now are you with me yeah the definition of deceive is a person causing another person to believe something that's not true typically in order to gain some personal Advantage it also means giving a mistaken impression so these these men are giving job a mistaken impression of God they're they're they're trying to get some personal advantage over him and I could just say it was like it was just a pride thing I know more than you job I I I've got more than you I've got more I've got you know if they talk like us I've got a closer relationship with the Lord than you and it and it was just it was in job's lowest time so it was just Heap on Heap on Heap and it was just just breaking job down in Proverbs 6 says these six things do the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood and heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to mischief and then the seventh uh sorry the sixth the false witness that speaks lies I mean you could just stick job's friends names right in this and then the seventh that is an is an Abomination unto God he that Seth Discord among the Brethren now when are are we okay I know I'm like jam packing like we could stop and pick it up again some other time um wow let me let me just go let's just go just a little a little bit further in Christ The Mystery of God revealed uh brother brandom speaks plainly to the church that Satan won't leave them as a loving group and I've and I've spoken this before I just this is this is one of my favorite uh quotes and because I just I I feel that strong urge when when brother Brenham says stay with your pastor he's ordained to lead you through I feel strong about that but Satan won't leave you a loving group he gives warning brother Bram gives warning to pray when you see a spirit rising up in the church to cause division so many people uh uh take a spirit of bitterness and hatred and speak evil and and and especially towards the pastor and it's just a spirit brother Bram warned that will that doing that had taking that spirit and and being that way having that in your heart and and even towards one another he says it'll drive the spirit from your life it'll drive the spirit from your church and it'll hurt your pastor I'm just going to reference these for time Matthew 7 Jesus speaking says beware of false prophets outwardly look like sheep but in their hearts they are wolves then he says you'll know them by the fruit they produce yeah once again Jesus says a man that hears his words and does them is is like a man who builds build his house on a rock which we just spoke about Revelation Matthew 10 and verse 16 Jesus says that he's he's sending them into the midst of these types of wolves and it and you he sends you into the midst of these wolves for the trying of your faith because you can watch and something will rise up and you say huh that that's that's a little strange that's a little off I don't know what it is but I can just I can just tell that's a little off don't you don't have to say anything about it just pray about it and and by their fruits you shall know them when it bears fruit then you'll know whether your discernment was right or not acts 2027 to 32 Paul telling the pastors To Be watchful over over yourself and the flock God has made them overseers over because he says Grievious wolves were will enter in and and not have any regard for the people but these men of the same faith will speak perverse things trying to draw away innocent lives to themselves this is all are you seeing how this is this is starting to come together with the scriptures we've been reading the quotes we've been reading and and I just I just pray it'll it'll just settle in your hearts because I I I'm going to have to skip some of this but I just I just want to make a strong point hopefully at the end Paul says watch and pray but rely on God's word and Grace that is able to build you and strengthen you and bring you into this inheritance that is preached to you thank you he says you're the purchase of God's blood and he doesn't take that lightly amen through the through the church ages God is speaking to his church and he's telling them that there's there's deceitful Spirit the spirit of the Antichrist is going to rise up in in your midst and he says and I hate the thing amen I hate God says I hate anything that would deceive you that would discourage you he says it's better that a millstone be hung about somebody's neck then you'd be offended that's how that's how much God this is this is the point I want to make that's how much God has his watchful care over you than Satan can go so far but God's watching him burning a hole right through his back he could he might be able to bring something and it and it disrupts the Church it disrupts the function it disrupts what we enjoy amongst each other the love that we feel it disrupts that but you just stay in watch it and you pray and God's watching it the whole time it can only go so far it can only be so comfortable before it either comes and be one of you or it leaves you right right that's that's the point I wanted to make God so now I feel like we can close in just a minute praise the Lord Proverbs 16:2 the ways of a man are clean in his own own eyes but the Lord weighs the spirit Jeremiah 17:10 the Lord searches the heart and the mind to give every man according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds help Jesus Revelations 2:23 says I am he that searches the mind and the heart and rewards accordingly and then we can have confidence because he says the spirit of deception the spirit of the Antichrist will be so close that had deceive the very elect but then he throws in that little thing there his watch his his ever loving care over you if it were possible that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that you take really what he's saying is it would deceive the very elect but it's impossible you can't be deceived God God is in his watchful cares watching he was watching over job the whole time and and and let's just let's just let me skip this I just want to go to the end here job 427 to9 after the Lord had said these things to job I mean job God let job have it he job stand up stand up be a man we're going to have a conversation you've done enough talking by the way it's my turn and God just you know just gives him a spanking yeah but after that after that I want you to catch this after the Lord had said these things to job he turns to job's friend now I didn't know I didn't think to look which one this was might have been the first one who said job I had a I had a vision for your life might have been him I don't know but he turn God turns to him and says I am angry with you and your two friends because you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has so now take take seven bulls and seven Rams go to my servant job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourself what's he saying go repent right go repent to job my servant job will then pray for you right right and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your Folly so in other words God was going to deal with these men but he says if you go have job pray for you I I have mercy you have not spoken this is the second time he says it you've not spoken the truth about me as my servant job has so eles the Tonite bildad the Shu shuhite and zofar the nthite did what the Lord told them and the Lord accepted job's prayer now notice this these men come they mean well they're sincere but God is furious with what they just did sowing Discord among Brethren deceiving somebody discouraging somebody God has zero tolerance for it prise God and he says repent and then have them pray for you yeah now we know that brother brandham said pray for that person that they'll either then they'll either go out or come among you okay so job let's see so so then God says go have job pray for you now I just want to get this you can you can stand to your feet cuz I'm going to have to be done let me just read this Matthew 5:44 to 46 ye have heard that it hath been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you now that takes some maturity yes it does that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for ye for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect does this mean it's going to be easy every time absolutely not tell you that absolutely not when job prayed for
