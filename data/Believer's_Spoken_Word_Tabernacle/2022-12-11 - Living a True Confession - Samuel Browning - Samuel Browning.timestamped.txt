[39:49] may you help us the Lord as we were just
[39:51] steal away Lord in these few moments
[39:54] Lord that you would speak to each of our
[39:56] hearts to every need that's gathered
[39:58] here this morning in a very personal way
[40:01] Lord we just desire to hide behind the
[40:04] cross Lord and that Lord in everything
[40:06] you would have the preeminence Lord may
[40:09] you just take control now Lord we pray
[40:12] we love you and we thank you now Lord in
[40:15] Jesus precious name Amen in Mark chapter
[40:18] 11 and verse 12.
[40:21] is where I'd like to begin reading there
[40:24] portion of the scripture
[40:27] it says and on the morrow
[40:29] when they were come from Bethany he was
[40:32] hungry
[40:33] and seeing a fig tree afar off having
[40:36] leaves he came it happily he might find
[40:40] anything thereon and when he came to it
[40:43] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[40:47] of figs was not yet
[40:51] Jesus answered and said unto it
[40:55] no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[40:57] forever and his disciples heard it I
[41:00] wonder you know they already thought
[41:02] Jesus
[41:03] was crazy
[41:06] right not the disciples but everybody
[41:08] else around
[41:10] right
[41:11] but the disciples are here
[41:13] and he speaks to it
[41:18] what's he speaking to he's speaking to
[41:21] the life
[41:22] that's in that tree
[41:25] no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter
[41:28] forever and his disciples heard it and
[41:32] in the morning as they pass by they saw
[41:35] the fig tree dried up from the roots I
[41:39] want you to think the word spoke to the
[41:43] life
[41:44] and the life itself had to give way
[41:47] because there was a greater Authority
[41:51] and it dried up from the roots
[41:54] right to the source of life because
[41:56] Roots is where the life is Peter calling
[41:58] to remember and saith unto him Master
[42:00] behold the Fig Tree which thou cursed is
[42:04] withered away
[42:06] Jesus answering said unto them have
[42:08] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[42:11] that whosoever shall say unto this
[42:14] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[42:17] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[42:20] his heart but shall believe that those
[42:22] things which he saith shall come to pass
[42:25] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[42:29] therefore I say unto you what things so
[42:32] ever ye desire When you pray believe
[42:36] that you receive them you shall have
[42:38] them and when you stand praying forgive
[42:42] if you have ought against any that your
[42:45] father also which is in heaven May
[42:47] forgive you
[42:49] your trespasses but if you do not
[42:52] forgive neither will your father which
[42:55] is in heaven
[42:56] forgive your trespasses
[43:00] how powerful
[43:02] how powerful amen let's just
[43:05] a man look to the Lord and as you're
[43:08] being seated
[43:13] just as some things that we were
[43:15] speaking just a few weeks ago and we've
[43:17] been dealing with thought
[43:20] of the power
[43:22] of the word of God
[43:24] and when you think about it brother
[43:27] Brown would refer to this many different
[43:29] times and I'll give you my title here in
[43:32] just a moment but brother Branham would
[43:34] would speak about that of even a lie
[43:38] detector test
[43:40] and we recognize that this if we can say
[43:43] it in this way brother Brown would speak
[43:46] to us and we know a human was not made
[43:48] to lie that's why a lie detector
[43:50] actually works and we know there's been
[43:53] things where you say well it didn't work
[43:54] in this situation and that but let's
[43:56] just bear with this thought just a
[43:58] moment Abram said lying is a deceitful
[44:01] hard evil thing I'd rather have a
[44:03] drunkard with me any day than a liar
[44:06] you see this is a great age of lying
[44:11] and lying itself the biggest lie there
[44:14] ever was told had 99 truth in it
[44:17] right so lying isn't just you know flat
[44:20] out a you know a flat out lie you know
[44:23] but it's but it is it's all considered
[44:25] it all comes under that and so we know
[44:28] that even as we see in the age that
[44:30] we're living in it's a it is the most
[44:33] deceitful age that's ever been that's
[44:36] upon the face of the Earth
[44:37] it's a challenging moment because of
[44:40] things that people uh would not want to
[44:43] receive as things being a lie whether
[44:46] it's politics religion whatever there's
[44:49] so many fronts all around us of such
[44:53] deception
[44:54] right but in the midst of this time of
[44:57] deception the truth himself I want you
[45:02] to catch that the truth himself because
[45:04] the truth is not a Doctrine
[45:08] the truth is the person of Jesus Christ
[45:12] he said I am the truth
[45:15] the life and the way
[45:19] brother Brown said your body was not
[45:21] made to lie no matter how sinful you are
[45:24] you're still a fallen Son of God and the
[45:27] most sinful person in this city today
[45:29] God didn't intend you to be sinful he
[45:32] wanted you to be a son or a daughter of
[45:35] his and you're made up in his own makeup
[45:37] but sin has caused you to do that and no
[45:41] matter how much you try to impersonate
[45:43] and try to make a lie seem right he said
[45:47] they've got an instrument that'll prove
[45:48] it's wrong you can tell it with all the
[45:51] Innocence you want to but it's still
[45:54] register negative because there's a
[45:56] subconscious down in the human human
[45:58] being and that subconscious knows the
[46:00] truth so no matter what we say out here
[46:03] the subconscience knows that it's a lie
[46:06] and that's why it will register off now
[46:08] notice where brother Branham is going
[46:10] here he says if a man or a woman could
[46:13] ever get their thoughts and their
[46:16] testimony and their lives so lined up
[46:20] with God
[46:21] there's a three important parts it's not
[46:24] just not speaking about these thoughts
[46:26] up here but the scripture says as a man
[46:29] thinketh in his heart
[46:32] so is he
[46:33] so it's thinking about those and getting
[46:36] those thoughts that from the heart lined
[46:40] up with their testimony what is actually
[46:42] being expressed and then the life going
[46:46] with it so the thought on the inside the
[46:49] testimony that's coming out and the life
[46:53] that's being lived that all of that
[46:55] could be lined up with God until the
[46:58] channel of the Holy Spirit would be
[47:00] perfectly one with god oh he said what
[47:03] would take place
[47:04] is that your desire
[47:06] amen that's our desire if the man and
[47:09] the woman could ever get lined up where
[47:13] with freedom from their hearts with
[47:16] Faith from their innermost
[47:20] now think of it because Faith itself is
[47:23] based on forgiveness
[47:26] that's why Jesus would say if you have
[47:29] ought
[47:30] when you're praying and you know you
[47:31] have ought there's something that you
[47:33] have ought you might have a right with
[47:35] that with someone else but you must
[47:38] forgive them
[47:41] right you have to forgive now don't get
[47:44] I don't want to get off and teach on
[47:45] this but forgiveness and Reconciliation
[47:47] are two different things forgiveness
[47:49] leads to reconciliation right so
[47:52] forgiveness isn't well you know I can't
[47:54] get together for coffee with them or you
[47:55] know I can't go over to their house that
[47:57] has nothing to do with forgiveness
[47:58] forgiveness is where you release it in
[48:00] your heart and you hold nothing against
[48:02] that person
[48:04] and you leave it in the hands of God for
[48:06] God to bring the reconciliation
[48:10] are you with me so forgiveness don't
[48:12] don't allow the enemy to put it over
[48:14] your head that well you know you're not
[48:15] really you're not reconciled so you're
[48:17] really not forgiven but forgiveness
[48:18] itself will lead to reconciliation the
[48:22] same work that God does within our lives
[48:25] as well
[48:28] many people brother Brown said they come
[48:30] to the altar to be prayed for and they
[48:32] have intellectual Faith they confess
[48:34] their sins and they join a church by
[48:36] intellectual Faith they believe it in
[48:38] their heart or in their mind rather he
[48:41] says they believe it and they believe it
[48:43] because they've heard it
[48:45] just I I'm just just dragging my feet
[48:47] here they believe it because they know
[48:50] it's the best policy
[48:52] let me just say this
[48:54] we don't believe a message simply
[48:56] because we know well it's the best one
[48:59] out there
[49:01] well you know it's the truest one out
[49:03] there that's not it
[49:05] that's still not reaching down to where
[49:08] God desires us to be because you can
[49:11] believe and say well I believe
[49:13] everything boy this is the truth while
[49:15] these doctrines are standing out well
[49:16] this is good but it that's not what God
[49:19] is looking for
[49:23] what's not looking for for that that
[49:25] it's the best policy
[49:27] he said that's not what God looks at he
[49:30] don't look at your intellectual Faith he
[49:32] looks on the heart on the inside and
[49:36] when it comes from the inside of your
[49:39] heart all things are possible then look
[49:42] what he says your confession in other
[49:45] words what you say it meets up with your
[49:47] life
[49:48] your life speaks so loud as your
[49:53] confession does
[49:54] but when your confession says says one
[49:57] thing and your life lives another
[50:00] something's wrong somewhere
[50:05] that's what I want to speak this morning
[50:07] on living a True Confession
[50:12] Hallelujah even after we spoke a few
[50:14] weeks ago just moving back home and this
[50:16] burdensome just dropping so heavily on
[50:19] my heart because they're not the
[50:21] confession what we say our life must
[50:25] project
[50:27] because we're not judged on what we say
[50:30] we're judged on what is expressed
[50:33] through our life
[50:34] because when we to stand there on that
[50:37] day we are where we give an account is
[50:40] God said you said you were a believer
[50:43] you said you believed this message
[50:46] but you never came and actually
[50:49] surrendered your life and became a
[50:52] partaker of it and your life spoke
[50:54] contrary of it because let me say this
[50:56] to you your children will not follow
[50:59] your confession your children will
[51:02] follow your life
[51:04] the Bible didn't say teach up a child it
[51:07] said train them
[51:09] so what you do shows them what you think
[51:12] of Jesus Christ
[51:15] everything now it's not just children
[51:17] whether they're small whether they're
[51:19] grown our neighbors Associates it's our
[51:22] life that is projected
[51:27] Sinners and publicans never came to
[51:30] Jesus in Luke 15 which he was highly
[51:33] ridiculed and accused about they did not
[51:35] come to him because Jesus was a
[51:38] feel-good society
[51:40] are you hearing me we're talking about
[51:42] people that that that their lives were
[51:45] in shambles and they knew it but there
[51:48] was a drawing power
[51:51] in the life of the Lord Jesus
[51:55] and they were drawn to that life
[52:01] Hallelujah let me just say this I don't
[52:04] believe we're drawn here to to assemble
[52:07] because of a feel good
[52:10] quite the contrary the word comes down
[52:12] and it cuts and deals with our life and
[52:16] you know what that is that's the love of
[52:17] God
[52:20] it's not the satanic way that Satan has
[52:23] wanted to make it out there that oh the
[52:25] love of God is just you know you just
[52:27] come as you are and God just accepts you
[52:30] the way you are that's a lie
[52:34] you can come but you can't stay the Way
[52:37] You Are
[52:38] why are what's drawing you because
[52:40] there's a life there's a choice you
[52:43] can't even explain it
[52:45] that's why Jesus said if I be lifted up
[52:48] I will draw all men unto me you're not
[52:51] drawn to a church
[52:53] a church cannot change you
[52:56] you can change your ideas for a while
[52:58] your thoughts for a while you're
[53:00] Doctrine for a while but that's not real
[53:02] change
[53:03] because all it takes is a matter of time
[53:05] and something to come along and change
[53:08] your thoughts
[53:10] gotta be something deeper than my
[53:12] thoughts it must be his thoughts coming
[53:15] to the inside
[53:19] is there something wrong somewhere he
[53:20] says that's because you have an
[53:22] intellectual faith
[53:24] and not a Faith from the heart
[53:27] you see it's more than talking the
[53:29] message
[53:30] it's more than knowing the lingo
[53:33] it's more than knowing cliches
[53:35] oh it's more than knowing scripture
[53:38] it's to know him
[53:42] you cannot know him and remain the same
[53:48] Jesus said
[53:50] through David if I can say it that way
[53:52] let the words of my mouth
[53:54] and the meditation of my heart be
[53:57] acceptable in thy sight oh God
[54:00] that's why brother Branham would tell us
[54:02] over and over and over and over he said
[54:04] your thoughts in heaven are louder than
[54:09] your words on Earth
[54:11] when it goes into the seventh seal he
[54:14] speaks to us and he says for those that
[54:17] are saying one thing and doing something
[54:19] different he said you better stop that
[54:23] why because it's the seriousness of the
[54:25] hour
[54:27] that it's not just because I say it
[54:31] you know we're living in that kind of a
[54:33] society well it's just because I say it
[54:35] or I ignore it all right this all right
[54:37] that that's that's even that's even
[54:38] wrong on the church world it's just not
[54:40] that it's got to be something that's
[54:42] deeper than that
[54:43] it's a life that's lived
[54:46] a heart that beats for almighty God
[54:49] amen because God is looking upon the
[54:51] heart not just the words we say I mean
[54:53] think about it when when a catastrophe
[54:56] has taken place I mean when 9 11 take
[54:58] place everybody became Christians
[55:01] oh suddenly everybody's born again
[55:04] right
[55:05] and then you realize
[55:07] you know which is not a surprise they're
[55:09] not born again
[55:10] because the whole pretense of them
[55:12] surrendering or supposed surrendering it
[55:15] was all out of a fear of oh man this
[55:18] this might be the end but it never was a
[55:20] surrender
[55:21] and that's why people doing go right
[55:23] back to the way they're going
[55:30] oh I wish I had words to express it
[55:34] so I asked the question is before I
[55:36] start continuing to minister here
[55:38] because the thought living a True
[55:39] Confession and so a question is I would
[55:41] continue to minister does your life the
[55:43] expression of it does it match your
[55:45] confession
[55:47] in other words is your life a poster
[55:49] child of the message
[55:53] come on somebody
[55:55] amen is it you say what do you mean I
[55:58] mean it's an example of what this
[55:59] message produces
[56:02] Oh Glory
[56:05] Mark 11 12.
[56:07] on the morrow let me reread this on
[56:09] tomorrow just a couple verses when they
[56:11] come from Bethany he was hungry Jesus
[56:13] was hungry he was Desiring substance and
[56:17] in verse 3 verse 13 he saw a fig tree
[56:20] afar off having leaves you know what I
[56:22] find incredible the very thing that was
[56:25] used
[56:26] to cover up sin in a religious cloak was
[56:29] fig leaves
[56:33] and he comes and he sees a fig tree
[56:37] because we're in religions are covering
[56:40] [Applause]
[56:42] right we could have our favorite quotes
[56:45] our favorite scriptures and it can cover
[56:48] over
[56:49] but there's got to be a greater covering
[56:51] that comes in your life to where it no
[56:53] matter what quote is read it no matter
[56:55] what scripture is read your life has
[56:57] come under the blood and you are in tune
[57:00] with Jesus Christ it doesn't matter the
[57:02] preaching can't get too hard it can't
[57:03] get too straight because you're in love
[57:06] with Jesus Christ and there is an amen
[57:09] on the inside to the word of God
[57:13] amen
[57:17] a fig tree he saw this fig tree having
[57:19] leaves and he came if he might find
[57:22] something there on now think of it he
[57:24] saw the leaves he's coming to find
[57:26] something on it and when he came he
[57:29] found nothing but leaves
[57:31] for the time of figs was not yet now
[57:34] this is known it'd just be like right
[57:35] now you know you don't expect to go out
[57:37] there and pick apples off the apple tree
[57:40] right
[57:42] you don't expect that you know it's not
[57:43] the time for apples
[57:46] and Jesus knowing even knowing that
[57:49] knowing it it's not the time for figs
[57:51] but he sees the leaves that are on the
[57:53] tree they're not withered up leaves they
[57:56] are leaves that are expressing fruit
[57:59] should be present
[58:02] are you hearing me now there are leaves
[58:05] that are expressing there should be
[58:07] fruit present in other words let me
[58:09] bring it on down that if we say that
[58:11] we're a Believer there should be fruit
[58:13] that is present
[58:19] yes
[58:20] and the message hidden life brother
[58:22] Brown takes this one of the few places
[58:25] through the message of how God would
[58:27] lead the prophet in and bringing this
[58:29] this part out for you and I that takes
[58:32] place in Mark 11 he said Jesus came to
[58:35] the tree to look for fruit on it and it
[58:38] had everything but fruit
[58:41] and he said that's what's the matter
[58:42] with our churches today we got
[58:45] everything but fruit
[58:47] we can shout we can speak in tongues we
[58:50] can argue the scriptures we can teach
[58:52] our theology but when it comes to fruit
[58:54] bearing the tree is very lean
[58:59] so what's what's it coming against it's
[59:01] because the leaves themselves even
[59:03] though it's not the time of figs but the
[59:05] leaves are bearing false witness
[59:09] because when he comes there's no fruit
[59:11] that's there
[59:13] Jesus is moved Jesus does not moved by
[59:16] the leaves
[59:18] it's by the fruit
[59:20] even faith in the new heaven the new
[59:22] Earth it's the kings that come to take
[59:25] leaves off the tree for the healing of
[59:27] the nation
[59:28] leaves speak of Fellowship right and so
[59:32] there must be of that testimony when we
[59:35] we can be in fellowship with brothers
[59:37] and sisters and that is wonderful
[59:38] Fellowship in a church even coming and
[59:41] accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as our
[59:43] Lord and savior and being baptized in
[59:46] the name of Jesus Christ we now are in
[59:48] fellowship with the Believers but there
[59:50] it has to be a deeper fellowship and
[59:52] that is a fellowship under the blood of
[59:56] Jesus Christ
[59:59] to where our lives bear his fruit
[1:00:03] his life
[1:00:05] and that fruit is love
[1:00:08] the love of God rooted in our lives
[1:00:11] and the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:00:15] in other words circumstances of Life do
[1:00:19] not dictate
[1:00:20] your walk with God
[1:00:23] oh brother Samuel if I hadn't had this
[1:00:25] heard trial look at it like this God in
[1:00:28] His Grace has let you know what you said
[1:00:31] oh if this hadn't happened I wouldn't
[1:00:33] have wound back out in the world what
[1:00:34] God is letting you know is there is
[1:00:37] something stronger than intellectual
[1:00:39] faith
[1:00:40] there is a strength that you can be
[1:00:43] founded on the Rock to where when the
[1:00:45] winds come when the storms come when it
[1:00:48] blows and rains and hails and snows
[1:00:50] there is an acre
[1:00:53] that will hold you
[1:00:54] [Applause]
[1:00:57] your anchor is not another man your
[1:00:59] anchor is not another woman
[1:01:01] if you're anchors your husband what
[1:01:03] happens when he fails there goes your
[1:01:05] anchor and where your anchor goes you
[1:01:07] will go also
[1:01:11] receive it as the grace of God to let
[1:01:14] you and I know hey I need to go deeper
[1:01:18] yeah man I don't think anybody wants to
[1:01:20] set spiraling in confusion
[1:01:23] I don't like I don't like to be confused
[1:01:24] I don't know about you I don't
[1:01:26] I don't like to be confused about things
[1:01:27] I like to be clear
[1:01:29] I think everybody else does too right
[1:01:32] I mean I'm the kind of guy if I got to
[1:01:33] do a plumbing project around America
[1:01:34] call somebody else I mean well you know
[1:01:36] or or doing something you know you want
[1:01:38] to make sure of it right some things you
[1:01:40] know you do there's not so many things
[1:01:42] the second second chance
[1:01:45] right right hooking things up in your
[1:01:47] house you better be sure right I want to
[1:01:49] be sure
[1:01:50] and this is a time to really be sure
[1:01:54] this is a time to really be sure it's a
[1:01:57] time of great preparation so to think of
[1:01:59] how that God would deal with that life
[1:02:02] and that in that in that that was in
[1:02:04] that tree
[1:02:05] because when you consider that even when
[1:02:09] Aaron's raw think about Aaron's Rod it
[1:02:11] was dead
[1:02:14] dead
[1:02:15] as long as it was out here it was dead
[1:02:19] it did not matter how predestinated it
[1:02:22] was it was dead
[1:02:25] and when it came into the first Veil
[1:02:28] it still was dead
[1:02:30] but it had to come in that way
[1:02:32] right just like you have to come to God
[1:02:34] right there's no other door there's no
[1:02:37] other name
[1:02:38] right you have to come through
[1:02:40] repentance then you enter into the
[1:02:43] second Veil it was still dead where the
[1:02:44] candle where the candle sticks but you
[1:02:46] see what the candlesticks are doing they
[1:02:48] are reflecting The Shining Light upon
[1:02:52] that of the labor and it points you and
[1:02:55] it's directing you into the holy place
[1:02:59] that's where real Victory is
[1:03:02] are you with me because now once that
[1:03:05] Rod came into the holiest of holies
[1:03:07] Aaron's rod
[1:03:10] it budded
[1:03:12] it blossomed and it bore almonds
[1:03:15] you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:03:17] impossible to be in the holiest of
[1:03:20] holies to be in Christ to be a believer
[1:03:24] that is filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:03:26] not bearing fruit it's impossible
[1:03:30] but the same thing then what are you
[1:03:31] saying I'm saying what Veil are you in
[1:03:33] them
[1:03:35] what Veil are you in
[1:03:37] you might have come through the first
[1:03:39] Veil Glory I'll Rejoice with you but
[1:03:42] keep going
[1:03:43] you might have come to the second Veil
[1:03:45] we're sanctification the word sets your
[1:03:48] mind on holiness
[1:03:50] but keep going
[1:03:52] keep going don't get content
[1:03:55] move to where there is Union
[1:04:00] kitchen is fellowship
[1:04:02] living we eat living room is fellowship
[1:04:06] the bedroom is where New Life comes
[1:04:09] that's the whole list of holy
[1:04:14] God's desire is to see his own life
[1:04:17] Fruit reproduced in our lives look at
[1:04:19] look at John 15.
[1:04:22] Jesus said abide in me and I in you as
[1:04:24] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:04:26] except it abide in the vine no more can
[1:04:30] ye
[1:04:31] except she abide in me amen I am divine
[1:04:36] you are the branches
[1:04:39] and he that abideth in me and I in him
[1:04:41] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:04:45] without me you can do nothing through
[1:04:51] verse 7 if ye abide in me
[1:04:54] and my words abide in you now what are
[1:04:57] his words his thoughts
[1:05:00] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:05:03] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:05:07] see this is the power of the word if
[1:05:09] that is that that is really if we are
[1:05:11] captured with that and it moves in our
[1:05:14] life then you recognize you are a son or
[1:05:17] daughter of God in Authority in your
[1:05:20] life in your walk with God when things
[1:05:22] arise in your home things arise on the
[1:05:25] job things arise in the church there is
[1:05:27] an authority if ye abide in me and my
[1:05:31] words abide in you you shall ask what
[1:05:34] you will
[1:05:34] [Applause]
[1:05:36] in other words you become a spokesman of
[1:05:40] the word
[1:05:42] and it's not you it's not your thoughts
[1:05:46] it's God's thoughts because it's God's
[1:05:50] thoughts that come to materialization
[1:05:54] and that's God's desire for his children
[1:05:57] that's what
[1:05:59] the Lord Jesus Through the Redemptive
[1:06:02] work is to bring you and I back into
[1:06:04] that place that's why in this hour
[1:06:07] we're not looking for something to come
[1:06:09] now is the time of the manifestation of
[1:06:14] the sons of God
[1:06:15] not just a Son of God that was
[1:06:18] manifested in the ministry of Malachi 4
[1:06:21] God showed that of the Son of God come
[1:06:24] into full adoption right
[1:06:27] and it wasn't just on a mountain he
[1:06:28] spoke to the wind
[1:06:30] I'm gonna preach now I got criticized
[1:06:32] for this
[1:06:34] it wasn't just on the mountain it wasn't
[1:06:36] just demonstrated right there before
[1:06:38] hundreds of people that same life was
[1:06:41] reproduced in his home
[1:06:43] yeah
[1:06:44] yeah true are you with me that's why it
[1:06:46] ain't good enough just to have well
[1:06:48] Miracles and this is before everybody
[1:06:50] else it's how are you at home
[1:06:53] because how you are at home and when
[1:06:55] nobody else is watching is how you
[1:06:57] really are
[1:07:01] whoo
[1:07:03] think the pastor got back in town
[1:07:07] notice
[1:07:10] here is my father glorified
[1:07:13] right
[1:07:15] how that you bear much fruit not that
[1:07:17] you have a lot of leaves
[1:07:20] not that they're we believe in shouting
[1:07:22] don't we I believe in that
[1:07:24] I believe in Shelton I'm believing
[1:07:26] running I believe in I believe in being
[1:07:27] expressed I believe in turning loose
[1:07:30] yeah I believe in that
[1:07:32] I believe that the word itself will
[1:07:35] produce that
[1:07:36] now
[1:07:37] there may be some that don't there might
[1:07:39] be some as I told you before I preached
[1:07:41] the places that maybe they don't run
[1:07:43] maybe they don't jump up and shout
[1:07:45] that's okay but as long as the anointing
[1:07:48] of the word is there right but you see
[1:07:50] the danger is sometimes where people get
[1:07:52] in they get to leaning towards their
[1:07:54] favorite way that they feel is more
[1:07:57] spiritual
[1:07:58] and they'll pull it this way or they'll
[1:08:01] pull it that way there's a middle of the
[1:08:02] road
[1:08:04] what are you saying by the same now I'm
[1:08:06] saying that you know what let us just
[1:08:08] keep our eyes on Jesus
[1:08:10] and you know what if you're one that
[1:08:12] cries will you cry if you're one that
[1:08:15] shouts you'll Shout
[1:08:17] so many times I wonder you know we can
[1:08:20] read quotes in the message but I wonder
[1:08:22] if we're coming to the house of God are
[1:08:25] we coming here to monitor somebody
[1:08:27] else's shout or lack of shout
[1:08:30] we're here for the wrong purpose we are
[1:08:33] not here well let me see if so and so is
[1:08:35] growing you're not here for that you are
[1:08:37] not their measuring stick God didn't
[1:08:39] give you that God the word is coming
[1:08:42] forth to measure up
[1:08:45] pneumonia you might be looking at the
[1:08:47] wrong thing and it'll take you right
[1:08:49] away
[1:08:52] you keep your eyes on Jesus look hey
[1:08:55] unto Jesus the author and the finish of
[1:08:57] the faith because what you might be
[1:08:59] looking at may not even be a left seed
[1:09:01] and you're expecting elect results
[1:09:03] oh amen
[1:09:05] brother Samuel how do I know serve God
[1:09:08] that's how we know serve God that's how
[1:09:11] I've Got Confidence in this word this
[1:09:13] message will produce itself in the lives
[1:09:16] of its people
[1:09:19] are you with me that's why we don't pull
[1:09:21] struggle push
[1:09:24] I was thinking how it said this isn't
[1:09:26] the message of the three pushers it's
[1:09:27] the three pulls
[1:09:33] Romans 7 verse 1.
[1:09:36] I don't have that scripture there but
[1:09:38] let's look here
[1:09:40] Romans 7 verse 1 I'd like to read seven
[1:09:42] verse chapter seven one through six
[1:09:46] no you're not brethren
[1:09:48] for I speak to them that know the law
[1:09:52] how did the law hath dominion over a man
[1:09:55] as long as he liveth
[1:09:57] for the woman which hath and husband is
[1:09:59] bound by the law to her husband so long
[1:10:02] as he liveth
[1:10:04] but if the husband be dead
[1:10:06] she's loosed from the law of her husband
[1:10:11] so then if while her husband liveth
[1:10:15] she'd be married to another man she
[1:10:18] shall be called an adulteress
[1:10:20] but if her husband be dead she is free
[1:10:24] from that law so that she's no
[1:10:26] adulteress though she be married to
[1:10:29] another man so the only thing that would
[1:10:31] relieve that of the woman from adultery
[1:10:34] is her living husband is dead
[1:10:38] are you with me now
[1:10:41] verse six now let me go verse 4 verse
[1:10:43] four wherefore my brethren ye also are
[1:10:46] become dead now notice Paul bringing
[1:10:49] this application into the spiritual
[1:10:51] Realm wherefore my brethren ye also are
[1:10:55] become dead to the law by the body of
[1:10:57] Christ that you should be married to
[1:11:00] another even to him
[1:11:03] who is raised from the dead that we
[1:11:06] should bring forth fruit unto God
[1:11:10] what an hour that we're living in
[1:11:12] this scripture that was the admonition
[1:11:15] of the Believers down through the ages
[1:11:18] to be United with the word that God was
[1:11:22] sending in that hour in the day of
[1:11:24] Pentecost they were United with him who
[1:11:27] was the word
[1:11:28] right they were wooed to that place to
[1:11:31] be United with him this admonition has
[1:11:34] been down Through the Ages but it was
[1:11:36] written in Prophecy for this hour
[1:11:40] because in this hour
[1:11:42] you see back in the day of Pentecost was
[1:11:45] not the Fulfillment of Revelations 19.
[1:11:48] are you hearing me now it was not the
[1:11:51] marriage of the lamb now Revelations 19
[1:11:54] it was the prophecy the marriage of the
[1:11:57] Lamb is come and his wife hath made her
[1:12:02] self ready
[1:12:04] she had been adorned in the fine linen
[1:12:07] which is the righteousness of the Saints
[1:12:11] so it's a prophecy of this hour
[1:12:14] verse 5 for when we were in the flesh
[1:12:18] the Motions of sin which were by the law
[1:12:20] did work in our members to bring forth
[1:12:22] fruit unto death
[1:12:25] but now he says we are delivered
[1:12:28] from the law
[1:12:30] that being dead wherein we were held so
[1:12:33] we were held remember we were dead in
[1:12:36] sin and trespasses
[1:12:37] we were in bondage by our first husband
[1:12:41] by First Union which you didn't have a
[1:12:44] choice of that it was a shotgun wedding
[1:12:45] when you came here
[1:12:48] somebody maybe don't know about that
[1:12:52] somebody may feel like you're getting a
[1:12:53] shotgun wedding but anyhow that's beside
[1:12:55] the point
[1:12:57] you didn't have a choice when you came
[1:12:58] here of did you want to be married to
[1:13:00] that first Adam that first nature
[1:13:03] a man born of a woman
[1:13:06] is a few days old and full of trouble
[1:13:09] said under inspiration who can bring a
[1:13:12] clean thing out of an unclean
[1:13:15] you see God don't clean up
[1:13:18] that first nature
[1:13:20] God don't say the problem is I got to
[1:13:22] clean this guy up no because he still
[1:13:25] natured that way no matter how much you
[1:13:27] clean him up his nature is the same
[1:13:38] we were dead in that
[1:13:40] but now that we should serve in newness
[1:13:42] of spirit and not in the wholeness of
[1:13:44] the letter now notice right brother
[1:13:46] random places that's here in invisible
[1:13:48] Union of the bride of Christ
[1:13:50] he says it was nature as we were
[1:13:53] associated with death
[1:13:54] your first husband
[1:13:56] had the rule over you that first Adam
[1:13:59] that first nature it had to rule over
[1:14:01] you
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:03] it was by now listen to this it was your
[1:14:06] Nature by natural birth natural
[1:14:10] you love the world because you are the
[1:14:12] world and part of the world
[1:14:15] your desires was by nature to love the
[1:14:19] world which you're part of you're a part
[1:14:21] of Nature and that's your natural thing
[1:14:24] that's the reason you have to be born
[1:14:27] again
[1:14:27] look at the Simplicity you have to
[1:14:30] separate
[1:14:33] you have to die to that first husband
[1:14:36] can't just divorce him because he's
[1:14:38] still a living husband
[1:14:40] right can just divorce him he'll come
[1:14:43] back
[1:14:44] because you're still under his Rule and
[1:14:46] if you are still married to him he's
[1:14:49] alive and professing to be married to
[1:14:51] Jesus Christ you're an adulteress
[1:14:54] it's not true
[1:14:58] you have to separate
[1:15:00] you have to die to that first husband
[1:15:03] you can't live with it you just can't
[1:15:05] say well I'll divorce him and hang him
[1:15:07] up here till the occasion no sir no
[1:15:10] writing of divorcement in other words I
[1:15:12] ain't going to have nothing more to do
[1:15:13] with you I ain't gonna do this and I'm
[1:15:15] going to stop this and I'm going to quit
[1:15:16] it's got to go deeper than the writing
[1:15:18] of divorcement
[1:15:21] because he's still alive
[1:15:24] he dies the nature of the world has to
[1:15:28] die every Speck of him has to die
[1:15:31] God will never and he does not Unite
[1:15:35] with that first nature
[1:15:38] that first nature is that first husband
[1:15:40] and God will not Unite with us with that
[1:15:45] first husband still alive
[1:15:51] that first nature
[1:15:54] every Speck of him has to die that's why
[1:15:57] brother Brahm said not even a toe
[1:16:00] can be out from underneath the blood
[1:16:04] but Simon what are you saying I'm saying
[1:16:06] don't make excuses for your toe being
[1:16:08] out
[1:16:09] get it under the blood
[1:16:11] oh brother Samuel that's hard let me
[1:16:12] tell you what'll be hard when you show
[1:16:14] up here one of these mornings and
[1:16:15] nobody's here
[1:16:18] that's what'll be hard and you'll think
[1:16:20] oh brother Samuel that's hard no it's
[1:16:22] God's grace coming to you and I because
[1:16:24] God's desire is to get us ready
[1:16:28] he wants to project his life to you
[1:16:33] well brother Samuel you know I read and
[1:16:34] I pray those are all wonderful things
[1:16:36] but that's no substitute for the Holy
[1:16:40] Ghost
[1:16:42] except you abide in me and my word abide
[1:16:45] in you let me tell you something there's
[1:16:47] Baptists that can snow you under
[1:16:49] there's Pentecostals that can outdo you
[1:16:51] with praying and devotional and
[1:16:53] everything else they can snow you under
[1:16:55] they love God according to all that has
[1:16:58] been known to them they love him in that
[1:17:01] way but this is a greater hour the
[1:17:03] message itself is calling for a deeper
[1:17:06] relationship and if there's a deep
[1:17:08] pulling in your heart there's a deeper
[1:17:10] walk with God
[1:17:12] for every one of us
[1:17:16] every Speck of him has to die you have
[1:17:19] to be reunited again with another nature
[1:17:23] he said when were you you were separated
[1:17:27] from that Union by a spiritual death
[1:17:29] your desire now watch this your natural
[1:17:31] desire is to cut your hair
[1:17:34] so if you still like to cut your hair
[1:17:36] that speaks of a desire of worldliness
[1:17:39] Steel in the heart
[1:17:43] aren't you glad for an MRI if you're
[1:17:44] having pain somewhere you're having
[1:17:46] discomfort somewhere you want to know
[1:17:49] right yeah right you want to know you
[1:17:51] just don't want to walk around pop and
[1:17:52] leave an Advil
[1:17:54] you know what because they ain't taking
[1:17:55] care of it
[1:17:56] so you need to have an MRI and figure
[1:17:58] out what in the world's going on
[1:18:00] right so we can get down to the symptoms
[1:18:02] or get down to the root instead of
[1:18:04] stressing the symptoms
[1:18:06] right I believe that's why it's more
[1:18:08] than just many times and over the same I
[1:18:10] need a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:11] sometimes I don't think it's a refilling
[1:18:13] that we need I think it's a genuine
[1:18:14] feeling that we really need
[1:18:16] I think we really need to meet God first
[1:18:18] you understand what I'm saying many
[1:18:20] times I've prayed with many young people
[1:18:21] oh brother Samuel this has come back
[1:18:23] around in my life and this has come back
[1:18:24] around and you realize where they're
[1:18:25] looking at well I just need a real
[1:18:27] refilling of the Holy Ghost no that
[1:18:29] still has you bound you're still in
[1:18:30] bondage with that thing now God doesn't
[1:18:32] leave one Speck of your life in bondage
[1:18:35] he sets you free oh brother Samuel
[1:18:37] that's harsh it might upset their faith
[1:18:39] let me tell you something if your faith
[1:18:41] is in position in the word of God it's
[1:18:44] not correct and it will never produce a
[1:18:48] Victorious Life
[1:18:50] truth Might Sting but it'll set you free
[1:18:54] your natural desire is to cut your hair
[1:18:58] your natural desire is to wear shorts
[1:19:00] paint your face your natural desire is
[1:19:03] to be intellectual
[1:19:05] smart man
[1:19:07] know something better than the other oh
[1:19:09] wow
[1:19:10] so that's that's sin as well too
[1:19:12] may not smoke may not drink
[1:19:15] maybe all that I'm a good clean guy but
[1:19:19] having a natural desire to assert
[1:19:21] yourself Above the Rest of the brethren
[1:19:24] oh they need to come to me for my
[1:19:27] understanding on these things that's a
[1:19:29] natural desire
[1:19:35] sin
[1:19:38] notice in souls are in prison now what a
[1:19:41] message if you haven't listened to souls
[1:19:42] in prison in a while go listen a message
[1:19:44] brother Brandon clearly it's continuing
[1:19:46] laying this out of that first birth and
[1:19:48] he goes he says he never let his body
[1:19:50] see corruption neither did he leave his
[1:19:52] soul in hell but he raised him up on the
[1:19:53] third day and he's Alive forevermore and
[1:19:56] we will have a body like his own
[1:19:58] glorious body that's why we're baptized
[1:20:02] in his name that we might come forth in
[1:20:06] his name in his death in his
[1:20:08] resurrection that Rise Again testifying
[1:20:10] to the world that we have new life that
[1:20:13] the old man is dead
[1:20:16] so why are we baptized because God has
[1:20:19] dealt with our heart
[1:20:20] the Bible said repent
[1:20:23] and repentance isn't feeling sorry for
[1:20:25] where you're at
[1:20:26] Oh Me Oh My My life is like this one
[1:20:29] that ain't repentance that's worldly
[1:20:31] sorrow
[1:20:32] God won't come to that it's God
[1:20:35] repentance is where you realize I need
[1:20:38] God
[1:20:40] I need God
[1:20:42] and repentance is a change of mind where
[1:20:45] you're no longer heading that way but
[1:20:47] I'm heading this way it's with a balance
[1:20:50] towards sin not making excuses for it my
[1:20:53] daddy was like this my mama was like
[1:20:55] this if so and so hadn't done this if
[1:20:57] this hadn't happened it's not making
[1:20:58] excuses for it
[1:21:01] it's turning from it and when we're
[1:21:03] baptized
[1:21:07] this is why when I baptize somebody I
[1:21:09] want to know where you're standing
[1:21:11] the same you shouldn't Turn Me by I'm
[1:21:12] not saying I'll turn anybody away but I
[1:21:14] want you to understand this ain't just
[1:21:15] Roman Catholicism
[1:21:18] were you walking in because you made a
[1:21:19] boo-boo in life and all of a sudden now
[1:21:21] I'm going to walk back in here and I
[1:21:23] feel good that ain't what it's about
[1:21:25] now I can't straighten that out of
[1:21:27] anybody's life but the reality of this
[1:21:29] is right here that we are being we are
[1:21:31] taking upon his name you are declaring
[1:21:34] when you walk into the water of baptism
[1:21:36] that I am identified with My Sacrifice I
[1:21:40] am testified to this whole congregation
[1:21:42] and to the rest of the world that I am a
[1:21:45] new creation
[1:21:48] I no longer want anything to do with the
[1:21:51] world
[1:21:52] that's what it really means and God
[1:21:55] comes and Honors that faith
[1:21:58] the Bible says we buried that first
[1:22:00] nature that first nature is gone and now
[1:22:04] we're the nature of him he lives in US
[1:22:06] and we don't do our own will
[1:22:10] we do his will
[1:22:12] we don't think our own thoughts
[1:22:14] the mind
[1:22:15] is what thinks
[1:22:17] you see that's why it takes something
[1:22:19] greater
[1:22:20] than even your upbringing
[1:22:25] it takes something greater than you're
[1:22:26] raisin
[1:22:28] there's got to come a power on the
[1:22:29] inside that brings a change
[1:22:32] there's got to come a power that is able
[1:22:34] to move in your life to give you victory
[1:22:36] over you
[1:22:38] come on now for your own will well you
[1:22:41] know this is just how I am well if
[1:22:42] you've got the spirit of Christ in you
[1:22:44] you've got greater is he that is in you
[1:22:46] than he that's in the world and that
[1:22:48] first worldly birth you don't want to
[1:22:49] make excuses for it your temperament you
[1:22:51] don't want to make excuses for it you
[1:22:53] want to let the Holy Ghost reign in your
[1:22:55] life
[1:22:57] come on now
[1:22:58] the sins I used to do I do them no more
[1:23:04] glory be to God
[1:23:06] the mind that was in Christ Jesus then
[1:23:08] is what's in that's in what's when every
[1:23:10] believer that's the soul and that's what
[1:23:12] we're speaking of in the message of
[1:23:14] token brother said you must be born
[1:23:16] again he said now look he said when
[1:23:18] Jesus said you must be born again how
[1:23:20] many knows that term has it's thrown
[1:23:22] away I mean it's thrown around like
[1:23:25] like water in a restaurant
[1:23:27] right it just throw it around we want
[1:23:30] water okay Water free
[1:23:32] it just throw it around and they've so
[1:23:34] cheapened what a real birth is
[1:23:38] right we just had to we just had another
[1:23:40] birth of God Terry's here it'll be
[1:23:42] another one coming here and in so many
[1:23:44] weeks or months I don't know exactly
[1:23:45] where that's at but you know you think
[1:23:47] of these things when a birth comes it's
[1:23:49] a new life
[1:23:51] it's a new life that has come forth is
[1:23:54] that right
[1:23:55] so with that we recognize that brother
[1:23:59] Ram says that it don't mean to jump up
[1:24:01] and down at the altar that don't mean to
[1:24:03] walk back there and shake hands with the
[1:24:05] pastor that don't mean all this
[1:24:06] foolishness that we've seen done it
[1:24:09] don't mean putting your name on a book
[1:24:10] it means Death to Your First being and
[1:24:14] life to the second being let me just say
[1:24:17] this if the characteristics that's on
[1:24:19] display in your life is still your
[1:24:22] surname you need a change
[1:24:26] come on now oh but my mom and daddy did
[1:24:29] this but your mom and daddy may not win
[1:24:30] all the way
[1:24:33] come on now Mom and Dad is not the
[1:24:36] measuring stick you in Christ it's you
[1:24:39] and Christ
[1:24:41] come on now the Holy Spirit produces a
[1:24:44] rugged life for Jesus Christ
[1:24:47] oh brother Samuel I don't believe you
[1:24:48] ought to be stressed out really
[1:24:50] I I find it I find I marble at the
[1:24:53] things that we will expend ourselves for
[1:24:55] and go to lengths to do and when it
[1:24:58] comes to Simply coming to the house of
[1:25:00] God
[1:25:01] oh we're just we'll just
[1:25:04] I've got this backache or I've got this
[1:25:07] legging now listen I'm not making light
[1:25:08] of anything
[1:25:10] the way it gets quiet in here
[1:25:12] it gets quiet that's all right lets me
[1:25:15] know drop it down into gear and preach
[1:25:17] it but to you you examine the words
[1:25:20] coming right now examine your life do
[1:25:22] you press yourself for others hangs and
[1:25:25] then when it comes to coming to the
[1:25:26] house of God oh brother Samuel I just
[1:25:28] catch it on the internet oh really show
[1:25:31] me in the scripture where it says for if
[1:25:32] you forsake not to stream together
[1:25:35] you understand what covet's done it's
[1:25:38] caused a lot of laxness it's brought
[1:25:40] along a virus a spiritual virus in the
[1:25:44] Church of the Living God
[1:25:47] pastors back in town it's brought about
[1:25:49] oh bless God I wouldn't get that vaccine
[1:25:52] bless God this and this and this and
[1:25:54] this but you better make sure you get
[1:25:56] this vaccine
[1:25:57] you better make sure you get this one
[1:26:00] this one was not man-made this one has
[1:26:03] come from on high
[1:26:05] this one stood in the face of time
[1:26:08] oh brother Samuel I can receive and be
[1:26:10] just a good a Christian at home that's a
[1:26:12] lie
[1:26:13] the prophet of God told us that you
[1:26:16] cannot be just a good a Christian
[1:26:17] outside of church as you can be inside a
[1:26:20] church but look what's happened we've
[1:26:22] become message surfing Christians
[1:26:26] oh no we wouldn't have cable we won't
[1:26:28] surf that but we'll surf the Internet
[1:26:30] for preachers
[1:26:34] who are we dealing with our first nature
[1:26:40] oh
[1:26:41] oh
[1:26:45] it means this is what it means it means
[1:26:48] Death to Your First being and life to
[1:26:51] the second being
[1:26:53] it means that the blood has been applied
[1:26:56] and you're identified by the life of
[1:26:58] Jesus Christ because if the Vine
[1:27:01] puts forth another Branch now notice the
[1:27:04] vine puts forth another branch
[1:27:06] a life that has already been identified
[1:27:11] alive and Christ comes down through that
[1:27:14] life what he has reserved for himself
[1:27:17] that life then by the quickening power
[1:27:19] to project his life through that Branch
[1:27:22] it's his branch
[1:27:24] it's no longer the branch of the world
[1:27:27] it's no longer the branch it's God
[1:27:29] producing his own life through his own
[1:27:32] branch
[1:27:36] James 1 21.
[1:27:38] I'm coming down here
[1:27:42] wherefore
[1:27:44] lay apart all filthiness
[1:27:47] and superfluity of naughtiness
[1:27:52] now this is God's admonition to his
[1:27:55] children
[1:27:57] to lay this aside
[1:27:59] get rid of all uncleanliness and the
[1:28:02] rampant this is what the Amplified says
[1:28:04] ran the rampant outgrowth of wickedness
[1:28:07] so it's separating it's dying I love
[1:28:09] this this scripture and receive the meek
[1:28:12] with meekness the engrafted word
[1:28:16] which is able to save your souls
[1:28:23] brother Brown takes this in the message
[1:28:24] and if you haven't listened the message
[1:28:26] word made flesh India trip preaching 54.
[1:28:29] it's just an absolute masterpiece
[1:28:33] LeBron is talking about when a man is
[1:28:35] converted and here is
[1:28:37] he begins to talk about a brother who
[1:28:39] has come to him
[1:28:41] and the brother has expressed to brother
[1:28:43] Branham
[1:28:44] that he is
[1:28:47] I've been trying to get saved for years
[1:28:49] and I want you to hear what he says he
[1:28:51] says I've been trying to get saved for
[1:28:53] years I've been trying to get the spirit
[1:28:57] and I can't
[1:28:59] but brim says you're trying to get saved
[1:29:02] he said yeah I said I'm trying to get
[1:29:03] saved he said brother Brown I believe I
[1:29:05] crossed the line where you can't get
[1:29:06] saved everybody I'm saying well I don't
[1:29:08] know about that
[1:29:09] then a man begins to proceed of how he's
[1:29:12] went to Billy Graham's meetings and they
[1:29:13] told him you know raise your hand
[1:29:15] and accept the Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:29:18] confess that you're saved and they told
[1:29:20] him you're saved he said but nothing
[1:29:22] happened to me now I want you to keep
[1:29:23] these in mind nothing happened to me
[1:29:26] he said I went to the Free Methodist
[1:29:28] people
[1:29:29] and I had said I had to get happy enough
[1:29:31] to shout
[1:29:32] he said I I shouted
[1:29:34] but I still didn't have it
[1:29:37] I went to Brother Robert's meetings and
[1:29:40] he said they told me I had to speak with
[1:29:41] tongues or I didn't have it
[1:29:44] so he said I spoke with tongues but
[1:29:47] brother Branham I still ain't got it
[1:29:50] and he said now what they did Brother
[1:29:52] Brown they told me down in Shreveport at
[1:29:53] the voice the voice of healing they told
[1:29:55] me you were a prophet and they told me I
[1:29:57] need to come here because you'd be able
[1:29:58] to reveal to me when the spirit come on
[1:30:01] you what is my trouble
[1:30:04] now how many know that that's what the
[1:30:06] ministry of Malachi for this word even
[1:30:08] here this morning
[1:30:10] brother Brian says what I catch in my
[1:30:12] meetings is what has fallen off from
[1:30:14] Oral Roberts and from the rest of them
[1:30:16] why they couldn't get their healings
[1:30:18] why they couldn't get Deliverance
[1:30:20] because there was things sealed down in
[1:30:22] their life
[1:30:23] that needed to be cleared out
[1:30:26] the Holy Spirit won't come on top it
[1:30:28] it's got to be cleared out and God would
[1:30:31] come God's mercy in this generation to
[1:30:34] open and to reveal those things now
[1:30:35] here's this man is he has been told to
[1:30:37] come to brother Branham because brother
[1:30:39] Brown will be able to tell you and help
[1:30:40] you to determine what your trouble is
[1:30:43] and here's what brother Brown said
[1:30:44] brother Brown told him he said brother
[1:30:45] you don't need a prophet to do that
[1:30:49] the word of God settles it
[1:30:51] he said you don't need prophecy
[1:30:53] he said my brother the only thing of it
[1:30:55] is you're just confused
[1:30:57] we could preach on misunderstandings and
[1:30:59] confusion right here
[1:31:03] you'll see as I read on right here
[1:31:04] probably most of you read this before
[1:31:06] already you'll find how powerful
[1:31:08] confusion can be
[1:31:10] but oh how liberating when confusion is
[1:31:12] released
[1:31:15] the only thing you're just confused I
[1:31:18] want to ask you something now just just
[1:31:19] think of this
[1:31:21] did you always love the Lord Jesus now
[1:31:23] watch his response brother Brian asked
[1:31:25] him a question did you always love the
[1:31:27] Lord Jesus well I belong to the
[1:31:29] Presbyterian Church I just went there
[1:31:32] did you catch what brother Ram asked him
[1:31:34] did you always love the Lord Jesus no I
[1:31:37] went to a message Church
[1:31:39] that doesn't mean we love the Lord Jesus
[1:31:44] see a person can be in love with God in
[1:31:47] their intellect they're in love with the
[1:31:48] concept of God they're in love but
[1:31:51] that's only in the spirit Realm
[1:31:53] it's got to come down to Agape in the
[1:31:56] soul
[1:31:58] that's what the holy spirit is to where
[1:31:59] we really love God because you can love
[1:32:01] him with your spirit and in your mind
[1:32:03] and if something don't agree with you oh
[1:32:06] there'll still be sin coming out
[1:32:10] it'll still be things coming out in the
[1:32:12] life now watch which I says this did you
[1:32:14] always love the Lord Jesus well I belong
[1:32:16] to the Presbyterian Church
[1:32:18] I just went there
[1:32:20] so maybe if you're someone here this
[1:32:22] morning that's just went
[1:32:23] to believe your spoken word Tabernacle
[1:32:25] well you know I knew brother brownie if
[1:32:27] you just went
[1:32:29] and you really don't love him now let's
[1:32:31] watch because I know a lot of times
[1:32:32] we'll say we love him now let's watch
[1:32:34] well I want to ask you what happened
[1:32:36] what taken place that changed your mind
[1:32:39] all at once
[1:32:41] he said well my wife she went down to
[1:32:42] the Pentecostals and she got into the
[1:32:44] spirit and she come back man she was
[1:32:46] happy I said what'd you think about it
[1:32:49] did you criticize it oh that's a that's
[1:32:51] another point right there what'd you
[1:32:52] think about it did you criticize
[1:32:56] said no he said here's what I thought
[1:32:58] how'd you see how it lasts
[1:33:01] it went on
[1:33:02] she seemed to have it he said one day I
[1:33:05] was coming in from making a cell in the
[1:33:07] yard
[1:33:08] and I reached in my pocket and somebody
[1:33:09] gave me a little old tract I sat down in
[1:33:11] the office and I began to read that
[1:33:12] track and the awfullest feeling come
[1:33:15] over me that I ought to get right with
[1:33:17] God
[1:33:18] he said since then I've been searching
[1:33:20] ever since you see what happened
[1:33:22] conviction
[1:33:24] conviction
[1:33:26] or how I thank God for conviction
[1:33:29] I thank God in this hour because you
[1:33:31] want to know one sign of judgment is at
[1:33:32] hand convictions leaving
[1:33:35] the preaching of the word can go on and
[1:33:37] be ministered and be preached and God
[1:33:39] demonstrating God manifesting himself
[1:33:41] and lives just walk right on the same
[1:33:43] way it's a sign judgment is at hand
[1:33:48] that's where we're at
[1:33:50] he said I want to ask you something when
[1:33:52] this feeling come over you
[1:33:54] you've never been able to get out of it
[1:33:57] you've never been able to get out of it
[1:33:58] no sir I haven't
[1:34:00] well that's when you receive Christ
[1:34:02] it doesn't mean raising your hands
[1:34:04] speaking in tongues shouting that's all
[1:34:06] right but that's attributes of Christ
[1:34:08] after he come in
[1:34:11] to receive Christ is to receive the
[1:34:14] person Christ Jesus receive him is life
[1:34:18] shouting speaking in tongues
[1:34:19] demonstrations all those attributes will
[1:34:21] follow but first is to receive Christ
[1:34:26] brother Bradley said then you mean I've
[1:34:28] been saved the whole time
[1:34:30] brother REM said
[1:34:31] do you love him notice what the question
[1:34:33] comes back to do you love him
[1:34:36] with all my heart
[1:34:40] one time you didn't love him that's
[1:34:42] right and now you love him that's the
[1:34:45] truth well you had him the whole time
[1:34:48] he jumped off the porch and began crying
[1:34:51] and holding me in his arms he said oh
[1:34:53] god I've been a Christian all these
[1:34:55] years you see the thing of it was he
[1:34:57] wasn't straightened out
[1:34:59] in the beginning
[1:35:03] now this wasn't something this man was
[1:35:05] making up you understand he did he he
[1:35:07] did not he was not settled where on the
[1:35:10] word of God
[1:35:12] his experience nothing could take that
[1:35:14] away from him even his confusion could
[1:35:17] not dismantle his experience
[1:35:20] this man is not saying well I was
[1:35:22] confused and that's why I was still
[1:35:24] going out in the world and looking at
[1:35:25] this and doing that and I was still
[1:35:26] doing that you know I was confused nope
[1:35:29] because when the seal has come that's
[1:35:31] what came on this man he had a genuine
[1:35:34] experience
[1:35:36] confusion was hindering him from being
[1:35:40] an open available channel that was
[1:35:43] walking in full Authority
[1:35:46] that's what confusion will do that's why
[1:35:49] the word comes to bring Clarity in our
[1:35:51] lives that's why it comes to where we're
[1:35:53] pointed to the Holy Ghost with the real
[1:35:55] clear true evidence because it's not
[1:35:58] just saying well you've got to receive
[1:35:59] it you've got to receive it while the
[1:36:01] word's coming forth it doesn't line up
[1:36:03] with the scripture that happened in Acts
[1:36:05] 10 but also Paul laid his hands upon
[1:36:07] them
[1:36:08] it doesn't even have to be inside of a
[1:36:11] church what it has to be is is you have
[1:36:14] to meet Jesus Christ
[1:36:17] it's more than just having a knowledge
[1:36:19] of the word this message never came to
[1:36:22] produce a religious life
[1:36:26] Baptists have that and can snow us under
[1:36:28] any day
[1:36:30] it's true this should not come to
[1:36:32] produce a religious life a religious
[1:36:34] work the G listen the Pharisees and
[1:36:37] Sadducees what did Brother Graham tell
[1:36:39] us they had more fruits of the spirit he
[1:36:41] said they can outshine it
[1:36:42] come on now Christian Science he said
[1:36:45] could outdo it is that right
[1:36:47] but you see there's a difference here in
[1:36:49] that word in that life that's lived into
[1:36:52] the word let me let me just get to this
[1:36:53] place here he said notice he said that
[1:36:55] human being can be changed from a pig to
[1:36:58] a lamb because he's got a soul made in
[1:37:00] the image of God well his thoughts
[1:37:03] change the company says this his
[1:37:05] thoughts change something does it for
[1:37:08] him as a man thinketh in his heart
[1:37:10] Christ the Creator come to him in a
[1:37:13] still form and created his own Spirit
[1:37:16] took the man's nature away
[1:37:19] to love dancing and the world and
[1:37:23] carrying on
[1:37:26] over the same I just got a little bit
[1:37:27] discouraged
[1:37:29] if the nature of the world is still
[1:37:31] there you'll go back to it
[1:37:34] and the discouragement oh if this hadn't
[1:37:37] happened oh brother Samuel long years
[1:37:39] ago it if the nature is still there
[1:37:42] you'll gravitate toward the things your
[1:37:45] nature to
[1:37:50] have a riding of the enforcement
[1:37:52] that's right it's got to be dead
[1:37:56] to love dancing the world and carrying
[1:37:58] on now you know we could put like a
[1:38:00] whole lot of other things in there
[1:38:03] I think back to it when God got a hold
[1:38:05] of my life there probably wasn't they're
[1:38:07] probably and I've told my boys this I
[1:38:09] said they're probably wanting nobody
[1:38:10] else where the problem was because you
[1:38:11] know they didn't have such stuff as that
[1:38:12] fantasy football and everything else
[1:38:14] that goes on nowadays
[1:38:16] but I mean as far as known guys that
[1:38:18] played football knowing stats being
[1:38:19] involved with all that and being able to
[1:38:21] talk that and and you know I enjoyed it
[1:38:24] I enjoyed it
[1:38:25] but you know one thing that happened to
[1:38:27] me when God got a hold of my life I
[1:38:29] didn't have to do that as a matter of
[1:38:31] fact my life went like on a blank slate
[1:38:34] where I didn't know who won the Super
[1:38:35] Bowl
[1:38:36] I didn't know who was in what bowl I
[1:38:38] only knew I had cereal in mind
[1:38:41] oh brother Simon oh what's happening
[1:38:44] you see it isn't just that it steal
[1:38:46] things of the world many times we
[1:38:49] classify and look what he does Satan
[1:38:51] puts it as oh the world is drinking oh
[1:38:53] the world is smoking all the world is
[1:38:54] running around the world's looking at
[1:38:56] things on the internet the world and it
[1:38:57] puts it all out there and what you want
[1:38:59] to do he wants to leave it so that we
[1:39:01] feel secure
[1:39:05] surely God
[1:39:08] but you see the world is the world
[1:39:11] if you're still looking for through the
[1:39:13] world for your satisfying portion if
[1:39:16] it's still what satisfies you if it's
[1:39:17] still what calms you if it's still what
[1:39:19] you run to you need to really evaluate
[1:39:22] your life
[1:39:24] and you need to look and say Lord have I
[1:39:26] really went all the way
[1:39:28] come on friends don't be quiet on me
[1:39:31] this is real evaluation time you may not
[1:39:34] you may not like it but remember it's
[1:39:36] not it's not meanness it's not uh you
[1:39:39] know the brother Samuel's upset it's God
[1:39:41] in his Mercy to you and I
[1:39:43] to speak to us in our lives in our walk
[1:39:46] with God
[1:39:48] I would rather know right now like that
[1:39:50] black brother said he said I want I
[1:39:52] don't want no trouble when I come down
[1:39:53] to the river
[1:39:59] and from that time notice it took away
[1:40:01] the nature to love dance in the world
[1:40:03] and carrying on and from that time he
[1:40:05] just laid it aside
[1:40:07] and was hungering after God aha
[1:40:11] laid aside the things of the world
[1:40:14] and another sign hungers after God
[1:40:19] hungers after God
[1:40:22] longs
[1:40:24] to please the Lord
[1:40:26] it's his Delight this is this is why the
[1:40:30] man was searching on and on and on
[1:40:32] this man I have no doubt I know and
[1:40:34] sometimes we get to the other side no
[1:40:36] doubt we'll meet him
[1:40:38] oh my and to think about it how it was
[1:40:40] for you how it is for me
[1:40:43] how when God breaks back confusion and
[1:40:45] you can really see the clarity of it
[1:40:47] this man
[1:40:49] Not only was the things of the world
[1:40:51] gone
[1:40:52] but it was hungering after God
[1:40:57] you see there's a lie there's a thing
[1:40:58] where God will clean up a life and a
[1:41:00] life can be changed as far as the
[1:41:03] desires and the things of the world but
[1:41:05] it's also got to come to where it's a
[1:41:06] hungering after God
[1:41:08] it's the first thing after God
[1:41:10] that's why I've said when you look at
[1:41:12] certain things like things can get right
[1:41:13] in the way right in the way of coming to
[1:41:15] the house of God and you might think
[1:41:16] brother Samuel you harp on this you harp
[1:41:18] on that is it me or is it God
[1:41:21] is it me or is it God
[1:41:24] because there how many times there's too
[1:41:26] many quotes
[1:41:27] there's too many statements in the word
[1:41:29] of God
[1:41:32] oh
[1:41:34] but the brand tells us if you've got the
[1:41:36] love of God in your heart you can't wait
[1:41:39] for those Church doors to open to get in
[1:41:41] there and fellowship with your brothers
[1:41:44] and sisters
[1:41:45] so CNN about well I can get it all on
[1:41:47] the internet you know I don't need
[1:41:48] nobody
[1:41:49] that's called selfishness
[1:41:53] but you see it's more than that oh but
[1:41:55] at the same I know people can come to
[1:41:56] church and but don't let that be an
[1:41:58] excuse what about you right are you
[1:42:00] hungering after more of God are you
[1:42:02] hungering after more of God or are you
[1:42:03] just satisfied where you're at are you
[1:42:05] content where you at or do you want more
[1:42:07] of God
[1:42:09] I know there's circumstances that come
[1:42:11] up I know I know situations that come
[1:42:12] under
[1:42:17] then God will bring an evaluation that
[1:42:19] we can know right really where we are
[1:42:23] oh my
[1:42:25] God was in him the whole time think
[1:42:27] about it he has to become it has to
[1:42:30] become a thought
[1:42:32] before it can become a word and that
[1:42:34] word is expressed and it will be
[1:42:36] materialized
[1:42:39] let's let's just bow our heads
[1:42:42] we can't finish here
[1:42:49] as our hands are bowed think about this
[1:42:52] the ram said we're Christians by faith
[1:42:54] through grace of God we are Christians
[1:42:56] God In His Infinite Mercy called us to
[1:42:58] be reconciled to him through his son
[1:42:59] Christ Jesus and that settles it not
[1:43:01] what we've done but what he done he
[1:43:04] changed my soul from the things of the
[1:43:08] world
[1:43:09] unto the things of God from horse races
[1:43:12] and gambling and adultery and lying and
[1:43:15] stealing he changed my soul
[1:43:18] he changed my thoughts
[1:43:21] now my thoughts have become so real to
[1:43:23] the become words in my lips
[1:43:25] they materialize and I'm a Christian it
[1:43:28] made me a different person
[1:43:30] that's what made
[1:43:32] you
[1:43:33] you see it's receiving it
[1:43:36] in our heart the Bible said that man
[1:43:37] believeth with a heart
[1:43:40] first
[1:43:41] but bran said I believe it in my heart
[1:43:43] that I'm a Christian because I've
[1:43:44] accepted the Lord Jesus Christ if I
[1:43:46] don't cry if I don't move if I don't do
[1:43:48] a thing in my heart first I believe that
[1:43:50] Christ died for me in my stead I
[1:43:52] accepted as a Christian I believe it as
[1:43:54] a Christian then it's in my heart then I
[1:43:56] express it in a word I'm a Christian
[1:44:00] and then I start walking as a Christian
[1:44:02] talking as a Christian Living as a
[1:44:04] Christian being as a Christian
[1:44:05] and by my fruits I'm recognized by the
[1:44:08] world
[1:44:08] as a Christian
[1:44:11] I'd say here this morning
[1:44:14] if it don't have that that life and that
[1:44:16] testimony it's not lined up why don't
[1:44:19] you invite God to line it up for you say
[1:44:21] Lord I'm trying I'm tired of trying to
[1:44:23] connect dots
[1:44:26] I'm tired of trying to line it up
[1:44:29] and I know
[1:44:31] I need Lord everything
[1:44:34] my thoughts
[1:44:36] testimony and my life to be lined up
[1:44:40] God bless you
[1:44:43] bless your hands
[1:44:46] maybe there's lives that you know within
[1:44:48] that you can look at it and you know
[1:44:49] there's been a change but you see
[1:44:51] certain things as coming in
[1:44:53] and the hungering after the things of
[1:44:55] God there's things that's starting
[1:44:56] that's starting to get pushed aside
[1:44:58] pushed aside pushed aside
[1:45:01] you say Lord
[1:45:04] I want a renewing Lord
[1:45:06] I want to renew him
[1:45:08] I want my life to be so lined up because
[1:45:12] the words that you would have the
[1:45:14] thoughts to drop down into my life to be
[1:45:16] expressed and when I express them I'm
[1:45:18] not expressing my own thoughts I'm a
[1:45:21] Christian I'm expressing your thoughts
[1:45:23] when problems arise in the home problems
[1:45:25] arise in the job I want to be Lord so
[1:45:28] separate help me to lose my own will my
[1:45:31] own thoughts my own opinions oh God both
[1:45:34] of my hands are up Lord Jesus help me

[1:46:42] Prophet when he actually asked for
[1:46:43] somebody in New in Albuquerque New
[1:46:46] Mexico to come and instruct the people
[1:46:49] their lord in April of 63 and somebody
[1:46:51] come instruct them on how to receive the
[1:46:53] Holy Ghost
[1:46:55] he finally stepped back up to the
[1:46:56] platform himself
[1:46:59] and he spoke Lord such words of
[1:47:01] simplicity
[1:47:03] he said when you are willing to fully
[1:47:05] surrender he will fully come in
[1:47:10] Lord God you've never complicated your
[1:47:13] word
[1:47:15] but Lord you in Simplicity come to make
[1:47:18] it so real to us Lord

[1:47:58] would come our way but greater is he

[1:48:07] bring this outer
[1:48:09] man in subjection

[1:48:15] would say
[1:48:16] or I'm entitled to do this or are
[1:48:18] attempted to this no Jesus was tempted
[1:48:21] in all points such as we are
[1:48:23] he was even tempted
[1:48:27] to have a wrong feeling

[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:53:01] of his glory
[1:53:04] angry
[1:53:07] if you've fallen in a trap if there's
[1:53:10] things that you know every one of us we
[1:53:12] have to overcome
[1:53:13] is that right there's an overcoming
[1:53:17] there's things you have to overcome
[1:53:18] there's things I have to overcome
[1:53:22] Pastor can't do it for us Prophet can't
[1:53:24] do it for us but God equips us to
[1:53:27] overcome
[1:53:28] he equips us to overcome you might look
[1:53:31] and say this trap this situation don't
[1:53:34] get focused on that Turn Your Eyes Upon
[1:53:36] him
[1:53:38] and be like David say Lord teach my
[1:53:40] hands how to fight this woman
[1:53:43] because my way of trying to fight and
[1:53:45] it's not working
[1:53:46] and you know the whole thing about it is
[1:53:48] God's saying let me who is in you fight
[1:53:51] this battle
[1:53:53] you can't do it but me in you I will
[1:53:56] overcome through you
[1:54:00] so the Trap is not what we're looking at
[1:54:02] let's look unto Jesus
[1:54:06] their strength like I was quoting the
[1:54:08] other night but the RAM talks about a
[1:54:09] boat he said you take a boat that don't
[1:54:11] have a motor on the back of it all you
[1:54:12] got is paddle power right
[1:54:14] you get hung up in something or you
[1:54:16] got's paddle power
[1:54:18] but if that boat has got an engine
[1:54:21] attached to it
[1:54:22] if it gets stuck somewhere it's got a
[1:54:25] throttle power
[1:54:26] that can get it out
[1:54:29] and that's what real faith is you might
[1:54:31] get stuck sometimes
[1:54:34] but there's a throttle power
[1:54:36] there's a power on the inside
[1:54:40] amen there's a power on the inside
[1:54:42] there's a part within your life to say
[1:54:43] there ain't nothing to go back to
[1:54:45] there's no world to go back to I don't
[1:54:47] want to go back to the world I want to
[1:54:49] serve God I want to go on with God what
[1:54:52] is it you're reaching is starting up
[1:54:54] that throttle power I've got hung up
[1:54:56] here a little bit maybe I've got in a
[1:54:58] trap something that appeals and you're
[1:55:00] drawn to
[1:55:02] but thanks be to God there's a throttle
[1:55:04] power
[1:55:05] I said there's a throttle power
[1:55:08] there is one in the ship that's greater
[1:55:11] than the ship
[1:55:13] as Jesus said there is one standing in
[1:55:16] the temple that's greater than the
[1:55:17] temple
[1:55:18] there is one standing in your life in my
[1:55:21] life that's greater than this Temple
[1:55:22] it's greater than all the efforts of
[1:55:25] Samuel Browning it's Jesus Christ
[1:55:27] and if I can just yield to that word say
[1:55:29] Amen Lord Lord take me there
[1:55:33] then what was a trap
[1:55:36] you'll stand
[1:55:39] as a testimony
[1:55:42] God gave me Grace to overcome in this
[1:55:44] area of my life
[1:55:45] what was something that was all it was a
[1:55:48] it was hard but God gave me Grace
[1:55:51] you know what it is it's fruit
[1:55:54] I said it's fruit
[1:55:57] he who overcame
[1:55:58] is manifesting his overcoming strength
[1:56:02] through your life
[1:56:05] what do I do well as a branch a branch
[1:56:07] can't do anything on its own a branch
[1:56:10] just receives the life from the Vine
[1:56:13] I think the greatest thing we do is say
[1:56:14] Lord make me more like you
[1:56:17] help me to die more to myself more to my
[1:56:19] will more to my opinions because it's
[1:56:22] Samuel's opinions it's got Samuel in
[1:56:23] trouble
[1:56:24] it's Samuel's will that's got Samuel
[1:56:26] Samuel in trouble yep it's not been
[1:56:28] nobody else it's been it's right this
[1:56:30] guy right here
[1:56:31] right yeah you're right Bill Sanchez
[1:56:33] nothing for me but for you
[1:56:36] that's right every one of us right every
[1:56:38] one of us
[1:56:41] help me Lord
[1:56:42] help me to die more to myself
