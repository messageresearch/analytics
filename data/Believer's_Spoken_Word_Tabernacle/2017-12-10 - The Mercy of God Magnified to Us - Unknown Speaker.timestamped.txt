[44:03] brothers will come will take up the
[44:05] mission offering as they're coming you
[44:07] brother Brian made mention of the
[44:09] announcement weeks in and out by way of
[44:11] email that brother George Smith will be
[44:14] here with us on January 11th and 12th
[44:17] and I know that that's a Thursday in a
[44:19] Friday and that's what the George was
[44:21] was able to work out and there's just
[44:24] some plans that we have for those
[44:27] services that I'll go into some details
[44:31] with you later some things that just
[44:33] have on my heart and I believe would be
[44:37] a great benefit to us as a congregation
[44:41] so if you can upon your calendars pencil
[44:45] that in on January 11th Thursday night
[44:49] then on January the 12th a Friday night
[44:53] as well I believe that God will he
[44:57] always rewards for sacrifice a lot of
[45:00] things that you know in in our lives
[45:02] it's always the the whole walk as a
[45:06] Christian it's a sacrificial walk but
[45:09] it's not something that when it's of a
[45:11] sacrifice you know something's not a
[45:14] sacrifice if there is a resentment in it
[45:17] you know the meaning for the it is
[45:19] complaint it's not a sacrifice but
[45:22] because remember a sacrifice is what has
[45:24] to be offered unto God and when the
[45:26] worshiper would wall wart wouldn't
[45:28] surrender that sacrifice there were
[45:30] certain characteristics that must be met
[45:32] so the worshiper had to do diligence to
[45:35] find a sacrifice that would fit what God
[45:39] had called for him and with his
[45:41] diligence to do that and present what
[45:43] God had called for it showed his thought
[45:47] his concern of God and for his own soul
[45:52] you believe that so when we look at
[45:55] things in our lives we understand that
[45:57] there are many times that we have
[45:59] sacrifices and things to make but let us
[46:01] in all things we want God to receive the
[46:04] glory so let's just bow our heads here
[46:09] father we are just so thankful Lord that
[46:14] you have given us another opportunity
[46:16] another day Lord truly Lord our our
[46:20] desire is to be with you enoyed father
[46:24] in that were still here upon this earth
[46:27] in these earthen vessels then Lord the
[46:31] next best place that we could be outside
[46:33] of being there with you is to be
[46:37] gathered with you with your children
[46:40] with your feet Lord in this place Lord
[46:43] oh god we assembled here Lord as your
[46:47] prophets that let us gather here as we
[46:50] will gather over there let it be a
[46:52] reflection now Lord you see all of the
[46:56] preparations and everything that's been
[46:58] made Lord for this moment Lord for us to
[47:02] be able to come together Lord we are
[47:06] mindful to understand and to know that
[47:08] is all because of the great sacrifice
[47:11] that you made Lord Oh God to recognize
[47:16] that it's not Lord just the sacrifice of
[47:18] Calvary but the sacrifice that was given
[47:21] father with every prophetic utterance
[47:25] that Lord would announce your coming
[47:28] Lord
[47:28] it was sacrifice that was involved more
[47:31] lives that were set aside on to you Lord
[47:35] and moved by the Holy Ghost
[47:37] Oh God may our our hearts our lives
[47:41] every one of us in every part of our
[47:44] lives be so consumed today Lord in that
[47:47] sacrifice father we ask they would give
[47:51] Lord from their hearts Lord I pray that
[47:53] God you'll take and multiply and
[47:55] directed Lord to the need and the desire
[47:57] Lord that it is taken in Lord we pray
[48:00] father we just commit this service Lord
[48:03] all of the needs Lord God that have been
[48:07] mentioned here Lord we lift them up Lord
[48:09] before your throne once again
[48:11] and we want to say Lord that we thank
[48:13] you Lord that indeed you are we have
[48:16] found you to be Lord the high priest
[48:18] that is touched by the feeling of our
[48:21] infirmities Lord we love you Lord Jesus
[48:24] have your way we pray now in the name of
[48:26] Jesus Christ amen
[48:31] hallelujah
[48:32] let's just turn in the word of God here
[48:35] to Ephesians chapter 1 and we want to
[48:38] read a few verses scripture this morning
[48:46] just three four verses of Scripture and
[48:49] we'll let you have your seat in verse 3
[48:52] of Ephesians 1
[49:05] blessed be the God and father of our
[49:07] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[49:11] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[49:14] places in Christ according as he hath
[49:18] chosen us in him before the foundation
[49:23] of the world that we should be holy and
[49:26] without blame before him in love having
[49:30] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[49:33] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[49:36] according to the good pleasure of his
[49:39] will to the praise of the glory of His
[49:44] grace wherein he have made us accepted
[49:47] in the beloved I'd like to speak this
[49:52] morning on a thought the mercy of God
[49:55] magnified to us may God bless you bless
[49:59] the reading of his word as you're being
[50:01] seated
[50:06] in the message the believers position in
[50:10] Christ but the Branham is quoting as
[50:14] though someone would say I thought the
[50:17] spiritual blessings only come the
[50:19] fellowship the Holy Spirit only come on
[50:21] pinnacle this is thirty two years later
[50:25] that's the blessing of the Ephesians
[50:27] church the Gentile church blessing us in
[50:31] heavenly places you can only be in
[50:35] heavenly places when you're in Christ
[50:39] Jesus so just to be clear on this
[50:45] heavenly places is not a feeling
[50:50] heavenly places is a place it's a person
[50:55] it's a dwelling place feelings can come
[51:00] and feelings can go and how that we love
[51:04] to feel God's presence but yet the
[51:09] dwelling in heavenly places is not
[51:12] feelings neither is it based upon
[51:15] feelings but it is solid it is
[51:18] sovereignly based upon God Himself
[51:21] bringing to pass what he already has
[51:25] declared he says so if the Holy Spirit
[51:29] baptized them into heavenly places then
[51:32] it baptizes into heavenly places now the
[51:36] same fellowship heavenly places in
[51:39] Christ now quickly gneisses I'll give
[51:42] you my view and then we'll have to go
[51:45] according as he God has chosen us not my
[51:49] desire not your desire
[51:52] it wasn't Paul's desire but he has
[51:55] chosen us in him before the foundation
[51:57] in the world he said did you think of
[51:59] that he chose us in him before the
[52:01] foundation of the world that we should
[52:03] be holy not cause I lived right because
[52:09] he chose me to be that way he done it
[52:12] not I because of every way that we
[52:18] living let me just say it like this even
[52:22] for when you take into account the
[52:25] Pharisees and the religious of that day
[52:28] there was not one finger you could put
[52:31] on their life yet they were sinners is
[52:36] that right
[52:37] not one finger because by the word
[52:40] they're here they were moving but the
[52:42] word itself standing there and discerns
[52:47] what is down within their heart and
[52:49] that's where the word could declare
[52:52] according to their heart you are a
[52:54] sinner and that's where the Prophet
[52:57] could say that when we refuse or one who
[53:01] refuses to walk into the full counsel of
[53:04] God is a sinner it's powerful statement
[53:07] because when God has made known remember
[53:10] - said to be a sinner is to reflect sin
[53:14] and sin is unbelief is that right so to
[53:18] see that it that even with when the Lord
[53:22] Jesus came the word itself never came
[53:25] and paid homage or bowed down to them
[53:29] and in a manner that all they were they
[53:32] were living just so righteously but
[53:35] remember the Lord Jesus himself spoke
[53:37] that he called for that there must be a
[53:40] righteousness that would exceed the
[53:43] righteousness of the Pharisees there's
[53:47] only one righteousness that can exceed
[53:50] and that is the righteousness of God and
[53:52] that righteousness of God is that
[53:54] righteousness that comes on the inside
[53:57] of a person to where they now dwell in
[54:02] God's own righteousness to where the
[54:06] desire to where the nature has been
[54:09] changed and then that's where the word
[54:12] comes up to declare that whosoever is
[54:15] born of God cannot sin for his seed
[54:20] remaineth in him so here brother Branham
[54:28] is is making this clear he's not
[54:30] speaking against living
[54:32] right because the real gospel of Christ
[54:34] calls us to a to to a trueness and to
[54:40] live correctly according how God has
[54:43] ordained for us to live
[54:45] what is speaking of is that there's
[54:47] nothing that could merit what God has
[54:51] already done that what we see taking
[54:54] place now and how God dealing with our
[54:58] life is what was already foreordained
[55:01] before the foundation of the world he
[55:06] says this that's the reason you're holy
[55:08] this afternoon not because you deserve
[55:12] it
[55:13] but because he chose you to be that way
[55:17] he says when before the foundation of
[55:20] the world holy and without blame before
[55:23] him in love how could we do it there had
[55:29] to be a masterpiece do that and that was
[55:32] Christ Jesus listen you don't remember
[55:35] it neither do i but we was before the
[55:40] foundation of the world I'm gonna dwell
[55:44] very heavily beginning with his service
[55:46] upon those those emphasis here you don't
[55:49] remember it neither do i but we was
[55:52] before the foundation of the world this
[55:58] is going to require a greater search
[56:01] than any search engine can produce it's
[56:05] going to require something greater
[56:07] that's able to search it all the way
[56:11] back and find out and that way it might
[56:14] be known who we are it's home I let me
[56:21] just move on here he God gives
[56:26] expression he's brother brems says when
[56:28] God made man let us make man in our own
[56:32] image let us give them plural make men
[56:37] that then plural that's you and me
[56:40] that wasn't just Adam and Eve that's the
[56:43] sons and daughters of God this was the
[56:47] word that was declared give them and God
[56:49] will not it has not taken back his word
[56:54] but he manifested he manifested through
[56:59] lives that are surrendered to his
[57:02] purpose
[57:03] glory be to God make man in our own
[57:08] image spirit man and give them dominion
[57:10] over the fishes of the sea the cattles
[57:13] and so forth Genesis 1 God was saying
[57:15] that he said now back there before the
[57:17] foundation of the world God chose you in
[57:20] Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end
[57:25] time all the way from the foundation of
[57:29] the world now what you think of this as
[57:34] as he has chosen and ordained for me to
[57:39] be holy for you to be holy
[57:41] then it rests it rests solemnly on him
[57:47] to provide what is needed in order to
[57:50] bring this about it's on him he's the
[57:55] one to bring that about in order to
[57:56] bring forth this holiness now let me
[57:59] just not to dwell on this but let me
[58:01] just to do to really set this forth
[58:04] remember this holiness is not a holiness
[58:08] of our own accord
[58:10] this is his holiness his righteousness
[58:14] are you with me and remember one of the
[58:18] very first statements that pasal paul
[58:21] would make in the beginning of the book
[58:23] of Romans and he declared that the
[58:25] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[58:28] was raised from the grave by the spirit
[58:32] of holiness so the Holy Ghost is the
[58:37] spirit of holiness
[58:38] it's the Spirit of God when that has
[58:41] taken place and that new birth that is
[58:44] holy unto the Lord it is separated unto
[58:49] the Lord Himself so it's up to go
[58:53] God to provide away that this can be
[58:58] within our lives now let's understand
[59:00] we're not just we're when we're speaking
[59:02] of this and looking at how that you know
[59:06] when we're taking of the mercy of God we
[59:08] want to look at that greatness of it of
[59:11] what God's mercy what what God would
[59:14] have mercy is is not that things would
[59:17] be allowed to continue God doesn't want
[59:19] us living a life of the fee he don't
[59:22] want you living a life of defeat
[59:24] that's not Calvary was not an emblem of
[59:27] defeat Calvary is the emblem of victory
[59:33] Amen were all the debt that was against
[59:37] us was settled and then on that Easter
[59:39] morning he got up he rose here he showed
[59:44] openly spoiling principalities and
[59:46] blotted out the handwriting that was
[59:49] against us it's showing that power and
[59:53] authority that God would desire and
[59:57] desires to declare in our life as an
[1:00:00] overcomer so it's the same way with any
[1:00:07] part of God's Word you when God is as
[1:00:10] spoken in his word it is God who must
[1:00:13] come on the scene and bring that word to
[1:00:16] pass it's gotta be anything anything
[1:00:19] that you have need of and I have needed
[1:00:22] in my life even those things that God
[1:00:24] would be dealing with in your life it
[1:00:26] takes him to come on the scene but
[1:00:28] there's got to be a desire a longing for
[1:00:32] him to come and fulfill that the word
[1:00:35] itself will start to stir you up and for
[1:00:38] those things and you say well I haven't
[1:00:40] received it yet but the word is
[1:00:42] conditioning you to ask for what God
[1:00:46] desires to fulfill you see the Spirit of
[1:00:51] this age is an age of of incentive and
[1:00:53] give me this and give me that and I
[1:00:55] don't want this and I believe deserve
[1:00:57] this and I deserve that we don't deserve
[1:00:59] nothing I'll tell you right now we don't
[1:01:04] even deserve a bicycle to come to church
[1:01:06] on
[1:01:07] we don't deserve nothing
[1:01:15] so it takes God coming on the scene to
[1:01:18] fulfill his word it has to be God coming
[1:01:22] through that word calling now look at
[1:01:25] this even when a word itself is
[1:01:27] preparing to come into full
[1:01:30] manifestation the God Himself begins to
[1:01:33] brood upon that word and through that
[1:01:35] word he's calling a vessel and through
[1:01:39] that promise he's calling a vessel and
[1:01:41] st. defying a vessel that the Lord God
[1:01:45] Himself who is the fulfillment of that
[1:01:48] promise might step into and manifest
[1:01:52] that promise in that age because this is
[1:01:55] the promise you are not safe at by
[1:01:58] anything else other than the word of
[1:02:00] Almighty God amen and that word is a
[1:02:04] word that comes forth pointing back to
[1:02:06] the atonement of Calvary and we think of
[1:02:09] this of even how that Moses himself
[1:02:11] ascended on the Mount when there had
[1:02:13] been a affair of failure in the camp and
[1:02:16] Moses said the first place the word is
[1:02:18] used in the scripture I will go and make
[1:02:20] an atonement he never backed the
[1:02:22] sacrifice upon that mountain
[1:02:24] he never packed blood up there you say
[1:02:26] what was the atonement the atonement was
[1:02:29] Christ revealed in the promise of his
[1:02:32] word and that word was standing there
[1:02:34] and what God could see in Moses he saw
[1:02:37] the cross in their standing that's why
[1:02:40] every promise of the word of God that is
[1:02:43] made manifest truly will reflect Jesus
[1:02:47] Christ oh my my my
[1:02:51] by that promise God does not use
[1:02:54] anything but his word to call his
[1:02:58] children by is that right Paul said
[1:03:02] you-you-you heard the gospel of your
[1:03:05] salvation it's a word for our day a word
[1:03:11] that calls us a word that sanctifies us
[1:03:13] and a word that puts us into service
[1:03:18] oh my so he comes in that like manner we
[1:03:23] see that even in Isaiah when God here as
[1:03:28] Isaiah an ordained vessel but God begins
[1:03:31] to make known the promise and as he's
[1:03:34] making known that promise
[1:03:35] it shows up the sin that's there and
[1:03:39] Isaiah must confess is that right he had
[1:03:43] to confess first then cleansing comes
[1:03:46] behind that then after cleansing then
[1:03:49] there comes a commissioning three stages
[1:03:52] so we find that the Prophet goes into
[1:03:55] this in the message Satan's Eden it says
[1:03:59] then he said were made one of his
[1:04:01] attributes from his own body
[1:04:03] God has attributes in his body like
[1:04:06] you're an attribute of your father and
[1:04:08] you notice she was in your grandfather's
[1:04:11] grandfather's grandfather's but in that
[1:04:13] say we'll take it down like you and your
[1:04:15] father now you did not know anything
[1:04:18] when you were in your father the germ of
[1:04:21] life comes from the male the male has
[1:04:24] the blood cell the woman has the egg and
[1:04:26] therefore the blood cell has the life in
[1:04:28] it and then when you were in your father
[1:04:30] you actually know nothing about it but
[1:04:34] yet science and God's Word proves that
[1:04:37] you were in your father but you know
[1:04:39] nothing about it but then the father
[1:04:42] longed to know you and with the union of
[1:04:46] connection with mother then you were
[1:04:49] made known to Father amen so even in
[1:04:55] great-grandfather's way back his longing
[1:04:58] to know only thing that
[1:05:00] great-grandfather can know was not you
[1:05:03] he could only know that which would be
[1:05:06] his children his sons and daughters that
[1:05:10] would be born in that generation but yet
[1:05:14] inside of there even when that son would
[1:05:16] come forth then what is it that life
[1:05:18] that name is continuing on are you with
[1:05:22] me and then there are children that
[1:05:25] continue to come forth that are bearing
[1:05:27] attributes that many times that will be
[1:05:29] a true
[1:05:30] it's from generations that's gone by in
[1:05:33] different things but yet those
[1:05:34] attributes will come out because it's
[1:05:37] still associated with the DNA now you
[1:05:44] are your father's attribute you look
[1:05:48] like him don't stay with me now don't
[1:05:51] get down on yourself
[1:05:52] you've got parts of your body that looks
[1:05:55] like your father and let me add this you
[1:05:58] act like him to come on somebody and you
[1:06:03] act like different things that have been
[1:06:05] have come about it and different
[1:06:06] responses to things but when you have
[1:06:09] been born of the Holy Ghost you have
[1:06:13] received equipment into a gene that is a
[1:06:16] prevailing gene a many prevails over all
[1:06:20] of those things that's the way God was
[1:06:30] in the beginning every son of God and
[1:06:33] every daughter of God was in God at the
[1:06:35] beginning you don't remember it now but
[1:06:39] you were there he nodes you look at this
[1:06:42] now he wanted you to become so he could
[1:06:45] contact you speak with you and love you
[1:06:48] and shake your hands God wanted to be
[1:06:52] able to do that all I think about the
[1:06:54] Prophet over and over he says you don't
[1:06:57] know who's sitting besides you on that
[1:06:59] pew he said turn around and look at him
[1:07:01] he said that's a son and daughter of O
[1:07:03] Matic god that's sitting right next to
[1:07:06] you God wanted to have contact with me
[1:07:10] he want that contact with you he wasn't
[1:07:13] that have fellowship with you and I let
[1:07:15] me tell you something fellowship is not
[1:07:17] a one-way street failure fellowship is a
[1:07:20] two-way it is coming and bowing they
[1:07:24] meant God not only wanted to speak but
[1:07:26] he wants us to speak back hallelujah
[1:07:31] they meant no wonder Solomon could say o
[1:07:33] my dove let me see that countenance any
[1:07:37] hear that sweet voice God wants to hear
[1:07:41] you and I he
[1:07:42] wants to have fellowship with you and I
[1:07:45] oh yes sir don't you want your own boy
[1:07:53] isn't it a great day when your boy can
[1:07:57] come home sit down at the table when he
[1:08:00] comes back from the battlefield or
[1:08:02] something another scarred-up how you'll
[1:08:05] fix the dinner you'll kill the fatted
[1:08:08] calf tor whatever more and prepare for
[1:08:10] him mister doing is expressing there's a
[1:08:14] there is such a love that the father is
[1:08:18] caught up in when there's a return let
[1:08:24] me say this to you the prodigal son when
[1:08:27] he returned home prodigal is not a good
[1:08:31] word prodigal means reckless and
[1:08:35] careless exactly what it means
[1:08:37] but I want you to remember that there
[1:08:40] was an announcement that was given that
[1:08:43] when that prodigal son was coming home
[1:08:45] that I want you to prepare the fatted
[1:08:49] calf I want you to prepare this feast
[1:08:52] let me tell you something this feast
[1:08:54] that you and I are enjoying yet this
[1:08:57] morning has already been prepared with
[1:09:00] you and I in mind the flower has been
[1:09:03] expecting our return glory be to God as
[1:09:09] a matter of fact he said your picture
[1:09:11] and he's been looking at that picture
[1:09:15] you say my picture yes because even when
[1:09:18] he expressed himself from the very
[1:09:21] beginning you and I were identified
[1:09:23] within him there we were identified in
[1:09:26] the believers identified his the promise
[1:09:29] and what was it he was longing for us to
[1:09:32] come into expression hallelujah glory be
[1:09:39] to God it's your own flesh and blood and
[1:09:43] he was in you you didn't know it in him
[1:09:47] then but you knew he was there
[1:09:49] and so God knew that we would be here
[1:09:54] but then he put us in flesh so we could
[1:09:58] be contacted in order he could contact
[1:10:02] he become one of us now watch this now
[1:10:05] in order he could contact he become one
[1:10:08] of us when he become Jesus Christ the
[1:10:12] Son of God himself the fullness of the
[1:10:14] manifestation of God therefore that was
[1:10:17] God's purpose to display his attributes
[1:10:21] in fellowship we see redemption we see
[1:10:28] that the body purpose tabernacle for
[1:10:31] redemption
[1:10:32] within that God was also showing this is
[1:10:37] the full prototype this is the true
[1:10:39] right here this is what every son and
[1:10:42] daughter of God this is not just
[1:10:44] restoring back what Adam fell from but
[1:10:46] beyond that cause Adam could fall are
[1:10:49] you with me Adam could fall but where
[1:10:51] God brings you and I back to that is no
[1:10:54] possibility of falling that is the seal
[1:10:58] of Almighty God that's the seal of the
[1:11:02] Holy Ghost oh my brother's sister this
[1:11:04] is the confidence that we have in him
[1:11:08] confidence in the work that he has done
[1:11:10] that's why that the seal of God his so
[1:11:13] important is so necessary within a life
[1:11:16] and it is the very longing and desire of
[1:11:19] security and peace and confidence within
[1:11:23] the heart of the believer fellowship the
[1:11:28] fellowship he had remember the disciples
[1:11:31] many times was talking they didn't know
[1:11:36] who was talking was talking is it the
[1:11:39] visit the flesh or is it gone behind the
[1:11:41] hatch right because this is exactly
[1:11:45] where God God was letting it be known
[1:11:47] this is where I've come to restore to
[1:11:51] where I come and Tabernacle behind in
[1:11:54] the vessel in the flesh of my children
[1:11:56] to where the fulfillment of John 5:19
[1:12:00] the son can do nothing but what he seeth
[1:12:03] the father doing that doeth the son
[1:12:05] a fellowship a communion where the word
[1:12:09] itself here is being disclosed what God
[1:12:12] would desire within that hour I tell you
[1:12:17] for God desires more than just coming to
[1:12:19] church God desires a lot more than just
[1:12:23] good works you're cheating yourself
[1:12:24] you're robbing God but not giving all of
[1:12:29] your life to the Lord you're robbing God
[1:12:32] of what he has paid the price and made a
[1:12:36] way of what He desires to do through you
[1:12:42] but he can only do it as we submit to
[1:12:45] him it's got to be a word that will call
[1:12:47] us and listen the word as it calls us
[1:12:50] it´ll sanctifies to that purpose and put
[1:12:53] us in to service when I was in my father
[1:12:58] I knew nothing about it but when I
[1:13:02] become his son and was born of him I was
[1:13:04] attribute a part of my father and you're
[1:13:06] a part of your father and as a children
[1:13:09] of God we are part of God's attributes
[1:13:10] that was in him made flesh like he was
[1:13:14] made flesh so we can have fellowship one
[1:13:17] with the other as a family of God upon
[1:13:19] the earth and that was God's purpose at
[1:13:22] the beginning that's what God wanted at
[1:13:25] the beginning now I want to look here
[1:13:29] and in the word because here what God
[1:13:35] has already declared our memory cannot
[1:13:40] declare that our intellects cannot grasp
[1:13:44] that is that right the mind cannot
[1:13:49] conceive that not at all so there must
[1:13:53] be a searching back through there there
[1:13:57] must be that which would help us and
[1:14:01] bring us to this realization and once
[1:14:06] you think of this that when brother
[1:14:09] Brown would give back that that
[1:14:11] illustration of that young man who was
[1:14:15] in slavery
[1:14:18] being in this land but yet because he
[1:14:21] knew who he was by knowing who his
[1:14:25] father was that reality it affected his
[1:14:31] conduct even though he's here in slavery
[1:14:35] but that understanding affected him here
[1:14:44] the Lord Jesus prayed that where I am
[1:14:49] they may be also you see here's the word
[1:14:55] made flesh desiring the word is desiring
[1:14:59] when it comes to bring us into that
[1:15:02] place of fellowship so the word when
[1:15:07] it's spoken and it comes is not a word
[1:15:10] of condemnation
[1:15:12] it will bring rebuke and it will bring
[1:15:14] correction but remember rebuke and
[1:15:17] correction is not condemnation it will
[1:15:20] lead to condemnation if it's not heeded
[1:15:23] - but there must be rebuke and
[1:15:27] correction that would come to do what it
[1:15:30] would speak against the ideology and the
[1:15:34] vain imaginations and the idolatry of
[1:15:37] the hour because in those things the
[1:15:41] children of God are still walking in
[1:15:44] bondage and there must be a world that
[1:15:48] would have Jenner
[1:15:49] knows idols that would a Jenner those
[1:15:52] images that would adjourn those things
[1:15:54] why to break it around because look it's
[1:15:59] the word it continues on if it's just
[1:16:01] well you know everything's fine you know
[1:16:03] you know how it is God understands how
[1:16:05] sorry we are God understands this I'll
[1:16:08] tell you what you might be laying too
[1:16:09] much to God understanding God
[1:16:12] understands his word come on somebody
[1:16:15] God understands a real a real dedicated
[1:16:19] walk God understands and he knows when
[1:16:22] excuses are made instead of submission
[1:16:26] God does understand but God don't
[1:16:30] understand Lord I just can't do this
[1:16:32] because you know in this hour this is
[1:16:35] such a hard hour he don't understand
[1:16:36] that because he lived and walked in his
[1:16:43] time and he had to be that he was
[1:16:46] tempted in all points such as we are yet
[1:16:49] without sin
[1:16:51] he had to be that you and I can be
[1:16:55] tempted come on somebody
[1:16:57] but notice this he never made an
[1:17:00] exception it was not a compromise but he
[1:17:03] is there as a faithful high priest to
[1:17:06] minister on our behalf he understands us
[1:17:09] but his understanding is not a
[1:17:12] compromising were you with me the
[1:17:17] understanding in this hour that God has
[1:17:20] opened from generation to generation it
[1:17:23] did not weaken it did not come with some
[1:17:26] sort of watered-down puny excuse but it
[1:17:29] came packing the full efficacy of the
[1:17:33] blood of Jesus Christ that you and I
[1:17:36] might know that there is a true and
[1:17:38] perfect and total deliverance absolutely
[1:17:47] but then I can't help it oh yes you can
[1:17:50] oh yes you can brother send my
[1:17:54] generation but listen I'm talking about
[1:17:56] a different generation not generations
[1:18:00] and talking about a generation one
[1:18:05] singular the generation of Jesus Christ
[1:18:09] are you with me you see don't allow the
[1:18:17] devil to sell you what God never
[1:18:22] intended for you to have you ever had
[1:18:26] somebody try to give you a product you
[1:18:27] ordered the right one but they send the
[1:18:29] wrong one to you or they put the wrong
[1:18:32] wipers on your car whatever more and
[1:18:33] they say well you know you can go ahead
[1:18:35] you can just you can just have them you
[1:18:38] can you know these will be just as good
[1:18:39] no I want what I pay for if I didn't pay
[1:18:45] for the cheap plastic ones I don't want
[1:18:47] the cheap plastic ones I want the ones
[1:18:48] that are a rubber you with me but you
[1:18:57] understand what I'm saying hey if you
[1:18:58] order it's fake and somebody brought you
[1:19:00] out a hamburger
[1:19:01] you say well it's be a menu order beef
[1:19:03] this is beef too but I didn't want beef
[1:19:04] with cheese and lettuce and onions and
[1:19:06] tomatoes and whatever more that's for a
[1:19:07] different day you understand what I'm
[1:19:10] saying
[1:19:12] you have a right to die upon the Word of
[1:19:18] God that God has revealed in this hour
[1:19:22] you have a right as a partaker of his
[1:19:26] divine nature to ask him and say Lord
[1:19:29] let this be real in me I don't
[1:19:35] understand and when when when people say
[1:19:37] well I got the Holy Ghost getting the
[1:19:39] Holy Ghost makes you stop praying it
[1:19:42] makes you stop seeking for God to make
[1:19:44] himself war real not at all it's a love
[1:19:49] affair and all of these Lord prayer more
[1:19:52] desiring God continue to quicken your
[1:19:54] work continue to make yourself more real
[1:19:58] the Holy Ghost is not an act of
[1:20:01] complacency the Bible said eNOS power
[1:20:03] for service they man it is God Himself
[1:20:08] giving the divine energy that his will
[1:20:11] might be fulfilled let me move on a
[1:20:17] little bit here in Joel chapter 33 you
[1:20:23] see job was in a condition in his life
[1:20:25] he'd been offering the lamb he offered
[1:20:27] the lamb and full assurance and faith
[1:20:30] but there was a conversation that we
[1:20:32] know that have been had and God was
[1:20:35] bragging on Joe
[1:20:37] yeah each time you know when you're
[1:20:40] getting tested and trialed tried God's
[1:20:42] been bragging on you it was you and I
[1:20:47] would say Lord yeah I don't need be
[1:20:49] bragged on right now come on our flesh
[1:20:53] don't love tests and trials well let's
[1:20:58] go on Joe had and this everything that
[1:21:03] had happened to Joe he was tested in all
[1:21:06] things even to where where what Satan
[1:21:11] had told God I'll make him curse you to
[1:21:13] your face even where that influence
[1:21:16] would come upon his wife and Joe being a
[1:21:18] prophet and I want to say at this he
[1:21:20] wasn't just because he was a prophet
[1:21:22] that he was able to discern that it
[1:21:25] wasn't she was a foolish woman but she
[1:21:27] spoke as a foolish woman it was because
[1:21:30] Jill was a believer and Joe was under
[1:21:34] that lamb come on somebody we're talking
[1:21:38] about victory that is for everybody it's
[1:21:41] victory from the Prophet to the pastor
[1:21:43] the apostle victory to the janitor
[1:21:45] victory to the youngest child it is
[1:21:47] victory that is released in the camp of
[1:21:51] Almighty God are you with me this isn't
[1:21:54] just for one enough for the other this
[1:21:55] is not nickel alien ism where we have
[1:21:59] one holy man among us and we raise that
[1:22:02] holy man up and both I could only be
[1:22:03] like that holy man whole second no
[1:22:05] sadder weak tear them images down every
[1:22:10] one of them walk just as you and I
[1:22:12] walked they have went through the same
[1:22:14] things that you and I have went through
[1:22:17] they meant that God has showed through
[1:22:20] them that you can also as you will
[1:22:25] submit through me
[1:22:26] here's job the situation is coming to
[1:22:31] joven remember job if you notice in the
[1:22:34] in in in in in the scriptures there in
[1:22:37] the book of Job the company that job is
[1:22:40] keeping with begins to turn his view
[1:22:48] Joe begins to move from being focused on
[1:22:53] the lamb to being focused on himself he
[1:22:57] begins to exalt his righteousness my of
[1:23:00] rightness come on somebody because see
[1:23:03] that's what this company was all about
[1:23:05] Bildad in life fast that's what these
[1:23:07] guys knew they interpreted things going
[1:23:12] on by what they could see around them
[1:23:14] they had no insight to the other realm
[1:23:18] they were earthbound creatures listen to
[1:23:22] me
[1:23:23] Joe a prophet of God what if we can say
[1:23:25] as a type in that day one made and built
[1:23:29] to live in a heavenly place with
[1:23:31] Almighty God but yet the wrong company
[1:23:33] it started to bring this eagle down how
[1:23:37] are they bringing joke down they were
[1:23:39] not tearing down his sacrifice they
[1:23:41] weren't coming at him and crossing Joe
[1:23:43] to look at himself so job started to
[1:23:47] actually declare well I've done this and
[1:23:49] I've done that and I've done this and
[1:23:50] I've done that I've done this and I've
[1:23:51] done that and I've done this and I've
[1:23:52] done that he's looking at himself his
[1:23:56] eyes what is it it's a word that's
[1:23:58] moving his eyes from this sacrifice but
[1:24:05] there must come one who can tell Joe Joe
[1:24:07] look away Joe look away it's gotta be
[1:24:13] one who can come who has a vision that's
[1:24:16] able to break that hole where this Eagle
[1:24:19] has somehow come down it's got to come a
[1:24:21] word that's able to lift this evil back
[1:24:24] into the heavenly Amen he was not built
[1:24:28] and made to live there and neither are
[1:24:30] you built and made to live in the world
[1:24:33] you're not made and built to live under
[1:24:35] gloom and sorrow and all those things
[1:24:37] you might be walking there this morning
[1:24:40] but there is a word that is able to
[1:24:43] break that blue
[1:24:44] and that darkness hallelujah here comes
[1:24:55] Ella who in job 33 verse 1 he says unto
[1:24:59] job I pray thee hear my speeches and
[1:25:02] hearken to all my words behold now I
[1:25:05] have opened my mouth my tongue has
[1:25:06] spoken in my mouth my word shall be of
[1:25:09] the uprightness of my heart and my lips
[1:25:11] shall utter knowledge clearly the Spirit
[1:25:14] of God hath made me and the breath of
[1:25:18] the almighty has given me life the
[1:25:23] inspiration here is one who is standing
[1:25:26] now talking to Joe watch what he says if
[1:25:31] thou canst answer me set thy words in
[1:25:34] order before me stand up behold I am
[1:25:39] according to thy wish in God's stead I
[1:25:42] also AM formed out of the claim what's
[1:25:47] job receiving job's receiving the
[1:25:50] Ministry of one who is like him one who
[1:25:57] is made in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:26:00] I am clay as thou art because before God
[1:26:04] can speak directly to job there's got to
[1:26:08] be a sacrifice go before there's got to
[1:26:13] be one who can stand in the gap one who
[1:26:17] can stand in the breach are you with me
[1:26:20] before God can speak lift to hear there
[1:26:23] must come this what is it
[1:26:25] it's reconciling bringing joke back from
[1:26:29] his doubts
[1:26:30] how is he being brought back from this
[1:26:32] by the word of true assurance behold my
[1:26:40] terror shall not make the afraid o glory
[1:26:42] neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee
[1:26:45] in that wonderful that's what he had had
[1:26:49] been experiencing a heavy hand upon him
[1:26:52] the heavy hand doesn't let it wasn't let
[1:26:54] him it wouldn't let
[1:26:55] oh come into come out of those
[1:26:57] experiences meaning growling and
[1:27:00] drilling Truscott it was a heavy hand
[1:27:01] that was coming on him but verse 8
[1:27:03] surely thou has spoken in mine hearing
[1:27:06] and I've heard the voice of thy word
[1:27:08] saying watch this I am clean without
[1:27:11] transgression
[1:27:12] I am innocent neither is there iniquity
[1:27:14] in me this is what job started saying
[1:27:16] why that was the words that he was
[1:27:19] setting under come on somebody it was a
[1:27:24] word that was causing him just to look
[1:27:27] at himself and listen to me now
[1:27:30] we the word will always direct us to
[1:27:33] take inventory of our life but the word
[1:27:36] will never direct us to where we begin
[1:27:40] to observe our doings above the word it
[1:27:44] won't that won't happen it causes us to
[1:27:47] take account of our life been here verse
[1:27:50] 10 behold he findeth occasions against
[1:27:53] me he counted me for his enemy he putted
[1:27:55] my feet in the stocks he markets all my
[1:27:57] paths behold in this thou art not just I
[1:28:01] will answer thee that God is greater
[1:28:04] than man why does thou strive against
[1:28:08] him why are you striving against him you
[1:28:13] know and Joe's probably wondering why is
[1:28:15] this taking so long is that right I have
[1:28:18] heard but now I see brother bamse he was
[1:28:20] a prophet he knew there had to be an
[1:28:21] understanding for this why didn't the
[1:28:24] understanding come sooner well God also
[1:28:28] teaches us patience but at the same time
[1:28:32] God is also letting joke know right here
[1:28:35] that you were striving against me how am
[1:28:39] i striving against you by declaring I am
[1:28:42] free from transgression I am righteous
[1:28:46] come on somebody
[1:28:49] God is saying you're striving against me
[1:28:52] that's my work I'm the one who makes you
[1:28:55] clean I'm the one who makes you
[1:28:57] righteous I'm the one who calls you to
[1:29:00] be upright so after this-here a
[1:29:07] sacrifice a sacrifice has come a word
[1:29:10] the godless couldn't come direct there
[1:29:12] has to be a word that comes and stands
[1:29:15] in this place and now God after this
[1:29:19] time with Ellie who a type of Christ now
[1:29:25] God can speak lip to ear listen to me
[1:29:30] God draws you and I by the promise of
[1:29:33] his word the Holy Spirit dealing with
[1:29:35] the life calling a life and then was he
[1:29:37] doing he's making the preparation that
[1:29:40] he might come in and have fellowship
[1:29:44] with your eye but he doesn't let
[1:29:48] something else do the preparation
[1:29:50] he sends his word which is himself that
[1:29:54] prepares for him to come show 38 verse 1
[1:30:00] then the Lord answered job I know this
[1:30:03] familiar but look at this then the Lord
[1:30:05] answered job out of the whirlwind and
[1:30:06] said who is this not dark enough counsel
[1:30:09] by words without knowledge look at this
[1:30:11] God answered you God God already he's
[1:30:14] had this he's Roy he's been waiting to
[1:30:16] let this go but now's the time to answer
[1:30:19] him why there's a sacrifice that's went
[1:30:21] forth and the sacrifice is also dealing
[1:30:25] perfectly with job to do what bring job
[1:30:31] into a place to where the word can speak
[1:30:33] to him to where the word can begin to
[1:30:35] interpret his life beyond what is seen
[1:30:37] here Jo 38 verse 1 and we read that
[1:30:43] verse 2 who is this that darkeneth
[1:30:45] counsel by words without knowledge gird
[1:30:47] up now thy loins like a man for I will
[1:30:50] demand of thee an answer thou me where
[1:30:54] was that when I laid the foundations of
[1:30:56] the earth declare if thou hast
[1:30:59] understanding
[1:31:04] that's too far back for the mind to
[1:31:07] grasp who laid the measures thereof if
[1:31:14] thou knowest or who that stretched the
[1:31:17] line upon it whereupon all the
[1:31:19] foundations there are fastened or who
[1:31:21] laid the cornerstone thereof when the
[1:31:23] morning stars sang together and all the
[1:31:25] sons of God shouted for joy and joke
[1:31:28] continues to go on I won't forsake of
[1:31:31] time he continues to move on through
[1:31:35] this place all the way as God continues
[1:31:39] to make known God calls job's attention
[1:31:42] to things that killed no no mortal man
[1:31:46] has ordered these things is that not
[1:31:49] what Ella who said I will call to your
[1:31:52] attention that God is greater than man
[1:31:54] is that right here is God is letting him
[1:31:57] know even the simplest thing you have no
[1:32:01] answer who set this forth who set this
[1:32:05] who stopped us here who did this here he
[1:32:07] has no answer what's it what's into it
[1:32:11] he's dismantling he's letting job
[1:32:14] letting job see that our lives are not
[1:32:19] interpreted by the things we see but
[1:32:23] rather the sovereignty of God by faith
[1:32:27] by discernment listen friends in every
[1:32:32] part of our life listen when the word of
[1:32:35] God has come to us the Spirit of God it
[1:32:38] brings to us discernment to walk with a
[1:32:43] discernment in our life that discernment
[1:32:46] of the Holy Spirit that discernment that
[1:32:49] comes by the word a discerning a word
[1:32:52] that sharpens the senses he's sharpening
[1:32:59] he's interpreting here he has to Joe
[1:33:02] he's interpreting and declaring his
[1:33:04] oversight of job's life see job's droves
[1:33:10] looking at what what he sees around him
[1:33:12] catastrophes and the men that were
[1:33:15] around him were
[1:33:16] trying to interpret his life by what was
[1:33:18] going on God said no you're not a
[1:33:23] temporal creature you might be here but
[1:33:25] you're one of my children these things
[1:33:29] temporal do not hold the mystery of your
[1:33:31] life
[1:33:32] I hold the mystery of your life so here
[1:33:37] God is interpreting to job his life the
[1:33:42] order of it what's he doing he's heir
[1:33:46] placing job's faith he's restoring job
[1:33:49] anybody ever been through a trial you've
[1:33:52] been to a situation or you can say he
[1:33:55] has restored my soul he didn't save it
[1:34:00] again he restored it he lifted it like
[1:34:03] David would talk about when it was
[1:34:04] succumbed under all the darkness and the
[1:34:06] gloom and oh if I could only see only I
[1:34:08] can only behold God God restores so what
[1:34:12] does it do here is what how he stores
[1:34:14] that's all right everything else coming
[1:34:17] right into position
[1:34:18] oh my job answers him buy a job you know
[1:34:26] as he answers the Lord in verse 42
[1:34:29] uh-huh look at this testimony in verse 2
[1:34:31] before job 42 I know thou canst do
[1:34:34] everything and that no thought can be
[1:34:36] withholding from be the word is
[1:34:40] declaring not only what joel has said
[1:34:42] but it's declaring his thoughts all
[1:34:45] right here who is he that hided counsel
[1:34:49] without knowledge therefore have I
[1:34:50] uttered that I understood not things too
[1:34:53] wonderful for me which I knew not here I
[1:34:55] beseech thee and will speak I will
[1:34:57] demand of the and declare thou unto me I
[1:35:00] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:35:02] year but now my eye wherefore I abhorred
[1:35:09] myself and repent in dust and ashes
[1:35:16] see the word it comes straighten him out
[1:35:21] he's a straightening mop not in a
[1:35:23] condemnation but what is repentance
[1:35:25] repentance isn't taking something with
[1:35:27] you but it's saying what God has said
[1:35:31] David said I hate that which thou hatest
[1:35:33] oh but it's you aligning with that and
[1:35:36] say Lord I stand with you on this we've
[1:35:40] got a dress or something here our life
[1:35:42] is a stand with you Lord what are you
[1:35:44] doing you're declaring yourself a Levite
[1:35:48] you are drawing your sword and saying I
[1:35:50] am on the Lord's side this thing that
[1:35:55] I'm looking at that is idle you will
[1:35:58] lead me back into bondage but I must
[1:36:00] stand fast in the Liberty wherewith
[1:36:04] Christ hath made me free and be not
[1:36:07] entangled again in the yoke of bondage
[1:36:10] is that right Paul was speaking to
[1:36:14] children of God in Galatia amen those
[1:36:19] that had been raised up under the word
[1:36:22] right think of this here you see all of
[1:36:32] this and I'm barely getting into my
[1:36:36] thought
[1:36:42] but to take this into account that
[1:36:47] here's to a job without an answer in
[1:36:53] himself for what was taking place
[1:37:02] gary was come under this he's looking at
[1:37:07] this looking at this he's justifying
[1:37:09] himself if we could say it in this
[1:37:14] manner listen to me by him doing that
[1:37:18] you could say deserves to remain that
[1:37:21] way
[1:37:28] but God Rich and mercy moves down and
[1:37:35] realizes he needs he doesn't deserve it
[1:37:44] he's justified himself but the mercy of
[1:37:49] God over rights and it is the mercy of
[1:37:56] God that steps in and breaks that around
[1:38:00] children's life that same mercy of God
[1:38:05] that has stepped into your life that
[1:38:08] same mercy of God that steps into my
[1:38:10] life that same mercy of God over and
[1:38:13] over again just look at another example
[1:38:17] there you have a man upon the earth by
[1:38:22] the name of Abraham God deals with
[1:38:26] Abraham and he speaks to Abraham he
[1:38:31] makes himself known to Abraham through
[1:38:33] the ages and Abraham comes into a place
[1:38:36] of where what God has seen in his life
[1:38:43] Abraham has come to fully identify and
[1:38:50] here is Abraham God makes himself known
[1:38:55] that the promise of what I have spoken
[1:38:59] what I told you in the previous chapter
[1:39:02] that you thought to be impossible Sarah
[1:39:06] thy wife shall have the sign and that's
[1:39:10] who I will establish my covenant with
[1:39:16] all right so here here is Abraham they
[1:39:22] received this visitation and Genesis 18
[1:39:25] and at the very latter parts of this
[1:39:29] Abraham sees them coming out and they're
[1:39:35] looking towards Sodom the Bible says
[1:39:37] that Abraham goes with them for a little
[1:39:42] bit toward Sodom God has spoke this look
[1:39:48] look at this look at this fellowship
[1:39:50] that is being had here at this tent
[1:39:55] shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[1:40:01] which I do
[1:40:08] God's desire to reveal its preparations
[1:40:12] to his servant and God's desire look it
[1:40:17] doesn't stop there he reveals the
[1:40:19] preparations to his children to whom
[1:40:22] that word is intended for Paul said that
[1:40:26] dispensation of the gospel is committed
[1:40:28] unto me for you to fulfill the Word of
[1:40:31] God so here Abraham area sees he's
[1:40:37] standing here and God God begins to
[1:40:41] declare what he knows the caliber listen
[1:40:44] to me now listen to me in verse 18 he
[1:40:49] says seeing that Abraham shall surely
[1:40:53] become a great and mighty nation and all
[1:40:56] the nations of the earth shall be
[1:40:57] blessed in him what's he doing he's
[1:41:00] prophesying listen to me now they're
[1:41:08] still here as it was God prophesying of
[1:41:13] the promise that is to come forth and
[1:41:15] not just a son but a great and mighty
[1:41:18] nation that there be a gathering of
[1:41:23] people God is not speaking to the
[1:41:34] caliber of a natural man that Abraham is
[1:41:36] he's speaking to the caliber of the DNA
[1:41:40] that lays in him the spiritual DNA God
[1:41:47] knows that DNA because why he chose him
[1:41:51] that's what God is speaking to is that
[1:41:56] DNA sometimes this DNA gets in the way
[1:42:00] are you with me this DNA laughed in the
[1:42:05] previous chapter but the word kept
[1:42:09] coming
[1:42:11] you can't eat an ear of corn just off of
[1:42:14] a stock you can't eat it just off of a
[1:42:17] shoot you can't even eat it off of a
[1:42:20] tassel it's got to come into fruition
[1:42:23] the way that was spoken now is coming
[1:42:27] into fruition
[1:42:29] and it's God who is brooding over
[1:42:35] Abraham's life to bring forth what was
[1:42:40] there for I know him
[1:42:44] oh my that he will command his children
[1:42:46] and his household after him and they
[1:42:49] shall keep the way of the Lord to do
[1:42:51] justice and judgment and that the Lord
[1:42:53] may bring upon Abraham that which he has
[1:42:55] spoken of him the scripture says in
[1:43:03] verse 23 abraham drew near what's this
[1:43:09] he sees there's something remember God
[1:43:14] has said shall I hide shall I hide look
[1:43:19] at this fellowship he sees him looking
[1:43:22] he draws near not further he draws
[1:43:27] closer you see when God begins to move
[1:43:30] on draw near just say Lord drawn here
[1:43:36] but God is making a promise no when God
[1:43:38] is speaking you draw nigh unto me and I
[1:43:42] will draw and Abraham drew near and
[1:43:49] remember how Abraham begins to say
[1:43:51] without destroy the righteous with the
[1:43:53] wicked for adventure there 15 he goes on
[1:43:56] look how Abraham is speaking here in
[1:43:59] verse 25 shall not the judge of all the
[1:44:03] earth do right and the Lord said if I
[1:44:07] find in Sodom 50 righteous within the
[1:44:09] city then I will spare all the place for
[1:44:12] their sakes
[1:44:17] Lott doesn't have a clue
[1:44:22] he doesn't know judgment is coming he's
[1:44:29] not aware of that where he is living
[1:44:31] he's not aware he doesn't lock does not
[1:44:35] have disfellowship listen to me lock
[1:44:39] might be a righteous man but he's not an
[1:44:41] elected son of God are you with me
[1:44:45] righteous person but he's not living in
[1:44:49] a place where God is communing and
[1:44:52] fellowshipping lot is not residing in
[1:44:55] heavenly places but it's gone Abraham
[1:45:01] would still be making gods he would
[1:45:06] still be worshiping idols come on
[1:45:10] friends you and I would still be
[1:45:12] worshipping idols of what a Christian is
[1:45:15] but God who is rich in mercy speaks
[1:45:18] directly to your life let me say this
[1:45:23] clearly his purpose is not just to call
[1:45:25] you to this church his purpose is that
[1:45:29] you would be delivered and translated
[1:45:32] into the kingdom of his dear son that
[1:45:37] you would become alive in Christ not
[1:45:39] that your mind is alive but that you're
[1:45:42] alive that serving God is not a duty it
[1:45:48] is a privilege
[1:45:49] [Music]
[1:45:51] have to do this you don't have to do
[1:45:54] anything when God does a work and you're
[1:45:57] like he is first above all other things
[1:46:01] if there's anything else before him
[1:46:03] there's another god I don't care if it's
[1:46:05] jobs family whatever it is understand be
[1:46:10] water
[1:46:10] the order is him family then god they're
[1:46:16] right
[1:46:17] that's the order of overcoming come on
[1:46:20] friends we're not trying to be well I
[1:46:22] want to be a good Samaritan I'm by the
[1:46:26] way boy did it let's let's look at that
[1:46:28] for a moment has he brought that up what
[1:46:30] is a good Samaritan is a good Samaritan
[1:46:34] handing out fruit baskets to the poor no
[1:46:38] what is a good Samaritan let's look at
[1:46:40] what the scripture said that when others
[1:46:43] passed that one by but good Samaritan
[1:46:46] who I will see a good Samaritan he saw
[1:46:49] one in need and he knew that there was a
[1:46:52] place that he could take them to where
[1:46:54] he could get help and What did he say he
[1:47:01] said to the innkeeper the prophet brings
[1:47:05] that to the local assembly to the
[1:47:07] innkeeper he said take care of this
[1:47:09] knowledge this and when I return I will
[1:47:12] give you your reward
[1:47:15] it's alright when I play in religion
[1:47:21] we're not playing you know I'm doing
[1:47:24] doing my part this is not it God doesn't
[1:47:26] smile on us just because we come to
[1:47:28] church on Sunday that doesn't smile on
[1:47:31] us just because we pay our tithes and
[1:47:33] offering all those things apart now of
[1:47:35] worship as opening prayer was different
[1:47:37] but listen there God desires the whole
[1:47:40] of our life they mend this message did
[1:47:46] not come to just be something that we
[1:47:48] agree with he came to release that life
[1:47:53] within us to break
[1:47:57] from around our lives that we not by
[1:48:01] mental conception but by the reality of
[1:48:05] God's memory of us be released in ours
[1:48:08] and now are we called the sons of God
[1:48:14] and not called the son of God that's
[1:48:17] like you know today you know I just say
[1:48:19] whole brother Samuel here you know let
[1:48:22] me just give you an example so everybody
[1:48:23] can understand this oh you know brother
[1:48:25] salmon he's wearing a big white hat and
[1:48:27] wearing a white coat and everything else
[1:48:29] brother Samuel is chef but because I've
[1:48:32] got a hat on in akola
[1:48:33] I'm a chef this is not what called the
[1:48:37] sons of God means this is not an earthly
[1:48:40] voice calling us the sons of God this is
[1:48:44] our father that lets us know you're my
[1:48:47] children
[1:48:48] you're my offspring you are my sons
[1:48:52] you're my daughters it's not because
[1:48:55] that I am identified with clothing of
[1:48:58] this hat and this thing it's his life
[1:49:02] and his life will bring forth in me all
[1:49:08] right take the spirit of John Dillinger
[1:49:10] put it in you you act like John
[1:49:12] Dillinger right some you got people in
[1:49:18] mind right now you take the spirit of
[1:49:21] Jesus crying or a spirit of Beethoven
[1:49:23] you act like Beethoven right you've
[1:49:27] caused what that's inspiration but when
[1:49:31] the inspiration comes that inspires you
[1:49:35] correctly to release you come on
[1:49:39] somebody there's a lot of inspiration
[1:49:41] that can come but yet that takes the
[1:49:43] inspiration that's able to transform you
[1:49:49] then it's not something that you're
[1:49:51] walking around and saying I'm a son of
[1:49:53] God I'm a daughter of God the life
[1:49:55] testify are you oh yes sir we need they
[1:50:03] need the inspection of the Holy Ghost we
[1:50:06] need that inspection here is Abraham
[1:50:09] speaking here I'm closing here he speaks
[1:50:13] a lot very speaking here the Angels go
[1:50:17] down to visit Sodom
[1:50:19] you know that's a you know listen to me
[1:50:21] that's a mercy of God yes it's a message
[1:50:26] if they're taking a message to Sodom
[1:50:28] it's not a rapturing message Billy
[1:50:33] Graham and Oral Roberts you won't make
[1:50:34] them ready for the rapture see it
[1:50:37] doesn't have within it it's not the
[1:50:38] promise of the hour that's able to call
[1:50:40] sanctify and put in service you as me
[1:50:46] but it can call it can call them out but
[1:50:48] this is where I want you to look at this
[1:50:50] here how that law is told of the
[1:50:54] impending judgment Locke is remaining
[1:50:58] that he's tearing around looking at
[1:51:00] things and he's looking all around and
[1:51:02] the scripture says that in verse 16
[1:51:05] after he was told arise get out of here
[1:51:08] verse 16 while he lingered you don't
[1:51:13] want to be lingering when God deals with
[1:51:15] your heart that's the mercy of God you
[1:51:18] want to move right on that and for you
[1:51:20] to believe and say that's me that is the
[1:51:23] mercy of God they lingered the men laid
[1:51:27] hold upon his hand and upon the hand of
[1:51:29] his wife and upon the hand of his two
[1:51:31] daughters the Lord be
[1:51:33] merciful unto Him and they brought him
[1:51:37] forth and set him without the city and
[1:51:40] it came to pass when they had brought
[1:51:42] them forth abroad he said escape for thy
[1:51:45] life look not behind thee neither stay
[1:51:48] now in all the plain escape to the
[1:51:50] mountain lest thou be consumed and lot
[1:51:52] said unto them all not so my lord behold
[1:51:56] now thy servant has found grace in thy
[1:51:59] sight and thou has magnified thy mercy
[1:52:03] which thou has showed unto me in saving
[1:52:06] my life and I cannot escape to the
[1:52:08] mountain unless some evil take me and I
[1:52:11] die
[1:52:11] look at this testimony thy mercy has
[1:52:15] been magnified unto me become great thy
[1:52:20] mercy has become great unto me this is
[1:52:24] large testimony but look at this this is
[1:52:27] where I wonder what you want want you to
[1:52:29] see Abraham is one who was separated
[1:52:36] unto God Abraham is one who was
[1:52:41] separated unto the Lord for the
[1:52:43] fulfillment of the promise given unto
[1:52:45] him and Abraham as we see in the
[1:52:47] scriptures he begins to intercede
[1:52:50] according to the understanding of the
[1:52:53] word for the hour what is it an
[1:52:57] intercessor of Christ what is it what it
[1:53:00] is showing that when the word is
[1:53:02] revealed it is the mercy of God lot
[1:53:13] could not fully comprehend the mercy of
[1:53:18] God as far as bringing it forth out of
[1:53:21] his life
[1:53:22] like Abraham could are you with me but
[1:53:26] here is here is Abraham and that word
[1:53:28] house Abraham stands there to intercede
[1:53:31] he calls us me to think of what James by
[1:53:35] the Spirit of God says that the wisdom
[1:53:38] that is from above is first pure then
[1:53:42] peaceable
[1:53:45] gentle and easy to be intreated full of
[1:53:51] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[1:53:55] without hypocrisy aren't you grateful
[1:54:00] for that that the mercy of God
[1:54:03] full of mercy but without qaulity
[1:54:06] without hypocrisy it doesn't take into
[1:54:09] account any standing here it looks to
[1:54:13] what the need is what is the need there
[1:54:19] amen so the revealed Word of God is the
[1:54:23] mercy of God to that generation the
[1:54:28] revealed Word of God in this hour is the
[1:54:30] mercy of God to this generation and if
[1:54:35] not for that he would smite the earth
[1:54:38] with a curse is that right so the
[1:54:42] revealed mercy of God that word holds
[1:54:45] within it the strength and the power to
[1:54:47] transform it is the mercy of God that is
[1:54:52] magnified than to you and I because the
[1:54:58] heart of God listen to me now the heart
[1:55:00] of God is Christ and Christ is that
[1:55:05] prophesied promise that anointed word
[1:55:10] now come forth and that word must first
[1:55:16] be declared the word must be spoken look
[1:55:18] and with that word coming there must
[1:55:21] come with that word being revealed mercy
[1:55:24] blood interceding for what for what has
[1:55:29] been spoken to come forth mercy Mussa
[1:55:34] come yet
[1:55:35] can I have just a few more moments in
[1:55:38] the book of Exodus chapter 34 after the
[1:55:43] golden calf after everything the
[1:55:46] atonement is made God tells Moses I want
[1:55:52] this journey to resume
[1:55:55] I want you to go on I want you to I
[1:56:00] don't want the people to just reside
[1:56:01] here I want to go I want them to go on
[1:56:05] and he lets Moses know I will send my an
[1:56:11] angel before thee I want you to catch
[1:56:15] this God discloses what He desires to
[1:56:22] reveal to Moses God just doesn't come
[1:56:28] right up and just reveal it he sets out
[1:56:30] I will send mine angel and then this is
[1:56:32] where Moses picks it up and says few
[1:56:36] verses on down by the way what is his
[1:56:44] name
[1:56:47] that's what God wanted him to ask God
[1:56:50] wanted because God wanted to reveal
[1:56:53] himself in fellowship he wanted Moses to
[1:56:58] know this about himself he revealed
[1:57:06] himself to Moses at the burning bush
[1:57:07] Moses was a changed man is that right
[1:57:09] changed by the promise but when you've
[1:57:12] been changed by the promise the promise
[1:57:13] keeps unfolding in you he unfolds
[1:57:17] himself more and more and more that's
[1:57:19] why you can sing the song Amazing Grace
[1:57:22] and you can say oh my
[1:57:24] amazing grace by I can sing it more now
[1:57:27] this morning than when we first begun it
[1:57:34] keeps unfolding himself here's the mercy
[1:57:37] of God is being magnified that word
[1:57:38] magnified means becoming greater and
[1:57:41] greater and greater the very first
[1:57:44] attribute Harry declares his deity and
[1:57:48] the Lord in verse 34 the Lord God
[1:57:51] Jehovah merciful merciful compassionate
[1:58:01] so why would that be needed because
[1:58:05] Moses needs to see this clearly and more
[1:58:10] clear and so does the people you
[1:58:14] understand me the people got to be able
[1:58:16] to pick their head up and walk on
[1:58:20] there's got to be a word that can loosen
[1:58:23] down that they can walk on so God
[1:58:31] reveals himself he's merciful I love how
[1:58:36] it says in verse 7 keeping mercy for
[1:58:38] thousands i'm identified in that verse
[1:58:46] it doesn't matter what others thought
[1:58:48] before we're looking at no doubt oh I
[1:58:50] thought the rapture was gonna take place
[1:58:52] years before it couldn't you can't take
[1:58:54] place without me are you with me
[1:58:59] good take place without me why there was
[1:59:01] mercy kept from me and that mercy that
[1:59:06] was kept and reserved for me it's still
[1:59:09] here with me he kept it for me can you
[1:59:17] say that for yourself he kept it for me
[1:59:21] hey man he makes himself known the Lord
[1:59:24] the Lord God merciful oh my how many
[1:59:30] times David David over and over mercies
[1:59:33] Lord that tender mercies Lord speak to
[1:59:35] me according that tender mercies Lord
[1:59:37] according to the multitude that Mercy's
[1:59:38] no wonder the Scriptures could speak in
[1:59:41] Isaiah 55 to sure mercies of David
[1:59:44] hallelujah oh my David nearly was God's
[1:59:48] mercy let it packed him along and it
[1:59:52] brought him up he that carried him above
[1:59:55] when Saul wanted to take his life it was
[1:59:57] the mercy of God
[1:59:59] it was the mercy of God that would cause
[2:00:01] him to resist the temptation to smack
[2:00:04] the Lord's anointed the mercy of God
[2:00:06] that would hold him
[2:00:09] daven knew about the tender
[2:00:13] tender mercies of God not hard and
[2:00:18] brittle and calloused with the tender
[2:00:20] notice how caught personifying himself
[2:00:23] in his word tender mercies of God
[2:00:29] nehemiah spoke of these things - he
[2:00:33] spoke of all this whole journey
[2:00:35] Nehemiah here recounting at the end
[2:00:37] latter part of Nehemiah
[2:00:39] he would speak of how that God
[2:00:42] throughout the course of time he would
[2:00:45] come and he would deliver the children
[2:00:48] of Israel and they would return back
[2:00:53] then he would deliver him again then
[2:00:56] they would return back and Nehemiah it
