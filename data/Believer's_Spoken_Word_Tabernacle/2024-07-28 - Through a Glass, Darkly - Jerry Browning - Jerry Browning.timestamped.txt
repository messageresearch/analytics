[36:01] pray in Jesus Christ's name
[36:05] amen
[36:06] amen uh amen while you're standing be
[36:09] turn with your Bibles to First
[36:11] Corinthians uh chapter 13 I want to read
[36:15] uh one verse of scripture there verse uh
[36:19] 12
[36:35] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[36:39] but then face to face now I know in part
[36:43] but then shall I know even as I am
[36:46] knowing amen you may be seated i' like
[36:49] to speak on this morning is through a
[36:52] glass
[36:55] Darkly Paul as Paul writes this here the
[36:59] the actually the translation of the word
[37:01] glass is actually
[37:03] mirror uh and so Paul is saying that we
[37:08] as we behold what we are beholding now
[37:11] the revelation we have uh you you
[37:14] realize God wanted to reveal himself
[37:18] first in Christ uh but then God wanted
[37:21] to reveal himself in you the believer
[37:25] and so as we look at ourselves to see
[37:28] the revelation of God actually in us
[37:32] with a changed life Paul is referring to
[37:34] that we're like as looking in a mirror
[37:37] but he says it's like we're looking
[37:39] through one Darkly and the word Darkly
[37:43] means that it what we're seeing is
[37:45] something that is obscure an uh that
[37:49] it's uh the reality of what we're trying
[37:51] to see is actually obscured because of
[37:54] the the mirror uh it also Al translates
[37:58] to the word enigma or like a a riddle
[38:01] it's something that we're looking but we
[38:03] can't see it clearly and you realize the
[38:07] uh uh analogy analogy that uh Paul is
[38:11] using here because you you find that
[38:14] what was mirrors in that day well you
[38:17] know in our at some point within uh
[38:21] man's modernization in that mirrors
[38:24] became glass with reflective thing
[38:26] behind the glass and that and you know
[38:28] your image would begin to come a little
[38:31] more clearly looking at it but at that
[38:33] time they actually would use metals and
[38:36] they would polish those metals to get uh
[38:40] to be able to see the reflection so
[38:42] looking at their uh uh if you ever tried
[38:45] to look at your reflection in in in
[38:47] metal or something like that it it it is
[38:49] not as clear as your common mirrors that
[38:53] you use today but that was the mirrors
[38:55] that they had then the first mention
[38:58] actually of mirrors in the Bible is in
[39:00] the the uh uh the days of Moses when God
[39:04] instructed him to make a labor of brass
[39:08] uh to put in the the Tabernacle uh for
[39:12] the the the priest to come and to wash
[39:15] in that labor before going into the holy
[39:18] place and that it says they gathered the
[39:23] looking glasses of the Israelite women
[39:27] to take and make uh the to melt them
[39:31] down and make this brass labor well the
[39:34] looking glasses and that's the word it
[39:36] uses there in the Old Testament the
[39:38] looking glasses were actually made of
[39:40] brass and that it was polished brass and
[39:43] that's what the people would look in but
[39:45] as you look in a reflection like that
[39:47] you know your image would be kind of
[39:50] obscure you know uh it wouldn't be that
[39:54] clear and that's what Paul is referring
[39:57] to to that uh as we look through a glass
[40:01] Darkly with a mirror we're we're
[40:04] actually trying to see the revelation of
[40:06] Jesus Christ of what's Happening Here
[40:08] but what we see and what's pointed out
[40:11] to us all the time is this old Badger
[40:14] skin that we live in and and and that's
[40:17] what we're looking at and this Badger
[40:19] skin doesn't look anything like what
[40:22] God's word says that we look like you
[40:25] know uh the the Bible tells us that
[40:28] there was coming a time when the shadow
[40:32] became the reality that God was going to
[40:35] take and and the the word was no longer
[40:38] going to be on tablets of stone put into
[40:42] uh the the beautiful Arc of the Covenant
[40:44] but that it was going to be wrote in the
[40:47] hearts uh of of his his Believers and
[40:51] but we look at when it was on the tablet
[40:54] of stone in the the Ark of the Covenant
[40:58] and you look at the description of the
[40:59] Ark of the Covenant it was something
[41:01] very beautiful and and and it was to
[41:04] reflect that what was actually the word
[41:06] of God on the inside was a very
[41:08] beautiful thing but that thing of beauty
[41:11] that represented God was hid behind a
[41:15] veil of badger skin which was a
[41:18] representation of the human flesh so the
[41:21] word of God revealed the the revelation
[41:24] of God that happened in your life to
[41:27] change you and that has made you what
[41:29] you are today it's still hid behind this
[41:33] wall of badger skin and flesh and so
[41:37] when we look in the mirror to see God in
[41:40] us so we look and we see our faults we
[41:44] see our failures we see the temptation
[41:46] of our flesh we see all the failures of
[41:49] our
[41:51] flesh that's good so we really can't see
[41:55] when we looking in this glass dark we're
[41:57] not actually seeing
[42:01] reality we're seeing what came about for
[42:06] mankind because of the Disobedience of
[42:09] the word of God in the garden that
[42:11] caused the fall and caus from that day
[42:14] forward man would die and so our bodies
[42:19] we look at it friends if they our bodies
[42:21] do not reflect what as actually the real
[42:25] lust or what's taking place in our
[42:29] heart because we have eternal life
[42:33] Hallelujah we can no more die than God
[42:36] can
[42:36] [Applause]
[42:38] die but when we look here we see a flesh
[42:42] that's
[42:45] dying you know I I look at some people
[42:48] and God bless you if you fall in this
[42:50] category and and and you look at them
[42:53] and and you can look at them and say
[42:55] well this is what they looked like when
[42:56] they were 20 and you look at them and
[42:58] say they still look the same they're
[43:00] just
[43:02] older friends I I don't know what
[43:04] happened to
[43:06] me I don't look anything like I looked
[43:09] when I was
[43:10] 20 if you saw a picture of me at when I
[43:13] stood here at 20 years old and got
[43:15] married and looked at me today you know
[43:19] I'm getting ready to turn 62 you look at
[43:21] me today and you say that is not the
[43:23] same
[43:26] guy so what I see in the mirror is not
[43:29] what I
[43:30] remember it what I'm looking at today
[43:33] and what you look at it's not what you
[43:36] were now you young people God bless you
[43:39] but I'll tell you if time terries you're
[43:40] going to begin to realize more and more
[43:43] what I'm talking
[43:45] about right oh yeah oh friends look
[43:49] yesterday evening I I I was getting out
[43:51] of the shower and I was trying to dry
[43:53] off and I I reached I'm not going to do
[43:55] it again but I reached with my right and
[43:57] back like this just to drve my back and
[44:00] just that little motion pulled something
[44:01] in my arm and it hurt me all night
[44:04] long I'm like what in the world this
[44:07] never i' never had these kind of
[44:08] problems before this body is not a
[44:12] reflection of what God's word says we
[44:14] are going to
[44:16] be it is a
[44:18] reflection that of sin and death
[44:31] Hallelujah imperfect
[44:34] Humanity brother Brandon makes this
[44:36] statement he says it's in the message of
[44:38] the comforter he says you do not see me
[44:42] he said you see my body you don't see me
[44:45] I don't see you because I only see your
[44:49] body he said this is my hand but who is
[44:53] me he says that owns the hand
[44:57] he said this is my body but who is me
[45:01] that that that own that's in that body
[45:03] it's a spirit I and if I'm born again
[45:06] it's God's holy spirit God's word living
[45:08] in
[45:11] us so we brother R said when you look
[45:13] you see this you see this R says that's
[45:16] not really me right this body is growing
[45:19] old dying and everything but the real me
[45:22] on the
[45:23] inside isn't dying
[45:25] [Music]
[45:27] it's come
[45:31] alive looking at this body is like
[45:34] looking in a mirror and seeing an
[45:36] imperfect image of who you really
[45:40] are that's good you know you uh uh if
[45:44] you ever been to maybe carnivals or
[45:47] things like that they'll have what they
[45:48] call a a house of mirrors or a funny
[45:50] house or whatever and that and you go in
[45:52] there and they got all these different
[45:53] kind of mirrors and you look in those
[45:54] mirrors and they kind of distort you and
[45:57] they can make you look skinny and make
[45:58] you look fat and they can you know
[46:00] distort your image and all that and
[46:02] we're looking at a distorted image when
[46:04] we look at ourselves now I'm not now I
[46:07] want to move Beyond just the the
[46:09] physical looking at our body to to
[46:12] actually look at how we look at
[46:14] ourselves and we see our we see that we
[46:16] make mistakes we see that we have faults
[46:19] we see that no matter how H how much we
[46:22] want to be good you know as Paul says I
[46:25] I want to be good but evil is always
[46:28] present I I I've got to fight with this
[46:31] thing of this
[46:32] flesh and it's because friends when you
[46:35] got a change in your soul there was no
[46:38] change happened to your
[46:40] flesh that's
[46:42] right that's
[46:45] good so brother Brenham says he says my
[46:49] worst enemy is William brandom he was
[46:52] talking about his flesh
[46:57] when I would do good Evil's
[46:59] present Hallelujah so when we when we
[47:03] take a look at
[47:04] ourselves and and we see that uh the
[47:08] times that we can look and we say well
[47:10] boy you know I was feeling pretty much
[47:11] like a Christian there until just the
[47:13] other day and and then I I this or
[47:15] happened and that boy I don't know and
[47:18] you know and S friends look Satan comes
[47:20] to tell you these things and he wants to
[47:23] he wants to stop you from coming to
[47:25] church he wants to stop you from serving
[47:28] God but look what he'll do when it gets
[47:29] close to the day for service how how
[47:32] many times especially during the week
[47:35] sometime right before you know Thursday
[47:38] to come to service and that something
[47:40] happens and the next thing a thought
[47:42] throw goes through your mind I don't
[47:43] even feel like going to church
[47:46] now that's right that's right you're
[47:49] look quit looking at your Humanity
[47:52] friends look as brother as I I said last
[47:54] Sunday brother says we are not perfect
[47:57] in this life and we never will be
[47:59] perfect in this
[48:02] life and and looking at our human but
[48:05] but you actually are perfect the Bible
[48:09] says but it's not talking about you and
[48:12] your Humanity here it's talking about
[48:15] what happened in your
[48:17] soul by by the the the sacrifice that we
[48:21] have become part of of Jesus Christ
[48:25] right
[48:30] so as we we look at this we look at
[48:32] ourselves we think on ourselves
[48:35] sometimes we can't believe what we're
[48:37] seeing yeah because it's not it's not
[48:40] the perfect realization of who we
[48:44] are Hallelujah that's good as as I read
[48:47] to you last Sunday brother B I'm talking
[48:49] about the the sacrifice and the the red
[48:51] heer you know he says God looking
[48:54] through the blood of the Lord Jesus sees
[48:57] you a red sinner white as snow
[49:00] right right so what we need to do is we
[49:03] need to start looking at how God looks
[49:06] at
[49:07] us amen see uh brother B said if we
[49:11] could only look and see as God sees how
[49:15] much different things would look to us
[49:18] right amen
[49:20] hallelujah now in Revelations
[49:25] 3:14 I want to draw something from there
[49:29] uh it says here in the scripture and
[49:31] unto the angel of the Church of L toy
[49:33] and write these things sayth the amen
[49:35] the faithful and true witness praise the
[49:39] Lord now and I'm sure you're very
[49:41] familiar with this no doubt I've read
[49:43] the church age book and things but I I
[49:46] just want to focus on this a little bit
[49:47] that that meaning of the word actually
[49:50] true there the word true there is not
[49:53] referring to the opposite of false
[49:56] what it is referring to is actually an
[50:00] expression of uh of of perfect
[50:04] realization in contrast to partial
[50:09] realization all right so uh you know
[50:13] Jesus says here to John I am the the the
[50:16] the true witness all right so in other
[50:19] words I'm the perfect
[50:22] realization so so the the Bible says uh
[50:25] in John Moos Jesus says Moses gave you
[50:29] not uh the bread from heaven but my
[50:32] father giveth you the true bread from
[50:34] heaven so they received Mana that that
[50:37] God uh would would come down from heaven
[50:40] for the children of Israel when they
[50:41] were journeying in the in the wilderness
[50:44] and so they would go out and they would
[50:47] gather up this Mana this bread Angel
[50:49] bread uh they would gather it up and but
[50:52] they were instructed you know gather up
[50:54] eat what you're going to eat for that
[50:56] day but don't don't try to keep any over
[50:58] because if you do it's going to canker
[51:01] it's going to get worms you know and and
[51:04] and but to point to what the see that
[51:06] was a partial realization or a shadow of
[51:10] what God was pointing to when the
[51:13] promise would be fulfilled that that the
[51:15] seed of the woman would bruise the head
[51:19] of the serpent the coming of Christ so
[51:22] it was it was a shadow pointing to that
[51:25] and so here they would gather that bread
[51:28] but as a a shadow pointing to the
[51:30] perfect realization that that was to
[51:32] come the priest went out and on the
[51:35] first day gathered the first time the
[51:37] bread fell took it put it in the in in
[51:40] in the golden Omar took that and that
[51:42] was put into the holies of holies into
[51:45] the presence of God and that bread
[51:47] unlike the bread that was out there in
[51:50] the well that bread never decayed that
[51:53] bread never got worms in it what was it
[51:56] it was the shadow pointing at the
[51:59] perfect realization that was going to
[52:01] come and then that's when the perfect
[52:03] realization come that's what Jesus was
[52:05] saying I am the bread that came from
[52:10] [Applause]
[52:12] Heaven your fathers did eat Mana in the
[52:16] wilderness and there everyone dead he
[52:18] said but I am the bread that came from
[52:21] heaven in other words I am the perfect
[52:24] realization of what that was point
[52:26] pointing to I am the true witness of the
[52:32] bread
[52:33] Hallelujah he says uh Jesus says in John
[52:37] 15:1 I am the True
[52:43] Vine Hallelujah I am the True Vine the
[52:47] perfect realization of the life of God
[52:51] Glory
[52:52] Hallelujah Paul writes in Hebrews 9:24
[52:56] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[52:58] places made with hands which are the
[53:01] figures of the true but into heaven
[53:05] itself now to appear in the presence of
[53:08] God for us so what Paul is writing here
[53:11] he's saying he's pointing at the there
[53:13] at that time they had the the temple in
[53:16] Jerusalem and they had they had it was
[53:18] set up just like the Tabernacle and the
[53:21] Wilderness had been and here they had
[53:22] the three courts and he says Christ has
[53:25] not entered into that there in the
[53:28] temple because that was just a pointing
[53:32] at what the true was but he has entered
[53:35] into the true holies of holies he has in
[53:39] gone into heaven to stand before God
[53:42] himself in place for
[53:45] you hallelujah
[53:50] hallelujah John in first John John
[53:54] writes because the darkness is pass
[53:57] the True Light now
[54:03] shineth what what what's this Darkness
[54:06] the darkness was all the shadows and
[54:09] type that they were living in the law
[54:11] that they were keeping
[54:13] right it was it was like looking at it
[54:17] in a glass Darkly it was the in the
[54:19] darkness it was in the
[54:21] shadow but but John says now the true
[54:26] light or perfect realization of the
[54:29] light now shines now Israel had
[54:37] light in in when they were in Goan they
[54:40] were at one point the only place that
[54:43] there was any light right
[54:47] literally all of Egypt Darkness fell
[54:50] over it right but then spiritually they
[54:54] had light that that that that because
[54:58] Moses uh you know the the the the
[55:01] scriptures relative to the Messiah that
[55:03] Moses wrote the Revelation pointing to
[55:06] the coming of the Messiah so so they had
[55:09] light that was given to them and then uh
[55:12] the prophets they brought light by by
[55:16] the the prophecies uh pointing to the
[55:19] coming of the
[55:24] Messiah but it but it was brother brand
[55:26] said but it was I it was partial right
[55:30] it was light but it was not the True
[55:34] Light that John talked about that would
[55:36] come and what he was saying is the that
[55:39] was light pointing to light was partial
[55:42] realization but when Christ came it was
[55:45] he he was the
[55:48] light it was no longer prophesying that
[55:51] pointing to the light but he was the the
[55:54] the the person of the
[56:00] light brother says this but he says but
[56:04] now the Fulfillment of the light has
[56:06] come and what was but glowing word was
[56:10] now broken forth into the brightness of
[56:13] God manifested among his people a pillar
[56:16] of fire gave light at night and that was
[56:19] wonderful but now the light of life was
[56:22] manifested in the fullness of the
[56:24] godhead bodily amen
[56:27] amen so he as John writes he was the
[56:30] True Light he was the perfect
[56:33] manifestation of
[56:35] light
[56:38] Hallelujah Moses was a manifestation of
[56:42] the light right but friends Moses was
[56:46] just as much a sinner as all the rest of
[56:48] them
[56:52] right Moses had need every year for the
[56:57] for the sacrifice for his sins just like
[57:00] all the rest of the people
[57:03] did
[57:05] right but the the Bible when it writes
[57:09] of Christ he will it says he was without
[57:15] sin he was he was the perfect sacrifice
[57:19] brother brother bandam he speaks about
[57:21] uh uh uh Joseph and and he speaks you
[57:25] know said Joseph represented a like a
[57:28] Perfection and that but he says but even
[57:30] Joseph himself was not the complete
[57:34] perfect uh reflection of Christ he said
[57:38] Moses he wasn't the perfect reflection
[57:41] of
[57:44] Christ he said he brother BX says in one
[57:46] place said Joseph was the
[57:52] closest
[57:54] Lord but when Christ came it was the
[57:57] perfect it was
[58:03] Perfection brother benam says in the
[58:05] Philadelphian Church age in the church
[58:07] book he says when Christ the perfect
[58:09] substitute was given his blood was shed
[58:12] then the life that was in Christ came
[58:14] back upon the repentant Sinner and that
[58:18] life being the perfect life of Christ
[58:20] sinless righteous then the guilty one
[58:23] could go free for he had no desire to to
[58:26] sin the life of Jesus had come back upon
[58:29] him so when they were were sacrificing
[58:33] the heph and and these sacrifices Paul
[58:35] called it the blood of bulls and goats
[58:38] uh when they were making these sacrifice
[58:40] the reason there was a necessity for a
[58:43] sacrifice uh continuing to to give these
[58:46] sacrifices is because the life of the
[58:49] sacrifice could not come back upon the
[58:52] believer and change them it couldn't
[58:56] take the desire
[58:58] away but why Christ could be the perfect
[59:01] sacrifice and why that his sacrifice
[59:04] could actually uh uh uh uh uh be be once
[59:08] and for all and we never need another
[59:11] sacrifice because the life of our
[59:14] sacrifice came back upon the believer
[59:18] that's the change that's happened in you
[59:20] when you receive the Holy Ghost it was
[59:23] the very life of God
[59:26] that is in you
[59:29] [Applause]
[59:31] now and you trying to look at
[59:35] yourself to see the very life of God
[59:38] that's in you to try to see the Holy
[59:41] Ghost the Holy Spirit that's in you
[59:43] you're looking through a glass Darkly
[59:46] that is so good yes sir that is so good
[59:50] Hallelujah you're you're seeing you're
[59:52] seeing it but it's still an obscure
[59:55] thing
[59:58] no matter how much you can see the
[1:00:00] revelation of it in the word no matter
[1:00:02] how much you can see the revelation of
[1:00:04] the message it's still an obscure thing
[1:00:08] because it's not act this body is not
[1:00:11] the reality of it
[1:00:14] yet you're you're only one part of your
[1:00:18] being you're a Triune being only one
[1:00:21] part of your being is the reality of it
[1:00:25] and that's your soul
[1:00:31] Hallelujah brother Venom says this in
[1:00:34] the latest sin Church age he says uh
[1:00:38] whom we having not seen we ye uh ye love
[1:00:43] in whom though now you see him not yet
[1:00:46] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:00:47] unspeakable and full of Glory he said we
[1:00:51] haven't seen him but we have felt him we
[1:00:54] know him as much much as our limited
[1:00:57] senses can let
[1:00:59] us but one day it will be face to
[1:01:06] face
[1:01:07] Hallelujah and he said he says he's
[1:01:11] coming at the end of the age he says we
[1:01:14] are in partial realization but that
[1:01:17] partial realization will be made perfect
[1:01:20] realization complete realization
[1:01:23] Hallelujah we have been looking through
[1:01:25] through a glass Darkly but soon we shall
[1:01:29] be face to face for we shall be like him
[1:01:33] wonderously like
[1:01:38] him he said we are complet in him that's
[1:01:41] true he would not lie about that but one
[1:01:44] day we will be changed in the
[1:01:49] atoms we will put on
[1:01:52] immortality we will be swallowed up in
[1:01:55] life Hallelujah then will we realize
[1:01:59] realization amen
[1:02:02] hallelujah
[1:02:05] hallelujah glory to God he is the
[1:02:09] faithful and true witness brother Bram
[1:02:11] says that's good he said some he said
[1:02:15] some uh Believers and and and Christians
[1:02:18] and people in that he says they believe
[1:02:20] that that God he he created man and then
[1:02:23] after created him became such a
[1:02:26] impersonal God that he just kind of
[1:02:28] stood back and just let happen whatever
[1:02:31] was going to happen to man and that he
[1:02:33] just folded his arms brother random said
[1:02:36] and and stood back it was uh if we were
[1:02:40] uh as if we majored in believing in a
[1:02:42] great Creator who having created lost
[1:02:45] all personal interest in his creation
[1:02:48] that is beautiful he said now I that
[1:02:51] that is how many people are apt to think
[1:02:53] but that is the wrong thinking for where
[1:02:56] God is governing the Affairs of men
[1:02:58] right now he is both Creator and
[1:03:03] sustainer sir and then brother renam
[1:03:06] goes right in to to
[1:03:08] Colossians uh one and he says for by him
[1:03:12] were all things created that are in
[1:03:14] heaven and that are on earth visible and
[1:03:16] invisible right whether they be Thrones
[1:03:18] or dominions or principalities of powers
[1:03:20] all things are created by Him and for
[1:03:23] him and he is before all things and by
[1:03:26] him all things consist he says the he
[1:03:30] says he is a sovereign God by his own
[1:03:34] counsel he purposed The Plan of
[1:03:36] Salvation of his own elect which he
[1:03:39] fornew the son died upon the cross to
[1:03:42] establish a means of Salvation and the
[1:03:44] Holy Spirit carefully executed the will
[1:03:47] of the father he was working all things
[1:03:50] at this moment according to the purpose
[1:03:52] of his own will he is right in the midst
[1:03:55] of it all he's in the midst of his
[1:03:56] church this great Creator savior God is
[1:03:59] Faithfully working amongst his people
[1:04:01] right now as the great Shepherd of the
[1:04:03] sheep right amen hallelujah he said he
[1:04:07] is true to us amen he will lose none of
[1:04:13] us but rais us up at the last day I'm
[1:04:17] glad that I'm resting on his
[1:04:18] faithfulness and then he quotes being
[1:04:21] confident of this very thing that he
[1:04:24] which had begun a good work in you will
[1:04:27] perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:04:35] Christ how do I know that I I that I am
[1:04:39] going to have that perfect realization
[1:04:42] be that perfect realization of the
[1:04:44] revelation of God in a child of
[1:04:47] God first of all I I've got the title
[1:04:51] deed
[1:04:53] right hallu I I I I've received this the
[1:04:58] the spirit right hallelujah amen I've
[1:05:03] got the proof it's the
[1:05:05] spirit amen next it's because he is the
[1:05:10] word and he said that this work that he
[1:05:14] started in me he will finish it
[1:05:19] hallelu so it's not on me and you
[1:05:26] we
[1:05:27] believed and friends the reason you
[1:05:29] believed and accepted it is because
[1:05:31] brother R says he brought about
[1:05:33] salvation for his elect that's
[1:05:38] right you know people say you know God's
[1:05:42] a god of love God is love the Bible says
[1:05:45] they say oh Jesus he just loves
[1:05:49] everybody it says for God so loved the
[1:05:52] world he gave his only begotten son
[1:05:58] friends I want to tell you something God
[1:06:01] loves his own but to be
[1:06:05] just to be just he had to make a
[1:06:08] provision that for anybody that would
[1:06:10] accept it would have the opportunity
[1:06:13] otherwise friends he couldn't be just
[1:06:16] and actually bring to judgment those
[1:06:19] that wouldn't accept unless everybody
[1:06:21] had the opportunity
[1:06:24] right but look friends when when God so
[1:06:27] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:06:29] begotten son it the Bible tells us it's
[1:06:32] like a treasure that was that that when
[1:06:35] they found this treasure they hid it in
[1:06:37] a field and then in order to obtain the
[1:06:40] treasure they went out and purchased the
[1:06:43] entire
[1:06:46] field that's what God given his only son
[1:06:50] for for for the Salvation offered to the
[1:06:54] entire world he purchased it for
[1:06:58] everyone but he did it because he wanted
[1:07:01] you were the treasure in the world or in
[1:07:04] the
[1:07:06] [Music]
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:11] field when you look at that uh passage
[1:07:14] in in the Bible that I just referred to
[1:07:17] about the treasure in the field it goes
[1:07:19] on Jesus is given these Parables and it
[1:07:21] and and it goes on to say the gospel is
[1:07:24] like a great net that is cast out and
[1:07:28] when the net is pulled in it brings in
[1:07:31] all manner of creatures that are pulled
[1:07:34] in with this gospel net brother Brandon
[1:07:37] when he preached on it he said you know
[1:07:39] it that gospel net he said it'll pull in
[1:07:42] Turtles it'll pull in snakes it it'll
[1:07:44] pull in all these other things and that
[1:07:46] you know mud puppies and everything else
[1:07:49] he said but that's not what God's
[1:07:50] casting the net for what God's casting
[1:07:53] the net for is his elect SE
[1:07:56] the
[1:07:57] [Applause]
[1:08:00] fish remember Jesus saying follow me
[1:08:03] I'll make you Fishers of
[1:08:06] Men brother R said don't worry about
[1:08:09] them
[1:08:09] Turtles don't worry about them snakes he
[1:08:12] said they'll crawl out of the boat or
[1:08:14] the church and they'll go right back out
[1:08:19] there that's what Jesus given his
[1:08:21] Parable but the gospel net was saying
[1:08:23] look he cast The Gospel net out yes but
[1:08:26] really what he was going for was his
[1:08:29] elect because he knows they are the only
[1:08:32] ones that will believe it accept it amen
[1:08:36] and they're the only ones that are
[1:08:43] redeemable look friends he he he speaks
[1:08:46] to the the priests and and and the the
[1:08:49] the Jewish uh religious men of that day
[1:08:52] Jesus
[1:08:54] did they they called him
[1:08:57] belah the very one that they would read
[1:08:59] the prophecies and and read those
[1:09:01] prophecies and those prophecies poting
[1:09:03] to him and the Fulfillment the perfect
[1:09:05] realization of those prophecies they
[1:09:07] looked at it and couldn't see
[1:09:10] it that's
[1:09:13] right brother Ram said you know why he
[1:09:16] said because they didn't have any
[1:09:19] representation he said their
[1:09:21] representation was not over there in
[1:09:23] heaven no he said but the difference of
[1:09:26] the woman at the well who in this life
[1:09:29] her reflection of of humanity in this
[1:09:33] life she was an ill famed
[1:09:37] woman she was married and divorced and
[1:09:39] married and divorced and married and
[1:09:41] divorced and from man to man and Jesus
[1:09:43] says and the man you're with now you're
[1:09:45] not even married to
[1:09:47] him so the her reflection when she came
[1:09:51] to the well was was a was not a
[1:09:54] reflection
[1:09:56] C of of of anything
[1:10:04] perfect but brother Ram said what was
[1:10:06] the difference between her and the
[1:10:08] priest at the temple that called Jesus
[1:10:09] bsub said she had representation over
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:14] there and that's why her living as a as
[1:10:19] the Bible says an ill famed woman
[1:10:25] that she could look and
[1:10:28] say I believe you're the
[1:10:32] Messiah that's
[1:10:36] right she didn't have she didn't have
[1:10:38] all the teaching and and education and
[1:10:41] everything that the priest down at the
[1:10:43] temple
[1:10:50] had no doubt she might not have even
[1:10:52] been able to actually if she'd had got a
[1:10:54] hold of old testament's roles she might
[1:10:57] not even been able to actually read
[1:11:00] them so when she she was quoting it to
[1:11:03] to Jesus she says our fathers say right
[1:11:08] right that we
[1:11:10] shall that that uh it says the Jews say
[1:11:14] you should Worship in Jerusalem she said
[1:11:16] our father said we should Worship in the
[1:11:18] mountain what do you
[1:11:23] say Jesus looking there and say okay
[1:11:25] look that was a partial realization the
[1:11:28] the temple the mountain was a partial
[1:11:31] realization he said the day is coming
[1:11:34] and now is when you shall worship Him in
[1:11:38] spirit and in
[1:11:40] truth there that word truth is again
[1:11:43] you're going to worship Him in complete
[1:11:47] realization perfect
[1:11:50] [Music]
[1:11:51] realization hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:54] hallelujah
[1:11:56] praise the
[1:11:58] Lord First John 3 John writes he says
[1:12:03] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[1:12:07] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[1:12:10] right but we know that when he shall
[1:12:13] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:12:16] see him as he
[1:12:21] is amen it does not yet appear That's
[1:12:24] why we're we're looking it's like us
[1:12:27] looking into a a mirror and we're seeing
[1:12:30] an obscure
[1:12:32] reflection
[1:12:34] right a glass
[1:12:36] Darkly an
[1:12:38] obscure reflection of who we really
[1:12:45] are but one day the Bible says for we
[1:12:49] know that when this Earthly House of
[1:12:52] this
[1:12:53] Tabernacle and the Earthly house this
[1:12:55] Tabernacle that is the Obscure
[1:12:58] reflection of who we really
[1:13:01] are when this this obscure reflection is
[1:13:04] dissolved praise God we have a
[1:13:08] building an house not made with hands
[1:13:12] Eternal in the heavens
[1:13:15] right so how do you know that you have
[1:13:18] that
[1:13:19] there you know that's one of the things
[1:13:22] that I don't know uh you know my parents
[1:13:24] you know they can't came into the
[1:13:25] revelation of this message when I was
[1:13:27] just a real young boy I mean I can
[1:13:29] remember before we came into it but I I
[1:13:32] was just a young boy and and that and
[1:13:35] and and and things but as I begin to
[1:13:38] grow older and that you know and you've
[1:13:39] got to have an experience everybody's
[1:13:41] got to have an experience for himself
[1:13:42] don't matter who your daddy and mommy
[1:13:46] is and as I begin to come older you know
[1:13:50] Satan could never convince me this
[1:13:52] message wasn't true I I I got a re ation
[1:13:55] of that when I was a child this is
[1:13:58] true but you know what he was always
[1:14:00] trying to convince me but you not one of
[1:14:04] them Satan never tried to convince me
[1:14:07] there's not going to be a
[1:14:09] Rapture he never tried to convince me
[1:14:12] that that that Jesus wasn't coming again
[1:14:14] he never tried to convince me there
[1:14:16] wasn't going to be a marriage supper of
[1:14:17] the Lamb Satan didn't try to convince me
[1:14:20] that the message wasn't true he just
[1:14:22] always tried to convince me that I
[1:14:24] wasn't part
[1:14:27] that I wasn't one of them as the song
[1:14:32] says and and what he would do is even
[1:14:35] coming up as an older you know teenager
[1:14:38] and that I I would look at I would look
[1:14:41] at desires I would look at the The
[1:14:43] Faults of My Flesh I would look at all
[1:14:45] of my
[1:14:50] mistakes I and I I would at different
[1:14:53] times CU friend look I I wasn't always
[1:14:56] growing up and that I wasn't always
[1:14:57] under my dad's Ministry there was times
[1:15:00] I was other places in that and but
[1:15:02] coming up and hearing different
[1:15:03] preachers camp meetings and places I
[1:15:05] attended and different things like that
[1:15:07] I I I begin to get this the what I need
[1:15:10] to do is I need to get the Holy
[1:15:14] Ghost but I had this idea if I get the
[1:15:16] Holy Ghost that's going to make me
[1:15:18] perfect I won't I won't I won't be
[1:15:21] bothered by these things anymore I won't
[1:15:24] make mistakes
[1:15:27] anymore and and I would look at at other
[1:15:30] men in that and I I would see them and
[1:15:32] the way they projected themselves they
[1:15:34] kind of projected themselves that they
[1:15:35] were perfect and I was like I I I'll
[1:15:39] never make that I'll never be like
[1:15:42] them and I would say look uh I would
[1:15:44] look in the Bible and I would see where
[1:15:46] it said Jesus was tempted in every way
[1:15:49] such as knowing to man
[1:15:51] yes and sometimes when I would make that
[1:15:54] expression and say that whoever I was
[1:15:56] making the expression to would say yes
[1:15:58] but without sin and man that would just
[1:16:00] beat me back down
[1:16:02] again because I was looking at and
[1:16:05] saying look Jesus knows what I'm going
[1:16:06] through yeah but then I was getting beat
[1:16:08] back down about that yeah but you know
[1:16:11] you're not one of them because he done
[1:16:12] it without sin you ain't never going to
[1:16:13] be able to do that but then you look in
[1:16:16] the word and the word tells you that's
[1:16:18] true you're
[1:16:23] not is that I read to you last Sunday
[1:16:25] John said If any man says they don't
[1:16:27] have sin they're a
[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:34] liar look we were freed from the desire
[1:16:37] of sin the real you the one you cannot
[1:16:40] see in this reflection is free of
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:46] sin but we're still Shackled by this
[1:16:49] body we're still Shackled by this
[1:16:52] Humanity this veil of humanity yeah yeah
[1:16:58] amen and and and Paul writes and lets us
[1:17:01] know look what that means is the real
[1:17:03] you on the inside has got to die to this
[1:17:06] flesh every day you got to crucify the
[1:17:10] flesh Paul
[1:17:15] says
[1:17:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:17:21] amen so but there's coming a Time
[1:17:25] that the Bible tells me that I'm going
[1:17:28] to become not just an obscure reflection
[1:17:32] of what's took place in here but this
[1:17:35] outside these other two uh uh uh Realms
[1:17:38] of my
[1:17:40] being you're a Triune being remember
[1:17:43] brother said that right so the other two
[1:17:46] parts of that Triune being that makes up
[1:17:49] you is going to finally come up and
[1:17:51] match what's the real you that's on the
[1:17:53] inside
[1:17:56] hallah
[1:17:58] Hallelujah he says Earnest he says we
[1:18:01] grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed
[1:18:03] upon with our house which is from
[1:18:06] Heaven remember what I said about the
[1:18:08] woman at the well the priest of the
[1:18:09] temple she had representation over there
[1:18:11] he he didn't brother B actually says in
[1:18:13] another place he says you know people
[1:18:15] say well my god of love surely he
[1:18:18] wouldn't destroy his children and and
[1:18:21] brother Ram says you don't understand
[1:18:22] the love of God you don't even know what
[1:18:24] love is he says you are correct God will
[1:18:27] not destroy his
[1:18:30] children he said but Satan will destroy
[1:18:33] his
[1:18:37] children that's so good and then brother
[1:18:40] BR it's a man that he's talking to I
[1:18:42] think it was a Jehovah Witness something
[1:18:43] but anyway brother bam says whose child
[1:18:46] are
[1:18:49] you Hallelujah whose child are you
[1:18:55] true God's not going to destroy his
[1:18:57] children he came and made a way for his
[1:18:59] children but whose child are you and
[1:19:03] then brother renham says look what what
[1:19:05] what you are is actually a reflection of
[1:19:09] who you are there in in some other
[1:19:13] realm your life he said is actually a
[1:19:16] reflection of what you are in some other
[1:19:20] realm he says if it's from the realm of
[1:19:23] there then you in you
[1:19:25] in your life is a reflection that of
[1:19:28] that real you that's there he said but
[1:19:32] if the life in the individual is a
[1:19:35] reflection of of what they really are
[1:19:38] and it's from down
[1:19:40] there he saids and that shows whose
[1:19:43] child you are
[1:19:45] right and then I'll take you back to the
[1:19:48] quote that we refer to so often when
[1:19:50] brother Ram talking about that
[1:19:52] representation that the woman at the
[1:19:53] well had and that and he says when you
[1:19:56] heard this end time truth
[1:20:00] amen and accepted it to be true and
[1:20:03] believed it he said you heard from your
[1:20:07] theophany or your representation or your
[1:20:11] house that is from the heavens that you
[1:20:14] are going to be clothed
[1:20:17] withl when this reflection this obscure
[1:20:21] reflection is is dissolved the Bible
[1:20:27] says if so being clothed Paul said we
[1:20:30] shall not be found naked right look
[1:20:34] friends right now we look at our
[1:20:36] Humanity here and and you know and and
[1:20:40] we there's times look we actually begin
[1:20:42] to feel like Adam and Eve felt in the
[1:20:44] garden when they they you know when they
[1:20:46] had
[1:20:47] sinned I'm
[1:20:52] naked Hallelujah but what we're not
[1:20:55] naked we are clothed with his word we
[1:20:59] are clothed with his spirit and one day
[1:21:02] you know we stand here we we're not
[1:21:05] going to be standing in this
[1:21:07] body but we be standing in the perfect
[1:21:10] realization that new body Hallelujah and
[1:21:13] Paul says for not that we would be
[1:21:17] unclothed but clothed upon that
[1:21:19] immortality would be swallowed up of
[1:21:21] Life Paul says again now I say Brethren
[1:21:25] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[1:21:27] kingdom of God neither doth corruption
[1:21:30] inherit incorruption but I show you a
[1:21:32] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[1:21:35] shall all be changed amen the dead shall
[1:21:38] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:21:41] changed corruptible must put on
[1:21:43] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:21:46] immortality corruption shall be shall
[1:21:49] have put on incorruption and this
[1:21:51] mortality shall have put on immortality
[1:21:54] then shall uh be brought to Pastor
[1:21:56] saying that death is swallowed up in
[1:22:01] Victory your Humanity that you live in
[1:22:04] today is actually a reflection of
[1:22:08] death true that's why it's I'm telling
[1:22:11] you it's not a reflection of who you
[1:22:13] really are
[1:22:16] hallelujah hallelujah but one day amen
[1:22:20] that that death is going to be swallowed
[1:22:23] up in the victory that Jesus Christ
[1:22:25] bought and paid for
[1:22:30] Hallelujah friends I'll tell you what
[1:22:33] when when when it when I did get the
[1:22:36] Holy Ghost and it was revealed to me
[1:22:39] that look that it was my soul the real
[1:22:42] me that got it not my
[1:22:47] flesh
[1:22:48] Hallelujah and and and it was so plain
[1:22:51] in the
[1:22:52] word that it it never said when you got
[1:22:55] the Holy Ghost in here that all of a
[1:22:57] sudden your flesh was going to become
[1:22:58] perfect right it didn't say you were
[1:23:01] going to become you were never going to
[1:23:02] make mistakes you were never going to
[1:23:04] have failures you were never going to
[1:23:06] commit sin
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:11] amen as Paul writes in Ephesians 4 said
[1:23:15] you know we've been sealed by the Holy
[1:23:18] Spirit of Promise says grieve not the
[1:23:19] spirit of God whereby you've been sealed
[1:23:21] right putting off from you all malice
[1:23:24] and strive and envy and and clamoring
[1:23:27] and and and and evil speaking
[1:23:29] and right meaning you got the Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost but what helps you to crucify this
[1:23:38] flesh daily yeah it's because there's
[1:23:41] been a change Happening Here you've got
[1:23:43] the Holy
[1:23:44] Ghost so brother R says the man down in
[1:23:47] the engine room runs the
[1:23:51] ship amen friends thank God it ain't the
[1:23:55] man up here running the
[1:23:57] ship cuz this man gets all messed up
[1:24:02] sometimes but it's a man down in here
[1:24:04] that's running the ship am sometimes a
[1:24:07] man up here Satan he's got an inroad
[1:24:09] there greatest battle ever fought he
[1:24:11] chose the
[1:24:13] [Music]
[1:24:14] Mind Satan tries to convince you of this
[1:24:17] convince you of that and all that you
[1:24:18] know but the man down here says nope
[1:24:20] that's not
[1:24:21] true that is actually not the true refle
[1:24:24] ction of who I am that's
[1:24:27] right Glory Hallelujah my coming to
[1:24:30] church my reading my Bible my listening
[1:24:33] to the messages and things that's
[1:24:35] actually still just a partial
[1:24:37] realization of who I
[1:24:40] am the perfect realization is that it's
[1:24:44] not just me hearing the words it is I am
[1:24:46] the
[1:24:47] [Music]
[1:24:48] [Applause]
[1:24:50] word I and my father are one
[1:24:54] [Applause]
[1:24:57] Hall Jesus praying says that that he
[1:25:01] says that they as you as I and you are
[1:25:05] one father that that they will be one
[1:25:08] like me and you are with USU
[1:25:12] hallelujah
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:16] hallelujah Lord 2 Corinthians
[1:25:21] 3 Paul writes but we all with open face
[1:25:26] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:25:30] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:25:34] from glory to glory even as by the
[1:25:37] spirit of the
[1:25:40] Lord amen God so we we are we are like
[1:25:44] beholding it Paul says within a glass
[1:25:47] right and he says we're being changed
[1:25:49] from glory to glory amen so there's been
[1:25:53] there's been a change that's happened in
[1:25:56] you but you're not perfect yet you're
[1:25:59] not the perfect
[1:26:00] realization of the revelation of Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ in his bride
[1:26:08] yet you're a partial realization of it
[1:26:11] right now living in this
[1:26:13] life but so we're being changed from
[1:26:15] glory to glory but brother bam says he
[1:26:18] says listen to what he says partial
[1:26:20] reality will become perfect realization
[1:26:23] complete realization we have been
[1:26:25] looking through a glass Darkly but soon
[1:26:27] it shall be face to face we have been
[1:26:30] going from glory to glory but soon it
[1:26:34] will be right in the
[1:26:36] glory and this and and His glory we will
[1:26:40] shine and we shall be like
[1:26:45] him brother
[1:26:47] says he says in that same meage he says
[1:26:51] one day going from perfect from uh uh
[1:26:54] partial realization to perfect
[1:26:56] realization one day we will be changed
[1:27:00] in the
[1:27:04] atoms so this Humanity that we see
[1:27:07] ourselves in today how did that come to
[1:27:10] be well I I take you back to Genesis
[1:27:14] when when man uh disbelieved God's
[1:27:18] word and sinned and death entered in
[1:27:22] right
[1:27:25] there was a when God spoke to him said
[1:27:28] in the day that don't eat of the tree
[1:27:30] you can eat of every tree the fruit of
[1:27:31] the fruit of the Trees of the garden
[1:27:33] except the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:27:34] Evil for in the day you eat thereof that
[1:27:36] day you shall
[1:27:38] die so their their molecular structure
[1:27:42] of the atoms of the body that God
[1:27:45] created for Adam there in the
[1:27:47] garden couldn't
[1:27:51] die it was created in a perfect
[1:27:58] realization but something happened to it
[1:28:02] when he sinned right right God told him
[1:28:06] when if you do that something's going to
[1:28:08] happen and from then you're going to die
[1:28:11] right right so something happened to
[1:28:13] man's
[1:28:14] body and then he began to die from that
[1:28:17] day forward yeah as as as as we look at
[1:28:21] the realization or or revelation of this
[1:28:24] you know Peter says one day with the
[1:28:26] Lord is as a thousand
[1:28:29] years God said in the day you Eater of
[1:28:32] that day you will
[1:28:35] die you look in the Bible muusa lived to
[1:28:38] be the longest of any human being
[1:28:41] ever 900 and some years old he didn't
[1:28:44] quite make it to a
[1:28:46] thousand he didn't make it to one
[1:28:49] complete day in the eyes of God
[1:28:54] no one has lived a complete day in the
[1:28:58] Lord since the
[1:29:06] fall but that's why we're promised that
[1:29:10] we're going to after the marriage supper
[1:29:13] we're coming back down here and we're
[1:29:15] going to have a a time of a millennium
[1:29:18] and and the time period of that
[1:29:19] Millennium is specific by the scriptures
[1:29:22] to be a thousand years years or one
[1:29:27] day
[1:29:29] Hall and
[1:29:30] see Satan is not destroyed at that
[1:29:34] time because God wants him there to
[1:29:36] witness that man can live perfect
[1:29:39] without
[1:29:41] sin for one entire day in
[1:29:50] God and what's going to prove that to
[1:29:52] the devil he can't have any effect on US
[1:29:55] during that day why can't he have an
[1:29:57] effect on us because today he can have
[1:30:00] an effect on you because you're in your
[1:30:02] human spirit in this flesh body
[1:30:05] right you get sick in your body yes
[1:30:10] brother B talks about the gates of the
[1:30:11] spirit how Satan comes and if if you let
[1:30:13] him with your thoughts and all these
[1:30:15] things he he'll kind of try to clog up
[1:30:17] those channels so that so the word of
[1:30:19] God that you're hearing that to get
[1:30:21] Faith get gets caught and blocked off in
[1:30:25] those channels
[1:30:29] right but in the time of the Millennium
[1:30:32] hallelujah we're going to be living in
[1:30:35] the perfect
[1:30:37] realization look
[1:30:40] man's molecular structure the structure
[1:30:43] of his atams it was changed that's why
[1:30:45] he died right to give you a further
[1:30:48] Testament of
[1:30:50] this when God cursed the serpent
[1:30:54] he said cursed you're going to be from
[1:30:57] this day forward on your belly you're
[1:30:59] going to
[1:31:01] craw thust shall be your meat all the
[1:31:03] days of your
[1:31:05] life you're going to be crawling around
[1:31:07] in dust now and he says and I'm going to
[1:31:10] put enity I'm going to I'm going to put
[1:31:12] an enity where your seed can no longer
[1:31:15] mingle with the seed of the
[1:31:19] woman I'm going to put a separation
[1:31:22] there
[1:31:28] Hallelujah and so what happened to the
[1:31:32] serpant right then when he was cursed I
[1:31:35] can see it now right there in the
[1:31:39] garden a transformation a body change
[1:31:43] happened the structure of his atoms
[1:31:46] began to change right there before their
[1:31:49] eyes and he went from being a a being
[1:31:52] that was the most subtle beast of the
[1:31:54] field that walked upright like a man to
[1:31:57] being what we look at that resembles a
[1:31:59] snake to us
[1:32:02] today amen it changed the molecular
[1:32:06] structure of the Serpent's body
[1:32:09] right and because man's molecular
[1:32:12] structure was
[1:32:15] changed look when Adam was created he
[1:32:18] didn't need a
[1:32:21] Healer right
[1:32:25] when Adam was created he didn't need a
[1:32:28] savior he wasn't
[1:32:31] lost God didn't create his child lost
[1:32:34] right
[1:32:37] amen
[1:32:39] hallelujah but when he sinned then he
[1:32:42] needed a savior then he needed a
[1:32:46] Healer then he needed a sacrifice then
[1:32:49] he needed he needed someone to come that
[1:32:52] could actually have one hand on God and
[1:32:55] one hand on Mankind and bridge the gap
[1:32:59] between the humanity of man in his
[1:33:02] Fallen State and the perfect God Amen so
[1:33:07] so the perfect realization of God came
[1:33:10] down and touched
[1:33:13] Humanity thank you became
[1:33:16] us and by becoming us was actually able
[1:33:19] to take our place and provide a way back
[1:33:23] to life for
[1:33:25] us
[1:33:30] hallelujah one
[1:33:32] day M says we're beholden in the glass
[1:33:35] Darkly now he says we're being changed
[1:33:38] from glory to glory but one day we're
[1:33:40] actually going to be in the glory we're
[1:33:43] going to be become the Glory Hallelujah
[1:33:46] we're going to be like him he says our
[1:33:49] atoms are going to be changed
[1:33:55] friends when when you think say what
[1:33:58] happens when we receive the body change
[1:34:00] brother Jerry what just the reverse of
[1:34:02] what happened to Adam in the Garden of
[1:34:04] Eden when he
[1:34:05] sinned
[1:34:07] prise it's still going to be you know
[1:34:09] brother man says our bodies are made up
[1:34:11] out of 16
[1:34:12] elements your glorified body will be
[1:34:15] made up out of the same 16 elements this
[1:34:18] body's made up by
[1:34:24] the difference is going to be it's going
[1:34:26] to be a redeemed 16 elements look
[1:34:30] friends the price for the Redemption of
[1:34:32] the Earth's already been paid
[1:34:34] right now what's happening in our souls
[1:34:37] is a reflection we are
[1:34:43] redeemed but our bodies in this earth
[1:34:47] which the price for the Redemption of
[1:34:48] all that was also paid is not a
[1:34:50] reflection of that Redemption right now
[1:34:52] right
[1:34:55] am right within the Redemption friends
[1:34:59] it was for you to live forever never
[1:35:02] grow old
[1:35:04] right never you know be in a body that
[1:35:07] was never sick that never grew old that
[1:35:11] could not
[1:35:15] die Paul Paul says when when when we
[1:35:20] come to that complete Redemption he says
[1:35:22] to Wi the body change yeah
[1:35:27] yeah Jesus blood wasn't just shed just
[1:35:30] for us and our
[1:35:33] Redemption but his blood dropped on the
[1:35:35] earth to redeem the Earth which was
[1:35:37] which is where our 16 elements come from
[1:35:41] to make a Redemption for your body to
[1:35:43] pay the price that that you would have a
[1:35:46] body change yes sir
[1:35:50] [Music]
[1:35:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:54] oh my one day friends Hallelujah the
[1:35:57] dead in Christ are going to
[1:36:00] arise amen let let me tell you
[1:36:05] this we know according to the scriptures
[1:36:09] when a Believer dies from this
[1:36:12] life that there's a body waiting on
[1:36:15] them a theophany right and they go to
[1:36:19] that
[1:36:20] theophany and and there they live what
[1:36:24] we refer to so much about beyond the
[1:36:26] curtain of time in that Dimension yeah
[1:36:30] of of the
[1:36:32] saved but brother Ram says they don't in
[1:36:34] that theophany body they don't eat they
[1:36:37] don't
[1:36:41] sleep so how in a world if we were in a
[1:36:44] body just like that stuck just in that
[1:36:46] body as glorious as we make it to be how
[1:36:49] in a world could we enjoy the marriage
[1:36:51] supper of the Lamb
[1:36:54] amen see here's what I'm pointing at
[1:36:57] friends look when a Believer dies and
[1:37:00] leaves here and goes into the theophany
[1:37:02] there's still not the perfect
[1:37:03] realization of it
[1:37:06] yet it's still a partial realization it
[1:37:09] is it is not
[1:37:11] complete realization
[1:37:15] yet and that's why the scripture says
[1:37:18] they without us are not made perfect
[1:37:21] right brother says look those that are
[1:37:24] there in the theophany beyond the
[1:37:25] curtain of time said they got to come
[1:37:27] back here and pick up a glorified body
[1:37:31] what does that mean they got to come
[1:37:33] back here and be clothed upon with with
[1:37:36] with the 16 elements the redeemed 16
[1:37:40] elements of this
[1:37:44] Earth and then we're
[1:37:46] changed we we step into off the ovy and
[1:37:50] our changed but it's not us dropping
[1:37:53] this flesh and looking down and saying
[1:37:55] well that's my old flesh look at here I
[1:37:56] got another body NOP it changes the
[1:37:59] moleular structure of the flesh you're
[1:38:01] in it goes from being old to being young
[1:38:03] again
[1:38:05] Hallelujah your hair comes back and
[1:38:09] [Applause]
[1:38:13] everything I'm not going to look like
[1:38:15] this 62y old Jerry Browning again
[1:38:18] brother R says I'm going to go back to
[1:38:20] looking like the fella that none of
[1:38:22] y'all can see that this fell is not a
[1:38:24] reflection of that looks nothing like
[1:38:26] that
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:29] guy you said about the but around the
[1:38:32] age when you're like 20 years
[1:38:35] old
[1:38:37] hallelujah praise the
[1:38:39] Lord
[1:38:42] amen but friends you know you know what
[1:38:44] is you know we talk so much about we'll
[1:38:46] we'll never die then we'll be in a body
[1:38:48] that won't die we we we we'll you know
[1:38:51] we won't get sick anymore and all those
[1:38:52] things are one wondrous and
[1:38:54] glorious you know what the most
[1:38:56] wonderful thing to me about it is it's
[1:38:58] not just going back to being young it's
[1:39:00] not getting rid of all the aches and
[1:39:02] pains of this flesh body the sicknesses
[1:39:05] and the ailments and the and and all
[1:39:07] those things it's not just
[1:39:11] that you said finally every part of me
[1:39:14] is going to match what's happened to the
[1:39:16] real me in here amen that's right
[1:39:20] amen it's going to be able to be to be
