this morning main Lord the man part just step aside and may you step in Lord take control Lord we ask for all of these things for the glory of God in the name of Jesus amen amen god bless you well if you turn in your Bibles to first John chapter 2 computer is down back there so we just wouldn't ask you just to turn Bibles first John chapter 2 I want to also to make mention the post went out on Facebook there last night we were not able to get an email out but perhaps every one of you have when you pulled in this morning you saw the playground so just in case you didn't know for grown-ups the playgrounds not for you even if your height would allow you to be on it but we I want to say first of all I want to thank brother Richie getting all that together I was quite shocked when I come out of the woods early one morning and come out and after why I went early when I came out of the woods but it was later on in that morning and I looked over there and they were actually putting it all together and brother Richie asked me to make known to you that it is available for the children to be able to play on it today so children and that includes Zachary don't don't be you know if I say just give me a few more moments don't be you know say come on I got to get out on that playground but it is available for you to be out there I think for let me finish this as as the kids when you're when you're going out there there's a little walkway that's over here that'll take you out there because it is a muddy mess all around there too to walk you don't want to get off of that little pathway that goes up to it because it's a mess that that mud you'll you'll sink right down in it all the way around it if you get on there to play stay right in the mulch area and then there's two walkways that come off of there so you just want to stay on those walkways so all the all the kiddies all the kids say a man okay I got one a man get another Amen they got a smiles over here what's will take the smiles but we think it's one of the things that I know that brother Richie is really carried that burden for some time and I thought back you know one of the one of the things that brother Richie had mentioned is so that where the kids would get kind of a focus of probably where they're gonna be so we're not running behind the building and so that we're not running up and down in the parking lot between cars and things like that as well so we just want to make that known to you we're very thankful for that I'm really really thankful for that I think that'll be a great blessing so let's just go on into the word now everybody happy in the Lord Hey well first John chapter 2 verse 1 my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world amen so we just want to ask the Lord to bless the word you may have your seats and god bless you as you're being seated and so good to have each and every one of you you're with us see some visitors there sister Chris oh god bless you and some other visitors god bless you as well welcome we want I want to look at this a little bit more here this morning on the advocate of the believer I don't have time to go back and and pull up in review but some things will undoubtedly the Holy Spirit will just tie together things that he was ministering to our hearts even last Sunday but to take into account this word of advocate that John would write here where he would say that would write unto us that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous this word advocate it's the same it's the same exact word that is used when the Lord Jesus would would express that he was going away and he said if I if I go away and he says I I will not leave you comfortless he said but I will I will send the comforter unto you and that's the same word as comforter one who is who is who who has there to minister to our hearts personally the the pardoning of our sins and when we we recognize within this hour we we when we read the scripture and I trust the Holy Spirit word just through the eyes of man we do not fully gather the victory that God has for us but God provides for us by His grace that we might truly be able to look into his word not through the eyes of a man but through God's own eyes and to be able to see the redemptive work of what God has already done for us we see that in every age when we look in the beginning of revelations chapter one of how that in every that God will send one to every age and that one is anointed with a Spirit of God they come to make known to the Church of the Living God of exactly what Jesus Christ has done personally for them as the believer it's a minister the rights that belonged to us as the believer I I love the scripture you know I many things I just almost can't get around it I you know without wanting to just preach all again the pardoning grace of Almighty God but that that's the thing that you'll see today is the is the real part and you know you think about a man who at one time you know the example of where the individual was they ran in the time of war and here they were as a soldier during that time in the Civil War and here was the friend of the man who had run and remember he was going to be killed he was guilty of what he did that was against the law but there was one who knew his friend was in trouble and he went to President Lincoln and he began to plead for his life he began to plead for his life and we we know how the account would go that President Lincoln would actually take just a simple piece of paper and he would write on that paper that the man is pardoned he would write the man is pardoned and he would sign his signature Abraham Lincoln on that paper now the one who went there would actually take that particular message that had the actual pardon within it and that pardon would come right back to that man who was in that cell he was he was guilty he was going to be shot before a firing squad but yet there was one who was coming with a message from the very one who could pardon him and he came with a message to him that you have been pardoned but remember the the account goals that that the the individual he he rejected and in a manner of saying you're only mocking me he was looking at the guilt of which he was ensnared in and and all of this but to understand what he failed to realize is that there was one that was there in his cell that had been in the presence of one who could pardon him and he brought with him you see it would be one thing if he was just coming with a word but he came with a message that was directly from the president when that man could not get there there was one who brought that message personally to him and then we know that the account the man end up dying before a firing squad because he refused to accept the pardon that was issued to him and when they tried it in the court of law they the the Supreme Court made the declaration that a pardon is not a pardon unless it is received and accepted as a party and I want to say this very clearly this morning that the reality of the pardoning power of the Lord Jesus Christ that comes to you and I personally as a believer does not leave a son and daughter of God in bondage or the defilement of sin because the pardoning power we're talking about is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not human blood Paul would call it the blood of Christ the blood of the Lord the blood of God all the way through the Scriptures because there was no blood that was here present that could take care of the sin question to pay the debt and then release that life back into the worshiper when that comes when that pardoning grace is is is received by the worshiper and the blood has been applied then it is no longer there the life of that believer or the life that previous life that's on display but now they are safely under the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and it is no longer the person who was but now we are a new creation a new creature in Christ Jesus by the redeeming cleansing pardoning power of the blood of the Lamb you see there was a case that was against us for every person the small it didn't matter if it's church member or whoever they are without of receiving the pardoning gain the grace of God the case is still against us but there had to come what now notice in God himself when we look at the scriptures we as the Holy Spirit just just was moving you know upon our hearts last week and we were looking at these things to understand that it was the very God the very God himself who is the judge he became our attorney and he not only did some attorney he became the jury he became he stood he took his own life and to to see that how there was no way when a man was trying to live according to the law of God Romans 8:1 in May through 8 for man was trying to live according to the law of God but yet but it did not have the power within it to give man the real reality that man could live by the righteousness of God but yet man were trying to live by that but the law remember the law was given in order to point out we were guilty it was given in order to point out you're guilty and there must come one who's able to fulfill that law and the fulfillment of that law is by the life of the righteous one himself when Abraham him on the plains he is he is revealed Paul we picked this up in Hebrews seven I believe he is revealed as Melchizedek he is one who did not have beginning of days nor ending of life he had neither father nor mother and and to think that he is the king of righteousness he is the king of peace not just that he is righteous he is the king of righteousness all true righteousness it comes from the very king of righteousness who is our milk ascetic our high priest the Lord God Almighty who took upon the veil of flesh in the body of Jesus Christ that was made that was there to move on our behalf and stand now as a mediator between us and God hey man we were in need of a mediator and a mediator is one who stands between two parties in order to intervene and to ratify a covenant and God Himself became one of us amen and took he bore he took his our sins upon himself and he paid that sin debt to the worship for the worshiper that then the life coming back the life coming back is a witness as the Holy Spirit deals with the heart it's a witness there is pardoning power in the blood of the Lamb it witnesses to our life there is true Liberty hallelujah you see where the church world falls so short is because they teach it in a manner as though well we've got a perpetuation we've got a sacrifice for sin that is true but there is a life inside of that sacrifice when it comes upon the worshiper it brings you in the blood sale your very nature is changed you no longer desire the things of the world you see it teaches man's idea teaches and brings it brings or it strips from what the rights that belong to us as sons and daughters of God we're in that a life does not live in the victory that it ought to live in but I'm telling you this morning there is victory in the Lord Jesus Christ we have received a message straight from the throne of God and let me tell you something the messenger does not pack the message alone he glory he came with the signature of Abraham Lincoln remember when God manifests his name it is the revealing of his word his presence of companies his messenger are you with me at from Jesus Christ and from the seven spirits better before the throne grace and peace be multiplied unto you Oh glory be to God I tell you friends I just say it very quickly you could not say it very clearly you can people can say whatever they want to say you will not know the pardoning grace of Jesus Christ in this reality had God not sent Malachi 4 you would not see it in the reality would still be under that avail in church ideas but God not the man God has broke the veil he has opened it to you and I that we can walk in and the inside of the veil that is the real revival there's the real revival we're sons and daughters of God are having a revival in the pardoning power of the blood of [Applause] let me just the Advocate is one who pleads who pleads on our behalf he does not a pleading is not one as we said last week who is begging Jesus Christ when he ascended and he took our blood he took his blood to there and he went and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high there now a body to occupy the throne he did not go to beg for mercy his life satisfied the requirement that was required so it releases back to us that comfort to know that there is one who is standing for me we know that he's standing for us because he is in us and we are in him now to think of this you know brother Branham would say it like this and I want to just just kind of just take this through that of the of the as he would bring it in in in in the Holy Ghost series here we've been dealing with that part on the on that of the Holy Ghost and to think of how that you know he said like this he says what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate what what what is an advocator what does it do it makes an advocate it has mercy it stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's a propitiation for your sins it's your righteousness my mama mama no wonder David could say I believe in Psalms three they're like the God of my righteousness I'm not standing on my righteousness it's on his righteousness and that righteousness to be reflected inside of us notice it's your righteousness it's your healing it's your life it's your resurrection it's all that God has for you he's an advocate now remember as we were you know kind of looking at that a little bit last week on the one who is the advocate is one that he is there to stand on our behalf and to make known and to us what our rights are it's one who stands you know as we said last week like sometimes you have a you know a union steward or you have somebody who would represent a student that might have a particular need and there are laws that have rights for that child and so there's one who will set down there in that office they are known as an advocate they are an advocate for that child they are there so that everything that is promised in the law that there's nobody that overrides that law there's nobody that tries to hide anything from that child or in that parent of what belongs to them but the advocate is there to quickly point out you overstepped your boundaries here the Advocate is also very quickly to point out on top mind in terms of school right now it's in it's very much there to point out even to the parent and to the child of what belongs to them now you know I've been in those meetings where we're a child and the parent and you know been through the times where we go through the testing and all of those things like that I've been sitting there where the Advocate comes in and there is a packet and packets that are given like this I do not believe at least the parents that I've worked with I've never seen one or ever heard of one that actually took those packets and memorized those packets they didn't they they didn't read it and a lot of it's just such you know legal it's such sometimes jumbo and they don't maybe they wouldn't understand it and you and I would be pressed and hard to understand some of those writings the laws as it is but there is one who understands that law and is able to break down the writing of what is in there and just simply let them know hey this is what belongs and it's coming right from the law and they give them that so that the parent and the child they can actually stand on that that if somebody would try to infringe upon their rights or if there are things that they themselves would have need of they can actually make that request and say hey I was promised that I could have extended time on my testing it shows because of this this and this it is there and there's an advocate that is for them how much that's in the temporal that's in this life but how much greater because in this life an advocate face can slip past them an advocate in this slide it's not always by your side the Union steward well and let me just because I may just be good here the Union steward but not always by your side they don't always know what's going on and let's be honest sometimes they make deals behind backs with the administration well you know I'm trying to be good but you know sometimes they'll do things like that they are not a faithful advocate but let me tell you something the Lord Jesus Christ is a faithful advocate he don't make deals behind your back he has already sealed the deal and when he releases and seals you into the economy of God he is there to minister on our behalf and to make sure that the devil is not able to infringe on our rights and he's there to let you know every promise that belongs to you as a son and daughter God let me just say like there's he's there to encourage you to even when you look at it and you don't feel worthy he's there by the pardoning power to give you strength to say I simply accept it I believe Lord what you have me and he has such a way by his presence of just lifting us to a place energizing us moving on our hearts to his love lifts us oh I'll tell you this that quote I just read to you I have I'll tell you what I have meditated on that for months since God just dropping all this down yeah I love it it has some mercy its stands in your place it does things that you can't do it's all that God has for you now in in Romans 8:26 Paul picks up here in Romans 8:26 I wish I could read the whole chapter but we'd never get through this Romans 8:1 opens up there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus is that right who are not after the flesh but they walked after the spirit how desired there's no condemnation why because the blood has been applied but case has been dismissed amen when the Holy Ghost has come into the life of a believer through the news new birth the case has been dismissed and you are personally aware of that reality and you know what a pardon does a pardon generates purity are you with me it generates purity it's like the oil inside the Dove Romans 8:26 now I think of how Paul you know Paul goes through the prayer but there is now within our hearts a groaning - - for the redemption of the body part of Romans 8 you know verse 25 it brings us into that place - where here we are as the children of God we are with a hope a hope being an expectation that is brought by faith that we are expecting to be delivered from this body of corruption and then how Paul would drop in by the Holy Spirit in verse 26 and let us know of Gulbis our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered I mean this scripture we could just go on and on and and preach on and on but to recognize that for you and I remember when God brought Israel into the land I believe it's in an industrial of five when he brings them into the land God told him he said let the ark be such a space ahead of you with the priest bearing it and he says you are to follow that art because you've never passed this way before the Bible said we are new we are new creatures in Christ Jesus behold all things how old things are passed away and behold all things are become new and taranta see that within that of the life it takes the Holy Spirit moving and dealing in our life even for you and I we would not even know what to pray about if it was not for God himself letting you and I know this is what I want you to pray for you see the Spirit of God interceding even as it would intercede within us with groanings that cannot be uttered now think about this with in the scripture it isn't just here the holy spirit has the scripture lays it out whereas though that God has just taken us and going to pull us through a pipe the Bible says that the spirit also helpeth our infirmities now I'm not going to ask you this morning because every one of us would have our hands up both hands probably we all have within us infirmities and weaknesses we have things that were you know inherited and whatever and so forth and these things that are all down to think even after the cleansing power of the blood of the Lamb has moved in to actually bring the cleansing of the soul to where that the Holy Spirit sets down right in the midst of our life there is still this body that is still under the curse of sin as much as we try to take care of it we try to you know when we get a headache we take an aspirin or whatever we try to do we try to do all we can to take care of this body but this body is still under the curse of sin this body you know that way you know here we are we're healed one time we'll get sick again there's times you know that we go through sicknesses and we think my what did what was it like to feel well what was it a lot enough to have sinus headaches what was it like not to have this and then here we come through that time and we are so thankful to God for His mercy and we appreciate health hey listen God's desire listen to me now is not that we would be in sickness but notice clouds word is even in a measure of preventive care the Bible tells us in third John chapter one that God's desire is that we that even in our body it would prosper and be in health even as our soul does it's God's desire that we would be within health and you say now why does God allow sickness to come all to show you and I that he's a healer he wants to show you and I his mercy and his tenderness God wants to display his power through the infirmities and the weaknesses that would come around in our life to realize that there's witnesses that things that you and I would simply love to be able to cut and be able to say no more I no longer have that infirmity about my life and there are certain things that God actually moves down to do to where it actually removes that and to think that even so many of the times within our human weaknesses the the temperaments our human makeup there's things about every one of us no doubt you've talked to yourself and you've called yourself a dummy you've called yourself how in the world did you make this mistake how in the world did you do this again man if I could tie you up to a post come on now don't look at me every one of you maybe you don't say it out loud but there's just those times that there's things about you that you wish you could cut out and we're no longer bother you but remember now the Spirit of God coming to help us with our infirmities that's not altogether mean that every little weakness is cut out on the contrary but what it means he causes our eyes to be lifted to the one who has already overcome all of those things to the one that is overcome who has ascended at the right hand of God and has sent back the Holy Ghost so much that he can tell you and I greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world it reminds you and I that the mighty Conqueror is not far off he's living inside of you glory be to God the same God that rode in in the power and the vesture of his word dipped in blood and overthrew satan's stronghold in your life and is living right there in the midst in your life yet there's weaknesses all around you but as a real child of God can look at it and say there might be weaknesses all around me but the Lord is my help I am trusting in the Lord oh do you want a self-help book no I need to help her himself I don't need self-help I need the helper for hallelujah the spirit also helpeth our infirmities we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered a whole glory be to God I'll tell you I thank God for his mercy that would point things out in our lives to those who you know within every one of us in human weaknesses and I don't want to dwell with this a lot this morning but within human weaknesses some of us are overreaching we build the bridges some of us don't care if there's a bridge when we get there or not this is sera sera there right and we have that and that deals with it's not well this one's better than the other no it's just as much that a person who over reaches and can be in such a manner like that can become so vexed sometimes with things not being perfect and they become so much to where their makeup begins to encroach on the actual advocacy of the power of God in their life and God will have to allow situation to arise to where that they realize us that you know what I can't deal with this this is not me dealing with it all along it's yeah it's gonna take the Lord to help me and then there's those those of us that might look at and say well you know well you know whatever it is you know praise God we're predestinated we're going to make it anyhow and God sometimes has to get us kick us in the seat of the pants and let us know and say hey look you can't or you can't walk this walk in a lackadaisical way but you have to reach out to Almighty God who ministers to our heart that lets us know I'm here to help you but I'm not gonna pull you through a pipe but I am gonna help you God let him know I'm not gonna clear all the inhabitants out of the land but I have commissioned you wherever every foot your foot shall tread I have ready giving you that land and God would let him know but this is what I want you to do do not be in fear do not be afraid do not be dismayed but walk with a good courage being strong in the Lord Oh glory Romans eight twenty seven and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God oh my I'm glad about that I just happened to believe when I come into a meeting I believe God's gonna speak to me I believe that now I don't I don't try to figure out what God's gonna say but I just I believe that God's gonna say something for me there's something in my heart's desire is lord help me to be in tune you know because the reality it isn't the man you know we don't preach what we want to preach there's a lot of things that can be studied sometimes there stays just like what happened me right here there was pages but in the things that I'll begin to move into and fake my I'm gonna move into this this morning and right here as I just couldn't even you know get settled with it and the Holy Spirit had me just removed those thirteen pages and say put that over here in a different place and I want you to start right here but we don't have that do we don't have the decision about what we're going to preach there are many wonderful things within the Word of God that we can minister that we all would be rejoicing in but God comes to minister personally to our needs and the Holy Spirit is there to move and to intercede on our behalf so in the word itself is coming forth I don't know about you but I stand in awe every time when I stand here and when I'm sitting out there I stand in on how the Holy Ghost can take ahold of a gift within the word and can begin to go right down through that word and minister so personally to my need and just present such a angle on it then maybe I haven't looked at it and then many times I know everyone can agree with me there are times when the word is coming forth we feel so overwhelmed we feel like howling the girl can I live up to this but God does not bring his word to push us down he brings his word that you and I might be able to see where we're falling short and be able to say lord help me Lord help me Lord that I can live this out in my life what is that that is you and i coming in tune with the holy spirit here he is living within us brother i don't know how to walk this walk but he inside of me knows how to lead me and guide me until the final moment when i stand there in his presence I have a faithful guide and you do too he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God mattel powerful this is this said in the settings of Scripture here brother Graham talks about a man by the name of brother egg elphberg and brother elphberg was a pilot on a plane and brother elphberg here he is he he receives an announcement that your landing gear will not come down you're gonna have to land this plane on the grass and that man brother Elbert and I'll think of this he puts he takes his glasses off for the RAM recounts it he takes his glasses off and he begins to pray he said Lord bring my name before brother Brown bring my name before brother Brennan have him pray for me Lord brother branham did not know what was going on but Bill Graham said I was driving in the car he said in here come brother Eggbert he said Elbert however you say it standing right in front of me he said I pulled the car over to the side of the road and I begin to pray Lord you know what kind of a trouble he's in Lord I pray for my brother then Lord you will help him in this time brother Ram did not know what went on here they were in a meeting together and brother elphberg is a singer and brother Alpert from Sweden he's a singer he begins to sing and then they meet up and find out that it was exactly the very same time when that plane should have crashed and here that landing gear comes out it was the very same time now you're in the this kind of stuff this is not things that people are just telling fly-by-nights like a lot of this stuff that goes on nowadays this stuff was documented brother Branham actually sent a man and said you go find out what time it was and go find out everything they brought it right back together he was at the exact same time Brook man said see what it was he said it was the Holy Ghost that was interceding for brother Egbert let me tell you this right here you and I have been brought into that that relationship with Jesus Christ has sons and daughters of God let me tell you when God drops a name on your heart don't you just think that's just a thought that's fine by but it is God that has put that one upon your heart we'll listen I don't know what's going on you don't need to know what's going on all you need to know is call into prayer for that son or daughter or that family or that Minister whoever it is that God puts on your heart you go into prayer and you know what you don't need to blab it and tell everybody what you did just keep it between you and Jesus is that right there's sometimes God wants us to share things and there's other times God tests us and wants to know will you tell everything is that right so there's times for that be intercession brother Samuel you mean he God would use his body after all he is the vine we are the branches the intercession him moving on our behalf I'm so glad about that now I'll be honest and you can be honest too maybe some of y'all may be you know I I'm a morning guy but you know sometimes it's kind of hard at 2:30 or 3:00 o'clock in the morning when the Holy Spirit something just wakes me up and I just you know I have you know this particular name on my heart I'll be honest with you my flesh does not feel like praying let's hang aren't you looking for the pillar fire I'm looking for my pillow come on now your flesh is the same way but it moves in a place to say lord help my brother help my sister maybe you maybe you lay down you struck through your hand and then you find yourself as you're brainless and Friends it isn't always about the position of our body because you could get right out of bed get on your knees and fall asleep it ain't about the position of your body it's the position of your heart before the throne oh ma we'll send you how long should I pray pray until there's satisfied and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose now this good he don't mean everything is good but it does mean everything becomes useful he teaches us in our failures he teaches us he not only corrects us but he will instruct us and his teaching if we can receive his teaching in our lives and submitting to that it will actually bring about to where our feet there are straight paths as the Bible says that are made for our feet think about it we would look back on men in the scriptures men and women alike and we would look back on them and where we were we hold them and I believe that we ought to hold them in all proudly respect as our fellow sons and daughters of God but to take how you know with every one of the you know they were tried down through time Daniel himself going into the lion's den this was not about all the bad King and the bad people you don't know what the bad King did and the bad people did God permitted that there's a lot of things that you and I can look at and say well this that person and if this person hadn't done this and this person had said this sometimes we get so focused on those things instead of recognizing God has permitted for us to be perfected this is what brother Ram could say Daniel was in the Lions Den and a message to Rome he was in there to be perfected sometimes we get in our minds as though as believers that everything ought to be smooth there ought not be any suffering everybody that surrounds me brother Simon you are you telling me then there won't be people around me that put me in pressure no I'm not telling you about at all there'll be people all around through there'll be people that will push your buttons there'll be people and pressure and things that will come your way but it all matters on how that you and I approach it in the middle of that time Oh glory I'm not a very deep but I'm gonna preach this he's bringing it many times we are praying to get out of situations you say brother Samuel my flesh just can't take it I agree our flesh and our spirit is weak but it's not my flesh it's not my spirit that's being molded I need my character molded and in order for my character to be molded I don't need cool breezy days I need fiery trials my hands are not up for any right now you say why because you're either in one coming out of one or getting ready to go in one then this guy I don't like test I don't like trials I said this guy this guy complains as much as you do right but the inside man with his award on the inside when we can give him the ride away Daniel came at the rest of him no matter what the kingdom did Daniel came out of there more molded into the image of God than what it was before he went in there it's the same way with Joseph he was molded in that time there's also things all things work together for the good there's a lot of mistakes we make yep there's a lot of wrong decisions we make that done we're not making excuses we're not making things acceptable but I believe as a child of God when we there is never a desire within our life to make a mistake or to fail in any area if there isn't any heart that says well you know Jesus just forgives me if I do you need to make a trip to Calvary because the blood of Jesus Christ is not to be trampled on it does not when partners come it does not produce loose living the love of God is shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost and the Bible tells us that the love of God constrains us and yet there's been times where we wish that our tongue would have been more constrained shouldn't have said this maybe what you said was right but your motive and objective behind saying it was wrong and the Holy Ghost comes and brings conviction because of the motive and the objective but I'm gladly corrects us as many as I love is that the Bible I chasing and rebuke glory beats Elias therefore and repent and so there's many times we have made wrong decisions in haste what are you praying about it yeah well how do you I feel like well I ain't heard nothing about it having not heard anything don't mean you got the stamp of approval right well you know I've been praying that's good that's good what's that to keep on praying but it's hang on coming don't be anxious say Lord you're in the control sometimes three motion decisions are made that's why we need the Holy Ghost to reign over our emotions amen that's why each and every day give me give us this day our daily bread lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen sometimes through reasoning we'll make the wrong decision come on somebody we reason things out reason out decisions you don't mean you're not a child of God it means you're gonna get corrected oh yeah because his desire notices in verse 29 I'm trying to get somewhere for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified it is a finished work with him yet in our life we don't see ourselves as a finished work and it's true we in we are a work in progress but he is not the author of confusion he knows the end from the beginning is that right this is why that real discipline this is why real true discipline and chastening is not random it's not because we got on God's nerves but discipline when he chastens and rebukes us discipline is that he corrects us without admit meant our best interest in mind because he already knows the future and if we keep going this way we'll never make it there but he disciplines us with a vision and the discipline when as we receive it as children it goes with us Oh glory what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things glory be to God don't you love the Lord this advocate does things for us that we cannot do ourselves he freely gives to us all things but it does not mean that we've got the box of sitting on the front porch in order to in order to fully possess them he has to fully possess us it's us dying to ourselves oh yeah listen friends when when you have received the Holy Ghost everything you have need of is in you right there including the rapture but it's us pressing outport it and he is calling to us verse 33 who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies it's God that declares us righteous who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us now what's up Paul has taken this from verse 26 brings it to - to verse 34 and to realize that the Holy Ghost is the very Spirit of God it is God is not another person it is God the same God that was above us with us now in us him and so the Holy Ghost listen to me now the Holy Ghost dwelling in the body of Jesus Christ never was tempted the Bible says in James chapter one God cannot be tempted but the body was tempted is that right so God comes down and he takes upon flesh and blood that he might be a faithful and merciful for high priest so here God here within the resurrection and then taking the body up to the minute Oriole seat setting on the throne of God now sending back the Holy Ghost we have a direct eye to our high priest there is not - a born-again believer there is not a gap between him and God there is no longer a chasm it has been done away with because the Holy Ghost does away with the breach are you with me this is why the important of the breach between men of the church ages and the seals it does away with the chasm it ties us back into the mind of God lets us know you are always sons and daughters of God and it releases the power of the Holy Ghost in our life that we recognize that we stand in the very righteousness of Almighty God what does that produce the love of God produces faith faith worketh by love hallelujah this is where we're standing even these things that were ministering were standing in Joshua chapter one when God would tell him don't be afraid don't be dismayed big was why he's got to have a basis for faith and the real basis for faith is forgiveness who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us hallelujah amen God took his understanding back to glory with him he understands what it's like to be tempted I want to read you this here all he says mother bream says how we could go into details with that about the advocate it makes intercession for our ignorance sometimes when we got the Holy Ghost we ignorantly stagger into something the Holy Spirit is there to make an advocate for us many of those time that whole sitting have done that why don't I say that and let's just be honest sometimes how it is coming don't say that and we go ahead and say it but it don't qualify it it just means we're going to get corrected and there has to be a repentance for it is that right we ignorant Lee stagger into something the Holy Spirit is there to make advocate for us he is our advocator he is our attorney he stands there and pleads for us we don't plead for ourselves because the Holy Spirit in us please for us oh I'm glad about that the Holy Spirit giving utterance sometimes with words you can't understand and he makes intercession for us that's what the Holy Ghost is when I walk into anything I look like a little kid you walk like a little fellow we're walking in a dark world full of enemies full of sin full of traps full of everything I'm not attractive I know brother Wayne's a traveler Madine here I was like I haven't explained it but maybe there's some others that have done trapping well brother herb did trap them before to anything you're going to trap you don't put the trap right out in plain sight you don't advertise the plane the trap you disgust me and you don't put a trap in an area that trap first of all can only be laid whether it's going to be whatever it is you're seeking for you've got to know they're moving and frequenting that area and you've got to be able to put that trap down but it cannot have one trace of human scent on it it can't many times they got a boil them in the water and everything else to kill that scent on that trap but then there is a lure that is put in that trap there's got to be something that will lure or that will appeal to that animal to get that animal to even move over to that trap and there as he comes into that trap he's caught within that trap but I'm gonna tell you here this morning there isn't we have an advocate with a father that the devil himself he studies every way he studies every pathway and every way we go but brother he never said there wouldn't be traps he never said you when you're caught by a trap but he also said I'll make a way out of that I will come and release that trap or that hope that is taken upon your life this is what the advocate does for us full of enemies foo of everything else I walk like a little kid a little kid walks into things little kids don't even know the danger they're walking into we were one of the first times they're picking on Zachary now one of the first times you know and let him pick up the crossbone whatever more you know he's wanted to pick up the crossbow want to pick up the bows don't realize at all man we're dealing with a weapon here daddy I want to see your gun I will see you 22 I want to see you shotgun no no no no no no no no no not right now but they look at it don't understand the danger that's in it you know how it is with our children we got to teach them stove is hot it's hot like as though that helps it's hot but many of them have to find out by experience whoo this is Warren you know as this sometimes as a parent you may get their hand and you bring it close to where that fires at as I see that's really hot that's really warm you're trying to help them so that they don't end up with some sort of a burn is that right but there might be something come along to where they're not under hey they're not really they're cooking something or they're doing something they ought not to be doing and they don't have the real respect for it that they ought to but you're letting experience combine their way I'll tell you right quick they'll learn how that's hot they'll learn to handle it a little bit differently the next time say they don't continue on it they don't learn we are not children that there are just ignorant but God by His grace even in the midst of our failures he is faithful to intercede for us and teach us there's not one parent in here that would delight in heaven your child fail over and over and over but the desire that we have is that our children they would actually be able to walk and be able to benefit from our mistakes and be able to climb beyond those things is that right we would desire those very things think about it if that's how you and I feel as a parent how about Almighty God God desires to have that overcoming power displayed in our life he will not leave us in a trap you might be in a trap but I'm telling you this morning that the blood of Jesus Christ has already made a way that that trap is strong you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay in that condition Oh glory be to God look at this brother em says you say oh I'm afraid I'm afraid to take Christian life I'm afraid to do this I'm afraid I'll do this I was there I said I was there when God first got ahold of my life and dealt with my heart you know what you know what was holding me back from really surrendering the way out where I wanted was something within and I knew I need to because I was looking at my abilities and I knew I cannot live this I've tried I've made commitments I tried to do this and it held me back but I'm so grateful that His grace I said His grace yet overrode calling myself will it come to a plate so I realized it ain't about myself will it's what he has already done and what he will do through me then when we're looking at him in that right way fear has to flee brethren would say don't be afraid we have an advocate he stands bias he's in US and he makes intercession for us the Holy Spirit constantly constantly I like that making an advocate for us all the time he is our advocate he's with me through thick and thin he said he'd never leave me nor forsake me now the death might fly up on the branch but I never lose the Holy Ghost there's an advocate I have with the father let's look at this just a few moments here and finishing this up brother Branham would say like this forgive in prayer forgive our many weaknesses and Lord we don't intend to do anything wrong Lord but through flesh we do make mistakes daily so in order to stay alive in Christ we have to die to our own thoughts so keep us dead to ourselves and alive in him I don't know about you but that's my prayer keep me dead to my thoughts and alive in you you know the Bible would tell us when we read our scripture here this morning it would let us know if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness the opening scripture we read this morning my little children I write unto you that you sin not to the admonition this is why this is why that old Baptist theology it's not of God well you've got a sin a little bit every day that's a lie that's a lie you don't have to do nothing a little bit every day whether you're looking at it wrong you need to look at the pardoning power that there is strength in the blood of the Lamb God's not calling survivors you're an overcomer amen you're anointed to overcome in this hour but send me or not I fear I'm not preaching about how you feel I'm telling you who you are you're igniter to overcome the word has come to lift you in the reality of this word and let you know that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous why would he why would this be placed in here in this time the same reason God would tell Joshua and just with chapter 1 as I was with Moses so will I be with you in that one statement God let Joshua know through all of Moses mistakes and failures through all the failures in the journey in the wilderness I was with Moses not who was with Moses I am with you also you see what the pardoning power does it don't just stay with the messenger who brings it as an example but it comes to you and I that we can walk with that same boldness and authority as sons and daughters of God brother Brenton would put it just like this he said when Joshua heard those words he could walk with the reckless faith reckless faith you know what that means I mean don't know how might make a mistake well what should I you know what should I do first of all calm down I mean that's first you have an audience with the king you can go to him he said ask to father anything in my name it I will do it Lord I don't know which way to turn right here I don't know what to do right here hi I'm in need of your leadership right here Lord this is coming up once I do look to him do not be dismayed dismayed means to be shattered and fall apart like a vase there'll be situations oh my I wish I could preach on this right now in the land there's situations that will arise then absolutely fear can come but the word of the Lord is there perfect love casts out fear we could remember that I am with you whether so ever thou goest I am with you we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous do the brennaman I just want to read these points to you he says the Lord I'm praying for them this is present stage of my ministry I pray for them that they will not any time fail and if they do fail make quickly they have that advocate with the father which I have learned to be such a great thing I don't know about you but I've learned the same thing the advocate with the father is a great thing I've had to learn it how by experience Amen father that when I make all my mistakes what I find that I have an advocate right quick with the father through Jesus Christ and I'm brought back into grace again the loving hand of the Lord wipes away there's a bloody sacrifice laying there that I confess to be my Savior and if you know we need to continually be cleansed we need to continue to be washed once our soul has been lost from the defilement of sin our so no longer needs washing but we still need washing of water by the word when Peter asked the Lord Jesus in John chapter 13 he said he said wash all of me and Jesus said he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all this whole principle is that the cleansing washing of water by the word is washing us it's cleansing us it's washing that it isn't once that back that new birth is coming my soul my soul has been washed but I need continual wash his brother bran would say before the throne he said there on the throne is everliving making intercession the Christian is kept clean day and night in the presence of God it cleanses us constantly day and night from all sin we are safely tucked in well he said there's no more judgement but Christian never goes to the judgment Christ went for him my attorney stood in my place many of you remember the interview that brother Branham did had with sister Bruce and I've told you this I've said this to you over and over as it was relayed to me by another individual who was there at the Tabernacle this was not sister Bruce that called this interview brother branham called it but the RAM heard what she had been saying oh I wish I had what you had I wish I had what you had and brother Branham called the interview with her and here his sister Bruce you know she's in the midst of a condition that's in her body at the time her heart she's suffering in her heart and as far as gonna have to have a procedure if the Lord doesn't intervene on her behalf but ranma's talking with her and I just want to relay these words he said now he said you know I'm gonna pray for you but you know I'm not worthy of that he said but if I was thinking if Jesus Christ himself was here he'd lay his hands on you he said now my hands you know to think of it it's not my hands he said but I'm standing in his place I've come to represent him he said before God I'm not a sinner neither are you that's powerful that's something that it you need to say Lord let it sink down to the fifth rib we got a blood sacrifice laying there God don't even see us he hears our voice but he sees the blood of Christ he sees the blood of his own son it's our voice Christ's blood then it's Christ that's talking through us to God so therefore we're not sinners no more we are Christians sister Bruce says you can put your name there I make so many mistakes and I failed so many times that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you he took your mistakes your desire in your heart is to serve Him that's what he died for so you could serve Him your mistakes are not looked or lauded to you he is your perpetuation he is your sin offering your sins are not knowing you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve Him how is that possible brother Samuel I now have made mistakes but the desire within your heart there's been a change in your life and the desire is not to do wrong you don't have the things of the world the love is to cause the desire as I do only those things that please him that's where conviction comes in our heart even as I said even when the motive of something has been wrong everybody else you could go to a person and say forgive me I shouldn't have said that maybe I'm the only one that's had to do that not just one hand both hands I don't have enough fingers let's say no I didn't I didn't I didn't catch nothing I I mean but what I knew the Holy Ghost had smoked my heart your motive your attitude within it no outside here looks just right now I know I'm not preaching angels this morning I'm preaching the mortals sons and daughters of God who are encompassed with infirmities just like I am but we can receive it here this morning listen to me you don't have to live looking at infirmities you look to him who is our help and our strength remember it isn't holy Lord if I could just get away from this where nervousness wants to come around me God said how about it I got something better than that how about I'll let how about I drool over that thing in your life and I turn it over to you and Shaitan wants to make his encroachment again because you realize Satan will try to make his encroachment but you have become ruler over that thing and you're an overcomer because you recognize that thing when it starts to rise and you know that greater is He that is in me is greater than that and has already overcome that thing glory be to God feel like she'll hallelujah he's standing he is our advocate standing on our behalf we are identified in our sacrifice oh my I'll tell you I just love that I love that so much but the RAM talks about that how he says Oh God in another place awakening Jesus we're going to the throne of God to ask for pardoning of our sins because knowing day by day we do fail thee every hour of our day seldom one passes without we have to stop and say Lord forgive me I didn't mean to do it just that way I should have done it this other way then we know Lord that you're always so full of mercy and ready to forgive your children you listen to their famous cry we're so glad that we have an advocate the Bible is clear the worshipper once purged has no more desire for sin he don't want to see him he'll do things wrong and as soon as he does it he'll confess his sins right there sometimes you might try to go along and try to reason it out well you know I had to do this because of this but remember the tax case come on somebody when the Prophet went to pray for that that child the Holy Spirit rebuked him said you hypocrite is that right but brother Branham knew where to go go to his advocate you see as it listened to me as the son and daughter of God in taking the promises of God I want you to understand this to have an advocate with the father does not mean that we live a haphazard compromising life this is for you and I to walk with authority that you're not sealed one day and unsealed the next day you're not a Christian one day and not a Christian the next day I'm a son of God or a daughter of God today I'm not a son or not no you may not feel that one but when the Holy Ghost is there within your soul by the nature the indwelling of his life your status has never changed in the presence of God but fellowship must be restored and the only way for fellowship to be restored is to confess your sin and he is faithful and just to forgive us and then this is where apostle paul could tell you and i in order to keep possessing the land Paul said I've learned to forget those things that are behind me how in the world could Paul say that well it was a reality that Paul had to come to in his life so that it came to a place to Paul accepting what God had did for him and through his life that it wasn't that when Paul got ready to go make a move the devil bring this back up and said yeah but you failed right here yeah but you the devil listen to me that same very deep but you're walking victory the devil is always there to remind you of your failures and if you start dueling on those failures you start questioning your life you get your eyes off of your you get your eyes off the sacrifice and you get your eyes on yourself when you do that feel it starts to come in you are paralyzed right there what I have to do keep your eyes on the sacrifice have faith in the word that if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness the devil trying to hang something over ahead to try to do what keep you from possessing the ground that God has given to you as sons and daughters of God he's always there but remember that life within you if you give that the right away it'll stand for you and you find that release in that channel moves right now anybody with me this morning this is right down with what you put in the lunch box tomorrow amen this goes with you along with your thermos body there's always a regret of the mistakes in the past if there's no regret if it's as well you know then there's something wrong it's not just oh well it's mites our heart the Holy Ghost brings conviction God's desire is that that life would be so preeminent inside of us that that pardoning power that cleansing power that we live by the advocacy of the Lord Jesus Christ having faith in that word truly when we've done wrong we are condemned but this is why we repent this is why we go to him and we ask him to forgive us because we believe what he said that he would forgive us Jesus does not listen to me Jesus does not through forgiveness hold something over your head that ain't forgiveness Jesus don't bring it back up that's the devil once it has went in the blood it's no more you remember it and the devil tries to reminds you of it oh my but this is where to learn this very principle in warfare that in order to take land to recognize I've got an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous this right here will never be perfect in this life it's not an excuse but this was God get born again just like this got born again but this right here on the inside this new birth is leading this thing to a body change if a man the Spirit of God on the inside is bringing it in subjection the amendment things of Rosa and we're falling in traps and other things we've sent things wrong but thanks be to God not just for forgiveness but thanks be to God but we've got a confidence to say lord help me Lord God help me to recognize that and to overcome I'm grateful for the real pardoning power of the Advocate of the Lord Jesus Christ one who stands by me one who stands in us and is constantly interceding on our behalf aren't you glad for that person and amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord every every need every heart you know Lord you know in this whole journey that Lord the journey that we we are in your Lord you knew of every every every trap and all that would lay around but that was not your focus that was not your focus Lord neither is it to be our focus we're not to walk in fear we're not to walk underneath condemnation because you can't it's got to be lifted Lord we're fellowship has been broken sin hinders fellowship Lord you're our advocate as John would write we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous years the perpetuation of our sins Lord you see father throughout this building this morning you see every heart Lord in every life lord I believe dear God that you've spoken to our hearts and a personal way Lord to remind us to also to teach us Lord that our faith because in this journey not that we would live under Lord the thought of well I could just be forgiven no how are we we're so thankful Lord for your forgiveness we're so thankful for your mercy and your grace we're so thankful Lord how we have learned what a great thing the Advocate is the Lord from our hearts it's never our desire to do wrong when we have been changed quick and Lord in our lives it's never our desire to do the desire is to please you so Lord we realize that it's like the man who went into the Ballard flour company and he went in there because he wanted a job and the man walked in there and he had a pencil but mr. Ballard noticed that pencil didn't have an eraser on it and he asked that he asked that man he said sir why don't why don't you have any eraser on your pencil he said well symbol I don't make any mistakes mr. Ballard quickly endured ended the interview he let the man know I can't use you then I can't hire you the man's reply what do you mean he said because a person who doesn't make any mistakes is a person who don't do anything they don't work at [Music] Lord Jesus we don't have pencils without erasers our pencil hallelujah our life Lord God the Spirit of God within us Lord it has that pardoning power Lord that erasing Lord that lifts the strength that we need and when fellowship is broken that it can be restored as sons and daughters of God again that we might rise above that Lord that we might belong and possess what you are calling us to possess help us Lord we stand every day of our lives in need of you Lloyd or Jesus were overcomers Baba blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony or Jesus how we thank you Lord this morning I pray if there's one Lord that's gathered here this morning under the sound of my voice then Lord they don't know that pardoning power they don't know what it is Lord within their heart to actually be free from the bondage and defilement of sin Lord Jesus may in the simpleness of simplicity Lord God as their heart would be moved by your spirit may they Lord God accept that Lord may be Lord accept that inside with the word it say Lord I don't want to just have a church life I want to have your life I want that life to live with inside of me where I am made free from the law of sin and death the desire of the world has fled from my soul or God receiving power and life to live in victory in this hour as a son and daughter of God Granite Lord granted to those hearts this morning Lloyd and I pray father as we stood here Lord set here and we gathered under your presence Lord I ask that may God within every one of our hearts if there's one that's out of fellowship but around here this morning the Holy Spirit Lord has food to their heart that they would come back into fellowship or Jesus and whatever it would be Lord that would be hindering whatever it is that they've let it go unattended Lord if it's something Lord that has been said wrong or done if it's a trap Lord God I believe this morning Lord God that you're present to spring that trap I believe that Lord I believe you're pressing this morning Lord that they can walk out of here or Jesus that they can walk out of here the sporty without Lord God that load or that burden an order to respond to the conviction of the Holy Spirit and not just here but Lord every day of our lives we don't want to see how close we can live to the world like the man Lord who was seeking for a driver and he asked these drivers in the ones said I can drive real I can drive so close to the edge of that mountain then this other one said I don't see how close I can get to the edge I just stand right up tight to the mountain that God said that's where that you're the one I want to drive me Lord our desire is not to see how close to the world that we can live our desire is not for the world of how much that we could have our desire is to please you Lord Jesus [Music] it's to serve you with all of our hearts even in Lord some of the deepest of parts in our life with motives objective attitudes our thinking Lord God even how your prophet would tell us that even if we go to thinking the wrong thought and he would give us the example like I've got a right to get even he said just thinking that wrong thought or caused the Dove to fly upon the roost lord help us help us the Lord God every moment of our life traps are all around us but we're not to walk in fear but may we Lord is your children as the word has come forward this morning may we pray over it may we take it Lord tomorrow morning when we wake up and we would start our day Lord may we ask for your leadership in the day Lourdes mama would get the kids ready to go daddy gets ready to go north God may the morning begin with the lamb and not God in the evening may it end with the lamb Lord for we believe there is strength strength in you Lord to live above the things of the world we want to be more like you conformed to the image of your dear son help us Lord in every test every drop help us
