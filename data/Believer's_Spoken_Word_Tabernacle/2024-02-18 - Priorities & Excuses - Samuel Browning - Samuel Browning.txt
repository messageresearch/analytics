hear a quote this morning that brother Bram said they just spoke to me about how much we need the Lord in this hour the little boat as it dashed across the lake it must have been about the time that Satan must have raised up and said oh I've caught him caught them alone without him now it's time to settle the score with them for they had been casting out demons and so forth so I'll just settle the score that's when Satan can settle the score when he finds that you've been off without Jesus that's when Satan will get the church when you got so interested in something else besides prayer meetings when you got so interested that's your you're supposed to have the natural growth instead of a spiritual growth then remember Satan's on his Road he caught you without him but oh God my prayer wake up the church again in oldfashioned all night prayer meetings wake up the people a spiritual atmosphere it takes to bring children into the kingdom it takes that atmosphere amen [Music]

chapter 14 and want to say I sure love you and the Lord and it's good to it's good to be together amen had the Lord given us a beautiful day yes just a beautiful day I I really enjoy these sunny days uh I really enjoy them a lot you know it seems like it just gives you a little bit of a of a little oomph and uh I just love that when that the warmth is coming in and uh so I also want to remind you of the fellowship dinner that will be following uh the service right out there at the Heritage Presbyterian Church right out of 58 in Amherst there um if you happen to not know how to get there I think the address is on each of the bulletin boards in the restroom as well as one of the deacons or you can see someone and uh I also want to we want to welcome uh sister Sabrina Turner and she's here God bless you Sister Bina amen amen so that's uh brother John Turner's wife and you remember when they were here with brother Benny Perry when we had both the time when brother Benny was here and then even been in the meetings and amen she's been here a few other times as well and taken care of some some duties and business and things and also want to welcome uh Carlos and his wife and family God bless you good to have you here with us or I guess I should say carito that's actually how it's wrote so but we welcome you good to have you this morning and uh also uh sister Kylie and and her daughter God bless you welcome Amen brother ion's daughter granddaughter good to have you all with us and um so we want to just look here in the word of the Lord here just uh for a few moments this morning and just truly trusting the Lord will just help us and just to speak what he's placed on our hearts let's begin reading in uh verse 15 and when one of them sat at meet with him and heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God now you realize bread is the staff of Life bread actually speaks of God's own life and you think about the hour that we are standing in in this time we we realize we're standing in a moment um that you're seeing that the entire B ible it was written for this moment where we are seeing in time the scriptures and everything points to this hour and God fulfilling this moment and so when you think about the scripture there's a scripture in Isaiah that says seven women that speaks of churches would take hold upon one man and that one man is Christ but this is what they would say to him they would say to him we're going to eat our own bread and we're going to eat we're going to wear our own apparel but just let us be called by your name to take away our reproach but you know when God does every anything you know first of all he doesn't come according to any of our demands he's made a way and it's up to us to whether or not we'll accept his way and I think it's very clear that our way is always the wrong way his way is always the right way and so the blessing is is when we you're United with Christ well you not only take upon his name which is his life which is his character uh which is the bread but you also become adorned in his word and so it's just a privilege to be United with him so in verse 16 there it says and a certain man made a great supper and bade many and he sent his s his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready I'm going to let you have your seats and ask the Lord to bless the word as you're being seated I don't want to keep you standing but I would do want to continue to read so a certain man in verse 16 made a great supper and bade many and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I've bought a piece of ground I must needs go and see it and I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come now all of this is writing of the supper it's the preparation and in the Fulfillment of God's word this was expressing even in the ministry of the Lord Jesus when God was standing here in Corporal body and what was being provided uh to restore back to man a rightful relationship the price would be paid and that man might become a full partaker of the very life of God like he had in the Garden of Eden and so it's a provided notice a certain man made a supper so this has been provided it wasn't anything that that they had to do it's God simply fulfilling his word and then God would send out the call and you one thing you find as we read through this Parable which we are familiar with is God doesn't make anybody serve him as a matter of fact even even lives that have come into a surrender to the Lord and been born of the spirit of God God still does not make us do anything it's not something that he's making us do but the spirit of God works on our life for us to yield to him and then him coming and doing it and there and so when we look at this here you find that many things were offered there of I've bought an ox and I've bought some ground of married a wife and all of those things and then it goes on in verse 21 it says so that servant came and showed his Lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and Lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the Halt and the blind that's a that's a healing campaign right verse 22 and the servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be fill filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper now I just say it in this way you know it's just like around your table sometimes when we have a family gathering we have to go and borrow chairs from the basement and other places you know and put them around there but at God's table every chair is already been placed Hallelujah before the foundation of the world so God is Not not looking around and and hoping that he has enough seats or hoping that he has enough uh garments and hoping no God knows exactly how many and as a matter of fact it it's him that has to move and does move upon the hearts of his children of whom those places have been reserved for before the foundation of the world God doesn't keep anybody out neither does God Drive anybody in but God simply sends his his word and his word is what will bring a call upon the hearts of the people that is even greater than our own Rebellion it is greater than our own desires it becomes greater than anything else around us and we can't get away from it and so when we think of this here brother Bram when he preaches the message is your life worthy of the gospel and that's where drawing much of the inspiration this morning here and throughout the cannon of the scripture but he's in prayer when he's beginning this message is your life worthy of the gospel and he's he's stating the the reason for it in prayer for this particular uh service he says so many has asked me is the Christian Life a life of church service is it helping the poor and the needy or is it a constant member is it a loyalty to the church and such questions now listen listen if people are asking questions there's a reason questions are not just we don't think up questions unless they come from Reflections upon the heart and you think in this hour there if there's a question then there is an certain answer to that question there even no matter what even the question might even be upon your heart there is a certain answer and that certain answer comes from God and God Alone no matter what the situation is so we can take this this rest and I want to just read if I can going into this moment of Revelations 3 and verse 14 because here we are we're standing here at the End of the Age we're standing in a very awesome hour and an awesome time where the Bible would say that the let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made her self ready it would speak of what a blessing it is to be called to the wedding supper to the marriage supper and it's we are called to that by the true sayings of God you see we're not being assembled to a man to an organization to the thoughts or the idea of a man but these are the true sayings of God God has brought back once again and brought back a people in whom the word of God is their absolute not just carrying around the Bible and saying well it's my absolute but I don't know about that scripture uh God I think it means this I think it means this then the word of God is not your absolute but God in himself God himself did this not by a debate not by not by coming down and reasoning us into it and and saying words but God himself vindicates his own word to be the truth God does that it's God who just settles all disputes amen it just goes to show you the grace of God that no matter how much even when the Lord Jesus could stand there and speak to those Pharisees but they had nothing within them to hear what was being said there was nothing in there to catch that spark of life no matter how much was Vindicated and I tell you if this if there's something in your heart a desire to serve God and you might say I'm not I I know I'm not where I need to be but 's a desire in your heart to serve God you are a blessed people this morning God can work with the desire as a matter of fact he put that desire in you and if you'll trust him he'll lead you to a place of fulfillment the Bible says this in verse 14 so we're we're speaking of this uniting and the angel of the Church of the lady oans right this is where we're standing these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth does not value uh an in between life we don't want to live an in between life we don't want to live even even between God's Will and our will we don't want to live between that we want to live fully to God's will because the in between is where that God says that I I I would rather you're fully hot or you're fully or you're fully cold don't live an in between life and I just let's just be honest here any that lives an in between life that is the most miserable place to live amen that's right it's miserable right is that right you might say well coldness with would be miserable well that's true but listen it's very miserable to know that you're not being whom God has called you to be and it's kind of in between but God's desire is is that our lives would be burning with his own life and this in this hour the amen is speaking this message is the amen is the Christ is the so be it the faithful and true witness from the beginning of the creation of God verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked what's the condition of the saes trusting in uncertain riches trusting trusting in their Works trusting in their Creeds trusting in their dogmas this is the condition of it notice I counsel thee to buy me gold a character that's tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see how many's ever had that matter in your eyes you know you wake up and you can hardly get your eyes open you had that sometimes it happens in the in the in this time of the year and you and you have to have it washed off it takes a nice hot cloth and that's what the Holy Spirit comes to do is to remove the matter whatever it is that where we can't see clearly straightly the Holy Spirit comes to anoint our eyes now notice as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zelous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man will hear my voice and open the door this is personal yes he stands and he knocks at the door and if any man hear my voice so it's hearing him what he saying and it's something that's very personal to a life and to a heart I will come into him what a blessing and will suck with him and he with me and we'll have Fellowship we'll have communion now I want you to look at this brother Bram says in this message is your life worthy says when God sends the Holy Ghost and knocks at a heart man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it down for his last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit I want you to listen very carefully you can sit in a church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel you might do as much as to say I know it's right but never put your finger on it to help it yourself you just listen to it and say I believe it's right that's just sympathizing with it we don't want to be sympathizers brother REM said I could say I believe that's $110,000 that don't mean I got it I could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and then you won't have the privilege to come and receive it and this is where brother B says to you people that are here and I'm responsible and other ministers are speaking to if it's right if it's right if this message if this word is right we owe our whole life to it what more could you ever find that would be more of a benefit to you than to know that you can have eternal life you can have everything that this world world has as a matter of fact I just stood just just days ago stood in in a in a home that was built by one of the founding uh uh men of all the things within the nation of the the builtmore home and stood there walking through that massive structure and looking at it but you look it's the emptiness at the end of the day where all of this has been uh built by the Vanderbilts and all that and at the end of the day where and all what does it really matter right it's a structure that's just a memory that somebody built and and somebody made a right decision of investment and all of that they profited in this world but when it came down to their soul and it came down for the real purpose that God had them here upon this life they missed it hallu they missed it you see eternal life is not about what you can do it's about accepting what God has already done for you the Rich Young Ruler he came face to face with the person of eternal life and a matter of fact he knew he needed something he knew he lacked something and yet he was keeping all of the Ten Commandments but when he stood there face to face with the Lord Jesus and he he knew this is where I need to get to I I need to get here this is who I need to talk to this is who has the answer for my life and when the answer came it touched an area in his life that he loved more God did not override what he loved right he was given an opportunity and he turned around and he walked away sorrowful what a decision you know the later account of that man is he lifted up his eyes in hell he thought differently then in Hell the Bible says in the Book of Job it's nakedness there ain't no such thing as buddies in Hell there ain't no such thing as family getting together in hell every man is naked there's no clevering in other words there's nothing to hide behind man knows oh my how did I get here I've sinned away my day of Grace and that Rich Young Ruler you say brother Samuel I don't think we should preach that way that's the bible let me just tell you just as sure as there's a heaven there's a hell there's a heaven to gain and a hell to lose we don't we don't want to go we don't want to go that way the Bible says in the Book of Proverbs that the her ways the ways to hell they are a steady decline right we don't want to go that way no but notice and I want to just say it in this way and I'm just I'm just going to take my moment just times on this right here within the few moments that I have before me every your walk and our walk with God is not a collective Affair in your family it's between you and God as an individual are you hearing me it's not we're not going go in upon one upon another even the prophet speaking just hear it again the other day when he's talking even of his children he's not granting even his children to pass right he said they've got to be filled with the same spirit of God have the same experience that I and their mother have so it's not just well I love brother brandom I'm going that's improper placement that's right Amen to really love in the right way is to see and recognize that it's Christ and you are in love with Christ Christ because a man did not die for you it was not his blood that was shed for you that's why the pro that's why the word could say if you receive a prophet in the name characteristic of a prophet you receive a prophet's reward if you receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man you receive a righteous man's reward is that right you see those are uncertain grounds those are things that are just tossed up in the air I don't want we don't want want to take our chances that's not listen for for a a a a desire within a seed of God there is something that you yourself cannot rest on anything that's uncertain because there is something in you that come from God that the only place that you find rest and where your Authority and your confidence is in the word of God and when you see your life Dev tailing with the word of God there a certain place why cuz you're part of him so it's an individual Affair this is why the Bible could say two will be in the bed one taken one left right it's a it's an individual Affair now I do believe collectively we are baptized individually and we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ so a Christian Christian's not a tool the prophet would reference said like this it's not a a tool of some mechanical organization but he said a Christian is to be Christlike and a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man and the life of Christ in him then it produces the life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did now watch just how very simple he says this he says what am I talking about is a personal relationship to Christ and what is it is your life worthy of the Gospel now even a relationship itself when we think of that word a relationship it's where where you have two or more uh objects people so forth that are connected but there's a way of being connected when God speaks of a relationship he's speaking of himself dwelling in US amen remember the Bible says many Matthew 7 will come to me on that day and say have we not preached in thy name cast out devils in thy name spoke with tongues and he will say depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you never had a relationship yet they were Anointed with a genuine spirit of God but they never submitted to it right so a relationship is like when you think of it and I please bear with me a moment but you know there's sometimes where there's things uh uh parts of your body that you can lose as you age or an accident so let's say somebody loses a leg well then you know thankfully they have things now that they can give you a prosthetic leg and you can put that on but that leg is not a part of you you can take that leg off and lay it down it's something that if you decide I want to go to the kitchen and leave that in there or whatever more or for anybody that has false teeth you can take them out and just leave them there in the bathroom or next to your bed and go anywhere you want but you don't do that with your teeth that's come in you you can't do that with your leg your original leg wherever you go it's there so it's not just connected because connected things can be laid down or laid as side but the Bible said the marriage of the Lamb has come it is a union in other words it's not what we take off and put on but there is a union we don't want to just be the false teeth we don't want to just be the tupe or the prostetic leg we want to be a member of his body by spiritual birth and the Bible says by one Spirit we are all baptized into this body is that right so this is where the Lord Jesus as he would speak of the coming of the Holy Spirit he would spend the time to express to the Believers of what was coming in John 14:15 he says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever don't you see if you love me and this is to to me what is incredible because this love right here is not our love and yet his love coming fully in is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you know for you and I to even move in the direction of the word and to even repent it has to be his love reaching out and influencing us for us to recognize not just that I'm wrong he's right he's what I want he's my desire if you love me keep my commandments so it's God working to bring his children to their rightful place and as think of this as you're yielding to the spirit of God it doesn't matter it doesn't matter right now where you're at here this morning but if you'll take this consolation what matters is is keep moving in the word and as you're moving in the word the spirit of God is interceding on your behalf I will pray the comforter Hallelujah my my my my my and he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth so notice he's the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you there he was standing in a Corporal body identifying himself as the god of Truth the spirit of Truth and he says in verse 26 the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance and whatsoever I have said unto you this is what he becomes he not only guides you into a place and brings you to a place of birth but then he will teach you and guide you and he will work in your life to bring you from infancy into full maturity we have received the spirit of adoption which leads us to full sunship amen hallelujah hallelujah it's the privilege of having the tutor within us verse 26 of John 15 when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and in verse 27 and ye also shall bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning So Not only would those who were chosen ordained with Witnesses when the resurrection would come and the life of the comforter the spirit of truth that was dwelling in behind the veil of the Corporal body almighty God would now come into their lives and their lives would also be a witness and a testimony by the transformation in their lives that the sacrifice the atonement has been made I was included and I have received the necessary Authority and power to rise as a son and daughter of God you become a witness in this hour the spirit of God coming to you is a present day witness of the mercy of God you become a present day witness of that day on Calvary hallelujah hallelujah John 16:13 I know these might seem redundant but Jesus spent much time because this was the purpose that he came for is to restore that relationship between God and man hallelujah how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come this is what he'll do he will guide you into all truth hallelujah for he shall speak of himself and whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he'll show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you so he will not glorify an idea he will not glorify a Creed he will not glorify our ideas he will only glorify himself and he is the word all things that the father hath our mind therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you so to live a worthy life of the Gospel is to live a life where it is absolutely displaying God's own life amen where it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me this is why the prophet could say the only way to live a worthy life how many want to live a worthy life okay is to let Christ notice to let Christ and his word which he is the word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and it returned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect his through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promised word in these Future Days so the only way that we can live a worthy life to me and I believe to the rest of us i i i rejoice in this because it's not my worthiness it's his worthiness and I don't say that Loosely we we should understand it's not said Loosely that we just go and live any life that we want to live that's that shows you haven't received God's grace when you've received God's grace then you are so appreciative of what he has done for you and done in your life that you gladly want to please him and do what he said do because the grace you received is the comforter is the spirit of truth you're no longer left as an orphan amen you're no longer left in a state of wondering but the spirit of God has come down and claimed you as one of his own Hallelujah and the spirit of Truth is there as the grace of God to lead us and direct us into all the word and I'm not just talking about the Mysteries I'm talking about every purpose and all that God desires to bring forth out of your life amen because it's a personal relationship is that right Hallelujah so here there's no other way a Christian of today is to receive Christ into our lives amen let his word be the truth place it in our heart and and that the fruit of the spirit upon us and fulfilling every promise that he's made because he don't have no other hands but your hands and mine he don't have no other feet but our feet the Bible said he said I'm the vine you're the branches so I want to just say it to you like this I've taken a little bit of a of a journey to get here even to let lay down my title that don't mean I'm going to be much longer but what I want to lay down to you is just the thought of priorities and excuses right and I want to speak just a few moments on that of priorities and excuses now that's not I I I just I had to lay some of that in before I would give it and I want to just say this right here in this hour we are living in a time just as down Through the Ages but in this hour here we I'm not responsible and neither are you for for for back there in isua Street Pentecost I'm not responsible for Wesley back there or or Luther but what we are responsible for is the message that has come in our day in our generation and the message itself is not books it's not tapes but the message is Christ himself it's him coming in and producing and living out his own life because the Church of the Living God you and I are the womb of allmighty God that betting ground that his word will find that's ferle in this hour that will not kill his working that will not kill his word that will not abort his ways but a womb that will say Lord let my life bring forth Jesus Christ I don't want to alter him I don't want a surgery before it's born and somehow alter this DNA I want to Bear Jesus Christ just in a density just in incidentally so you would understand even in this that's not a onot deal and done that's an ongoing desire in the life and a relationship between a husband and a wife that's why the prophet could stand at the end of the Statue of a perfect man he said I pledge this morning until he said I will see every one of these virtues moving through this little old stature of mine he said I don't care if I don't maintain my house don't maintain my family don't maintain my job he said there's one thing I want to maintain and that's Jesus Christ Hallelujah I'm telling you this message was delivered with an urgency a relationship it's a priority am there's a lot of things we can make priorities but when it comes down to it what really matters is is looking at have we made God's priority our priority that's what matters we have a choice then the and the priority is in this hour is the rapture that's the priority for my life that's the priority for my family that's the priority for this church Brother Sam you ought to let up a little bit I can't it's burning in my heart the priority of this hour hallu I might have to step on your toes but say out show me thank you Lord God for dealing with my life we don't want to become a soft easy lazy Lal seeing group of people am that even though everything that takes place is they're worked up into a frenzy or they're given some intellectual pet talk to massage the psyche of their mind you need something that will resonate in the depths of your soul and'll change your life from Death To Life it'll give you a backbone it'll give you a hire in your life to please the Lord and to serve the Lord that's what this supper does [Applause] [Music] hall hallelujah hallelujah we don't want forms forms of godliness Hallelujah I want to just let me read this quote to you the message love this I've just been meditating on this one for weeks love it's got to be God's love friends it can't it listen it can't be just our love our love will not our love will never meet the Mark it's got to take God's love and the only way that comes is by the Holy Ghost and the only way that that love comes to the place that God ordained it to be is through US submitting to even when we have received it and asking God and yielding to that word until it comes to a complete perfection in us are you hearing me look at this love makes you do things and when the church gets the real love of God in their heart they'll do things they'll not be ashamed watch this Christ doesn't want you know he he he's it's not so much to be loyal I want you to listen these words Christ is not after to you be to be loyal he doesn't want your patronage I think brother Dan daisley he's gone home to be with the Lord but I never forget the statements he would make you know brother Dan they had Wednesday night service and two on Sunday and brother Dan said you know he said the the people he says that U you know that love love the church come on Sunday morning the people he said that love the pastor come on Sunday night and the people who love God come on Wednesday come on now oh brother Samuel you know all we need to do is show our stand for the resurrection you're not following the word there's too many quotes when the prophet talks about laying out a church and missing church he talks about when other things get ahead of the prayer meeting come on oh Sam I don't want watch I Love Lucy good I hope you don't watch Susie either but anything you put before the word of God and assembling yourselves together is a priority that's out of line that's right now I want you to understand listen friends because there's some things we can make certain modifications we oh you know I'm let's just say about that about coming to the house of God oh I I really got to start coming to the house of God but you got to see there's a symptom what is it that has caused that or allowed you to get to that place to where it doesn't matter if you're here or not you don't care and you can say well I'll catch it later on I'll archive it you need to look at a symptom don't just look at what's here what is it is there something in my life that I haven't received is it something that I've left my first love it's evaluation time well just think in a little bit we'll be able to shake hands over [Laughter] dinner I love the Simplicity I love the Simplicity of this statement it isn't so much to be loyal he don't want your patronage now I believe if there's something in your heart you'll be loyal to Christ but it's not just being loyal to a church it's being loyal to him even when you're outside of church in every situation you're loyal to him because I am his witness I am his representative the longer you serve God the more mindful you become of that that's part of maturity in your life that's right that's why there's certain things that you watch as you'll submit God can correct you even on certain things things maybe from the job or this or that but you what you say well God corrected me listen the only one that can be corrected is the spirit of God if it's not a child of God it'll Buck at it and kick back at it and well you don't understand what they done to me you don't understand this but if it's a child of God when the spirit of God points out wrong it doesn't matter who's done wrong they might have been wrong wrong is wrong but if the spirit of God it out there is a heart on the inside and the spirit of Truth has brought forth a child a lamb that's able to be led he know he want this is what he wants your fellowship that's what God wants us to have fellowship with you that's what that's what his desire is that's right let me just look at this just for a few moments here on excuses you know what an excuse is sometimes we look for them now let me just so I can ease you a little bit sometimes if we don't want to go somewhere oh my oh I see there snow coming in the forecast go I I I think it's probably best that I don't go but you see that becomes an excuse but that's not the real reason that's only a covering for the real reason when the Lord Jesus is speaking of this Parable let's just look at it here for a moment they were being invited Israel was being invited to a spiritual Feast Pentecost they were being invited to the place to where God the spirit of Truth would Unite with man in a real Union and they rejected it is that right they turned it down notice the prophet has says how that they turned down the spiritual Feast Brianna go to that uh quote 39 there and I'm just going to read the last part if I the last part on there where I have those asteris notice he says they the spiritual Feast of the Lord and they won't do it they don't want to do it that's that's the first thing it it they don't want to do it they've got other things to do and they find excuses so they have other things things and they prioritize that over what's the most important thing notice if they would have accepted brother Bram goes on to say if they would have just accepted that but he says then 2000 years ago Israel turned down the invitation to come to the wedding supper they turned it down and went into judgment but as Jesus said they stoned and killed the prophets that was sent to him by making excuses and now the excuses they made in each day so the influencer of excuses has never stopped it's still there and I want to just say there's nothing more important than the day of visitation of the word of God there's nothing I I can say this very clearly there's nothing in your life right now that's more important than entertaining Jesus Christ nothing is more important there no matter what it might be nothing is more important than entertaining him Hallelujah this is why when the Bible could say of a certain man you know here in in Luke 9 I I'm just going to have to phrase to these paraphrase some of these he said Lord I'll follow you wheresoever you go Jesus said the foxes have holes birds of the air have Nest but the son of man hath not where to lay his head and another said follow me and he said to another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father Jesus said let the dead bury the bad dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God my Lord it sounds like he don't care it's deeper he's letting them know don't let put anything before obedience to the voice of God no matter how close the tie is another said Lord I'll follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and Jesus Jesus said no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God it's there's only one way it's forward and when the Lord Jesus is expressing this right here you if you read in the T days of Elisha remember in the days of Elisha Elisha it looks very much that it's it's contrasting this scripture right here because in the days of Elisha he you know he he burnt everything he burnt the plow and everything else then he offered up The Oxen and then he went and followed but it's saying the same thing don't let anything be undone don't let anything hinder you in obeying the Lord hallelujah you know these things right here we've read even in the opening part of the supper you know I've got oxen I need to break in I've got a piece of land I need to get ready I've just married wife there a lot of scriptures these individuals could could even pull up places from the Old Testament but I want to just tell you that there is none of these things even what we read here a person's father died and he wants to go bury him a person that you know let me go let me just go tell the people in my home farewell you can look at that and say what's evil about that there's nothing evil about it are you hearing me now there's nothing evil about it it is isn't altogether evil but it is something that is getting in the way of obeying God in Luke chapter 17 the day we're living in right here in this hour as a compound hour as it was in the days of lot right as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man is that right what did they do they did eat and they drink now you know there's nothing wrong with the eating and drinking you you've got to have certain Necessities to sustain your life is that right and they builded houses they married wasn't nothing wrong with somebody getting married although they did have the given in marriage right right living as though they were married which is wrong it's sin is that right that's called fornication living outside of the marriage covenant my my how do we get here that's why listen this is why that we do not believe in that and according to to God's word that is the Bible said it's not good for a man to touch a woman that's why we don't kiss around be the first kiss is right here at the altar come on now we don't try one another out and see if we can kiss good I'm going to preach it wrong we're not here to treat and see about this and let's see if this works out come on friends that's the way the world does things but you have an access to pray and ask God for his will for you [Music] life because if you've really been redeemed you don't want your own choice you want God's choice because anything outside of that of living any other kind of life is a life of fornication Hallelujah now look at the days of lot they ate drank bought sold planted builded verse 28 they you know those things are not not allog together evil but what it is they become occupied with the cares of Life they were so occupied that God's day of visitation and their opportunity went right by them they were so wrapped up in I wonder how many of them said you know what next weekend I'm going to make some preparation but then something would come up oh this field oh this field what's going on Weeds are coming up that's called distractions that's called putting that when that priority becomes above the priority of obeying God's word don't ever expect the crop to flourish you can't go disobedient to God's word and expect the crop to flourish is that all right well the amens are getting fewer and fewer but even thus shall it be when the son of man is revealed notice let me just say it like this when we when we look at this of Disobedience there is an order there is an order of priority and the prophet would say this clear I believe from 1959 he would pick it up in 1963 again and tell us that the order of overcoming is God first that's just not our thought but that's his word my heart says Amen to every word of God it's not making excuses or exceptions for the word of God Oho boy this is tight I can go slower that's first the second is family and others and your last selfish laugh that's the order of overcoming because that's what he did think of the Lord Jesus God come down and become one of us he put obedience to the father's word above everything else when they told him Lazarus has died come on down here he wouldn't go until he had the word from the father even when John said hey I need to be baptized to you he said suffer it to be so it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he put the word of God first when he was tempted and was hungry turn these stones in the bread he put God's word before his own desires are you with me now then when in that would not stick he's taken upon a temple and he said cast thyself down in other words offered Supernatural gifts but he took the father's word amen that's the truth come on now he took the father's word now let me move to the second place the family he put his family he put the family of God not above the word of God but he put the family next he put others next he even looked upon the multitude that were hungry and said we need to feed him he looked at the ones who were sick those who were there when he came down to the pool of Bethesda and he stepped over this one this one this one to get to that man that laid there he put others before himself he was last so much so that the greatest victory that was won was in Gethsemane nevertheless not my will thine will be done and he did that that we might be partakers of his life the Bible said remember Lot's wife look at these words Luke 17:32 three words remember Lot's wife so Jesus wants us to remember something now one of the things that's very interesting within it even when you read Scholars and different things like that is within it because when you remember she would they were given a word to depart and lot lot could have went anywhere you realize this lot could have went anywhere lot could have said I want to go back down to where my uncle's at but he left from where his uncle was at you know why it was too straight it was too hard he didn't want to live that way he didn't want his family brought under I don't want my family brought under that judgment I don't want to be judged listen if the word comes to judge something in our lives it's for our good amen we'll either allow the Judgment of the word to pass upon our life now or we'll stand there on that day and have to answer why we spurned the spirit of Grace I want you to think of this lot if you could talk to him today lot did you realize what it was going to cost you when you made that decision and said this is too much this is this is too much I mean here we are Barren land all this is around here what's he doing relying on reasoning and you know what when you want to find something listen to me very carefully that's why if you don't come to a place of a real birth in Jesus Christ you'll find somewhere you'll find some church you'll find some theology that'll fit what you desire you'll find it but I want to thank lot I wonder if we could talk to him today lot what happened I just started out with facing my tent in the wrong way before I know it I'm the mayor in I'm the mayor in Sodom you see sin will overtake you just like that you don't have limiters on it it's not like the microphone that they have compressors on me limiters on how much can come out it's not how it is sin you can't limit it sin you can't control it there's only one thing and that's to receive and yield to the spirit of God on the inside remember Lot's wife what did she do they were told and lot didn't say let me go down to my uncles he said let me go over here over to or is it zone or zor let me go over here actually means a land of wandering let me go over here instead of going to the place he knew he could get help sometimes people know the place they need help and they know they need help but their own Pride keeps them back from it let me tell you something that is only a trick of the enemy that pride is a awful hoty ungodly spirit that wants to keep you back from the real life that God has for you Hallelujah remember Lot's wife brother Brown tells us like this he says what she did he says lot act Lot's wife actually he said had more of an excuse than what many of us would have because she turned because she heard her children and grandchildren screaming from the Flames shows you that they had some kids that were there not just the two that went out with them what was it her family well you say brother Samuel surely surely surely you mean God would hold that if anything keeps you back from believing one word of God it can keep you out of the Rapture it'll keep you out of a Victorious Life One Word all she did was turn and look back she didn't even start walking backwards but you know what it was she started out as an overcomer she had left Sodom come out to follow the message but she never got it in her heart her heart was still tied back there and that's why she turned back listen friends this is a moment of evaluation when listen this isn't just something of saying well I need a fresh refilling of the spirit of God we do need refilling of the spirit of God but you also have to consider and look at it have I received the real necessary experience that God promised in this hour where the love of God would burn in my heart for Him and for his word oh God help us I tell you friends this is my priority yes amen I don't care if you get mad at me I don't care if you get upset at me but you'll thank me if you stand with me there on the other side Hallelujah and matter of fact you'll pray for me even right now Lord God don't let him cut no corners Lord don't let him take no ways Lord I want to stand there on that day Lord why because that's your priority my priority it's the priority that Jesus Christ would be preeminent in our lives I don't want to make excuses for it hallu this is where you have even the 10 spies I'm coming down the 10 spies that went over familiar story we're here we we hear but these spies went over with Joshua and Caleb now Joshua and Caleb had just as much family as they did right but they went over there and they saw the obstacles that was before him and when they saw the obstacles immediately when they came back they brought up an evil report and when they brought up that evil report notice what they did in numbers 14 they put the blame on their families if we go over there our wives and our children are going to be prayed you know why they could say it that way because they didn't know God that's right they didn't trust God they didn't love God oh you know friends think about think about how many people listen I've long enough to hear where people say I don't want my kids around that Doom and Gloom message Doom and Gloom the coming of the Lord is upon us but you see what it is if you don't have the token yourself it's hard to believe for the supernatural for your family that's right but when you have experienced the supernatural I'm not talking about gifts I'm not talking about prophesying I'm not talking about shouting I'm talking about the supernatural that changes your nature amen that's what I'm talking about that'll align you with the word of God that'll tame you from a wild man to a lamb that's what I'm talking about amen but it's presented to every one of us and it's incredible how what they said they said let us make a captain and go back to Egypt so it wasn't that they didn't want leadership it's just they didn't want the leadership of the hour right they didn't want the leadership of the word they didn't want God's provided way you know what they forsook they forsook every blessing of God they forsook the blessing of God for their own lives and for their families they made a choice for their own desires true and they made for their own unbelief they made their families their excuse oh brother Samuel I tell you I ain't going back to this this church or I ain't going back to this church be careful that you're not making somebody else and what's happened an excuse oh brother Samuel this just this just so disappointed me this just listen to me tell you something how do you know it's an excuse you know it's an excuse whether or not your life continues to tally up with the word of God or not if it doesn't tally up with the word of God you've got a homemade excuse and it's an excuse that'll keep you from the life and it'll keep you out of the rapture the Rapture is the most important event right now and the only way going into a Rapture is to have the Seal of the Living God and when you have the Seal of the Living God you don't become a complacent bystander that's like sitting on the plane waiting for everybody else to go on remember when the spirit of God comes into your life he starts like a small white button the prophet said in this same message he said he comes into your life he said about the size of the fingernail and he grows pushing out all unbelief he pushes out and I love how the prophet says it he says the more that you can yield to the spirit of God the more you'll become unman unsner likee and the more Godlike that's the promise I will walk in my people you love him may God help us the Bible says there's a way that seeth right to man but the end thereof is the ways of death right even of times to look the Bible said a prudent man looks a far off and considers his ways the decisions made today what will it lead to tomorrow you know when that trumpet would be sounded in the land of Israel when they heard it it was their opportunity to go free now the Bible tells us and I'm closing here that if a man was come into a Hebrew servant was come into slavery because he owed a debt and if he came in there by himself he could only leave by himself but if he came in there with his wife then they both left together so whatever accumulated through that time of bondage his master would say hey here's a here's a here's a woman here's here's one could be your wife and he marries that woman while in slavery then there's children you know what the enemy is doing he's setting him up to put a hold on his life Satan listen friends if you if there is something let me just understand me if there's something something in your heart that's not moved for your family then something's wrong but if that if you allow that to determine whether you will fully obey the word of God then you're wrong are you hearing me and here here was here was the whole sound that man when the trumpet sounded he could go out but the wife that he married in there and the children brother Samuel what are you saying are that my husband or that my wife what I'm saying is is that whatever happen has come from the world cannot come into Christ can God bring a whole family in sure there's Witnesses right here but you see what the enemy will do is to put things that'll put a hold upon people how many people have you seen I know how many I know people that I've watched and witnessed even advised don't get married don't do this don't do that and they'll go ahead and do it and they're no longer here why value of a wife life or brother the Sam are you saying somebody's not I'm not saying nobody is elect or non-elect I'm just saying for right now right now is an opportunity right now is a serious moment right now for every decision that we make but to look at some how things can become such a place that would pull upon a person's heartstrings that people will actually relinquish their stand with God for flesh let me ask you how can you help your family if you're not standing where you need to stand it's like a man standing on a slippery slope and wanting to pull somebody else out that's drowned you need to get your feet on Solid Ground you need to get your life grounded in the word of God lord I I want to be a lot I want to be a help then first let your life be grounded in the things of God let God work through your life and say Lord I just want to be an instrument let God work through you then let him have the rideway let him have the all within your life let him have everything and even when it comes down to things in our life that he'll touch in our life you don't want to make excuses for it right I'm like this because my daddy that's an excuse oh brother Samuel I've heard people tell me and say brother Samuel I tell you what I you know I would come there but it's kind of hard you know for coming there because of so so and I just tell them just like the prophet said that's an excuse the prophet said when you say something like that you're more than a hypocrite then what the person who's there that's pretty straight but that's the truth you see there's no excuse there'll be no excuse accepted on that day God's not accepting any excuse right now well Lord I I would go there or I would do this or I would do that there's no excuse It's a mou between you and God it's God changing your life not your dad changing your life life not your mama changing your life it is about you and God personally and you ought to have such a Resolute that if Mama don't go if Mama don't get in line I'm going to serve God if my husband don't my wife don't whatever I'm going to serve God with all that's within me I'm going to stay there if I don't have the Holy Ghost I'm going to stay there till God fills me that's going to become my number one priority not more hours on the job more hour this more Ambitions here that's my priority to be filled with his life and when you get filled with his life then he becomes your all priority decisions you'll make then will be based upon him first am and anytime you get away from that you'll get corrected priorities and excuses we want to have the right priorities right well brother Samuel I've got a job or I've got let me tell you something friends if you've got a desire to serve God and there's something right now that's keeping you away or it seems it's in the way don't nurse that thing right begin to call on God and ask God to move for you but you know what God might ask something out of you to see how Resolute are you right now listen friends we can all say well if it was if I had this if I had this how many times there's been times I've prayed for people they've asked me to pray for them so they could be in the house of God on Thursday nights I'm just speaking plain right that's and I need a job I need this or I this and it don't happen let me tell you something it's not about what you'll do when you get there or when I get this or when I get that it's about what are you doing with what what you have now what are you doing with your time and your life that you have now because if things if you're not serious with where you're at now and willing to dedicate where you're at right now and sacrifice everything you could have every day of the week off that's right it's priorities Lord we don't want no excuses I don't want I don't want one finger to be pointed to me on that day and say Lord I would have but he didn't tell me that's right I love you too much for that but most importantly I love him and then that lets me love you the right way right even when I have to set my children down and I've had over the years I don't cut no corners right we talk straight I'm not talking about being arrogant I'm talking about straight listen friends we need an hour hour right now of straightness this is an hour where things have been so blurred the lines are so blurred this is an hour where the word there needs to be such straightness and Clarity why because you got to make a clearcut decision amen and I'm telling you this morning if you're here and you're without the Holy Spirit you need to make that the priority of your life I don't care how long you've known this message I don't care how long you've been around it I don't care if you spoke in tongues I don't care if you prophesied I don't care if you prayed for the sick I'm asking you if you don't have the Holy Ghost or a life that'll line up with a word you make sure that your life lines up with a word where everything will punctuated with an amen is that your desire Hallelujah let that be the priority the priority is Rapture you know what that means every decision I make it may it means how will this affect everything around me how will this affect me you watch you start making listen let let God say God put it in here Lord Let It Drop In Here Lord let everything let there be a Revival strike because you know what Revival does it flushes out all the trash maybe there's things that I've accumulated in my life Lord that's hindering me lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset you and let us run this race amen it's not enough to know that well I know Jesus Christ I I believe on the Lord Jesus Christ or I believe brother 's a prophet it's to know him that's what this message is about it's to know him in a personal relationship by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can know the word you can know every letter you can know every word you can know every dip thong you can know everything and still miss it you've got to know the author Hallelujah that's what's important is to know him and I pray I'm finished I've been finished but I pray that this word may it not depart out of our hearts I pray that even as we would leave from this place here in a in some short time I pray may it not depart May there not be one rest that strikes your heart until you've experienced that rest with Jesus Christ amen that's what's important yes that's what matters don't let family hold you back don't let anybody hold you back it's between you and God if any man hear my voice and will open the door I will come in and S with him and he with me and you know as you as you are being partaken notice what does he do he does to you like he did to Abraham he gave Abraham the bread and the wine right that's what he did on the day of Pentecost and you know as we take that word in our life that that experience that Living Word when it starts out like that of a little the size of a fingernail little white button but as we take that word and eating that word what happens there's a growth taking place on the inside it's growing growing more and more into His Image you know it kind of becomes like a little boy that comes out there in the garage you know and they'll do things you know with you I don't mean to pick on Paul and Ben they came around the flow flower beds a little bit to a certain size but but Zach right here was always right there right behind my side and this guy would go out there and get tools in the guard in the garage and saw things and everything else and but he was always right out there you know how it is sometimes where a little boy or or maybe sometimes even a little girl get right next to and they see what Daddy's doing or they see what mama's doing and you'll catch them they have their baby doll and they're they're putting it in a certain way and putting you know the blanket around it or here the little boy will get he'll get that Hammer you're like no no no no not the real one here take the Fisher Price one instead you know what it is they're only they're only trying and just to to do what the image that's been set before them that's why it's important we want the Right image set before us we want Christ set before us we want Christ in US set before our families because let me tell you no matter what hurts what strains what complexes whatever we've experienced we don't have to have it passed on huj there's a God who's present that can break that curse that can break that hold that can break that claim Hallelujah hallu That's The Power of eating this supper hallelujah hallelujah love him let it be your full full priority let nothing else get in your way the Rapture is my priority let me tell you when that's your priority it'll show up in your everyday life it'll show up when it's time for church it'll show up when it comes to a decision of saying should I wear this or should I not wear that should I do it'll become your priority it will rain in your life and you watch the things that you have struggled with as you yield to the word the spirit of God will give you Grace to overcome and the things that have tormented you haunted you you will one day stand there and say it bothers me no more I'm [Applause] free that's the power of the supper Hallelujah h my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink [Applause] indeed that's B heads Heavenly Father Lord you knowall the burden Lord that I've carried even when I woke up this morning and I asked you Lord are you sure this is what you want Lord for today L Lord never wanting to be in the way or get in the way but just wanting to minister I'm not interested in preaching to the people I want to minister to them Lord minister to the needs minister to where we're at but Lord I'm here just to be a servant we're here to serve you Lord together Lord God I pray father may you Lord as you've come by your spirit to speak to our hearts may that be Lord God now the full priority if there's one Heart Lord that has placed other things maybe they've placed hurts maybe there's things that they know right now that's not the real reason I've only used that as an excuse but may they receive the grace to cast that excuse aside may they take that Lord and say I am not going to make that an excuse that's only Satan trying to keep me from what God God has for me granted Lord may you move Lord I pray father for the needs Lord that are right here Among Us Lord God lives that need the Holy Spirit need a real relationship not a church life not something Lord that we're just gathered around a group of people but where we have a personal individual experience and relationship with you Lord where we know you as Paul said in the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings and where that life Lord Burns within our hearts I pray dear God that you'll break back every Veil Lord every spiritual Veil Lord every unclean Spirit Lord God that would try to take the word and try to turn it and twist it Lord for it to be something Lord that you've never intended for it to be may you break every Veil Lord as you did on that Easter morning Lord you cut through every veil of fear every every veil of worry you cut through every Veil Lord God that Lord had the veiled Lord you from your children Lord you ascended on high and sent back the Holy Ghost Lord I pray this morning may that priority drop may it become Lord the priority in a heart in a life just say I need my life I don't want to try to make something of my life I want to put it in God's hands amen I want God I want him to build build a memorial in my life to his resurrection to his glory to his present day working oh God grant it Lord that's the priority Lord It's The Rapture Lord we see the wickedness we see the vness that's all around us oh God I don't want to stay here oh Jesus I want to stay here Lord Lord I I want to be found here I Want to Be With You Lord that's how I feel Lord sometimes Lord you know and I know I'm speaking to other believers as well sometimes Lord it seems like that maybe if I've got certain plans and then certain unexpected things can happen in the day and it just don't feel right I need to talk to you I need to talk to you oh it isn't that I got to get down on my knees prayer is not a position of my body it's my heart oh Lord God I want to be where you're at I want to be in step with you [Music] Lord how can my family be in step with you if I'm in step with them and out of step with you but Lord God in order for my family in order for this church I've got to be in step with you Lord you know the burden Lord that I feel on my heart walk up and down these these hours Lord of a week when I'm here at the office up and down these pews praying Lord God grant it Lord Oh Lord God May there not be one Heart Lord that would look at it in a way of any harshness yet Lord love is corrective Lord God you know when we need correction times we need to repent not just the sinner Lord but there's times Lord in our life Lord as we're called to repentance maybe it's not even something we've even said out loud but a way that we've Act Ed from a wrong motivation on the inside oh God help us Lord I pray God May Lord lives and hearts Lord vessels Lord be open to your presence Lord may you pour down lord God into lives and hearts vessels Lord that are poured out and open to you to say Lord I want to be filled with your spirit I want to be filled with your life as every head is bowed I wonder how many hands would go up across the building and say Lord that's what I want hallu maybe you want a refilling the same one who feels also gives refilling as well make God grant it may the Holy Spirit Grant it to your heart is there there one here that's never surrendered your life to the Lord Jesus Christ and you want to surrender here and say Lord I want to give my life to you I've kept it and I've been the one working on it but what a mess it is I want to put it in your hands Lord you'll never find any satisfaction in any marriage you'll never find satisfaction in a job you'll never find satisfaction in money the only place of real satisfaction is in Jesus Christ that's the only one that can satisfy your life Hallelujah that's a scripture when they asked Peter that day what must we do to be saved he said repent that means to confess your wrong and turn from it and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that's what this baptismal tank is up here for is to take upon his name be identified and and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you've not walked into the Waters of baptism given your life to the Lord that's where you're at right now hallelu let's take these needs before Him Father Lord God what a moment Lord lives the Lord Jesus with one purpose there's one desire hearts Lord to be surrendered to you lives Lord God vessels to be filled with your spirit Lord Lord God to where you come and you take away the desire for the things of the world Lord when the new birth is come though we walk in this same flesh that we have now become United with the real family tree and that we are closer to you than we are to our natural family because we've been born again our desires have changed now Lord as you spoke your word Lord for hearts and lives and where the hands have been lifted up that Lord I want to be filled with your spirit I want my life to be a consecrated life to you I pray that God you would come down burn out every desire Lord burn out everything that's unlike you Lord God may your Holy Spirit Lord just move Lord in such a place may they look to you not look to their own attempts their own trying their own failings but may they look to the God who has spoke to them Lord God and knocked at their heart's door Lord may they Lord God draw their Confidence from your voice as they've invited you in granted Lord may they not rest day or night may that be the priority until they see and have that rest within that they're identified with you Lord there were other hands my hands Lord I had both of mine up I want a fresh refilling Lord one thing that I have found is that's what I need not just once a month I need it very often Hallelujah I need a refilling Lord because Lord that refilling keeps the stickers from being sticky that refilling like your Prophet when he put it in the message ashamed he said we must stay in his presence in the spirit of God if we don't we start to get dry that's when we start to get complainy that's when we start start to get all these other things Lord God grant it this morning Lord a refreshing from the presence of the Lord oh Lord God a refreshing or to where anything that's come into a life that's hindered May the spirit of God just move and washing everything all the trash up onto the shore Lord these are your children we are your children father these people Lord my brothers and sisters they've not come here they could have had other things that they could have done today but they've come here I believe they love you Lord I believe they love you like I love you they Lord the desire it even shows Lord God may you take us on take us deeper Lord in every one of our lives a relationship just like a relationship between a husband and a wife your Prophet said just like that love would grow between a husband and a wife he said that's the the way that Faith grows between you and God it grows and grows and grows Lord Jesus Grant it in our lives Lord or those that are sick in their body not able to be here others that might be sitting here and sick would you touch them Lord touch those Lord that's been suffering Lord some even from operations and procedures they've had done Lord father even the pain to be able to sit Lord I'm asking God that you would just move down for them Lord may you just touch them Lord let them know your love and care oh God granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen could we stand Hallelujah if you'd like prayer this morning you know we'd be happy to pray with you if you got a need on your heart and I know we got the dinner planned and I I know we have that plan but this is what's more important that that can wait out there I I don't listen I don't I don't mind if I got to eat cold chicken even if I had to eat cold rice cuz I've done that but I don't want to miss what God has for me I don't want to miss what God has for us do you this this is what's more important this supper is more important than that supper what a privilege in this hour what a privilege even from a young person to an old person a life where the spirit of God can come down and give strength to cause young people to live an overcoming life it can take middle-age old all and give a real power on the inside it's a love affair there's many quotes that I know there's many that I read but if there's one that you remember remember the one where he says God does not it's not about our loyalty or our patronage he wants our fellowship because you know what when it's just loyalty or patronage that's about us that's about when we feel when we feel what we like it's like you go to your favorite restaurant until they're no longer your favorite restaurant let things start changing all of a sudden what you think about changes right I know I know some of you no longer go to some of the same restaurants what was that patronage but when there's a love affair a love he wants us that we would love him not with our own love but with his love to say Lord I Want to Love You But Let It Be Your Love Lord your love that's what he provided that's what Calvary provided that we might have that Fellowship because a fellowship ship is even when things ain't going the way we want it to go when there's a dry time or a cool time in the church you're still in love with [Music] him cuz the prophet told us he said God will allow depressing times to come around us he'll allow cool times he said to even come in the church to see what are you going to do about it he'll allow it and that's where we want to stand is mature sons of go Sons and Daughters of God say Lord make me more like you let's worship him here go ahead brother Brian Le draw me close to [Music] you never let me go I lay it all
