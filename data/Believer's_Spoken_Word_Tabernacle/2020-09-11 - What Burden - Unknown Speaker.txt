[Music] i see what you are [Music] nothing compares to [Music] amen that's the truth isn't it it meant nothing compares to the promise that we have in him amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord tonight and good to see each and every one of you and i just want to remind you the services here on sunday lord willing at 11 and then at 6 00 p.m tried to give a little space in there and i know it's a you know it's a great sacrifice to do that on sunday with the two services but we have brother andrew here with us and we just kind of set this aside and we're living you know we are here in some very peculiar times and so trying to you know to do and trying to find the mind of the lord through the time i i certainly believe that god can do everything he wants to do in one service but i i just think this is a we just said it as a special time you know when god came down into sent moses down into egypt and he the first thing that he went to pharaoh with he said you let my people come out three days journey into the wilderness and worship me the whole focus within the deliverance was to be able to worship god the theme within the message of that of the exodus was let my son go that he can serve me we realize that god calls for more than just a worship on two days or one day or however many days of the week but our lives are to be a worship every day of our lives unto him and all that we do and all that we say it's to glorify the name of the lord jesus so i just want to say we just so appreciate brother andrew being able to come here and be with us and let's just be in prayer and let's just expect to receive from the lord we're not coming even as we come tonight we haven't come as spectators we haven't come just to say well i just want to see and see what god's going to do but we come with intentions in our heart there's needs that we have right here tonight there's needs that we will have before us on if the lord tarries on sunday and god is mindful to meet and to minister to every one of our needs and so we just want to keep that before before the lord in prayer and just be looking to the lord for his mercy in this time i wonder if we just couldn't pray as we just go to the lord in prayer tonight and just ask his leadership and his blessing upon the word heavenly father lord we are certainly standing here tonight lord in need of your help lord it is so true that we can do nothing without you lord all of our greatest of efforts will fail lord the greatest intentions that we could have will fail lord when it's not channeled god in that proper channel so lord we would just ask tonight that you would just help us lord dear god the desire that we would have lord it's found in you we desire that you would be lifted up here tonight lord that you would take lord the words the inspiration of the thought lord that you've placed upon my heart and then lord that you would be the visible one right here among us lord god that you would visit lord every heart whether they're here whether they be streaming or we'll archive this service at another at another time lord i pray tonight knowing that your word has no boundaries oh god lord you're not restricted so lord in our hearts we're not going to restrict you we're not going to set any limitations we're just asking that god that you'll come lord by your spirit tonight through your word that you would speak to us in a real personal way lord i pray that you'll just lord take control now lord minister lord to our hearts we pray and we ask it all lord in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you turn with me to the book of jeremiah chapter 23 amen like to say i certainly welcome my uh my aunts here with me um certainly my my mom's sisters and uh my barbara my aunt marcel it's just really good to have them here and um they're they're visiting here with us just for a few days and it's the first time i i have i've seen them they just got in i think today and so we're just so glad to have them here with us and good glad to have each and every one of you amen i just want to look at a little something here that that the lord just really just seemed to really inspire to my heart and just look to him that he will bring it we've been looking at the thought here on on prophets and this will go around right along with it but i i i just this seems to be a focus that god would inspire us here to to look at here tonight so we're not off of that but yet in one way we're just looking at a thought here tonight out of verse 33 and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee say what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto them what burden and i will even forsake you saith the lord and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house thus shall you say every one to his neighbor and everyone to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken and the burden of the lord shall you mention no more for every man's word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god now remember they still had the law they still had all the traditions they still had what they thought was the word of the lord but remember as we've been looking at you can have the bible and not have the word of the lord the word of the lord comes to the prophets is that right and then it comes to that of of the believers now verse 37 thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken but since ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because you say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying you shall not say the burden of the lord therefore behold i even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city that i gave that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of and cast you out of my presence and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten i'd like to come back to that that verse of scripture in verse 33 and this is the thought i'd just like to look at out of here tonight what burden what burden may god bless the word and bless you as you're being seated tonight you're familiar if you're not perhaps you will be even as we go along in the service every time that god would visit his people and he would come and reveal his word to his prophets he would be that that man it was not something that he had he had within himself um a desire or was it a self-will or was it a self-made or made by any man but as a matter of fact every time that god would come to deal with his children it's because they had got out of line with the word of the lord and so god would send his word and reveal his word to it to his prophets and we find that there were major prophets before uh that of you know the junction of israel being dispersed and taken away we find as we've been looking at that a prophet is twofold it's a sign of judgment and it's also a sign of deliverance it just depends on your attitude and your approach to it and we find that when the word of the lord would come you find in the scriptures in the book of amos world say what it would say the burden of the word of the lord that had come to amos in the beginning of the book of malachi verse 1 he would talk about the burden of the word of the lord and when you look at the word burden there are many things that if i would even just to express that word to you tonight there is not one of us in here that would uh readily uh uh maybe think of the word burden in a positive way we would think of that as a load as a bearing as a weight as something that we in ourselves would not desire to do at all but yet when we when we look at the burden of the lord we recognize that it is not something that is going to be or trying to be nor is god dependent upon the self strength of man but god is simply depending on a yielded vessel that that burden that god has might be delivered to his people but god's burden now i want you to stay with me now the burden of the lord is not meant to be a weight it is not meant to be alone this word burden is meant to be a tribute or an uplifting you find that in this time there were prophets with uh priests and different ones and they in the time when judgment was coming they were prophesying to that of israel and saying peace and peace you find that with hananiah and the rest of them and and and remember how the spirit of god would say these individuals were not prophesying under the leadership of the holy spirit they were prophesying according to their own vain spirit in other words they did not have a seed of life that where they were ministering that would actually bring about a real reflection within a heart and life to consider where they're at you know deception is one of the worst things in the world because deception can cause a person to actually believe and to think and to feel that they are right when they're actually in the wrong the bible says there is a way that seemeth right unto man but the end thereof notice the end not just what we see or we feel right now but the end thereof are the ways of death the one thing we find always about the word of the lord when god comes to deal with our life we we recognize that the scriptures itself it takes the inspiration of the holy spirit to actually give sight or a vision to that of the word and when the holy spirit gets a hold of the word he not only will show us where we are where we're lacking but he will also show unto us where we are to go and yet if it was just us looking at that in our own humanness we would faint but we recognize the god that is coming and showing us where we are and showing us where we are to be it is the same god by inspiration that is able and will translate us from this place to where we ought to be so it all has to be a work of him that he would lift up our souls he would actually bring to our lives that that increase and the desire that he's calling for so when i look at this thought tonight and i think of that in the scripture what burden and and i think of that in terms of you know when these prophets were prophesying they were coming and they were uh coming in a manner as though that they were bearing the tribute or the uplifting of the soul that was quite quite the contrary their ministry was not lifting up the soul it was not removing sin it was not removing the condition of the people it wasn't checking them at all but on the contrary it was only telling them peace peace you know god loves you just continue on how you are you're the ancient city jerusalem you're the children of israel but what it is they had drifted from the word so these men were not packing the burden of the word of the lord but there was a burden that they were packing it was a burden that would add to the burden of bondage that the people were already under but aren't you glad that god comes god does not come to add upon the burden that is already there upon our life that we are born with but god comes to relieve that burden and release a real uplifting in our life that we can come back into the original state that god intended for you and i to be as sons and daughters of god now so when we look at this you know many times uh you know a person will look upon living a christian life as a burden but we recognize that when it looks to be burdensome that is because there's a heart that doesn't want to obey the voice of god they would rather hold to their own way and instead instead they are referring to god's way of mercy as a burden but the lord you know to them he's burdensome to them you know it's quite a contrast because you can take to some people they look at serving the lord that's what they have to give up and i got to stop this and i got to quit that but yet then when god deals with another heart you find that there are things that they just readily let go as god begins to deal with their life so with that same response it comes back to when a person can say oh my that burden of the lord but when god deals with your heart you begin to look at it and say what burden what is it that god is asking of me that's too great for me to release and give up what compares to him what burden so when we look at this we find even clear back there in the garden of eden you know when satan came there within that of the serpent as an upright beast he walked up there to eve and remember he presented to eve a gospel remember paul would pick this up how that satan would try to corrupt the simplicity of the true atonement of the gospel itself but yet how satan would come there and he would you know move in such a measure to tell eve god's keeping something back from you god is holding something back from you and yet there were things that god was keeping from her he was keeping death he was keeping sickness he was keeping sin he was keeping all those things from her but remember how satan began to move in at this particular time he presented it to her in a way as though you're under bondage you're bound up there's a burden upon your life but yet she was as free as free could be but you see it's how satan was putting a spin on the word in that hour he was taking what god had given to be protection and instead putting a spin on it that would cause her to want to forsake that word and to reach out beyond that i'll tell you what satan was really wanting to do he was not wanting to relieve her burden he was desiring to bring her into bondage and because of that fall remember now here you and i are in the midst of this situation there's not a person here of in this building or streaming or whatever we were not born righteous it doesn't matter if you had two holy ghost-filled parents we were born in sin shaping and iniquity we came to the world speaking lies as job said that a man born of a woman is a few days old and full of trouble this is why our first birth is corruption but that's why there had to be a way that we might be born again not entering into our mother's womb the second time but that there would be the spirit of life that would come to you and i that would actually be able to deal with the burden that was upon our life that would be actually able to lift that soul that was crying out for life to be able to lift it into the realms and the presence of the very righteousness of almighty god it would take almighty god himself coming to do that think of cain now when you look at cain here this product of this and how it came forth and we find that cain you know you find him you never find anybody that even would stand even satan himself that would even stand in the presence of god and spit god's word right back in his face remember here god reveals himself to abel abel does not know the correct offering to bring but remember god reveals to abel that there must be a lamb so what does it mean there was blood that took them out there in the eden so there must be blood life in order for them to enter back in and worship the bible says that abel retain obtained a witness whereby but he was righteous and when he offered that sacrifice now cain is beholding this from a farm now he's right there he's worshiping he's got his fruits his vegetables this guy is not a smart alec he has brought the very best to god he has brought you know he didn't bring out some of these vegetables they try to sell out to the market he didn't bring things with brown spots and all wilted and everything else this guy brought the very best now you and i would look at that and say oh my what a wonderful guy well you know cain no doubt he was a very wonderful guy remember when you look at esau and jacob esau was a much better man than jacob jacob was a saster he was a subplanter he was he was a deceiver i ain't talking about israel i'm talking about jacob when i'm talking about you i ain't talking about that first verse jacob i'm talking about that hidden one down on the inside that real israel that real seed germ of god that all it took is to get in the presence of almighty god and the very one that the promises were to becomes illuminated in that place cain sees this vindication there is no vindication on cain's altar he gets mad i've done all this everything i've done for you god look how i've labored look what i've done but you see his laboring never brought the presence of god cain could outwork abel 100 to 1 million to one but it's not about works according to our own abilities it's about being available and being open that god would speak to us that we can offer what god has provided for us to offer but cain despised that that vindication of the very presence of god coming there upon the altar and receiving able sacrifice and then you find how that cain would go on you know within that time he never humbled himself but instead when god look how god offers mercy to cain the mercy of god to cain would never change cain from being king but god said if you will worship as your brother does i'll accept you you see it those of god his mercy would reach out to it but cain cain would not accept that at all and instead we recognize that how it come that cain eventually he rose up against abel and he slew him and we find that within that and within that aspect of it we find that how that when god met him he came and he began to look and he tells cain the voice of your brother it cried from the ground and remember as soon as cain comes face to face once again with god he begins to just flatly come out and say who am i am i my brother's keeper watch his attitude toward the word that's searching him out the word is giving him mercy in order for the burden to be relieved but instead of receiving mercy cain has an attitude against the mercy of god now watch watch what takes place here when cain he asks when god you know unfolds how he knows what has taken place and then he begins to express all of this to cain remember what cain had said oh you lay on me a burden too great i can't bear this burden you lay on me too much oh my any man that sees me he'll want to kill me you know what you read in that whole verse it has nothing about a man or a lord we could say an individual that is actually seeking after the mercy of god it's simply all about them it has nothing to do with the mercy of god friends that's one of the sure signs that the mercy of god will pull away and is rejected is when there begins to be excuses and that of a person will try to stand against that let me just say this to you every one of us here even before those of us who were born again of the spirit of god it's the first nature that god had to come and deal with to where eventually we ourselves had a desire there was god moving in our hearts to where we got sick and tired of being ourselves we desired a real deliverance in our lives no doubt many of us we tried to reform ourselves we tried to do certain things and we found out self-reformation the fruits and works of man's hands will never bring the power of god down into a life but it takes accepting god's provided lamb his provided way and that brings down the spirit of almighty god so what burden when we look at this because you find within cain cain's worship had nothing to do with with that you know with with with self-surrender his his worship is will-worship you realize that's where many are at today it's will worship it's their own will into it now you might look at it and say well shouldn't we have our own will yeah you do have your own will god does not take from you your own will remember even with the lord jesus he has gone god came here in flesh in order to redeem us he never removed that will but that will was there but it was a will that was surrendered to the will of god because god himself will not pull us god himself will not push us he comes to lead us and he comes to lead us into a place of self-surrender so it's not will worship but it actually becomes self-will that surrendered to god's will now brother brown would pick this up here and i'm just just feeling pressed here in the message of how can overcome and he's dealing with this ladies and age that we're living in and we recognize that the condition of time that we're living in is a condition that when we read in revelations 3 they have put god on the outside of the church now they still have the bible still have rituals to have traditions still have all that but remember they put him on the outside of the church they will not allow him to be god in the lives of the people and in the lives of of his word and to project that word instead what has put him out creeds dogmats traditions all those ismans has put him out because remember it is him that comes to perform his word now in every age it goes to say for each one of those ages in there in the book of revelations he that overcometh it's personal it's not a group collective revelation it's not a group overcoming you know you can look at somebody else mom dad pastor whomever more and you can look at their life and see the overcoming but yet it's got to be your personal overcoming that's god's desire that you would have a personal overcoming in your own life that's why it is spoken he that overcometh now you find within this of the spirit of this age remember ladies what does it mean it means people's rights and we find that we're living right here in that characteristic of time where people are desiring of their own rights what a paradox it is that god would be calling a bride like esther that is willing to forsake her own rights a being able by the grace of god to forsake and say well i want this and i want that and i want this and i want that i'm going to take this to meet the king but instead esther she did not take and what she thought the king would like she looked at haggai the king's chamberlain and said you know the king you're his right-hand man what does the king delight in glory be to god though millennials see an age as an age you remember that on the it has such a stern rebuke to it because it's an age that will not take correction it's an age that needs to be correct corrected and so we recognize that within it it's a place to where the spirit of this age the attitude is i'm rich and i have need of nothing oh my but what a blessing it is what a blessed people you are tonight if you're able to say lord i need you i need you lord i need you more now than i ever needed you before now notice brother graham will take this this example here when he's when he's going to lay in on this message on how can i overcome he says i was crossing an old log the other day and it was you know out in a hollow and i'll i jumped on this log and oh outside it looked good looked like a big old beach log but when i jumped on it a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and dirty i said that's the way that christians are becoming do you catch what he said on the outside this log looked good i mean it looked just right it looked like it had strength but as soon as some weight got on it it couldn't hold that weight a chunk of it just gave way he says now that's the way christians are becoming they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long till they become doty they can hold no weight at all they don't know what overcoming means overcome now listen to this keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was now think about it that tree needed water but the wave that it was just laying in the water was actually a great detriment to it that tree was meant to be planted and the roots would actually take from the water source instead the very water that was actually meant to bring refreshment that that that the very vital places and parts of that tree could be sustained and life could continue to come forth but because it now had moved from an upright position to a laying down position that was laying in the very source of what would be life but it did not have itself tapped in to receive what it needed to receive so it matters this is where it comes down to it matters even as we're gathering right here under the ministering of the word it matters we don't want to just be people who lay around we want to be people who are planted we want to be people who are drinking in and taking of the word of the lord not just laying around where it's at and say oh my praise god i felt really good today my that was a wonderful service today but the question is did it change you did the spirit of god cause you to reflect deeper has it moved deeper within your life we do not want to be lazy doty christians overcoming is to keep life in us now notice he says you take a christian that's supposed to be a christian you let the life of god go from him and the experience and the joy of serving christ and living in a church where such is going on he rottens twice as quick living right under it if we're trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ now brother is telling us here as he's bringing this on even as a life is in journey to receive the baptism of the holy ghost it's to live constantly in his life all right and then once that life has been sealed we know that the book of jude in jude there it would say building up your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost so there's a constant growth a constant growing within a life let me just say this to you there's a person here there's not one of us here that aren't have not those that have been born again of the spirit of god there's not one of you including myself that could raise their hand and say well i ain't never been cold that's a lie there's been times where we've got cold there's been times where the cares of life and things have encroached upon our life but you recognize that god in his mercy will move right back into our life and say hey you gotta keep on drinking you got to keep on drawing from the source you know what it is you don't feel right if you're not feeding on the right things of god you feel like something's missing why do i feel the way i do because you were meant to feed on the word of almighty god you were meant to drink of the spirit of god man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god so thank god for his mercy yeah that's true because sometimes we can just get careless and say well you know i've heard that before and i've heard that before and really when we get to looking at that and god deals with our heart lord why didn't i even where did that attitude come there's still that part that's about you carnal and sticky but thanks be to god greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world oh glory be to god now watch here he says because if you don't and you lay around and you know what things you're supposed to do and you don't do it he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin then you become doty rotten when you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you did you catch that word strive it's just the easiest thing in the world to become a christian you haven't read your bible i don't know who's presented to you that that you know the bible says that narrow and straight is the way but broad is the way that leadeth to destruction the bible says that since the time of john the kingdom of god suffereth violence and the violence take it by force as soon as god begins to deal with a heart and move upon a life satan begins to fight and begins to come and begins to attack that life from the mind to all other things around it it will take a fight but let me tell you it look at who's fighting with you the bible said if god be for us who can be against us if god is speaking his word to your heart god is on your side hallelujah so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing now this age it's a grandest of all age give me a little bit more up here the grandest of all age but it's also the most deceptive this age is the most deceptive age since the garden of eden it's a time where it comes back into that time right there just as god is calling his bride that god himself has been building and bringing forth that bride in this hour uh it's the same time that satan is bringing forth his intellectual bride right now remember when we when we look at this here this great age of deception this deception it's so close your brother brown would say it like this that people can so live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers drinkers liars gamblers and they can live above all that and still not with it this is the age of the personal life of jesus christ remember the parallel think about it now where we're living when the lord jesus came here upon this earth there were men that he was standing face to face with that lived a holy life are you with me they lived above adultery they lived above drinking they lived above smoking they lived above that matter of fact you couldn't put a finger on their lives come on now but when the word came in that hour he wasn't just looking on the outside of that log that word began to deal with their life and chunks of their life was falling away and here the word made flesh said you're full of dead men's bones what was it he went looking at their vestige their person he was identified the spirit that was in them is the same spirit that killed the prophets it stoned them and was stood down as a matter of fact they were uncircumcised in their heart you see god looketh on the heart i'm glad for that aren't you thank you if it would have been uplifting the outer man nobody had a chance peter would have been out andrew had been out simon had been out all the rest of him been out legion would call them legion of demons he'd have been out too the woman who was bowed living with the seventh mind come on now they would all bent out as a matter of fact we remember when jesus came to simon's house remember they were they invited him there to make fun of him but there was an appointment he was coming to keep it was not an appointment with simon but he knew that little lady she was going to come and she was going to anoint him for her burial i'm telling you the spirit of god was moving and orchestrating and lining all those parts up at that time it was the outcast of society it was those that were looked down upon if anybody would have thought that these men should have been the ones that would have been able to bear the burden of the lord but they weren't able to bear it when the word called to them they refused it they said what a burden look what we'll have to give up we'll have to give up our churches we'll have to give up the sanhedrin we'll have to give this up listen even when the young boy who received eyes not just his eyesight he received eyes when they brought him back there to his parents and remember he told them who healed him and they asked the parents and the parents for fear of the rulers of the synagogue they said you you ask him he's of age the word actually brought a separation in that family because of what god had done to one's eyes it actually brought a separation but brother it didn't matter what his mama and papa thought he had had a real experience with the living god in his life and brother he was united with that burden we're talking somebody never could see [Music] we're talking about somebody didn't have eyes that's right you see this is where jesus would say blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled you realize it's a blessing to even want the holy ghost you realize that because there's many people in this world they don't want it i don't need that what the word is calling them to they look at that and say that's going to cram my lifestyle that's going to cut in on my life i can't do this and i can't do that so you know what they do they find the church that'll let them do it because they have a desire to be religious cain wasn't an infidel that boy was religious he was a worshiper come on somebody he did not come there to clown he came to worship amen you see they'll find something that's much like a filter it will allow so much of the world to go through oh but when there's hearts i said lord i just want you i don't care what i have to give up i don't care what it is how you deal with my life i want you lord you're the one that i want more than anything i don't want to appease my spirit i don't want to appease my mind i don't want to try to dead something right now but i want the full reality that i can enjoy the full blessing and the full benefit the joys of the lord right now i want a real release within my own life [Music] now notice where jesus would say here in john 14 22 many of these simple simple parts is where the enemy wants to move a person beyond jesus said unto him not to scare it lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world and jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my word so first you have to recognize it's him if you recognize it's him you recognize it's his word he will keep my words if he loves me and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him now notice this is the promise if he loves me and he keeps my word we will come and make our abode we know it's not two different people it's the one and the same we will make our abode in him now abode is not like something like you know that brother bill i went to your house and you know i visited your house the other day and we you know planted that tree and things like that and then i left that was not my boat that's not where i stayed that's not where i sleep that's not where i eat i just came there and visited now some of your other houses maybe i visited or you visited my house or just like my aunts right now they're up here you know from maryland from west virginia this is not their abode this is not where they live but where they live is their abode and you recognize that god his desire is not just to be something that comes upon a life and the life gets excited oh it's wonderful to be excited in his presence but god wants to make your life an actual abode he wants to make his residency inside of your life you might say my life oh god certainly you don't know what my life is remember he could have been born in the most beautiful of palaces he could have set up in the greatest place upon this earth but instead he came in such humility when he went to the end the end said we don't got no rooms for you here but there was a little stinky dirty stable there was a place that was not even fit for the king of glory to be birthed in but god was showing that i will come into lies that will love me and make room for me it might be outcast by the world it might be rotten lies and cast down but when those lives make way for me i will come and i will birth my glory into their [Music] lives he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which send me now notice in first john 5. in first john chapter 5 verse 3 for this is the love of god notice how john would write this definitively this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous now here's the real paradox in it is that when we the love of god it's the love of god from our heart doing what we do because we love him this is what this is the love of god it's not keeping the commandments because oh my if i don't if i man if i go in there like this brother samuel is going to tear me up if i do that man oh my lord have mercy and look around the store i wonder who's here you know i i'm not dressed exactly right it don't matter listen to me right now listen to me very carefully you can be right in your home and there's nobody there but your husband and your kids i hear the prophet of god tell us over and over he said you shouldn't even dress like that in your own house praise brother samuel you see because remember the eyes of the lord are always to and fro you see here's what happens what you do in your house you get careless in your house it'll follow you out your door you get careless in your house it'll follow you right in here come on now that's why sometimes people can't understand why this embarrasses me and that embarrasses me it depends what you allow in your home will come out and follow with you we don't want to be people you know i wouldn't want my kids saying oh my goodness now now i'm leaving the house god man i got gotta act different now i gotta change and act different no no i don't wanna confuse them you see this is what babylon is confusion it doesn't allow the real children of god to be able to act according to god's discipline but god wants you and i this is what the real working of the spirit of god does in our life it brings us to a place it doesn't matter if it's monday if it's tuesday wednesday thursday on and on it don't matter if we're in the house of god we're outside of the house of god it don't matter if we're with believers or we're working in the midst of unbelievers we're still a christian come on somebody daniel lived a victorious life and daniel didn't even have the holy ghost he lived an overcoming life right in the midst of babylon it's not about where god puts you it's about if god has put you in a certain place remember if god has put you there his grace will keep you he will let him cause his light to shine through your life as a testimony it won't just be a testimony to others but god will display the keeping and the holding power of his divine nature through your life this is the love of god what that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous you see if it's not the love of god on the inside keeping them then they're grievous why this i don't think that's necessary anymore ah god don't care about that that's that old whispering-lying devil he came right there in the evening and talked to god's daughter oh god really don't care you know god just loved you that sounds like a dodie grandpa you know there's things that my dad let my boys get by with and matter of fact he'd tell my mom now don't you tell samuel don't you i find out about this later don't you tell samuel when i'd get on him and i told him if you were there in your pants you and i are going to have a meeting afterwards there you're not going in your pants over here and then following all the bathroom rules at our house of course that ain't how old they are now i mean this was when they were much younger you know obviously and you know my dad popped up at that time i didn't know about this until later until you know after they had won a lot of victories in that area that my dad had told my mom the one time he said you get them clothes off that boy you get them in there in the washer and you wash them up and don't you let samuel know what happened right here how times change i wouldn't have been going to the washington washington washroom i'd have been going to the woodshed i'd have been getting tanned for going you know in my pants or something like that but you see god it's not called dodie grandpas god does not call grandchildren are you with me now the bible tells us in hebrews chapter 12 that it is the church of the firstborn and that firstborn is that which that life that is hidden as a son and daughter of god on the inside god himself he does not become a grandfather but every time he reveals himself into that generation he reveals himself to be the same in the same power in the same characteristic just as he revealed himself to isaac he said i'm the god of thy father abraham when he revealed himself to jacob he never said i'm the god of your grandfather abraham he said i'm the god of your father abraham showing up that no matter how time goes time can increase but he's still the same god with the same power and the same essence and the same nature and the same characteristic weren't you glad for that tonight hallelujah it's not a different experience than what peter and them had on the day of pentecost it's the same original outpouring of the holy ghost that brings a transformation [Applause] this is the difference his commandments are not grievous now remember when paul when god revealed himself to paul remember god used peter the bible paul would write about this in the book of galatians we see it in the book of acts that god wrought mightily effectually to minister to the circumcision through peter but paul was a messenger the first messenger the prophet to the gentiles he was ordained and chosen by god to bear the light of the gospel unto the gentiles the bearing of the very name of almighty god paul was committed with that of the word that god had entrusted remember peter was not committed to bring that balance between law and grace remember peter and himself even though he was there the one day eating barbecue ribs and you're eating bacon and peter's like man alive what i've been missing out on this pork but all of a sudden when some brethren came over the over the you know the hill peter said quick get the listener and help me get this stuff off my bacon grease off my hands hear the brethren come what are they gonna fake you see peter was swayed but paul said no no no this is liberty paul was able to bring the dividing of law and grace you see that was not something that paul was in his efforts trying to do it was something that god had gifted him it was the grace of god that would catch him into that place now i say all of that to say this because when we look at in the scriptures there's a lot of times there's debates about paul well paul was an old woman hater and paul was this and paul was at i'll tell you what every one of those every one of those types of statements and things like that those are individuals that when they look at paul and they want to downplay paul i'll tell you what they need they need the same kind of upper room experience that paul had they need to meet the same god that paul had because what paul wrote here under inspiration of the spirit of god he wrote in verse 36 of first corinthians 14 what came the word of god out from you or came in unto you only if any man thank himself to be a prophet or spiritual notice he brings it on down from just a prophet meaning that of a preacher or anyone there or a spiritual spirit-filled believer anybody who would regard himself in this measure let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord amen well i can recognize jesus but i can't recognize paul then you really don't recognize jesus because if you recognize jesus you'd recognize christ leading paul because paul said follow me as i follow christ is that right but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant now notice we look at this law versus a love affair let me just try to maybe to try to try to bring this down here a law versus a love affair quite it's quite a quite quite a big difference a law versus a love affair you know a law is something where you uh you're having to do it and hit inwardly there's something that's absolutely against it brother and we picked this up very very simple expression in the message all the days of our life and he talks about a season more probably probably most of you and i especially probably from this area know what linton is i'm not talking about the stuff from the dryer i'm talking about linton the linton season you know where it's a lenten season you know and i'll be in also honest with you now i was raised in a city where there was a catholic school i had friends and went to catholic school and i remember when i sat down there at the uh i just got done working out for football's down to marietta and i came in there that day and i'm sitting down getting ready to eat man i'm just hungry and i look up and i start seeing all these girls come in and i looked at the first one and i saw this dirt i thought dear lord surely she don't know she got dirt on her forehead i've never seen that before never seen it never seen it then another one came i thought oh dear lord i seen another one come out i thought this is too easy boy it's gonna be too easy poking fun at they got dirt all over where they've been doing then little did i know what was taking place that was ash wednesday this is when it starts to linton season there was a boy that guy was a big old guy you know he would come around the hallway he'd come down into my room and this guy always walked around with a two liter of pepsi always but when it came to that time of the season i can't remember why i called him lurch i said lurch where in the world where's your two liter pepsi at buddy i gave that up for lent i said say that again he said i gave that up for lynn i said what's that mean he said well and he told me you know how many days it was you know and i'm just as ignorant as can be so he tells me about and i said so you mean you just gave it up and then after that period of time you're going to pick that back up yeah now what i found was different guys would go to give up different things some gave up pepsi others gave up sardines the real cheap ones gave up stuff they didn't even like and i find all these guys one guy likes oreos who gives oreos up and the other guy likes video games he gave up video games and all this other stuff like that now you know what it was it was a season that would come about that would cause people to get very religious and when that season came around they entered into that season but they could not wait until then 45 46 how many days it was they couldn't wait they were waiting man i mean in 11 50 they were counting down 10 minutes to pepsi 10 minutes to penn state nine minutes to pepsi eight minutes to oreos seven minutes to video games they were waiting until they themselves could be free from that burden they were under that's the truth they would go right back to it now let me bring it down the spiritual you can take a person to say i'm going to stop smoking cigarettes that's a good thing because it'll kill you i'm going to stop wearing makeup that's a good thing because not only is it despised in the eyes of god but it also has carcinogens in it that brings cancer to your body but there's something much deeper than that it because if it only goes to that level and it never makes it to a place that the inward desire is dealt with after so long in time the pepsi will come back the makeup will come to come on somebody the cigarettes will come back the less problem will come back the pornography problem will come back it'll come back if it's never dealt with it's not lenten season that we need to get caught up in amen it's the season of the word it's when he is passing by our way like that one who was waiting by the pool of siloam why are you here for i'm waiting for the angel to come down and trouble the water why because soon whoever steps in there first is going to receive what they have need of he was waiting for that certain season you see god troubles the water god moves upon our life he deals with our hearts that lets us know this is the acceptable time these are not just mere things that you have to say lord well you know i'll stop doing this i'll stop doing that but say it like this say lord this is what you're calling me to lord take it out of my life what will he do he will actually lift the burden somebody look at you and say you're still going to that church you're still yeah what a burden and you say what burden god's asked me to give this up because it displeases him it's not according to his nature i want to reflect as a daughter of god i want to reflect as a son of god you see what it is it's god bringing out the desire the delight within your life there's not one sister one lady here within this building god put it in you you want to look beautiful you want to look nice that's a god-given attribute that is not of the devil but the devil wants to take that and try to make and present as though well this has to be you know you got these blemishes you got this and you got that god never tells you that but god himself there will be a beauty yes sure you do your hair sure you wear your your nice dresses and things that are loose fitting and brothers you know the same way but them but the sisters there's a desire within you that wants to look beautiful that is a god-given desire but don't allow the devil to dress you allow god to address you because when god dresses you he veils you with his word and then the gold the goods is all covered and concealed and with me i might have seen awful flattening off a plane but you understand god intends for his children to be veiled god doesn't want his daughters like billboards advertising no no god wants his glory to be the diadem that's on our head to be adorned as the bible says in a meek and quiet spirit a meek spirit one who gives place to him let me read this closely i believe that christian life is a continual sacrifice it's not just 45 days out of the year 30 days out of the year you see this is the problem many times it's because it only goes to a certain amount of time and it's your strength that you're trying to hold on to i'm not just preaching here i'm preaching to those on the internet as well this is why our strength the bible even tells us in the book of isaiah chapter 40 that even a young man you know a young man young lady they have a lot of strength a lot of zeal but it says even the young men's strength will fail you you don't have the strength that's needed to stand against the tight the tide and the wickedness of the enemy but you let god come behind you you yield your strength to god and say lord be my strength lord i yield my life to you you know what it invites him to come and to back up that confession and that stand that you're making for him because this is what he said he said you stand for me here on earth i'll stand for you in heaven notice this i believe a christian life is a continual sacrifice remember jesus said whosoever will come after me let him deny himself daily take up his cross and follow me it's a continual win oh he said how the christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with the grudge he don't do it with a feeling that he does it with the feeling that he loves god he's glad to do it listen this it's a joy to serve the lord jesus it's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to worship the lord it's a joy to be called a fanatic for the kingdom of god's sake it's a joy to take a stand for the right and move from the wrong it's joy to praise him it's joy to abstain from the things of the world it's in their heart it's a perfect lenten all the time god's spirit comes in you and changes your desire what do i do keep life in you keep life in you keep walking on with god as god is dealing with your heart remember this is not a relationship between me and you this is a relationship between you and your heavenly father he's the one who speaks to you he's the one who calls to you i cannot in myself lift that burden i cannot lift the burden from around your life but he's the one he said i'll be your burden bearer he's the one that can actually lift that burden in your life to where how god will begin to deal with the heart that maybe you know at one time i think about when god you know when i hired a young person and you know i'd look at it and say oh my got to go to church again man oh man i'll tell you goodness i mean the preacher gets up there and preaches an hour and a half and two hours dad gets up behind it and recites for 45 minutes and goes through this and then they sing songs after song and this brother is going to get up and sing this song and this song now come on now see what was that in the natural part there was a part within it yeah i was coming but my heart wasn't in it it was a law i did things i wonder who's watching i wonder who's looking around i hope nobody's watching but one thing about it god is always watching i never was able to escape from him god knew exactly where i was but oh i'm so glad i'm so glad that it's not something that i have to do it's something i get to do i don't have to serve god i love to serve the lord it's not a burden to serve him it is my delight let's pray heavenly father we just lord are so thankful so thankful lord for your mercy so grateful lord tonight that we know you as one lord jesus who comes with the burden of the lord to lift that burden lord from about our life to separate us from that old sin nature oh god to come down lord with the circumcising power of the word of god and lord jesus to deal with our life lord jesus it is truly a love affair you've never threatened us you never threatened me lord you never came at me and and brought threats lord god i don't serve you tonight out of fear of going to hell i don't do that lord i can remember lord god before you got a hold of my life oh my lord i'd get so scared when the power of god would come in services i'd get so fearful lord i'd watch people lord god right here in this church not per se this building in that other little building we were renting lord where there'd be different ones get right up out of wheelchairs and walk lord that had never walked i'd see and sense the power of god and i would thank the thought would range in my heart at that time oh god the rapture is going to be on and i'm not ready that was fearful [Music] i did things out of fear but lord i'm so glad i'm so glad that there's a welcoming to your presence [Music] i'm a part of this rapture lord there's always a reverence when you come [Music] lord jesus i pray if there's one that's here tonight let them know i believe you already have i believe you already have you've let them know that lord jesus you don't come to add to their burdens no no you came and you come to relieve their burdens because the real burden is us trying to do it for our own will now lord may they see the simplicity of it if there's be one here tonight that it's surrendering their will to you like a little boy putting on a coat he can get one arm in there but he'll spin around and around and around and around trying to get his other arm in that coat but if he can just put his hand in the hand of his parent his parent will guide his hand into the other sleeve that coat that he's got part way on will become a fully clothed child or granite tonight i pray that lord for every heart may they walk within that lord keeping life in them may it be the desire within their life for those lord i i thank god of even in these services and not just a few people you've been dealing with all of our lives the lord god may each and everyone continue to keep life in them may they strive may we strive with all that's in us to live constantly in the life of christ granted lord we don't want to be soft and dirty we don't want to look good on the outside where we've got everything on the outside right on no no we want to have it on the inside right on because when we've got it on the inside right on it'll reflect on the outside when temptations come when pressures come when afflictions come when persecution comes when reproach comes there's a strength that's within us lord lord jesus how we thank you tonight thank you lord because from our heart where the rest of the world others lord i know i can fellowship many lord that if around right around here right now when their friends and different ones would say what are you doing now you're serving the lord what friends lord i didn't have to stop my friends my friends stopped me there were things lord that i began to recognize there's desires and things that they have and where they're going and conversations and things that that's not who i want to be that's not the atmosphere i want to be around i want my ears to be open to his word now lord when the world comes and wants to try to knock on our door and say what a burden you're under the lord our heart says what burden what burden we've been lifted we've been lifted that bondage of corruption that i was in i've been free i've been set free granted tonight lord may you just move lord according to every need of your children tonight in the name of jesus christ amen amen could we just stand you love him what burden what burdens [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's [Music]
