[Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer tonight. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; truly Lord, that's &gt;&gt; Lord, the resolve in our hearts, Lord. Dear God, many times Lord along this journey we find ourselves Lord in that place that no matter what no matter Lord what we would even feel like but to praise you Father Lord realizing that it's not just the what we would say through our lips yet that itself would require a sacrifice but each and every day of our lives Lord is a to be a praise offering to you, &gt;&gt; Lord, for how that you have swept down in your grace, moved upon our lives, Lord, drawn us to a place of surrender and submission, Lord, and how that you would come in and take complete control in our lives, Lord. Oh, Father, you've changed us, Lord, from what we were, &gt;&gt; every desire of our life, Lord. Oh God, and brought about, Lord, just a real genuine faith in your word. Why shouldn't we praise you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Father, here we, oh God, have such an opportunity that's granted to us, Lord, to worship you, Father, not only, Lord, here, but daily as our lives of praise would go up. Lord, to think how David would write of this many times. Pope Peter would write of it that oftent times Lord it would be the praise that would be offered up. It would be a sacrifice Lord through situations, through circumstances of life, through times Lord I wonder how many times that you come down right here in this services and you know Lord that Father are feeling how things are conditions of life and we would have a right Lord to just say I I'm so overwhelmed I I I I can't worship I'm just so overwhelmed but Lord this sacrifice of praise as David would speak of even the calves of our lips. Let there be an offering of praise, Lord. Let our hearts, our lives, let everything within us, Lord, praise you, Father, no matter the circumstance, Lord, because we know that God, you are in control, Lord. And father, not only do you have the circumstance under control, &gt;&gt; but most importantly, you have us &gt;&gt; in your hands, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, how thankful we are, Lord. We pray, heavenly father, that once again that you would just come among us in a very special way, Lord. Speak to us, I pray, Father, through your word. Just guide us, Lord, on what is to be said, Father. May you just Lord speak to our hearts in a special way. How we thank you Lord for moving upon so many needs Lord among us Lord. Oh God, we want to say thank you, Father. Lord, the different requests, Lord, that's went out here, Father, even over the last month and a half, Lord. Different requests, serious needs, Lord. But oh God, how we're so thankful, Lord. So thankful, God, for your mercy, Lord, for each one, Lord. Oh, I thank you, Father, for God, Lord, moving on the scene for Elamine, Lord. I thank you for that, Lord. I thank you father for just moving Lord for sister Irma Lord. Thank you Lord for touching our sister Lord and restoring her Lord and Lord God back to us Lord. And we thank you for your mercy Lord. Oh God thank you Father for touching Marco's life Lord for moving for him Lord. Oh God many of these situations Lord things could have went a much different way but Lord it was your mercy Lord. Oh God, help us Lord, we want to say thank you, Father. Thank you for your mercy once again in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Amen. We &gt;&gt; certainly want to say it's good to be back home and uh we want to turn our hearts right into the word and so thank you for your prayers. And I know there was wonderful services while we were away and the Lord just moved upon many different needs and so thankful for that as well. And um so we just want to take a take a look here just a little bit more this evening in the word of the Lord. And I want to go into 1 Corinthians 12 once again and pick up with here on these in these verses. And Paul would write, "Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular, and God hath set some in the church." Now, these are the he's Paul's going to deal with offices and gifts. And God hath set some in the church. First apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles and gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues, and then he says in verse 29, "Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? Now, you're aware of where Paul was at just right previous to these verses of scripture. He's dealing with the body and how that God has so set the body together in every member of the body, even bestowing more honor upon the unbecoming parts of the body. And how that God would so do that. but yet showing that for each and every one of us there is a part in the body of Jesus Christ. How many believe you have a part? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe God makes known that part. God will make known the part. Sometimes we're looking for a certain thing. And as a matter of fact, brother Braman says it like this in the message. He said God usually has to drive us into the right part that he has for us. I think that's incredible. Drive us into that place. Brother Bram talks to one one brother who is standing there in the tabernacle at one point in time. And that brother, you know, is kind of struggling with his purpose and his part. And brother Bram just stops and he tells him, he says, "Brother," he says, "I believe," he said, "if you'll you see how God has used you within singing." He said, "If you'll just yield to that," he said, "that's what your part is in the body." And yet the man, no doubt, he was he was trying. I just had heard even a testimony. It took me back to that quote where someone was talking about that and I thought how incredible how that man was actually looking at some other part in the body. And yet God's grace would bring such a relief to his life to realize that something that maybe he was inclining or looking at that that's not what God had at all for him. You talking about a rest and what that would be. It's almost sound like a a balloon going off &gt;&gt; because it wasn't something we realiz in anything God has for us, any part, any purpose, we don't ever have to push our way in or make our our way. The Bible said, "Every gift maketh room for itself." Amen. So, let's look here in verse 31. I love this. says, "But covet earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I unto you a more excellent way." A more excellent way. And if the Lord will help us, I want to just speak once again here tonight on this part of a more excellent way. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I realize that um when we as we look and have looked over these things in many in many times that we understand that we've you never grow beyond God's word or whatever or what that God has placed within the church. It still has a place. It still has a part within the church. And yet sometimes men, and I don't believe men would do it in a manner to be wrong, but sometimes they maybe can begin to place emphasis on things above other things in in the word of God and begin to look at it. And one of the reasons that that would be is many times that the human being, the prophet tells us, even how we're made as human beings, we are drawn to that of the supernatural. Even you see this out here among many of the people and they'll look at all the the phenomenal. You'll see things to where that I never forget we went through Gettysburg and here we were and a couple times and they're promising these tours in Gettysburg where there would you know to be sightings of ghost and everything else and you see people that are drawn to that &gt;&gt; and and that's not even the truth and you we we understand we have understanding of that you know as the prophet would even teach us on that but yet there's a part of it that even as I'll say as believers that we're drawn to that of the supernatural natural. And yet the scriptures are so clear to us that where the Bible tells us that we are not to seek after signs and wonders and miracles, but yet they follow the believer. The greatest sign and wonder that can follow your life or my life is that we're a believer. Is that the seal of the living God, remember a seal, it shows coming and going. That's the greatest testament that we can have. And I think how brother Brandon would say it in Kinsman Redeemer when he would talk about those handfuls of purpose and he would say, "God, let every once in a while a miracle. Let something happen among us. Every once in a while, Lord, just to let us know that you're among us." Now, could God do that every single service? He could. Could God do it every single day of our life? He could. But there's a measure of it. And God knows the measure. It's not regulated by man. But God wants our lives to walk with such a trust in him to where when we don't feel him, we don't see him. &gt;&gt; Yet there is a trust in his word and what he said because he said it. Even when you don't have any word about maybe a sickness or an illness or a situation, you don't even have any word that's dropped to you where God has given a specific order, but yet you have the general orders that says they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. We can stand upon God's word and that actually that's the greatest achievement that could ever be had is God bringing a people in this hour to believe him for what he has said. Does God give us divine assistance? He does. God knows exactly when when what you and I have need of and when we have need of it. But yet building us to such a place to where in our lives our confidence is in him and he is the word. And so when we consider this on that of a more excellent way, you know, Paul was not taking the church away from gifts, but he saw that where that the people were resting. They were resting their experiences. They were resting who they are. And they were they were resting upon these things. So much so to where that even when it would become into services that they felt like in times that they had to do this, one has a psalm, one has a revelation, one has a this and they really felt that way. And you know, God doesn't want us to live in a manner of uncertainty or confusion or condemnation. But Paul would be led by the spirit of God to go down and begin to place that and give the order and the appropriate times for these things to be released within the body. And I believe as as the prophet taught us that he says, you know, you do have control of the Holy Spirit. So the Holy Spirit is it that that that whole part of being led by the spirit of God is not a Pentecostal idea which it is an idea that well I'll just do whatever when the spirit of God comes upon me. But the prophet taught us that we actually have control. Now control is different from quenching because quenching would be to where it's just completely stifled altogether. But control operates within the divine prescribed order of God's word. And there's a place of safety within that. That's why brother Bam tells us even he said you might feel like shouting and you're right in front of the president of the United States. He said you realize that's not the time to do that. He said you might break out. You might be in a courtroom and he said it moves upon you to speak in tongues. He said but you realize that's not the right place to do that. He said there's a proper time and place. So it brings us to understand we do have a control and that control is not quenching. It's just releasing it at the right time. It's kind of like you have a garden hose and you're hooked up, you know, to the to that of the hose. You know when to release it. You don't release it when somebody's sitting in a chair that's right there. You wait till you get by and get over to your flower pots and you release it. You've got a hold of it. And that whole releasing of it is knowing even when to yield to the spirit of God. I'm glad that God deals with us that way. Aren't you? It's to alleviate confusion and to bring and to to give us a place of real rest so that we're not walking in a place of condemned or I should have done this or I should have done that and I should have. But I'm so thankful that God leads us in that way and brings a real settleness in our heart. So when we look at this of a more excellent way and this whole word way it appears many times in the scriptures but it's actually a road or a traveled way. It's a a traveling or a journey. It's a course of conduct a way a manner of thinking, feeling or deciding. Now you know when when we um we we flew to Texas and we didn't drive. That's that's too long of a drive for me. I mean it gets beyond eight hours. That's that's pushing it. That's just me. But I I'm just I know there's I've got I've got buddies and friends, they like to drive. I I I just I like to get in. Don't like to have to worry about it. Fly me there and fly me back. But you know, when you you look at it, you when you if I were to drive to Amarillo or Columbus or Bluton or wherever, you know, there's many ways you can take you got a choice. I mean, you can go the highway, you can go the back roads, you can go country roads. It's like sometimes when I'm and I'm going to Jeffersonville or down to Louisville or whatever, sometimes it most of the time it'll take me down 58. If I have to go over and get gas over at Sam's Club or Costco, it'll a lot of times put me on the turnpike, route me over to 71, then drop me down. But a lot of times from my house, it'll take me right down 58, may split me off on 89, 250 to 71. But long story short, I'm going to get there. But you see what God when he's speaking here, he just does not say that this is one of the more excellent ways. But there is this is the excellent way. And we know that that the way we're talking about is Jesus Christ and it is the word. &gt;&gt; And so we always know we're safe when we're abiding in the word. And this is this is the way that God has set. So this way it's really it's not an optional. It's not like power power, you know, I know anymore power windows and doors. I I was talking to some people here. Uh I think my boys and some others we were talking about it. Man, it used to be optional. You used to thought you were, man, good if you got a car that had power windows in it. Power door locks was good because you didn't have to reach across to try to unlock that door for whoever's getting in. But now it's a lot of those things are just standard, you know, that come on a car. Even when I remember, you know, having a tape deck in a car and uh you young people, we'll show you what that is. But that was special. &gt;&gt; You look for those things. and even having heating and air conditioning in the car. Now, they don't even look for heating and air conditioning. They want to see not even any more heated seats. They want to see, does this have cooled seats, too? &gt;&gt; Man, how things have come a long way. &gt;&gt; Pretty soon, I'm thinking it's going to have hands that'll reach out and massage your back. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; But, you know, when we look at this, this is not an this is not an optional way. But it's like this with God. God never um he never demands anything but he is showing us the proper way and the proper channel that it is not a gift plus love but it is the love of God in our hearts which is the Holy Spirit and we operate by the love of God. Whether there is a a a gift in our life, a church gift or an office in our life of apostle, prophet, teacher, whatever it might be, we want the very the very basis of our life is to be based on divine love. The love of God that God loved me and he gave himself for me. And now that love is what's resting in my bosom. And whether I ever preach again or not, I know he loves me. whether I do anything else or not, I know he loves me. &gt;&gt; Is that all right? &gt;&gt; So, it's not it removes it then from anything of of works or anything that we would do. Yet, works shows forth our appreciation for what God has done for us. And we always want to be in that place. I know I've said this a lot here over the past years, but it's very true. We always want to be a channel that's available and open to God. And that's that's the thing that when God spoke about Job, he was a dedicated channel. And I don't want to be a dedicated channel to carry, you know, garbage. I don't want to be a dedicated channel for the NFL. I don't want to be a dedicated channel for sports. I don't want to be a dedicated channel for gossip. I don't want to be a dedicated channel for, you know, a grudge. I don't want to be a dedicated channel for bitterness. I want to be a dedicated channel for the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to be because that's where God can move into. And the prophet said that is a channel that faith can move into. And that's what we are looking for is that rapturing faith. It's going to move in the final quickening. One of these days, one of these moments, it'll move in. I just want to say one of these moments it'll move in the final quickening in that moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't Adam. It wasn't Abraham that provided the ram. God provided the ram. The only thing for you and I is to stay faithful to God's word. And so there's the right pursuit. This is what Paul was speaking of the right pursuit within this. And you know this is where Paul would write after uh uh chapter 13 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy that which would would edify. But notice follow pursue it. Let you say, "Well, brother Samuel, if if if charity, which is the agape love, God's own love, and which is who God is, if that's dwelling in my life, then why should I pursue that?" Well, first of all, we always have to examine, is it dwelling in our lives? And if it is dwelling in our lives, we want more of it. And we want more of it to take over more of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need more. We need more in this hour than we had the previous hour. &gt;&gt; We need more now. It's going to take more now. As a matter of fact, the prophet said it would take perfect love to make it there. &gt;&gt; And so, we need, we see it, even God, you know, God allows things to arise around us uh to bring us to the reality that we need more of the love of God in our lives. And you know really what it is, it's not putting something on on the outside, but Paul writes of it in Colossians and he says put on or sink into. He writes it in Ephesians 2. So it's us shrinking in or moving or submitting to the love of God in our life and allowing God's love to step forward. That's what happened with the bull in the pasture. &gt;&gt; That's what happened with the hornets. Remember, brother Ram said, he said, "If I'd have been next to that shed with them hornets, I had a can of hornet spray." I wonder how many other hornets got blasted. &gt;&gt; They was in the shed. Brother Ram never said, "I went in the shed and got rid of my hornet spray after that." Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; And the same thing about the bull. Brother Bram told us if he'd have known that bull was in that pasture, he wouldn't have walked there. So, we we we're not here to prove anything. Brother Brandham wasn't trying to prove something. If brother Brandon would have walked into that pastor trying to prove something, it would have already been the wrong motive and wrong objective. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And the love of God will not produce the wrong the wrong motive and wrong objective. &gt;&gt; Right? So then when we're looking at this with divine love within our lives that you know I would say that there was no doubt believers setting in Corinthians you know that maybe they hadn't been used to speak in tongues maybe maybe they you know they hadn't not not one of the you know gifts that like brother said milling throughout the body following this one the night maybe never again following this one the night never again then there might have been those that you know they they didn't have any ministerial any church office there was nothing like that and man here they were they they were looked at as maybe simple believers. But God through his word would bring it that the body God has so set the body together that one part of the body is not to look down or look up to another part of the body but every member of the body is working together with one unity and one purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; My what a relief that would have been to th to those believers in that hour to realize that you know what that I may not be gifted in this way or up to this point God that that gift that would be milling through the body has not fallen on me. So then then they they could rest in that place that you know what it it isn't that I ever have to do anything. You you may never walk on the water. You may you may never be used in a certain capacity but it does not matter. Your life is being used in the greatest capacity to be a testimony of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because let me just tell you, there's many that have great gifts &gt;&gt; and are not even in the bride. There's many ministering gifts that have been TV evangelists been others have been have had great gifts and some of them the things that that what it turns out to be. I'm not what I'm trying to say is this is where the prophet was saying is that we don't chase after gifts. &gt;&gt; We don't even chase after the supernatural. We believe in the supernatural &gt;&gt; and to have a discernment and to recognize that within that oil that a gift itself can operate. But a gift is not a signification that that is a spiritfilled individual. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The prophet taught us that. He said, notice in the Pergamian age, he said Jesus never did put emphasis on the works. He knew if the people got the word that the works would follow the word. &gt;&gt; And the word is not the letter. The word is the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is not something separate from the word or greater than the word. The Holy Spirit is the word himself. &gt;&gt; That's why we are born of the word which is the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we can't be filled with the spirit of God and disagree with the word. &gt;&gt; Because this Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So the right pursuit. What are the things that that we're pursuing? Watch how brother Brown would say this in 1958 here in the church order message. She said, "I think first that every member or every worshipper of the Brandham tabernacle should be so much in divine love with each other until their hearts would long for each other &gt;&gt; when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night." He said, "I'm a true believer in divine love." Right. &gt;&gt; And you know, one thing that's good is when we can read the word of God and we can take the grace of God that comes to us with a good courage and stand and even to look at a quote like this and say, "God, help me." &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Because we're not here for a show. &gt;&gt; We're not here just to say amen to the word because it's right. &gt;&gt; We're here saying amen to say so be it. and that our lives would be examined by the word of God. &gt;&gt; And there might be other things that's come into that way and maybe our feeling is not there within that way. And then the spirit of God, we can invite him according to his word and say, "Lord, create that in me. Lord, I want to sink deeper into the love of God in my life." &gt;&gt; I think we all would look at this and agree that within all of this here, we could all say, "Amen." that every member, every worshipper first be so in love. But you realize that even when we look at this in 1 Corinthians 13, and I could have read all the different uh attribute expressions of divine love tonight, but I I'm not going to do that because we don't want you even chasing after to try to obtain an attribute. Rather, let it be divine love, the person of Jesus Christ himself. And then from him will come the patience. From him comes longsuffering. &gt;&gt; So you see, it's not something I'm reaching out to. Sure, we want the word to examine us and say, "Lord, I need more patience. &gt;&gt; I need to be more long-suffering. I I need Lord, I I I need to go through my file cabinet because I'm keeping too many records on people. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good." When somebody brings up their name &gt;&gt; and we come out with the same feeling &gt;&gt; as we had 20 years ago, &gt;&gt; something's wrong. We need to deal with that file. But you'll never deal with it without them inviting the blood of Jesus Christ. And the way you invite it is to remember what the blood did for you &gt;&gt; and what it's still doing for you. It'll take care of that file. Now, it won't strip it out of your memory, but it'll no longer allow it to be that anointing that's there that will manifest that offensive grudge and that resentment, but it will deal with that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Why did that even have to happen?" God's got to have situations that he can take and lives &gt;&gt; and he can manifest his victory through your life and my life. And we no one no one will stand there on that day and said, "Well, if id have just had a perfect run, if id had perfect parents, if id had a perfect church, if I'd have had a perfect pastor, if id had a perfect this, if I'd have had a perfect this, if id had a perfect this, there will be nobody, no excuse on that day &gt;&gt; for why anybody missed it &gt;&gt; and why they couldn't live a victorious life." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you friends, there's no complex. There's no situation. I don't care what somebody's done. If you're a son of daughter of God, you always were. And you're always in charge. &gt;&gt; If you allow it to rain over your life, that's your choice. &gt;&gt; That ain't nobody else's choice. &gt;&gt; That's your choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God has provided a bleach to take care of those things. &gt;&gt; God has provided grace. &gt;&gt; Depends on what you want to keep up. like that little like that little woman. She you know she brought uh she brought you know one of the generals was there. I think it was General Lee. She brought him down and man she brought him down. Come here. I want to show you a tree. Got back over there and showed him a tree. This tree was riddled with bullet holes. It was a mess. It was one of her favorite trees. And she said she got him back there. Now the war is already over. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes in the south they don't know that but it's over. &gt;&gt; That was just a little That was just to get you smiling. &gt;&gt; General Lee stood there and looked at that tree and this woman was going on and on about them Union soldiers and everything else. She said, "What do you think?" He said, "Cut it down and burn it. &gt;&gt; That's what you do to it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this tree was a reminder to her. Sometimes, listen friends, we got a choice over what we allow to be kept in our lives. &gt;&gt; But you can't do it, you can't do it with human love. &gt;&gt; You can't take things out of your life with human love. &gt;&gt; It takes the love of God. &gt;&gt; It takes the love of God. &gt;&gt; My my my my &gt;&gt; follow after charity. So it isn't something putting on and oh my you know we're going to we got a machine back there and you know you run through it and we'll just it just sprinkles that powdered sugar. Well, it's like I told them there in Texas if there's things that's not genuine. I said forgive me but I couldn't think of any other example. I said it's like putting homemade icing on a storebought cake. &gt;&gt; I don't like storebought cakes. They're made with oils that tear me up. I but you get what I'm talking about, friends. If you like storebought cake, fine. Fine. That's okay. That you can eat your storebought cake. But I think you need to get you get what I'm talking about. Is that when it's not something that God's asking us to put on? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Divine love is not something that's put on. You can't put on divine love. Divine love must come from that hidden source of the love of God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what happened on the platform. That's what happens in our lives. This is why brother Bra would say in questions and answers on the Holy Ghost. He said, "Here's the way the church is set up in a Pentecostal church. If I was pastoring this church, I tell you what I would set it up if I could be here all the time as the pastor. I would subscribe to every gift in the Bible." &gt;&gt; Well, I believe in saying what he said. &gt;&gt; Not only every non-spiritual gift, but here's the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's ascribed to every gift that's in the Bible. He still believed in pastors. &gt;&gt; It wasn't in parenthesis that they had to only sit down and push play. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is what this is what the prophet stood for. It was restoring the true apostolic gospel. &gt;&gt; It was bringing and tearing down the veils where Satan wanted to put up veils. In other words, he wants to try to get things between God and his people. And God sent the message in this hour. And the message is not the idea of William Brham. The message is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A true reflection from the throne of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "Don't you ever let anything get between you and that word." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Keep the pathway clear. Feelings, whatever it is, don't let anybody, person, a personality, don't let nobody &gt;&gt; get between you and that word. in relationship, whatever it is, keep that clear. Tell believers first to be baptized in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; See, when we're then in Christ, it's Christ he has set in the church. &gt;&gt; It's God's working. &gt;&gt; Right? Remember, brother Bam would tell many of those young men that they would become enthused and inspired and they would do we go now and go seek after gifts. Brother Ram said, "Don't do it. You only make yourself a stuffed shirt." Now listen, when you could look at that, what would be a a a commending thing for maybe a young person, man, because we got young people all around that, you know, they want to be like these basketball stars or football stars or or whatever more or other things. But, you know, I think it's a wonderful thing to be enthused or inspired. I remember brother Tim Puit tells that when he was just a a real young boy. He went he was in brother Bram's meeting and man, he was there. He knew right there in his heart, I I want to be a preacher. He went and got a suit and had a Bible and everything else. Of course, you know, God's done the work and proved it all out. But what I'm saying is is that everything itself, you know, there's times where there's enthusiasm, but we always want to allow our enthusiasm to be placed under the word. &gt;&gt; Enthusiasm is zeal. &gt;&gt; We always want it to be under the word of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because if it can't come under God's word, then it's not needed. Right? &gt;&gt; It only it's needed when it submits and operates under God's word. That's why you know even in this hour the ministry in this hour Ephesians 4 must come under the anointing of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why another message won't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An idea. That's why we're not just preaching scriptures. &gt;&gt; We're preaching the light of the word from the scriptures. &gt;&gt; We're not left to our own devices. We're not left to wondering. We're not left to our own understanding. It is God that has come down. The mind of Christ that is set down in this hour. And I say, "Thanks be to God for a word in this hour that gives you and I a real direction and a liberty. It is an anointing upon our life." &gt;&gt; And that anointing is Christ. &gt;&gt; Before Aaron and them could ever minister, they had to come and be washed by the prophet. Is that right? washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; And I think those are things that you we evaluate, we look at closely. Remember remember what Paul said in the Ephesian age. He said that thou hast tried them tried them that called themselves apostles and has found them to be false. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now, how did they try them? Did they bring a tribunal? Did they bring them up, you know, and you know, and where they're, you know, like like a court? No. No. They they they know what it was is the prophet told us they simply looked at what was being said and said the prophet Paul never said that &gt;&gt; you're saying something contrary to Paul. Well, brother Samuel, don't you think I ain't got a thought coming and neither do you. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to preach my thoughts. We're not going in a rapture by our thoughts. It's his thoughts. As a matter of fact, what changed our lives is his thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's always a real key to me. Don't you think? No, no, no. I don't want to. No, no. It ain't about what I think. We're not here to reason. We're not It's not a group of men. God delivered us out of the camps of man of what do you think and what do you think? God sent us a message to bring us into his camp. And we've got to go beyond our own camp &gt;&gt; and into the camp of the supernatural God &gt;&gt; who performs his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, watch in the scripture here, you see, because we understand that when we're looking at this that divine love that God is love. So I want let's just read a few scriptures here. The Bible tells us in 1 John 4 and verse 7, beloved, let us love one another. Now that word is agape. Let us love one another. For love is of God. And everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. And he that loveth not knoweth not God. For God is love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now when we we understand that this love that we're talking about that is speaking of here Paul's not talking about felio love &gt;&gt; but he's talking about agape love which is God himself God's own life God's own nature and you and I could not get to that we man in himself could not express that purity that's the purity of love because from there it comes all the way on down to where we're at in filio and goes all the way on down as the prophet said into that of filth. That's a stream of love. But you and I could not get back into that place. But it was the love of God that came down for you and I. &gt;&gt; It was the love of God. What brought him down for you and I? Not because that our condition was lovable. &gt;&gt; It was that which was beneath all of the condition. Right? &gt;&gt; God did not feel our condition. He didn't like our condition. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; He didn't like But he loved us. What was it that he loved? He loved that part. That part which is of himself, that's what he came to redeem. &gt;&gt; Because once you get that part in order, and once that part comes back in line with God, then the rest of it will line up under the authority of a manifested son and daughter of God. Now notice in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. herein is love. Not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. &gt;&gt; I tell you, this is a glorious revelation right here. &gt;&gt; The revelation of Jesus Christ is the new birth to you personally. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation of God's love. Remember the prophet said, "Oh," he said, "I always used to think that God hated me, but Jesus loved me." He said, "But one day I found out they're the same person." &gt;&gt; Is that right? God bringing that to a reality and a rest in this hour. And John, think of this. Let me remind you who this is. Let me remind you who's writing here. You say, "Brother Samuel, it's the Holy Spirit." I agree with you. But it's the Holy Spirit that has control over a man who wanted to call fire down out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's how he was. Are you hearing me? That's how he was. &gt;&gt; Things weren't going his way. Fire coming down on heaven. He wanted to use that from what Elijah did. Remember Jesus set his face and was not going to turn in and they weren't going to receive him. And John, the first thing he does is, "Shall we call fire down out of heaven?" And what did Jesus say? He said, "You know not what spirit you are of." &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, this is always a place of discernment. Because the spirit of God is not about zapping and dissolving. A spirit of God is always that which is in tune to the word and not getting sidetracked. Right. &gt;&gt; Things come and go. Differences. &gt;&gt; Differences come and go. Is that right? &gt;&gt; I don't believe we bury them in the backyard. I believe I believe it's dealt with by the grace of almighty God. I believe the blood of Jesus Christ is to deal with these things. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God. I think you know I I I think it's time. Stop carrying things that you've carried for all these years. I mean, you ain't going to get no medal at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; Oh, you carried a grudge longer than this one. &gt;&gt; You carrying an offense longer than this one. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get no you ain't going to get no medal at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; But it's right now is the opportunity. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you what'll happen. You won't get a medal. But the Bible says every one of us must appear at the judgment seat of Christ and will have to give an answer. Why did you hold on to that grudge and hinder Why was you always making trouble? Why was that? And you'll have to give an account for that. Now, I'm not going to say a person is lost. I'm talking about the judgment seat of Christ, not the white throne judgment. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You know, I I I don't want to be there as you know, you were always a problem. You were always a troublemaker. You were all all you did was hold offenses. All you did was hold grudges. This is how you're known. I don't want to be there standing in that way &gt;&gt; because I believe in the achievement of the love of God and what it produces through our lives. &gt;&gt; You see, God allows situations. As I said earlier, he allows things to come our way. &gt;&gt; You know why? He does it to prove his love through our lives. So, you mean God has not called me to straighten everybody else out? Dear Lord, if everybody could just think like me, thank God we don't. &gt;&gt; Thank God you don't think all like me. Thank God. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, I know if you think your thoughts are absolute, I mean, but I'm just saying I thank God. I I thank God. God has made it in such a way that the love of God prevails in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know what? Let me tell you what's more supernatural. It's more supernatural to lay aside an offense &gt;&gt; than it is for healing to follow. &gt;&gt; It's more supernatural to lay aside a grudge than it is to walk on water. &gt;&gt; Because walking on water, listen, that may be a wonderful thing. You might be edified and everything else, but to lay aside a grudge is to allow the Holy Spirit to clear and make a pathway for himself to be expressed through your life. And God's not going to send the prophet again. The prophet is here, the Holy Spirit, the spirit of truth, a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; So the emphasis, you know, anytime you have an emphasis, emphasis on something, and an emphasis is a special importance or value, &gt;&gt; right? It's kind of, you know, it's just like a doctrine or it'll lay on a certain e emphasis and people become known by that doctrine. Whatever the, you know, the the terminology is and everything else that goes with it become they become known by that. It becomes a point of emphasis and and and so it it begin what does it do? It begins to make a name. A name is a character, &gt;&gt; right? that you become associated with this group or this thing or this move. You have this expression. Why it becomes and many times sometimes people here they're going many times they're going right along with it. Don't even know what's going on. You know what? Why are you doing this? Cuz everybody else is doing it. &gt;&gt; Everybody else is believing it. &gt;&gt; That's called herd mentality. &gt;&gt; That's what that's called. &gt;&gt; Doing something because somebody else is doing it and you just think it's the right thing to do. The Bible said, "Let all things be proven." &gt;&gt; Is that right? And hold fast to that which is good. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Woo. So, an emphasis. Listen. Watch how Brother Ram says, the world's dying for love. That's the fountain that God's got open. You said I want to ask you the greatest of all the gifts that's in the local body and we put so much emphasis on speaking with tongues interpretations first is wisdom and brother Ram goes right on down within that part and he says but then after that is if you don't have wisdom how can you operate your knowledge he said and he says if you haven't got knowledge you won't know how to have peace I think we found an answer for a lack of knowledge my people perish Notice he says you've got to put first things first, not on evidences, upon the spirit, God. It's incredible. Here it is. I'm reading 1957. This is Saskatoon. Brother Brandham says the same things in his own church. And in 1965, Satan's Eden. You've heard me refer to this hundreds of times where brother Brandham says, "I heard it's been said around here. Why don't brother Brandham preach on the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; And I've also said this multiple times. Find me a tape. Find me a message that he don't preach on the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Find me a message. But even in his own church right there in Brandham Tabernacle, why are people asking that? Because they're still looking &gt;&gt; back to a different light &gt;&gt; and they still have not been delivered or come fully into that place. Remember Malachi 4, birth pains. The church is to be delivered of a new birth. &gt;&gt; It's not taking Ladyosa Pentecost even though we're in the Ladyian age. It's not taking Pentecostalism and putting it in the vat and mixing the message up with it. No sir, it the Bible is clear. The message is clear. Burn that old leaven with fire. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; The shuck is not what we want. The seed passed through the shuck. &gt;&gt; So in other words, we don't have to have shucks and shucks and shucks and shucks and shucks. Shucks. Did you have service? Shucks. No. Shucks. Shucks. shuts. Everything is on shuts. Oh, brother Sam, you're taken away from the moving of the spirit. I am not. But Pentecost, remember, it was the restoration of the gifts, but it was not the restoration that was promised. &gt;&gt; The restoration that was promised is that the seed would come forth in its full original power and glory that could take all the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pentecost couldn't take all the word. &gt;&gt; Pentecost couldn't take setting the gifts in order. &gt;&gt; They couldn't take any of that at all. It was just whatever I feel led to do and I feel led to do this and I feel led and I feel led and I feel led and boy however I feel led to do and I feel led and I everything becomes &gt;&gt; and you look and think well all of the feelings and leadings surely the Holy Spirit won't lead you outside of his word. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, I just felt led at that moment to speak in tongues. Surely, surely he's not going to lead you in a moment to overstep the boundaries of his word he's given. &gt;&gt; Because if he'll do that for that, where does it stop? &gt;&gt; What other word will he break? &gt;&gt; But he don't break his word. He's a spirit of truth. His word never fails. He's God. And you know our confidence is he'll always come according to his word. That's why you can be sitting right here tonight and have a need in your body and you don't have a direct word. You don't even have a feeling. But there is a a resolve in his word that it says that by his stripes I am healed. I'm the Lord that health thy diseases. And you can rest your faith right there and with patience wait for it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, brother Samuel, they might step from this dimension in the next dimension, it's healing. &gt;&gt; Whether it's the lion, the ox, the man, or the eagle, it's all healing. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's standing on God's word. That's why the prophet said, "If I was standing here, greatest bountif,000 and every one of them died," he said, "I'd be back on the platform the next night." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? What, brother Samuel? What is that all about? That's about faith in God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet, let me finish the quote out of Satan's Eden. He said, "Don't," he said, "what it is the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ in you quickened, made alive to every word for this age." He said, "Don't watch it so much in demonstrations, but watch it in action." &gt;&gt; Cuz you know why demonstrations can be just a moment? just a moment. That's why Paul said, "Though I have faith to move mountains, &gt;&gt; though I can speak with tongues, though I can have demonstration, but it's the action." Are you hearing me? It's the action. It's when everything is going wrong. It's your action. &gt;&gt; It's when everything you feel on the mountain, it's your action. You see, it's not you acting, it's the Holy Ghost acting through you. &gt;&gt; That's the action of the word. Oh my &gt;&gt; friends, I rejoice in this. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; I rejoice. It's a settling in God's word. &gt;&gt; God's brought us to a place to where we're not chasing evidences and demonstrations. That's no sign. But the only sign it is is genuine faith in God's word where our lives have been changed and our desires match God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice the prophet said as he's dealing with this. He said, 'You know, we we put so much emphasis on these things, upon great healing, revivals, and miracles being worked. He wasn't against them. He's talking about we put too much emphasis on them. &gt;&gt; He said, "But many will come to me in that day and say, Lord, have I not cast out devils in your name? Have I not done many mighty works?" And I'll say unto them, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I did not even know you." They were used to preach. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They had many mighty signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And like the prophet tells us in the church age book, he said, when you go to start pinning them on the word, they'll always fall back to the same argument. We get results, don't we? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, notice he said, "What a disappointment that will be." I don't know about you, but I don't want nobody to miss it. &gt;&gt; I don't want nobody to miss it. &gt;&gt; If you do, you need to you need to you need to say, "Lord, let my heart be right." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I don't want nobody to miss it. This is why God sent his word. This is why the ministering of the word is so what? We don't want to miss it. Listen, the rapture is not a haphazard affair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like, well, you know, I'm around the message, so you know, I just it's just going to happen to me. It ain't a half-hazard affair. the rapture. The prophet said he's coming for those who not not believe in his coming but are living for his coming. &gt;&gt; Because if we really believe it, we live for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says, "Now notice love, God's love, it'll take the place of speaking in tongues, and that's all right. It'll take the place of gifts and wonders and signs and everything else." I know you you get into dealing with saying this quote and then you you get what it is. You get complexes that come out firing long list of quotes and things and well never done away with the gifts. Brother Bram wasn't even saying that right here. He's talking about what comes back to the real important thing. You know friends, that's why you know what that's why I believe just preach the message. It don't need to be manhandled. &gt;&gt; Preach it. God will vindicate it. God will see this word gets to where it needs to be. He don't need my help. He don't need your Si. He only needs our womb to receive it and believe it. &gt;&gt; Listen, God has the anointed cherubams watching over his word. And when the spirit of God has come into our life, we are anointed right there with those cherubams. And our life is not facing away from the word. Our life is facing with the word. And no matter where the spirit of God moves, it moves us forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if there's something that's moving us backward, that ain't the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; It might be fear coming along. Oh, I fear I fear we left this or I I'm afraid we need this. I'm We don't need anything to prop the word up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't need anything to make the word more powerful than what it already is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why brother Brandon when he made the statement in the Pergamian age, he said, "I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst." &gt;&gt; Are we impressed enough with it? Or do we have to try to bring other things into it and build other things around it? Yeah. Yeah. It's the word, but but but no, it's not but but but it's the word himself that's among us. &gt;&gt; The living word. I'm not talking about a letter. I'm talking about the living Lord Jesus Christ. the promise that he made. That's what the message of the hour is. It's the promise that God made for this hour. &gt;&gt; Notice he says, "If you haven't got love to accompany that, what good does the signs do you?" &gt;&gt; Right? You haven't got love. Like brother talked about that Pentecostal kitten, keep petting it this way, everything's all right. It'll just move. Oh. Oh, it just moves so good. Rub it the wrong rub it the other way. &gt;&gt; Where'd that come from? It was there the whole time. &gt;&gt; It was there the whole time. You see, divine love is what's got to accompany these gifts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because why? The gifts must be submissive to the word. &gt;&gt; That's what makes it submissive. If it's not divine love, it will become selfish. &gt;&gt; It will become about self. &gt;&gt; And that's where brother Bram says, don't pull your gift away from the body. Let it blend &gt;&gt; with the body. &gt;&gt; Oh, let it blend. I'll let it be put it right up here in the corner. I want my gift. No, no. God wants it to blend. &gt;&gt; He wants it to blend. &gt;&gt; He wants it to blend. How many of you that's what I want to do? I want to blend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Notice notice it'll take the place. He didn't say it would do away with tongues. It'll take the place. It'll be the love of God setting down. And the love of God is what is in supreme control. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If you haven't gotten love to accompany that, what good does the signs do? God's tried to do it across the nations, but it wouldn't work. the greatest of all of the gifts. He talks about the greatest of all the gifts that you know he says that there is is wisdom. The second is knowledge. If you haven't got knowledge, you haven't got wisdom. And how can you control your knowledge? &gt;&gt; Remember brother Ram talks about I think it was Morris Ungram. I think that's the right name. You know that or I I know where the message is at. Remember brother Bram talks about he said when he closed that door they were sitting in that hall and brother Bram talks about how they closed that door and those men the way they were doing with the trinity and everything else not up in Chicago but in another place he closed that door and he started in on them men he said you bunch of ignorammes said you know he had a lot of knowledge he said but if he only tempered a little that with a little bit of love he said he called them everything you know just ignoramises and everything else but if he would have just tempered it with a little bit of love. Now notice, hallelujah, seek the first things first. We've gone after gifts. We've gone after this. We've gone after that because the supernatural was done. But brother, don't seek gifts. Seek don't seek favor with the denomination. And let me just tell you something. You might think we're beyond denominations. Yep. God has brought us out. But denominations is not a brickandmortar building. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit of exclusivity. &gt;&gt; If you're in our fellowship, if you believe like we believe, if you have in the ministry that we have in, if you do this and you do this, let me just say this to you. If I was invited to preach in a return ministry church and I felt led of the Lord to go, I would go there and try to be a help to those people. And let me tell you, I would not blast return ministry. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; If I was invited to go and preach, I don't even know if there's I think there's a few Seven Thunder churches maybe left and other things like that. But it it and I'm not against going because you say, "Well, you know why? Because there's some of God's sheep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's some of God's sheep. It might be off here or off there. Listen, friends, there's got to be a place of certainty. I'm not up here wondering am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am am I standing on the right grounds." I mean you you can't have that as a pastor. You can't even have it in your own homes. Well, I don't know if I'm right. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm right. Maybe. You can't have that. It's got to be a certainty. But that certainty can't be a man-made certainty. It's got to be a certainty that goes beyond the reasoning of that man and beyond your reasoning because God will say things and do things that many times is not even reasonable. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell me opening a sea is reasonable. Tell me. Tell me taking down walls and leaving one part up with with a little harlot on it. Tell me that's reasonable. &gt;&gt; Tell me the last time you ever seen that done. Tell me the last time when a river is flooded its banks that it was ever parted. &gt;&gt; Tell me that that's reasonable to cross it at the most flooded time. &gt;&gt; But God has a way &gt;&gt; of doing things that's unreasonable. You know why? Because sometimes, not intentionally, we can get to leaning &gt;&gt; to our own understanding. &gt;&gt; And God has a way of so working to draw us away &gt;&gt; from our own understanding. &gt;&gt; You know what does that love? &gt;&gt; Not what he demands. &gt;&gt; His love. &gt;&gt; My lord. My lord. So here we have notice brother Brandon says we've gone after gifts because the supernatural done. But brother, don't seek gifts. Don't seek favor with the denomination. Seek the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not about trying to get in with a group and him with a special fellowship. Oh, if I can get in with this or if I can get in with that, the only thing I'm interested in getting in, I'm interested in getting in more with him. &gt;&gt; That that's what I want to do because everybody that the the desire that I have, if everybody else has that desire and getting in with him, my goodness, we'll have a good old time. But you see, sometimes individuals can compromise on things to get into certain fellowships. &gt;&gt; They want to preach in certain areas. They want to do certain things. And so there's certain little things that they value. And maybe God doesn't even want them or to use their gift even in around in that place. God uses his gifts as he sees fit &gt;&gt; and to whatever frequency &gt;&gt; he wants to use them. God can use a man and all of a sudden that frequency is over. &gt;&gt; It's done. God's used God's God's worked through that that gift and that office into that place to where it's come to that place that it's enough. The right emphasis. So let's look here at the right emphasis here just just a moment. Let me let me guess. Let let me just try to close on this here on the right emphasis because there's a lot of emphasis and sometimes emphasis is the way things are said sometimes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Sometimes the way things are said such as getting done with a service, preaching has gone forth and now here will come an individual and my now we want to we want to be careful. We want to be still. We want to see if God will say something. Hadn't he been saying something? &gt;&gt; You see, one little thing like that has become a point of emphasis. &gt;&gt; And without it being said, if if it was down, say, "Wait a minute. Are are you are you saying and placing a gift? If if it's a discernment, a gift of prophecy, by the way, it's got to be tried by two or three. &gt;&gt; I don't care if the man's had 10 out of 10. If this is 10, if this is number 11, it's to be tried. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Don't matter who it is. Don't matter what's been happened, it's to be tried. I'm not saying that to be indifferent. I'm saying that because that's the word. &gt;&gt; And it's also the very thing that brother Brandham went to brother Neville about under the direction of the spirit of God because people were going and always wanting to pull something out of brother Neville. Pull something out of brother Neville. You think friends sometimes the wrong emphasis can get placed &gt;&gt; and people are chasing after this &gt;&gt; this man to pray after me. This one let me tell you sister you may not be able to get where anybody is but God's called you to pray for your children &gt;&gt; to pray for your needs &gt;&gt; and you are thought of just as much in the economy of God. Brother Brandham would spin countless quotes over and over so that the people didn't look when a service or a great meeting was over as though it's all over. Brother Brandham said you're a pastor. These other ministers, he said, "You as a daughter of God or a son of God." You know why? This message was not about highlighting a personality. &gt;&gt; It was to lift up the name of Jesus Christ. Not any other name, not any other church. It's to lift up Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's a love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the right emphasis is Christ. Remember, Brother Brandon talks about voice of healing. He said, "I've got a problem with voice of healing." That was originally Brother Brham's magazine. You know, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was deceived into turning over. Oh, that may bother you, but it's true. He was deceived in turning over. He even knew, when I say deceived, he really wasn't deceived, but what it was, he knew what was coming. that a man was coming to present for him to sign over his tent in that magazine. And that man was supposed to be his friend. &gt;&gt; And brother Bram went ahead and signed it over. Look how brother Ram this this You understand what I'm saying? I look at the quality. &gt;&gt; I look at the quality of the spirit. He could have got up and exposed that man. &gt;&gt; Told that these papers were about something else other than what they were about. But look at it. &gt;&gt; If your enemy takes your coat, Give him a cloak also. Couldn't remember. I was going to say hat. And don't give him the kind. Don't give him the one you going to give to Goodwill. Give him the one that Brother Brand was brother Brandon magazine. You see, Brother Brham didn't get up and say, "Uhuh, now the Lord showed me that you were coming in here and and this is what you were going to do and and this is He could have. &gt;&gt; He knew it, &gt;&gt; right? They thought they were deceiving him. He knew it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Let me get back to my point. The Voice of Healing magazine, he said, "You know what the problem is?" He said, "Everything he said in their magazine, he said, they keep on writing about and this man prayed for this such and such and this and this man prayed for this and this and this and this happened and and you know what some of the miracles they were writing about? They were writing about Brother Brandom." But brother Brandham, he took issue with it. He said, "The problem is they're lifting up too many other names." He said, "There's only one name that's the biggest name, the greatest name. That's the name of Jesus Christ." That's the heart of this message. This message never came to put emphasis on a city, on a church, on a personality. This message is the lifting up of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Andraise. &gt;&gt; You think the love of God ain't powerful? &gt;&gt; Look what the love of God did when it took a little old Kentucky man didn't even have a seventh grade education. &gt;&gt; A man that had complexes probably that this building wouldn't even be able to hold. When he would walk down one side of the street, people would walk on the other side. Didn't want nothing to do with him. You think there wasn't a testing and an overcoming in his own life, but you watch how the spirit of God overcame even the temptations to put forth William Brandham that Jesus Christ might be put before the people. I don't know about you, but I look at that right there and I see the victory of Calvary not just in William Brandham. I see the victory of Calvary through you and I. Above every complex, above every family strain, above every hurt, above things that's took place, I see the prevailing power of the love of God and what it will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To where his resolve was, there's no one ever cared for me like Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's no greater friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he &gt;&gt; and he operated from that reality &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And that's what was brought to you and I this message &gt;&gt; of divine love &gt;&gt; which love is what produces &gt;&gt; faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith gives us a confidence in every situation &gt;&gt; that he loves me. and I love him. &gt;&gt; And that masters the circumstance. &gt;&gt; You love him tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord willing, we'll pick up here again on the right emphasis. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank God for his mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see friends, this is where it all comes in. To be based from everything in our life is to know that we've passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; To know what we was and what we are now. &gt;&gt; It wasn't you or me that came looking for God. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother Sam, I had a desire, but that desire wasn't your desire. &gt;&gt; That was God's desire. &gt;&gt; That was God's desire working in your life. And as a matter of fact, the prophet said you as the spirit of God would begin to move upon that word in the fulfillment. He said that is what is making the pool upon your life in this hour. It's the spirit of God that's pulling us, drawing us into perfect obedience. It wasn't you seeking God out. God sought you out. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; God sought you out, not you seeking God out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. Can I read this quote to you? I know I said I was going to I was going to close. Let me just read this to you. Let me let me read just a little part of it. I I promise I won't read it all. I'll try not to. He said, 'When we were sinners, I wanted to read scriptures, but I I want to read this here. When we were sinners, alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud, as I talked this morning, God come to us. &gt;&gt; God sought you. You never sought God. &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except the father draws him first. You &gt;&gt; understand it wasn't you. It's not your desire. It's not even what you wanted. &gt;&gt; It's God's desire. &gt;&gt; Direct quote, great warrior David. He said it wasn't your desire that you're a Christian this morning. You are a Christian by God's desire. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not going in a rapture by my desire, even though I desire that. I'm going in a rapture by God's desire. It's God seeing to it. It's God bringing correction in my life. It's God giving me the grace that I need right now. Cuz it's God's desire, not my achievement. The rapture is not your achievement. It's not a church's achievement. It's not a prophet's achievement. The the rapture is the achievement. For he said, "I will present to myself &gt;&gt; a glorious church &gt;&gt; without spot, wrinkle, blemish, or any such thing." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Won't be any denies. Didn't I, Lord? Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I deny? Didn't I? Didn't I? Didn't I? &gt;&gt; Nope. Won't be in that. Didn't you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Lord, when I felt like giving up, &gt;&gt; didn't you come, Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When I felt like, Lord, I was nothing, &gt;&gt; didn't you? Pour out your sanctifying love. &gt;&gt; Lord, when thoughts were overwhelming me, didn't you? &gt;&gt; Didn't you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Maybe we're standing there and in that and just pouring out praises before his throne. Somebody else say, "Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I I I got some praise to pour out here, &gt;&gt; Lord. When I was lost, didn't you found me?" &gt;&gt; Lord, when I felt like nobody didn't love me, but didn't you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't you, Lord? Didn't you, Lord? When I felt like I couldn't make another step, didn't you, Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. You're talking about the praises and the anthems ring. &gt;&gt; No wonder David said in the Psalms, "He hath created Zion to praise." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our lives are a praise. He has built up our walls. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Stone upon stone, word on top of word, life on top of word. He has built him, his body, his dwelling place. &gt;&gt; That we would show forth the praises. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand. Brother says, "Look at this. God came down in that muck. In that muck, he became one of us. Body of humiliation. Let me bring it on down. He came right down in the muck we were in." &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; He came right down right to where we were. cuz he knows we surely didn't have the confidence to even lift up our head. But God came right to where we were. I don't know what pig pin you were in. Oh, you could be sitting right in the message church. And the message church is not a pig pin, but we could be living in a pig pin in our lives, &gt;&gt; but the spirit of God will come right down right where we're at. And you know what he begins to do? He begins to make known his love to us of what he did for you and I. You know the one thing that's so powerful about the love of God, the love of God when it's projected, it does not project to us that it that he felios our condition or he likes the things that are being manifested. No, no. But the agape love looks beyond all of that. And that's the real love of God. Right? &gt;&gt; That's how God tells us to love agape one another. &gt;&gt; And if we're agape, if we're under that direction of agape love, then the spirit of God can direct our felio love in the right way. Man, I if I get going on this, we'll just have to sit back down. That ought to create a perfect love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look what you was and look what you are. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we spade too long on that comma. &gt;&gt; Look what you was. &gt;&gt; A comma means a brief pause for you to turn around &gt;&gt; and look what you was. Not looking back. Oh, I was this. I tell you, I don't know. Oh, man. Yeah. And the devil. Yeah. Look, you've done so much. You've done too much. You did this. You did. No. No. But then by pausing, the whole thing is is to look what you are now. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You didn't do this. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; This is not a church life. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; A church life is like good homemade icing on store-bought cake. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be something that starts on the inside. You know what? Anytime I've watched I I've watched my my my sister-in-law Mina. I've watched her amazing making cakes. I mean, she could just she she could put them all out of business with the cakes she makes. and so so meticulous that that gift fell straight from Sister Mary and just working with all those things and such intricate. She had a cake that looked just like a basket. It looked like too good to eat. But she knows I love that buttercream icing that's made on that cake. But you know when she would make the cakes I would go in there when I'd be down there and you know what you make the cake first. Them cakes are sitting out and cooling. All you can think about is once they get icing on them. Now, I know some people don't like icing. I'll pray for you. But you know what? A cake for me, it's got to have some icing on it. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; It's like trying to eat pancakes without syrup. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Once again, is that any spiritual thing? No. Can we differ on that? Yeah. You might baptize yours and someone may not. That's kind of like someone liking this kind of music and someone not liking this kind. It's preferences. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Right? &gt;&gt; But you see, you you got to let that stuff you got you got to let it come around and then eventually they'll make the icing. And see, that's how the spirit of God works in our life. Divine love works from the inside &gt;&gt; out. This is why it's not something we take and smear on on the outside. Well, I got to have more patience and and we're smearing it on on the outside. &gt;&gt; Ain't going to work. It &gt;&gt; ain't going to work. You can have divine love even in your soul, which is where it has to be. That's &gt;&gt; right. It has to be there &gt;&gt; for the rapture. That's the seal of the living God. &gt;&gt; But but even when God begins to deal with our lives and we realize we need more patience, what it is is God's calling us to come deeper in fellowship &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; See, putting on that garment, sinking into it so that it's him that's more visible. It's not your patience. It's not my patience. &gt;&gt; It's God's patience. That's where the scripture said, adding increasing patience, increasing virtue in our lives. Look what you was and look what you are. &gt;&gt; What did that? Somebody that loves you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wish I had the strength to put the emphasis the prophet did right there with that exclamation point. What did that? Somebody that loves you. Oh, you mean it wasn't me. It wasn't my work. It's what you yielded to. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; You couldn't help it. &gt;&gt; Are you understanding? You couldn't help it. &gt;&gt; There was things that you and I were in that we loved. &gt;&gt; Hello. We love the world. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We were in the world because our nature was like that. &gt;&gt; But what started to turn our nature? The Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His word never changed. You might have sat in a message church for 20ome years. God never changed his word, never changed the message. He changes our thinking about it. &gt;&gt; And you know where that thinking is? In our heart. &gt;&gt; What did that? Somebody who loves you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And can't you have faith in what he's promised you? Then real genuine love will create a confidence in his love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He caught me when I was nothing. I'm still nothing, but I'm in his hand. He caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable. He loved you when you was unlovable, but he changed you. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Think about that. You, you and I, we were unlovable. And remember, the prophet tells us he had to give us a new spirit so we could even get along with ourselves, &gt;&gt; right? And a new heart, new way of thinking. God had to do that. God did that. But he didn't stop there. Aren't you glad? He said, "Then I'll put my spirit down there." That's right, &gt;&gt; God. The way he has been opened up and then I'll put my spirit in the midst of you and I'll cause you to keep my ways and walk in my word. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Just like the colored sister said at the time of her testimony, "I'm not what I ought to be, not what I want to be, then I'm not what I used to be." &gt;&gt; She knowed she had come somewhere, something had happened, and that's the way it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. not what I was. I'm not what I want to be. But I know one thing for sure. &gt;&gt; I'm not what I used to be. &gt;&gt; And with that revelation right there gives us the strength &gt;&gt; and confidence to master the circumstances that would be faced in our lives. Whether it's complex, whether it's offense, whether it's healing, whatever it is, sir, &gt;&gt; might be a loved one, a loved one that's gone wayward toward, it gives us confidence &gt;&gt; in his word. &gt;&gt; And it creates a perfect faith in the midst of that circumstance to trust God, &gt;&gt; look beyond. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father. Oh God, no wonder when they would go, the songwriter who would write the song, the love of God. No wonder, Lord, that inspiration like your prophet tells us, men that are inspired, they come to a real fine line in their minds in those times. very very crucial moment to be able to break back into that place of reality or back into that place because that man in under that inspiration how that can go in many different ways and here he was he wrote on the wall of a insane institution sitewart the love of God how rich and pure just another testimony that the love of God never fails. That man's mind might have failed natural. There might have been heartaches in his life. I don't know. I I don't know the story about his life. The writer, Lord, it's it's unknown, I believe. But that just goes to show as your prophet said that certain things could come around our way. He says it like this in the message testimony. A fever might come and cook our brain. But that's why it's important to accept the Lord Jesus while we're in our right mind &gt;&gt; because the Lord though that man's mind maybe how he would have been declared maybe the what he was dealing with. I I don't know. But I do know this that once the seal of the living God has come on the inside, your prophet says, Lord God, even as a person, he talks about even some as they would get older and maybe lose their mind. He would talk about somebody going completely insane in the demonology series. He said, "But if that seal, if that seal of the Holy Ghost is upon that soul, that don't have one thing to do with that soul." Oh God, I'm so glad for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, to me that's a living proof that charity never fails. Certain things about our lives, even things right now that we're able to do, if you Terry, we won't be able to do them after so long a time and so long of years, but charity never fails. &gt;&gt; The love of God in that man's life, he would yield and come under that inspiration and begin to write. The love of God, how rich and pure, how measurless and strong, it shall forever more endure the saints and angels song. Oh God, I pray, Father, Lord, if there's one here tonight that has not come to that place to really know the love of God, the love that you have for them. May they look away, Lord. I pray. May they catch a glimpse of how that you came down and you took upon flesh, made in the likeness of sinful flesh, became one of us, that you might understand us. But the top priority is that you might redeem us. You might pay the price and make a way that we can come back into your presence, Lord. Oh God. Hallelujah. Where the blood of bulls and goats could never do away with sin. It only could cover. But God, it spoke through the innocency of those animals that there would come an innocent one who would die for the guilty. Oh God, how we're so thankful. May that revelation break, Lord, over the life and heart tonight. May they see it was not a demand. This lamb, his life was not demanded. Hallelujah. Glory be to God. The Bible said, "For the joy he endured, for the joy that was set before him." Glory be to God. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you endured the cross. You endured the humiliation. You endured that. Lord God, you endured that time of separation for the joy that was set before you. that you would look ahead in time and see the result of that decision where it would take darkness and where darkness was and lives that were under sin, under the muck and gum of this world, Lord God, and in despair, but the light of Almighty God would move down, Lord God, and break chains. illuminate hearts and lives, Lord, and lead us from under the grip where Satan was holding us. and bring us into the kingdom of your dear son. You saw the joy, Lord God, &gt;&gt; of what would be produced through and by the renting of the veil, the opening of that blood cell and the sending back of your life. You saw the joy, Lord, our lives being transformed. &gt;&gt; You saw the joy. &gt;&gt; You looked beyond the cross. And because you went to Calvary, we now Lord by the grace of God have been accepted in the beloved the spirit of God coming and making real to us. I wasn't there. I wasn't there 2,000 years ago as far as in this corporal body, this physical body, but we were in you then. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were right there in you then. We went to the grave in you. And when you got up on that Easter morning, we got up with you. Every one of the attributes, genes of God were right there. As your prophet said, he made me pay for my sins. Right there, Lord God. And now the spirit of God is sent back to make it real to us, Lord, to raise us from death unto life. What What is this? What is it that has come among us? The love of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Rich and pure. &gt;&gt; Not the idea of a man, not the emphasis of a man, but the love of God himself and the grace of God calling out grace. grace unto it that there's no situation, &gt;&gt; no condition, &gt;&gt; that grace is not able to take care of. &gt;&gt; Oh God, thank you Lord. Thank you for finding us, Lord. Thank you for spend Lord sending your spirit after us. &gt;&gt; I want to bring it right here tonight. Thank you for finding us in our thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you for finding us, Lord, through this week and through this day, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your mercy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. Maybe you got a need on your heart. You just want to make it known by an uplifted hand to the Lord. Lord, my confidence is in you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Your word, Lord. You're not a man that you should lie. God, your word cannot fail cuz you cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm trusting in you, Lord. Whatever that need is, that that petition, our love, reaching back to him and faith is mastering that it's over. And I know and faith is not about knowing how. That's not what faith is. But faith is just that simple deposit. It's a substance of things hoped for, expected. We're expecting you, Lord, according to your word. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Granted, Lord, I pray, Father. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Even among our families, among our homes, help us to put the right emphasis. Lord, &gt;&gt; yes, Lord, &gt;&gt; help us to put the emphasis in the right things. Lord, help us not to put the emphasis upon natural things of this life. We have to have natural, Lord, as far as education and other things we have to do. That's true. But Lord God, as your prophet would tell us over and over, and I think two messages, God's power to transform and power transformation, he said, "Don't ever let education become your God." Lord, I believe you've given us skills. I believe you've given us talents, &gt;&gt; but I want it all to be under you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want it to be under you. Granted, Lord, &gt;&gt; in our homes, may every mother, every father, may we put the right emphasis, Lord, emphasize the right things. emphasize not only the word but emphasize the character of Christ with our children, our loved ones. May we emphasize the right things, Lord. So Lord, be the emphasis through us. How many would ask that? Lord, &gt;&gt; be the emphasis &gt;&gt; of my life. Be the emphasis of my life. Lord, let it be Christ and Christ alone. Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Could we just Could we just take just a few moments to worship him? He I know he deserves more than that and I've kept you. I've went a little longer here. Go ahead. We bow our hearts. We bend our knees. Oh spirit come make us humble. &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord we turn our eyes from evil things. Oh Lord we cast Lord. So give us clean hands. Give us pure hearts. [Music] Let us not lift our souls to another. Oh, give us clean hands and give us pure heart. [Music] Let us not lift our souls to another. Oh God, let us be the generation that see that'll seek your face. Oh God of Jacob. Oh God, let us be a generation that seeks that'll seek your face. Oh God of Jacob, bow our hearts. We bow our hearts. We bend our knees. Oh spirit come make us humble. We turn our eyes from evil things. Oh Lord, we cast down our idols. So give us clean hands and give us pure hearts. [Music] Let us not lift our souls unto another. Give us clean hands and give us pure heart. Let us not lift our souls to one another. Oh God, let us be the generation that sees that'll seek your face. Oh God of Jacob. [Music] Oh God, let us be the generation that seeks that'll seek your face. Oh God. Oh no God. Let us be the generation that seeks that'll seek your face. Oh God of Jacob. Oh God, let us speak of the generation that seeks that seek seek your face. Oh God of Jac. Oh God, let us be the generation that see that seek your face. Oh God of Jacob. Oh God, let us be the generation that seeks that seek your face. Oh God a J that seeks your face. Oh God the shen. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Many different needs Lord that's among us. There's many that's went up. Prayer request uplifted hands. And Father, those needs, Lord, that we've brought before you, Lord, even this prayer cloth, Lord, that I've preached with and I hold in my hand, Father, I pray, dear God, Lord, as we stand here, your prophet would say it over and over. We're not St. Paul, but you're still God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I I say it tonight. I'm not St. Paul. I'm not William Brandham, but you're still God. And we're your children, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, Father, I pray God the same quickening power &gt;&gt; that Lord has changed our lives, Lord, turned our lives around, dear God. I pray, dear God, that Father, as this is applied, Lord, God, may every evil spirit be driven back, Lord God. &gt;&gt; May the grace of God move down, Lord, I pray in that room, Lord God. May the spirit of almighty God just move and take control, Lord God. Grant him, Lord Jesus. But Lord, as your prophet said, he said, there's an old God dishonoring proverb that says that God helps those who can that that'll help themselves. He said, but no, God helps those who cannot help themselves. &gt;&gt; And Lord Jesus, you see this need, Lord God. Now, Father, you're still the same light that penetrated that darkness there, Lord, in Genesis 1. You're still the same God, Lord, that moved back the darkness in our lives, Lord. Father, as Paul said, some at one time we were darkness, Lord, but now are we light in the Lord. So, Father, our confidence, our rest, Lord God, is Father, in the grace of God that Lord drove back the darkness from our life, Lord. and where the light of God has come in Lord to illuminate our lives. I pray heavenly father may the great value of Calvary Lord God and your resurrection Lord your word that you've sent in this hour Lord God may it Lord I pray God move Lord in a very special way Lord may the waves of the Holy Spirit Lord I pray move Lord in this moment for this need you see the need Lord of this young lady's life and we ask it now Lord for your glory we ask it Lord Lord, in the name that's above every other name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. For there is no higher name. There is no greater name than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is through that name that every devil must bow, every demon must bow, Lord God. For it is through that name, Lord God, that hell was defeated, the grave was conquered, Lord God, and the victory was won, and the Holy Spirit was sent back, Lord. So in the name of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; house of hell give way &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
