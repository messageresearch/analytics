amen how we thank God God for his Mercy this morning amen want to amen just greet you in the name of the Lord and to remember after the service here we have a time of Fellowship there at the um Heritage Presbyterian Church most of you have been there before certainly would um looking forward to that time as well um glad to hear uh the report with uh sister Anna I'm so thankful to the Lord for his mercies within that we want to continue to just continue to remember our sister in prayer that the Lord would just continue to touch her and give her strength amen through through it all amen I believe there's there's nothing impossible with God that's right I I believe I'm standing in the in the midst in the company of other believers who believe likewise there nothing impossible with god so let's just approach the throne of grace this morning morning and we just want to remember her remember different ones that are not among us here this morning I know there's been different ones recovering from sickness so let's just ask the Lord just to move in a special way heavenly father thank you Lord for this beautiful day you've given us Lord thank you Father for Lord strength in our body Lord thank you Lord for a sound mind thank you Father Lord for your mercies once again this morning they were new Lord and we just Lord ask oh God that you would just help us in a very special way Lord there are many needs that's Among Us this morning now Lord we just ask that Lord that through it all those Lord that are not with us Lord would be streaming Lord and not able to be here Lord with sickness things Lord I pray that you would Minister to them may you Minister Lord to sister Anna Lord I pray that God you just continue to move Lord upon her need as well Lord I also ask you to remember Sister OG in prayer that you would just continue to give her strength and her body Lord dear God is Lord just even in recovering Lord and sometimes Lord things want to linger Lord from sickness but Lord we're standing still steadfast upon the promise that by your stripes we are healed Lord so we ask that God that you would just move down for every need Lord that's here Lord You're God of every circumstance of every situation now Lord you know the needs that are before us this morning Lord even the things that you've placed on My Heart Lord to be able to bring now Lord there's no way I can bring it Lord in the way that father that you can so Lord as you know I've asked continuously let me just be a microphone Lord I I'd be just honored Lord I want you to be the preacher I want you to be the speaker this morning because we all have needs Lord and father we ask that you would just sweep among this congregation through every part of this building Lord from the conference room through the nursery through the forer through this assembly God May the presence of God just move Among Us in a special way this morning we just commit Lord every need and every situation into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning if you will turn with me to I'd like to turn our Bibles here to ro Romans chapter 12 and um I want to just read a couple scriptures from here and just ask the Lord's blessing and guidance here Upon Our Lives I also wanted to mention out there on the table where the prayer requests are at I know many of you have already uh visited there to check the address make sure everything is up to date on that for us as well as birthdays and anniversary iies and um so we just want to do that as well and I they mentioned uh regarding my mother-in-law and uh I see brother brother Brian they're not here this morning but brother Brian had a birthday as well and I was going to tease him a little bit and say I thought of a scripture at least the first part I have been young but now I am old and I was just course everybody knows me a little bit but but I'm glad that scripture is true even in the last part I've got a testimony I've never seen the righteous forsaken aren't you glad yes sir amen so forgive me for that but brother Brian was here he'd probably say I was expecting it so we just want to just look to the Lord here this morning in Romans chapter 12 and uh verse one Paul writes I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God now notice by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service now Paul's speaking very deeply to the Inner Man The Authority that's given to us because the nature that we were under when the New Birth has come that that nature that old man has died and there's a new man there's a new creation on the inside and then through the authority of that new creation that new Administration on the inside well our desires have changed our life has changed because of him and so then because of that we have an authority as Paul said by the mercies of God not by a mandate or a dictate but by the mercies of God that we would present our bodies a Living Sacrifice now I'll just be honest with you there's sometimes it's easy to be a sacrifice with some things than it is to be others but you know what through it all everything I want you to think about it if there had not been a sacrifice made for you and I that's right we would not be able to enjoy the life that we now have that's right yes sir because it's the character of that life that has come inside of us that is molding us shaping us and it comes to that display of the greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world now look at verse two and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye might prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God hallelujah don't you love the Lord amen amen God bless you as you're being seated this morning I'd like to just pick up on this thought where we were at the last time we were together out of Joshua 8 but I want to just Dive Right into this on on the times of renewal and I want to just hone in on this thought of of complexes and I want you to um understand I would say in this regards I want to just kind of put a little bit of a precursor here uh because the prophet was so apt to do that that when the Holy Ghost has come by way of the new birth brother Bram told us very clearly he said don't ever get in your mind that you're not going to make mistakes you will he said but if you'll and he refers us to those little figurine of three little monkey sitting on a desk and want got its eyes covered and ears covered and mouth covered and he said he said you know don't you know just turning away from that don't speak no evil hearing no evil just you know turning away from it don't doing any evil and um then he goes in just talking to us about just keeping our mind on Christ and and that's not that's not something that is altogether easy if if it was something that was just automatic then God would never have had to admonish us through the writings of the word as he did with Paul as well as where we stand with Joshua when God would remind Joshua that the greatness of the victories that you will have the success will be actually not so much when you're walking around the walls of Jericho but what you're entertaining in your mind and he would say meditate on the word of God and so we know that the word has life within it you know it's it's incredible sometimes there's words there's things there's images and a lot of things that we as we go through life and sometimes there's things that you can hear when you're at school you're at work or things you see and you just say Lord just just let that pass pass right on through my mind and yet it seems to be that where the enemy wants to continually try to flood us with things to where what God is wanting to instill in our hearts by his word that he wants to try to flood that out and get our attention in many ways and truly life itself is filled uh it it there there's a busyness there's all kinds of responsibilities it's almost like incredible of how to keep up with all the different tasks of life and we've got reminders for reminders and we've got reminders for those reminders and you know and so it just we understand how it goes it's we're living in a very complex time and an age and pressures and and all those other things but I want to just say it in this way that you know there's an element of it that what we have to understand more and more even though the mind is that of the No Man's Land it's attached there to that human Spirit but it's a place that we've got a choice to where that we can flood it with the things of God and that's a thing that when we look at I say God let I want to I want to F my mind I you know and this is where it comes to where when you're daily in your walk with God daily reading the word of God it's things that we're in listening to the message of the hour I I tell you friends even at times when you're going down the roadway and you just you may say well I only have 15 minutes let me tell you something God can do more for you out of things that he'll say in 5 minutes than what what we could do within a day's time and and who knows that I tell you this when I say who knows I have found it to be this way that there are times that here it is that maybe I've been listening to a message and I want to go back to a place that I've hearing this and I I do this all the time when I'm coming back and forth and I come into a place and it's just like as though right then and there it's speaking to the very particular need and things that are present and it's just an answer that comes from the Throne of God and I just say thank you Lord you know what it is it's the desire in our life as a Believer is I want my life to be under his influence amen I've got decisions I've got things that are going to lay ahead of me and I'm not naive to think that every decision I'm going to make is always going to be thus sayith the Lord decision I want to be purposeful and intentional under the leadership of the Holy Spirit I want to flood my life and see it's kind of like this if you you chop wood and you we have times when we have fire out here you don't you know um like a like a a fire pit we we will gather Woods a lot of times we'll purchase wood and then get it hot enough and we'll burn uh this stuff around here that really don't burn too good and you know we don't burn at all but sometimes it just depends I mean how long we go out there with the fire pit right depends on how many hot dogs that somebody eats or or you know marshmallows are roasted or or whatever more we may not burn it all and that's the same thing that when our lives are being filled with the good things of the Lord I I tell you if if we've got popups on our phone notifications on our phone then then I tell you we've got to be intention intentional in this hour in this time God knew we would be here in this time and you let me just tell you the word of God is just as effective it's just as inspired and it's more than enough to take care of every situation it really comes down to in our lives and us just really putting forth that effort I say God help us you know brother Brandon would take many times in the turn of the new year and he would Express like he did in the Revelation series there in 1960 and he would talk about how that he said let it become a habit in your life where you sit down and you read the word of God now I know sometimes when we think about that we think well that that that doesn't seem very spiritual but you got to remember here we are also it's on the inside it's taking control of all these other Realms because there's going to be times where we don't feel like reading or feel like praying yet there's a desire within us we we love the Lord but sometimes it's it's pressing Beyond I mean there's a lot of things sometimes we have to press Beyond right sometimes you have to press Beyond to say go out of our way to say a kind word right sometimes we have to kind of go beyond our way instead of just you know uh thanking the lord for dinner and you know going ahead and slurping it down we sometimes it's just enough to say honey I appreciate you putting all this together thank you for you know for for doing all this oh boy I hope we don't get off on the wrong foot right now you know but sometimes it it's those things that just moves within us in those times and and um you know we could spend a lot of time within that but I want to just say it in this way it it's times that where we're looking at in our life that don't don't let the enemy minimize that when brother B talks about that of habits it's time when we look at it start a good habit in your life start things in your life you know listening getting in you know and don't try to over over whelm yourself don't try to be you know a a superstar listen just little by little as a matter of fact as you start going even little by little look you'll find your life beginning to benefit Blossom it's strength coming in your life because of the word of God that's so good is that right yes now watch how brother B will take this from when we look back in our text on this EMP power transformation and I want you to think about where we're where we're standing here in this hour brother BR says now referring to that text that's what we all want to do is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word so God works on us the same God who draws us to himself the same God who moves down and and leads us to a place of full surrender and comes and changes our life completely fills us with his spirit that same God moves down within our life as we will continue to give ourselves to him it's the mind of Christ that begins to move down in our life and that's what we want to have operated in our life you see this is why when you look at the message of the hour we're living in the time for promises to be fulfilled we're living in the time as Romans 8 said that the whole earth is groaning and travailing it's longing for the manifestation of the sons of God we are living in the season of the adoption of Sons and Daughters of God and this is why the prophet of God as we've been laying it over and over he distinctly separates and says your adoption is not your birth it's the new birth then the same spirit of God that brought that brought about that transformation in your life the desires it's leading you to a full adoption this is why you refer to the quot the quote that you've heard me refer to out of you must be born again and brother BR says I hear some are teaching that oh he says here you are you're you're born again today and and tomorrow you're a fully matured Son of God and the prophet's words are that's nonsense right because even in our own natural life now look look friends I'm not here to try to figure it all out I don't even know how everything coming to PL coming to pass when I think about we're waiting on that last one to come in I I'm just going to say it to you like this the last one coming in may not even be outside of these walls cuz remember it's not about coming the last one coming in isn't about that just coming into salvation it's where that name becomes splashed beneath the bleach of the blood and it's filled with the spirit of God so it may not even be out there but in the meantime while I'm still here it might be and and I want to try to witness and encourage everybody else I want to try to witness and encourage others even if they are not ordained to see this light but I want to see him at the end saved just my desire to see him saved I mean you call me strange but you know all the way through my years anytime I'd listen to off a Moody Bible and hear that of Unshackled and and hear those testimonies and stories there was never a time that it didn't touch me when it was hit me in my eyes I would just begin to cry and thank God you say well there's there's a deeper walk yes but they might not be ordained to it but to see that they have experienced the Saving Grace of almighty God I tell you that makes me Rejoice because why I can I can Fellowship around that but we're called there's something in us that we didn't put in our lives it's a longing to be United with God that we did not even understand what was taking place some of the times we were happy where we were at but there was a longing in our hearts to move closer to move deeper even some of us some of you I think about brother Josh way as I'm looking at him now gave his testimony last February where he suffered there in those boarding schools where he renounced the Trinity and there they would you know lashes on him and everything else he stood a reproach for this word and to think some of us have not even been to that place physically but I want you to understand to think of how that there were things no doubt the flesh would want to go the easy route not take the lashes not Stand Out There Our flesh would want to go the easy way but let me tell you something it's worth it all when you can make a stand for almighty God he'll make us stand for you well brother Samuel my friends may leave me but he said if you'll forsake I'll give you friends I'll give you fathers I'll give you mothers I'll give you're not Jesus like the prophet said Jesus will never be outdone never be outdone hallu Hallelujah that's so oh thank you Lord so renewing and this time of renewal and I want to read a few scriptures here of where that God brings us to in Ephesians 4:22 do Paul would write and admonish us that you put off concerning the former conversation that's the character the the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind that ye may put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness that whole phrase of put on it means to sink like you did into your shirt or I did into my coat that's that's what it means and and and I just say it like this that wherever you're at in your life we all can go deeper sure amen and let me just say it like this that no matter what it is that you would be facing look in your life and say Lord take me deeper amen I I want to go deeper you know you say how deep you want to go I I want to go deeper so where that it's more of him on display and and more of a preeminence in my life to where you say how do I even know the word is being preeminent in my life look at your thoughts look at your life look at your actions look at how things that maybe before you would go and and kind of uncheck it and and reason it out but now there's things where God moving in your life and there's a molding there's a shaping there's a maturing that's going on and you don't become loose it becomes tighter yeah that's so true see the pyramid did not it does not start on the bottom like this and become wider that's the way Christianity is out there that's not the bride building the bride building is it starts out wide and it Narrows amen that's the same way in our life not only has God been doing that for the bride body down Through the Ages he does it with the church he does it with you and I as an individual and that growing narrow that narrowing down is a less of self and more of him doesn't mean that we're going to be able to just take self hang self up oh these certain things don't never bother me it's when you recognize I recognize as a son and daughter of God there's an authority that's given in us that is greater than heavens and earth and cannot pass away there is an authority inside of you there is a power that you can tap into that is greater greater now watch this in Titus Chapter 3: 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost now that that regeneration this is God dealing with that old nature and it's it's the holy spirit it's the word of God it's that washing of regeneration where it brings an absolute change on the side of our life remember he starts out with that and we begin to grow in our life it comes by the holy spirit this whole word of renewing it means to make new to repair and and and God comes by his Spirit he's the one that makes a new creation it it is God coming to ignite what he has placed on the inside that's what he's drawing upon the whole time that he's wanting us to come to a place of yielding and surrender but notice this renewing of the Holy Spirit it does not stop with that of the new birth it continues to go on and on you say how far will this renewing go on until the very atoms of our bodies have been renewed prise the Lord amen the quickening doesn't stop now let me just say this God's objective is not to make perfect people with perfect actions he's interested he knows the sufficiency of his word his word is perfect his blood is perfect his blood has brought a perfect loosening to where we're no longer yolked and held to that bondage of sin so it is the Perfection of our sacrifice if there's any glorying any boasting it's in the Perfection of our sacrifice and how we know he has moved in our life that's the real Perfection and through the strength of that Perfection is what moves and orchestrates and operates in our life to bring forth what God has intended to be brought forth how many believe that God's desire is to operate through your life amen amen that's what God wants to do listen the very first thing when God God spoke to Paul remember Paul was doing a lot of things but when he met Paul on the road to D ask because the very first thing when God revealed his name who when Paul asked who are you then remember what Paul's response was what would you have me do see because every time God reveals the Revelation it comes in a manner to put his subjects into action that's so good so whatever way that God chooses to use you or use me we don't have God don't want us to be alike he's not interested in that God if he wanted to do that he would have carbon copied every one of us we'd all look alikee everybody act alike everybody preach alike every every Church would be just exactly alike 10 pews here an organ God doesn't want that anybody can do that man can do that but God is the one who comes to lead his church and think about the great sovereignty sovereignty let me just say it while I'm on it sovereignty is not an exemption from Doctrine that's so true are you hearing I'm I'm a message church but you know we're Sovereign we don't have to go along with this if if you're a message Church sovereignty is not an exemption to say we'll follow this we won't follow that that's not sovereignty that's called Rebellion but sovereignty sovereignty is where there are things that might be done a little different we our music might be a little different when we take up offering might be a little different the way we do things might be a little different but always holding the standard and the doctrine of the word of that of the Apostles and the prophets and the foundation stone of the Lord Jesus Christen oh my prise God now I want you to listen this thought as we agreed with that God has put us to be uh channels brother Bram would say this in images of Christ I want you just to listen to this he says could we humble ourselves tonight and become transformed by renewing of our spirit by the holy spirit that we could yield our lips our eyes and your faith and my faith that he would come out in the audience and move in you and move in me to fulfill his word that he's a high priest of our confession you know I could probably preach a month on that right there now cuz sometimes when we think about the yielding of the sacrifice listen we Face the condition of this age and we cannot be ignorant or naive and think well you know those things are not going to bother me I want more if we're not careful this age is Anointed with a spirit of lovers of self where every decision is made on what's the best for me that's so yes sir that's the anointing that's upon this age and let me just tell you that's what happened because of the fall right and this is and so when we look at that sometimes coming to the house of God and being here is not about you getting needs met it's about your faith being lended and another part of Faith being lended and here we are standing as a body today may not be my day to come to that certain spot but I have have come been brought here by God that my faith can be y yielded and say Lord speak this morning you know the needs that are here in this building God showed that cooperation when they went in the land right you didn't just have to say well this is my mountain and I'm just I'm just going to go take this mountain that's true you have to have that resolve and that resolution but God also told those who chose even not to go over into the land he said you're going to come and help fight fight battles with your brethren after they're settled then you can go on back across that's good that's what we're here for it's like when we have things like this when sister Anna are ones it's a time to fight battles it's a time to pray it's a time to press it's a time to stand there because we have promises that are given to us how long do I pray pray till we're standing on the mountain pray till we see our sister sitting right here and God restoring her sight hallelujah we're fighting for every inch of ground this is not a picnic it's a battle and really really really we have a battle against the enemy but one of the greatest enemies we've got and it's the biggest one greatest one just the words of the Prophet it's our own self that's what it is go brother Ram goes on here and he says I'm going to want you to listen to this I read this one he said God help us to lay aside this morning is that a deceived Church by the world every toil of the day every care of this life you know I think that'd be good we come into the house of God you might say brother Samy that don't seem that deep but you know sometimes I we we Overlook the little things sometimes it be it would behoove us to just try it don't just try it what have you got to lose just try it come in here and sit down a little bit before service and say Lord help me to lay aside the cares of this life cuz I can't do nothing about him while I'm sitting here anyhow help me to lay aside the toils of this life help me just to put it in your hands let me tell you the Bible says if you seek Him First he'll add all these other things God can give you an answer and God can take care of a situation while you're right here in church trust him say Lord I put you first Hallelujah he said all the way from the janitor to the pastor that there would be nothing in our minds now but would be waiting listening reverently for the Holy Spirit to speak to us what we might accomplish something good to know more of thee by our gathering together for Lord truly that's what we come on this hot day it ain't a hot day but speak to us through thy Living Word and let the Living Word dwell in us and abide in us that we might be shaped and formed not to the world but be transformed by the renewing of our spirit into the form of the Son of God so right here taking that word into our life because it's not positive thinking it's the word that has life in it right the word has life in it now I want you to think about when God as we said a couple Sundays ago when God calls for a time of renewal Israel was already in Joshua 8 they had already returned to God there had been a full repentance aen that whole thing was moved out of the camp there had been repentance God had come down and through repentance then they go forth in obedience and then there comes Victory and then God would have them come to a place of a renewal where Joshua would would once again he would write on a stone all the Commandments again I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands because probably some of us been there where you were in school and you had to write one sentence I will not interrupt the teacher while they are talking and they said now you have to raise your hand now you have to write that 50 times you oh dear lord I mean at least I ain't getting a SWAT this time but you know you now that right there there's a reason they want want to do that I'm not here for that but I want to just bring it to this point when God told him to go to mount eel and mount gam and he told him cop a new p a new writing of the law not change it but rewrite it not rewrite it but write it again you see this is why there's things that God will bring us Peter said while I am with you I'm going to stir up your pure Mind by remembrance putting you in remembrance of these things and if you look at those virtues within there I I tell you for past months just that message of stature of perfect man just been pouring through that message when you look through there it might seem like man those things aren't real deep but I really wonder I really wonder within all of this of sometimes the emphasis of what's placed on the bride's Revival is not the bride's Revival there you go there you go when we can't have love and patience and tolerance for one another I I I that that's that that's not that's not an achievement so when I'm looking at you look at those virtues that are listed there there's there's a place within our life we want those things to continue to grow and to continue to Lord I I I need more patience in my life I need more of that in my life because let me tell you something the more that God as we will yield the more he adds to our life that let me tell you is just as Supernatural as somebody getting off a cot or walking out of a wheelchair we need those times and God knows sovereignly when we need them we don't need them worked up we don't need them planned out we just need to let God be God but that let me tell you somebody can get out of off a stretcher or out of a wheelchair and eventually if they live long enough they'll die or they'll get sick again but anything that God has added to your life by way of your character amen nothing can reverse that Hallelujah after all he's coming to Rapture character that's good so this is where what's really important within it all when God calls that time of renewal there's times of revisiting and I don't want to say we go away but sometimes God brings us back into the Simplicity of certain things because God is interested in his word being fulfilled in our lives and these are times that you know we can go look we got a choice we can go in our lives and look at it and say well you know I you know I I I I you know I I failed here and you know I repented and I thank God for his grace and and I I believe that I don't want to I probably sound nonchalantly on that but I'm not saying that you're nonchalant but sometimes it's got to come to a place and it takes God to call us to a place to say yes Fellowship is restored but we need to deal with the cause of it oh that's if not it's going to become a mountain that you continue to circle around so good now I'm not saying that it ain't going to be Temptation come and you won't be tempted in the same way but it's got to recognize that there is a Grace and a growth by the spirit of God that will help us to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks and to recognize that God in us has already overcome it that's two parts to overcoming right hallelujah hallelujah that's pretty powerful isn't it because we would think one thing and and sometimes in our mind our overcoming is well it don't bother me anymore no overcoming remember brother randam emphasized that it's to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks that's a first step and then recognize that God in you has already overcome it there's times where you have to be able to you stand right there and you're able to discern and recognize who it is and say I'm not going that way oh my now I want you to to think of this this are three things it requires discernment and boy we need the discernment of the Lord I I I I need I need his help and looking at things I need it because I I I'll tell you right now I won't see it in my life the way he sees it I guarantee you I mean to me my time might look straightening but somebody else said no it's crooked see with God there's things where you and I can look at and say man I I'm feeling pretty good I I I mean man I'll tell you what every P andq but God he knows how to bring it around to us and he doesn't do it to shame us amen remember he's interested in having the preeminence and His glory would be made manifest through every area of our life he wants listen the prophet said in Rising of the sun sharing in his victory thank you Jes that's so good honesty to stand before and say that's the truth Lord I'm I'm that that's the truth that that's what it's been right there there there's the culprit right there let me tell you in order for us to come to that place it's it's taken Hebrews 4:12 the word of the Living God it's taken the inspired word of God to come down into our lives in this hour let me tell you God demonstrated right here I'm not I'm not called to be a prophet you're not called to be a prophet that's not what God has called us to be God has that one major prophet that come God God doesn't God that's not necessary but what it is it's the word that was right there on the platform every night that was Discerning the conditions and many times situations why that people could not come to the completion of their healing was because there was things deeper in their life that they needed freed from right now you might call me strange but I I I I I got a little beside myself here even last week after brother Trevor mentioned one of the services I didn't say nothing to nobody but I just begin to worship because the spirit of the Lord just began to strike my heart as I stood here and I thought about different ones down through the prophet's Ministry even to where when they would come into certain places they they didn't understand what was taking place in their life they had no idea they thought I I've i' I've made this writer I've done this and they it's just but the spirit of God would so direct the prophet right down into those channels why because they weren't settled in their spirit and you know what I'm going to tell you if there's one thing we that we should aim within our hearts friends and we listen we've got a higher aim to aim and that's real forgiveness I'm telling you real forgiveness I'm not oh what the Samuel we're in the message what what does that mean what does that mean if that if it was natural Paul wouldn't have wrote it in the book of Colossians he wouldn't have wrote it in Ephesians 4 I I I believe that I don't believe that was Paul that did that I believe he was an instrument but I believe it was a spirit of God my boy we already got brakes pumping now well say Amen we'll take some services on it probably end up will anyhow but true you know we all we all want oh God forgive me remember remember what Jesus said he said that if you hold a in your heart against anybody he won't forgive you he won't forgive you I just say it here today if there's something that's tormenting you I just say God if there's something I need to make right if I need to loosen somebody that I'm holding a prisoner in my life so that I can have real spiritual Freedom Let Me Be Like Jesus who released me when I was guilty as a fox in a hen house yes Lord that's what the Holy Ghost come to do oh you may not be walking on water but God might call you to forgive like Jesus forgave come on friends we listen don't be ashamed say God help me maybe there's an Avenue and down in our life where we need the Holy Spirit and being honest to say Lord search me help me Lord I want you to think of this Psalms 139 this a powerful chapter David said search me oh God and know my heart what an invitation right try me and know my thoughts now remember this is the same chapter where David said thou knowest my Uprising and my Downs sitting you knew my members before they were ever wrote in your book my they were already placed there God you know all the thoughts oh how wonderful are your thoughts toward me the the closing scriptures of that chapter search me oh God I wonder if we come to the house of God how many times that that would be the require the desire Lord search me search me examine my life Lord search my life amen and see if there be any wicked way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting I need help Lord am if you find anything in my life I I need you you're my big brother I need you to help me Lord Lord now watch this brother takes this up in a and standing in the Gap within his own life of where a complex had formed in his life now I want you to notice these these words words when brother Brandon was asking the congregation to pray for him that God will place into his heart what he lost out there in that complex it's so easy to build a complex now I want you to notice I've mentioned this before but I want you to notice 63 June 23 this is 3 months after the seals have been opened greatest event in the prophet's Ministry this complex wasn't built overnight that's good right listen we take the land little by little that's good yeah that complex was not something that you know it's just like a manufactured home and you run it right through and no it was it was built now wh watch how the prophet places this aren't you thankful for this to me to me if it had been any probably any other oh edit that out oh edit now I better not say that I need to make myself look you see you know you know what you know what God did let me just say this to you you know where I stand on this you know what God did God took a Son of God that he was bringing to maturity and let you and I see the quality of what this spirit will do and bring to pass in an individual's life he could have took a man that had a master's degree or doctor's degree but God chose to take a man that didn't even have a seventh grade education showing it's not about how much we know hallelujah it's whether we can yield and trust God when even the prophet himself had met God in a personal way and God be to tell him what he was called to do and what he was going to do and he said I told him I will not be able to do this is that the words I will not be able to do this it's like Moses I'm not going to be able to do that I right but see God had already purposed for that and God built confidence by his word in the life of that Prophet yeah you so if we can look at it in that right way God took all of that and he showed you and I were a Son of God coming to maturity now watch this brother bam I want you to watch what he says uh he goes in the very next statement he says I had an interview the other day with with brother wayy and I tell you I've got to know more stories about brother way from being down in in Jeffersonville with good friends I've got down there and I thought Lord now I'm just going to tell you I'm just going to be honest with you I thought Lord there's a lot of things that boy you talking about the love of God if there's an example I can look at how the prophet of God interacted with him because there were some real things that you know but you know what you just look at that and you think well you know what God's so merciful and gracious to us all right yes he is he really is I'm not going to tell you all those things but any anyhow you know brother BR says it like this he said I had an interview the other day with with brother wayy a good man but built his self around a complex another kind of a complex so it was different than the one that brother brother brandham had he did the same thing brother way you can so easily do it it's just now watch this it's just you get a little something in your mind notice not a big something a little something in your mind you keep thinking that way go back now here's really the whole thing thing the whole synopsis of overcoming go back and check it with the scripture oh when when it gets built no we have to we're going to have to it gets built we got to tear it down but when it starts coming in one little small thing maybe it's something that you perceive a person has done maybe they actually have done it maybe it's your perception maybe it's something that has happened from you know earlyer on maybe it was you know like brother BR says you can get and think he said that all of a sudden that somebody walked by you and didn't shake your hand and he said if you don't watch you'll start entertaining that you'll get to imagining that that person has something against you and you will be the one that will begin acting differently towards them that is so good W it starts with one just one one one one little thing wow one little thing so no no notice this and you see listen Satan's a copycat are you hearing me Satan's a copycat this is not this is not something he came up with it's little by little Now watch how now look how brother says that he built his around the complex so it's and when brother B describes that it's not like the complex is something out there but his his life now he's build it around that complex so the way that he will actually respond or even process or even face situations will be the basis of that complex even though brother wayy is a good man he is a Believer but yet that complex has got things out of line if you notice how brother br will say this on and on through the message and you think about it he'll talk of how it's so easy to build a complex you know a lot of times you're going to build something you got to have materials for building right right that's right now the a lot of these right here you can get from Menard's Home Depot Lowe's a lot of them other places nandex on and on and on and on you can get that if you're going to build something you go and you select certain materials right but the difference with the complex is you don't get to select the materials that come to you because why would it be so easy to build a complex because of this negative right that's right so good and can come through each one of these things experiences sometimes it can even be effects from diseases that's come that is so good sometimes it's effect from Pain it could be from way back right all of these different things are actually become the material that come into a person's life I want to remind you brother bam would actually take the next service in flashing red lights of his coming that evening after what I just read you and he would say brother way just so you would understand that it wasn't about you but to understand he said that it's by discernment he said probably there's not a person in here that doesn't have a complex he said how many of you have a complex right now probably there would have been those at that time you know that maybe I don't have no complex maybe there have been those that you know were just on the spiritual part of it of no I'm not going to claim that I'm not but you know what brother bam said look at the hands that are throughout the building all the way through the building and he tells us it's so easy to build a complex so we can't put it off and say well the devil no Satan there's a there's situations that he can Inspire but it's up to you and I if we accept the material hey we got a load of material for such and such a dress just sign off on this right here and it depends on whether we sign off on it right now sometimes the reason listen when we sign off on it it's because we have based it on our own feelings yes sir oh my Lord sir everybody ready for Fellowship dinner I don't know about you but I don't want to go around the same mountains are you hearing me because all listen friends I believe in shouting I believe in worshiping but if all of our Shout and worshiping we continue to go around the same Mountain it's time for us to get before God and say Lord I just don't want victory at 15:30 Lake Breeze Road I want to walk with victory in my house in my life if I am in the midst of Babylon like Daniel was Daniel didn't even have the Holy Ghost like you and I do and he lived a Victorious Life by the portion he was allotted but it's up to you it's up to you but I can tell you God is present he's leading us to minister to these things in our lives I don't know about you but for me for weeks this has just been so exciting it's been things that I've looked at and said oh God thank you for your mercies you say why because many of the times the things that we see on the surface are not what needs dealt with it's what's beneath good all these experiences how did Brother Bram come of that complex he tells us I want you to think how how incredible that a complex could come a man that has seen Miracle after Miracle but he tells us in the message indictment that follows these messages I had become discouraged right right wow anybody felt discouraged sure absolutely sure Satan knows how to point it off he he even knows how to point things out he even knows how to point things out like he'd come around with Nehemiah and them ah ah this ain't nothing but a bunch of rubbish oh this will never happen and this will never and it just tries to get you discouraged what was happening to the prophet was he was preaching this message think about this ministering the message that God had given to him and seeing people not accepted right right do you realize brother Brandon when he preaches statue of a perfect man and he and he speaks on the virtue of patience he said what do you think about me when I've had to have patience where I have individuals still cutting their hair still wearing things after all these years but see God allowed that patience even to be formed in his life to me it's amazing how God and his sovereignty will be working in so many different ways God's not like you or I we get a project going in our house and we got to do this and we got to do that God works in a multifaceted way there's things that within a person's life that here they are they might be ever so wrong and yet God is working in their life to bring them to that understanding while at the same time working in our life to manifest longsuffering right it's overwhelming how God works God does not work in just isolated events it's all interconnected oh my how many say help me Lord help me Lord now brother B stood there he made a confession this is where the key was he made a confession discernment had come when the spirit of God identified to him this is a complex you've got because people won't hear you remember what he was going to do he was going to make a decision to just go out there in the wilderness and and just go off there and and you know what that was all about that was all about him that was all about that complex you understand how powerful that is here was a Ministry that God had placed upon this Earth but shows the human ity that was still right there around it had become so discouraged and that he had come with that complex and did not even recognize what was going on didn't even recognize why he was getting ready and had been abandoning the people he didn't recognize it let me tell you something you or I would not recognize things in our life if we can look at that the right way God had God took the prophet where he saw showed him the seven Peaks right there in Montana and begin to show him his name and he also pointed out to him about the bum on the side of the road the bum in the diner and he told him it's your decision I'm not going to make it for you but if you choose to go this way I just want you to know this your wife's going to leave you your family's going to leave you and your ministry is going to be ruined right see what it was God had a son there and he was had to make a decision see it just goes to show God's not going to make our decisions for us but when he entrust us with decision it's even a moment not about just making the right decision but it's God wanting to mold within us that character amen yes of being able to stand with honesty and realize why am I making right the decisions that I'm making no doubt no doubt through this congregation here this morning there's many of us we've made decisions out of complexes if we'll just be honest there's things no doubt that God has dealt with us time and time again and the mercy of God will continue to bring us along the way I want you to think about this and looking here in the scripture let me just move into this and deal with this just a little bit can I have just a few moments here I want to deal with a few of these here I know I'm not going to get into other places but I want to deal with this and I want to approach this here in 2 Corinthians Chap 10:3 and I want you to to notice the very familiar passage of scripture to us for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds well what's a stronghold it's a retreat it's a fortress it's any Reliance upon any reasonings of why I can't or why I am or why I do what I do that's a stronghold that's so see it's some where think about it then then you you didn't you didn't lot out land like when they do a subd development they buy a big old piece of land they go in there you see it all around they'll go in there and buy out that land and when they do then they've already got a plan of how they're going to lay out the roadways and the C to Sachs and how the flow of traffic's going to be and so when they do that then they'll bring the infrastructure in there and you know they're working on that dirt all you see is piles of dirt being moved and there's infrastructure there's gas lines being laid there's electrical lines being laid there's drain systems all that that stuff is being done and then eventually they'll start making the roadways through there once they start making the roadways what they've already had divided out with lots then they'll have those lots sectioned off at that time and to think about it you and I is are not the ones who made a choice as to far as to say you know what I think I'd like to have a stronghold in my life that's right in one way and yet in one way we have been guilty right but yet there's other things listen to me now yet there's other things that sometimes it isn't even been from what has taken place since God got a hold of our life right yeah sometimes the very things are things that we've experienced from even in childhood that's right sometimes the things that we experien school and other places pain rejection all those things let me just encourage you this morning there's not a man that you can read about or a woman down through the scripture that has not endured and went through complexes that's true we could pull them out over and over you think you think it wasn't a complex when they would be called Elizabeth the baren yeah there you go Seri the baren you think there wasn't a battle of a complex to be formed when Rachel could see Leah given birth right that's you see those things moving down through down through the scriptures you think there wasn't even in the prophets Elijah James a man subject to like passions as we are right Joseph on and on and on we could go but here come the perfect one yet he came and entered in to this walk that you and I walk he didn't come by sexual blood so there wasn't any tie of any strains that was being handed down from Joseph or from Mary he borrowed the womb God created amen his dwelling place but he came through him by the woman through the Virgin birth that he might undo what was done in the garden and restore that relationship with you and I to pay the ultimate price for our sins now listen the scripture has told us in Hebrews he was tempted in all points such as we are yet without sin right now you might look at your own life and sayl Lord I have fallen short many times but he is our Pascal lamb he is our Perfection and when that life has moved into us and brought us baptized Us in to his Perfection we are standing there redeemed subjects of almighty God oh sure we have these battles out here it can get sticky it can get susceptible to things that will come our way and let me just give you another word from the prophet as long as you're in this life this nature will bother you if it doesn't bother you you might say well brother Samuel I know so and so I I'm not that's what the prophet said as long as you're in this life so and so is going to bother you the real reality isn't so and so bothering you it's that you've got buttons you ain't surrendered to God there you go and God lets you have them buttons to prove the vi ictory in his in in your life come on Friends listen the change of the body we need more than just to go back to being young people if we went back to being young people we'd have more energy to get on one another's nerves a whole lot more Hallelujah come on friends we need more than that I need my buttons change you need your finger pushing buttons change we need changed all the way but in the meantime God said well I'm bringing you to your inheritance I've given you an earnest deposit said that you might have possession of this right here true oh my I don't remember where we were in the scripture now casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself this is what he was telling brother wayy to do against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ let me tell you something if if you think you're going to be strong enough to do that by feeding on ESPN on feeding on better house house grooming housekeeping I listen I'm not friends listen I don't believe God's against with with with things that there can be certain things of pleasure but you got to be careful what you're putting in your life that's true you got to take the word of God into your life that's why God told Joshua meditate on these things why do you think look look look look look look look look I don't even have Facebook and all that I'm not against that but why do you think stuff gets on there and things are put in a way to cause you to wonder that's so good this is put out there well I wonder who they're talking about wonder who they're running down that's right wonder who they're this wonder and then throughout the day you're meditating then you have things going on list listen no wonder no wonder the depression and anxiety listen friends it isn't just all the spirits that are congregating they've got to have channels to get in amen that's true it doesn't even make sense when you stand around even in youth meetings and look we're here to help but when I think of how it burdens my heart with things when you see young people dealing with depression and anxiety and suicidal Spirits it it should not be then you realize friends it's not only casting it off but we've got to look at where is it coming from that's so good cuz if you're taking a medicine that's making you sick we can pray and God can heal you but sometime we need the wisdom of God for God to say hey you need to stop taking that medicine you need to talk to your doctor about something different everybody with me absolutely all right notice this and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled I say how how how is my obedience fulfilled I'm I'm in Readiness to Revenge when my obedience is fulfilled obedience is that submission in our heart that's where Victory takes place is in our heart standing there before that that complex and saying is true Lord Lord I Need Your Grace I need your strength Lord so good I need your deliverance Lord see that's where obedience starts with even taking the discernment of the word and being honest that's why brother BR says I've made my confession before this congregation and did God work in his life God did now watch this God being misunderstood let me just let me just let me just take you through here just a just a couple my Lord I wish I wish we had two services today you don't understand I got to walk away with this and this got to be all bottled up brother brandom I am saved and have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from it's honesty watch well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn spirits it's usually a complex that causes this so it's going to the cause what's the cause of it either they have inherited it from a mother father uncle aunt or grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you'll Chase back down through your life he said I've taken into my experience under discernment because I've met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that Spirit and the first thing you know I'd chase that Spirit right back by discernment and find that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back there and you inherit it wow by Nature W that's good so so what H how can that be remember every seed will bring forth of its own kind the things that we do say our seeds yes true let me give you an example a brother had called me some time back and we were just fellowshipping about a few things and and we were just just talking about the word and he began to relay to me a situation I thought my it's incredible where in his life his father you know raised by his grandfather there his grandparents after times after Sunday evenings Sunday afternoons or whatever more instead of getting to play with the rest of the kids the grandfather would make his father sat in the chair in a Sunday afternoon and he said you know he said brother Samy he said here's what happened he said from that moment on he said what happened is it developed such a stubbornness and I think his dad went on to be you know Arm Forces and other things like that he said but that right there developed such a stubbornness to where when there was anything to be voluntarily under any Authority he would quickly say nobody is going to tell me what to do that is so good now where did that come from now sometimes these aren't things that are passed out but you see sometimes even in the struggling like this with stubbornness where a person could come might be sweet nice and everything else but let a moment come to where it comes to actually being confronted with wrong and whether or or not they'll come under the authority of it listen our flesh always wants to pull back it it hates the sting of the word the flesh does but when you see something that wants to so turn in the opposite direction listen friends the prophet was not saying we go back and blame granddaddy blame Grandma they should have never done this no no it's recognizing that the god in you has already overcome that thing and to where that you need to have that Authority and that resolution from your heart by faith it stops right here right right it's not but first you got to recognize it but see sometimes the reason these things can build and it gets stronger is because we make excuses that's why it's a stronghold absolutely it builds and builds and before long it's like a whole development almost it it don't just stop you see a complex doesn't just something that works and it's just something that's in my life it'll affect your family but it'll affect your relationship with God this is why the prophet when he had that complex that God brought him to he told us he said I'm not going to go out and preach meetings until this is resolved he said I will stay around home he said I'll preach a little bit here and there he said but I'm in every service if you listen from standing in the Gap all the way through if you listen to it oh there's not a service that he won't bring it up and ask the people to pray for him but one thing he said when he spoke to those graduates before he ever come come home and preach standing in the Gap he spoke to a group of G graduates in Arizona he said oh he said God showed me I was on a road and where I was headed he said but by the grace of God I'm on a different road now amen he didn't go in and tell those graduates about the complex but he goes in he said there's something I want to share with the Tabernacle you see that's what's empowerful how could he be on a different road because he had come under the discernment of the word he had he had been honest before God and in humility for God to be able to work this out in his life I may say Lord help me help me listen friends I I'm not interested in packing around baggage like this I I want I want to walk free amen Lord search me search me search me notice notice brother bam goes on to say stubbornness is not of God and the only way to get away from that is you have to have faith to overcome that that's if you're a Christian you're a son and daughter of God whichever you may be now notice that's that's the qualify to be a son and daughter of God this isn't something where well I'm going to be free of the stubbornness I'm going to go down to Mercy Health or I'm going to go over the Cleveland Clinic where they where they help to you know help to make nicer stubborn people or you know happier Grumps or you know uh uh less uh you know um uh pleasing Grudge holders we're not going to do that hold hands and sing Kumbaya and make chance and chance and chance and remember the prophet said we don't grow the that little button does not grow by bodily exercise of exhortations but it grows by a Sanctified consecrated yielded life to God that is so good I tell you what be great thing we could do is tell the devil don't I don't need no more your excuses right I don't need there you go I don't want them there you this right here is a problem and and what it is it's something in here that's causing things to be diverted in a certain way even sometimes listen friends even sometimes it may not even be stubbornness it can be sometimes the way that even when the word is being preached it can be certain things to where that complexes have been formed and the enemy has so put things in there to where that that individuals are actually struggling with the very thing that God intends for them to be able to receive how could say do that oh he can Mar through experiences he can come through so many Nega negative ways but let me tell you nothing's greater than God but we'll never be free if we blame somebody else we've got to be honest and say Lord I need help right right notice this you'll never be able just to stand there and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it it's like a tantalizing rattlesnake he's laying there ready to bite you that's right but if you will just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you now this is what's key because other places brother Ram will tell us when the doctor's report how can I overcome when the doctor says you got cancer he said you say oh no I don't got cancer brother R said oh no you do got cancer but the god in you has already overcome that so when we look at this if you look how brother ra saying this ignore him in other words I see the stubborn spirit I see what's Rising but I'm not going to give any place to it you go I'm not going to give any place to it you know what that is that's a mature Son of God oh I know friends I know I know we we all all of us want certain things in our life oh God if I can just walk through a prayer line and and stubbornness be taken off of me but listen God intends for that for you to walk with overcoming because there's going to be tendencies that are still there in your life right but this is where you recognize the devil at every one of his tricks brother Samuel what if I fall into a few of his tricks all things work together for the good to them that are called according to his purpose you can say Lord I ain't going to keep going but teach me Lord where was it where was it that I let down was it somewhere that I let down was it in my meditation where was it Lord because I know what you've done for me I know what you've brought me through I've seen your grace working in my life to be able to stand there and look stubbornness in the face and say not today right not today right no more you you know what you were a constant occupancy at the Browning household or whatever your last name was not today as a matter of fact there used to be a seat at the table not today Hallelujah there ain't even a booster chair for you there ain't even no doggy door for you to crawl [Applause] through hallelujah oh my I feel good don't you yes sir don't worry I don't feel good enough to keep keep going but but but watch this watch watch how brother Bram says this and I'm going I'm trying Bo I'm trying to bring this down he says so when you feel that you got a stubborn Spirit when you feel right when you feel cuz that that's the part I could say you got a stubborn Spirit not sister Nell I'm just you his example but it ain't about that right I you got no no when you feel listen friends that's that's part of our maturity of Sons and Daughters of God when we have to be able to look in the word and say that's right Lord that's me but you know what we're seeing we're seeing him what it is God Is Not pointing out all the flaw it's his grace that he's pointing out this is what I called you to be and so when we can look at that beholding the beauty in his Temple we can behold that and look over here and say I'm not measuring up to where this is right here Lord give me Grace lead me right here Lord lead me right here see it's a it's a clear image Look Away to Jesus who's the author and finisher of our faith glory be to God cuz you can't by looking down like the chicken in the barnyard you'll never get anywhere but the call from Mama Eagle is look up look up because you've always been taught to look down but when the eagle come the eagle come and said look up look up look up look up when you feel you got a stubborn Spirit lay the thing on the Altar and believe that that thing is dead and you will never have it no more watch go on and don't even pay attention to it no more and the thing will leave you wo thank you Jesus but that's a battle it yeah but remember the promised land wasn't picnics that's right it's not the Millennium there's Wars battles and just like God took Jericho a certain way AI a certain way and every one of them were taken a certain way what that showed is in every one of our individual portions of our inheritance there's certain ways with things in your walk with God that God has done in your walk right now that if God carries when you're a 30y old man 40y old man if God terries there'll be different battles that will come and God will be guiding you to take them battles in a different way but it'll be the same God God good you know why because he wants you to trust him yes yes he wants to lead you right let the word lead you so it's not always it's not always the same way but the outcome is it's victory don't you love him my my resist the devil and he will flee from you what does resist mean get away quickly get away quickly I don't care you get away quickly you you hear something man I mean you you're ready you run run from it you don't run to where it's at no right I mean you hear some commotion going on or whatever more you don't run to where the commotion are you run away from it right right that's good I got an image in my mind of brother juul forny right now brother juel said he said the white man goes to find out what's making the noise he said the black man runs away from it I didn't think I'd ever recover in that servant but it's a truth it's a truth I'll say it like this God make me more if I say it like that make me more like the black man Lord help me to run Lord I don't want I don't need to find it out I just run run when I hear it [Applause] run now you might call that a Fredy cat that that's called smarts that's right I don't need to figure it out I don't need to know I don't need to figure it out it's told resist the devil and he will flee from you run away quickly W so that would be my advice how to overcome it we overcome the Devil by faith and that's how we overcome all evil is by faith not by feelings but by faith now let me read this to you because this is I'm kind of jumping to the end so you'll probably hear this one again because it's powerful how many remember what the other the other time we were speaking I well I told you look at those words already overcome in the message how can I overcome those two words just look them up already overcome don't parentheses just let them wide open brother Bram in prayer he says Lord Jesus an hour and 15 minutes now standing here trying to take your word and explain to the people how to overcome you told us how it's done you didn't only tell us but you showed us how it was done you led us you showed us how to do it receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold to that word it is written in every temptation but be humble walk hely then we have conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy and the only thing that we have to do is just walk humble with faith believing that and our Badge of identification of the Holy Ghost and Satan has to move you believe that I'm so thankful for his Mercy friends I'm so thankful how God leading us down some of these Pathways and things like that you say brother Samuel is this somewhere in place that you were looking at going no but when all of a sudden I begin to see God open and and speak and begin to deal with these things like this just waiting on him I said oh Lord you know the you know I tell you only thing I can see is Victory that's why when I talk about excitement all I can see is Victory I can see victory in my own life I can see victory in the congregation why because there's things that I believe we come to a place to say Lord I'm tired of going around this same Mountain that's right yes but God give us the grace discernment that we need to be able to recognize these things in this time yes may God help us and Lord give me the let me be honest it's going to it it take that Honesty will it will bring it it's it's a death it's an honesty Lord Thy word is true sanctify me through Thy word Lord father I I got I got a lot more and Lord willing when we come back and been able to go and come into this a little more will you just be in prayer I know you're in prayer every service but say Lord Lord Lord just speak to us because there's so many there's there's there's many needs friends that I I know that if God leads us in channels like this I believe this in every service but I I look at these things oh every one of us and look into our lives and I tell you what I told the Lord here just the other day as I was walking in here praying I said Lord there's things that you have showed me in my life I've preached about complexes before but you've showed me in my life even where I've had them and you know what didn't even realize what was there yeah sometimes it's things that's been from back when I was a child sometimes things that happened in school and you don't even realize and you know what you or I can't un under uncover that that takes the Holy Spirit absolutely I can't do that but Jesus can right and I I want I want to say this as we said before where he leads me I will follow yes put my hand in his hand and he'll lead me oh there might be some places where there's some Giants but his promise made by the Living God that's greater than any giant that's there squatting in your Tabernacle say Lord lead me Lord am amen don't you desire that this morning wherever you might be say Lord lead me Lead Me lead lead me let's just pray could we Heavenly Father Lord I just Lord ask that God that here this morning for your mercies once again Lord you've been so kind and so merciful to us Lord Lord we We Trust You Lord you you know just Lord what what to say what to minister and what to bring in our lives Lord my my heart and the Heart of these people were open before you Lord I pray that Lord Jesus your desire and what moves in our hearts as we want to see more of you Lord less of our own selves sometimes Lord we stubbornness Lord just just that one part that we looked at that it's caused by a [Music] complex Lord I thought about what that brother shared with me and like he told me he said brother samel if it had not been for the grace of God he said where would I have been he said even when I tried to witness of the truth to my father he said what makes it so difficult is because of that right there in his life that he is not going to have anybody tell him what to do he'll have bosses and other things but Lord the word itself your word we hear it Lord see it in the scripture it's Commandments of the Lord things that are precepts that are given but father your heart's desire is all that would be done would be done from our hearts Lord the whole expression of your love was the winning and wooing of our hearts Lord in Divine love you don't want us to serve you out of fear oh there's a reverence but the fear of the Lord is clean it's it's not tormenting father many things events situations can happen in our lives no doubt Lord's sitting right here this morning maybe there's things that has been brought to light maybe Lord should you carry in upcoming Services maybe there'll be things Lord that it won't even be me as the vessel that would be standing here but Lord maybe some of the the brothers that are coming in here in February that father you know Lord I I don't discuss with anybody that's coming in here to minister I don't even discuss if they get on the website that's one thing but I don't I don't discuss what I've been preaching not what even what I've been [Music] studying I got confidence in them Lord they wouldn't they wouldn't try to fit into that but I I've Got Confidence that you know what our needs are right here and I'm here to tell I'm I'm just here to Clare it Lord we need the five full ministry we need every a we need every gift that Lord that you have for us Lord and as your bride like the prophet described it like that engagement ring that has that diamond set in it he described that as that bride that would receive the gifts that he has sent not only Lord God of the five ministerial the nine spiritual she receives it all because it's from him she's not more taken with the engagement ring but it means something because it means she's entrusted to him his word has sought her out and she has submitted her life to him oh God may you Lord just come in such a way as you have been we want to say thank you for it through the services like we had this past weekend with brother Trevor how wonderful Lord you came in such a wonderful way and spoke to our hearts Lord you know it's you're putting it all together it's not brother Samuel's program it's not somebody else's program Lord we're just interested in your program because that's the program that works it doesn't need an update it don't need an improvement it's just as effectual Lord that program of the Holy Spirit taking the word moving down in our lives Lord hands throughout this building my hand as well Lord search me Father search me Lord if there's things Lord undoubtedly like the prophet could ask that whole congregation at brandham Tabernacle and Lord Jesus they would raise their hands and he would tell us over and over it's so easy to build a complex Lord as Sons and Daughters of God we have authority to sign the order for material that's being delivered or to refuse it Lord [Music] Jesus through your strength Lord give us strength Lord because many times our flesh our spirit Lord God would want to be so receptive of materials sometimes Lord through pain and experiences things can begin to set up Lord in our lives but Lord you're here to manifest your Victory through our lives Lord God may you help us right now this morning Lord as our hands are raised our hearts are up Lord by by faith we're going to take that Lord and if it's stubbornness indifference whatever it might be maybe it's selfishness maybe there's certain things that Lord have been prone that we can see in our life certain Tendencies but God I pray may we lord Jesus look to you right now this morning standing there Lord God in your presence like the prophet when there closing in the message indictment he would say Lord I see my errors this morning Lord ring out my heart while I'm standing before your throne Lord oh granted Lord I pray Lord help [Music] us you can do what none other Can Do Lord there's not a psychiatrist or psychologist that can do for us what you can do I'm not saying Lord that times that they may not have good things that they could tap into but when we stand upon the scripture we realize it's going to take the renewing of the Holy Spirit sometimes Lord there's truths but father we need the enforcer of the truth the Holy Spirit dear God of renewing Lord would you just move down I pray Lord through each one of our lives and our hearts Lord help us Lord help us father we want to be more like you Lord in this time of renewal Lord that you would call help us father granted Lord may we recognize the safety of your presence recognize Lord this is a place that we can disclose and open our hearts and invite the king of glory the mighty conqueror to move in granted this morning Lord may you move through every Avenue if there's one heart that doesn't know you Lord and in that way in their life where there's a faith on the inside to be able to stand with to where that Lord in their life they've got a confidence I pray that Lord
