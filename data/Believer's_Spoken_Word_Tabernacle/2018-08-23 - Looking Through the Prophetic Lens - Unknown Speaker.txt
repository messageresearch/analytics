you might be glorified in all things father we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you're loving a man it's good to be a Christian in it amen let's turn to psalms 32 it's almost 32 and we'll just read the verses one through verse 11 there I'll let you have your seats blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and whose spirit there is no guile when I kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer sale on I acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin Sayla he stopped the roaring are you with me he stopped the roaring by confession for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayst be found aren't you glad you found him he said well now wait a minute both Sam you it was him that found us that's true it's the manifestation of his word that is becomes the lighthouse and it's him finding you aren't you glad aren't you glad there is that place made known to us we didn't find him in a church we found him in his word amen surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come 9 to him thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance sail this is where I want to draw from even in the latter part here I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I be you not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall compass him about in that wonderful be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart a man you love the Lord tonight amen god bless you as you're being seated bless the reading of the word I want to speak to you tonight I know we've been dealing with that thought on the high ground and I just there's a lot of things that I have drawn from some of that but here a few weeks ago it just seemed that the Holy Spirit I was setting there meditating and for me I you know I meditate a lot and something even when I worked and things like that and I I found that that would be a very very very precious thing to meditate on the things of God and and sometimes you know you you you don't even know that the thought you just give yourself to the Word of God and got to begin to speak to you his presence will drop down a matter of fact as I told one of my boys we were talking the other day I said every message I said that I've ever received of God that I've spoke to his people has come through meditation and prayer every message I've I've never got a message where I just sat down on a computer and I just studied studying study no I just many times they'll take take a notepad sometimes I'll just take things and I'm just praying and write in prayer and things will drop and and I know that's no different from really from any other minister I know that and I don't say it for that but sometimes God will press things on our hearts and I really feel in my heart to bring these things to us as an assembly and for us to begin to look into these things we'll just we'll see where we get tonight I'm not going to even try to get to a certain spot we'll just see where he wants us to get to it so we'll just we'll just approach it like that that'll be safe for you but I want to speak on the father at least begin to looking through the prophetic lens looking through the prophetic lens you know it's a it's a great thing to be able to see I think of minute you know I think of when my eyesight started changing myself I was must have been maybe in sixth grade you know and sometimes I had the privilege of sitting towards the front of the class not by choice but I was able to see what was on the board but I remember - I remember of when I was in seventh grade I remember at the time you know starting to squint and I had a buddy by me he would you know I had a teacher that just filled the notes that the talk board every every chalkboard even on the side with notes you know and and and I remember I was set in there and I was about 3/4 of the way back in the room and I was just squinting my eyes I didn't have glasses at the time I didn't know what was going on and you know it went on my seventh grade year and of course I never you know I never mention anything to my mom and dad cuz I didn't know anything was wrong and you know then it got in my eighth grade year when we had moved up here to Sandusky and I remember sitting there in the classroom and and you know I must have said something then to my to my mom and dad about something and then right then they took me back down to where we live drove about three and a half hours because they they had confidence and that eye doctor there we didn't have things established here and I remember you know I didn't want to wear glasses I just wanted to be cool so I don't want to be you know identified four eyes and all these things you know and you know I you know you're at fourth your eighth grade you know ever thing is you know you got the world under control and and I remember going there and I think was dr. tan German is his name and he put different contact lens in my eyes and what I remember is is when I when he put those soft lens in my eyes and I remember looking and I thought my goodness I'm able to read that line down there and and then I remembered when I walked out it's like the whole world itself looked new to me I mean it was something on the way home now mind you this three and a half hour trip we had made this trip for almost seven years and I knew many of the points along the way and Faust story and all the different routes you could take you know to kind of break up the monotony but I remember that day oh it was it was different than those other times because for that time I could see things and I could see it even before we were getting to it I wasn't by color either it was where I can actually see the writing and I could see those things that made it that made a world of difference I felt like I was living in a different world and it was all because that my eyes I had a lens that I could look through that really brought things real to me and I realized what I've been missing you know I never had to ask that neighbor in the class again can I borrow your notebook I never had to do that again I mean I was able to take the notes myself I never had to borrow that again and that's I believe with all my heart that that's God's desire for every one of us that it's not just something where you have to take somebody's word for it but I believe that when you look at that word to have faith in that word and to know that God is real and to know that there is another dimension that's moving right here among us right here tonight to where that you're actually would be able to see things in the way that God would have you to see them and to be able to recognize who you are where we are and where we're going the scriptures are clear that we walk not by sight we walk by faith so we wreck now that faith itself is is that revelation of God so we recognize that revelation itself is not darkness but revelation is lie and if light has come then it is something to be able to show a pathway of how we ought to go and I begin to think of this thought you know there in in verse 8 where it says I will instruct thee and teach the in the way which thou shalt go aren't you glad that the Lord instructs us and teaches us aren't you glad that he just doesn't bring us into the kingdom of God and then he turns us loose and says figure out your own way but he's a faithful father he works with us the relationship grows he teaches us and he instructs us and the whole thing is it's what already is sown and lays within us he already knows the full potential in our life and he's the one that we want to hear because he knows what is there and he's the one that can bring it forth and this is his promise I will guide thee with mine I God doesn't want us as it goes on to say in that verse that we would be as the horse or the mule now many times you'll find in the scripture that a horse itself would you know there is some times where God will use a horse and a comparison in the times of where it would be thoroughbred but yet here in this verse God is letting it be known that I want to be able to lead you by mine I it's not something to where I gotta put a bit in your mouth and to put you know the bridle on has that you don't know where you're going but I want you to know who's leading you who's guiding you and I want you to have that understanding that you are able to look and see beyond just this realm that's right here you're able to walk with a real understanding now you and I both know there's times when you know you can be looking at something whether you're in school your training or whatever more and you can look at it you can almost beat your brains out looking at it but all of a sudden once something drops and you begin to see it you can say or they call a light ball moment or uh-oh moment or aha it's when things that you've been hearing all of a sudden it comes together and it makes sense you've got an understanding and that's exactly what God intends to do that's exactly when God would pour out of his spirit and begin to reveal himself in his word in a generation it's that you and I might walk with an understanding that we understand the time we understand where we're living we're not just church members but we are members of the body of Jesus Christ there is an understanding of who he is an understanding of who we are an understanding of what He desires and once out of our life and I believe what we can agree together tonight I believe you can agree with me God wants more than just the sanctified life God wants a life that's filled up God wants a life that walks in complete obedience to his word and I thank God for every life that'll live above all unclean things of the world but let me tell you something there's much more to Christianity than just living a life that is above and unclean out there there is a life that is put in motion and an action by the Holy Spirit that becomes the very word Express in this hour in this day I look at this thought here how will God be with mine I you know brother branham he preaches a message called God's eye I'm brother Graham he deals with it in there he says you know he said I'm glad that how God placed sit here in his word that we do have a hiding place and here that hiding place is God's great presence we can hide from the things of the world and it's to know that his presence is here and it's ever to guide us and I want you to to think of it we even with the example that I gave you with myself being able to see you know the great high of Jehovah brother Brandon would put it like this he said Jesus looked through his eyes he says a matter of fact he said when Simon came up to him and he remember what Simon who we know called Peter he came up to him he began to reveal to him who his daddy was he identified his name and he identified of what he was to be called Barrett that there's no way that a man could just look at this but it's the eye of God and the Lord Jesus was looking through that eye you know when God became man God was identifying that this eye is pressing upon the earth he he was opening a channel in a realm of which the prophets had tapped into but he was opening this channel that it's not just something that you can tap into once in a while he was there was gonna be a channel will repeat of God a channel that would be open between God and man as a matter of fact when Jacob was there at Bethel he saw a ladder of God and the ladder it was coming from heaven it sat down upon the earth it was a channel and access way that would be opened up that the angels of God were ascending and descending there would be a channel that would be open up were all the veils that had blocked off they had separated the chasm but he himself who stood in the breach and the gap for you and I he sent back the Holy Ghost that you and I might have that ministry in our hearts that removes the chasm and we stand back in the presence of God as sons and daughters of God this channel is opened up and brother Graham goes long to say like this I think it's worthy for us to look at this he talks about how God's eyes have God's eye has been with the prophets through the ages the only way that Noah was able to see the flood that was coming upon the earth would because of the eye of God he saw judgment that was coming but remember before judgment can strike grace is given it was the eye of God whereby that even God would come and minister to Abraham to where Abraham would be able to see what God wanted him to see and it was that same eye of God that abided there to where Sarah herself could actually come to a place as recorded in Hebrews that she would judge him faithful who made the promise it was that same eye of God that day walking in obedience to the word were privileged to live and walk and be guided by that eye and look through that eyelid let me just say like this the fashions of Sodom were very real there were things that were vexing and things that were moving through but you see there was an eye of God that had opened where Abraham stayed separated now fair in the plains and let me tell you something the Prophet said and you can read it in the scripture it wasn't that he had everything easy it wasn't that it was always lush and everything just going on around but sometimes God will let areas that even he's promised to you it might seem dry but let me tell you something you would be better to stay but God has called you to be in his word then they go chasing after anything that's lush it's to stay in God's provided way because God rewards those who stay faithful to him and to his word that's the truth the eye of God the eye of God you see it was down through the prophets it was Moses who looked through that I have God now we could run this the rest of the night hallelujah they were looking through the eye of God his eyes you looked through the eye of God you see these men were not looking for natural eyes whoa thank you Jesus the haze' was standing there one time and Gaza was looking the servant there of Elijah he was looking through these eyes he looked out and he saw the hillsides they were with the Syrian army but Elijah who was looking through the eyes of God he knew what it was that this man needed this man didn't need semen he did me condemn and he needed his eyes open then Elijah stood there with the word in his heart he prayed a prayer of intercession and God moved on the scene and he heard that prayer what was that that was Christ in Elijah's heart that desire to give sight to gazer it's God's desire to stabilize your life it's God's desire to give you sight yes sir and he opened up and he said they're more with us than there are against us it all depends on what you're looking at you see as the Prophet told us God didn't bring the Angels down he said the angels were always there and he said so is it the God that we see here is the God that has always been we said what happened he changed the seeing of his servant Oh aren't you glad for a prophetic lens you understand what I'm talking about it prophetically as I'm talking about the eye of God yes sir when the fan you remember Nathanael was under the tree or Nathaniel's you know here he was Philip went to Guinea when he came in the presence of the Lord Jesus here the Lord Jesus said well you know behold an Israelite in whom there's no guy he said Winston you know me he said I saw you before Philip called you I saw you under that tree let me just stop here for a minute and heavens you believe the Prophet said it like this how many times in the paralyzed and I don't leave those things just for prayer lines but I believe this means something to our hearts as believers when it comes to the promises god to the rapture the Prophet could say to that person he said now surely he said the God if he could tell me something about your past he said surely then that same God that would know something about your past would know your future there's only one who can know standing in the present and know the past and the future and that is he which was which is and which is to come none other than the Lord Jesus Christ here he is standing there and he's discerning the past and he lets it be known the future you see the reality it's recognizing the press and God who's able to discern what was and what is because when you can recognize that he already knows your number he already knows all about you you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you come from God and you're going back to God hey man what is that that is the eye of God service after service the discernment of the word comes forth to remind us of these things to call hearts to warm our hearts hallelujah that same eye of God was there in John 4 it was a woman he was bound Oh mom you know she had had many but that day in his presence he looked through the eye of God and he was able to see her trouble aren't you glad that God don't do patch up jobs I mean I thank God that they fill holes out here but I hate patches because they're all going to be broke up be careful of the first snowfall freeze and fall be careful you know what I mean now I know it may not be bad so bad here as it is in some other countries where you almost have to have a bulldozer to get out of those roads and things but it gets pretty bad right I mean I know so I've seen some clips about Cleveland and things like that so for those who are in Cleveland be careful but but I have gone there there was a virtue that when I remember the woman who had touched him and said if I can be touched the hem of his garment there is no way that the Lord Jesus felt that touch in a multitude of people who were pulling on him but she it was her faith that touched him there was a channel that was open right there and he responded right back and he ministered right to her need and what she had need of was released right to her through the eye of God it was also him that perceived the thoughts of the Pharisees they were sent in their doubters and everything else come on somebody it's the same eye of God when the Prophet could stand in the platform and say I hear some of you saying Amen but I hear something beneath that that says this ain't nothing but scepticism come on somebody you see it's discernment it's the eye of God it's not coming against the people but it's trying to get them to realize your thoughts on they speak louder in heaven then your words do on earth is that right this is why the Prophet would give me admonition in the seals he said get them lined up you know that's the promise of God's Word Psalms 19 that the meditation of my heart and the words of my mouth would be acceptable in thy sight O God until your God is able to reconcile all those things together God's not God's not interested and you'd being a pretender and I'm going to tell you tonight you don't have to be a pretender you don't have to pretend about any promise these promises belong to you as believers you can just scratch down imagination catch the side reason it ain't about whether you're worthy or not he already provided the way and the eye of God has already said you are worthy I've already paid the price for you there's a divine channel that's open that God Himself speaks to his people through the eye of God to come to the Pool of Bethesda hallelujah the house of the seven seats of mercy he comes to the pool of and here is a man who has been bound in the condition for all these years and here they hai of God directs him you know brother Bram calls this godly compassion because human compassion would have healed everybody in there but you see what you see what's being taught to us these are not just phrases what's being taught to us is the power and authority that comes from the revealed word in our life to harness even our human compassion they have faith within that because our compassion we want to give everyone to give everything to everybody we want to heal everybody we want to see everybody but God is interested he knows who's going to believe his signs who's going to believe his wonders God knows exactly and he's there guiding us in that place by his eye because the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God he saw this man now this man you know he meant his need maybe wasn't as great as somebody else's need but it still was big your needing money sometimes we've had small needs maybe compared to other things but to us it's a big need but when you've got a need I don't care what anybody else thinks it's a big need but you got a big God and a big God made a great big promise that a big God will cut right behind and fulfills that word woo glory this guiding I you know when he came he made no bull Ram tells us that this guiding I was not going to be gone at the going of the Lord Jesus but he was going to send it back to the church is that right John 14 John 15 John 16 he said even when when the Spirit of Truth when he has come he will lead and guide you into all truth she's showing there are things that still the Spirit of Truth is prophetic the Spirit of Truth is not a past it is prophetic it is that which is able and it opens to us a channel of which we would never be able to see outside of him he's sitting back the Holy Ghost so hold brother BAM said I like this back then he sent the Holy Spirit back to the church tonight looks through that same guiding eye that guides his people to all true all of this statement I got to read this he said that same ah that's here tonight will guide us from sickness unto health that shall guide us from our afflictions to the cross that will guide us from affliction to good health that will guide us from a sinful life to a sainted sainted set aside life and God that same eye of God it's here tonight to guide you to whatever you've got a desire for you said I've got to design my heart for healing let me tell you something before you could ever have that desire there already had to be healing there already had to be that there in order for you to desire it but now you're aware that your desire is a promise that has been made with you in mind and all that you have to do is surrender yourself to God if you're sitting here tonight with the sinful eyes the eye of God is here to guide you from a sinful life a life of doubt and unbelief to a life that as a set of side Saint baptized with the Holy Ghost that same eye of God is here tonight whatever the need is that I have God is here tonight hallelujah I want you to listen these statements a prophet makes here he goes on he makes this statement he says lo Jesus said though I'm with you always even to the end and he said we're nearing the end then as Jesus confirmed that guiding I being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the Jews before the ending of that church age for the Jews or that dispensation this was confirmed in his ministry here the eye of God at the closing of the Jewish Church ages come on the Jewish dispensation right he turned from the Jews to the Gentiles is that right but the I've got what was claimed remember I do nothing but what I see the father doing when he said I my father of one he said you seek honor of men he said that I received the honor that coming from My Father he was declaring the eye of God was present and it was being confirmed because whether they could receive the words the works identified that the word was true you're right you know look what he says here he manifested it by looking through the eye of God and he's the same God tonight he still looks through the same AHA because Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he still looks through the hive God as he can with his grace and sanctifying power cleanse us and calls us to be sons and daughters to use us as vines or branches in the vine to still look through the out dog to see what has been and what will be and we will not walk in darkness as long as we look through God's eye yes I will always reflect his spirit here to reflect his word you see that's the only thing that like here tonight you see it's one thing to believe in Calvary and I believe you need to but the hope the whole essence of the ministering of the word is that God would be able to move aside ordained channels that would point you to Calvary to a finished work it points you you see what does that is the eye of God if it was not the eye of God you are not you would not even be stirred in faith but the eye of God coming upon that word it begins to deal with your heart it opens a channel to where you can even begin to think how possibly it's me and it begins to move a little deeper in the service I believe he's talking to me he keeps moving a little deeper I believe it is me he keeps doing what is that it's a channel that's becoming open the eye of God to when you're no longer looking at print you are actually by faith looking in and seeing what God's desire is for you and that desire he has for you is a desire that you have within your heart and your longing to see fulfilled it's all him Alleluia now this is where I wanna I want to dive in a little bit more on this here that he will guide us with his eye and that's a prophetic how that God would make himself known to you and I in the samoan church age brother brems says it like this and I was talking about how that God would set forth every agent talking about every Gentile age because when God when God dealing with the Gentiles notice from the Ministry of the Son of Man one of the things that changes a transition that's made is that in the Ministry of the Son of Man here now the true atonement has come on display and and there's a Ministry of the gospel going forth and God will reveal himself to a messenger or as we look in the Book of Revelations one of the stars in the right hands of God it also one of the seven lamps and revelations five before the throne of God one of the seven spirits it's the same Holy Ghost but but notice this this is where the dividing line comes that God will speak relative to one man in every age as the messenger of that age he's given the authority of the word where the spirit confirms behind it and it has that of a similar tool like that when God would visit that in the Old Testament he would visit Noah he would visit Moses he would visit them but under them we each time remember the Old Testament and the Old Testament prophets there was not ministries that came out under those Old Testament prophets are you with me but now here in the dispensation where the revealing of the son of man notice what comes forth even at his resurrection when he speaks there in matthew 16 he lets him know go you into all the world and preach this gospel is that right and Paul begins by inspiration now to go into there and here you find where Paul setting the church in order Paul begins to bring forth those things that were were there and to be able to declare that ministry and to preach the gospel what I what I'm dealing with here's those five ministerial gifts are you with me you don't find that in the Old Testament but here you find it in the New Testament and it's something that is pressing it's a characteristic to think of how after the revealing of the Son of Man in that day that God would have a min of God that he appointed just like he appointed the messengers and let me just say it like this before you get to putting things too heavy on everybody else you gotta recognize that just as God has a god ordained an appointed messenger for the Aged and God has ministry that will come under that God's got a people that's ordained to hear it and receive it cuz it's all God it's God's way it's God working in humility and here the Prophet now he takes this pattern you know patterns are wonderful things they allow you to predict things you know in every age but I've said like this in every age we have exactly the same pattern where the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the Ministry of others who have been faithfully taught now notice this is what he said that that light comes through that god-given minister but then the ministry of others that like is - he is to travel is to travel and spread through let me just say it like this when read these things like this and know them I don't have to read them I can quote this to you but when I look at this right here I don't look at this as an elevation of person I look at this as a responsibility amen the eye of God is here a prophetic lens that we and I would be able to look through and that we come into our inheritance because in many of the cases remember the messenger even when you look at the time of Paul Paul himself was not even living in that first age but yet he was the messenger to it because it was the message that he had proclaimed and it was that message remember that influenced that age to Christ is that right so how did you identify Paul as the messenger it's one who influenced the age to Christ oh ma you see that this is this takes discernment it's recognizing what is influencing to Christ if there's something that's not influencing to Christ get away from it it has got to be influencing to cry this is why the Prophet would preach listen friends under inspiration this is not the boss of a man but he would labor under the message of influence influence of one another it was dealing with remember Isaiah was a man that was called and anointed by God but as long as Isaiah held to the skirt tails of Uzziah God could never use him because he never seen the need of the day but when he got in the temple that day things changed the Prophet said when he came into the temple that day things were different he saw the presence of God he saw the Train of God and brother brems said when Isaiah saw that he recognized the need of the day and when he caught the need of the day he recognized he was not fit to fulfill the need of the day where did he recognize this in God's presence where did Moses recognizing in God's presence when a man it's in God's presence he will recognize his insufficiency I believe us husbands I believe as daddies I believe as mamas I believe as pastors I believe as deacons I believe as trustees I believe that each and every one now batting in the presence of God that we can recognize our littleness and the greatness of the need that we have in him but the Prophet said you dip your zinc your something dip your finger in a bucket and pull it out and try to find the hole you put your finger in you can't our lives ought to be influenced by God himself you know the Bible said provoke one another under love and good works I believe that's what the preaching of the word does as well sometimes they may have to tan our hide that is provoking us unto love and good works you know what I'm saying the preaching of the gospel in about powdered sugar fly and there's some times where God has to get right down and correct us he has to show us where our shortcomings are let me tell you something it is time like Peter said that judgment must begin at the house of Almighty God I don't know about you my flesh might squirm in might shake but there is something within me I want to see more of God I want to see more of God I want to see more of him and I realize it's nobody else's problem it's right here if I can get this guy out of the way those that's been faithfully taught I'm just gonna be honest with you you know I think to my daddy so it was before he ever left I think ten many times I think too many times when he would send her and look right at me with things and it might have been things I ministered and I didn't see all the light on it and he would look right at me and he would he never he never blasted me but he would tell me you need to study more on this you need to read this right here you need to do this let me tell you something hi I think you all might have had it easier than me but there's things that he's taught me even before I started ministry he taught me on what blaze and approaches of how that you even study the word and you look at and I know it's a gift in my life let me tell you something those were not words that were coming from a man called James Browning that was wisdom that had been learned I never forget him telling me he said don't you ever leave the boy don't you ever leave the people hanging in judgment you always bring it around to grace don't you ever do that he said don't you ever to happen let that happen in my pulpit who I think I gotta I think all them spankings I didn't get with leather I got but you see even even with him I hated that Oh sometimes boy it scorched me oh my you not get quiet in the car I'd Pat like some of you I'd get quiet man I got my feelings hurt you know but I realized I needed that training I didn't know what for but I needed that training I'm glad that somebody took time to teach me but you know friends it didn't stop and end with James browning it had to be the same holy girls that revealed it to the Prophet that would reveal it to my heart do you realize we're not preaching things up here by just finding quotes and scriptures it is under the direct inspiration of Almighty God the eye of God open [Applause] faithfully taught and this is just my principle if I don't understand something and I don't see it now understand this there's things that win God it would move upon my heart sometimes I can look at it and say Lord I don't see how you're moving me but I'll be honest with you I really don't understand that right now I need your help but you know what even anytime that God is moving us into something you know he's gonna be right there to open the way God has a sense of humor you know that don't you there's some times that God only gives you a little bit of a phrase to preach from I can get up now you know I'm not just talking like going out other places I'm almost standing right here it was things on Sunday it was just burning out of a free sewing for the supernatural we sent you a little bit of notes of what we could but you know the reality is just what God was evil just flowing out from the throne of God and what I'm trying to say is is that being faithfully taught is being taught by the same Holy Ghost it's not just being able to set at the feet of some individual I'm telling you I think God you know God knows when to let your past cross around some of the other brethren and things like the head and and I thank God that my path even in the past few years for different ones it's crossed and there's certainly inside that they've been able to make known to me about things you know in certain parts and it's been so beneficial to have that understanding and to see that but you know it still it takes the Holy Ghost this statement right here and I've got to start trying to come down get my parachute on here this is an important statement here bloob em says but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken now just as he's bringing this to me let me work this phrase a little bit here you see this is aware of how this is my approach when I I look at the word there are things when I go to studying in the scripture and you know now I I told you this I think the other day or order form or there's things when I are reading in the scripture my goodness I say I love my Bible more and more every day and you know when you're reading it there's things I can hear but the brem saying and there's things that the Holy Spirit is connecting it's not by my memory it's like a great picture that's unfolding and I'm standing there and saying oh my dear Jesus thank you Lord and you know it just keeps on unfolding it and things that are being brought together in it and it's him that's doing it it and you look at it like this there are things that I'll say it like this when I look at things within the scripture and in the word you know I recognize the gift that God has sent in this generation it is a prophetic gift and I'm gonna say it like this I know there's things where brother them said it this is my opinion on things but I want you to understand I will give you I will give space and place to his opinion I will look at all those things because what he is seeing there has to be a channel that's open up for him to even see things that he's seen and make statements I don't discount things sorry never have done that I don't do that as a matter of fact when there are things let me just say it like this when there are things that you might look at in the scripture and you can say well I see this in the scripture I see this in the scripture I want to know what didn't Malachi 4 say concerning that I want to know what he said because God did not make you to be an instructor God made you simply to be in submission to that word in this hour you may not see it in the scripture but if you'll just wait on the Lord he shall renew thy strength if you'll just wait on him there is a channel that the Prophet is calling from I could say that even in years pass but I know that to be the truth right now even there's things that can be said here right now that I may not go through the whole thing I may not go through the whole scripture where this is from but where it's at in the message but when you are read within the message not that you remember every single thing but when you are read meaning you are acquainted and becoming more and more acquainted with the person of Christ who is revealed in this word then you will recognize him to recognize and speak only what the messenger has spoken that's important it's important because if not the church gets in a lot of trouble yes sir it's to stay with that it's not listen let me tell you some friends even though people on in this hour there's one part I think the info base is a good thing but I think at the same time heaven they infobase some things like a it's made people that don't even have a gift in their life they've study themselves right in holes and knots and everything else you know why it's not called to divide to write the Word of God they're not called to that that is not even something in my flesh that is given by God Joshua could not do it when he wanted to do it he was just an instrument of which when the inspiration struck it came forth so this doesn't remember a gift is not prying into things there's a lot of things I hate to say it there's a lot of stuff that I've seen it's trash on the internet and hadn't been stuff that slammed brother Brandon I'm not talking about that you know that stuff's garbage you shouldn't even be around that kind of trash because what kind of faith is that going to build in your life come on friends ain't none of them in their life got any vindication come on now no vindication in their lives but Almighty God the angel the Lord never came down once in their life and said a man to their life look where they're leading people straight to hell what is it death and ancora that has rose up and the Bible says stay away from the tents of those wicked men I don't care how good they are I don't care if they're sweet as honey if they stand against God's Word in this hour but reveal truth and His Messenger they are no fit to associate with the truth it's God's Word remaining faithful to his word but I've seen a lot of other things where men have posted stuff that they had no business posting brother Samuel why don't you write him and tell him to take it down why to argue I'm not what I refuse to waste my time and argue with anybody I refuse that if a person wants to argue over something we're not arguing we are not debating we're standing on the word I don't have time for that nonsense there is a rapture there are people of God sheep of God who deserve the Ministry of the Holy Spirit that they might grow I refuse to do it it's important to say only what the messenger has spoken I know there's a balance to this and I need to balance this as I close you see there's lives and heart there's people to say well you know brother Bram didn't preach out of this chapter so you shouldn't preach out of that chapter you didn't preach out at the brother Ram didn't preach out of this chapter you shouldn't preach out of this chapter see what's being miss missed by what he said right here what's being messed missed is the unfolding of the character of Christ do you realize the whole trail of the serpent was exposed this is the full book of redemption the Bible the Bible he didn't say certain chapters he didn't say certain scriptures he said the Bible has become a brand-new book to us who is it that could open these things that things that the Prophet himself would have said back there I'll tell you he wasn't out of a man it was God that spoke right through that kentucky voice hello hey man it gives understanding to our lives we're not forces we're not mules that are led about with no understanding but the eye of God is present in this hour that we might know because the Bible is clear we're living in the hour what Daniels prophecy that was revealed to him as unfolding and he said they that know their God shall do great exploits [Applause] that word exploits means acts of heroism mama this is good and there's more brother Branham referred because when you look at I speak only what the messenger spoke I want you to think this I'm not gonna get to that tonight so we'll just I'll just pop that off I'm still gonna cover it but let's just look at this and Joshua chapter 1 remember what God advised Joshua he told him be careful and mindful to observe all the law to do according to all that Moses okay is that right he admonished him him that right there so within this here comes Joshua as as he stepping forward and remember now Joshua is aware that the angel of the Lord is in the camp he's aware of that he's aware that the angel of the Lord did not go when Moses the servant of the Lord win because remember it was God who said I will send mine angel before thee to keep the in the way all right to guide the and bring the in through the place that I have prepared for thee so he was aware that the angel of the Lord is still in the camp come on somebody so here Joshua goes out and he goes out and he begins to meditate and Joshua is out here now as it comes around for Jericho there is a battle plan that has unfolded for Jericho now listen to me now you're not going to find that word for word within that of the law of Moses you're not there's nowhere if Joshua came back to the camp and they said Joshua you tell us right now where did Moses say this about Jericho where did Moses say go around seven times where did Moses say not the walls would fall so you see there's a right way to apply this statement what it was God told Joshua be fairly acquainted with my personal be thoroughly acquainted with me because you're gonna have needs you're gonna need to be led you're gonna need to be God and this word will make you know of the characteristic and the image as it continues to unfold you will see my guide you for your life so when he went back for the battle-plan of Jericho he was staying with the law of Moses he was saying what Moses said because you know know why Moses has said under authority by God I will bring you out of a land and I will bring you unto a land and I will drive them out why didn't God spell it out sometimes he wants you to get to where you need to get and then he'll open up and let you know what he wants you to do when you get there listening looking through the prophetic lens I just I just feel pressed in my heart when these things to begin to bring those things to you and looking into these things that belong to us our promises looking through that prophetic eye I believe it's very important that we're staying right in step with the word now staying in step with the word the prophets very clear he said that'll mean getting ahead of it he said you let the word be ahead of you and then you follow behind it always put the word first David said I have put the Lord always before me put it always before him and he'll lead you to the place that he has is that right that's a promise it meant these are your promises whatever that you have need of tonight the eye of God has been speaking to our hearts he did this right here as him taking a servant and moving him out of the side and to speak to our hearts upon these things that you and I can see I can move from here to here how do I get from here to here that I've God guides you well how do I get from here to here it's not a jump it's not a job it's a walk and before you can make that first step here in your heart you surrender there's a step then it deals with your heart surrender is a step that is a step then it's a step you know what he's doing he's guiding you because every step you make when you make it by faith let me tell you something he maketh your feet like Hinds feet yes sir so they're dug in not sliding back but they're going forward aren't you glad I tell you when I look at someone I look at many many things you know when I'm talking with my boys family you knows things that by the grace of God when I'm looking at things and we're talking going through things I point out things I look we look at things in the scriptures because there's things that pertain to their life and where they're at right now maybe something they have on their heart and they were there talking about it and I can by this by the grace of God we can go and look at this and say now this situation see this here unfolded in the word right here this is to minister to you on this situation and the Prophet said this here regarding this remember brother Branham said this year you see where all these things is bringing it together it's the authority of the word you understand it's bringing the authority of the word now you can look at that and say what bill sent me that's because you've got a gift in your life I told you this weeks ago I believe that every daddy I believe that momma's you know how the Lord took us here on Sunday it was mothers that were sowing seeds it was fathers that was sowing seeds and I believe with all of my heart he said that he would bring all things to our remembrance when we had need of it now you mean to tell me that that son of my woman you know I can't get away from that story I can't get away from that that black sister in Memphis I cannot get away from it a matter of fact I was praying about it today and had a spill she she just didn't read the Bible like a newspaper brother her she read it and she said this is me and there was a need that arose when her son there were you know what that was there had to be something she could recall this is what I'm trying to tell you there's got to be something that's set forth it's not an earthly knowledge but how can they know if it's not being taught they say how can you know the promises that belong to you if they're not being taught is that right how can you know what to pray for faith for it in just things that dropped out of osmosis in the Bible that be read on Sunday how can they hear except the preacher go so the promises have got to be made known through the people of God and if she stood that day well my momma she said Lord she said eyes that Shunammite woman she recognized the need in her home she saw it in Scripture hallelujah Gloria this one felt bored in Sunday school this was word flesh ha ha Gloria she said eyes that shooting of my woman where's your Elijah allelujah she didn't know one thing about brother Ronald she didn't know anything about him all she knew is that she was standing there and there was a need and she found her need and found it there in the promise and she said where is your Elisha you can find yourself in the word tonight and you can ask God who made the promise to say Lord I'm not one in need tonight Lord come to my address Jesus I'll open the door let's go inside Lord hallelujah he loved him tonight grow to be the God my feels so good I'm glad let me tell you something I didn't say nothing to him back there tonight he came back here to pray with me as they always do he started praying in there I don't want you remember when you were praying he began to talk about he said Lord I just finished today listening to a message the eye of God God's eye and he began talking about it in prayer I didn't say nothing I just took that and said [Applause] how tell me God's church is not in tune oh yes it's in tune that's a means of the Lord say a means of the Lord hallelujah glory to God amen blessed be his name hallelujah you got a song a song of deliverance he shall compass me about with songs of deliverance glory be to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen as you're thinking of a song let's just bow our heads in prayer here you got a need upon your heart why don't you just make your hand known to the Lord say Lord you know my heart now as you lift that hand believe believe what we spoke to your heart tonight and it may not have been exact word by word but your heart may be he was made to tremble then listen that wasn't to scare you that that's that's his presence to let you know that he's near and that he wants to minister to your knee he's got it in mind already so right now while your heart while you that hand is up right behind it we're gonna go to God in prayer Heavenly Father you see father the needs right now Lord God as you come and you directed Lord for this service tonight Lord
