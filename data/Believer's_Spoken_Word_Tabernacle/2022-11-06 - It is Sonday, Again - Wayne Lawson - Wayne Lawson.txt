just want to pull on the gift of God brother Wayne is is not a stranger to us God has used his ministry around the world to bless the bride and you know what makes it such a blessing is is when a man is surrendered to God and can step out of the way because the ministry is not about the man and the people it's about God speaking to us and God moves a man for our needs and so we're just so thankful for that and we really appreciate brother Wayne I appreciate his stand Amen on the word of God the message of the hour that we are are standing in in this moment and we are we are expecting any moment amen the very atoms of our bodies to be changed that's the hour we're living in amen our eyes are not set to election Tuesday our eyes are set on what is certain amen amen and that's the Lord Jesus

Isaac and sister Bethany amen so glad to have them here and each one of you amen this is a special moment for us amen special moment for us let's just sing as we invite brother Wayne to go ahead and

let's just pull on the gift of God this morning let's pull on El Shady eye because he has for us just what we have need of Amen go ahead brother Brian whatever you have on your heart amen glory be to God amen Hallelujah let's just let's just sing this as our brother would come [Music] Your Eyes Upon Jesus yes Lord look for in his wonderful thing [Music] please me today in the lines [Music] look for in his Wonder Woman and the things [Music] amen God bless you this morning amen certainly one look into the face of Jesus Christ will forever change a man there's no one ever looked upon him and remain the same and when you step into the unveiled presence of God the Bible said it will change you from Glory unto glory and the obstruction and obscurity has moved and you can see a perfect image of Christ we are changed into the same image as we are beholding him amen God bless you it's certainly good to be here this morning to experience and fill the anointing of your worship service and sound like somebody come this morning to have church amen to come and enjoy his presence and and his Liberty we want to bring you all greetings from our pastor brother Erickson and the church there true word Tabernacle and all the saints and Amen brother Samuel Browning is a is a superstar down there in that church everyone loves him so much and he has such a testimony among them as I know he does you and I'm bringing you greetings brother Samuel from everybody down there God bless you and uh we certainly want to say that it is an honor and amen to have our family here this morning and get to be here with everyone and I want to take a few minutes this morning in the scripture we've been on a little bit of series at home that want to preach the whole series this morning so but I do want to maybe speak a little something from it something it's been a blessing to our heart I've been studying uh out of the message of the rising of the Sun and something has really struck my heart the way the prophet would teach is he he brings it and he says it's Sunday again and this morning we think of Sunday as a Roman word s-u-n-d-a-y and we it's the first day of the week but in the Bible times there was no such a word as s-u-n-d-a-y it was just the first day of the week but brother Branham says see that I think it was in about 300 A.D that they gave the name Constantine gave the name to Sunday it was a Roman word he said but see in the this age of this time he said Christ has made it Sunday s-o-n-d-a-y that when the son of man has risen Among Us and he's made it the first day of the week again so we want to go to mark 16. and we want to identify a couple of scriptures here Mark 16 and verse 2. uh I think it's a beautiful reading here March 16. verse 2. we'll be reading Romans 8 and 11 also so let's read Mark 16 and verse 2. and very early in the morning the first day of the week see there it is it would in modern times it would read very early in the morning on Sunday but in Bible times it was called the first day of the week they came unto the Sepulcher at the rising of the sun now that's where brother Brandon would gather his title for the message Rising the Sun 1965. but let's go to Romans the eighth chapter in the 11th verse is what brother branham's going to do is he's going to transfer what the resurrection was in the Bible times and he's going to show you that we're living in that same day again in Romans the 8th chapter in the 11th verse but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken thank you your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit the dwelleth in you now we can also go to Luke 17 and verse 30. Luke 17 and verse 30. so you got Mark 16 and 2. and now we're going to have Luke 17 and 30. but Romans 8 and 11 is the scripture that transfers the resurrection in the days of Jesus to the resurrection that we're living now even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed even though shall it be in the day so brother Graham calls it the Sunday when the son of man is revealed let's bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for your grace we thank you for your mercy on this Sunday Lord we thank you for the benefits of the sun shining and the health that we feel the life and the worship that's here in the atmosphere Lord of this assembly now Lord Jesus when they went to the tomb they found you and wasn't there any longer but you had Risen Lord and you made yourself known among them now Lord Jesus we have returned to that day Lord when you're no longer in the Tomb but Lord you have risen and you made a promise that you would meet with us and that you would prove your Resurrection now Lord Jesus we thank you for your presence this morning we make you welcome Among Us and Lord we're asking you that you would do the supernatural you would do the amazing Among Us this morning Lord we'll give you all the honor and the glory and the praise we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and may God bless you this morning amen it's Sunday again it's Sunday again amen amen now it's Sunday again speaking of it's the day when the son of man is revealed you know the Bible predicted this day would come Jesus's own words he said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man would be revealed so it was predicted in the Bible that this day would come but we are not predicting the coming of that day we're living in that day we're not just talking about a day that is coming we are living in the very day that the Bible spoke of and what would happen now if we're in the Sunday there is tremendous blessings of living in that day there are tremendous benefits of living in the day when the sun is revealed amen and and now the prophet in the message of the rising of the son here in paragraph 81 he he goes into a certain area and he says I'd like to read a scripture for you and I'd like to turn to another scripture so he read those scriptures I read then he reads the scripture I'd like to read you another scripture I'd like you to turn here and maybe it will help you in Leviticus the 23rd chapter in the 9th to the 11th verse now listen close in levitical law God was speaking to Moses and he was saying these things are types and how we'll stop here for a moment to get into a tide and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and you say unto them when you come into the land which I give you unto the place or the position that I have given to you now you speak to the children of Israel that you when you get to this certain place I promised I'd take you when you get in there in that land speaking natural here typing the spiritual you shall reap the Harvest thereof you received what I told you now what he's saying is is Moses has spoke to the children of Israel and said you're going to go into a certain land and when you get into that land you'll reap the Harvest thereof so brother Bantam says now that's taking a natural saying he said but I'm going to give it to you in a spiritual type that when you get to the place that I told you of that you can reap the Harvest thereof in other words you can have the things that have been spoken concerning that place you will receive the Harvest of the place and the time that you're living and and when he says that of course he says Moses is speaking naturally I'm speaking spiritually so there's a harvest in the season we're living if it's Sunday there's a harvest in the season of Sunday There's Something That We're to receive now what are we harvesting we're harvesting the things that have been spoken concerning the age and the time that we're living in and it belongs to you because it's been promised to you it's not something for another day or another season it's for the day that you're living in now now the prophet will say this to you in adoption series 1960. he said now a man outside of Canaan knows nothing about this he's still wondering he's he's not saying that he's not a good man I don't say that I don't say that the men in Egypt's not a good man but until he's come over into this possession and The Possession see the promise that was given to the church is not a natural land it is a spiritual land it is a spiritual land a spiritual priesthood scene it's a Promised Land but to you and I it's not a natural land it's a spiritual land that's why when Abraham went over into the promises the Bible always speaks of Israel uh the land they call it the promised land now the reason it's called the promised land it's because it's the land God promised to them it's a promised land and so did Paul in the book of Ephesians remember in the first chapter he said after that you've heard the word of Truth you are sealed by the spirit of promise see the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Promise it's the promised spirit of God or the promised lamb that God made a promise according that he would give it to us so the same as Abraham went into the natural land so has it been that God would bring the church in a spiritual land and it would be a promised land now of course amen that lamb was made a promise to Abraham then again it was made a promise to Isaac and then again it was made a promise to Moses it never changed but it kept moving up and God kept promising the church amen and even till it come to the time in the Book of Joshua in the sixth chapter that God actually showed Joshua a vision I have given you this land now when that land amen was given to them remember amen that the lamb was given to them but nobody ever actually possessed that land until the Book of Joshua now what that means to you and I is that the book of Ephesians was written in Paul's day but nobody actually possessed what Paul was talking about until this day when he said you're predestinated under the spirit of adoption how many realizes adoption is an end time event amen the fullness of adoption is the change of the body it's the first Thessalonians 4 and First Corinthians 15 if the adoption is a promise to the end time as it is said we are seated in Heavenly places but they was not seated in that position in the days of Paul for the Bible tells us it's an end time promise how many knows brother random said that when Jesus was talking to the sons of thunder their mother come and said let my son set at thy right in the left hand and he said Jesus said it's not mine to give to them but it's been prepared for another people brother man said those people were the Overcomers of the laodicey and age that they would overcome that age and God would give them so Paul saw them in position but they never got the position until God gave the end time message to position the church in the last days he said preacher I don't know well what about what about the devil's position back there in the scripture Satan in second Thessalonians Paul said I see him as God calling himself sitting in the temple of God above all that is called God Amen and Paul Saul brother man said watch this he said in Isaiah 14 Isaiah saw that in the heart of the devil he wanted to be above the Vindicated word the sons of God he said but Paul saw him in position in second Thessalonians 2 but see Paul never could announce amen that he was the god of the evil age until the end time age Satan was solemn position in the book of Thessalonians but he took his position in the loudest and age you were Saul in position but now you're taking your position because this is the day of adoption it's Sunday again it's the season when God has Anointed The Bride to go into the place wherein he has promised to go into I say that when Moses died when the prophet left the scene that was when Joshua heard the words you arise and go over this Jordan as long as that Prophet was alive the people could not possess what Moses had talked about but when the prophet passed away then the church began to move into the position which he had told them they never left Moses's words they never aired from what Moses taught but the commission had changed and Joshua was now possessing what was being given he and he said as I was with Moses so shall I be with him well I'll tell you something today the same God that was with a message coming the same God that gave you the promises of the end time message is the same God right here this morning to help you possess the end time message it was God that told us to come to these places it was God that led us into these areas of the word we did not bring ourselves here we did not ask for the season we didn't have the choice of what day we lived in but God who is rich in Merced amen punishing the most wicked of Ages and the most wicked of times but he said there'll be an overcomer in there there'll be a bride in there she'll be without spotter Eco and I will lift her and seat her in a position above all this world and everything will be under her feet come on Church the types are too wonderful all things are under her feet Joshua wheresoever you put your foot shall be your possession whatever God leads you to believe you can have it come on church you've left too much on the table for too long you've lived underprivileged for too long some of you got children you need to claim them this morning you need to put your foot on the Promises of God can I say it better not just your foot on the Promises put your lips on the Promises it's time to start speaking the promises of God and saying they belong to me this is fine I'm going to accept it it's what God's going to give me too long for too long we've allowed Satan to have too much that belongs to us that's right arise therefore and go over this Jordan I believe that was the season we're living arise and Rising we've lived in living home we've walked in other people's promises too long but this time belongs to this bride and it's time to take what belongs to you now I know the season that Joshua came to cross the Jordan was a season of impossibility actually it was a hard time to cross amen it would have been an easier time at other times maybe if the Lord would have waited a few months amen the waters wouldn't have been so raging have you ever went up to a river and it's a nice River but then you go after a big flood or something and the things just rage and it's almost scary amen little ditch outside your house just a little Trinkle of water but you let a lot of rain come and it gets deep and and you can't hardly cross over it a week ago you can just step over it well the Jordan's not a great big river but in the spring of the year comes the latter rain which is the Harvest rain and God was bringing the children of Israel in at Harvest time he was not he was not bringing them in and planting time he was bringing them in in Harvest time you got to realize we are reaping things we've never planted and the Church of the Living God is being brought in at the time of the Harvest we are brought in we are not trying to ring all these things out and figure out what prophet meant and what the prophet didn't mean what truth is and what true faith we have been brought into the season when the seed of this Bible has been brought into the Harvest Time in the Church of the Living God is going to have enough strength to take what God has already brought from the Bible and brought into an Harvest but if you're going to go in and harvest time you're going to have to wage some light of rain you're going to have to live in a latter-range season and it made the Jordan flood in that time that they lived in the waters were flooded it looked like God had lost his had lost his ability to leave because of the Season he's bringing him here the waters are flooding they also say in the same very season that the the Jordan was full because of the snow that was in the mountains of Judea how many he realizes that whenever you put a warm rain on Snowy Mountains you don't only get the rain that's falling you get the snow this melt things were doubling up things were doubling up and they were stealing up the river and everything in them said you can't come into this land he'll never make it in this land but see God had already determined somebody was going to walk it out somebody is going to live this and it was the day the season had come for it to take place and When God says it amen God doesn't have to back up brother he don't have to wait for the seasons to change God can set the season himself God can change the season I don't care the condition if God said go over brother just go over if God said go get it I say just go get it and God will make a way where there is no way y'all know that's right and God told him to go over you know what he did he told them Levites put the word on your shoulders and go over this Jordan and when he told him to put the word see the word goes first now that's the beauty of the age me and you were living in we're not following Miracles and miracles are following us we're not following signs and Gifts that's not what we're doing but they will huddle the True Believer because the believer follows the word I Xtra should not leading by their gifts they're not leading by their imagination they're leading by the word and whatever the word says you can do you can do it it's not what I said it's not what your pastor says it's what the word of God has spoken for your age and the word said go over this land I have given it a possession for you don't you let it depart from the left and to the right and you keep these things on your lips and you you speak these things as you go over this land now God picked an impossible time but God is a god of impossibility and the scripture tells us with a word on their shoulders they took a step into the Jordan and the moment they stepped in the waters parted can you imagine the the supernatural that came at that moment now there are commentators and our historians that say that that was a earth slide up above where they were crossing at the very moment and it was just a good coincidence that things happened well let me tell you I don't believe in coincidences I believe in Divine coincidences I believe God can plan it but it was planned before the foundation of the world and God knew exactly when to tell them to do it the same God that had opened the Red Sea was now opening the Jordans and they went across dry trod the moment they stepped into the water yes it dried up now you're not so powerful if you go back and read the biblical account the Bible says in Joshua 4 that God told them to gather stones out of the river and put them where the where the men of God had stood now they didn't get Rivers off they didn't get Stones off of the bank they didn't go get Stones off of the stone pile over on the bank they took the stones that would normally be way under water and they took stones that had been recovered from a supernatural events that they would have never had if the story wasn't true but every stone that was stacked held its own testimony I came from an impossible situation I came from a time when it didn't look like it could happen but God made it happen anyhow listen that's the kind of God we serve every one of you are here this morning that's a testimony that God can do the impossibilities and they stacked them Stones up because some things you shouldn't forget and God told him take these stones and put them where the feet of them of them men of God stood put them Stones right there with them men stood and they stacked them Stones up in the water see but you all know there were two stacks I I for years I didn't realize that but they passed the two stacks I was studying the scripture and it literally said there was a stack where they stood and there's a stack on the gilgal side and God made two stacks of stones if you're standing on the bank in the middle of high water that was a stack of stones to say Amen there was a time that God dried up this high water and God can do it again but if you were there during a season of drought or a season when the water got low you would see Stone sticking out of the water and somebody would say watch the stone sticking out of the water he said well there was a time that God gathered Stones when the river went dry when the river went dry yes when God dried up there River and Men walked across dry tried that's the way we come into this land and the god that led us in in his Supernatural event also will be a supernatural power to destroy every demon that gets in front of the Church of the Living God he didn't leave us at the Jordan he didn't leave us at the Jordan he did in the Supernatural God didn't quit it for Jordan that was the god that was leading that was the god that was going to change circumstances because he remained to be God the whole time and they went up there I think it's powerful amen it's it's if you like to study history it's written in history I've actually been to that place Chris and I stood right there at that place they still baptized people there today it's recorded to be the place where John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ the place where Joshua went over into the land type of the Holy Ghost is the place that John baptized Jesus and when John got ready to baptize Jesus there was people standing on the bank and they were saying this couldn't be this couldn't happen the Pharisees didn't like it John the Bible said told them don't stand there and say you're of your Abraham the father or you're of certain class or you're a certain denomination he said God's able these Stones God's table these Scholars I believe John was looking at the same pile of stones come on it was in the same season that he was baptized in Jesus and he said God is Heavenly Stones let me tell you this God's able Stones arise children under Abraham you don't have to come from a certain family name you don't have to come from a certain class of people come on you don't have to have a certain education or a certain skin color amen there has to be a seed of eternal life in you before the foundation of the world and the God who is rich in Mercy well I feel like amen praising the Lord this morning what a God return but an hour what a time to believe God's able these Stones listen if these men of God who God is lifted up in this age won't preach this message God will raise up for nobody to do it come on I know men preached this message for years and one day they got to thinking it was wrong and God just set them aside and went right on and God raised up young men to stand right but they stood and God's still doing it in this age amen you may be having your place this morning [Applause] children and Abraham I guarantee you God will have a seed and he'll keep raising until somebody believes amen because somebody's going to believe it now they were stacked there amen it's also written Amen in history now that that's the same very place that aligns you and Elijah crossed John the Baptist likes that place because it's the same place that Elijah and Elijah they'll crossed in the same place come on Church it wasn't a white they all crossed at the same place and that's right but the bride of Christ crosses is in the realm of the supernatural that's where it happened that's where it takes place and that's where it'll happen again today look what happened in Elijah and Elijah's time y'all remember when Elijah and Elijah went to cross him Elijah wanted to cross that River and he just took off his coat all right and he just struck the water and the same God that had opened the Jordan in the days of Joshua opened it again and Elijah and Elisha walked across do I try I imagine Elijah petted the Rocks as he walked by amen that same God was still alive the same God was existing in the Days of Elijah and Elisha saw I bet Elijah saw them stones and thought my we are living in the same day we are living in the same kind of day and when they got on the other side amen he watched Elijah going to the heavens he watched the very reignment of Elijah come back to the Earth he watched the cloak of a man of God come back on the Earth but it returned with a promise if you see me go away you'll have a double portion of what I have come on church and when Elijah saw that Elijah's garment come back to the Earth he didn't run around pointing at it he didn't run around pointing at it say that's that's a [Applause] the prophet of God Amen dropping his coat back in this age with a message and me go around say that's what the prophet said that's what the prophet said that's what the prophet did that's what the prophet did that's what the prophet did that's what the but the promise is not me pointing about the prophet did the promise that I could pick it up come on church and when Elijah picked it up he started right where Elijah quit come on he didn't go through the first two polls people's always saying well if you're part of the third pool what's your first two well that's a devil that's just the devil because a bride never was promised two pulls amen the first two took place in a cave and spoke about vindicating a prophet but the third poll was a word concerning a bride a 10 Vision amen and when Elijah stopped us where Elisha started and the bride of Christ were not in the first two pearls but brother we are a Vindication of the third pool of this word and we are not just here talking about it we have become the Vindication and we're standing here wearing the garments and a puppet said we could wear I say pick it up this morning and strike the water and say where is the god of Elijah I'm not asking where Elijah is I say where's the god where's the god of William Branham it's here Elijah's God is with us today he's not on a vacation he's not sleepy he's not away he said whatever two or three of you together than my name there I will be Hallelujah [Applause] brother he saw the same stones he saw the same stones when Joshua went over when Joshua went over that River I'll tell you what brother if you don't think God don't pre-plan things the Bible records in gosh from before 19 the people come out upon the Jordan on the 10th day of the first month that might have been an accident really if you read the book of Exodus in the 12th chapter you'll see that after 400 years of being bondage in slavery that when God sent to Moses unto the people amen do you know in the night of their Deliverance in the eve of the you know what God said unto them in Exodus 12 it happened amen this month amen it happened in the first month and the tenth day of the month Eli or Moses gave them the token message that they should prepare for a Passover it happened in the same season it happened in this because God knows to see what happened in that season see that we're in the fourth month it's it's if you get time to study these things are beautiful but they were actually already in the fourth month would have been April Passover Easter time so Easter to a Jew is the first month of the year everybody else starts in January and everybody had started maybe in January but when Moses talked to God he walked in he said this is the first month of the year amen that's why when people say Passover they also say New Beginning because when God speaks to a prophet they start over it's a new beginning why does the calendar start over when Jesus Christ because he's the Passover Lamb amen and God started over and Moses and leaves telling the children of Israel in the 10th day of the first month remember what he told them he told him that it would be a Passover and God would execute judgment upon the gods of Egypt if you take time to study it every Miracle Moses performed but if you really study it you'll find Miracles didn't come from Moses they come from Aaron where Moses's rod hallelujah it's the truth amen and when they perform their miracles they exercised a miracle over every Egyptian deity that was thought to be great among them the gods of the Nile the gods of the feminine the gods of fatality the gods of the of their cattle and God exercised the power over every one of their cattle every one of their ideas every one of their gods because he was proven proven to get him and things began to Dan there but it started with a lamb now listen if you want to start over you got to start over with lamb that's right you can start over but you got to have a lamb and it's going to be a perfect lamb if you want released from your life you're going to have a lamb to get released and the Bible said it was a new beginning that new beginning had a lamb every new beginning has a lamb let me say this to you if you like to study things this was also the same season that Ruth the moabitants entered into the Harvest and she met Boaz it was in barley harvest the Passover was party Harvest New Beginnings are partly Harvest your new beginning is in the season of harvest when we came into this land you are no more a Wanderer you are no wonder somebody who was a slave in Egypt you are now the children of the Living God and God is leading you to every promise he made concerning this age now you may be sitting here this morning saying well brother Wayne I don't think that I'm able to do this this is a new beginning it's time for you to start over the way you think start over the way you feel start over the way you identify yourself quit identifying well whoever that was that done those things said those things act in those things it's time to start your life over again this is Sunday it's time to start over again that's a new beginning brother Samuel I have to say it I don't believe in second chances God is a god of second chances I don't believe that I believe it's got a second chance is third chances four chances fifth chances six chances seven chances eight chances I don't care how long it takes if God has called you God will change the situation to match what is said in his word I know the devil's trying to put a number on your chances so he can say you're out of chances I say the devil's too late [Applause] had a chance to Satan has had a chances we know the truth now Ruth I'm about to start it over she she started over at the feet of Boaz and so is the Church of the Living God started over and this age unto the Lamb's Ministry of not just a lamb but the life of the Lamb it was a Passover Sunday again Naomi instructed Ruth you know the story and she received her beginning at Passover listen it was Rahab the harledger that has been hid in the Bible this entire time all of the time Moses and all that reading you're doing the children of Israel in there amen I don't know how old she is exactly but she's old enough to have heard of the great Miracles that had took place in the crossing of the sea and she had been entrenched in her lifestyle of prostitution and it really wasn't even her fault she was there it's just the way she were born and put in there by her family now brother man said it types you in a denominational system or in the filth of Life whatever it was you were in but I want to I want you to realize that as long as it was under Moses's Ministry she never came into view that's right never was exposed scripturally as long as Moses was still there but when Moses left the scene and Joshua entered into that land he found Rahab in that land oh my and where has the bride been found in this age you have been found in the opening of the word you was found you was there it was your season come on it's your season to find a bride isn't it hell Asia went to the whale to look for a woman amen but he found Rebecca in the evening light and so has this bride been found come on we didn't know nothing about a bride we didn't even know the pages of this Bible held and in time adoption right but now for the first time forever at age we'll come out of the dark denomination Elizabeth resurrection of the power of God his soul has been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to come one [Applause] so brother Wayne I'll tell you what man it's a powerful thing but I don't know if we can come out of what we're in let me tell you this Rahab couldn't come out to that time but then she found her time to come out Gentiles entered the promise in the time of Joshua it's Paul in the official Church and you're found in the book of Ephesians after a prophet reveals it in the end time listen to this amen it's revealed in Joshua amen now now Rahab done something in that season she received instruction from two men of God who told her how to change her citizenship all right now she heard about the The Exodus had happened down there she heard about that and she heard about a God that could separate Egyptian cattle from Israelite cattle she heard about a God who could separate Egyptian homes amen from Israelite homes she's heard about a God that can separate the firstborn of Egypt and the firstborn of Israel and she wanted instruction how can I get on the right side of this separation and those men of God else men of God preached the token to her amen they said there's a sign of the token and if you hang that Scarlet thread it'll be a sign unto Joshua that you have changed your inheritance and you're no longer a citizen of Jericho but you're now property of the almighty God so when Joshua came he was in judgment he was Redeemer now I don't have time to preach all this but I'll tell you go study a goal and in one place they're a judge Avenger of blood another place they're already gamer and Joshua was both when he come to Jordan he was both when he come to Jericho he was both an Avenger of the blood and he was a redeemer of Rahab he destroyed her enemies and gave her Liberty I tell you this my God my God is still an Avenger every devil that's ever touched your life every demon that's ever tried to destroy you he sent the Holy Ghost to drop down the walls that protect those devils and cause them to come under the feet of the Living God I mean now I don't have time to go in these types but I'll tell you this amen when Joshua come into the Jericho amen they shouted after the Red Sea opened but when it come to the walls of Jericho they didn't shout before they after they fell but these men of God started shouting before they failed showing the Bride of type that that would come to confession before it becomes a bunch of flourishing and the men of God listen what they the prophet of God tells us one of the great laws that were in the Jubilee was that if you were in a walled City you couldn't come out so if you sold property and it was in a walled City when the Jubilee sounded you couldn't come out in the Jubilee because you were behind a walled city which made you a property of that City but when Joshua came there was a promise hanging on the outside it was on the outside it was on the outside of the wall saying I'm stuck in here but something 's out of here and Joshua knew that he couldn't call her out under the Jubilee but the God who was rich in Mercy amen had Joshua to walk down the walls of Jericho to release that daughter of Abraham listen they can build all the walls they want to around you amen the devil can build every kind of complex he wants around you and you might not be able to come out of it but God has the power to tear it down and bring you out of it because of something on the outside saying God I'm in here and I want out of here I take every child of God this morning ought to show a sign to God I'm trapped maybe if something I don't want to be but God don't lead me in this take me out of this and he's a God that can tear it down this morning I'm talking about the supernatural God of Abraham that can change lives and hearts he remains to be God oh he couldn't take her out but he could take it down you know why God could do that because she was now his property by a token side and if you belong to God he can take you out of any situation you can get yourself into It Well by the way you don't know my situation we'll talk take it up with Jonah then would you God can get you out of it God can get you out of it you say preacher what are you saying I'm saying even after a body change Abraham still lied oh I know the legalist in you that just kills you but it's the truth anyhow and if you had a body change and Sarah did too or the king wouldn't have only on his wife but in fear for his life he lied to the man come on church amen but God knew he was a human it's in the Bible the Bible said he remembered they were only flesh come on church amen now you might as well just get real with me for a moment here you're not an angel and you never were an angel and you're never going to be an angel and as long as you've got that on your mind the devil's gonna whip you around every corner because you're going to fail yourself you're going to fail your God you're going to fail your church because you're a human being and you've got to remember I never was an angel I'm never going to be an angel but I always was a son and God redeemed me as a son I want to ask you something who's got more Authority on the earth a redeemed son or an angel in heaven oh I redeemed son so if you've got more Authority on the earth than an angel in heaven the devil is an angel but he's a fallen angel and he's failing to hell but I know you've got more Authority than the devil this morning it's time you remember who you are and what God puts you on this Earth form [Applause] talking about a people that's been annoying to them ordained of God to come into this season of time it's Sunday again you ought to tell that devil this is my day his smile God called me to this day to worship God called me to this day to Rejoice God called me to this day to receive the benefits of life I will not be robbed [Applause] Rachel what are you talking about I'm talking about when God declares you his property he has a right to clear it of everything that don't belong to him I just love it I just love how God changes things how God could change you the other man takes a beautiful thought he said when God redeems the Earth he said as a new Heaven and a new Earth he said oh it doesn't mean an annihilated one he said it means god loses it from the grip of Satan he said the same way he does you and me in our lives he reduces it from the grip of Satan now if you go into the Bible and you watch The Story of Lazarus when Lazarus was in a tomb but come on Brad when Lazarus was in a tune it was the fourth day when Jesus the word spoke and resurrected Lazarus how many knows that Jesus said I shall ReStore in the last days number four bugs of death that took the tree down and brother man said there was four that restored it there's justification sanctification the baptism of the spirit he said then the word itself the word itself that's exactly where we are the Pentecostals watched look three steps they've all walked three steps he said watch that girl walking them high heels up three steps he said but she couldn't walk the word and that's where he fell off was on the word but there's a bride that won't fall in the last days amen you can't fall from the word you are the word that's right you are what the prophets was talking about and look at this because you were in a tomb somebody thought well hey man there's no one sense to trouble the master now she he's already dead but Jesus said I'll go wake him up the vision says he'll wake up on the fourth day and you know how he woke him up he called his name come on in the middle of a graveyard you can have a Revival for just one man just one man can come out of the Tomb showing you there's been churches and churches and brides and Brides but there's got to be one and he'll call her by name she might be in the most wicked of all the ages but a Revival will happen in that bride because he will call your name from the Lamb's Book of Life and when he calls your name I've often thought about last we're sitting down there around the table with Abraham been there three days you know things y'all hear that y'all hear that no no we don't hear anything do you hear that no I don't hear anything I wouldn't hear anything at all it's wait a minute wait a minute I know that voice I know that voice I've known that but I've heard him before hey boys I got a goal I gotta go cause up there in the other dimension Jesus was saying elizarus [Music] come forth and Corruption couldn't hold him I hope you hear me this morning corruption couldn't hold him four days a day the Bible said it was stinking already corruption had set in already death was upon him but listen when God speaks for you to come regardless of the condition you are in God can restore his back to everything that you lost he made corruption lose its grip upon Lazarus and he raised him up the same as he did you you were in the tombs of denomination and the graves of tradition and the unbelief of this world if you wonder if I'm telling you the truth read Ephesians chapter 2 the Bible said you who were dead in sins and trespasses right you were dead brother man calls it a resurrection a resurrection for the bride so she comes out of the Tomb the same as Jesus come out of the Tomb in three days what took a hundred men to put a stone to keep him in one Angel broke it and moved it out of the way it took all those denominations to roll a stone over this bride and say she'll never rise to that Apostolic Faith again but what it took all of them to do God sent one Angel Out of Heaven broke the seals and rolled back the stone and the bride comes out of denomination and she's alive brother he's alive in John the 14th chapter you can read it he said because I live you live also because I live you live also now you may have never heard it this way but go read it sometimes paragraph 97 he said I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is yeah I live you live two lives there I live see Jesus raised and ye lived you'll raise because I live there'll be a resurrection in this bride and at the day I'm talking about you will know that I'm the father the father me and I in you now go read that a little bit and see brother Brandon said what happens is she materializes the promise she becomes Elohim tangible once you are resurrected then you're transformed and the mortal flesh becomes God's flesh your flesh becomes his flesh your our eyes become his eyes your hands become his hands you are resurrected from the dead [Music] now you said preacher what are you saying I'm saying John Amen in the Book of John record Lazarus coming from the grave he was alive but the Bible also records another event it said when he came out of the Grave he was bound hand and foot he was alive but it was all bound up Church of the Living God if that ain't a story if that ain't a story to preach to an end-time people amen they're alive brother man said you already resurrected come on Church you're not looking for the resurrection you're already resurrected but they some people had become mummified Christians they spent four days in the Tomb with that dirty stinking gray clothes and they come forth and there's new life on the inside this new life there's life there amen but they still wear them same old stinking clothes they had on in that tomb hold on come on I'm not talking about the clothes on the outside of you I'm talking about the ideas I'm talking about the traditions and the feelings I'm talking about what keeps you tied up and the Bible said they were tied up hand and foot so in other words I could preach a whole sermon here this morning called mummified Christians and that's something mummified can you imagine a Christian That Couldn't raise their hands can you imagine a Christian that because of what they have did and what they come out of for some reason the devil has bound them that they can't lift their hands and worship God I tell you it's time at the voice of the word of God said loose him and let him go I think it's time to lose the church to let Him worship again it's time to let him raise their hands again I say Satan take your filthy dirty hands off of the Church of the Living God I don't have time to read it but David said we ought to praise the Lord everything that has breath or to praise the Lord but you know why you know why that Lazarus couldn't do it because he had grave clothes he had it on his hands he couldn't lift his hands in Victory he couldn't praise the Lord with his hands somebody had to untime amen he had bound about his feet come on church amen you know what I'm talking about amen who took dance and out of the church y'all help me y'all help me ask me amen honestly who took dancing out of the church brother man said there was a time I was a Critic a real critic of dancing he said but God straighten me up on that and I saw there was a dance in the world and there's a dance in the church come on church amen but somebody wrapped up the feet of the church and said you can't dance you came dancing the Lord you can't worship amen but I say we ought to take the great clothes off of the church that they only be able to dance in the house of God we ought to be able to wash him in the house of God come on church we ought to be able to walk in the presence of God in the last times you know you know Lazarus also had something over his face don't you amen that covered his mouth where he couldn't amen the word he couldn't speak the word he couldn't praise God with his lips but I say take their grave clothes off this morning and rejoice she in the name of the Lord this is the siege that we live I say Satan ought to take his hands off of the Church of the Living God [Applause] and all right with it he ain't got no right with it he said brother Wayne what are you talking about I'm talking about when you become God's Property he has a right to transform you to the way he sees you being look at this prodigal son when he left when he left the prodigal son left all right but there come a time he wanted to come home you know what the Bible says about that he said he arose he said it here Rose and wanted to return home he meant what'd he do he raised for my life of sin to return home it was a resurrection the same as your spiritual resurrection that happens but he still had to get home he still had to go back to his father but when he arose the Bible says this he meant that his father saw him coming and said be my boy that was dead is alive now [Music] he saw him coming now he didn't see somebody else's son y'all know what I'm talking about I don't know how long he said on that porch oh no I don't know how long he was gone but he sat on that porch and watched that road how long did he watch it how long did he sit there waiting day after day after day after day and there was a lot of people come over that hill and there was a lot of men come walking down that road but he didn't get up for none of them but when he saw his own son returning come on church he was alive and returning but he had clothes on like he was in the world come on now come on my Bible tells me that the father got up and ran out to meet him that singer he got inspiration didn't he the only time he ever saw God run I tell you it's the only time you'll ever see my God run it's running to the repentance Center that's turned his height back to God running to change him running you know why he ran he didn't only run to greet him he didn't want nobody seeing him the way he looked well Glory he didn't want nobody to hit the house to see what his son looked like when he was coming out of the world but the Bible said he met him out there in the field and brother when he met him out there amen amen the Bible said he took the best of his shoes and when I you know why he took Jews out there because slaves in those days didn't wear shoes slaves had had lost the effort they didn't have the money for shoes and you could see a man walking without shoes and it was a sign he was somebody slave but when that boy got up to return home he said in his mind I'll go back and be a slave in my father's house but he never was a slave to begin with and he couldn't come back to being a slave you never were a servant you never were to begin with you can't go back to being God or danger to be a Son of God to begin with look at what he did when his father met him out there he met him with shoes and he put the shoes on his feet that if anybody saw him ever see him as a slave they would seem as a son with the best of the shoes he girded his feet but I'm gonna tell you something else he did amen the Bible said he said bring me the best of the robes a rich man like that he didn't say give me a robe he said bring me the best robe we got brethren and he met him out there in the field amen and he took that old filthy racket garment he was wearing and he wrapped him in his room oh wear something like this come on he didn't earn that robe he didn't work for that role he didn't stand there and put 40 Years of Labor in but from the moment he started back to his father's house amen he wanted him to know you are accepted as a son as though you never were in the pit to begin with God don't want the world seeing you and slopping field he took that wrong he took that robe and wrapped him he took his own ring and put it up on his hand an adopted son was returning home a man with his head up a man that didn't have to go back home he made him worried about what everybody was going to think that's what the devil does the moment you really want to come home and serve God he'll say well what about this and what about this and what about that and what about this amen and it is such a mountain there are many people who can never return back to full restoration because somebody has said you've been gone too long you've done too much but listen if you were a son amen you always were a son you always will be a son I don't care how long you were gone God still has a place for you foreign time I was his property one time you were his property but not now but not now brother we are right now the sons of God now I know I know sometimes we get to look in this and we'll say well I'll tell you I I don't know about all this but you know there's four titles to Jesus Christ they're four Sun titles Son of God Son of David Son of Abraham son of man and everyone of those titles give him a promise to the Earth to God to heaven to the people because he's a son he inherits all things as the son of God but the devil on the other hand has not one title of son he is not a son he is the devil a Tormentor and the prophet of God said he don't own none of it he's a squatter to begin with amen he said preacher what are you talking about let me just say this to you I I'm going to run out of time before I get there but let me just say this to you whoever was living where Jericho was when Joshua come to get it God said they were squatting on ground and belong to them right man I don't know how long they've been there maybe four thousand years maybe they built them walls for 300 years old but it never was theirs to start with they were only living on ground that nobody was occupying but the moment the original owners come to get it they had to move God made them move now watch the prophet if God tells us this he said listen now he said these things that God has given the church is your legal possession they legally Belong To You amen and the Devil is a squatter who tries to live upon the rights of the church now it was some time ago when I was a kid brother when I was a kid it was all the time my dad and one of the neighbors that fought over property all the time it was a property line but down in Arkansas y'all just have to realize that early surveyors uh they they I bet they were drinking moonshine or something because things just didn't it wasn't all right you know uh the roads the roads that were built in the 70s there and some of them cut right across somebody's property and one of them went around and one of them went around an oak tree and I know why it went around the oak tree because my grandma said you can't cut the oak tree down and the oak tree was right on the edge where the road are to go and they come to cut it and she set it to base up with a shotgun so they had to take the road and go around it so the property lines are a little squibbled right there amen but they built the road now but if you go down to other area fences built on this guy and a little bit on that guy and two or three foot here and there and someone said well this guy he lived up the hill from my dad he lived in the city we lived in the county and he was always deciding we cleaned up he didn't care about this property till we cleaned it up my dad hauled a bunch of dirt and he was an operator so he cleaned the property up real nice and the guy come down here one morning build a fence right across my dad's front yard well now if you know anything about the law you can't let that stand right so what we what somebody did was after dark they hooked a chain to that fence and Drug it up the hill we didn't steal a fence it ended up the man's yard he got all his fence back we don't we we can't tell who did that yet but the fence couldn't stay there or we had to have a legal authority to move that fence even if it was put up on the wrong property now now the thing about it is is that happened back when I was a kid I mean I was 18 year old 17 year old like that well now here we are years later 30 years later amen and the Fellas passed away but that same Spirit got in his son and his son lives on the property right next door to my dad and my dad has bought this property and my sister's going to move a trailer on it well this guy decides that this one property line behind where this trailer is going to be there's about 10 foot of land between her and this road and he don't want her accessing that road from that trailer so he wouldn't put this big fence right between her and this little road and so so he did but he actually owns a little piece because they put the road in their own place so he owns this little piece and and I finally asked my dad the other day I said this must be the only property line in the state of Arkansas that actually matters because they put it right in the exact with the property there's not another property line around that area that offense is in the right place that one that's the only one that matters and I told my dad I said well if that guy wants to play that way I mean if he wants to let's let the lines matter let's just let them all matter so where you come into my dad's driveway you you know it should be just a straight drive it's a city street down to the edge of the county and you start going down this driveway and brother Samuel you have to go out around this guy's shop and you go out like this and then come back and then go down to my dad's place I always wondered why you had to go around like that and I was a kid I said well why we always go around that guy's shop like that so because it messes the driveway up so I I got to looking at a plat over all this the guy's shop is built right in the middle of my dad's driveway I mean literally it's built in the middle of the driveway and and so I asked my dad I said why don't you just get you a lawyer make the guy move the shop put all these lines back and end all this fussing for once and all and he said well son I talked to a lawyer he said but if this went uncontested for seven years he said there's a squatters rights and they now have a right a legal right to be there and there's nothing we can do about it I said are you kidding me he took trespassing too far and now we can't kick him off of it he said no had it been done years ago he said nobody contested it so it's just the way it is and I got to thinking about that I thought listen now now you got to contest these things but I thought I wonder if there's a squatter's right for the devil but you know what a prophet of God said he said there is no squatter rights he said the Devil is a squatter and he has no legal right to anything that belongs to you I don't care how long he's been there as a Son of God you've got a right to contest that devil and say get off of my property and I'll tell you this God's got an agent called the Holy Ghost that'll make him get off God sent the agent of the resurrected son in this age to make that devil get off of your property amen I got to look at this and the prophet of God said the holy spirit is here to make that devil get off of your property he's there no matter how long it's been he said you actually have a right to tell that devil to get up and to move off of your property so I I got to looking and and you know I I tell you I shared this with brother Tim's group down there in the e in the in this evening uh fall meeting but it's amazing there's a Brother David Cross and Heather cross is a it's a actual Deacon for brother Josh Bennett and I've known these people for years and years hunted with David I mean we've known him for years this girl has been suffering with a major arthritic condition she's been on medication for 15 years I actually noticed her hands one day big old knots on her Knuckles and on her hands and I asked her I said we were eating together and I said Heather what's wrong with your hands she said brother Wayne that's arthritis she said that it's crippling she said I have to take all kinds of medication I can't hardly get around well last year they brought her into the meetings and brought her up in the prayer line and brother Samuel amen the spirit of God came down in that prayer line she said I felt a warm feeling come over me when we begin to pray for her an immediate healing struck that girl's body the pain left her the swelling left her listen to me 15 years of arthritis but the Holy Ghost made it move that morning and let me tell you something I don't care how long the habit's been in your life the Holy Ghost is here to say you don't belong here in this life say he said well somebody said well brother Wayne I've been sick for a long time amen it don't matter how long you've been sick saying this little squatter rights with God the prophet of God if you if if y'all ever notice the Bible names amount of years I never I never knew why brother I never I never understood why does the Bible say there was a woman of an issue of blood for 12 years why does it say 12 years amen because I believe God wanted you to know she had been suffering a long time with that disease how many doctors reports were on her coffee table how many times has she been turned down and said there's nothing more we can do for you if you had more money we would try but she's out of money she's out of hopes she's out of efforts but she hears about Jesus and the Bible says she went out in the street and touched the Hem of His karmic and her issue was dried up 12 years and it left in an instance because the devil was squatting on her health and she had a right to call it back again 12 years what about a man who 38 years later to pull a Bethesda after 38 years of sickness in one word Jesus said take your bed rise up and walk 38 years and God said it's over I'll tell you what I I imagine some of you sitting right here this morning maybe the devil's told you it's been too long maybe the devil said it's been too long I know I know that the prophet even tells us about Georgia Carter was nine years in a bed with tuberculosis until God calls the prophet to walk in the room and say rise up and walk and after nine years amen the devil had to give the girls Health back to her because he's a squatter to begin with it doesn't belong to him to begin with listen you never did belong to the devil maybe you've been maybe you've been in something for years and years and you said brother Wayne it's been too long there's nothing I can do to get out of it the devil lied and deceitfully deceived you into it in the first place or you wouldn't been there to begin with he said well I did it willfully did you really do it will flee or was you deceived I bet you were deceived it's kind of like somebody sends you an email and says we have a 250 million dollar life insurance settlement for you because you're rich Uncle removed third time diet and you're the closest relative and if you just send us 250 dollars of return fee and a twelve hundred dollar uh legal document fees we will let you have 250 million dollars well if you give them the money you did it willfully but you were frauded and deceived into doing it they deceitfully took it from you because you thought you were getting something from it but they lied and the devil's a liar and he lied to you and said if you do this you'll have this if you do this you'll have this and he lied the whole time he's a fraud he's a liar he's a squatter and I say he's got no right in the Church of the Living God I believe this morning the prophet said we are to serve notice on that devil and tell him this morning you have no legal right in the church you got no legal right in my family and I assure thee in the name of Jesus Christ you got to write for it this morning it's time to serve notice on that devil and tell him to move off your property all right won't you stand to your feet with me this morning as our musicians come I have a right you have a right to say to that devil get off my property squatters somebody took trespassing a step too far he come by and visited and set up house true but you've got to write this morning he said brother Wayne it's been a long time listen you could tell him to leave the devil doesn't have one legal right at all not one legal right at all it's not no claim at all on you but if you'll serve notice this morning [Applause] you got a certain notice he said preacher what are you saying I'm saying it belongs to you and if you go to the message Revelation chapter 5 I believe it is brother Branham explains this real clearly and he said from the 40 days from the time of the death of Jesus he said there were 40 days of dispute about the church he said but on the 50th day it was a jubilee and the Holy Ghost came and filled the church he said it was a time of the ending of a dispute he said in recently in 1906 that same Holy Ghost fell and in 1963 what's this 50 years later some people turned down the Jubilee and they went back to denomination but to the people that accepted the Jubilee the seals opened to them and gave them an inheritance that belonged to you from before the foundation of the world and this message is calling you to enter into that amen and stand here this morning and and by and by rights know what belongs to you and you can stand here this morning and say to the devil it belongs to me and I know you're possessing it but I got a right to contest you and I will not let this go uncontested I won't do it have you ever had something in your life and Satan just keeps saying I'm going to stay there brother you got to contest it that's why brother Ben said you got to fight for every inch of the ground you're now you're not disputing over who it belongs to the dispute is over when the seals opened it was the end of the dispute it belongs to you but the devil's possessing it and brother Brahm said now you fight for every inch of grounds you belongs to you you don't fight like you're taking something away from him you fight like you're taking back what belongs to you joy and peace and life belongs to you listen it's Sunday again it's Sunday and I believe the Church of the Living God is coming the hour of Resurrection I wonder this morning would you curse that devil that's trying to take from you curse that demon that settled on your ground yeah just curse that devil saying you don't have any right here I curse you in the name of Jesus Christ addictions cursed in the name of Jesus nervousness I curse it in the name of Jesus Christ fear I curse you in the name of Jesus Christ said preacher what are you talking about I'm talking about bringing change to your life in this meeting this morning you said preacher I don't know if it could change sure it can change it could change in a moment it can change in one moment the entire thing can can take complete change can completely change that negative Spirit can become Joy that critical spirit can become encouraging that nervousness can become peace but we have a ride this morning it's just about our hearts together I wonder would you serve notice this morning would you just tell the devil you're not welcome you have no legal rights Satan
