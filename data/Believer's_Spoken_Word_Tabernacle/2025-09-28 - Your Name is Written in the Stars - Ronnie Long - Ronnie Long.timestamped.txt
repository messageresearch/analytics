[34:04] Oh, he washed my sins away
[34:10] and I am free.

[34:20] bound

[38:41] Amen.
[38:42] Amen. Worthy is the lamb.
[38:45] Worthy is the lamb that was slain. Amen.
[38:49] Amen. When every every nation and every
[38:52] tongue was trembling, they looked for a
[38:53] savior that could come and no man was
[38:55] found worthy. But there was the lamb
[38:57] that was worthy to come and to loose us
[39:01] from our fears and our our death cycle.
[39:04] But he was the lamb worthy before the
[39:05] foundation of the world. Amen. It's good
[39:08] to be with you this morning. Good to be
[39:09] in the house of the Lord. If we could
[39:11] just stand this morning and thank you
[39:14] for the songs, Brother Zachary, and
[39:18] Amen. the worship going forth. We just
[39:19] praise the Lord this morning. Amen. Good
[39:22] to be back with you and greet you in the
[39:24] name of the Lord. And of course,
[39:25] greetings from the from the folks back
[39:28] home.
[39:29] And uh sorry we my wife's not here. I
[39:33] got a I got a pastor driver this
[39:35] morning. Brother Ben brought me and
[39:38] we got uh we got a a fall fellowship
[39:41] thing after church today and my wife had
[39:43] volunteered to make soapas and tortillas
[39:46] and all kinds of stuff. So she said, "I
[39:48] want to go, but I'm just too busy." So
[39:51] So next time. But uh, Brother Ben's not
[39:54] as good of a cook, but he does get me
[39:55] here faster. So,
[39:57] love you, buddy. Amen. If you have your
[40:00] Bibles this morning, we turn to the book
[40:01] of Daniel, the 12th chapter.
[40:05] Amen. It's always good to be here. Uh,
[40:09] just enjoy the fellowship here. And, uh,
[40:12] the presence of the Lord amongst us is
[40:14] he's never failed us. Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just want to thank brother Samuel
[40:19] for the opportunity to come and we pray
[40:21] that the Lord's using him where he's at
[40:23] this morning.
[40:25] Amen. Daniel the 12th chapter in the
[40:27] first verse.
[40:29] And at that time Michael shall Michael
[40:32] stand up the great prince with prince
[40:34] withstandeth for the children of thy
[40:37] people. And there shall be a time of
[40:40] trouble such as never h never never was
[40:43] since there was a nation even to that
[40:46] same time. And at that time thy people
[40:49] shall be delivered, everyone that shall
[40:52] be found written in the book. I'm just
[40:54] going to read that again.
[40:57] And there shall be a time of trouble
[40:59] such as never was since there was a
[41:02] nation even to that same time. And at
[41:05] that time thy people shall be delivered,
[41:08] everyone that shall be found written in
[41:11] the book. And many of them that sleep in
[41:13] the dust of the earth shall awake, some
[41:15] to everlasting life, and some to shame
[41:17] and everlasting contempt. And they that
[41:20] be wise shall shine as the brightness of
[41:23] the firmament, and they that turn many
[41:25] to righteousness as the stars forever
[41:28] and ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[41:31] the words, and seal the book even to the
[41:33] time of the end. And many shall run to
[41:35] and fro, and knowledge shall be
[41:38] increased.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just ask the Lord that he
[41:42] would bless this word this morning.
[41:43] Father, we just love you, Lord. We thank
[41:44] you for your grace to us, Lord. And
[41:47] Lord, we come into your house with
[41:48] thanksgivings this morning, Father.
[41:50] Thanking you for all you've done for us,
[41:52] Father. You've given us another week,
[41:54] Lord. A a resurrection uh morning, Lord,
[41:57] this morning that we could praise your
[41:58] name, Father. We we know that you're the
[42:00] you're the life in our breath, Lord. And
[42:03] Father, we want to use our breath to
[42:04] just serve you, Lord, and give you
[42:06] thanks and honor and glory for you're
[42:08] worthy of it this morning, Father. And
[42:10] Lord, we just ask that as as we enter
[42:12] into your word, Lord, that you would
[42:13] just break open the bread to us this
[42:15] morning, Lord. That you'd bring, Lord,
[42:17] anointing and power behind it, Father,
[42:19] that Lord, you would loose the captive,
[42:20] that you would bind up the
[42:21] brokenhearted, Father. Lord, that you
[42:23] would give sight to the blind, Lord, and
[42:25] liberty to those that are bound this
[42:28] morning, Father. For your word is the
[42:29] only thing that can restore us, Father.
[42:31] Your your word is the only thing that
[42:33] has power in our lives, Father. And
[42:36] Lord, we recognize as men and women this
[42:38] morning, there's no thing we could do
[42:39] within ourselves to help to help our
[42:42] situations. But Lord, it would take you,
[42:43] Lord. It would take the divine person of
[42:46] the word to come amongst us, Lord. And
[42:48] Father, to bring us out of our
[42:50] situations of life, Lord, to bring
[42:52] healing, Lord, and Lord, to bring a
[42:54] revelation to our hearts that might set
[42:56] us, Lord, for a direction, a victory
[42:58] this morning, Lord. Father, we just
[43:00] thank you that you sent a word in this
[43:01] age, Lord, that was addressed so
[43:03] personally to your bride, Father, that
[43:05] we could look beyond just the the ink on
[43:08] the pages, Lord, but we could see a
[43:10] letter of love that you sent to us in
[43:12] this age, Father. Lord, how we thank
[43:14] you, Lord. We just, Lord, that you'd
[43:16] move across every need, Father. Lord,
[43:18] questions on the hearts of your
[43:19] children, Lord. And some maybe needing
[43:21] encouragement or healing or Lord,
[43:23] Father, just a direction in life,
[43:25] Father. Lord, we know that we can do
[43:27] nothing, Lord, as a man to say or help,
[43:30] but Lord, we just give our our ourselves
[43:32] to you, Lord.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Father, may you just use us for your
[43:36] glory. We give you all that we are,
[43:37] strength, Lord. May you anoint the the
[43:39] lips that speak and may you anoint the
[43:41] ears that hear this morning. We pray in
[43:43] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be
[43:46] seated.
[43:48] Amen. I don't know if I if I have an
[43:50] exact title, but I if I did, it would
[43:53] probably be something like your name is
[43:55] written in the stars. Your name is
[43:58] written in the stars. And I just want to
[44:00] labor in this thought for a few minutes.
[44:02] I've got a timer going, so I don't want
[44:03] to take all day, but I think this is a
[44:04] lengthy subject, so we're just going to
[44:06] relax and and get into it as the Lord
[44:08] leads. Everybody comfortable this
[44:09] morning? Amen. Amen. And so we find here
[44:12] in Daniel the 12th chapter that he would
[44:14] he would say that to all of them that
[44:16] are written in the book there shall be a
[44:19] deliverance. There shall be something
[44:21] come. And of course we could take this
[44:22] to Revelations 5 and we would find the
[44:25] scene there where John is looking at the
[44:27] chaos of the world and and the disparity
[44:30] of the situation. I believe he was
[44:32] looking more than just uh at that time,
[44:34] you know, at at 75 AD or whatever time
[44:37] it was, but I think he was looking in
[44:38] time ahead at our situation and at our
[44:41] time and saying and seeing the scene of
[44:43] the ages unfold before him. And John
[44:45] wept much because there was no man found
[44:48] worthy to open the book or to loose the
[44:51] seals. And John understood that this
[44:53] book would need to be opened in order
[44:54] for there to be redeeming power come
[44:57] back across this life situation. And
[45:00] John wept because nobody was going to be
[45:01] able to do it. He know that he didn't
[45:03] have that he wasn't capable to do it.
[45:05] And there he was amongst the elders and
[45:07] he was amongst the angels and they
[45:08] weren't able to do it. But it would take
[45:10] one that would come from before the
[45:13] foundation of the world that was
[45:14] spotless and without blame that would
[45:16] have to come and to open that book and
[45:19] to reveal something to John that would
[45:21] change his entire situation. Of course,
[45:23] brother Brandon would teach us that John
[45:25] is a type of the end time bride, right?
[45:28] So we are John in this scripture. So we
[45:30] are in the same situation that John was
[45:32] in in need of redemption, right? We're
[45:35] in in need of a redeemer, in need of a
[45:37] revelation that could come and change
[45:40] our situation. Now nothing nothing so
[45:43] much changed for John in a physical
[45:45] sense. But it was a spiritual revelation
[45:47] that he received that something was on
[45:50] the inside of that sealed book that
[45:53] changed his entire perspective of what
[45:55] was going on. And sometimes that's all
[45:56] we need in life is not necessarily a a
[45:59] lightning bolt to come blast open the
[46:02] prison doors that surround us, but it's
[46:03] an understanding of a revelation of
[46:06] what's already taken place. Because you
[46:08] know, uh, nothing could change for John
[46:10] that had not already been done. The lamb
[46:12] hadn't just been slain, but it had been
[46:14] slain before the foundation of the
[46:16] world. Right? So, Brother Bran would say
[46:18] that Jesus could not heal you if he was
[46:20] here in this suit this morning. He
[46:21] couldn't heal you. If you came to him
[46:23] and said, "I need healing or I need
[46:24] deliverance." He would say, "I can't do
[46:26] it because I've already done it." And
[46:28] nothing could be done done for John
[46:30] because it had already been done. But it
[46:32] took an understanding of a revelation
[46:34] that to be aware of what had been done
[46:37] for John and to accept that that was his
[46:40] name on the book. Right? So there's
[46:42] there's there's there's an acceptance
[46:44] that comes from recognizing that your
[46:46] name is written on this book. And
[46:48] there's a promise that comes when your
[46:50] name is written on this book. And I just
[46:52] want to take a few scriptures and a few
[46:54] thoughts this morning and try to uh help
[46:56] us identify where we are at in this
[46:59] season of time. I I think we should be
[47:01] aware that this day, this scripture is
[47:03] fulfilled in our ears that this is no
[47:06] longer a sealed book. And we read here
[47:08] that Daniel has sealed up the book until
[47:10] the end time. And we don't have to look
[47:12] very far around us to recognize what
[47:14] season and what time we're living in.
[47:16] But this is surely the end times. We see
[47:18] the nominal churches are are crying out
[47:20] for it. The agnostics are crying out for
[47:22] it. This is the end of times. We don't
[47:24] know what tomorrow is going to hold. We
[47:25] don't know the chaos of the world. We
[47:27] don't uh we don't we don't have control
[47:29] about any situations. There's more chaos
[47:31] and uncertainty going on and hearts are
[47:34] being turned back to God and and God is
[47:36] in control of all of this movement. But
[47:38] if I believe if the I if the nominal
[47:40] church world with an unrevelated idea
[47:42] can see that this is the end times then
[47:44] we the end time bride more than anyone
[47:47] ought to be aware of what season we are
[47:50] living in. This is not a time to grow
[47:52] slack on the promises of God or to get
[47:54] distracted with the chaos of the world.
[47:56] But this is a time to dive into the word
[47:59] greater than we ever have before. This
[48:01] is a time to surrender more than we had
[48:04] last year or more than we have last week
[48:06] because this is a time when God is
[48:08] calling those names. And if you hear
[48:10] your name called, there's nothing that
[48:13] can hold you back. There's no
[48:14] distraught. There's no there's no
[48:16] distress. There's no situation. There's
[48:18] no sickness. There's no infirmity.
[48:20] There's no situation that can hold you
[48:22] back when you hear your name is called
[48:24] by some power greater than whatever
[48:26] you're going through. And this is a
[48:28] season when God is calling names. I I I
[48:32] know that we are hearing something
[48:34] higher than we've heard before because
[48:36] God is increasing a revelation in this
[48:38] hour that was greater than it was when
[48:40] we first started. And when we first
[48:42] started out in the Lord, we understood
[48:44] up to a point. But this is a different
[48:46] season. This is a different age. This is
[48:48] a different time. This is the fullness
[48:50] of the manifestation of the sons of God.
[48:53] This is what all the earth has been
[48:54] groaning for. This is what all of time
[48:56] has accumulated for. I know I'm putting
[48:58] a lot of pressure on you and your
[49:00] individual experience, but you were
[49:02] built for it.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; You were sent to this age to to fulfill
[49:06] the promise of the fullness of the
[49:08] manifestations of the sons of God. God
[49:10] didn't just send you into this age and
[49:12] hope that you make it, but he knew that
[49:14] you would fulfill this word. And that's
[49:15] why he sent you here. He did not send
[49:17] you to the dark ages because there was a
[49:19] fulfillment for that age. But he sent
[49:21] you into the fullness of times that you
[49:24] might make the fullness of the
[49:25] manifestation of the sons of God. So I
[49:28] can say it like this. We live in an age
[49:29] of fullness. This is an age of the
[49:32] fullness of the word. We did not come in
[49:34] an age with a closed book. But we came
[49:36] after the book was reopened at the end
[49:39] times. And we are an open book people
[49:41] receiving an open book revelation of
[49:44] this time of deliverance. That's what's
[49:46] promised in Daniel 12. that all of them
[49:48] that are written in that book shall be
[49:50] delivered. Brother Zachary, that
[49:52] encourages us this morning because we
[49:54] know what our story looks like after
[49:56] this. This is not the situation you're
[49:58] going through is not the end of your
[49:59] story.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; The situation you're going through is
[50:03] temporary. Everything that you're
[50:05] fighting this morning is a temporary
[50:07] situation. And when that enemy ceases,
[50:10] you will still be going on. Even the
[50:12] devil himself will have a moment when he
[50:14] he takes his last breath. And when he
[50:17] takes his last breath, you will still be
[50:19] going on in glory. When the devil, the
[50:21] tormentor of all ages, the tormentor of
[50:24] all times, is cast into the lake of fire
[50:26] and he receives his last breath, you
[50:29] will still be singing Amazing Grace over
[50:31] on the shores of glory. Because you are
[50:34] not a temporary being, but you are an
[50:36] eternal star that was put here to
[50:39] overcome him in this age. And how is
[50:41] Satan bound in the age? He's not bound
[50:43] with a log chain, but he's bound with a
[50:45] chain of circumstance because you have
[50:47] decided that you will not allow the
[50:49] devil to work through you. I don't know.
[50:50] Are we in agreement this morning that
[50:52] you are ready to not let the devil work
[50:54] through you anymore? But you want to say
[50:56] enough, devil. I've had enough of your
[50:58] thoughts. I've had enough of your
[51:00] tormenting, but I want to let the
[51:02] promises of God be in my mouth. Yay and
[51:04] amen. I don't want to I don't want to a
[51:07] downtrodd in testimony. I don't want to
[51:08] downtroter communion with God, but I
[51:11] want to say victory this morning. I want
[51:13] to see the promises that God has given
[51:15] to the age. Now, we understand that
[51:17] there are trials that will come, but the
[51:19] trial is only temporary.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Don't get caught up in the test cuz the
[51:24] test is only temporary. The reward is
[51:27] coming. The reward comes after the trial
[51:30] and after the test, right? But you've
[51:32] got to understand that what you're going
[51:33] through, it's just a season and time.
[51:35] But if we look towards the end of the
[51:37] book, we shouldn't be sad this morning.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; We know who wins. We know who wins the
[51:43] battle. We know how this ends. The devil
[51:45] is defeated and the bride church marches
[51:48] on into victory. That's you this
[51:49] morning. You're the winner. You're the
[51:51] overcomer. You're the victor because you
[51:53] are found in Christ at the end time.
[51:56] Right? That's where we're living at.
[51:57] Matthew the 20th chapter, a familiar
[52:00] passage of scripture to us, the 20th
[52:02] verse. Then came to him the mother of
[52:04] Zebed's children with her sons
[52:05] worshiping him and desiring a certain
[52:07] thing. Somebody say certain thing.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Certain.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; She knew what she was asking for, right?
[52:13] And he said unto her, "What wilt thou?"
[52:14] And she said unto him, "Grant that these
[52:16] my two sons may sit the one on the right
[52:19] hand and the other on the left in thy
[52:21] kingdom." And Jesus answered and said,
[52:22] "You know not what you ask. You are able
[52:24] to drink of this cup and and and that I
[52:27] shall drink of and be baptized with the
[52:28] baptism that I am baptized with." They
[52:30] say unto him, "We are able." And he
[52:33] said, he said unto them, "Ye shall drink
[52:35] a deed of my cup and be baptized with
[52:36] the baptism that I'm baptized with, but
[52:38] to sit on my right hand and on my left
[52:41] is not mine to give."
[52:43] &gt;&gt; I thought Jesus could do everything.
[52:46] But it wasn't his to give.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; But it shall be given to them. Somebody
[52:51] say them.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; So it's more than one. It's a group
[52:56] &gt;&gt; to them for whom it is prepared of my
[53:00] father. So there's somebody coming in
[53:02] the future that are not yet at this
[53:04] time. But he says when they come that
[53:07] seat is reserved for them.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; There's something reserved for them. Now
[53:11] she knew what she was asking. She was
[53:12] asking of a certain thing. This woman
[53:14] was not just asking that her sons would
[53:16] have a title, but she was actually
[53:18] asking a reference to Psalms 11:0, 'The
[53:20] Lord said unto my Lord, sit thou at my
[53:23] right hand until I make thine enemies
[53:25] thy foottool. The Lord shall send the
[53:28] rod of thy strength out of Zion, rule
[53:30] thou in the midst of thine enemies. Thy
[53:32] people shall be willing in the day of
[53:34] thy power, in the beauty of holiness
[53:36] from the womb of the morning. Thou hast
[53:38] the dw of thy youth. The Lord hath sworn
[53:40] and will not repent. Thou art a priest
[53:43] forever after the order of Melzdc. The
[53:46] Lord at thy right hand shall strike
[53:48] through kings in the day of his wrath.
[53:51] So she knew what she was asking for. She
[53:53] was asking for dominion over every
[53:55] spirit on the earth. And Jesus replies
[53:57] to her that position is not yet
[53:59] available.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; It has not yet been time to fulfill the
[54:02] position where you can tread over every
[54:04] serpent, every spirit. A revelation to
[54:07] understand that you are an overcomer
[54:08] through every trial and every age. He
[54:10] said, "It's a worthy question to ask,
[54:12] but it's not mine to give yet because
[54:14] they are not here yet."
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Those people that will fill that seat
[54:19] are not here yet. It's reserved. It's
[54:21] kind of like when you go somewhere and
[54:23] you're saving a seat for somebody and
[54:25] somebody wants to sit there next to you
[54:26] and you say, "You can't sit there. You
[54:28] can't sit there. This spot is saved.
[54:30] It's got somebody else's name on it."
[54:32] And it might get down to the end of the
[54:34] event. You might get down to where the
[54:36] waiter keeps coming back and he keeps
[54:37] asking, "Are you ready to order? Are you
[54:39] ready to order?" No, there's the seat
[54:41] here that's got somebody's name on it
[54:43] and it's reserved for that person. And
[54:45] until that person comes, no one else can
[54:48] sit in that seat. And let me tell you
[54:49] this morning, church, you have a
[54:51] reservation for a seat that nobody else
[54:54] could fill, that nobody else could take.
[54:56] It's got your name on it, and no other
[54:58] age could fill that spot. But it had to
[55:01] wait until the right time when you could
[55:03] come, when you would show up on the
[55:06] scene. You might think, well, you're
[55:07] pretty insignificant in this great plan
[55:08] of God. But God thought so much of you
[55:11] that he would put your name on not just
[55:13] a seat, but on his seat, on his right
[55:17] hand, that he would save a place for you
[55:20] at the end time that you could come and
[55:22] fulfill all righteousness with him. For
[55:25] it becometh us, somebody say us, to
[55:27] fulfill all righteousness because we're
[55:30] under the same banner of his name. We're
[55:32] found underneath the headship of his
[55:35] name. Have you ever thought about this
[55:36] friends this morning that you were born
[55:38] for such a time as this?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; This is not just a time you were cast in
[55:44] here. Your mom and dad didn't have
[55:46] nothing to do with this. But God
[55:48] Almighty before the foundation of the
[55:50] world saw that your soul would be in
[55:52] this moment of time because he had made
[55:55] a position for you. Before you ever were
[55:58] your daddy ever was born, you already
[56:00] had a position. Before your grandpa ever
[56:02] took his first breath, you already had a
[56:05] position. And God didn't just cast you
[56:07] here by a random thought. But God knows
[56:09] the thoughts that he thinks towards you.
[56:11] And he placed you in the exact moment in
[56:13] time where you would overcome the trial
[56:16] of your life. Now, this is the reward,
[56:18] right? Don't get caught up on the trial.
[56:20] Look for the reward.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; That's what's promised to us is there's
[56:24] a reward coming if you can hold on. To
[56:27] them that overcome will I grant to sit
[56:29] with me on my throne. Is that what
[56:32] Revelations 3 says? I don't think we
[56:34] need to to turn to it, but you know the
[56:35] reference, right? We'll just read what
[56:36] brother Brandham said. Now, in Leodysia,
[56:38] the last church age, there's going to be
[56:40] some overcomers in there.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; There's going to be some overcomers.
[56:46] They remember I'm sorry if I'm moving
[56:47] fast. I just got a lot of material, so I
[56:49] hope we're okay. They remember each
[56:51] church age the the the one preaching it
[56:54] inherits all the other ones offered. Now
[56:57] here it's after they done received all
[56:59] these powers, these new names and
[57:00] everything written that he promised and
[57:02] eat the hidden mana all down through.
[57:05] Watch this last church age. Revelations
[57:06] 3:21. To him that overcomemeth will I
[57:09] grant to sit with me in my throne, even
[57:12] as I also overcome, and am set down with
[57:15] my father in his throne. He that hath an
[57:18] ear, let him hear. what the spirit is
[57:21] saying to the churches. Do you have an
[57:22] ear to hear this morning?
[57:25] &gt;&gt; There's a reward. I like this. This is a
[57:26] fridge quote. There's a reward for
[57:29] overcomers.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Press on, Lily. If it's in you, lay
[57:32] aside the mud and everything else and
[57:34] press towards the top. Yes, sir. To sit
[57:37] with me on my throne. There's a reward
[57:40] for the overcomers. Now, watch this.
[57:42] This this mother of Zebedee he's
[57:44] referencing. But watch that place Jesus
[57:46] said was predestinated. This position
[57:48] was not yet in existence at that time.
[57:50] So the position didn't even exist that
[57:52] she was asking for. Wasn't in creation
[57:55] yet. It wasn't there. It wasn't in it
[57:57] wasn't in that plan yet. The one that
[57:59] sat at the right hand and the other
[58:01] closest to him was yet an overcomer.
[58:04] See, I don't grant this. I can't grant
[58:06] this. But it will be given after the
[58:08] trial comes. How many knows we're in a
[58:10] trial today? After the trial comes. See,
[58:13] I can't give this. that after the trial
[58:15] comes, they'll sit on the right hand and
[58:17] on the left. There's a predestinated
[58:19] seed waiting out yonder for that. And it
[58:22] will be given to the ones that it's
[58:24] promised to, it will be given there. But
[58:26] the test has not yet come. He hasn't
[58:29] come yet. He hasn't overcome yet. See,
[58:32] the person that was to take this place
[58:34] on one side and the other, take it to
[58:36] the other side next to him in the
[58:37] kingdom, it wasn't yet given. He hadn't
[58:40] overcome. The test hadn't fell yet. It
[58:43] will fall in the future. This is in 1963
[58:46] in August. If we suffer for Christ in
[58:48] his word, we will reign with him for he
[58:51] is the word. Remember, if we suffer with
[58:52] him and his word, you can pick this up
[58:54] in 1965. And brother Brandham says the
[58:57] test is on. So now the trial has come.
[59:00] The trial is on. So there was a time
[59:02] when the trial had not yet come and then
[59:04] there was a time when the trial came. So
[59:06] there could be an overcomer. So think it
[59:08] not odd that you're going through these
[59:09] fiery trials, but you must be an
[59:11] overcomer to fulfill all righteousness
[59:14] with Christ. So there's got to be a
[59:16] trial to overcome, friend. There's got
[59:18] to be a situation that you've got to get
[59:20] over, friend. But at the end of the
[59:21] book, you're over the trial. So don't
[59:24] get discouraged in the middle of the
[59:25] trial because that's not your position.
[59:27] It's not a trial taker. It's an
[59:29] overcomer. You're not just going through
[59:30] the test to be tested. You're going
[59:32] through the test to be an overcomer. You
[59:34] don't just take a test so that you can
[59:35] try out your skills. You take a test so
[59:37] that you can get the degree that comes
[59:39] after the test, right?
[59:42] &gt;&gt; You're not going through high school
[59:43] just to go through it, but you're
[59:44] looking for that diploma that comes at
[59:46] the end of it, right? You're looking for
[59:48] the reward that comes after the trial.
[59:51] You're not going to college just so you
[59:52] can you can fill the time up and you can
[59:54] just, you know, use your good years away
[59:57] in school, but you're looking for that
[59:59] diploma that comes at the end of that
[1:00:01] trial. Right? We're not going through
[1:00:03] Leodysia just to go through Leodysia,
[1:00:05] but we're go we're looking for the
[1:00:07] reward that comes after this. We are an
[1:00:10] overcomer of this age. Now, we're not
[1:00:12] just overcoming this age so that so that
[1:00:14] we can we can say, "Yeah, we did it."
[1:00:16] But God is showing his character through
[1:00:18] you in this age.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we got a foundation. I'm
[1:00:22] just going to preach now. Is that all
[1:00:23] right?
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:31] I thank God that we're not here just
[1:00:32] taking a test to take a test.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; He's not just making us go through this
[1:00:36] just so we have something to do. But
[1:00:38] there is a fulfillment that has to come
[1:00:40] in the trial of your life is so that you
[1:00:42] will be victorious through Christ at the
[1:00:45] end of this and his reputation will show
[1:00:47] through in your life. You know that God
[1:00:48] himself put his reputation on the
[1:00:51] shoulders of this bride in this age that
[1:00:53] she would be an overcomer. So that means
[1:00:56] that God has put all that he is on you.
[1:00:59] All that he was, he put in Christ. And
[1:01:01] all that Christ was, he put in the
[1:01:02] church in this end time. So you cannot
[1:01:05] fail with the banner of Christ over you.
[1:01:07] Brother says, "You just can't lose when
[1:01:09] you become a real Christian. You just
[1:01:11] cannot lose because all that Christ was,
[1:01:14] who has never been defeated, who has
[1:01:16] never lost a battle, who has never had
[1:01:18] to retreat, who has never had to back
[1:01:20] up, has put his reputation on you, the
[1:01:24] bride, in this last age. And he will not
[1:01:26] lose this battle, but he will be
[1:01:28] victorious again. And all of his
[1:01:31] confidence is in you. You know that God
[1:01:33] had confidence in you to put you in this
[1:01:35] age, to send you into this time, to send
[1:01:38] you into this trial, that God had to put
[1:01:40] his reputation on the line for you. For
[1:01:42] whose name are we under but his name?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Whose name do we pray in but his name?
[1:01:47] Whose name do we come down this
[1:01:48] dispensation? But his name is over you.
[1:01:51] So he's put his name on you. He's signed
[1:01:53] that you're you're under his watch.
[1:01:55] You're carrying his reputation. You're
[1:01:58] carrying all and you think he's going to
[1:01:59] lose this battle. He will not lose this
[1:02:01] battle. Now, in life, maybe nobody in
[1:02:03] this natural life ever put their money
[1:02:05] on you to win. Maybe nobody ever picked
[1:02:07] you to be the winner. Maybe never ever
[1:02:09] picked you to win the tournament. But
[1:02:11] God almighty picked you because he saw a
[1:02:13] value in you that he put there before
[1:02:15] the foundation of the world, a seed that
[1:02:18] would not die. And even if the world
[1:02:20] forsook you, God still picked you. God
[1:02:23] still sent you to this age because he
[1:02:25] knew that you would overcome because
[1:02:27] it's the law of the seed in you that
[1:02:30] cannot fail. It cannot retreat. It
[1:02:32] cannot turn around. You cannot give up
[1:02:34] on this word. Because greater is he that
[1:02:36] is in you than he that is in the world.
[1:02:39] It's already a finished work in God's
[1:02:41] mind. You're just walking through the
[1:02:42] motion of the trial. He already has the
[1:02:45] reward waiting for you. There's already
[1:02:47] a position waiting for you. Now, what
[1:02:49] this lady asked for for her sons, that
[1:02:51] they could sit at his right hand, was to
[1:02:53] have power over the enemy, to make your
[1:02:56] enemies your foottool. Right? That's
[1:02:57] what she was asking for. You know what
[1:02:59] that word foottool means in the original
[1:03:00] Hebrew is something to trample on.
[1:03:04] She was asking that her sons could have
[1:03:06] something to trample on, the devil, the
[1:03:09] trial of our age, that they could have a
[1:03:11] right to trample on the devil. He said,
[1:03:13] "This time has not yet come, but it's
[1:03:16] coming. There's coming a people who have
[1:03:19] a right to trample over every serpent,
[1:03:22] over every demon power, over every
[1:03:24] depression, over every fear, over every
[1:03:26] anxious spirit. There is coming a people
[1:03:29] and now is, I believe, that have the
[1:03:32] authority to make their enemies their
[1:03:34] foottool. This position was safe for you
[1:03:37] right now. This is your calling. You
[1:03:40] were born for such a time as this that
[1:03:42] you would manifest the fullness of the
[1:03:45] promises of God to make your enemies
[1:03:48] your foottool. I say, "Praise the Lord
[1:03:50] today because I am not defeated. I am
[1:03:52] not I am not destroyed. Yes, I've been
[1:03:55] hit. Yes, I've been cast down, but I am
[1:03:57] not defeated because God has given me a
[1:04:00] position that I can rise on his right
[1:04:02] hand of power." This is the greatest
[1:04:05] call of any age. And I am living in the
[1:04:08] moment. I recognize that this is not
[1:04:10] just a time passing by, but this is my
[1:04:13] position. I was born for this cause.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; For this cause were you born. You were
[1:04:19] not born just to be a a an occupation
[1:04:22] that you hold, but you were born to
[1:04:24] fulfill the manifestation of the word of
[1:04:27] God in this age. That you could
[1:04:28] overthrow the kingdom of the devil.
[1:04:30] Hallelujah. That you could be victorious
[1:04:33] in every situation. He did not come to
[1:04:35] build a great organization. He came to
[1:04:38] build individuals that recognize their
[1:04:41] name on the book of life. Right? That's
[1:04:43] what he said. We're not building an
[1:04:44] organization. I'm not here this morning
[1:04:46] to build an organization. Christ never
[1:04:48] sent me to build an organization. Christ
[1:04:49] sent me to build individuals into the
[1:04:52] stature of Jesus Christ that they might
[1:04:55] be the powerhouse and the dwelling place
[1:04:58] of the spirit by his word. By his word,
[1:05:01] the individual takes that place. So, how
[1:05:04] are we moving into this position? by his
[1:05:06] word.
[1:05:07] Now, I recognize that the spirit of
[1:05:09] condemnation would like to attack us
[1:05:11] right now and tell us that there's no
[1:05:12] way we could ever fulfill this position.
[1:05:14] But what would the devil know about our
[1:05:16] position? Because the message came to
[1:05:19] identify what our position is in this
[1:05:21] age. And at the same time, it also
[1:05:23] identified what the devil's position is
[1:05:25] in this age. And the devil has always
[1:05:27] wanted your position. He has always
[1:05:29] wanted to be you. We was always wanted
[1:05:31] to be in the in the place that you're
[1:05:33] standing, but it was never his to have.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; I would just like to identify to the
[1:05:38] devil what his position is this morning.
[1:05:40] I recognize what my position is. And by
[1:05:42] that, it tells me what his position is.
[1:05:44] It's under my feet. It's underneath us.
[1:05:47] You know, on Lucifer's best day, you're
[1:05:50] still over him.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Who has more authority in heaven? An
[1:05:55] angel or a son of God?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; A son of God.
[1:06:00] So even if iniquity was never found in
[1:06:03] Lucifer, if he had never fallen from
[1:06:05] heaven, you would still be over him.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; You would still have more authority than
[1:06:10] him. You would still be over the top of
[1:06:11] him. And he can't stand the thought that
[1:06:14] a fallen a a fallen son or daughter of
[1:06:17] God could have more authority than him.
[1:06:19] So that's why he tries to rob you from
[1:06:21] your position to point out every fault
[1:06:23] you've ever had, every mistake you've
[1:06:25] ever made. But he doesn't understand the
[1:06:27] plan of redemption nor the pathway of
[1:06:29] repentance cuz it's not in him to
[1:06:32] repent. There is no place in there for
[1:06:34] him to repent. But there is in you.
[1:06:36] There is a place in you that you can
[1:06:38] call upon the Lord and they that call
[1:06:41] upon the Lord shall be saved. For the
[1:06:44] name of the Lord is a mighty strong
[1:06:46] tower and the righteous run into it and
[1:06:48] they are saved. Blessed be the name of
[1:06:52] the Lord. The devil doesn't know
[1:06:53] anything about the position that you're
[1:06:55] holding this morning. He would like to
[1:06:56] tell you that you are not going to take
[1:06:58] that spot, but everything he's telling
[1:07:00] you is what's going to happen to him.
[1:07:02] Watch the pattern of the scripture. He's
[1:07:04] a prophet, all right? But he's a false
[1:07:05] prophet. He told David how he was going
[1:07:08] to die, right? He said, David, today the
[1:07:10] dogs will lick your blood. You'll fall
[1:07:11] this way and that way. He Jezebel also
[1:07:14] told Elijah the same thing. And exactly
[1:07:16] what the devil pronounced over them is
[1:07:18] how the devil died.
[1:07:22] So the devil's telling us this morning,
[1:07:24] you're never going to make it. You don't
[1:07:26] have enough faith. You don't have enough
[1:07:28] power. You don't have enough courage in
[1:07:30] the word. You don't have enough
[1:07:31] understanding. You don't have enough
[1:07:32] revelation. Everything the devil's
[1:07:34] telling you is exactly the position that
[1:07:36] he is in. He doesn't have enough
[1:07:38] revelation. He doesn't have enough
[1:07:40] power. He doesn't have enough faith. He
[1:07:42] doesn't have enough understanding of the
[1:07:44] way of the word. But you do because you
[1:07:46] were sent here to be the fulfillment of
[1:07:48] God's promises in this hour. What would
[1:07:51] the devil know about having a victory in
[1:07:53] this age? He's never won. But Jesus has
[1:07:57] always defeated him. Christ has always
[1:07:59] been over him. And Christ will always be
[1:08:02] over the top of him because he will
[1:08:04] never lose. The blood will never lose
[1:08:07] its power. It will always have dominion
[1:08:10] over the devil. It will always have
[1:08:12] authority over the devil. And you will
[1:08:14] always be victorious as long as you're
[1:08:16] under the blood. And when you try to get
[1:08:18] out in your own works, in your own
[1:08:19] mankind, you'll fail every time. But
[1:08:21] under the blood, I'm invincible.
[1:08:24] Underneath this revelated word of the
[1:08:25] hour, I am invincible. Underneath the
[1:08:27] token, I am invincible.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And when she recognizes what she is, she
[1:08:33] will do the greater work. She will be an
[1:08:35] invincible army. How does she stay
[1:08:38] invincible? She's under the token
[1:08:39] message of the age. and it gives her
[1:08:42] invincibility.
[1:08:44] Now, in being invincible doesn't mean
[1:08:46] you can't get hit. You're still going to
[1:08:47] get hit, but whatever hits you is not
[1:08:49] strong enough to take you down
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; because greater is he that's in you.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; It's his life in you. It cannot be
[1:08:56] defeated. I think sometimes that we we
[1:08:58] we uh we we we dumb down the Holy Ghost
[1:09:01] within us that it doesn't have the power
[1:09:03] to overcome.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Well, whose spirit is it in you? That's
[1:09:08] right.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; You believe you have the Holy Ghost. You
[1:09:11] met the Lord. You You have his spirit
[1:09:13] dwelling in you. Then whose spirit is
[1:09:14] that in you? It's the victorious spirit
[1:09:16] of Christ. The one who has never been
[1:09:18] defeated, who has never lost, who has
[1:09:21] never had to rethink what he said. But
[1:09:22] that spirit has always been on top of
[1:09:24] the devil. And it's the literal life of
[1:09:26] Jesus Christ that's now inside the
[1:09:28] believer. And that power has authority
[1:09:31] over every devil.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; And it's the same power in you.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54 would say this. In
[1:09:39] righteousness shalt thou be established.
[1:09:41] Thou shalt be far from oppression. For
[1:09:43] thou shalt not fear from terror. It
[1:09:47] shall not come near thee. Behold, they
[1:09:49] shall surely gather together. He's
[1:09:50] talking about their enemies, but not by
[1:09:52] me. Whosoever shall gather together
[1:09:54] against thee shall fall for thy sake.
[1:09:57] Sometimes you just got to encourage
[1:09:58] yourself in the word, friends. Whoever's
[1:10:01] gathering themselves against you, you
[1:10:02] ever feel like all your enemies have
[1:10:03] gathered against you?
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Feel like everything's going wrong?
[1:10:06] There's no way that that I could get out
[1:10:08] of this situation, but they shall fall
[1:10:10] for thy sake. Behold, I have created the
[1:10:13] smith that bloweth the coals in the fire
[1:10:14] and bringeth forth an instrument for his
[1:10:16] work. And I have created the washer to
[1:10:19] destroy. No weapon.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody say it with me. No weapon that
[1:10:25] is formed against thee shall prosper.
[1:10:27] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:10:29] thee in judgment shall shout condemn.
[1:10:32] This is the heritage of the servants of
[1:10:34] the Lord and their righteousness is of
[1:10:37] me sayeth the Lord. So it's not about
[1:10:39] your righteousness.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; No weapon of condemnation shall win.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; But by his righteousness we will enter
[1:10:49] into the promises of God. You know that
[1:10:51] God knew that we would need we would
[1:10:52] need a way out. Right?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; God knew that we would need a source of
[1:10:57] of deliverance from the weight of the
[1:10:58] sin of this age. That there was no way
[1:11:00] that we could be the perfect lamb in
[1:11:02] this age because there could only be
[1:11:03] one. Right? So, he wasn't looking for us
[1:11:05] to be the perfect example. He already is
[1:11:07] the perfect example. He's not looking
[1:11:09] for us to carry a cross. He already
[1:11:10] carried the cross. But he knew that we
[1:11:13] would need a way out. He knew that we
[1:11:14] would need something that would that
[1:11:16] would take away the sins. Have you ever
[1:11:18] Have you ever heard the phrase the sea
[1:11:20] of God's forgetfulness?
[1:11:23] Where did that come from?
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Who created it?
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Who created the sea of God's
[1:11:30] forgetfulness? God that created the
[1:11:32] heavens and the earth, the cosmos that
[1:11:34] we're on, the the greatest, you know,
[1:11:35] that the earth is covered 70% I think of
[1:11:38] the earth is covered in water.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And you know only only 20% of that water
[1:11:43] has ever been explored. You know that
[1:11:45] man knows more about space than they do
[1:11:47] know about the oceans. that there is 352
[1:11:49] cubic miles of volume of water on this
[1:11:52] earth and they've only explored 20% of
[1:11:56] that.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; That's pretty incredible, friend. Who
[1:11:58] created all that water?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Where'd that come from? You know, when
[1:12:02] Moses was in the wilderness and they
[1:12:03] needed water, they were in a dry
[1:12:05] condition. They were in a spiritually
[1:12:07] dry condition. They were in a physical
[1:12:08] dry condition. Every kind of dry
[1:12:09] condition you could think of. And yet 2
[1:12:11] million people come out of Egypt. And
[1:12:13] you think right after the deliverance
[1:12:14] they'd be so on fire for God that they
[1:12:16] would never cease to worship him. They
[1:12:18] would never cease to praise him. But yet
[1:12:20] they found themselves just a couple
[1:12:21] verses later in the middle of a desert
[1:12:23] wondering where the water was. And yet
[1:12:25] there was a rock there provided for
[1:12:27] them. Now when Moses when Moses struck
[1:12:29] this rock and it brought forth
[1:12:30] everpresent water from the rock, how
[1:12:32] much water was in there?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; So you think about this. Two million
[1:12:37] people. Just the people, right? How many
[1:12:39] gallons of water could a thirsty person
[1:12:41] drink in a day? At least one. Right?
[1:12:42] Right? So, you're talking about 2
[1:12:43] million gallons of water. But then they
[1:12:45] had camels and they had cows. You know
[1:12:47] how much water that a camel drinks in
[1:12:49] one sitting? 35 gallons of water in one
[1:12:52] sitting. You know how much a cow drinks?
[1:12:53] 40 gallons of water in one sitting. And
[1:12:56] they're talking about thirsty, dried out
[1:12:58] cattle. How much water was really coming
[1:12:59] out of that rock? It wasn't just a
[1:13:02] trickle, but when God really opens and
[1:13:04] unseals something, it's really unsealed.
[1:13:06] It's not just a trickle, but it's all
[1:13:08] the way open and unsealed. And when
[1:13:10] Moses spoke to the rock, it unsealed
[1:13:13] itself and water came forth and it gave
[1:13:16] them the strength that they needed to
[1:13:18] overcome in that age. Now, God
[1:13:20] specializes in water, right? Because
[1:13:22] where there's water, there's life. So,
[1:13:24] God created a place that you would have
[1:13:26] somewhere to deposit your sins,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; the sea of his forgetfulness. I don't
[1:13:32] have this. I'm just picking this up
[1:13:33] under inspiration, but I think we can
[1:13:35] turn to Micah. I think it's the seventh
[1:13:36] verse. Are we okay this morning?
[1:13:39] Amen. I just I like when I can I just
[1:13:42] like to punch condemnation in the face.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And I could feel it in the room say,
[1:13:47] "Well, we're not worthy to raise up to
[1:13:49] that position."
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Well, we know that.
[1:13:52] We know that you're not worthy.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Neither am I worthy. But we're serving
[1:13:56] one who's worthy. We didn't come in the
[1:13:58] house of God this morning to worship
[1:13:59] Brother Zachary.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; We didn't sing praises to God because
[1:14:03] the song leader is is is handsome and
[1:14:05] dressed well.
[1:14:06] You're not saying amen to me, the
[1:14:08] preacher. You're not saying amen to
[1:14:10] brother Samuel when he's preaching.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; You're praising somebody much higher
[1:14:14] than that. You're praising somebody
[1:14:16] who's worthy of you. Whether whether you
[1:14:18] are in sync or out of sync or whether
[1:14:20] you're dressed good or whether you're
[1:14:21] dressed bad. It's not about your
[1:14:23] worthiness. It's about his worthiness.
[1:14:25] We didn't come to the house of God to
[1:14:27] say amen to me this morning. We came to
[1:14:29] the house of God because this is a
[1:14:31] divine appointment that God has made. I
[1:14:33] will meet you in there. go to my
[1:14:36] provided place of worship and there I
[1:14:38] have put my name and there I will meet
[1:14:40] you where two or three are gathered in
[1:14:42] my name I will be in the midst thereof.
[1:14:44] So, this is not just a gathering this
[1:14:46] morning where we put on a nice tie and
[1:14:48] we we combed our hair of what's left of
[1:14:49] it. But we knew that we came to this
[1:14:51] place because there was a promise that
[1:14:54] he would meet us in there. And when he
[1:14:57] comes, when he comes in the room,
[1:15:00] deliverance also comes. Healing also
[1:15:03] comes. Revelation also comes. Wherever
[1:15:06] he is, all of his benefits are with him.
[1:15:10] That's why we shouldn't forsake the
[1:15:11] assembling of ourselves together. And
[1:15:13] yes, he also comes on the midweek
[1:15:15] Wednesday nights. Wherever he is
[1:15:17] invited, he comes. I think sometimes we
[1:15:21] just we we take away from the from from
[1:15:23] the mightiness of God. We say, "Well, I
[1:15:25] can't come on a midweek because, you
[1:15:26] know, it's just not as good of a
[1:15:28] service." But I guarantee you, if you
[1:15:30] come with the same anticipation that you
[1:15:32] come to a big meeting, you come on a
[1:15:34] Wednesday night, God will come down with
[1:15:37] great power, great authority, the same
[1:15:40] as he always was. He comes where he's
[1:15:42] invited. He comes where the expectation
[1:15:45] is.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That was for free.
[1:15:52] Oh my,
[1:15:54] I can't find it. But uh but but in
[1:15:56] Micah, it says that there was a place
[1:15:58] created that he would bind our
[1:16:01] iniquities
[1:16:02] and they would be remembered no more.
[1:16:04] And he would create a place to deposit
[1:16:07] those iniquities that they would be cast
[1:16:10] into the sea and remembered no more.
[1:16:14] Hallelujah.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; So you can remember him,
[1:16:19] but he doesn't remember him.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Who is a God liken unto thee that
[1:16:26] pardone iniquity and passeth by the
[1:16:29] transgression of the remnant of his
[1:16:31] heritage? He retainth not his anger
[1:16:33] forever because he delightth in mercy.
[1:16:36] How many knows God delights in mercy?
[1:16:39] He's not a vengeful God. You know, I
[1:16:40] think some sometimes, brother Aaron,
[1:16:42] some of us message folks gets a little
[1:16:43] Catholic. We think God is, you know,
[1:16:45] this big stern.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:16:49] you know, God is love.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The definition of God is love. He's
[1:16:54] grace. He's loving kindness. He's not
[1:16:57] just judgment, but he's grace to the
[1:16:58] bride. What is the commission of
[1:17:00] Zerubbabel? The messenger of this hour.
[1:17:02] Grace, grace, grace. Crying it to the
[1:17:05] church. Right.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Let's not confuse who we are in this
[1:17:08] scenario.
[1:17:10] You're not being judged. You're given
[1:17:11] grace.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Who is like unto thee because he
[1:17:16] delightth in mercy. He will turn again.
[1:17:18] He will have compassion upon us. He will
[1:17:21] subdue our iniquities. And thou will
[1:17:24] cast all their sins. Somebody say all.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; All. all their sins into the depths of
[1:17:31] the sea.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Into the depths of the sea.
[1:17:36] You know, brother Ben, there's a place
[1:17:38] called uh something some something
[1:17:39] trench, right? And it is 37,000 ft and
[1:17:42] change deep. Man will never reach it.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; They will never reach the bottom of that
[1:17:48] place. Why? Because the pressure is too
[1:17:49] great.
[1:17:51] So God created a place when he created
[1:17:53] the world that your iniquities and your
[1:17:56] sins could be cast into the depths of
[1:17:58] the sea and no man would be able to find
[1:18:01] them again. Nobody would be able to get
[1:18:03] that low and that far down that they
[1:18:05] could bring back unto you the
[1:18:07] accusations of your iniquities. But only
[1:18:11] Hallelujah only your memory could trap
[1:18:14] you there. But if you'll let go of the
[1:18:16] iniquities into the depths of the sea
[1:18:18] and say, "I know I'm not worthy, but he
[1:18:21] has made enough water. He has made a
[1:18:24] deep enough sea that I can bury my
[1:18:27] iniquities. I can bury my condemnation.
[1:18:30] I can shake off these heavy rains and I
[1:18:33] can rejoice in the blood that has come
[1:18:36] down for me. It is greater than all my
[1:18:39] sin, greater than all my desperity,
[1:18:42] greater than my situation. is the blood
[1:18:44] that still cleanses me. It reaches from
[1:18:47] sea to sea, from sky to shore. It is the
[1:18:50] blood.
[1:18:52] How can we not rejoice in the blood? We
[1:18:54] know we're not worthy, but the blood is
[1:18:57] worthy. We know that we're not able, but
[1:18:59] the blood has made us able. We are able
[1:19:02] because we're under the choken message
[1:19:05] of Jesus Christ in this age. He has made
[1:19:08] you kings and priests now to reign with
[1:19:11] him on earth by the blood that was shed
[1:19:14] on Calvary. It became a finished work.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; We're not waiting for it. It's already
[1:19:21] come. It's a finished work at Calvary.
[1:19:24] He said washed in the blood. Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You got your swimming clothes on this
[1:19:30] morning. Take a dip in the blood. Take a
[1:19:34] fresh renewal in the blood. washed by
[1:19:36] the water of the word. They are
[1:19:39] cleansed. They are sanctified. They are
[1:19:42] justified as if they never did it in the
[1:19:45] first place.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Every every accusation against you
[1:19:53] has been erased because a greater power
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; a greater power has signed your name.
[1:20:01] Oh, hallelujah. A greater blood than
[1:20:04] your own blood has signed your name. A
[1:20:06] blood that cannot be blotted out. It
[1:20:08] cannot be erased has put his mark over
[1:20:11] your life.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; As if you never did it in the first
[1:20:16] place.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; In the depths of the sea. How deep is
[1:20:21] that? Deeper than you can think.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Deeper than you can go.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Deeper than the devil can reach. There's
[1:20:28] a place that God has created. Why did he
[1:20:32] create it, Aaron? Because he knew you'd
[1:20:33] mess up. He knew that we would need
[1:20:35] somewhere to throw to throw those
[1:20:38] weights, to throw that sin. He knew that
[1:20:40] we would have need of it. So, he's not
[1:20:42] surprised by your inability to keep the
[1:20:45] word.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; He's not surprised by our inability to
[1:20:50] keep every promise. He knew that we
[1:20:52] would stumble. He knew that we would
[1:20:54] fall. But the thing about falling is you
[1:20:56] can't stay down. You've got to get back
[1:20:59] up. You've got to rise back up off the
[1:21:02] ground and recognize who you are and why
[1:21:04] you were put here. You were not put here
[1:21:06] to be defeated. You were put here to be
[1:21:08] victorious. So yes, you're going to
[1:21:10] fall. Yes, life isn't going to work out
[1:21:12] just the way you thought it was. You
[1:21:13] might end up being a Ruth when you
[1:21:15] thought you were going to be an Esther.
[1:21:16] But you were made to be an overcomer.
[1:21:19] You were made to be victorious in every
[1:21:21] situation that God could manifest his
[1:21:24] promised word in this hour. Your
[1:21:26] situation does not change who you are.
[1:21:29] Right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change what you were put here
[1:21:31] for.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't change why you're here. It
[1:21:34] doesn't Aaron, come here real quick.
[1:21:37] Come up here. What's your name?
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Aaron.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Aaron.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Who's your dad?
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Uh Aaron senior.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; I'm borrow this from my pastor a long
[1:21:44] time ago. I heard him do this. All
[1:21:45] right. Fall down right here.
[1:21:49] He's stumbled.
[1:21:51] He's tripped. He's made a mistake.
[1:21:54] Right. All right. Get back up. What's
[1:21:57] your name? Aaron. Who's your dad?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Aaron Senior.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing changed, right? So, even though
[1:22:02] he fell Thank you. Even though he fell,
[1:22:05] it didn't change who he was. He's still
[1:22:08] a son of God. He's still a bloodbought,
[1:22:11] redeem, redeemed son of God. And his
[1:22:13] falling did not change his position.
[1:22:17] The devil cannot take you out of your
[1:22:19] position because greater is he that's in
[1:22:22] you than the devil that would try to
[1:22:24] rock you out of your position because
[1:22:26] you have already been granted to sit
[1:22:29] with him on his throne. And the devil
[1:22:31] can't have it. And the trip doesn't
[1:22:34] change you. The falling doesn't change
[1:22:36] you. You are who you are by the election
[1:22:39] of God.
[1:22:41] A mistake cannot take away your
[1:22:43] election.
[1:22:44] You think, "Well, I've sinned my life
[1:22:46] away." It cannot take away your position
[1:22:49] in Christ. This is who you are. This is
[1:22:53] what you've been called for. This is
[1:22:55] your position in this time. You were
[1:22:58] born for such a time as this.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; He knew there would be mistakes. He knew
[1:23:03] there would be faults. He knew there
[1:23:05] would be failures. And he made a way.
[1:23:08] When there seemed like there wouldn't be
[1:23:09] a way, he made a way. When you couldn't
[1:23:12] see it, he made a way. When your back
[1:23:15] was against the wall, he made a way. Out
[1:23:18] of every circumstance and situation, the
[1:23:20] blood has made a way for you.
[1:23:23] Hallelujah. Friend, we've got so much to
[1:23:26] thank him for, so much to rejoice for
[1:23:28] because he has already provided a
[1:23:31] sacrifice for anything that you have
[1:23:33] done or will do. It's covered under the
[1:23:36] blood.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He knows the beginning from the end.
[1:23:41] He knows every situation of our life. He
[1:23:43] knows everywhere we're going to stumble
[1:23:45] and fall. But I say we we recognize his
[1:23:48] power is greater than whatever we're
[1:23:52] fighting in this age. His grace is
[1:23:54] sufficient for me and my mistakes.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; You think you might have got into the
[1:24:00] permissive will of God, but his power is
[1:24:01] great enough to bring you back into the
[1:24:03] perfect will.
[1:24:05] His power is great enough. that Naomi
[1:24:07] thought that she was maybe in the
[1:24:08] permissive will of God, but God used
[1:24:10] that to bring Ruth into the kingdom of
[1:24:12] God. That Boaz would have a bride. You
[1:24:15] see, it was all the plan of God to begin
[1:24:17] with. Who are we that we are God to
[1:24:19] judge on the throne to say, "Well,
[1:24:20] that's the permissive will." We don't
[1:24:21] know what the permissive will or the
[1:24:23] perfect will of God's. His will is his
[1:24:25] word. And as long as we have his word,
[1:24:27] we stay in the word. Now, if somebody
[1:24:30] makes a mistake, we say, "Get back to
[1:24:31] the word." You've had a detour. Get back
[1:24:34] to the word. You had a mistake. Get back
[1:24:37] to the word. Get back to the place that
[1:24:39] can make it right.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; It does not. The falling does not change
[1:24:44] who you are.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; The prodigal son was always a son. Even
[1:24:49] when he was in the pig pen and he was
[1:24:51] fellowshipping with the pigs and he
[1:24:53] maybe didn't remember who he was, but he
[1:24:55] was always a son. It did not change his
[1:24:57] position, but he always was of his
[1:24:59] father. And there was nobody that could
[1:25:01] take that position from him. And when he
[1:25:04] was done messing around, when he was
[1:25:07] ready to give up that kind of life, when
[1:25:08] he was ready to stop fighting against
[1:25:10] the bricks, he gave in and recognized
[1:25:13] who he always was.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't just become a son.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; He always was that son.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That robe was always his robe.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That feast was always his feast.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; He just had to recognize who he was. God
[1:25:27] knew who he was the whole time.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You're always the son.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody say, "No weapon."
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; No weapon. No weapon of condemnation. No
[1:25:37] weapon of fear. No weapon of anxiety. No
[1:25:39] weapon of whatever they call it. Jesus's
[1:25:41] name is greater. They might call it
[1:25:43] cancer. They may call it diabetes. They
[1:25:44] might call it some disease. Jesus's name
[1:25:47] is above every other name. No weapon
[1:25:50] formed against you shall prosper because
[1:25:52] you have already been promised to be an
[1:25:54] overcomer in this age. If you go down by
[1:25:56] the grave, that grave must obey the
[1:25:59] voice of the resurrection. That dirt has
[1:26:01] to obey. When the voice of the
[1:26:03] resurrection comes to the bride and
[1:26:04] authority, that dust will obey. That
[1:26:07] dust will become subject to the promises
[1:26:09] of God and they will rise. They will
[1:26:12] come up in the resurrection and we shall
[1:26:14] be changed.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; You can't lose, friend. If you go down
[1:26:18] by the grave, you didn't lose. If you
[1:26:20] get raptured, you didn't lose. You
[1:26:21] cannot lose. The devil has already lost.
[1:26:24] You are victorious to Christ who has
[1:26:27] given you power. I hope that's pretty
[1:26:29] clear this morning. You cannot be
[1:26:31] defeated. Whatever you are going through
[1:26:34] will not stop you because you are an
[1:26:36] eternal predestinated seed that has been
[1:26:39] elected for victory in this age.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; That's why I defy the devil that would
[1:26:46] try to take the authority out of the
[1:26:48] message. You ain't never heard this in a
[1:26:50] Baptist church.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You never heard this in the UPC church.
[1:26:53] People try to say we're Pentecostal.
[1:26:55] They been to a Pentecostal church. You
[1:26:56] tell me where a Pentecostal church is
[1:26:58] preaching the son of man revealed in
[1:26:59] this hour and and and and you and and
[1:27:01] then I'll tell you where where we're at,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; but they're not preaching it.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And they try to identify us with
[1:27:08] denominational spirits. No, I refuse to
[1:27:10] be identified with a denominational
[1:27:12] spirit when I have been given a
[1:27:13] vindicated word in this hour. I believe
[1:27:15] we ought to have both sides. I believe
[1:27:17] we ought to rejoice
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; and have an opening of the word. I don't
[1:27:21] think we should be tied down to, well,
[1:27:22] the mysteries are revealed. Let's be
[1:27:24] somber and sober. No, I think we ought
[1:27:25] to rejoice because the book has been
[1:27:27] open to us and the names have been
[1:27:29] revealed in that book and I think we
[1:27:31] ought to be excited about it. I think we
[1:27:33] can have the deep teachings and get
[1:27:35] excited about it. I don't think we need
[1:27:36] to be bound down by some denominational
[1:27:38] idea. Stop confining me to what's your
[1:27:41] idea of a denomination looks like. This
[1:27:43] is the message. I will get excited about
[1:27:46] the message. I will preach the message
[1:27:48] because the message is open to me and it
[1:27:50] has showed me who I am in this age and
[1:27:53] it does something to me. It stimulates
[1:27:56] my revelation to know who I am in this
[1:27:58] age. Don't tell me to be quiet. You
[1:28:01] ought to have been where I was when you
[1:28:03] didn't know who you were.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; But when the voice of identification
[1:28:08] came across my life and told me who I
[1:28:11] always was, you always were a son of
[1:28:14] God. You always were my redeemed bride.
[1:28:16] You always were my love. It It did
[1:28:19] something to me. It changed something on
[1:28:21] the inside of me. I can't help it.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; There's something on the inside. You
[1:28:26] say, "Well, you're just not deep
[1:28:27] enough." No, I understand. The mystery
[1:28:29] has been revealed.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; In this I rejoice
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; because I cannot lose. I do not die, but
[1:28:39] I will live on forever. The message came
[1:28:42] to identify who I am. It placed me
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; positionally under this age.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as
[1:28:53] lightning falling from heaven. Behold, I
[1:28:56] give unto you power to tread on serpents
[1:28:58] and scorpions and over all the power of
[1:29:00] the enemy.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And nothing, somebody say, no weapon.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; That would be enough. That would be
[1:29:14] enough to dance around. That would be
[1:29:16] enough to rejoice because every stinking
[1:29:18] serpent, every scorpion, every menacing
[1:29:22] spirit in this age, you know why he
[1:29:23] called them snakes and scorpions? Cuz
[1:29:24] they have the characteristics of those
[1:29:26] animals. When you lift up a rock, what
[1:29:28] does the scorpion do? It runs for the
[1:29:31] next hiding place. When you expose a
[1:29:33] devil, what does it do? It goes to the
[1:29:35] next hiding place. The characteristics
[1:29:38] of those animals are the spirits that
[1:29:39] he's talking about. But you have
[1:29:41] authority to cast them out and to tread
[1:29:43] over them because greater is he that's
[1:29:45] in you than he that is in that bug.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Notwithstanding in just this, rejoice
[1:29:52] not that the spirits are subject unto
[1:29:54] you, but rather rejoice because
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; nobody else can say this. Nobody else
[1:30:01] can preach this because this is a bride
[1:30:03] scripture. But rejoice because your
[1:30:06] names are written in the book of heaven.
[1:30:09] Nobody else sees that but you John. You
[1:30:12] are John in the book and your name has
[1:30:15] been loosed. Hallelujah. Those seals
[1:30:18] have been loosed over your life and you
[1:30:20] have seen your name written there.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; It means John became fearless in who he
[1:30:27] was because nothing could stop him.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; My name is there.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; You might not see my name, but I see it
[1:30:37] there.
[1:30:38] I see my name written in the lamb's
[1:30:40] blood. Slain before the foundation of
[1:30:42] the world. When he was spotless, without
[1:30:44] blame, without sin. Before I ever
[1:30:47] committed a crime, he signed my name.
[1:30:51] Before I ever forsook his grace, he
[1:30:54] signed my name. Before I ever made a
[1:30:56] mistake, he signed my name. My name is
[1:30:59] older than the crisis that I'm in.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Before Lucifer was ever
[1:31:06] created, he signed my name. Hallelujah.
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; My name is as eternal as God's name cuz
[1:31:14] he wrote it with his own eternal blood.
[1:31:17] And he knew that there would come a
[1:31:18] point in time and it was saved for such
[1:31:20] a time as this that that scroll would be
[1:31:23] loosed.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Seal it up, Daniel, until the end time.
[1:31:28] And at the end time there will be a
[1:31:31] somebody to them who my father has
[1:31:33] prepared. Who's them, friends?
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It's time.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; We're not we're not preaching out of a
[1:31:43] closed book.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; When we find when we find John in
[1:31:46] Revelations, where's the book in what
[1:31:48] position? It's opened.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And I saw in his hand a little book
[1:31:51] open. It's the opening of the word. What
[1:31:54] is the opening of the word? It's not a
[1:31:55] buzz word that gets us excited. It tells
[1:31:57] us that our names have been revealed on
[1:32:00] the lamb's book of life. And it has
[1:32:02] identified us as an overcomer in this
[1:32:04] age. And we as John heard in Revelations
[1:32:07] 4:1 to come out of Leoa and come up
[1:32:11] higher before I have a greater work for
[1:32:13] you to do. Do you hear the call of the
[1:32:15] voice? You hear the call calling those
[1:32:17] names. I have quotes after quote. He's
[1:32:19] calling the name in this age. He's
[1:32:22] calling the bride out of her. Out of
[1:32:24] even I'll say even the message ranks.
[1:32:26] The bride is being called out of her.
[1:32:29] Come out.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Do you hear it? Can you hear the call?
[1:32:34] Can you hear the shout of the king has
[1:32:36] returned to the camp and he has called
[1:32:38] you by name and he has placed you
[1:32:40] positionally over every enemy in this
[1:32:43] life.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; The enemies are as great as they ever
[1:32:49] were. In fact, they're greater than
[1:32:50] they've ever been. All of hell is lifted
[1:32:52] off. We're not waiting for it to happen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Hey, the squeeze is on, friends.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; But the squeeze is a blessing for the
[1:32:58] bride cuz we know who we are.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; For the rest of the world, it's
[1:33:02] destruction. For us, it lifts us cuz
[1:33:05] we're eagles. And the storm just makes
[1:33:07] us go higher and higher and higher.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It's on, friends.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; The move is on for the bride. We're
[1:33:15] moving on up out of condemnation, out of
[1:33:17] laya, out of the world destruction. And
[1:33:19] we're moving up into a rapture
[1:33:22] condition. The rapture is on for the
[1:33:24] bride. Can I say it like that? The
[1:33:26] rapture is already happening.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; You're not going to miss it. This is it.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's revival. And this is
[1:33:34] the age of the bride. This is the time
[1:33:37] to rise out of Leodysia and be not
[1:33:40] partakers of her filth. But you are a
[1:33:43] bride living in another age. No, there's
[1:33:45] not an eighth age, but we are living in
[1:33:47] this age and another age. Does that make
[1:33:49] sense? You can create a world. Let me
[1:33:50] slow down here. You can speak a world.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; And go live on that world.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; You're not going to another planet.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You're rising above Leodysia.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; That you can speak a world and you can
[1:34:05] step into a bride age in the middle of
[1:34:08] Leodysia. You are not affected by
[1:34:10] Leodysia's trial. You are not affected
[1:34:13] by Leodysia's destruction because you
[1:34:15] are not a Leodysian. You are a bride
[1:34:18] member and bride members act like bride
[1:34:20] members. They don't act like le oysian.
[1:34:22] I refuse to be identified with the cold,
[1:34:24] lukewarm, starchy, naked, have need of
[1:34:27] nothing and knoweth not religion. I want
[1:34:29] to be found. I don't want you to ask me
[1:34:31] what I believe. I want you to know that
[1:34:33] I believe we're in an age of the bride,
[1:34:35] an age of the overcomer, an eagle age,
[1:34:38] because we are made more than conquerors
[1:34:40] through Christ who strengthens us in
[1:34:42] this age. The devil is defeated.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:47] I just like to remind him every once in
[1:34:49] a while, this is you and this is me.
[1:34:52] This is you and this is me. This is
[1:34:54] where you belong and I belong at the
[1:34:56] right hand of my father. Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] I've got a reservation. I can't be late.
[1:35:03] I've got my name there on a placard. He
[1:35:05] has called me by name and has revealed
[1:35:07] to me on this side who I am and the
[1:35:10] position that I'll hold there.
[1:35:12] G.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; So that means whatever Leodysia throws
[1:35:15] at me, it's not enough.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; 200,000,000 demons have already been
[1:35:20] unleashed in this age. And and my my my
[1:35:23] opinion is that they're focused on the
[1:35:24] bride.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; You know, Satan sent his best for this
[1:35:30] age. You know, you're waring against the
[1:35:32] greatest demons that there ever have
[1:35:34] been in existence.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a struggle sometimes
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; to overcome. You're not just fighting
[1:35:40] your mind battles. You're fighting
[1:35:41] actual spiritual entities that have been
[1:35:43] sent here to attack you and to defeat
[1:35:45] you if they could.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; But they can't.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Because while the devil sent his best,
[1:35:53] God also sent his best. And the devil
[1:35:55] through the best he had of the church.
[1:35:57] But God in the foundation of his mind
[1:36:00] before there was a trial thought of you
[1:36:02] in this situation and he said, "I'll
[1:36:04] send them to that final age. They are
[1:36:07] the best that I've got." Hallelujah. I
[1:36:10] can run through the wall. You're the
[1:36:11] best that God's got. You're the best.
[1:36:13] The best that God's got in his mind is
[1:36:16] right here in this age. There is nobody
[1:36:18] else that can take your spot. But God
[1:36:21] has sent you here to be an overcomer
[1:36:23] over the greatest adversary, even death
[1:36:26] himself. No other group of people has
[1:36:29] ever obtained that until this time.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You're the best.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may not feel like it
[1:36:37] tomorrow morning, but I want you to look
[1:36:39] in the mirror and say, "No matter what
[1:36:40] my symptoms are, I'm the best.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I'm the best that God's got."
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; You know what it'll do to make you carry
[1:36:48] yourself different? And where the devil
[1:36:50] used to trip you up with some easy
[1:36:52] little scheme, you'll recognize I'm the
[1:36:54] best.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to fall for this scheme.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; How do you think we get to that
[1:36:59] scripture fulfilled where is this the
[1:37:00] man?
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Is this the man that tripped up the
[1:37:04] ages? Is this the Lucifer that caused
[1:37:07] all the sin? This is the man,
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; this puny little being standing before
[1:37:13] me. This is the man of destruction. This
[1:37:15] is the man of wrath. How do we get to
[1:37:18] that position? We recognize that we are
[1:37:20] elected to be over him. And there's no
[1:37:23] trick of the devil that can stop us.
[1:37:25] Yes, he can slow us down, but he will
[1:37:27] not stop us.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; He can distract us, but he will not stop
[1:37:31] us. Goliath could have never killed
[1:37:34] Israel because they were already
[1:37:35] commissioned to win.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; But you know what he did? He distracted
[1:37:38] them.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He stood in their way.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; He couldn't kill them, Zach.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; But he could stand in their way. It's a
[1:37:46] big bluff.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Who will come out and fight me? You ever
[1:37:51] heard the challenge of the devil? Who
[1:37:53] will come out? You. I know all your
[1:37:55] mistakes. It's not going to be you.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; See how the devil works. But it took one
[1:38:00] that knew he was anointed for the
[1:38:02] position.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; He already knew he had an appointment
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; because when the prophet anointed him to
[1:38:11] be king, he knew that he would have to
[1:38:14] fulfill that appointment. And there was
[1:38:15] no Goliath, there was no cancer, there
[1:38:18] was no diabetes, there was no
[1:38:19] depression, there was no nervous spirit
[1:38:21] that could stop him from fulfilling that
[1:38:23] position because he had already been
[1:38:25] anointed to be king. So therefore,
[1:38:27] nothing that the devil threw at him
[1:38:29] could stop him from coming to his
[1:38:31] rightful position. I want to announce to
[1:38:33] you today, church, you have already had
[1:38:35] an appointment to sit with him on his
[1:38:38] throne. And there's nothing the devil
[1:38:40] can do to stop it. He cannot stop what
[1:38:43] God has already set in motion. And God
[1:38:46] has already put the bride on the move in
[1:38:48] this age. You will not be defeated.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; It's not my words. This is the Bible.
[1:38:56] This is a words way greater than any man
[1:38:59] has ever spoken. And these words are way
[1:39:01] greater than any tempter of this age.
[1:39:03] These words are eternal.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; You cannot be defeated.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; The devil is under your feet
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; and you're rejoicing because it's been
[1:39:15] revealed to you that your names
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; This day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:39:22] your ears. Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Have you heard your name?
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Have you heard the role is called? We're
[1:39:27] not waiting up there. The bride ain't
[1:39:29] waiting to go up there to hear the role
[1:39:30] called.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; She's hearing it right now on the earth.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; When the role is called, I will answer.
[1:39:36] When he calls for me, I will hear him.
[1:39:39] Hear what the spirit is saying to the
[1:39:41] church.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Take the devil out your hearing.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; I I my timer's up. I'm going to deal
[1:39:47] with this for just a minute. That's
[1:39:48] okay. Are we okay?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] Every time brother Brandham talks about
[1:39:53] a a a deaf spirit or a spirit of
[1:39:56] blindness, he talks about something
[1:39:57] gripping the nerve, right? You go study
[1:39:59] in the message your own time. I got lots
[1:40:00] of quotes on it, but your message
[1:40:02] studiers. And so he he he explains how
[1:40:05] this spirit grips. He says it's like a
[1:40:06] transparent band, right? That grips
[1:40:08] around the hearing nerve of of that
[1:40:12] individual. And when he's praying for
[1:40:13] that individual, he always speaks to the
[1:40:15] spirit that's holding the nerve. And he
[1:40:17] says, "Let go of their nerve." And as
[1:40:18] that thing lets go of the nerve, then it
[1:40:21] releases that hearing back to the
[1:40:22] individual. Right?
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Something changes when the devil lets
[1:40:28] go.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Something changes in your hearing when
[1:40:31] the devil has to let go. You remember in
[1:40:33] Acts the 16th chapter, I don't have the
[1:40:35] time to read all this, but in Acts the
[1:40:36] 16th chapter when when when Paul and
[1:40:39] Silas are on their road and they've
[1:40:40] converted Lydia and they've opened the
[1:40:41] word unto Lydia and then they run across
[1:40:43] just a few verses later, they run across
[1:40:45] this damsel who's who's a diver. Right.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; She's she's she's actually making money
[1:40:50] for the denominations, if I can say it
[1:40:52] like that, using a prophetic gift.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Right. Well, the Bible says she was
[1:40:56] possessed with the spirit of divination.
[1:40:59] So you take that word divination back to
[1:41:00] the Greek originally and it means a
[1:41:02] python.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You might think, well you going with
[1:41:05] this? Because the character of a spirit,
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; right? He didn't just call them snakes
[1:41:10] for no reason. But their characteristics
[1:41:12] define what they do. And this spirit of
[1:41:15] false prophecy was constricting the
[1:41:17] hearing of the church and it had wrapped
[1:41:19] itself around the hearing nerve of the
[1:41:21] church and had strangled out the life of
[1:41:23] it. Like brother Bam says, a transparent
[1:41:25] band almost like you put it if you put a
[1:41:27] if you put a rubber band on my hand and
[1:41:28] you put it real tight. It's not going to
[1:41:30] take very long for these fingers to go
[1:41:31] purple and them to go numb because why?
[1:41:33] The blood is not getting to them. The
[1:41:35] life is not getting to the source,
[1:41:37] right? It's not completing the cycle.
[1:41:39] And it's just like that in the hearing
[1:41:40] of a of a person. If that constriction
[1:41:42] is around the hearing canal, they'll
[1:41:44] never understand what the spirit is
[1:41:46] saying to the church.
[1:41:49] But in this age, you have been given
[1:41:51] power over serpents and over spirits and
[1:41:54] over everything that would defy the move
[1:41:56] of the bride. It's time to release the
[1:41:59] uncction of the Holy Ghost over that
[1:42:01] situation and say, "Python, you have no
[1:42:04] hold over my hearing. Condemnation, you
[1:42:06] have no hold over my revelation, but I
[1:42:09] have heard my name. I have heard the
[1:42:11] shout. I have heard the victorious reign
[1:42:13] of the king has come back. and I will
[1:42:16] not listen to you anymore. There has
[1:42:18] never been a better time to hear what
[1:42:20] the spirit is saying to the churches. I
[1:42:23] don't believe that the word has
[1:42:24] decreased at all. But I think these work
[1:42:27] saying greater shall ye do because
[1:42:29] there's more of you receiving the hidden
[1:42:31] mana, receiving the opening of the word.
[1:42:34] It's no longer one man, but it's a many
[1:42:36] membered bride body. Hallelujah.
[1:42:39] Hallelujah. You were not called to a
[1:42:41] funeral, friend. Nor were you called to
[1:42:43] a frolic. You were called to a feast, a
[1:42:46] feast with Christ. And you are not
[1:42:48] feeding on the words of a man cuz they
[1:42:50] will fail. You are feeding on the body
[1:42:52] word, son of man, cuz it will never
[1:42:55] fail. This word is a feast with Christ.
[1:42:58] And as long as you're eating at this
[1:43:00] table, you cannot be defeated.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; You cannot lose because your name has
[1:43:07] already been revealed to you.
[1:43:09] Hallelujah. When Lucifer preached his
[1:43:12] magnificent, eloquent,
[1:43:15] I don't know the words. I'm not smart
[1:43:16] enough
[1:43:18] theological,
[1:43:20] glorious looking intellectual sermon in
[1:43:23] heaven.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; And all of those stars fell.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; You know, there were stars that did not
[1:43:30] fall.
[1:43:33] There were stars that didn't fall for
[1:43:34] that intellectual sermon cuz they
[1:43:37] already had their names written down
[1:43:38] somewhere and they couldn't fall to
[1:43:40] Lucifer's schemes. I want to tell you
[1:43:42] this morning, church, where were you?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Where were you when the sons of God
[1:43:48] shouted for joy and the morning stars
[1:43:50] sang for glory? I was there. You were
[1:43:53] there. And the devil can't do anything
[1:43:55] about it. He already tried it and it
[1:43:58] didn't work. I stay with the word and
[1:44:00] I'll always stay with the word. I will
[1:44:03] not fall because I have been elected to
[1:44:06] see in this age and to hear what the
[1:44:08] spirit is saying to me. Come up higher.
[1:44:11] Come up higher.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; As we as we close down here, you know
[1:44:16] what that word loose means? To open the
[1:44:18] seals, to loose. It means to call to
[1:44:21] come higher.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; It means to call to come up out of that.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Come off of just paper. Come off of just
[1:44:28] ink. but become a life living written
[1:44:31] epistles written in read of all men.
[1:44:33] There has never been a better time to
[1:44:35] witness this message than right now.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I say we become bold. The devil has
[1:44:40] backed up the church too far in the
[1:44:42] corner. Well, they're just going to
[1:44:43] Google this. They're going to Google
[1:44:44] that. Let them Google it, but let the
[1:44:45] seed hear the word. Let the elect hear
[1:44:48] the word of God, and they can choose
[1:44:50] what they want to do with it. But I will
[1:44:52] not be found guilty for withholding
[1:44:53] something, something this powerful.
[1:44:56] Everyone I talk to, I want to let know
[1:44:58] this is the eternal word of God. This is
[1:45:01] the season of a rapture. This is the
[1:45:03] season of a body change. This is the
[1:45:05] season of deliverance. You don't have to
[1:45:07] stay where you are, but there is a
[1:45:09] greater word that has come down in this
[1:45:11] hour.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Just a few months ago, Brother Diego and
[1:45:18] I were in Mexico at Easter time,
[1:45:20] actually. And there was a there was an
[1:45:22] older lady that came up for prayer. She
[1:45:24] was 78 years old, I think, the pastor's
[1:45:26] mother-in-law. And they they she came
[1:45:29] through the prayer line and and and they
[1:45:31] got our attention and called us to her
[1:45:33] and said, "This this sister is deaf.
[1:45:35] She's been deaf since she was six." I
[1:45:38] thought 70ome years has gone by and
[1:45:41] she's been deaf. I didn't find this out
[1:45:43] till later, but the pastor told me that
[1:45:45] when she was a young child, she got some
[1:45:46] kind of sickness and she got so hot
[1:45:49] internally that it bursted her her her
[1:45:51] vessels and her eardrums. So she
[1:45:53] actually didn't have the parts that it
[1:45:55] took to form an eardrum. They were gone.
[1:45:57] They had bursted. And she had gone 70s
[1:46:00] something years living in Mexico with no
[1:46:03] hearing.
[1:46:05] But that Easter night,
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; the Lord restored right there instantly.
[1:46:09] I watched an instant miracle happen. And
[1:46:11] her hearing come back to her and she
[1:46:13] heard everything we were saying. She
[1:46:14] started rejoicing. She started praising
[1:46:15] the Lord and her her children started re
[1:46:18] weeping and rejoicing and rejoicing what
[1:46:20] the Lord had done. And I kind of felt a
[1:46:22] little weird, brother. And I thought,
[1:46:23] why out of all these young people here,
[1:46:26] and the Lord heals this 78-year-old lady
[1:46:29] who's made it all the way through life,
[1:46:30] who's had a good life, why heal her now?
[1:46:34] Why heal her of that hearing problem
[1:46:36] now? And the Lord, just as clearly as
[1:46:39] I'm speaking to you now, he told me,
[1:46:41] "There's never been a better time to
[1:46:43] hear the message."
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's never been a better
[1:46:47] time to hear what the spirit is saying
[1:46:49] to the church than it is right now. I
[1:46:52] say shake off the heavy bands. Get out
[1:46:54] of the distraction of the age. Don't
[1:46:56] look at politics. Don't look to what the
[1:46:58] world is doing. We have a more sure word
[1:47:00] of prophecy in this age. Hear what the
[1:47:02] spirit has said to the church. You are
[1:47:05] not going to go down into in defeat. You
[1:47:07] are not going to go down in in a
[1:47:09] disaster. You are going up with the
[1:47:11] word. You are going up with the bride.
[1:47:13] The shout of the king has returned to
[1:47:15] the camp. Let me say this friends.
[1:47:17] Tribulation is not my destination.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Tribulation is not my goal. I'm in a
[1:47:23] rapture. And the rapture is on for the
[1:47:25] bride. It's on, friends.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's revival. If the
[1:47:30] music players would come, this is the
[1:47:31] opening of the word. This is what these
[1:47:33] things mean. This is the third poll.
[1:47:35] What does that mean? It means it's
[1:47:37] Christ in you using your body, using
[1:47:40] your voice.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I hope that you
[1:47:43] understand where I'm coming from.
[1:47:44] Brother Brandham never had creative
[1:47:45] power in his being.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; It was Christ.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; And that same Christ has come in this
[1:47:52] generation to this group of people and
[1:47:54] has come down in the same might and
[1:47:56] power. This is the third pole.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; I I don't have time to read the quote,
[1:48:02] but he said the third pole went back to
[1:48:04] get them.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Who's them? To them that overcome. To
[1:48:08] them my father has prepared a place for.
[1:48:11] to them that are here.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; This is us, friends.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; This is why you were born.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Your whole life has accumulated to this.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; You are the manifestation
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; of the word of power in this age.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; And you will overthrow the greatest
[1:48:33] adversary the world has ever known.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] I don't know what that does to you, but
[1:48:41] it does something to me.
[1:48:44] He's had me in a corner a lot of times.
[1:48:46] This old devil, that old slooh foot's
[1:48:48] had me backed up a lot of times.
[1:48:51] You know, sometimes I forget who I am.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; I let him win a little battle. Forget
[1:48:58] who I am. I let him I I let him back me
[1:49:00] up a little bit. Well, I guess it's just
[1:49:04] not for me.
[1:49:06] But then I remember as David did,
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; he encouraged himself
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; in the word.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You know what it means to be anointed in
[1:49:15] the presence of your enemies? Brother
[1:49:17] Bam says, "Have you ever been anointed
[1:49:19] in the presence of your enemy?
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; It means to rejoice in the middle of
[1:49:25] your situation.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; It means to give God glory right in the
[1:49:30] middle of the hardest trial you've ever
[1:49:32] been in in your life. Any Leodysian
[1:49:34] believer can come and sit down and fill
[1:49:36] a seat.
[1:49:39] Anybody, anybody can praise him on the
[1:49:41] mountaintop.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; But it takes a real believer
[1:49:46] to praise him in the middle of the
[1:49:48] valley.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; To praise him in the middle of the
[1:49:51] darkest situation you've been in. It
[1:49:53] takes a real believer to do that. I
[1:49:55] believe I'm speaking to real believers
[1:49:56] this morning
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; that refuse to let the devil dictate how
[1:50:00] you worship. Refuse to let the devil
[1:50:03] dictate how you praise your God, where
[1:50:05] you see yourself in the scripture. I
[1:50:07] know that this has been clearly laid out
[1:50:08] by your pastor and other ministries that
[1:50:10] have come have told you that this word
[1:50:12] is where it's at today. This is the
[1:50:13] third poll. This is the opening of the
[1:50:15] word. But where the devil catches us is
[1:50:17] he says it's not for us.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; It's true. It's just not for you.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That's a good one.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; You know that not all shall be saved.
[1:50:27] You know that not all are elected. You
[1:50:29] see how the devil tries to twist those
[1:50:31] scriptures?
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; But the devil doesn't know who's
[1:50:33] elected.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't know who's saved.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; He's a bluff.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; He doesn't know that you're a seed of
[1:50:41] God.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bluff you out of your
[1:50:43] position.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; It's the first track of inter trick of
[1:50:48] interrogation.
[1:50:50] You try to bluff them into confessing
[1:50:51] something.
[1:50:55] you know that they'll they'll go to a
[1:50:57] murder scene and if they think
[1:50:58] somebody's guilty, they'll come to them
[1:51:00] and they'll say, "Hey, we found your DNA
[1:51:01] there." And they'll try to get that
[1:51:03] person to say, "Yeah, it was me."
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; And the devil will come to you and it'll
[1:51:09] come right to your your situation,
[1:51:13] say, "See, it's not you.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; You're not a real bride member. You're
[1:51:17] not a real believer. He's trying to get
[1:51:19] you to confess something.
[1:51:22] I've seen my name.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; It's been revealed to me. I may not look
[1:51:27] like it. I may not feel like it. I may
[1:51:29] not always show up like it, but it's
[1:51:32] been revealed to me who I am. And the
[1:51:34] devil can't take away my name. He
[1:51:36] doesn't have an eraser big enough. He
[1:51:38] can't blot out what God's already done.
[1:51:40] The blood of the lamb has already
[1:51:42] written my name there. And in the middle
[1:51:44] of my darkest trial, I will be in King
[1:51:47] Lamb worship because that is the season
[1:51:49] that I am living in to give God glory in
[1:51:52] the middle of every situation. In the
[1:51:53] darkest of Leodysia, I'm going to give
[1:51:55] God glory. I don't want I don't want my
[1:51:57] tormentor this morning to make it back
[1:51:59] down to hell and tell the devil he lost.
[1:52:02] I want my praise to reach him first. I
[1:52:04] want my victory shout to reach him
[1:52:06] first. I don't believe that those
[1:52:08] fallen, that servant that watched all of
[1:52:10] Egypt's army crash in the Red Sea and be
[1:52:13] utterly destroyed, I don't think that
[1:52:14] servant had time to make it back to
[1:52:16] Pharaoh.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; I believe Pharaoh heard 250,000 women in
[1:52:21] their tambourines give glory to the
[1:52:23] Lord. The horse and the rider are thrown
[1:52:25] into the sea. The Lord has triumphed
[1:52:28] gloriously. And I want to tell that
[1:52:30] anxiety demon today, I don't want him to
[1:52:32] make it back down to hell in time. I
[1:52:34] want to let the devil know that I'm
[1:52:36] already delivered. I want to let the
[1:52:38] devil know now that my praise is not
[1:52:40] going to be silenced. My my worry is not
[1:52:43] going to be louder than the voice of my
[1:52:45] praise. But I will rejoice because my
[1:52:48] name has been revealed on the lamb's
[1:52:51] book of life. Hallelujah.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:59] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:53:03] blessing it. You unravel me.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; The melody.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:11] [Music]
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. with the song
[1:53:20] of deliverance
[1:53:24] from my eneies
[1:53:28] till all my fears
[1:53:32] are gone.
[1:53:36] And I'm no longer
[1:53:39] slave
[1:53:40] to fear.
[1:53:44] I am a child
[1:53:48] of God.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm no longer a slave
[1:53:56] to fear.
[1:54:00] Oh, I am
[1:54:02] a child of God.
[1:54:07] from my mother's womb.
[1:54:11] You have chosen me.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Your love has gone
[1:54:19] by.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll be born.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Only the elect can be born again soon.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, your blood flows through my
[1:54:35] hallelujah.
[1:54:37] Oh, and I'm no longer
[1:54:41] slave.
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; I am a child of God.
[1:54:53] And I'm no longer a slave
[1:54:57] to fear.
[1:54:59] Oh,
[1:55:04] child of God. You split the sea.
[1:55:09] Oh, you split the sea so I could walk by
[1:55:16] the way. My fears are drowned in perfect
[1:55:21] love.
[1:55:25] You rescued me so I will stand as
[1:55:32] I am a child.
[1:55:36] God, you split the sea. Oh, you split
[1:55:41] the sea so I could walk right through
[1:55:46] it. My fears are drowned in.
[1:55:51] How deep is his grace? Hallelujah.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; You rescue me and I will stand.
[1:56:03] Oh,
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; why don't we sing it like we're free
[1:56:07] children tonight. I'm no longer
[1:56:10] You split the sea
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; so I could walk right through.
[1:56:18] My fears are drowned in perfect love.
[1:56:23] Oh,
[1:56:26] you rescued me and I will stay.
[1:56:31] [Music]
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave and I'm no longer
[1:56:42] slave
[1:56:44] to be.
[1:56:46] Oh,
[1:56:47] I am a child of God.
[1:56:53] Oh, and I'm no longer
[1:56:57] slain
[1:56:59] to be.
[1:57:03] I am a child
[1:57:07] of God.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. Fear has lost its
[1:57:14] battle.
[1:57:16] I'm no longer a slave to that
[1:57:17] condemnation. No longer a slave to the
[1:57:19] fear of this age or no longer a slave to
[1:57:21] the fear of my future. But I want to say
[1:57:23] what the prophet said, "Your future is
[1:57:26] clear."
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Your future is clear. It's been written
[1:57:30] in the stars. Your future has a
[1:57:33] destination, but the devil's future is
[1:57:35] also clear.
[1:57:37] And when he ceases and breathes no more,
[1:57:41] I'll just be singing my 10,000th verse
[1:57:44] of Amazing Grace. My chains are gone.
[1:57:47] I've been set free.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:53] Are you free this morning, church?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; You recognize your name has been written
[1:57:58] there
[1:57:59] before before your confession, before
[1:58:02] the trial, your name was already there.
[1:58:04] I believe it's time to recognize
[1:58:08] a name means a representation of an
[1:58:10] entity.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; So, it's not just a name.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; There's representation there.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Have you received this message as eagle
[1:58:20] food? Have you recognized this message
[1:58:22] to be the food for eagles? Then you have
[1:58:24] heard from your theophony, which means
[1:58:27] you have representation there, which
[1:58:30] means you cannot be defeated. This is
[1:58:31] not the end for you. But you have a
[1:58:34] mansion waiting. And it's not a mansion
[1:58:36] of timber and cedar and wood. It's a
[1:58:38] theophonic body. And you have recognized
[1:58:41] this message to be your ticket to get
[1:58:43] back to that theophony that you bypass
[1:58:46] to be here. I think we got a lot of
[1:58:48] reason to rejoice in the message of the
[1:58:50] hour in this age because it's done more
[1:58:52] than any Baptist church could do or any
[1:58:54] Pentecostal idea could do. This is the
[1:58:57] revealed word of Christ in this age. We
[1:58:59] did not come together to talk about it.
[1:59:01] We came to get in it. It's a rocket
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; and it's leaving. I think if you got one
[1:59:08] foot out, I say get all in. There's
[1:59:11] never been a time like this
[1:59:14] and you were born for it. You were born
[1:59:17] for it. Heavenly Father, we love you
[1:59:19] this morning, Lord. We thank you for
[1:59:20] your grace to us. We thank you for your
[1:59:22] revealed word, Lord, that has come to
[1:59:24] loose, Lord, those names that were
[1:59:26] revealed, Lord, to loose those seals,
[1:59:28] Father, where once we walked in
[1:59:29] confusion, and darkness, Lord, not
[1:59:31] knowing who we were, not knowing what
[1:59:33] the plan of God was, but Lord, as John
[1:59:36] stood there on that shore that day,
[1:59:38] Lord, and he looked down over the the
[1:59:40] shoulder of that book, Father, and he
[1:59:42] saw something, just maybe one word
[1:59:44] there. Oh, God, but it changed his life
[1:59:46] forever,
[1:59:48] Lord. It changed his confession. It
[1:59:50] changed everything about him. He went
[1:59:52] from weeping to rejoicing, Lord. And
[1:59:54] many churches, Lord, this morning don't
[1:59:56] know. Many individuals maybe in this
[1:59:58] room this morning, they don't know,
[2:00:00] Father.
[2:00:01] Lord, it hasn't been revealed to them,
[2:00:03] Lord, that the pages are open on the
[2:00:05] book of life. And you were revealing and
[2:00:07] calling those names in this hour.
[2:00:10] Lord, may they hear it this morning,
[2:00:12] Lord.
[2:00:14] Father, may they look past, Lord, the
[2:00:16] the doctrines and the ideas and the
[2:00:18] hurts and the scars. Father, may they
[2:00:20] look, Lord, at the true revelation of
[2:00:23] this word that's come forth, Lord, that
[2:00:25] has declared the names that were written
[2:00:28] there in glory.
[2:00:30] Oh God,
[2:00:32] Father, if it was possible for John to
[2:00:34] hear it and to see it, then Lord, I know
[2:00:36] it's possible for us this morning. For
[2:00:39] if you did it for him, you're obligated
[2:00:41] to do it for me. Lord, you're obligated
[2:00:43] to reveal to those sincere hearts this
[2:00:45] morning, Lord, that are at the feast of
[2:00:47] sincerity and truth. Lord, dining at
[2:00:50] your table this morning, Lord, waiting
[2:00:51] for their name to be called maybe this
[2:00:53] morning, Lord. May you let it ring true
[2:00:56] to them. Pierce through the doubt, Lord.
[2:01:00] Pierce through the unbelief of this age,
[2:01:01] Lord. Let your name, Lord, penetrate the
[2:01:03] cavity of their soul, Lord, they could
[2:01:06] come in contact with their theophony
[2:01:08] once again, Lord.
[2:01:11] God, this isn't a fairy tale to me. This
[2:01:14] isn't just some mystical story, but
[2:01:16] Lord, it's a reality of what you're
[2:01:18] doing in this age,
[2:01:20] Lord, that you're you're calling us
[2:01:22] higher. You're calling us in heavenly
[2:01:25] places with you, Father.
[2:01:28] Oh, Jesus,
[2:01:31] help us to lay aside every care, Lord.
[2:01:34] Help us to lay aside every distraction,
[2:01:36] Lord, and cling to that finished work of
[2:01:39] Calvary this morning. Father, tomorrow
[2:01:42] if we should fall and stumble, let us
[2:01:44] rejoice that there's a place deep enough
[2:01:48] that we could bury our sorrow. We could
[2:01:50] bury our mistake, Lord. Father, that we
[2:01:53] could be zealous for the hour and
[2:01:55] repent, Lord, and say, "Lord, I'm sorry,
[2:01:59] but my name is still my name.
[2:02:03] I'm still a son. I'm still a daughter.
[2:02:06] Lord, maybe there's some family praying
[2:02:08] for a prodigal this morning out there,
[2:02:10] Lord.
[2:02:12] Father, there's been Lord, maybe some
[2:02:14] time, but Lord, as you spoke to me so
[2:02:17] clearly this year, there's never been a
[2:02:20] better time to hear the message than
[2:02:22] now.
[2:02:24] Lord, may they hear their name be called
[2:02:26] out.
[2:02:27] The Lord may be in the middle of a
[2:02:31] maybe in the middle of a mud trough
[2:02:33] somewhere wondering if God's even real,
[2:02:35] wondering what truth is. But Lord, your
[2:02:38] word is greater than that darkness,
[2:02:41] Lord. And I pray that it would pierce
[2:02:43] through and call that by name, Father,
[2:02:46] that which is yours. For your word said
[2:02:48] you wouldn't lose one and no man can
[2:02:49] pluck them from your hand.
[2:02:52] And Lord, we claim that redemptive right
[2:02:54] this morning
[2:02:56] that you bless your children,
[2:02:59] Lord. Bless bless the leadership here.
[2:03:01] Bless the ministry, Lord. Bless the
[2:03:03] helps, Father. Lord, bless the faithful
[2:03:06] soldiers, Lord, who come and Lord or
[2:03:09] hear what the word is saying in this
[2:03:10] hour, Lord. May you just pour your
[2:03:13] spirit out fresh upon them, Lord. May
[2:03:15] there be a fresh awakening. I pray Lord
[2:03:18] Father Lord to rejoice ever more that
[2:03:20] you are alive and well
[2:03:22] living in your church. Father we love
[2:03:24] you this morning. We thank you in Jesus
[2:03:27] name.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; I am a child
[2:03:33] of God.
[2:03:35] Oh I'm no longer
[2:03:39] slave
[2:03:41] to fear.
[2:03:45] I am a child.
[2:03:50] Oh, my chains are gone.
[2:03:55] I've been set free.
[2:03:59] My God, my Savior
[2:04:02] has ransom me.
[2:04:06] And like a flood,
[2:04:10] his mercy reigns.
[2:04:14] Unending love.
[2:04:17] Amazing grace.
[2:04:22] Amazing
[2:04:24] grace.
[2:04:26] How sweet
[2:04:27] the sound that saved
[2:04:31] a wretch like me.
[2:04:37] I once was lost, but now
[2:04:42] I'm
[2:04:44] was blind, but now
[2:04:48] I see.
[2:04:51] My chains are gone.
[2:04:54] I've been set free.
[2:04:58] My God, my Savior
[2:05:02] has ransomed me. Oh, and like a flood,
[2:05:09] his mercy reigns
[2:05:13] unending love.
[2:05:17] Amazing
[2:05:18] grace.
[2:05:21] It was grace that taught my heart to
[2:05:27] fear
[2:05:29] and grace my fears
[2:05:33] relief.
[2:05:36] How preious
[2:05:39] did that grace appear.
[2:05:44] The hour I first believe.
[2:05:49] Oh my chains are gone.
[2:05:54] I've been set free.
[2:05:58] My God, my Savior
[2:06:01] has ransom me.
[2:06:05] And like a flood,
[2:06:09] his mercy reigns.
[2:06:13] Unending love,
[2:06:16] amazing grace.
[2:06:20] My shades are gone,
[2:06:24] have been set free.
[2:06:28] My God, my savior
[2:06:31] has ransomed me.
[2:06:35] And like a flood,
[2:06:38] his mercy rains
[2:06:42] on any
[2:06:47] like a flood
[2:06:50] and like a flood.
[2:06:53] His mercy reigns.
