[0:00] our Bibles after a service like this we
[0:03] just close it up and just say well
[0:06] everybody was in the prince of God
[0:08] everybody got what they got no this is a
[0:11] time every meeting we have is where the
[0:15] Holy Spirit himself comes down and takes
[0:18] us like he did the disciples looks up on
[0:21] the field and said pray you the Lord of
[0:23] harvest that he will send laborers into
[0:28] the field because it's ripe for Harvest
[0:32] and brother Bram says he has placed us
[0:34] as partners with him and what does what
[0:38] does that mean that means that even as
[0:40] we leave from here I could have read you
[0:43] a quote here where brother Bram says
[0:46] when you go from church he says get your
[0:49] family together and have
[0:52] prayer he said do you just go from
[0:54] church and you don't go home and you
[0:56] don't pray you don't get the family
[0:58] together but get them together and have
[1:00] prayer if you haven't had devotions
[1:03] family altar get that together I
[1:06] encourage you to do that and not just
[1:08] within just that moment but listen
[1:11] friends it's a lot I I don't I don't my
[1:14] prayer is I don't want things to stay
[1:15] general for us I want it to be so
[1:18] specific it gets down to where we can
[1:20] take a hold of and say got it it's
[1:23] appliable so it's things where we sat
[1:26] down and I I've just I think I shared a
[1:27] little bit of this with you before when
[1:29] we come out of a service special
[1:31] services we've had Services we have I'll
[1:35] just start sharing things that God spoke
[1:37] to my heart I ask the boys what what is
[1:40] something that struck you right what
[1:42] struck your heart what is the thing hey
[1:44] what's a where's a what what's a
[1:46] scripture sometimes those things are
[1:47] just text to me and then we just go from
[1:49] there we'll go from there but still as
[1:51] we sit around and talk about it so it
[1:52] doesn't when we talk about sitting down
[1:54] with our family it doesn't mean that
[1:56] you've got to get the concordance out
[1:58] the Bible out and this out you lose them
[2:01] you lose them you have it has to come
[2:04] down in
[2:05] Simplicity and it's con it's it's
[2:08] application is everybody with me it's
[2:11] simple even as husband and wife there's
[2:12] nobody listen I got a I have a lot of a
[2:15] lot of fellowshipping with my brothers
[2:16] and sisters I've got a lot of got a lot
[2:19] of wonderful preacher buddies too but
[2:20] there is nobody that I love to
[2:23] fellowship around the things of God
[2:25] better than my
[2:28] wife oh man and fellowshipping of the
[2:31] things of the message of the hour and of
[2:33] the of the scripture the word there's
[2:36] nothing more precious than that and let
[2:39] me tell you something if we don't do it
[2:42] who is right if we don't win our
[2:45] children who
[2:47] will if we don't win our families who
[2:50] will that's right well brother Samuel
[2:52] that's God's
[2:54] responsibility I agree it is God who
[2:56] will give them the climax of the
[2:58] experience but God has entrusted you and
[3:01] I to be the source that wins them to the
[3:06] Lord and that winning to the Lord
[3:09] sometimes it comes in ways that we're
[3:11] not even thinking about it it starts out
[3:13] with just a little something here and
[3:15] there it may not even be maybe you've
[3:16] got a wayward hus Wayward husband maybe
[3:18] it's a wayward wife maybe it's a wayward
[3:21] son or daughter listen you you can't go
[3:23] right up to him and say hey let me tell
[3:24] you something let let me tell you this
[3:25] quote quote let me tell you this
[3:28] scripture scripture
[3:30] sometimes it just starts out with let me
[3:32] tell you what the Lord spoke to my heart
[3:35] is the Lord good hadn't the Lord given
[3:37] us a wonderful day that's right hadn't
[3:39] the Lord see it's showing he's the Lord
[3:41] of my
[3:42] life it's in simple simple things that
[3:47] they can see this guy has passion for
[3:51] what he believes this isn't something
[3:53] that just after church is over man it
[3:56] it's a passion now I'll say this it
[3:59] isn't that sometimes that we don't need
[4:01] to say just saying from my heart let me
[4:04] just kind a little bit good what's say
[4:06] honest confession is good for the
[4:10] soul this was a complaint in my
[4:13] household oh boy I got everybody
[4:15] sleeping man they awake
[4:19] now but this was my this was my
[4:21] complaint it it made its way through the
[4:23] gra
[4:25] Vine dad's devotion
[4:28] times turned into 30
[4:34] minutes
[4:38] yeah you say well brother Samuel that
[4:40] shouldn't be a complaint I also have to
[4:42] be mindful there's other things that got
[4:43] to go on
[4:44] too but you know what I have found it's
[4:47] not about so much of that and the Lord's
[4:48] had to help me with that to where
[4:51] sometimes it's just dropping just a
[4:52] little bit I'll say this right here and
[4:54] that's it we'll just drop this maybe
[4:55] them speak a little bit maybe it's just
[4:57] discussion of of of some things things
[5:00] but because they've got
[5:02] school they may be got activities that
[5:04] they want to do too but there's just
[5:07] that little bit of time that says that
[5:08] through the whole cusp of the day Jesus
[5:13] is still the center right he's still
[5:16] everything in our lives amen amen he's
[5:20] everything you love him this morning
[5:22] amen amen I I believe you do I I pray
[5:24] that I pray I haven't brought any
[5:26] confusion to you I I just say that you
[5:29] know God leads you I try to give
[5:31] examples with things but God listen the
[5:34] same God that will lead me he'll lead
[5:37] you if you just seek after him he'll
[5:40] lead you and with things that I
[5:42] mentioned before about the smartphone
[5:44] and those things that were mentioned
[5:45] listen I'm not telling you to be a
[5:48] dictator don't you'll bring Rebellion
[5:51] out of your
[5:52] children it's love and trust and
[5:56] respect it's like this right here

[5:59] individuals that sometimes you know you
[6:01] got to take some time if I if I seen
[6:03] something going wrong if there's
[6:04] something I see going wrong maybe
[6:06] something I see a minister may be saying

[6:09] me come right here that let's try to try
[6:12] to get I got to first of all try to
[6:13] build something up before I can ever

[8:35] Lord in a we're all in different
[8:39] seasons but I'm asking you Lord that you
[8:43] would help every one of us that Lord
[8:46] through the whole part of the message
[8:49] today you were pointing us to a
[8:53] place that it's your
[8:56] presence in our lives
[9:02] individually that has an effect
[9:05] Lord and you're the one who teaches us
[9:08] Lord you show us how to apply the
[9:13] word in those times
[9:17] Lord help us
[9:20] Lord I don't Lord I don't want to be
[9:24] guilty of not
[9:25] trying I'd rather try and fall flat on
[9:28] my face
[9:29] than not try at all
[9:33] amen I'm asking you Lord that you
[9:36] would help us together I think not only
[9:39] Lord as a as a church body as a family
[9:43] but God every individual home if there's
[9:46] a father and a mother here Lord this
[9:48] morning that really has maybe not really
[9:51] consecrated their life maybe one has one
[9:54] hasn't maybe there's both but what a
[9:56] what a privilege this morning Lord that
[9:58] if they can just to see what you've done
[10:01] for them to see the love of God that's
[10:04] come down to make a way for their
[10:09] life that Lord that they can just in
[10:12] their own the very simple way surrender
[10:15] their heart to you and say
[10:18] Lord I want to give all of me to you
[10:21] Lord I want every bit Lord all every
[10:24] part of my life I don't want to walk by
[10:26] My reasonings or imaginations I don't
[10:28] want to walk by what what I think I want
[10:32] to
[10:33] walk by your thoughts
[10:37] Lord
[10:39] father I pray this morning would you
[10:42] guide us
[10:43] Lord help us Lord even in every
[10:46] individual
[10:48] home every one of our children Lord I
[10:51] think of our three children they're all
[10:53] they're different well they got a lot of
[10:54] there's similarities but there's
[10:57] differences there's even even different
[10:59] ways that I approach each one of them
[11:01] Lord knowing their differences knowing
[11:05] certain things and how certain things
[11:06] minister to them
[11:08] Lord that to me Lord it speaks of the
[11:11] material in the Tabernacle all the
[11:13] Tabernacle was not all one material it
[11:16] was different material but all of it
[11:18] coming
[11:20] together was an expression of the Living
[11:24] Word help us Lord you didn't ask me to
[11:27] figure that out for my children
[11:29] neither do you ask my brothers and
[11:31] sisters to figure it out for their own
[11:33] children you didn't ask Samson's parents
[11:36] figure it out but you came and you made
[11:40] yourself known and that's when manoah
[11:43] said teach us show us that we might
[11:46] order the child in the right
[11:48] way Lord I'm asking God for your grace
[11:52] for every one of us Lord May every Lord
[11:54] one of our homes Lord beginning right
[11:56] here Lord a challenge Lord God that
[11:59] father even in my heart in my life Lord
[12:02] is that this this assembly this church
[12:05] lord I can't make anyone neither do I
[12:08] want to make anyone do anything but Lord
[12:10] let it be that it's always you that is
[12:14] in view the glory of God is what is here
[12:18] Lord on display and where lives are
[12:22] pointed to that every heart Lord can
[12:25] have that same experience hand that
[12:27] reality when there's things Lord that we
[12:29] face in life that we don't know what to
[12:31] do there is a source for every question
[12:35] there's leadership by the spirit of
[12:36] Truth in this
[12:40] hour I wonder as our heads are bowed I
[12:42] wonder how many would say Lord It's a
[12:45] husband wife father
[12:47] mother son and daughter I wonder how
[12:50] many would say Lord grant that Lord in
[12:53] my
[12:53] life amen God bless you God bless you I
[12:58] got my hand
[12:59] up Grant that Lord I'm still here I'm
[13:03] looking to you father I need your
[13:05] leadership maybe there's things that
[13:07] you've got difficulties in your home
[13:08] difficulties you say but the same I
[13:10] don't know how to resolve it let's look
[13:11] to him let's keep the glory of God in
[13:14] view because there was absolutely no way
[13:16] for you and I to be made whole to be
[13:18] saved there was no way for Redemption no
[13:20] way for forgiveness no way out but the
[13:23] glory of God came down to where we were
[13:24] at brother Samuel do you believe that
[13:27] with all my heart I believe that that I
[13:29] know that to be a reality when I don't
[13:32] know what to do when I don't know
[13:33] situations even of things of how do I
[13:36] approach this with my son how would I
[13:38] approach this with my wife how do I how
[13:39] do I bring this out or even with the
[13:41] church how do I do that I Look to
[13:43] Him I Look to
[13:47] himen oh god let's go to him and let's
[13:50] let's finish Heavenly
[13:54] Father hearts Lord throughout this
[13:57] building I I pray that God that you'll
[13:59] bless them Lord I know it's been a
[14:01] little tough here this morning Lord
[14:02] through conditions to listen to heed but
[14:05] I pray that you would bless them Lord I
[14:08] pray that God that father as their
[14:10] hearts Lord have Lord been opened Lord
[14:14] with the desire of all things

[18:48] and internet they didn't have to think
[18:49] about that there's other ways and other
[18:52] things that they had to pray and and

[19:43] age as parents Lord when things are all
[19:46] around us give us Lord the wisdom we
[19:49] need to be able to lead that our

[19:54] Lord are able to grasp and to discern
[19:58] between right and wrong help us Lord I
[20:01] pray and thank you Lord for your grace
[20:04] to our lives thank you for your
[20:07] mercy thank you Lord
[20:12] Jesus you know one thing in the
[20:14] scripture I've always looked
[20:19] at when the Jews were come into a place
[20:23] when hmon had set the
[20:26] Trap and the time was dra near for them
[20:29] to be slaughtered in the
[20:32] Kingdom Esther you know how the How The
[20:34] Story
[20:35] Goes when she came into that moment and
[20:40] finally made known to the king of who
[20:43] she was her identity the plot that had
[20:46] been made by
[20:48] hmon remember the king said I cannot
[20:53] undo the words that's already been
[20:56] written in other words words I I can't
[20:59] undo the seeds per se that's already
[21:01] been swn I can't go back and take them
[21:03] out of the ground but here's what you
[21:04] can do this is what I love about it are
[21:06] you with me this is what I love how the
[21:09] king a principle in our lives he said
[21:12] but here's what you do you go tell your
[21:15] people to arm
[21:17] themselves and the day before that
[21:20] Slaughter is to happen you tell them to
[21:23] go through and take care of every one of
[21:26] them that were going to come and bring
[21:28] harm to
[21:29] you aren't you grateful that even though
[21:33] listen friends even through things we're
[21:34] not not to be careless people I believe
[21:36] there's a heart's desire to say Lord I
[21:38] want to do what's right but God does not
[21:40] put us in a place to say you've been
[21:43] wrong or you've been wrong or you he
