Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What a privilege it [music] is to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And to know that, Amen. It's not our own strength. Sometimes it [music] feels like our strength when we have to push a little bit, but that's actually yielding. And there's always many times there's barriers and that barrier is self. But yet God that what what actually brings us beyond that is the love of God and just to all just to always keeping before us who he is what he's done for us and what he's done for us my we can never truly praise him enough. Amen. that when he has broke the very yoke of bondage around our lives for the grace that he's he's ministered to us for the areas that he's touched and my just so brought such repair and restoration. There's no one like Jesus. &gt;&gt; His love and his care is so deep. It's beyond what even a writer could pin down. It's beyond what we can even imagine. Amen. But it's real. It takes a hold of us. And I'm glad we can't explain it. I'm glad that there's a loss of words within that, but it's something that you know that you've experienced. Amen. And so we just we thank God for his mercy. Amen. Here this morning, amen. So good to have each [music] and everyone here with us. And um we want to just uh continue remember um Brother Brian and the family in prayer. And um we'll try to get all the details out about um there's a memorial service, I'm assuming. Yes and no. Maybe. Okay. So, just be looking for that on the the thread if there's any details from brother Brian or we'll get those out on the text thread and also try to copy that out to the email as well. And um just want to also thank the Lord, you know, the request that went out about uh Sister Raina on Thursday and you know, we didn't know when they had to take her back to the emergency room whether or not that there was a brain bleed from her falling on the ice. Ended up being a concussion instead. And um so we're thankful to God's mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. That the fall that she took with the vertebraes and things like that could have been a whole lot worse. Uh but we thank God for his mercy. Amen. And so we just want to continue to remember her in prayer and different ones among us. And we want to welcome brother Josh Martin. Brother Josh has been here with us before. He and his wife, Sister Loretta. And we're so glad that um they would make time and be able to be here with us this morning. We just want to pull on the gift of God. Uh God knows what our needs are and uh we just ask that the Lord will just just come in a special way. Say, Lord, I just like the song said, "Here's my cup. I lift it up, Lord. I I lift I lift my life. I lift my heart. Lord, come and fill it, Lord. Come and speak to my heart, Lord. You know my needs." You know, if you think about when Moses was there before the burning bush. Brother Ram says this over and over, but how to me how true it is. In less than five minutes, God did more for Moses &gt;&gt; than what 40 years &gt;&gt; of schooling could ever do. &gt;&gt; He knew about the promise. The prophet said he was born with the equipment in him. He had complete he had a lot of he had understanding regarding that of what God was looking to do in that day. But he needed that to be quickened within him. He needed that revelation. And you know, God knows what he's called each of us to do. Even God knows the questions and what we have on our hearts. [music] Just a moment in his presence. Just one moment. We can just say, "Lord, just just a few words, Lord. Just just help me to get [music] bowed into that point because it might just be a sentence that God would have for you [music] this morning, but just a few words. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just if we could, let's just stand and let's invite brother Josh and Amen. Once again, so happy to have he and sister Loretta here with us. And um let's sing that song. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my cup. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it [singing] up, Lord. Come [singing] and quench this thirsting [singing] of my [music] soul. Bread [singing] [music] of heaven, feed [singing and music] me, Jes. I want no more. Here's my cup. &gt;&gt; Here's my cup, Lord. &gt;&gt; Fill it up. [singing] Oh, let's just sing [music] it once again. My cup, Lord, I lift it [music] up. &gt;&gt; I surrender, Lord. &gt;&gt; I yield to you, Lord. Come and finish this thirsting [singing and music] of my soul &gt;&gt; and heaven [singing] [music] feed me till I want no [singing] for here's my cup. Fill it up and make [singing] Can we sing that one more time now? &gt;&gt; Oh, fill my cup, Lord. [singing] I lift [singing] it up, Lord. Come and quench [singing] [music] this thirsting of [singing] my soul. Oh bread of heaven, [singing and music] feed me till I want no [singing] more. Here's [music] my cup. &gt;&gt; Fill it up and make [singing] me whole. Amen. I trust that's your desire this morning. Lord, here's my cup. I'm going to empty it out so that you can fill it up. You know, brother Brandon would say, many people wants Christ to be their savior, but not their Lord. But I say, Lord, I'm emptying myself out so that you can have rulership over every aspect of my life, of my home, [music] of my my decisions, my future, whatever it may be. I'm emptying out myself so that I can follow your leadership and and I trust that's that's why we're gathered here today is not just to show off our our nice clothes or just to show brother Samuel we're not backslid but I believe if we've come together to draw closer to the Lord and I trust if if if that's your desire I know if that's your desire God will meet that need and meet that expectation and and we can leave this place with a a bigger eye or more of a revelation of who he is. And and I believe that our God is an ontime God. And whatever you your need may be this morning, he is still answering the prayers and the and the desires of the heart. Amen. But it's good to be with you here today. I count it's an honor and a privilege to be here. I pray something can be said today to be a blessing and and to strengthen your faith in some way. But if you would have your scriptures, let's let's open our Bibles to John 14 and5. Have a lengthy passage of scripture. But I pray it's okay if we if we take a few moments and read it. It's good to have my family with me. Uh my wife Loretta and my my three kiddos, Ethan, Brielle, and and Oliver. Uh our Oliver is a I think seven weeks old now. So we we have a newborn. And so it's the Lord's Lord's blessed us and this is their first time away from home and their first trip. And so he's he's doing good so far. So we pray that that the Lord continues to to bless us with a good traveler. The other two have been great. You know, we we're on the road a lot. So we thank the Lord for for blessing us with that. But it's it's good to have them with me here today. Bring greetings from our home church, Brother Wendle Martin and the saints there, New Life Outreach. They send their greetings. Amen. But John 14:55, Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whether thou goest, and how can we know the way? And Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, you should have known my father also. And from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him,"Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us." Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philillip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. And how sayest thou then, show us the Father? Believest thou not that I'm in the Father, the Father in me. And the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of myself, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, the Father in me. Or else believe me. For the very works sake, verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do, he shall do also. And greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father. Whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. And if you ask anything in my name, I will do it. If you love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him. For he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while the world seeth me no more, but ye see me, because I live, ye shall live also. At that day you shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me, and I in you. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. And Judas saith unto him, not a scariot, Lord, how is it that thou will manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? And Jesus answered him, and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and will come unto him, and make her abode with him. Amen. Can we bow our heads this morning? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, what an honor it is to come into your your house, Father. Lord, may we never take this lightly or for granted, Lord, that we have a place where we can come and hear hear words of life, Father, that can strengthen and encourage, Lord. God, as we come into this place today, Lord, we're a needy people, and we're nothing without you, Lord. We ask that you would just have your perfect way here among us, Father. You know the hearts and the desires of your people. I ask that your word, may it strike the target, Lord. May it answer prayers, Father. May it may it come forth with an anointing. Father, Lord, we commit ourselves and the service into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. And I just have a simple thought this morning, but it would be a people for his name. Man, and brother Brandham would say, notice what harmony Jesus never did anything until seeing of the father or the father showed him first. harmony between God and Christ. See John 5:19. So will the bride and he shows her his word of life. He shows her and she receives it. She never doubts it. Nothing can harm her, not even death. For if the seed be planted and the the water will raise it up again. Amen. Then I get a then I get a big great hallelujah. Here is the secret. The word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name. She has thus saith the Lord. Then it is germatized. So the Holy Spirit waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose. They do only his will. No one can persuade them different for they have thus saith the Lord. Or they keep still. Then they will do the works of God, for it is himself in them, continuing his word to fulfill as he did complete in his days. And and I think that we're living in an incredible time. I I believe that that we're upon the earth for a purpose. And and I believe that God has called us to be his body upon the earth and that he can have preeeminence in and the word can can flow through and fulfill what God has for this generation. And and and I like how brother Brandham, he is putting it that the that the word of truth comes to the bride and she receives it, never doubts it, and then she will do the greater works. And and she does it through his name, in his name, for she has thus saith the Lord. And and I believe that that that that the name that the we're coming under is an important thing. and and and when you look at what's so important about the name, brother Brandham, he would teach us that your name characterizes you. It it describes your nature. So, a name is more than just a title or what you're called, but it's the character that you're under. And we could see through the Bible that that Jacob would be changed to Israel and a a and Simon to Peter, Saul to Paul, and and we can look at the opening of the of the seals. Brother Brandham would say, "I'm not going to call you church, but I'm going to call you bride." And and I believe that that has more than just a just a better sounding to it, but I believe that was done for a purpose. And I believe that that when we come under that name, we're coming under a life and coming under an anointing. And this would be prophesied by the scripture that God would take a people out of the Gentiles for his name's sake. And I believe we're living in that time. Brother Brandon would tell us we're living in the separating time where God is calling a bride and the devil's calling a church. And he says, "Let me be a part of that bride." And I'm sure that's your that's your attitude tonight. I don't want to just be a church member, but let me be a part OF THE BRIDE OF CHRIST where I take his name, come under his headship. And it's incredible because we're living in an evil age. Brother Brandham would call it the most deceitful age that there has been. He would preach a message called the God of this evil age. And he would say that it's it's incredible to think that it's the most EVIL AGE, BUT OUT OF THAT AGE, God is calling a people for his name's sake. He would talk about how how that Nazareth was a was a wicked city. It was a prostituting city. And there wasn't a more wicked city upon the earth at that time. BUT OUT OF THAT PLACE, God would call a virgin Mary and would through her produce the promised child. AND HE WOULD SAY, "SO IS IT TODAY IN THE MOST evil age that THERE'S EVER BEEN. GOD IS CALLING A people for his name's sake." So I believe that they're living in a special time. And I believe we're being gathered together. Excuse me. And I don't believe we're being gathered just under a title of Baptist or under a title of Pentecostal or under a title of even message, but I believe we're coming under the life of Jesus Christ which is producing the greater works. And brother Brandham, he in the message God pro God's provided place of worship. He would say there's a difference between somebody putting God's name there and God himself putting his name there. And so many people can claim they're under the name of the Lord, BUT IT'S JUST A TITLE TO THEM BECAUSE YOU CAN BE CALLED a Christian and yet lack the life of Jesus Christ. You can you can BE UNDER THE TITLE OF A MESSAGE believer and still lack the life OF JESUS CHRIST. BUT WHERE HE PLACES HIS NAME, the life is going to be there. SO WE'RE NOT MAKING OURSEL BRIDE, BUT GOD HAS CALLED US AND HAS CHOSEN us and has PLACED HIS LIFE THERE WHICH IS PROCLAIMING THIS IS MY APPROVED PEOPLE UPON THE EARTH. NOT A MEEK BELIEVER, NOT SOMEBODY TRYING TO WORK SOMETHING UP, BUT I MYSELF HAVE PUT MY NAME THERE AND IS PRODUCING A LIFE. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US THAT that there's nothing in the Bible that types denominationalism like Babylon. He says it was a forced religion that everybody around there had to come to the Tower of Babel to worship. And what I think is incredible is Brother Brandon then would tell us that you don't get into Christ BY BY BEING FORCED into it. He says you come into it by election. HE SAYS YOUR HEART POURS YOU INTO IT. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT THAT THAT Abram would be in a place called which was in southern Babylon. So here Abram was in a forced religion, BUT YET GRACE WOULD CALL HIM AND SAY, "I'VE ELECTED YOU FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE." AND HERE WE'RE living in a in in A IN A SOCIETY WHERE EVERYBODY'S CHRISTIANS. You know, EVERYBODY IS GOING TO HEAVEN. EVERYBODY HAS THE LIFE OF CHRIST. BUT YET THERE'S A PEOPLE BY ELECTION THAT IS CALLING YOU OUT OF A RELIGION AND IS PLACING YOU IN A LIFE. CUZ I DON'T WANT JUST RELIGION. RELIGION IS GOING TO FAIL YOU. RELIGION IS NOT GOING TO KEEP YOUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER. RELIGION IS NOT GOING TO SAVE YOUR CHILDREN. BUT THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST, WHICH THIS MESSAGE HAS BROUGHT, HAS AN AUTHORITY TO KEEP LIVES TOGETHER. HAS AN AUTHORITY TO CHANGE DESIRES AND KEEP MARRIAGES TOGETHER. WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A FORCED RELIGION. WE'VE BEEN GIVEN a life by election. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE HERE ABRAHAM WOULD BE IN THIS FORCED RELIGION, BUT YET GRACE WOULD CALL HIM OUT. AND YOU COULD LOOK THAT IT WAS GRACE EVERY STEP OF THE JOURNEY. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT ABRAHAM is a type of the church, right? And he would say that in in the message Jehovah Gyra, I believe it was the the second part of it. He says, "Are you enjoying the study with Abraham, he says that Abraham's life, his journey is a type of the church." AND WHENEVER I WOULD COME ACROSS THAT, IT GAVE ME A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE of Abraham BECAUSE YOU HEAR THE STORY OF ABRAHAM, HOW THAT GOD WOULD CALL HIM, GOD WOULD CHANGE HIS BODY, HE WOULD MEET MCKAZDC. BUT ONCE I WOULD SEE THAT, it opened IT UP TO ME THAT ABRAHAM'S MY TYPE. EVERY PART OF THE JOURNEY THAT ABRAHAM WOULD GO THROUGH, WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT AS WELL. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT GOD WOULD CALL HIM BY GRACE. CALL HIM WHICH WOULD BE JUSTIFICATION WHICH WOULD BE LUTHER. AND THEN HE WOULD SAY THERE WAS the confirming of the covenant. He would say which WAS WESLEY WHICH WAS SANCTIFICATION. THEN HE SAYS THEN HE moved on to the Holy Ghost WHICH WAS EL SHADI, RIGHT? WHICH WOULD BE THE STRENGTH GIVER. HE WOULD SAY THAT IS PENTECOST. BUT THEN HE MOVED ON TO ANOTHER PHASE OF HIS JOURNEY WHICH WOULD BE HIS NAME CHANGE. HALLELUJAH. AND WHAT WOULD THAT NAME CHANGE DO? IT WOULD TAKE AWAY HIS REPUTATION OF FATHERLESS AND WOULD BRING ON GOD'S REPUTATION OF FATHER OF NATIONS. SO WHAT WOULD THAT DO? BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THAT NAME CHANGE WAS HIS ADOPTION WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LIVING IN TODAY. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE DAY OF JUST JUSTIFICATION OR SANCTIFICATION OR JUST A A PENTECOSTAL UH GIFT OR OR THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. WE'RE LIVING IN THE DAY WHERE GOD HAS [screaming] CHOSEN TO PLACE HIS NAME, WHICH IS OUR ADOPTION, WHICH IS PLACING US IN OUR INHERITANCE, THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT KNOW THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO KNOW IT BECAUSE I WILL BE WITH YOU AND BE EVEN IN YOU. WHAT IS IT? HE HAS CHANGED US FROM A CHURCH MEMBER TO HIS BRIDE AND HAS PLACED HIS ANOINTING UPON OUR LIFE THAT THERE CAN BE A POWERFUL PEOPLE UPON THE EARTH. YOU SEE, I BELIEVE WE'RE HERE MORE THAN JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE AND AND TO HAVE A MARRIAGE AND TO HAVE CHILDREN AND TO HAVE A GOOD JOB. BUT WE ARE UPON THE EARTH TODAY TO PRODUCE THE LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND I BELIEVE THERE IS A PEOPLE TODAY THAT IS PRODUCING THAT. WHEN YOU GO TO WORK, YOU'RE PRODUCING JESUS CHRIST. IF YOU GO TO SCHOOL, YOU'RE PRODUCING THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. WHEREVER YOU MAY GO, YOU'RE PRODUCING IT BECAUSE SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. WE'RE NOT JUST A CHURCH MEMBER. WE ARE THE BRIDE. HIM. AND WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAVE the name change OF ABRAHAM WOULD CONDITIONED HIM FOR THE BODY CHANGE WOULD CONDITION HIM FOR THE PROMISED CHILD TO COME. AND SO WHAT ARE WE LIVING IN? BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY WE'RE LIVING IN THE BRIDE AGE. WE'RE LIVING IN THE RAPTURING AGE. SO WHAT IS IT? SINCE WE'VE RECEIVED OUR BODY OR RECEIVED OUR NAME CHANGE, NOW WE'RE CONDITIONED FOR A BODY CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING ON. WE'RE NOT WAITING ON BROTHER BRANDON TO COME AND RIDE THE TRAIL AGAIN. I BELIEVE HIS MESSAGE IS ALREADY RIDING THE TRAIL AGAIN THROUGH THE BRIDE. THE GREATER WORKS WASN'T THROUGH BROTHER BRANDON. THE GREATER WORKS IS INSIDE OF THE BRIGHT COMING OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHAT ARE WE WAITING ON, BROTHER JOSH? WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A GIFT. WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A SENSATION. WE'RE WAITING ONE MORNING BETWEEN 6:00 AND 9. THERE'S GOING TO COME A COLD SWEEP THROUGH OUR HOME AND IT'S GOING TO CATCH US AWAY AND WE'RE GOING TO STEP INTO OUR BODY CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WAITING ON. WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A GREATER GIFT. WE'RE WAITING ON THE COMING OF JESUS CHRIST. OH MY. WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED HIS APPEARING. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPEARING OF CHRIST AND THE COMING OF CHRIST. HE'S APPEARED. NOW WE'RE WAITING ON HIM TO COME AND WILL CATCH US AWAY IN A RAPTURE. YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS MORNING THAT GOD HAS CALLED US FOR A SPECIAL PURPOSE. BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US THAT GOD SAID A PEOPLE, not a church, that he's going to call for his name's sake. AND HE WOULD TELL US THIS isn't an an individual affair, right? He's not moving IN A BODY OR a group setting, BUT HE'S WORKING IN INDIVIDUAL LIVES. HE WOULD SAY HE'S NOT GOING TO CALL THE BAPTIST, BUT ONE OUT OF THE BAPTIST. NOT THE PRESBYTERIAN, BUT ONE OUT OF THE PRESBYTERIAN. HE WOULD SAY MANY TIMES, I'M NOT AGAINST THE PEOPLE. I'M AGAINST THE SYSTEM. RIGHT? SO HE'S CALLING NOT A DENOMINATION BUT HE'S CALLING INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A FORCED RELIGION BUT HE WOULD CALL YOUR NAME BY ELECTION AND THERE WOULD COME A WORD ACROSS YOUR LIFE ACROSS YOUR PATH AND YOU WOULD SAY I AM MEANT FOR SOMETHING MORE. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE'RE NOT JUST GATHERING UNDER A CHURCH A CHURCH NAME BUT WE'RE GATHERING UNDER THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AND BROTHER BRANDON, HE HE WOULD HAVE A A QUESTION GIVEN to him. Will there be or is there now a place for the bride together to live? Like when Moses led the children of Israel, THEN HE ANSWERS THE QUESTION. I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU. IT WAS JUST REVEALED TO ME. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. YES, SIR. THERE'S A PLACE FOR ALL THE BRIDE TO GATHER TOGETHER. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE IT'S AT? IT'S IN CHRIST. CORRECT? JUST GATHER IN THERE AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER. AIN'T THAT A POWERFUL THING? WE'RE NOT COMING UNDER A CHURCH BUILDING. WE'RE COMING UNDER JESUS CHRIST, WHICH IS THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. NOT JUST A WORD. IT'S A LIVING WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A LIVING WORD THAT IS CHANGING OUR LIFE, CHANGING OUR DESIRES, AND ONE DAY IT'S GOING TO CHANGE OUR BODY. IT'S A LIVING REALITY. THIS MESSAGE IS MORE THAN QUOTES, MORE THAN DOCTRINES, MORE THAN THEOLOGY. IT'S A REALITY THAT IS CHANGING LIVES. IT'S A REALITY THAT IS GETTING A HOLD OF PEOPLE AND PRODUCING THE LITERAL LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A PLACE THAT GOD is positioning us into. And that's WHY I BELIEVE IN A BRIGHT AGE BECAUSE WE'RE in Leodysia, but we're not a PART OF LEORA. WE'RE IN THE MOST EVIL AGE, but we're NOT A PART OF THE MOST EVIL AGE BECAUSE THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE. And brother, AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US IN EXODUS 8:22, "AND I WILL SEVER IN THAT DAY THE LAND OF GAN IN WHICH MY PEOPLE DWELL. NO SWARMS OF FLIES SHALL BE THERE, TO THE END, THOU MAYEST KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD IN THE MIDST of the earth. AND I WILL PUT A DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND THY PEOPLE. IN OTHER WORDS, HE THIS IS A PROCLAMATION TO TO TO the the people of of THE EGYPTIANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO COME PLAGUES THROUGH THE LAND, BUT I'M GOING TO SEVER OR SEPARATE, PUT A DIVISION BETWEEN MY PEOPLE AND THY PEOPLE THAT WHEN THE PLAGUES COME, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PARTAKE OF IT. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE GAN WAS IN EGYPT BUT THEY WERE SEPARATED. HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME THROUGH EGYPT, THEY WAS IN EGYPT BUT NOT A PART OF EGYPT. AND WE'RE IN LEOA BUT WE'RE NOT A PART OF LEOA. WE'RE IN A [screaming] BRIDE AGE. IT WAS ANOTHER VOICE AND COME OUT OF FOR MY PEOPLE, NOT ALL PEOPLE, MY PEOPLE. AND BE NOT PARTAKERS OF THEIR SINS AND OF THEIR PLAGUES. THERE'S A SEPARATION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE. AND BROTHER BRANDAM SAID, DIDN'T JESUS SAY IN THE LAST DAYS, MATTHEW 24:24, THE TWO WOULD BE SO CLOSE IT WOULD DECEIVE THE very genes predestinated, the elected ones, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE, ALMOST LIKE THE REAL THING. SEE, SO IN THE LAST DAYS, NOW YOU SEE IT'S WHEAT time now. IT'S GETTING HARVEST TIME. THIS IS NOT LUTHER'S AGE. THIS IS NOT PENTECOSTAL'S AGE. THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. AS MOSES CALLED A NATION OUT OF A NATION, CHRIST TODAY IS CALLING A CHURCH OUT OF A CHURCH. YOU SEE THE SAME THING IN TYPE taking them TO THE GLORIOUS ETERNAL PROMISED LAND. SO I BELIEVE THIS POSITION IS NOT SOMETHING TO COME, BUT I BELIEVE WE'RE IN THAT POSITION NOW. YEAH. YOU KNOW, AND brother Samuel, I had a brother tell me the other day that we're not in adoption YET. HE SAYS, "THE PENTECOSTALS HAVEN'T SEPARATED YET." I SAID, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE ADOPTION MEANS TO BE PLACED. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESS HAS COME TO DO WAS TO PLACE US. AND SO I BELIEVE WE'RE LIVING IN THE DAY WHERE GOD HAS PLACED US INTO OUR INHERITANCE. WE'RE NOT WANDERING AROUND IN THE WILDERNESS ANY LONGER. WE'RE NOT WANDERING AROUND TRYING TO GET THERE. WE HAVE ARRIVED. WE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN OUR POSITION. OH, IT WAS IT WAS IT would be CALEB THAT WOULD SAY, "GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. I'M NOT STUMBLING AROUND THERE NO MORE. I'M HERE. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. I DON'T CARE HOW OLD I MAY BE. THAT'S MY INHERITANCE. THAT'S MY PROMISE. OH MY. AND IF GOD, WE HAVE SOME MORE PEOPLE LIKE THAT TODAY. I SAY THE GATES OF HELL MAY COME AGAINST YOU, BUT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO PREVAIL. YOU MIGHT YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WEAK. YOU'RE TIRED. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE A TIRED CHRISTIAN, BUT YET JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE UNDER AN ANOINTING THAT IS PLACING YOU. I SEE WHATEVER GOD LEADS YOUR SOUL TO BELIEVE, CLAIM IT. HALLELUJAH. THIS AIN'T A PROSPERITY GOSPEL. BUT AS THE WORD COMES ACROSS AND IT STRIKES THAT SOUL AND YOU SAY AMEN. I SAY WHATEVER IT IS, YOU CAN HAVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE PRODALS COME BACK HOME, I SAY BELIEVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE REVIVAL IN YOUR HOME, I SAY BELIEVE IT. IF YOU WANT TO SEE MARRIAGES COME BACK TOGETHER, I SAY BELIEVE IT. WE'RE UNDER AN ADOPTION MINISTRY THAT IS PLACING US IN OUR INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT SOMETHING TO COME. BUT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES. OH MY. WE'RE SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES. AND AND WE'RE CONNECTED TO A LIFE SOURCE. BROTHER BRAND SAY THAT'S THE WAY CHURCHES ARE. THERE TOO MANY TODAY. WE'RE JUST TAKING THE name of Christian church pretending to be the bride when it's artificially. HE SAYS WE'RE NOT CONNECTED WITH CHRIST IN ANY WAY. WE'RE LIKE AN ARTIFICIAL TOOTH, an artificial arm, AN ARTIFICIAL EYE. SEE, IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ARTIFICIAL IF WE'RE JUST PUTTING IT ON. WELL, YOU CAN'T PUT ON CHRISTIANITY. YOU YOU HAVE GOT TO BE CONNECTED WITH IT. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE ARTIFICIALLY THE BRIDE, BUT I believe that we ARE CONNECTED TO THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND AND BROTHER BROWN, HE WOULD TELL US THAT THERE'S A SPIRIT BEHIND EVERYTHING, RIGHT? He says there's spirits behind music, spirits behind buildings. He says spirits behind church. And he says you can take on a CHURCH SPIRIT AND YOU WOULD HAVE THAT NATURE OR HAVE THAT ANOINTING. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE GOD HAS CALLED US TO COME UNDER A CHURCH SPIRIT. BUT TO COME UNDER HIS SPIRIT. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, "THIS IS THE uniting time." AND HE SAYS, "WHAT IS THE BRIDE UNITING WITH?" HE would say, "SHE'S UNITING WITH THE WORD." HE WOULD SAY, "HEAVENS AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY, BUT my word will never PASS AWAY. SHE'S UNITING HERSELF WITH THUS SAITH THE LORD." REGARDLESS OF WHAT ANY DENOMINATION OR ANYBODY ELSE SAYS, SHE'S UNITING HERSELF AND SHE'S GETTING READY. WHY? SHE IS THE BRIDE. THAT'S RIGHT. SHE'S UNITING HERSELF WITH THE BRIDEGROOM. AND THE BRIDEGROOM IS THE WORD. AND SO, AND THAT'S WHERE I BELIEVE WE ARE AT TODAY. And brother Brandon would tell us when we take on his name, he says, "We're no longer a church of the world, but we're the church of God. We're a church of Christ." And and he would stop and he would he WOULD SAY, "I DON'T MEAN THAT BY NAME. I mean that by nature." AND SO, IT'S MORE THAN A TITLE, BUT IT'S THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD. IT'S THE LIFE OF GOD AND AND THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NAME OF GOD. And and you brother I mentioned earlier brother Brown I'm going to PREACH A MESSAGE BECAUSE God provide a place of worship. And he would say that that in the place where my name is of Paul I will MEET THE WORSHIPPER THERE. NOT AT ANY PLACE BUT WHERE MY NAME IS THERE YOU CAN MEET ME THERE. MY ATTRIBUTES can be displayed to you. And and if YOU LOOK AT THAT WORD OR THE definition of name, IT MEANS REPUTATION, FAME OR GLORY. SO WHERE MY NAME IS GOING TO BE, THERE MY GLORY IS GOING TO BE THERE. MY REPUTATION IS GOING TO BE AND AND YOU CAN MENTION SOME PEOPLE'S REPUTATION or some people's name and it brings up a reputation. for anybody that that that THAT LIKE IN CONSTRUCTION. I'm an electrician by trade and and so you can mention a company's name and that brings up a reputation. You know, you can get the question, you know, of a good AC guy or a good plumber. You can mention the name and they say, "Oh, WE'VE USED HIM BEFORE." WELL, THAT NAME BROUGHT UP A REPUTATION. AND THE BIBLE WOULD SAY IN PROVERBS 22:1, A GOOD name is RATHER TO BE CHOSEN THAN GREAT RICHES. SO IN OTHER WORDS, A GOOD REPUTATION IS BETTER THAN RICHES. AND AS I WAS LOOKING AT THESE THINGS, THE BIBLE SAYS WE'RE BORN SPEAKING LIES. WE'RE SHAPING INIQUITY. SO WE WAS BORN WITH THE REPUTATION OF JUST A CHURCH ME SOMEBODY THAT'S GOOD FOR NOTHING. BUT AT THE NAME CHANGE, HE WOULD TAKE AWAY OUR REPUTATION AND WOULD GIVE US HIS REPUTATION. WHERE WE ONCE WAS A POWERLESS PEOPLE, BUT NOW WE'RE MORE THAN CONQUERORS THROUGH CHRIST. SO THAT NAME CHANGE WOULD CHANGE OUR REPUTATION AND WOULD CHANGE THE FUTURE THAT WE WAS WALKING UPON. YOU KNOW, CUZ UH WHENEVER GOD WOULD CHANGE ABRAHAM'S NAME, HE DIDN'T CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT SOUND BETTER. IT HE CHANGED IT TO ALTER THE FUTURE THAT HE WAS WALKING UPON. &gt;&gt; HE WOULD CHANGE THE COURSE THAT HE WAS WALKING UPON. AND THE BIBLE WOULD SAY, "IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ON MEN UNTO ME." IN OTHER WORDS, YOU MIGHT BE WALKING A DIRECTION, BUT IF THE WORD BE LIFTED UP, IT'S GOING TO DRAW YOU. IT'S GOING TO ATTRACT YOU. YOU REMEMBER THAT THE BROTHER BRANDMA TELL THE STORY OF THE FIVE SONS THAT THAT THAT ALL WENT into the military. Do y'all remember that STORY AND HOW THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY IN THEIR FAMILY THAT WAS EVER IN THE MILITARY? BUT THE OLDEST SON GREW UP, WENT INTO THE NAVY. SECOND ONE GREW UP, WENT INTO THE NAVY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FIFTH SON. ALL WENT INTO THE NAVY. AND THE PARENTS KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON BECAUSE WHAT MADE THE CHANGE? THEY WERE ON A DIRECTION OF BYPASSING THE MILITARY, BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING WOULD CHANGE THEIR DIRECTION. AND SO THEY STARTED TO INVESTIGATE WHAT MADE THIS CHANGE. THEY WOULD GO INTO THE THE BOYS'S BEDROOM AND WHAT WOULD BE ON THEIR WALL. IT WAS A PICTURE OF A SHIP UPON THE OCEAN. AND EVERY NIGHT BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED, THEY LOOKED AT THAT PICTURE. EVERY MORNING THEY GOT UP, THEY LOOKED AT THAT PICTURE. WHAT WAS IT? SOMETHING WAS LIFTED UP THAT WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION THEY WAS WALKING. [screaming] OH MINE, IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO ME. YOU MIGHT BEEN ON A DIRECTION OF SUICIDE. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON A DIRECTION OF A MARRIAGE FALLING APART, BUT A WORD WAS LIFTED UP ONE DAY. AND AS YOUR PASTOR WAS PREACHING, HE WAS LIFTING UP A REALITY. AND YOU WILL LOOK UP AND LIVE. YOU WOULD REALIZE THERE IS SOMETHING DRAWING ME. IT'S ATTRACTING ME. IT'S PULLING ME TO A REALITY. IF I BE LIFTED UP, I WILL DRAW ALL MEN. SO THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH ABRAHAM. THERE WOULD BE AN ATTRACTION OUT OF AND WOULD CHANGE THE DIRECTION THAT HE WAS UPON BY THE REPUTATION OF GOD. AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US WHAT THE NAME CHANGE WAS, RIGHT? It would BE ABRAM. AND THEN ELOHIM, THE LAST PART OF ELOHIM WOULD COME TO ABRAM AND IT WOULD BE ABRAHAM. WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS THAT SHOWING? IT WAS MAN HUMANITY AND DEITY COMING TOGETHER CHANGING THE COURSE OF HUMANITY TO THE LEADERSHIP OF DEITY. AND THAT IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THIS GENERATION. YOU'RE NOT JUST THE SON OF YOUR PARENTS BUT YOU ARE THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND HE'S PLACED HIS NAME IN YOUR HUMANITY. HE'S PLACED IT IN YOUR HUMANITY, IN YOUR FLESH THAT HAS ACHES AND PAINS. IN YOUR FLESH THAT HAS MIND BATTLES, IN YOUR FLESH THAT GETS TIRED, IN YOUR FLESH THAT DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU CAN TAKE ANOTHER STEP. DEITY HAS COME IN THAT HUMANITY IN THAT FALLEN FALLEN FLESH THAT HAS HAS ACHES AND PAINS AND IS PRODUCING THE COURSE THAT JESUS HAS FOR YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. SO, WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THE REPUTATION OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT ZAKIUS. THE BIBLE SAYS HE SOUGHT TO SEE WHO JESUS WAS. AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO JUST SEE THE BODY OF JESUS. HE WANTED TO SEE who Jesus was. He wanted to SEE THE THE REPUTATION THAT HE HAD. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE CUZ THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT JESUS, he would come TO TO TO ZAKIUS'S HOUSE AND HE WOULD LATER on leave ZAKIUS'S HOUSE. SO THE BODY LEFT, BUT THE REPUTATION REMAINED. THE GLORY OF JESUS WOULD REMAIN BECAUSE THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT ZAKIUS, HE WAS A TAX COLLECTOR, RIGHT? HE HE HE WAS A MAN THAT HE HAD DONE PEOPLE WRONG AND AND AFTER THAT GLORY WOULD COME TO HIS HOME, HE WOULD GO AND MAKE ALL OF HIS WRONGS RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE WILL DO. IT'S A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT CAN CHANGE DESIRES THAT CAN CHANGE THE COURSE THAT YOU ARE UPON. YOU SEE, IT'S THE GLORY OF THE LORD THAT HAS RISEN UPON US. THE THE THE THE THE REPUTATION OF THE LORD HAS COME UPON US IN THIS GENERATION. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE MOSES, HE WOULD WANT TO SEE GOD'S GLORY, [clears throat] EXCUSE ME, in Exodus 33:18. And he SAID, I BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME THY GLORY. AND HE SAID, I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE THEE, AND I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS, AND WILL SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW MERCY. SO WHAT'S HE SAYING HERE? THAT MY NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH MY ATTRIBUTES. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME WHERE I AM NOT JUST A GOD OF JUDGMENT, BUT I'M A GOD OF MERCY. I'M NOT JUST A GOD OF WRATH, BUT I AM A GOD OF GRACE. AND AND IT WAS AT THE PROCLAIMING of that name THAT THEY WOULD SEE THE ATTRIBUTES OF WHO GOD IS. AND AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME THROUGH the land of Egypt, right? AND WOULD STRIKE ALL OF THE FIRSTBORN. AND COULD YOU IMAGINE BEING PHARAOH? ANY GOOD LEADER WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD TRY TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. ALL THE FIRSTBORNS ARE DYING IN MY KINGDOM. WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE THEM? WHAT CAN I DO TO GET THE JUDGMENTS OUT OF MY HOME, OUT OF MY KINGDOM? BUT LITTLE DID HE KNOW THERE WAS A LITTLE THING CALLED HISSIP. BROTHER, THE BIBLE TELL US THAT THEY HAD TO GET HIP, RIGHT? DIP IT INTO THE BLOOD AND WOULD PUT IT OVER THE DOORPOST. BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT HISSIP WAS A COMMON WEED IN PALESTINE. SO LITTLE DID PHARAOH KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SO SIMPLE THAT COULD CHANGE THE JUDGMENT, TAKE AWAY THE JUDGMENT FROM HIS KINGDOM. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WASN'T REVEALED TO HIM. THE NAME OF THE LORD WAS A PROCLAIMED TO HIM. HE WAS UNDER JUDGMENT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, AT THE PROCLAIMING OF MY NAME, I'M GOING TO SHOW MERCY TO THESE PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE UNDER JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER BARON, TELL US WHAT DOES HIPCEPT TYPE IT TYPES FAITH, RIGHT? SOMETHING SO SIMPLE. AND WE'RE LIVING IN THE DAY OF JUDGMENT WHERE PEOPLE'S LOSING THEIR MINDS. SUICIDE IS TAKING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT. AND PSYCHOLOGISTS. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE ANSWER, TRYING TO FIND THE CURE TO KEEP PEOPLE. BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW THE PROCLAIMING OF THE NAME OF THE LORD IN THIS GENERATION HAS BROUGHT MERCY TO WHOM I [screaming] WILL BRING MERCY TO. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; OH HALLELUJAH. YOU MAY SAY, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN?" WELL, WHAT IS WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE LORD? BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US THAT THE PROCLAIMING, THE WORD INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD. SO WE'RE UNDER HIS NAME. THE WORD INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD. SO IN OTHER WORDS, WHILE ONE PEOPLE'S UNDER JUDGMENT, THE OTHER ONE IS UNDER GRACE. THE OTHER ONES IS UNDER MERCY. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHO I'M FALLING UNDER. NOT JUDGMENT, BUT UNDER GRACE. You believe it this MORNING THAT IT'S GRACE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY THAT IS CALLING CALLING US AND proclaiming the name of the Lord AND BROTHER BRANDON HE WOULD TELL US THAT THROUGH THE OLD TESTAMENT GOD WOULD HAVE TITLES right he would be the rose OF SHARON LILY OF THE VALLEY BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR HE WOULD SAY JEHOVAH GYRA OR THEY WERE ALL TITLES BUT WHENEVER CHRIST COME WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY I COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME IN OTHER WORDS. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S GLORY. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S REPUTATION. YEAH, THERE'S A STORM COMING. YOU REMEMBER THE ONE THAT SAYS, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." THAT SAME REPUTATION IS IN THIS BODY. PEACE BE STILL. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S GLORY. HALLELUJAH. LAZARUS, COME FORTH. WHAT WAS IT? THE FATHER'S [screaming] GLORY WAS IN INSIDE OF A BODY PRODUCING A GREATER WORK. OH, WHAT ARE WE LIVING UNDER TODAY? WE'RE LIVING UNDER THE GLORY OF THE LORD. THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN JESUS CHRIST TO SPEAK THROUGH A NATURAL STORM IS INSIDE OF A PEOPLE THAT CAN SPEAK THE SPIRITUAL STORMS. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH. I SAY PICK UP A WORD AND AS YOU SPEAK THAT WORD, IT HAS AN ANOINTING THAT CHANGE SITUATIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE GET ALL GET AWAY FROM NEGATIVE CONFESSIONS AND GET BACK TO A POSITIVE CONFESSION. YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING NEGATIVE, HE SAYS THAT'S THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE. GOD HASN'T CALLED US TO SPEAK A A DEVILISH LANGUAGE. HE'S CALLED US TO SPEAK A HEAVENLY LANGUAGE. WHAT IS THIS HEAVENLY LANGUAGE? THE WORD IS NIGH IN THE HEART AND EVEN IN THY MOUTH. THE WORD NIGH, IT MEANS AT HAND. SO THE WORD IS AT HAND. I SAY PUT THAT IN YOUR MOUTH. SPEAK THY WORD. INSTEAD OF NEGATIVITY, SPEAK SOMETHING POSITIVE. &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] COME ON NOW. [laughter] THAT NEGATIVE SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO HELP YOU. OH, I'M PREACHING NOW. THAT NEGATIVE SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO PULL YOU OUT OF DEPRESSION. IT'S NOT GOING TO PULL YOU OUT OF ANXIETY. THAT NEGATIVE SPEECH AIN'T GOING TO SAVE YOUR CHILDREN. BUT A POSITIVE GOSPEL WILL. A POSITIVE WILL. IT HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE SITUATIONS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is it, brother Josh? REMEMBER JOHN? GO TAKE THE BOOK. EAT THE BOOK. THEN YOU SHALL PROPHESY AGAIN. WHO IS THAT? A TYPE OF YOU AND I. WE'VE TAKEN THE BOOK. WE'VE EATEN THE BOOK. NOW WE'RE SPEAKING THE SAME WORDS THAT WAS INSIDE OF THIS BOOK. YOU BELIEVE that tonight OR THIS MORNING? OH MY. SO JESUS WOULD SAY, "I COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME." Excuse me. And and I think IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE BIBLE TELLS US that Jesus would look at THE PHARISEES AND WOULD say in vain, "Do you worship me?" TEACHING FOR DOCTRINE the tradition of men. So here they were worshiping, BUT YET THEIR WORSHIP WAS IN VAIN. AND THAT REALLY SPOKE TO MY HEART. I DON'T WANT TO BE WORSHIPING AND MY WORSHIP be in vain. I I don't WANT TO BE PAYING MY TITHES AND AND MY OFFERINGS and coming to church on a Thursday and upon a Sunday and my worship be in vain. And and you WANT TO KNOW WHY THE worship was in vain? Brother Brandham, HE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY HAD DISASSOCIATED THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO ANOINT THE WORD. HOW COME? BECAUSE THAT THROUGH THEIR TRADITION. SO BY WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT, THERE WAS DISASSOCIATING the moving OF THE SPIRIT TO ANOINT THE WORD. And and and that can happen IN A IN A MESSAGE CHURCH AS WELL WHERE YOU DO AWAY WITH THE MOVING OF THE SPIRIT AND ALL YOU HAVE IS A LETTER AND THE LETTER KILLTH, BUT THE SPIRIT BRINGETH LIFE. YOU SEE, WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A DEAD LETTER. WE'VE BEEN GIVING A LIVING WORD. AND SO AS WE COME UNDER THE LIVING WORD, WE'RE GIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT RIGHT AWAY. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, IF IT HAS TO CONVICT US, WE SAY, "YES, I WANT MY WORSHIP TO BE MET BY GOD." IF IT SAYS TO THROW THINGS OUT, WE SAY, "YES, I WANT MY WORSHIP TO BE MET BY GOD." AND AND WE'RE LETTING THE HOLY SPIRIT HAVE THE RIGHT AWAY IN EVERY SITUATION. AND AND AND I THINK IT'S A POWERFUL THING BECAUSE IN THAT MESSAGE, GOD GOD PROVIDED A PLACE OF WORSHIP. Brother Brandon would take that scripture in Deuteronomy. Don't worship in any OF THY GATES. BUT AT THE PLACE WHICH THE LORD SHALL place his name, THE LORD GOD SHALL CHOOSE to place his name. He says there you shall worship. and and and BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TYPE THAT OUT TO DENOMINATIONS THAT THE THE THE PEOPLE'S COMING TO GATES BUT it's denominational gates AND AND SO HERE HERE THE PHARISEES WERE SINCERELY worshiping but they were at THE WRONG ALTAR THEY WERE AT THE WRONG GATE THEY WERE AT THE ALTAR OF THEIR THEOLOGY OF THEIR TRADITIONS AND HERE WOULD COME THE RIGHT ALTAR WHICH WOULD BE JESUS SAYING I COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME SO THE PLACE THAT HE TOLD YOU TO WORSHIP HERE IN MINE. AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY? OH, YOU'RE A BE ELABUB. YOU'RE A FORTUNE TELLER. YOU'RE A PRINCE OF THE DEVILS. AND SO, HERE WAS THE PLACE OF WORSHIP, BUT YET THEY WERE AT ANOTHER PLACE. THEY WERE AT ANOTHER ALTAR. AND WHAT I THINK IS SO POWERFUL IS WHILE THE WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING TO ONE GROUP, YOU COULD LOOK AT MARY AND MARTHA. THEY WOULD HAVE A BROTHER CALLED LAZARUS. AND AND JESUS, HE WOULD BE FOUR DAYS LATE, RIGHT? AND HERE MARTHA WOULD CALL FOR JESUS TO COME. SHE KNEW IF HE WOULD COME, HER BROTHER COULD BE MADE WELL. BUT YET HERE, HERE JESUS WOULD WANT TO SHOW THEM THE AUTHORITY THAT HE WOULD HAVE. I'M COMING IN MY FATHER'S REPUTATION. AND SO HE WOULD ALLOW [screaming] LAZARUS TO GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE. HE WOULD SHOW UP. AND YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US THAT THAT THAT MARTHA HAD A RIGHT TO SAY, "WHY WASN'T YOU HERE? YOU WHY DIDN'T YOU COME? MY BROTHER WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND, AND YOU ALLOWED HIM TO DIE." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SHE HAD A RIGHT TO SAY THOSE THINGS. BUT SHE FORFEITED THOSE RIGHTS. AND INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT, SHE WOULD SAY THIS HERE. LORD, IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE, MY BROTHER WOULD NOT HAVE DIED. BUT I KNOW NOW [screaming] IF WHATEVER YOU ASK GOD, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE COME IN THE FATHER'S NAME, YOU'VE GOT THE REPUTATION, YOU'VE GOT THE GLORY, WHATEVER YOU ASK NOW, IT WILL [screaming] HAPPEN. SHE DID NOT COME UNDER A NEGATIVE SPEECH. EVEN THOUGH SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, SHE WAS STILL POSITIVE. I'M AT THE RIGHT PLACE OF WORSHIP. THE REPUTATION OF THE LORD IS HERE. AND I SAY, YOU MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH A ROUGH SITUATION, BUT REALIZE YOU'RE AT THE PLACE OF WORSHIP, NOT AT THE RIGHT CHURCH, BUT UNDER THE RIGHT ANOINTING, UNDER THE RIGHT WORD, AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS RISEN UPON THEE AND SHALL BE SEEN. LORD, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, WE MIGHT BE AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, BUT WE'RE AT THE SAME PLACE. BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US WHEN THE DEATH ANGEL WOULD COME THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT, HE SAYS THAT DEATH ANGEL COULD GO INTO ANY HOME. IT COULD GO INTO THE PALACE, BUT HE SAYS THERE WAS ONE PLACE THAT DEATH ANGEL COULD NOT GO TO. AND HE SAYS NOT ONE HOME, ONE PLACE. AND HE SAYS THAT'S WHERE THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB WAS. AND HE SAYS SO IS IT TODAY. THERE'S ONE PLACE THAT THE DEATH ANGEL, SPIRITUAL DEATH CANNOT COME INTO. AND HE SAYS THAT'S WHERE THE LIVING WORD IS. SO WE MIGHT NOT BE IN THE SAME LOCATION. I MIGHT BE IN OKLAHOMA. YOU MIGHT BE HERE IN OHIO. SOME MIGHT BE IN MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA. WE'RE NOT IN THE SAME LOCATION. BUT WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE IN CHRIST JESUS SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES WHERE THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS. [laughter] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH MY. SO BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY ABOUT MARTHA. HE SAYS LIFE AND DEATH CANNOT ASSOCIATE IN THE SAME CHANNEL. SO HERE MARTHA WOULD SAY IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT HAVE DIED BUT EVEN NOW AND SO THEY WOULD COME IN THE SAME CHANNEL. WHATEVER. OH MY I HOPE THIS IS MAKING SENSE THIS MORNING. SO THE WILL THAT JESUS HAD THE PURPOSE THAT JESUS HAD IN LETTING LAZARUS DIE MARTHA [screaming] WOULD COME IN TUNE WITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT GOD'S GOT A PURPOSE. AND AS YOU SPEAK A POSITIVE WORD, YOU'RE COMING IN LINE IN THE SAME CHANNEL THAT GOD HAD FOR YOU GOING THROUGH THAT. HALLELUJAH. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT JESUS WANTED TO TEST HER. HE WOULD SAY, HE WOULD SAY UNTO HER, I AM THE RESURRECTION AND THE LIFE. HE THAT BELIEVETH IN ME, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, NOT ON ME, BUT IN ME. HE SAYS, "YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ON HIM UNTIL YOU'RE IN HIM." RIGHT? AND HE SAYS, "BY ONE SPIRIT, WE'RE ALL BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY." AND HE SAYS, "NOT BELIEVING ON ME, BUT IN ME." AND SO HERE, BUT AS JESUS GOES ON TO SAY, "THOUGH HE WERE DEAD, YET SHALL HE LIVE." WHATSO AND WHATSOEVER liveth and believeth IN ME SHALL NEVER DIE. BELIEVEST THOU THIS? AND SHE SAITH UNTO HIM, "YAY, LORD, I BELIEVE THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE SON OF GOD, WHICH SHALL COME INTO THE WORLD." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT SHE CALLED HIM BY THE RIGHT NAME. AND SO WHILE THE PRIESTS WERE CALLING HIM BE ELABUB AND FORTUNE TELLER AND PRINCE OF THE DEVIL, SHE REALIZED THIS IS THE PLACE OF WORSHIP. AND SHE WOULD CALL HIM BY THE RIGHT NAME AND WOULD SAY, "LORD, YOU'RE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD." AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS WHENEVER HE WHENEVER SHE SAID THAT, HE SAID, "OH, BROTHER," EVERYTHING WAS READY TO SPARK OFF RIGHT THEN AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD STOP AND WOULD SAY THIS AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. OH, HALLELUJAH. SO ONCE SHE WOULD SAY, "YEAH, LORD, I BELIEVE YOU'RE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THE COGS THEY STARTED TO SPIN THEN AND WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY? HE WOULD BE CRYING AND THEN HE WOULD WIPE AWAY THOSE TEARS AND WOULD SAY WHERE HAVE YOU LAID HIM? WHERE HAVE YOU LAID HIM? ROLL AWAY THE STONE. [screaming] ROLL AWAY THAT STONE. AND HE WOULD SPEAK THE VOICE OF LIFE IN THAT SITUATION. HOW COME SHE RECOGNIZED WHERE SHE WAS AT WAS [screaming] THE GLORY OF THE LORD? OH, AND I BELIEVE THIS BRIDE HAS RECOGNIZED THIS IS MORE THAN A WORD, BUT THIS IS WHERE THE GLORY OF THE LORD IS. AND THAT GLORY IS HERE TO MOVE IN EVERY SITUATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU MIGHT GOT LOVED ONES THAT IS NOT IN A NATURAL TOMB, BUT IN A SPIRITUAL TOMB. GOD IS STILL COMING TO TOMBS AND SPEAKING THE VOICE OF RESURRECTION AND BRINGING LIFE TO TEENAGERS, BRINGING LIFE THE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. I BELIEVE YOU CAN BRING THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD TO THAT SITUATION. &gt;&gt; OH MY LAZARUS DIDN'T BRING JESUS TO THE TOMB. MARTHA DID. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. HE KNEW HOW TO RESPOND. IF THERE'S A SIN THERE, THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND. BUT IT WAS BECAUSE OF A LOVED ONE THAT WAS SAVE. BUT EVEN NOW, LORD, WITH HER POSITIVE CONFESSION WOULD BRING THE GLORY OF THE LORD TO A LOVED ONE'S HOME. And I BELIEVE WE CAN STILL BRING MIRACLES. COME ON. WE CAN STILL BELIEVE AND GOD CAN SAVE LOVED ONES BECAUSE OF YOUR CONFESSION, BECAUSE OF YOUR FAITH, BECAUSE OF YOUR UNWAVERING FAITH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MY SO, AT THE PROCLAIMING OF MY NAME, I'M going to SHOW MY GLORY. AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE WE got a portion of God revealed to us. But all OF WHO WHO GOD WAS, ALL OF HIM HAS BEEN REVEALED. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT THE GOD IN EVERY EVERY GENERATION would bring a new part of the word. And and he he would he would be building up. And brother Brandon would SAY THIS HERE, LIKE MY BODY WAS BUILT. I'M TOLD IT STARTED in the spine, BUT IT WASN'T ALL SPINE. IT WENT FROM that to ribs, from lungs to hands to arms to feet and so forth until it came out to be the person that I am. And so, AND HE'S GOING ON TO TELL US THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ALLOTTED word for each generation. So, just like the NATURAL BODY WAS BUILT UP PIECE BY PIECE, SO WAS THE SPIRITUAL BODY. WE HAD A WORD. We had we had Luther. We had sanctification. WE HAD PENTECOST. BUT NOW HERE WE ARE WITH THE CAPSTONE WHERE THE HEAD HAS COME TO THE BODY WHICH IS BRINGING THE INTELLIGENCE. OH, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS YOU CAN'T GO ANY HIGHER THAN THE EYES. RIGHT? HE SAYS THE EYES IS A PROPHETIC SIGHT AND WE ARE A PROPHETIC PEOPLE. SO WE'RE NOT LIVING AT THE BASE. WE'RE NOT LIVING JUST UNDER SANCTIFICATION OR OR WESLEY OR LUTHERAN, BUT WE'RE LEAVING IN THE DAY WHERE CHRIST HAS LIFTED US UP INTO HEAVENLY PLACES WHERE WE CAN SEE OUR FUTURE, &gt;&gt; WHERE WE CAN SEE THAT ALL THE ALL THAT GOD PROMISED ME I CAN OBTAIN. OH MY. SO HERE WE ARE. BUT AS I MENTIONED THIS quote earlier, brother Brandham says, "And the NAME IS IN THE WORD BECAUSE HE IS THE WORD." AMEN. WHAT IS HE THEN? THE WORD INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE NAME OF GOD. NO WONDER FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU. BUT MY FATHER WHICH IS IN HEAVEN. FLESH AND BLOOD HAS NOT REVEALED THIS TO YOU. BUT HE SAYS MY FATHER AND WHICH IS IN HEAVEN HATH REVEALED THIS TO YOU WHO I AM. AND UPON THIS ROCK I BUILD MY PLACE OF WORSHIP AND THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T SHAKE IT DOWN. AMEN. OH CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. STAND IN FIRM FOUNDATION ON JESUS Christ alone. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STANDING UPON TODAY is Jesus Christ alone. And and brother Brandham, he would TELL US THAT IN MY NAME you shall cast out devils. HE WOULD SAY THAT'S THE FATHER'S NAME. HE SAYS HE PUT HIS NAME IN JESUS CHRIST. AND AND THEN HE WOULD SAY THIS here in him in there he meets to heal the sick. IN HIM AND THERE HE MEETS TO SAVE THE LOST. HE MEETS the field WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND THAT'S THE ONLY PLACE GOD MEETS HIS PEOPLE FOR WORSHIP. AND I LOVE THAT QUOTE, EXCUSE ME, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST COMING UNDER JUST A a rep just coming UNDER A A VAIN SOMETHING trying to work something out. BUT IT'S A PROMISE WHERE TWO OR THREE are gathered IN MY NAME. I WILL BE IN THEIR MIDST. THE BIBLE SAYS THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER AND THE RIGHTEOUS RUN INTO IT AND ARE SAVED. THESE ARE LITTLE NUGGETS THAT GOD GAVE US ALONG THE WAY SAYING ONCE YOU FIND MY PLACE OF WORSHIP, ONCE YOU CAN COME UNDER MY NAME, ALL [screaming] OF THESE PROMISES CAN BE REVEALED UNTO YOU. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE name of the Lord is not just a tower, &gt;&gt; but it's a strong tower. CUZ THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TOWER AND A STRONG TOWER. CUZ I DON'T WANT TO BE JUST IN A TOWER. [screaming] BUT LET ME BE IN A STRONG TOWER. YOU REMEMBER IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, I BELIEVE IN THE BOOK OF JUDGES, there was a AN INVADING ARMY THAT WOULD COME COME INTO the land and and THEY WERE WIPING OUT ALL OF THE WARRIORS, WIPING OUT ALL of the men. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THERE WAS A group of people that would run into a tower. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT that the king and his and his and THIS INVADING ARMY WOULD COME TO THAT TOWER and would destroy it. Would kill everybody that was in it. Destroy the tower. BUT THE BIBLE THEN WOULD TELL US THAT THERE WAS A CERTAIN WOMAN. NOT JUST A WOMAN, BUT A CERTAIN WOMAN. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT SHE WOULD GO INTO A STRONG TOWER. NOT JUST A TOWER, BUT A STRONG TOWER. AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THAT THE KING WOULD COME TO THIS TOWER, THE STRONG TOWER, AND WOULD BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE DOOR LIKE HE DID THE OTHER TOWERS, BUT HE COULD NOT BREAK the door down. AND WHAT WOULD JESUS SAY? I AM THE DOOR. &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN COME TO COME IN UNLESS THROUGH ME. SO HERE THIS INVADING KING WAS TAKING OVER HOMES, TAKING OVER CHURCHES, TAKING OVER FAMILIES, BUT HE CAME AGAINST THE STRONG TOWER. AND THE BIBLE SAYS HE COULD NOT GET IN BECAUSE OF THE DOOR. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE CERTAIN WOMAN, SHE WILL LOOK OUTSIDE OF [screaming] THE TOWER AND WOULD GRAB A PIECE OF A MILLSTONE AND WOULD THROW IT DOWN AND WOULD DESTROY THAT KING. OH, WHAT AM I SAYING? SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THE WHOLE MILLSTONE, BUT WHAT SHE DID HAVE, SHE WOULD THROW OUT OF HEAVENLY PLACES. AND THAT WORD UH WOULD BE AN ANOINTED WORD WHICH WOULD DESTROY THE ENEMY THAT WAS TAKEN OVER. AND WE HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A STRONG TOWER. YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ALL OF THE MESSAGE. YOU MIGHT NOT COULD BE ABLE TO QUOTE ALL OF THE SCRIPTURE, BUT TAKE A PIECE OF THAT MILLSTONE. TAKE A PIECE OF THAT WORD AND THROW IT OUT OF HEAVENLY PLACES. AND THE DEVIL THAT IS DESTROYING MARRIAGES CAN NEVER TOUCH YOUR MARRIAGE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE ONE THAT HAS TAKEN OVER CHURCHES CAN NEVER TAKE THIS CHURCH BECAUSE WE ARE IN A STRONG TOWER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT JUST A TOWER BUT A STRONG TOWER &gt;&gt; AND HE IS THE DOOR. OH MY. IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT JESUS WOULD SAY, "I AM THE GOOD SHEPHERD." NOT JUST A SHEPHERD, BUT A GOOD SHEPHERD. AND YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, HE WOULD TELL US THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A hireland and a shepherd. HE SAYS THE HIERLAND IS WITH THE SHEEP DURING THE DAY, BUT AT NIGHT TIME HE GOES INTO HIS HOME. BUT HE SAYS THE SHEPHERD, HE'S WITH THE SHEEP DURING THE DAY, BUT AT THE NIGHT TIME HE BECOMES THE DOOR. IN OTHER WORDS, CHRIST SAYS, I'M THE GOOD SHEPHERD. I'M WITH YOU IN THE GOOD TIMES, BUT IN THE BAD TIMES, I AM STILL WITH YOU. I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU. I'LL NEVER FORSAKE YOU. I'LL BE WITH YOU EVEN IN YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M THE GOOD SHEPHERD. I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR THE SHEEP. SO, WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE KEEPING OUR EYES SINGLE UPON THE WORD. BUT THE WORD IS ALSO KEEPING HIS EYE ON US. THE LORD IS ALSO WATCHING US, SAYING, "I'M NEVER GOING TO LEAVE YOU. I'M NEVER GOING TO FORSAKE YOU." BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A STRONG TOWER. NOTHING CAN GET TO YOU UNLESS it comes through me. &gt;&gt; YOU MAY SAY, "THEN WHY AM I IN THIS GREAT TRIAL?" BECAUSE HE KNEW YOU COULD handle it. You remember Job? Hey, THE DEVIL COULDN'T EVEN GET TO JOB UNTIL GOD SAYS, "HEY, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOB?" HE SAYS, "OF COURSE, BUT I CAN'T GET TO HIM. YOU'RE THE DOOR." &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] I'M PREACHING NOW. HE SAYS, "I CAN'T GET TO HIM. YOU'VE GOT A HEDGE AROUND HIM." HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO TOUCH HIM, BUT I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE IN HIM BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST SOME WEAKLING. HE'S A MATURED SON OF GOD. YOU CAN COME AGAINST HIM, BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO CURSE MY NAME." AND SO IS IT TODAY. HE'S THE DOOR. HE SAYS, "OKAY, YOU CAN TRY IT. YOU CAN GO AND TRY TO DISCOURAGE HIM, BUT AS HE COMES AGAINST YOU, YOU SAY, "GREATER IS HE THAT IS [screaming] IN ME THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD." SATAN, I'M NOT JUST IN A TOWER. I'M IN A STRONG TOWER. [applause] I'M NOT JUST A CHURCH MEMBER. I AM THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M NOT JUST A SON. I'M AN ADOPTED SON. I'M AN ADOPT A DAUGHTER PLACED IN MY INHERITANCE. I SAY THIS MORNING, GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN YOU THAN HE THAT IS IN THE WORLD. WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, YOU ARE AN ADOPTED SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THAT HAS BEEN SEATED IN HEAVENLY PLACES. HEY, BROTHER BAM SAYS WHEN YOU SPEAK THE WORD, IT'S AS GOOD AS DEITY SPEAKING. WHY IS IT? IT IS DEITY SPEAKING. IT'S THE SAME WORD THAT SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." IS THE SAME WORD THAT CAN FLOW THROUGH YOUR LIPS. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HEY, we're not just speaking our own thoughts. Come on now. WE GOT TO KEEP THAT IN CONTEXT, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT JUST SPEAKING OUR OWN THOUGHTS. WE'RE SPEAKING THE WORD. WE'RE SPEAKING THE ANOINTED WORD. AND THAT STILL HAS AN ANOINTING. &gt;&gt; That's the way I BELIEVE IN PREACHING THE MESSAGE. THAT'S WHY I'M SO THANKFUL FOR MEN LIKE BROTHER SAMUEL THAT'S NOT GOING TO PREACH THEIR OWN IDEAS. THAT AIN'T ANOINTED. BUT THIS WORD IS ANOINTED. &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] MY. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE WE CAN COME UNDERNEATH IT and expect the greater works. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's a place that we're living in and and we're and we're and we're walking in. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT GOD HAS HAS PLACED HIS NAME UPON us and and would tell us THAT THAT I'VE CALLED YOU FOR THIS SPECIAL PURPOSE. You can look at First Peter 2:9. The Bible says, "But you are a chosen generation, A [snorts] ROYAL PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, a peculiar people, that you SHOULD SHOW FORTH THE PRAISES OF HIM WHO HATH CALLED YOU OUT OF DARKNESS INTO HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT, WHICH IN TIMES PAST WERE NOT A PEOPLE, BUT ARE NOW THE PEOPLE OF GOD, WHICH HAD NOT OBTAINED MERCY, BUT NOW HAVE OBTAINED MERCY." WHAT'S THAT MEAN? WE WERE NOBODY'S, BUT NOW WE'RE SOMEBODY. WE WERE A NOBODY. WE WEREN'T A PEOPLE. BUT NOW WE'RE NOT JUST A PEOPLE. WE'RE THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU REMEMBER BROTHER BROWN TELL US THAT THERE'S THREE NATIONALITIES of people, RIGHT? HE SAYS WE COME FROM THE SONS of Noah, Ham, Sham, and Japheth, right? And he says that's the Jews, the Samaritans, and the Gentiles, right? And he says that the Jews WOULD GET THE MESSIAH SIGN whenever Jesus came to Philip, I believe, or Nathaniel, and would say before Philip called thee, I saw you on the fig tree. I saw you on THE TREE. HE SAYS THAT WAS THE MESSIAH SIGN TO THE JEWS. And he says then he would do the Messiah sign to the Samaritans, RIGHT? THE WOMAN AT THE WELL, RIGHT? YOU the one you're living with AIN'T EVEN YOURS, RIGHT? HE SAYS BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HIM. Even he even the woman at the well SAYS WHEN THE MESSIAH COMES, he's going to do THESE THINGS. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR THE MESSIAH. BUT THE GENTILES, BROTHER BRHAM SAYS, WERE ROMANS. THEY THEY WERE HEATHEN PEOPLE. THEY WERE WORSHIPING IDOL GODS. THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR THE MESSIAH. BUT IN THIS GENERATION, WHO DID THE MESSIAH SIGN COME TO? NOT THE JEWS, NOT THE SAMARITANS, BUT IT WOULD COME TO A PEOPLE THAT WERE NOBODIES. IN TIMES PAST, YOU WERE NOT A PEOPLE, BUT ARE NOW THE PEOPLE OF GOD. YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR ME WHEN I CAME THE FIRST TIME, BUT NOW YOU HAVE SEEN MY APPEARING. YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS GENERATION AND I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU. &gt;&gt; OH MY BROTHER BRANDON, I'M GOING TO SAY IN MANY PLACES, LORD, I CLAIM THEM FOR your glory. He says, I CLAIM THEM TO BE A JEWEL in your IN YOUR CROWN. I CLAIM THEM AS TREASURES OF THIS MESSAGE OR OF THIS GOSPEL. AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS HE DIDN'T JUST KEEP it for the local audience. HE WOULD SAY, "ALL THE ONES THAT WILL HEAR THIS MESSAGE," HE SAYS, "I CLAIM THEM." I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS JUST HIM SPEAKING WORDS. I BELIEVE THAT WAS A PROPHETIC WORD. I'M GOING TO CLAIM THE BRIDE. ALL THE ONES THAT HAS A ARE TO HEAR THIS WORD, I'M GOING TO CLAIM THEM. &gt;&gt; AND AS THE CLAIMS AS GOD CLAIMS YOU, ALL OF THE CLAIMS OF THE DEVIL is broke. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE CLAIMED BY GOD, YOU CAN'T BE CLAIMED by the devil. Right? You remember whenever you remember whenever Jesus he needed the the donkey to ride into Jerusalem, RIGHT? AND THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT HE WOULD TELL THE DISCIPLES, "GO INTO THERE. YOU'RE GOING to find A DONKEY THAT IS TIED UP." He says, "Loose him and bring him to me." AND IF ANY MAN ASKS YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING, TELL HIM, "I HAVE NEED FOR IT." AND SO, AS LONG AS HE WAS TIED UP, HE COULD NOT FULFILL THE PURPOSE OF JESUS. BUT ONCE JESUS WOULD CLAIM HIM, HE HAD TO BE UNTIED. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE MAY HAVE BEEN TIED DOWN BY A LOT OF THINGS, BUT ONCE THIS MESSAGE CLAIMED YOU, WHAT'S THE FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY DOING? THE PREACHING SAYING, "GOD HAS NEED FOR YOU. HE HAS NEED FOR YOU. HE HAS NEED FOR YOU." AND HE'S LOOSENING YOU AND WASHING YOU. OH MY. BY THE WATER OF THE WORD. AND AS YOU'RE BEING WASHED, YOU'RE BEING CUT FREE FROM EVERY CLAIM THAT THE DEVIL HAS. AND YOU'RE CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT IS THIS STAKING MAN'S FILTER? IT'S GIVING YOU A HOLY MAN'S TASTE. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. THIS FILTER, WHAT WOULD JESUS PRAY UNTO GOD? DON'T TAKE THEM OUT OF THE WORLD, BUT KEEP THEM FROM EVIL. AND HE WOULD SAY, SANCTIFY THEM BY YOUR WORD, AND YOUR WORD IS TRUTH. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A FAKING MAN'S FILTER. NOT TAKING YOU OUT OF THE EVIL, BUT TAKING THE EVIL OUT OF YOU. AND AS THE WORD CLAIMS YOU, ALL OF THE EVIL IS BEING PURGED OUT OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AND IT'S SANCTIFYING YOU AND CLAIMING YOU FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE'VE BEEN CLAIMED BY THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD IN THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Aren't you thankful YOU'RE CLAIMED? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HAVE THINGS WE'RE NOT PROUD OF. SOMETIMES we have scars that we don't like. WE HAVE HURTS THAT WE DON'T LIKE. We have we have THINGS IN OUR PAST WE'RE NOT PROUD OF. We have things in our future we're not proud of. But you know by the Brown tell us that word washed means to be loosed. &gt;&gt; Right? And here the word has come to wash us which means loosen us. IT'S COME TO SET US FREE. And you know but the Bible would tell us about Lazarus that whenever Jesus came and he says Lazarus come forth but the brand would tell us if he said come forth the general resurrection would have happened right but Jesus wasn't after everybody he was after Lazarus &gt;&gt; so he SAYS LAZARUS COME FORTH THAT WAS A CLAIMING NOT JUST FOR EVERYBODY BUT THERE'S A PREDESTINATED ONE IN THERE I'M GOING TO CLAIM HIM HE WOULD SAY LAZARUS COME FORTH AND SO HE WOULD BE BROUGHT TO LIFE RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But you know that's not the end of THE STORY. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS HE WAS STILL IN grave clothes. &gt;&gt; OH, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT? IT WASN'T JESUS GOING AND loosening the grave clothes. He would commission a five-fold ministry saying loose him AND LET HIM GO. SO THE SAME VOICE THAT WOULD BRING HIM TO LIFE NOW WAS COMMISSIONING A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY WITH THE SAME WORD, WITH THE SAME ANOINTING TO LOOSE LAZARUS. And oh MY, I BELIEVE THAT'S what the word does. When we come into a service like this morning or THURSDAY NIGHT, MAYBE A BIBLE STUDY OR WHENEVER WHENEVER THE WORD'S coming forth and your pastor's laboring under an inspiration, under an anointing, what he's doing is he's washing you. He's loosening you. And what's so incredible about that is that you can come with scars and leave out with no more scars. &gt;&gt; You can come in with hurts and leave healed. YOU CAN COME IN BROKENHEARTED. OH MY. HE'S COME TO HEAL THE BROKENHEARTED. HE'S COME TO TAKE AWAY TAKE AWAY THE MOURNING and give you a spirit of praise. Give you a spirit of take away the spirit of heaviness for the garment of praise to take away the mourning for the oil of joy. Oh hallelujah. That's what he's COME TO DO. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES we're hurt. We're human beings. &gt;&gt; You know, even the hardest of people are hiding sensitive issues in their hearts. Sometimes it's the hardest people, the ones that are hurt the most, &gt;&gt; right? And and I hope this is okay. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENS IS SOMETIMES SCARS AND HURTS lay in there and you can put the suit on, you can put your nice dress on and you can come and everybody thinks, man, that is a SAINTLY CHRISTIAN, BUT ON THE INSIDE YOU'RE HURTING. YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIFE. YOU'RE NOT A SINNER. BUT YET THERE'S STILL SOME GRAVE clothes that is holding the heart where where you've been hurt. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES UH LIKE TRUST ISSUES can come from a scar, can come from a hurt. Then you you get married and that trust issue is still there. It's because the devil's still trying to claim you, but the word can wash. &gt;&gt; The word CAN LOOSE. COMPLEXES CAN GO BACK TO A SCAR, go back to a hurt. Somebody can say something against you, call you fat or call you short, call you ugly, call you pretty, and then that can hurt a put a little hurt there on that heart, on that spirit man. And then that hurt can stay there and stay there and stay there and you're growing up. You grow up, you know, you can be married, have children, but yet that hurt is still there. And what that does, the devil has a foothold whenever we're still have a little bit of the grave clothes. &gt;&gt; But the word has come to wash. &gt;&gt; The word has come to loose. &gt;&gt; And you see, we're not perfect. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MISTAKES. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm just preaching a little bit this morning. You remember whenever Sarah [snorts] would be Sarahi, right? And the Bible says that God would change her name from Sarahi to Sarah. Brother Brandham says that was her princess name. And [snorts] you know what would happen after her name was changed? The Elohim would come to Abraham and would say at according to the time of life, you're going to have a baby. And here Sarah, not Sarahi, Sarah would be in the tent and would laugh. How can it be that that that me and my husband can have pleasure again when we're old? And the Lord was saying, "Why did Sarah laugh? NOT SARAHI. WHY DID SARAH LAUGH?" And Sarah would say, "I did not laugh." And he would say, "But you did laugh in your heart." &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS, "GOD WOULD HAVE STRUCK HER dead there, but first he would have to strike Abraham dead." &gt;&gt; It was after the name change &gt;&gt; that she was still making mistakes. AND SOMETIMES WE make mistakes and then that puts a puts a scar where where we don't feel worthy. We don't feel like we're not we don't feel good. We don't we don't feel like God's called us anymore. We don't feel like we're the bride of Christ. But little did Sarah know that in the the hall of fame, the hall of faith in the book of Hebrews, WHAT WOULD PAUL UH WHAT WOULD HE WRITE DOWN? Not by faith Sarah laughed, BUT BY FAITH Sarah counted HIM FAITHFUL. HER MISTAKE WASN'T THERE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THERE? HER FAITH AND HER name change. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] YOUR MISTAKE IS NOT IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. WHAT IS IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE IS YOUR NAME CHANGED. &gt;&gt; IS YOUR NAME. YOUR NAME IS ENGRAVED in the palm of HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT MAKE MISTAKES, BUT THAT DON'T DO AWAY WITH IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] PAUL DIDN'T SAY IN SARI BUT HE SAID SARAH EVEN THOUGH SHE MADE MISTAKES THAT DID NOT TAKE AWAY HER NAME change you remember PETER AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE PETER was zealous Peter WAS SOMEBODY OH SIMON MEANS ZEALOT right it's here the LORD YOU KNOW WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I the son of man am some say this some say that who do YOU SAY IT WAS PETER THAT WOULD SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE CHRIST THE SON OF THE LIVING God and Jesus would say that you're no longer going to be Simon But you're going to be Peter, right? So he would COME FROM A ZEALOT. SIMON MEANS ZEALOT. PETER MEANS LITTLE STONE. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT GAVE HIM THIS NAME CHANGE WAS THE ROCK OF REVELATION, RIGHT? Jesus would SAY, "UPON THIS ROCK, I'LL BUILD MY CHURCH." AND THE GATES OF HELL WON'T PREVAIL. But the Brandon SAYS, "WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT ROCK?" It wasn't Peter. It wasn't even the man Jesus. IT WAS THE REVELATION OF WHO JESUS WAS. AND SO WHEN PETER RECOGNIZED &gt;&gt; WHEN HE RECOGNIZED THE PLACE OF HIS WORSHIP, IT WOULD CHANGE HIS NAME. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WORD DOES THE LITTLE STONE COME FROM? THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; SO ONCE HE REALIZED THE ROCK, HE WERE IT WOULD OPEN UP A REVELATION. YOU'RE a part of the rock. &gt;&gt; You're a little stone. But you know what would happen? He would make a mistake. He would curse. He he would say he wouldn't even know Jesus. Now he's upon a upon a boat fishing naked. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? THERE WOULD COME SOME LADIES THAT WOULD COME AND AND WOULD COME TO THE SUPPLER AND THERE WOULD BE AND AND JESUS would meet them and would say, you know, uh, GO TELL MY DISCIPLES AND TELL SIMON, NO, go tell my little stone. &gt;&gt; GO TELL PETER HE FEELS LIKE A FAILURE RIGHT NOW. HE FEELS LIKE A NOBODY RIGHT NOW. HE FEELS LIKE HE'S HE'S BE HE'S SEND HIS DAY OF GRACE AWAY. HE FEELS LIKE HE'S BOUND FOR A TRIBULATION. HE FEELS LIKE THERE'S NO GRACE FOR HIM. BUT GO TELL HIM HE IS STILL A LITTLE STONE. TELL HIM HE IS STILL A PART OF [screaming] THE REVELATION. TELL HIM I HAVE STILL CALLED HIM. I'VE ELECTED HIM. I'VE CHOSEN HIM. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AND YOU MIGHT FEEL THAT WAY THIS MORNING. YOU MIGHT GOT SCARS. YOU MIGHT GOT HURTS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO WAY YOU'LL EVER BE LOVED. GOD WILL NEVER LOVE YOU. GOD WILL NEVER SAVE YOU. BUT YET, YOU'RE STILL A PART OF THE ROCK. YOU'RE STILL A PART OF THE THE ROCK OF REVELATION IN THIS GENERATION. &gt;&gt; OH, YOUR YOUR MISTAKES DON'T DEFINE YOU. &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. YOUR PAST DON'T DEFINE YOU. YOUR FAILURES DON'T DEFINE YOU. HOW DOES GOD SEE YOU? &gt;&gt; HEY, I'M JUST GOING TO PREACH A LITTLE BIT. HOW DOES GOD SEE YOU? &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, CUZ MANY TIMES WE LOOK AT OURSELVES THE WAY THE DEVIL LOOKS at us and WE FAIL TO SEE THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT US. YOU REMEMBER WHENEVER ELIJAH WOULD BE IN THE CAVE AND HE CRIES UNTO THE LORD, THEY'VE THEY they've tore DOWN YOUR ALTARS. THEY'VE DESTROYED ALL OF YOUR PRE ALL YOUR PROPHETS. AND WHAT WOULD THE LORD SAY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I STILL HAVE 7,000 THAT HAS NOT BOWED THEIR KNEE. HE WAS LOOKING AT THE SITUATION DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY GOD WAS LOOKING AT IT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE THINKING MAN'S FILTER. WHEN WE LOOK AT OURSEL, WE LOOK AT OURSEL THROUGH THE THE WAY GOD LOOKS AT US THROUGH GOD'S WORD. BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCEPTION OF OURSELVES, BUT GOD'S LOOKING AND SAYING, "WHAT do you mean? You haven't sent your day of grace away. YOU'RE NOT UNWORTHY. I MADE YOU WORTHY. YOU'RE NOT UNLOVED. [screaming] I LOVED YOU WITH AN EVERLASTING LOVE AND WITH MY LOVING KINDNESS. I HAVE DRAWN THEE." &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU REMEMBER IT WAS GIDEON. WHENEVER AN ANGEL WOULD COME TO GIDEON, IT WOULD SAY, "YOU'RE a mighty man of valor." The word valor means wealthy. That means wealth. AND HERE GIDEON LOOKS BACK TO THE ANGEL AND SAYS, "I'M THE LEAST OF MY FATHER'S HOUSE AND MY FAMILY'S POOR." AND THE ANGEL SAYS, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN? [screaming] I'M GIVING YOU A MESSAGE OF WEALTH. QUIT LOOKING AT YOURSELF AS A NOBODY AND LOOK AT YOURSELF THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU." &gt;&gt; HEY, I KNOW I'M SPEAKING TO SOMEBODY. YOU GOT TO QUIT LOOKING AT YOURSELF THROUGH THE EYES OF MISTAKES, THROUGH THE FILTER OF OF FAULTS AND AND FAILURES AND AND PAST SINS, SINS, AND AND HURTS AND MISTAKES. AND AND LOOK AT YOURSELF THE WAY GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU. &gt;&gt; OH MY. GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU AS PERFECT. GOD'S LOOKING AT YOU LIKE BLAMELESS &gt;&gt; and saying, "Devil, you may try, but you're going to be be the one that's judged for it." &gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE JUDGED FOR YOUR MISTAKES. THE DEVIL is &gt;&gt; oh the accuser of the brethren was cast down into the lake of fire and we condemned him by the word of our testimony and the blood of the LAMB OR WE CAST HIM DOWN BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB and the word OF OUR TESTIMONY. WHAT IS IT? WE MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH SOME HARD THINGS but the filter of God's word that's what's upon our lips. &gt;&gt; Not our mistakes. You know, as our musicians come this morning, I &gt;&gt; I remember a testimony &gt;&gt; at [snorts] Louisiana camp. I believe there was a young lady that had tried committing suicide and she would have scars upon her wrists and that was a hurt that the devil plagued her with. She never felt like she can worship, never felt like she can raise her hands and and the [snorts] freedom of worship. And she would always bring her hands down. And it was at Louisiana camp one year that while she was in the presence of God that something would come over her heart and she would lift up her hands and condemnation would come through her heart. What's everybody going to think? What are they going to think when they see those scars? What are they going to think whenever they see your wrists? They're going to look at you differently. And she would raise those hands regardless. [snorts] And as she was worshiping the Lord, she would look at her wrists and those scars were gone. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE VERY CONDEMNATION THAT WAS condemning her heart, she would break free out OF IT. &gt;&gt; SO, I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIME, &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THE SCARS WERE AFRAID TO CAN TALK to somebody about &gt;&gt; because what are they going to think of me? But you know, once whenever that scar is, how would I put it? Whenever the devil's exposed, he has no foothold in your life. &gt;&gt; Scars can be a foothold. Mistakes can be a foothold. BUT ONCE THAT'S CONFESSED, ONCE THE HEART, IF IT'S AN ELDER OR YOUR PASTOR, PASTOR'S WIFE, WHOEVER IT MAY BE, &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAM, SOMETHING HAPPENED WHEN I WAS A KID and and it's holding ME BACK. THEN WATCH there come a liberty in that situation. &gt;&gt; The devil loses its foothold. He likes to dwell in darkness and the secret of cover, right? BUT ONCE THAT'S EXPOSED, &gt;&gt; ONCE THE HEART is exposed, &gt;&gt; and then then there comes a light. Walk in the light. &gt;&gt; That's so true. &gt;&gt; I say this morning, whatever may be holding you back. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He's here this morning to break every claim. &gt;&gt; He's here to heal every hurt. &gt;&gt; It might be a natural hurt, spiritual hurt. It might be a preacher that hurt you, you know, but the word of the Lord is here to wash. &gt;&gt; Can y'all play something soft as we bow our heads this morning? [snorts] As our heads are bowed, maybe there there's somebody this morning that would say, "Brother Josh, I'm the one you were talking to this morning. [snorts] If you want to lift up your hands, the Lord sees Lord sees the hands. I've got scars. I've got hurts. I was hurt as a kid or hurt by a preacher. You You know the situation, maybe mistakes. Maybe you're trying to overcome, but you keep you keep falling down. And the devil's telling you, you're not worthy. You've sent your day of grace away. But let me say this. The word is here to wash. [snorts] It's here to loose. You may say, "I don't know what to do." Brother Josh, you know what I say? Brother Brandham says, "Lifting your hands is a sign of surrender." &gt;&gt; I say, "Lift up those hands." It's I'm surrendering the hurt. I'm surrendering WHATEVER IS TRYING TO HOLD ME BACK. I'M GOING TO look through the filter of God's word. I GIVE THE WORD SUPREME authority in my life. I GIVE THE HOLY GHOST THE RIGHT AWAY. Dear heavenly father, LORD, YOU SEE THE HANDS ALL OVER THE BUILDING. LORD, YOU SEE THE HEARTS. [snorts] LORD, sometimes we get bruised. We get hurt. But Lord, YOU YOU'VE COME TO heal the brokenhearted. YOU COME TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE. [snorts] And Lord, we're humans. Words hurt us. Actions hurt us, Father. But Lord, are you here to loosen us? Lord, you're here to break the binds of hidden sins. You're here to break the binds of the stronghold the devil has in young people. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe you're here right now to deliver a total deliverance. Lord, as we feel your presence near us, Lord, I ask that you would walk the aisles of the hearts of your children. [snorts] Lord, as I've Lord did my best to surrender to your will. [snorts] God, I ask that you would take the remainder of the service, Lord. [snorts] Touch the hearts in Jesus name. [snorts] Amen. You got a song.

Therefore, it's a perfect loosening. &gt;&gt; Not a jagged break, but a perfect break. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says whatever he loosens &gt;&gt; is perfect. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[cheering] Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a privilege it has been &gt;&gt; to once again set in heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Be washed by the water of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. How powerful it is that it's the anointing as of the word of God in this hour. It changes conditions. &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Genesis 1. That's why it's so that's why it's so powerful in the preaching the word for the season &gt;&gt; in this moment in this hour. It gives the grace for the people to rise. &gt;&gt; You see, because we're living in a time when there is no ceiling, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There is no ceiling. It's going on up into rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the the headstone, the capstone has come. It's rising on up into him in all things. We're not called to a station. We're not called just to a point. There's not another message to come. We're living in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is why a word is ministered for us to be able to rise into all that God has for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's powerful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; We we all know what what that is. When there's a negative, we see it. You can see it all around you. you can get on and you know sometimes you can those of you that got social media and whatever more and you can it's no wonder like but they say in this day the amount of depression and everything else that it is people can get on there and they just get to looking at somebody else's feed and they get down &gt;&gt; but there's there's a better report. &gt;&gt; These are things that in this hour it really don't take a lot of rocket scientists just simple things look at the right source. &gt;&gt; Amen. tune out the other things and tune in on the Lord. Amen. And I believe God I believe God zeros our hearts in right into his word. And you say, "Brother Samuel, is that really all that's needed?" Let me tell you something. Inside of Jesus Christ is the answer for all of life's questions. &gt;&gt; God didn't send this message is not an addition to the Bible. This message is the Bible revealed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not an added book. That's why when people say, "Well, we're going to get people to Christ and then we'll get them to the message." They've missed the They've missed what the message is. The message is Christ. &gt;&gt; It's God that's revealed himself to you and I to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. And what a comfort it brings to our heart. I I tell you right here, right here this morning, whatever you've come in here with on your heart and let the word of God that has just come to just so lift and push back every cloud of doubt and everything about whether you're worthy or you're not worthy. The word of God is what makes you and I worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how you walked in here. It's how you walk out of here. &gt;&gt; It's a choice that's been made. The Lord, I receive your word. And I I tell you that just kept ringing in my heart as the brother was preaching. Even now &gt;&gt; even now. You know sometimes you can I can talk with sometimes individuals and people even situations that's outside of this this church and you begin to talk with a person and you wonder do you have any hope or any outlook for the situation that even you're working with? But I'll tell you, this is what I simply believe that the grace of God has no limitations. &gt;&gt; I love how Brother Bram said it. He said, "Soververeign can do what sovereign wants to do. &gt;&gt; Nobody tells sovereign what to do. &gt;&gt; There's no limitations to God's grace." &gt;&gt; So, what are you saying, brother Samuel? Whatever the need is upon your heart, &gt;&gt; there's no limitations for God meeting that need. You can just say, "Lord, just remedy everything. If there's anything in me, Lord, that would be in any way out of line with that. Remedy it all so I can look with a clear expectation so that even as I go to look tomorrow morning or today after church, my expectation just continues to grow." And you watch how God will just continue to channel that word. God will continue to minister because his word, it's coming to pass. &gt;&gt; I could say it like this. His word's materializing. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're here. I'm here. His word's materializing. This is as the prophet said, Elohim materializing in a body of believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it's in simplicity. It's in such simplicity. It's actually looked down upon. It's despised. And but yet, it's in such simplicity how God is working. And I love how the Lord took it right there through Brother Josh. It's God walking right with you into the school. It's God walking with you right into the workplace. It's God right there. Listen, you are the greatest miracle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the greatest miracle. He said where God can take a person that the dogs wouldn't even howl their name. &gt;&gt; He said but you let the presence of God come into that person's life, it changes their life, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And like somebody can say about your name and they remember you a certain way and they they bring up that name. Are you talking about so and so? Then they'll ask for the surname. But once the testimony is just meet them, just talk with them, &gt;&gt; just get with them a little bit. Then you realize, wait a minute, &gt;&gt; what I used to know I it's the same old shell, but what's moved into this into this house is a different person. [laughter] Amen. There's a different reputation going on. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. The glory of God being revealed. Oh my. It's not us. It's not you changing you. It's the word of God that we're receiving. It's changing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where our confidence is at, isn't it? Our confidence has been taken away from any church, from any idea. Our our confidence is in Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't you love him this morning? It's been so good to be here in his presence. And I'll tell you, just keep looking. Just keep with that expectation with whatever the need and whatever it is, keep looking. God is faithful to fulfill what he has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that? &gt;&gt; If something comes along, it tries to take away from that a discouraging thought or even something you see, do you know what you need to do? Just take that seaweed out of your mouth and keep looking to the Lord Jesus Christ. That's what you need to do. Keep anything, any distraction comes a late, just push that right. And you know what you call that? A lying vanity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's Why? Why is it lying? It could seem so real, but when God's promise has been made real, that's a lying vanity. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Abraham's crookedness may have got more real of a morning, but he called it a lying vanity. &gt;&gt; And we're Abraham's seed. [laughter] Amen. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord who against hope believed in hope that he might be the father of many nations. Amen. Brother Josh, thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. Wonderful. [applause] Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We have been [cheering] We have thoroughly been blessed. What a masterpiece. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful word from the Lord. Amen. This morning. Amen. So, you take our greetings back to Brother Wendle. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your mom, your family, church. Amen. Let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. And my we have so much to be thankful for. Heavenly Father, oh dear Lord Jesus, how we are so so grateful for your mercies, Lord. Oh Lord, truly they are new every morning. And what a refreshing it is, Lord, as we come into your presence, Lord Jesus. We have been gathered, Lord, to your table, Lord.

Lord, it's where you come, Lord, and and breathe upon your children. Lord God, you speak your word, Lord, of over our lives. And that word is the anointing. It changes. It changes the atmosphere. So, heavenly father, even right here this morning, for every need, every request, maybe someone's praying about a loved one, maybe there Lord, whatever that request is, no matter how it might look, may that be the words like Mary said or Martha, even now, Lord, even now.

And we are we are so thankful, God, for the great diversity, Lord, that you have placed among us. And that, Lord, a life that would yield that you could step down and speak to our hearts, Lord.
