yes you have more when my back was against the wall and it had looked as if it was sober Lord you you potato I'm standing here when I'm standing here only because you made [Music] me understand only because you may well tonight I'm sending only because [Music] [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord amen it's nothing but the truth that's why we're standing is because of him he made a way we're just sold them so thankful to be gathered here tonight and for the different visitors that's come and ministering brothers and it just always means so much to us so much to have your brother Jonathan brother Paul the different ones are here God bless you amen we certainly are just just delighted most of all that the Lord Jesus is here because without him it would be just a gathering of people but where he is he promised he would gather in the midst of two or three that are gathered together in his name and I believe we're gathered in his name amen we've not we've not gathered by our own accord our own Works our own will but it surrendered hearts and lives to the will of God where would we be tonight if his grace had not found us oh my God I just uh just want to just say tonight it's just so good to to be here and uh maybe if you could just turn around and shake hands with one another greet one another in Christian love and we'll let you just have your seats just for a few moments praise the Lord [Music] brother Paul will you come and just sing just seeing something that's on your heart brother Nathan you'll be able to come when brother Paul is singing but I'm gonna it just um just some things you know as you come into a meeting and you know there's always a part of expectation and you look at and how brother Branham gave so many directions of things of even how we come into a meeting you know he spoke about how that sometimes he said our meetings are perceived as being odd or strange and he says the only thing we do he said is we just come and present ourselves we don't try to figure anything out or try to make anything happen that's the beauty of it we don't have to make anything happen all we have to do is surrender to him he's already made a way and we just want him to come and just pass by our way because just one word from him is all that's needed and I just kept this this this quote and brother Ben will say it many different times and I just kept looking and these just kept bubbling up in my heart throughout the week and just thinking of how when brother Branham would admonish Us in the scriptures even he would take that scripture you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not he said he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed and get out here on some other kind of faith and but move out in big things big things is just as easy to receive as little things so whatever the need is whatever the obstacle the opposition let me just tell you tonight Satan's a liar and if he's standing there and trying to put up a front on ground that God has given to you just take the side with the word as the word exposes him just stand on the side of the word and you watch the word dismantle every argument and every tongue and every discrepancy that's tried to be raised and you take what belongs to you [Music] the big things is just as easy to receive as little things and he says could you imagine talking about exhausting God's love and power and beneficiaries for you and then he talks about a little fishy being in the middle of the ocean I love this simplicity he said well you know could you imagine that little fishy saying wait a minute I better consider this I I better drink this water sparingly because it might run out brother Brahman says that could be done more easily than you could ask too much of God it's more possible for a fish to drink up the ocean it's more possible than for you to exhaust almighty God I say Amen we've come here to draw on the Fountain of Life and this the fountain that is open in the House of David he's here amen for whatever the need is he's here to minister attorneys let's just draw and I don't matter what it is just ask God for big things put it on your heart and as God comes right through the ministering of the word just say I take it Lord if something strikes your heart just make it right right there and go on and receive the blessings of God Amen I want to just say it's a blessing to have brother brother Nathan and sister Rebecca and family brother Philip and brother Nathaniel and and sister Ruthie amen they've certainly been a great blessing to our lives and we're brother Nathan and I had met there about four years ago and just to become good friends and I know that you will will be blessed amen I just have appreciated our brother in his ministry and we just want to pull on the gift of God whatever whatever vessel God uses we want to recognize him because that's what's important is to recognize him God has a many different variety of many different bouquet but we just want to recognize him blue flowers red flowers yellow flowers but it's all flowers we just want to recognize Jesus because if we can just recognize him and touch him well everything else is settled amen so we just love you and appreciate you remember tomorrow morning the service will be at 11 and then we have the fellowship dinner after that and Brother Paul's good to have you here and you just sing what's on your heart and then brother Nathan will just come and take the pulpit brother Nathan right after that God bless you to say that in the Midnight Hour there'll be virgins who hear the great cry holy cometh rise and trim your last hit bridegroom is now some discovered they were lacking the horse they were empty with no light to see so I come and fill me with your spirit keep me burning for you is [Music] [Music] there is a Virgin by bird in the midnight [Music] sometimes I really get to wondering why it's a struggle to get down and pray I feel the spirit of complacency we're surrounded by the darkest days but I am running with a burning desire I'll keep holding up this light of mine and I'm working day and night with the words to hold the promise it is time for us to rise and shine foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but in the Midnight Oil times I really get to wondering why it's a struggle to give down and pray I feel the spirit of we're surrounded by the darkest days oh I'm running with the burning desire I'll keep holding up this slide of mine and working day and night with the ones who hold the promise it is [Music] [Applause] midnight on [Music] My Level [Music] I will shine through the night the world I must be lost [Music] but in the midnight [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] there is a virgin right burn in the midnight on [Music] praise the Lord [Applause] amen you love the Lord tonight amen what a privilege to be here tonight amen with Believers of like Precious Faith certainly appreciate each and every one and certainly appreciate the presence of the Lord here tonight and amen [Music] amen I thought while we had brother Paul up here we're just using a little bit more and you help me sing this tonight I'm sure we all know it oh I'm not on any ego trip I'm nothing on my own Lord I made mistakes often slip common flesh and Bone oh but I'll prove someday just what I say Moana of a special kind for when he was on the cross while I was on his mind is that your testimony tonight oh yes he knew me yet he killed me he he Glory makes the heavens oh I was so one Worthy [Music] of such Mercy but when he was on the cross why I was all here smile let's go back to Calvary tonight all there was a look of Love upon his face there were thorns on his head his blood ran down that's far [Music] stained it crimson red will go his eyes they were all on the crowd that day I know Jesus look ahead in time for when he was on the cross for you and I we were on his mind yet with all my faults yes [Music] [Music] such Mercy when he was on the cross oh I was on his mind praise the Lord aren't you thankful for that tonight he was thinking of you he was thinking of me I bless you brother Paul appreciate that and my good to be here tonight certainly appreciate brother Samuel's invitation appreciate the warm welcome and feel right at home tonight he said that's that's good now brother Paul I appreciate you coming and being here in the service and I I remember meeting him when I was a little boy but these two brothers over here the first time I met them was byc 2019 and the way we met each other was we all three kind of met in a prayer line there was a sister that was having a demonic manifestation there and all three of us got to her and began to pray for her and you you get to know Brothers pretty quick that way Tried by fire and so certainly appreciated amen their their faith in that time and and appreciate you getting to know these brothers better brother Samuel's been and ministered for us and this was been a blessing and appreciate these Pastor Brothers I'm thankful for pastors that are standing for the word of this age amen we need them so I I was cutting my grass a few days ago and listening to a tape as I was as I was going around cutting the grass with my push more and the Lord just uh brother man said something in a quote there and the Lord just dropped a title down into my heart when he said that and so we want to look at this tonight with the help of the Lord I don't say this to be humble I say it sincerely I feel like I should be out here tonight listening to one of these brothers Minister but I know the Lord does all things well even if we don't understand sometimes and and I know what it's like to to be a preacher and to pour yourself out sometimes it's nice to sit and hear another brother preach and and to fill up so I pray that God will get me into the channel to say something that will not just encourage the laity but it'll encourage the minister Brothers tonight as well I believe we all need encouragement this hour first Samuel chapter 16 and verse 6 if you want to turn with me tonight we want to read a couple verses there and then I'll just read a short quote tonight and we'll go to the Lord in prayer first Samuel chapter 16 and verse 6. and there were many from back home that wanted me to greet you but I'm afraid if I begin to tell you all the ones that said to greet you'll forget somebody so just greetings from the home Church and the Believers there first Samuel chapter 16 and verse 6 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him now I want you to remember this is a Vindicated prophet of God and he looks and he says surely this is the king but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man Lucas on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the hearts brother Ben says in a sermon the second-handed robe in 1956 he says sometimes man's choice is a lot different than God's choice and we want to look at that tonight with the help of the Lord God's choice let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus truly we are so thankful Lord to be in a service like this where Believers of like Precious Faith or are gathered together and Lord we're so thankful for Lord the the leading Lord that she placed on brother Samuel's heart to have these meetings and Lord and and for the the home church here the Believers but Lord we're also so thankful to see other brothers that'll come out and and fellowship Lord and in this age when so many are drawing lines in the sand to see Brothers draw circles bigger Lord it blesses my heart and Lord truly I believe that was the nature that you had when you were here and Lord the nature when you sent a prophet in our age his nature was to draw the circle bigger for fellowship with other brothers and so we're so thankful to see that being made manifest today and other brothers that are faithful to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and I just pray that this service tonight Lord would be an encouragement to each one Lord I Have Nothing in myself to bring that would be able to encourage someone in the battles the trials the pressures that they're facing tonight but Lord I I'm not depending on my ability tonight so Lord when you're depending on you to show up father we know that if you show up that you do all things well Lord that you can encourage the discourage that you can mend the Brokenhearted that Lord you can save the lost and fill the empty and heal the sick so so Lord I'm thankful that we're not depending on the Flesh of a man tonight but we're depending on Jesus Christ Lord in the power of your Resurrection because truly whatever need there is tonight father you're you're more than able so we pray Lord tonight that every need would Supply I pray that you get the human instrumentality out of the way where you can speak something Lord and get me in a channel Lord where your Holy Spirit can just go up and down the aisles and speak to hearts and encourage those that need it tonight may we go from here closer to you and stronger Lord than when we came in Father we'll give you the glory for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you richly you can be seated tonight I believe it was David said it's blessed that Brothers dwell together in unity and in the scripture reading tonight as we looked at David we found that Samuel yet being a prophet he did like many of us do and sometimes we do that outwardly and we look at somebody else and we judge them by their stature by their appearance or we judge them by what we've heard about them or what we know of them and I I want to look at some Bible characters tonight and and I hope that the Lord will would just drop this into our heart that if we had been choosing most of the people that God chose if we'll be honest with ourselves that's not who we would have chose and so when we look at it you know it's easy for us to look back there in the description say oh I know God called this one and God called that one but let's be honest with ourselves tonight and and place ourself back there and realize if we had been there and we had been able to see you know many times we read through the Bible and we read of the faith of Abraham and we read of many mighty works and and Supernatural things that happened at Abraham's life and we read through it and we read through about 30 years of Abraham's life in about two chapters and we think oh my his wife was so filled with the Supernatural and God just doing everything for him all the time but there were stages in Abraham's life in Daniel's life and Moses's life where there wasn't the supernatural being done every day and where maybe the voice of God was not just constantly with them and maybe they'd pray and seek and say God why why are you silent I have a need I have a I have a desire I have I have a problem and and they went through mountains and valleys just like we do they went through times but the random would say it this way he said God doesn't show His prophets everything he just shows them what he wants to show them and so even in brother bantam's life there would be things that maybe God wouldn't give him understanding of for years and he would wonder why this God and why that why did you have that why because he was a human being like you and I and he had ups and downs the Bible said that Elijah was a man of like passions just like us and we're not careful when we read the Bible or we read the message we put these characters in a category that really makes it not only unfair to them but it makes it unfair to us because we don't take the human part into accountability and then when our human weakness begins to get us in trouble we feel like a failure and we fail to remember the human parts of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Daniel and David and different ones that they had their ups and downs and and they had their problems and if you had been there and been able to see many of these men in their day-to-day a life and their mistakes and and their faults and their Humanity we would have struggled with them just like we struggle with our brothers and sisters today because brother M said God takes his man but not his Spirit Satan takes his man but not his spirit so history repeats itself and whatever your attitude is today brother random said that's what's your attitude would have been back then so Samuel yet a Vindicated Prophet yet he's still a human being he still has feelings he still has emotions he still has his own uh personality his own ideas and he goes and God hasn't told him who's going to be king he just says go down to Jesse's house and I'm going to have you anoint a man as king and so he goes down in the first son that comes out the eldest son of Jesse he's tall he's about Saul's height and he looks like he'd be a great strong man looks like the crown with video looks like the uh Almighty the the cloak would fit him and looks like he'd be so kingly he says this is the man that God has chosen why because that's who Samuel would have chose and God said no no no Samuel how wrong you are this is not a man after my own heart and he goes through all the brothers and they found out that the man that God had called his daddy didn't even cross his mind to call him and invite him to the anointing party left him on the back side of the desert with the seat no way is it going to be David all right didn't even think to call him and Samuel says hey if you got one more he said oh I do he's just a little scrawny guy down here with the Sheep he said well we won't even sit down and eat until you call him and bring him here and he brings him and God says this is a man after my own heart and he was God's choice but looking in the natural it wouldn't have been we'll be honest with ourselves it wouldn't have been our choice for King but it was God's choice amen and if you had looked at certain stages in David's life if you would have known David as a giant slayer you would have probably picked David and said oh my that's wonderful I can get behind a man like this but what about when David commits adultery with the woman and then not only does that but he goes around and he allows a man to be sent to his imminent death to try and cover it up what would we thought of about David then what would we have still felt like oh well Mike David is the man after God's Own Heart we would have struggled let's just be honest we're human beings every one of us we would have struggled with this how can that be the anointed of God how can that be a man after God's Own Heart but God was looking Beyond David's mistakes God was looking beyond the Flesh of David and I'm not here to glorify sin tonight I hope you don't get me wrong I'm not here to make Grace a disgrace I'm here to tell you you can't change God's mind about you oh God didn't let David get away with his sins and just say it's okay you're predestinated honey you just go on and do whatever you want the sword never left his home he paid for it the rest of his life but it did not change God's mind about David God had already made up his mind about David and he said I have chosen David yeah he had called him he had elected him and I want to say tonight you can mess up your life here on Earth you can ruin my people many times they get ahead of God and they get in a marriage situation and it becomes a terrible thing for him brother Bannon said and choosing him but right there in 1965 a man should pray earnestly for he could ruin his entire life he didn't just say that so that preachers could memorize a nice quote that he was serious about it you can ruin man or woman either one I've seen him ruin their entire life and live in misery because of a poor choice but that didn't change God's mind about them amen even around the message hey there has been people that have wondered for centuries about this topic of marriage and divorce and brother Branham would come and preach it and show us what the true revelation of it was and yet people still struggle with it why because we're human beings and it's still a problem and yet we find that there's people right in the message and marriage and divorce situations and some people get so legalistic they'll disfellowship them and they'll push them away from church hey when a man's down and he's made a mistake that's the man that needs to be in church I had a brother tell me recently he might be listening tonight bro I know he's making some Life Choices that is a pastor as a Christian I absolutely disagree with and he said brother Nathan I'm probably people are probably saying things about me and giving you such a hard way to go I said he said well I guess I should just maybe leave the church I said don't you do it amen [Music] I say this tonight not to not to belittle him I love him with all my heart Martin and I would only say it because if he were here tonight and could share his testimony with you he would share it but my dad threw a portion of my childhood my dad had been going through some physical things and and the devil beating him up mentally and he was trying to work and having some physical battles and things and and he began to backslide and begin to depend on things besides God to try to get him through and he went through a lot of trouble and a lot of Trials but I thank God back home there brother Collins wasn't an idiot he knew there were some things going on but he didn't ever push my dad away he didn't ever call him out over the pulpit and run him down but he kept calling him brother and kept making him welcome and one day God got a hold of Dad and turned him around and he's never been the same since I thank God for people that are long-suffering when somebody's down they don't need you to push him down further they need you to help him and say hey I don't agree with your choice I don't agree with your sin but I want to let you know I haven't gave up on you stay there that I'm praying for you that I know that his grace is sufficient for wherever you're at in your life tonight we're going to look at some characters in The Bible if I can ever get to it brother Samuel we're going to look at some that if we had been there we might have had a problem can you imagine some of the message churches that have gotten so legalistic can you imagine the woman at the well coming and saying I'd like to attend your church and they said now wait a minute you've been married and divorced and married and divorced and married and divorced and married and divorced and married and divorced and the one you're living with now that you said isn't even your husband she said oh that's true and I've had a lot of mistakes in my life's been all scrupled up and I went through all these stages with these six different men but then I met the seventh man and it changed my life I'm not the way I used to be now we could point back at our past and constantly throw that in her faith or we can recognize that Jesus had needs to play that Samaria brother Baron would look at it and say there was a predestinated seed there well if we had been picking we probably wouldn't have picked her as a predestinated seed well Blue Devil well we wouldn't have picked her with that one caught in the very Act of adultery would we have welcomed her into our church the next service but she was it wasn't a rumor on Facebook it wasn't something somebody had criticized her about on Twitter they caught her in the very act and they bring her to Jesus my question has always been where is the man right hold on right if they caught her in the very act there hadn't been a man there too but maybe he was the high priest son or or maybe he was the mayor of the city's son or maybe he was one of the Deacon's sons and they kind of hid that under the rug but she didn't have quite the reputation that he did so they bring her up to Jesus and said she's been caught in the very act what is Moses's law say about it and they thought they were going to get Jesus in a trap but the law had been made flesh the word had been made flesh and was dwelling among them and they thought that the law would just send her away to judgment but when the law was made flesh when the word became flesh it wasn't didn't just come in a legalistic package that it was packaged in a Grace package amen and he said this is what the law said but I came to redeem you I came to save that which was lost and he came to do what the law couldn't do amen hallelujah and he just Stoops down and he doesn't even answer them can you imagine what some of us pastors would have went through if somebody would have emailed us a question or had come up at church and said look there's a situation we want an answer on it and we just ignored him and began to write in the sand yes so well he didn't even take time to answer my question but I wonder what Jesus began to write in the sand whatever it was who began to get their attention and they begin to look down and maybe he was writing Hypocrites a liar Thief different things in the city oh my well we better just walk away because he might call us out and from the oldest to the youngest they begin to walk off he said whoever is without sin Let Him cast the first stone and I want you to notice maybe you recognized it before but the only one that had the ability the only one that was was without sin and could have picked up a stone and stoned her he looks around he says wear thine accuser she said I have none what's up I have none he said neither do I accuse you now he didn't say now just go on and live any lifestyle you want and God just loves you and he said go and sin no more unless the worst thing come upon you amen he was not sugar coating sin he was letting us know when we make a mistake he's there to provide a way back when the prodigal son got as far out there as he did his father wasn't sitting there waiting to say I told you so but he was waiting there with open arms to welcome him back well that's a good lesson a lot of us message parents isn't it wasn't waiting at the door to say I told you so I told you this would happen he was waiting there with our Open Arms to welcome back you know if we ever really take a good enough look at our life and realize how much we needed a savior how much we needed the blood of Jesus how much we needed a redeemer maybe you didn't go out and sin as far as me or maybe you went way further than me but I don't care we had a sister that one time in a Bible study when I was growing up as a young man she had moved into the area and we began to talk about some things in the Bible study and she began to tell us how that she had been so convicted because once upon a time she looked over at somebody's School paper and wrote off of their paper and she had been so convicted by the I thought brother Paul if that was all that I had to be convicted about I'd be the happiest person God if that was what the devil beat me up about I looked over on somebody's paper Once Upon a Time in school I was a homeschooler I didn't have anybody's paper to look over at but I thought my if that would have been my testimony but you know what she needed just as much of the blood of Jesus Christ as I did amen amen his grace is sufficient and so no matter how far you've gone he Grace has provided a way back tonight you say oh brother Nathan I've send away my day of Grace go and search some quotes on what brother random says about that he said they're different people come up in the prayer line and he said oh you think you've sent away your day of Grace he said do you love Jesus Oh yes brother abandonment he said if you if you would send away your day of Grace she wouldn't want nothing to do with Jesus comes and lies us and tells us all but you did this and you did that you know all these mistakes and all your Humanity but look I didn't choose me he chose me [Applause] [Music] when God chose David there was people that could have criticized all they want all we had to do if we'd have been there would say look God did not choose this man Jesse did not choose this man Samuel did not choose this man Samuel in fact a Vindicated Prophet tried to choose his brother but God chose this man my people have a problem today you know with the Vindicated Prophet they find all kinds of criticisms and all kinds of fault and I say hey if you've got a problem with brother random being Malachi 4 then don't don't take it up with brother Brandon don't take it up with me take it up with the one that chose him amen if you got a problem with it talk to talk to the Lord when you get over there if you make it over there talk to him say why on Earth did you choose this man it was so hard for me well I thank God he chose a humble Kentucky amen somebody I could understand and it would make it simple for me that I could be able to receive it remember the the Bible said that Jesus when he came the Common People heard him gladly I hope we're just common folks tonight I I'm not some great something I just want to be God just help me to be simple God don't help me to make myself something that I'm not but Gideon when God would choose him in Judges chapter 6 verse 12 it says the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor now this is what the angels of the Lord said about Gideon but Gideon looks at it and he says in verse 15 oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house so the angel says he's a mighty man of Valor but he says my family is the least and I'm the least of the least amen now what we want to look at tonight with the help of the Lord is that there's a there's a fine line here and we want to be on the right side of that line we want to be right on the line we don't want to be way out here way over there because if you're not careful the devil will get you to be so self-deprecating that well I'm just nothing and I'm Just a Nobody and I I'm just a failure and I well to a certain extent amen that's true I am too but we fail to realize when we're looking at the picture uh you know I've told our church before there's a brother from our church brother Jonathan houch and and he's he's pretty good at corn toss when we go and and we begin to play my he'll just drill them right in that hole one two three boom and and so when we we have a little pitching fellowship or something like that I try to get on his team and we win a lot we're we're undefeated at some of these pigeons and things and and it's not because I'm good it's because of whose team I'm on Amen and anything that I've accomplished in life anything that God has blessed that I have done it was not because of me it was not because I was worthy it was not because of my intelligence it was not because of my knowledge or my ability to memorize or anything like that it was because of whose team I was on yes I'd have been scared to death whether Jonathan in that prayer line if it had just been me and brother Jonathan and brother Samuel praying for that sister no way you could have got me down there amen right hey if I remember Ryan brother Jonathan was on one arm and I was on the other arm and my wife was on a leg trying to hold her skirt down brother Samuel was on another leg and I had my free hand holding her forehead so she wouldn't bite us because she was trying to bite us you don't want to go up against something like that if it's just you but when it's you and Jesus that's a different story David would have been crazy to go up against Goliath if it was just him but see he had Jehovah on his side amen and it wasn't what David could do it was what Jehovah could do through David brother random would have been crazy to go and stand there before the religions of the world and say can any of you heal this blind man yeah he would have been crazy if that had just been the thoughts of a Kentucky hillbilly but it wasn't just a Kentuckian that went over to Africa and India in these different places but it was that God was on his side I want to remind you tonight yes and ourselves were inadequate we're insufficient we're unworthy but don't forget who's on your side [Applause] don't forget who's in the boat with you Exodus chapter 3 verse 11 and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and then I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee amen what a difference see Moses could look back at all his failures we looked at it recently in our church and and how that Moses brother Madam said that Moses's mother had told him he was a deliverer and he had heard that his whole life but Moses wasn't sure and so when it came time to be put to the test he thought well I'll try this out and he did it on his own and he kills one Egyptian and he runs up on the backside of the desert a failure he runs out defeated he runs out labeled as a murderer right right how many is going to follow that guy oh bless God I'd have followed Moses up I was there okay so all you know about him is that he murdered an Egyptian and ran for 40 years on the backside of the desert and then he comes back and this murderer is going to be your deliverer your attitude today would be what your attitude was back then and he comes back God begins to deal with them on the backside of the desert there and it's not just the people that are having a hard time with this Moses is having a hard time he has all kinds of excuses for God Exodus chapter 4 verse 10 and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I'm not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou has spoken unto thy servant but I'm of slow speech and of a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth for whom maketh the dumb or death or the sing or the blind have not I the Lord now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say amen if I didn't feel like I had the same promise from God there's no way I'd get behind a Pulpit I'd be scared to death to stand before a congregation like this I wouldn't have anything to say I wouldn't know where to turn or what to do but I'm trusting him that when I come out here that he's going to be with my mouth that he's going to give me what to say that it's not going to be my thoughts or my opinion but he's going to Quicken it to me and God tells Moses look you've got all these excuses but I'm going with you and I'm going to be with you I'm the one that created man's mouth don't you think I can help you but oh my just like us he had all kinds of excuses and if we're not careful the devil will come in and he'll try to get us to compare one another with one another well brother so and so you know he's he's not the preacher that so-and-so is and brother so and so he's not the singer that brother so and so is and sister so and so she's not the musician that this one is and we begin to compare ourselves like the world right try to rank one another man I can't be any of these brothers and they can't be me brother random said I could not take Billy Graham's place he wasn't just being humble he he couldn't God didn't call him to that and he said and I doubt very much if he could take mine why because God makes us individuals and God calls us to a specific thing God God did not call me to take the place of brother Branham God called brother Branham to do his part and he did it well I'm not here to take his place I'm not here to correct anything that he didn't correct I'm just here to point you back and tell you what he said amen I'm not here to take Brother Paul's Place or brother Samuels or brother Jonathan's they're not here to take mine God called us each with a unique gift and a unique personality and a unique Ministry and if we're not careful we begin to compare well this brother's a little different than that brother and and I don't know if he's really called well why because his personality is different his his style is different his delivery the way he studies we've got you know nobody would ever thought it could have been possible in Jeffersonville Indiana but right now we've got 14 preachers at our church and there's not one of us that's the same there's not one of us that studies the same there's not one of us that preaches the same we got one brother at our church brother it's it look early he'll come out and his notes are about like this a sticky note and I have one little quote written out and one scripture reference and maybe a symbol or something that he knows what it means but and that's his notes and he'll preach just as long as I do and hey I've done that once or twice but that's not how I study and that's not how I preach and I can't be him and he can't be me we got brothers that are fireballs and we've got brothers that are teachers and they don't maybe raise their voices much they don't maybe get as loud but you know what they're preaching the same word they're preaching the same word maybe their delivery is different maybe their style is different but I look what is the motive behind it and what is being produced by it if we're just here to get our name on a billboard somewhere and say well there's Nathan Bryant's name and lights and oh he's over here at this revival and over at that Revival oh look how much offerings he brought in look how many people he backed the building with the motive and the objective is wrong but if it's about lost souls yeah I think many times about the lady there when brother Bantam talked about it she says she was a wash woman and a lot of times you know around the message we got a lot of mouth chauvinistic pigs I think is the word we call them that they don't think women have any place at all you know except maybe to sit over in a corner and wash the dishes and feed the babies you should go listen to Patmos Vision when brother Brandon begins to preach the church ages and before he starts on the Patmos Vision they ask him this question brother banham would it be okay for sisters to do this or do that he says that she can speak in tongues she can interpret she can prophesy she can sing she can do all these things she can testify only not to take a Pulpit and preach because she can't assert authority over somebody amen that's right I know we struggle with that because you know we've tried to make our own traditions instead of staying with what he actually said but God I preached a whole series back at home on on a woman's place and how that God uses women and and he's he's not going to use her outside of what his word says for her he's not going to use her to be the head of her home and to wear the pants in the family that's contrary to his work he's not going to use her to be a preacher that's contrary to his word unless she's preaching to her children and then brother Branham called her the Fifth Gospel didn't call his brothers The Fifth Gospel but called mother The Fifth Gospel God chose it that way God ordained it that way yes sir we get a jealous Spirit if we're not careful around the message and you know some ministers get to a spot where they feel like if they don't have such a supernatural super duper Dynamic Ministry that that they can try to replicate brother banham's Ministry that they've just lost out or if they can't come up with something new to hold the attention of the people that they might lose somebody to somebody else or things like that I I don't understand we have a perfect word we have an infallible Bible we have a Vindicated message that that restored us back to truth I'm happy about it I'm not jealous about brother Brandon's position I'm thankful for it I'm not jealous of these other pastors this is not a competition amen it's not a competition to see how many dollars we can get in the bank account or how many people we can pack in the view of somebody from my church goes to one of brother Jonathan's meetings and gets the Holy Ghost I don't say oh God why didn't you give him the holy ghost in my service well I I guess I got to tell people not to go visit other churches because people's going to think oh my well I got the Holy Ghost over here and I didn't get it back at home I'm rejoicing thank God they're not the holy ghosts they don't want a selfish emotive amen and many times the sisters begin to be a little jealous of that headship if you really have a true husband that is really walking in the admonition of God and is a real head you should not be jealous of that pressure that he's under you should be thankful that you have the right kind of head to fall under and as a pastors hey I saw a picture of brother Samuel in his office before I came out he you know he used to have hair you know when I started pastoring I didn't have one white hair in my head people think we worked three hours a week you know one hour Sunday morning one hour Sunday night and one hour on Wednesday night oh that's all it was I'd Rejoice I'd say thank you Lord but they don't see the toil they don't see the burden the pressure of praying over situations the decisions that we have to make for the body of Christ that we're ministering to there locally and studying and praying God what should I preach who should I have in God what should I do about this what should I do about that and then things like Cove had come up and and you're never going to make everybody happy because either you didn't open early enough or you open too soon or or you were too restrictive or you weren't restrictive enough why because we're all human beings and we all have opinions and people leave churches over things like that to me that's like leaving over the thermostat well the Deacon said at one degree cooler than I liked and bless God I'll stay home where I can control my own thermostat hey there has to be an absolute on the thermostat hola [Applause] if we let everybody be the absolute or the thermostat my the that little knob would be broke off before the first service sister so and so and say I'm having a hot flash crank her down and some little old sister over there said oh I'm about to freeze to death brother Nathan so we have to have an absolute on the thermostat and if it's too cold then hey remember that the next Service and bring a blanket or bring a sweater don't let those things keep you out of church well brother so-and-so went back to church too soon and I didn't think it was safe to go back so I'm going to leave church well didn't you think maybe you could stream a month or two until you felt it was safe and and then go back to church no we don't think logically because we get these worldly spirits on this and it has to be our way or the highway and we can't come under Godly headship whether it be in the home or in the church but listen if you've got the right kind of head these brothers are not flying by the seat of their pants they're praying and seeking God what should I do and we should respect those gifts amen we shouldn't put them up on a pedestal and make them our absolute well brother brother Samuel bought a silver car so now all the church is going to buy a silver car no brother Samuel's not my absolute but he's a god-called man that I should honor and respect to the highest that I can respect that office I don't have to be a mini me as brother Samuel and he doesn't have to be a mini me of me amen amen he doesn't well brother Nathan holds his tie like this when he preaches so I'll do that you know I've seen so many carnal impersonations around the message that a lot of times you can watch somebody preach and realize who they've been watching uh the way they walk or the way they handle themselves or things like that or the way they do their voice and their mannerisms and things like that I don't want to be a replica of somebody else I just want to be what Jesus made me amen amen that's right amen goodness gracious I guess it's going to be God's choice part two tomorrow because we're not we're not getting very far home and so brother Banner would say this little lost woman here she was just a wash woman she wasn't the pastor she wasn't some great Governor king or priest but she has a burden on her heart to see Revival in her City and she goes and she begins to save up money that she's washed on a not in a she didn't have a double deck or automatic washing machine but an old scrap board that she's washed on and toiled over and she saves her nickels and dimes and she rinsed not a Crystal Cathedral but she rents a livery stable and she gets an old broom and it must not have had janitors and deacons and trustees so she gets the room and she's not going to just wait on somebody else to do it she gets the brim and begins to sweep out the Livery stable and they didn't must not have had a missionary fund so they didn't have anybody to print the tracks but you know what she didn't wait on somebody else to do it she goes out and begins to print some tracks about the service and they must not have had a lot of witnesses there in the church so she wasn't going to wait on well I'll wait on the pastor I'll wait on this one but she goes out and she begins to pass them out herself and and she begins to handle the people on the street most people just threw him down and walked over him and one little boy that couldn't read said what does that say yeah and she told him and she had a circuit writer preacher come in and saved up enough money to give him an offering and he comes in he preaches and they didn't have a packed house it was her and the little boy that she had passed the track to and told him what it said and the circuit writer preached her I wonder how many message churches would have said well I guess this revival is a dud I guess this revival was just a failure well you know what we'll just have a prayer and read a Psalm and dismiss and go home but no the preacher preached just as hard as if there had been 5 000 people there and even though there was only one little boy that Soul came to the Altar and he got saved and brother Adam said that was Dwight Moody and he led a million souls to God Amen [Applause] I wonder if that little lady ever recognized who that little boy was she may have never recognized the fruits of her labor until she until she's many things in this life that maybe we have labored and we have tried we've prayed for people and we've witnessed and we've handed people books and things like that and maybe we don't see a lot of results but I believe we'll get over there I read a quote to our church recently brother Benham said when we get over there there's going to be some people that you'll be surprised was there what a wonderful quote somebody said well brother so-and-so's there I don't even want to be there what a stupid statement to me whoever Jesus wants to let be there I'm okay with it just as long as he lets me be there if he'll just grant me eternal life I'll say thank you Lord perfect strength by Perfect weakness we're going to look at several quotes from this sermon I was listening to it on the on the drive here and brother Benham says he's talking about Moses here he says all your weaknesses wouldn't match Moses Moses had a great big list of things to tell God I I got this weakness and that weakness and this excuse and that she's at all your weaknesses wouldn't match Moses says he says again but the very thing that we make excuses by our weaknesses God uses that very thing to tackle the job with the very things that we think well God I I'm not very talented or I don't have the ability I'm not the speaker that brother so-and-so is I'm not the preacher that brother son says I could never teach like brother so and so well God didn't call you to be brothers so and so God didn't call you to be sister so and so he called you to be you because he wants to reach somebody through you at your job right your family reunion or at your school that maybe us pastors would never even come in contact with but he's placed you for such a time as this he's called you and the devil will point you to every failure in your life every mistake every human weakness and he'll say see you can never do anything and you think that you're the first person that's ever thought anything like that you think you're the first person that Satan has ever bombarded you think that us pastors that Satan doesn't come and bombard us and try to give us uh oh what's the word I'm looking for uh with the uh there's a psychological word for it they uh I'll remember it in a moment an imposter syndrome hey a lot of us pastors fight with that an imposter syndrome that surely God how could you call me how could you use me because see we know who we are right if I could put up here every thought that I've had for the last 20 years and every time I've had to ask God to forgive me or my wife or my children or somebody from my church and I put all those things up here you'd probably walk out of here without a lot of confidence in me and you know what if we did the same thing to you I'd walk out without a lot of confidence in you because we're human beings we're human beings and sometimes even in our in our human weakness Even in our Humanity the things that that we know about ourselves oh god brother Brandon said it this way he said every one of us has a Punch coming to us right and maybe your punch is so different than mine that I'd look and say why on Earth does that bother you that don't even bother me at all and maybe you look at me and say well your punch is even more ridiculous than mine that's never been a problem for me but each one of us has a Punch coming and brother Adam said that's that place that you have to keep covered up amen now he didn't mean to hide it and keep it a secret sin he's saying cover it up in prayer stay prayed through know who you are and be honest with yourself and be honest with God and take that thing to God In Prayer not just once in an altar but Paul said I died daily amen if Paul had to Die daily way back there 2 000 years ago what must we do in 2023 how often should we stay prayed up and say God the Lord you know what my desire My Heart Is but I'm human and I'm flesh and hey news alert this flesh never got the Holy Ghost this flesh still drags us down I've heard Brothers preach it almost well once you get the Holy Ghost you bless God you'll never do anything you'll never make a mistake I think my goodness they must have got a different Holy Ghost than me brother Paul must have got a different Holy Ghost than brother Branham brother Branham said hey he said I've had the Holy Ghost for years and he said I keep a cross in my car that cross wasn't there so people in the Walmart parking lot would know he was a Christian he said that cross was there because he was a red-blooded male and there was Flesh on display everywhere and instead of turning his head and watching that he would look to the cross that's right well if getting the holy ghost means that you're never tempted again or you don't ever have any more human weakness and that you're flashing got it and you never never can ever sin again then why on Earth would he hang that cross there right because he was a human being and he was honest about it he was honest with it hey if message preachers if we would all be as transparent as brother Brandon was about things I wonder how full our churches would be when he'd get up and talk about telling a little white lie to his lawyer there and said he was about to lose his mind and he said all mine said just tell him I'm not here and ran outside well we would have we would have just my let's be honest if it had been us now if it had been somebody else we said all the sister so-and-so I can't believe she'd do that but it put yourself in his shoes and we would have said well I wasn't there Brother Sam it wasn't a lie but the angel of the Lord said you lied so no matter how much we want to whitewash it the angel lord said you lied and now you're going to pray for this baby he said just wait here I got to go make something right and he went and he told the man and the man said brother Brandon I got more confidence in you now than I ever did and brother Brandon didn't have to get up and tell the Tabernacle that but I'm thankful that it is because I'm human too and there's times that the devil might I'm so glad that God didn't whitewash the Bible there's things in the Bible that might there's some there's some verses in the Bible we don't teach in Sunday school all right but they're there and they're there for people like you and me that I'm glad God didn't whitewash David since I'm glad we don't only have Hebrews chapter 11. right to read about the heroes of the Bible or we think dear Lord how can I ever match up to that right I heard brother Branham this on the on the tape the other day he said now he said when when Paul goes to write Hebrews chapter 11 about the heroes of the faith and he talks about Abraham he said he says that he staggered not the promise of God through I believe he says makes it sound like he never had ups and downs and things but he said we all know that he was a man and he made mistakes and he had bad days and good days hey Abraham I told her brother a while back he was having some questions about the message and and he he said Abraham didn't lie and I thought well I wonder if he asked abimelech if he would have thought if Abraham lied or not I wonder if you asked Pharaoh if he would have thought Abraham lied or not right yeah this thing's not going to leave your house that's hard for us to wrap our mind around but why because it was God's choice amen amen the very thing that we make excuses by our weakness God uses that very thing to tackle the job with see he waits for us to get to that condition so that he can use us well I wasn't going here in my mind but I'm glad that God God takes control instead of me but you know there's been things in my life not just pre-holy ghost not just pre-pastor life but there have been mistakes in my life that were absolutely mistakes absolutely things that I had to go back around tell somebody I'm sorry I shouldn't have done this you pray for me you forgive me things that were mistakes and I have seen God take those and even use those for his glory email now we can't explain that and I don't say that to make Grace a disgrace I don't say that to say go out and sin but brother bam said God has a way of even taking his permissive will and turning it around to his perfect will amen and sometimes there are things that we go through there there are people that go through sickness and you know it's easy for us as minister of others let's be honest it's easy for me to stand here I I've prayed for sisters and brothers that if God didn't move on the scene they weren't going to be with us very very long and seeing God come on the scene and heal cancer see God take away tumors see God heal people that had crooked spines and then go back and have an x-ray and their spine be straight and it's not hard for me to have faith for that I've seen God move I've seen the power of his resurrection I've seen the products of what this message has restored us back to I'm not ashamed of that and I'm thankful for that but when I'm sick right sometimes that's harder for me to have faith for myself don't just put that on yourself or me brother Ben said hey they give's not for me when brother Billy Paul was there at the accident and brother Branham laying out through the windshield on the hood near death and he said Daddy all you have to do is pray and God would touch it he said he just turned his head from me because the gift wasn't for him right and yet that same man he said what's wrong he said sister random wasn't breathing he said take my hand and put her over on her here he is halfway through the windshield and he takes that hand and lays it over on a woman that's not breathing and she begins to breathe that shouldn't stumble his friends there was a man a lot worse off than brother Branham that he was already his bones his skin had begun to Decay off of his body and they were in the middle of a battle and they said hey uh we just we ain't got time to bury this guy that got killed in battle and they threw him in there on Elijah's bones and he jumped back out sir no I don't worship the bones of brother random don't get scared but I believe that that Jesus is still a Healer when my um family my grandmother had been in in some of other Brandon's meetings and had seen some of the Miracles and things my Dad's cousin was healed of a great big growth on her neck and it's on tape there at the acting meetings at the Acton campground in Kentucky there and and she was standing back by a pole and brother said lady there with the pole by the pole with that growth on your neck you're healed and it was it was instantly healed and my dad had an ant that was healed of TB in brother abandon's meetings and and they had been in some of brother man's meetings and they would look to him like we would look at Jack Cole or Oral Roberts or somebody like that in the healing Revival they didn't know anything about a message or God sent in a man to call out a bride or anything like that and years later they would begin to recognize it and as as my dad and my uncles begin to read the books and listen to the tapes and begin to receive the message they had been in some of the Pentecostal uh fellowships and and followed some of the Pentecostal preachers that were very Dynamic and and they they went to a man's church for a while and every time they'd go he'd preach on these people living on Dead Man's Bones and he made the mistake of inviting my uncle to preach one last time for him and he preached on Elisha there when that man got thrown in he said I guess for the rest of his life they said well there goes that man that's living on dead men's bones our human weakness our human inability we would look at a man like Jonah who God called him to do something and Jonah it looks like did the exact opposite of what God called him to do Jonah instead of going and he just keeps going down he goes down uh to Joppa and then he goes down into the ship and then he goes down into the fish's mouth and then the fish takes him down to the bottom of the sea he just he's like a lot of us his trajectory is just downward downward downward downward and yet in all of that and here he is running from the presence of the Lord and yet brother random takes up for him and says a lot of people say Jonah was a backslid or it says say that Jonah was backslid rather but he said I'm going to take up for Jonah I don't believe he was backslid right well that depends on how you look at it one way it sort of looked like he was in another way he was God's choice to Nineveh and God had a GPS before there was ever sister Siri or sister Google God had a GPS that was so designed that when they threw this Prophet overboard right there at the right place at the right time there was a special design fish that swallowed Jonah and it looked like he'd been making just bad choice after a bad choice and being selfish and God said I've got you right where I want you Jonah amen maybe we got some Jonas here tonight or maybe listening in online hey you might think you're running from God you can't run he's got you right where he wants you maybe he knows what it takes to get you into conditions where you're humble enough for him to actually get through to you maybe he'll have to find you on a bar stool or maybe he'll have to find you in the gutter somewhere maybe he'll have to find you in a hospital bed near death but he knows exactly where he's going to find you and he knows what your condition is going to be and he's already just like he was Adam when Adam and Eve fell in the garden God didn't run through the garden ring in his hands saying oh let's have a conference and get the angels together and come up with a plan of redemption there was already A Plan of Redemption in place before the foundation of the world before Adam had been created there was already A Plan of Redemption knowing that Adam would fall and then we get worried and say well I don't know brother Samuel I feel like God just doesn't care sometimes God cared about you and your circumstance before you were ever a thought into your great-great-grandfather's mind God knew about you he knew where you'd be sitting tonight yes he knew your circumstance amen he knew your weaknesses he knew your inability he knew your humanity and he chose you anyhow through all of that I don't serve the kind of God that would say David's a man after my own heart and then David would make a bunch of mistakes and he'd say Angels bring the erasers I got to change that amen he knew what David's choices would be when he said that and David's choices didn't change God's mind about David and I want to say tonight there is nothing you can do to change God's mind about you [Applause] you can change your circumstances down here on Earth and make a mess of things but you cannot change God's mind about you I asked some brothers a while back I said if he came at my worst wouldn't worry sometimes oh Lord what the Rapture might come in the morning I I will hey that's good we should be under conviction we should stay prayed up that's wonderful but if he came at my worst would it change my election what about a man named Mr Ramsey that brother random talks about that was a backslidden preacher yes and he said I don't I don't serve him no more and he went out and got some alcohol had a had African-American boy go across the river and buy him alcohol because they wouldn't sell alcohol on Sundays in Indiana bring it back over the river to him and brother random said and God took him home makes it easy for us to preach some funerals doesn't it because we don't know what their outcome is that's right but we know that he's a gracious God who's gracious efficient I'm so thankful I've seen some people that don't have the hope that we do that at funerals and things mine it's hard for us to lose 11 but when you've got the hope of the Resurrection it's a different story then when you have no hope that if you don't believe there's a God or or an eternity or or a theophany or anything like that it's a it's a different loss than it is for a Believer who says I'll see him again someday and he says God took brother Ramsey home because he wouldn't let him bring reproach to his name didn't change God's mind about Mr Ramsey but changed his departure date took him to a premature grave when God makes a choice God doesn't have to come around and say oh I made a mistake my man you see some people they run from God and run from God and then maybe God get a hold of him and maybe then come back to church and get baptized and then all of a sudden a car wrecker something take them just snuff them out and you think oh God here they were finally serving you God knows what he's doing that's right amen he knows when to take people that's right he knows what he's doing God's ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are greater than our thoughts and we look sometimes just at the temporary effect and and we think oh God how could you allow this and how could you allow that and we we look at the moment whether it be a tragedy or or a sin in our life we allow the devil sometimes to get out of magnifying glass and he goes back to the worst moment in our life our worst mistake look what she did right there you remember that moment in time you think he didn't do that to Saint Paul when he stood there he said hey you want to get a bigger Rock and hit that man in the head let me hold your coat for you here you want to get one yeah yeah you want to get a uh a rock and hit that man let me hold you you want to get one let me hold your coat and he went around and held their coats so that they could hit a man in the head with rocks that was trying to tell him about a savior you think he didn't wake up in a cold sweat sometimes at night and think oh Lord how could I do it didn't change God's mind about Paul but the devil loves to point us back to those times remember when you did this and remember when you did that and so he keeps taking us back to those things sometimes and then we go and say God oh God please forgive me that and God says what are you talking about yeah yeah I don't have any idea what you're talking about but the devil keeps bringing it up oh he's sure he's the accuser of the brother but if you sincerely ask God to forgive you and made that right brother Adam said he's cast that in the sea of forgetfulness and he said it's like that that ink that you drop into a tub full of Clorox bleach and all of a sudden it disappears go and find that drop of ink somewhere he said Justified means as though you never did it in the first place oh and the devil loves to point us back to those things but you know I know some of us here are older old enough to remember cassette tapes I know a lot of us aren't but uh but there was a man from Jeffersonville by the name of Tom Cannell and he had a good speaking voice and and when they begin to take the tapes from the reel to reels and put them on cassettes some of the cassettes you know they maybe only have a portion of the service and and so when you turn on that cassette tape this voice would come on he'd say the tape that you're about to hear is incomplete every attempt has been made to find the missing portion of this tape and any effort you could give to you know to help us find that would be appreciated well I don't know exactly how it'll be but brother Brandon said when we get over there the angels will put up our life story on the screen that was pre-powerpoint but he said they're going to put it up on the screen and I don't know exactly what it'll be if it'll be an angel or who but when they put up my film on the screen brother Jonathan there's gonna have to be somebody that's going to come up and say now we just want to clarify the tape that you're about to see is incomplete [Applause] we searched through all of heaven we search through Earth we searched underneath the Earth in fact we went down to Hell and searched through there but we haven't been able to find this missing portion I'm so glad that's how my tape will play [Music] not because of what I did but because of what Jesus Christ did for me I can't get much further but let me let me give you a sample of apparently what will be tomorrow morning's service this is actually the the hand of the Lord because in my mind you know you should pay attention to Flyers when a pastor sends a mouse I I thought I was preaching Saturday night and Sunday morning but apparently I'm preaching Sunday Saturday morning and Sunday morning and I'd only studied enough for Friday night so now we have enough material for Saturday morning I don't have to go study till four in the morning so thank you Jesus but let me give you just a little preview of what maybe we'll look at tomorrow with the help of the Lord Acts chapter 1 and verse 21 there had been a man named Judas who Jesus had chosen knowing what the man's outcome would be Jesus was not shocked when Judas betrayed him he knew all along who Judas would be you talk about the character of Christ to be able to treat Judas in such a way that when it comes down to communion and foot washing at the Last Supper there and he says one of you will betray me they didn't all look down and say uh-huh I know who it is he didn't take Judas on the last three fishing trips he's been treating him a little different at the restaurants and all right I know when Judas has come to me with the question he's just totally ignored him and he treated Judas so much like the rest of them that instead of pointing at Judas they said is it I Lord is it me right and he knew what this man's in would be people try to look at men like oh if he was the Messiah he would have gave us a heads up about Judas right he couldn't it was part of the plan of God that Judas had to play his part right yes so that you and I could be saved and I'm thankful he didn't call me to play judas's part but somebody had to play that part just as certain as they pierced my hands and my feet when David would get under the anointing and say that just as certain as that had to be fulfilled so did the scripture that said my own familiar friend has betrayed me that scripture somebody had to fulfill it hey there's scriptures in the end time that people are going to have to fulfill right there's some of them that I don't want to there's scriptures about weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and and being cast into the uh the the the the Lake of Fire I don't want to fulfill those scriptures but somebody's going to fulfill that but let's not stop there there's also somebody that's going to fulfill a bride has made herself ready [Applause] somebody is going to fulfill that yes and so Judas had to fulfill these scriptures and so now the disciples in Acts chapter 1 they're in the upper room pre-holy ghost you can make a lot of mistakes pre-holy ghost that if you'd have just waited on the Holy Ghost you wouldn't have made those decisions you'd have prayed more and been led by the Holy Ghost and and so they're up there in the upper room and they look around there's only 11 of us now and the scripture said that another man would take his bishoprics so we're going to have a little election here and we're going to bring some politics into the church and listen how they do it if this isn't political Acts chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore of these men which have companyed with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us another as one of the good old boys that's been with us the whole time beginning from the baptism of John you know he's got to go way back in message history these are their stipulations for picking the replacement for Judas beginning from the baptism of John under that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with this with us of his resurrection this was their choice this was their stipulation for making the choice and they narrowed it down to two men that fit these qualifications that men that didn't have the Holy Ghost decided that needed to be made and so they they have an election they cast slots in verse 26 says and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon Matthias and he was numbered with the 11 Apostles and brother Randleman saying and he never did anything that's recorded in the scriptures that was man's choice let's look at God's choice Acts chapter 3 8 verse 3 ask for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house and hailing men and women committed them to prison that's God's choice God says that's the one I choose but but Lord he don't go back to the baptism of John and Lord he wasn't with him with us all the time and he didn't hear anything and and he doesn't fit our stipulations I don't remember asking you if it was okay if he was my choice let's be honest with ourselves if it had been us choosing we would have never picked this man we wouldn't even probably picked him to witness to we wouldn't have picked him to hand a message book to we would have been afraid he was going to put us in jail don't witness to that guy he put my grandma in jail over here in fact when he began to minister and had an experience all of the disciples were afraid to go around him because of the things that he had done and the persecution of the church and finally Barnabas goes down the sense in a meeting he says hey this guy's the real deal then somebody's got to hold it Paul something has changed him from what he used to be know but would we have had Grace for a man like Paul persecuting the church unto death consenting unto the death of Stephen standing there on his coach going down with letters from the Sanhedrin to put people that call on the name of Jesus in prison but a light struck him down amen and something got a hold of this man's life and he realized the very one that that I'm persecuting is the one that did something so Supernatural that it actually blinded his eyes and the rest of the men with him couldn't even see the light my something so Supernatural that changed him for the rest of his life and he goes on the back side of the desert there and begins to study the word because his whole life he's been a Pharisee of the Pharisees a Hebrew of the Hebrews and he's had this religious spirit and he was so sure he was right and he was using the very quotes of Moses to support his Doctrine and then when God deals with his heart he realizes I've been persecuting the very thing that the word spoke of and we give up on people around the message well they believe it a little different than me brother Samuel their preference is a little different than mine on how to have a worship service you know some of their some of their musical preferences and some of their song Choices and some of the ministers they have in to preach for them and their style of preaching and and it's a little different than mine I don't know about that guy he you know he leans a little bit this way on this Doctrine or he fellowships with brother so and so over here and and you know birds of a feather and all that uh brother sent me a quote today from the fifth seal you know brother bam does make that statement he said his mother used to tell him birds of a feather flock together but he said a born a born-again son or daughter of God won't use that to disfellowship somebody brother Ram said he had a man on the platform that was baptized wrong imagine if we had a preacher in the building tonight and brother Sammy said I'm gonna put him up here on the platform he preaches titles but we believe he's a good brother all right might they'd probably be an election on Wednesday brother Samuel had this brother he was not even baptizing right on the platform and we're gonna vote him out brother Graham said that denomination that was supporting him came and said brother Brandon you got a man on the pulpit that was baptized wrong we're going to draw a circle and draw you out and he didn't rain fire and brimstone down out of heaven and call God he pulls on their head say don't you realize you're just an old serpent seed don't you know who I am don't you know what God's called me to do he said that's okay I'll just draw a bigger Circle draw you right back in all right all right we've lost that attitude somewhere around the message Jesus said when when John stood there the disciple of Love post holy ghost pre-holy ghost didn't wasn't a very loving guy trying to call fire down out of heaven and consume people and oh yeah and John comes to Jesus he said hey we saw a guy casting out devils in your name but he don't belong to our group so we we told him we forbid him brother random said what it was is that Jesus had called them to do the job and this man was actually getting it done yeah and they were jealous Spirits don't die said you're not of us so we condemned him Jesus said hey whoa if he's not against us he's for us somehow around the message we've flipped that verse and we say if he's not for us he's against us but that's the opposite of what Jesus said that's right if you don't see it just like me if you don't do it just like me I'll I'll just be honest if God had said hey you picked the seven Church age Messengers it would not look like it looks like looks like it would not look the same it's easy for us in retrospect to look back and say oh I would have picked brother Branham but let's look at brother random before brother Brandon was brother Branham bantamweight boxer [Music] come from a moonshining family not a religious background comes to Arkansas got a coat that's got a hole in it he's got to cover up with his hand got an old model T4 that he's knocked the door out of trying to beat it with his knee to keep himself awake would we have looked and said that's the church age messenger for laodicea is that who we would have chose but that's God's choice when we have looked at Paul and said that's the guy that's the first church age messenger we would have probably said stay as far away from that guy I mean I know he he acts like he believes right now but who knows he might flip it anytime he might turn on us and I know what it used to be oh yeah the devil loves to point back to that I know what a lot of people used to be I know what I used to be but I don't want to look back in the mirror at what they used to be look at what God has done look at what God has done so it's not our choice I know a lot of brothers they seem to preach around the message like they've got a spreadsheet of who's elect and who's not elect but God hasn't shared that spreadsheet with me so brother Graham said a lack doesn't persecute elect so how are we going to do it I guess I better not persecute anybody just to be safe because if I'd have been back there I sure wouldn't have thought that Paul was elect not when he was still Saul you couldn't have convinced me no I thought not that guy he looked by his by their fruits you shall know them that's true but we got to give people time sometimes and be long-suffering brother Ram says in the church age book there he said sometimes it takes the Son of God a long time to realize that he's a son of God amen praise the Lord we've got to stop somewhere so I guess here's a good spot sometimes it takes the Son of God a long time to realize he's the son of God you know Paul said that he blasphemed we would have admit right away we would have wrote Paul out well Jesus said if you blaspheme that's the imparnable sin but but read the next sentence but I did it through ignorance he did it through ignorance yeah brother Brandon said there was a man wrote him a letter dean of a Lutheran College said I went out to see what God was doing in the meeting he said what did I find nothing but a polished up soothsayer let's be honest if we didn't have the rest of that quote we would just write that man off and say no chance no way brother Branham Ronnie Mac called him brother went and met with him and fellowship to a thing yes sir and begin to talk to him about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that Dean and all those men there and the faculty turned their chairs around brother Benham said and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost our legalistic figuring out wouldn't allow that but I'm glad God doesn't just make me in charge of the choosing I had a brother that's been coming to our church for a while he came to me one day and said he said I had a Pharisee theology he said but the woman at the well really messed up my Pharisee theology you see if we're not careful we take on those same spirits that was back there and we begin to look at it well wear this and where that we're a message believer we belong to this we belong to that we fellowship with this group of brothers we believe these doctrines we that that's wonderful that's not what saves you I believe in going to church I believe in paying tithes I believe in reading my Bible I believe in listening to tapes none of those things saved me that's right I believe those are things that a safe person will want to do right but going to church I heard a man say it doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you an automobile it's not the works that we do that we can work ourselves into something and have a checklist if it was then Jesus died in vain if he could have gave me a checklist and said just do all of this do this this by the Pharisees would have loved that oh I can do that but when he said there's nothing that you can do you've got to accept what I did they said oh wait a minute no seems so simple right but they wanted something they could do in it and if we're not careful we get to that spot where we think that it's something that we did in this that we were good enough or that we were smart enough or that we studied our way into this you cannot educate your way into the Holy Ghost you can't read enough quotes or listen to enough tapes or read your Bible enough this isn't Paul said he said this wasn't given to me by Flesh and Blood I didn't know man gave it to me but by the revelation of the Holy Spirit and so if it's him that gave it to us and it was a free gift then what can I say but thank you God for your grace how can I look down at somebody else and say well they don't see it like I see it well all I can say is thank God for eyes to see and here's to hear we've been looking at Judas there at church for about the last five Wednesday nights four or five Wednesday nights and I read it quote Wednesday night brother Brandon said Jesus gave Judas every opportunity the same opportunities that he gave the other disciples and then I read a quote at the end of service where he said he said now he's talking about Judas and and pharaoh and he said the the direction they went he said so if you've got the slightest spark in your heart to want to serve God then you ought to be the happiest person on the face of the Earth and you ought to serve him with everything that you've got so it it made me it reminded me I wouldn't say it made me think because it's thoughts that we should have already but it reminded me we need to have Grace for people we need to have our hand out to people there's people that they make decisions they make choices that I I don't agree with I can't I can't support but I also don't want to just write them off and say no they'll never make it right they'll never be a Christian they'll never be a believer because it's not my choice that's right it's God's choice I'll share something with you this is just a personal testimony this isn't on tape so you you can take it with a grain of salt but I thought it spoke to Brother branham's character and went along with what's on tape I don't I think it's okay for me to share it but a few years ago we were at a Longhorn Restaurant eating and Brother Joseph Branham and his wife's sister Valerie were there we ran into him and I got to talking to him in the parking lot he began to tell me about brother branham's Vision book there that brother Brandon would write down different visions and things and he said he had been reading in the vision book that morning brother made a statement about I don't remember if it was Lee or a gene but it was one of the two it was way back in the early 50s when he first met them God had given him a vision and he said he will turn against me but I must remain silent can you imagine what character that took yeah to still treat those Brothers the same knowing that it's hard enough for us to treat people many times when we know we don't know but we just think well they didn't shake my hand Sunday morning and they kind of they kind of you know we had a conversation the other day and the way they treated me I I don't know I think they may have something against me and we let the devil kind of put a thought in our mind and we begin to build up a little bitterness and build a complex around that but can you imagine standing there knowing brother bam said there'd be brothers put his their arms around him say oh brother Brandon we love you and he said and I know that they don't but he didn't stand there and expose him say brother so and so you don't love me I know what you said about me in the room the other day he the character that God placed in his life to be able to stand there and still love that person anyhow amen yes makes me want to spend some more time in prayer say Lord I need that perfect love I need I need brother Graham said that when he went beyond the current time there he said nothing could enter there but perfect love he said lay aside everything else and get perfect love and many times we lay aside everything else and we run after a Doctrine or we run after a personality or we run after a group or this or that or something exciting to us or something that we can identify ourselves around but he said lay aside everything yes and get perfect love I need more of it I don't know about you I need I need more of the love of Jesus Christ in my life I was sharing with brother Samuel last night I won't share the whole dream because of time and just because it's not necessary but I was sharing brother Samuel a dream that happened right before we had that experience in a prayer line together he and I brother brother Jonathan and in the dream there was some there was a demonic power that was coming against me in the dream and I pled the blood of Jesus Christ against it and in the dream it stopped that they weren't able to harm me because I'd pled the blood of Jesus Christ but it wasn't helping them it was just protecting me and the dream I prayed and I said God let that person experience your love in a way that they've never experienced it and they just crumpled to the floor in the dream we need more of that amen not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord if I can't look at a brother and brother Graham said if I can't bitterly disagree with him and still love him he said that I need to be adult we can we can ask God when we get over there God why did you choose this one and why did you choose that one but I'm not going to stand like the Pharisees in the doorway and try to Bar somebody from getting into heaven I want to open the door of Grace just as wide as I can for anybody that can get in let's bow our heads together I've been trying to stop for a while but maybe that was for somebody that needed to hear it Lord Jesus Lord I'm so thankful for your grace Lord I needed it so desperately where would I be without your grace and so Lord there's nothing that I can bring and say look at what I did or look at what I said or look at what I've accomplished lord it's just been you every one of us as Minister Brothers if we'll be honest with ourselves any any good thing of Eternal value that's been done through our Ministries has just been when we had enough sense to get out of the way and let you work lets you move and lets you speak as brother Bannon would say he wasn't the son of man he was just the one standing near when he spoke God help us to get into a channel to where it can be so much of Jesus Christ to where it's not the human instrumentality that gets the glory it's not the vessel but all we can do is just say it wasn't me I just let him borrow my lips or my hands or my feet whatever I could loan him that he could use and he could work through it takes you Lord heavenly father I pray for every brother Lord every congregation represented here Lord these Pastor brothers that Lord I know how busy being a pastor can be in the pressures and the time that goes into it praying for our congregations and studying and counseling and different things and for them to take time out of their week to drive up to these meetings and be a part of it and pull on the gift that you've placed in my life Lord I appreciate it I pray that you bless each brother represented here each Minister bless their congregations Lord bless their Ministries use them in a mighty way Lord may it never be a competition between any of us Lord but may it just be about lost souls about helping somebody and if one of my brothers can reach somebody that I could never reach Lord may it never be a pride thing of of all I'm jealous that they could help that person but may I Rejoice with them and Lord if you can use me to reach somebody that they couldn't reach Lord may we just Rejoice together that somebody was able to yield to the holy spirit in a way where that person could be helped Lord for the lay members Lord may we not just look at one another and Lord it's so easy for us to look as as Samuel did at the outward appearance and and judge somebody and and just look and see their circumstance or their condition but we don't know what lays behind there all the hurts and the heartaches and the broken roads that they've walked Lord and and all the lies behind that maybe decisions that we wouldn't agree with but Lord not knowing maybe all that transpired to compel them and and get them into a place where in desperation maybe they made the wrong decision but but God we're not their judge and jury Lord may we stand there like you did with the woman caught in the very act and extend grace and mercy and say hey I can't I can't agree with your decision but I know I know there's a way back I know there's Grace for you I'm not here to be your judge I'm not here to push you away from church or put you away from the message or try to unchristianize you I'm just here to remind you his grace is sufficient amen help us Jesus draw us closer to you I pray father give us more of that love Lord and more long-suffering help us Jesus help us to draw the circle bigger instead of trying to get it down to where it's just our for and know more but father may we have a handout to help somebody to be an encouragement to somebody Lord even if they never see everything exactly the way we do Lord that's that's not what the what it's all about Lord here your Prophet told us there and in a sermon he said when God gave us the Holy Ghost in our own peculiarities he proved that he's ignoring our Doctrine and yet many times we divide over such Minor Details of doctrines and things Lord and try to separate and divide Brotherhood and fellowship Lord help us Lord I know we we have to stand for the truth and stand for what's right but Lord we can still do that and put our arm around a brother and draw the circle bigger Lord his brother Brandon would say there when he first got saved and he became a Baptist preacher he thought if he wasn't Baptist you're just out but then he began to realize that the blanket stretched a little further to cover other brothers Lord may that be our attitude Lord may we extend the hand of fellowship and the arm of Grace Lord to anyone that will receive it Lord may we pray for those the Lord may be ones that have made made choices that we totally disagree with but Lord instead of taking them to social media and running them down or or trying to run them down a church Lord may we take them to our prayer closet and pray for their needs pray for their soul pray that you'd move in their life pray that you'd turn that circumstance around help us not to get an old critical judgmental Spirit Lord like the Pharisees had but may we have that love and compassion and grace and mercy like you did Lord I know I needed it so if I need it Lord help me to extend it to someone else help us father be with the rest of the services this weekend Lord be with these other brothers their services on Sunday Lord may you bless them with the great outpouring of your presence Lord get us Rapture Ready I pray Jesus Christ's name and all you love the Lord tonight brother Paul I know we put you on the spot tonight but I I was feeling led to sing that song I Feel the pool but I can't sing it with him sitting there so could you come and sing that for us brother I thank God for it for men of God that God's anointed to write songs like this it's a great blessing to the bride amen can you imagine David there in the Sin with Bathsheba and he goes and he begins to pray and ask God he says restore unto me the joy of my salvation take not thy Holy Spirit from me and this is a prayer of a man who just made the biggest mistake of his life fell flat on his face spiritually and God thought so much of that prayer that he put it in the Bible it's been such an encouragement to us sometimes songs and things are written out of out of great trials and valleys and things but but I'm thankful that men of God yield their gifts whether it be preaching or songwriting or singing or playing an instrument or being a witness whatever it be I thank God for any person that'll yield their gift to him and God bless you brother Paul and I begin cry cry and my mind [Music] the spirits [Music] it must be God here in my soul cause I feel the pull let's stand and sing it tonight [Music] and I know his fears [Applause] me [Music] [Music] Lord please come and change I feel alone [Music] and with each life [Music] yes Lord he was from [Music] [Music] take me Lord Jesus [Music] [Applause] mistakes Lord I know you speak to me [Music] please come [Music] home let's sing it again tonight foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] help me sing this if you know brother Paul one night while long last rage and see [Music] we'll find this when Christ [Music] again aren't you thankfully now Jesus was cause [Music] his wife his voice that move forward [Music] to my destruction what's a matter of time then Jesus stepped in says this one stands Hallelujah [Music] since I've met the world [Music] yes he yes it is [Music] he came up here for me [Music] so tell me [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] amen you know it's what's so powerful is when God reaches out his hand you know it's just to take his hand like when Peter you started out walking when he started out walking on the water he got his eyes on the water yeah yeah and he started looking at my goodness what's taking place he got to looking at it instead of keeping his eyes on the one who spoke to him and you know the way that the Lord he'll reach out his hand to us the way that that meal reach out his hand all we have to do is rise and take it because when God reaches out his hand to us it brings us right back into Fellowship the right way is that right it's not just something where God just comes and he doesn't Pat sin on the back but there is a right approach big man but you know why God does that because his love and his care God wants to do something for you and I to establish us aren't you glad about that I'm glad when I go to the doctor he just don't look at me and tell me what I want to hear yeah sometimes they might look at you and say and when they do that you know something's coming but I'm glad they just don't pat you on the back I'm glad they tell you the things you need to hear but for what that is that's a hand stretched out but I'll tell you what we can take confidence in the hand of God because it is the very God of truth and the Bible said what a promise we have of them who will bless themselves in the god of the amen the god of the truth amen don't you love him tonight amen well Brother Paul's congregation they hear him sing this a lot I know but we're gonna have you sing it here because what a song to be sung tonight and we are God's choice and you know I think of what brother John and sister Loretta used to sing that old song from I think the Lanny wood Trio and that was he didn't bring me this far to leave me but I think it's something to be mindful of he promised to hold my hand amen all the way through amen he promised to hold [Music] he promised to help please standing on his promises [Music] [Music] [Music] standing up promises [Music] Hallelujah [Music] tonight my way let my feet [Music] [Music] is [Music] Hallelujah [Applause] leave me to the other side his promises alive [Music] living it is [Music] [Applause] standing on his promise [Music] Hallelujah glory be to God amen and the church said amen and amen amen glory be to God my as many things that I would like to we could say but I'm not going I'm not gonna God has said of all the needs to be said and if I start saying things it'll probably get in his notes I just had a good time to me this is down home cooking you know there's a lot of advertisements about that many times but it ain't down home cooking it's pre-packaged this one pre-packaged it was down home cooking may God comes right down into all the channels and areas of our life I really I mean there's so many different points and I'm not going to break my promise of what I just said and I love that pulling out of the scripture Jonah going down and down and down you know God was leading him that way it looked contrary to the will of God but seeing here is where God's will takes place and God was leading Jonah to a place where he would face full responsibility and that full responsibility was looking at himself and saying I can't do what you've called me to do but I want to surrender all that I have to you that the omnipotent God can use me the way he sees fit to use me that's the responsibility in this hour we've come face to face with the Living God and just like Moses just like the rest Lord I cannot do anything without you how the Lord spoke tonight you know we we can we can go clear to another side we compare ourselves we can look at all of our weaknesses but you know all those weaknesses God knew all of those would be there there weren't mistakes there wasn't oh if this would have happened different if it no we didn't get to choose on the human grab bag of life it's not a value meal where you can change pickles no pickles mustard ketchup you don't extra onions this is not that way but God knew all those weaknesses but when we can surrender those weaknesses not just make excuses But realize in his presence God doesn't do that to embarrass us he does it that we might surrender and then brother Ram said he pours himself in and uses himself through those channels I tell you God knows what he's doing because when I would look at me I wouldn't have picked me I'm just telling the truth but you know what I like about that I can't put me out you didn't pick me you can't put me out and there ain't a devil big enough can put me out of the plan of God so good good God is so good amen you love the Lord tonight I tell you right God has come right down and spoke there's enough there's enough ammunition tonight not only just back the devil up in the corner but you need to go ahead in these boxes ears a little bit you didn't get him back down the size of what he really is I take this word and you're home with you tonight and just bring him right back down to size amen do you love the Lord and brother Jonathan would you come and dismiss Us in the word of prayer so thankful to have brother Jonathan brother Paul these brothers
