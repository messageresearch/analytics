[30:01] [Music]
[30:07] what love you know I just just heard by
[30:14] the random the other morning listen to
[30:18] it Ibrahim grace Covenant
[30:22] and this statement has always been one
[30:24] of those things that grabs ahold of your
[30:25] heart and just wants to wring it out but
[30:29] to realize when God displayed this
[30:32] covenant to Abraham and confirmed it
[30:35] God was displaying that he is the one
[30:39] that's determined to save man
[30:44] we're not here tonight by our
[30:46] determination we're here because he
[30:50] determined and there's something about
[30:53] it that his determination that he had
[30:55] when it takes residence in our lives and
[30:59] begins to draw us then we say like Paul
[31:03] it's not either liveth its Christ who
[31:06] liveth in me our determination is that
[31:11] of his life in us that he will achieve
[31:16] what he has promised amen what grace
[31:23] what grace they God help us to get out
[31:26] of the way that he can achieve what only
[31:30] he can do amen just so appreciate you in
[31:34] the Lord tonight and just want to turn
[31:37] our attention to the word if you'd like
[31:38] to stand with me appreciate all the
[31:40] music song leading tonight
[31:42] song is it I'll do each time it's always
[31:46] a refreshing for me when I'm in the back
[31:50] many times if they don't have my speaker
[31:53] up in the back I let them know I send
[31:55] them a little text and say get it turned
[31:57] up because I so appreciate the singing
[32:01] and the worship of the Saints have gone
[32:03] it just does my heart good to hear you
[32:06] out here worshiping because I know that
[32:09] there's times like with we're Paul and
[32:11] Silas it's of a test or trial you're in
[32:15] the midst of things that you don't feel
[32:17] like as far as fleshly worshipping but
[32:20] you're here to worship the Lord
[32:23] and you just kind of push beyond all of
[32:25] that if I could sense that how much more
[32:30] how much more the Lord Amen so we just
[32:34] we want to just turn our attentions to
[32:35] the word of the Lord tonight and just
[32:37] ask that God would just have his way
[32:40] back in Hebrews 10 I want to read go
[32:42] back to those verse of scripture so much
[32:46] within here within these verses of
[32:49] Scripture in Hebrews 10 in just verse 23
[32:53] through verse 25
[32:55] we'd like to read there
[33:03] in verse 23 let us hold fast the
[33:07] profession of our faith without wavering
[33:12] for he is faithful that promised and let
[33:18] us consider one another to provoke unto
[33:22] love and to good works not forsaking the
[33:28] assembling of ourselves together as the
[33:31] manner of some is but exhorting one
[33:35] another so much the more as you see the
[33:38] Day approaching let's just bow our

[35:47] come to pass Lord what you have intended
[35:49] Lord to take place we pray we give
[35:52] ourselves to you now Lord in the name of
[35:55] Jesus Christ amen amen god bless your
[35:58] being seated I certainly believe that
[36:03] every every word of God is important and
[36:07] I believe that where Paul led by the
[36:10] Spirit of God he's admonishing the the
[36:14] children of God sometimes there's things
[36:17] that we can begin to take for granted
[36:21] and I'll say in many instances it's not
[36:24] that we would do it on purpose but
[36:28] sometimes it's things that where we be
[36:30] get to a place of just the cares and
[36:34] become neglectful of things that are
[36:36] really really important and when I when
[36:41] I look at this we see that whether it be
[36:43] even in prayer and reading the Bible
[36:45] listening to the Word of God there's a
[36:48] lot of other things where the enemy can
[36:50] try to fill our time with a lot of other
[36:53] filler but you and I both know that yeah
[36:58] on God's table this is not a buffet with
[37:01] a bunch of filler that just tries to
[37:03] fill you up there's a lot of things with
[37:06] churches that they just want to fill
[37:08] people up as far as to make them fill in
[37:11] the part where they've done their
[37:13] religious duty but we recognize that
[37:15] that's not God's desire everything that
[37:18] God has he don't put any chemical in
[37:21] there to try to blow you up in one area
[37:23] of the word and deflate you in another
[37:25] area but God brings about well-rounded
[37:29] belief
[37:30] because that's what a Christian is every
[37:33] vitamin of the word we need it we need
[37:35] it for spiritual growth and so God is
[37:38] there to minister on our behalf into
[37:42] every need and when we look at this
[37:44] admonition that Paul would give to us as
[37:47] believers he would speak to us and
[37:50] admonish us to hold fast the profession
[37:53] of faith and then he would come around
[37:56] and say let us consider one another and
[38:00] I'll tell you in a challenge in the hour
[38:03] because these scriptures even become
[38:04] more real in the hour that we're living
[38:07] in because we know that we are living in
[38:10] the end time we are living in a time
[38:13] where the prophecies that have been
[38:15] prophesied are in the fulfillment right
[38:18] now we are seeing that day we see it
[38:21] approaching we realize we have arrived
[38:24] into this time that the Scriptures have
[38:26] spoke of within this hour there's not
[38:29] another messenger to come there's not
[38:30] another message to be given we have this
[38:33] is the last visitation to the Gentiles
[38:36] we're living in this time and God has
[38:39] kept every promise and you know to
[38:42] realize that within the midst of it that
[38:45] God would call to our hearts to let us
[38:48] consider one another to provoke one
[38:51] another unto love and to good works and
[38:53] I I think those are some big words
[38:55] considering that the spirit of this age
[38:57] is an age that is centered around self
[39:01] it's all about me and I've said this
[39:04] before and it's not a play on words but
[39:07] you know and but in years past you would
[39:10] have never found the term selfie in the
[39:12] dictionary but to think within this hour
[39:15] that it is a time to where they actually
[39:18] have a time and where selfie where
[39:21] people are so concerned with self image
[39:24] and presenting themselves in a likely
[39:28] manner and even to where that they will
[39:31] live under false narratives and
[39:33] pretenses and is such a pressure even
[39:36] that that would come with that but how
[39:38] that in a contrary that God would call
[39:41] for us to consider one another
[39:44] to provoke on to one another I'm to love
[39:47] and to good works and when to think that
[39:50] if God is called for this then God
[39:53] provides what is needed and I believe
[39:56] that it is the life within us because no
[39:59] matter how good that we could be as a
[40:00] person it takes that of eternal life
[40:03] that goes beyond and moves down there
[40:06] too because us in ourselves we come to
[40:09] an end but yet when the Holy Spirit is
[40:12] there the love of God it does for us
[40:14] what we and ourselves could never have
[40:18] done or dream possible we could never
[40:20] bring ourselves to the level of
[40:22] servitude that the love of God in our
[40:25] hearts can bring us to where the love of
[40:27] God can move upon our hearts that will
[40:30] actually cause us to forget our
[40:32] differences it will lift us into place
[40:35] to where we see the desire and the need
[40:38] for unity there's only one thing that
[40:40] can do that and that's the love of God
[40:42] and to see that within this Paul would
[40:45] go on to say not forsaking the
[40:47] assembling of ourselves together you
[40:49] know there's some things like we looked
[40:51] at it last week there's certain things
[40:53] that God will do for us and we we look
[40:56] at that even when it comes to you know
[40:58] the healing of our bodies we don't do
[41:00] that but God does that for us
[41:02] and to know that within this there are
[41:05] things that God has equipped us and
[41:07] called us to do and God will not do it
[41:10] for us God will not assemble us together
[41:13] we must assemble ourselves together you
[41:15] see there's certain things when you look
[41:17] at in the scriptures you'll find how
[41:19] faith is talked about you'll find the
[41:21] faith of God and then you'll find in the
[41:23] scriptures where Jesus rewards them upon
[41:26] their faith you give because you
[41:28] recognize that the faith of God it must
[41:31] move through alive but yet he will turn
[41:33] around and reward us based on our faith
[41:36] and you see our faith is that which is
[41:39] to be directed to the Living God in the
[41:42] Word of God that God might perform his
[41:44] word you know when we come here together
[41:47] it is our responsibility to be able to
[41:50] come together and to assemble ourselves
[41:53] together according to the word because
[41:55] he said where two or three are gathered
[41:57] together in my name there will I be in
[41:59] their midst also edu and I just coming
[42:01] here now let me just say this just us
[42:03] coming here is not going to invite him
[42:06] in our myths but it swear that we come
[42:08] here with a heart that I desire to hear
[42:11] from God and I'm not just here to hear
[42:14] remember I'm coming here to consider
[42:17] somebody else I'm not just showing up
[42:20] about me where it's about my needs and
[42:23] what can I get here tonight but I've
[42:26] come here tonight but I might be able to
[42:28] put my part in and make myself available
[42:31] that if God decides to use me then I
[42:34] want to be available that I can be a
[42:37] blessing to the body of which I am a
[42:39] part of so to think of it that this
[42:44] that's a part of it that is given to us
[42:46] and the Spirit of God itself bears
[42:49] record in us gathering together to think
[42:51] of how that God here was among the
[42:54] children of Israel to guide them in the
[42:57] pillar fire and then now when the pillar
[43:00] fire now becomes veiled within that the
[43:03] body the the that of the created body of
[43:07] the Lord Jesus Christ which God Himself
[43:09] made himself a body that he might come
[43:12] and redeem you and I back to himself and
[43:15] now in part that life that was actually
[43:18] we were intended to have from the
[43:21] beginning and to think how that he was
[43:23] God all along because when Paul sees him
[43:26] on the road to Damascus Paul asked him
[43:29] now remember Paul sees a light and it is
[43:31] alive that is greater than any of the
[43:34] heavenly objects the Sun it is a light
[43:37] that shines with great brilliance it is
[43:39] that same pillar of fire that moved
[43:41] there in Genesis 1 it's the same pillar
[43:44] fire that moved there in the burning
[43:46] bush it's the same Almighty God the
[43:49] angel of the Covenant that was with
[43:51] Israel and brought them in it was the
[43:53] same pillar of fire that stood there in
[43:56] the servant they're known as the captain
[43:58] of the Lord's host it's the same pillar
[44:00] of fire that's among the Church of the
[44:03] Living God and now that same pillar fire
[44:05] now coming back on the day of Pentecost
[44:08] and he begins to
[44:10] five himself he begins to break himself
[44:14] apart he is imparting his own life to
[44:18] his children it's called brother Ram
[44:23] would say it like this in one place of
[44:25] the message thirsting for life
[44:27] he said when we can get a vision of that
[44:29] he said it would just break your heart
[44:31] to think of the love of God of how that
[44:34] God was dividing himself among his
[44:38] children now to think of this that
[44:41] within it it's the same God now that was
[44:44] in the pillar fire manifested in a human
[44:47] body now separating himself among his
[44:50] people the Bible records in acts 2 but
[44:53] when they were gathered there together
[44:54] in one place and water corn oh my and
[44:58] when they got in that kind of a
[45:00] condition then the pillar fire came down
[45:04] according to the word and it did what
[45:07] they could not do but remember they had
[45:09] to assemble themselves together they had
[45:13] to get in one mind and one Accord before
[45:16] the Holy Ghost ever change you
[45:17] understand what I'm saying tonight many
[45:19] times we put things off and say well I
[45:22] need the Holy Ghost to get me in one
[45:24] Accord I need the Holy Ghost to get me
[45:26] in one mind but you see Satan is robbing
[45:28] us from the promises that belong to us
[45:31] to get in one mind and one Accord it's
[45:34] where we get our eyes off of ourselves
[45:36] and our eyes on the promise and when we
[45:39] got our eyes on the promise we are
[45:41] willing to sacrifice feelings and
[45:43] differences for what for the sake of the
[45:47] body of Jesus Christ Oh glory be to God
[45:52] and the pillar fire came down and it was
[45:54] like that the Bible says cloven tongues
[45:57] of fire appeared
[46:00] upon each of them amen you see God God
[46:05] knew exactly he's assembling his body
[46:08] that he has redeemed now brother bran
[46:11] would say like this he says we are not a
[46:13] divided people we've got to be in unity
[46:17] because each one of us is holding a part
[46:22] of God I want you to think of that we
[46:27] have been given a stewardship holding a
[46:33] part of God what will I do
[46:37] who is holding a part of God something
[46:42] to really think about in it oh my and we
[46:46] must come together and then the pillar
[46:49] fire is manifested in the wholeness in
[46:53] the fullness of it when his church sets
[46:56] together in heavenly places
[46:58] then the fullness of the power of God is
[47:00] in his church each one of us holding
[47:04] spiritual gifts and spiritual offices
[47:07] coming together brings that pillar of
[47:10] fire back again amen so within it how
[47:16] God saw how God divided himself it would
[47:19] be like if would take you know even I
[47:22] think where I live in it it was their
[47:24] way throughout the city itself before
[47:26] how things are set up like they have
[47:28] what they call a tract of land that they
[47:31] buy and when they buy that tract of land
[47:33] when they do that they go in there as a
[47:36] developer and they begin to set up
[47:38] certain Lots within there now what they
[47:41] begin to do is set up all these Lots
[47:43] within that subdivision because it has a
[47:46] whole division yet it's going to be
[47:48] broke into multiple parts and so God
[47:52] himself has never forgot about one of
[47:55] his children as a matter of fact the
[47:57] redemptive plan is all God working to
[48:00] assemble his body back to himself to
[48:04] where that he himself can be fully
[48:06] manifested in his body his redeemed body
[48:10] the bride of Jesus Christ so
[48:13] he's been assembling the redeemed
[48:15] attributes of God and there isn't you
[48:18] know less or or where oh we went out of
[48:21] the pillar of fire or we ran out of the
[48:23] Holy Ghost no sir
[48:25] it's JA briefing that is needed and God
[48:28] has not forgotten one he did not make
[48:31] more wedding garments that then were
[48:33] needed neither did he make the less he
[48:36] knows exactly what he's doing his
[48:38] program is not haphazard his program has
[48:42] been thought through from before the
[48:45] foundation of the world before the devil
[48:48] was even the devil he was God hallelujah
[48:55] when we sent in heavenly places baptized
[48:59] into the body of Jesus Christ and were
[49:02] prayed up with an expectation
[49:12] let me just read these four parts here
[49:14] in Mary's belief brother Bram said now
[49:19] his body's up there talking about on the
[49:21] meta toriel seat the throne of God his
[49:23] spirits down here his spirit God's
[49:26] Spirit that worked through that body his
[49:28] virgin born son in the fullness of God
[49:30] he works through you and I as portions
[49:33] of God that's why the Holy Spirit when
[49:37] it came on the day of Pentecost it broke
[49:39] all up that pillar fire and divided
[49:42] itself in licks of tongues and set up on
[49:44] each one we have to have one another the
[49:53] biggest thing that devil ever got on us
[49:56] was when we separated us from the love
[49:58] of God from one another and we love one
[50:02] another that's that's brotherly love he
[50:05] says now if you've got part of the Holy
[50:07] Ghost and I've got part of it and the
[50:10] next man's got part of us put us
[50:12] together there's three parts I'm three
[50:15] times as strong as I was with two
[50:18] brothers amen that's a scriptural
[50:24] principle all the way through the
[50:27] Scriptures amen and three times as
[50:30] strong as I was with two brothers oh my
[50:36] help me God
[50:38] to be a place when I come here to be one
[50:41] that can unite my faith with somebody
[50:43] else I don't know what the needs might
[50:47] be but but I'm here brother I'm here to
[50:50] help you take your Mountain I don't know
[50:52] what your need might be sister but I'm
[50:54] here to help you take your Mountain
[50:57] whether it be sickness in your body
[50:58] whether it be deliverance whether it be
[51:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm here
[51:03] to help you
[51:09] that how you feel he said that's the way
[51:13] we stand now he says you know I'm a real
[51:15] Kentucky and together we stand divided
[51:17] we fall we must stand that way together
[51:23] Henderson what he said stand that way
[51:25] together stand what way recognizing what
[51:29] is in our heart
[51:34] the God the Christ in you desires to be
[51:39] united with the Christ in me it's like a
[51:43] puzzle piece it needs the other piece
[51:45] one piece is not the puzzle God set it
[51:53] up in the book of Acts that there would
[51:55] be a body ministry this is why this is
[52:01] why the Prophet would it Manas us in
[52:05] many different places in the scripture
[52:07] in in the message that would tell us if
[52:10] the if you don't feel in your heart
[52:14] where you can't wait till the church
[52:17] doors are open to where you can get in
[52:19] here and fellowship with brothers and
[52:22] sisters of like precious faith What did
[52:24] he say it's time you got to praying you
[52:28] see there's a check up tool because he
[52:32] would say in another place you long to
[52:34] go where other believers are gathered
[52:36] together because why is a part in you
[52:41] that loans to unite with the other parts
[52:45] of Christ in his body you see that's why
[52:50] that when when we want to let that man
[52:53] have the right away and not this guy
[52:57] amen so it is a part of the body coming
[53:01] together of which the Lord has provided
[53:03] for himself locally this is why
[53:09] Satan will try to cause divisions one of
[53:17] the first place to see works is to bring
[53:19] divisions within spirits because he
[53:26] knows if I can set up division in the
[53:28] spirit where things are catered to and
[53:32] things are you know moved upon then
[53:35] eventually it will lead to outward
[53:39] division come on friends you see it all
[53:43] starts within but within what happens
[53:47] it's cut off from the water supply
[53:50] because listen we are washed with the
[53:53] washing of water by the word
[54:04] I'm just trying to stay on track here
[54:09] you see this is why we listen to the
[54:12] message if listening to the message at
[54:15] home causes you to draw away from the
[54:18] rest of the body you're not being washed
[54:21] you're not getting what the message is
[54:25] all about you're hearing something and
[54:30] intellectually you are accumulating
[54:32] knowledge but you're not being watched
[54:35] because it's not a spirit of humility it
[54:42] is a spirit of vexation of self I hope
[54:48] you're with me now this is why a person
[54:54] say I pray every day boy I really did
[54:56] improve a lot and you want to withhold
[54:58] yourself from the body
[54:59] you're not making contact with God
[55:02] because you can't stand in the presence
[55:05] of God and hands remain with that lack
[55:09] of humility in your life come on
[55:14] somebody
[55:15] we're not to listen to the message as
[55:17] mere form you say I can't believe
[55:22] somebody would do that the Prophet said
[55:24] you can listen to it 24 hours a day but
[55:27] the spirit must be there to make it real
[55:30] and I'll tell you when the Holy Ghost
[55:33] makes the word real it brings you
[55:36] militate cause you recognize you're not
[55:40] the one who opened it up I just tell you
[55:48] so many times I'm walking and you know
[55:50] listening and Here I am in the car
[55:52] whoever how then I'm listening to the
[55:54] word I shake my head and bow my head how
[55:57] Christ the God and you know yeah I see
[56:00] it but what I see within it it brings a
[56:03] humanity
[56:07] that's the difference between listening
[56:10] and feeding I don't want you to be good
[56:16] listeners I want you to be fat as calves
[56:19] in the soil good feeders this is why
[56:27] brother random would say Shaitan won't
[56:32] let us stay one big sweet happy group
[56:35] it's his job to try to stir up stink you
[56:40] know why
[56:41] so there's parts of the word that are
[56:43] not favorable to this but it's got to be
[56:46] lived out hello somebody
[56:57] this is why the scripture exhorts us and
[57:01] once you think of this endeavor to keep
[57:06] the unity of the Spirit through the
[57:08] bonds of peace you know an endeavor
[57:09] means it's a military strategist and for
[57:14] the team what the bond of peace hello
[57:20] somebody sometimes those things that she
[57:23] does
[57:24] for the sake of unity yet you could say
[57:29] your plight and you'd be absolutely
[57:31] right come on you know what I'm done man
[57:34] but there's a part of it that you look
[57:37] beyond yourself and see the body you see
[57:43] the body you endeavor to keep the unity
[57:46] oh my now look at this in the book of
[57:51] Romans chapter 12 verse 3 Paul Center
[57:55] for I say through the grace given unto
[57:57] me that ever to every man that is among
[58:00] you not to think of himself more highly
[58:03] than he ought to think
[58:06] help me Jesus Lord help help help Jill
[58:10] help us Jesus for everybody else and on
[58:13] the internet too if Paul is writing this
[58:17] he ain't writing it to unbelievers he's
[58:22] writing it because Paul knows even in
[58:25] himself he had to have a messenger of
[58:28] Satan to buffer him and keep him down if
[58:35] your revelations don't come with thorns
[58:38] they ain't revelations come on now when
[58:45] God moves within your life then all of a
[58:48] sudden here afflictions are coming why
[58:50] is that affliction it is to allow that
[58:53] which God has sown to come forth in our
[58:57] lives but here's how were to do it but
[59:02] to think soberly
[59:06] taking the right frame of mind according
[59:10] as God hath dealt to every man the
[59:13] measure of faith the measure of faith
[59:20] God has dealt that not we I didn't earn
[59:26] it I didn't merit it faint soberly God
[59:29] has dealt what I have God dealt it to me
[59:36] Paul goes on now and says in verse 4 for
[59:39] as we have many members in one body and
[59:42] all members have not the same office so
[59:44] we being many are one body in Christ and
[59:46] every one members one of another
[59:53] now let's look at this in first
[59:55] Corinthians 12:12 with this this thought
[59:58] of it you see there is the body of Jesus
[1:00:03] Christ universal
[1:00:06] and then there are outposts brother
[1:00:11] random would call them outposts that are
[1:00:15] part of that great body like platoons
[1:00:20] that are in a regiment when we went
[1:00:24] there to Gettysburg last year I just
[1:00:26] stood there and I studied a lot of those
[1:00:29] things and I took pictures of those
[1:00:31] things on the wall and looked at it of
[1:00:32] how the different brigades and how that
[1:00:35] they were coming together and how that
[1:00:37] they were to be coordinated to work
[1:00:40] within the unity and harmony and I'm
[1:00:43] also very much was very much reminded of
[1:00:45] how that it was such a slim thin line
[1:00:49] where there was one particular man who
[1:00:51] was in charge day I think it's coming
[1:00:53] out of Devil's Rock that he came right
[1:00:55] out from there and he actually was gonna
[1:00:57] open it up and he did to where the Union
[1:01:00] would have been slaughtered by the
[1:01:01] Confederates because he thought he might
[1:01:04] just be able to do something but what he
[1:01:06] did he failed to stay within the orders
[1:01:10] that was given him man your posts stayed
[1:01:13] together with the rest that are on the
[1:01:15] front lines he almost cost the war I
[1:01:19] can't remember his name my father-in-law
[1:01:21] would probably remember and he's a
[1:01:22] walking history book but it comes right
[1:01:24] out of there and the man you know then
[1:01:26] within it it spoke to me in such a
[1:01:28] measure that literally maintain your
[1:01:31] position and always what God has said
[1:01:34] not what you think but stay where crowd
[1:01:37] has told you to stay their outposts that
[1:01:42] are part of that great body it's called
[1:01:44] a local body or an outpost now I want
[1:01:49] you to think of this as we read the
[1:01:50] scripture I want you to think of it
[1:01:51] universal and as well as local in verse
[1:01:55] 12 for as the body is one and hath many
[1:01:59] members and all the members of that one
[1:02:01] body being many are one body so also is
[1:02:05] Christ for by one spirit are we all
[1:02:08] baptized into one body
[1:02:11] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[1:02:14] we be bond or free and have been they
[1:02:17] haven't been all made to drink into one
[1:02:20] spirit Jesus don't give out different
[1:02:25] cups but he asked him he said can you
[1:02:28] drink the cup that I had drink can you
[1:02:34] be baptized with that once I am baptized
[1:02:37] with they said yeh Lord he said surely
[1:02:40] you shall be you see what I like about
[1:02:44] this is because the Holy Ghost
[1:02:46] it's given for the Jew and the Gentile
[1:02:50] hey man it's given for the bond and the
[1:02:53] free you see all the way through here
[1:02:57] within the New Testament you see where
[1:02:59] it was poured out upon the Jews the door
[1:03:01] was also open to the Gentiles and it
[1:03:03] will return back to the Jews you see
[1:03:06] that there were those who were servants
[1:03:08] who received the Holy Ghost come on now
[1:03:12] there were those who were masters and on
[1:03:14] and on and on you know that received and
[1:03:18] were a part of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:03:20] you see when it comes down to the Holy
[1:03:22] Ghost don't look at nobody's social
[1:03:24] standing the Holy Ghost don't look back
[1:03:28] and say oh you've been too bad of a
[1:03:30] person oh you got a bad pass you know
[1:03:33] the Holy Ghost looks back to the past of
[1:03:36] what are you were in the mind of God and
[1:03:39] that's why the Holy Ghost sucks you out
[1:03:42] he then seek you up it he don't care
[1:03:48] what your family name was he can to
[1:03:53] bring the identification of what your
[1:03:56] real family name is that's what I'm
[1:04:00] talking about
[1:04:00] [Applause]
[1:04:03] girl repeater God and so within that
[1:04:06] listen to me the Holy Ghost
[1:04:10] don't make them differences either
[1:04:15] somebody with me now
[1:04:17] but it's this guy right here sometimes
[1:04:22] it might seem a little bit more fearful
[1:04:29] hey Paul had to deal with it James had
[1:04:32] to deal with it and you and I have to
[1:04:34] deal with it verse 14 for the body is
[1:04:40] not one member but many aren't you glad
[1:04:43] if the foot now watch this how how it
[1:04:46] unfolds I know we're familiar with it
[1:04:47] but let's just look at it if the foot
[1:04:50] shall say because I am NOT for hand I'm
[1:04:54] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:04:57] the body and if the ear shall say
[1:04:59] because I am NOT the eye I am NOT of the
[1:05:03] body is it therefore not of the body I
[1:05:06] want you to catch this God knew were
[1:05:09] each and every one of us he knew if I
[1:05:12] would be that if I would be the then
[1:05:17] fingernail and think for me singing
[1:05:20] there on the pinky or maybe I'm the one
[1:05:22] on the toe you know that's kind of
[1:05:23] always kind of lopsided on the side
[1:05:25] pinky toe or whatever you call it I
[1:05:27] don't know God knew God knew exactly
[1:05:33] where you and I would be placed within
[1:05:37] this body just like he knew with Israel
[1:05:41] he already knew where each of them would
[1:05:43] well in the promised land Jacob here
[1:05:49] known as Israel was able to call them
[1:05:53] forth and he was able to tell them what
[1:05:55] shall befall them in the latter days he
[1:05:59] would speak of the characteristics of
[1:06:01] their name and he would identify that
[1:06:04] their name would actually positionally
[1:06:06] place them in the land there of Israel
[1:06:10] are you with me their names would
[1:06:13] position them there was an allotted
[1:06:15] portion that was there for them but
[1:06:17] nobody could take that but it would be
[1:06:21] ministered to them in that designated
[1:06:25] time so you see sometimes the way that
[1:06:29] things can work is with this this very
[1:06:33] thing I want you to see this this very
[1:06:35] thing can be so settled instead and it's
[1:06:38] divisive because what it what it is if
[1:06:41] it's part of the body look because I'm
[1:06:43] not the hand I'm not of the body because
[1:06:45] I'm nothing I am NOT of the body listen
[1:06:47] to me now this is what the foot and the
[1:06:51] ear are saying are you with me they're
[1:06:55] not outside of the body this is what's
[1:06:58] inside of the body but they're not
[1:07:01] recognizing their position and the value
[1:07:05] of the body of Jesus Christ and the
[1:07:08] value that God has placed them in a
[1:07:11] local body instead they're looking at
[1:07:15] another member and saying because I'm
[1:07:17] not that member I'm not of the body
[1:07:22] we're not to look at one another we're
[1:07:26] to lift in the word and see the
[1:07:28] reflection of Christ in our lives you
[1:07:32] see sometimes what is been felt to be
[1:07:36] humility is not humility at all well I'm
[1:07:41] not very good and you know if I could do
[1:07:44] this you know you know maybe I would you
[1:07:50] know maybe I would give a you know a
[1:07:54] testimony if I was okay to speak in a
[1:07:56] microphone or maybe I you know I just
[1:07:59] can't play real well or I just can't
[1:08:01] don't withhold what God has entrusted to
[1:08:06] you
[1:08:09] but the brand takes a young man brother
[1:08:13] Brown walks to the platform and in front
[1:08:15] of everybody
[1:08:15] brother bream says young man they knows
[1:08:18] the young man I don't have the quote
[1:08:20] posted up here but big bream says young
[1:08:24] man he says you've been wanting to know
[1:08:26] what your position is in the body he
[1:08:29] said in what you can do he said I
[1:08:31] believe he said I can tell you if you
[1:08:32] want to know and he said I see you
[1:08:35] singing he said the way that you sing
[1:08:37] out here he says if you'll just yield to
[1:08:39] them
[1:08:41] I want you to catch something he was
[1:08:43] already singing but he wasn't yielding
[1:08:45] to it so because he went in yielding to
[1:08:49] it there was a little bit of
[1:08:49] constriction on the flow if the devil
[1:08:54] can try to point out all of those things
[1:08:56] well you're not worth again you're not
[1:08:57] this and you're not this and there would
[1:08:59] be all brother Sam you know there'd be a
[1:09:01] better person here and there'd be a
[1:09:02] better person here
[1:09:05] recognize where God has called you to be
[1:09:08] come on somebody and recognize God
[1:09:12] didn't call you because you were fitted
[1:09:14] for it he doesn't call those that are
[1:09:18] qualified he qualifies the call he
[1:09:23] doesn't call the equipped he equips the
[1:09:26] call didn't to send that you can such a
[1:09:36] you know it's just like deacons or
[1:09:37] trustees it's like every any one of us
[1:09:39] if you don't reveal to the Lord Foley
[1:09:43] you might get up and sing you might
[1:09:45] testify and yet not fully yielding but
[1:09:49] when you can fully yield you stand there
[1:09:54] and faith to know that this part in my
[1:09:57] life that God has ordained in my life it
[1:10:00] is set forth to whet Devils be a
[1:10:05] blessing to the body come on somebody
[1:10:08] don't have four oh my let me just preach
[1:10:11] let me preach yield what you are
[1:10:15] let it be brother man would teach us
[1:10:17] over and over let it be sanctified to
[1:10:19] his calling and purpose and at all times
[1:10:22] be available
[1:10:26] if the whole body look how paul interest
[1:10:29] is if the whole body were an eye where
[1:10:31] we're the hearing if the whole we're
[1:10:33] hearing where were the smelling
[1:10:36] can you imagine brother bond just a big
[1:10:39] glimmer a ssin of eyeballs you talk
[1:10:42] about a monster this is the body of
[1:10:45] Jesus Christ
[1:10:46] everybody is eyeballs everybody don't
[1:10:49] need to be eyes everybody don't need to
[1:10:54] be ears the ears are needed for certain
[1:10:59] things and God gave us what was needed
[1:11:03] two ears one mouth let me just say to
[1:11:11] you
[1:11:12] those are your ears you guard them
[1:11:15] they're not like two bins that you set
[1:11:18] out there for trash day where one
[1:11:20] collects trash and the other reflects
[1:11:23] recyclable gossip preach brother son our
[1:11:28] ears are not trash cans here's an aide
[1:11:32] to hear God's voice
[1:11:36] these lips and mouth were made to speak
[1:11:40] that which would edify the body
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:47] that was free but now God look at this
[1:11:53] man now God set the members every one of
[1:11:57] them in the body as it hath pleased him
[1:12:01] and if they were all one member where
[1:12:02] were the body yeah no can you match have
[1:12:06] a bunch of arms it'd be the human
[1:12:08] octopus a bunch of legs come on somebody
[1:12:15] but now are they many members yet but
[1:12:18] one body and the eye I want you to watch
[1:12:22] this change what's this change in this
[1:12:25] verse and the eye cannot say unto the
[1:12:28] hand I have no need of you notice the
[1:12:31] change
[1:12:31] it went from because I'm not this now it
[1:12:34] changes because I am the eye
[1:12:39] I cannot say unto the hand I have no
[1:12:41] need of thee
[1:12:45] neither can anybody that's a part of the
[1:12:47] body say what because we've received the
[1:12:50] eyes of God the prophet of God we have
[1:12:53] no need of the rest of the body liar
[1:12:56] we do have need of the entire body and
[1:13:00] the eyes are not outside of the body but
[1:13:04] the eyes are in the body that's why
[1:13:09] brother Brennan would say over and over
[1:13:11] and over he is manifesting himself in
[1:13:14] his church in these last days through
[1:13:18] the ministry that he has given to us
[1:13:22] never was divisive never was separation
[1:13:31] Estonia V well we could preach this
[1:13:38] thing nor again the head to the feet I
[1:13:42] have no need of you you see it still
[1:13:46] self this guy every day got to be
[1:13:53] crucified because one is looking at
[1:13:59] because I'm not this
[1:14:01] it's envy and then the other it comes
[1:14:04] around into another part I'm the eye I
[1:14:07] don't need no need of the hand
[1:14:10] remember what the hand represent both
[1:14:12] we're gonna preach to Helen yeah you
[1:14:14] know what the hand represents the hand
[1:14:16] represents the power of God they meant
[1:14:21] God operating through his people the
[1:14:24] Bible says in the book of Peter humble
[1:14:28] yourselves under the mighty hand of God
[1:14:31] is that right it was the hand of God
[1:14:34] that came upon Elijah when the minstrel
[1:14:37] played a lot of freebies coming out here
[1:14:44] one is envy and the other is pride and
[1:14:47] we all have to battle that thing well
[1:14:56] what's that thing called well whatever
[1:14:57] your first name is that's what it is
[1:15:00] mine is Samuel come on somebody laugh so
[1:15:05] if I can get now brother branham I can
[1:15:07] get william branham out of the way Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ can have a good time you see you
[1:15:16] are part of Christ by the Holy Ghost and
[1:15:19] so a mine
[1:15:21] we are part of each other then I need
[1:15:25] you I need the Christ in you and
[1:15:29] understand what I'm saying I need you to
[1:15:32] be you I don't need you to be somebody
[1:15:37] else you don't need me to be somebody
[1:15:40] else you need me just to yield and let
[1:15:42] God use according to what he is ordained
[1:15:45] for me oh my
[1:15:48] so to think of it verse twenty-two
[1:15:50] everybody okay if you're not we couldn't
[1:15:54] hear you
[1:15:54] verse 22 yay much more those members of
[1:15:59] the body

[1:16:05] to be more feeble are necessary

[1:16:13] can't even see if they're right brother
[1:16:16] Dave there's parts of it you can't see
[1:16:20] my liver tonight

[1:16:49] something going on in the unseen what is
[1:16:54] it you can look at and say well I don't
[1:16:57] seem to have a vital part in taking this
[1:17:00] around but without belongs this can't do

[1:18:23] mechanical dialysis machine we have got
[1:18:27] the cleansing power

[1:19:06] pray for them let me tell you something
[1:19:08] what you're doing you're yielding to a
[1:19:10] Ministry of the Holy Ghost that's within
[1:19:13] the body to minister to his children I
[1:19:18] don't want to be an insulator of the
[1:19:22] Holy Ghost I don't want to be a
[1:19:24] conductor how do I know there's a good
[1:19:31] pass through on this electric running
[1:19:33] through here I see the lights I don't
[1:19:37] see brother Carlos I don't see them
[1:19:38] wires thank God I don't but I don't see
[1:19:40] them wife but I know they're doing that
[1:19:42] job every part is needful
[1:19:56] every part shanitha
[1:20:03] you think about it Michael you can't see
[1:20:05] my stomach but if my hands don't yield
[1:20:10] to the signals in my brain then this guy
[1:20:14] that's it's calling out you know it's
[1:20:16] calling out for nourishment
[1:20:17] you know why without nourishment this is
[1:20:21] not able to function like it ought to so
[1:20:25] I need to borrow the hand to grab a hold
[1:20:28] of the fork or the spoon and I need to
[1:20:31] eat it's a stomach the stomach ought to
[1:20:34] get its own food no God has made it so
[1:20:37] it's dependent upon one another
[1:20:41] well this that I mean the sales just you
[1:20:44] know the sales they're part of the body
[1:20:46] of Jesus Christ they ought to just get
[1:20:48] their own nutrients no they are
[1:20:50] dependent on the physical body taking in
[1:20:54] the nutrients into that and then the
[1:20:57] digestive system breaking it down and
[1:20:59] then it moving through all of those
[1:21:01] other systems respiratory system
[1:21:03] circulatory system nervous system it's
[1:21:07] necessary and one thing I'm glad about
[1:21:10] it gets where it needs to be sometimes
[1:21:16] my wife looks at me she said you just
[1:21:19] need to eat now don't the rest of you
[1:21:24] look at me like angels like that either
[1:21:26] you know exactly what I'm talking about
[1:21:27] she just you know put on here it's made
[1:21:37] to be mutually dependent upon others
[1:21:41] verse 23 and those members of the body
[1:21:45] which we think to be less honorable upon
[1:21:49] these we bestow so we're mindful upon
[1:21:54] these we bestow more abundant honour and
[1:21:57] our uncomely parts have more abundant
[1:22:00] comeliness for our comely parts have no
[1:22:04] need but God hath tempered the body
[1:22:08] together
[1:22:09] having given more abundant honor honor
[1:22:12] to that part which lacked
[1:22:20] you don't spend a hundred dollars on
[1:22:21] things to cover your face but just being
[1:22:25] close to $100 for shoes on your feet
[1:22:32] the faith it'll spend something to cover
[1:22:34] it but the other parts of our body we
[1:22:38] close are you with me you know what that
[1:22:43] means for the Brian sometimes that means
[1:22:45] we have to say not on clearance yet we
[1:22:49] got to put back for it come on now y'all
[1:22:52] know what I'm talking about you got kids
[1:22:53] you see they need shoes shoes are coming
[1:22:56] up or they they need jeans hello my
[1:23:00] holes and Swiss cheese in them and you
[1:23:02] look and you think man well we got to
[1:23:06] sit back for this right here we're gonna
[1:23:07] get get him some James
[1:23:14] what am I saying sometimes it takes a
[1:23:17] lot of investment on the uncomely parts
[1:23:22] this is why I love covered the multitude
[1:23:25] of sin this is why the body we do not
[1:23:29] delight in wrong come on somebody we do
[1:23:35] not delight in wrong
[1:23:37] we don't delight it's not about hiding
[1:23:40] sin
[1:23:41] but we we we desire you know it's like
[1:23:45] look remember Balak Balak looks and he
[1:23:48] pointed out all the highlander parts
[1:23:50] come on somebody we don't want that
[1:23:54] Balak anointing punting out all the
[1:23:56] honda parts who when Balaam they're the
[1:24:00] sacrifices were offered and the stand
[1:24:02] and the Spirit of God came upon Balaam
[1:24:04] one that he did not speak of all their
[1:24:07] Honda parts and let me tell you
[1:24:09] something
[1:24:09] they had uncomely heiner parts if
[1:24:14] anybody could have been criticized and
[1:24:17] shredded and pour down they could have
[1:24:21] but let me tell you something there was
[1:24:24] a covenant that they were under and God
[1:24:28] Himself god knows just how to stand up
[1:24:31] he ain't gonna let him get by with sin
[1:24:33] but neither is God gonna let somebody
[1:24:36] waddle up criticize him what feed on him
[1:24:39] but God said they're my children I sent
[1:24:42] a message down there I shed the blood I
[1:24:44] brought them out God said I ain't gonna
[1:24:50] let a loose tongue time down but I said
[1:24:54] my voice
[1:25:01] what wisdom you know what wisdom verse
[1:25:07] 25 that there should be no schism in the
[1:25:13] body
[1:25:13] what's that division but that the
[1:25:17] members should have the same care one
[1:25:20] for the other and whether one member
[1:25:23] suffer all the members suffer with it or
[1:25:26] one member be honored all the members
[1:25:28] rejoice with it
[1:25:39] brother BAM looked up on Oral Roberts
[1:25:42] place and said Lord yes you couldn't
[1:25:46] trust me
[1:25:48] he gave Oral Roberts a place like this
[1:25:51] yes you couldn't trust me with something
[1:25:53] like that
[1:25:59] but God said
[1:26:02] look up
[1:26:06] I'm your portion
[1:26:19] brother brandon got to criticizing I
[1:26:21] know it's ain't popular but it's truth I
[1:26:23] preached all the message not just the
[1:26:26] quotes that are favorable
[1:26:31] brother Brahim stands there this is in
[1:26:33] the India trip word made flesh also in
[1:26:35] the Holy Ghost series brother Bram talks
[1:26:38] about how he got to criticizing another
[1:26:40] man he was reading his book and then he
[1:26:41] got to seen with this man and some of
[1:26:43] the things on the sidelines let me just
[1:26:45] tell you though I'm not gonna call the
[1:26:47] man's name that he was criticizing but
[1:26:49] Humana looked at it and that man there
[1:26:51] were some things that could have been
[1:26:52] criticized but the holy ghost rebuked
[1:26:56] the Prophet and brother Bram says I
[1:26:58] realized I've got a selfish critical
[1:27:01] spirit on me
[1:27:03] that's when he identifies it as he goes
[1:27:05] on in the message Jubilee year and talks
[1:27:07] about it's all in the same realm in
[1:27:10] years and months see this is why I can
[1:27:13] follow a man like this God's already
[1:27:17] vindicated this is the truth I'm under
[1:27:20] the sail of the Holy Ghost in this word
[1:27:23] but I can look at that you don't bother
[1:27:26] me cuz you know why I see the same
[1:27:30] battles but there's one thing about it I
[1:27:35] see but profit was man enough to admit
[1:27:38] it and humble enough to Humble himself
[1:27:41] and say light cleanse me where he could
[1:27:46] even say I'm gonna blast my heart out
[1:27:58] divine wisdom put it all together this
[1:28:02] is where in this scripture how I'm
[1:28:04] coming down I was just gonna we're just
[1:28:06] gonna have to close here there's just no
[1:28:08] way in the world I can I can finish this
[1:28:12] out but divine wisdom has put this
[1:28:15] together so the members of the body are
[1:28:21] not to have that of schisms I want you
[1:28:27] to listen this it's not to be divided
[1:28:30] from each other and acting upon separate
[1:28:34] interest that's as the body universal
[1:28:41] and as a local body that's why it's in
[1:28:46] in a local body if a person starts
[1:28:48] acting in their own interest then
[1:28:50] they've got to make a decision either
[1:28:52] you keep moving with this platoon or you
[1:28:56] ask God if you need to be assigned to
[1:28:58] another one I'm just gonna preach
[1:29:01] straight because when you begin to act
[1:29:04] in your own interest you're not acting
[1:29:07] according to the Holy Ghost when you put
[1:29:12] your needs above the rest of the body
[1:29:14] that is not the Holy Ghost hallelujah
[1:29:22] but it ought to be where it is
[1:29:26] well affected to each other tenderly
[1:29:29] concerned for one another and feeling in
[1:29:33] the griefs and a communion as well as in
[1:29:36] one another's pleasures and joys
[1:29:41] sometimes where it's somebody's
[1:29:44] experiencing a joy and you're not
[1:29:46] experiencing a joy come on somebody this
[1:29:52] is where sacrifice comes in sacrifice
[1:29:58] that there would be no schism in the
[1:30:00] body that all members would be we're
[1:30:05] under that bond of love let me just say
[1:30:06] this to you when affection begins to
[1:30:12] decay those are the seeds of schism
[1:30:22] when Christians grow cold toward one
[1:30:26] another they become careless and
[1:30:30] unconcerned for each other
[1:30:39] well I'm not coming to church because
[1:30:41] the piano is too loud you're selfish
[1:30:48] well I'm not coming to church because
[1:30:54] don't withhold your puzzle-piece realize
[1:30:58] it's a peace that came from God and the
[1:31:02] greatest way you're gonna lie I'm gonna
[1:31:04] I'm gonna hold this piece and I'm just
[1:31:06] gonna hold this piece
[1:31:09] you're not going in the rapture by
[1:31:11] yourself you're gonna have to let go of
[1:31:17] the peace and let it come with the rest
[1:31:19] of the body and if you do that we'll see
[1:31:24] more of the picture
[1:31:33] don't lose that love
[1:31:40] where you grow cold and indifferent the
[1:31:43] dude says in Jude 1 keep yourselves in
[1:31:46] the love of God
[1:31:48] keep yourselves praying in the Holy
[1:31:53] Ghost let us make ourselves available
[1:31:59] unto God available now once you just -
[1:32:04] just to think of this here for a moment
[1:32:08] Paul goes on to say here I'm not gonna
[1:32:10] read these verses but let me just refer
[1:32:12] to him can I do that and just drop this
[1:32:15] point Paul goes on and he goes on to
[1:32:19] reiterate we are members in the body in
[1:32:22] particular he goes on to say are we all
[1:32:25] apostles are we all profits and God said
[1:32:29] some in the church and God said them in
[1:32:30] their have all gifts of healing do all
[1:32:33] speak with tongues interpret but in
[1:32:35] verse 31 at first Corinthians 12 I do
[1:32:37] want you to put that one up there but
[1:32:39] covet earnestly the best gifts and yet
[1:32:46] show I unto you a more excellent way
[1:32:52] Paul don't take away the gifts but he's
[1:32:55] shown and letting them be under the
[1:32:56] governance of love are all of us gifted
[1:33:00] the same way no even those of us that
[1:33:05] would have
[1:33:07] the same gift but yet we're not the same
[1:33:15] you couldn't go to somebody else I know
[1:33:18] if you're gonna be a pastor we're gonna
[1:33:20] have to be exactly like brother Samuel
[1:33:22] no God is not a cooker cookie cutter God
[1:33:26] you with me that's why God had there's
[1:33:29] such a diversity of gifts man I who I
[1:33:34] mean there's brothers that can just ten
[1:33:36] and just teach it take the PowerPoint
[1:33:37] and go right through and whip the devil
[1:33:41] I think lord have mercy how do they do
[1:33:42] that without sweaty begin understand I
[1:33:47] just have to do and in my simple way
[1:33:50] that God has given me
[1:33:54] and not try to do this and there might
[1:33:57] be times like I have used that in the
[1:33:58] past that I felt like that was what God
[1:34:00] wanted me to do for that service or
[1:34:02] services but I you know that that's
[1:34:04] really not my forte if I can say it that
[1:34:08] way I'm like a duck out of water and
[1:34:10] those types of things like that but God
[1:34:15] he made us all different God made as
[1:34:22] special singers even those who sing
[1:34:25] specials he made you different practice
[1:34:28] makes me nervous
[1:34:31] that's me I like singing about like
[1:34:34] seeing of everybody young with me I like
[1:34:37] singing with everybody the practice
[1:34:39] makes me nervous
[1:34:41] get it up like this or get it up like
[1:34:43] that let me give a mic and let's let her
[1:34:45] fly
[1:34:47] let's just see what Jesus does when he
[1:34:49] comes on the scene but you see if I try
[1:34:52] to do it the other way I'm not that
[1:34:53] he'll dick
[1:34:59] this is why Paul could say that the
[1:35:01] Church of the Living God is the manifold
[1:35:03] wisdom of God
[1:35:05] that means variegated with Brian when
[1:35:07] you picked out your landscaping you
[1:35:09] don't get a bunch of barberries and put
[1:35:11] them all around the house but you get
[1:35:12] barberries and you have yellow ones and
[1:35:14] then you have an accent of a blue spruce
[1:35:15] and then you have this little plum tree
[1:35:17] you have this of a yellow lily coming up
[1:35:19] at this time and it all accents one
[1:35:23] another and stands out just like my hand
[1:35:29] does not look like my eye my mouth does
[1:35:33] not look like my nose God hath put it
[1:35:37] all together it's the manifold wisdom of
[1:35:41] God
[1:35:44] you see every gift it works together to
[1:35:48] edify the body of Jesus Christ brother
[1:35:54] Brad would say it like this and I'm just
[1:35:56] going to close every person in the
[1:35:59] church and I want you to listen to me
[1:36:00] now if you can hone home right in on
[1:36:03] this every person so might say every
[1:36:06] person look at somebody say that's you
[1:36:10] just making sure you're awake and every
[1:36:14] person in the church has an individual
[1:36:17] ministry
[1:36:19] and that individual ministry goes
[1:36:24] together with the rest of the ministry
[1:36:28] to edify the body of Jesus Christ
[1:36:33] there's a little sister just to show you
[1:36:37] this in Romans 16 I love these little
[1:36:40] things in the scriptures

[1:36:45] Phoebe it's Romans 16 verse 1

[1:36:53] to many of the churches brother Brian
[1:36:54] and he would tell him and from Aquila
[1:36:56] and Priscilla Olson you know why people
[1:37:02] knew the character their lives and it
[1:37:04] was a comfort to it it'd be like Dave
