[35:33] you
[35:34] since i'm getting older
[35:36] and one day i'm gonna go home
[35:38] in 1984
[35:40] i went with james browning to honduras
[35:43] for the first time
[35:46] we went to some pastors meeting in
[35:48] honduras
[35:49] and
[35:51] i was out in i said the boonies you know
[35:54] and
[35:55] towards the end of the meetings you know
[35:57] i never did interpret
[35:59] and uh
[36:01] with the sisters they made some food
[36:04] and their food
[36:06] it was for the pastors the browning ate
[36:08] a little bit
[36:09] and the pastors they later on to us as
[36:13] the evening got they started getting
[36:15] bellyaches
[36:17] the food was messing up their stomach
[36:20] and i remember
[36:21] the brothers that we the brother we that
[36:23] took us there we
[36:26] he didn't put enough gas in the truck so
[36:28] we went around about nine or ten o'clock
[36:30] at night looking for a gas station to go
[36:32] back into the capital
[36:33] but the uh all they had was armed guards
[36:36] and those gas stations
[36:38] so we headed back to the to the to
[36:41] where they had the meetings
[36:42] they took brother browning and put them
[36:44] on a mattress on the floor and they took
[36:46] me to the church and i slept on the
[36:48] cement floor with a little sheet over me
[36:52] about five o'clock in the morning i felt
[36:54] stomach pain so i got up and in those
[36:56] places they have art houses so i got up
[36:58] and went to the outhouse
[37:00] and it wasn't there too long when
[37:01] somebody was trying to get in it was
[37:02] brother browning
[37:04] so i got up and i left them in there and
[37:07] i i went i went from about to
[37:10] where that organ is and i
[37:13] and it was just getting about
[37:15] i'd say
[37:17] daylight
[37:19] and
[37:21] all of a sudden
[37:22] to my right a supernatural being
[37:24] appeared
[37:26] it was a man like on fire
[37:28] and you could see the outline of a man
[37:32] and i looked at that
[37:35] i didn't even know how long that that
[37:37] lasted all i know is here's daylight but
[37:40] the bronx not there
[37:42] so
[37:44] they came running to me the american or
[37:47] the americano
[37:49] so i went running to where he was at
[37:51] they were holding him down he said let
[37:53] tell them to let me go the lord heal me
[37:58] so
[37:59] we went on and and he went on to the
[38:01] capitol and he preached a tremendous
[38:03] message
[38:05] i'll tell you what
[38:07] i was just knew in the message
[38:09] but when he preached that message
[38:12] and he was going into the chuck and the
[38:14] seed and all that and he took his
[38:15] overhead projector back then and i
[38:18] remember him
[38:22] i didn't know all the
[38:23] the terminology you know so i
[38:25] so i uh
[38:28] he took a pause and there was a brother
[38:30] from nicaragua and felipe wrote felipe i
[38:33] said come here felipe this is the
[38:35] bride's message and i don't want to take
[38:37] anything away from her
[38:38] so i sat down
[38:41] he did he preached
[38:42] brother sisters
[38:44] he didn't have to tell him to stand up
[38:46] the whole church stood up in unison with
[38:48] her hands up
[38:52] that's the message of the hour

[46:25] brother branham
[46:28] are you hearing me
[46:29] it's thus saith the lord from the throne
[46:31] of god
[46:32] [Applause]
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] are you hearing me

[46:49] came with a word and began to speak to
[46:51] him and after the prophet's message
[46:55] the angel of the lord came
[46:57] with that message who gave it and came
[47:00] personally to gideon and said you're the
[47:02] one he's talking about

[55:41] ought to be
[55:44] praise god
[55:50] acts 7
[55:57] and verse 17.
[56:03] i want you to pay close attention to
[56:04] that
[56:05] but when the time of the promise
[56:09] drew nine
[56:10] which god had sworn to abraham
[56:13] the people grew and multiplied in egypt
[56:17] till another king arose which knew not
[56:21] joseph
[56:23] the same dealt separately
[56:25] with
[56:26] our kendricks and evil entreated our
[56:29] fathers so that they cast out the young
[56:33] children
[56:35] to the end that they might not live
[56:38] and i like this where i take my thought
[56:39] from
[56:41] in which time moses was born
[56:44] and was exceedingly fair and nourished
[56:47] up in his father's house for three
[56:49] months
[56:51] and let's go if you will
[56:54] things that ought to be
[56:59] very important he says now
[57:03] he says
[57:04] you now
[57:05] now you you grew from your birth
[57:08] when you were born and presented into
[57:11] this world
[57:13] god knew that you were going to be here
[57:15] how many know god knows you're going to
[57:16] be here

[57:20] and you grew from your birth to maturity

[57:34] understand it when you was a child but

[57:43] just right

[57:46] you it really meant something to you it
[57:49] really means something to you now
[57:51] the spiritual and the spirit excuse me
[57:54] and it is in your spiritual birth
[57:57] you do things that you don't understand
[58:00] when you a little baby you come here to
[58:02] alter you give your life to christ it's
[58:05] such strange things like that and you
[58:07] wonder why you did it but after a while
[58:10] when you mature as a mature christian
[58:12] then you understand it see there's
[58:15] something picks up you see why you have
[58:18] to do these things your spiritual birth

[1:02:13] at a certain time
[1:02:15] i ain't talking about your natural birth
[1:02:17] but i'm talking about your spiritual
[1:02:19] birth
[1:02:21] glory
[1:02:23] god knew you would be here
[1:02:25] he pre-planned your birth
[1:02:28] how many things it ought to be god
[1:02:29] pre-playing your listen he pre-playing
[1:02:32] the family that you're in
[1:02:35] you may not believe that but you're not
[1:02:37] here just all of a sudden it happened
[1:02:39] no god pre-planned it
[1:02:42] you wouldn't be here this morning if god
[1:02:44] didn't want you here
[1:02:45] he pre-planned it
[1:02:47] you said somebody invited me i felt like
[1:02:50] coming where did it come from
[1:02:52] who put it inside of you where did the
[1:02:55] desire come from it had to come from god
[1:02:58] glory
[1:03:00] notice
[1:03:02] your mother and father
[1:03:04] when they came together
[1:03:07] i'm trying to say it you know for the
[1:03:09] young people you know because these
[1:03:10] young people were kind of shocked
[1:03:12] but when your mother and father came
[1:03:14] together
[1:03:15] your mother had one egg
[1:03:18] glory
[1:03:19] and that one egg
[1:03:22] are you listening
[1:03:24] your father had millions of sperms
[1:03:28] i'd say hundreds of sperms
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:32] when your mother and father came
[1:03:33] together
[1:03:35] are you listening
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:37] gloria when your mother and father came
[1:03:39] together
[1:03:41] and your father injected the sperms
[1:03:44] going into your mother
[1:03:46] all those sperms was looking for that
[1:03:48] egg
[1:03:50] do you know that not just one all those
[1:03:52] sperms was trying to find that aid
[1:03:54] that's right
[1:03:55] but some soviet grace of god some mighty
[1:03:58] power of god as they begin to go try to
[1:04:01] find an egg guess what you hit the egg
[1:04:05] the reason why you hit the egg
[1:04:07] because what god wanted you born for
[1:04:10] this time
[1:04:11] god wanted you in this time this age you
[1:04:14] say no matter whether you're a crook or
[1:04:16] saint or whatever god wanted you in this
[1:04:18] age
[1:04:20] are you listening
[1:04:21] because what he said the natural birth
[1:04:23] he was able to take that natural birth
[1:04:25] and pre-plan that natural birth where he
[1:04:27] can turn it to his spiritual birth
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:31] hurry and when you hit that egg
[1:04:33] the bad part about it is
[1:04:36] potentially
[1:04:38] you had a lot of brothers and sisters
[1:04:40] that you didn't know
[1:04:41] that didn't even come into existence
[1:04:46] when you hit the egg if they weren't
[1:04:48] twins so y'all twins you better thank
[1:04:50] god cause one of y'all would have been
[1:04:52] here
[1:04:57] that one egg about to
[1:04:59] let church say amen
[1:05:00] glory so if you're a twin you're oh god
[1:05:03] thank you for being so good to me
[1:05:05] because i couldn't have been here glory
[1:05:07] but god by his sovereign grace you hit
[1:05:10] the a and brother branham says rest of
[1:05:12] them died off why did they die because
[1:05:14] you were predestinated you were born for
[1:05:17] this time you were born for this eight
[1:05:19] and that you were born for this message
[1:05:22] you were born at the right time
[1:05:24] [Applause]
[1:05:25] i hear people
[1:05:27] hear people in a christian walk
[1:05:29] sometimes oh i had a bad life
[1:05:32] you know and what happened to me
[1:05:34] my mama left me and my daddy left me we
[1:05:37] didn't have nobody to take care of that
[1:05:39] ain't got nothing to do with your birth
[1:05:44] that's just bad things happen in life
[1:05:47] god pre-planned your birth
[1:05:49] matter of fact if you want he be playing
[1:05:51] your trials
[1:05:53] every child is a son or daughter god is
[1:05:55] predestinated

[1:16:20] your marble
[1:16:21] not in your daddy the only one who have
[1:16:23] eternal life is jesus christ
[1:16:25] and jesus said gloria if you don't
[1:16:27] believe our heat you will die in your
[1:16:31] sins but you've got to believe that it
[1:16:33] is
[1:16:34] that he's the word
[1:16:36] glory
[1:16:38] you know
[1:16:39] moses mother and father
[1:16:41] the pressure got on him
[1:16:43] they had to figure out what they gonna
[1:16:44] do with this boy because the law was
[1:16:46] kill every child you know young male
[1:16:48] child
[1:16:49] but moses mother and father knew so
[1:16:50] listen i don't know what it is but he's
[1:16:53] born for he's born at the right time
[1:16:55] he's not born in any age he's born i'm
[1:16:57] going to take a few more but i want to
[1:16:59] get this here he's born at a time that
[1:17:01] listen god may be doing something
[1:17:04] because we know that the time for the
[1:17:06] time for the delivery to come
[1:17:08] i don't know it could be in my house
[1:17:11] hallelujah curry and so what the what
[1:17:14] she did they said couldn't go no longer
[1:17:16] the fbi or whatever the they kept coming
[1:17:19] to the house trying to say it because
[1:17:21] everybody was telling they they lost
[1:17:23] their child they didn't give them up but
[1:17:24] moses mother and father said uh-uh
[1:17:27] glory this child is a special child
[1:17:30] i ain't letting him go
[1:17:33] so finally they did all they could i
[1:17:34] could imagine i'm just drunk so oh god
[1:17:36] what are we gonna do
[1:17:38] and then look god says see that little
[1:17:39] basket right there

[1:18:04] bible school for is to learn some kind
[1:18:06] of man wisdom of god

[1:24:05] go ahead and they got that basket
[1:24:08] brother
[1:24:11] they got their basket
[1:24:12] and when they got that basket
[1:24:14] they put moses in there
[1:24:17] they get ready
[1:24:18] you know to
[1:24:20] put him in the
[1:24:21] put him in the river
[1:24:23] now and
[1:24:24] wonder what god god said
[1:24:26] put a little turpin time on that's it
[1:24:29] you know
[1:24:31] and he put some turpentine
[1:24:33] sprinkled around that you know
[1:24:36] glory
[1:24:37] put moses in and i can imagine so lord
[1:24:40] please take care of my child we don't we
[1:24:42] don't want nothing to happen to him
[1:24:45] listen
[1:24:48] i can hear god say y'all took it long as
[1:24:51] you can
[1:24:52] you don't went as far as you can go
[1:24:55] now let me have it
[1:25:00] they put moses in the river
[1:25:03] and god said i need to take care of him
[1:25:07] it's a paradox
[1:25:10] but it's true anyhow god said let you
[1:25:12] know what pharaoh's daughter she don't
[1:25:14] have no children i'm gonna make her in
[1:25:15] love with this boy
[1:25:19] gloria why that's right while all of us
[1:25:22] killing babies and everything god had
[1:25:24] pharaoh daughters i'm gonna make her so
[1:25:25] in love with him even pharaoh won't even
[1:25:27] know
[1:25:29] that he ain't hers
[1:25:32] and when moses got there crying she fell
[1:25:35] so in love with moses picked him up
[1:25:37] glory why god was going to take care of
[1:25:40] him when god works for you when god is
[1:25:43] for you when god gives you a job when
[1:25:45] god gives you a company i don't care how
[1:25:48] much the boss hates you
[1:25:50] they can't do nothing until god tell
[1:25:52] them the king head is in the hand of the
[1:25:55] lord
[1:25:57] and she took moses
[1:26:00] and she loved him
[1:26:02] he was born
[1:26:04] at the right time
[1:26:06] now let me go let me go a little further
[1:26:07] let me go you know they tell me people
[1:26:10] you know winston churchill i'm in no
[1:26:11] whistle church here you used to be a we
[1:26:13] should be a prime minister for england
[1:26:15] nobody really like winston churchill
[1:26:17] he's the prime minister he used to drink
[1:26:18] all the time
[1:26:20] praise god glory even in the parliament
[1:26:22] he'd be drunk
[1:26:24] but they couldn't help but he was a part
[1:26:25] he was a he was a prime minister
[1:26:27] and one thing i liked about him
[1:26:30] glory when germany had to pin down had
[1:26:33] had england
[1:26:34] surrounded they couldn't do nothing they
[1:26:36] said well what we need to do is we got
[1:26:39] to surrender
[1:26:40] the church is no we're not surrendered
[1:26:42] we got to surrender he got everybody
[1:26:44] finally all the parliament said we're
[1:26:46] going to surrender
[1:26:47] and then
[1:26:48] churchill was kind of they they figured
[1:26:50] his judgments you know sometimes people
[1:26:52] think the past like that he makes
[1:26:54] certain judgments something wrong with
[1:26:55] him because they they know it you know
[1:26:57] glory oh don't get quiet
[1:26:59] people do that i don't know why the
[1:27:00] pastor said that i i know this
[1:27:03] but churchill said no we ain't
[1:27:04] surrendering
[1:27:06] and they said but the parliament said we
[1:27:07] were surrounded germany go take over he
[1:27:09] said he surrendered it he got up he left
[1:27:12] out the office went down and he just
[1:27:14] left before he finished that they got
[1:27:16] before he got into he got there and he
[1:27:19] wouldn't even ride the limousine
[1:27:21] they thought he was drunk
[1:27:24] so he got it so he got on a train
[1:27:27] and here's the prime minister riding the
[1:27:30] underground
[1:27:31] so he gets on the train he started and
[1:27:33] when he got on there a few people looked
[1:27:35] at him the young girl the man looked and
[1:27:37] they got up and promised he said don't
[1:27:38] worry about it glory so they wonder
[1:27:40] what's going on
[1:27:42] and then as he on the plane he actually
[1:27:44] on the train he asked a question he says
[1:27:47] shall i surrender to germany and said
[1:27:48] before we die and a lady stood up says i
[1:27:51] would never surrender i'll die for my
[1:27:53] country
[1:27:56] and the people on the plane said we'll
[1:27:57] die for our country
[1:28:00] so what happened was churchill he got
[1:28:02] playing you know rolled back got back
[1:28:05] got back to the
[1:28:06] close by where the parliament was
[1:28:09] they come into office and they said mr
[1:28:12] mr president mr prime minister what we
[1:28:13] gonna do
[1:28:15] he says uh
[1:28:16] we ain't surrendering what everybody
[1:28:18] holly actually what's wrong with you
[1:28:20] germany got he said we ain't
[1:28:22] surrendering
[1:28:24] i'm ready to die for my country
[1:28:27] and they said prime medicine why you
[1:28:29] change your mind why you change your
[1:28:30] mind you know what his answer was if you
[1:28:32] can't change your mind you can't change
[1:28:35] nothing
[1:28:37] and i say that today you can walk in as
[1:28:40] a sinner if you can't change your mind
[1:28:43] to be a christian you can't change
[1:28:46] anything
[1:28:49] that is the easiest thing you can do
[1:28:52] is change your mind that's the easiest
[1:28:54] thing this will change your mind
[1:28:58] and of course you know germany went on
[1:28:59] to win the war
[1:29:01] i mean uh england went on to win the war
[1:29:04] but you have to have somebody that's
[1:29:06] born at the right time
[1:29:09] you got to have somebody that know where
[1:29:11] they stand at the right time
[1:29:13] glory can i take someone let me take a
[1:29:16] biblical one then i'll go back
[1:29:18] goliath
[1:29:19] israel
[1:29:21] they had israel pinned
[1:29:22] down glory
[1:29:25] and
[1:29:26] everybody glides to somebody
[1:29:29] we need some man to fight us
[1:29:32] and all of us scared
[1:29:34] because you know
[1:29:36] usually the one god won't they overlook
[1:29:38] them
[1:29:40] when samuel was sent
[1:29:42] to the house of jesse
[1:29:44] to get a king
[1:29:47] they made sure that jesse that uh david
[1:29:50] didn't entertain the king
[1:29:52] they kept him out there with the sheets
[1:29:55] all that church saved me
[1:29:57] so what they did they had said uh
[1:30:01] david jesse had his oldest boy to come
[1:30:04] he had just finished
[1:30:06] school he had just oh he was a very
[1:30:08] astute vet person
[1:30:10] no god would go to he dressed right he
[1:30:13] act right he he just might he just smile
[1:30:15] what we call that uh he does my model
[1:30:17] son
[1:30:20] and when he brought him in front of
[1:30:21] glory brought him in front of samuel and
[1:30:24] he tried to take that all the way off
[1:30:26] god said i don't want it
[1:30:29] what you mean
[1:30:31] god said not him
[1:30:33] and jesse said well maybe it's the next
[1:30:35] boy
[1:30:36] i'm gonna bring out yeah he's just been
[1:30:37] getting to go to his uh he's going there
[1:30:40] let me let me i don't want to because i
[1:30:41] want nobody to think that his college
[1:30:43] but anyway he's just getting ready to go
[1:30:45] in this first year college i know
[1:30:50] don't get me wrong now
[1:30:51] okay and so he coming at the prophet
[1:30:54] coming there he got ready i believe his
[1:30:56] name was elab he got ready for his honor
[1:30:58] god said that ain't him
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:04] he went down to almost all the suns and
[1:31:06] he got to a place he said he said jesse
[1:31:10] i know i got to say the lord
[1:31:13] but have you got any more sons
[1:31:16] in your house
[1:31:17] is there any more
[1:31:19] he said yeah we got one more
[1:31:21] all he do is just sing
[1:31:24] listen to the smoking word tapes
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:27] oh let me see
[1:31:29] he won't hardly get a job
[1:31:31] uh-oh he just stay in the house
[1:31:34] he said don't talk bad about it
[1:31:37] bragging
[1:31:38] and all of a sudden sam you stand there
[1:31:40] and david come in the house
[1:31:43] noah david come in the house he didn't
[1:31:44] come in all starts he'd come in oh
[1:31:46] praise god
[1:31:48] the lord is my shepherd
[1:31:50] i shall not vote
[1:31:53] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:31:55] shadow of death i feel no evil
[1:31:58] lift up your heads oh ye gates and let
[1:32:01] the kingdom of glory come in who is the
[1:32:04] king of glory david said a lord mighty
[1:32:06] in battle i kill a lion and i kill a
[1:32:09] bear lord all of a sudden god samuel got
[1:32:13] anointed saying he's all glory that's
[1:32:15] him that's him get the oil pulled up why
[1:32:17] that's god's chosen god sometimes you
[1:32:20] have to add crazy
[1:32:22] cases everything else but god knows god
[1:32:24] you got good sense why because you got a
[1:32:26] spiritual attitude toward the world
[1:32:30] spiritual attitude toward the word
[1:32:33] glory
[1:32:36] david was born at the right time
[1:32:40] after you become king
[1:32:43] glory
[1:32:44] god said before you can be the king
[1:32:46] i got to see
[1:32:49] lord
[1:32:50] and the church was in a war
[1:32:54] was fighting against the philistines
[1:32:57] he was fighting
[1:32:58] uh
[1:32:59] the philistines
[1:33:01] glory
[1:33:03] david when he was too young he's about
[1:33:04] 12 years old 13.
[1:33:07] his daddy used him to
[1:33:09] go and
[1:33:10] you know take your brothers from
[1:33:13] you know how to do i get on my grandson
[1:33:15] because they'd be beating up the little
[1:33:17] one
[1:33:19] i said when i was growing up i said now
[1:33:22] y'all gonna stop this the buck gonna
[1:33:23] stop here
[1:33:25] when we were i had one brother older
[1:33:27] than me he used to beat me up then i
[1:33:29] used to beat the one down on the
[1:33:30] mediocre
[1:33:32] and we just kept trickling on down
[1:33:35] so when he got there i saw my grandson
[1:33:37] beating up his little brother outside
[1:33:39] stop it
[1:33:40] we ain't uh we having this no more
[1:33:42] that's been in my family long enough
[1:33:46] my big brother used to beat me up i used
[1:33:48] to be done we doing that no more
[1:33:51] praise god
[1:33:53] you know
[1:33:54] and i told him i said now if they beat
[1:33:56] you up you let granddaddy know
[1:33:59] only if you do something
[1:34:01] you can get me up but we should do that
[1:34:02] all the time you say you don't think you
[1:34:04] take up some family traits you do
[1:34:07] what you need is the holy ghost to get
[1:34:09] rid of those things
[1:34:10] and sometimes we think they're right
[1:34:13] i had to tell me i just fussed all the
[1:34:16] time i said again i said your mama used
[1:34:18] to fuss all the time too
[1:34:21] what that got to do with it i said you
[1:34:22] need the holy ghost and he'll control
[1:34:24] that fussing
[1:34:26] [Applause]
[1:34:28] all right
[1:34:32] the lord i don't care if you're steve
[1:34:34] whatever you get the holy ghost he
[1:34:36] changed that
[1:34:38] god has the power to transform
[1:34:41] we have bad see sometimes people get
[1:34:43] their family spirits and they think it's
[1:34:45] the holy spirit
[1:34:47] but what you need to get is the holy
[1:34:49] spirit and then you'll know god's spirit
[1:34:52] from the family spirit all right
[1:34:57] and david and

[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:39] i'm going in the rapture
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:21:09] i want to read this this scripture as we
[2:21:12] are preparing for
[2:21:14] baptism this morning
[2:21:16] a man of our
[2:21:18] brother and our sister here this morning
[2:21:22] and as the scriptures as it said
[2:21:26] as peter begin to go through
[2:21:30] and under the inspiration of the holy
[2:21:32] spirit
[2:21:33] identifying
[2:21:35] what was prophecy
[2:21:37] has now been fulfilled
[2:21:41] and peter was not
[2:21:43] expressing it as a bystander
[2:21:47] or something that someone else had told
[2:21:49] him
[2:21:50] he had a personal experience and it was
[2:21:54] god speaking through him
[2:21:57] that's a difference
[2:22:00] that's why the prophet said that this
[2:22:02] message that we've received it is the
[2:22:04] flame of the hour but it must be the
[2:22:07] flame of our hearts
[2:22:10] it must be in us
[2:22:14] amen because the message is not a book
[2:22:16] or a tape
[2:22:18] the message
[2:22:20] is get under the blood
[2:22:23] the message is christ
[2:22:26] that's the real reality
[2:22:28] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:35] he said in verse 32 this jesus hath god
[2:22:37] raised up whereof we all
[2:22:40] are witnesses
[2:22:42] therefore being by the right hand of god
[2:22:44] exalted and having received of the
[2:22:46] father the promise of the holy ghost he
[2:22:49] hath shed forth this
[2:22:51] which ye
[2:22:53] now see and hear
[2:22:56] for david is not ascended into the
[2:22:58] heavens but he saith unto himself the
[2:23:00] lord said unto my lord sit down on my
[2:23:03] right hand until i make thy foes thy
[2:23:06] footstool
[2:23:08] therefore let all the house of israel
[2:23:10] know assuredly that god hath made the
[2:23:14] same jesus whom you crucified both lord
[2:23:17] and christ
[2:23:19] identifying prophecy has been fulfilled
[2:23:24] and the holy ghost was present
[2:23:28] delivering the word and here's the
[2:23:30] effect when they heard
[2:23:33] this
[2:23:37] they knew about it
[2:23:39] but when they heard this
[2:23:43] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:23:44] said unto peter and to the rest of the
[2:23:46] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[2:23:49] do
[2:23:50] maybe here gathered this morning i don't
[2:23:52] know maybe you maybe you've known about
[2:23:55] the message maybe you've known about god
[2:23:57] but it's not enough to know about god
[2:24:01] it's not good enough to be a religious
[2:24:02] person
[2:24:04] you want to know jesus christ
[2:24:07] in the power
[2:24:08] of the resurrection amen
[2:24:11] and what was spoken right here this
[2:24:13] morning
[2:24:14] was this same prophecy
[2:24:17] and the word of god that god promised in
[2:24:20] this generation that we're standing in
[2:24:24] many can point back to the cross but
[2:24:27] we're talking about what he did there
[2:24:29] he's the same lord jesus right here
[2:24:35] it's a living god that's right here
[2:24:37] among us
[2:24:38] and he comes right here among us to deal
[2:24:40] with the hearts of his children
[2:24:42] and when they heard this here became a
[2:24:45] question in their heart
[2:24:46] what must we
[2:24:48] do
[2:24:49] to be saved
[2:24:50] the word brought it it stirred something
[2:24:53] up in them
[2:24:54] and here was the answer
[2:24:57] repent
[2:25:00] repent
[2:25:02] amen conviction struck the heart you
[2:25:04] repent
[2:25:05] lord forgive me of my sins lord jesus
[2:25:09] forgive me lord i need a savior i need
[2:25:12] you not just a savior i need you lord
[2:25:15] the one who has spoke to me and pricked
[2:25:17] my heart the one who has went down and
[2:25:19] uncovered my life i need
[2:25:22] you because the same god who uncovers
[2:25:25] your life you know what he's uncovering
[2:25:27] he's uncovering every hindrance every
[2:25:29] sin everything that the devil tried to
[2:25:32] seal you in
[2:25:33] but he came comes down to break the
[2:25:36] seals
[2:25:38] begin to break away unbelief from off of
[2:25:40] your life
[2:25:42] and the same god who takes the cover
[2:25:44] everything that the enemy has come and
[2:25:46] tried to lay upon your life because he's
[2:25:48] nothing but a robber and a thief who has
[2:25:50] come to kill and destroy but jesus said
[2:25:54] i'm come that you might have life and
[2:25:56] have it more abundantly
[2:25:59] hallelujah
[2:26:00] [Music]
[2:26:02] that same god that can uncover just like
[2:26:04] as the holy spirit took it or that woman
[2:26:06] at the well that could uncover
[2:26:08] everything that was in her life you know
[2:26:09] what jesus was doing he was uncovering
[2:26:11] and lifting all the burdens and
[2:26:13] everything that the enemy had ever put
[2:26:15] upon her life
[2:26:17] but god's grace in that hour she
[2:26:19] received it
[2:26:20] that's right
[2:26:21] and the same god that uncovered now
[2:26:23] became in the life of rahab
[2:26:26] in the life of the woman at the well it
[2:26:29] became her covering
[2:26:30] it became her garment it became what she
[2:26:33] was adorned with
[2:26:35] [Music]
[2:26:37] jesus christ
[2:26:41] so if you've never repented
[2:26:43] that's the first place to start
[2:26:47] but i mean i've been raised in the
[2:26:48] message you still got to repent
[2:26:51] that's part of it
[2:26:52] [Music]
[2:26:53] that's that's the first step this is
[2:26:55] first base
[2:26:56] and
[2:26:58] this goes together
[2:26:59] be baptized every one of you in the name
[2:27:03] of jesus christ for the remission
[2:27:07] of sins
[2:27:08] you know what that is it's a cutting off
[2:27:14] when you repent every thing that you
[2:27:18] have done has already been cut off
[2:27:23] you don't have to look behind you and
[2:27:25] say are those sins still there
[2:27:28] when you repent it is for the remission
[2:27:31] of sins
[2:27:32] that means there's a freedom their past
[2:27:34] sins are cut off
[2:27:36] [Music]
[2:27:39] in this same verse is the remedy to give
[2:27:42] you the strength as the holy spirit was
[2:27:44] bringing it this morning that doesn't
[2:27:45] matter how what our status is how much
[2:27:47] we know about the word or anything but
[2:27:49] now coming in the another part of this
[2:27:51] verse is now the strength
[2:27:54] to where it's not just your past sin
[2:27:57] but no longer when there becomes a new
[2:27:59] creation by the holy ghost you're no
[2:28:01] longer tied to that of the past
[2:28:04] you've been tied into the true identity
[2:28:07] of jesus christ
[2:28:09] you'd have to worry about sin no longer
[2:28:13] it's gone
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:16] peter said repent and be baptized every
[2:28:18] one of you in the name of jesus christ
[2:28:20] for the remission of sins and you shall
[2:28:24] receive the gift
[2:28:26] of the holy ghost
[2:28:27] [Music]
[2:28:29] not a perhaps not a maybe
[2:28:31] it's a certain
[2:28:33] so even as you're walking in the water
[2:28:35] of baptism here this morning maybe
[2:28:37] there's somebody else but as you walk in
[2:28:39] the waters of baptism this water could
[2:28:42] have bypassed this church and went right
[2:28:44] next door to the neighbor and they could
[2:28:45] have taken a bath in this water
[2:28:47] this water does not save nobody
[2:28:50] this water will not clean your soul
[2:28:52] [Music]
[2:28:53] it's the word of god the blood of jesus
[2:28:56] christ that cleanses your soul
[2:29:00] but this right here is a grave
[2:29:03] it's a testimony
[2:29:06] you're going down in the waters in a
[2:29:08] grave as a testimony as a witness
[2:29:13] that i have repented and i am no longer
[2:29:16] the same person remember what the holy
[2:29:18] spirit said regarding winston churchill
[2:29:20] you've got an opportunity to change your
[2:29:22] mind and that's what repentance is it
[2:29:25] means there is a change of mind a turn
[2:29:27] of heart and you're looking at your life
[2:29:30] with a real abhorrence for that sin
[2:29:37] we go down in there
[2:29:38] myself and the brother the deacon
[2:29:41] we'll lay them down here in the water
[2:29:43] and we do that by our strength
[2:29:46] we bring them up
[2:29:48] that is a sign of a clear conscience
[2:29:50] towards god
[2:29:53] now let me tell you something the same
[2:29:55] one who pricks the heart who deals with
[2:29:57] the life is the same almighty god where
[2:30:00] no man can take you then the lord jesus
[2:30:02] himself steps on the scene
[2:30:04] and he baptizes you into the holy ghost
[2:30:08] [Applause]
[2:30:09] that same god is right here this morning
[2:30:13] he's the ever-present god
[2:30:18] hallelujah how many witnesses we got
[2:30:19] here
[2:30:21] witnesses of the power of the
[2:30:23] resurrection witnesses of the holy ghost
[2:30:27] i'm a witness
[2:30:29] that jesus christ is alive and well
[2:30:33] hallelujah
[2:30:35] what an awesome decision
[2:30:38] amen what an awesome decision to serve
[2:30:40] the lord
[2:30:42] hallelujah
