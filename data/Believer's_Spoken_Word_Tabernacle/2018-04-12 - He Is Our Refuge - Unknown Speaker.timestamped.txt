[25:35] [Music]
[25:51] [Music]
[26:06] [Music]
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] you're loving tonight it's certainly
[26:22] good to be in the house of the Lord
[26:24] tonight so good to be with each and
[26:27] every one of you to see everyone here
[26:29] tonight
[26:30] amen we want to look into the word into
[26:34] Psalms 142 if you'd like to turn there
[26:38] with me to save it just had a was a very
[26:44] rewarding time there with the the
[26:47] pastors and wives get away I'm tired I'm
[26:54] refreshed in my in my spirit but with I
[26:58] know brother Paul sister Rebekah as well
[27:00] or are tired as well and we have been at
[27:04] it there and just hosting all of the
[27:06] other pastors that had come in and we
[27:09] just just had such a wonderful time just
[27:12] a lot of rich things that were really
[27:14] spoken in and said and that the Lord
[27:19] really used to really encourage us and a
[27:22] lot of a lot of healing and
[27:24] strengthening that had taken place we
[27:26] have pastors from all over many from the
[27:29] other parts of Canada clear down from
[27:31] Florida and all over that that flew in
[27:33] with their wives to be there and it just
[27:36] was a real time of refreshing and so
[27:39] even though my what to me I would rather
[27:42] have right now my spirit refreshed than
[27:45] my body I can get my body refreshed so I
[27:49] know that all that will all come
[27:51] together so we just want to look to the
[27:53] word tonight and just what the Lord will
[27:56] have force you love you amen in a
[27:59] wonderful hour to be serving the Lord a
[28:01] man it's just a wonderful time you know
[28:03] when we sing that song there I stand
[28:06] redeemed we're not
[28:07] that song is sung in many many many
[28:10] places but for some they sing the song I
[28:14] stand redeemed but they only think of
[28:16] Redemption as a term of just forgiveness
[28:19] and redemption is much deeper than
[28:21] forgiveness
[28:22] because forgiveness you still did it you
[28:27] still did it
[28:27] but Redemption it brings you back to
[28:30] where you never did do it because the
[28:34] real you on the inside is not the one
[28:37] who did those things that's what real
[28:40] true redemption is God coming to claim
[28:43] what is his own amen and that wonderful
[28:48] Amen let's just as we have our Bibles
[28:51] open could we just pray just here for a
[28:53] moment and I just like to remember
[28:55] sister Shirley crescent prayer brother

[29:13] levels within her kidneys and they're

[29:20] feeling real well she's also she wasn't
[29:22] here with brother Dave Crest's on on
[29:25] Sunday and service and we just want to
[29:28] offer up just even a special prayer for
[29:30] our sister tonight that the Lord will
[29:32] just be merciful and just touch her in a
[29:34] real special way let's just go before
[29:37] the Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we

[29:42] and opportunity Lord to be able to come

[30:22] Lord we offer up Lord our sister Shirley
[30:26] offering up prayer for her tonight Lord
[30:28] you see the need that's there in her
[30:30] body and Lord we just pray tonight that
[30:33] you would just move
[30:35] upon her body and give her strength Lord
[30:38] Jesus I pray that God that you'll just
[30:40] take control of those levels Lord their

[30:46] Lord we're to take the stone Lord all
[30:49] we're doing Lord is giving ourselves
[30:51] Lord and and father to the sling Lord
[30:54] that you would direct the stone Lord to
[30:56] the giant's forehead Lord tonight Lord
[30:58] we ask it Lord for your glory and we
[31:01] just pray that you would guide us Lord
[31:03] in your word tonight Lord by your spirit
[31:06] father we pray in the name of the Lord
[31:08] Jesus Christ amen amen let's read here
[31:12] Psalms 142 of David it says I cried unto
[31:20] the Lord with my voice with my voice
[31:25] unto the Lord did I make my supplication
[31:29] I want you to take notice hear my
[31:33] supplication so the supplication of
[31:36] David is making his request known unto
[31:40] God what is what is the desire and he
[31:43] said I poured out my complaint before
[31:46] him now you and I in our in our thinking
[31:48] if I said you know brother joy poured
[31:50] out his complaint to me immediately in
[31:53] our thinking we would say well what's he
[31:55] complaining about that's not what this
[31:58] word complaint means here it means his
[32:01] meditation the things that's deep that's
[32:04] on his heart that's what he's been
[32:06] meditating about and so you say well God
[32:09] sees what I'm thinking about that's true
[32:12] God knows what's on our heart God knows
[32:14] even the troubles and the burdens of
[32:16] what you have on your heart or God knows
[32:17] all of those things but to think of it
[32:20] if you can come before him what an honor
[32:23] that is because you are letting him know
[32:25] you're the one who can help me you're
[32:30] the one who can help me that in itself
[32:32] is honor that's honor once you think of
[32:37] this I poured out my complaint before
[32:39] him I showed before him my trouble when
[32:44] my spirit was overwhelmed with
[32:47] then thou knewest my path in the way
[32:51] wherein I walked have they privately
[32:53] laid a snare for me I looked on my right
[32:57] hand and beheld but there was no man
[33:00] that would know me refuge failed me no
[33:04] man cared for my soul I cried unto thee
[33:09] O Lord I said thou art my refuge and my
[33:13] portion in the land of the living
[33:16] attend unto my cry for I am brought very
[33:19] low deliver me from my persecutors for
[33:22] they are stronger than I bring my soul
[33:26] out of prison that I may praise thy name
[33:31] the righteous shall compass me about for
[33:35] thou shalt deal bountifully with me amen
[33:40] may God bless his word as you're being
[33:43] seated tonight
[33:56] but look here in the word I want to just
[33:59] take a little thought here on that he is
[34:02] our refuge and when we considered this
[34:08] the Lord Jesus Christ being our refuge a
[34:12] place we see this in many in many
[34:16] different shadows through the scripture
[34:18] when we look at through the Old
[34:21] Testament that God had places that were
[34:24] reserved for his people that he would
[34:27] meet with them places that God even gave
[34:31] them on the other side of Jordan when
[34:35] they were preparing to to cross Jordan
[34:38] God gave them places of cities of refuge
[34:42] and then even after they crossed into
[34:45] the land there were certain cities that
[34:47] were not left to them but God designated
[34:51] these cities of refuge and they were
[34:53] places that they could go and and they
[34:56] when there were things that had taken
[34:58] place they were able to go there and not
[35:01] just when there were things that we
[35:04] could look at and say when one had you
[35:07] know the ax had come out of his hand and
[35:09] and against and smoke maybe a an
[35:12] individual and that individual died then
[35:15] they could they could flee to that that
[35:17] refuge and they would find safety there
[35:20] and they they were to abide there and
[35:22] they were safe within their because
[35:24] truly the desire that they had was not
[35:27] to slay that other individual so there
[35:30] was a refuge that was that was provided
[35:33] for them and you find that even in in
[35:36] our lives and in the journey of through
[35:39] the Word of God for God's purpose in our
[35:41] life there is one refuge and that is the
[35:45] Lord Jesus Christ we're in that as it
[35:48] says very clearly in the scriptures that
[35:50] in that day and that's that's this day
[35:53] since the offering up of Calvary and
[35:55] since the blood has been shed and now
[35:58] there's an entrance that we have into
[36:01] the very presence of God to actually
[36:03] come in to the very body of Jesus Christ
[36:08] we coming into that place of refuge it's
[36:11] a place of safety it's a place that
[36:14] everything that we have need of is there
[36:17] within him no matter what it is that you
[36:20] face or what you go through God's
[36:21] already provided everything that we have
[36:24] need of for you and I there's new
[36:26] circumstances there's new things that we
[36:28] come into that if we had known about it
[36:31] maybe at that time it would have taken
[36:33] us back but God knows exactly what and
[36:36] what it is and what we have need of as
[36:39] we come in to circumstances and
[36:41] situations in our life because you might
[36:44] and we have to remember that we belong
[36:46] to him and God knows exactly what he's
[36:49] doing in our life it's not us taking God
[36:52] and making God move according to our way
[36:55] but it's rather us submitted to him and
[36:58] God performing his word within our life
[37:01] and so even the pathways and even the
[37:05] tests and the trials that you and I
[37:06] would come to come through every one of
[37:09] those tests and trials as we've looked
[37:11] at those are not things that are just by
[37:14] chance or things that just happen but
[37:17] every one of them is uniquely directed
[37:21] and ordered by God because God knows
[37:24] what lays within each and every one of
[37:26] you he knows the potential that lay
[37:29] within each and every one of you and I
[37:30] want you to think of this what if an
[37:32] individual you know let's take for
[37:34] example maybe a medical student or
[37:36] someone you know maybe like a doctor you
[37:39] know they can read the books they can go
[37:41] through the tests they can mess with the
[37:42] dummies and do all the different things
[37:44] that are going on but there has to be a
[37:46] place to where that even as they're
[37:49] watching the other individuals in the
[37:51] room the doctors are speaking to them
[37:52] maybe the hand different things to them
[37:54] there has to come a place to where that
[37:57] they would have a confidence but in
[37:59] order to have that confidence in
[38:00] themselves there's got to be someone
[38:02] who's able to see beyond any of their
[38:05] nervousness their tenseness and be able
[38:07] to see that there is a potential there
[38:10] and the only thing that's needed is to
[38:13] be able to tap that potential and when
[38:15] one greater than them has tapped that
[38:17] potential it automatically begins to
[38:20] removal
[38:20] even that of the nervousness the
[38:22] anxiousness because they realize and
[38:25] they have to see this that someone who
[38:27] has already been down the paths of where
[38:30] I'm now starting has sees something in
[38:33] me that they're even able to place a
[38:35] confidence and say here do this and
[38:38] that's the same way that with God God
[38:40] knows what lays within every one of our
[38:43] lives as children of God as seeds of God
[38:46] everything that every Apple every leaf
[38:50] everything is within that germ that lays
[38:53] within that seed it's nothing now where
[38:56] there's being apples added to you or
[38:58] there's being leaves added to you and I
[39:00] but everything that is within us God
[39:03] already so that within that seed but it
[39:07] takes conditions it takes things in
[39:09] order to bring that out and as we're
[39:12] moving and we're walking in the Lord we
[39:14] find that truly he is an ever-present
[39:17] help in the time of trouble you might
[39:20] have found that scripture to be real
[39:22] when you're on your job you might have
[39:24] found that to be real when you're at
[39:26] home you might have found that to be
[39:28] real when you're driving on the road you
[39:30] say well I'm here I'm here but remember
[39:32] you're dwelling in Christ if you've been
[39:35] born of the Spirit of God you have the
[39:38] ever-present promise of the comforter
[39:42] that lo I am with you always
[39:44] whithersoever thou goest so God is
[39:47] watching over all of these places and
[39:50] the deployments that he has for our life
[39:53] sometimes you and I might want to go
[39:55] from here to here but yet God knows
[39:58] exactly what to win when to bring us
[40:02] into the place that he has for us
[40:03] because from here to here there can be
[40:06] many junctions along the way that is
[40:09] necessary to bring us into position so
[40:12] that when we get here we're able to move
[40:15] where God wants us to move and how he
[40:18] wants us to move so God has all of this
[40:21] it's already been planned out I'll tell
[40:24] you the truth tonight it's already your
[40:26] life in my life it's already been
[40:28] pre-planned and you look at and you say
[40:30] well brother send me how can you save
[40:32] that well it's really simple
[40:34] when we can just look at the word in
[40:36] Psalms 139 and David begin to think
[40:39] about the thoughts that God had toward
[40:41] him and David said you know they just
[40:43] did it just overwhelms me to think of
[40:45] them the sum of those and to recognize
[40:48] that now you and I can look in and say
[40:50] but what about all my mistakes what
[40:52] about all your mistakes you say well God
[40:54] you mean God pre-planned my mistakes
[40:56] no God did not pre plan as far as to
[41:00] make you and I make a mistake but the
[41:02] Bible does say that the them that are
[41:05] called according to his purpose all
[41:07] things work together not that all things
[41:10] are good but all things work together
[41:13] for our good so there's things that you
[41:16] and I are able to look at and to learn
[41:19] from and God will teach us the Spirit of
[41:21] God will teach us many things just like
[41:24] the Spirit of God taught Joshua when and
[41:27] when Moses sent 12 spies over Joshua was
[41:31] able to be taught and Joshua was able to
[41:33] look at it and he never thought of
[41:35] himself to be better than Moses it's
[41:37] just simply that the unction of the
[41:39] Spirit of God helped him to see that 12
[41:42] is too many just send 2 in so he was
[41:45] able to glean from that and see
[41:47] something within the life of someone
[41:49] else and I I really believe that with
[41:51] all my heart that we indeed are the body
[41:54] of Jesus Christ and as a body we need
[41:57] one another and what I mean by we need
[42:00] one another we need the Christ that is
[42:02] in one another to be expressed because
[42:05] it's things that God knows that you and
[42:08] I that what's needed there's little
[42:10] things that you know you can't do it all
[42:12] on your own
[42:13] I can't do it all on my own you might
[42:15] say well buddy I mean you're the pastor
[42:16] I'm not doing this all on my own it is
[42:19] you and I committed together unto the
[42:22] Lord and God knows exactly within each
[42:24] and every part there's certain things
[42:26] that you might be praying for an answer
[42:28] and you're praying and you're praying
[42:30] and it said I've got to open my Bible
[42:32] today and you're opening your Bible and
[42:34] my you're reading us and my what
[42:36] wonderful things I've read today and yet
[42:38] you feel like I still don't have the
[42:39] answer to what I'm going through and
[42:41] then maybe you put on a message in
[42:43] you're listening to a message and you
[42:44] say my is wonderful
[42:46] things but I just still feel like I
[42:48] don't have the answer you're not doing
[42:50] wrong by what you've done what it is is
[42:52] just expect because God knows what you
[42:55] have need of and it might be that there
[42:58] might be a testimony that's given it
[43:00] might be a song that God will speak to
[43:02] you through it might be another brother
[43:04] another sister let me tell you something
[43:07] in all things its Christ himself moving
[43:10] and declaring to you and I that we are
[43:12] not on an island isolated to ourselves
[43:14] but we are a body of believers and we
[43:18] need one another and it's Christ himself
[43:21] of how that he will speak through one
[43:24] another
[43:25] that's wonderful in it he not puts us in
[43:27] a place of expectation to where that
[43:30] even if we go we're going to a place
[43:32] they even have coffee with one another
[43:34] let's be expecting because you don't
[43:37] know what God is going to do even in
[43:39] that moment so I look at this he is our
[43:44] refuge on we know this and we understand
[43:46] that that Christ it's not it's not a
[43:49] doctrine he's a person Amen this this
[43:52] message that God has sent to you and I
[43:54] did not introduce to us I'll reintroduce
[43:58] if I can say it this way our Bible but
[44:01] it was the making known and the
[44:03] introducing to us of the very person of
[44:06] Jesus Christ and through that he raises
[44:09] up and makes this Bible real to you and
[44:12] I not just something that we can read
[44:15] and say wow that's good my that sounds
[44:17] good but we're reading it not from that
[44:19] angle but we're reading it and realized
[44:22] that this is our script you with me this
[44:27] is our script now you might look at this
[44:29] verse tonight or another verse and you
[44:32] might seem like well I don't
[44:41] you
[49:40] discharge of that blood that paid a
[49:43] ransom that through that the life could
[49:46] come forth that's the same thing in you
[49:48] and I when the tests and trials come our
[49:50] way there is a part in our life there's
[49:53] a dying there's a dying there is a there
[49:56] is a real true discharge of our own life
[50:01] it's a releasing of our life but as
[50:04] interesting as that fading away and
[50:06] releasing of our life it's where his
[50:08] life then comes to the forefront God
[50:12] knows all of this he has this completely
[50:15] in his hands so it changes prayer it
[50:19] changes everything so it doesn't just
[50:21] remove but to think of it of how that
[50:24] really been remember he told the the the
[50:28] young man remember the young man had
[50:29] that prayer book you know and he said he
[50:33] took the prayer book and he had been
[50:34] praying those prayers and and he took
[50:37] that prayer book and he threw it in the
[50:38] fire he said it don't work
[50:42] you remember that Christ revealing his
[50:44] own word brother Ram talks about it I
[50:46] think was one of his relatives and
[50:47] nephews are one of them brother Graham
[50:49] talks talks to him about he said will
[50:50] you pray wrong now what you think of
[50:54] this he didn't say you know what the
[50:56] problem was was that prayer book he said
[51:04] you pray wrong he's getting to the
[51:08] principle not so much of what's said but
[51:11] the principle behind it he says we do
[51:13] not pray to change God's mind we don't
[51:22] pray to change God's mind
[51:23] he said we pray that we might fit God's
[51:27] will so that that takes it down to where
[51:32] it whether that's a prayer this long a
[51:34] prayer this long it always comes down
[51:36] the I will be done in earth even as it
[51:42] is in heaven what is already wrote out
[51:44] for my life to be expressed Lord give me
[51:47] the grace that your will can be declared
[51:50] and made
[51:51] owned through my life so here the Bible
[51:55] tells us in the book of James it says
[51:57] take my brother and the prophets who
[52:00] have spoken in the name of the Lord for
[52:01] an example of suffering affliction and
[52:03] of patience behold we count them happy
[52:06] which endure you have heard of the
[52:08] patience of Job and have seen the end of
[52:10] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[52:12] and of a tender mercy is any among you
[52:16] skipping to verse 13 is any among you
[52:19] afflicted let him pray is any merry let
[52:28] him sing songs if he is afflicted let
[52:36] him pray you know there's a difference
[52:38] in how we pray when we feel we're on the
[52:40] mountaintop there's a difference
[52:44] whenever I mean when you everything just
[52:47] seems like my everything just your
[52:49] spirit everything's in order and maybe
[52:51] you're driving down the road a man is
[52:52] just a time that you know you're just
[52:55] able to pray just everything so easy but
[52:57] when there is affliction when there's
[52:59] things that comes our way our prayer is
[53:01] different and it's not that we're not
[53:04] sincere but our prayer changes and our
[53:07] prayer in the difference of that time is
[53:09] really as we're looking to the Lord
[53:11] we're seeking from God what we have need
[53:15] of now what you think of this as we said
[53:20] earlier we are a body of believers and
[53:22] there's a lot of things that times that
[53:25] maybe that you've go through and I go
[53:27] through there's times where you could
[53:29] come you could call me and say brother
[53:31] Samuel would you would you just pray for
[53:32] me I'm going through something we'd be
[53:34] glad to pray for you there's times that
[53:37] with things that you could go through
[53:39] and you could you know you could come to
[53:40] me and I could search brother I could
[53:42] search for words you know because I
[53:43] would want to try to help you to
[53:45] encourage you and sometimes you know
[53:47] when you look at it sometimes there's
[53:48] situations where you're in the middle
[53:50] that time and words fail you as a pastor
[53:54] I don't have a reserved rolodex of words
[53:56] then although this problem came up go to
[53:59] see 94 section 1 Part B and pull that
[54:01] word on death then we don't have that
[54:04] you might say this is the same situation
[54:06] that you had two weeks ago in your
[54:08] office it don't work that way
[54:10] God knows about the Scriptures tell us
[54:13] he knows his sheep by name that's deeper
[54:17] than on Bill joy Carmen Irma
[54:19] Carlos Richard we're not talking about
[54:21] name like that he knows your character
[54:24] your makeup your temperament he knows
[54:26] how to speak to you if you're a timid
[54:29] person he don't come and boom bullet
[54:32] boil it down he knows how to speak to
[54:34] you because what he's interested in is
[54:36] getting his word to you and helping you
[54:41] what humility by the mighty God that
[54:44] would come down and meet you and I that
[54:46] way I'll tell you that to me makes me
[54:48] want to go in the corner and just cry
[54:50] and rejoice a little bit and cry some
[54:52] more to think how he would come down
[54:54] that way but to think about it
[54:57] David said it right here in Psalms 142
[54:59] he said when I looked around me I found
[55:01] no man for a refuge there was no one
[55:04] that could care for my soul what David
[55:07] is recognizing there's there's people
[55:09] around him that love him ain't that
[55:11] wonderful to have people around you to
[55:13] love you it's wonderful to have big body
[55:16] of believers it's wonderful to have a
[55:17] husband a wife and children other it's
[55:19] wonderful to have those to have people
[55:21] around you that love you and care for
[55:23] you but there is times in our life that
[55:25] even the closest of people that we
[55:28] cannot find a refuge we cannot find a
[55:31] release within that you know there's
[55:33] times that yesterday maybe I could sit
[55:35] down with my wife and the Holy Spirit
[55:37] will say something right there that'll
[55:39] just help me and encourage me but you
[55:41] know there's other times then that you
[55:43] may not come in that way but in the
[55:45] midst of it in at all it's got to be the
[55:48] Lord and in many of those times when you
[55:51] find that oh my don't resort to anything
[55:54] else but please resort to prayer and say
[55:57] Lord you know what I'm going through you
[56:00] know what I'm feeling and what are you
[56:02] doing you're pouring out your complete
[56:05] before he them you said why would I want
[56:07] to part my complaint before him there is
[56:09] no greater honor that you can give the
[56:12] Lord
[56:13] Christ than to take your needs to him in
[56:15] prayer and say Lord I got need right
[56:17] here Lord I need strength right here I
[56:20] need a direction right here
[56:22] I need answer right here Lord I need to
[56:24] know what do you think about this Lord
[56:27] my spirit seems all shaken up but I need
[56:29] to know what you think you know what
[56:31] that is that's honoring him for who he
[56:34] really is
[56:35] the greatest honor that you could give
[56:37] me as your pastor say pray for me
[56:39] brother Samuel the greatest honor I
[56:41] could even give you is walk up to you
[56:43] and not only say God bless you but say
[56:45] brother joy will you pray for me this
[56:47] week hi there just something that I just
[56:49] need God's help I need his direction
[56:51] that's an honor you know why because
[56:53] what I'm saying is I believe that God
[56:56] will hear your prayer hallelujah he is
[57:02] our refuge when I turned I found no man
[57:07] I found no one to care for my soul but
[57:11] he I poured out my complaint before him
[57:15] when my spirit was overwhelmed within me
[57:18] then thou knewest my path hallelujah any
[57:25] afflicted among you let him pray but say
[57:28] now when I'm afflicted I I don't
[57:31] necessarily have maybe the greatest
[57:32] prayer say listen godson I'm worried
[57:34] about great prayers it would just be
[57:37] like if you came to me or one of my boys
[57:39] came to me and they asked me for
[57:40] something they don't say dear daddy my
[57:45] father you are such a wonderful daddy
[57:49] you you you know what their poor not
[57:52] dead
[57:53] dad I need help in here in the kitchen
[57:56] something just happened so they don't
[57:59] know there ain't no formalities like we
[58:00] got to read this much or say this or go
[58:03] through a doxology it's make contact
[58:05] with him you you got a need your need
[58:08] we'll bring Jesus on the scene just like
[58:11] that
[58:13] hallelujah because through those things
[58:15] he makes himself known to you personally
[58:18] that he cares for you hallelujah I look
[58:24] at this in the scripture I look at these
[58:26] these particular parts here as I as I
[58:29] look over this and I find within the
[58:32] church the early church of how that here
[58:35] God starts a work here the Ministry of
[58:39] the Resurrection that has a rose and
[58:41] after the Ministry of a resurrection
[58:43] remember it's pointing them to the
[58:45] oncoming promise he identifies himself
[58:48] among the elect of God that I am the
[58:51] promised Messiah redemption has come I
[58:54] am the promised Redeemer
[58:56] so he's opening their understanding to
[58:59] who he is and with that it also directs
[59:04] them into the promise of his coming when
[59:07] he will come in them on the day of
[59:09] Pentecost and so he's directing them in
[59:12] faith to this thing wanna what a great
[59:15] event and they approach it with such joy
[59:17] in their heart and to see how that God
[59:19] is getting ready think about this you
[59:22] think they're approaching it with joy as
[59:24] they return from the mount of all of
[59:26] that belief to Jerusalem they're going
[59:28] with joy God is going to meet them with
[59:32] joy because God has desire to get back
[59:35] inside of man and now through and by the
[59:38] provided way God is going to be able to
[59:41] move down inside of man but remember in
[59:44] this moving down inside of man it's God
[59:46] raising up his children by Redemption
[59:51] who it is that he foreknew and within
[59:54] that foreknowledge God knows each and
[59:57] every one of them God knew exactly where
[59:59] they would be God knew exactly where
[1:00:02] Philip would end up God knew exactly
[1:00:04] where Andrew would end up
[1:00:06] he knew exactly where Paul would end up
[1:00:08] God knew exactly where they would end up
[1:00:10] and God knows exactly where you and ass
[1:00:14] end up I'm not talking about heaven or
[1:00:20] hell when I'm talk about ending up I'm
[1:00:22] talking about God knows every part of
[1:00:25] the journey
[1:00:27] he knows every part of our life and that
[1:00:31] in the real truth about it is is that in
[1:00:34] the midst of it sometimes we get too
[1:00:38] comfortable and God knows exactly how to
[1:00:41] bring us out of that comfort within
[1:00:45] ourselves it doesn't remove us from the
[1:00:48] comfort in him it gets us out of our the
[1:00:51] comfort of our own selves but you got to
[1:00:54] remember God God is doing that because
[1:00:57] we're part of his program and want you
[1:01:01] to look here in the scriptures with me
[1:01:02] just for a few moments in Acts chapter 4
[1:01:06] verse 23 and when you look at this here
[1:01:11] in the scriptures it says and they being
[1:01:16] let go they went to their own company
[1:01:18] and reported all that the chief priests
[1:01:21] and elders had said unto them now this
[1:01:23] is Peter in John they've just they've
[1:01:27] just been preaching great miracle things
[1:01:31] have taken place and now here they've
[1:01:35] been brought before the chief priests
[1:01:37] and now they're on their way back to
[1:01:38] come around the rest of the disciples
[1:01:40] and when they heard that there's the
[1:01:43] rest of the of the believers when they
[1:01:45] heard that they lifted up their voice to
[1:01:47] God with one Accord and said Lord thou
[1:01:52] art God which has made heaven and earth
[1:01:54] and the sea and all that in them is now
[1:02:00] what I want I want you to watch now is
[1:02:01] how that they when this persecution came
[1:02:07] when they returned and spoke to the rest
[1:02:12] of the believers what had taken place
[1:02:14] the rest of the believers were moved
[1:02:17] together in one Accord and what they did
[1:02:20] was a very important thing they
[1:02:23] recognized that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:26] was their refuge and they said Lord thou
[1:02:31] art God you know what they did they took
[1:02:33] their
[1:02:35] situation the threatenings and all these
[1:02:38] things that are put around they took
[1:02:40] that and they said this is not above you
[1:02:43] this is beneath you Lord you already you
[1:02:47] created heaven and earth all of these
[1:02:50] things this is beneath you it's not
[1:02:52] above you it's not beyond you we place
[1:02:56] this beneath you you are in control Lord
[1:03:02] and watch how they look at this verse 25
[1:03:05] who by the mouth of thy servant David
[1:03:08] had said who Christ who God said by the
[1:03:14] mouth of his servant David see how God's
[1:03:17] quickening this word to them right now
[1:03:19] this is in this place of refuge why did
[1:03:24] the heathen rage and the people imagine
[1:03:25] being things they're not out of place
[1:03:28] they're not out of sorts it's not like
[1:03:30] what Oz what's one the world's going on
[1:03:32] this is perfectly identified in the word
[1:03:34] you see the word being identified where
[1:03:37] they're at it's given them peace the
[1:03:40] kings of the earth stood up and the
[1:03:42] rulers were gathered together against
[1:03:43] the Lord and against his Christ forever
[1:03:46] truth against the Holy Child Jesus whom
[1:03:48] thou hast anointed both herod pontius
[1:03:50] pilate with the gentiles and the people
[1:03:52] of israel were gathered together for it
[1:03:55] to do whatsoever thy hand and thy
[1:03:57] council determined before to be done oh
[1:04:00] my and now Lord behold their
[1:04:04] threatenings behold Lord their
[1:04:08] threatenings and grant watch out they
[1:04:12] what's what they say and grant unto thy
[1:04:14] servants that with all boldness they may
[1:04:18] speak thy word they take in the
[1:04:21] situation and what they're taking it and
[1:04:24] placing it there
[1:04:25] all of these threatenings not when it
[1:04:27] says Lord behold their threatenings I
[1:04:29] don't know I just happen to believe that
[1:04:31] they didn't have a prayer meeting of
[1:04:33] just rehearsing all the threatenings
[1:04:34] they just come ladies took it all
[1:04:36] together and said behold all their
[1:04:38] threatenings well or do you see this
[1:04:40] happening in my life you see this
[1:04:42] happening you see this happening now he
[1:04:43] knows all that and you can pour all that
[1:04:45] out but what I'm trying to say
[1:04:47] all of those things like that they took
[1:04:49] it all and said Lord behold all of this
[1:04:52] you see within it all it's not an it's
[1:04:54] not so much that we had a call
[1:04:56] everything out it's just that we're
[1:04:57] taking that situation and we're putting
[1:05:00] it before him and say Lord you're above
[1:05:03] this and grant to me Lord that the world
[1:05:05] what what is placed there inside of me
[1:05:08] but it will come forth in a greater
[1:05:10] boldness by stretching forth thy hand to
[1:05:16] heal and that signs and wonders may be
[1:05:18] done by the name of that Holy Child
[1:05:20] Jesus and when they had prayed the place
[1:05:23] was shaken where they were assembled
[1:05:25] together and they were all filled with
[1:05:28] the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word
[1:05:30] of God with boldness and the multitude
[1:05:34] it goes on it says the multitude of them
[1:05:36] that believed were of one heart and of
[1:05:39] one soul neither said any of them that
[1:05:43] that are of the things which he
[1:05:45] possessed was his own but they had all
[1:05:47] things in common and was great power
[1:05:50] gave the Apostles witness on the
[1:05:53] resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great
[1:05:56] grace was upon the night and we should
[1:05:59] deal with this scripture probably a lot
[1:06:00] but when you get to looking at this here
[1:06:02] this right here in that scripture how
[1:06:05] many events actually took place within
[1:06:08] that the Bible says with great power
[1:06:10] that that God the Apostles gave witness
[1:06:13] of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:14] you know right now he would be like here
[1:06:17] saying right here in this assembly and
[1:06:19] with great power gave the believers
[1:06:22] witness and believers spoken word
[1:06:24] Tabernacle of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:26] you a witness in your workplace you a
[1:06:28] witness in your home you a witness on
[1:06:30] the job you a witness it's cool you see
[1:06:33] what it is it's Christ witnessing out
[1:06:35] and thundering out his life through us
[1:06:40] because the reality of it is we're not
[1:06:43] here desiring our own glory we want to
[1:06:48] see him glorified
[1:06:51] neither was there any among them that
[1:06:54] lacked for as many as we're possessors
[1:06:57] of lands or houses sold them and brought
[1:07:00] the prices of the things that were sold
[1:07:02] and laid them down at the Apostles feet
[1:07:05] and distribution was made unto every man
[1:07:07] according as he had need and what you
[1:07:11] look at this what has taken place here
[1:07:14] but here they've the Lord is so directed
[1:07:18] them to go and to sell their things and
[1:07:21] begin to they brought everything
[1:07:23] together and they distributed according
[1:07:25] to everyone's need the Bible says they
[1:07:28] had all things in common and here they
[1:07:31] were they're still at Jerusalem they're
[1:07:33] still here they're still dwelling in
[1:07:35] this time the Spirit of God is moving
[1:07:38] among them even when this first test or
[1:07:41] trial comes up the Spirit of God it
[1:07:43] moves among them has risen in them and
[1:07:48] they recognize that that resurrection in
[1:07:50] them has positioned them in the City of
[1:07:55] Refuge and they recognize there's not a
[1:07:58] destroyer
[1:08:00] there's nobody can touch them that can
[1:08:03] take their life there's nothing can
[1:08:05] happen to them until God is finished
[1:08:08] with them but had to be a recognition
[1:08:10] that God is above the circumstances that
[1:08:14] I faced him hallelujah he is our refuge
[1:08:21] here they are they're here gathering at
[1:08:24] Jerusalem but God's got a need that this
[1:08:29] word has got to go forth it's true
[1:08:33] the Bible says beginning at Jerusalem
[1:08:36] but it didn't say beginning at Jerusalem
[1:08:39] and ending at Jerusalem and staying at
[1:08:43] Jerusalem it said beginning at Jerusalem
[1:08:47] there's a beginning to your life there's
[1:08:52] a beginning in your spiritual walk is
[1:08:56] that right
[1:08:56] there's got to be a start in Jesus
[1:08:59] Christ there's got to be a place of
[1:09:02] where that you can put your foot down in
[1:09:04] know and recognize that my life has been
[1:09:07] changed that Christ is alive in my heart
[1:09:11] and there's a beginning but from that
[1:09:14] beginning then Christ God's you and I
[1:09:17] along to bring out what he has in our
[1:09:19] life
[1:09:23] he wouldn't matter all the attributes of
[1:09:27] a father all the attributes of a mother
[1:09:29] that isn't a man relevant attributes of
[1:09:32] mothers not in the man matter what they
[1:09:33] think today let me clarify that the the
[1:09:38] attributes of a daddy of a husband are
[1:09:40] inside of man but you know there ain't
[1:09:42] nothing can bring that out except his
[1:09:46] mate its spouse you know there's
[1:09:52] attributes that within a to be a mother
[1:09:54] to be a wife but those attributes can't
[1:09:57] express themselves just when she's by
[1:09:59] herself there has got to be things that
[1:10:03] happen to release those attributes and
[1:10:08] God knows the attributes all the parts
[1:10:12] of our life and how that there are
[1:10:14] things that must transpire all of these
[1:10:18] things in order to release that you see
[1:10:22] when we can look at it in that way by
[1:10:24] God's grace then our focus it shifts
[1:10:27] from the trial to him see when they were
[1:10:33] praying you see what prayer will do
[1:10:37] prayer will actually shift you when
[1:10:40] you're praying for God's will it'll
[1:10:42] shift you from focusing on just the
[1:10:48] trial and it'll shift it to what's his
[1:10:51] will because prayer is a is a divine
[1:10:58] communication that's given for you and I
[1:11:01] of a part for us to stay in contact with
[1:11:04] God there's a lot of things that as I
[1:11:07] said you could talk with me you can talk
[1:11:08] with one another and there are all times
[1:11:10] there's times for that but friends I'm
[1:11:12] Italian no matter what you're going
[1:11:13] through even if you get an answer you
[1:11:15] come and you talk to
[1:11:17] or text me or one or more and you would
[1:11:18] get an answer that God would give you
[1:11:20] through me that does not negate nor do
[1:11:22] away with prayer there's got to be
[1:11:25] before you I would suggest before you
[1:11:27] even call or before you even come I
[1:11:29] would suggest that you be in prayer and
[1:11:32] then even after the answer comes take it
[1:11:35] and be in prayer because sure is enough
[1:11:41] as you go rejoicing that I've got the
[1:11:43] answer the devil also he is intimidated
[1:11:47] by your reception of that word and
[1:11:50] because Satan is intimidated
[1:11:53] he'll try somewhere along the line to
[1:11:55] try to trip you up but remember you run
[1:11:58] like a faithful messenger that you've
[1:12:00] got a message from God God has spoke
[1:12:03] personally to you and you can take that
[1:12:05] to the Lord in prayer and I'll tell you
[1:12:08] this right here as you get before God in
[1:12:10] prayer those things that are taking
[1:12:12] place in secret the Lord God will reveal
[1:12:15] it openly what is that that is that
[1:12:19] third pole Christ in you what is it
[1:12:23] secret now coming forth persecution
[1:12:35] arose the Bible says let me just read a
[1:12:38] few verses here acts 8 chapter 1 and
[1:12:41] Saul was consenting unto his death the
[1:12:45] most even and at that time there was a
[1:12:48] great persecution against the church
[1:12:49] which was at Jerusalem now what you
[1:12:51] notice he notice what the scripture said
[1:12:53] at that time there's times aren't there
[1:12:58] there's times of trials or times of
[1:13:00] things there's times at that time there
[1:13:05] was a great persecution God knows all of
[1:13:09] this is being divinely orchestrated by
[1:13:12] God this isn't like God planting you and
[1:13:16] then God said somehow I hope there's not
[1:13:19] deal force winds I hope it's not so bad
[1:13:22] that it'll snap them tomato plants and
[1:13:25] snap them God I'm worried
[1:13:28] because the strength is in the roots god
[1:13:32] is not worried you and I can feel those
[1:13:37] things but our refuge is here it's him I
[1:13:48] mean to think of it what would it be
[1:13:51] like if I got sugar in my house and then
[1:13:54] my boys won't take the sugar from my
[1:13:55] house they got to go somebody else's
[1:13:56] house I got sugar in my house you need
[1:14:00] sugar there's sugar there you don't got
[1:14:02] to go anywhere else
[1:14:04] he is the place of refuge you need
[1:14:08] healing healings there you need strength
[1:14:11] strength is here you need to live it's
[1:14:14] deliverance is here I'm not talking
[1:14:16] about in so much in this building I'm
[1:14:19] talking about in Christ and Christ in
[1:14:22] you there lays everything that you have
[1:14:26] need of glory we're not talking about
[1:14:33] going up to Jerusalem to worship there's
[1:14:35] been a transfer it's no longer going to
[1:14:40] Jerusalem to worship but drawed has made
[1:14:44] from Christ being the place of worship
[1:14:47] now that the promise has been poured out
[1:14:50] you are his place of worship Christ in
[1:14:54] you the hope of glory it's in Christ
[1:15:00] that we are dwelling that's the great
[1:15:02] mystery at that day you shall know that
[1:15:05] I'm and the father the father and me I
[1:15:09] and you you and me dwelling in our
[1:15:14] refuge the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:17] he's dwelling in us and they were all
[1:15:23] scattered abroad throughout the regions
[1:15:25] of Judea and Samaria except the apostles
[1:15:31] so God knew who to scatter all right now
[1:15:39] I don't it doesn't say that there
[1:15:41] weren't things that they didn't say him
[1:15:42] mom
[1:15:43] why don't we all gotta split up man we
[1:15:46] got a communal thing going here let's
[1:15:48] just build one big apartment building
[1:15:50] and you all have one B he'll have to be
[1:15:53] he'll have three C God didn't want a
[1:15:55] communal gospel he didn't want a
[1:15:58] communist come on somebody the gospel is
[1:16:03] to go out to reach his children and it's
[1:16:09] Christ in you and me that packs the
[1:16:12] message so here the Bible goes on to say
[1:16:18] in verse 3 as for Saul he made havoc of
[1:16:23] the church what I thought this was your
[1:16:27] church is this the same church where
[1:16:32] great power was upon the apostles and
[1:16:35] great mighty miracles and works were
[1:16:38] been done it was if this is God's church
[1:16:42] how could he louse all to make havoc of
[1:16:45] it he's not the author of confusion he
[1:16:52] knows just exactly what he's doing
[1:16:55] entering into every house hauling men
[1:16:57] and women committed them to prison
[1:16:59] therefore they that were scattered
[1:17:02] abroad went everywhere preaching the
[1:17:05] word no doubt about it that they may had
[1:17:10] to get over the place of leaving
[1:17:12] Jerusalem but when I look at the Bible
[1:17:14] it doesn't give a lot of very lot of
[1:17:16] space between verse 3 and verse 4 listen
[1:17:21] friends you know what it comes down to
[1:17:22] it comes down to us trusting the Lord
[1:17:26] when things don't make sense
[1:17:29] and that happens a whole lot we have to
[1:17:32] trust him because he does have our life
[1:17:36] in his hands there's some times where
[1:17:40] there's things that will happen and I'm
[1:17:42] not talking about because you know we've
[1:17:45] done something where maybe you said
[1:17:47] something on a in a certain shift and
[1:17:49] you got angry with somebody and you said
[1:17:51] bless God they're persecuting me no no
[1:17:54] you get moved to another apartment is
[1:17:56] God letting you know that he's not going
[1:17:58] to tolerate that behavior you don't care
[1:18:00] if you are his children but there are
[1:18:05] times when there's things that happens
[1:18:06] and God will move from this place to
[1:18:09] that place there's a purpose that's
[1:18:11] greater than what you and I can
[1:18:13] understand what should I do in that
[1:18:15] moment preach the word and say I'm a
[1:18:18] sister preach the word live it through
[1:18:21] your life sometimes you know the
[1:18:24] preaching of the word is not the
[1:18:26] preaching of all of the well you know
[1:18:29] sitting down and I'm gonna you know go
[1:18:31] through the Godhead with someone
[1:18:33] sometimes they need to see the Godhead
[1:18:35] reflected in flesh it's the revealing of
[1:18:42] Christ moving in our lives in these
[1:18:46] situations it's not about our knowledge
[1:18:49] if they win by knowledge they were not a
[1:18:53] went forth preaching the word if they
[1:18:55] would have went by their reasonings that
[1:18:57] when they went forth preaching the word
[1:19:00] but they were scattered and you see God
[1:19:03] knew God knew what he had placed in him
[1:19:06] he knew that within that seat it's just
[1:19:09] like in though in many things there is
[1:19:12] sometimes even when a message and
[1:19:15] different things that sent you know
[1:19:17] there's things that are points within
[1:19:19] that message that they can tell exactly
[1:19:21] where you were at certain little parts
[1:19:24] you were at this place at this
[1:19:26] particular time or more there's certain
[1:19:28] little things that can be encoded in
[1:19:30] there and that's why they go into all
[1:19:31] this stuff to encryption you know God's
[1:19:35] words encrypted God's words encrypt that
[1:19:41] it's been hidden in here the no amount
[1:19:43] of spies can get it out but all the Holy
[1:19:47] Spirit can reveal it and he reveals the
[1:19:50] encryption to those who are encrypted
[1:19:56] let's go what's happening everything
[1:19:58] else be it's a direct message see God
[1:20:03] knows what lays within each and every
[1:20:06] one of our lives and how that even this
[1:20:09] the one man remember the man that would
[1:20:11] tell brother Branham concerning the
[1:20:13] greatest mistake that they made in the
[1:20:15] early church was to sell everything they
[1:20:17] had
[1:20:18] he said they sold their homes everything
[1:20:20] he said they didn't have nothing to go
[1:20:21] back to you brother brems says the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost would make a mistake
[1:20:25] he said I think you're wrong I want you
[1:20:28] to look at this this man's looking at it
[1:20:31] through just an earthly reasoning but
[1:20:34] what the Prophet is applying here is the
[1:20:37] program and the pattern of God that God
[1:20:40] there is a need to scatter that dust why
[1:20:43] won't you think about this if this had
[1:20:46] not happened Baker has still been
[1:20:50] preaching the gospel in Jerusalem it
[1:20:53] would have never got to you and I you
[1:20:57] said we'll send you it would have found
[1:20:59] me but notice it's not just about the
[1:21:03] gospel finding you it's about being in
[1:21:06] the place that God has for you you could
[1:21:12] have been in Africa you're gonna bet in
[1:21:14] Spain you could have been in Peru and
[1:21:16] received the word but God knows exactly
[1:21:19] where you and I are intended to be and
[1:21:23] it's not up to us that tells God I'm
[1:21:26] gonna be here
[1:21:27] you bring the word here but God directs
[1:21:30] us for what purpose not just not just
[1:21:36] hearing the word it's for the expression
[1:21:40] of the word in our lives sometimes God
[1:21:49] has things to where we can become too
[1:21:51] common with things we can become very
[1:21:55] common with with hearing the word you
[1:21:57] can become common with me I can become
[1:21:58] common with you that's a dangerous thing
[1:22:01] it's something that we have to pray
[1:22:03] about we can't take it lightly because
[1:22:05] we understand we're we're all human but
[1:22:08] it's to be in prayer and say lord I've
[1:22:10] got to go beyond that veil I don't
[1:22:12] want to get I don't want to be looking
[1:22:14] or resting on the veil I want to look to
[1:22:16] you find how that that God completely
[1:22:22] directed prevent says God scattered the
[1:22:25] gospel by it by that persecution let me
[1:22:32] close over the Bible goes in another
[1:22:35] place on this persecution how they were
[1:22:38] scattered it says in another place that
[1:22:41] has this gospel was scattered it comes
[1:22:45] into a place to where that you find Paul
[1:22:48] and Silas here they are in Philippi
[1:22:50] right here they are walking around
[1:22:52] remember Paul had to have the woman that
[1:22:55] was going behind him deeds men or mighty
[1:22:57] men of God and one or more and God had a
[1:22:59] walking billboard advertising his
[1:23:01] servant these are mighty men of God
[1:23:04] finally the Holy Spirit gave Paul
[1:23:08] permission to turn around and call and
[1:23:12] cast that demon spirit out of her and
[1:23:16] when he did that I want you to think
[1:23:18] about it what a Liberty it was for that
[1:23:20] into that individual it doesn't go on to
[1:23:21] say whatever took place with her but
[1:23:24] what that did was it calls them
[1:23:27] authorities to be roused up and Paul got
[1:23:32] put down there in that Philippi in jail
[1:23:34] is that right Lord why in the world I'm
[1:23:38] not down here I just came here to preach
[1:23:41] the gospel I just helped her out that
[1:23:44] was bound but you see that event look
[1:23:48] how all these things are working
[1:23:49] together it's not isolated events from
[1:23:53] that moment the authorities raise up
[1:23:55] arrest Paul and Paul at that time you
[1:23:58] know from reading in other places in the
[1:24:00] book of Acts there's times where Paul
[1:24:02] was led by the Spirit of God to pull out
[1:24:04] his citizenship card is that right
[1:24:06] like somebody was getting ready to you
[1:24:08] my passport says I'm an American citizen
[1:24:11] but in this time Paul didn't pull out
[1:24:14] the passport but say man why didn't he
[1:24:17] do that if he had done that he'd have
[1:24:20] never been down there with the
[1:24:21] Philippian jailer
[1:24:25] I thought prayer changes things
[1:24:28] it does Paul was down in that Philippi
[1:24:31] in jail but the Bible says about
[1:24:33] midnight or the Joey I can't help but
[1:24:37] think it I don't think necessarily them
[1:24:39] bills those wounds and things were still
[1:24:41] running they might have started getting
[1:24:43] scabbed up and think about some of the
[1:24:45] fabric that was getting caught in there
[1:24:46] and you know how but they begin to pray
[1:24:50] and sing sister Carmen they were praying
[1:24:53] a little bit then they would sing a
[1:24:55] little bit then they'd pray a little bit
[1:24:57] and sing a little bit well in that out
[1:24:59] of water that ain't out of order that's
[1:25:00] called wash up
[1:25:02] they prayed a little bit sing a little
[1:25:05] bit
[1:25:05] remember they prayed a little bit
[1:25:06] something keeps holding me and they sung
[1:25:08] assenting then they went right back into
[1:25:09] prayer then they they were worshipping
[1:25:13] God in the midst of the circumstance
[1:25:19] that that jail they could see those
[1:25:22] walls just they could feel those chains
[1:25:24] but what it was they made him their
[1:25:28] refuge when there was no man that I
[1:25:32] could turn to Christ is my refuge
[1:25:37] Ferrell area when it look like there was
[1:25:40] no off they begin to sing and praise
[1:25:42] because you know why they knew oh I'm
[1:25:45] with he always men knew he was present
[1:25:49] and they declared to him you're my
[1:25:51] refuge and about that time an earthquake
[1:25:55] took place God opened the doors and they
[1:26:00] walked out you see in any of these
[1:26:04] situations that we look at the trial
[1:26:06] itself was not their focus listen these
[1:26:13] were not supermen and superwomen it was
[1:26:16] not the Acts of the Apostles it was the
[1:26:18] acts of the Holy Ghost in the Apostles
[1:26:22] and just exactly where God wanted Paul
[1:26:25] to be do you realize that Paul when God
[1:26:28] got ahold of his life he Paul didn't
[1:26:30] know that he was going to be in a
[1:26:32] Philippi in jail Paul didn't even know
[1:26:34] that time he'd be in a ship Paul II know
[1:26:37] those things
[1:26:38] God knew all of that but God knew that
[1:26:40] each one of those times it was a moment
[1:26:44] that another part of his life would be
[1:26:47] expressed right exactly where Paul was
[1:26:51] that said I've told you to be a light
[1:26:54] unto the Gentiles and let me remind you
[1:26:56] you are the light of the world you are
[1:27:00] city that's set on the hill
[1:27:02] God knows exactly where you're at he
[1:27:04] knows exactly where he's placing you and
[1:27:06] I and when things sometimes come up
[1:27:08] quickly quickly say Lord you know where
[1:27:12] I'm at you know how I feel right now
[1:27:14] Lord but Lord God you calmed the seas
[1:27:17] the Lord I'm asking you direct my way
[1:27:20] Lord help me
[1:27:21] here's this a moment Lord that I'm to go
[1:27:23] from Judea to Caesarea is this a time
[1:27:26] that I'm to make a journey from Judea to
[1:27:29] Caesarea is this a Time Lord that I'm to
[1:27:31] move from this part of the world into
[1:27:33] this part of the world
[1:27:34] is this a Time Lord that I'm the goal
[1:27:36] and preach the gospel just living this
[1:27:39] expression right here before the rest in
[1:27:41] this trial Lord you know you know and he
[1:27:47] does know he is our refuge let's bow our
[1:27:53] heads
[1:27:55] Lord Jesus throughout Lord this building
[1:28:00] tonight
[1:28:01] within each heart Lord we find Lord God
[1:28:05] that truly we have all been in these
[1:28:10] places perhaps tonight Lord but father
[1:28:14] we receive this direction Lord from you
[1:28:19] then Lord in these times when the church
[1:28:24] the Bible says that Herod would stretch
[1:28:28] forth his hand to vex certain of the
[1:28:30] church and he vets James and he vexed
[1:28:35] Peter it was certain ones that got
[1:28:37] picked out to vex
[1:28:40] and Lord to see how that the enemy Lord
[1:28:43] will at times and we know that he can't
[1:28:46] do anything without being given
[1:28:47] permission sometimes he can pick certain
[1:28:50] ones out Lord to vex but I pray Lord God
[1:28:55] may they look at it this way because
[1:28:57] every one of us can look at James and
[1:28:59] look at Peter and see how that you even
[1:29:02] in previous chapters would even testify
[1:29:04] concerning James in his life his
[1:29:06] character but to think what a great
[1:29:11] compliment that is Lord your prophet
[1:29:17] told us that when you permit a test or
[1:29:20] trial to come our way it shows you got
[1:29:21] confidence in that confidence Lord it's
[1:29:24] it's not our flesh that confidence is in
[1:29:27] that attribute that you have redeemed
[1:29:30] and raised up that's the real us this
[1:29:33] flesh this is not that flesh it's not
[1:29:35] the real me that's not me the real me is
[1:29:40] that man down on the inside the real one
[1:29:45] Lord is that that real daughter of God
[1:29:47] on the inside that longs Lord for you
[1:29:51] that loves desires you Lord to where
[1:29:54] that you are a living reality Lord unto
[1:30:00] them
[1:30:02] to where that Lord you've made yourself
[1:30:05] known and they can see Lord themselves
[1:30:09] more than you you're continuing to
[1:30:11] unfold this mystery in our lives and
[1:30:17] Lord it's through the unfolding of this
[1:30:22] mystery it is truly the mystery of God
[1:30:24] that's being unfolded in our lives
[1:30:27] they're not just trials these are not
[1:30:30] just trials there are deigned
[1:30:33] appointments for the expressions of
[1:30:36] God's mystery to come forth it comes
[1:30:40] forth under pressure
[1:30:43] the one nation of God it declares itself
[1:30:47] and prayer is that place of submission
[1:30:51] where it brings us into submission to
[1:30:53] the will of God to say thy will be done
[1:30:57] or how many times we could say it
[1:31:00] there's been many Lord that have been in
[1:31:03] dangerous situations but you know where
[1:31:07] you have led them just like when Paul
[1:31:09] would go down in the midst of Philip I
[1:31:12] when Paul and then when venture in
[1:31:14] certain places
[1:31:17] Lord God it would truly the safest
[1:31:21] places in Christ he is Lord you are our
[1:31:24] place of safety and your will unfolded
[1:31:27] for our lives when we are walking in
[1:31:29] your will for our lives we're in we're
[1:31:32] walking Lord in safety it doesn't matter
[1:31:35] what all is around us though the enemy
[1:31:40] rules
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:43] it's sought to consume my flesh yay he
[1:31:48] stumbled and fell for the Lord he shall
[1:31:52] set me upon a rock in the secret of his
[1:31:56] Tabernacle he the Lord Jesus is my
[1:32:02] refuge nor what I pray tonight may you
[1:32:08] just in taking your word that you've
[1:32:11] spoke to our hearts may you just comfort
[1:32:14] your children tonight the Lord when the
[1:32:17] situation's that they might be facing
[1:32:22] things that even Lord within on coming
[1:32:25] days Lord even though we we enjoy being
[1:32:32] able to talk to one another we want to
