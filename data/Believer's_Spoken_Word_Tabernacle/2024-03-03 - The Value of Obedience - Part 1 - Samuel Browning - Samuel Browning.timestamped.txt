[59:43] youth activities this evening okay so uh
[59:47] the young people know what we're talking
[59:49] about there um let's just go into the
[59:53] word of the Lord this morning
[59:55] uh many announcements that were there
[59:57] but uh we we'll try to keep up on that
[1:00:00] and but I want to go to Ruth chapter 4 I
[1:00:03] mean chapter one want to say to brother
[1:00:05] Trevor and sister Rea God bless you it's
[1:00:07] good to see you amen amen so good to be
[1:00:10] in the house of the Lord I tell you we
[1:00:12] had a um just um a wonderful time and uh
[1:00:17] sister Angeline right sister Angeline's
[1:00:20] here God bless you Sister angelene I I
[1:00:22] seen it last week but you know my mind
[1:00:24] as the service gets going but we had
[1:00:26] just a wonderful time with the um the
[1:00:28] young people there we always do
[1:00:30] and uh they they make it very easy and
[1:00:34] when you get into a subject and we
[1:00:36] started we started covering a subject on
[1:00:38] Friday night there I just felt led of
[1:00:40] the Lord to start into it and uh I told
[1:00:42] him I said you might actually hear this
[1:00:45] in a service I'm not going to preach it
[1:00:47] today but uh friendship and making
[1:00:49] friends and showing it through the
[1:00:51] scriptures and and how that we approach
[1:00:53] that and overcome come even all of our
[1:00:56] uh Parts in our lives because sometimes
[1:00:59] people say well I'm an introvert or I'm
[1:01:00] an extrovert and I'm a and we we I
[1:01:03] believe God gives us leadership and and
[1:01:05] helps us to overcome in those areas
[1:01:07] because every every area sometimes we
[1:01:09] can look and say well this is a weakness
[1:01:11] well but there's also a strength to it
[1:01:13] as well and the areas that sometimes
[1:01:15] like I said with the extroverts yeah
[1:01:17] it's a strength but it can also be a
[1:01:18] weakness they can get themselves
[1:01:20] entangled in things that they
[1:01:22] shouldn't boy should we just preach on
[1:01:24] this
[1:01:24] [Laughter]
[1:01:26] but uh you know I just made the approach
[1:01:28] them I said everything we do uh you know
[1:01:31] we want to look at it and say is it
[1:01:32] Godly and friendship is
[1:01:35] Godly amen I think throughout the
[1:01:37] Scriptures it says Abraham the friend of
[1:01:40] God
[1:01:42] Amen Ruth chapter 1 you probably ready
[1:01:45] to be seated here in a
[1:01:47] moment amen God bless you I know some of
[1:01:49] you have to to do that maybe we could
[1:01:51] just read a couple scriptures then we'll
[1:01:52] just finish reading the rest as you
[1:01:54] being seated in verse
[1:01:56] 14 and they lifted up their voice and
[1:01:59] wept again and orpa kissed her
[1:02:03] mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her
[1:02:07] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[1:02:09] the words you're being seated and we'll
[1:02:11] just continue to
[1:02:13] read I want you to notice in these parts
[1:02:16] of it but Ruth clave unto her and she
[1:02:19] said
[1:02:21] behold thy sister-in-law is gone back
[1:02:24] unto her people and unto her Gods return
[1:02:28] Thou after thy
[1:02:31] sister-in-law now
[1:02:33] remember Naomi and her husband IMC had
[1:02:37] uh left out of the uh land of Israel
[1:02:41] times had got rough and hard and they
[1:02:44] left and remember we see it
[1:02:46] scripturally throughout and the prophet
[1:02:49] would be quick to point this out to us
[1:02:51] from Abraham to wherever is that anytime
[1:02:54] we leave the promised land of God we're
[1:02:58] out of position and so Satan's desire is
[1:03:02] always to try to draw us and get us out
[1:03:05] of position from where the blessings of
[1:03:08] God are even where God would work and as
[1:03:11] we looked that a little bit last week
[1:03:13] where God will work and deal with your
[1:03:15] life you want to stay in that place
[1:03:17] where God is working and dealing with
[1:03:19] your life and let me just say this to
[1:03:21] you one sure sign that God is working
[1:03:24] and dealing with your life is all hell
[1:03:28] will be against you Devils will be
[1:03:30] against you demons will be against you
[1:03:32] all of these say everything will be
[1:03:35] turned loose but remember that's just
[1:03:37] like that airplane when it comes to that
[1:03:40] point it's got to break through that
[1:03:42] barrier so when opposition comes it's no
[1:03:46] sign it's time to turn back opposition
[1:03:49] is always there to challenge us when we
[1:03:52] come to obtain a promise of God that's
[1:03:56] so I want you just to take this and I it
[1:03:58] may go a little bit I don't know we'll
[1:04:00] see how we go here this morning but
[1:04:02] remember that their Naomi's husband had
[1:04:05] passed away and you know God has a way
[1:04:07] of getting everyone and getting his
[1:04:09] people in position you know I was
[1:04:12] marveling here as I was just praying the
[1:04:14] other day and just meditating and of how
[1:04:17] that sometimes you know when as we speak
[1:04:20] about that you know as a person in a
[1:04:22] life would come to serve the Lord and we
[1:04:24] know that it has to be the love of God
[1:04:26] that would actually begin to stir that
[1:04:29] heart and that is true and yet as the
[1:04:32] prophet would say within that he says we
[1:04:34] could not even seek after God unless God
[1:04:37] had turned our nature God had actually
[1:04:40] begin to draw upon us we couldn't even
[1:04:42] seek after him so it's all God working
[1:04:45] to turn our hearts in that way and then
[1:04:48] even when you think concerning different
[1:04:50] uh times like this uh like with Emil
[1:04:54] what if EMC Naomi's husband had not
[1:04:56] passed away probably would have still
[1:04:59] remained there but you see God knows God
[1:05:01] knows just how many feathers to take out
[1:05:04] of the nest to get us back into the
[1:05:06] where we need to be sir because let me
[1:05:09] just tell you the Bible is very clear he
[1:05:11] is mindful we are but flesh that there
[1:05:14] is a battle with this flesh leading up
[1:05:17] to the Holy Ghost and then he equips you
[1:05:20] with the Holy Ghost to subdue it and
[1:05:23] battle a against it but there's always a
[1:05:26] battle around and I look at gyrus the
[1:05:30] prophet called him a secret believer but
[1:05:33] God allowed a situation that forced him
[1:05:36] out to make a decision now you could
[1:05:39] call and say well if he really loved God
[1:05:41] if he was really one of his but see God
[1:05:44] knows that the situation will not
[1:05:46] overwhelm the seed that's there but God
[1:05:49] allows the conditions to come about that
[1:05:53] a decision might be
[1:05:55] made brother B also said it yes
[1:05:57] yesterday morning as I was going through
[1:05:59] it remember in uh with Garnet Peak and
[1:06:01] this is out of the I'm the resurrection
[1:06:03] and life in in the latter part of 63 and
[1:06:06] remember Garnet Peak was an 18-year-old
[1:06:08] boy and uh remember he had dealt with
[1:06:11] polio and all of those things and uh you
[1:06:13] know brother brandham you know had asked
[1:06:15] uh Garnet he said Garnet if you could be
[1:06:18] out here on the street you know and
[1:06:19] driving a hot rod and all these other
[1:06:21] things and run around with friends and
[1:06:23] he said Gar he said would would would
[1:06:25] you rather do that or be where you're at
[1:06:27] right now in Christ and Garnet said I
[1:06:30] would rather be exactly where I'm at
[1:06:32] right now in Christ and brother BR said
[1:06:36] it like this Garnet had objectives to be
[1:06:39] a tobacco Auctioneer he said and no
[1:06:43] doubt he would have went that way but
[1:06:45] that's not what God had for him and he
[1:06:49] said what it was polio came and God took
[1:06:53] po polio to Drive Garnet to him so
[1:06:57] sometimes situations that we are looking
[1:07:00] at and can I just say it this way
[1:07:03] sometimes situations that maybe we're
[1:07:05] trying to pray our loved ones out of be
[1:07:07] careful you're not praying them out of
[1:07:10] when you've already been praying God get
[1:07:13] a hold of their life Lord take the
[1:07:15] feathers out of their nest Lord turn
[1:07:17] this situation around now you might say
[1:07:19] as a husband or wife will say I don't
[1:07:21] want to live with a grizzly bear I do
[1:07:24] that already enough I I don't want any
[1:07:26] other problems but remember it's
[1:07:28] focusing on that Soul that's what really
[1:07:31] matters and God knows how to bring the
[1:07:34] conditions to where that everything
[1:07:36] around that will fade away or as the
[1:07:39] prophet could say rot around that seed
[1:07:43] that seed must rot and die that rotting
[1:07:46] is to its own ideas to its own ways to
[1:07:49] its own thinking to everything of self
[1:07:52] it's dying to
[1:07:55] self let me just tell you this there's
[1:07:58] nothing can bring that outside of the
[1:08:00] message of the
[1:08:02] hour because the message of the hour is
[1:08:05] the inspiration of God it's the Waters
[1:08:07] of God that's been released in this hour
[1:08:10] or as the prophet could even call it the
[1:08:12] mercies of God in his richness that
[1:08:15] actually will bring conviction to your
[1:08:18] life and let you know where you're at
[1:08:20] and where you need to be and it brings a
[1:08:22] moment where you can rock to your own
[1:08:27] ideas because outside of this word
[1:08:30] outside when we're talking of the
[1:08:31] message of the hour we're talking of the
[1:08:34] revealing of Jesus Christ what he it's a
[1:08:38] covering a covering it only covers over
[1:08:42] what's really
[1:08:44] needed and I'm glad that the blood of
[1:08:46] Jesus Christ in its covering it deals
[1:08:49] with the sin
[1:08:51] question it deals with the real problem
[1:08:54] on the
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:08:56] inside and it's prevailing
[1:09:00] power now want you to notice this my how
[1:09:04] did we get
[1:09:07] here but I want you to notice this here
[1:09:11] amik passes away Naomi's
[1:09:14] husband and they begin to hear that
[1:09:17] there is bread back in
[1:09:21] Israel you see God knows exactly when to
[1:09:24] drop that word when they look like all
[1:09:25] hope is gone and God says there's bread
[1:09:29] bread is the staff of Life staff of life
[1:09:33] it had meaning to her you know what it
[1:09:35] meant is that there is provision there
[1:09:38] is Bountiful provision in
[1:09:42] Israel and
[1:09:45] here orus husband dies Ruth's husband
[1:09:49] dies and then here they're all going to
[1:09:51] go back into Israel
[1:09:54] and I want you to notice the Bible has
[1:09:56] it words at here in the opening
[1:09:57] scripture of verse 14 it says but Ruth
[1:10:00] clave unto
[1:10:02] her Ruth was already cleaving to Naomi
[1:10:06] there was a connection between her and
[1:10:10] Naomi I want you to understand me a
[1:10:12] moment it was a connection that was
[1:10:14] deeper than just a daughter-in-law and a
[1:10:17] mother-in-law yes sir that is of a great
[1:10:20] value but it was a deeper spiritual
[1:10:22] connection you say well what does that
[1:10:25] mean because you can have a strong
[1:10:26] familiar or family connection and it can
[1:10:30] lead you out of the will of God that's
[1:10:32] why you've got to make sure that your
[1:10:34] absolute is not mother father or anybody
[1:10:37] else you've got to have an absolute
[1:10:39] yourself and that absolute is Jesus
[1:10:42] Christ his
[1:10:43] word not Mama's word not Grandma's word
[1:10:46] not Grandpa's word you've got to have a
[1:10:48] word there's a word from God for your
[1:10:52] life it's got to be personal in your
[1:10:56] life because listen to me every devil
[1:10:59] out of hell is against you when you
[1:11:01] start making a step for the kingdom of
[1:11:03] God and Satan will not stop at anything
[1:11:07] to try to pull you aside or lead you
[1:11:11] aside you say brother Samuel can I
[1:11:14] actually have an absolute without that
[1:11:16] absolute coming inside of me at first
[1:11:18] you've got to have an absolute that
[1:11:20] you're looking for and when you look to
[1:11:22] that absolute that this is the truth
[1:11:24] this is who he is it will lead you to
[1:11:27] the absolute experience in your life
[1:11:30] that'll anchor
[1:11:31] you the scripture said when they found
[1:11:34] that pearl of great price they sold
[1:11:37] everything to obtain
[1:11:39] it Ruth clave unto
[1:11:42] her there was something spiritual going
[1:11:45] on let me just tell you something
[1:11:47] there's things spiritual going on that
[1:11:49] you may not even realize it God moves
[1:11:52] beyond the depths of our carnal mind
[1:11:55] sometimes we're so busy trying to filter
[1:11:57] everything through our mind and the
[1:11:59] spirit of God the supernatural it'll
[1:12:01] bass it it'll move right through that
[1:12:03] and right down on the inside and you
[1:12:05] know what that's showing it's showing
[1:12:07] you that the real you is not your mind
[1:12:10] up here but the real you is that down on
[1:12:13] the inside that is
[1:12:16] drawing on
[1:12:18] God oh hallelujah
[1:12:22] hallelujah
[1:12:26] but here is't it incredible just the
[1:12:30] next verse Brianna if you don't mind the
[1:12:32] next
[1:12:34] verse here thy sister-in-law orpa just
[1:12:38] and all it took was just a little word
[1:12:40] to or for to orpa you guys you go on
[1:12:43] back I don't have no more Sons see
[1:12:45] there's a law of
[1:12:46] redemption in order of redemption to
[1:12:49] raise up seed unto thy name and she
[1:12:52] tells them are you going to wait till I
[1:12:54] get old I'd be too old to get married
[1:12:57] have children again so you know what
[1:13:00] when that's said every little bit of a
[1:13:03] hope is gone from orpa it didn't take
[1:13:07] much for orpa to say if there's no hope
[1:13:10] for me I'm out of
[1:13:12] here she kissed her mother-in-law on the
[1:13:16] cheek but Ruth though she could not see
[1:13:20] here and though what she was hearing
[1:13:23] sounded hopeless there was a greater
[1:13:26] connection on the
[1:13:29] inside there was something on the inside
[1:13:31] that begin to respond when the spirit
[1:13:34] said yes this said yes the spirit said
[1:13:38] yes this said yes is that right the
[1:13:41] prophet said the atmosphere falls in the
[1:13:43] meeting and begins to say yes Lord thy
[1:13:46] promises are true and the Soul says yes
[1:13:49] Lord yes Lord what are you doing
[1:13:52] stepping into the the water this is your
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:14:02] promises she turned and went
[1:14:05] back let's read what Ruth said in verse
[1:14:09] 16 Ruth
[1:14:13] said after it was said go on go ahead
[1:14:16] and go after your sister-in-law I don't
[1:14:17] blame you I don't blame
[1:14:20] you brother Samuel that's discouraging
[1:14:23] Hey listen the syop phenician woman when
[1:14:26] she came to the Lord Jesus she was there
[1:14:29] and she said uh thou son of David have
[1:14:33] mercy on me and he said it's not meat to
[1:14:38] take the the bread for the children and
[1:14:41] cast it to
[1:14:43] dogs the prophet said Jesus himself
[1:14:46] tried his best to discourage her you say
[1:14:51] why would Jesus do that because she
[1:14:53] knows the need in her life and the word
[1:14:56] itself cannot deny the
[1:15:00] word it rose up a humility out of her
[1:15:03] heart and she said true Lord but the
[1:15:06] dogs eat the crumbs from the master's
[1:15:10] table you know what she said you're not
[1:15:12] running me off you're not getting me off
[1:15:15] your hands I know what you've got I know
[1:15:17] what you have I know what I need in my
[1:15:20] home I know what I need in my marriage I
[1:15:23] know what I need in my life you're not
[1:15:25] running me
[1:15:29] off I tell you that's a seed that's a
[1:15:32] seed on the inside that's pressing its
[1:15:35] way above the muck and the G and all the
[1:15:38] junk that's packed in
[1:15:46] it and Ruth said entreat me not to leave
[1:15:52] thee entreat me not to leave thee or to
[1:15:55] return from following after thee in
[1:15:59] other words no more words about me
[1:16:02] leaving because they're going to fall on
[1:16:04] deaf
[1:16:05] ears I don't know the word Retreat sorry
[1:16:09] I only
[1:16:10] know go forward that's all I know go
[1:16:15] [Applause]
[1:16:16] forward but you're a moabitas I'm
[1:16:20] going what promise do you have I'm going
[1:16:29] if she wanted she could have had a lot
[1:16:31] of excuses of why to turn
[1:16:35] around or if I had some
[1:16:37] excuses so she
[1:16:39] thought now watch this for whether thou
[1:16:43] goest I will
[1:16:47] go Lord show me every step of the way no
[1:16:51] where you go I'm going
[1:16:55] where he leads me I will
[1:17:00] follow glory and where thou
[1:17:03] lodgest I will
[1:17:06] Lodge wherever your presence sets down
[1:17:10] and begins to work in my life that's
[1:17:12] where I'm going to sit down and I am
[1:17:14] going to eat myself into a body change I
[1:17:18] am going to eat myself to where I see my
[1:17:22] enemies under my feet I am going to eat
[1:17:25] myself to a place where I can see the
[1:17:28] things that once bothered me no longer
[1:17:31] bother me where thou lodgest where you
[1:17:35] rest I'll rest where the pillar of fire
[1:17:39] sets down that's that's where I'll
[1:17:40] settle
[1:17:42] down thy people shall be my people and
[1:17:48] thy God my
[1:17:51] God verse 17
[1:17:53] where thou dest will I
[1:17:57] die and there will I be
[1:18:00] buried the Lord do so to me and more
[1:18:03] also if ought but death part thee and
[1:18:10] Meen what a
[1:18:13] determination and think of this of a
[1:18:15] determination of an individual that
[1:18:19] doesn't even have a promise like you
[1:18:22] have before you this morning that's
[1:18:24] already been written in the word
[1:18:27] examples all through the word that no
[1:18:29] matter what a life could say you don't
[1:18:31] know where my life is at you don't know
[1:18:33] how shattered it is you don't know how
[1:18:36] it doesn't matter there there's
[1:18:37] countless promises and examples as well
[1:18:40] as all through this Congregation of
[1:18:42] witnesses of what the Redeeming Grace of
[1:18:46] God has done and will do there is no
[1:18:49] circumstance there's no sin there's no
[1:18:52] condition
[1:18:53] there's nothing too great for my Jesus
[1:18:57] nothing is too great for him he's a
[1:19:00] mighty
[1:19:02] conqueror Hallelujah he's not there's no
[1:19:05] habit too
[1:19:06] great there's nothing of this world too
[1:19:10] great there's no pull for the things of
[1:19:13] the world too great that my Jesus is not
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:20] greater Verse 18
[1:19:23] when she saw when Naomi saw that she was
[1:19:28] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[1:19:31] she left speaking unto her amen
[1:19:35] so when discouragements and things
[1:19:38] listen as the word is coming the word
[1:19:41] comes to our life remember the word is
[1:19:44] come to lead Sons and Daughters to
[1:19:48] Liberty it's not come to lead the carnal
[1:19:51] mind it's not come to lead the flesh
[1:19:53] it's not come uh to somehow you know
[1:19:55] reform us no it's come to lead out Sons
[1:19:58] and Daughters of God so God like that in
[1:20:01] Egypt God allows the situations and
[1:20:04] conditions to get so bad to where the
[1:20:07] Fulfillment of the word that God
[1:20:09] originally spoke to Moses let my son go
[1:20:13] that he may serve me God will break down
[1:20:16] every hold every condition it doesn't
[1:20:19] matter what it is where the enemy feels
[1:20:21] like he's got a hold is nothing too
[1:20:24] great that he will not come down and
[1:20:27] break the hold over every son and every
[1:20:29] daughter of
[1:20:34] God yes
[1:20:36] sir y'all believe this right if you
[1:20:39] don't I do I'm a witness of this this is
[1:20:42] not a pipe dream this is a
[1:20:44] reality this is a reality I I did not
[1:20:46] come here to this morning of just some
[1:20:48] sort of a thought and what it could be
[1:20:50] as a matter of fact just to let you know
[1:20:52] I sat right back there to moments before
[1:20:55] I had walked out of here with two
[1:20:56] outlines in front of me where do I go
[1:20:58] this
[1:21:06] morning think of this now she came to a
[1:21:09] place of a
[1:21:10] decision sometimes when we look at with
[1:21:13] decisions remember the prophet was
[1:21:15] talking about how that when a decision
[1:21:17] is made he said it's like stones that
[1:21:19] come that then are to be cut and hued
[1:21:22] out for the service of the master and it
[1:21:25] takes the word to actually begin to
[1:21:27] shape that stone and work that stone
[1:21:29] because remember we are regarded as
[1:21:31] Lively stones that are to be fitted and
[1:21:34] divinely placed in the temple of the
[1:21:37] Living God every one of us have our own
[1:21:39] part peculiarities differences even the
[1:21:42] diversity of gifts even within our
[1:21:44] temperament and our makeup but yet every
[1:21:47] one of us to be a part of the body of
[1:21:49] Jesus Christ God knows all of that and
[1:21:51] where the spirit of God God comes down
[1:21:53] in the very midst of our life the
[1:21:55] prophet said he sets right in the midst
[1:21:57] and the middle of our temperament he
[1:21:59] takes away that old first nature that
[1:22:01] carnal nature that was enmity to God and
[1:22:04] he sets down of his divine nature and
[1:22:07] now it begins to move through the
[1:22:09] temperament in our life and give us
[1:22:11] Grace to overcome
[1:22:14] daily now the decision that's made think
[1:22:18] about a decision itself you know when we
[1:22:21] think about decision you know you can't
[1:22:23] set neutral you've got to make decisions
[1:22:26] you all the way through right here all
[1:22:28] through these verses I just read n Ruth
[1:22:31] had to make decision after decision you
[1:22:35] said brother samel she already made one
[1:22:37] decision but remember the word kept
[1:22:39] coming to her but she held the decision
[1:22:43] to the end I'm not going back don't try
[1:22:46] to stop me don't try to hinder me and
[1:22:48] there is nothing the Lord do any ought
[1:22:51] to me if there is anything anything but
[1:22:53] death that would separate
[1:22:55] us a decision and you know how important
[1:22:57] a decision is yes
[1:22:59] sir it'd be like you invite somebody
[1:23:02] over for dinner and they say we'll think
[1:23:03] about
[1:23:13] it you'd sit there and look at him and
[1:23:15] say well must have other stuff to do
[1:23:18] maybe you know maybe there's other
[1:23:19] things they got to think they got to
[1:23:21] consult their consult their wife they
[1:23:22] got to look for other
[1:23:24] things but you know when a decision to
[1:23:27] be made it's something that's to be made
[1:23:31] at that moment and it
[1:23:33] declares what you intend to do the
[1:23:37] prophet tells us in marriage of the Lamb
[1:23:40] that when when we make decisions we show
[1:23:43] our faith in
[1:23:46] God yes sir and let me just tell you how
[1:23:51] could those decisions be made unless God
[1:23:54] comes and energizes our faith that's
[1:23:57] right that's so good that's what that's
[1:24:00] that's why when as he's moving Among Us
[1:24:02] he's here to energize our faith right
[1:24:04] now watch this here what was the Holy
[1:24:07] Ghost given for let me just let me read
[1:24:09] this here to you Naomi tried to get Ruth
[1:24:12] to go back but she said your people are
[1:24:14] my people your God is my God and where
[1:24:17] you die there I'll die where you're
[1:24:20] buried there I'll be buried and I'll not
[1:24:22] turn back that's when a person has
[1:24:26] caught a vision don't make any
[1:24:29] difference what her people said you're
[1:24:31] going over there to become a Holy Roller
[1:24:34] or something that don't make any
[1:24:36] difference to Ruth there was a purpose
[1:24:38] of God to be fulfilled let me tell you
[1:24:41] something if there's anybody that
[1:24:43] Whispers in your ear and says well
[1:24:45] you'll be a fanatic look at their
[1:24:48] life I said look at their life do you
[1:24:51] want to be like them no
[1:24:54] I because usually the people that says
[1:24:57] you're going to be a fanatic they're
[1:24:59] trying to hold you
[1:25:02] back let me tell you something when you
[1:25:05] really serve God and you get out of your
[1:25:07] own mind you'll be considered a fanatic
[1:25:10] you'll be considered like Paul said a
[1:25:12] fool for Christ but whose fool are
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] [Applause]
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:20] you got all this regular lers going on
[1:25:24] and yet some of you would march to high
[1:25:26] heaven with all the regulations the
[1:25:28] government wants to put on oh bless God
[1:25:31] we're going to March the EPA we quit
[1:25:33] trying to put regulations on the Holy
[1:25:39] Ghost qu trying to regulate what he can
[1:25:41] do in your
[1:25:43] life Hallelujah let me just tell you
[1:25:45] something he's a
[1:25:47] gentleman he don't need us helping him
[1:25:50] out and how to control it let me just
[1:25:51] tell you something there's a lot of
[1:25:53] Fanatics in hell and they're for the
[1:25:55] wrong thing there's religious Fanatics
[1:25:58] in
[1:26:01] Hell business Fanatics hell's a real
[1:26:04] place everybody that leaves here does
[1:26:07] not go to heaven sorry preachers don't
[1:26:10] put you in
[1:26:11] heaven like I stood there and said
[1:26:14] yesterday we've stood in a lot of
[1:26:15] funerals and we've heard a lot of lies
[1:26:17] preachers don't put you in
[1:26:20] heaven there's only one mediator between
[1:26:23] God and man and that's the man Christ
[1:26:26] Jesus you got to make up your mind that
[1:26:29] you're either going to serve God or
[1:26:32] not like Joshua said if serving the lord
[1:26:35] seems evil to you you know what the word
[1:26:38] evil means well I would never regard
[1:26:40] evil if it refers to
[1:26:44] Grievous it's Grievous what he's asking
[1:26:47] me to
[1:26:49] do if it seems evil to you you choose
[1:26:53] this day
[1:26:55] that's nobody else if you let somebody
[1:26:58] else influence you look at their life oh
[1:27:01] brother Samuel they've been around the
[1:27:02] message for 50 years but if they have
[1:27:04] not moved one iota you have got the
[1:27:08] wrong
[1:27:10] example let me tell you something there
[1:27:12] is a flying eagle in our midst Jesus
[1:27:16] Christ the holy ghost that comes down
[1:27:19] and liberates lives changes lives and
[1:27:22] sets Hearts on Fire that's what he does
[1:27:26] he
[1:27:28] specializes in Taking
[1:27:31] Lives and making Saints out of
[1:27:34] them and then just so you understand a
[1:27:37] saint is not somebody who's perfect in
[1:27:40] themselves a saint is a Sanctified one
[1:27:44] been set aside by the spirit of God and
[1:27:46] filled with God's spirit and is a living
[1:27:49] Memorial of Jesus Christ
[1:27:53] Hallelujah that's so good yes
[1:27:58] sir that's a person that's caught a
[1:28:02] vision don't make any difference what
[1:28:04] her people said you're going over there
[1:28:05] to become a Holy Roller or something
[1:28:07] that didn't make any difference to Ruth
[1:28:10] there was a purpose of God to be
[1:28:15] fulfilled you know even like the prophet
[1:28:17] I I love to me I love the sovereignty of
[1:28:19] God when you study the God's sovereignty
[1:28:22] I love how the message just unfolds that
[1:28:24] cuz it's right there all the way through
[1:28:25] the
[1:28:26] scriptures of how the brother B say here
[1:28:28] he was he said you don't even know why
[1:28:30] but you staggered into that little
[1:28:32] mission that night and you made your way
[1:28:34] to the altar didn't really know all that
[1:28:36] was going on he said but there was your
[1:28:39] beginning some of you had your beginning
[1:28:41] in a charismatic church some of you had
[1:28:43] your beginning in a Catholic Church
[1:28:45] Catholic Church yeah because it was
[1:28:47] Jesus Christ that caught your
[1:28:50] attention but the the problem of it was
[1:28:52] is you got you got a catch of him and
[1:28:55] you said I ain't lodging here cuz he's
[1:28:57] moved
[1:28:58] on I'm going to go on where he's at and
[1:29:00] you didn't even know where to go you
[1:29:02] didn't know where to go but he knew
[1:29:04] where you were at and like that boy that
[1:29:06] he healed their eyes he came and found
[1:29:09] you and led you to
[1:29:13] himself I tell you you make a decision
[1:29:16] as God moves on your heart don't let
[1:29:18] listen to me the moment that God begins
[1:29:20] to deal with your heart there also a
[1:29:22] spirit of fear that'll want to creep up
[1:29:25] around you what are you going to do
[1:29:27] what's going to happen to you you might
[1:29:28] act this way your friends might say this
[1:29:31] that is a spirit of fear as a barrier
[1:29:35] that's wanting to hold you back from
[1:29:37] obedience to the voice of God but if you
[1:29:40] will pass through that barrier press
[1:29:42] through that barrier you will find the
[1:29:43] goodness and glory of God that will lead
[1:29:46] you
[1:29:47] on
[1:29:50] am
[1:29:53] H my my and just as sure as you're
[1:29:58] hungering same quote just as sure as
[1:30:00] you're hungering tonight for the holy
[1:30:03] spirit it's something in you pulling you
[1:30:07] that a purpose of God in your life has
[1:30:11] got to be
[1:30:12] fulfilled just like it was with
[1:30:15] Ruth so it wasn't a natural thing it
[1:30:19] wasn't Ruth that got caught up
[1:30:22] with ar rest she did not catch oers o i
[1:30:27] name bringing my mind just tired oers o
[1:30:30] I don't want to say
[1:30:31] Oprah orpa dear Lord no I don't want to
[1:30:34] Blas in the house of God orpa but you
[1:30:38] know she didn't catch or a spirit you
[1:30:40] got to be careful you don't want to
[1:30:41] catch one another's Spirit that's right
[1:30:44] are you hearing me it's important that
[1:30:47] you recognize God speaking to you don't
[1:30:49] look at what your neighbor is doing
[1:30:51] don't don't even look at what your wife
[1:30:53] is doing or your husband's doing God
[1:30:55] speaking personally to
[1:30:57] you there will be no excuses in hell if
[1:31:01] you say well my wife didn't go or my
[1:31:03] husband didn't go God will hold you
[1:31:05] accountable every man must give an
[1:31:08] account of his own soul he rise or falls
[1:31:10] to his own
[1:31:11] [Applause]
[1:31:13] Master but there's a pulsation on the
[1:31:16] inside and let me just tell you God
[1:31:17] won't push you and God won't pull you
[1:31:20] that's right it didn't say blessed is
[1:31:21] who years yields to my pooling blessed
[1:31:24] is he who who who who uh who who helps
[1:31:26] who allows me to push him that is not
[1:31:29] overcoming overcoming begins with a
[1:31:31] decision amen it's every day in our
[1:31:36] life come on friends even those of us
[1:31:38] that have already crossed over in the
[1:31:40] land you've got decisions to
[1:31:42] make when God's dealing with your life
[1:31:45] on things there's decisions to
[1:31:48] make oh brother Samuel it's just a small
[1:31:50] little baby those little baby amorites
[1:31:52] grow up to be like their daddies they
[1:31:54] got the same nature in them and the
[1:31:56] little things in your life you don't
[1:31:58] kill will eventually rise up and take
[1:32:01] away your
[1:32:04] faith that's how important it is that's
[1:32:07] why Israel got caught and they stumbled
[1:32:09] they allowed things to become common and
[1:32:11] they got the coup in at babies oh how
[1:32:14] cute it is oh it's innocent go baby
[1:32:16] looks innocent let it grow up it got the
[1:32:19] same DNA as his
[1:32:20] daddy right that's why you got to look
[1:32:23] at little things I don't care if it's
[1:32:24] sin and of this world it might be a
[1:32:26] little baby thing a little thing that
[1:32:28] you think oh that ain't harmless
[1:32:29] standing harmless let me tell you one
[1:32:31] little harmless thing will lead to
[1:32:32] another harmless thing lead to another
[1:32:34] harmless thing lead to another harmless
[1:32:36] thing it'll keep going until it
[1:32:37] overtakes you and takes the joy of the
[1:32:39] Lord out of your life don't ever get to
[1:32:42] thinking you're too big for God's grace
[1:32:44] to come down and humble you and walk in
[1:32:47] humility to the grace of God
[1:32:50] Hall
[1:33:00] don't worry I'm just trying to catch my
[1:33:05] breath how can I
[1:33:09] overcome brother BR says what are you
[1:33:11] struggling
[1:33:12] for so you can live what are you living
[1:33:15] for so you can die wouldn't it be most
[1:33:19] foolish if we didn't accept God's
[1:33:21] provision for eternal life what could we
[1:33:24] think about what could be on our mind
[1:33:27] that would attract our attention to
[1:33:29] anything what if you owned a100
[1:33:32] million and you own the state of Indiana
[1:33:36] or any other state or even a nation as
[1:33:40] far as that concerned the entire world
[1:33:43] you live long enough you've got to come
[1:33:46] to that
[1:33:47] too and constantly day by day every time
[1:33:51] your heart beats you're going right
[1:33:53] straight to
[1:33:55] that you there's no winning for you
[1:33:59] you're on the losing side and you've got
[1:34:02] to lose but remember the promise he
[1:34:06] that'll lose his
[1:34:09] life amen for my
[1:34:13] sake you know life is a precious thing
[1:34:16] yes yes am you can waste it spend it or
[1:34:23] invested your
[1:34:25] choice your choice that's why the
[1:34:27] prophet could say in choosing of the
[1:34:28] Bride choice is a great
[1:34:32] thing a great thing so our choices we
[1:34:35] can't blame our decisions on nobody
[1:34:38] else right we can't well I you know I I
[1:34:41] walked I tell you what the reason I
[1:34:42] walked off I tell you we wouldn't be in
[1:34:44] the condition if I hadn't have had to
[1:34:45] walk off that job because of that boss
[1:34:47] don't blame it on that boss God could
[1:34:49] have been using that situation to temper
[1:34:51] you amen and you have to realize you
[1:34:53] need to stop running from your problems
[1:34:56] and recognize that your problem stares
[1:34:58] you in the
[1:35:00] mirror come on friends this is where
[1:35:02] let's just get right down to it a lot of
[1:35:04] times what it is we're so busy so
[1:35:06] interested in play blaming all of our
[1:35:08] shortcomings on everybody else well I
[1:35:10] got a bad attitude because of this no
[1:35:12] you got a bad attitude because you chose
[1:35:13] to have one amen well brother Samuel
[1:35:15] I've got a grudge because of this no you
[1:35:17] got a grudge because you chose to have
[1:35:19] one you have a choice is whether to not
[1:35:22] you're going to entertain the love of
[1:35:24] God and when you really get the love of
[1:35:26] God in your life and you have the love
[1:35:28] of God if something comes up it will be
[1:35:30] Lord I need more of your love because I
[1:35:33] don't want this in my life it's not of
[1:35:37] you and it will take my soul to
[1:35:40] hell you can have a justly ought against
[1:35:43] somebody but if you don't release that
[1:35:45] from your heart scripture Jesus said
[1:35:48] when you pray and you ask the father to
[1:35:50] forgive you if you haven't forgiven
[1:35:52] it'll be held against
[1:35:54] you that's exactly what he said I don't
[1:35:58] know about you but I want
[1:36:00] freedom I want freedom oh brother Samuel
[1:36:02] does that mean that there's not things
[1:36:03] that oh yeah sure there's plenty of
[1:36:04] things that come around my way but you
[1:36:07] know I don't sit here and evaluate what
[1:36:08] comes my way and put it on evaluate what
[1:36:10] comes around you we don't sit around and
[1:36:12] compare who's been offended the most
[1:36:14] because we've all frankly offended other
[1:36:16] people whether we know it or
[1:36:18] not Lord have mercy
[1:36:23] come on friends if we'll really look and
[1:36:26] consider some of the choices and
[1:36:28] decisions we have made in life there
[1:36:32] were no more about God than nothing we
[1:36:35] didn't seek God we didn't ask God we
[1:36:37] didn't ask for his leading didn't ask
[1:36:39] for his guidance we've made him brother
[1:36:42] Samuel you're talking to believers do
[1:36:44] you think Believers can't make wrong
[1:36:47] decisions I'm sure right here there's
[1:36:49] some of you that's made some wrong
[1:36:50] decisions and and probably said some
[1:36:52] things yesterday or the day before that
[1:36:54] you had to repent over and say Lord
[1:36:56] forgive me for saying it that way
[1:36:58] forgive me for that attitude forgive me
[1:37:00] for entertaining that thought remember
[1:37:02] David was an elect child of God it
[1:37:05] didn't keep him from making wrong
[1:37:09] decisions is that right so just because
[1:37:12] we're elect my we're just on
[1:37:14] autopilot no we have decisions to make
[1:37:19] this is why when the prophet got to is
[1:37:21] such a place I hope God gives me Grace
[1:37:23] I've studied on it for years on that
[1:37:25] whole part that he went through with
[1:37:26] about decisions and holding back and
[1:37:28] decisions and many of that has just
[1:37:30] opened up so wonderfully just waiting on
[1:37:31] the Lord to let me bring it but remember
[1:37:33] when the Holy Spirit told him and said
[1:37:36] why are you waiting on me to make the
[1:37:38] decision in other words I've already
[1:37:40] confirmed Divine Healing there needs not
[1:37:42] be no confirmation for that that has
[1:37:44] already been walk in it you don't need
[1:37:47] to pray and ask me do I need to pray for
[1:37:49] the sick I've already conf confirmed
[1:37:52] that are you with me amen but you see
[1:37:55] the prophet even began to hold back on
[1:37:57] that because he had developed a
[1:38:00] complex even a complex was hindering
[1:38:03] what God had already confirmed in his
[1:38:07] life but look what an example we had
[1:38:09] right with the Prophet The Prophet
[1:38:11] himself one of the things that you
[1:38:12] realize I think brother Brian referred
[1:38:14] to it on Thursday night with that with
[1:38:16] that uh that young man you know when he
[1:38:18] was was freed of that homosexual Spirit
[1:38:20] he he re raised up and remember what he
[1:38:22] said he he said I'm free I'm free he
[1:38:25] confessed that thing and got that right
[1:38:27] out in the open and one of the things
[1:38:29] that you find that even as brother R he
[1:38:31] didn't have to do that in front of all
[1:38:32] of us as a people and on tape tell me
[1:38:34] which one of us would have done that
[1:38:36] which one of you which which one of us
[1:38:37] would have got up and just announced it
[1:38:39] to everybody and said hey everybody in
[1:38:40] this church I want you to know I got a
[1:38:44] complex because I don't feel like I get
[1:38:46] to sing or I get to called as much as
[1:38:48] any nobody else but he got up
[1:38:51] and why did he do that to draw attention
[1:38:53] to himself no you know why he did that I
[1:38:56] believe God moved him to do that so that
[1:38:58] you and I could be able to relate and
[1:39:00] see as the prophet would say it service
[1:39:03] after service after service on past then
[1:39:06] it's so easy to build a complex and you
[1:39:10] know what a complex is a way of thinking
[1:39:14] about
[1:39:15] something is that right it's a way of
[1:39:18] thinking Lord have mercy
[1:39:24] but it's being
[1:39:25] honest and God can come down and speak
[1:39:28] to our
[1:39:30] hearts look at this he that'll lose his
[1:39:33] life for my sake shall find it Lord for
[1:39:39] his sake that's what we want our lives
[1:39:42] to be taken
[1:39:43] with because you see how how many of us
[1:39:46] have been to funeral services and things
[1:39:48] and you heard things this person was old
[1:39:51] they were great down at the uh you know
[1:39:53] the Garden Club and they were great here
[1:39:55] sometimes there's just so many great
[1:39:57] works of humanity where people have so
[1:40:00] given their lives oh they were the top
[1:40:03] of the booster club they fought for the
[1:40:05] kids they
[1:40:10] did they were right there to fight the
[1:40:13] wrongdoing on the
[1:40:15] workplace that's a
[1:40:17] trap the Bible says no man that
[1:40:22] Warth
[1:40:23] entangleth himself that's right not oh
[1:40:27] the Devil May no no no man who Warth
[1:40:30] entangleth himself with the Affairs of
[1:40:33] this life that he may please him who
[1:40:37] hath chosen him to be a good
[1:40:40] soldier see traps can come traps can
[1:40:43] come our way and what's you're trying to
[1:40:45] do take us away from the source of
[1:40:48] life that is there to change us try to
[1:40:52] get our Focus off on other things but
[1:40:55] watch he that'll lose his life for my
[1:40:57] sake you know it doesn't matter what
[1:40:59] what I would have at the bottom I I
[1:41:01] believe I'm going to I'm going in the
[1:41:02] Rapture I believe I'm going to see my
[1:41:04] loved ones I believe I'm going to be
[1:41:06] changed I believe I'm going to be alive
[1:41:08] and remain I'm pressing towards
[1:41:11] that Hallelujah I'm pressing towards
[1:41:14] that if there if it would happen to come
[1:41:17] an obituary and something would be read
[1:41:19] I don't want age of this life he was
[1:41:22] good at this good at that I want one
[1:41:25] thing to be said that he loved the Lord
[1:41:28] Jesus Christ better than he loved his
[1:41:31] own
[1:41:32] life he loved the Lord better than he
[1:41:35] loved his own
[1:41:38] reputation that's what I want to be
[1:41:43] said he that will lose his life for my
[1:41:46] sake shall find it now what would be in
[1:41:50] any more of a
[1:41:52] treasure than to find that life though
[1:41:55] you found the whole world to be
[1:41:57] yours but if you find life you found the
[1:42:02] greatest thing that could be found
[1:42:05] that's so
[1:42:06] good that's a witness
[1:42:11] right watch this how the prophet says
[1:42:13] this
[1:42:15] here
[1:42:16] Ruth was willing out of redeem and
[1:42:19] Redemption
[1:42:21] Ruth was willing everybody say
[1:42:24] willing to forsake her
[1:42:28] Idols well brother Samuel I
[1:42:31] was you know I've been raised around the
[1:42:34] message I don't have no Idols remember
[1:42:36] what the prophet tells us in Corinthians
[1:42:37] book of Corrections he picks up
[1:42:39] Corinthians chapter 10 where it speaks
[1:42:42] to them and says as those who sat down
[1:42:45] underneath the mountain while Moses went
[1:42:47] up and they begin to rise up and play
[1:42:51] and it says neither be ye
[1:42:54] idolators as some of them who begin to
[1:42:58] rise up and play and the prophet takes
[1:43:01] that scripture and he says now idolators
[1:43:04] he said to worship an idol doesn't Al to
[1:43:08] altogether mean that it's an image he
[1:43:10] said you can be i dle e Idol like a car
[1:43:16] that's just idling at a
[1:43:18] stop so this is no Wonder in the
[1:43:21] scripture cuz you see how sometimes we
[1:43:22] can read in the scriptures that don't
[1:43:24] ain't me ain't me I ain't no idolator
[1:43:27] praise God I've been called out of the
[1:43:29] earth of Calis but anything you keep in
[1:43:31] your life and will bow down to it when
[1:43:34] pressure comes situations come and you
[1:43:37] go back into your way and mode of acting
[1:43:40] about things that is reminiscent of your
[1:43:44] childhood let me tell you that's why you
[1:43:46] need the spirit of God to take care of
[1:43:49] you to take that out of you so you don't
[1:43:51] all of a sudden go back and relapse as
[1:43:53] it was when your days of childhood and
[1:43:55] it was in your days of high school oh no
[1:43:57] you may not throw yourself on the floor
[1:43:59] and throw a fit but you'll throw a fit
[1:44:01] for everybody else and pout on everybody
[1:44:03] else and try to ruin everybody else's
[1:44:05] time though you're not intentionally or
[1:44:07] even mindfully trying to do
[1:44:09] that but why is that that's cuz somebody
[1:44:12] didn't take you up and wear out your
[1:44:13] high in the beginning absolutely that's
[1:44:16] right that's exactly right and look what
[1:44:18] how look what kind of inservice it does
[1:44:20] you even right now it causes you to
[1:44:22] think that everybody on the job's
[1:44:24] against you it causes you to think that
[1:44:26] if somebody don't look at you in the
[1:44:27] right way that they're against you you
[1:44:29] know what it is listen friends listen
[1:44:31] don't L me back oh if I had a real daddy
[1:44:33] if I had a real mama there is a parent
[1:44:36] in the house here this morning there is
[1:44:39] a parent that is able to come down and
[1:44:42] move through every channel of your life
[1:44:44] where everything has been and the scars
[1:44:47] and the molding there is a great
[1:44:49] physician Hallelujah
