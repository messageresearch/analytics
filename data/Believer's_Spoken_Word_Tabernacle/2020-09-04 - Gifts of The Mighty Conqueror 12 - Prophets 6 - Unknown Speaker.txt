spirit lord in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen god bless you tonight if we could stand and so good to be in the house of the lord and good to see each and every one of you amen and i'm just so thankful to god for his mercy and just how the lord has just just been moving right here in our midst and i want to make mention to you i'd like to meet real quickly real quickly in the conference room with the musicians all the musicians and the songwriters just real quickly after the service and back there in the conference room and so if we could do that let's look here in the scriptures in deuteronomy 18 i'm just going to go ahead and go there first to begin with and just like to say it's so good to see see different faces here just really really good to see you and and so glad that he's here amen amen let's look here in the word of the lord we've been looking at this here out of ephesians 4. i'm not going to read from there but we've been looking at one of the gifts of the mighty conqueror that god would set in the church is that of prophets and we recognize that that that that term prophets it means one who foretells or tells forth under divine inspiration and and the and any any any preacher every preacher would could fall in underneath that when truly under the inspiration of the holy spirit but we're not just talking about when we're looking at this here in the scripture what we've been dealing with not just talking about just a a preacher a pastor apostle a teacher evangelist but we're talking about when god would send a man to an age or god sends a promise of his word to deliver his word to his people and that's what we're talking about that's what we're dealing with and that's what we're looking at that the blessedness of what god and god's mercy and his care that he would give to us so i want to just look here pick this up in deuteronomy 18 12. and god is talking about why he's going to dispossess the inhabitants that are already in the land before he brings israel into it he says for all all that that do these things are an abomination unto the lord now he's talking about all those who were you know given to necromancing and witchcraft and everything they were seeking it comes down to one thing they were seeking other source other sources for their leadership and so because of that it became apparent in their life and this is why god's going to put them out so he says and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god that means a completeness and a wholeness of self for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do what a blessing i say it's a blessing to be able to hear from god it's a blessing to be under his leadership and not to be given to all the other voices it's a blessing to have that of where god leads us into life and a real reality of himself amen could we go on in verse 15 the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me and unto him shall you hearken according to all that thou desirest of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire anymore that i die not and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken and i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and i will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him i want you just to catch this it's not enough that this man would have the ability to read right but god said i'm going to put my words my thoughts into his mouth it's one thing to have the bible it's another thing to have the word of the lord out verse 18 again i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die brother bran picks that up and says when that happens he said it isn't necessarily that that man dies right there it's that death has set in death has set in on his life spiritual death sets in and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him it doesn't matter what seems to be demonstrative power around him if what he says does not come to pass the teaching is off don't be afraid of him you stand upon the word amen we stand upon thus saith the lord amen glory be to god god bless you tonight as you're being seated so if god would bring it in this way as we read in the latter part of those verses and god would knowing that there would be others that would arise that and and and there had been others that arose there was a balaam balaam was a prophet balaam remember balaam was one whom god would move upon but recognizing that balaam himself was one that never had that of the word of the lord to really bring about the joining the people unto god but remember it was calling them into bondage and so there would be prophets that would arise god knowing that this would happen think about even from the garden of eden where satan himself when he began to talk to eve i mean it was uh if i can say it like this it was a great anointing that was there that began to fall upon eve in that time but the anointing that was coming upon her if she could have just tried it and not went by her feelings she would recognize that this anointing is not saying the same thing that god has already given us this is why that when the bible says beloved try every spirit whether it be of god or not the bible would go on to tell us in matthew 24 that there would be many false christs many false anointed ones and how that we would know the difference is by their fruit or their teaching of the word where where are they placing within the word if they bypass the word or they hook it up here or or just negate it then we recognize that we're standing on the word we're not standing up on an emotion we're not standing upon anointing we're standing on thus saith the lord amen and a true anointing of the word will always seek to position us in the word and build our faith in the word it will always it will always come in that measure so god knowing that there would be uh many that would arise different ones that would arise and they would come against uh israel and then we find this we've been looking here in the book of jeremiah a little bit you find that there were even prophets that were there in the time of jeremiah the time of ezekiel the time of isaiah there were others that were were very anointed but we recognize that just like those prophets that came up there and spoken spoke to ahab and said go on up and take ramos gilead we recognize that was a lion spirit that got in the mouth of those prophets now you ask everybody standing there and say was there anointing on in that place in that hour they would have told you there was a strong anointing but you recognize that every anointing must be tried by the word it's got to come back to is it tying the people to the word because you see if it ain't tying you to the word then you need to look where's it tying you to many chances and many times it's tying you to the reasoning of man which actually ties you to man and it grounds your faith so the power of god and the word does not become an absolute to your life it's grounded and god doesn't want his children then our faith would be grounded as a matter of fact god wants our faith to be in him not that we can explain it but simply we believe and know that he is the living god and he's ever present to perform the promise that he has made in this hour and to know that we are a part of that promise though your name may not have been wrote there within that promise yet when god manifests that promise there is something that just resonates within you that you cannot explain because it's the characteristic of that word being made manifest that's actually calling out your name just like when your name is called in the midst of a crowd or uh classroom or whatever more it gets your attention and this is what gets the attention of god's children is when he makes his promise real to you and i so if if if when a prophet when the when as he said in your heart when you say how am i going to know uh the word which the lord has not spoken and then he lays it down very clearly that you watch because what that man is saying will not follow now that that is true in that in that regards then we which it is true then we recognize the contrast that was spoken above that when he speaks in the name of the lord and it comes to pass hear him because it's not him that is speaking it is the lord speaking through him let me just give you examples here how that god will take right what was going on down in egypt god took miracle after miracle those miracles never ever helped pharaoh those miracles never built his faith into a place it never did that the only thing those miracles did it brought hardship on pharaoh and pharaoh said go if you only get this out of here i'll let the people go as soon as it was lifted pharaoh went right on back to being pharaoh but you see those miracles were not for the egyptians those miracles that were being done by god it was a creation of god when it was spoken like brother brown would say it like this he said when moses spoke about those flies coming he said when he spoke it there wasn't nothing right then he said but after just a little bit of time here came one green fly then another green fly then another green fly it began to multiply why it was not the voice of moses alone but it was the voice of the creator almighty god that had veiled himself in the voice of moses and he was speaking and bringing forth those miracles for one purpose that the people might recognize it is god among you amen it never benefited pharaoh but it benefited the believer it benefits the believer amen so when we when we we we we see it in that manner brother brown would pick it up like this and he says now anyone knows that the word of the lord comes to the prophet not to the priest but to the prophet that's amos 3 7. the bible said so the word of the lord coming to the prophet now stay with me now remember he didn't say the bible comes to the prophet he said the word of the lord [Music] there's a great difference than having having a bible and having the word of the lord we believe that the bible itself is god's mind in printed form we believe that's god's will but we need god to come on the scene we need inspiration the same one who spoke it and moved upon those who wrote it we need the inspirer of that word to come and make that word alive and make it real and when it is he manifests himself in that word nature being the same his character being the same so when we recognize this this is where the word of the lord comes unto the prophet and we know if it's the word of the lord and the prophet is true then his words are true then his words come to pass and that's his credentials that first it's the word and first god is the word so nothing is to be put before the word there were many many many uh visions and testimonies right in brother adam's writing brother brown's uh the ministry that was right there testimony after testimony after testimony things that were spoken that this is going to come to pass i'm talking about things where god would reveal to the prophet that there is a a little lamb that's caught up there in a certain place and and she's crying out for healing talking about georgie carter and here you know he wouldn't even though god could have given the name at that time but god didn't give that name at that time but he gave that vision and then things would continue to open and remember brother brown would tell us you can listen to it in visions of william branham be a good message to listen to or or a tape to listen to and brother branham as he brings that these are just some of the visions that god had spoken they weren't visions per se of the mysteries of god but they were there given by god that the elect of god might recognize there is something different about this man's ministry that stands out different from any other man this man was just not claiming things and talking about things and and blowing things up this man was speaking things that god was revealing to him and he was looking to god to bring him to pass i'm talking about a man that didn't even understand what visions were there were things where others in that time had told him that's of the devil you'll run yourself mine but aren't you glad that god in this hour he had a man that could be separated unto him and god would say this is a part of my word where men have ripped this out of the word i am called to restore my word that ain't the only thing he restores he restores back the light of sons and daughters of god amen it's a sign to you and i don't know hallelujah this ain't just another ministry oh like the white moody we're like no this ain't just another ministry this ain't me propping this up but i'm gonna stand and identify god has identified this word himself [Music] when there was disputes against this message god seemed fit there was a man this man wasn't a believer he was a critic and he took a picture when the prophet walked on the platform at houston texas he wasn't a believer this was a critic and the whole testament of george j lacy a chief investigator with the fbi when that negative prince brother the seventh negative when it came out brother in prayer it was identified that he says the camera lens of a photo my my mind it will not take psychology he said that is the only thing only time of evidence of a supernatural being that's been photographed oh if i can just preach for a minute there was a seed of god on the inside of you that one psychology could never change you he took a supernatural joy in this hour and there's a picture being developed in your life [Applause] you pass through the dark room of your own will you come out who are once darkness now are you light in the lord [Music] if it's the word of the lord and the prophet is true then his words are true then his words come to pass and that's his credentials there's no such thing as who are you linked to what organization you're part of every man of god every believer of god gets his papers from the same school are you with me i'm talking about the school of almighty god where god calls hearts and lives unto himself and he presses his own image to where that man or that woman we're not walking under the authority of a school we don't need the authority of the school we've got the authority of almighty god behind us you don't have to ask somebody can you live a christian life let me preach and i have you don't have to ask the devil can i live a christian life you've got authority under this word to rise up and live as a son and daughter of god hallelujah you don't have to ask nobody oh my god and then if he speaks a word and it happens then that shows that god has divinely set that man now we were looking at it even some weeks ago about it with ezekiel that's not the only place that's mentioned but remember when god was going to take ezekiel he told ezekiel in the word eat up the scroll he is dealing with the prophet by vision he sees a scroll that's before him now in order to eat this crow it's got to be open before him you can't eat what's not open [Music] but when it's open then you can eat it what was god saying in that vision god was letting it be known that the pattern all the way down for the prophets and the pattern for every son and daughter of god we must be a partaker of that word it cannot be something we just carry out here but it's got to be something that we become one with we become energized with the very nutrients with the very life of that word living on the inside of us that's why jesus said my words they are spirit and light he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you see they were looking at it and said this man's a vampire but what they failed to recognize here was the book and that book was standing there before them and flesh this was a scroll this was that word right here on display in that time they themselves were invited to be partakers of that word now as ezekiel being a prophet let me just try to stay within this this channel he was to be a partaker of that word now remember the spirit of god spoke to him and said eat the words all that i give you so it was the spirit of god this was not ezekiel giving himself word or interpretation this was the spirit of god that was interpreting the word he was placing it inside of ezekiel you recognize that what god does with the prophets is a is a direct desire of what god would call and is calling every son and daughter of god back to back to a divine authority where the word itself is dwelling inside of you and you are inside of it in other words the word itself is living out its life through your life hallelujah so he would become ezekiel would become the spokesman of the thoughts of god to the people who were supposed to be the people of god now when we look at this you know it's no wonder where the scripture said in in peter that holy men of old that word holy means men who were set aside sanctified by god set apart and god could come and move through their lives they wrote the scriptures under divine inspiration things that they themselves that god would not god would put a seal on it even to them that they themselves would not even understand it even in that time but god would go ahead and lay it out and the same god that would lay it out is the same god that would then open that seal upon that inspiration when it was time for a people upon earth to come in line with that word you see god is always letting it be known that the devil don't have no tricks on him the devil doesn't have anything on him that oh my i wasn't planning this no sir if god already knows everything the end from the beginning he's already prepared of what is needed to meet the challenge of the hour so we recognize these were vessels that were set aside and yielded to the leading of the holy spirit where where even things that was against their own thinking they were more inclined to the leading of the holy spirit than their own thinking that's a very powerful call to our lives inclined god taking prisoners that are inclined more to his word to the inspiration that's coming more than we are to our own reasonings you know how it is your own reasonings if you let go your own reasonings or reason you right away from the promise your own reasonings are reasoning right away that well it can't be for you or it ain't for you but this is why the bible says he didn't say that reasonings wouldn't come it said cast them down you've got an authority and a right to cast them down now when we look at this here how god god would so take that gift or that calling that god had placed that one that was foreign and god would wrap himself in that life of that individual you know that would blind the carnal the carnal believer or the car that of the world they would so blind because all they could see was that man all they could hear was that man's voice but to the elect of god you realize the scripture said from among your brother and i'll raise one up it wasn't talking about a denomination god don't bring prophets out of denominations he talking about from the elect from among thy brethren god visits and god makes himself known and that word comes forth it's not for everybody i know sometimes we want to try to get it to everybody and i think there's a desire that we should want to share that which god has done for us what it means to us what he himself is to you and i in this hour but we recognize we did not bring ourselves into that quality that quality was laying inside of us it was a sovereign and is a sovereign work of almighty god it takes god to turn the heart it takes god to open the eyes it's not a man or a church or a system can do it it's god sovereignly moving just like a great magnet that comes through a room those that are magnetized to it will be drawn to it and they will move with that magnet hallelujah this is god's promise and fulfillment of his word so you know it's god's voice speaking through that man let me read just a few verses of scripture here are familiar in exodus 3 7. here is where god is is now he's got moses attention now i want you i want to remind you moses knew the promise all right yeah are you with me he knew it he could quote it he had been raised on it hallelujah he knew the bible but he didn't have the word of the lord personally this is why the baptism of the holy ghost the real baptism of the holy ghost is the voice of god speaking personally to you it's where god is laying claim upon your life hallelujah now here his own ideas remember moses had some had a good idea but his idea only killed one egyptian right there might be one thing you can get rid of in your life but if it's still there in your heart you ain't got rid of it but we're talking about a god who can come down he don't just replace heart valves this one said i'll give you a new heart i give you a new spirit and then i'll put my spirit on the inside of you i'm talking about one who does a full work for you and i there the bible says in verse seven here when god had got his attention and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their taste masters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land onto a land a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the canaanites the hittites amorites parasites herebytes and jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me notice how what god is declaring he declares once again in verse 9 the reason that i'm here the reason i'm come down i'm sending you down there i've come down to deliver them from the hand of oppression that they are under i've heard their crimes let me just say this now israel was going about their lives and everything was all right sure it was burdensome sure it was bothersome sure there was things that they they wish they would they wish that they were free but it but their cry went from a difference of complaining and it moved from a way that they themselves were longing for deliverance from the oppression if they could really see it and they did that there was an oppression that they were under and god said i've seen their sorrow now notice moses was out there minding his own business but god said i've heard their i wonder how many of them in that hour said why amram are you up there praying again or they looked at others why are we still praying why are we still looking for a deliverer things are worse now than it's ever been but that's when faith really declares itself faith the faith itself will find its worship in the temple of god's word it will stand there and say god has said it i may not see it feel it understand it or not how it's going to be but god said it and i am tied to that word i'm a part of that word i'm looking for god to fulfill that word god heard their cry i wonder how many times the devil told him you're crying meaning nothing but god was going to come and personally let him know he was going to send his word by a prophet and that word was going to address the present conditions and was going to call them out of from under that oppression oh i wish i could really preach here i've seen the cry of the children of israel to come unto me and i have also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt now when we think of this how god is going to deliver this this of his people from what is the mightiest nation on the earth there's not a mightier nation not a mightier army and god's sending a man down there this man doesn't have tanks behind him he doesn't have an armed militia behind him amen he's one man and his family's with him he's in the minority as far as when it comes to individuals but he's actually in the majority [Applause] because god is with him amen now when they come into this god is letting them know i'm going to come down i've come down but i'm going in the form of a man in verse 8 you know how when moses is talking with god and i want to get to this place of the voice and how god would speak to moses and it says it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice then thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land now remember the generation that receives the word is blessed but those who reject it judgment is poured out this is what was taking place right here that if they refuse the first two signs then in this last one i want you to pour blood out they will take water of the now pour it out it will become blood that was a judgment sign and the water which shall take us out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land now as we said the voice of god is contrary to the voice of man this is why god would say in isaiah 55 my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways but they're higher yes amen you see in this time of the exodus that was going on we recognize that what is going to happen here down in egypt is actually going to be a conflict a war that's going to be fought there's going to be the voice of god that's going to come against the voice of reasoning are you with me now the voice of reasoning has caused one to rise up who knew not joseph you see he did not know the blessings of joseph is that right and so because of that then we recognize that the voice of reasoning would rise up you see when we read in the scriptures you and i read it and we see how that you know pharaoh made an edict and his edict was to take the children and t and every man child that's born that day of the israelites they were to take that child and they were to uh instructed the midwives they want to take it and you know to throw it in there to the crocodiles and you recognize that the whole the whole objective was is that satan himself their spiritual powers that are at work let me just say this brother and sister you and i i believe that god by the grace of god with the holy spirit he gives to you and i eyes that go beyond what we're seeing and hearing here i want you to understand that what has been going on what is going on it is demonic battles in another realm there are demons and and fighting but yet at the same time while all hell is right here and it's able to manifest through people's lives then at the same time all heaven is right here as well god is here and he's manifesting himself in and through the lives of the believers it matters what your eyes are set to as to how you'll be affected if your eyes get on the natural earthly carnal things you can be affected but if your eyes are focused upon the promise and your eyes are focused on the living god then there is a strength that stabilizes you in this hour because you know this is not my home this is not my destination i'm just a pilgrim and a stranger i'm passing through i've already got my passport with the visa the token i've already got it and i'm ready to make my departure amen they were taking the children and killing them brother we'll pick this up and third exodus he said that's exactly when he talks about the spiritual powers at work he said this is exactly he said what the enemy has done when he came in i talked about that previous election with john f kennedy and how that he came in and he ties this in what's happening down in egypt to that of the image that that nebuchadnezzar that daniel saw where you find that the iron and the clay intermingling the intermarrying you know getting a catholic boy and a protestant girl and all these things and trying to break down through intermarrying and all that part you know what it all comes down to of hybriding that satan himself he has he he is not able to stand against the revealed word of the hour satan is not able to stand against that word but what he can stand against is if there is a seed that is hybrid in there which would actually be the voice of reasoning then that itself it comes from man and that is powerless before satan but when god's voice comes on the scene oh my brother satan cannot stand before god's voice [Applause] you see it was a conflict going on it was the voice of god coming by the way of his word by promise and it was going to challenge the voice of reasoning the voice of reasoning had put many of them in spiritual depth and threw many of them in that bed i threw many of them in that nile river but there was a word now listen to me now just as the voice of reasoning it tries to come and suppress the reality of who the real children of god is but when god's voice begins to sweep by his dynamic power there is life and see on the inside brother it causes that life to rise above reasoning why it is the same wind of the holy ghost it moves down and it takes that heart that is so pressed and cast down and looking down but it begins to lift that heart into a place to say this is who i really am i know i never was this this is who i really am what's doing that the resting mighty wind of the voice of god coming by his promise so god's voice is very important [Music] brother brown would say like this if the voice comes the same old voice you see a sign and the sign that the man is doing is the same old school of thought then you can say right there that didn't come from god notice not saying that oh my goodness what a sign no the school old school of thought they might have a sign maybe sick is healed but if it's not the voice coming by way of the word it's not of god brother brown would say in many other places as well but we can see that in the scripture you see god god gives to you and i the discernment and where that you and i can stand in this hour if it keeps identifying the same old school of thought it never did it never has it would be against god's program it's got to be something new it's got to be something that the people don't understand see it cannot be confined to the reasonings of man god's voice our understanding of the word is not because we are good readers truth be known most of you even that are good readers even if you're advanced and you read you know this particular level you realize most of the reading that we do is sixth grade level reading newspapers on and on and on and on and on and on and on okay and well we won't go there but anyhow the the the things that you recognize that that with that it's going to take more it's more than just reading we don't need reading [Music] even though the bible would say in the in revelations chapter 1 blessed is he that readeth and heareth the words of this book but it's not based on just you and i reading from our own understanding or hearing from our own understanding but our inspiration we are under inspiration of god we're not reading by our own thoughts or our own thinking but we're reading by coming under the inspiration of almighty god so that way when we look at the bible itself it's not just well this is the bible but now when we open the bible it's not just a letter but it has become light to you and i and the word is open the voice of god is speaking out of there and we see him to be the same yesterday today or forever you see any true word of god doesn't need another book to back it up it don't need to add another book to the bible but what god has sent he comes to make alive and a real what he's promised in his word hallelujah so notice it don't need to be sin if it's the same old school of theology yet it's it's got to be identified in the word that it's for that day you see he said the positives of god's word there's no slip ups to it it's got to be the truth got to be vindicated by god the truth and the man who speaks it has to be vindicated of god to be a seer from god or it's wrong it goes on he says now the signs are from god everybody all right the voice that follows the sign must be the voice of god speaking from the word for that age the simple the simple things that brother branham would take us back to there was a deliverance that was needed from egypt even though moses knew how god had visited noah but it had to be the message of christ for that generation it couldn't just take the form of building an ark again that was not what the inspiration of christ had revealed in that hour it had to be the inspiration of christ in that hour that would reveal that in that ark was safety are you with me and then it would reveal in this time of the exodus that the real deliverance would come after the blood had been applied and that the firstborn were brought under the blood which is also the ark of god which is the place of safety which is his life so it's finding the inspiration of christ for that hour can you imagine what it would have looked like standing in egypt they could have had an ark they could have built the most elaborate ark in the world that was not god's plan for the day you understand it was the same characteristic same nature to be hidden in a place of safety under the blood the blood itself it became that place of safety that the deaf angel could come up to that door but when it saw the blood oh my the deaf angel didn't look inside there and see who was in there the death angel came and was strictly told that when i see the blood i'll pass over you let me just tell you something tonight you might be sitting in a safe and a situation you might say you don't know my life but i'm going to tell you tonight when a worshiper came to worship god the the high priest he never inspected the worshiper he inspected the sacrifice that he was bringing let me just tell you something the sacrifice this word that's coming forth right now it is jesus christ the passover lamb and if you can bring that layer and identify yourself he ain't inspecting you whether you're worthy you're saying i identify with this lamb [Applause] and god takes the lamb [Applause] and this time he takes you with him god give signs always give signs he told them that's what they look for in the signs god gives signs to attract the tension of his people now you might say brother samuel we don't need signs no more you speak for yourself all right i got a piece of my wife with me i love you honey but you know my weaknesses we need signs i said we need signs and wonders you see these are things this is where we have to walk by the balance of the holy ghost it's true the bible says that a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign but the prophet of god will pick up that scripture and says what it is these are people who are longing just for an emotion he said people can get emotional at the sunset but that don't mean that you've received a resurrection sign so we need signs and wonders and brother branham would pray oh god every once in a while come among us and let us see lord god yourself that you're still the same yesterday today and forever that's a longing of believers brother graham stands in perfect faith and he says as believers we are longing to see real apostolic times again why because the word brings that reality it's an expectation because it's him in our midst he's the one who heals the sick he's the one that delivers the oppressed he's the one that feels with the holy ghost hallelujah he's the great one in our midst god give sign to attract the attention of the people he said let's study this signs are given to attract the attention of the people because listen to this when a god-sent sign is given god is getting ready to speak it'd be kind of foolish to start speaking and you don't got people's attention right you know how it is like in a wedding or birthday gathering and you want to do a certain event well everybody's there for the birthday or for the wedding or whatever right right but you just don't start somebody don't come up and just start saying well i want to just say how i appreciate the groom and the bride so much i really appreciate them you want to make sure what they're saying everybody hears right now you may have to have some big i mean you may have to have somebody who can come up and say everybody be quiet they might be louder than the pa but right or they can whistle and they get everybody's attention why because something's got to be said and what has to be said you need to hear it is that right it's just like when you know the buses they stop at those railroad tracks they open the doors everybody on the bus has got to get quiet right because you know why they're told don't just go by lights because sometimes them lights can fail but the sound of the train will never fail is that right so there's a reason when god gives a sign he's ready to speak oh my if it comes from heaven it's from god and god is ready to speak and he's trying to attract the people's attention and the word comes to his prophet and the prophet is identified by the sign that he shows and then he comes to the word comes to the word and the word is made manifest that settles they don't need any interpretation god's already interpreted just as perfect as it can be god gives a sign to attract the attention of the people now when we look at this with with with israel remember when israel came out they were under a natural lamb a natural blood is that right it was a type of the lamb of the lamb uh the blood of the lamb speaking of the lord jesus under that natural lamb they could come out and murmur and complain but once a heart gets under that lamb the the blood of the lamb of god once that heart comes under there oh it ain't saying that there ain't times that ain't hard but there's there is a delight within us that you know what we found the joy of our life that he is our life and and we don't understand every way that he'll lead us in the tests and trials and as they come but we know one thing that he is mine and i am his yes but all these signs and wonders even the opening of the red sea think how david david would say this david would say it i think also in another part of the psalms but he would say our fathers understood not the miracles they they did not become wise by them this is what it means to understand they did not become wise remember what the wise is the wise is the type of those who have their vessels filled with oil who have understanding the bible in the book of proverbs says the wise is able to take correction and grow from that correction they were not able they were not able to understand the miracles that it what god was doing god was letting known to them his love his care of his promise it was grace that god had provided to them a prophet with a pillar of fire and this word to lead them all the way through think about it these are individuals that walk upon dry ground they saw the red sea open they ate a manner that came down there were quails that came down in the camp they drank from that water in the rock brother it was supernatural all around them but they never itself accepted to recognize that that supernatural god was identifying himself according to the promise to build their faith in the promise that they were a part of it they seen it they heard it but it was never mixed with faith let me just tell you what god is doing when god speaks to your heart listen it's time to understand that it's god speaking to my heart don't try to reason and out like well he might have been you know he might have been sad even if i wasn't here if you've been streaming and you got a need god will find it right to your doorstep god knows your address he knows what you got need of it's not a chance that even you're here any of us tonight it's not a chance that i'm preaching what i'm preaching tonight it is ordained of almighty god and god knows exactly what we have need of he comes to meet the conditions of the hour [Applause] now think of this let me just have just a few more moments is that okay i want to try to get us to a certain place here tonight if they had understood by divine revelation it would they they would have walked like caleb and joshua walked opposition opposition was there the devil is always there to oppose promises being taken to show you as far as when it comes to the natural man the impossibilities the odds are against us but when we can recognize god made the promise and i'm going to stand on that promise with the lord then it's up to god to bring that promise to pass faith says i don't know how he's going to do it but i know he's going to do it i know i belong to him and he cannot fail you see this is why are you with me now this is why it's got to be more than just moses was a mighty man of god right are you hearing me it's got to be more than just myself and moses oh he's a mighty man of god this has got to be a personal revelation that this is the man that has met god face to face and god has come down to deliver the message that he that is going to under unfold to me my inheritance it's going to take me from egypt it's going to take me into my position you see that's a that's got to be a revelation if it's just man moses is a mighty man of god there'll be a balaam come along come on now there'll be another one with signs and wonders and whatever more but let me just tell you something balaam wasn't even close to moses i'm just going to say it hands down there ain't been another ministry on this earth that present close to william branham's ministry i say that unabashedly i say it unashamedly because it's absolutely the truth there ain't never nearly one of them as a matter of fact you found every one of them pl osborne and the rest of them that was right there they themselves were appalled and and looked at how that god would use that man and think of how t.l osborne would say it he said we had forgot how jesus christ was so god in this generation came down and made it known to you and i that he's still the same and this is how he really is god took the flesh of william branham and veiled himself to this world but to you and i that have eyes to see it takes us beyond that veil we can see it's the living god and to understand it that what god demonstrated there it's the same god working in power bringing his word to pass in our life oh i feel like preaching or dancing or something praise god someone out of breath i might run a little bit see they would have come under that word now just let me let me i'm trying to hone this down bill brown would say it like this when if god puts his word in a person well it's not that person anymore it's him if the man is saying it in himself it won't amount to anything but if he but if the word of the lord is in the man it'll come forth it'll be just exactly right he refers us to deuteronomy where we read where we read from let me skip on down to the next paragraph paragraph 19. that's how god has he's talking about god's program he's got his regular program laid out here in the bible we know how to read that out but there are certain things listen now there's certain things that to the church and to the time and things that he hasn't got written here in the bible example the things that some of that just even sharing with you even here tonight how that the spirit of god would tie together what's going on down there in egypt where there was spiritual death happening to the children it would tie it into that of revelations 2 well i will cast her children into a bed of death into that of tribulation it was tying it in to that of daniel of that image down there in the feet you see these are things listen that are laying all in the scripture but it takes a divine inspiration a word from god to be able to tie those promises together not to and many other people they just look at it and say wow that's something but you see it's something different when the inspiration of god who inspired daniel who inspired the different ones that were down there when moses wrote exodus it's something different when the inspiration of god comes upon that word and reveals to you who you are it reveals to you a time it reveals to you what's going on it isn't something to you and i just walk away from and say wow that's something but it's god he has checkpoints that are laid out in his word that lets you and i know that though that is a historical event that was prophecy that is prophesied of this hour of this exodus of this time there are things that are written not written in the word such as abraham and sarah having a body change that's not wrong in the word but yet abimelech he wasn't had an old grandma don't mean defend grandma's tonight but he wants grandma you know he's like i heard brother ron spencer say one time he's here with a bamboo coming up we're here with sarah coming up on a cane in alabama look lusted after her no not an old grandma you're with me it's not wrote in the world but inspiration comes to to pick that out of the word things that are wrong in there and not only that but also things that are announcing things to come that were even telling the people the organizations at that time if you go in this way of organization death awaits you your members will die the pentecostal church will die you see god was already making it known ahead of time it was not rope per se in the word but the inspiration that is tied to the promise of the word and this hour the word brings a vision and a sight i don't mean to stop and say is that clear but i know it takes him to make it clear but so there's certain things that to the church and to the time things that he hasn't gotten written in the bible so he puts listen to this so he puts his voice into a person and they speak it forward speak it for then the way to judge that person is find out whether it happens what they say if it does then keeps it keeps happening that way well then you know that comes from god and then we have the confidence to make ready for the things that's coming amen i say amen to that tonight we see the things that's unfolding that's why i said even here on sunday i think back to it i think when we look at things listen friends you go back and you listen to the message these things that's happening and while we see the condition of the world it should not be let me just how do i say this things sometimes the way you see things taking place are happening it's almost jaw-dropping like how in the world but yet god has detailed it yes you listen in the message the third exit brother brown deals with the spirits that are at work trying to bring distraction before that exodus the racial tensions and everything like that he's dealing with all that the spirit of god says government can never turn it around what government has pushed in he said it takes the baptism of the holy ghost amen that's the answer it's what we've been proclaiming that's the real answer is the holy ghost [Music] you see all that the enemy wants to do it stokes its spirits that are being stolen but the real spirit of god brings divine love you see all those things and everything that is taking place we recognize that's all distractions so i say in love don't be distracted on any front you understand don't be over here on this or don't be over here on this stand with him who says i stand in the midst are you with me [Music] oh man i know i lose some of you on that sometimes but i pray god will help you yeah isaiah 8 20. i want you to see this here god lets it be known in isaiah 8 20. if they speak not according to this word it's because there's no light in them what does light come to do what why do you have life i mean you got to be able to see right now you might say i can get around my house at night let me come in and move your furniture around and then you'll wake the whole house up stubbing your toe you know why because you're presuming has finally caught up somebody moved things around and you're just presuming okay arm length away from this wall yeah past that chair that desk chair but you let somebody put the desk chair out here and you got oh yeah armament that's the way it always is boom all right what does light do light takes things that are mysterious and just uncovers the darkness can be spooky darkness can cause worry it can cause fear but when light comes it drives back any darkness it drives back shadows see this is why when darkness is the long as the enemy can try to keep darkness upon the promise it can bring fear that's right but when he comes and makes himself known by way of the promise and you begin to look in and you begin to see light and say that's me that's for me you know what's happening darkness is fleeing away amen and as you begin to see yourself darkness is fleeing away shadows are being pressed back why light is more powerful in the darkness we could we could we could darken this whole building and you give me a match plan a little match i know i like that match up guess what it'll light it up in here a little bit i mean it ain't going to light it up like but it is light it don't matter how small that light is it's greater than the darkness [Applause] that's why brother branham would put it just like this in the message messiah god himself moves into your life as you surrender your life to god he said it's like a little white button and the more that you can let him have the right away push out envy bitterness strife you say how do i push it out when he comes and deals with it because your heart is saying lord i want to be full of you i i want to be in you lord i want my life completely i don't want in one area of my life outside of you and as you're doing that now notice what it's doing it's inviting him to come and make himself more real to you and though it started out as a little button of light the more as he would deal with your life and you say yes lord the more that little black button it's growing within you you know what that is because obedience to the word it allows the light of the word to grow in power and strengthen your life until eventually the things that as you begin to witness and see things that you thought that were impossible but it now is becoming possible to you because the living god is coming in and performing his word through your life he's building faith on top of faith on top of faith if thou in thy heart can say unto this mountain be thou removed plucked out and cast into the undersea and don't doubt in your heart it shall be even as you have said that light grows you know when it grows it just kind of pushes things out it'd be like if i put like 10 of brother williams on this pew with brother brian and sister barb and brother brother tender brother william kept on coming one two three four eventually these two might get pushed out i know it's a real simple example that's the same way the word coming in your life as you're taking in the word you become the word it's pushing out darkness it pushes out desires it pushes out holes [Applause] it's the power of this life [Applause] oh my let's just let's just stop here hallelujah let's just bow our heads lord jesus you're so faithful lord oh god you come to minister courage love and ability lord your light as you come by your word lord it's you that gives strength to the believer lord it's you that pushes back darkness it's you that comes lord and you give strength that thoughts that would arise that would speak contrary to what the word is saying about us you come and that word gives us strength to cast that down father you know the needs here tonight lord jesus we've looked at it here a little bit a little broke up way of how that the word of the lord will come to the prophet this is what we realize lord that we're men in this hour many were and still there's contentious debates about do we need the greek or every right word or this or that that god you would you would come by your presence and you would send your profit in this hour and it would speak to our hearts to let us know we don't have to be great learned people that's not what it is we don't have to know all the greek don't have to know all the hebrew don't have to know all the vernacular as a matter of fact lord you would express yourself and you would tell us through the prophet of god that it's going to take more than just a student comparing bible verse to bible verse to make the book real it'll take a work or the word that's used an operation of the holy ghost it will take you to come upon this word lord god that this word would become alive to us lord jesus i believe god that's the desire that's what you call each and every one of us as your children [Music] then lord that the word of the lord that inspiration it would come to our hearts it would come lord to bring conviction it comes to lead us in the path of life it comes to bring us back home we could read the bible and read the bible and still never make it back home but you come the author of the word and you come and you make that word alive and real it's not even anything that we can explain we can't even understand it of how you're working but in lord it just takes hold of us sure as we walk on with you we begin to understand more and more our faith would grow but lord we find this we walk on with you we recognize more and more the simplicity that we are your work it's you working in us it's you working through us and it must be you lord god performing your word in our life in other words lord it doesn't make us dependent upon our reasoning it makes us dependent more and more upon you lord jesus i pray tonight that as you've spoke to our hearts you know every need that's gathered here i just asked the lord that you administer to those hearts the requests that they have for you may you come lord may they be honest before you may you come lord and just may they take that request before you may they not come before you as a pauper or a beggar but may they recognize lord jesus that what you have made known to them what you are speaking to them lord you're calling them as sons and daughters of god if there's any lord that's bound with sin tonight lord god under the authority of the word of god and the holy spirit to that heart lord that maybe doesn't have the strength to walk free but tonight lord god from their heart their desire is i want to be free then lord god under the inspiration of the holy spirit lord i speak to that unclean spirit the lord god would seek to hold that life in oppression satan in the name of jesus christ you're defeated and you know you're defeated and you lost the victory our lord jesus christ is right here among us and in the name of jesus christ take your hands off lord god sicknesses diseases afflictions in the mind father i ask the lord god right now that has hearts realizing that we can't do it but we're in the presence of a living god not a but the living god lord you still heal the sick it might not be something that they receive lord their miracle right here tonight but there's a miracle takes place inside of their life that lord it becomes settled that i'm healed the voice of god would speak right to their heart they might have a test that's before them lord satan coming and trying to trouble about results that can come lord jesus we take the authority of your word and we realize lord there's another report that we have received the life of the one who manifested that report from the arm of the lord i pray dear god may they take that rest from the voice of god may it be that voice that would so lord speak into their heart tonight lord god just say it's finished don't worry lord jesus you know the needs of your children you know every need that's here i pray god that right now has our hearts just open to you may you just come and minister and then continue to encourage your children in your promise i pray in the name of jesus christ amen amen you love him [Music] amen could we stand with brian come and take [Music] me with you jesus let's just worship him out [Music] [Applause] [Music] for without you or foreign [Music] with you jesus [Music] don't ever leave me alone without you i know [Music] i could never [Music] make heaven my home amen you found it oh you found me when i was [Music] and lord you found me when i was so blue oh you found me when no one could help when no one knew just what to do so let me walk and let me
