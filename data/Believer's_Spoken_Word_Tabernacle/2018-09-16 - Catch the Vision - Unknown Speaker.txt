he's done for us I want to say God bless you this morning good to see each one good to be with you again we want to thank the church many people have called her but interested that I've been sick just shortly after the last time I preached here and so we're doing much better by the grace of God he's still healer we still deliver and I just want to give him praise for that and so it's my privilege to stand before you this morning to minister once again appreciate the saints of God here and the Spirit of God in this place it's just always so it's just always really nice to be here with you all you know well I don't want to say a whole lot but you go some places you wonder where you're going sometimes but you know just as I was driving here this more I thought you know just like that song I haven't regretted a mile and so I appreciate the the ability to be here this morning and I'll probably get in trouble for this later but I couldn't do it without my wife Maria who's here she saw it raining her birthday today say a whole lot more I think she's glaring at me but she's been faithful all these years I actually actually met her at a birthday party I've been going to church the same churches her and I got invited and there's a whole story behind that maybe she'll tell you later because I preached a whole another sermon if I do that but one thing led to another and I'm thankful for a revelation of a godly wife brother Branham says the best thing God giving me an outside of salvation so we just thank God if you have your Bibles this morning we want to look into the book of Revelation the 22nd chapter amen the 22nd chapter here will read here for well just start in the sixth verse and we just think our Lord Jesus Christ he's been faithful to give us a message in this hour we don't have to wander about in the gross darkness of lair to see you wondering where we're at amen you know some people they got a map no compass and some people there they've got a compass and no mat but we've got the mechanics and the dynamics this morning we know who we are and why we're here is that right praise the Lord revelation the 22nd chapter in the sixth verse as an angel speaking to John it says and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy Prophets sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done verse 7 behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God and he's safe let me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book why for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is right just be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end the first and the last blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have rights think about that I have a right into it now right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie verse 16 here says I Jesus sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star and the spirit of the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely i wonder if we could just bow our heads this morning for word of Prayer our most gracious Heavenly Father we are so grateful to be gathered together this morning again and that name above every other name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for those a promise given to us in the scripture that if two or three of us would gather together in that Ning he would be in our midst Lord we just pray now we just take this time and set aside and sanctify it to observe the resurrection not simply as an event 2000 years ago but as a life that is in us today as believers and lo were so grateful for a few not risen Lord our faith in our worship everything would be in vain we of all men will be most miserable this morning but we are so thankful that there is a living Savior today and that you live in your people and you've come now I believe by your promise to be in our midst Lord may you walk these aisles in the very corridors even of our hearts from every door and window now be open to you lure me you have preeminence in this service and in each life father may your warm our spirits and our souls by the power the presence of the Holy Ghost in fire and Lord may this not just be another time that we get together as human beings but may we be mindful that the king of kings and the Lord of lords has come into our presence and we have come before the feet of him that which made heaven and earth and Lord we just invite and we ask and we believe now and you would do mighty things arm it's supernatural things and I'm its father that you could do things in our myths that we ourselves as human beings we are not able to do with our own hands and our own Emmaus father there are situations in our lives today in this church that we have no answer for in our own a being or own ability we have no solution to the problems of life which beset us but I'm persuaded as the Apostle Paul said that you can do exceeding abundantly above anything that we could ask or even think this morning I'm I'm so thankful father I'm persuaded that you know each knee before we even ask so we have to pray now Lord you'd come and do that which is needful get yourself great glory and honor in the midst of these your children and we give you all the praise and glory for we ask it in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the church said Amen god bless yous you're seated today you know sometimes the devil will tell you you getting up and maybe you're just a little tired and body and well we better just go to church today and we better just do this but let's let's not just show up to church let's be the church today I want to remind you right now before I say another word I want to remind you right now that you are overcomers this Bible this book of Revelation is prophesied about you and your life you are the overcomers of this age you're the overcomers of darkness and of death and of sin so you've got a reason to be here today you've got to reach the testify and rejoice about them songs you sing today praise the Lord somebody I want to take this thought this morning from this book of revelation about catch the vision hey men catching the vision we look here in this scripture and we look at the angel he was told to seal not the sayings he told John still not the sayings of the prophecy of this book and the reason was because the time is at hand hey men we look at this Bible and we read another scripture routine here this morning Isaiah the 29th chapter he says in maybe it's the 28th I'm sorry but he says here in the ninth verse he says state yourselves and wonder and cry out and cry he says they are drunk you but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink he says for the Lord has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and has closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers Hathi covered this isn't the vision of all's become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed and which men delivered to one that has learned saying read this I pray that he said I cannot for it is sealed notice your education cannot open this book a man handed to the line he said I can't read this it's sealed and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this I pray thee he said I am not learned so notice whether you're an educated man or you're an uneducated person that doesn't give you any power or ability to read this book because the Spirit of deep sleep he said was poured out on them I believe we're living in the day and age where a spirit of deep sleep has been poured upon the people and they're drawing in gross darkness because they received not the love of the truth they should believe a lie and be damned to by it they go on deceiving and being deceived that's the spirit of this age they're like a boy brother Ram said walking through a graveyard whistling knowing that destruction is looming over the bed of any moment on atomic bomb or some disaster could strike we're there and yet they go on to their lives haphazard willfully ignorant of what is going on but I'm so thankful that a light has come to us and you're not at them that sleep in the night or them that a drunken is their drunken in the night but you are the children of the day and you were the children of the light and the light has come upon you and the Bible says arise and shine for thy light has come we're not asleep but something has awakened in this bride the Bible says the lake unto righteousness and then hallelujah somebody well praise the Lord and that will happen in this day you found out you never did it in the first place we found that you were always a child of God but you were asleep you were ignorant of it but a lot of voices come and it scared you out of the slum and on the spirit of deep sleep and he's giving you a vision of a book that was closed to the world yet it's been open to an elected people there's a chosen people I believe I'm preaching to him today there's a chosen people on this earth that they've been handing the book revelation 10 they've been handed a book not that a seal not that is close but an open book has been handed to the people of God well praise the Lord somebody that's pretty good now like this book this Bible we talked about it's a book of dispensations where the RAM preaches not Amen you look at the book of the prophet Daniel and he like the Apostle John he saw a vision of the kingdoms of the Gentiles and of the end time and what was he told to do he say he was told to seal these things up is that right well uh Daniel chapter 12 he says here in the fourth verse but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased verse 9 and he said go away Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end now I want you to consider this even brother Brandon himself as a prophet he would see a vision perhaps he'd be in a room and he sees somebody sick laying on the bed and he's seen a hat sitting on television in a certain place and a certain person standing in the corner and he would see a vision of something that was going to come to pass and this prophet now this is an anointed prophet a man of God a man that has prayed for the sick and seen miracles that prophet for all who was calling and all his ability to pray he could pray for that boy till he was blue in the face he could fast he could pray and he could he could muster up all the faith that was in him and yet it was for an appointed time no matter how much he prayed amen no matter how much he sought God or how much he desired to see this boy made well yet there was an appointed time for it and the vision show what the time of it was to all of his faith let me say this that boys America was sealed up in that vision it was sealed not measured but when the time it would come to pass praise the Lord somebody what everything was in its place let me say this this book of the body this book of elation when everything is in its place when all the prophecies have become fulfilled and the time for these things is at hand is that right a prophet of God has told us he sees nothing they'll hinder the coming of the Lord outside of the readiness of his church listen all the pieces are in their place although all the hats and all the people everything is lying that this is what the prophet Daniel saw this is what John saw Isle of Patmos the things that they saw look kings and priests desire to see the things you see they prayed they saw them quite diligently seeking the manner of things which you have today the things we take for granted let me say that way sometimes we let this message sit on the shelf and collect dust we don't listen the tapes like we used to and we don't listen the prophets message like we used to and we don't seem to have the prayer life we used to have to and the things that we let sit idle the things that we let set collect dust or the things that they sought diligently for they leaned on their side and they fast and they were imprisoned and they suffered wanting to see the things we get to see some freely but what was it it wasn't the time for those things they were should've went to the time of the end that's why nature could come here in the book of Revelation and unseal the buck he can testify this book is open don't seal up the sayings of the prophecy of this book why pour the time is it hurting I want you to think about that as much as you could pray as much as you seek God you had no power to bring that vision to pass in your own strength but once it come to pass there was nothing you could do to stop it from happening but the RAM said if I knew that George Washington was gonna raise from the dead tomorrow he would call the world to see cuz it's not home ah huh help me out somebody there's not enough Devils in hell this stop it from coming to pass once God has given the vision he said what's that got to do with me I want you to think God saw you before the foundation Lord oh he saw people at the end time he saw a church without spot without blemish look he didn't see much you defeated people miss Elaina Dacia groping about trying to escape the wretchedness this robbery made a way of escape for you you're not be defeated today you're the victorious you're more than conquerors through him that loved you listen God saw things about you before you knew who you are we still don't know who we are like we ought to know it but one thing is for sure God knows who you are he knows exactly all about you he knows exactly where you come from you didn't come from from Ohio or from some country somewhere or some other state you come from God and you're going back to God he knows exactly all about it he knows exactly what he's called you to and when he placed you him had when he placed his seed in this end time he had all the confidence that it would fulfill his purpose his word does not go forth void and shall not return unto Him void it shall accomplish right here this morning in this building he shall accomplish his purpose in this place in real life because you're the children of God you're the seed of Abraham in Christ well praise the Lord look you have no power look you have no power to bring these things to pass on your home you can't make yourself a child of God you can't make yourself anointed you can't make you something Taurus but praise God he's already done that for you and listen if he is home ah if he has done that for you how could you stop it now listen it's enough devils and how to stop it what makes you think your mistakes would stop it what makes you think your family could stop it what makes you think your job can stop it what makes you think sickness can stop it look you can't stop it you you're savvy said I've done made a mistake I didn't fail God listen Paul said I'm persuaded there's no height or depth there's no width of breath there's no prints of pouty or power or men or angels nothing shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ that includes you yourself that include you listen you're your biggest enemy let's be honest now the devil's not your biggest enemy William Brown sir my biggest enemies William Branham I know some people didn't think William branham's their biggest enemy but he's not random you're your own biggest enemy your own unbelief and your own problems and your own faults and your past your failures that's all stuff on you that's stuff you brought to the table but praise God the blood of Jesus Christ it's greater than all your sin it's greater than the family you come out of it's greater than your past it's greater than what you did this morning because many times we start out in faith and man and after a while if we're not careful we get back into what we're trying to do for God Paul said having me on the spirity not made perfect in the flesh a man well praise the Lord listen many times if we're not careful we failed to see what God is doing hey man the prophet of God to see a vision I want to think about this talk about the vision being unsealed this Bible this book of Revelation for 1,900 years like overnight - 30 years it was a book of prophecy that was sealed this Bible had prophecies that were sealed but it was ordained at a certain time and that's the sayings of prophecy in this book the same one that John was told to seal was gonna be open hey man the same thing that was seen at one time now listen not only wasn't sealed I want you to think about this not only was it sealed he was told not to open it but in this time that is prophesied not only would be open you're not to shut it because listen when God opens the door no man can shut it whom God shuts a door no man can open it and many times we're guilty of trying to open doors that got a shot or many times we're trying to show her I was hoping trying to bring us our will to pass instead of his but listen you listen once it's once it's been told is that right once it's been foretold it has to come to pass so this book is a book of prophecy the book the first chapter tells you the same thing it's a book of prophecy is that right because there are certain seasons in the writing of itself there is a time that it testifies of that this would no longer be sealed I say what are you coming to you brother how would you know the hour how does a man supposed to know the hour when this is no longer sealed it's been sealed for thousands of years what pieces have to be in place for this to be open well the Bible tells you in this last chapter what was gonna happen praise the Lord the 16 verse tells you that Jesus was gonna send his angel to testify of the saint now I'm not seven angels like in at the beginning but one angel is going to testify of the things in the churches you think about a man like Martin Luther John Wesley the different messages they themselves didn't know who they were as I you know Martin Luther didn't sail upon the fifth church age messenger praise God look at me he didn't know his own hour there was an angel that was going to come and testify who this man was and who this person was of the church and the season and the time of it and he would show you the things that have happened in the churches amen praise the Lord think about that now he didn't I mean I don't get in trouble here but I want you to just think about this for a second he said I'm gonna send you an angel not angels not to not some seventh and an eighth messenger not some extra thing one angel sent to this time at the end time one angel in the hand of God is sent to testify the book is no longer closed it's open if you're gonna send him and testify under who under you who is you that's me present Lord some money I saw myself in the vision I'm part of it I caught the vision he was sent Elijah was sent to who on the air who is you that's me let me say that's me if you can receive it this is that Elijah that was to come look we've received in angels that I praise the Lord I'm getting ahead of myself here a little bit hey man but let's understand this angel was not Gabriel or one wormwood or something like that John saw this angel and I want you to think about the Ministry of this angel was so great John father worship the angel John hood walked with Christ and seen the gift and seen the power of Messiah when he saw this angel he fell to worship praise the Lord and yet what you say don't do is I'm a fellow servant I'm not above thy brethren the prophets homie how somebody this angel is not some cherubim somewhere this is his brother this is a man a prophet of his brethren said to him and what do the angel declare worship God in the midst of Satan's even when they're worshiping Satan ignorantly worship in the church worship in traditions and angels come to restore worship to God this is your prophet messenger has come to bring the people back to the worship of God to testify that the book is open I don't know who you think that is but let me tell you who I think it is because there ain't no two angels there was one angel set the prophesied sent to tell you the seals are open will you man better them you see have you know the time is at hand and God sent an angel to you they testified this is the time for these things it's not for another day it's not for next week it's right now praise the Lord God sent his angel under John is half of the rod God sent a messenger then announced the book is open hey man that's why I could say we've been handed an open book we know that from the book of the revelation the tenth chapter the book is no longer sealed and I think it's interesting because the angel the same angel that testifies a book is open and not sealed you have things the people now don't seal up the sayings of the prophecy this book in other words there's gonna be a people that said now that book still closed we don't need to hear those things we're waiting for another age we're waiting for somebody else to come and finish doing that but listen they ancient and open the book Christ up from the books angels just testified it's already open only one angel was promised to tell you about the opening of it and now let me say this in the day and age where people trying to tell you that this book is still sealed let me tell you this she'll not the sayings of the prophecy of this book why because they are faithful and they are true many people say many things about this message but let me testify to you this morning the sayings of His Prophet and the sayings of must set the Lord that we've got on tape today they are faithful and they're true cuz listen it's not just you not the book you said not the sayings of this book why is that probably as God neither had tape recorders nowadays that's why it's the sayings it's the spoken word that was just spoken by the Prophet Malachi far don't see it a lot the sayings of the prophecy of this book think about that and haha probably says this and the rising of the Sun you alright this morning I tell you what I'm feeling pretty good already I feel like I've been caught up I feel like I used to live in North Nash me up it's like I tell you what Shh you're ever flying a plane I'm done that till a few years ago when I started traveling abroad man I tell you what I never thought I'd fly like that that seemed like something other people will do cuz I just a hillbilly just a nobody but now I float in the air and you get up love them clouds and things things on this earth seems so small some insignificant mean you can't even see past the clouds at the time it seems so insignificant at that height Amen I just feel this one just to tell you I've got caught in such a place with the trials that I used to have my life and the things that used to bother me and the things that used to play me they seem so insignificant from where I'm sitting now you say what do you mean brother I was in the power of art you someone and then I was there at one point but somebody translated me the book of Colossians says he translated you out of the power of darkness in the kingdom of his dear son here who are dead in sins and trespasses yet he hath quickened look he didn't just catch you up and put you just a little bit about the devil but you have to look down hey man he has made you to sit with him and then was he sitting today he has made you to sit with him in heavenly places in Christ Jesus but God just happened to believe today that you were seated far above all principality and power and might and Dominion today no reason you ever notice it's because you look down hey man so looking at the author and finisher your faith so look at what the word has said many times we look at circumstances and trials and we look at those things and we miss what God is doing amen but you've been quickened praise the Lord brother Brent says this and the rising of the Sun he says that quickening power has come to us to open the seals listen now it has come not that it's gonna come someday we're waiting for something to happen waiting for some revival but he says Queenie power has come to open the seven seals what was that the intelligence of a man no the quickening power of God sea quickening power God foretold this would take place sea quickening power God made the world testify of it it's the truth the aims of the Lord I've told you was around in a pillar fire quickening power let the world know that's the truth he's talked about the cloud there in 1963 he said in that they didn't know what it was I still don't know let's start you know what was all that they're trying to tell you what it wasn't they don't even know but we know we know he said this he said and we knew just look at this way it's our Lord up there you see he was the one who opened the seals he is those hills for the whole Word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what was the opening of the seals then revealing Christ let me say this of an angel has come that means the book is open and if a book is open that he's quittin power has also come and then you came escaping they all go hand in hand clicking power open the word and what you do it revealed Christ where was he revealed in his word where was he revealed in his word and his people he's revealing you not just something I ain't gonna paint somewhere he's revealing you written moving epistles writing none of old man you're like prison or somebody your life is a testimony that here's the same he has done things in your life that you could not do he's brought things to pass your life you could not bring the past see you have no power to fulfill but quickening power is coming to your life bringing powers touch you quickly power dwells in you that's what heals your body when you sick that's what gives you joy in the midst of trials quickening power has come to you what I'm not waiting on it I'm not looking for it I've brought it with me to church this morning [Applause] and I pray the office he was that with me when you come in the building he comes the building with you I just want to encourage you when you leave this building today he wants to go yeah you don't have to leave them in this building he's got a temple made without hands oh my creeping power made the whole world whole world testify of it testify what the book is not sealed it's open is that right my my listen listen thing once you see it for yourself this is one thing for me to tell you that the world testified of it but they don't understand why cuz it hasn't been revealed to them what it's about why because they're not part of it then they're not part of the vision that's why does it pertain to him but there's a people here that are part of the vision yeah listen once you see yourself in it and it's been revealed to you that these sayings let me say this let me say how prophets in it once you recognize the word for your day to be Eagles food you've heard from you the Alpha D you've recognized something that not even isn't recognized why cuz you've got a feel ffunny let's hang in there speaking to you about the word of life we've got representation in a place where they don't have representation now listen I don't know how you feel about it but I believe in a theophany I believe it's real I believe it's present right in the house I believe it exists now and I believe you've spoken to me I believe I've heard from a theophany and that's why I'm sitting here today that's why you're sitting here today that's why you can please go out today you've heard from something that's real you can't see with your natural eyes you can't hit with your not sure but you've got another sense on the inside of that soul you've got a representation from God listen you can't stop you can't stop the power of God listen if if you are a part of God's plan and you're part of God's purpose if God said you go to the rapture there's not enough Devils in hell there's not enough brothers and sisters that don't like your church enough angry bosses are bad co-workers or family members to stop you from going to it she Satan knows Satan knows he cannot stop the power of y'all in your life he knows that what he can do he can do one thing he can hinder the channel of Revelation in your life think about that now he can do that he can hinder the channel revelation her life when I'm talking I don't have the quote in front of me but he talks about Christ the mystery how will let our family will let our job or wife or husband we let so many things keep the revelation from us none of us here we things we let the cares of life come up and keep revelation look God is trying to give you revelation whatever you're going through this morning whatever your situation is in your life the answer to your problem and the answer to your needs is a greater revelation of what God has already done for you there's nothing he can do for you this morning that he hasn't already done every man calling every word he's ever testify to you every thought he's ever had in you he had before there's one speck of dust before there was a star in the sky before you troubled before your trials before everything you went through in your life he had a thought about you and that thought is going to come to pass and the question today it's not is the thought true that's not the problem the questions do we know what the thought is do we know what God has said about us or we're more we worried about what somebody else has said about us many times weeks on our own opinion even you say not me I'm not arrogant like that oh really what about well I'm no good God don't love me and he loves these people more than mean and God can't do that for me that's just as arrogant as saying you're somebody better everybody else that's just as arrogant who God has said something about you he said you're holy he said you're bladeless he said you're accepted in the beloved he's not call you up and weakness and doubt they call you to give you power and courage and ability Godin cost the backup on Devils he calls to cast him out many times women many times we make room for him we'll get a little guest bed for him in a house or we'll make a place for him you think of the maniac he Portland brother REM dealt with when he cast the spirit on that great big man that was gonna crush him and the police officer asked him is he gonna be all right he said no to come back because he loves that devil many times we love on Devil's we don't realize because we give pet names like depression and anxiety and diabetes and sickness well I was just born with this I'm just I just made this way yeah but you're born again look that power that first birth has no power over the believer they've been circumcised are separated from the flesh that's not who you are anymore in fact it's never who you were in the first place how much you think about this when God speaks when God opened this book he'd give it a voice hey man when God opened the book of your life he'd give you a voice think about that you were the voice of God to this age the spirit and the body say something they're saying this having the final messenger said they're same comes all right you've got a voice oh my somebody help me out here I just know I don't even know how to convey death and life are in the power of your tongue not just bent on your tongue your tongue has the power of life and death in it and the things you say about your own life can defeat you amen listen you'll never rise above your own confession so what it comes down to you never rise above your own confession you've got to confess if you believe this book is open if you believe this is the time for it if you believe that quickening powers come then you've got to confess that it's for me the seals have been open to me quickening powers come to me listen has got to be for a person many times we read these things we look at these things we know they're true but we're not careful to acknowledge that true for us that's why we should catch the vision of it today because the vision has been presented whether you like it or not whether you believe it or not the seals are open the word has come the word has been open the power of God is here whether you like it or not the question is what will you do with this Christ what are you gonna do with it I tell you why there's a time this is that right the Bible says here in the book of Acts the Apostle Peter prophesied to the people there in the book of Acts the 3rd chapter he says repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord and he shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began he's gonna send Jesus to somebody he didn't come to them he's gonna come to somebody he's gonna come at the time of the restitution of all things praise the Lord I want to look at this word for a moment here this time as the Bible says here in the nineteenth verse the times of refreshing you know what that word refreshing it's a Greek it's a it's a Greek word annex obsess I think is how you say it I'm not a Greek scholar but it's an exception it means a revival what it literally means is the recovery of breath in other words you resuscitate somebody they start breathing if they were dying listen God took the people that were dead in sins and trespasses and he'd give them revival listen this is not a national revival but it's a bride's revival it's for you why because the power has come so you're either looking for a revival or you've got a revival you've got a recovery of breath think about that now breath has come in the you look at the book the Hebrew word for breath or spirits the same with a rock it means the breath when when God breathed anatomy breathed the breath of life or the action of the breath of lives is how it is in the Hebrew but the breath of life into him and he became a living soul but we've received an atom that last time a quickening or a life-giving or a reviving spirit hey man you think of a zq brother then he just touches on this in Christ the mystery a little bit but you think about Ezekiel in the bath of the dry bones when it come to the valley of the dry bones he saw he saw death everywhere he's so confusion that there was nothing there that was together and yet that prophet he prophesied God asking the question can these bones live he said Lord you know we said God you know and God give him something said I want you to prophesy over these dry bones that they would come together and God begin to form bodies an invincible armor he he put him out of the Methodist he pulled on the back test of the Pentecostal he put a lot of bootleggers joints and and back alleys and drug addiction and and sin and darkness and what did he do he form the body heaven he craved himself a body and army and it stood upright on its feet so we're not laying down today we're standing upright and it's been a symbol by the power of prophecy look your life from the very time before you even born your life was guided by prophecy your ancestors survived death and darkness because they were guided but prophesy over your life and you've come to place a prophet is prophesied and assembled a body but listen Redemption is two parts there's a going on to coming in hey man he has assembled a body but it was necessary that he would prophesy again why for an annex oopss for the recovery of breath to enter into the body I believe Jones told the prophesy again for a reason I knew that's why we're here this morning we're hearing the same word of life that was spoken 40 years ago 50 years ago been prophesied right now oh he's brought you from places he's cognitive darkness but now life is coming into the body what is it doing quickening the body what for for the changing of a body listen you've not been called hallelujah to be defeated you've been called for a rapture how's the rapture gonna come to pass a quickening power he's gonna take this vile body and change into a body lacking in his own the scripture says now listen there's three parts that go with that that rapture what's that first part there's a shout what did it do the same thing as Eagles dry bones did it call the people to a rapture I believe it's going on right now the world has an idea about the rapture they didn't get ideas about they make fun where's the promise of his coming not realizing he's here it was taking place they're looking for planes to fall on the sky her earthquakes are blood moons but I've received my last sign the Angels testified to me the book is open the time is at hand I don't need some sort of job some divinity or whatever this the divination are all this other nonsense I've received my last sign I'm not looking for it he came to me he came to me I couldn't find him so he sent me Elijah why the recover breath they give a life to revive me out of blackness why because he's ordained that his people in this hour would be an invincible army now if you're an invincible army that means there's nothing that can defeat you I wonder so many times why we live in defeat we're not called to it you know I don't like to give the double credit but I'll say one thing he's a good adversary you know he knows he's going to lose because the book of his lives and his time has also been in Ceylon he's a bluff he's a liar he's defeated he can't touch you he can't do anything new without God's permission he is defeated he's the biggest loser in all creation and yet every day he fights you like you're losing the biggest loser that's ever been and he fights like a winner to the end and here we are ordained a victory ordained to glory or didn't rain with him and we can discouraged by little things listen you be called to something greater you've not been ordained than the wrath but our salvation by Jesus Christ let's start acting like we got victory let's fight like we're winning let's press this battle look you don't even have to win Christ either victory it's time to get up your loins like a mat hand and start fighting the devil but let them push you around and bully in your home so I'll take your children I'll I'll do some of them no devil I got a token I'm gonna take your house I'm gonna I'm gonna take your help from you and I'll flicked you you can't serve God no devil by his straps I'm already healed look the Bible says resist the devil he will flee from you that's why he bothers some of you so much you just need to tell them what's what well so Jesus did well if your son God if your daughter God do this do that get behind me Satan it is written of me look we know is written about Christ what's written about him let the devil know where you are look when he defeated Satan he defeat him with the Word of God the same word that you got in front of you this morning three times he defeated Satan with us saith the Lord and this bride she has thus saith the Lord and she knows what God wants double head hey man I want to encourage you this morning be defeated I gotta sent you a message for a reason he has sent you revival and listen just Jesus testified with this with this angel when he comes in this last chapter here he said surely I come quickly now you think about that Peter talked about there'd be scoffers in the last days like I was just talkin my mama go they say where's the promise of his coming he understood there was a time coming where they would make fun of the coming of the Lord say well all things have continued as they DAP since the fathers began well he said he was coming quickly that was almost 2000 years ago your God has a funny sense of time ah but see that's not what God said he didn't say at the beginning the book I'm coming quickly I'm gonna let that sink for just a second there he man he says in this last chapter three times he says behold I come quickly when is he coming quickly not in the Ephesian age that's Smyrna a man not these other ages but when this angel comes and the book is open he says now I'm coming quickly the mighty angels lift up his heads at time shall be no more in other words there will be no more delay so there was a delay in the church ages but in that breech in this time in the end that's when he comes he says now I come quickly surely behold now I come quickly I want you understand the promise of his coming when he said I'm coming quickly what's not for Daniels age it wasn't for John's age it wasn't even for Wesley's age it was for this bride at this time you're the ones he's coming quickly to her that's why I said he cut the work the work short he said that he was short in the days let's no flesh would be saved listen you're you're in a good time to be a Christian this is the most glorious hour for you to be a Christian because this is the time of his company you say how do you know the angel told me my Eliezer told me that my Isaac's just over the next hill this is the time of it praise the Lord somebody a book of ezekiel here in the 12th chapter verse 21 this is in the word lord came to me saying son of man and what is that proverb that they have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision Fairless notice they had a proverb oh god don't bring things to pass that's what they said about God in them days he says tell them therefore I want to tell the devil this morning thus said the Lord I will make this proverb decease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel but saying in the days are at hand and the effect of every vision notice the effect of a vision is coming to pass because now the time is at hand and they might make fun today they might say things about you today but I want you understand and as Louis maybe three and a half years you'll be sitting on the other side of this just think of if the law were to translate in the next 40 days from today I'm just three and a half years time you'll be raining it's kings and priests on the earth well actually you do that now if you understand that your spiritual kings of the spiritual dominion you're now kings and priests unto God look God is not ordained to be the tail but the head that arises the Bible says you're not the tail you're not the defeated you're not the weak when you're not the slave you're the ruler you're the master you're the King you're a priest over the powers of darkness hey man listen the Bible says God is not slack and some men count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward him look I think God he didn't come back in that day I wouldn't be here God is long-suffering and many times we get impatient we wonder what is God doing God still saving maybe you got lost loved ones God still saving God still has mercy you say I've gone through things I wish I could just go home maybe God has a purpose for you being here but let me testify he's still a healer he's still deliverer our God's not changed his arms not latched short that it cannot say his ears not growing heavy that it cannot hear he's the same he's the Lord God he changes not mom listen many people when they think that God is d this is the thing many people may think God is linked they begin to delay amen I was talking to brother about this in Africa a few years back he was saying I really liked it he said procrastination is the thief of time procrastination many times we procrastinate because we think my Lord dr. Lilly is coming remember the story of the wicked and slothful servant he said my Lords delayed is coming he didn't realize his Lord was coming and so he began to beat the other servants and become drunken notice what happens to a man that loses his vision for the coming of the Lord he falls into worldliness and drunkenness and malice Shh and what it's done it's stolen from us our brother Matt talks about being dilatory being billet Orry procrastinating hasn't been ever we have any procrastinators in here I hope not huh yes and last because somebody knows some procrastinators well I used to be real bad about it used to be hopefully not anymore amen well I'll get this thing hung up honey don't worry six months later I'm trying to figure I'm gonna hang this thing up well you know how that goes many times we make plans and we don't know what we're gonna do tomorrow let alone six months little year from now but one thing is sure the coming of the Lord is here our Lord has spoken he's declared a shop now's not the time to mastodons God because it will steal your spiritual life it's still your joy yes to your victory and you'll sit there waiting for God to do something when God's already done something for you and you've missed it my balance isn't a third axis when they're in the Loess they were waiting on God and the Prophet said God was waiting on them I just I just kind of think maybe this morning God's waiting on some lot still to grow up and show up and be sons and daughters of God like we were called to be and quit playing games in church and quite waiting for God to push us through a pot when God is already declared things about you and the visions already been open to you let's not play games let's not sit on God this morning let's give God everything we've got ain't got much to offer a little but I've got a lot I'm gonna will I have a heart to serve you I'm not able to do it but I want to God help me listen that's God that does that is God that worketh in you too willing to do his good pleasure God is doing something for you if you let him don't miss it don't put it off till next well I'll get right with God next week well I've got some serious things going on my home I'm kind of busy I'll pray about it next week yeah and then you'll do it the next week and there'll be another week and before you know you'll be further away from God than you've ever been just the time the first got saved right before you got saved and you get so Batson so : God because you put off well lord help us all but the RAM says this second coming of the Lord he said it was such a great thing to John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos when he saw the preview of the coming of the Lord when he saw the curses that rested upon the unbeliever and the blesses blessings that rested upon the believer he screamed out even so come Lord Jesus it's so thrilled as hard after all he had seen the events before his coming he screamed even so come Lord Jesus and when the whole church had just passed and his view and he's seen everything a major the way it would happen then the scream come Lord Jesus now listen he saw them in the preview but you got a profit tell you about them in Heinz life he's told you all about the church changes this is when John saw he rejoiced when John saw the comer he cried out even so come Lord Jesus if he did that for a man on X Ahom Patmos what on it to do to us this morning he said it must be a glorious thing that the coming Lord the coming Lord draws in their hand my my what does it do to us this morning amen here's why when I come to you with this but the BAM seen another vision one time he's seen a vision of a preview of the bride he's seen Church ages I believe he's seen Adam and Eve in the garden it seen all these things but one day he saw a preview of a bride and she'd been marching they begin to see the last stage he begin to see the churches of America naked walking through walking through the preview and these other churches and at the very end when he became to despair listen I understand being discouraged by the things that happened in the news and the things that happen around us it's very understandable but he saw something else he saw you he saw a bride coming to preview marching to the same beat they did at the beginning we won who's all my working man was all my labor her when you were in your life have I done anything from God does not even care cannot even do anything with me it's my labor in vain God is not forgetful of your labor of love don't be weary in well-doing today God does not forget that was a bride that was coming to preview and seeping into your stuff a little bit and what did you do Clare get back in line get back and step listen this morning I want you understand if you're not where you need to be you can get back in line this bride is still marching there's still mercy for you there's stop blessing for you here today listen what we need today is not just to be more gifted or have a bigger Bank be more popular at work what we need today is overcoming power and let me say this way what you need is perfect love that's the capstone that's the dynamic because perfect love's the only thing it'll get there that's the only thing that is there my life ah that's why I want to be here where it's always always perfect love then people over there I believe I was one of them how many over there they saw a profit they heard a promise speak to them he asked him he said what will I be judged he says yes everybody will be judged was Paul judges pulse we were judged he said then I'll be fine because I preach for Paul preach and the people there they declared we're resting on that now let me say this to you who my face conservation will you be brother my faith called the vision when those people there spoke I was one of them I was with them I don't just see a bunch of faces people standing round by the brown I see their faces right now maybe they look a little older maybe a little younger then they'll look over there but I'm looking at their faces right now we should allow them and we declared we believe the Hat we're resting on that we can testify the county right but that's nothing but the truth listen if she can testify that I don't believe that was just for her I believe this for us today this word these sayings they're faithful and they're true that's nothing but the truth and when you believe that word and you confess a lots of power a power that's been sealed through churches but it's now unleashed upon the people of God your faith has to catch the vision see maybe you're sick and body this morning you say well I'm sick you're not sick the Bible says you're healed you're not a sick person that's trying to get well you're a well person the devil is trying to make sick hey man what you need you to see yourself well and start walking towards the vision imagine yourself well and then walk into him don't look at yourself defeated don't look at yourself in a hospital don't look at yourself on medication and sick and bound for the rest of your life look at yourself well and then walk into it you say this is my imagination no it's more to it than that listen a man can be condemned for his imagination your imagination is part of experiment that's more powerful than you think of the man can be condemned for adultery in his imagination Jesus said you look at the end of the living world their imaginations were continually evil and he destroyed a generation part but listen if God would do that to those untoward ungodly people what am I in if your faith casters a vision you can walk in to wellness you can walk in to the power of God you have to see yourself well and then you walk into it walk into a whole person no brother brand me tells the story I love the story tells many probably not but he was talking about there's a ship one time they're on this thing they were seeing and there's a bad storm and he said the captain's name was John quartz he got real sick you know the story he got sick one night and he was down below and a boy come to visit him the boy was a Christian his name was Willie Pruitt and he come to visit the captain he said I want to read some scripture T and he begin to read to the man and he was sick and as he's reading to this man he come to the plates in Isaiah the 53rd chapter where it testifies he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed now listen that captain he didn't cause the vision you have you ain't caught the vision yeah he said well that sounds really good and the well it person can I read it to you where my momma used to read it to me back home yeah that'd be fine he was wounded for Willie's transgressions he was bruised for Willie's peace the chatter that bruised for our iniquities and that's harder to do when you're not looking at it the testing has Willy's pieces upon them and well his stripes really is healed now some because the stern Captain John Court says do you think I could put my name in there see it's great when will these names in the book it's great when somebody else names the book who what about you burnings some begin to stir she cannot do that you loo you read that with my name he was wounded for John's transgressions he was bruised for John's iniquities the chastisement of John's peace was upon him and with His stripes John quartz is healed he's happy gonna feel some sweet balmy and that captain was healed that very hour in that cabin brother ray he was wounded for your transgressions Hamas Nehemiah he was wounded for your iniquities how I can say the chasm of my peace was upon him with the stripes Alexander McGrew this is healed but hey when you catch the vision you can put your name in there that's why I testify by this angel the angel come to let you know your names on the box that's how you heard from your theophany what is the name in the book brother Branham said not some not our natural names but the mystery of who it is it's the revelation of Christ in you so if you're part of that mystery your name is in the back well let me just put your name anywhere come on think about that middleman sent when you become a Christian and you come to the Falls of Christ you get a checkbook and that checkbook is signed on the bottom by Jesus Christ on every page and all you have to do for any redemptive promise let's just fill it out house because the name is already on the bottom he said brother I thought you said to put your name I did that's what's his name is there cuz his name is your name somebody missed that one his name is your name your names already at the bottom of the church and listen if the Prophet said that Golub bankrupt heaven to keep his promises if he had to everything that you have beat up today your name is already in the book it's already on the checkbook I fasted B was filling out and hand it in praise the Lord all right quote do you hear this more I'm getting ready to wrap up with this I want to read this quote where the RAM says this and come let us reason together 1955 he said there's a man sitting right over there from you what's the hardening of the arteries he wants to get well - he thinks that God would heal them don't you sir this might be speaking somebody here this morning don't just put on that man put your name in there he says he thinks that God would heal him don't you sir you believe that he did it then I want to ask you something just when I was talking to this woman he says she missed her healing and it went over to you just then in Sovereign Grace when it went over to you a real strange feeling swept over you didn't it now think about this so there's a woman there and her healing passed right by and went to him Shh he said see you wondered why that woman didn't raise up didn't you know many times we wonder why see she missed it because the angel was leaving her and going to you isn't that right he said if it is wave your hand real funny feeling he says that's right it ended with you brother your faith got the vision you see how do I catch a vision well it's not with a butterfly net it's not with a bear trap your faith has to catch the vision now I want you understand right now as I'm getting ready to close here right now there's radio shows going through this room is that right the Rebbe talks about that there's another dimension here there's television programs going right from this room and police reports and calls and phone calls and cell phones people talking about one another maybe the football game or something else it's all going through here right now but see you can't catch it because you don't have the right kind of a receiver for it but I want you to understand in another dimension above that there's a power that is present the king of God is here the angels of God are going through here right now if you need healing your healings you want do here right now if you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you need if you need a real baptism of the Holy Ghost if you need joy if you need peace the Prince of Peace is here right now the question is not whether he's here the questions can your face get the vision I want matter with my many people down the street it might be going by something in this room right now but don't let it go by you your faith has a receiver you can get the vision oh my it amazes me it astounds me how many people they'll fight their way through the week they'll fight you difficulty they'll fight through financial trouble they'll fight through sickness they'll fight through family problems and work and they'll fight their way they'll fight through the snooze button on Sunday morning to get to church they'll fight through every obstacle and they'll show up at the house of God I think God for that and they'll come to the house of God and God will begin to move and God began to brood over his people and they miss it and they go home well that was a good service he talked about the power of God to heal the power better deliver and they walk out with the same burden they brought in why they missed what was God was doing their faith didn't reach quite high enough but I would encourage you this one if you're believing people you've got the faith listen you've got faith you don't even know about the questions are you willing to reach up and cast the vision I think about the woman with the blood issue I preached about her years ago brother Ram talks about her as well and the different lace in the Bible then where the blood is she she had a punishing for 12 years the Bible tells us she's been to doctors and she spent every dime she had there Oliver substance now I want you to think about this woman for a second consider what this woman was going through because we we read that 12 years like a footnote in the book and we go right on but what you think about a woman that unclean for twelve years if she had family if she had loved ones for 12 years she had to live away from them being unclean she wasn't even supposed to be in the crowd of people I don't know maybe she'd been a mother maybe she had children before the Shanta issue and think about not being able to hold your child for 12 years not being able to cook supper for your husband for 12 years not being able to be a part of your family for 12 years because of an uncleanness in your life and suffering year after year after year maybe selling everything you had just to get some help from a doctor and doctors in there like a lot of doctors today that take you for every dime whether you get better in a hot here she suffered and gone through things and she sees Jesus and Jesus passing by and she gets down on her knees and she begins to crawl through mothers and much admire and through the feet the feet of different people just to get to Jesus and what a shame if she'd got all the way Jesus said well I got to see him today I guess I'll go home you're this close now's the time to grab you can just grab the hem of his garment you say well I wish the Prophet were here while we're sewing so we're here all you've got to do is grab the hem of his garment and you can be main hall don't let them pass you by if you've got to crawl if you've got to find you did to Jesus he's here enough you can catch the vision let's stand to our feet hold don't let him pass you by now I believe he's still the same I know he's still the same I've seen him do the same things he's always done we have a witness of the resurrection not just on tapes been in our lives you got a need today I want to encourage you to reach out right now sing that song I think it's maybe gee reach out and touch the Lord I want to do that right now I know there's needs here cuz I got needs if you don't got anything I do we're needy people many are the afflictions of the righteous but there's one here today he said he would deliver you out of them all if you just reach out now don't miss what's taking place you say I believe this message that's good that means your faith caught the vision if it can catch that you can see a rapture if you can hear the shout he'll give you every blessing he's giving you all things that pertain to life and godliness do you believe that this morning
