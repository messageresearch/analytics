[38:24] a moment you know
[38:25] just just to step aside
[38:28] just to be encouraged in the things of
[38:29] the lord tonight i want to just look
[38:32] here in matthew chapter 6
[38:35] and i want to just continue to look
[38:37] at prayer at the thought that we were
[38:39] looking at and we've been
[38:41] dealing with some things as the lord has
[38:43] been just
[38:45] directing us in some of the sunday
[38:47] services as well
[38:49] but i want to just
[38:51] go here tonight back into that same
[38:53] thought on prayer is
[38:55] prayer is
[38:58] in matthew chapter 6 verse 5
[39:05] hear the lord jesus it says when thou
[39:07] prayest
[39:09] thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are
[39:12] for they love to pray standing
[39:15] in the synagogues and in the corners of
[39:17] the streets
[39:19] that they may be seen of men
[39:21] verily i say unto you they have their
[39:23] reward
[39:24] but thou
[39:25] when thou prayest enter into thy closet
[39:29] when thou has shut thy door
[39:32] pray to thy father which is in secret
[39:35] thy father which seeth in secret
[39:38] shall reward thee
[39:40] openly
[39:42] i'd like to just read that verse again
[39:45] when thou prayest
[39:48] enter into thy closet
[39:50] and when thou has shut the door
[39:53] pray to the father which is in secret
[39:56] thy father which seeth in secret shall
[39:58] reward thee
[40:02] bless the reading of the word as you're
[40:04] being seated tonight
[40:07] i want to read hero
[40:12] from a quote of the message of blind
[40:14] bartimaeus
[40:17] and we
[40:19] just to
[40:20] lay this a little background of things
[40:23] that we'll kind of look at here tonight
[40:25] graham said you know there's something
[40:27] about getting along to yourself
[40:30] many people never pray until they come
[40:32] to church
[40:34] many people think that's the only place
[40:36] to pray is a church
[40:39] the bible said for men to pray
[40:41] everywhere
[40:42] lifting up holy hands
[40:45] then when we get by ourselves we'll
[40:47] usually pray different than when we
[40:49] would if we prayed in the church it's
[40:52] the secret prayer that jesus spoke of
[40:54] saying
[40:55] enter ye into a secret closet and close
[40:58] the door
[41:00] when you have did so pray to your father
[41:02] who sees in secret
[41:04] he that seeth in secret shall reward the
[41:06] opening
[41:08] and when we're praying like that there
[41:10] seems to be something to the prayer that
[41:12] takes all the hypocrisy out of it
[41:15] it seems like that we get in a better
[41:17] connection with god to get along
[41:20] there's been many times in my life as
[41:23] perhaps in your life that you just have
[41:25] to get alone once in a while with jesus
[41:28] now let me just pause here a moment in
[41:30] just reading this
[41:33] we realize and i that as we have
[41:36] made a statement and we experienced this
[41:38] there's times that i can tell you of
[41:40] just just whether i've come out of the
[41:43] presence of the law just been studying
[41:45] things sometimes it just it's just
[41:47] things you just begin to meditate on
[41:50] and it doesn't matter where i'm at
[41:52] i had him visit me
[41:54] and you have to i trust whether you've
[41:57] been right in the store maybe you've
[41:58] been on the job and his presence will
[42:01] come to your life and it just overwhelms
[42:03] you
[42:04] that's a moment between you and the lord
[42:07] because i want you to see this here here
[42:10] when we look at this that
[42:12] it's it's even in those times those are
[42:15] precious times and those times are
[42:17] they they don't take away from the times
[42:20] of us getting alone where
[42:22] we have to make a decision and get a
[42:25] loan just as much as those times where
[42:28] we have to meditate on the things of god
[42:30] and i don't want to say the words have
[42:32] to but to recognize the privilege it is
[42:35] to meditate on the things of god as a
[42:37] matter of fact god some of the very
[42:39] instructions that he gave to joshua in
[42:41] the opening chapter was to meditate on
[42:45] those things
[42:46] and you know meditation is part of
[42:48] prayer as well
[42:49] meditation is part we're taking the word
[42:52] you begin to think on that word and
[42:54] brother bran tells us and we're
[42:55] witnesses of that i am and i know you
[42:58] are as well where the presence of god
[43:00] will just sweep by our life and it's
[43:02] just something so precious about that in
[43:05] meditating on the things of god how god
[43:07] will come by and he'll open things to
[43:10] our life and we know that in this time
[43:12] that you and i are in that satan has
[43:15] every ploy and every trap of everything
[43:18] that he can do to try to ensnare our
[43:21] meditation or in other words have our
[43:24] minds so occupied upon other things
[43:27] because he knows the power of that of
[43:30] meditation in the things of god
[43:34] and i want to just say it in this manner
[43:36] that as we're looking at this in prayer
[43:38] brother branham made this statement and
[43:40] let me reread that he says it seems like
[43:42] that we get in a better connection with
[43:44] god to get alone and there's many times
[43:46] in my life as perhaps in your life that
[43:49] you just have to get alone once in a
[43:51] while with jesus i took my car and drove
[43:54] down the road and just studying and
[43:56] after i got to the highway where it was
[43:58] free or off on some country road till i
[44:01] would become so filled with his mercies
[44:04] and goodness until i i just stopped the
[44:06] car and held the will and wept like a
[44:09] baby
[44:10] he said that's being alone many times
[44:12] i've climbed up in the mountains where
[44:14] every man thought
[44:15] everyone that was with me that i was
[44:17] going hunting i'd go up there and sit
[44:19] down on a rock and just look up to the
[44:21] sky until looked like that my whole
[44:24] innermost being
[44:26] become filled with something that you
[44:28] could just feel everything of the world
[44:31] seemed to pass away for those precious
[44:34] hours along with god
[44:36] and it's there that when the great
[44:38] revelation and inspiration comes is when
[44:41] we're alone with god
[44:43] we take more time on that i'm sure that
[44:46] we live a better life and more
[44:48] victorious life in christ
[44:52] if you've been filled with the spirit of
[44:54] god you have received of the victory of
[44:56] calvary
[44:58] you've received of the victory of the
[45:00] resurrection
[45:02] there's been a triumphing in our life we
[45:04] have experienced of that same life of
[45:06] the mighty conqueror manifesting himself
[45:09] in our life above every sin above
[45:12] unbelief to where our lives have been
[45:14] illuminated by his victory and our lives
[45:18] daily express his victory we were people
[45:21] who were once bound but we've been set
[45:24] free
[45:25] we've been delivered because it wasn't
[45:27] my victory it's accepting that victory
[45:30] and that victory has come to me and
[45:33] brought me into that victory
[45:37] but then to think that the privilege now
[45:40] what's afforded to you and i
[45:42] is that our lives
[45:44] can be
[45:45] lived in such a victorious way if we
[45:48] just have these times alone with god all
[45:51] right see this is why when you begin to
[45:53] realize why the devil will battle
[45:55] everything
[45:57] right he'll battle prayer the most
[46:01] i hope you hope you're with me now i'm
[46:02] going to go to some places here tonight
[46:05] it's not that it's not that he he he he
[46:08] minds about you reading the word but
[46:11] he'll battle you most when it comes to
[46:14] prayer
[46:16] that's where he sets his targets that's
[46:18] where he sets his guns
[46:20] now i want you to think of this
[46:21] scripture if we can if i read that
[46:23] scripture once again in matthew chapter
[46:25] 6 and verse 6 when thou prayest enter
[46:29] into this is now the responsibility this
[46:32] comes to the worshipper for you and i to
[46:35] enter that means to enter means we leave
[46:38] one and go into another
[46:40] we're leaving one place and going into
[46:42] another now let me just say
[46:44] to enter in and then to close notice
[46:47] shut the door this comes to you and i
[46:50] and sometimes the place of trying to
[46:52] enter in and close the door sometimes
[46:55] your we have so many thoughts about us
[46:57] so many things going on around in our
[46:59] life but the very thing that we have
[47:02] need of to make sense of everything else
[47:05] and deal with everything in life is to
[47:08] enter in into prayer amen
[47:10] amen
[47:12] is to enter in and shut the door
[47:15] god won't enter in for us
[47:17] god won't shut the door for us we have
[47:20] to do that
[47:22] and notice pray to the father which is
[47:24] in secret
[47:26] showing that you and i have a privilege
[47:29] by an access to come into his presence
[47:32] let me say this to you tonight as as
[47:35] believers of this end time message that
[47:38] have been born of the spirit of god to
[47:40] recognize of what this message has
[47:43] brought you and i too to a place of
[47:45] access before the throne of almighty god
[47:48] that you and i might come with boldness
[47:50] it's because of the redeeming work of
[47:53] the blood of the lamb that deals with
[47:56] sin in our life it deals with
[47:58] condemnation it takes away all the
[48:01] things that are between us and god to
[48:05] bring us back into fellowship with god
[48:07] once again
[48:09] that's the privilege we have
[48:11] amen in the presence of almighty god
[48:13] that we can stand there in his presence
[48:16] with a real confidence
[48:20] oh my
[48:22] so to enter in
[48:23] it's to go into it's to shut it's to
[48:26] close check and shut things off to close
[48:28] it off
[48:29] once you think how paul would write this
[48:32] many places we could speak about
[48:34] this access that we have but i'm just
[48:36] going to read a few places brother
[48:38] bradley or paul tells us in romans 5 1
[48:41] therefore being justified by faith we
[48:44] have peace with god through our lord
[48:46] jesus christ
[48:48] by whom also we have access by faith
[48:53] into this grace wherein we stand and
[48:56] rejoice in hope of the glory of god so
[48:59] it is by the lord jesus christ it is by
[49:03] the holy spirit it is by the word that
[49:06] we have access unto god
[49:10] amen now notice as it writes in song of
[49:13] solomon chapter 2 verse 14. here is the
[49:16] bridegroom speaking to the bride amen oh
[49:20] my god
[49:21] that first part right there
[49:23] it speaks of a confidence an
[49:26] undefiledness a blamelessness oh my god
[49:30] he's seeing his own life reflected in
[49:33] the bride
[49:35] oh my dove
[49:37] thou art in the class of the rock the
[49:39] secret places of the stairs stairs speak
[49:43] of access
[49:45] this dove has access into the presence
[49:49] of almighty god
[49:51] privileges that you and i
[49:53] have been afforded
[49:55] by almighty god amen notice
[49:58] let me see thy countenance
[50:01] let me hear thy voice
[50:03] so first he wants to look upon our
[50:06] countenance our person our face you know
[50:09] why because it's been his very
[50:12] countenance his very person that has
[50:15] brought a change in our countenance
[50:18] he wants to behold himself so don't be
[50:20] in a hurry let me just let me just look
[50:24] on you amen let me see your accountant
[50:27] don't don't get in such a hurry
[50:29] let me see your countenance
[50:32] and then let me hear your voice
[50:35] oh my gosh let me hear you that voice
[50:38] for sweet is thy voice and thy
[50:40] countenance is come
[50:43] it's his redeeming work
[50:46] now think brother branham said it like
[50:48] this in the message supernatural prayer
[50:51] is not a perhaps
[50:53] prayer is a sincere thing
[50:56] prayer is talking to god
[50:59] prayer is not get down and shut your
[51:02] eyes and thinking about your washing or
[51:04] your work you're doing
[51:05] say lord help me and john and he'll miss
[51:08] jones and so forth that's not prayer
[51:11] that's repeating some words
[51:14] now every one of us can identify with
[51:16] this and we don't have to go back in the
[51:18] past this is a battleground
[51:21] i said this is a battleground right here
[51:23] so the word
[51:25] the holy spirit speaking through the
[51:27] prophet is not condemning us but he's
[51:29] letting us know you're not going into
[51:31] the full access right there's a lot of
[51:34] things on your mind and you might be
[51:36] spending time in prayer but you're
[51:38] really not getting anywhere or really
[51:41] getting into prayer there's just so much
[51:44] that you are thinking about now watch
[51:46] watch how the wisdom of the holy spirit
[51:49] how to combat this because if you left
[51:51] right now or clicked off right now you
[51:53] just say well there's just no hope no
[51:55] what's the wisdom of god at work here
[51:58] david said teach my hands to all right
[52:02] is that right i'm gonna fight a battle
[52:04] gotta fight a war then teach my hands to
[52:07] war teach me how to battle this because
[52:10] we are all faced with the cares of this
[52:12] life we are all faced with the burdens
[52:15] of this life sometimes the things we're
[52:18] looking at and trying to make sense of
[52:20] her how's this going to be burdens that
[52:23] we carry
[52:24] and you can't escape that i can't escape
[52:26] that
[52:28] we can't just go live in a monastery
[52:30] somewhere or you know just go in some
[52:32] community and live in some park and sing
[52:34] kumbaya every night we can't do that we
[52:37] rub shoulders with the world every day
[52:40] is that right we have things we have to
[52:42] attend to every day in our life
[52:46] as much as you would you know you and i
[52:48] like it and even for myself as a
[52:50] minister of the gospel i realize that i
[52:52] have more time i'm recountable and
[52:54] responsible to give myself to prayer
[52:57] into reading but there's also natural
[52:59] things of life that i have to attend to
[53:02] there's a cares in the church i have to
[53:04] attend to and yet with all of those
[53:07] things that god that you and i can
[53:10] fellowship over or experience we we
[53:13] sense this part of how there's things
[53:17] that can come to want to bombard our
[53:19] lives but the holy spirit is letting us
[53:22] know that's not prayer yes but here's
[53:25] the encouragement are you hearing me
[53:28] you know just sometimes you don't just
[53:30] click out this is real teaching coming
[53:33] right down to where meek goes on the
[53:35] bones
[53:37] but prayer is
[53:39] to come into an atmosphere where you
[53:42] realize that you're in the presence of
[53:43] god and you're moving to them in the
[53:46] deepest of sincerity now what's the
[53:49] battle plan here
[53:51] first
[53:52] it's a worship o jehovah how i love you
[53:56] amen
[53:57] hallelujah your time in prayer let me
[54:00] just let's just say lay it out in a time
[54:01] frame let's just say if it's an hour you
[54:04] might have to worship 45 minutes
[54:09] well brother samuel but if i've got all
[54:10] that in my mind i don't feel like
[54:12] worshiping it's called a sacrifice of
[54:14] praise you're worshiping not about how
[54:16] you feel you're worshiping him amen
[54:19] right come on now i would just say it
[54:21] like this i'm not gonna worship my
[54:22] feelings i'm not going to worship my
[54:24] thoughts i'm not going to worship my
[54:26] doubts i'm not going to worship those
[54:28] things i'm going to worship almighty god
[54:31] i'm going to thank him for what he's
[54:32] done i'm going to thank him for where he
[54:34] brought me from i'm going to thank him
[54:36] for his blood that's why brother adam
[54:38] can tell us if you want the holy spirit
[54:40] to come in a service sing songs about
[54:43] the blood
[54:45] amen oh how much more inside of a time
[54:48] of prayer you begin to fellowship about
[54:50] health it was on the road to emmaus that
[54:54] they were talking about him amen
[54:57] they didn't understand what was going on
[54:59] as a matter of fact they thought he that
[55:02] he didn't fulfill what was said about
[55:04] the redeemer but what it was they were
[55:06] talking about it and he drew near how
[55:08] much more is a child of god that's been
[55:11] redeemed by the blood of the lamb that
[55:14] knows the grace of god that can talk
[55:16] about the goodness of god how much more
[55:19] will he not come to you amen
[55:22] blessed be the name of the lord
[55:25] yes oh my
[55:26] hold to come into an atmosphere so first
[55:29] worship
[55:30] old jehovah how i love you you might
[55:33] have to put on some music
[55:35] put on some music
[55:37] and many times i pray with music on
[55:41] instrumental music right
[55:43] matter of fact i probably got as much
[55:44] intermittent mental music because i got
[55:46] other music and i got a lot of music
[55:50] but it's very important
[55:52] we're talking about a battle plan amen
[55:55] come on now we're we're the children of
[55:57] god we have not been made to walk as the
[56:00] tale we have been made the head
[56:04] amen taking our authority in our
[56:06] position we're talking about sons and
[56:08] daughters of god coming into
[56:09] manifestation then we have to take our
[56:12] authority in these little things for him
[56:15] that the thou has been faithful in
[56:17] little things i will make thee ruler
[56:19] over greater than amen amen
[56:21] is that right we don't despise the day
[56:24] of small things amen amen oh my it's
[56:27] worship o jehovah how i love you you see
[56:30] it
[56:30] then after the worship of prayer then
[56:33] you come with a sincere heart
[56:35] asking yes amen he said if you abide in
[56:38] me and not go out from behind the
[56:39] curtains in the world today and run
[56:41] around and try to get back in the
[56:42] curtains tonight if you abide in me and
[56:45] my words abiding you otherwise
[56:47] if you're like aaron's rod
[56:50] that's pulled up to the shekinah glory
[56:52] by the golden pot of manna i want them
[56:55] and i just want to emphasize this here
[56:57] i'm going somewhere
[56:58] otherwise if you're like aaron's rod
[57:02] that's pulled up to the shekinah glory
[57:05] by the golden pot of manna where you can
[57:08] eat at any time
[57:10] and your soul is refreshed
[57:13] and blooming
[57:14] and yielding your abiding
[57:18] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[57:19] you then ask what you will it will be
[57:22] given to you
[57:23] amen
[57:25] i just wanted to
[57:27] remind you
[57:29] remind us
[57:31] the manner that fell
[57:35] that manner as it fell and came down
[57:37] upon the dew
[57:40] the manna they were together a certain
[57:42] amount
[57:43] and partake of that manna
[57:46] there for the day that was their food
[57:49] god provided them it was a heavenly food
[57:53] it wasn't earthly it came down from
[57:55] heaven
[57:57] amen
[57:59] so
[58:00] they had a need and god already had
[58:03] everything covered right
[58:05] now
[58:06] that manna
[58:08] remember god told moses when that manna
[58:12] fell the very first morning he told him
[58:15] go get an omer and i want you to take of
[58:17] that manna and i want you to put it in
[58:20] that golden omer
[58:23] and when you take that i want you then
[58:25] to take that golden armor and i want you
[58:27] to take it and place it
[58:30] into the holiest of holiness
[58:33] there before the ark
[58:35] now let me say this
[58:36] it wasn't the manna itself
[58:40] that made the difference it was the
[58:42] place the manna was right
[58:45] you see this is why as we've looked and
[58:47] some months ago and really narrowing
[58:49] that down the holy ghost is a holy ghost
[58:52] it's the manna of god but the holy
[58:54] spirit can fall upon our flesh and
[58:56] that's all it does
[58:58] after a period of time that experience
[59:01] rots away and
[59:03] gone
[59:04] it can come upon our spirit
[59:06] right is that right and stimulate
[59:09] intellectually and and you say
[59:11] intellectually intellectually if you
[59:13] study the word it means emotional too
[59:16] we believe in being emotional
[59:18] but emotional is not what i i don't
[59:20] preach it but i believe that you
[59:22] understand
[59:23] so we recognize that there's got to come
[59:26] a falling of that manna inside of the
[59:30] soul or rather that which will change
[59:33] that life to where that life is no
[59:36] longer the same you wouldn't matter what
[59:38] goes on inside of that life it doesn't
[59:41] matter they're a christian from that day
[59:43] forward
[59:45] trials can come tests can come
[59:48] but they're a christian from that day
[59:50] forward i mean a believer tests and
[59:52] trials can come in other words the manna
[59:55] never
[59:56] gets more meat
[1:00:00] why
[1:00:00] because of the place that it is
[1:00:04] so it matters the place where the manner
[1:00:07] is now where the place where the manor
[1:00:09] was that manna was kept that every
[1:00:12] priest every man that entered into the
[1:00:14] of the priesthood could come back into
[1:00:16] there and take and be a partaker of that
[1:00:19] original manner that felt which is a
[1:00:22] type of the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:00:26] the day of pentecost amen that god has
[1:00:29] provided not a lesser experience but the
[1:00:32] same experience of the holy ghost that
[1:00:36] they had and let me tell you if it acted
[1:00:38] that way in the book of acts it'll act
[1:00:40] that same way right here you know you
[1:00:42] can't change it it'll produce the same
[1:00:45] answer how can a man be filled with the
[1:00:47] holy clothes and not full of the joy of
[1:00:50] almighty god you might run you might
[1:00:53] shout you might but one thing about it
[1:00:55] your life will be different from that
[1:00:57] moment on because there's manna that's
[1:01:01] come to the innermost place in your life
[1:01:04] you've got to reserve an original manner
[1:01:06] a life that's holding there
[1:01:10] now
[1:01:12] with that thought
[1:01:14] think about in our lives
[1:01:16] where we live in a three-room house
[1:01:19] body spirit right and so
[1:01:22] brother branham i'm just going to refer
[1:01:23] to this i'm not going to ask you to read
[1:01:25] it with me i'm just going to refer to
[1:01:26] this
[1:01:27] but brother adam would we deal with how
[1:01:30] within
[1:01:31] the three courts you come into the outer
[1:01:34] court there's a preaching of the word
[1:01:37] that's called the kitchen
[1:01:40] right
[1:01:41] and brother brand will tell us i want
[1:01:42] you to catch the things he's saying here
[1:01:45] he said that ministering of the word is
[1:01:48] not only for the sinner
[1:01:50] but it's for the holy ghost believer too
[1:01:52] so we all
[1:01:54] even though when a life has passed into
[1:01:57] the holiest of holies by the new birth
[1:02:00] you still
[1:02:01] have to come to the kitchen to eat
[1:02:04] and that's why brother man said the
[1:02:05] church is for the preaching of the
[1:02:07] gospel of jesus christ not only does it
[1:02:10] bring conviction to the sinner and open
[1:02:12] up the way for the journey into the
[1:02:15] holiest of holies but that word is also
[1:02:18] that you and i might be sustained might
[1:02:21] be fed might be encouraged might be
[1:02:24] helped in our journey
[1:02:25] so we all have to make visits to the
[1:02:27] kitchen amen and just by looking in the
[1:02:29] natural we know where it's at in our
[1:02:31] house
[1:02:34] i don't think there's any question there
[1:02:36] now after the kitchen
[1:02:38] you have the party
[1:02:40] right
[1:02:40] the parlor or brother would call it
[1:02:42] sometimes the sitting room or when you
[1:02:44] and i might call it the living room
[1:02:48] anyhow the place where you sit down in
[1:02:49] some comfortable chairs
[1:02:52] so it's a little bit more comfortable
[1:02:54] now into the fellowship of believers
[1:02:57] and fellowship with believers is very
[1:03:00] important
[1:03:01] amen let's say oh brother samuel you
[1:03:04] know i just get along fine with me in
[1:03:05] the lord that's good but don't be
[1:03:08] selfish
[1:03:09] you're part of the holy spirit that part
[1:03:12] in your life as a believer is to go with
[1:03:15] the rest of the bomb right amen
[1:03:18] is that right that's why we come
[1:03:19] together where paul would write for the
[1:03:22] saking forsaking not to assemble
[1:03:24] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:03:28] are right
[1:03:29] is that right
[1:03:30] because it's coming together it ain't
[1:03:32] about me
[1:03:33] all right it ain't about you it's about
[1:03:35] the body right amen you see when we live
[1:03:38] our lives for ourselves we live a
[1:03:40] selfish life
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:43] i'm talking about the parlor
[1:03:46] a time of fellowship we need fellowship
[1:03:48] with one another
[1:03:50] is that right
[1:03:51] fellowship the bible tells us iron
[1:03:53] sharpeneth iron we need the fellowship
[1:03:56] you need that time of getting together
[1:03:58] it thrills my heart when i see in the
[1:04:01] congregation where lies and families and
[1:04:04] different ones getting together in
[1:04:06] fellowship that thrills my heart why
[1:04:09] because i know that is a promise in the
[1:04:11] word and it's necessary amen amen
[1:04:14] it's necessary it is a part of the body
[1:04:18] of jesus christ and anybody who misses
[1:04:20] that is missing an integral revelation
[1:04:24] of the body of jesus christ
[1:04:28] are you with me
[1:04:29] even as i read to you some
[1:04:31] months ago the very opening statement in
[1:04:33] the message shalom where brother adam
[1:04:36] commends the people right there when he
[1:04:38] preaches the first message shalom in the
[1:04:40] trailer park there and he commends him
[1:04:43] for doing what he said i see some of you
[1:04:44] have brought your lunches together so
[1:04:47] that you can stick around and have
[1:04:48] fellowship with one another he said oh
[1:04:50] that thrills me
[1:04:53] we need one another that's right
[1:04:56] is that right
[1:04:57] so we need the kitchen we need the
[1:04:59] fellowship of the saints of one another
[1:05:02] we need that right and and fellowship is
[1:05:06] there where
[1:05:07] it's a part where we are speaking back
[1:05:10] and forth with somebody and we are we
[1:05:12] not only are we encouraging but i want
[1:05:14] to be encouraged amen and sometimes it
[1:05:16] isn't necessarily we go and sit down
[1:05:19] with somebody else and say all right
[1:05:21] encourage me but i don't know how many
[1:05:22] times whether i've talked with you know
[1:05:25] calling somebody who's sick on the phone
[1:05:27] or or you know sitting down with a group
[1:05:29] of brothers and you know just something
[1:05:31] is said i'm not talking about somebody
[1:05:33] taking a text and preaching in
[1:05:35] fellowship i'm talking about just
[1:05:37] something that's sad that just
[1:05:38] encourages me and it ain't about maybe a
[1:05:41] deep revelation but to see the working
[1:05:44] of the spirit of god in another person's
[1:05:46] life brother that sets me on fire
[1:05:51] fellowship is necessary amen
[1:05:55] oh boy i'll tell you we could is this
[1:05:56] the stream is rolling right now
[1:05:58] it's the devil's duty to cut you off
[1:06:01] from fellowship
[1:06:03] that's right message thirsting for life
[1:06:05] brother brown tells us the hounds of
[1:06:07] hell he said it's after you it's trying
[1:06:09] to chase you down he said what it is
[1:06:11] when you get to feeling a little bit of
[1:06:14] indifference towards somebody or the
[1:06:16] body of jesus christ he said that's the
[1:06:18] hounds of hell trying to chase after you
[1:06:21] let me tell you something we're all
[1:06:23] going to experience hurt and we're not
[1:06:25] all going to think a lot that's what
[1:06:27] makes it a paradox that we can
[1:06:29] fellowship as brothers and sisters
[1:06:32] of light precious faith
[1:06:35] are you hearing me i know that i could
[1:06:37] sit down and i could talk with maybe uh
[1:06:40] you know a number of my buddies for a
[1:06:41] long and long enough time and you know
[1:06:43] there might be little points of
[1:06:45] difference i i can't think of any that
[1:06:46] would be right now but i can tell you
[1:06:48] there might be little things but that in
[1:06:50] itself is not going to hinder fellowship
[1:06:53] unless i let it right
[1:06:55] amen hurt can cause you to isolate
[1:06:58] yourself the devil's ploy and trap is to
[1:07:01] try to get something said and then what
[1:07:03] you end up doing is pulling yourself out
[1:07:05] and saying i don't want to get hurt
[1:07:07] again but the greatest place you can go
[1:07:10] is to god in prayer and recognize what
[1:07:13] that mortal said you're immortal too and
[1:07:16] there's been people you've offended
[1:07:18] people i've offended people you've heard
[1:07:20] and people offered but in all we need
[1:07:23] the grace of almighty god i say let us
[1:07:26] cast down and move back into the parlor
[1:07:29] and stop isolating ourselves away
[1:07:31] because you need all three courts
[1:07:36] you can't just live in the holiest of
[1:07:38] holies and say i ain't going out there
[1:07:40] to the holy place to fellowship you
[1:07:42] can't do that that's right
[1:07:43] amen
[1:07:46] are you hearing me
[1:07:48] you can't just say well i'm gonna live
[1:07:50] here i ain't going back out to the outer
[1:07:52] court the outer court is the kitchen
[1:07:54] where the preaching and the hearing of
[1:07:56] the word comes
[1:08:03] a lot packed in this
[1:08:06] like a little suitcase like this and
[1:08:08] ends up packing up
[1:08:11] but then brother graham tells us
[1:08:13] from the kitchen
[1:08:14] to the parlor
[1:08:16] now he says the bedroom
[1:08:18] is that place of rest
[1:08:22] after the toil of a weary day always
[1:08:24] alone in that room
[1:08:27] rested
[1:08:28] now i'm just going to tell a little
[1:08:29] something on myself
[1:08:31] and i don't care
[1:08:35] i i like taking a nap in a recliner on
[1:08:37] sunday afternoons
[1:08:41] but if you told me i had to sleep in a
[1:08:43] recliner i can't do it
[1:08:45] overnight i had to a couple times with
[1:08:47] my back
[1:08:49] but i don't like doing it
[1:08:50] i just can't i'm not one of them guys
[1:08:52] that just go like this and go to sleep
[1:08:54] it gets to that point let's just stay up
[1:08:56] i might as well just start listening and
[1:08:58] doing it it's it's just we're not gonna
[1:08:59] waste time
[1:09:04] but it's something about now i'm just
[1:09:05] saying this ain't something spiritual
[1:09:07] you're gonna go unquote
[1:09:09] but there's something about the bedroom
[1:09:10] it's a place in the bedroom that's made
[1:09:13] for rest right
[1:09:16] now i know they make all kinds of
[1:09:17] different bedrooms now i mean when we
[1:09:19] went to look at houses you know some
[1:09:21] years back and i got to looking at
[1:09:22] houses and things like that i looked at
[1:09:24] the people that were building the house
[1:09:25] i said
[1:09:26] the people that want to buy these houses
[1:09:28] must hate one another
[1:09:30] they looked at me and said well sir this
[1:09:32] one has so many square feet i said but
[1:09:34] your room's downstairs i said look at
[1:09:36] the rooms downstairs then upstairs i
[1:09:38] said the bedrooms got their own living
[1:09:39] rooms and things in them i said people
[1:09:41] look like they hate one another and want
[1:09:43] to get away from one oh i see what it is
[1:09:45] sir you're a communal person i said i
[1:09:47] don't know what you're gonna what that
[1:09:48] means i said but i know this right here
[1:09:51] the bedroom is pinned in to have a
[1:09:53] living room up there right yeah are you
[1:09:56] hearing me
[1:09:57] so what i'm trying to get to is that a
[1:09:59] bedroom it's got a bed now you know we
[1:10:01] might have our dressers and everything
[1:10:03] else but the bedroom what's the purpose
[1:10:05] of the bedroom rest right
[1:10:08] and we need rest
[1:10:10] jesus said come unto me all you are
[1:10:12] heavy laden and weary and i will give
[1:10:15] you rest tapioca for your souls is that
[1:10:18] right amen the holy ghost is that rest
[1:10:21] that comes from god that brings a rest
[1:10:24] to a life to where we're no longer
[1:10:26] laboring under the load of sin are you
[1:10:29] hearing me tonight
[1:10:30] it brings a rest in our soul of peace
[1:10:33] with almighty god but to recognize that
[1:10:36] that is a place of rest we must have the
[1:10:39] kitchen we must have the parlor and we
[1:10:42] must have the place of rest they all
[1:10:44] work together in a christian life
[1:10:49] grant said i went into those old homes
[1:10:51] and i see the mothers they'll come out
[1:10:53] of the out of the bedroom with a little
[1:10:54] old checkered apron on wiping her eyes
[1:10:57] crying and praying it's a secret place a
[1:11:00] meeting place alone with god it's
[1:11:02] isolated oh he said the prayer room in
[1:11:05] my house he said is the bedroom and when
[1:11:07] a man ever takes his life out of these
[1:11:10] other places into that consecrated place
[1:11:13] with christ now think of this statement
[1:11:15] when a man ever takes his life out of
[1:11:18] these other places
[1:11:20] into that consecrated place with christ
[1:11:23] we have to go to those other places
[1:11:25] we we need let me just say very clearly
[1:11:27] we need to be feeding on the word amen
[1:11:31] we need to be feeding on the word
[1:11:33] because it's through feeding on the word
[1:11:36] that you can find things that god will
[1:11:38] begin to speak to our life it'll begin
[1:11:40] to put us in motion for things to pray
[1:11:43] about and to ask how we begin to see a
[1:11:46] reflection coming forth in our own life
[1:11:48] it's necessary the kitchen it's
[1:11:51] necessary of hearing the word of god let
[1:11:54] me just be very clear but if you're only
[1:11:56] coming to the kitchen and hearing the
[1:11:59] word and not going into the parlor and
[1:12:01] fellowshipping and then not going over
[1:12:04] into the place of rest you're missing it
[1:12:07] amen
[1:12:11] we have to take our lives
[1:12:15] out of these other places into that
[1:12:17] place
[1:12:19] this is not just a spiritual
[1:12:21] event that takes place although it is
[1:12:24] very it's the applicable part to that of
[1:12:26] the new birth but it's how we live in
[1:12:29] our lives
[1:12:32] whether we like it or not we have to we
[1:12:35] have to rule our own spirit right amen
[1:12:39] right the holy ghost doesn't do away
[1:12:41] with your human spirit right the holy
[1:12:44] ghost coming only does what nehemiah did
[1:12:48] in jerusalem it puts on the bars the
[1:12:50] gates the lots it puts that it keeps
[1:12:53] every gate in its rightful place but
[1:12:55] restores it under the rulership of the
[1:12:59] living god and under our charges sons
[1:13:01] and daughters of god
[1:13:03] right the fish gate was the fish gate
[1:13:05] the sheep gate was a sheep gate none of
[1:13:06] those gates change when nehemiah
[1:13:08] returned back to jerusalem but now there
[1:13:10] comes the right order the right things
[1:13:12] are coming through them they are built
[1:13:14] back up
[1:13:15] and that's why in our lives here with
[1:13:17] through our spirit sometimes oh my our
[1:13:20] spirit can get so weary our spirit can
[1:13:21] get so discouraged but you see this is
[1:13:24] where of entering in
[1:13:27] and shutting off the things of the world
[1:13:31] that holy place was a place where that
[1:13:33] where
[1:13:34] incense was offered up the prayer of
[1:13:36] incense everything tied together
[1:13:39] but it's to that veil when aaron would
[1:13:41] go into
[1:13:42] that holy place
[1:13:44] the veil would drop behind him
[1:13:48] it dropped
[1:13:50] and he was shut off it was a type of a
[1:13:52] life being shut off from the things of
[1:13:55] the world right
[1:13:57] there's there's one only one place that
[1:13:59] we can dwell
[1:14:00] to be shut off from the things of the
[1:14:02] world we all understand
[1:14:04] you can't do away with the things of the
[1:14:06] world as far as saying well i'm not
[1:14:08] going to worry about my job i'm not
[1:14:09] going to even i'm not going to go to
[1:14:11] work you don't go to work remember the
[1:14:12] bible said the man don't work he don't
[1:14:14] eat
[1:14:16] that's simple
[1:14:18] so paul was letting it be known no we
[1:14:19] got to go to work right
[1:14:22] oh brother say now i could be more
[1:14:23] spiritual if i didn't go to work no you
[1:14:25] can't you'll be as spiritual as your
[1:14:28] walk in god in the calling that god has
[1:14:31] called you in let every man abide in the
[1:14:33] calling wherein he was called amen
[1:14:37] is that right don't let the devil tell
[1:14:39] you that but you can make every use and
[1:14:42] every opportunity of every moment that
[1:14:45] you have
[1:14:46] that's right
[1:14:49] and i would say it like this there's
[1:14:51] things that sometimes we come into and
[1:14:52] we have to ask god teach us lord this is
[1:14:55] something new anybody ever been in of
[1:14:56] things where it comes about your life
[1:14:58] that all of a sudden you've got a
[1:14:59] routine and all of a sudden some things
[1:15:00] come in and oh there goes a routine
[1:15:03] and you know that routine being busted
[1:15:05] ain't a day thing it ain't a weak thing
[1:15:06] it ain't a month you don't know how long
[1:15:09] and you're looking at it now you can
[1:15:10] look at the routine and be defeated with
[1:15:13] it come on i'm preaching now you can
[1:15:15] look at that and say oh my goodness i
[1:15:16] got to get back to that instead of
[1:15:18] saying i got to get back to that this is
[1:15:20] only part of it say god help me within
[1:15:24] this allotment right here that i can
[1:15:26] live and walk in victory and extract
[1:15:28] from you lord and give myself to you of
[1:15:31] what you're calling for
[1:15:34] because you see what happens if satan
[1:15:36] can get us focused on the breaking of
[1:15:39] our routine then he's got us in a place
[1:15:41] we don't even have confidence to enter
[1:15:43] in prayer and that lack of confidence
[1:15:45] has nothing to do with sin it has
[1:15:47] everything to do with us feeling down
[1:15:50] about ourselves
[1:15:55] that's true
[1:15:59] oh my
[1:16:00] is to get shut off from the things of
[1:16:02] the world and to commune with him
[1:16:05] you know every one of us want to grow
[1:16:07] all right amen is that right
[1:16:10] i'll tell you what i i love reading
[1:16:12] quotes charles spurgeon you know i
[1:16:14] remember read charles virgin there his
[1:16:16] devotions and things like that powerful
[1:16:18] man i mean when they talked about
[1:16:20] charles purgin being a prince of
[1:16:21] preachers and things charles spurgeon
[1:16:23] was a man of prayer all right
[1:16:25] let me tell you something right now our
[1:16:27] prophet the messenger to this age was a
[1:16:29] man of prayer
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] that's exactly right
[1:16:33] in me here's what charles spurgeon said
[1:16:36] no man can progress in grace if he
[1:16:38] forsakes prayer
[1:16:41] well i'm eating good in the kitchen
[1:16:43] but the eating in the kitchen is to give
[1:16:45] you strength to go to the park and in
[1:16:48] the parlor it ought to encourage you and
[1:16:50] they're you to take your life on over
[1:16:54] into that place of rest
[1:16:56] to get along with god
[1:16:58] you see
[1:16:59] as we look at this with time
[1:17:02] prayer itself let me just let me just
[1:17:04] try to
[1:17:05] bring this together here
[1:17:09] there's a quote that i've been reading
[1:17:10] to you
[1:17:12] and i've preached from this quote here
[1:17:15] uh a few services
[1:17:17] but i want to take a few words here in
[1:17:19] this quote
[1:17:21] we know that as the scripture has said
[1:17:23] that we read in matthew 6 6 that enter
[1:17:26] into the closet
[1:17:28] enter into that to that secret place in
[1:17:30] other words
[1:17:31] there's times where we do have to get
[1:17:33] along there's times as i said before
[1:17:34] that we've witnessed that where god has
[1:17:36] visited us i remember when i was
[1:17:38] teaching school even my goodness i'd
[1:17:40] have kids you know out here and we've
[1:17:42] been taking them into the restroom and
[1:17:44] things like that and i'd have to
[1:17:46] hey somebody go get my notepad over
[1:17:48] there i'm just sitting there writing
[1:17:49] notes and things just coming in that
[1:17:52] moment and sometimes in the middle of
[1:17:53] teaching i would just talk but
[1:17:55] i say that you've experienced that too
[1:18:01] but this is still the time
[1:18:04] that we have to take and get along with
[1:18:06] the lord
[1:18:08] is to see the value of it
[1:18:10] that's what i trust that god is just
[1:18:12] just just to rekindle and revisit some
[1:18:15] things in our life to see the value of
[1:18:17] it as a matter of fact brother branham
[1:18:19] would say it like this of that great
[1:18:21] thing that god has placed into the care
[1:18:23] of our
[1:18:24] hands prayer
[1:18:26] has been placed into our care
[1:18:30] jesus would get alone you know that from
[1:18:32] the scripture
[1:18:33] he would get alone
[1:18:35] go up into a mountain
[1:18:36] alone to pray jesus
[1:18:38] even when it came to the time
[1:18:41] in matthew 26 you read
[1:18:43] of getting ready to go to calvary he
[1:18:45] takes some with him
[1:18:47] is that right right but then he goes on
[1:18:49] up a little higher all right a little
[1:18:51] further
[1:18:53] i'll tell you
[1:18:54] none of us have come to a place like
[1:18:56] jesus came to at gethsemane
[1:18:59] spiritually i realized we have to die
[1:19:02] is that right
[1:19:03] but i'm talking about to wear that even
[1:19:05] in the midst of the agony
[1:19:07] is his sweat but turned to blood
[1:19:11] we've never come we've never come into
[1:19:12] that place a matter of fact brother
[1:19:14] brahm tells us in that conference every
[1:19:16] demon out of hell was gathered around it
[1:19:18] was like that arena where samson was at
[1:19:20] and all the demons that were were
[1:19:22] gathered there the demons that that had
[1:19:24] ever made
[1:19:26] that had ever come upon and influenced
[1:19:28] men upon the earth
[1:19:29] every one of them demons were gathered
[1:19:31] around right trying to
[1:19:33] you know looking upon what the decision
[1:19:36] is going to be
[1:19:37] he prayed three times right
[1:19:40] three times he prayed
[1:19:43] and he prayed a prayer
[1:19:45] that very much like you and i pray at
[1:19:47] times when we have a test or a trial we
[1:19:49] have something that comes up brother
[1:19:51] branham put in souls in prison now he
[1:19:53] prayed to dodge the cross
[1:19:56] all right aren't you glad that that
[1:19:57] prayer wasn't answered right
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:01] right
[1:20:02] come on young people there's some
[1:20:04] prayers you pray but aren't you glad
[1:20:05] that god didn't answer them prayers
[1:20:09] come on older people aren't you glad
[1:20:10] right
[1:20:12] we prayed them sincere but aren't we
[1:20:14] glad that god didn't answer them because
[1:20:16] reserve what we want to reserve are you
[1:20:18] hearing the young people what we always
[1:20:20] want to reserve that might be something
[1:20:22] we're praying about but let it be in all
[1:20:24] things god the number one thing is your
[1:20:27] will that's what i want i might be
[1:20:30] disappointed temporarily
[1:20:32] but i know when you're making on your
[1:20:34] will there's a blessing there's joy
[1:20:38] there's satisfaction
[1:20:40] amen reality
[1:20:42] substance amen longevity
[1:20:45] there's groundedness in that
[1:20:49] and he went up to pray
[1:20:52] and pray alone
[1:20:56] brother branham would say it like this
[1:20:58] and i've read this one to you
[1:21:01] he said if jesus had to spend
[1:21:04] much time in prayer
[1:21:06] to stay in fellowship with the spirit
[1:21:08] that was in him
[1:21:10] three-room house all right
[1:21:14] so to stay in contact
[1:21:17] with the spirit that was in it
[1:21:19] see how god's so convincing
[1:21:21] he had to spend
[1:21:23] much time in prayer
[1:21:26] there's a lot of things we can spend on
[1:21:28] all right
[1:21:30] you hear me now
[1:21:31] a lot of things we but you know what you
[1:21:33] only spend
[1:21:34] it's just like when i talked to brother
[1:21:36] herb the one time i asked brother herb i
[1:21:37] said what in the world
[1:21:39] what makes things different with all
[1:21:40] these antiques
[1:21:42] brotherhood told me he said ah he said
[1:21:44] out here at james he said you know
[1:21:45] people up here don't really look after
[1:21:47] the things you know
[1:21:49] you know
[1:21:50] i don't know if everybody's wanting to
[1:21:51] cheat cheat something or what he said
[1:21:53] when i go to kentucky he said i'm
[1:21:54] emptied up by eight o'clock in the
[1:21:55] morning
[1:21:57] they were waiting on him at 5 30 in the
[1:21:59] morning i said what makes a difference
[1:22:01] right what makes a difference i mean it
[1:22:03] ain't because you're from kentucky
[1:22:05] what makes a difference he said it's the
[1:22:07] value
[1:22:08] that the person places
[1:22:10] upon it that's right
[1:22:12] and that's what makes the difference
[1:22:16] it's the value you know that's why you
[1:22:17] know
[1:22:18] well one person can say
[1:22:20] i would buy this pair of shoes and other
[1:22:21] ones say i ain't spending that much
[1:22:23] money on them shoes
[1:22:24] you see
[1:22:25] the value is in the eyes
[1:22:28] of the beholder
[1:22:29] let me just stop here tonight
[1:22:31] jesus spent
[1:22:33] much time
[1:22:35] in prayer
[1:22:37] there's things that we're going to
[1:22:39] we're going to spend time on
[1:22:42] in life and there's things that we have
[1:22:44] to do in life right but we want to make
[1:22:47] sure
[1:22:48] that our life
[1:22:50] and the time
[1:22:52] is not spent or taken up
[1:22:55] with other things
[1:22:57] and leaving jesus
[1:22:59] in the corner
[1:23:00] with dirty feet
[1:23:03] we're going to spend what do you mean by
[1:23:04] spin brother samuel it'll cost us
[1:23:07] it'll cost us a little bit of sacrifice
[1:23:09] here and there it'll cost us some things
[1:23:12] it'll cost us some time away
[1:23:16] but it's the value
[1:23:19] the value of getting along
[1:23:23] with god
[1:23:26] and
[1:23:27] every one of us that are here
[1:23:29] there's things that you
[1:23:31] it seems like seasons of life sometimes
[1:23:33] that comes about
[1:23:35] sometimes there's things where just
[1:23:37] brother brown said in invisible union he
[1:23:38] said like they say in the south
[1:23:41] of course i'm speaking
[1:23:42] home right here we know what that's like
[1:23:44] like when brother benny talked about
[1:23:45] being washed up i said
[1:23:47] we knew what you were talking about man
[1:23:49] all right
[1:23:50] what brother graham said you said you
[1:23:51] heard the saying in the south when it
[1:23:53] rains it floors or it rains like cats
[1:23:55] and dogs
[1:23:56] you know what that means
[1:23:58] sometimes there's seasons and things in
[1:24:00] life
[1:24:01] that comes in our life
[1:24:03] that sometimes it's things yes we're
[1:24:05] unprepared for maybe it's things that
[1:24:07] you have to address at your house that
[1:24:09] you didn't even prepare on addressing
[1:24:12] you have to take care of them
[1:24:14] then there's other things sometimes it
[1:24:16] comes along like i told the young people
[1:24:17] before when i was in when i was going to
[1:24:20] college and in school i remember i told
[1:24:21] my dad i said you know what i met him
[1:24:23] one day at bob evans and i said for
[1:24:25] lunch i said you know what i'm done
[1:24:28] done
[1:24:29] now my dad never said boy you know
[1:24:33] he used wisdom here's what he did he
[1:24:35] said
[1:24:36] you can do that if you want
[1:24:38] but he said let me tell you my
[1:24:39] experiences with ford and gm and he went
[1:24:41] down through all the things because at
[1:24:42] that time they were really hiring for
[1:24:43] some good money you say brother samuel
[1:24:45] what was your objective in that i said
[1:24:47] you know what i'm tired of looking at
[1:24:48] research papers
[1:24:50] i want to spend more time listening to
[1:24:52] the message
[1:24:58] and here's what he told me
[1:25:00] he said you can either go that route he
[1:25:03] said i know what you want
[1:25:06] how god it so touched my life this this
[1:25:08] message the lord jesus that's who it is
[1:25:10] means everything to me all right it gave
[1:25:13] me life gave you life didn't it amen i
[1:25:16] just want more i just want more
[1:25:19] they told me you go down this path but
[1:25:21] if i went that path
[1:25:23] then i'm subject to all these other
[1:25:24] things
[1:25:25] but i i didn't want to i didn't want to
[1:25:27] go through this time where i'm like my
[1:25:29] mind
[1:25:30] i got to think about this paper and
[1:25:32] think about this and think about that
[1:25:33] and think about this
[1:25:35] do you know what i found and i know some
[1:25:37] of you heard this over and over
[1:25:39] but it won't hurt hearing it again
[1:25:43] you take a message like restoration to
[1:25:45] the bride tree three hours and 22
[1:25:47] minutes
[1:25:48] it was three cassette tapes because i
[1:25:49] didn't have one of the mp3s at the time
[1:25:53] it took me weeks to get through that
[1:25:55] message
[1:25:56] going back and forth to school
[1:26:00] in my off times different times that i
[1:26:02] had well i could listen to another
[1:26:04] message there but i just kept a message
[1:26:06] right there in the car and going back
[1:26:08] and forth to the
[1:26:10] bgsu satellite college
[1:26:13] about 15 minutes in the car
[1:26:15] but it wasn't about quantity
[1:26:18] that's right it was about the wallet
[1:26:22] and there's things that god spoke right
[1:26:23] then in those messages that i can still
[1:26:26] and still bring right back in such a
[1:26:27] reality and so
[1:26:29] what am i saying
[1:26:31] things come about sometimes
[1:26:34] in our life
[1:26:35] but don't let that get you down that's
[1:26:36] right
[1:26:38] even sometimes when you have to make
[1:26:40] certain changes maybe in career or go to
[1:26:42] school or you got other things that come
[1:26:43] about don't get occupied with that but
[1:26:46] make the most of every
[1:26:48] opportunity amen take time and i'll tell
[1:26:51] you this right now i can tell you this
[1:26:53] by experience that if you put god first
[1:26:57] you'll come out on top
[1:26:59] amen if you give yourself to the lord
[1:27:01] you just give yourself you watch what
[1:27:03] god will do within your life
[1:27:05] they'll come those other times that you
[1:27:07] have longer spaces of time
[1:27:10] all that runs it runs the same way with
[1:27:12] pastoring i found it year after year
[1:27:14] there's certain times
[1:27:17] sometimes i look for certain months to
[1:27:19] come and
[1:27:20] where did months go we must gotten more
[1:27:22] months added into this calendar year
[1:27:30] but the value
[1:27:32] we're going to spend our time on
[1:27:34] something
[1:27:35] amen
[1:27:37] just ask yourself the question
[1:27:39] what i'm giving myself to
[1:27:41] is it worth it
[1:27:43] what's it doing for my life
[1:27:46] let's see the schooling like i'm
[1:27:48] speaking to some of you brothers and
[1:27:49] things like that that's went to
[1:27:50] schooling you went to schooling but it's
[1:27:52] like i've told the young people told my
[1:27:54] boys i hope it's all right
[1:27:55] i told my boys i said you you either set
[1:27:57] your priorities right
[1:28:00] right now
[1:28:01] or when you get older you have jobs that
[1:28:03] will control you and take you away from
[1:28:05] the things that you want to do
[1:28:09] you want you want god to be first in
[1:28:10] your life you want to be there to
[1:28:12] influence your family have prayer with
[1:28:14] them be able to sit down with your your
[1:28:16] children when you have them i want you
[1:28:18] to be able to do that that's your
[1:28:19] responsibility then you've got to take
[1:28:21] ownership of things right now
[1:28:24] because why
[1:28:26] that way the priorities of serving god
[1:28:28] being in the house of god
[1:28:31] you've taken care of first things first
[1:28:34] it's a season that's right but we'll get
[1:28:36] through seasons
[1:28:38] it's just like right now the snow
[1:28:40] beautiful snow we'll get through it for
[1:28:41] all you that don't like snow
[1:28:44] but in the meantime
[1:28:46] after after this
[1:28:48] it'll be springtime again amen all right
[1:28:51] it's just a season
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:54] a season and that's how our lives but
[1:28:56] every season
[1:28:58] is important
[1:29:00] every season is important and in every
[1:29:03] season
[1:29:04] god is working and there's things that
[1:29:06] even through these things right now that
[1:29:08] we look at and sometimes we're saying
[1:29:11] i just get this out of the way no no no
[1:29:13] just say god
[1:29:14] what i'm to learn from this right here
[1:29:16] not only for my natural life but also in
[1:29:19] my walk with you teach me
[1:29:32] lord jesus
[1:29:36] i pray father tonight lord as we've just
[1:29:38] come together here
[1:29:40] lord step aside from the toils of
[1:29:44] the week and the day
[1:29:47] lord jesus
[1:29:50] every one of us we live in a three-room
[1:29:51] house
[1:29:53] and every one of us lord
[1:29:55] things that we have to attend to
[1:29:58] in the kitchen
[1:29:59] parlor
[1:30:01] but oh god
[1:30:03] may we not forsake the bedroom
[1:30:07] may we not forsake that place of rest
[1:30:11] but may we lord i pray
[1:30:14] as your prophet told us lord
[1:30:17] jesus spent
[1:30:19] much time with prayer
[1:30:22] to stay in fellowship in the spirit
[1:30:26] lord help us tonight
[1:30:30] god i ask that
[1:30:32] if there's lord for every one of us
[1:30:34] that's here
[1:30:36] i'm asking the lord that
[1:30:38] you would just just convey even more
[1:30:42] the value
[1:30:44] of prayer
[1:30:48] there's situations we can be looking at
[1:30:50] my goodness we can think it's going a
[1:30:52] certain way
[1:30:54] but father prayer
[1:30:57] changes things
[1:30:59] you said ask the father anything in my
[1:31:01] name and i'll do it
[1:31:03] lord
[1:31:04] may we live faithfully
[1:31:08] in the kitchen

[1:31:27] been in the kitchen for a while we've
[1:31:28] got to take our lives

[1:31:33] there and we we have to take our lives
[1:31:35] out of the kitchen in the parlor
[1:31:37] and over into that bedroom i think it's
[1:31:39] tremendous how your prophet said it that
[1:31:41] way
[1:31:42] because it's an entering in
[1:31:45] as you told us lord jesus in matthew 6 6

[1:32:00] of the supernatural
[1:32:02] may we stay so in fellowship with you
[1:32:05] to lord
[1:32:08] that communion in that
[1:32:10] that unction lord the sweetness
[1:32:12] that accompanies
[1:32:14] getting in your presence
[1:32:17] the fragrance

[1:32:44] holies lord through and by the veil of
