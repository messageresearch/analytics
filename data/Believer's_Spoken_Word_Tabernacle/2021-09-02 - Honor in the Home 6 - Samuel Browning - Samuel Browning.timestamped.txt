[37:32] [Applause]
[37:34] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of
[37:38] the lord
[37:39] amen we're so good for that so glad so
[37:42] glad for the grace of god
[37:45] amen just want to
[37:47] give you a little bit of update here
[37:49] from brother soriano
[37:52] and
[37:53] they
[37:54] had
[37:57] with
[37:57] they'd put a they did the trach the
[37:59] tracheotomy surgery
[38:01] and he came through that very well i
[38:03] guess that's a procedure they do when
[38:06] they've been on a ventilator for for so
[38:08] long but
[38:10] and you know those are things that
[38:12] sometimes you think of tracheotomy i
[38:14] think of that in the past but you know
[38:16] some of you know a brother right now
[38:19] i don't know if any how many of you know
[38:20] brother bill younce but brother
[38:22] billiance had one and then you know they
[38:25] they not from covet but brother
[38:26] billiance had one from years ago and
[38:29] when there was a situation going on with
[38:31] his heart
[38:32] and they closed that right back up and
[38:34] brother billiards just resumed right
[38:35] back to preaching and things like that
[38:38] so
[38:39] we we just know that that's a process
[38:42] and so
[38:43] um
[38:44] he's he's had sister cynthia is able to
[38:47] be in the icu with him now
[38:49] and uh his his saturation levels on
[38:52] oxygen are really good they're right up
[38:55] to almost 99 which we thank god for that
[38:59] and uh his oxygen level uh it's about at
[39:03] about an 85 percent so some of those
[39:06] things are our processes after they've
[39:08] went through that that surgery
[39:10] and uh you know we just just tried to
[39:14] encourage and look at look at these
[39:16] things because
[39:18] you know the thing that we look at above
[39:21] everything else is the promise of god
[39:24] i know the things that the world looks
[39:27] at the world looks at things like
[39:29] as a ventilator and all those things as
[39:31] a death sentence but the reality is we
[39:33] look at the promise of god
[39:36] amen there's there's there's just
[39:38] there's nothing greater than the promise
[39:40] of almighty god and so there's never you
[39:44] know in a situation that's that's uh
[39:46] that our brother has been through and
[39:48] god has certainly been seeing brother
[39:50] roell through so i just give that report
[39:52] to you to encourage you because i can't
[39:55] tell you everything that's been happened
[39:56] moment by moment through the week as
[39:58] sister cynthia has just been
[40:01] relaying to me those different different
[40:03] events but there has been improvements
[40:05] and the things that you know that i just
[40:07] had expressed to them is footsteps are
[40:10] possession
[40:11] they got not the land all at once but
[40:13] little by little by little by little
[40:15] amen and we we certainly you know
[40:18] there's a battle but as the children of
[40:20] god that's where we stand within this
[40:22] time and we know no retreat
[40:26] we don't we don't turn back
[40:28] god said i will make you the head and
[40:31] not the tail
[40:32] and so there's never any defeat for a
[40:35] child of god and you know it's just like
[40:38] uh when you hear of a request
[40:41] you know sometimes there's a request or
[40:43] there's something that comes and you
[40:44] feel like you get a blow
[40:46] you know maybe you went to the doctor
[40:48] and something comes your way in it just
[40:49] feels like somebody just slugged you you
[40:51] know and that can happen we feel that in
[40:54] our humanity
[40:55] because the the baptism of the holy
[40:57] ghost did not take away our humanity
[41:00] but what it did it gave us a strength
[41:02] and a grace to order this humanity in
[41:04] the word of god
[41:05] so we have an inner power an inner peace
[41:07] and a direction and this is where we we
[41:09] look to god and we take the promises of
[41:12] god as
[41:13] situations and things arise god has
[41:16] everything covered
[41:19] i mean my goodness you you and i you
[41:21] know how it is when we try to go on a
[41:22] trip somewhere
[41:24] we try to plan for everything you know i
[41:27] take this and i take that and i take
[41:29] this and sometimes we still are trying
[41:31] to write little notes oh to remember
[41:32] this and remember that and remember this
[41:34] at the last moment and i won't ask you
[41:36] how many forgot things just like i did
[41:40] i'll tell you a little story on myself
[41:42] one time that i i got uh
[41:45] you know as when some things had just
[41:46] taken place where my father had just
[41:48] passed away
[41:49] and i got i had to go minister and i got
[41:52] at the end of the turnpike clear over
[41:54] there to get off and i realized i forgot
[41:55] the most important thing my briefcase
[41:59] i told my wife i said meet me at the
[42:00] amherst place and just bring my
[42:02] briefcase with you it's all packed up so
[42:04] i got there and i unpacked the briefcase
[42:06] you know and i get there just so i you
[42:08] know i'm i'm about you know about an
[42:10] hour away from church starting you know
[42:12] so i'm at that in a place and okay i
[42:14] know what you know god's given me on my
[42:16] heart to minister but i realize as i get
[42:18] my suit and everything on all i have to
[42:20] wear is these
[42:22] crocs that look like house shoes
[42:25] and they're they're a light tan and i
[42:27] have a black suit on brother samuel what
[42:30] did you do i went to the pulpit and
[42:31] preached with crocs on
[42:33] and a black suit and tie
[42:35] you know those are things i didn't mean
[42:37] for that to happen in that way and
[42:40] one of the brothers told me uh after
[42:42] this after the sunday service that was
[42:44] on friday night and i was able to slip
[42:46] out and buy some shoes you know for
[42:47] saturday service and sunday one of the
[42:49] brothers said i just thought it was a
[42:51] new style
[42:55] you know god has a way of humbling you
[42:57] you know and it just you have to come
[42:59] into those places what's the main
[43:01] purpose and what we're here for and i
[43:03] said all that to say this god has this
[43:06] remember this is the same case doctor's
[43:09] bag
[43:10] that dr moses used
[43:12] but the brahm said when a situation
[43:14] would arise there in the middle of the
[43:16] night he would reach in there and he
[43:17] said he had the same prescription
[43:19] that was given for every situation he
[43:21] said no matter if a baby was born or
[43:23] somebody's eye he said got poked out he
[43:25] said this the same scripture applied i'm
[43:28] the lord that healeth all thy diseases
[43:30] and i'm just so grateful for that i'm
[43:32] glad that i'm glad god didn't name him
[43:34] i'm glad it's not superscription he
[43:35] named them all because we could say oh
[43:37] my god forgot about this but he said all
[43:41] all
[43:43] all that diseases so to know that god
[43:45] knows exactly
[43:46] where we're at and you know
[43:48] whether it's covet whether it's flu
[43:51] whether it's silent whatever it is
[43:52] cancer i'm the lord
[43:55] that healeth all
[43:56] thy diseases
[43:58] this is where our trust is that is in
[43:59] him and i'm so glad he's faithful
[44:02] he's mindful aren't you glad for that
[44:03] tonight
[44:04] amen could we just approach him in a
[44:06] word of prayer

[47:32] in the name of jesus christ
[47:35] amen
[47:36] amen first corinthians 13 and verse 4
[47:42] and then i'm going to read
[47:43] i want then to go into ephesians 5 once
[47:46] again
[47:52] in first corinthians 13 4
[47:58] charity
[48:00] charity this is god this is the love of
[48:03] god this is god's own life
[48:06] charity suffereth long it's kind
[48:10] it envieth not
[48:12] it bonneth not itself and is not puffed
[48:14] up
[48:16] and it does not behave itself
[48:19] unseemly
[48:21] and i want to kind of if i can read that
[48:22] out of the amplified bible there i have
[48:24] that verse if we have it on the screen
[48:27] and it's pulling from this does not
[48:29] behave itself unseemly
[48:31] it's not conceited
[48:33] which is to be arrogant or inflated with
[48:35] pride
[48:36] it's not rude or unmannerly and does not
[48:40] act
[48:41] unbecomingly
[48:44] amen may god bless the reading of the
[48:46] word
[48:47] the manager being seated
[48:50] just wanna as we look at this we
[48:53] recognize that
[48:55] since the love of god
[48:57] is god himself
[49:00] and dwelling in the believer by way of
[49:02] the new birth
[49:05] that
[49:06] the love of god will always conduct
[49:08] itself
[49:10] in the word
[49:12] and so when we think of this
[49:14] this place here in the scripture does
[49:16] not behave itself unseemly we we see
[49:19] that there is a display of a behavior
[49:22] that would be
[49:23] according to the word that doesn't mean
[49:25] that things we we know uh would be easy
[49:29] or would maybe uh be going our way
[49:33] necessarily but when opposition arises
[49:36] this is where you realize in many of
[49:39] these in some of these things it deals
[49:41] with what's within
[49:43] it deals with casting out thoughts
[49:45] vaunting not itself and all these things
[49:48] that can come our way even feelings
[49:50] about things but then as it deals with
[49:52] remember brother brown talks about the
[49:54] things that you think about
[49:56] the things you dwell on
[49:58] that's why paul would say that you're to
[50:00] think upon things of a good report not
[50:03] just upon things that are true because
[50:05] there's a lot of things that are true
[50:07] that if you dwell on it very long it'll
[50:09] affect you in a negative way
[50:11] is that right
[50:12] you you know
[50:13] just like when we think about the spies
[50:15] that were in the land i mean to dwell
[50:17] upon giants being in the land that was
[50:19] truth but it was not truth that was to
[50:22] be dwelt upon
[50:24] the truth to be dwelled upon is god made
[50:26] the promise
[50:27] god is for us and they shall be bred for
[50:30] us
[50:31] so there's a there's a right truth and
[50:33] paul would balance it out that the truth
[50:36] that we are to dwell upon is that which
[50:38] has virtue that which has
[50:41] praise that which is of a good report
[50:44] that's the kind of truth these are the
[50:45] things we want to think on because
[50:47] whatever we think upon and dwell upon it
[50:50] creates an atmosphere around us
[50:53] and so
[50:54] when we think about even with the
[50:56] behavior and knowing that it's part of
[50:59] the character and we know that character
[51:01] itself is never made but character
[51:04] itself is a victory
[51:06] from battle after battle after battle
[51:10] and it's really not battling with
[51:12] someone else it's battling with our own
[51:14] selves
[51:16] it's bringing ourselves as paul would
[51:18] say i die daily this is why the lord
[51:21] jesus would say
[51:23] that let a man deny himself and take up
[51:26] his cross
[51:27] luke would write it daily
[51:29] and to see that it's a sacrificing daily
[51:32] it's a letting go but it's a letting go
[51:35] on the account and giving the word the
[51:38] preeminence in our life this is our
[51:40] desire
[51:41] in our lives is that he might be
[51:43] glorified so when we look at this the
[51:47] it's a behavior that's according to the
[51:49] word not necessarily a behavior that's
[51:51] according to the circumstances that's
[51:53] around us
[51:54] because the circumstances around us
[51:57] if we allow the circumstances to capture
[52:00] us our behavior could now come under the
[52:03] governance of whatever those
[52:04] circumstances are remember when brother
[52:06] branham was standing there and the
[52:08] maniac that came up there he got loose
[52:10] he had already uh you know done a
[52:13] preacher in out there on the sidewalk
[52:14] and he came walking up there and he spit
[52:17] right in brother branham's face
[52:19] and he said you hypocrite and he
[52:20] challenged he came right at him now
[52:22] brother brown says i chose at that time
[52:24] to think different thoughts
[52:27] he began to think different thoughts and
[52:29] thoughts concerning that man and that in
[52:32] itself now listen god didn't do that for
[52:34] him he had to do that
[52:37] and recognize the thoughts that he had
[52:39] he said the same thing about the bull
[52:41] said the same thing about the about the
[52:43] bees they were thoughts that were coming
[52:45] to him that was bringing fear and
[52:48] brother brown made the statement in all
[52:49] three of those things he said i made a
[52:52] determination i'm not going to die like
[52:55] a coward
[52:57] god didn't do that for him he made that
[53:00] decision
[53:01] but that decision within that invited
[53:04] the presence of almighty god now it's
[53:07] true there might be times in our life
[53:09] that our thoughts are out of line and
[53:11] you might say how do i get my thoughts
[53:13] in line i'd first be honest with god and
[53:15] say lord my thoughts are out of line i
[53:18] need help lord right now to help and
[53:20] give me strength because i want your
[53:23] thoughts to permeate and rule over my
[53:27] thoughts because
[53:28] as it said in isaiah 55 my thoughts are
[53:31] not your thoughts
[53:32] they're higher
[53:34] and in how isaiah went on to bring about
[53:37] those thoughts bring life bring
[53:39] nourishment bring refreshment bring
[53:41] delight so rather when we look at it
[53:44] it's not a behavior that's governed by
[53:47] circumstances in our life but rather
[53:49] it's where the actions then become under
[53:52] the governance of the love of god from
[53:54] our soul and you know the love of god
[53:57] makes no exceptions
[54:00] it makes no exceptions even when it
[54:02] comes into our life
[54:04] this is why
[54:06] paul could write
[54:07] grieve not the holy spirit of god
[54:11] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[54:13] your redemption
[54:14] because there is the possibility of
[54:17] grieving him
[54:19] brother brown would say it like this he
[54:21] says as that dove which a dove is timid
[54:24] a dove is meek a dove is not burly but
[54:27] that dove then would take its flight and
[54:29] he says he says it's just taking its
[54:31] flight out there he says but now what
[54:34] you must do is you must come into a
[54:36] place to become a lamb to welcome him
[54:39] back
[54:41] so when we look at this the love of god
[54:44] it makes no exceptions it'll always
[54:46] direct us to the word even when it comes
[54:49] into our life
[54:51] to where is the lining up and it's
[54:53] saying lord forgive me or help me in
[54:57] this area you see let me just say it
[54:59] like this god has no problem
[55:02] with us coming to him and say lord
[55:05] help me lord forgive me in this area god
[55:08] is not bothered with that but what
[55:10] becomes a hindrance is when we stop
[55:13] allowing reflection in our life
[55:17] deflection is the worst thing in the
[55:19] world
[55:21] where everything is because of somebody
[55:23] else's fault
[55:24] i wouldn't do this if it wasn't because
[55:26] of somebody that's deflection
[55:28] reflection looks inwardly it lets the
[55:31] word come in because to say god help me
[55:34] to look inwardly that's real maturity
[55:38] because it's not always comfortable to
[55:41] look inwardly but i'll tell you what
[55:43] it'll do it'll help us to grow in the
[55:45] grace of almighty god for any of us that
[55:49] refuse to look into the word and really
[55:52] take a real examination in our life and
[55:55] it's not just why the word is being
[55:57] preached but even when situations arise
[56:01] about our life if we fail to really
[56:04] examine our life now let me just say
[56:06] this as it's coming to me
[56:08] that does not mean for us just to say
[56:10] man something must be wrong with me
[56:12] that's not examination
[56:14] examination you don't you know when you
[56:17] don't just look at yourself or or come
[56:19] to a part and say there must be
[56:21] something wrong with me you go to a
[56:23] mirror you might find a window on a car
[56:25] you start looking at things what's wrong
[56:28] is this wrong you know sometimes you try
[56:30] to straighten your hair if you've got it
[56:31] you know especially sisters you just try
[56:33] to look at certain things a rear view
[56:35] mirror you'll look at those different
[56:37] things why you need something that
[56:39] reflects the image so that you're able
[56:42] to care for or fix those things that are
[56:45] before you and this is what real the
[56:49] real ministering of the word does it
[56:51] doesn't start here and stop here but it
[56:54] can begin here but it continues with our
[56:57] life that's why after service is over
[57:00] it's not just like a meal at home where
[57:02] we just you know move our hands and
[57:04] throw down you know the napkin and say
[57:06] man that was a good meal it is a time of
[57:09] reflection
[57:10] it's where the word goes with us because
[57:13] the word is not a dead letter the word
[57:16] is a living person he's alive and he he
[57:20] searches out our life our desire is that
[57:23] our lives would be so pleasing to him
[57:27] and if there's anything out of the way
[57:29] we desire that it would be remedied with
[57:32] his word what has done that in our lives
[57:37] the love of god
[57:39] we can take no credit in that that is
[57:43] the love of god
[57:46] and that's a desire that it esteems his
[57:49] word this is this is where the real
[57:52] victory of the new birth comes in within
[57:55] our life
[57:57] and so when we look at this and we
[57:59] examine if i can just move right back
[58:01] into ephesians 5 and working to apply
[58:04] this here just of just a few moments
[58:06] here in ephesians 5 verse 21 the
[58:10] scripture said submitting yourselves one
[58:12] to another in the fear of god
[58:16] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[58:18] husbands as unto the lord
[58:22] for the husband is the head of the wife
[58:25] even as christ is the head of the church
[58:28] and he is the savior of the body
[58:32] therefore as christ as the church is
[58:35] subject unto christ so let the wives be
[58:38] to their own husbands in everything
[58:41] so let me just pause here for a moment
[58:44] the clear as we were looking on sunday
[58:47] the clear identification
[58:49] of the church because there's many
[58:51] churches but jesus never said he never
[58:54] said in his word will i find a church
[58:56] when i return
[58:57] he said in the book of jude will i find
[59:00] faith
[59:03] and it's not just faith because remember
[59:06] faith itself is believing there's a
[59:09] believing on and a believing in
[59:12] it's two differences but it starts with
[59:14] believing on him
[59:16] and his work to bring us to that place
[59:19] to where then we come in him by his
[59:22] sovereign grace then we're no longer
[59:23] believing on him we are believing in him
[59:26] that's security
[59:28] and so it's his life
[59:31] in the church of the living god that
[59:34] identifies
[59:35] his church his bride his wife
[59:40] because she's under his name which is
[59:43] his life his life being his character
[59:47] being his word i mean you could not
[59:49] think of the lord jesus having a wife
[59:52] that she looks into the word and says
[59:54] well i don't know that you know that was
[59:55] for days gone by that's not his wife he
[59:58] is god and he changes not
[1:00:01] is that right
[1:00:02] he cannot change he doesn't the bible as
[1:00:05] he said the word that's gone out of my
[1:00:07] mouth i will not alter it
[1:00:09] so we know that the identification of
[1:00:12] his wife of his church speaking in the
[1:00:15] spiritual level is one that reflects his
[1:00:19] his will his word his desires
[1:00:23] and that reflects the true oneness that
[1:00:27] was prayed for in john 17 that they
[1:00:31] might be one you see god does not want
[1:00:35] uh they're a divided opinion remember in
[1:00:37] the days of israel where some are
[1:00:40] worshiping bowel and they were
[1:00:41] worshiping jehovah too because a divided
[1:00:45] opinion
[1:00:46] a divided house there's not victory
[1:00:49] there
[1:00:49] and god's desire now let us look at what
[1:00:52] god's desire he could have taken bail he
[1:00:54] could or he could have taken all those
[1:00:56] prophets and he could have tried to lay
[1:00:58] everything out but how god has a way
[1:01:02] of dissolving the divided opinions and
[1:01:06] bringing real oneness is by a visitation
[1:01:10] of himself among his people
[1:01:14] god doesn't have to convince his people
[1:01:17] he just shows up the fire came from
[1:01:21] heaven
[1:01:22] it brought a reality among the children
[1:01:24] of god that which god had reserved for
[1:01:27] himself and what did he do it gave him
[1:01:30] courage to step out
[1:01:33] that of bowel the divided opinion was
[1:01:35] over with a visitation from god
[1:01:38] and i believe that with all my heart i
[1:01:40] hope you're understanding me now these
[1:01:42] are things friends these are principles
[1:01:45] in the word that it breaks on down into
[1:01:47] our life when you know
[1:01:49] when we look at it and we look at the
[1:01:51] word and where where we're to be in god
[1:01:54] but where we are in god is to reflect
[1:01:57] itself in our everyday life if it
[1:02:00] doesn't reflect itself in shoe leather
[1:02:03] then we're really not where we claim to
[1:02:05] be
[1:02:07] you see this is what paul is dealing
[1:02:09] with he deals with the warfare he deals
[1:02:12] with all this but yet paul is letting it
[1:02:14] be known if this isn't coming out on
[1:02:17] display then we're not where we need to
[1:02:19] be then we can we can look to god and
[1:02:22] say god let the fire fall
[1:02:25] amen let there be a dissolving let there
[1:02:28] be a consuming of the sacrifice o god i
[1:02:32] believe that if we're honest with god
[1:02:34] he'll come
[1:02:36] and never forget the statement brother
[1:02:38] branham made in the jehovah's gyrus
[1:02:40] series in grass valley of 1962 when he
[1:02:42] preached the three parts he took the
[1:02:44] last state and the last part and i never
[1:02:46] forgot this statement he said i'd like
[1:02:48] to come back here sometime and set up a
[1:02:50] tent he said because god has moved so
[1:02:53] wondrously right here and he's dealing
[1:02:55] with this point he said because there
[1:02:58] are people that's willing to be honest
[1:03:01] with god
[1:03:03] and he'll always come where hearts are
[1:03:06] honest god is not looking for let me
[1:03:08] find a church that's mistake free you
[1:03:11] can't find one unless it's the first
[1:03:12] church of the graveyard
[1:03:15] nobody complains of nobody there
[1:03:17] nobody offends nobody there are you with
[1:03:19] me
[1:03:20] but you see god's not interested in you
[1:03:22] and i being perfect he's perfect it's us
[1:03:26] coming into his perfect life under the
[1:03:30] perfect blood by a perfect holy ghost
[1:03:33] and then it's god working in our life
[1:03:35] his own perfection as he molds us and
[1:03:39] shapes
[1:03:40] our character
[1:03:42] to match his character
[1:03:44] that's god's working and boy i'll tell
[1:03:46] you what
[1:03:48] he's got a task
[1:03:51] but god knew what he was getting in for
[1:03:54] he knew what he was getting into
[1:03:57] husbands love your wives even as christ
[1:04:00] also loved the church and gave himself
[1:04:02] for it that he might
[1:04:04] sanctify
[1:04:06] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:04:10] by the word
[1:04:12] that he might present it to himself a
[1:04:15] glorious church not having spot or
[1:04:18] wrinkle or any such thing but then it
[1:04:19] should be holding without blemish let me
[1:04:21] just stop here just for a moment
[1:04:24] we look at these scriptures and as paul
[1:04:26] he's giving
[1:04:27] that what is the spiritual and to be the
[1:04:31] heavenly significance of christ
[1:04:34] and his bride because that was the type
[1:04:36] that there was the hidden mystery that
[1:04:38] was there in genesis 2 when god laid
[1:04:42] adam to sleep and he took out of adam's
[1:04:44] side that rib and began to multiply it
[1:04:47] then he divided there that masculine and
[1:04:50] feminine spirit and he placed that
[1:04:52] feminine spirit there within that of of
[1:04:55] the body he created and he brought them
[1:04:58] together in a holy union and they're in
[1:05:01] spirit there here they are united and
[1:05:04] god would say they are one flesh so god
[1:05:09] marriage is not the institution of man
[1:05:13] marriage is the institution of almighty
[1:05:16] god
[1:05:19] this is why paul could say in the book
[1:05:21] of hebrews marriage is
[1:05:24] honorable
[1:05:27] when you look at those scriptures there
[1:05:30] and we look at ourselves as husbands we
[1:05:32] say well i can see
[1:05:33] christ
[1:05:34] and that he himself
[1:05:36] is is indeed you know my sin bearer he's
[1:05:40] my burden bearer i can see that washing
[1:05:42] of water by the word my he's cleansed me
[1:05:45] he cleaned up my life he brought a
[1:05:47] change in my life he's sanctified and
[1:05:49] cleansed my life and he's the one that's
[1:05:52] brought me to a presentable state but if
[1:05:55] we can bring this and bring it on in
[1:05:57] even into the natural but at the same
[1:06:00] time taking back over to the spiritual
[1:06:02] how many of us in our lives that even
[1:06:04] after this uniting with the lord jesus
[1:06:07] christ that is the spirit of god begins
[1:06:10] to deal with our lives depending on your
[1:06:12] makeup and your temperament there's
[1:06:14] things that god will deal with complexes
[1:06:17] that have been about our life for years
[1:06:20] maybe things before god ever started
[1:06:23] dealing with our life things that were
[1:06:25] said to us in a certain way or ways that
[1:06:27] we were made to feel excluded you know
[1:06:29] we can go on and on but what does god do
[1:06:32] god doesn't sit there and say don't feel
[1:06:35] that way quit feeling that way but god
[1:06:37] knows how to provide what is needed in
[1:06:40] order to loosen that you see what god
[1:06:43] said i'm gonna show myself greater than
[1:06:46] that complex i'm gonna show myself
[1:06:49] greater than that hindrance and every
[1:06:51] one of the thoughts that you had about
[1:06:54] yourself this is why as a spiritual in
[1:06:56] psalms 45 where how would speak of the
[1:06:59] bride in christ and here david would
[1:07:02] write about it and he would speak of it
[1:07:04] in this manner he would speak that to
[1:07:06] the queen that she would forget the land
[1:07:09] of her nativity i tell you god in his
[1:07:12] mercy he moves in our lives not only to
[1:07:15] dismantle our past but he ministers to
[1:07:18] you and i to where you and i it's not
[1:07:20] that we've got bigger heads now but our
[1:07:23] confidence is in him we see our
[1:07:26] littleness our need of him in a greater
[1:07:28] way but he has not demeaned us he has
[1:07:31] not torn us down for our shortcomings
[1:07:34] but he's ministered to us in loving
[1:07:36] grace because he knows that we are but
[1:07:39] flesh
[1:07:41] are you with me he knows how to minister
[1:07:43] twilight there's not one of us in here
[1:07:46] that are free from faults
[1:07:48] now listen we're not talking about you
[1:07:50] know getting together and singing
[1:07:51] kumbaya and we all got sin in our life
[1:07:54] that's not what i'm talking about i'm
[1:07:56] talking about that there are faults
[1:07:58] there are mistakes there are things that
[1:08:00] we look at shortcomings there's
[1:08:02] weaknesses that are there in our life
[1:08:05] there's things that you look at in your
[1:08:06] life and say god i need strength lord i
[1:08:09] need strength and it isn't all together
[1:08:11] stripped out of your life but you know
[1:08:13] you need grace to rule over that in your
[1:08:15] life you can't let it get out of check
[1:08:17] and what does he do with his love he
[1:08:20] just doesn't come and say no uh
[1:08:23] don't do that shame on you he comes with
[1:08:26] his love to do what brings such grace
[1:08:29] that you and i might rise within his
[1:08:31] presence hey listen there's already
[1:08:34] fences of doubt and thought that try to
[1:08:36] separate you from the presence of
[1:08:39] almighty god but god's not interested so
[1:08:41] much in tearing down the fences he's
[1:08:44] interested in flooding our lives with
[1:08:46] his water so that the water rises above
[1:08:49] every division it rises above every
[1:08:52] thought that's what the coming of the
[1:08:54] holy ghost is all about brother it gives
[1:08:57] us strength to rise above our doubts
[1:09:02] oh my i'm glad he washes us aren't you
[1:09:05] i'm glad he keeps cleansing us i'm glad
[1:09:07] he keeps telling you and i i've always
[1:09:10] loved you i've always cared about you
[1:09:12] i've always watched over you
[1:09:14] you're the apple of my eye i've had you
[1:09:17] in mind all along you were in my great
[1:09:20] drama all along
[1:09:23] you know sometimes you look at it and
[1:09:25] say but lord you don't know what i'm
[1:09:26] going through he knows what you're going
[1:09:28] through but what he's trying to do is
[1:09:31] flood the situation
[1:09:34] with his love
[1:09:36] because there's nothing greater than the
[1:09:39] love of god
[1:09:40] brother we can try to figure things out
[1:09:43] like when brother adam stood there with
[1:09:45] that bull in that pasture it was not his
[1:09:48] intellect it was not his doing that
[1:09:51] undid that situation it was the love of
[1:09:54] god that came sovereignly down the same
[1:09:56] thing with the bees or the hornets that
[1:09:59] were there it came down within that
[1:10:01] sovereign time the maniac that was there
[1:10:04] over and over brother adam gives us
[1:10:05] examples of that you say brother samuel
[1:10:07] what are you saying i'm saying if we can
[1:10:09] just recognize of what has been placed
[1:10:12] within our hands and our lives the love
[1:10:16] of god and we can say lord i cannot win
[1:10:19] this battle on my own but the love of
[1:10:22] god is the greatest weapon that's ever
[1:10:25] been given to the church of the living
[1:10:27] god and lord by the love of god in my
[1:10:30] life i'm more
[1:10:32] than a conqueror
[1:10:36] you know a lot of these things even as i
[1:10:38] said within life itself
[1:10:41] god works to dismantle
[1:10:43] the complexes and other things in our
[1:10:45] life he he doesn't all you know god has
[1:10:47] such a way of dealing with things in our
[1:10:49] life and this is why brother brown would
[1:10:51] tell us over and over
[1:10:53] and he would give direction in the
[1:10:54] church age book and speak to as husbands
[1:10:57] pastors fathers and things like that and
[1:10:58] he would say
[1:10:59] god giving direction on even how to run
[1:11:02] our homes
[1:11:03] and he speaks of how in the ephesian age
[1:11:05] how christ praises his own remember in
[1:11:08] the ephesian age when he says i know thy
[1:11:10] works god would come with a rebuke but
[1:11:11] he would say i know thy works and how
[1:11:13] thou hatest them that that the works of
[1:11:15] the deeds of the nickelodeons brother
[1:11:17] braham said see we could learn something
[1:11:19] there on how to run our homes our
[1:11:20] churches and everything else christ
[1:11:23] praises his own he said he knows how to
[1:11:25] encourage us in the right matters and
[1:11:28] how to discourage us
[1:11:30] in the wrong matters
[1:11:32] he knows how to do that so well
[1:11:35] you know
[1:11:36] when he comes
[1:11:38] with his presence god works to dismantle
[1:11:42] holds upon our life you know we could
[1:11:45] just stay there all night and preach
[1:11:46] that and preach it for weeks but within
[1:11:48] that whole thing right there god works
[1:11:50] down into the depths of because a lot of
[1:11:52] complexes and things like that is
[1:11:54] subconscious it's things that's been
[1:11:55] placed and put within us that we don't
[1:11:57] even realize sometimes all the junk
[1:11:59] that's been packed within us
[1:12:01] is that right how many times did brother
[1:12:03] brown stand there on the platform now
[1:12:04] brother branham the angel of the lord
[1:12:06] would call out things if these things
[1:12:07] weren't important the holy ghost would
[1:12:09] have never called them out
[1:12:11] but how that you had a woman that was
[1:12:12] still dealing with fear brother that
[1:12:15] wasn't a fear isolated to dogs that was
[1:12:17] a fear that was affecting her for her
[1:12:19] healing in her own life it had troubled
[1:12:22] her and the spirit of god would care so
[1:12:25] much that he would go back in her life
[1:12:27] to where here she is as a little girl
[1:12:30] and she was chased by a dog when she got
[1:12:32] off the school bus even the color of her
[1:12:34] dress was called out why because god
[1:12:38] cares about that that needed to be
[1:12:40] exposed how the enemy had wanted to put
[1:12:43] that mark upon her life but jesus came
[1:12:46] along
[1:12:47] and the lord jesus pointed out that hold
[1:12:50] within our life
[1:12:52] see god over and over god's mindful of
[1:12:54] these things
[1:12:55] and i'm just going to be honest we know
[1:12:57] that god knows exactly how to do things
[1:12:59] there's things that you and i can look
[1:13:01] at one another and listen let me just
[1:13:03] tell you something friends you know the
[1:13:05] moment that we start looking at things
[1:13:06] through the eyes of our human
[1:13:08] understanding is the moment we get
[1:13:10] anxious and frustrated because you
[1:13:12] realize you can't do it
[1:13:16] any situation we look at but remember
[1:13:19] this is not a flesh and blood affair
[1:13:22] there are things that absolutely as
[1:13:24] we're looking at where the word has to
[1:13:26] be lived through our flesh but it must
[1:13:30] be under the orchestration of the love
[1:13:33] of almighty god
[1:13:38] my my my my
[1:13:40] well that was free
[1:13:42] we could spend more time on that but i'm
[1:13:44] glad that god moves down to dismantle
[1:13:46] those holes aren't you
[1:13:48] i'm glad i'm glad he's still doing that
[1:13:51] i'm glad he's still doing that right
[1:13:53] there
[1:13:54] because god he oh my i just got to keep
[1:13:56] going he is the
[1:13:59] you know what the amen i know i know
[1:14:01] some of us boy we pride ourselves on the
[1:14:03] final word but he is the final
[1:14:07] in this age he revealed himself as the a
[1:14:12] man is that right
[1:14:15] and so we look back as it said in isaiah
[1:14:18] that we are to bless ourselves in the
[1:14:21] god of truth which is the god of the
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:24] and that is to receive from god it's not
[1:14:27] what somebody else has said it's not
[1:14:29] even what your thoughts about yourself
[1:14:32] what should i do take what god is saying
[1:14:35] about you through the word and look to
[1:14:38] him and say god i'm gonna stand on your
[1:14:41] word what you're saying about me
[1:14:44] are you with me
[1:14:46] you see this is where this is where it
[1:14:48] comes down
[1:14:49] even in our lives and this is this is a
[1:14:52] what a responsibility when we look at
[1:14:54] this chapter and we bring it out into
[1:14:56] the natural and i i say that in this
[1:14:58] manner that when we bring it out into
[1:15:01] the natural lives and things like that
[1:15:02] there's times that there are things that
[1:15:04] begin to become uncovered whether it's a
[1:15:06] complex or whether it's this thing right
[1:15:08] here well i'm not good at this or i'm
[1:15:10] not good at that but god in his grace
[1:15:13] and even as a husband in the natural can
[1:15:16] look to god and let the love of god so
[1:15:18] flow in our life
[1:15:20] to let god move and work to bring about
[1:15:24] the confidence
[1:15:26] the dismissing
[1:15:27] of the complexes and things that can be
[1:15:30] ever present there
[1:15:31] are you hearing me
[1:15:33] went a little quiet there
[1:15:36] but listen this word became flesh
[1:15:40] amen and when it became flesh
[1:15:43] now it yielded water and that water now
[1:15:46] is the nourishment for the seeds that
[1:15:48] were upon the earth
[1:15:49] the same way that word becomes flesh in
[1:15:52] us now if we allow that word to have
[1:15:55] free course it'll bring nourishment you
[1:15:57] see god is not the author of confusion
[1:15:59] god knows how to arrange everything
[1:16:02] together so it complements all of his
[1:16:05] great sovereignty we wouldn't even maybe
[1:16:08] you know if we were even looking at our
[1:16:09] assembly we wouldn't even put this
[1:16:12] together thank god he didn't leave it up
[1:16:14] to us but god's the one that's put us
[1:16:16] together
[1:16:18] god's the one that's assembled this
[1:16:19] congregation together
[1:16:21] god knows what each and every one of us
[1:16:24] the part within our life you might say
[1:16:26] my part but there's a part that you have
[1:16:29] to play just as much as there's a part
[1:16:31] that i have to play and we need one
[1:16:34] another
[1:16:40] lord that cannot be said enough
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:43] verse 28 my goodness
[1:16:46] so want men to love their wives as their
[1:16:48] own bodies
[1:16:50] that's pretty straight
[1:16:52] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[1:16:55] now
[1:16:57] we're living in an age where the the
[1:16:58] scripture prophesied men shall be
[1:17:01] lovers of
[1:17:03] themselves
[1:17:05] i mean you don't have to what this is an
[1:17:07] age of
[1:17:13] it's all that
[1:17:16] let me hear it
[1:17:17] selfies
[1:17:19] right i never forget when brother rose
[1:17:21] tell roe el soriano i don't know how
[1:17:22] many years ago and you know when he said
[1:17:25] my said when was it he said that all of
[1:17:27] a sudden you come out with this term
[1:17:29] self ease
[1:17:31] let me think of it now listen this is
[1:17:33] not a doctrine that if you take a selfie
[1:17:35] of yourself your
[1:17:36] you understand what i'm saying all right
[1:17:39] but we realize we're in a time
[1:17:42] that when the bible says men is talking
[1:17:45] mankind
[1:17:46] will be lovers of themselves
[1:17:51] where in reality you know here we are we
[1:17:53] are put into a place in a challenge
[1:17:57] where god deals with our lives as
[1:17:59] believers to come to a place where we
[1:18:01] lose sight of ourselves and submitting
[1:18:04] ourselves unto the lord this is all
[1:18:07] god's orchestration his working to bring
[1:18:10] us to a place of a new birth
[1:18:13] and then the new birth on the inside the
[1:18:16] love of god working in our lives because
[1:18:19] now
[1:18:20] it's not a war on the inside that war
[1:18:23] has ended
[1:18:25] this ground has been cleaned are you
[1:18:27] with me no longer two masters and
[1:18:29] struggling but that ground has been
[1:18:31] claimed our desire is to live for him
[1:18:34] but as paul said in romans 7 when i
[1:18:36] would go to do good
[1:18:38] evil is present
[1:18:41] is that right we recognize a war that we
[1:18:45] never experienced before
[1:18:48] but let me remind you greater is he amen
[1:18:51] that is in you than he that's in the
[1:18:53] world
[1:18:55] as i write
[1:18:57] oh my
[1:18:58] he beloveth his wife loveth himself
[1:19:02] because it is to be one within interest
[1:19:05] you know when we look at even for a man
[1:19:08] as he would
[1:19:10] take this and really take it to heart
[1:19:12] when a man in himself
[1:19:15] his the kindness that he would show
[1:19:18] to his wife
[1:19:19] is more than repaid you see everything
[1:19:22] and you realize these are not things
[1:19:24] that's all together come about up in
[1:19:26] society right now these are seeds things
[1:19:29] we see now
[1:19:30] are seeds that were sown years ago
[1:19:33] are you with me and remember if god
[1:19:35] tarries
[1:19:36] there will be seeds come out
[1:19:39] that will be sown
[1:19:40] and what does it do it further shows a
[1:19:43] degradation it further souls and evil
[1:19:46] but if that's the case there
[1:19:48] what about in this hour where the word
[1:19:50] comes to fruition in our life and
[1:19:52] there's a harvest
[1:19:54] there's a nourishing and then it sows
[1:19:56] back
[1:19:58] so there's there's a law of contrast
[1:20:00] that's going on is that right
[1:20:02] so then when we when we see this that
[1:20:05] what what is is actually sown there the
[1:20:08] kindness to to the wife it's more than
[1:20:11] repaid by the happiness that she will
[1:20:14] impart
[1:20:15] all the real care and concern that he
[1:20:18] chose to make her happy
[1:20:20] and that's a big that's a big statement
[1:20:23] it will come to more
[1:20:25] than what it actually costs
[1:20:28] you know
[1:20:29] when a man wants to really promote
[1:20:32] his own happiness in a real most
[1:20:34] effectual way
[1:20:36] it's where he actually
[1:20:38] does so by showing kindness to his wife
[1:20:42] and kindness itself just this is just
[1:20:44] the beginning of it kindness is to be
[1:20:47] friendly
[1:20:48] is to be generous
[1:20:50] it's to be considerate
[1:20:52] this is these are all parts of what
[1:20:54] charity really is right
[1:20:57] you see these are all parts
[1:20:59] of the fruit of the spirit
[1:21:03] that's why i said if if
[1:21:05] paul is dealing with this here in
[1:21:07] ephesians 5
[1:21:09] he is in ephesians chapter 1 oh he's
[1:21:12] preached the adoption oh you're in
[1:21:15] christ jesus you are chosen before the
[1:21:18] foundation of the world then he has to
[1:21:20] deal with ephesians 5 to show to them
[1:21:23] that you can't pretend or laugh as
[1:21:26] though you're living so high up here
[1:21:27] that it doesn't reflect in your natural
[1:21:29] life
[1:21:30] it must allow it must be reflected in
[1:21:34] our natural life
[1:21:35] and it takes god's grace it takes the
[1:21:38] grace of god to do that us blessing lord
[1:21:41] help me
[1:21:43] strengthen me lord
[1:21:44] in these areas of my life because i
[1:21:46] believe that every every child of god
[1:21:49] desires to grow
[1:21:51] in the grace and knowledge of almighty
[1:21:53] god
[1:21:54] the bible says in first corinthians 7 3
[1:21:57] and this is a part and i'm going to take
[1:21:58] this scripture out of where paul is
[1:22:00] dealing with the marital relationship
[1:22:03] but it plays a part within this first
[1:22:05] corinthians 7 3 let the husband render
[1:22:08] unto the wife due benevolence and
[1:22:12] likewise also the wife unto
[1:22:15] the husband so notice the husband
[1:22:19] rendered to benevolence what is the
[1:22:21] kindness the good will what is due to
[1:22:25] her
[1:22:26] that is what is to be rendered unto her
[1:22:30] and so notice then or then that is
[1:22:32] likewise the wife unto the husband how
[1:22:36] do you and i love the lord
[1:22:39] he'll never accept our love
[1:22:42] we love him
[1:22:44] because he first loved us
[1:22:46] it's his love reflecting back to him
[1:22:49] what is it that holds us when the
[1:22:51] scripture says charity never faileth
[1:22:55] prophecies fail
[1:22:58] all these other things fail
[1:23:01] but charity never
[1:23:04] fails is that right
[1:23:07] so then what is it that reflects back
[1:23:10] because as god himself in the beginning
[1:23:13] when the fall even when the fall took
[1:23:16] place god never just wiped his hands and
[1:23:18] said oh my goodness i can't believe but
[1:23:21] his love is what drove and brought him
[1:23:24] down to whereas brother brown would
[1:23:26] describe it he spelled out l-o-v-e when
[1:23:29] he spoke the announcement of the coming
[1:23:32] of a seed that'll bruise the head of the
[1:23:34] serpent i'll give her a seed what was it
[1:23:37] that brought that utterance the love of
[1:23:40] almighty god
[1:23:42] that was christ right there reflected
[1:23:44] from the mind in the heart of almighty
[1:23:46] god reflected i will make a way back
[1:23:52] all the way down through the old
[1:23:54] testament shadows and types and glimpses
[1:23:56] of god's faithfulness and prophecy and
[1:23:59] everything that was laid out there all
[1:24:01] the way through it was the love of god
[1:24:03] that was on display all the way through
[1:24:06] in every scenario in every test every
[1:24:09] trial that was you could go through each
[1:24:11] one that may come to your mind right now
[1:24:13] when they face the greatness of the test
[1:24:16] or trial what was it that prevailed in
[1:24:20] that moment
[1:24:21] the love of god
[1:24:23] amen
[1:24:27] our love
[1:24:29] filial love
[1:24:31] this is all we can get to
[1:24:33] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:24:36] is that right the bible said god is love
[1:24:39] any man loved the world the love of god
[1:24:41] is not in him
[1:24:43] the love of god is the holy ghost
[1:24:46] right god's life quickened in that word
[1:24:49] so then what is reflected back to our
[1:24:52] life is the love of god so what is he
[1:24:55] seeing he's seeing his own love
[1:24:57] reflected back to himself
[1:25:03] you say brother samuel i feel like i
[1:25:04] love him less we always are in that
[1:25:06] place of the lord i want to love you
[1:25:08] more lord i want to love you more one
[1:25:10] has done that the love of god has its
[1:25:12] moving in our life and notice it's his
[1:25:15] love on display
[1:25:19] oh my see there's a law of harvest let
[1:25:22] me just say that mutual kindness and
[1:25:25] good will it's reflected or reciprocated
[1:25:28] back there's a law of harvest
[1:25:30] in in galatians 6 7 let me refer to this
[1:25:32] quickly
[1:25:33] be not deceived god is not mocked
[1:25:37] for whatsoever a man soweth that shall
[1:25:40] he also reap for he that soweth to his
[1:25:43] flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption
[1:25:47] but he that soweth to the spirit shall
[1:25:49] of the spirit reap life everlasting
[1:25:55] i don't consider investing in our family
[1:25:57] i'm not talking about well we're going
[1:25:59] to go on a family vacation and you know
[1:26:02] brother samuel we're just you know we're
[1:26:03] just going to invest in our family and
[1:26:05] not go to the house of god
[1:26:07] come on now that's not spiritual that's
[1:26:09] fleshly
[1:26:11] i'm going to preach it anyway
[1:26:14] you see in order for think god intended
[1:26:17] remember what he said to peter peter do
[1:26:19] you love me i love you you know the
[1:26:20] stories it keeps on going and what he
[1:26:22] said if thou loved me
[1:26:24] feed my
[1:26:26] sheep
[1:26:27] so part of the expression of the love of
[1:26:29] god that would come in peter's life is
[1:26:32] he would feed his sheep but not only the
[1:26:34] sheep feed my lambs
[1:26:37] so sometimes the things that we can look
[1:26:39] at within life of oh to be busy with
[1:26:42] this but remember eternal life is living
[1:26:47] for others
[1:26:50] brother branham would say it so clearly
[1:26:51] a person who lives them life for
[1:26:52] themselves lives a selfish
[1:26:55] life
[1:26:57] thank god for the new birth that
[1:26:58] delivers us from selfishness
[1:27:00] gives us a strength on the inside to
[1:27:02] bring that man down
[1:27:04] is that right ah you're not rising up
[1:27:07] here i know where you're going i know
[1:27:08] that fool that pool i know that
[1:27:11] are you with me
[1:27:14] oh my so whatsoever a man saw it that
[1:27:17] shall he also reap i mean you can't you
[1:27:19] can't show you can't sew
[1:27:22] you can't sow
[1:27:23] the you know oranges and expect to come
[1:27:26] out with apples
[1:27:28] you can't sow harsh words and expect
[1:27:30] kindness to come
[1:27:33] preach brother samuel
[1:27:35] amen let's just let god just say god
[1:27:38] just invite him
[1:27:39] see god's not mocked so we know there's
[1:27:42] a law of harvest now listen to me now
[1:27:46] it does not mean that oh brother samuel
[1:27:49] you got now listen to me now get out of
[1:27:51] the way of a track of thought of oh you
[1:27:53] don't know the seeds that's been sown
[1:27:55] let me just tell you something you can't
[1:27:57] do away with what's been sown but you
[1:27:59] can sow seed that will counteract the
[1:28:00] effect of the negative seed
[1:28:02] you've got a choice you're not well
[1:28:04] there ain't no choice no there's a
[1:28:06] choice
[1:28:07] esther came before the king of hazard
[1:28:09] and said hey tell them to stop this they
[1:28:12] can't destroy my people
[1:28:14] he said i'm god i cannot be mocked
[1:28:16] whatsoever man soweth that shall i also
[1:28:18] reap you know i pulled the blessing that
[1:28:19] in there but he said what i will tell
[1:28:20] you to do you tell your people to arm
[1:28:22] themselves and they go at it the day
[1:28:24] before is that right so we can't undo it
[1:28:27] oh i'm gonna take a shovel and like
[1:28:29] we're searching for land mines forget
[1:28:30] that sow the good seed because the good
[1:28:33] seed has life within it it'll counteract
[1:28:36] the effects of the bad seed
[1:28:39] is that right right oh my god's not a
[1:28:42] god who dwells upon keeping you in your
[1:28:44] past that's a devil that's right did you
[1:28:47] hear me
[1:28:48] god does not delight in keeping you in
[1:28:49] your past that's defeat that's the devil
[1:28:52] god desires that you go forward sure
[1:28:54] recognize where shortcomings are but
[1:28:56] part of overcoming is recognizing where
[1:28:58] we are and where we need to be and the
[1:29:00] grace to ascend to that place
[1:29:04] second corinthians 9 6 i say this he
[1:29:07] that soweth
[1:29:08] sparingly shall also reap sparingly
[1:29:12] he that soweth bountifully shall also
[1:29:14] reap bountifully
[1:29:16] see it's what you invest that's right
[1:29:20] these are things
[1:29:21] as
[1:29:22] you know these are not scriptures that
[1:29:24] are limited to taking up offerings
[1:29:28] come on we're not carnal people we're
[1:29:29] spiritual
[1:29:30] we recognize these script scriptures
[1:29:32] have compound meanings
[1:29:34] the spirit of god in our lives brings it
[1:29:36] down to a place that we recognize what
[1:29:38] you sow sparingly you'll reap sparingly
[1:29:39] but whatever you you sow bountifully
[1:29:42] you'll reap bountifully
[1:29:43] if the word if the word is sowed
[1:29:45] sparingly it's a sparing crop
[1:29:48] are you with me but if the word is sold
[1:29:50] bountifully there's a bountiful crop
[1:29:54] is that right
[1:29:55] this is why it's in this is why as it's
[1:29:58] important that the word be ministered
[1:30:00] the word be sown the word be received
[1:30:02] the word be prayed over and the word say
[1:30:05] god let the word be alive within my life
[1:30:08] just let me just bring this down into
[1:30:10] layman's terms
[1:30:12] if you don't invest in your wife
[1:30:16] you don't invest in your family don't
[1:30:18] expect to reap anything
[1:30:21] kids do not come here with autopilot
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] are you with me
[1:30:26] just coming to the altar and saying i do
[1:30:28] not listen i'm not you understand what
[1:30:30] i'm saying i'm these things are just as
[1:30:32] i'm standing here these are things that
[1:30:34] we recognize it's it's things that we
[1:30:37] are invested in it's love that brings us
[1:30:40] to this place but now circumstances of
[1:30:44] life
[1:30:45] miscommunications misunderstandings
[1:30:48] anybody like being misunderstood
[1:30:52] i'm glad you didn't say i don't like
[1:30:54] being misunderstood and even of the
[1:30:56] times that maybe let's say that i could
[1:30:58] say my how how was this misunderstood or
[1:31:01] how and we can try to
[1:31:02] make our point of the misunderstanding
[1:31:06] no good
[1:31:09] you're wasting energy
[1:31:13] what needs to be done sow the right
[1:31:16] things
[1:31:18] sow the right things
[1:31:21] to where there are things as it comes
[1:31:23] about
[1:31:24] within within our life as the scripture
[1:31:27] would go on to say every man according
[1:31:30] as he perpets in his heart so let him
[1:31:32] give not grudgingly but of necessity
[1:31:37] there's things that you know and you
[1:31:39] should know
[1:31:41] what's the delight
[1:31:43] of your wife and what's the delight of
[1:31:45] your husband
[1:31:48] you should know that
[1:31:50] are you with me
[1:31:51] and i know sometimes you know
[1:31:54] you continue to grow
[1:31:56] within that you don't you know
[1:31:58] my i'm just i'm just getting all ahead
[1:32:00] of myself here but we're just going to
[1:32:01] preach with it
[1:32:04] you see we learn as we grow
[1:32:07] sometimes you can think i'm doing the
[1:32:09] right things
[1:32:10] and and and you might be doing they're
[1:32:13] good things but it's not going in the
[1:32:15] right channel
[1:32:16] you know i'm saying it isn't that it's
[1:32:18] wrong things it's just you know i'm
[1:32:19] doing this but see you're not i'm not
[1:32:21] seeing any results out of it and then
[1:32:23] you see things that all the confusion
[1:32:26] that comes about and misunderstandings
[1:32:28] and all these things and it just things
[1:32:30] just continue to build to where things
[1:32:33] are being done but it's being done
[1:32:35] grudgingly
[1:32:37] he likes this she likes this
[1:32:41] well by the time you've got to suffer
[1:32:46] nowhere in the scriptures in ephesians 5
[1:32:48] you find me the word suffer
[1:32:51] see we we look at as though marriage
[1:32:54] should be or well it's a suffering no
[1:32:56] remember it was his love
[1:32:58] that caused him to lay down his life
[1:33:02] it's a
[1:33:03] sacrifice not a suffering
[1:33:06] are you with me there's times we have to
[1:33:08] suffer in other relationships maybe at a
[1:33:11] job and there's things that we have to
[1:33:12] lay our lives down and say lord help me
[1:33:15] in this but you see within a marriage
[1:33:17] it's not a suffering god never intended
[1:33:19] it to be a suffering it's a sacrifice
[1:33:24] are you
[1:33:25] are you with me i don't have my glasses
[1:33:26] on so i can't see your faces
[1:33:29] this is why in romans 12 he would speak
[1:33:32] of how that we are to present our bodies
[1:33:36] as a living
[1:33:38] sacrifice
[1:33:40] think about it
[1:33:41] it's not
[1:33:42] it's not a suffering on our part to live
[1:33:45] for god
[1:33:47] is there times of suffering in our body
[1:33:50] yes in our body but inwardly
[1:33:53] yes we have fellowship amen
[1:33:56] are you with me
[1:33:57] because he said
[1:33:59] through sickness
[1:34:01] and sorrow
[1:34:03] these are the vows
[1:34:04] that the holy spirit has placed upon my
[1:34:06] life that whether in health or in
[1:34:09] sickness whether in good times or bad
[1:34:12] times i'm faithful
[1:34:16] is that right so god loves a cheerful
[1:34:21] giver so there's things that we have to
[1:34:24] look and say god help me to find
[1:34:26] the right
[1:34:28] channels
[1:34:29] i know as i speak to a lot of times you
[1:34:31] know we're speaking to those that's been
[1:34:33] married for some time these are things
[1:34:36] that you recognize that
[1:34:38] you you
[1:34:39] you you don't try to just find these
[1:34:41] things out on your own and move around
[1:34:43] them you ask
[1:34:46] right
[1:34:47] you ask questions
[1:34:49] okay okay
[1:34:51] so i thought this about this helped me
[1:34:52] to understand right because evidently
[1:34:55] it's like i'm pouring water down an
[1:34:57] empty bucket
[1:34:58] and there's a hole at the bottom of it
[1:35:00] so tell me where the bucket is where
[1:35:01] it's got the bottom in it so when i'm
[1:35:02] pouring the water i'm making sure the
[1:35:04] water's getting in the bucket
[1:35:05] are you with me
[1:35:07] not just but i'm because otherwise we
[1:35:09] get frustrated by our own i'm pouring
[1:35:11] water i'm pouring water i'm doing this
[1:35:13] i'm doing that i'm doing that
[1:35:15] but it's missing the channel
[1:35:18] is that right it's just like when we
[1:35:20] look at there's a lot of things that a
[1:35:21] person can do
[1:35:23] for god but if you're not doing it in
[1:35:25] the right channel
[1:35:26] it's not even reckoned to your account
[1:35:29] right if it's not done out of love it's
[1:35:30] not even done out of our it's not even
[1:35:32] the right account
[1:35:33] is that right so we want we want to
[1:35:35] always find the channel of god that's
[1:35:37] why even in the purpose of god for our
[1:35:39] life we must find the purpose of god in
[1:35:41] our life
[1:35:42] and operate within that purpose right
[1:35:45] brother brown tells a man and i mean i'm
[1:35:47] i'm off here but i believe i'm on but
[1:35:50] brother brown tells it tells a brother
[1:35:52] this brother's a good singer he tells
[1:35:54] the brother he said brother he said i
[1:35:55] believe that's your purpose and calling
[1:35:57] in life if you'll just yield to it god
[1:35:58] will use you
[1:36:00] the brother had been kind of struggling
[1:36:02] what his purpose was but brother branham
[1:36:04] calls her right out he's just coming up
[1:36:05] there and he says brother he says i
[1:36:06] believe if you yield to that that's your
[1:36:08] purpose to sing
[1:36:10] sing the songs of the gospel that's what
[1:36:12] god that's a calling if you'll just
[1:36:14] yield to it god will use you
[1:36:16] you see these are things when we look at
[1:36:18] channels and avenues and every one of us
[1:36:21] are different this is why listen to me
[1:36:24] it's good to have examples in the
[1:36:26] assembly
[1:36:28] we must be
[1:36:30] it must start even from the pastor and
[1:36:32] his wife and it must be through the
[1:36:34] assembly of good relationships of
[1:36:38] husbands and wives are you with me
[1:36:40] it must be there because the scripture
[1:36:42] tells us you take a take a man who's a
[1:36:44] pastor if his house is so divided he
[1:36:47] don't have no business standing here
[1:36:50] preach brother sam i'm preaching from
[1:36:51] the word
[1:36:53] because it's to be an example it's to be
[1:36:56] what is there
[1:36:58] is that right but how much greater is to
[1:37:00] see the work the gospel it'll work and
[1:37:04] it'll produce these things
[1:37:06] in the lives of the people
[1:37:09] what a great example that it is to be
[1:37:13] able to see these things
[1:37:15] on display
[1:37:17] let me just let me read here just a few
[1:37:19] a few places here
[1:37:21] first corinthians 7.
[1:37:24] let me just read this first corinthians
[1:37:26] 7
[1:37:31] 7 32
[1:37:32] paul said he that is unmarried cared for
[1:37:34] the things that belong to the lord how
[1:37:36] he may please the lord but he that is
[1:37:38] married care for the things that are of
[1:37:40] the world how he may please his wife
[1:37:42] paul's not saying once you get married
[1:37:44] you become worldly
[1:37:46] you've got more cares see before that
[1:37:48] time
[1:37:49] when you wanted to pray you could go
[1:37:51] pray
[1:37:54] you say you know what
[1:37:55] i'm going to take time and
[1:37:57] i'm going to go away and i'm going to go
[1:37:59] away and just pray ain't nobody he had
[1:38:01] nobody to check in with
[1:38:04] you he had nobody to
[1:38:08] these are things you have to start
[1:38:09] looking at and caring
[1:38:12] things you have to look at that and
[1:38:14] and concerned but let me just remind you
[1:38:17] these are not things that are worldly
[1:38:20] neither
[1:38:21] is it becoming less spiritual
[1:38:25] let me finish this
[1:38:28] there is a difference also between a
[1:38:30] wife and a virgin the unmarried woman
[1:38:32] care for the things of the lord that she
[1:38:34] may be holy both in body and in spirit
[1:38:38] but she that is married care for the
[1:38:40] things of the world how she may
[1:38:42] please her
[1:38:44] husband
[1:38:46] so
[1:38:47] god would not place something in our
[1:38:49] life
[1:38:50] marriage is honorable it's of god god
[1:38:52] would not place something in our life
[1:38:54] that would be a hindrance
[1:38:57] is that right god will not god will not
[1:39:00] he will not work against himself he will
[1:39:03] not place something in our life that
[1:39:05] would be that of a hindrance but yet
[1:39:08] remember how peter would write this of a
[1:39:10] husband and wife relationship that we
[1:39:13] are heirs together of the grace of life
[1:39:18] is that right
[1:39:19] when brother branham went up to stand
[1:39:21] there in the vision before the lord
[1:39:24] here they came with him
[1:39:26] is that right
[1:39:28] hope immediate they came with him
[1:39:30] his first wife that had passed on right
[1:39:32] and then and then the other and they
[1:39:34] went up there they were associated
[1:39:37] together in this life
[1:39:41] now that pleasing is to strive and to
[1:39:44] accommodate ourselves to one another's
[1:39:47] opinions desires and interests
[1:39:50] this is that's the meaning of police to
[1:39:52] strive
[1:39:53] to please
[1:39:55] and you know
[1:39:57] i'm i'm not i know i'm out of time here
[1:40:01] so we just we just wrap this up
[1:40:05] i know it's a news flash
[1:40:07] in this day and age
[1:40:09] but in the beginning
[1:40:10] god made them male and female
[1:40:18] simon what are you saying well
[1:40:19] that there are things that how that
[1:40:22] the wife
[1:40:24] looks at things and will look a little
[1:40:26] different than the husband does
[1:40:28] and the husband's going to look at
[1:40:29] things different
[1:40:31] than the wife does
[1:40:34] oh brother samuel that's real carnal no
[1:40:36] it's not
[1:40:37] right in the scripture when god placed
[1:40:39] israel i don't have time to preach this
[1:40:42] but when god placed israel into the land
[1:40:44] every one of those tribes had a certain
[1:40:47] quality
[1:40:48] some were cattle razors some were over
[1:40:51] oil are you with me some are over baked
[1:40:54] baked goods come on now all these things
[1:40:55] god placed them in a certain way
[1:40:58] and if you ask a certain tribe how to
[1:41:00] look at something they would look at it
[1:41:02] through the perspective of their
[1:41:03] placement
[1:41:05] are you with me god never expected judah
[1:41:08] to look at things as levi looked at
[1:41:10] things or as ephraim looked at things or
[1:41:12] as manasseh no god placed them
[1:41:14] accordingly in his body
[1:41:17] and god has placed us accordingly in his
[1:41:20] body even with all of our peculiarities
[1:41:24] now it's true sometimes our opinions
[1:41:27] our desires our interests sometimes we
[1:41:30] can have some lofty things and god has
[1:41:32] to bring him right back in the word
[1:41:35] he's faithful to do that
[1:41:38] god's knowing with the desires that we
[1:41:41] would have
[1:41:42] in him
[1:41:43] and that's the same thing when we look
[1:41:45] at that even with a husband and wife and
[1:41:48] that's why i come back even to that
[1:41:49] point sometimes you can look at things
[1:41:51] and you can
[1:41:53] look at these scriptures in ephesians 5
[1:41:55] and you could think i don't feel like
[1:41:57] i'm making any traction on any ground
[1:41:58] because i believe that every one of us
[1:42:00] no matter how old we are
[1:42:03] i believe that we
[1:42:05] can grow
[1:42:07] grow
[1:42:08] and grow
[1:42:09] in these scriptures
[1:42:11] i believe it's god's desire that this
[1:42:13] word would be fruition in our life
[1:42:16] let me just say this to you
[1:42:18] don't
[1:42:19] when has the word is coming forth god
[1:42:21] knows you would be here he knows i would
[1:42:23] be here
[1:42:24] god knew this time even these things
[1:42:26] that would come out in this season i
[1:42:29] sure didn't see it but god's seen it
[1:42:32] so if god seen that knew that you and i
[1:42:34] would be here i'll tell you what i do i
[1:42:36] just reach up and just what i'm going to
[1:42:38] do lord thank you for your grace i just
[1:42:41] want to take it down in my life and lord
[1:42:43] as i take it and i chew on it teach me
[1:42:48] teach me lord
[1:42:50] teach me lord in my life
[1:42:53] and in my walk
[1:42:55] because god knows he cares
[1:42:57] he cares i want you to think about this
[1:42:59] one god knows remember the scripture
[1:43:02] says he knows his sheep by name
[1:43:05] yet you and i look as all sheep
[1:43:08] yeah they're all sheep white wool
[1:43:12] but he says i know him by name
[1:43:15] you know
[1:43:17] you can walk in we were
[1:43:19] i grew up there on on on a sheep farm
[1:43:22] and you'd walk out there
[1:43:24] and uh the man who
[1:43:27] you know you could walk right in the
[1:43:28] barn and the man would come out this guy
[1:43:30] could pick out the different sheet to me
[1:43:31] they all look the same
[1:43:33] yeah one might be fatter than the other
[1:43:34] in this one but you all look the same
[1:43:36] sheep
[1:43:39] god knows each of us by name brother
[1:43:41] simon what are you saying he knows
[1:43:44] our peculiarities
[1:43:47] god knows how to deal personally
[1:43:50] with each of us
[1:43:51] once you think about this think about
[1:43:53] how god knows how to deal with us
[1:43:57] there was a lady who needed
[1:43:59] a healing touch in her body
[1:44:04] her daddy had passed on
[1:44:07] she did not know about brother branham
[1:44:09] didn't even know brother branham was in
[1:44:10] town
[1:44:12] but her dad this is scripture remember
[1:44:15] joel 2
[1:44:16] ephesians are first corinthians 12.
[1:44:19] here she is she lays down on the bed
[1:44:20] she's wore out from cleaning she was
[1:44:22] cleaning houses
[1:44:23] she lays on the bed and goes to sleep
[1:44:27] and god sends her a dream
[1:44:30] of her daddy that's passed on
[1:44:32] and her daddy tells her
[1:44:35] go to a certain certain address
[1:44:38] and be there at this time
[1:44:41] for your healing
[1:44:45] god didn't have to do it that way are
[1:44:48] you understanding me god's not an iron
[1:44:51] fist
[1:44:53] it's a standard of the word but god
[1:44:56] brings his word not compromising it but
[1:44:59] god knows how to get our attention he
[1:45:02] knows just how to speak to our life and
[1:45:04] god could have used anybody but he knew
[1:45:07] it would have an impact if he sent her
[1:45:11] daddy because what her daddy was a
[1:45:13] methodist minister and had a lot of
[1:45:16] respect for him and she
[1:45:18] got up not knowing where that address
[1:45:21] was but she began to ask questions long
[1:45:23] story short she made it to the meeting
[1:45:26] to the place she had to ask a few people
[1:45:29] in order to get there it wasn't
[1:45:31] something she stepped out of the bed and
[1:45:32] she morphed there it was a lot of things
[1:45:35] that she had to go through but she got
[1:45:37] there
[1:45:38] and god
[1:45:40] healed her
[1:45:45] say that because if god would care so
[1:45:47] much
[1:45:48] about the little details
[1:45:51] of our life
[1:45:53] knowing little things that we like
[1:45:56] i mean some people don't like mountains
[1:45:58] some people don't like planes some
[1:46:00] people you know some people like the
[1:46:01] desert some people like
[1:46:06] god knows the things that you would like
[1:46:09] and he placed him here
[1:46:11] upon this earth
[1:46:16] and how much more has he prepared for
[1:46:18] our
[1:46:19] the way
[1:46:21] for our heavenly home
[1:46:23] how much more did he prepare a way for
[1:46:25] you and i
[1:46:26] to come
[1:46:28] into a real relationship with him how
[1:46:30] much more
[1:46:31] if he went and he prepared
[1:46:34] for you and i how much more than when we
[1:46:36] look at it for husband and wife and this
[1:46:38] example and how that we are to conduct
[1:46:41] our lives how much more if he cares that
[1:46:43] much
[1:46:44] how much
[1:46:46] should we care and say god
[1:46:48] help me
[1:46:50] teach me lord
[1:46:52] teach me
[1:46:53] because
[1:46:54] i tell you the very thing i'm just i'll
[1:46:56] just speak very plainly the desire
[1:46:58] of my heart
[1:47:00] oh
[1:47:00] it's not a question whether i have my
[1:47:02] wife's heart or not but i want to i want
[1:47:04] to continue to win her heart
[1:47:08] i don't say that for any i'd say that
[1:47:10] that's the truth
[1:47:11] and there's a lot of things
[1:47:14] there's a lot of things
[1:47:15] that god's had to teach me
[1:47:17] and he's still teaching
[1:47:20] a lot of things
[1:47:21] i'm
[1:47:23] doug honestly
[1:47:27] there's some things that i'll just give
[1:47:29] you a little insight
[1:47:30] and i'm not giving this to you for an
[1:47:32] example but in one way i am
[1:47:35] as it comes to me
[1:47:37] i'm a very practical kind of guy
[1:47:40] i look at things in terms of
[1:47:44] in this example try to give her flowers
[1:47:46] they're going to wilt
[1:47:48] by her sweater it'll last for years
[1:47:53] now that was
[1:47:54] brother samuel my practicality there's
[1:47:57] nothing wrong with that god will use
[1:47:58] that practicality
[1:47:59] but see
[1:48:01] god had to teach me
[1:48:03] sweaters are okay and all those other
[1:48:05] things but there's certain little things
[1:48:07] to do and it's not just flowers
[1:48:09] but it's little things
[1:48:11] to minister
[1:48:13] when i can find out those things that
[1:48:15] minister to her i want to do it i want
[1:48:18] to do it
[1:48:20] god knows how to minister to our needs
[1:48:23] and he loves
[1:48:25] the minister
[1:48:26] of our needs
[1:48:28] as a matter of fact he busies himself
[1:48:32] to minister
[1:48:33] to our needs
[1:48:35] okay this
[1:48:37] this
[1:48:38] the bible says he delights
[1:48:41] over us
[1:48:43] oh brother samuel is that really
[1:48:45] possible it is possible
[1:48:47] it's possible
[1:48:49] that will be done
[1:48:51] on earth
[1:48:53] as it is in heaven
[1:48:55] it's possible to have heaven
[1:48:56] in the
[1:48:59] it's home to have heaven in the home
[1:49:02] let's pray
[1:49:04] heavenly father
[1:49:08] lord jesus
[1:49:11] as we
[1:49:12] look into this great mystery that paul
[1:49:14] would write
[1:49:16] regarding that of christ in the church
[1:49:20] lord our hearts are stirred within us
[1:49:23] because in the spiritual side of it lord
[1:49:26] as we identify ourselves as the bride of
[1:49:29] jesus christ not
[1:49:32] not as just something that we are doing
[1:49:33] but lord
[1:49:35] by your spirit dwelling within us that
[1:49:37] directs us into the word
[1:49:40] because and when the spirit of truth has
[1:49:42] come he will lead and guide us into all
[1:49:45] truth
[1:49:47] so lord
[1:49:49] this
[1:49:50] is a pulsation from our heart it's
[1:49:54] our
[1:49:54] love would have failed a long time ago
[1:49:59] but lord the love of god
[1:50:01] cannot fail
[1:50:05] so lord as we look into these
[1:50:08] portions of the scripture
[1:50:10] as you've been stirring our hearts
[1:50:14] lord we just
[1:50:15] as we stand here lord thursday night
[1:50:18] after thursday night
[1:50:20] but sometimes lord as we just
[1:50:22] barely seeming like as far as what's in
[1:50:24] front of me moving
[1:50:26] at all forward lord in the lord in an
[1:50:29] outline as things continue to be added
[1:50:31] and so forth
[1:50:33] but lord i believe that we're moving
[1:50:35] according to your mind
[1:50:37] we don't want to be in a hurry
[1:50:39] we desire that every one of us spoke god
[1:50:42] that this grace
[1:50:46] would so move in our lives
[1:50:50] that god
[1:50:53] as your prophet said if we can learn in
[1:50:55] these areas when he would speak the
[1:50:57] message love
[1:50:59] he said if we can learn to love it will
[1:51:01] affect
[1:51:03] our relationships
[1:51:05] it'll affect our home life
[1:51:09] i believe that
[1:51:11] i'm a witness of that i'm speaking to
[1:51:13] witnesses
[1:51:14] but lord
[1:51:15] we want more
[1:51:17] [Music]
[1:51:19] we want more
[1:51:21] we desire lord our lives
[1:51:25] to be more like you
[1:51:27] now lord
[1:51:30] i'm asking lord that you'll help us this
[1:51:32] is an awful tall task
[1:51:35] that is impossible
[1:51:37] for man within himself
[1:51:40] but lord
[1:51:42] it's not impossible with you
[1:51:46] so lord
[1:51:47] may we not throw up our hands and say my
[1:51:51] what can i do but may we throw up our
[1:51:53] hands to say lord
[1:51:55] i surrender
[1:51:57] lord continue lord teach me lord
[1:52:01] show me thy way lord
[1:52:03] let the word that i'm hearing god let it
[1:52:05] just let my life be molded lord
[1:52:09] not conformed to this world but
[1:52:11] transformed
[1:52:13] by the renewing of my mind
[1:52:16] granted lord the mind of christ to
[1:52:18] operate lord in our lives
[1:52:20] a reflection
[1:52:23] of your life
[1:52:25] help us lord
[1:52:27] help us as husbands lord
[1:52:30] wives
[1:52:31] fathers and mothers lord

[1:52:39] would continue to help us what lord
[1:52:42] what child of god
[1:52:45] desires to walk about with presuming no
[1:52:48] child of god wants to presume
[1:52:50] we desire to walk pleasing to you
[1:52:54] there's things that we want to please
[1:52:55] you lord
[1:52:58] and this is why as we we ask lord here
[1:53:00] in the spiritual realm

[1:53:28] this is where lord it's a striving
[1:53:32] to please to accommodate ourselves lord

[1:53:49] free course
