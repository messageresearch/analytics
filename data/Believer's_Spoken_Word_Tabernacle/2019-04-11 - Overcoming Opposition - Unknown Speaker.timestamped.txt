[3:02] that's our confession tonight a man I'm
[3:05] gonna make it amen he already made it
[3:08] and that same life that has been
[3:12] deposited in our lives
[3:14] he's already make it he's already he's
[3:17] our forerunner amen and we have the
[3:19] earnest of the Spirit amen we have
[3:22] received the earnest the down posit the
[3:25] down payment the assurance we just had
[3:29] just time here this this morning and
[3:32] early afternoon with the family there of
[3:36] the zealot on family but the claudio's
[3:39] family there and brother and sister
[3:41] keener we were there and then the
[3:45] funeral this morning and just quite a
[3:49] quite a brother quite a brother and a
[3:52] man brother brother Claudio and most of
[3:54] you read the ride out but you know you
[3:56] get to know so many things so many more
[4:00] things about him but one thing that was
[4:03] above all you know of all the
[4:04] achievements you can do in life they had
[4:05] a a whole table that was set out I had
[4:10] every passport on it that he ever had
[4:12] and every stamping and all of the
[4:14] pictures and you know how it is when you
[4:16] go to a funeral those things sometimes
[4:18] those are snapshots moments in time that
[4:21] many others can relive and we can look
[4:24] at it and say mine this and that but to
[4:27] think of all the accomplishments that a
[4:29] person you or I or anyone else could
[4:31] ever have in life
[4:32] if we miss eternal life we've missed
[4:35] everything everything has been missed
[4:40] but eternal life is what really the
[4:43] purpose of the you and I being here in
[4:47] this life there's one purpose and that's
[4:49] to be germanized by the holy spirit and
[4:53] I you know we were looking at that on
[4:54] the table and I mentioned to the people
[4:57] of the VESA on it and when the stamp of
[5:00] the visa the seal it says you can come
[5:03] and go so we don't want to just be
[5:06] believers too
[5:08] leave on because to believe is to
[5:10] receive the passport but when the Holy
[5:13] Ghost has come you then have the seal
[5:15] amen you have the actual embassy of
[5:18] where you're going
[5:19] has recognized your entry and says your
[5:23] entry is guaranteed you have met all
[5:26] qualifications to enter here in that
[5:30] wonderful the Lord Jesus said I am the
[5:33] door and I am the Shepherd of the sheep
[5:36] hold whoever enters in by me and is
[5:39] saved he shall come in and out and find
[5:41] pasture in that wonderful we entered in
[5:45] but then still within our lives we go
[5:47] about our lives but yet the thing that's
[5:49] happened is were changed we're no longer
[5:52] the same and we are feeding feeding from
[5:56] him amen the Lord is so good so mindful
[6:00] that he would pass by our way and we're
[6:02] so grateful to have brother Andrew and
[6:04] sister Mariah here with us tonight and
[6:12] glad that they took the time to come
[6:15] here and and be with us and just bless
[6:17] us tonight with the gift that God has
[6:19] placed there in their life and we want
[6:21] to pull on the gift of God tonight you
[6:24] know you think about it a man can study
[6:25] and he'll study he'll give himself
[6:27] inspiration by the Spirit of God we'll
[6:29] move him in certain ways and channels
[6:31] that can actually take him even from
[6:33] whatever that he might be thinking he's
[6:35] going to preach and then something else
[6:38] will come out of that but then still the
[6:39] man doesn't know how he's going to
[6:42] actually move when it actually comes
[6:44] right here because the Holy Ghost is who
[6:47] takes control anybody can read anybody
[6:51] can read quotes anybody can read
[6:53] scriptures but when the Holy Ghost gets
[6:55] ahold of that word begins to break that
[6:57] word a whole nigh it does something to
[6:59] believers that's him that's him and
[7:02] that's who we want to see tonight and
[7:05] you you just remember this tonight all
[7:08] of us remember this the gift that God
[7:09] has placed in our brother's life was not
[7:11] for brother Andrew it was for us and
[7:14] these gifts how God will come right down
[7:16] and he'll speak right to our needs
[7:18] tonight so if whatever that you have
[7:21] need of a question you have something in
[7:24] your life maybe healing whatever it
[7:26] might be you need the Holy Ghost you put
[7:28] that on the altar of God tonight and say
[7:30] Lord passed by my way Lord take the gift
[7:33] that is within that man's life and speak
[7:36] to my heart let the fire of God come
[7:38] down Lord and minister to me may I walk
[7:41] out of here different than when I came
[7:43] in and you watch him come on the scene

[14:07] Bibles we'll go straight to the word I'm
[14:10] aware it's a midweek service but I
[14:12] assure him thankful for midweek services
[14:14] amen amen in the Bible we'll turn the
[14:17] book of Zachariah chapter number four I
[14:19] know sometimes people think that the
[14:22] Lord really can't move on the midweek
[14:24] but I believe the Lord can move any time
[14:26] he wants to don't you Amen I was with a
[14:29] brother one time I never will forget it
[14:31] brother Sammy I was with the brother one
[14:32] time and it was on a Wednesday night and
[14:34] he said well I got a preach tonight he
[14:36] said so I better go in here and see if I
[14:38] can't find something to say I really
[14:39] don't feel like putting too much effort
[14:40] in he said I'll go see if I can find
[14:42] something to say and I didn't say it out
[14:43] loud but down into my heart I thought
[14:45] I'm glad I don't have to sit through the
[14:46] Hat amen because I don't think the Lord
[14:49] just deserves our all on Sunday I think
[14:51] he deserves her all on the Wednesday or
[14:53] Thursday or a Friday amen any day of the
[14:55] week God is still God you believe that
[14:57] tonight amen gonna Ritchie bless you we
[14:59] certainly appreciate brother Samuel and
[15:01] his friendship and his family and the
[15:03] opportunity to be here tonight and this
[15:05] pray week can be a small blessing to you
[15:07] this evening we want to look here in the
[15:09] book of Zechariah chapter number four
[15:11] and we'll read verse number one down a
[15:14] couple verses here if you don't mind
[15:15] standing with me if you could give me
[15:17] just a little bit more on these
[15:18] monitors I'd appreciate it Zechariah
[15:20] chapter 4 and verse 1 the Bible says and
[15:23] the angel that talked with me came again
[15:26] and waked me as a man that is waken out
[15:29] of his sleep and said unto me what see
[15:32] us thou and I said I have looked and
[15:34] behold a candlestick all of gold with a
[15:37] bowl upon the top of it and the seven
[15:40] lamps they're all in seven pipes - the
[15:42] seven lamps now but I said that's lamp
[15:44] stand or seven Church ages which are up
[15:47] on the top thereof and two olive trees
[15:50] he said that's that old and new
[15:51] Testament buy it one up on the right
[15:54] side of the bowl the other up on the
[15:56] left side thereof and I answered inspect
[15:58] to the angel that talked with me saying
[16:00] what are these my lord then the angel
[16:02] that talked with me answered and said
[16:05] unto me knowest thou not what these be
[16:07] and I said no my lord and then he
[16:09] answered and spake unto me saying this
[16:11] is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel
[16:13] saying not by might not by power but by
[16:17] my spirit saith the lord of hosts who
[16:21] art Thou O great mountain before
[16:23] zerubabbel for thou shalt become a plane
[16:26] and he shall bring forth the head stone
[16:28] therefore was shouting crying grace
[16:31] grace unto it moreover the word the Lord
[16:35] came unto me saying the hands of
[16:37] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[16:40] the house his hands also shall finish it
[16:42] and thou shalt know that the Lord God of
[16:45] hosts hath sent me unto you notice this
[16:48] for who hath despised the day of small
[16:51] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[16:54] see the plummet in the hand of
[16:56] Zerubbabel with those seven they they
[16:58] are the eyes of the Lord which run to
[17:01] and fro throughout the whole earth we
[17:03] just asked the Lord this evening to
[17:05] bless the reading of his word as you may
[17:07] be seated for just a few moments we
[17:09] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[17:11] word of God a man we thank the Lord that
[17:13] the word is still being preached and
[17:15] that there's still power in the
[17:18] ministering of the word of God I won't
[17:20] do tonight by the help of the Lord just
[17:22] for a few moments if I could speak to
[17:23] you upon a thought and if I were toilet
[17:26] I would like to speak to you on
[17:27] overcoming opposition over
[17:30] humming opposition I think of the
[17:32] prophet of God preaching the message to
[17:34] us on how can I overcome and I believe
[17:37] tonight that every one of us are here
[17:39] because we're desiring to be overcomers
[17:41] we're desiring not just to be church
[17:44] members not to just be message believers
[17:47] so much but to be real overcomers for we
[17:50] know that in every age there has been an
[17:52] overcomer no matter how dark the age no
[17:55] matter how long the age how short the
[17:57] AIDS no matter the opposition of the age
[17:59] there has always been an overcomer and I
[18:02] think tonight that every one of us can
[18:04] fellowship upon this thought that no
[18:06] matter if you've been serving the Lord
[18:08] for five years or if you've been serving
[18:10] the Lord for 50 years no matter if
[18:12] you're a preacher if you're a deacon or
[18:14] if you're just a lay member or even if
[18:15] you're just a young person I believe
[18:17] every one of us can say that we are
[18:19] surrounded by opposition I believe
[18:21] there's opposition all around us and I
[18:24] believe tonight that that opposition has
[18:26] not come to defeat us but I believe that
[18:28] opposition has come to make us who God
[18:30] saw us before the foundation of a world
[18:33] I think of how that opposition comes and
[18:36] how that opposition and adversity comes
[18:38] but the beautiful thing about it is we
[18:40] have been anointed amen to overcome the
[18:43] opposition I look here in Romans chapter
[18:45] 7 verse 21 Paul says amen I found in a
[18:49] law that when I would do good amen
[18:51] evil is present with me now balem says
[18:53] there's two laws at work here he said
[18:56] there's the law of sin and then there's
[18:57] the law of death he's sitting on both
[18:59] the laws a men are at work a men of the
[19:02] law of sin and death in our flesh he
[19:04] said but then there's the law of the
[19:06] Spirit which is the spirit of life that
[19:08] works in our heart
[19:09] in the message question answers 59 now
[19:11] the law in sin and death works in your
[19:13] flesh but the law or the spirit of life
[19:15] works in your heart so your heart or
[19:18] your spirit in your heart will make your
[19:20] body obey what it says blue that's
[19:23] exactly right he said Paul said the
[19:26] flesh is always there the flesh says
[19:27] well I'm too tired or I'm unable I'm not
[19:31] sufficient I cannot do it he said like I
[19:33] told my daughter and all their lawyers
[19:35] just a few moments ago or Delores Amen
[19:37] she said what is it that when I go
[19:39] receive the Holy Ghost weather when
[19:40] something makes me feel the way I should
[19:42] feel he said right when I begin to feel
[19:45] good then something comes upon me to
[19:47] stomp me he said I told her well that's
[19:49] the devil see that devil seemed that you
[19:52] were ready to receive it and he said
[19:54] I'll put a little damper on her I'll fan
[19:56] her a little bit you know kind of cool
[19:58] it down he said but oh my that's when
[20:00] you rise they men that's when you rise a
[20:03] mint and claim your god-given rights now
[20:06] Amen do you realize that that's the same
[20:08] spirit that works in the church that's
[20:09] the same devil Amen that comes here on
[20:12] Thursday night that's the same devil
[20:14] that comes here on Sunday morning when
[20:16] the Holy Ghost amen begins to create an
[20:18] atmosphere in this building that all
[20:20] things are possible amen and no matter
[20:23] if you've had a bad day or if you've had
[20:24] a bad week or maybe you've been going
[20:26] through the hardest trial of your life
[20:28] and you come in the house of God and you
[20:30] begin to hear the songs and you begin to
[20:32] raise your hands and and then the
[20:34] burdens begin to lift off of you and
[20:36] then all of a sudden when you begin to
[20:38] feel Liberty come the devil comes and
[20:40] says well I'll put a damper on him but
[20:42] the prophet of God said that's not the
[20:44] time you lay down he said that's the
[20:46] time you rise amen and press through
[20:49] that opposition church I'll tell you
[20:51] we've come to a time where people and
[20:53] then they're no longer rugged Christians
[20:55] amen the least little thing that turns
[20:57] her praise the liesl opposition amen
[20:59] amen it used to be no matter how hard of
[21:02] a day you had you knew that if the devil
[21:04] ain't then tried to stop you is going to
[21:06] the house of God amen but now it's got
[21:08] to where if the kid has a hangnail or if
[21:10] the coffee pot breaks on Sunday morning
[21:13] we stay home and then that's what the
[21:15] devil wants the devil doesn't want this
[21:16] church amen to rise and the power the
[21:19] message of the hour amen but can I get a
[21:21] witness here tonight that says I'm not
[21:23] here they meant by the might of my flesh
[21:26] I'm not here by the power of my spirit
[21:28] but I'm here by the power of the Holy
[21:30] Ghost my to think tonight that there is
[21:33] a power and then inside of the church
[21:35] that we will not lay down and then and
[21:37] just let the devil take her family we
[21:39] won't lay down
[21:40] let the devil take our church we won't
[21:42] lay down and let the devil take our toy
[21:45] but there is a warrior on the inside of
[21:47] us hey we've done been through too many
[21:49] deserts they meant to lay down now we've
[21:52] done cross too many mountains they meant
[21:54] to lay down now there is something in
[21:56] our heart that is declaring there is
[21:58] victory Amen there is victory of Jesus
[22:01] and the devil's not going to cause us to
[22:03] lay down when we feel the moving of the
[22:06] Holy Ghost coming in that's not time to
[22:08] lay down that's time to rise amen and
[22:11] swing your sword like you've never swing
[22:13] it before this a brother ender the
[22:16] opposition is too hard well but Bama
[22:18] said no matter what the opposition looks
[22:20] like he says if you are determined how
[22:23] many Sturman here tonight he said if you
[22:26] are determined amen to find out truth
[22:28] that God will lead you and he will
[22:31] protect you isn't that a beautiful
[22:33] covenant to know that if you are
[22:35] determined amen to find truth how many
[22:38] it's determined you don't just want
[22:40] religion you just know what philosophy
[22:43] you just stole triology you just don't
[22:45] wanna but your intellectual conception
[22:47] but there is a cry only inside of your
[22:50] soul I want reality brother if there is
[22:53] a cry for reality only inside of your
[22:56] heart then there is reality somewhere to
[22:58] be happy
[23:00] the thing tonight church that the
[23:02] problem of God said look Amen at the
[23:04] Queen of the South look at her how she
[23:06] how she heard Amen that somewhere there
[23:09] was a Living God she heard that
[23:11] somewhere
[23:12] it was more than just a tradition then
[23:15] you say man she heard that somewhere it
[23:18] was more than just two gathering of a
[23:19] church but she heard there was a prophet
[23:22] in the land and that prophet had divine
[23:24] inspiration and that prophet was telling
[23:27] ship and he meant with the Living God
[23:28] and the prophet of God said something
[23:31] rose up only inside of her hungry hearts
[23:33] and she begin to cross over the dancer
[23:36] he said it wasn't a three minute walk he
[23:38] said it was a three month walk he said
[23:40] here's another thing he said the sons of
[23:42] Ishmael was out there and they were
[23:44] robbers hey men and they were thieves
[23:46] hey men but there's a beautiful thing
[23:48] there
[23:49] amen they could still hurt amble but
[23:51] they couldn't steal the desire that was
[23:53] on the inside of her hearts they meant
[23:55] to meet the Living God they could steal
[23:57] her jewelry but they couldn't stop the
[23:59] desire and brother we've come to
[24:01] denominational ages but there was a cry
[24:03] only inside of our heart there's a pride
[24:07] age somewhere there's a pride anointing
[24:09] somewhere and the Baptist tried to steal
[24:11] it
[24:12] and the Pentecostal tried to steal it
[24:14] but they couldn't steal that cheap seed
[24:16] that was placed only inside of your
[24:18] heart from before the foundation of the
[24:21] world there was something inside of her
[24:23] that said if I can just get through this
[24:25] there's going to be victory somewhere
[24:28] brother can I tell you that victory
[24:31] wasn't a million miles away that victory
[24:34] was just a few opposition's away and
[24:37] then you say well Andrew what kept her
[24:39] going
[24:39] what kept her going was the fact she
[24:41] knew that if I can just get through this
[24:43] if I can just get in the presence a men
[24:46] of this God I'm hungry for brother can I
[24:48] tell you tonight that same God is in
[24:51] this building right here tonight

[25:01] battery went dead join the crowd listen

[25:05] has not already happened to somebody
[25:07] else but there is a promise here that
[25:10] greater is He that is in you than he
[25:12] that is in the opposition and if God be
[25:15] for us who can be against us I've come
[25:18] here to tell the devil tonight Satan
[25:20] take your hands off of God's property we
[25:23] are not here amen to be manhandled by
[25:25] some tradition we are here to find the
[25:28] reality that there is a Living God
[25:30] somewhere my the problem God's I'm kind
[25:33] of a small man he said I've got a small
[25:36] voice he said but I got a great big
[25:38] message listen Church you may have
[25:42] problems you may have situations I may
[25:44] have troubles but we got a great big
[25:46] message see and he said this message has
[25:49] not come from a man this message has
[25:52] come from the Lord he said I've got a
[25:55] lot of opposition from Satan to keep me
[25:57] from bringing it but we'll get here
[25:59] anyhow see that's how the
[26:01] Herman that william branham was to
[26:03] preach this message that no opposition
[26:06] was going to stop him
[26:09] you say well I don't know I've got too
[26:11] many inflections well I got a promise
[26:13] for you and then many are the
[26:15] afflictions of the righteous but the
[26:17] Lord delivereth him from them all see
[26:22] many are the afflictions of the
[26:23] righteous but the Lord is going to
[26:26] deliver you how did that affliction
[26:28] brother can I tell you that's not what
[26:30] Andrew brother said that's not what
[26:32] William Branham said that's what the
[26:34] spirit of prophecy spoke to David some
[26:37] 2000 years ago and said there's going to
[26:39] be a lot of afflictions but there's also
[26:41] going to be a lot of deliverances come
[26:44] on Serge I'll tell you what tonight
[26:46] we're not in the hour of affliction
[26:48] we're in the hour of the levirate when
[26:50] the spirit of deliverance has crossed
[26:51] this land that éclairs hurts we are here
[26:54] and we are here to overcome my to think
[26:57] tonight the problem God said that
[26:59] affliction goes all the way back amen to
[27:01] the Garden of Eden all the way back in
[27:05] the Garden of Eden he said when the
[27:07] serpent came in and he beguiled Eve he
[27:10] said then he began to come in and begin
[27:12] to share his commentary on God's Word
[27:15] he said now watch the spirit of prophecy
[27:16] saying then I'll give you a savior a
[27:19] mentor I'll give you a massage genesis
[27:21] 3:15 and the woman's seed shall bruise
[27:24] the Serpent's head see and his head
[27:27] shall bruise her heel notice and his
[27:30] head shall bruise her heel to show that
[27:33] there would be an affliction to the
[27:35] church now watch if there's going to be
[27:37] an affliction to the church he did not
[27:39] say that there's just going to be an
[27:41] affliction to the church he said but he
[27:43] also said victory was going to come
[27:45] after be affliction my in the message
[27:48] Redemption completeness enjoy you know
[27:50] when you get the Holy Ghost you attend
[27:53] to a lot of obstacles but many are the
[27:56] afflictions of the righteous but God
[27:59] delivers him out of them all see God
[28:01] brings you right up to it he said facing
[28:04] with it so he can show you his power and
[28:07] his goodness don't you see why God
[28:09] brought you to that situation he didn't
[28:12] bring you there to fall into defeat he
[28:14] bringing their to fall into death he
[28:16] brought you there that she would be a
[28:17] vessel that he can manifest his power
[28:20] his goodness in my I think of what Jude
[28:23] said beloved when I gave all diligence
[28:25] to write unto you of the common
[28:27] salvation it was needful somebody say
[28:30] needful it was needful for me to write
[28:32] unto you and exhort you that she should
[28:35] earnestly contend for the faith which
[28:39] was once delivered unto the Saints so he
[28:41] was going to write them about the common
[28:44] salvation but the Spirit of the Lord
[28:46] moved upon him and said no write to them
[28:50] about the need to contend for the faith
[28:54] in this great faith battle he says I've
[28:57] tried to find it I've come some awful
[28:59] obstacles been over amen some rough
[29:01] roads it shows on me I have noticed this
[29:04] but it's been the most blessed thing
[29:05] this is the prophets words it's been the
[29:08] most blessed thing I wouldn't trade it
[29:10] for nothing in the world amen and here
[29:13] is my greatest victory here it's the
[29:16] greatest pleasure I have is when I come
[29:18] up against something and I can't see
[29:20] over it and I can't see around it or I
[29:23] can't see under it I just keep walking
[29:26] towards it believing that God will make
[29:29] a way when I get there can I get a
[29:32] witness here tonight that'll say I've
[29:33] been there I couldn't see my way over it
[29:36] I couldn't see my way around it and I
[29:38] couldn't see my way under but he still
[29:40] Jehovah Jireh and if he led me up on the
[29:43] mountain he's still able to provide me a
[29:45] sacrifice oh come on church you're not a
[29:48] bunch of children of Lucifer you're the
[29:50] sons and daughters of God who is a
[29:52] create who slept that old nothing
[29:55] and created everything my brother don't
[29:59] tell me that there's not a faith in the
[30:01] church there is a real faith in the
[30:03] church don't tell me that we need to
[30:05] become a bunch of cowards and just lay
[30:07] down and say well whatever the devil
[30:08] wants to do let him do I say no there is
[30:11] a power inside of you
[30:13] to back the devil in the corner and to
[30:15] put your foot on his neck and the rise
[30:17] in victory and power brother you say
[30:20] there's no faith in the church well
[30:22] there may not be the kind of faith you
[30:24] want but there is pay
[30:25] in the church you may want the faith of
[30:27] prosperity but that's not the faith God
[30:30] promised you you may want the faith for
[30:32] a bigger job or a bigger house we want
[30:34] some gospel to preach prosperity but he
[30:37] promised at the same faith of Jesus
[30:39] Christ would be in this hint I'm Brian
[30:41] and here we are tonight Church not full
[30:43] of a bunch of main philosophy and a
[30:45] bunch of vanities of man's hot this but
[30:48] I'm preaching to some warriors tonight
[30:50] I'm preaching to some people that hell
[30:53] hates I'm preaching to some people that
[30:55] the devil's got to her picture on his
[30:57] wall because he knows if he can ever
[30:59] destroy you then he'll have a great
[31:01] victory but I want to tell the devil
[31:03] tonight there is nothing in my past
[31:06] there is nothing in my presence there is
[31:08] nothing in my future that will ever
[31:10] separate me from the love of God my name
[31:13] was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[31:14] before there was one devil before there
[31:17] was one child before there was one
[31:19] Church trouble I had a cheap seat of
[31:21] representation only inside of my soul
[31:23] Satan you are a plus you offend me and
[31:27] the name of Jesus Christ take your hands
[31:29] off of God's property and let him rise
[31:31] in the faith of Jesus Christ there's a
[31:37] real faith in this church you see it's
[31:41] the strange thing that a prophet of God
[31:43] calls even an entire generation to
[31:46] contend for the faith of Jesus Christ
[31:49] seen that word contend means to fight
[31:53] for that Network contend means to
[31:56] actually stand and defend what you
[31:58] believe in now the Prophet said I do not
[32:01] believe in debating he said I do not
[32:04] believe in arguing he said but I do
[32:07] believe in contending he said I do
[32:09] believe in contending he said for that's
[32:12] what Jude told us to do he said contend
[32:15] for the faith of Jesus Christ isn't it
[32:17] something church that we got people who
[32:20] will contend for the things that hurt
[32:22] the church but they won't contend for
[32:24] the things that bless the church well
[32:27] I'm gonna preach I bet you get a
[32:29] preacher in the pulpit and he starts
[32:31] preaching on holiness brother they'll
[32:33] contend with you for two hours
[32:34] well I got a quote and I got a scripture
[32:36] and my momma said it was okay amen
[32:39] but let a preacher get in the pulpit and
[32:40] say this is a new age it's a
[32:42] manifestation of the son of man it's
[32:45] surprise hour it's rat stream faith and
[32:47] people sit back and fold their arms and
[32:49] say well I've heard it explained one
[32:50] time brother we don't need a bunch of
[32:52] contenders for the things of the devil
[32:54] we need somebody who will raise up in
[32:57] the faith of Jesus Christ and will
[32:59] contend forever divine promise brother
[33:01] I'm not talking about a promise that's
[33:03] gonna put you on top of the mountain I'm
[33:05] talking about a promise that's gonna
[33:07] take you beyond the Milky Way I'm
[33:09] talking about a promise it's gonna put
[33:12] you on the streets of gold I'm talking
[33:14] about a promise that's gonna change an
[33:16] 80 year old man into an 18 year old boy
[33:18] I'm talking about a reality Church I'm
[33:24] taking on two things tonight I'm
[33:26] thinking on the purpose of God and I'm
[33:28] thinking on the per the opposition of
[33:30] the devil the purpose of God and the
[33:33] opposition of the devil but do you
[33:35] realize the purpose of God will never be
[33:37] defeated
[33:39] isn't that beautiful that the opposition
[33:42] of the devil is never going to defeat
[33:44] the purpose of God he said in the
[33:49] beginning was the word and the Word was
[33:51] with God and the Word was God now a word
[33:54] is a part expressed God had in his mind
[33:57] what to do but when he expressed it it
[34:00] come into existence it become reality
[34:01] see it was God's Word express to me you
[34:04] take me to record this morning friends
[34:06] that there isn't enough power in all of
[34:08] Hell there isn't enough power in all of
[34:12] Hell that can ever defeat the purpose of
[34:15] Almighty God God will do it anyhow
[34:19] rather if God said he's going to hear
[34:20] you there ain't enough Devils in hell
[34:22] that's gonna stop gone from healing it
[34:25] if God said he would give you the Holy
[34:27] Ghost there ain't enough Devils out of
[34:28] all of Hades that is going to stop the
[34:31] power of God amen from killing somebody
[34:33] where the Holy Ghost Jeremiah 51 29 says
[34:37] and the land shall tremble and shall
[34:39] sorrow Amen for every purpose of the
[34:42] Lord shall be performed against Babylon
[34:44] to make the land of Babylon
[34:47] desolation without an inhabitant is it
[34:52] that beautiful God said when I get done
[34:54] with Babylon there isn't even going to
[34:56] be a place Amen for the devil to inhabit
[34:58] getting it beautiful when the Spirit
[35:01] Lord spoke to us Aruba bow and said old
[35:03] great mountain before zerubabbel
[35:05] thou shalt become a plane Amen you
[35:07] realize what he was saying when I get
[35:09] done with your enemy there isn't even
[35:11] going to be a resemblance that there was
[35:14] ever even an enemy in front of you
[35:16] hey Church isn't that powerful word
[35:20] isn't that powerful promise to know that
[35:23] Jesus Christ is not going to be defeated
[35:25] by your enemy oh brother you ever seen a
[35:27] dog get a hold of at all
[35:29] you ever seen an old dog get a hold of a
[35:31] baby doll or something he'll swing that
[35:33] thing around you'll walk on that thing
[35:35] pull it up in the air and catch it when
[35:37] he gets them with it don't even look
[35:38] like a rag doll I come to tell you
[35:41] tonight when Jesus Christ gets done with
[35:43] the devil he ain't even gonna look like
[35:45] a devil because our God it's still a
[35:48] destroyer my god it's pillory school our
[35:51] God is still a healer no weapon that is
[35:56] formed against thee shall prosper amen
[36:00] and every tongue that shall rise against
[36:02] the intents thou shall condemn isn't
[36:06] this beautiful this is the heritage of
[36:08] the servants of the Lord amen and the
[36:11] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[36:14] vilandra what is he talking about I'll
[36:17] tell you what he's talking about
[36:18] and we know that by heart no weapon that
[36:21] is formed against thee shall be able to
[36:25] prosper everybody close that aim it but
[36:27] there's another part to that scripture
[36:28] and every tongue that rises against the
[36:33] in judgment thou shalt condemn
[36:38] brother ain't even got time to protect
[36:41] amen every tongue that rises in judgment
[36:45] against thee thou shalt condemn brother
[36:48] can you imagine when your case come
[36:50] before the Lord
[36:51] and the devil said I'm going to condemn
[36:53] them and the devil said I'm going to
[36:55] hold a man that listen friends the devil
[36:57] did his homework the devil made sure
[36:59] that when he walked in the courtroom
[37:01] that morning he meant that he was going
[37:03] to put you away the devil made sure when
[37:07] you got done with that cancer he was
[37:09] going to silence her praise the devil
[37:12] thought for sure when you got through
[37:14] that church trouble that she would never
[37:16] have another ABS 238 experience in the
[37:18] church the devil thought for sure and
[37:20] then when you come to that family
[37:22] situation that he would destroy your
[37:24] family but the devil forgot to read the
[37:26] prophecy I said the devil forgot to read
[37:30] the prophecy what did the prophecy say
[37:32] the prophecy said no weapon
[37:35] he never said the weapon wasn't formed
[37:37] he just said the weapon would prosper
[37:39] he never said the tongue wouldn't rise
[37:41] he just said I will condemn it
[37:43] come on Church and the devil tonight has
[37:46] been condemned by the blood of Jesus
[37:48] Christ you are not upon Slater sin no
[37:51] more you are born again son or daughter
[37:53] but there is an Lamb of God nothing is
[37:59] going to defeat God's eternal purpose
[38:02] vilandra how can you say that because
[38:04] God will never let his heritage be
[38:06] destroyed see for it's his purpose ain't
[38:10] meant to save us number them said why
[38:11] well he said this may be simple but it's
[38:14] us on my heart
[38:15] he said now why would he save us today
[38:17] to lose us tomorrow
[38:19] why would he give us the Holy Ghost amen
[38:22] to lose the Holy Ghost the next day say
[38:24] God is not the author of confusion now
[38:28] watch and he will never let our heritage
[38:31] be destroyed you see Bob and said your
[38:33] heritage is her family see that heritage
[38:37] is your inheritance he said he will
[38:40] never let's say it in other words he
[38:42] will never let your family be destroyed
[38:45] well Andrew you can't say that all but I
[38:47] can
[38:48] because I hear the Prophet say that
[38:50] there was a girl by the name of Rosanna
[38:52] Griffin
[38:53] he said Rosanna Griffin was in a
[38:55] terrible condition he said she was an
[38:57] alcoholic she had been to Alcoholics
[38:59] Anonymous she had been to all kinds of
[39:01] rehabs and nothing I mean nothing could
[39:04] help Rosanna like get over that
[39:05] opposition aim it but she realized only
[39:08] inside of her
[39:09] there was an overcomer laying there even
[39:11] why was she going out there because they
[39:14] overcome her only inside of her new you
[39:17] was born to be more than an alcoholic he
[39:19] was born to be more than a drug peddler
[39:21] he was born to be a daughter of God he
[39:24] was born to be a house on fire where the
[39:26] power of the Holy Ghost who never sinned
[39:30] Rosella Griffin it had been to all kinds
[39:32] of programs and none of them could help
[39:35] her he said then one day she come into
[39:37] my meeting and he said the angel of the
[39:39] Lord come down and he said there she was
[39:42] it's a beautiful testimony you can go
[39:43] here and God called me and he said and
[39:45] there she was in the very back he said
[39:48] this for the Lord begin the deal with
[39:49] her now watch he said while the Spirit
[39:52] of God was dealing with her he said the
[39:54] angel of the Lord picked up something on
[39:56] another girl sitting here on the front
[39:58] row what and he stopped and he said wait
[40:01] a second he said you young girl you've
[40:04] got Amen this in your life and you've
[40:06] got this and you ain't been living it
[40:07] Memorial and you've been packing drugs
[40:09] and all kinds of things omit now watch
[40:12] at the same time that the Spirit of the
[40:14] Lord is moving what's that old sprit of
[40:16] opposition raise up and the prophet of
[40:20] God said there was a man in the back
[40:22] stood up and said that's my daughter up
[40:24] there said sir your line said she's a
[40:27] good girl said your line and the
[40:30] daughter turned around and said that
[40:32] he's telling the truth that he's telling
[40:36] the truth
[40:36] he said now from that testimony Rosella
[40:39] got set free
[40:40] he said that young girl got set free and
[40:42] the opposition of that girl's daddy
[40:45] could not stop two girls from
[40:47] experienced in the transforming power of
[40:50] Jesus Christ
[40:52] rather when God gets ready to save you
[40:56] your mama can't stop him your daddy
[40:59] can't stop him your favorite preacher
[41:01] paint stopping when he gets ready to set
[41:03] you free
[41:04] there is no power inhale there is no
[41:06] power on the earth there is no power in
[41:08] heaven there is no power nowhere that
[41:11] can stop Jesus Christ from fulfilling
[41:13] the perfect will of God about the story
[41:19] cause he's away maker he said why Rose
[41:22] Heller was testifying he said she's been
[41:24] on fire for God for a long time he said
[41:27] she's been running around tests the
[41:28] father been witnessing the God he said
[41:33] no watch he said she's worried about her
[41:35] daddy
[41:36] he said Rosella wants her daddy saved
[41:39] now catch it brother branham is standing
[41:41] in the pulpit testifying about what God
[41:43] did for Rosella and that young girl and
[41:46] he says now Rosella really wants to see
[41:48] her daddy saved
[41:50] he said she really wants to see him on
[41:53] fire with God but he's got no habit he
[41:56] said now rose heaven don't worry just
[41:58] keep praying and while he's speaking he
[42:01] stops and says wait a minute somebody
[42:04] just passed me a note and he reads the
[42:07] note and he says pray for Rose and the
[42:10] Griffins father
[42:13] Rosella didn't know what was going on we
[42:15] and Brandon didn't know what was going
[42:17] on but the same angel of God that put a
[42:20] plane on the ground in Memphis and let
[42:23] Elijah to an insignificant colored
[42:25] woman's house is the same God that come
[42:28] down in that meeting that morning and a
[42:30] prophet of God said I just got a note
[42:32] that Rosanna Griffin's father has been
[42:35] in a terrible accident and right now
[42:37] he's laying under a pile of bricks he
[42:40] bowed his head and he said father in the
[42:42] name of jesus christ he may be laying
[42:44] under a pile of bricks but you can say
[42:47] this soul right now where he's at you
[42:50] brother
[42:51] I'm about to shout you can say this soul
[42:54] right now Riza brother Samuel and I
[42:56] heard that it was on a Sunday morning I
[42:58] was fixing to go to the pulpit breathe
[43:00] and I jumped out of my chair in my study
[43:02] and I said father if you can bring a
[43:04] sinner out from under a pile of rocks
[43:06] you can bring a more son and daughter of
[43:08] God out of the ever complex from under
[43:11] every sickness not from under every
[43:13] Church trouble he's the same yesterday
[43:15] he's the same today he'll be the same
[43:18] tomorrow church all the hydrogen bombs
[43:24] we'll never defeat this church the
[43:27] spirit of the enemy will never defeat
[43:29] this church because we know our enemy we
[43:34] know our adversary the Bible says in
[43:37] first Peter 5:8 be sober and be vigilant
[43:42] because your adversary but devil as a
[43:45] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[43:49] he may devour you realize what our
[43:52] position means opposition means
[43:54] resistance opposition means a descent
[43:59] that becomes expressed in action or an
[44:02] argument or a group of adversaries or
[44:04] competitors it means a conflict now
[44:08] watch when Satan tempts us we are to
[44:11] resist him in a perfect faith in the
[44:15] perfect word just like Jesus did the
[44:18] Word of God is perfect I hate to ask if
[44:21] you put a little bit more on these
[44:22] monitors not appreciated omit the Word
[44:25] of God is perfect you believe that now
[44:27] we're here to have perfect faith in this
[44:30] perfect word and resist Satan whole
[44:33] elective God beware study close be
[44:36] careful work out your salvation thank
[44:38] you buddy
[44:39] work out your salvation with fear and
[44:41] trembling and rely upon God and be
[44:44] strong in his might for your adversary
[44:46] is the devil even now going about like a
[44:49] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[44:52] but watch watching the prayer and be
[44:58] steadfast for this is the endtime both
[45:00] for true and false vines are coming into
[45:03] maturity
[45:04] but before the wheat matures those
[45:06] rappin tears must be bound for the
[45:09] burning now watch see they are joining
[45:12] the World Council of Churches that is
[45:14] the binding so the gathering of the
[45:17] wheat or the garnering of the weeds will
[45:20] come don't you see what the devil's do
[45:23] it that devil is right now bringing an
[45:25] entire group of Protestants to himself
[45:27] and binding them in a World Council of
[45:30] Churches you know what he's doing he
[45:32] thinks he's doing it to destroy you but
[45:34] actually what he's doing is he's making
[45:36] room he's making room for the bride to
[45:42] leave here Oh God he thinks he's
[45:47] actually accomplishing something he
[45:50] thinks he's setting you up
[45:51] he thinks he's putting pressure on you
[45:53] no sir as you've seen the hits don't
[45:56] come and what you've seen in a small
[45:58] measure when that third pull in a profit
[46:00] stood how can overcome any say I feel
[46:03] that third pull moving right now when
[46:05] that third pull and then comes into full
[46:07] effect the devil is gonna have to turn
[46:09] loose because when this bride is gone
[46:12] then judgment comes the tribulation
[46:15] Falls my god have mercy
[46:18] but right now but to spirit somebody say
[46:21] two spirits are at work right now in the
[46:27] framework of the saint church but start
[46:31] to overcome that you may be praise
[46:34] worthy for your Lord and fit to reign
[46:37] and rule with him now watch those two
[46:40] spirits are at work in the framework of
[46:43] the same church right now the same

[58:36] made a move like that he said he's never
[58:39] made a move I got he said and
[58:41] furthermore we never thought he would he
[58:44] said because just a few months ago there
[58:46] was some unclean living took place in
[58:47] the marriage he said and his wife is has
[58:50] been bound by an oppression he said but
[58:52] the Holy Ghost spoke to him the night
[58:53] and he said for the first time he said
[58:56] we thought that would take him out he
[58:59] said but it didn't take him out he just
[59:01] put him in brother you think the
[59:07] opposition's going to take us out no sir
[59:10] it's just going to put us into action
[59:13] you say how can you say this because the
[59:16] glory of the Lord shall be revealed see
[59:19] God is going to reveal his glory and God
[59:23] is going to get the praise look at
[59:25] somebody and say God it's going to
[59:27] reveal his glory God it's going to
[59:32] reveal his glory and God is going to get
[59:35] the praise God it's going to reveal his
[59:41] glory and God it's gonna get the Prince
[59:44] I said God it's gonna reveal his glory
[59:48] and God is gonna get the place well I'm
[59:52] talking about the Shekinah glory I'm
[59:54] talking about the glory amen if you just
[59:57] get in the presence of this boy it'll
[59:59] bring forth life in the Easter she'll
[1:00:02] the problem of God said that Shekinah
[1:00:05] glory it was sealed off they said they
[1:00:08] couldn't go in there he said but on
[1:00:10] Easter morning it broke the seal
[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:14] on Easter morning the seal between the
[1:00:18] Shekinah glory and the inner court was
[1:00:21] broken he said now brother
[1:00:24] I love I says this he said now brother
[1:00:27] I'm paraphrasing here I'm just slinging
[1:00:32] the sword now child this forgive me
[1:00:35] Timothy Pruitt was preacher than a
[1:00:37] decent man ISA I got so tired of every
[1:00:39] time you close the quote somebody said
[1:00:40] what year did brother Branham close that
[1:00:43] Timothy said I finally told him the year
[1:00:45] he was a prophet works pretty good for
[1:00:53] me see that's what's happening a bunch
[1:00:55] of it tree used to be when the preacher
[1:00:57] preached you just started shouting but
[1:01:00] now we got to figure out what page and
[1:01:02] paragraph and color at I had on when he
[1:01:04] said it said that that Holies of Holies
[1:01:09] was sealed off he said that's where the
[1:01:11] Shekinah glory come he's sipping on
[1:01:13] Easter morning he said that seal was
[1:01:15] broke and he said man went in there he
[1:01:18] said now let me tell you how powerful it
[1:01:20] was in there he said a priest went in
[1:01:23] there one time and said he got so shook
[1:01:26] up brother
[1:01:28] he got so shook up then he dropped the
[1:01:31] rod in his hand and ran out of there he
[1:01:35] said when he come back to get it that
[1:01:37] presence was so powerful I'm trying to
[1:01:41] behave myself that presence was so
[1:01:43] powerful that he came back and a dead
[1:01:46] rod was budding forth buds come on
[1:01:50] church I caught something there this is
[1:01:53] okay if a dead rod that was never
[1:01:56] ordained to bring forth life can get in
[1:01:59] the presence of the Shekinah glory and
[1:02:02] can lay there until it brings forth life
[1:02:05] then what about a redeemed son or

[1:03:08] if the glory of the Lord ever comes in
[1:03:11] the church it will change everything the
[1:03:22] glory the Lord come in and something
[1:03:27] that was not even ordained to bring
[1:03:31] forth brought forth brother I'm gonna
[1:03:37] close here I'm just gonna say this you
[1:03:41] was ordained to overcome now I hope it's
[1:03:46] okay to take a little liberty here I
[1:03:48] know there's been a lot of confusion
[1:03:50] well is there about ages there not is
[1:03:53] there a broad anointing is there not but
[1:03:56] let me tell you what the devil wants us
[1:03:57] to do the devil wants us to sit here and
[1:04:01] he wants us to rock us to sleep and tell
[1:04:04] us brother opposition is coming and when
[1:04:08] opposition comes it's going to perfect a
[1:04:11] bride brother there's something greater
[1:04:14] coming when it comes it's gonna perfect
[1:04:16] about brother persecution is coming I
[1:04:19] really say well you've heard it preached
[1:04:20] hope it's okay
[1:04:21] oh and the pressure comes down from the
[1:04:24] White House
[1:04:25] oh that Brides gonna have Church then if
[1:04:30] it takes the Trump in the White House to
[1:04:34] cause us to have Church we got a problem
[1:04:37] oh and Russia does this when opposition
[1:04:42] comes with a bride we'll go through her
[1:04:44] perfection and she'll get persecuted and
[1:04:46] she'll get perfected and she'll come out
[1:04:48] and go in the rapture brother the proto
[1:04:49] God said if the Dark Ages did not
[1:04:53] persecute a church enough to perfect her
[1:04:55] there's nothing else coming of any
[1:04:57] greater any greater pressure to bring
[1:05:00] perfection and he stopped and said how
[1:05:02] can overcome he says know your sin but
[1:05:05] then you're gonna run out of times here
[1:05:07] he said no I'm not he said the bride is
[1:05:09] not going through tribulation she's
[1:05:12] going in the rapture but at random how
[1:05:14] can you say that he said because the
[1:05:15] blood somebody shout the blood he said
[1:05:18] because the blood has got enough power
[1:05:21] to perfect the church brother the blood
[1:05:28] of Jesus has got enough power to perfect
[1:05:32] the church so can I tell you tonight
[1:05:34] church your opposition is not coming he
[1:05:38] reveals your opposition in the Feast of
[1:05:40] Trumpets 64 he said the lid came off a
[1:05:43] hell and two hundred thousand thousand
[1:05:47] demons was loosed out of the river of
[1:05:50] Euphrates against the bride he said now
[1:05:52] there's a two-fold purpose here he said
[1:05:54] some was released to the Jews he said
[1:05:57] but watch there was two hundred thousand
[1:05:58] thousand ecclesiastical spirits that was
[1:06:02] released against the bride of Jesus
[1:06:04] Christ he said but at the same time oh
[1:06:07] I'm coming to a close but at the same
[1:06:10] time when the releasing of our
[1:06:13] opposition is coming the releasing of
[1:06:15] our overcoming power is covered
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:20] what is it says it's the holy ghost
[1:06:23] that's been bound by these
[1:06:25] denominational rivers for some 2,000
[1:06:28] years but in the evening time under the
[1:06:31] evening time messenger the holy ghost
[1:06:34] that's been bound it's gonna start
[1:06:36] flowing again rather somebody just raise
[1:06:40] your hands and say flow through me flow
[1:06:43] through me oh it goes flow through my
[1:06:45] family flew through my church flew

[1:06:50] husband flows through my wife flows
[1:06:52] through my church let the Holy Ghost of
[1:06:55] God
[1:06:55] just pull through this building tonight
[1:06:57] until the overcomer only inside of you
[1:07:00] is released rather that Holy Ghost is
[1:07:10] released to give you overcoming power
[1:07:16] you're gonna overcome this opposition
[1:07:20] and God is going to get the glory
[1:07:26] so can I tell you tonight it's okay
[1:07:29] your opposition is not coming your
[1:07:33] opposition is a year what opposition's
[1:07:38] following that dwell for the bride after
[1:07:42] this comes the body change Abraham and
[1:07:48] Sarah received the message right after
[1:07:51] they received the message then came the
[1:07:57] body change to bring forth the promise
[1:08:04] I'd tell the devil tonight we are more
[1:08:08] than conquers there are more than church
[1:08:17] members there more than just message
[1:08:22] believers we are more than just profit
[1:08:26] followers we're more than just husbands
[1:08:30] you are more than just wives your
[1:08:35] overcomers
[1:08:40] brilliant pressures coming but but but
[1:08:42] this may sound strange but I love
[1:08:46] pressure because you know what pressure
[1:08:50] does man I gotta quit it just keeps
[1:08:52] coming back pressure produces the real
[1:08:55] you pressure only produces what's laying
[1:08:59] there you say pretender how can you say
[1:09:02] that okay there's two boys in the book
[1:09:04] of Genesis chapter 4 Cain table the
[1:09:06] Bible says God came down at the time of
[1:09:08] worship Cain brought his sacrifice Abel
[1:09:12] brought his sacrifice and they laid him
[1:09:14] on the altar they laid him on the altar
[1:09:17] both boys worshiped both boys built
[1:09:21] altars both boys sent their prayers but
[1:09:25] God had respect towards Abel's offering
[1:09:29] but he did not have respect towards
[1:09:32] Cain's I'm holding I'm sorry it's an
[1:09:35] it's in the true Easter seal the proto
[1:09:37] God said see he said where is this
[1:09:39] Easter seal coming from he said I was
[1:09:41] down the other day and they were selling
[1:09:42] these stamps it was started in 1919 you
[1:09:45] go look it up it was a 501c3 nonprofit
[1:09:47] organization it was an Easter seal it
[1:09:50] was a stamp and the pride of God said
[1:09:51] what they did was they took up money and
[1:09:53] I identify something there he said they
[1:09:56] took up money he said to go put this
[1:09:58] Easter stamp on a or this Easter seal on
[1:10:00] a card he said to send to somebody who
[1:10:03] was laying in hospice he Center had
[1:10:05] tuberculosis or was getting ready to die
[1:10:08] he said no watch they were putting an
[1:10:10] Easter steals ant stamp up on them to
[1:10:14] put them in the grave but the true
[1:10:18] Easter seal come to put a stamp up on
[1:10:21] you to bring you out of the grave
[1:10:25] so that opens the door to show you that
[1:10:29] the force inside of you is greater than
[1:10:33] the opposition that surrounds you you
[1:10:38] see Cain brought his offering and the
[1:10:40] problem that God said while Cain was
[1:10:43] putting his pumpkins and his melons and
[1:10:45] his flowers up on the altar he said Abel
[1:10:48] was over there with a knife cutting the
[1:10:50] neck of a lamb and Cain was looking over
[1:10:53] at him and calling him a Holy Roller
[1:10:57] opposition was around him but election
[1:11:01] was laying on the inside of him the
[1:11:06] opposition of his own brother of his own
[1:11:09] half-brother could not stop him from
[1:11:12] worshiping are y'all hearing me don't
[1:11:17] worry I'm not gonna catch a second wind
[1:11:19] the opposition around him could not stop
[1:11:22] him from worship but Cain laughed at him
[1:11:25] but it didn't stop him came call me my
[1:11:27] Holy Roller but it didn't stop him and
[1:11:30] the prophet of God said when God
[1:11:33] rejected Cain's sacrifice he said Cain
[1:11:37] got jealous he said there was a spirit
[1:11:40] of greed he said that spirit has come in
[1:11:42] in Nashville affairs come in and
[1:11:45] political affairs come right down to the
[1:11:47] church affairs he said that spirit of
[1:11:49] greed raised up that spirit of greed
[1:11:53] raised up and killed his brother
[1:11:57] but now watch when God rejected Cain's
[1:12:01] sacrifice and so I don't have respect
[1:12:03] towards it when God rejected it God did
[1:12:06] not place greed in him greed was already
[1:12:11] in
[1:12:13] the pressure of not the exact rifice not
[1:12:17] being accepted moved upon what was
[1:12:19] laying there and closed it to manifest
[1:12:22] itself my god brother if the Spirit of
[1:12:26] the Lord can reject the sacrifice and
[1:12:29] that pressure be so great on that flesh
[1:12:32] body that pain would raise up and say I
[1:12:35] hate you and kill his own brother and
[1:12:38] the prophet of God said it was a key
[1:12:40] move he said what is it Cain move when
[1:12:43] the pressure come he moved out of the
[1:12:47] presence of God but look at the
[1:12:49] spiritual side when the pressure come to
[1:12:52] Abel and said what is your sacrifice and
[1:12:55] he said it's a bloody lamb it moved Abel
[1:12:58] into the presence of God and Abel didn't
[1:13:01] display a spirit of greed because there
[1:13:03] wasn't a spirit of great lay in there he
[1:13:06] displayed a face because there was a
[1:13:08] faithfully in there and I ask you
[1:13:10] tonight Church what are you going to
[1:13:12] display what are you going to display
[1:13:16] when somebody don't shake your hand at
[1:13:19] church what are you going to display
[1:13:20] when somebody slides you in the parking
[1:13:23] lot what are you going to display
[1:13:25] brother if you're a son of Cain if
[1:13:28] you're a son of the devil that spirit
[1:13:30] that was always there is going to raise
[1:13:32] up whole but if you're a table you'll
[1:13:35] just stand up on your feet you'll just
[1:13:37] raise up your hands and say I'm going on
[1:13:40] with my Jesus just the same they may
[1:13:46] falsely accuse me you know that song
[1:13:50] they may scandalize my name come on
[1:13:54] musicians but I'm going on with Jesus

[1:14:27] don't worry there's a lot of places you
[1:14:30] can be ignited
[1:14:30] it's the AIDS of pressure and pressure
[1:14:34] has to produce manifestation they rose
[1:14:40] up said well we can't find word with 16
[1:14:42] men fell to their death off of a bridge
[1:14:44] we can't find that we can't find how
[1:14:49] that a prophet went out there in the
[1:14:50] mountain and seven angels come over him
[1:14:52] informed the cloud we think that was a
[1:14:55] we think that was a jet sir pressure
[1:14:59] started coming in now don't get mad at
[1:15:02] me but pressure started coming in
[1:15:09] and okay said a lot there you want I
[1:15:12] can't prove it and it just think too
[1:15:15] pretty to get up quote brother Brandon
[1:15:16] but he was a false prophet pressure came
[1:15:20] in and they started manifesting who they
[1:15:22] were and people's lost families people's
[1:15:26] lost loved ones people's lost best
[1:15:28] friends but you stood toe-to-toe with
[1:15:33] the same pressure why are you here
[1:15:35] tonight because there was an overcomer
[1:15:39] laying in there and the pressure only
[1:15:44] begin to manifest what was only inside
[1:15:47] of you
[1:15:48] how many can say tonight Lord I'm going
[1:15:52] on with you just the same Flandre it's
[1:15:57] it's it's too hard the pressure is too
[1:16:00] hard well it's what Cain said and came
[1:16:05] back to us it will it better take a
[1:16:06] different approach a dish you know we
[1:16:07] better today what this blood all over
[1:16:09] the altar you better take a different
[1:16:11] approach but Abel being spiritually
[1:16:13] minded bi-election said it's in my heart
[1:16:17] and I take it to not Church it's in my
[1:16:20] heart brother is it in your heart

[1:16:31] believe this message brother I'll tell
[1:16:34] you if it ever gets in your heart you
[1:16:37] don't matter what anybody else does it's
[1:16:40] there to stay you're loving tonight
[1:16:44] won't we rest ourselves to our feet did
[1:16:46] I do well Andrew
[1:16:52] why do you say they're so strong well
[1:16:57] the same I was listening to the message
[1:16:58] Easter seal in 1965 the other day
[1:17:01] brother brand was preaching and he says
[1:17:06] says I don't know he says this may be
[1:17:09] the last Easter message I ever preached
[1:17:12] he said but let me say it quickening
[1:17:16] power is in this word quickening power
[1:17:23] is in this word but 20 minutes later he
[1:17:27] stopped again he said church I'm 56
[1:17:31] years old he said I'm at the heart
[1:17:34] attack age he said I'm at the age of
[1:17:37] anything I could go at any time
[1:17:39] he said I'm there I'm at that time he
[1:17:43] said but let it be said
[1:17:44] clicking him power he's in this word
[1:17:50] right before he comes in that sermon
[1:17:52] brother right at the end he stops and he
[1:17:54] screams out that's why I don't care if
[1:17:57] they slam every door in my face he said
[1:18:00] that's why I don't care if they closed
[1:18:03] every pulpit off to me he said I'm gonna
[1:18:05] stand and declare this is the Holy Ghost
[1:18:11] gospel brother something raised up on
[1:18:15] the inside of me the pressure of doors
[1:18:18] slamming in the prophets face cannot
[1:18:21] stop him from overcoming opposition you
[1:18:24] know why because he might have been a
[1:18:26] small man with a little voice but he had
[1:18:30] a great big message

[1:18:36] a small Church with just a few people
