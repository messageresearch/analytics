right there hello god bless everyone last week i had to go for a surgery and i was okay about it until the night before and so then i called brother samuel and i asked him for me because the doctor told me there's two options i wanted the easy one it's the way and thank god he he granted it that i did not have to be cut all the way it was a gallbladder and it had a mass and two tumors all of it was benign i gave this uh saturday but or was it sunday's service last time andrew glover was here i don't know if everyone was here but uh andrew started talking about um when a father owns a business the son has every right to do whatever he wants if he's given that authority and he started talking about an employee that wasn't doing the right things and the son just says you're fired and he goes well i'm going to go to your father and see what he says about it and he goes go ahead you you'll hear the same thing yes sir so the employee called the father up he goes you know your son just fired me what do you say about it and he goes well whatever my son said i say the same thing so i've had shoulder pain in the shoulder for about six to eight months where you know i like to work out and stuff um and i couldn't even really do a pull-up anymore just couldn't do anything really and just gave me pain all the time just irritated and when andrew was talking about that and i just said shoulder pain you're fired and uh yeah so we went out to dinner with andrew to applebee's and i got home and i've been seeing a physical therapist and i was doing my movements and i i would have pain right back here sharp pain and i started doing my movements and the pain was completely gone so amen amen now there's there's more there's more testimonies to be given amen we just i tell you we're just it's an awesome time to be living it's an awesome time we amen just to just to see how that god some most of you no doubt streaming in here on thursday night of god just came supernaturally down and the gabriel's hand was covered it was covered with blisters he had blisters and irritating and itching and after after prayer and brother gabriel just looked down his hand completely gone everything completely done amen i tell you if god can do that to blisters on a hand what about sin amen we just thank god for his mercy amen so we just want to just invite you to the word of the lord here this morning just want to just look to him i'm going to have you stand here in a few moments and uh i'm just going to we'll read in the scripture and i may not read the whole passage we'll have to having you stand but i may just have to be seated and then continue to read because i want to lay all this in in the background this morning i feel like i'm missing an announcement am i missing anything honey i'm not i for some reason i have just felt like i'm missing an announcement she's she's my reminder she has post-it notes beat she has reminders on the phone that she has everything beat and so i just appreciate that i mean she's a help made in many many many many many many ways and so we just just want to just turn our attention to the things of the lord just thankful for what god is doing in our myth we just want to invite him that same god that we've heard just a few testimonies of and there's more yet that i'd like to be given it's a testimony he's still the same lord jesus he still he does what he's always done he's the same god time cannot change him circumstances don't change him he said i'm god and i change now he doesn't need to alter his word as a matter of fact he said he won't alter his word what's been spoken he will fulfill and he fulfills it through lives and hearts that are just simple just to say be it unto me according to thy word your your thought that you had when you've expressed it lord be it unto me in that way amen hallelujah what song are you playing let's sing that as we stand jesus draw me close jesus draw me closer closer lord to you and let the world all around me let it fade away hallelujah let it be a real prayer now oh jesus draw me closer lord [Music] [Music] heavenly father you spoke to us lord to draw nigh unto you and you draw nigh unto us lord is your prophet our prophet would tell us that lord the application of that scripture is even lord in our minds where we begin to allow the thoughts of life of the world of just the simple cares just be put on the back burner and let our thoughts be upon you lord how your prophet would instruct us those that were in need of healing he said begin to just think as we are preaching the word of your healing lay aside doubts lay aside everything of i've tried or my situation lay that aside and just entertain him lord this is our desire this morning to draw nigh unto you and you said you'd draw nine to us lord i pray this morning that you just come in a very special very special way lord we just invite you lord i invite you to this pulpit we invite you lord to our pew we invite you lord to our lives lord we invite you o god the same god that can take what is little and can bring forth we invite you lord will you come lord jesus have your way father we pray in the name of jesus christ amen psalms chapter 80. amen god bless you psalms chapter 80. i want to begin with verse one and we're going to read the chapter but i'm not going to have to stand the whole time in psalms chapter 80 verse 1. this is a psalm of the lilies that's what that word is there that long word begins with an s give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadeth joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth between the cherubims shine forth before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine we shall be saved oh lord god of host how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou feed us them with the bread of tears and give us them tears to drink in great measure thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors and our enemies laugh among themselves turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved god bless your word as you're being seated could we just continue thou has brought a vine out of egypt thou has cast out the heathen and planted thou preparest room before it and it is caused it to take deep root and it filled the land the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the bowls thereof were like the goodly cedars she sent out her bows under the sea and her branches onto the river why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it now what you begin to move into here is how david moving under inspiration of even if even prophecy of how that in the times where israel would go astray even to the time where israel would go into captivity in babylon and the land itself would be laid to waste and it would also speak of the time of the rejection to where israel would reject the messiah as they have done they were blinded for our sake and there was a dispersion not in that time it wasn't just to babylon but god dispersed them throughout the nations of the world and israel still even as you think of in isaiah and jeremiah israel is still grieving that they're still under there's still a reproach that is laid there until they receive their day of visitation just as god has taken away our reproach it's the same way with his visitation to israel the 144 thousand after the bride is taken in rapture he removes their reproach so it's him who removes the reproach now let's go down to verse 14 here return we beseech thee oh god of host look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine so we don't need an earthly visitation or a visitation that's of earthly origin we need a visitation that comes from the original we need a heavenly visitation and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou made is strong for thyself it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou made it strong for thyself he is the branch is that right so so will not we come back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again o lord god of host calls thy face to shine and we shall be saved brother brandon would pick this up in the message planting the vine and that's sort of many of some of the the points that i'm going to draw from here this morning and he's dealing with faith and unbelief in this quote and he says the scripture said he is the same yesterday today and forever it just won't mix with unbelief faith won't we have faith in god it's eternal unbelief has always been since the garden of eden so unbelief it was around but it hadn't gained instruments until one of god's subjects became a channel for unbelief to come through is that right unbelief brought brought doubt but prior to that they were channels of faith that was reserved unto god amen god has always wanted his people to believe this he's he has wanted them to have confidence confidence is is faith and and love is what produces faith and forgiveness is what brings faith when you it really strikes the heart that i'm forgiven i'm set free and you recognize that i'm no longer what i was i'm not that same person it gives confidence so that he can use you it says he wanted them to have confidence and to show himself among his people god is a spirit in saint john's 15 he goes in and he quotes the verse i am the vine year the branches the branch and the vine is connected together and god has always tried to get a people that he could so dwell in that he could show his glory among his people i want to come back to this point and what i want to speak continue on this morning is fulfilling god's desire and i want to come back into this place that as we many times or we can look at things and say i'm expecting god to do this but we must understand that in order for god he will always fulfill his word the same way that he's always done it and that's when the heart itself is in condition to receive him is that right so god he works in a manner and there's there is a uh a moving within our heart to understand god has an expectation too god is expecting us to bring forth and so when we look at that that the word itself would be reproduced in our life the living word of god god god doesn't want that is just a caring of a bible caring of a book or just a holding of a tape or of a picture that's not what god's desire is god's desire is that the word itself that god himself might dwell in the very hearts of his people and the word would be recognized in our life and so when jesus would say this and i'm just going to just just read a few scriptures of of the expectation in john finches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing there's no fruit can be produced by without him he's the strength of the church of the living god we live by his life paul would say for christ who is our life and he says if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned so this verse shows there is a need for a continued walk in him you see remember when when they would stand there and uh here john would stand there and they would come forth and john would say uh think not to say within yourself we have abraham as our father he's addressing the spirit of pride he says but bring forth fruits meat unto repentance so even there is repentance will actually show forth fruit in a life because repentance is where a life is heading this way and real repentance is a change of mind you're turning this way now you're no longer going that way so if a person is going this way and they say they've repented they've really not truly repented and there's not been fruit of repentance that's showing in their life so there is fruit that's ongoing within a life remember the scripture we just read god's not just interested in fruit the objective is much fruit are you with me it's not just fruits of of repentance or fruits of sanctification those are all wonderful fruits but it's coming into a place of much fruit which is his own life now moving to bring forth himself through the life of the individual so he says if ye abide in me oh i love the scripture if you abide in me and my words abide in you now these words this word here is not logos it's not just not just written words of god but it is rhema that word that is spoke by a living voice just as god in the beginning said let there be it was a living voice of god that was calling for the hour of expression of the word that was already sown and planted there so it took the voice of god that would be expressed in that hour the character of god that's what it is the characteristic of god that actually begins to awaken the characteristic of the seed that he's already sown because it is the voice of god that calls the seeds of god forth from potential to reality so if you abide in me and my words abide in you they they have a place in your life they're there they're they're taken into your life and you see god's word always ministers to the need of this hour god doesn't god does not busy himself with a bunch of fluff that ain't god fluffing god just tell you straight out it ain't god god is purposeful in every thing he does you shall ask me here's the thing you shall ask me what you will and it shall be done to you just like the examples of the testimonies that was given here god expressed a word and that word taken in though though they knew the promises of healing they could quote the promises of healing but a living god came down and expressed the characteristic of that word there was a deep calling to the teeth a desire for healing and god came on the scene and god spoke to that heart and now that life speaks and that word that's abiding in there it speaks out and says shoulder pain you're fired amen blisters you're fired is that right amen uh uh there are growths on the on the gall bladder you're fired and and the potential of this type of surgery see it's abiding in him god knows what you and i have need of sure there's opposition that comes our way sure there's hindrances but let me say this to you the word has everything that we have need of to address and meet the challenge of the hour what must i do if you abide in me and let his words don't just let them pass over but take them into your life amen gather them into your life then you shall ask what you will because the word is speaking to the desire of your heart and when you take that word in you are expressing god has seen your desire and god is expressing his desire for you to be free for you to be well for you to be filled god is expressing his word now it is not your voice but it is god's voice that is sealed within your voice and it shall be done unto you so it's it's abiding here in his word herein verse 8 is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples how many want to bear much fruit this is not the 30-fold hour it's not the 60-fold hour this is the 100-fold hour we're not living back in the days of justification we're not living back in the days of sanctification we're not living back in the days of the restoration of the gifts we're not living in a 30 40 60 50 80 we're not even living in a hundred and ninety-fold hour we're living in a hundred-fold hour where the son of man has returned to the church of the living god where there's a bride that's standing on her feet amen she's been assembled by god for this hour hallelujah so shall you be my disciples verse 16 ye have not chosen me but i chose you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit he's letting us know our purpose and that your fruit should remain oh my that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you in romans 7 verse 4 this is breaking in now on a union because with our first birth we were united with the first nature is that right nobody had to teach us how to lie nobody had to teach us all that it was already there in the nature is that right now but now god has made a way through the body of his death verse four wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god so you see god can't be married to that to that seed as long as the first husband's living is that right the first husband has to die is that right the first husband i'm not going into the whole scripture but our first nature has to die is that right and the spirit of god comes down to raise up that seed which is that new nature and he unites himself with that so it's no longer you but it is the real you on the inside that was dead now you've been raised to life is that right glory be to god that we should bring forth fruit unto god for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death that's the truth isn't it it worked it worked in remember i mean we had to yield to it if you you the drinking or yield to running around or what you had to yield to it but it was the nature that was within you as brother brown would say it like this an invisible union it was natural for you to want to cut your hair it was natural for you because why that was that first nature but when god comes down on the inside and god there's a death where that life says i'm finished i'm finished with this old life it's god inspiring you let me say this to you that's god inspiring you to say that i'm finished with this whole life i'm done with this whole life it's god inspiring you to say you're fired [Applause] it was god that had to get jacob when they're wrestling and wrestling and wrestling and he comes to a place and he says who are you the angel of the lord asked jacob who are you he needed jacob to identify himself as jacob that's real repentance i'm a no good rotten rascal lord i'm a filthy wretch and i'm in need of the blessing of almighty god upon my life and when god heard jacob say my name is jacob god said this is what i've been waiting on all this time but now you are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held see we were dead the seed was dead within us that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter you see david in this uh chapter we're reading here david had cried out oh lord god come back to us again we have sinned and have turned away from you you who dwells between the altar and the cherubim shine forth again for he knew that one time he was god among them and david knew that he was still god just like i had an individual walk across and stopped me yesterday and came into my driveway stopped me said hey he said i gotta ask a question he said i seen two weeks ago he said all these young people come into your house he said i see these things he said what is it that's taken place [Applause] what'd you do i preached jesus christ right there in the fulfillment of his word stood right at the end of the driveway in my socks and preached amen you know and we began to begin to declare you say what to begin to declare begin to declare that doctrine and theology is not enough basketball's fine having cookouts and all those things are fine i enjoy all those things and there's things that we can use like that but the ultimate what i spoke right there is they need to meet god in the baptism of the holy ghost i said there ain't enough souls that's big enough to handle the goliath that faces the young people in this hour now the theology and doctrine will never ever do it you can't keep them by church programs or nothing else but there's got to be a channel that can let god come back into the camp and manifest himself as the living god that god still delivers that though the temptations and the pressures themselves are great within this hour but there's a god who's on the scene that can handle every goliath he triumphed over every principality and over every power and god doesn't need a man of stature he just needs a ready yielded life that will allow god to be the same i won't preach the whole message but you you you see this was a time god among them amen god among them when it got done he said i ain't never heard it like that begin to go through the fulfillment of scriptures within this day you see david david knew that he was still god the people had separated themselves from him god didn't shine forth anymore it wasn't because he could not shine forth it was because the people shut off his mercies to them by their sin now remember where we pulled out last week and i'm going to lay on this because we laid this in already where israel was out in a place where god called them an empty vine in hosea 15. the only fruit they were bearing they had fruit but the fruit was all about them it was about themselves that was the only fruit they had you see this is why the spirit of god has it would give you an eye this example even in the message where brother branham would speak to an individual that my they took brother bram and we own this much land over here and we own this much here and our fathers this here and our fathers this here and brother branham being very very simple and sensitive to the holy spirit he asked the individual he said i see all of this that you have he said but i want to know how much do you own up there because all this will fade everything else will fade everything else will go away quickly is that right this is why that is to be the number one priority brother brown would open the message proving his word the very the second or third paragraph there in jeffersonville and he'd say it's the time to turn loose of everything else and cleave to the word of god don't let anything get between you and god you recognize it is your life my life it is contingent maturity is not an automatic given thing it is contingent upon abiding in him in his presence it's contingent it's not an automatic it's abiding in his presence so we don't want to divide it hard we we have to take counsel within these things even how paul would instruct uh you know within uh homes and marriages and everything else and paul would say that you would attend unto the lord without distraction there's things that has to be done but there's things that can be done without compromising the order if this is bothering then then get me a mic or something there there is there is an order that god has for things this is why you could say using this world same chapter without abusing it understand we're not here we're not here to you know that my that i'm to be so absorbed in this life that's not the purpose of god the purpose of god is to be absorbed in him and by him glory be to god in the highest you see now let me just lay this in here god had plucked up this vine he brought it out of egypt that's what that's what david is referring back to the vine you brought it out of egypt and you put it in a good place they were god's chosen they were already a vine of god even when they were in egypt egypt didn't make them not a vine of god it's just egypt was not a place that the vine of god could actually reveal or manifest itself as the vine of god just just when we see this somehow that god would move it he says brother brown would say like this i'm just referring i don't have these to display if a good vine isn't set in good ground it will not bring forth good fruits it depends on where the vine is planted it will determine the results of the crop so god picked israel out of a barren ground they were always a vine of god but they weren't bearing the fruit or witness through their life that they were a vine of god so what did god have to do god had to come and bring them from where they were and place them in good ground is that right so we find that within this you know this is what brother graham says you find many times he said good people but they're planted in the wrong place he said you find people that he said are catholics or presbyterian or that's the church that they're affiliated with it might even be some message church but he says they're planted in the wrong place well i'm going to preach anyhow they're planted in the wrong place there's no joy brother brahma identifies it no spiritual joy come on that's one of the that's one of the places there when those four those four powers came those four uh uh that same insect and through the four stages it took away and it ate away at the tree of the living god is that right they then had no meat or no meal offering or drink offering and when they themselves had no fruit to give to god to come and wash up that's what it was it was having something that they could come and worship come on now i'm not talking come and worship it i'm talking about coming with substance in your life there is fruit in your life there's a joy in your life i'm telling you this message is not a letter this message is the person of jesus christ revealed in this generation it brings the joy of the lord to the church of the living god it brings joy to a life when it's preached in by the same spirit and the author of life himself who is the life giver to the church of the living god how can you not see what god is doing it can there not be things going on in your life and you don't have joy but the reason joy stops is when there's a departure from the word joy ceases is that right you see good people brother ramble say good people he said but they're planted in the wrong place a ginger wine vine of god big now what he says planted in the wrong place because there's something within them that's stirring there's something within there that they can't even explain you you know how it was you see i was right here within the church but some of you come out of denominations and organizations and and you realize there was more for you well let me get right down and preach on those of us and say that that warm message pews we realized there was more than just coming to church we realized there was more than just well brother brown's a prophet or my daddy's this or my mama's this or or i know this brother or or i slept in this tent back we know there's more than that we know that this message came to bring a meeting with us and god that god would unite with his people it's not a club it's not a lodge it's not a membership it is a body that we are burst into by the holy ghost amen it can be a good good people just planted in the wrong place so i'm going to just say this the ground matters the ground matters now you know i you know that most of you know i enjoy planting things i enjoy you know tending to things and things like that i'm not a master gardener by no means whatsoever but i know there's certain places where you should plant stuff and where you shouldn't i know there's certain soil and i've experienced that just sometimes because of failure with things sometimes the way the light comes in does it get enough light and those of you know whether tomato plants or whatever it is you ground matters now i want to just say this to you when we talk of ground in the scripture we are talking of this here we we look at two and i don't want to say two places but we can look at two things first of all the scripture would talk about good ground in terms of where the seed is sown and good ground meaning that where that word is sown some is on stony ground and and some you know on the other three types of ground but then there is good ground good ground is that of the predestinated seed womb of god but that good ground that part of it that's not what i'm focused on right now but you get that ground in the right ground you get that seed in the right ground and that red ground is christ because it's in him it's it's in him he is the ordained ground where believers belong he's the ordained ground that lets you and i know you always were a son and daughter of god it's nothing you did to make yourself a son and daughter of god you always were you weren't a dog become a sheep or i was a honorary pig become a sheep no you always were but you couldn't be recognized in egypt you had to come into the good ground and the good ground is christ himself the word it has all the nutrients that's needed for the hour you get in this good ground it don't have to be patted on the back and you know little cutesy spray here and promise you this if you come to church or if you do it no sir you're not in the good ground yet but when you get in the good ground you put your feelings in your pocket and your soul on the altar come on friends it's time to lay aside feelings all the complexes where everything's always everybody else's fault it's time to start looking in the mirror and say god bring a change lord bring a dissolving in my life oh my psalms 1 1 blessed is the man let's look at this ground a minute blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly so he's not there with the ungodly what are the ungodly those that speak against the word god called them wicked when they raised their tongue against moses corey and dathan they might have been you know they might have won citizen of the year awards but when they stood against the revealed word of the hour god called them wicked is that right blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly come on we we shouldn't be under the influence of this world if you find yourself being a channel to echo all of their sentiments you need to get out of the counsel of the ungodly your voice was not meant to be a voice that pumps all this voice from the world and all this divisive air you weren't meant to be a political voice you weren't meant how can you let yourself be so low as to get in the counsel of the ungodly we are called we are called to a liberty to be a voice of almighty god there is one promised land there is one hope and that is in jesus christ nor standeth in the way of sinners you know a person can say i've been in the way a long time and they're right they've been in the way of everybody they stood in the way of everybody complained and everything else but don't stand in the way of sinners he does not standeth in the way of sinners he does not that is not his fellowship come on now nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful those conditions i just read are all egypt egypt is not a place babylon is not a place it's a condition hallelujah but his delight verse 2 in the law of the lord his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night this individual is consumed with god you know when you meditate on god he draws near he draws an ear god told joshua meditate on it amen because what you dwell on you find when you meditate on the word begin to take it in you say brother simon i'm just too busy then you're too busy to meditate on the word of god it brings his presence there's things that god begins to open and god begins to reveal this is part of delighting thyself in the lord verse three and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper why because of where he's planted he's not just set out he's planted you see god already this planting is god is already has the ordained place in our life our the ordained place is to be planted by the river the rivers of living water one water but many rivers one god flowing out there are nine spiritual gifts one god flowing out through the church of the living god he is a tree that is planted not just set out but is implanted and is established and the joy of the lord is pulsating through that life bringing forth his fruit whose fruit god's fruit in his season who's his season the prophet's season when god sends his prophet because the prophet is one who comes with the word to call forth this is the hour this is the time this is our season glory be to god in the highest think of this here let me just let me move on here we see this that within it there are many other places that i could refer to within this part but this good ground as we're saying it is by once period we are baptized into this choice place which is christ which is the word this is where paul would write that in in ephesians of where he hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ and he would go on to say for all the promises of god in him are yea and amen is that right now when we think back to this so we recognize there must be that of the good ground and so when we think of this israel as david is is expressing this by the spirit of god i want to say like this there is something more that was needed than just god just to bring them back into the land because they were already in the land of israel they needed something more let me just say what i'm what i'm what i'm trying to say they needed more than just to have another repeat or another cycle where they come back and you know they come back and remember they would cry out to god and god would send them you know a judge god would raise up an individual and they would you know begin to cry out to god and and god would deliver them and then after a period of time here they are right back in the in in doing the same things that that god brought them out of you know they they needed something more and this is what david the spirit of god is expressing through david which holds a great type for our life and where you and i are at in this hour when we look at in each one of the other seven ages that has went forth when the church entered the very first church age she was already a fallen woman is that right remember from whence thou hast fallen right where did they fall from pentecost is that right they fell away from the original power and authority and glory then you find down through the age as it comes into a dark age and here you find that the bride is cut down the bride tree is cut down and the life goes into the ground in the satire age it goes where does the seed have to go into dirt the denominations is the dirt come on now you know i don't you know i'm quoting i'm speaking of these things it goes right into the dirt but then it begins to come up and that in luther it begins to sprout forth then it comes a little bit more and wesley then here we find it now at the beginning of the lady you'll see an age we find the restoration of the gifts where pentecost the supernatural is beginning to return to the church of the living god what's god doing god is making a way for himself to come fully into his church glory be to god so when it would come back into this moment because we're even under luther there are things that luther himself being a reformer not a prophet that luther himself even got tangled up with things there are things you find even with wesley they're things that you find even among even though they were messengers of god but they can only they could only speak according to the light of the word that was revealed for that hour you know how it is right now you can't take that our plants cannot take the intensity of the august sun right now it's got to come into that place to be able to handle that light though the plants are calling out more light more light more light but it can only handle the certain intensity and that's the way it has been with the program of almighty god the bible says that the path of the justice as a shining light that shines brighter and brighter and brighter unto that perfect day so hear the word itself to come into a place in this hour we've not come to a station we've not come to a point that when we got to this point that's not where we're at the message that god has sent to you and i in this hour we have been united with jesus christ in his fullness it is the revealing of the son of man back in the church of the living god this way i can say rejoice and be glad and make merry for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready it's time not just to the baptism of the holy ghost it's time it's the baptism of the holy ghost moving out into my father's house there are many mansions [Applause] glory be to god we're here in the time there's something something was needed something greater because each stage of the of the plant itself it died has the life moved on it's got to come back the whole the whole part it must come back to the original planting it must come back to the grain again is that right so something more was needed this is why david as he would say in verse 14 return we beseech thee oh god of host look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch which thou hath made us strong for thyself god had brought him out of egypt he had put him in a in a good land the choice land i'm talking about in the natural through that first exodus he brought them out of egypt brought him into the land of promise and what lay in their life remember their mothers you take leah and uh rachel here they were and others as they were giving birth to the children there of jacob they would call out the name and it was the inspiration of god coming down that gave him utterance of that name and in that name laid the mystery of their life he laid their position laid the identity of who they really were why when certain ones among them the different ones they certainly like certain delicacies and this one over here saying no we're a cattle well god weren't interested in making the cattle raisers you know delicacy people you know bakers and flowers on top and all that god wasn't interested in that neither did he want the bakers to become farmers god wanted them to abide every man in his own calling amen that god would unfold and what he had shown up in that life once they got into the choice crown the mystery that was in their life would actually be unfolded god planted them in a good ground as a matter of fact brother bram said he soaked the ground of palestine with the blood of heifers and and and lambs but that blood was not sufficient it was only a type it was only speaking there was going to come a blood where this vine of god would be able to stand in the presence of god justified would be able to stand there identified in a blood that has so changed their life they would be able to stand there with the confidence not looking over their back but a confidence that causes them to look forward because the past is not only behind them it's been done away with amen and no one could do it but god himself god didn't send the second man down god came himself hallelujah god didn't send the secretary down god claimed himself let me just say in every generation god has not sent a secretary god has brought himself on the scene just in case you forgot you didn't bring him into your life he brought himself in there you didn't get good enough to bring him in he brought his self in he provided what was needed so that your life might be a place that he could come and dwell in hallelujah oh my no wonder here let me read a few of the prophecies that not only would pertain to israel coming in the land in the natural but where god would take them because of what they needed they needed something greater and in exodus 15 when you know moses got a little pentecostal there moses got to you know he said you know what there ain't a song there's got to be a new song on this one oh lord notice this in exodus 15 17 thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place oh lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary oh lord which thy hands have established the lord shall reign forever and ever notice even in the face of what would just taken place god was not only speaking he would bring israel in naturally into that land but god was speaking there would be a bride on earth that he himself would cause us to pass through the red sea he would bring us into the place that we were to be planted in and it also spoke of when god himself will bring israel and establish israel in that land of christ himself glory be to god i can say it like this there is a place if you've been up and down and in and out and everything else there's a place that you can climb into in christ to where your faith now becomes energized operated by on by the very power of god where it's no longer your faith but now it's the faith of the son of god it's a victory in your life there's a place to climb into in him a place to be planted in him god says here speaking of him himself as he will bring them in the 144 000 but this applies to us look what he says amos 9 14 and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them god don't want new things god wants build up what was already there i'm not talking about the fallen condition i'm talking about that god himself he said i will restore when isaac was down there in career the spirit of god moved upon his heart and he began to dig the wells that his father abraham dug and he called him under the same name i'm telling you we are not digging in foreign places but god has spoke to us in this hour and he directed us right back into the word we're not trying to find new things out here but it's digging into the wells of the word we find out of that truth of predestination we find out the reality of the baptism of the holy ghost we find out the living realities of the living god why we're digging in the same places that abraham does we're digging in the same places that paul dug peter doug hallelujah might i say it we're digging in the same places where brother random dug [Applause] our father in the gospel and i will notice inhabit them and you shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be pulled out of their land which i have given them saith the lord god when god plants something here because in the natural the natural in itself could not hold on because the life there wasn't no life in the blood that could coincide or come back upon the worshipper and bring a change in their life this is why when god has done a planting in a life it's no longer well i don't know if i'm gonna make it i don't know if i can hold on it ain't about whether you can make it or whether you can hold on it's christ in you it's a pulsation of his life your desires of the world have fled from your life he is your desire thy people isaiah 60 verse 21 thy people also now this even speaking of this time that god will bring them in thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land forever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified i don't have time to preach on this but do you realize even in the time of the millennium it's a memorial we're under the feast of tabernacles and god is going to display to those who are raised up because we will raise up those who've not heard the gospel come on it's a direct quote that ain't out of the scripture that's all the way through the old testament and god will point out here here they were there will be a declaration in that hour that what i said back here i have fulfilled it amen and we will teach them the ways of the god of jacob come on now blessed be the name of the lord oh my i can't even i can't even get into that but you understand see god has a way this is why god does the same thing in your life right now when your life where people said they'll never get over this they'll never get free of this oh boy they're really twisted up now man look at their life and whatever more but god take a life where the world has wrote it off and the world says there's no way and even you think in your heart there's no way but there's something beneath the darkness that's calling out and god moves down and he takes a life that yields itself in his hand and god says this is the kind of trophies and lives that i make my reputation on anybody know what i'm talking about god can put his hand upon our life and say he's glorified and alive a life that was rolled off a life that maybe was headed for skid row or whatever it might be headed for hell we were going in that direction we didn't know we had a position in this land we did not know who we really were but god came by our way there was something more that had to happen in our life we had to meet him israel was not in egypt naturally now where david is speaking of they're not even in egypt naturally now they were in egypt spiritually they needed deliverance they needed a visitation from the lord you see it got to come down to the right conditions must be the right conditions you see god he works on both ends god help me to bring this he works on both ends before god could send israel or moses back down to egypt with a message that the people had to be ready to receive they weren't ready at first so god had to get moses out and prepare him and we know all that but see then when it comes back they had to be ready those are the right conditions it takes god brother brown would tell us an invisible union he said when you take a people that goes to longing to line up with the word he said god will send a message at that time to bring those people in line where did that longing come from well you know my daddy my mama no it was sunday school my sunday school teacher was soaked no where did that longing come from it come from god he was placed in your heart in that seed there was a longing may i borrow the words of the prophet a minute amen and god rich in mercy he said how many of you can fellowship with me on this thought you are a young boy a young girl and there was something calling inside of your heart there's got to be a god somewhere there's got to be a reality somewhere you might have been sitting in a church somewhere where but there's there's something about there's a longing there's a longing what is it that's what god has placed within you that only he can satisfy that's why you can never just stop with this or that or this or that there's a longing because there is a place that you are ordained to be planted in and the prophet simply called it this he said that's the foreknowledge of god taking place in your life hallelujah just as god called israel back from this nation and this nation and this nation and this nation it's the same god by the sounding of his word in this hour that you and i are living in it's a call that's going out it's a draw that's going out what's it pulling you to not a church not a personality but he is gathering all things unto himself hallelujah the right conditions these things here within this moment and god works in that life to bring it to the right condition think think of here of of of of of rebecca here within this here eliezer shows up and here comes rebecca out this is not a coincidence it's evening time it's evening time it's evening time for the church of the living god it's evening time it's the time for the bride of isaac and here she comes out to the to the well and she begins to draw water eliezer doesn't have to prompt her she sees this and she says i'll draw can i'll draw water for your camels also god brother bradman says it like this the angel of the lord beat the servant of the lord there 30 minutes before he got there to deal with her heart i'm telling you that same angel the lord it's not only on earth he's here [Applause] that same angel of the lord that deals with your heart deals with my heart even before the word is coming forth in his presence to mature us he has him that is moving upon our hearts i'm just going to stop there today but i'm going to speak a little bit more i think of how brother branham as he comes into go pray for sister georgie carter he comes into this place he's got to pass through south boston and you know at one point it's called new boston whatever i went through that place last year and when there's no stoplight there it's i mean it's literally it's like um well i don't even know how to even compare it it's just like a little gas station or whatever it was there but it's just it's very old there's nothing i mean and you're just corn fields right there you know it just but remember brother brown was going along in that vision of where this lamb was crying out here he's got to come to that place in south boston and here's a man with to be to come out to him and that man supposed to tell him where her house is god could have told the prophet everything right i mean when we're thinking he's here here god would pick him up right as he stood here in this dimension but show him in another dimension and he would hear prayers being prayed and what brother brown said that's the land called prayer prayers that you think god oh god ain't hurt no he said they're out there it's his words it's right out there in a land called prayer and here god is directing him and he almost passes it up he passes up his turn he starts feeling checked he gets out of the car you know puts his foot on the bumper takes off his hat and he says god i feel this way this strange way and as he's praying he looks up and he that's the graveyard back there i was supposed to turn down that road god is in control to me these are more than visions amen about georgie carter these are more than visions these are things that god shows you and i this is how i lead my people if you keep your eyes on me there are certain things and you're sensitive to me and pay attention to what i'm telling you and come out and don't override it brother branham had overrode it and kept on going he would have missed a sign that he needed to be pay attention to because that sign would tell him get off of this road and go down that road here he comes into south boston or new boston he comes into this place he pulls they pull up there he tells them and he tells them in the car and says now there's going to be a guy come out of this little store coming up here he's wearing bibbed overhauls yellow overhauls or whatever and he's supposed to tell me where to go the man didn't know that but god knew it the man didn't know he was in the vision god knew he was in the vision you didn't know you were in the vision of the word but god knew you're in the vision of the word [Applause] right conditions it's god working and here the man comes out of that store about the time as the prophet is pulling up there and he comes across the street brother brandon rolls down the window he said sir you're to tell me where the house of carter is at and the man begins to talk and he starts crying and brother brahms said what it was he didn't know he was in the vision but the effect of the vision being fulfilled brought that reaction in his life i'm telling you we're under the effect of the vision of the word in this hour it's having an effect upon our lives we didn't know we were in the vision but god knew we were in the vision god saw you and i marching right in step with the word of almighty god we didn't know it but god knew we were in the vision and now it's the effect of the vision of the word [Music] in our life will stand if i be lifted up he said i'll draw all men unto me there's an inward drawing that's taking place hallelujah even as every head is bowed i just stopped there i just admonished you this if you've never come into that place yet that place that we spoke about where there's something more there's something more for you i invite you come into that place with him come into that place this is a a wonderful opportunity and an invitation the time i'm not worthy no but he's made you worthy he's made you worthy but say i can't get good enough i know that he knows that too what must i do you must accept what the blood has already done for you renounce the devil renounce his lies renounce sin and accept what god has already done for you amen let god impart his life let him let him come right there you can come to this altar he can meet you at your seat too god comes where he's invited right in our lives right now you could say lord let me be faithful to the vision help me lord help me lord help me to be faithful to the vision lord let my life help me this just i want to stay anybody say lord i want to stay under your presence in my life lord continuing to mature and mature and mature oh my think of what happened when cain was confronted with his wrong what did he do he fled he fled to the land of nod nod means wandering wandering the bible said he went out from the presence of the lord but as a child of god oh my in our first birth we were cain's birth we were canes there was no blood that could take care of cain but then came the blood of the lord jesus that blood was able that blood was able there was a life inside of that blood that could raise up the real spiritual ables on the inside of our life church couldn't do it but he came amen lord jesus i want to abide in your presence lord i want to dwell lord god how your life lord conditions us you move upon the heart lord as you did in our lives from the very beginning drawing us in repentance you did not draw drag us up an eye or drag us wherever it was it was a surrender it was lord god and acknowledgement of our sin that we we need deliverance we need help lord it's been you outside of your presence lord god oh my we could have known that we lord have problems or this or that but it's in your presence where things can take place lord jesus i know lord god father what you've done in my life in the life lord and many others lord right here where your presence lord god has come to bring such a transformation in our life to where we can stand like paul it's no longer i that liveth but christ that liveth in me and lord jesus in that presence lord god we stand here this morning like david one thing have i desired and that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord forever as paul would go on to say i count myself not to be perfect but rather i seek to apprehend that which i'm apprehended of oh god grant it lord father i pray this morning the lord if there's one here that doesn't know you in that way they've never climbed into that place it's already provided the blood has already been shed and the voice of this blood now speaks liberty peace deliverance overcoming power authority sonship it speaks god granted this morning i prayed lord i ask lord sweeping throughout this congregation over every heart and every life lord i ask lord jesus help us the lord in our lives every one of us lord may we lord god so carefully diligently evaluate our lives not in our own self lord but under your spiritual mri sometimes lord things that can enter in or get us sidetracked from the real purpose in our life lord as i read a text that lord god a much older minister this morning sent out on one of the threads that i'm on to me with such words of wisdom of what was spoken he said there's times sometimes that i feel like just going on i feel like sometimes that mom just so tired but as he went on to say i realize he said that i cannot find that in the scripture with the lord jesus he desired to carry on to fulfill the purpose that he was called for he went on lord to say words like this as we are put here for a purpose there's a reason we can be the biggest battleship that would be in the water but if we lose purpose we're no more than just like a little canoe god help us this morning lord maybe there's some here this morning the lord in their life they might be looking what's purpose and they've maybe had purpose already before but lord they're looking in their life lord what purpose do you have for me now lord jesus may you just move right up next to that heart and let them know you're not finished with them lord may you strengthen them lord may you encourage them maybe there's one more person that they're to witness to lord maybe there's something else lord god but whatever it might be lord we are not going anywhere until that purpose is fulfilled lord jesus for the young people that are here for every one of us lord o god may you reach lord to their hearts lord i pray that lord if there's any maybe they've lord the things just cares of life not not things lord that would be sinful that's that's gone from their hearts they they don't desire the things of the world at all lord you've you've completely delivered and done such a work in their life but lord maybe there's been a misplacing of priorities god they sense lord as you are speaking to their heart they realize lord i i want to continue to grow i i want the fruit to come forth from my life i want to reflect him lord jesus just as we would have an eclipse upon this earth and it's when lord something gets or upon the moon rather it's when the earth the world gets in the way of the sun and the moon lord help us this morning may we be real sensitive and lord really just invite you and say lord i don't want anything lord [Music] my purpose maybe you find yourself seems like the joy of the lord just isn't there as it ought to be in your life it just isn't there you find yourself having to make yourself do things and there's times when the flesh it does get weak but why not just evaluate [Music] is there things that's come in the way [Music] maybe you come to church but there's no meat offering to bring there's no drink offering to bring it's as though that maybe your life is just drying up but right now this morning you'd like to ask the lord restore to me the joy of thy salvation lord restore lord restore grant it lord jesus lord we're asking right now that the life of the vine lord jesus that has you been pulsating in these services lord paul said lord i pray through these branches lord grant it lord granted lord jesus lord even in this moments lord we want to grow we want to grow we don't lord god want to walk around and be like spiritual dwarfs lord god no no we want to grow lord we want to grow we want to bring forth fruit lord god we're not living in the 30-fold hour 60-fold hour this is the 100-fold hour lord oh jesus granted lord may the lord god the sight be renewed may the vision be renewed lord god lord just in the simplicity of the heart just to welcome you back just to welcome you back say lord i've let things get in the way maybe things that you've tried to take care of things that you've tried to iron out but i'm sure you find out if you haven't found out by now anything that you try to do of your own strength and your own accord you're resting on your own arm of strength and god will never bless that [Music] it'll never prosper so why not just say lord freshly this morning freshly but i just want to surrender myself a fresh lord to samuel you don't know these problems i got in my life but but he knows about him he knows about him why don't you just invite him his word is true if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you father we commit lord these words i commit every soul into your hand lord jesus knowing that lord god you provided the conditions you move upon the hearts it's you that stirs the water it's you that directed rebecca at that moment granted lord in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen oh my can we just let's just worship him oh my aren't you glad if you think about that vision he led you out of that gas station like he led that man out of that gas station in the in the in the cover halls aren't you glad that he moved on your heart said this is the time go go this is the time this is the moment this is the time and here the word the vision of the word begins to break on your life it begins to open the joys of the lord aren't you glad that he moved on your heart aren't you glad you had something to respond aren't you glad there was something in you that could capture and respond to his voice hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah hallelujah brian
