[53:17] hallelujah sometimes you know you just
[53:20] don't even think the word thank you just
[53:22] don't seem like a knife you feel like
[53:24] that I just I don't feel like thank you
[53:26] even as a is enough many times I said
[53:28] Lord forgive me I seem like I don't have
[53:31] words that I want to express to you but
[53:35] I so appreciate the the mercy of God he
[53:38] has truly given to us life and life more
[53:41] abundantly John chapter 14 verse 10
[53:46] that's where I'd like to begin pick up
[53:48] this morning
[53:49] amen just so thankful to be here with
[53:54] you
[53:57] Lord willing you know that this coming
[54:00] Thursday will leave for the Philippines
[54:02] but the Giri and myself and then we
[54:06] return I think it's that first Monday
[54:08] night leaving back out of there in
[54:13] November I think it's November 2nd or
[54:14] 3rd I know I got to be back here before
[54:16] that wedding so I think over there I
[54:24] think over here I'll leave out on a
[54:26] Sunday night it helps me because I don't
[54:28] like to be going along if I could I just
[54:31] do three days and leave and come back I
[54:33] love the people but I'm a homebody I
[54:36] like being here and and it's you know I
[54:39] want to be here I feel like I've said to
[54:41] my wife and said to others I said I
[54:43] don't feel like I've got enough
[54:44] services to preach everything that I
[54:48] feel that that is necessary and but God
[54:51] knows God knows that some of you get
[54:54] nervous I'm not going to create more
[54:56] services but I that's really how I feel
[54:58] and it's not it's not necessarily more
[55:01] preaching but remember what the Word of
[55:03] God does it makes us aware the Holy
[55:06] Spirit comes down and makes us aware of
[55:08] what that he has already given to us
[55:11] makes it and he's makes it real to us so
[55:15] Lord willing we're over there and I
[55:17] really really covered your prayers we
[55:19] the heart of the of the truth we've got
[55:23] is is there youth retreat so I have
[55:27] about four I have about four sessions
[55:29] I'll be doing the morning teaching
[55:31] sessions on some things that pertain to
[55:34] the young people at that time and then
[55:37] we have the convention right after that
[55:39] and then we'll be stepping back on a
[55:42] plane and coming back home I might be
[55:45] able to fly without the plane they put a
[55:49] picture of my wife in front of me and
[55:51] and my children and and of course you
[55:53] all are always before me I get sad
[55:55] thinking about leaving and that's really
[55:58] how that's really how it is from my
[55:59] heart so brother Alexander McGillis will
[56:02] be here this coming Thursday and Sunday
[56:04] and then the following week brother Dale
[56:08] Smith from Buford South Carolina he will
[56:11] be here on Thursday and Sunday as well
[56:14] so brother Dale it's been a few years
[56:16] since brother Dale's been here but I I
[56:18] know you'll get a real blessing out of
[56:20] it so and I'll tell you what I've just
[56:24] been enjoying the Ministry of the word I
[56:26] really have been I come back from you
[56:29] know North Carolina and I enjoy just set
[56:31] here in feeding it's it's a lot of times
[56:34] I it's kind of rare that I get that but
[56:36] I love to be able to do that and I'll
[56:39] tell you what God has certainly been
[56:41] speaking to us there is no break in the
[56:45] economy of God there is a continuity of
[56:47] the Holy Spirit among every one of us
[56:51] amen I just think of it I was talking
[56:54] with the when I was in North Carolina
[56:56] was talking with brother Brian Naidu
[56:59] from South Africa and we were speaking
[57:01] and some of the things we were speaking
[57:03] about and and I just had told him I said
[57:05] these are some things I said I was
[57:06] debating on speaking in this meeting and
[57:08] and and and he said oh my goodness he
[57:11] said I just had spoke on those things
[57:13] you see it don't matter where we're at
[57:15] it's the same Holy Ghost same Holy Ghost
[57:18] so amen well let's get on the word I
[57:22] could talk to you all day John 14 10
[57:27] believe us Val not that I am in the
[57:30] father and the father in me
[57:35] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[57:38] not of myself but the father that
[57:42] dwelleth in me he doeth the works now I
[57:47] want you to look at this now the words
[57:49] that I speak unto you I speak not of my
[57:53] self but the father that dwelleth in me
[57:58] he doeth the works believe me that I am
[58:04] in the father and the father in me or
[58:07] else believe me for the very works sake
[58:12] very verily I say unto you he that
[58:14] believeth on me the works that I do
[58:18] shall he do also and greater works than
[58:23] these shall he do because I go unto my
[58:27] father now he recognized what greater
[58:31] greater would mean not more in quality
[58:35] but more in quantity and to remember
[58:38] that the greater works that would be
[58:41] done it's even it's it's beyond just
[58:44] laying hands on the sick and then being
[58:47] healed that is a part of it but it is
[58:50] dealing with his life coming in to the
[58:54] Church of the Living God his redeemed
[58:56] body and then that same life moving
[58:59] through and the imparting of that same
[59:02] life
[59:03] it's about his life the continuation of
[59:06] his life because remember if the sicker
[59:09] healed and everything else and there's
[59:11] no continuation of his life then Jesus
[59:14] does not claim that church there there
[59:18] must be a continuation of that life amen
[59:22] amen we see that all the way through the
[59:25] gospel so here in verse 13 and
[59:28] whatsoever you ask in my name that will
[59:32] I do that the father may be glorified in
[59:36] the son he shall ask anything in my name
[59:39] I will do it verse 15 if you love me
[59:43] keep my Commandments I'll tell you
[59:48] that's a real key right there
[59:50] many times this the lack of that verse
[59:53] right there is what keeps people from
[59:55] receiving the Holy Ghost so realize you
[59:59] fall in love with you and whatever he
[1:00:02] says to you do it is that right if you
[1:00:07] love me keep my Commandments and I verse
[1:00:10] 16 and I will pray the father and he
[1:00:13] shall give you another comforter that he
[1:00:18] may abide with you forever even the
[1:00:22] Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[1:00:25] receive because it seeth him not neither
[1:00:30] knoweth him but you know him for he
[1:00:34] dwelleth with you and shall be in you I
[1:00:39] will not I love this verse I will not
[1:00:43] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:00:48] yet a little while and the world seeth
[1:00:51] me no more but ye see me because I live
[1:00:54] ye shall live also out that day ye shall
[1:00:58] know that I am in my father and ye and
[1:01:01] me and I in you amen god bless you amen
[1:01:06] bless the reading his words your being
[1:01:07] seated
[1:01:11] I want to continue to deal we've been
[1:01:18] looking at the promise of the Father and
[1:01:20] what is the Holy Ghost and not that I
[1:01:27] would think for a moment that we are
[1:01:29] ignorant of that but I realize that we
[1:01:31] have new ones young ones but I believe
[1:01:35] that it's for all of us and I believe
[1:01:37] that the preaching of the word of God if
[1:01:39] we if we miss this you miss everything
[1:01:43] if you know all of the teachings and
[1:01:46] doctrines and know all the word and yet
[1:01:48] you missed the life you miss everything
[1:01:49] because all of the teaching and all of
[1:01:53] the life in everything was to point us
[1:01:55] into a place that this same life would
[1:01:59] dwell within you and I as sons and
[1:02:01] daughters of God so this is the very
[1:02:04] this is the very heart of the gospel is
[1:02:07] that this life would manifest the rain
[1:02:10] and the victory of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] through our lives and when we we
[1:02:16] recognize as he says here in verse 16
[1:02:19] this word comforter and we'll read it in
[1:02:22] not multiple places here in the
[1:02:23] scripture this morning and when we we
[1:02:26] look at it he says I will pray the
[1:02:28] father and he shall give you another
[1:02:30] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:02:34] forever now then when we look at this he
[1:02:37] said I will pray I will make the request
[1:02:41] because he is the true atonement where
[1:02:46] God has become one of us it was God in
[1:02:51] Christ as Paul said reconciling the
[1:02:54] world unto himself not imputing our
[1:02:58] trespasses to think about it God coming
[1:03:02] down and creating a body and stepping
[1:03:05] into it not because we were worthy but
[1:03:11] he himself alone is the only one that
[1:03:14] can redeem us there was there's no other
[1:03:18] creator but Almighty God
[1:03:21] Satan's are perverted but is not a
[1:03:23] creator but God created a blood cell
[1:03:28] that he could come down and pay the
[1:03:31] price and then through that offering
[1:03:33] would be able to transmit this life back
[1:03:37] into you and I as as believers and I
[1:03:40] want should not not to dwell upon this
[1:03:42] this morning but we recognized that the
[1:03:44] Holy Ghost is not something that doesn't
[1:03:47] belong to us but the Holy Ghost belongs
[1:03:51] to sons and daughters of God it is alive
[1:03:55] that was promised to us so that in the
[1:03:58] receiving of the Holy Ghost it is God
[1:04:02] actually receiving you and I back into
[1:04:06] himself he makes complete provision that
[1:04:09] you and I can come back and dwell within
[1:04:13] him it's all His redemptive work he
[1:04:17] ascended to to the throne of God where
[1:04:20] he is our perpetuation for our sin he
[1:04:24] made me think of this God made me pay
[1:04:27] for my sin in him Isaiah 53 is very
[1:04:33] clear this is the report of Almighty God
[1:04:37] in that who hath believed our reports he
[1:04:41] made me pay for my sin in him the ransom
[1:04:44] has already been paid
[1:04:47] now the request is made the scripture we
[1:04:50] read now that request is made by the
[1:04:52] body of the Lord Jesus Christ ascending
[1:04:56] on high and remember here he comes up
[1:04:59] from the grave and remember he told Mary
[1:05:01] he said don't touch me for I have not
[1:05:04] yet ascended he ascended up and to think
[1:05:07] how quickly this was done he ascended up
[1:05:09] was presented the one who is accepted
[1:05:13] and remember there other Old Testament
[1:05:16] Saints that had been waiting on the
[1:05:18] promise of the Messiah to come remember
[1:05:21] the the Bible says he led captivity
[1:05:23] captive and here they are walking up
[1:05:27] the earth for about a period of 30 to 40
[1:05:29] days the Bible says in the book of Acts
[1:05:31] chapter 1 that he met with his disciples
[1:05:33] for 40 days they were scattered but he
[1:05:37] gathered them together and when he
[1:05:39] brought them then together remember he
[1:05:42] led them out there to the Mount all of
[1:05:45] it and as he led them out the Bible said
[1:05:48] he ascended up before them and as he
[1:05:51] ascended up as they're standing there
[1:05:53] looking and you know gazing think of it
[1:05:56] the angel said at that time why stand
[1:05:59] you here
[1:06:00] gazing I believe was on my heart it was
[1:06:04] an announcement you're looking at here
[1:06:07] the glowing away but there is a promise
[1:06:10] that he said if I go away I'm coming
[1:06:13] back and he was just talking about the
[1:06:16] second corporal coming but he said I
[1:06:19] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:06:23] come to you can't you see how the angels
[1:06:26] of God even present about our life when
[1:06:29] the angels of God the true angels of God
[1:06:32] encourage us in the promises that are
[1:06:35] for us amen they encourage us to take
[1:06:40] the real presence of God believers one
[1:06:43] of another it is the encouragement in
[1:06:46] the promises of God to wear that Paul
[1:06:48] would say we are to exhort one another
[1:06:51] we are to comfort one another I'm
[1:06:54] telling you that is what that comfort
[1:06:56] and that exhortation is because of his
[1:06:58] life within us that makes that word real
[1:07:02] so it is no longer just our words when
[1:07:05] we speak exhortation when we comfort one
[1:07:08] another it is Christ in us encouraging
[1:07:12] one another Paul called him like this in
[1:07:17] the opening of Corinthians the God of
[1:07:19] all comfort now the requests the body
[1:07:24] has entered in now to set upon the right
[1:07:28] hand of God on the throne of God
[1:07:30] now here he is seated there the body of
[1:07:34] Jesus Christ entered back in with the
[1:07:37] resurrected Saints I wish I could preach
[1:07:39] on that for a little bit but as they
[1:07:41] ascended up remember David said he will
[1:07:43] open unto me the gates of salvation when
[1:07:46] they ascended out remember a gate is a
[1:07:48] place of transaction and when they
[1:07:51] ascended up remembered there was a cry
[1:07:54] from the inside that said who is this
[1:07:57] king of gold and when they asked the
[1:08:00] call from inside the city there were
[1:08:02] saints that were there at that moment
[1:08:04] that were able to answer definitively it
[1:08:08] is the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord mighty
[1:08:12] in battle and when they spoke of the
[1:08:16] transaction that took place on Calvary
[1:08:19] they felt the effect of that transaction
[1:08:22] when that life itself went down to hell
[1:08:25] but hell could not contain it health of
[1:08:28] not wholly a member plane could not hold
[1:08:31] it there it rose in triumph on that
[1:08:33] Easter morning and it brought with them
[1:08:35] the Saints that had been waiting and had
[1:08:38] been looking for that promise and as
[1:08:40] they Rosa
[1:08:41] they had a testimony brother they had a
[1:08:44] witness they had a proclamation hey you
[1:08:47] got the same kind of proclamation who is
[1:08:50] this King of glory
[1:08:51] who is this triumphant one who is this
[1:08:54] word of God that you speak up who is
[1:08:57] this Emmanuel who is this victorious one
[1:09:00] you can say it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:04] in me Christ his name
[1:09:07] Laurie he entered back in to glory and
[1:09:13] he sent back the Holy Ghost
[1:09:16] a man is the comforter the Spirit of
[1:09:20] Truth
[1:09:21] verse 17 said for he dwelleth with you
[1:09:24] and shall be in you it's a very key the
[1:09:30] Word was made flesh but now the word
[1:09:36] must be made flesh in them see the word
[1:09:40] was dwelling with him but the purpose is
[1:09:44] that the word might come to dwell in
[1:09:46] them when God sends his word his message
[1:09:52] to every generation it's God visiting
[1:09:55] that generation remember the seven stars
[1:09:57] are in the right hand right hand of
[1:10:00] Almighty God here as it says in
[1:10:03] Revelations 1 and it speaks of the peace
[1:10:05] and everything that comes from the true
[1:10:07] atonement there must come that life that
[1:10:11] that that the believers are called to in
[1:10:14] that age that same life must come to a
[1:10:17] place of reproducing the life of the
[1:10:21] Lord Jesus Christ to actually bring
[1:10:22] forth the life the world
[1:10:24] that's ministry you realize that the
[1:10:28] Ministry of the word that you're under
[1:10:30] here in this church if you go out there
[1:10:33] and live any different way your approach
[1:10:36] your life must be an example of what's
[1:10:39] preached here so if you go out there and
[1:10:43] you run around and you live in your way
[1:10:45] and you and you do all sorts of things
[1:10:47] you are not a you are misrepresenting
[1:10:49] good truth of Jesus Christ that is
[1:10:52] preached here and I don't know how to
[1:10:56] polish it up but your hypocrite but you
[1:10:58] don't have to be a hypocrite
[1:11:01] you don't have to be a hypocrite you can
[1:11:05] live with that light on the inside of
[1:11:07] you
[1:11:09] is that right it should be a reflection
[1:11:12] of the light of the word that is
[1:11:15] ministered and the notice you know when
[1:11:17] we look at this what the holy ghost is
[1:11:19] it is the Spirit of Christ within us
[1:11:22] it's a sign we talked about that the
[1:11:24] sign of circumcision a seal a covenant
[1:11:27] it is the same spirit of God in the
[1:11:31] Church of the Living God think of it you
[1:11:34] know when Jesus would say here he is
[1:11:36] standing here and he would say I always
[1:11:38] do that which is pleasing to my father
[1:11:43] hallelujah
[1:11:45] this must this is to be the desire of
[1:11:49] every believer now in reality there's
[1:11:53] not one of us in here that can say I
[1:11:55] always do that which is pleasing listen
[1:12:00] to me now but from the soul when that
[1:12:04] soul has been changed and filled with
[1:12:10] God's presence you know what I'm talking
[1:12:14] about
[1:12:14] the Bible said whosoever is part of God
[1:12:18] that's not commit practice sin he is
[1:12:24] delivered there is there is nothing
[1:12:27] holding over his head why because the
[1:12:29] seed of God remaineth in him I always do
[1:12:34] that which is pleasing to my father oh
[1:12:38] my I come not to do my own will but but
[1:12:42] the father that sent me and he that sent
[1:12:45] me said Jesus he is with me and as the
[1:12:48] father has sent me so send I you the
[1:12:52] father that sent him came in here and
[1:12:56] worked through him he meant the same
[1:13:01] Jesus that sends you goes with you and
[1:13:04] is in you and if that spirit think of
[1:13:07] this if that spirit living in Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ made him do and act the way he
[1:13:13] did you have some general idea
[1:13:17] how it will do when it's in you because
[1:13:20] that life cannot change it'll go from
[1:13:23] body to body but it cannot change its
[1:13:26] nature for its God he meant notice Jesus
[1:13:33] says in verse 25 of the same chapter
[1:13:35] these things have I spoken unto you
[1:13:38] being yet present with you but the
[1:13:41] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:13:46] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:13:52] teach you all things and bring all
[1:13:55] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:13:57] have said unto you Jesus said my peace I
[1:14:04] leave with you my peace I give unto you
[1:14:07] not as the world giveth give I unto you
[1:14:10] let not your heart be troubled neither
[1:14:13] let it be afraid you have heard how I
[1:14:18] said unto you I go away and come again
[1:14:21] unto you if you love me look at this
[1:14:24] statement you would rejoice because I
[1:14:29] said I going to the Father for my father
[1:14:32] is greater than I now I think it's safe
[1:14:39] to say that the disciples they didn't
[1:14:42] have a clue of what was going on and
[1:14:44] what was getting ready to happen do you
[1:14:48] mean that they would be even regarded as
[1:14:51] true disciples even if they didn't
[1:14:53] understand everything discipleship is
[1:14:57] not based upon understanding it's based
[1:15:00] upon faith
[1:15:04] and faith will tell where our senses
[1:15:07] cannot be clearly there are things that
[1:15:12] you cannot explain I wish I could preach
[1:15:14] a little bit this morning on another
[1:15:16] subject but I'm not even want to go
[1:15:17] there but you recognize sometimes how
[1:15:19] God will deal with things and it's the
[1:15:21] very hidden wisdom of Almighty God how
[1:15:25] God could move in such a way and God
[1:15:28] would use men who are full of mistakes
[1:15:31] and failures and faults and God would
[1:15:33] say I'm gonna put their writing in the
[1:15:36] scripture because it wasn't them as men
[1:15:40] it was the Spirit of God but it takes
[1:15:44] the discernment of the Holy Ghost to
[1:15:46] recognize that hidden wisdom the rest of
[1:15:49] the world says they're men they made
[1:15:52] mistakes this one did this and this one
[1:15:54] did that and this one did that but the
[1:15:56] believer said but I see card
[1:15:59] I see God same in you and me
[1:16:06] I wish I could preach that this morning
[1:16:11] hallelu I go away and come again unto
[1:16:15] you glory be to God you know that was
[1:16:19] very much of how it was in the
[1:16:23] visitation of Abraham and Sarah in verse
[1:16:28] 8 in chapter 18 God come down and God
[1:16:33] used to form a flesh are you with me
[1:16:36] he used the form of flesh to his speak
[1:16:39] the promise to Abraham and Sarah and
[1:16:43] that word spoken was sent to dissolve
[1:16:47] the very doubts in Sarah's heart the
[1:16:51] promise was believed or the brand would
[1:16:52] say like this one place the promised
[1:16:54] those slightly doubted it was believed
[1:16:57] but you see the power like brother
[1:16:59] Timothy was preaching on Thursday the
[1:17:01] power of God's Word of God to bring his
[1:17:04] word to pass sovereign grace will
[1:17:07] override the doubt it will cast it out
[1:17:10] it will dismantle it brother it's not up
[1:17:12] to you and I to try to dismantle it the
[1:17:14] word has within it the necessary power
[1:17:18] to cast out all unbelief and he moved
[1:17:25] from Genesis 18 to Genesis 21 you see
[1:17:32] that must be the transition within every
[1:17:35] life in every age in the age we're
[1:17:38] living in not just rallying back here in
[1:17:42] Genesis 18 hope God use the messenger
[1:17:45] God use the messenger that's to miss it
[1:17:48] you must recognize God use that vessel
[1:17:52] it was a word to this generation that
[1:17:55] was needed in this out the promises of
[1:17:57] God that have been placed above this
[1:18:00] generation
[1:18:01] Jesus Christ has been pleased upon this
[1:18:05] generation sir the ministry in this in
[1:18:08] time but the Bible says the Lord visited
[1:18:13] Sara
[1:18:15] he was not a fleshly coming but it was
[1:18:18] the same Lord who spoke the promise and
[1:18:22] that same Lord visited and performed the
[1:18:26] word in Sara's life yeah man the word
[1:18:30] must become material you agree with me
[1:18:36] it's not good enough just to have it
[1:18:38] hear the word was made to become fresh I
[1:18:44] can't remember this or I can't quote
[1:18:47] that that's not what it's about
[1:18:49] he brings that to you as you have need
[1:18:52] of it the scripture is necessary for
[1:18:54] instruction in righteousness of how that
[1:18:57] we ought to give ourselves unto God but
[1:19:00] remember the Word made flesh his word
[1:19:03] Christ Himself comes in and takes over
[1:19:06] your thinking he takes over your me and
[1:19:09] he lives his own life through you I know
[1:19:17] we know some of these things but I'm
[1:19:18] here to stir up your pure mind by way of
[1:19:21] remembrance sometimes it's our little
[1:19:24] things that we forget we forget who's in
[1:19:27] the ship storms arise we forget who's in
[1:19:32] the ship wake him up
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:40] if you love me you and rejoice because I
[1:19:46] said I going to the Father for my father
[1:19:49] is greater than I stronger this is what
[1:19:56] the word stronger than I because
[1:20:00] remember it wasn't the body the body was
[1:20:03] necessary to pay the redemptive price
[1:20:06] but Jesus and the father there are not
[1:20:09] two separate people it is created a body
[1:20:14] of tabernacle that he might come and
[1:20:17] dwell in and pay the price of redemption
[1:20:20] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:20:24] unto himself
[1:20:28] Amen he told them in John 16 remember he
[1:20:32] kept saying a little while a little
[1:20:33] while a little while and you read in
[1:20:35] John 16 where they were troubled at the
[1:20:38] same and Jesus caught it that they were
[1:20:40] troubled with it
[1:20:41] a little while a little while what's he
[1:20:43] saying a little while and Jesus and let
[1:20:45] him know he takes the example that of a
[1:20:49] woman who is preparing to give birth as
[1:20:52] she comes into that place there's great
[1:20:55] sorrow there's great pain that comes in
[1:20:59] but Jesus let him know that he was in
[1:21:02] that you're gonna have mourning
[1:21:05] there's going to be sorrow but your
[1:21:07] sorrow is going to turn to joy you are
[1:21:11] going to rejoice again
[1:21:13] oh brother they couldn't think they
[1:21:15] didn't understand what he was saying
[1:21:17] listen to me not only did they not
[1:21:19] understand what he was saying but even
[1:21:21] when it took place they were all
[1:21:23] scattered they were walking around with
[1:21:26] gloom they were all down but remember he
[1:21:28] said you're gonna rejoice he knew that
[1:21:33] the present conditions not happening
[1:21:36] according how they thought
[1:21:37] should happen then he would bring blue
[1:21:40] sadness we thought it should have been
[1:21:42] him that woulda redeemed his rep but
[1:21:44] brother when he come on the scene after
[1:21:47] his resurrection brother and made
[1:21:49] himself known to them even those that
[1:21:52] said I don't know if I can believe it or
[1:21:54] not Jesus did not shy away from them
[1:21:57] they were elected to receive it the
[1:22:00] Bible says in the book of Acts they were
[1:22:02] witnesses chosen for him to make himself
[1:22:05] known to them and when he came to them
[1:22:09] it removed all doubt it didn't matter if
[1:22:12] they had to touch his hands come on now
[1:22:15] he broke fish and an open then the bread
[1:22:18] it opened their eyes is that right there
[1:22:23] was a rejoicing that he had raised but
[1:22:27] Jesus let him know hey listen up there's
[1:22:30] going to be a temporary rejoicing you
[1:22:33] remember I told you that I'm doing
[1:22:35] there's gonna be a joy that will come to
[1:22:38] you that no man will be able to take
[1:22:41] from you and that joy that he was
[1:22:46] talking about is the imparting of that
[1:22:48] life that through that birth that then
[1:22:51] the life would come the indwelling of
[1:22:54] the very jolly of Almighty God
[1:22:57] how many knows the Bible said the joy of
[1:22:58] the Lord is our strength even when you
[1:23:05] feel weak the joy of the Lord
[1:23:09] let the send the I don't feel happy acid
[1:23:11] joke
[1:23:15] the joy of what below not new stock
[1:23:22] points all of those things they're fine
[1:23:27] but nothing is real joy outside of the
[1:23:31] Lord people put themselves in debt
[1:23:34] looking for joy they'll go from things
[1:23:39] or things you think looking for joy
[1:23:41] there is no joke outside of Jesus Christ
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:47] amen
[1:23:48] I've come that your joy might be full oh
[1:23:54] my
[1:23:55] they were comforted by the word being
[1:23:58] made manifest to him
[1:23:59] think of how Noah think about this
[1:24:03] comforter here just for a moment think
[1:24:05] of how Noah felt when the word here it
[1:24:07] was spoken to him remember the Bible
[1:24:09] tells us in in the book of Genesis nor
[1:24:11] was already a righteous man come on
[1:24:15] friends he was already a righteous man
[1:24:18] no was already praying God saw in no and
[1:24:25] it wasn't because all his works but no
[1:24:28] he saw something within Noah and how did
[1:24:32] God what did he see he saw one of his
[1:24:34] own attributes and God comes and speaks
[1:24:40] to Noah build an ark
[1:24:46] it's gonna rain now he didn't tell him
[1:24:51] to build an ark to go you know just so
[1:24:53] you have a nice boat to go out on the
[1:24:54] water with it didn't make sense that he
[1:24:58] build it on dry land boy this stuff
[1:25:02] leaching over on her it didn't make
[1:25:05] sense to build it on dry land if you're
[1:25:08] gonna build a boat building where the
[1:25:10] water is at but God likes hiding from
[1:25:17] the wise and prudent he gave her a
[1:25:21] little something to criticize go ahead
[1:25:24] and put this on your blog post come on
[1:25:28] somebody but God said it's my hidden
[1:25:30] wisdom what about that but when the rain
[1:25:38] fell there were no it was this this is
[1:25:43] that which was spoken not received a
[1:25:49] comfort when they think of it all of the
[1:25:57] critics that came to him in that day
[1:26:00] Noah's the revelation he received from
[1:26:03] God put him into action ho glory be to
[1:26:09] God amen it seemed it did not even seem
[1:26:14] right for him to cut down the the tree
[1:26:18] that he used it would have seemed like
[1:26:22] he should have used up tree but God said
[1:26:27] I can't use any wood that's not willing
[1:26:29] to surrender
[1:26:32] you see God in a hidden oh my god hiding
[1:26:37] himself in simplicity God takes a wood
[1:26:42] the tree and he drains the life out of
[1:26:46] that tree and then he takes this of
[1:26:49] another tree and takes the light from
[1:26:51] that tree and seals the wood from these
[1:26:55] trees it is
[1:26:59] Jesus Christ the comforter the Holy
[1:27:02] Ghost being made manifest right there
[1:27:06] when all the opposition arose against
[1:27:09] Noah he was comforted because he had
[1:27:14] received the word of the Lord only one
[1:27:17] that he didn't have problems he was not
[1:27:20] that he did not have shortcomings he was
[1:27:22] not that he didn't make any mistakes as
[1:27:27] a matter of fact I think of how the
[1:27:30] brand was dramatized and in conflict
[1:27:32] between God and Satan
[1:27:33] he said they got into harken Noah said
[1:27:35] boys it's gonna rain tomorrow
[1:27:38] no rain came boys it's gonna rain
[1:27:41] tomorrow ho I know it's coming he's
[1:27:44] right he knows it's coming because God
[1:27:47] called him into the ark and got shut the
[1:27:49] door he's known this has been God all
[1:27:54] the time hey come on now you and I never
[1:27:57] thought we'd be hearing this time he's
[1:28:02] coming he's coming he's coming
[1:28:05] he didn't come that day didn't come that
[1:28:07] day no Brad said one of the boys think
[1:28:09] about this one of the boys looked around
[1:28:11] to know it looked to Daddy has it all
[1:28:13] been a mistake no said no sir son God
[1:28:20] spoke to me here's the ark were set man
[1:28:26] come on somebody it comfort him when the
[1:28:33] Hebrew children had to stand there and
[1:28:35] remember they prayed they prayed they
[1:28:38] fasted and they waited on God they did
[1:28:41] not receive a word from God they were
[1:28:46] going to be thrown in the fiery furnace
[1:28:48] because of their stand that they would
[1:28:50] not bow to that image of Daniel
[1:28:53] they said Daniels a prophet of God but
[1:28:56] he is never to substitute Jesus Christ
[1:28:58] and I will not worship a man God uses
[1:29:06] problems but they never meant to be
[1:29:08] worshiped you see what it is it's the
[1:29:12] exaltation of an image oh my when the
[1:29:16] reality is is that the image of Christ
[1:29:19] is to be displayed in our lives it
[1:29:28] wouldn't matter if you never walked the
[1:29:30] streets of Jeffersonville at all you
[1:29:32] don't have to do none of that
[1:29:34] to be accepted in the beloved
[1:29:38] come on somebody amen we are not
[1:29:42] fanatics we are believers we know who we
[1:29:47] have believed in as partners to the Lord
[1:29:50] Jesus Christ the true automa the true
[1:29:53] perpetuation it's generated by the lies
[1:29:57] on the inside of us amen we will be
[1:30:01] taken enrapturing grace by the Lord
[1:30:04] Jesus Christ thank God for every part is
[1:30:10] that right I just say this plain as I
[1:30:14] know how to play it
[1:30:15] say it you take this message away this
[1:30:19] message is not books and tapes it's the
[1:30:23] inspiration of Jesus Christ that is
[1:30:25] poured out in this hour you take it'll
[1:30:30] answer well I'll just stay with the
[1:30:32] Bible without the inspiration of the
[1:30:34] author coming upon the word we are left
[1:30:37] to our own presumptions but when the
[1:30:41] inspiration is poured out whether
[1:30:46] there's there's waters that have been
[1:30:48] polluted waters that they held within
[1:30:51] them death but notice Elijah said bring
[1:30:54] me a new cruise bring me a cruise that
[1:30:58] has never been used before a cruise that
[1:31:01] is separated from traditions and
[1:31:03] idolatry and creeds
[1:31:05] and the nominations a bring me a cruise
[1:31:08] and put so in there brother he took that
[1:31:11] cruise and he put that salt in the water
[1:31:13] he said the Lord
[1:31:15] kill these waters and water symbolize
[1:31:19] people
[1:31:26] it was a comfort when the word came like
[1:31:32] that the Hebrew children walked to the
[1:31:37] fiery furnace they didn't know brother
[1:31:39] joy what was going to take place
[1:31:41] billy-ray they didn't know they were
[1:31:43] going to be delivered as far as how it
[1:31:46] came out
[1:31:48] well I feel like preaching a little bit
[1:31:52] they prayed they fasted they brought it
[1:31:55] up at prayer meeting
[1:31:56] Tuesday night prayer meeting come on now
[1:31:58] they set the prayer request prayer
[1:32:00] request after prayer request but the joy
[1:32:02] Bibles at a place that as soon as their
[1:32:03] name was written all I know what they're
[1:32:05] going to pray for you don't matter how
[1:32:10] many times we pray for it we are praying
[1:32:12] not because repetition makes it better
[1:32:15] we are praying because you promised God
[1:32:18] and we're standing as believers and
[1:32:21] believer said that God's Word can't fail
[1:32:24] just jump it fail I'm gonna keep
[1:32:26] standing here and pray and knocking and
[1:32:29] believing and expecting
[1:32:33] they were comforted and they got there
[1:32:40] in the midst of that fly that fire they
[1:32:43] walked in the midst they're amazing
[1:32:47] those who threw him in were consumed
[1:32:53] paradox after paradox their hands were
[1:32:56] bound they go into the fire their hands
[1:33:00] are then freed the king looks over and
[1:33:07] said did you not cast three men in the
[1:33:09] fire he said I see a fourth one lock
[1:33:17] into the Son of God wrote the Bible said
[1:33:25] when they came out of there their
[1:33:26] clothes did not smell like smoke
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:32] that's a mystery brother Milton I like
[1:33:35] Cracker Barrell but a lot of times I go
[1:33:36] to cracker but I like the fireplace but
[1:33:38] it's a mystery how they came out of
[1:33:40] there
[1:33:40] without smelling like smoke you go to
[1:33:42] crack the barrel come out smelling like
[1:33:44] smoke come on now they came out of there
[1:33:49] unpainted brother don't you see the
[1:33:52] power of standing on his word that word
[1:33:55] is comfort in our life the enemy can try
[1:33:58] to bring all sides of fear and say this
[1:34:00] will happen this will happen but listen
[1:34:02] the God who has permitted the test he
[1:34:05] does not leave you to your own devices
[1:34:15] he makes himself known in a greater more
[1:34:19] personal way is there witness of that
[1:34:24] every time on and on we could go with
[1:34:32] how the word that was spoken the spirit
[1:34:35] of Christ would bring comfort to them
[1:34:38] down through the ages here was in the
[1:34:41] days of the disciples here the Word was
[1:34:44] made flesh that was a comforter they can
[1:34:48] handle it shake hands with it talk with
[1:34:51] it
[1:34:51] it was a comfort to him but remember he
[1:34:55] said I'm going away but I'm gonna send
[1:34:58] the comforter back to you hey man here
[1:35:01] he was the Word was made flesh among
[1:35:05] them in John 16:7
[1:35:07] it says nevertheless I tell you the
[1:35:10] truth it is expedient for you that I go
[1:35:15] away they didn't want him to go away
[1:35:20] they tried to prevent his departure even
[1:35:25] Jesus himself he left them and even in
[1:35:29] that he loved their fellowship but he
[1:35:32] knew in order to bring this life within
[1:35:36] them he would have to go away
[1:35:41] he prayed three times let this cup pass
[1:35:45] from me aren't you glad that he took a
[1:35:49] cup I'm glad I'm glad I'm really glad
[1:35:58] it's expedient for you that I go away
[1:36:01] for if I go not away the comforter will
[1:36:04] not come to you but if I depart I will
[1:36:07] send him unto you he knows your address
[1:36:14] he knows your address and when he is
[1:36:18] come he will reprove the world of sin of
[1:36:23] righteousness and of judgment of sin
[1:36:27] because they believe not on me
[1:36:30] of righteousness because I go to my
[1:36:33] father and you see me no more true
[1:36:35] righteousness is the person of Jesus
[1:36:38] Christ in you the Pharisees were
[1:36:43] righteous people but now through the
[1:36:47] offering of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:36:49] comes to reprove their righteousness
[1:36:53] because it is a self-made righteousness
[1:36:59] nothing wrong with them trying to live
[1:37:02] up to the world but remember true
[1:37:05] righteousness is that of the righteous
[1:37:08] one on the inside a judgment because the
[1:37:15] prince of this world is judged in that
[1:37:19] wonderful because he has been judged
[1:37:21] then judgment can be measured in met at
[1:37:25] the house of God if the enemy has a life
[1:37:29] bound judgment can come and lift what's
[1:37:33] on that life lift the condemnation
[1:37:35] judgment can be addressed at the house
[1:37:38] of God it can be lifted off the believer
[1:37:42] and put back up on the devil this is
[1:37:47] what the comforter comes to do the
[1:37:52] comforter ain't some big squishy
[1:37:53] marshmallow I have to say that because
[1:37:57] our English language you know has softy
[1:38:01] Betty what the comforter is it's the
[1:38:05] person of Jesus Christ and the very
[1:38:09] presence of the Holy Ghost here instead
[1:38:13] of instead of the corporal body being
[1:38:15] here it proves that Jesus was righteous
[1:38:17] and he went to the Father he is as the
[1:38:20] Bible says the faithful and true witness
[1:38:22] in the midst of the church so this
[1:38:26] comforter will try to get to just a
[1:38:29] little place here there's no way we can
[1:38:33] get to it all but to a little place the
[1:38:35] comforter is here in the greek it's
[1:38:38] called the Parakletos which is also
[1:38:40] known as the advocate one's advocate
[1:38:44] that's mentioned in first John chapter 2
[1:38:47] verse 1 and verse 2 it is summoned this
[1:38:51] comforter is one who is summoned to one
[1:38:53] side called to one's aid it pleads
[1:38:56] another's calls on behalf of their
[1:39:00] defense you and I could not plead our
[1:39:03] case guilty I said we were guilty
[1:39:12] hallelujah but there's an intercessor
[1:39:15] one who now exalted to the right hand of
[1:39:18] God he's there to plead for the
[1:39:21] pardoning of our sins and I want to
[1:39:22] understand plead it's not him begging
[1:39:24] please please no there has been a
[1:39:27] transaction that has made to receive
[1:39:33] that men the Holy Ghost is is that of
[1:39:37] which the Lord Jesus has prayed I will
[1:39:40] pray my father that he will send the
[1:39:43] comforter whether he went praying for
[1:39:46] something that wasn't the will of God or
[1:39:48] percent thing that was brand-new
[1:39:50] remember
[1:39:51] this prayer is only the utterance of a
[1:39:54] very mind of God and heart of God we
[1:39:57] were already in God's mind before there
[1:40:02] ever was a devil it was already saddled
[1:40:06] Bilal was slain in the mind of God and
[1:40:11] when that reality strikes our heart
[1:40:13] brother our security and our safety is
[1:40:16] in the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:40:20] comforter makes that finished work alive
[1:40:23] and real that you were always a part of
[1:40:27] me the comforter comes to make it real
[1:40:34] to us it's the love of God that were
[1:40:41] unable to be separated he's one that is
[1:40:46] summoned to the side of another to speak
[1:40:51] on our behalf
[1:40:54] where we are looking at we know we're
[1:40:58] guilty I want you to think of this now
[1:41:03] listen to me if I could just is it just
[1:41:05] coming to me now if I can somehow very
[1:41:07] very late this here we stand and we
[1:41:10] recognize when the preaching of the
[1:41:12] Cross the preaching of the gospel it
[1:41:15] brings conviction the Holy Ghost brings
[1:41:18] conviction to the sinner it brings
[1:41:21] conviction to our heart to draw us and
[1:41:24] bring us to the place to recognize there
[1:41:27] has been a propitiation that has already
[1:41:30] gone before us the Holy Ghost is the one
[1:41:33] that brings convictions they go what
[1:41:35] Peter preached on the day of Pentecost
[1:41:36] after Peter preached the death burial
[1:41:39] and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:41] Christ that this is the fulfillment of
[1:41:43] the prophecy and that which you're
[1:41:45] seeing and hearing is the life of God
[1:41:48] that is being made manifest what did
[1:41:51] they do the Bible said their hearts were
[1:41:53] pricked and they said what shall we do
[1:41:56] to be saved you see the preaching there
[1:41:58] of the atonement it was making known to
[1:42:01] them the way that had been opened they
[1:42:06] already knew it but now he wasn't just
[1:42:08] reading about it but now here comes a
[1:42:11] man that is a witness of the true
[1:42:14] atonement rather he had some he read
[1:42:17] about it's what he has experienced they
[1:42:21] met he was one who was guilty as guilty
[1:42:25] could be here was a Peter think other
[1:42:27] think of this think of the irony of
[1:42:30] Almighty God that God would choose a man
[1:42:33] to be the spokesman his one who denied
[1:42:36] him when they asked him hey you talk
[1:42:39] like a Galilean hey do don't you know
[1:42:42] him and the Bible said he cursed he fled
[1:42:47] away but it's the very one that God
[1:42:49] chose to be a spokesman but brother
[1:42:53] something happened on the day of
[1:42:56] Pentecost they were already called the
[1:43:01] Bible says in John 15
[1:43:04] they had been sanctified by the truth
[1:43:07] come on when they went up there to wait
[1:43:09] on the Holy Ghost they were already
[1:43:11] sanctified clean vessels but they needed
[1:43:16] to be put in service and they were
[1:43:19] already claiming now when the Holy Ghost
[1:43:22] descend
[1:43:23] Briella Peter did not walk out of there
[1:43:26] with a monkey on his back but he's still
[1:43:28] guilty he knew he had been cleared
[1:43:33] because the Holy Ghost is the comforter
[1:43:36] that announces to you the sin question
[1:43:40] you said how does it do that because the
[1:43:45] old man the old nature on the inside God
[1:43:50] Himself comes down and annihilates that
[1:43:53] old nature and that seed on the inside
[1:43:56] he raises up by his quickening power and
[1:44:00] he seals it that's why the Bible said
[1:44:03] you are a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:44:10] I'm telling you there is power to lift
[1:44:15] condemnation over your life
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:28] Oh God when you have been gone again the
[1:44:35] change
[1:44:36] this guy looks the same I mean the
[1:44:40] matter you know the guy mentor who ever
[1:44:42] was I mean I had to they wiped off
[1:44:44] everything got there got themselves in
[1:44:45] order according to God's Word but the
[1:44:47] inside man is the man who's changed
[1:44:49] everybody else can look and say oh
[1:44:51] that's Samuel but see the inside man has
[1:44:54] been changed the Bible tells us in the
[1:44:58] book of Hebrews chapter 10 the
[1:45:00] conscience that conscious that soul that
[1:45:02] has been purged there's no more desire
[1:45:05] for sin amen the inside man that's why
[1:45:11] we said me you know a weeks ago I
[1:45:12] remember when it was but there can be no
[1:45:14] that'll come to your address and you
[1:45:18] look at it and say
[1:45:20] wrong guy RTS return to see wrong guy
[1:45:28] that guy don't live here no more they
[1:45:34] met when he has come when the comforter
[1:45:38] has come he will do the same things
[1:45:42] Jesus said that I had done while the
[1:45:45] comforter is in me we read that in our
[1:45:48] opening text is that right it's him that
[1:45:51] doeth the works the father that dwelleth
[1:45:53] in me its life within us there is not a
[1:45:56] tree that can bear the fruit without the
[1:45:59] life being within it is that right he
[1:46:03] goes on to say if you can't believe me
[1:46:05] believe me for the very works sake it
[1:46:10] was according to the Word of God
[1:46:13] the Spirit of Truth is the comforter and
[1:46:16] he says to us in that end where we read
[1:46:18] the works that I do shall he do also and
[1:46:22] greater works than these remember Jesus
[1:46:26] would say in John 5:19 that the son can
[1:46:28] do nothing of himself but what he seeth
[1:46:30] the father do whatsoever things he doeth
[1:46:33] these also doeth the son likewise see
[1:46:37] the realization these things that we
[1:46:40] have heard and know it becomes more real
[1:46:46] that it must be him when the Spirit of
[1:46:51] God instructed the prophets pick up your
[1:46:53] pen and write and he wrote of this verse
[1:46:56] of scripture because it's time now where
[1:47:01] the bride it has come to the completion
[1:47:05] we're not we're not in the I age it's
[1:47:08] moving out to the very intelligence has
[1:47:10] stepped into the body it is where God
[1:47:13] has taken over his body and for
[1:47:18] redemption
[1:47:19] are you with me if truly he's taking
[1:47:21] over his body his temple it has been
[1:47:24] growing growing throughout the ages as a
[1:47:26] holy habitation for God but now it is
[1:47:30] God how God is dwelling
[1:47:32] than us as he dwelt in every age and it
[1:47:35] was him that performed the word in every
[1:47:38] age through surrender vessels are you
[1:47:43] with me now it's the same God that is
[1:47:46] working inside of you and I it must be
[1:47:49] him performing the word in us there's
[1:47:53] nothing wrong we ought to have a longing
[1:47:56] and a desire to see more of God in our
[1:48:00] midst we ought to have a desire to see
[1:48:03] more of him in our lives
[1:48:05] Bertrand tells us in perfect faith he
[1:48:07] said oh we are longing for those
[1:48:09] apostolic times once again he also
[1:48:13] warned us further after all it will not
[1:48:16] be a big public show there's some things
[1:48:20] that we cannot explain and never will be
[1:48:23] able to explain of why this one is
[1:48:26] healed and this one's not
[1:48:29] but in irregardless we stand in the in
[1:48:34] the faith in the truth helmet to know
[1:48:36] that God is already healed us
[1:48:42] are you with me it must be the
[1:48:51] realization it is the father himself
[1:48:54] reveal see he must reveal himself then
[1:49:01] it's us believing us yielding that
[1:49:05] believing part is part of the yielding
[1:49:07] then it is the Spirit of Christ working
[1:49:10] in us and through us to perform his word
[1:49:15] my my mind let me just let me let me go
[1:49:19] on here he will bear witness notice in
[1:49:23] John 15 I'm trying to get here now John
[1:49:27] 15:26 Jesus picks it up again when the
[1:49:30] comforter has come whom I will send unto
[1:49:33] you from the father even the Spirit of
[1:49:37] Truth which proceedeth from the father
[1:49:40] he shall testify of me and ye also shall
[1:49:50] bear witness because we have been with
[1:49:52] me from the beginning the lie of Jesus
[1:49:56] Christ in the believer it is our comfort
[1:50:00] that there is one that has stood in our
[1:50:05] place is standing in our place and is in
[1:50:08] us with him being in us and us in him he
[1:50:16] is our advocate before the throne we do
[1:50:20] not stand then as guilty we stand as
[1:50:25] completely free we stand with his life
[1:50:29] in us we stand with the righteousness of
[1:50:33] God in our lives you with Minnelli
[1:50:39] but Sandow still make mistakes and then
[1:50:42] I'm not talking about you you understand
[1:50:44] when I talk about mistakes I'm not
[1:50:45] talking about willful sin and and an
[1:50:47] excuses for four four habits and
[1:50:50] everything that's not what I'm talking
[1:50:51] about at all
[1:50:52] you understand that so he gives us
[1:50:54] notice one of the points here and I'll
[1:50:57] just close on this coming down through
[1:50:58] here one of the points with the
[1:51:00] comforter it gives to us not only life
[1:51:04] but it gives to us power is that right
[1:51:08] it gives us life and power it the Holy
[1:51:15] Ghost does not come and give us and give
[1:51:18] us life and then we've got to go wait
[1:51:20] for power no the word has been restored
[1:51:23] to let us know that life and power come
[1:51:26] at the same time are you with me it
[1:51:32] gives us divine strength on the inside
[1:51:34] so it's not our power remember the
[1:51:36] father dwelleth in me he doeth the works
[1:51:38] Jesus when he was assembled with him in
[1:51:41] Acts chapter one verse four he told them
[1:51:43] you shall not depart from Jerusalem but
[1:51:45] wait for the promise of the Father which
[1:51:47] saith he ye have heard of me for John
[1:51:50] truly baptized with water but ye shall
[1:51:52] be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[1:51:55] days hence but you shall receive power
[1:52:01] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:52:05] you that's a lot of contrary to how
[1:52:09] things have been talked in minutes in
[1:52:13] many churches around even you win when
[1:52:18] we look how the Prophet is on the scene
[1:52:20] where you already found the mixture of
[1:52:23] spirits coming in and they were teaching
[1:52:27] experience as evidence instead of it
[1:52:30] being based on the word are you with me
[1:52:33] and that is why the arguments could
[1:52:35] arise a person could have an experience
[1:52:38] but yet the life not match the word they
[1:52:41] can have an experience with in church
[1:52:43] and yet no power to live a godly life
[1:52:47] come on friends we're talking about its
[1:52:51] disses the hour where the prophecy of
[1:52:53] the word for the building up of
[1:52:56] Jerusalem a habitation remember he told
[1:53:00] to ruble get the plumb line out stop
[1:53:03] measuring up Jerusalem amen let's get it
[1:53:06] back to its original standard they don't
[1:53:11] want to lessen it what good is a Holy
[1:53:15] Ghost that comes down upon your friends
[1:53:17] but don't give you no power to live
[1:53:19] outside die understand their listen to
[1:53:23] me now thank God for the Holy Ghost
[1:53:25] dealing with hearts but I want you to
[1:53:28] understand when it deals with your heart
[1:53:29] he deals with your life that's him
[1:53:32] making himself known that I am a Living
[1:53:35] God and when you know your life needs to
[1:53:39] be changed open up the door of the one
[1:53:42] who's present doing the knocking don't
[1:53:47] just walk out and say oh praise God that
[1:53:50] was a wonderful service thanks Carl
[1:53:52] listen friends we thank God for all of
[1:53:54] that but that's got to come a power only
[1:53:56] inside a power that lives above sin
[1:54:02] that's what the comforter does the
[1:54:05] comforter the Spirit of Truth that
[1:54:07] causes you to stand on God's Word live
[1:54:10] guys
[1:54:11] sink or swim we don't gotta take back
[1:54:17] from nothing are you with me when I have
[1:54:21] to stand back from nothing we don't need
[1:54:25] we don't have a bunch of wishy-washy
[1:54:27] people stand down stand down let the
[1:54:29] devil take this course not since they
[1:54:33] men the Holy Ghost is here commend the
[1:54:36] abstract to the title deed the
[1:54:38] quickening power of caught has come to
[1:54:41] the Church of the Living God there is no
[1:54:43] excuse to live in sin you shall receive
[1:54:50] power this is for you
[1:54:55] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[1:54:57] you and you shall be witnesses unto me
[1:55:03] you know the Bible says and no man can
[1:55:06] call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Ghost
[1:55:12] he's the lord of that temple where you
[1:55:14] can say I once was but no longer it's a
[1:55:21] comfort on the inside no longer am I the
[1:55:24] same you are his victory is being
[1:55:29] declared through the life oh my look at
[1:55:33] this word power here for a moment
[1:55:34] 2nd Corinthians 13:4 for though he was
[1:55:36] crucified through weakness yet he liveth
[1:55:39] by the power of God for we also are weak
[1:55:42] in him but we shall live with power by
[1:55:46] that we shall live with him by the power
[1:55:49] of God toward you how how you living by
[1:55:54] the power of God Paul how are you doing
[1:55:58] what you're doing by the power of God
[1:56:00] that dwelleth in me see that tower
[1:56:04] it's a liberating power it doesn't
[1:56:07] connect you to your past it ties you
[1:56:10] back into your destiny hey man it is the
[1:56:16] link that connects you amen
[1:56:20] Romans 1-3 concerning his son Jesus
[1:56:22] Christ our Lord which was made of the
[1:56:24] seed of David according to the flesh and
[1:56:26] declared to be the Son of God with power
[1:56:29] according all of that according to the
[1:56:35] spirit of holiness by the resurrection
[1:56:38] from the dead
[1:56:39] that's real holiness real holiness on
[1:56:42] the inside will generate holiness on the
[1:56:43] outside hey man this is the spirit of
[1:56:47] holiness raised him from the grave it
[1:56:49] set him apart there have been others
[1:56:51] that died and they're still in the grave
[1:56:54] come on Rob others that have lived and
[1:56:58] they're in the great but there is one
[1:57:00] who rose from the
[1:57:03] they put him in the grave remember he
[1:57:06] Rosa and he tramped over how did he rise
[1:57:10] up that body old girl repeated God that
[1:57:13] body was laying there lifeless
[1:57:17] motionless but brother there's a promise
[1:57:21] are you listening to me there was a
[1:57:23] promise in the world that destroy this
[1:57:26] temple and in three days I'll raise it
[1:57:29] up again he stood on that water the
[1:57:39] amount of seven you know some
[1:57:40] backgrounds about David now don't you
[1:57:42] have you read some things we wrote about
[1:57:44] David not or no you know the whole thing
[1:57:46] might be a little shady Jesus knew I was
[1:57:49] the one who inspired David come on
[1:57:53] somebody i inspired David to say what he
[1:57:57] said and when the Spirit of God come
[1:58:01] upon the Apostles they look back and
[1:58:04] called David a prophet don't scratch
[1:58:09] your head just say thank you Lord I
[1:58:10] believe it cause you're never gonna
[1:58:13] figure it out
[1:58:14] hey man it's God hiding himself hey man
[1:58:20] think about this here he is laying
[1:58:22] lifeless and hopeless but the Spirit of
[1:58:25] God comes upon him and raises that body
[1:58:28] up brother that's the same way that it
[1:58:31] has come to you and I it is it is the
[1:58:34] Spirit of God that comes to raise you
[1:58:37] and I it gives you power brother to live
[1:58:40] and look to him as your justification
[1:58:43] but I have justified on the Lord by
[1:58:46] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:58:49] gives you more power to live a
[1:58:51] sanctified clean line and he then puts
[1:58:54] his power on the inside of you
[1:58:58] more power it's Jesus living in a
[1:59:05] factory worker
[1:59:06] it's Jesus living in the businessman
[1:59:08] it's Jesus living in the biskits maker
[1:59:10] come on somebody
[1:59:12] hey man it's Jesus living his life
[1:59:15] through his church then I'll not be hard
[1:59:20] if you just surrender come on you look
[1:59:25] at the fashions and everything else and
[1:59:27] you look at a fashion magazine or
[1:59:28] whatever more you surrender you open
[1:59:30] your spirit to it your eyes is that I
[1:59:35] gave you let an image come in and then
[1:59:39] you go to searching for what kind of
[1:59:41] shoes they got in this and and that and
[1:59:43] this and that what is it it's an image
[1:59:45] that's coming in that takes over that
[1:59:48] you'll sacrifice all sorts of things to
[1:59:51] be done in order to get a certain look
[1:59:54] what is it it's an image that you're
[1:59:56] trying to become stop trying you get
[2:00:03] yourself in debt and not only that you
[2:00:06] don't want to match the spirit of this
[2:00:08] world that is a trap in this world to
[2:00:13] get people to where they're always
[2:00:14] looking there remember it's a false
[2:00:17] representation because it's God's desire
[2:00:20] to form his own image and his life
[2:00:23] inside of you now you are not made to
[2:00:25] look at that and take that image on you
[2:00:28] were made to reproduce the very image of
[2:00:31] Jesus Christ that's why you need to look
[2:00:35] away then when you get to looking at him
[2:00:41] you start letting the righteousness of
[2:00:45] God move into your life if the spirit
[2:00:52] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[2:00:53] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[2:00:55] ditch also quicken your mortal bodies by
[2:00:57] his Spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:01:01] I really am closing right now but it is
[2:01:09] a reality this is what the comfort is
[2:01:13] you seeing that in the midst of
[2:01:16] circumstances that could come about
[2:01:19] those who live before the Old Testament
[2:01:23] those here in the New Testament after
[2:01:26] the coming of the Holy Ghost they were
[2:01:30] not exempt from tests and trials as a
[2:01:33] matter of fact Jesus let him know in
[2:01:35] John 16 I believe 32 or 33 one of those
[2:01:37] scriptures there he let them know that
[2:01:40] in this world you're going to have much
[2:01:42] tribulation but in me you have peace
[2:01:49] every time you make a even you stand for
[2:01:52] God's word Satan is always there to
[2:01:55] assail you but don't fear the same God
[2:02:00] who has made his word known to your life
[2:02:04] and to your heart and it's called you to
[2:02:06] it and you surrendering to that the same
[2:02:08] God is present to back up that word and
[2:02:10] to give you the comfort that you need we
[2:02:15] are comforted by walking in his word you
[2:02:20] know how many times we've seen examples
[2:02:22] now I think I guess it was all along but
[2:02:26] you see it more now and I know the
[2:02:29] insanity is just incredible in this
[2:02:31] world that we're living in now but how
[2:02:33] many times you see people where they're
[2:02:35] been children and here they are now 13
[2:02:37] 15 years old some 17 they've been locked
[2:02:41] in a cellar all their life you're not
[2:02:46] told about this it's not like a once
[2:02:47] there is that news story no it's where
[2:02:49] new where are that news stories they're
[2:02:52] not just somewhere out in in California
[2:02:54] these types of things happen right
[2:02:55] around in here how many times I don't
[2:02:59] know maybe it's just because the you
[2:03:00] know it's more reported or more widely
[2:03:02] broadcast I don't know but one thing
[2:03:04] that I look at is you find many times
[2:03:06] that those individuals come out they
[2:03:08] don't know how to walk they don't know
[2:03:10] how to talk there's certain things and
[2:03:13] you seem so malnourished it wouldn't
[2:03:16] matter if they put their push their
[2:03:17] meals under the door part of nourishment
[2:03:20] and growth is that direct communication
[2:03:25] part of nourishment and growth is being
[2:03:28] in the light you know how it is we're
[2:03:32] coming up here in Northeast Ohio we're
[2:03:34] coming up into a time where even where
[2:03:37] the darkness and as it keeps on getting
[2:03:39] darker pretty soon you're be pouring
[2:03:41] your milk
[2:03:43] on your cereal and it'll be dark then
[2:03:46] you'll be sitting down with your bologna
[2:03:48] sandwich at dinner and it's dark right
[2:03:51] not at one of they tell us in those
[2:03:53] times get out a little bit in the
[2:03:55] sunlight and get at least a little bit
[2:03:57] of light and I think what they say take
[2:03:59] vitamin D or something I don't know you
[2:04:01] know is that right vitamin D they tell
[2:04:03] us that why because we need sunlight we
[2:04:08] need light and sunlight itself I never
[2:04:10] forget when when when Benjamin when Ben
[2:04:13] was born there was a condition in his
[2:04:17] body that was not fully developed and
[2:04:20] then he had that little bit of a yellow
[2:04:22] jaundice it was that and there was
[2:04:25] another little condition that was within
[2:04:26] there you went to the doctor for the joy
[2:04:29] you know what the doctor told us and
[2:04:30] said you got to you have something you
[2:04:32] can lay him in we said well we got a
[2:04:33] bassinet you know that you know that you
[2:04:37] have plenty of windows we said yeah and
[2:04:38] so we had there in the trailer we had
[2:04:40] that with that little pop-out place on
[2:04:41] the trailer there we pulled back the
[2:04:43] windows we would lay him in the bassinet
[2:04:45] we would open the windows pulled up the
[2:04:48] shades where it was just complete
[2:04:50] sunlight coming in there they said you
[2:04:52] laid in the sunlight and that itself
[2:04:55] will the satellite will take care of it
[2:04:59] it was something inside of his body that
[2:05:03] had not been completely formed plus he
[2:05:05] was also dealing with the jaundice
[2:05:08] brother the light had the killer
[2:05:12] and if God poses testimonies like that I
[2:05:16] believe with all my heart under the
[2:05:18] sunlight of God's presence of Jesus thou
[2:05:48] the stream of all my comfort you are

[2:12:29] you think of it like this we didn't get

[2:12:34] for that word comforter is one as an
[2:12:36] advocate it's the same it's the same
[2:12:39] process same word that is used there but
[2:12:43] you know one of the meanings of that of
[2:12:44] an advocate is there's one who is
[2:12:48] standing there not only to deliver all
[2:12:50] of the promises to us and to bring us
[2:12:54] into them but it's also the very one
[2:12:57] that when we stagger into something
[2:13:00] ignorantly he's there to make
[2:13:02] intercession for us when we stagger into
[2:13:06] a trap that's been said there's one who
[2:13:10] can stand for us Jesus Christ the
[2:13:13] righteous brother he's not just standing
[2:13:16] somewhere way out there but remember
[2:13:18] that same life inside of you and I is

[2:13:24] body of flesh that body of flesh is
[2:13:27] seated on the throne and that same life
[2:13:30] has come back down on the inside and
[2:13:32] that same life dealing or living on the
[2:13:35] inside the worshiper once purged has
[2:13:38] some no more desire for sin the desire
[2:13:42] is to please him and him fully we have
[2:13:46] an advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[2:13:50] the righteous I'll tell you right now
[2:13:53] this morning we have an advocate you
[2:13:56] have one who's already stepped on your
[2:13:59] side you have one who already before

[2:14:17] get worthy enough save your time you say
