[32:42] where in our lives it's it's lived out
[32:46] through our lives you take for example

[32:56] it's a wonderful wonderful reality that
[33:00] God has brought to our hearts it's
[33:03] wonderful to revisit amen those grounds
[33:07] it meant sacred sands of God's grace to

[33:24] grace and it's that same grace not a
[33:29] different grace that same grace that is
[33:33] more precious and more precious and more

[35:17] sharp rock on the one side and a sharp
[35:21] rock on the other side and the name of
[35:24] the one was Moses and the name of the
[35:27] other seen the forefront of the one was
[35:31] situate northward over against mcNeish
[35:34] and the other southward over against
[35:36] Gibeon Jonathan said to the young man
[35:40] that bear his armor come and let us go
[35:45] over unto the garrison of these
[35:47] uncircumcised it may be that the Lord
[35:51] will work for us for there is no
[35:54] restraint to the law to save by many or
[35:59] by few and his armor-bearer said unto
[36:03] him do all that is in thine heart turned

[38:17] Johnathan behold we will pass over unto

[38:51] garrison of the Philistines and the
[38:53] Philistine said behold the Hebrews come
[38:57] forth out of the holes where they had
[39:00] hid themselves and the men of the
[39:02] garrison answered Jonathan and his
[39:04] armor-bearer
[39:05] and said come up to us and we will show
[39:08] you a thing and Jonathan said unto his
[39:11] armor-bearer
[39:12] come up after me for the Lord hath
[39:16] delivered them into the hand of Israel
[39:21] Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and
[39:25] upon his feet and his armor-bearer
[39:28] after him and they fell before Jonathan
[39:31] and his armor-bearer slew after him and
[39:34] that first slaughter which Jonathan and
[39:37] his armor-bearer made was about twenty
[39:39] men within as it were in half acre of
[39:42] land which a yoke of oxen might plow and
[39:47] there was trembling in the host in the
[39:50] field and among all the people the
[39:52] garrison and the spoilers they also
[39:55] trembled and the earth quaked so it was
[39:58] a very great trembling
[40:02] I want to just just speak tonight here
[40:05] just just pressing from verse just
[40:09] really drawing from verse six and verse
[40:11] 7 I was actually drawn to some other
[40:15] things and this dis is what just it just
[40:17] stood out to my heart in verse 6 and
[40:20] verse 7 and I'd like to just if we could
[40:23] just to speak on tonight
[40:26] there's no restraint with the Lord and
[40:30] if we could a subtitle in there onward
[40:33] Christian soldiers and when we look here
[40:40] at verse 6 and 7 just to draw our
[40:43] attention here here is Jonathan here
[40:48] with his armor-bearer they are away from
[40:51] the camp Saul and them do not know that
[40:54] they're away but remember Jonathan and
[40:57] his armor-bearer are mindful that the
[41:00] Philistines are the enemy and one thing
[41:05] that you see in verse 6 is that the the
[41:09] children of God the believer when we are
[41:13] walking in tune with God then we're not
[41:17] seeing things just to our own eyesight
[41:20] but we're looking at how that the enemy
[41:25] is expose before us you think about when
[41:28] when God used David and David looks upon
[41:32] Goliath David that the thing that David
[41:35] is drawn to is not his size neither what
[41:39] it is that Goliath is wearing but he's
[41:42] drawn to the fact that this is an
[41:45] uncircumcised Philistine he has no
[41:49] backing there is no covenant he is
[41:53] vulnerable and so David is not looking
[41:57] at all of the armor he's looking at he's
[41:59] vulnerable and this is where Jonathan
[42:02] and his armor bearer as Jonathan said
[42:05] let us go over in verse 6 unto the
[42:08] garrison
[42:09] the garrison there would be many as it
[42:12] said there were twenty it was like you
[42:14] a place that the where they're gathered
[42:16] together there in a stronghold that's
[42:18] another term for garrison of these
[42:21] uncircumcised it may be that the Lord
[42:24] will work for us for there is no
[42:27] restraint
[42:28] there's no hindrance to the Lord to save
[42:31] by many or by few and I really enjoy
[42:35] where is what his armor-bearer says in
[42:38] this time do all that is in thine heart
[42:42] the armor bearer recognizes this is in
[42:46] Jonathan's heart Jonathan is speaking
[42:49] according to the word of the Lord and so
[42:52] the armor bearer says do all that's in
[42:54] your heart behold I am with thee
[42:57] according to thy heart so there's a
[43:02] pound where if we look at this very
[43:05] clearly you find so much that was spoken
[43:08] here with Jonathan recognizing the
[43:10] conditions that are around them there's
[43:12] a power I've said tonight
[43:14] there's a power in confession it is it
[43:19] is always for every person when God gets
[43:22] ahold of a person's life they've turned
[43:25] their heart over to the Lord right then
[43:28] and there it ought to be that they make
[43:31] a declaration and let it be known I have
[43:34] been saved and when you make that big
[43:39] you are you are confessing what God has
[43:43] done in your life and every one of us
[43:46] remember that moment when we surrendered
[43:50] a heart and It was as though the load it
[43:53] was a load that was lifted but below
[43:56] that we felt lifted is the load of sin
[43:59] that our Savior already born and we are
[44:05] identifying with him our heart is
[44:08] uniting with his heart that he is my sin
[44:13] bearer he is my Savior and we are making
[44:17] a confession based on what he has done
[44:21] and who he is in our life and you
[44:25] that the Bible tells us in Revelations
[44:28] 12 that they overcame they overcame
[44:31] Satan by the the blood of the Lamb and
[44:35] the word of their testimony you know
[44:41] even when God as God takes ahold of the
[44:44] life and that life might have all kinds
[44:47] of habits 5 I was lost but now I've been
[44:51] found and you find that as you begin to
[44:55] speak according to the heart of God
[44:57] remember the heart of God is Christ
[45:01] being revealed and as you speak
[45:04] according to what the word is saying and
[45:07] made known in your life then it is God
[45:11] coming to back of the word that you are
[45:14] expressing because you are not speaking
[45:17] your own thoughts I am saved he meant
[45:26] been doing God moves you know a greater
[45:29] work as we heard here on Sunday then you
[45:31] keep confessing what he has done and if
[45:37] you look in your life and you can say
[45:39] well I see this I see that but confess
[45:41] who he is he has made in 1st Corinthians
[45:45] 1:30 he hath made him to be our
[45:47] perfection our sanctification our wisdom
[45:52] our righteousness you see he is the high
[45:56] priest of our confession and this is if
[46:02] there's a power in confession you know
[46:04] this is why brother Graham would say you
[46:06] take for example a person that could go
[46:09] out and say I'm no longer safe he said
[46:12] you watch that life go right down but
[46:15] when a person will testify God has saved
[46:19] me and you watch that workers
[46:22] righteousness because let me tell you
[46:27] something God backs up his works
[46:33] it's a power of confession you know it's
[46:37] like this listen now Jonathan is not
[46:40] just out here grabbing loose straws you
[46:43] see what Jonathan what's coming back to
[46:47] his mind is in Jonathan knows that if
[46:51] God ever moved before that same God will
[46:55] move again when the same conditions
[46:59] present themselves when faith is present
[47:03] God will act the same way
[47:06] that's what Jonathan is standing upon
[47:09] you see he's got a word you know faith
[47:12] rest in the Word of God faith doesn't
[47:16] rest in our feelings it rests in the
[47:20] word of God that's why we don't go by
[47:25] our feelings whether we're saved or not
[47:27] we we go by the Word of God of what God
[47:31] has said if I confess my sins he is
[47:35] faithful and just to forgive me and
[47:38] cleanse me from all unrighteousness to
[47:41] meet the conditions to be baptized in
[47:43] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[47:45] you might say I don't feel but it's not
[47:48] what we feel it's what the word has said
[47:56] he men Jonathan could rest in the word
[48:01] of the Lord I want to just hear it just
[48:03] pull this in John just over 23 Joshua
[48:06] telling the children of Israel here he's
[48:09] giving them counsel before his departure
[48:11] and I remember this is the promised land
[48:14] of the believer what we read in our text
[48:16] is where Jonathan and his armor-bearer
[48:19] the children of Israel are dwelling in
[48:21] the promised land and here is a promise
[48:25] that job Jonathan will no doubt going
[48:28] back upon his heart that you see here he
[48:31] says in verse 8 cleave unto the Lord
[48:33] your God as ye have done unto this day
[48:35] for the LORD hath driven out from before
[48:39] you great nations and strong now
[48:42] remember Israel was
[48:44] not that of a mighty nation within
[48:46] themselves the armies of the land the
[48:50] other nations that were in the land were
[48:52] as far as army they were superior but
[48:57] what made the difference was God was on
[49:01] their side and you you just you lookin
[49:06] in your life in my life as a believer
[49:09] though all hail has held me yet I shall
[49:13] not be moved
[49:15] Israel a little itty-bitty country in
[49:18] the world and when you pull up just pull
[49:21] up some time on the Six Day War and look
[49:24] at all the flags of all the other
[49:26] countries that were against one little
[49:30] flag and not one of them could overthrow
[49:35] why because it is God's chosen you say
[49:42] what are you saying well I might be kind
[49:44] of getting ahead of myself but size has
[49:47] nothing to do with it
[49:52] you might feel very small in stature in
[49:56] your life tonight and say I can't quote
[49:59] this I don't know this chapter I don't
[50:01] know this scripture but if you can just
[50:04] say Lord have your way in my lives then
[50:10] the author of the book can move and
[50:13] brother he can fulfill words that are
[50:16] wrote in here in your life and then
[50:19] direct you back to it and you say that
[50:22] was fulfilled in my life sometimes the
[50:26] more we know here the less we yield here
[50:30] the more we know here the more the enemy
[50:33] our can try to use that against us but
[50:35] it's not that we don't read we ought to
[50:37] give ourselves to the Word of God but
[50:39] it's to realize that God Himself is not
[50:43] working by numbers so let me just finish
[50:47] this but has for you no man has been
[50:51] able to stand before you unto this day
[50:54] one man
[50:56] of you shall chase a thousand and no
[51:01] right now you look at and say dear Lord
[51:03] one against a thousand but you gotta
[51:06] remember who's back in the one that's
[51:12] what you got to remember who's back in
[51:14] the one one man of you shall chase a
[51:17] thousand for the Lord your God he it is
[51:21] that fight is for you as he hath
[51:25] promised now you find how God works in
[51:29] such a great proportion in Deuteronomy
[51:32] 30 to 30 he says one shot chase a
[51:35] thousand and two will put Tim thousand
[51:39] to flight what we read in our text you
[51:43] do not hear Jonathan
[51:48] quoting this but yet the principle that
[51:53] he's standing on is based on the Word of
[51:56] God he Jonathan no doubt had so lived in
[52:00] that word till it wasn't about him
[52:02] remembered chapters and verse he had
[52:05] become so one with the character of the
[52:08] god of the word til when situations
[52:10] arose he spoke like God would speak when
[52:13] the situation arose taurah be to god
[52:19] somebody say lord help me be that kind
[52:22] of a man help me be that kind of a woman
[52:26] amen
[52:27] you know God specializes this is all the
[52:30] way through the scripture he specializes
[52:33] in taking people who seemingly are unfit
[52:37] for the task and would be outmatched
[52:41] outnumbered and God says that's what I
[52:45] need God doesn't need numbers when God
[52:52] got ready to go down and to deliver his
[52:55] people in Exodus 3 according to the
[52:58] promise remember he had to get one man
[53:01] first God has done the same thing down
[53:06] through the ages God would get
[53:09] man first and then that one man would be
[53:14] an instrument used by God just like it
[53:17] was in this generation that would make
[53:20] God real to you and I and what does it
[53:23] do it brings us to the awareness that he
[53:26] is still the same God amen and here God
[53:35] either let it be known I've come down to
[53:37] deliver Israel and I'm gonna send you
[53:43] now think about this
[53:45] Egypt is the mightiest nation in the
[53:47] world there might be something you're
[53:50] facing in your life that's pretty mighty
[53:53] and it might be the one that you're
[53:58] facing in your life or whatever the
[54:00] opposition is God has called you to be
[54:04] the vessel that he will manifest his
[54:08] glory through your life
[54:12] he meant a mighty it was a a mighty God
[54:16] coming down and here he takes one to be
[54:20] his spokesman who can't even talk right
[54:26] all of the weaknesses that Moses had
[54:29] becomes exposed in the presence of God
[54:32] aren't you glad God does that now your
[54:36] flesh will say no but the inside man
[54:37] says yes none of us like to be exposed
[54:42] and all of the you know our weaknesses
[54:44] but you see God knows that there is a
[54:48] part of you that's really him and the
[54:52] part of you that's really him is the
[54:54] part that God deals with because the
[54:56] part of you that's really him then that
[54:59] part it brings in subjection the other
[55:01] part pora be to God you see this is why
[55:07] brother Brennan would tell us God can do
[55:10] more with 15 in his hand than he could
[55:15] with 1500 out of his hand remember what
[55:20] the hand of God is it is the power of
[55:24] God it is the very person of God
[55:27] revealed this we think of a hand it's
[55:31] symbol as you find it in the Old
[55:32] Testament you find it over in the New
[55:34] Testament the hand of God it is God
[55:37] connecting with man and you find how he
[55:42] says God can do more with 15 in his hand
[55:46] than he could with 1500 out of his hand
[55:49] he said we appreciate 1500 in his hand
[55:52] instead of 15 in his hand if they'll
[55:56] stay in his hand that's the main thing
[56:00] being influenced not by what Britain
[56:03] numbers we are but what a great God that
[56:06] were representing and the kind of life
[56:09] that is in us by him that will influence
[56:13] others you see every time things get big
[56:18] man begins to think of himself
[56:25] you you know victories go on in our life
[56:28] and after you know victory after victory
[56:32] then we get to thinking as though it was
[56:35] us to done it now you might sit here and
[56:37] you you would disagree with me but let
[56:39] me just let me just show how this could
[56:42] be without dwelling on it tonight
[56:43] you see when victory after victory comes
[56:46] then you pull back on prayer then you
[56:50] pull back on reading and at the very
[56:54] moment it's you're letting your guard
[56:56] down and you're getting ready to get
[56:57] socked that's a separate that was free
[57:03] tonight but it was separate brother Bram
[57:09] said in spirit of truth I would rather
[57:11] have a church with fifty people in it in
[57:15] the will of God than to go have five
[57:17] thousand out of the will of God God can
[57:22] do more with a man in his will in one
[57:26] hour than he could with a man out of his
[57:29] will in 50 years notice in each one of
[57:34] these quotes God can God can do more not
[57:40] with about numbers but with surrendered
[57:43] hearts Jonathan and his armor-bearer
[57:49] were united in heart in purpose in
[57:54] motive and objective
[57:59] God can do more he says now notice he
[58:04] talked about that 50 years he is
[58:05] stumbling and staggering like shooting
[58:07] in the dark but when a man is really in
[58:10] the will of God and knows his calling he
[58:12] should abide there
[58:18] amen one man surrendered into his hands
[58:22] fully that's all God needs now look at
[58:25] this example in the book of Judges here
[58:30] God is in judges 6 16 he speaks to
[58:33] Gideon and he says surely I will be with
[58:37] thee and thou shalt smack the Midianites
[58:40] as one man now how God speaks to Gideon
[58:47] then notice how that God working with
[58:50] Gideon you know he first has got to get
[58:53] Gideon to have confidence in what the
[58:56] word is declaring about him
[59:01] you isn't then once now Gideon that
[59:07] confidence is within his life then God
[59:12] could speak to Gideon in judges 7 2 and
[59:15] he tells him the people that are with
[59:18] thee are too many for me to give the
[59:22] Midianites into their hands
[59:25] now let me remind you without reading
[59:28] about it
[59:28] the Midianites that were there out there
[59:31] that had come up to eat and to take of
[59:34] the wheat that where they had come the
[59:39] Bible that it speaks them and they were
[59:40] just like as grasshopper they were JIT
[59:42] they just like covered the landscape
[59:46] and here God tells Gideon the amount of
[59:51] people you've got with you is too much
[59:55] now let me just tell you right now
[59:58] he was already short-handed when it
[1:00:00] changed number two numbers all right
[1:00:05] he was already short hunters
[1:00:07] short-handed but then God lets him know
[1:00:10] there's too many for me to give the
[1:00:12] Midianites ooh their hands in this
[1:00:14] something God did not tell gideon this
[1:00:16] at the beginning i mean getting it was
[1:00:20] already afraid but now as god in his
[1:00:24] long-suffering and patience he reveals
[1:00:27] to Gideon who he is then God can let him
[1:00:31] know that's too many
[1:00:33] then are with you for me to give the
[1:00:35] Midianites into their hands lest Israel
[1:00:38] thought themselves against me saying
[1:00:41] mine own hand hath saved me so god goes
[1:00:46] on in tells him in verse three I want
[1:00:48] you to go tell in the ears of the people
[1:00:49] whoever is fearful and afraid let him
[1:00:52] return and depart early from Mount
[1:00:54] Gilead and there went from the people
[1:00:57] twenty and two thousand and there
[1:00:59] remained ten thousand now maybe get in
[1:01:02] fact who listen to it okay there's ten
[1:01:05] thousand left and God speaks to him
[1:01:09] again the people are yet too many
[1:01:15] my god is narrowing it down
[1:01:20] he's weeding it down
[1:01:23] bring them down unto the water and I
[1:01:26] will try them Ford V there in and
[1:01:30] amazing the final step is the water the
[1:01:35] final place of separation is the water
[1:01:39] they met in the final moment for Rebecca
[1:01:42] which he came to the water
[1:01:45] they met water being a type of the Holy
[1:01:48] Ghost bring them down to the water
[1:01:51] and God let him know those who get down
[1:01:55] on both knees and lap like a dog set him
[1:01:58] aside now you let him get to the water I
[1:02:03] hope you understand I don't want to read
[1:02:04] it because I got some other things I
[1:02:06] just want to drop here tonight he God
[1:02:08] let him know when he got him down to the
[1:02:10] water God didn't tell Gideon ahead of
[1:02:12] time he wanted get in to watch the
[1:02:15] people how the people would respond to
[1:02:18] the water whether they were going to try
[1:02:22] to make an idol out of the water or
[1:02:24] allow the water to move through them you
[1:02:29] understand to just make an idol out of
[1:02:32] it or allow the water to move through
[1:02:35] them yes I hope you understand what I'm
[1:02:37] saying here tonight we enjoy the
[1:02:40] presence of Almighty God
[1:02:42] but brother let me tell you something if
[1:02:45] this presence if it's only here that you
[1:02:48] sense that then you might want to look
[1:02:51] at how that you're you know you're
[1:02:53] drinking the water it's not just
[1:02:58] something where I come to church my when
[1:03:00] I come to church I'm gonna get beside
[1:03:02] myself you are to live beside yourself
[1:03:05] every day don't let the devil sell you
[1:03:07] short on that you say what do you saying
[1:03:11] don't treat it like an idle
[1:03:14] Amen the Holy Ghost ain't an idle it's
[1:03:17] the person of the Living God it's not
[1:03:20] like other idols that they have ears but
[1:03:23] they can't hear they have mouths but
[1:03:25] they can't speak but
[1:03:26] the person of Jesus Christ and the
[1:03:29] promise is that when he has come he said
[1:03:32] he'll lead and guide us into all truth
[1:03:33] he said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:03:36] you now I lift the always so he said set
[1:03:42] aside those who get down and they take
[1:03:45] the hand why because they're looking for
[1:03:50] him they are taking of the water of life
[1:03:54] and they're looking for the promise to
[1:03:56] be fulfilled you see their God here in
[1:04:02] verse 7 coming into this place here the
[1:04:05] Lord tells Gideon by the three hundred
[1:04:08] men that lapped will I save you oh Lord
[1:04:14] they went from thirty-two thousand to
[1:04:16] ten thousand to three hundred I don't
[1:04:19] know what kind of proportions those are
[1:04:21] but I do know what it comes out to be it
[1:04:24] comes out to be just about one percent
[1:04:26] of what they're going to be fighting
[1:04:28] and when you look at this in the natural
[1:04:31] you'd say wait a minute God should have
[1:04:34] been building him up obey God was you
[1:04:37] see with all the rest of that unbelief
[1:04:40] that was hanging around fear and afraid
[1:04:43] and those you know making an idol out of
[1:04:46] the message and other things like I got
[1:04:47] said I can't use them at all I can only
[1:04:52] use those who still left the water and
[1:04:56] the water brother and sister you can't
[1:04:58] separate the Holy Ghost and the word
[1:05:00] it's one in the same
[1:05:02] hey man listen you've got there's got to
[1:05:06] be a delight in by these 300 I will
[1:05:08] deliver Midian into that hand glory be
[1:05:13] to God let all the rest of them go back
[1:05:15] into the place I say God let us be
[1:05:19] dedicated to God in this manner it's a
[1:05:22] separation that's what was taking place
[1:05:24] here you know you think about it over
[1:05:30] the years and some of you that are you
[1:05:33] know much older than I am my how the
[1:05:36] numbers themselves seemingly have
[1:05:38] dwindled right you know and you even see
[1:05:43] that even in the midst of dwindling you
[1:05:45] see isms and everything else that's
[1:05:46] raising up you know because people want
[1:05:49] to rally around something but God sent
[1:05:55] in this hour the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] I'm not talking about brother Branham
[1:06:00] brother Brent said I'm not God's gift to
[1:06:03] you the Holy Ghost is God's gift
[1:06:06] hey man and we're to rally around the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost and listen friends here with
[1:06:12] you and I would have missed it but God
[1:06:14] had one of the stars in the right hand
[1:06:16] that would reflect his presence on earth
[1:06:19] in this hour that we can recognize a
[1:06:24] word that is brought to you and I then
[1:06:26] we can recognize who we are
[1:06:32] think about think about this think about
[1:06:34] it some of us have not maybe experienced
[1:06:39] that but I think about you know my dad I
[1:06:41] think about other brothers when God even
[1:06:45] as brother oil was standing here
[1:06:46] brothers from the Philippines that when
[1:06:49] the word has come to them here they are
[1:06:52] standing as pastors and ministers over
[1:06:54] great organizations of people they've
[1:06:58] got a choice do I walk with the word or
[1:07:01] do I stay
[1:07:03] with a big group of people now you might
[1:07:09] look and say wow what a choice they have
[1:07:10] but you know every one of us have their
[1:07:11] choice you have a choice what choice are
[1:07:16] you gonna make are you gonna even allow
[1:07:19] something to sidetrack you or you're
[1:07:21] gonna say lord I know how to fix
[1:07:24] everything else there might be a lot of
[1:07:26] things in your life that you say need to
[1:07:28] be fixing and this needs to come and
[1:07:30] this needs to come to remember you can't
[1:07:32] do it but if you keep your eyes and your
[1:07:37] heart United with God God will do what
[1:07:43] God does you keep your heart United with
[1:07:48] him and God will give you the desires of
[1:07:52] your heart that's a promise in this
[1:07:58] so God knows God doesn't need numbers he
[1:08:02] just needs surrendered hearts you think
[1:08:06] about this I don't have time maybe to
[1:08:09] read it but in first chronicles 12 when
[1:08:11] David was running from Saul
[1:08:15] there were many the Bible would call him
[1:08:18] helpers mighty men that were
[1:08:24] coming to David where David was gathered
[1:08:28] and they were coming to be of the help
[1:08:32] God was moving on their hearts in their
[1:08:35] lives and even when those of the tribe
[1:08:38] of Benjamin came notice in verse 16 of
[1:08:41] first chronicles twelve would just read
[1:08:43] it here are the children of Benjamin and
[1:08:45] Judah that came to the hold on Don and
[1:08:48] on to David and David went out to meet
[1:08:50] them and answered and said if you become
[1:08:53] peaceably unto me to help me thine heart
[1:08:58] shall be knit a mine heart shall be knit
[1:09:01] unto you but if you become too betrayed
[1:09:03] me to mine enemies seeing there is no
[1:09:06] wrong in mine hands
[1:09:07] the god of our fathers look thereon and
[1:09:10] rebuke it then the spirit came upon a
[1:09:14] micelle who was the chief of the
[1:09:16] captains and said thine are we David and
[1:09:19] on thy side thou son of Jesse see they
[1:09:23] recognized God was operating in David's
[1:09:27] life they were able to recognize the
[1:09:32] presence of God about David's life peace
[1:09:38] peace be unto thee and peace be to thine
[1:09:41] helpers for thy God help us V then David
[1:09:45] received them and made them captains of
[1:09:47] the band remember said in endtime seed
[1:09:51] sign he says we need one another right
[1:09:53] now more than we ever did in all the
[1:09:56] history of the world is right now real
[1:10:00] royal believers we need each other
[1:10:07] if a thought comes and says I don't need
[1:10:10] I don't need somebody else right there
[1:10:14] that already is contrary to the word God
[1:10:20] already preached it has last Thursday
[1:10:22] sermon I am my brother's keeper and let
[1:10:27] me just be mindful if you think you're a
[1:10:29] little bit better than a brother or
[1:10:31] sister your prayers are not even being
[1:10:33] heard for the brothers sister that
[1:10:35] you're praying for they've been the only
[1:10:38] way you have access to the throne of
[1:10:40] grace you must come with Grace in your
[1:10:43] heart hello women real royal believers
[1:10:52] Laura meter God we need each other
[1:10:57] hey ma'am the armor bearer said go on up
[1:11:00] Jonathan I'm with thee all that's in
[1:11:03] your heart I'm right there with you
[1:11:10] well that armor bear had to be in touch
[1:11:12] with God too it couldn't just be
[1:11:15] Jonathan Dharma bear had to be in touch
[1:11:18] with God for the armor bearer all of a
[1:11:20] sudden to recognize Jonathan didn't have
[1:11:22] a Bible study with him nothing wrong
[1:11:24] with a Bible study but it didn't have to
[1:11:26] give him all the scriptures of what I'm
[1:11:28] quoting from tonight it's that moment
[1:11:31] that they knew God and God was moving
[1:11:35] through their lives they had discernment
[1:11:38] for the moment that's what we must have
[1:11:43] that's what we need is discernment of
[1:11:46] the Holy Spirit you realize you're
[1:11:48] blessed to be able to sit in the
[1:11:50] services and be able to hear God
[1:11:52] speaking to you you're blessed friends
[1:11:57] because many people that has as a day
[1:11:59] gone by the only time they can hear God
[1:12:02] is when they put on a tape I'm telling
[1:12:05] you that is backslidden
[1:12:08] you don't know god you've got to know
[1:12:12] him in the power of his resurrection his
[1:12:16] voice is still the same today as it was
[1:12:20] yesterday I'm glad God didn't leave us
[1:12:26] to our own devices are you with me we're
[1:12:32] not just gathered here has a group of
[1:12:34] people just to make sure that we're
[1:12:36] finishing this right and you got this
[1:12:39] scripture right we're not here for that
[1:12:41] you can go to school for that
[1:12:43] amen were here to hear from God and then
[1:12:48] believing that God knows what I have
[1:12:51] need of
[1:12:52] [Applause]
[1:12:55] and that will tell you God speaks to me
[1:12:58] when I listen to the message God speaks
[1:13:02] to me when I read the Bible as a matter
[1:13:06] of fact I fell more in love with my
[1:13:09] Bible you with me Oh God would be to God
[1:13:18] you see it depends on how you're
[1:13:21] approaching the water yeah you're with
[1:13:25] me
[1:13:25] amen now notice this you see God I want
[1:13:30] you to think of this if I can just kind
[1:13:32] of uh drop this in God he he desires
[1:13:38] unity because where there is no unity he
[1:13:42] can't move but remember all he needs is
[1:13:47] one that's surrendered that one that
[1:13:50] surrendered then God can work through
[1:13:54] that heart to call others into that same
[1:13:59] place of surrender right before the Holy
[1:14:04] Ghost ever came on the day of Pentecost
[1:14:06] they were in one mind and one Accord is
[1:14:11] that right you see it had brought them
[1:14:13] into that place of the unity now I'll
[1:14:16] say it like this it's not a unity of man
[1:14:19] a unity of man looks at it and it looks
[1:14:22] across like on a night like tonight and
[1:14:24] then let's say you know here I don't
[1:14:26] know how many many we have here let's
[1:14:28] say you know maybe we have 35 or 40
[1:14:30] people here tonight and then you can
[1:14:33] look at it and then you think my we've
[1:14:34] got 40 people here tonight but you know
[1:14:36] Sunday Sunday we mind you know a half
[1:14:38] double that amount God is not interested
[1:14:41] neither does he need numbers to move all
[1:14:48] God needs is hearts that are surrendered
[1:14:52] in his pen now the enemy will do all he
[1:14:57] can to try to break unity
[1:15:01] everything that's why Paul would open in
[1:15:03] Ephesians four and tell us endeavor to
[1:15:06] keep the unity of the Spirit which is
[1:15:09] the bond of peace amen
[1:15:12] it's war to keep that unity so we see
[1:15:16] that it's not just unity we're among a
[1:15:20] group of people but it is hearts that
[1:15:24] are united with Christ then Christ he is
[1:15:28] the strength of the church then the
[1:15:32] strength of the church in hearts that
[1:15:35] are united with him and United together
[1:15:37] what is it it allows God to make his
[1:15:41] word manifest you see a person might say
[1:15:46] well you know I I want to see my family
[1:15:48] I want to see this but if you just let
[1:15:50] your heart be make sure your heart your
[1:15:54] life is united to God you might say well
[1:15:57] I haven't seen nothing in this one's
[1:15:59] attacked won't put a time limit on it
[1:16:01] but you need listen to me now
[1:16:03] you need to stand like Jonathan stood
[1:16:06] and you need to claim what God has given
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:15] when it came time for Israel to cross
[1:16:18] over into the land remember there was
[1:16:21] some who were given inheritance on this
[1:16:23] side and God spoke through Joshua and he
[1:16:29] says remember Moses said were to go
[1:16:33] fight together so when we come here you
[1:16:39] Passover with us fight the enemies in
[1:16:43] the land then you can go back to your
[1:16:46] inheritance oh now we could just really
[1:16:50] preach on that you see God is called
[1:16:55] that this would be a victory that would
[1:16:58] be a victory by the body now I want you
[1:17:03] to watch this here in Psalms 44 verse 1
[1:17:07] we have heard with our ears Oh God
[1:17:11] our fathers have told us what work Val
[1:17:15] dentist in their days in the times of
[1:17:18] all how thou did drive out the heathen
[1:17:22] with the hand and plant them and how
[1:17:24] thou did us the flick and cast them out
[1:17:27] who did it
[1:17:28] God for they got not the land in
[1:17:33] possession by their own sword neither
[1:17:36] did their own arm save them
[1:17:39] you mean they weren't swinging the sword
[1:17:41] that's not what he said it was not their
[1:17:46] marksmanship that won the battle it was
[1:17:51] because the Lord was on their side
[1:17:57] neither did their own arms save them but
[1:18:00] my right hand notice that right hand and
[1:18:03] 9 arm and the light of thy countenance
[1:18:05] because thou had us favor unto them thou
[1:18:09] art mighty no God here's the king of
[1:18:13] Israel saying thou art my king
[1:18:15] you see God had come back in position
[1:18:18] with David's life coming back into a
[1:18:23] place of authority
[1:18:25] thou art my king Oh God
[1:18:28] command deliverances for Jacob through
[1:18:32] thee will we push down our enemies
[1:18:35] through thy name we will tread them
[1:18:38] under that rise up against us for I will
[1:18:41] not trust in my bow that we're both it
[1:18:45] actually deals with the strength neither
[1:18:47] shall my sword save me but thou have
[1:18:51] saved us from our enemies and has put
[1:18:54] them to shame that hated us in God we
[1:18:59] boast all the day long and praise thy
[1:19:03] name forever amen somebody say help me
[1:19:08] to talk that kind of talk let me make my
[1:19:13] boast in God all the day long
[1:19:16] amen let's draw here to a place in the
[1:19:19] scripture here tonight in second
[1:19:22] Corinthians second chronicles chapter 14
[1:19:24] verse 9 another place I want you to look
[1:19:27] here
[1:19:29] in the scripture here we find a say so
[1:19:32] the king
[1:19:34] they're in Judah I want to just move to
[1:19:38] verse nine here just skip a little bit
[1:19:41] you find that amongst within Israel they
[1:19:46] never come to a place where they could
[1:19:48] just sit around and just relax
[1:19:52] but they had to be on guard
[1:19:55] they had to be building themselves up
[1:19:58] they had to make ready during times of
[1:20:01] rest
[1:20:03] because one thing was sure battle was
[1:20:07] coming it's kind of like women you know
[1:20:11] the nighttime the mesquita start up by
[1:20:13] the time you know the morning when you
[1:20:15] walk around in your plants you're not
[1:20:17] battling with mosquitoes but if you
[1:20:19] stick around they'll be here in the
[1:20:21] evening again y'all know what I'm saying
[1:20:24] that's the same way it is with the devil
[1:20:28] that's how it is when you find it when
[1:20:31] you look in the scriptures about the
[1:20:33] Philistines about the malachite if you
[1:20:36] read in the scripture many times it
[1:20:38] seems like my they smote all the
[1:20:41] malachite and you think my they're wiped
[1:20:44] off and then you think here they are a
[1:20:46] few chapters later they dealt with all
[1:20:50] the malachite that was press and then
[1:20:52] just like God calls us in our life to
[1:20:56] deal with things in our life right then
[1:20:58] and there
[1:21:01] then you find here comes a battle a
[1:21:06] chapter or two later but what's this how
[1:21:09] it comes out there came against them it
[1:21:11] came against I came against here against
[1:21:14] Judah there came on against them Zahra
[1:21:17] the Ethiopian with a host of a thousand
[1:21:19] thousand and three hundred chariots and
[1:21:21] came to Marissa
[1:21:23] then ASA went out against him and they
[1:21:27] set the battle in array in the valley of
[1:21:29] zefa at the Marissa and ASA cried unto
[1:21:34] the Lord his God and said Lord it is
[1:21:39] nothing with thee to help weather with
[1:21:43] many or with them that have no power
[1:21:51] amen he knew about this come on somebody
[1:21:57] you see these are these what we're
[1:21:59] reading here these are lives that are in
[1:22:04] touch with God then they know that he
[1:22:07] given power to the faint amen
[1:22:11] to glows Isaiah 40 that have no strength
[1:22:14] he increases their strength you see
[1:22:19] they're standing on the promises of God
[1:22:22] oh I hope we catch you tonight as it's
[1:22:30] coming amen
[1:22:32] you think about that the prophets of old
[1:22:34] brother man fills in some spiritual food
[1:22:36] and be seasoned he said those those
[1:22:39] profits so lived in the presence of God
[1:22:42] he said till they spoke as God I'm
[1:22:47] telling you he spoke that in spiritual
[1:22:50] food a new season and he did not type
[1:22:52] Elijah in that message as the messenger
[1:22:56] he typed Elijah as the Church of the
[1:22:59] Living God in the last days that has a
[1:23:02] place that they can hide away and eat
[1:23:06] that stored up food him and God's got
[1:23:13] Ravens he's got servants to deliver it
[1:23:18] hallelujah Amen here you see it's not
[1:23:23] about you and I hope you're with me
[1:23:25] tonight it's not about you and I
[1:23:26] remember eysan in memorizing this and
[1:23:29] memorizing that it's just lay in the
[1:23:32] word and let our character and I ride so
[1:23:35] become him to where when we speak we
[1:23:39] speak as God
[1:23:44] hallelujah don't glory be to God Lord
[1:23:50] it's nothing with me to help with
[1:23:52] whether with many or with them that have
[1:23:54] no power help us O Lord our God
[1:23:58] for we rest on thee and in thy name we
[1:24:02] go against this multitude Oh Lord thou
[1:24:06] art our God let not man prevail against
[1:24:11] thee hasten ooh
[1:24:15] there's no restraint with God he can
[1:24:18] save by many he can say by few it
[1:24:22] doesn't matter but it has to be him to
[1:24:24] do the saving if he has many they got to
[1:24:28] be yielded to him if he has for you all
[1:24:30] they have to me as yielded to him it's
[1:24:32] him that does the saving they're right I
[1:24:39] want you just to think of this here you
[1:24:43] know when you we look at numbers
[1:24:46] there's another place in the scripture
[1:24:48] second chronicles chapter 25
[1:24:51] there's a man by the name of Marcia he's
[1:24:58] a king of Judah he gathers Judah
[1:25:01] together in verse five and he prepares
[1:25:05] them for war there to go and there to
[1:25:10] fight against against these people of
[1:25:15] Seir which is Edom
[1:25:18] they're gonna be fighting against Eden
[1:25:20] but I want you to notice he gathers all
[1:25:23] of Judah together here is Judah coming
[1:25:25] in order in verse six he hired also an
[1:25:31] hundred thousand mighty men of valor out
[1:25:35] of Israel for an hundred talents of
[1:25:38] silver
[1:25:40] remember the kingdoms are split here's
[1:25:43] Judah
[1:25:43] here's Israel and here this shows the
[1:25:49] humanity and about us he's got something
[1:25:55] that needs to be done and what he's
[1:25:57] looking at his numbers but he's
[1:26:01] forgetting God never brought victory to
[1:26:05] Israel because of how many people they
[1:26:09] were God don't work that way
[1:26:14] it's about lives that are surrendered so
[1:26:17] here you find he purchases some mighty
[1:26:21] men of valor from that of Israel
[1:26:25] hmm but you see notice there came a man
[1:26:30] of God in verse 7 and a king o king let
[1:26:33] not the army of Israel go with thee for
[1:26:35] the Lord is not with Israel to wit with
[1:26:40] all the children of Ephraim you see even
[1:26:43] though this was of Israel but they were
[1:26:46] given to idols and here a man of God was
[1:26:52] able to say don't don't bring them in to
[1:26:56] fight with you because the Lord is not
[1:27:01] with them I believe God's making a
[1:27:06] statement here he's letting us know
[1:27:08] what's important is it must be the Lord
[1:27:11] that is with us I don't care how good a
[1:27:16] person can preach sing and how good they
[1:27:19] might look on the outside come on
[1:27:24] somebody I don't care if they fit the
[1:27:26] checklist of what you say this is a
[1:27:28] checklist message believer but you gotta
[1:27:31] look beyond the outside let's look to
[1:27:35] the inside
[1:27:37] it doesn't matter friends you understand
[1:27:40] it's about what is the substance that's
[1:27:43] on the inside is it a substance that God
[1:27:47] is with them I'd rather be standing
[1:27:52] there shoulder to shoulder with a
[1:27:55] brother he may not know his ABCs he may
[1:27:58] not maybe be verse and maybe have a deal
[1:28:01] with a demon but he stands there with
[1:28:03] faith in his heart and he knows that God
[1:28:05] his steel God and God still is he speaks
[1:28:09] through his vessels
[1:28:12] I'd rather stand shoulder-to-shoulder
[1:28:14] with somebody like that than somebody
[1:28:17] that can quote all the quotes I quote
[1:28:19] all the scriptures but can't hear God
[1:28:22] speak or glow to be to God God can do
[1:28:30] more with a few than he can with many
[1:28:37] but if that will go go do it be strong
[1:28:42] for the battle God shall make thee fall
[1:28:46] before the enemy for God hath power to
[1:28:50] help and to cast down you see what God
[1:28:55] lets him know it's your choice you want
[1:28:59] to take these hired mercenaries go ahead
[1:29:02] but I was want you to know it's in my
[1:29:05] power to either cast down your enemy or
[1:29:09] for you to fall it's in my power
[1:29:14] how glory God is calling their attention
[1:29:18] here and a mazda said to the man of god
[1:29:20] but what shall we do for the hundred
[1:29:22] talents which i've given to the army of
[1:29:24] Israel I'm thinking about his money now
[1:29:28] what shall I do with all of this that
[1:29:31] I've given and the man of God answered
[1:29:34] the Lord is able to give thee much more
[1:29:38] than this whoa I mean he's already out a
[1:29:45] hundred talents
[1:29:46] among those men but you see obedience is
[1:29:50] better than sacrifice but he would not
[1:29:54] only reap and to gain because look that
[1:29:57] money that he spent on them guys they
[1:29:59] wasn't going to perform but here God
[1:30:03] said look we don't need your money I
[1:30:05] just need your heart to believe that I
[1:30:08] can still move Oh glory and the Bible
[1:30:17] says you know when he told him verse 10
[1:30:19] go home they were angered they were
[1:30:22] angered oh they were anger against Judah
[1:30:24] in verse 11 Amasya strengthened himself
[1:30:26] and he led forth the people went to the
[1:30:29] valley of salt and they smote the
[1:30:30] children of Seir ten thousand another
[1:30:33] ten thousand left there live in the
[1:30:35] children of Judah they carried him away
[1:30:37] captive and then they they smote them I
[1:30:39] don't want to just I just want to go to
[1:30:41] this place now you come down here let's
[1:30:45] come down to is Ezra chapter 8 verse 21
[1:30:52] here is Ezra with much Treasury he's got
[1:30:58] a lot that they've been given from the
[1:31:04] king
[1:31:05] but take back in Jerusalem remember
[1:31:07] they've been exiled exiled into Babylon
[1:31:09] now the captivity the release here is as
[1:31:13] you are coming forth the foundation of
[1:31:14] the has already been laid the temple all
[1:31:18] of that is in place now it's to come and
[1:31:21] bring back the Treasury of the temple
[1:31:24] and Ezra he comes to a place after
[1:31:28] leaving from the Kings house and he
[1:31:32] proclaims a fast there at the river of
[1:31:36] hover that we might afflict ourselves
[1:31:40] before our God to seek Him a right way
[1:31:43] for us and for our little ones and for
[1:31:46] all our substance in other words what do
[1:31:50] I do in this situation for I was ashamed
[1:31:56] to require of the king a band of
[1:31:59] soldiers and horsemen to help us against
[1:32:03] the enemy in the way because we had
[1:32:06] spoken unto the king saying the hand of
[1:32:10] our God is upon all them for good
[1:32:13] that seek Him
[1:32:16] what a promise the hand of God remember
[1:32:19] he was at the hand of God that he
[1:32:21] quipped them to get the land it's the
[1:32:25] hand of God upon our lives his strength
[1:32:30] his power the hand of our God is upon
[1:32:34] all them for good that seek him but his
[1:32:36] power and his wrath is against all them
[1:32:39] that forsake him so we fast and besought
[1:32:45] our God for this and he was entreated of
[1:32:50] us still doubt in our lives you come we
[1:32:55] come to place and we need to know what's
[1:32:57] the will of God what's the will of God
[1:33:02] but you come to this point here Ezra he
[1:33:06] was tempted to go back and say hey can
[1:33:07] we have an escort all of the Treasury
[1:33:09] that we have can we have horsemen can we
[1:33:12] have protection but he says after what I
[1:33:15] testified I can't go back on what was
[1:33:20] spoken
[1:33:22] I can't go back so he stands there and
[1:33:26] God comes and makes known to him
[1:33:31] take the Treasury divided among the
[1:33:35] priests and have them go to Jerusalem
[1:33:38] and it all come back together at
[1:33:41] Jerusalem the Bible says they did not
[1:33:44] lose one bit of the Treasury it all came
[1:33:50] to Jerusalem it was with one heart one
[1:33:54] motive one purpose one objective amen
[1:34:00] and they arrived at the right place if
[1:34:03] you look in your Bible let's just look
[1:34:05] here just at the end of this chapter we
[1:34:07] read in 1st samuel 14 verse 23 here's
[1:34:13] the end result of what we were looking
[1:34:16] at
[1:34:21] so the Lord saved Israel that day and
[1:34:26] the battle passed over unto Beth Haven
[1:34:33] God saved him that day because of one
[1:34:39] man surrendered in the hand of God by
[1:34:43] the name of Jonathan and his
[1:34:46] armor-bearer that said I'm with you do
[1:34:52] all that's in your heart
[1:34:56] they went up together and God moved on
[1:35:01] their behalf and they smoked 20 men
