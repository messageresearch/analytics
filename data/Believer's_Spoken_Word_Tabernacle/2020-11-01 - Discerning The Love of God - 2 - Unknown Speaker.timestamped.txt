[43:12] of our thoughts and that everything
[43:15] would be centered upon
[43:18] you Lord just that you would come just
[43:21] take control of speaker and hearer
[43:23] minister to every need for the glory of
[43:26] God we ask we ask it in Jesus name
[43:31] amen amen God bless you this morning so
[43:34] good to be in the house of the Lord
[43:36] together amen if you'll turn with me to
[43:38] Ephesians
[43:42] 3 and I want to read a few verses of
[43:46] scripture as let you be seated here in
[43:49] just a
[43:50] moment in Ephesians
[43:53] 3 and verse 14
[44:05] and Paul would write like this for this
[44:11] cause I bow my
[44:14] knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[44:19] Christ of whom the whole family in
[44:22] Heaven and Earth is named
[44:27] that he would Grant you according to the
[44:29] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[44:34] with might by his spirit in the inner
[44:38] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[44:43] by faith notice dwell in our hearts by
[44:46] faith the inner man
[44:48] strengthened what is that inner man
[44:50] that's that seed Gene of God Amen and
[44:55] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[44:56] fath faith that ye being rooted and
[45:00] grounded in Love Now think of it anytime
[45:04] you have ever I think many many people
[45:06] in here you plant different things uh
[45:09] some of you plant tomatoes some of you
[45:10] plant you know your flowers and things
[45:12] and you realize that in order for that
[45:14] plant to actually come forth whether
[45:16] it's certain colors you want to see in
[45:18] it or fruit or vegetables whatever it is
[45:21] that plant itself must actually become
[45:25] established it must become rooted and it
[45:28] must become grounded is that right in
[45:32] order for it to bring forth so here is
[45:35] here is Paul under the inspiration of
[45:37] God that how the inner man would be
[45:39] strengthened by his might that Christ
[45:42] would dwell in our hearts by faith that
[45:47] we would be rooted and grounded in love
[45:50] so when you're rooted in everything you
[45:52] know you could sprinkle all the you know
[45:55] all the water you know a lot of times
[45:57] you could water a plant and you water up
[45:58] up here the leaves don't take in the
[46:00] water they don't take in the water what
[46:03] actually supplies the nutrients for the
[46:06] plant roots right when it's rooted it
[46:10] draws from beneath the ground that you
[46:13] and I it draws from a source we don't
[46:15] see we don't see all the different
[46:17] nitrogen and things like that going in
[46:19] but it's there in the soil is that right
[46:22] and then you also know that there's
[46:23] times when you plant certain types of
[46:25] plants you got to check the acidity of
[46:27] the level of the soil what's the pH
[46:30] level you know certain ones you some of
[46:31] you that raises zelas and roses and
[46:33] dogwoods and things like that you know
[46:35] there's certain acidity that is needed
[46:37] in the soil well you know what in our
[46:40] lives we need checkups amen yes amen we
[46:44] need a certain acidity a certain
[46:46] saltiness of the holy spirit amen amen
[46:49] aren't you glad that there's a faithful
[46:52] Gardener that's been placed in the
[46:55] garden amen may be able now notice may
[46:58] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[47:01] what is the breadth length and depth and
[47:04] height and to know the love of Christ
[47:08] which passeth knowledge that ye might be
[47:13] filled with all the fullness of God now
[47:17] unto him that is able to do exceeding
[47:20] abundantly above all that we ask or
[47:22] think according to the power that
[47:26] worketh in us oh that's beautiful ain't
[47:29] it amen unto him be glory in the church
[47:35] by Christ Jesus throughout all ages
[47:38] World Without End amen amen may the Lord
[47:42] bless you as you're being seated I'd
[47:44] like
[47:44] to continue to speak to you here this
[47:47] morning on the thought we were looking
[47:49] on Thursday Discerning the love of God
[47:52] we recognize that God's desire from the
[47:55] very beginning
[47:57] that love itself we know love as the
[48:01] scripture would tell us love is God and
[48:03] we looked at a little bit on Thursday
[48:05] I'm not going to review that but to see
[48:07] how that it's so contrary to even how
[48:10] the world and much even of religion or
[48:13] christom of how that they would view or
[48:15] experience love many experience or view
[48:19] love as something that is sappy let you
[48:21] get by with anything and you know it
[48:23] doesn't you know judge you it doesn't
[48:25] correct you it doesn't and and that's
[48:27] not real love because as a reality is
[48:30] real love will bring correction to our
[48:32] life where it's needed to think about it
[48:35] you know that that's what actually comes
[48:37] about where love is ministered to our
[48:40] life it comes to correct or drive away
[48:43] or as the Bible would say that the rod
[48:45] driveth the foolishness out of the heart
[48:47] of the child so the love of God will
[48:50] actually do that and so we're thankful
[48:53] that we see that how that love in the
[48:55] very beginning was love that was
[48:57] governing right there in the Garden of
[49:00] Eden they were not under a law they was
[49:02] it was a love affair God had given them
[49:05] that word as a matter of fact brother
[49:06] Brown would tell us that they had
[49:08] perfect understanding of the love of God
[49:11] and you might you know we would look at
[49:12] that and think well perfect
[49:14] understanding but it was an atmosphere
[49:15] it was a condition you could ask them
[49:18] let's just look at it in this way
[49:20] because this is where brother Bram is
[49:21] going if we look at it in this way if
[49:23] you would have asked Adam or you asked
[49:25] Eve does God love you no question no
[49:28] doubt they had perfect understanding the
[49:30] perfect understanding was not that they
[49:32] understood all that was God had given
[49:35] them by commandment as a matter of fact
[49:36] brother Bram tells us that Adam did not
[49:39] understand that and God would await to
[49:41] an appointed season to open up his word
[49:44] and this is then where in the time of
[49:45] that Waiting for God to make it known to
[49:47] where the enemy slipped in and wanted to
[49:49] interpret the promise but we know that
[49:52] every time that God gives his word God
[49:55] does not leave it nor entrust it to the
[49:56] hands of a man to interpret it but that
[49:59] word is actually going to be interpreted
[50:01] by God himself fulfilling that word and
[50:04] so when we we see it in this measure
[50:06] that the perfect understanding of the
[50:08] love of God is where there was a love
[50:10] there was a confidence that they
[50:12] operated with an atmosphere and there
[50:15] was a complete understanding there was
[50:17] no fear that was there whatsoever and
[50:20] now to think how that God has brought us
[50:23] back into that place where the first
[50:25] Adam where the fall took place the
[50:27] second adom the quickening spirit now
[50:29] brings us back into that place again to
[50:32] where that love is to be the so
[50:35] governing Authority and Power in our
[50:37] life which is the Holy Ghost and so when
[50:40] we look at the family of God the family
[50:42] of God as we read here in these
[50:43] scriptures is that which is born of the
[50:46] spirit of God it's the love of God as
[50:48] Paul would write that is shed abroad in
[50:51] our hearts by the Holy Ghost to think of
[50:53] what God was in Christ all that God was
[50:57] he poured into Christ and all that
[50:58] Christ was he poured into church into
[51:01] the church this is why that when we look
[51:04] at as we're reading on Thursday night
[51:06] and how that John here uh you know a
[51:09] great Paradox here when he writes about
[51:12] the love of God and the love among the
[51:14] Brethren this is why that when that has
[51:16] so struck our hearts inity this is why
[51:18] that hatred has no part in or among
[51:21] Believers at all and that's why because
[51:24] the love of God is a our hearts is to
[51:27] display that same life that was
[51:29] displayed in Jesus Christ it's deeper
[51:33] than just loyalty
[51:36] right I want to just drop that you can
[51:39] be loyal to something and yet not in
[51:42] love you could be loyal to your mate and
[51:45] yet you're not in love you could be
[51:47] loyal to a church and yet you're not in
[51:49] love with God this is why brother brand
[51:52] he brings it down and and how the spirit
[51:54] of God will point it out because look
[51:56] we're living living in a time you can
[51:57] find people even in even in the times we
[52:00] live that are very loyal dedicated
[52:03] church members is that right but there's
[52:07] something that goes so far beyond this
[52:09] is like when brother B says the
[52:10] difference between a Christian and a
[52:11] holy ghost filed Christian it's deeper
[52:13] than loyalty to a church it's much
[52:16] greater than that it actually comes it's
[52:18] a love affair right it's a love affair
[52:22] not just a loyalty But A Love Affair and
[52:24] if it's a real love affair it will make
[52:26] us Loy not just loyal to a church but it
[52:28] brings the loyalty to him no matter
[52:31] where we are no matter where he's at
[52:33] it's like the young man who was over
[52:35] there studying at to be an artist in
[52:37] Rome all the rest of the Americans would
[52:39] go out they would party they would do
[52:40] everything else and this guy who was a
[52:42] caretaker he asked this young man he
[52:44] said I noticed something about you he
[52:46] said you're different he said why don't
[52:48] you go out and run around with the rest
[52:49] of these Americans now they were all
[52:51] Americans but he said now he said let me
[52:54] tell you why he said there's a young
[52:56] lady he said back over home in a certain
[52:58] State and he said in that certain State
[53:01] there's a certain city and in that
[53:02] certain city there's a certain Street on
[53:05] that certain Street there's a certain
[53:06] house and he said in that house is a
[53:08] certain young lady he said I have
[53:10] promised myself he said to her he said
[53:13] so why I am here he said I am living
[53:16] according to that promise even though
[53:18] that he couldn't see her but his the
[53:21] love itself is what held him and that's
[53:23] exactly what the love of God does in the
[53:26] heart of a real believer and to think
[53:29] that the love of God I want you to
[53:30] capture this now the love of God does
[53:33] not work contrary to the word of God or
[53:36] to the body of Jesus Christ because it's
[53:39] a spirit of Truth in 1 John 4:12 no man
[53:43] hath seen God at any time if we love one
[53:47] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[53:51] is perfected in us now remember a person
[53:53] can say well I I I love the Brethren but
[53:56] if if you're not walking in harmony with
[53:58] the Holy Spirit and your life is
[54:00] tallying up with the word then it's not
[54:02] a fulfillment of what's being C being
[54:04] called out here because when you really
[54:06] love the Brethren the only way you can
[54:08] really love the Brethren the way you
[54:09] ought to is to have the love of God in
[54:12] your heart which is comes by the baptism
[54:14] of the Holy Ghost and when that operates
[54:17] in that channel it puts you in the body
[54:19] of Christ which is the word of God the
[54:21] revealed promise of the day and you're
[54:23] walking in harmony with Jesus Christ and
[54:26] then as you walk in harmony with Jesus
[54:28] Christ you'll be walking in harmony with
[54:30] one another who are of that same body
[54:33] because you're under a true vision of
[54:35] the word so if we love one another God
[54:37] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[54:42] in us remember it was man who fell so
[54:46] God would come down to redeem man what
[54:48] brought him down love brought him down
[54:51] and so his love is perfected not our
[54:53] love remember as we looked at on on
[54:55] Thursday night it does not say in the
[54:57] scripture wives love your husbands but
[54:59] it says husbands love your wives because
[55:02] we could never you and I could never be
[55:04] able to produce this kind of a love we
[55:06] fell from this love we fell from that
[55:09] agape love and fell down into into a
[55:12] place that was beneath that so it
[55:14] required God himself to come down and
[55:17] Manifest this love to you and I walking
[55:20] here in this life and that would capture
[55:23] our hearts and our lives in order to
[55:25] bring us back into this place that we
[55:28] were intended to live and to dwell in we
[55:31] were intended that our lives would be
[55:33] under the influence regulated under the
[55:35] control of Agape Love Now one thing you
[55:38] see about agape love it's different than
[55:41] all as you take love and you go right on
[55:43] down the strain brother Ram would
[55:44] describe it in the Hebrew series and
[55:46] many other places if you look that agape
[55:48] love is not a love that's self-seeking
[55:50] nor selfs serving Agape Love Is that
[55:54] which actually it's looking at out it's
[55:56] looking out for the other person it's
[55:59] looking out for other interests isn't it
[56:00] a paradox that God here you and I come
[56:03] by a birth now think about what our
[56:05] birth was our birth was based as as
[56:08] David would say we were born in sin
[56:09] shaped and iniquity come to the world
[56:11] speaking lies we entered this we entered
[56:13] this as brother bam said without a
[56:15] fighting chance we entered it and here
[56:17] about that this body this creation even
[56:20] though there was a love between father
[56:21] and mother and so forth but yet here we
[56:23] are born under a fallen condition a
[56:26] fallen nature and God doesn't come to
[56:28] try to change our flesh he doesn't come
[56:30] to try to change our spirit but what he
[56:32] wants to do is get to the inside the
[56:34] control part because when he gets to
[56:37] that inside part where that son and
[56:39] daughter of God is laying dormant and
[56:41] the quickening power comes upon it it
[56:43] will raise up what was dead and bring it
[56:45] to life and it will be an expression of
[56:48] his love that will emanate and move
[56:50] throughout all the other courts of our
[56:52] life does that of the new birth on the
[56:55] soul does it change the spirit and the
[56:57] body no it just simply gives us the
[56:59] control we're in contact with God in
[57:02] tune with him our desire is to follow
[57:04] him and so this is why when things come
[57:06] our way evil thoughts and everything
[57:08] else that comes our way we have a power
[57:11] on the inside a ruling power there's
[57:13] another King on the inside there's
[57:16] another Administration on the inside
[57:18] that's able and stands there to rule
[57:21] thanks be to God for the Holy Ghost so
[57:24] this is where the love of God is
[57:26] perfected in us or it comes to its
[57:28] completion when you and I have been born
[57:31] again now when we look at that the love
[57:34] of God coming into Perfection is much
[57:37] like when you think of the Tabernacle in
[57:39] the wilderness of how that they were to
[57:41] prepare that Tabernacle in the
[57:43] wilderness they were to build it there
[57:45] was a certain pattern that it must be
[57:46] followed and when following that pattern
[57:49] that was given by the spirit then when
[57:51] the when the Tabernacle itself was
[57:54] complete or reared up and it would speak
[57:56] there in Exodus their time in Solomon's
[57:58] time it would speak in that time of when
[58:01] it was perfected it'll actually use
[58:03] those words in the book of chonicles
[58:05] when it is finished and when the
[58:07] finishing time had come it was not man
[58:09] who could say oh this is work is
[58:11] finished oh this work is perfect it
[58:13] wasn't that it was the very presence of
[58:16] the shic glory that came down and it
[58:19] filled the temple and that in itself was
[58:21] the capping the finishing the Perfection
[58:24] of that work it was that which had been
[58:27] given by vision is now come forth and
[58:30] God says Ah this is what I had in my
[58:32] mind and he comes and he sets down in
[58:35] the midst of that Temple that's what
[58:36] he's done for you and I this is where
[58:39] the love of God is perfected in us now
[58:41] when we look at it the Bible says 1 John
[58:44] 4:17 herein is our love made perfect our
[58:49] love made perfect now this was not our
[58:51] love originally this is his love right
[58:56] herein is our love made perfect that we
[59:00] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[59:03] that's confidence because as he is so
[59:07] are we in this world because it is that
[59:11] same life that he came down the same God
[59:14] who came down and lived that life it's
[59:16] the righteousness of the law is the
[59:18] spirit of Jesus Christ and that same
[59:21] holy spirit that same life God's Own
[59:24] Life coming back inside of us it is that
[59:27] which which brings about a real pardon
[59:29] it generates Purity in our life it
[59:31] brings forth the real Perfection of God
[59:34] driving out all the the love of the
[59:36] world and it sets down in our heart to
[59:38] where the desire that we have is to
[59:40] please him our love is to him our
[59:43] devotion is to him that's his working in
[59:47] our life as he is is he holy yes amen
[59:50] you're holy Hallelujah is he innocent
[59:53] amen you're innocent come on now amen
[59:56] brother bam dedicating the baby and is
[59:57] standing right there you know in the
[59:59] message look and he's dedicating the
[1:00:01] baby he says oh to think of these little
[1:00:03] babies how innocent he said but do you
[1:00:05] realize if you've been born again of the
[1:00:07] spirit of God you are more innocent than
[1:00:10] one of these little babies why this is
[1:00:12] why being born again it's not just a
[1:00:14] church membership it's just not
[1:00:16] recognition of something it's an actual
[1:00:18] Sovereign Supernatural work of almighty
[1:00:21] God where God brings forth his child and
[1:00:24] you and I we're not we don't have an old
[1:00:26] and past no there's a new beginning
[1:00:29] there is a new creation in Christ Jesus
[1:00:33] when they walked out of Egypt one of the
[1:00:34] very first announcements with that
[1:00:36] Exodus when the Lamb's blood was to be
[1:00:38] applied this day shall be a new
[1:00:40] beginning unto you amen so it's our love
[1:00:44] it's it's the love that is fully brought
[1:00:46] forth the son or daughter of God and to
[1:00:49] recognize how that it's so it's just
[1:00:52] some to me when we look at it it's just
[1:00:54] so overwhelming of how that the god of
[1:00:56] Glory would come down and he would so
[1:00:59] descend in such a measure with his love
[1:01:02] to where now he would take up residency
[1:01:05] in the lives of his sons and daughters
[1:01:07] of God that part that he put on the
[1:01:09] inside do you realize it was not our
[1:01:11] flesh that welcomed him it was not our
[1:01:14] spirit that welcomed him but he was
[1:01:16] welcomed in that place that he himself
[1:01:19] had brought forth what was that that was
[1:01:21] that soul that was there that seed Gene
[1:01:24] of God that was a place that he could
[1:01:26] say that always belonged to me that was
[1:01:29] always me that's who you really are and
[1:01:32] he could say this belongs to me it was
[1:01:34] lost it went astray but I've come to
[1:01:37] redeem it I've paid the price thank you
[1:01:41] Lord oh glory be to God that now that
[1:01:44] same Glory could be reflected through
[1:01:46] our life this is where that in our lives
[1:01:48] now think of this in the Tabernacle in
[1:01:50] the wilderness in Solomon's Temple
[1:01:52] remember then coming in the glory of God
[1:01:55] that would come forth there was that
[1:01:57] Mana that originally fell they put that
[1:01:59] in there that Mana never got old and
[1:02:01] never got stale it never got stagnant
[1:02:03] this is why there's got to be a genuine
[1:02:06] birth of the Holy Ghost you'll go
[1:02:08] through tests you'll go through trials
[1:02:09] there'll be times of failure and
[1:02:11] everything else but when the genuine
[1:02:13] Holy Ghost gets to the inside on that
[1:02:15] seed it never goes stale it never gets
[1:02:18] moth eaten it never gets eaten away with
[1:02:21] anything else it stays constant the
[1:02:23] whole time but if it's just on the flesh
[1:02:25] look out it can actually develop worms
[1:02:28] if it just comes upon the spirit it can
[1:02:30] get moldy and stale but when it goes
[1:02:32] into that place that om that seed that
[1:02:35] life that son and daughter of God that
[1:02:37] God intends for it it will bring forth
[1:02:40] and there is not a staleness oh you know
[1:02:42] sure you might get cold half times where
[1:02:44] you're down but you have got a hidden
[1:02:46] power on the inside and as a son and
[1:02:48] daughter of God you've got a father that
[1:02:50] loves you enough that he'll correct you
[1:02:53] when you're wrong and let you know pick
[1:02:54] it up step up a little bit glory be to
[1:02:57] God you got one who's not worried about
[1:03:00] oh I don't know maybe I shouldn't say
[1:03:02] this I want him to love me so much he
[1:03:03] realizes our love is based on confidence
[1:03:07] and Trust I can't trust nobody if they
[1:03:09] don't tell me the truth amen sometimes
[1:03:12] the truth hurts you right is that right
[1:03:15] what if you told her what if you had a
[1:03:16] doctor oh my everything's all right
[1:03:18] you're doing good you keep I tell you

[1:03:22] on doing all this man you're all right
[1:03:24] that guy's only wanting your money right
[1:03:27] but sometimes they got to tell you the
[1:03:29] truth and say you know what you need to
[1:03:30] stop doing
[1:03:32] this
[1:03:34] well I'm glad that Dr Jesus is like that
[1:03:37] aren't
[1:03:40] you oh my there is no fear in love but

[1:04:20] the form of his word to make it known to
[1:04:24] you and I in a personal way so much so
[1:04:27] to the degree but you recognize if you
[1:04:29] were the only person upon this Earth he
[1:04:33] would have done it because he did it for
[1:04:36] you glory be to God you're not just a
[1:04:39] bystander and got caught up and a little
[1:04:41] bit of the love of God splashed out
[1:04:43] you're not a bystander it was
[1:04:45] intentional that the word has come
[1:04:48] across your pathway it is intentional
[1:04:50] and purposeful that God has moved and

[1:06:15] what was in there amen amen what was in
[1:06:18] there why did he purchase this whole
[1:06:20] field right why did bohas purchase all
[1:06:23] of Naomi's estate to get Ruth
[1:06:27] now there's many that will benefit from
[1:06:28] that purchase that are not elect but he

[1:07:06] condemn the world but that the world
[1:07:09] through him might be saved amen now when
[1:07:13] you think of it you know brother Bron
[1:07:15] will continue to lay this out and just
[1:07:16] to capture it how that you know there's
[1:07:19] nothing so stronger than the love of God
[1:07:22] love will make you trust Hallelujah love

[1:07:29] and you know it's when you lack
[1:07:30] confidence that's when fear wants to
[1:07:32] step in but if you love it'll cast The
[1:07:36] Fear away it it it's that which God
[1:07:39] projects God projects his love and it's
[1:07:42] his love that makes you and I what we
[1:07:44] are that's right you see there's an
[1:07:46] atmosphere in confidences we would even
[1:07:49] move forward here in the service I want
[1:07:50] you to think of these two words
[1:07:52] atmosphere and confidence in the Bible
[1:07:55] in Galatians 5: 6 for in Christ Jesus
[1:08:00] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:08:03] nor our uncircumcision but Faith which
[1:08:06] worketh by love amen so here we H the
[1:08:12] desire that God would have is how his
[1:08:16] intention his purpose is that we in
[1:08:18] ourselves would be operating in the
[1:08:21] confidence of the love of God of what
[1:08:24] God where he has ra raised us
[1:08:28] from amen where he took us from
[1:08:32] hallelujah what what he has done in our

[1:08:45] there's just I could start to tell you
[1:08:47] but it just don't seem like there's
[1:08:48] enough ink to be able to write it all
[1:08:50] out of what it means to me of what he's
[1:08:53] done for me my my life it it revolves
[1:08:56] around him hallu my desire is to please
[1:09:00] him
[1:09:02] amen what is that it's that that part
[1:09:05] that you look at you recognize in your
[1:09:08] life it's just something that you can't
[1:09:10] even put into
[1:09:14] words but you operate by that love of
[1:09:17] God
[1:09:19] hallelujah now brother bam would take
[1:09:21] you know in Ministry many services on
[1:09:24] that of love I I I don't know how many
[1:09:25] times I've went through them over and
[1:09:27] over and you know you just how the holy
[1:09:28] spirit will continue to Quicken many
[1:09:30] things to your heart but brother BR
[1:09:32] will'll talk about some some events that
[1:09:34] have taken place in his life he'll talk
[1:09:36] about that of the bull talk about that
[1:09:38] of the bees talk about the maniac in
[1:09:40] Oregon and just to just to speak or to
[1:09:43] express some of those things and brother
[1:09:45] R talks about how that that bull that
[1:09:47] was out there in that pasture now I want
[1:09:49] you just to catch this of how that when
[1:09:52] we look at it brother bam tail talks
[1:09:54] about that boy said a big gsy bull he
[1:09:56] said that bull he forgot that that bull
[1:09:58] had been had had been you know moved
[1:10:00] over to this other farm and brother
[1:10:02] Brandon walking you know and having to
[1:10:04] collect bills and things like that and
[1:10:06] walking up you know coming over the
[1:10:08] pastures and things but brother BR said
[1:10:09] what it was that time as a warden he
[1:10:11] needed to release some fish into a
[1:10:14] certain Stream So brother R you know he
[1:10:16] says I was even thinking about it I
[1:10:18] unbuckled my belt or you know the the
[1:10:20] the gun and I left the gun on the seat
[1:10:22] of the truck and he said I went over I
[1:10:24] just went on him into that pasture I was
[1:10:26] going over there to put those fish in
[1:10:28] the Stream and he said about that time
[1:10:30] after I got to a certain spot in there
[1:10:33] he said all of a sudden this big old
[1:10:35] bull stood up now brother R tells us
[1:10:37] that bull had just killed a man the
[1:10:39] caretaker of the bull had been killed by
[1:10:42] that same Bull and brother BR says
[1:10:44] immediately at that time now notice what
[1:10:46] he did he said the very first thing that
[1:10:48] he did he reached for his gun well what
[1:10:52] was that gun that was his security MH
[1:10:55] are you with me now he wed for that gun
[1:10:58] but he realized oh my I left it back
[1:11:02] there on the seat now brother B told us
[1:11:04] if he said if i' had that gun at that
[1:11:05] time think of this now if I had that gun
[1:11:08] he said I'd have shot that
[1:11:10] bull wow if I'd had that but see God
[1:11:14] seemed to it that he didn't have that
[1:11:16] gun and brother brandom now coming into
[1:11:19] this place he realizes there's nothing I
[1:11:21] can do there's no trees to run to
[1:11:23] there's no way in the world I'll be able
[1:11:25] to run this bull where I'm at so in that
[1:11:27] time he begins to look to the Lord
[1:11:30] notice Lord if this has come my time to
[1:11:32] go I don't want to go as a coward I want
[1:11:35] to go and I want to stand here with a
[1:11:37] real bravery and strength in my life and
[1:11:40] brother B says how that he begin to say
[1:11:42] that he said I found myself this is
[1:11:45] something that's just an absolute
[1:11:46] Paradox I'm a witness of it I know I'm
[1:11:48] speaking to others as well brother BR
[1:11:50] said somehow or another I did not
[1:11:53] despise that bull
[1:11:56] Hallelujah somehow or another this was
[1:11:58] not Christian Science Mind Over Matter
[1:12:00] this is not what that was but it was a
[1:12:03] Son of God walking in fellowship with
[1:12:06] God he was not walking listen to me he
[1:12:09] wasn't walking in that pasture to try to
[1:12:11] prove and say my let me prove myself as
[1:12:14] a Son of God that is not how the storm
[1:12:16] went back that's not how the bees went
[1:12:18] back it was not a
[1:12:21] self-seeking adventure it was something
[1:12:24] that was on the behalf another purpose
[1:12:27] and a situation arose that would
[1:12:30] challenge to try to stop or hinder that
[1:12:33] purpose and then we find brother Bram
[1:12:36] said I find myself beginning to think
[1:12:38] different thoughts right oh that that
[1:12:41] bull I shouldn't have Disturbed that I
[1:12:43] didn't even think about that poor Bull
[1:12:45] and brother BR begins to think notice
[1:12:46] begins to think those thoughts he begins
[1:12:49] to think those thoughts he begins to uh
[1:12:52] speak and express you know to that bull
[1:12:54] now when you look at this you know many
[1:12:56] would say well that's crazy in the very
[1:12:58] beginning Adam could speak to the
[1:13:00] animals amen we didn't have it we didn't
[1:13:04] have it you know the lions and tigers
[1:13:06] they didn't have all those teeth like it

[1:13:10] eaters the fall brought a change yes
[1:13:13] amen is that right right when that of
[1:13:15] the Millennium sets in it'll bring about
[1:13:17] another change Hallelujah you won't be

[1:13:21] canines on them glory be to God this is
[1:13:25] what the peace of God does aren't you
[1:13:26] glad aren't you glad that it took out
[1:13:28] your teeth and gave you some good teeth
[1:13:31] Hallelujah woo Jesus notice is something
[1:13:35] that that happened here and brother R
[1:13:37] goes on to talk about he says now he
[1:13:39] says you know something took place and
[1:13:41] he says you know he says there's where
[1:13:43] the church is at because he talks about
[1:13:45] he said I wasn't no more afraid of that
[1:13:47] bull than nothing I wasn't afraid of
[1:13:49] that bull now listen he said I wasn't
[1:13:51] afraid of him he says you're always
[1:13:52] scared talking about the church that
[1:13:54] it's not going to happen that's the
[1:13:57] reason it don't

[1:14:15] feet out and he looked so
[1:14:20] depleted he looked this way and that way
[1:14:23] and he turned and went back around and
[1:14:25] laid down over there where he got up and
[1:14:27] I walked across the field and went out
[1:14:29] of the pasture he just laid down there
[1:14:31] and looked at me look it was love that
[1:14:34] took the fear away and God seen me
[1:14:39] through does Fear come fear comes but
[1:14:43] love is there to take it

[1:15:51] presence of him Hallelujah the fear had
[1:15:54] left
[1:15:56] amen sovereignty brother R didn't work
[1:15:58] this up it what was there already within
[1:16:02] him as a Son of God to create an
[1:16:05] atmosphere
[1:16:07] amen this is why when brother Brandon
[1:16:09] would stand there even on the platforms
[1:16:11] and many people would say aren't you
[1:16:13] afraid when this comes or that come that
[1:16:15] you know that that the that the angel of
[1:16:17] the Lord you know he won't be there are
[1:16:18] you afraid that you know he won't he
[1:16:20] won't come and brother BR said no he
[1:16:22] says he promised me amen right hey he
[1:16:25] promised me right this is why this is a
[1:16:28] a big big statement brother BR said I've
[1:16:30] been challenged by muhammadans I've been
[1:16:32] challenged by Buddha I've been
[1:16:33] challenged by all the rest of it but he
[1:16:35] says it like this he says I believe him
[1:16:37] I love him and the fear of failure has
[1:16:41] gone from me Hallelujah have you ever
[1:16:45] been around people you almost got to
[1:16:47] walk walk walk on the you know uh
[1:16:49] needles
[1:16:50] around do I say it just like this or do
[1:16:53] I say it just like that or what I say
[1:16:55] come on now there's some people that
[1:16:58] absolutely they could just make you feel
[1:17:03] uncomfortable they got every te Dot and
[1:17:06] every eye except that which is in
[1:17:10] humility right and it makes you
[1:17:12] uncomfortable right I mean it makes you
[1:17:15] uncomfortable because you realize
[1:17:16] everything that could be coming out how
[1:17:18] you say this and that and and everything
[1:17:20] else but you see when what what what
[1:17:22] relieves the fear of failure God told
[1:17:25] Joshua as I was with Moses amen Joshua
[1:17:31] had an example that he could look to in
[1:17:33] Moses and know that Moses would tell
[1:17:36] Joshua let my mistakes be stepping
[1:17:39] stones of God's grace for you he could
[1:17:41] see God's faithfulness that even when
[1:17:44] Moses made mistakes because there in his
[1:17:47] Humanity that God did not forsake Moses
[1:17:50] god did not forsake his promise but God
[1:17:54] was there operating through Moses life
[1:17:57] it was confidence that God was
[1:17:59] instilling into Joshua's
[1:18:04] life the fear of failure has gone from
[1:18:09] me
[1:18:11] right well what would bring fear of
[1:18:14] failure
[1:18:16] law this has got to be just right and
[1:18:18] this has got to be we believe that the
[1:18:20] word everything is to hit just right but
[1:18:22] we do not believe in creating an atmosph
[1:18:24] sphere of law or legal cuz you can hit
[1:18:27] you can hit everything the Pharisees hit
[1:18:30] everything and yet they miss the love of
[1:18:32] God they they failed to hit what was
[1:18:36] necessary is that
[1:18:39] right so the fear of failure has gone
[1:18:42] from me because I love him I trust him I
[1:18:46] believe him and I know he will oh my you
[1:18:49] know this this right here the fear of
[1:18:51] failure you know what it does it
[1:18:53] dismantles complexes right amen are you
[1:18:56] with me right it dismantles complexes
[1:19:00] let's just be fac it there ain't not one
[1:19:02] person here screaming one more oh I
[1:19:04] don't got no complexes yeah you do that
[1:19:06] right there is one of them it's not
[1:19:09] saying that we're sitting around you
[1:19:10] know holding hands in a big great group
[1:19:12] group steady and singing Kumbaya we all
[1:19:15] got complexes that's not what we're
[1:19:16] saying we're saying that there are
[1:19:18] things sometimes through experiences of
[1:19:20] life through things that have been said
[1:19:22] to us events that have happened that
[1:19:24] inadvertently we did not intend to
[1:19:26] develop a complex are you hearing me
[1:19:29] brother brandham did not intend to
[1:19:31] develop a
[1:19:32] complex amen but he
[1:19:35] did but God helped
[1:19:38] him helped him to overcome that
[1:19:44] complex that was a witness for you and I
[1:19:47] I said that was a witness for you and I
[1:19:49] that God just doesn't put us up on the
[1:19:51] Shelf events situations things happen in
[1:19:54] in life but notice it uncovers
[1:19:59] lies lies that we've been told come on
[1:20:02] now think about that woman in deep call
[1:20:04] to deep she's there standing on nervous
[1:20:06] some guy brother said professing to be a
[1:20:08] Divine healer that's right he you know
[1:20:11] what he's toal lie on you and it's got
[1:20:14] your whole church right amen you mean
[1:20:19] the power of the love of God can
[1:20:21] dismantle a lie that will affect my home
[1:20:24] life M he'll affect the rest of the
[1:20:28] church amen you see just as much as lies
[1:20:32] have power remember this world is under
[1:20:35] the power of a lie right now but you see
[1:20:39] when the Power of Love Has Come it
[1:20:42] breaks that whole it breaks fear it
[1:20:45] casts fear out and it establishes in the
[1:20:48] place that says I cannot fail because he
[1:20:51] can't
[1:20:52] fail you see this is why
[1:20:55] it behooves us in a time that's like
[1:20:57] this brother ramwood raise it it's time
[1:20:59] for us to pick up the weapon of love
[1:21:02] that our hero God's Great Hero left us
[1:21:05] it's timeing to dash out yonder fight
[1:21:08] against ignorance superstitions and
[1:21:10] formality and Break Down The Walls of
[1:21:12] the enemy and display the real Gallant
[1:21:15] love that we believe in God and His word
[1:21:18] till sickness is healed devils are
[1:21:21] routed blind see death hear God help me
[1:21:24] to to do it as long as I got breath in
[1:21:27] my body yes Amen in 2 Corinthians
[1:21:31] 5:14 the Bible says For the Love of
[1:21:34] Christ constraineth us because we thus
[1:21:39] judge that if one died for all then
[1:21:42] we're all dead right we were dead right
[1:21:46] walking but we were
[1:21:47] dead and that he died for all that they
[1:21:51] which live should not henceforth live
[1:21:56] unto
[1:21:57] themselves right see the love of God
[1:22:00] comes to Deliver Us from selfishness yes
[1:22:03] amen it's quite a paradox isn't it right
[1:22:06] that agape love comes and sets down in
[1:22:08] something that was brought forth
[1:22:10] contrary to Agape
[1:22:12] Love and God performs a paradox in our
[1:22:15] life that they which should not that
[1:22:17] they which live should not live
[1:22:19] henceforth unto themselves but unto him
[1:22:21] which died for them and rose again
[1:22:25] so it's a coming under the creative
[1:22:27] power of the word of God the atmosphere
[1:22:31] of the word are you hear me yes the
[1:22:33] atmosphere of the word just like inside
[1:22:36] of the Tabernacle there was there that
[1:22:39] shoe breed Mana that was the bread of
[1:22:42] his presence the bread of his face and
[1:22:45] it's the partaking of the bread of his
[1:22:47] face of his person it's partaking of him
[1:22:51] that's the shoe bread that belongs to us
[1:22:54] as Believers right
[1:22:56] amen you see it's what you're feeding on
[1:22:59] what you're looking at what you're being
[1:23:01] absorbed with will affect you yes amen
[1:23:05] are you with me now so now it comes to a
[1:23:08] place that then if we're feeding we're
[1:23:11] looking we're tuned into the right the
[1:23:14] right reality then coming under the
[1:23:16] anointing of that word then we're under
[1:23:19] the atmosphere of the person of Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ where Paul could say it's not I
[1:23:24] who liveth but Christ who lives in me
[1:23:27] this why brother R could talk about he
[1:23:29] said you've seen nice people now just go
[1:23:31] through all all throughout the message
[1:23:33] he said you've seen nice people he said
[1:23:35] but they're the kind of people he says
[1:23:36] that once you get around them they're
[1:23:38] nice nice people but you get around them
[1:23:40] he said you can't hardly stand to be
[1:23:41] around
[1:23:42] them right is your life worthy of the
[1:23:45] Gospel he said you shun them I mean you
[1:23:47] don't want to you here they come again
[1:23:48] why are they going to say this time and
[1:23:49] why are they going to do this time and
[1:23:51] and you recognize these are things and
[1:23:53] brother Brown tells us think about it
[1:23:54] how what a contrast they're a nice
[1:23:56] person but yet there's an atmosphere
[1:24:00] that is beneath that niceness that it
[1:24:03] generates an atmosphere that you just
[1:24:05] think man I I don't I don't even enjoy
[1:24:07] being around them and yet it's something
[1:24:08] that could move in you know moving in
[1:24:10] your heart you're think but yeah but you
[1:24:12] know I'm supposed to love everybody I'm
[1:24:13] supposed to love everybody loving
[1:24:15] everybody does not mean you having to
[1:24:17] try to prove something to the
[1:24:20] devil woo we could preach right here
[1:24:22] right now bless it's where you love it
[1:24:25] this is why you can tell a person say
[1:24:27] Well if you really love brother Joshua
[1:24:29] you go over and shake his hand you'll
[1:24:31] hug him around the neck that's real love
[1:24:32] that's emotion that is outward
[1:24:35] Expressions but if that's not from here
[1:24:37] it's not in truth amen the Bible said
[1:24:41] let us love indeed and in
[1:24:46] truth so it must be here truth right
[1:24:52] here
[1:24:57] now when you look at that this is why
[1:24:59] that when the love of God comes it
[1:25:01] really it brings a real experience
[1:25:03] within a person's life it changes you it
[1:25:06] changes your life brother BR says it
[1:25:08] makes the atmosphere around you
[1:25:11] different he said I've tried it I know
[1:25:14] it's the truth that man create in
[1:25:16] himself the atmosphere he lives in did
[1:25:19] you hear that man creates in himself the
[1:25:23] atmosph sphere he lives in amen as a man
[1:25:27] thinketh right in his heart so is he
[1:25:31] right but same I can't help them
[1:25:33] thoughts from coming that's true but you
[1:25:35] can cast them mountain right right give
[1:25:39] no place Amen to the devil amen is that
[1:25:43] right and if somehow something's got in
[1:25:46] there and start to Fester then let's
[1:25:48] pull down some strongholds hallelujah
[1:25:50] amen yes woo Lord
[1:25:55] now y'all didn't lose your amens did
[1:25:58] you I've tried it it's the truth that
[1:26:00] man created himself the atmosphere that
[1:26:04] he lives in Oh Brother Samuel if so and
[1:26:06] so no no that man creates in
[1:26:10] himself L tell me you just don't
[1:26:12] understand my boss my husband my wife
[1:26:14] that man creates in himself Satan's
[1:26:18] objective do you see why he wants to
[1:26:20] fight at you and me to get us out of
[1:26:22] that atmosphere do you see why tries to
[1:26:24] bombard our lives with all sorts of
[1:26:27] things situations come up even with the
[1:26:29] menial tasks of
[1:26:33] life that he'll try to bombard our minds
[1:26:36] and and drawing us out into that place
[1:26:39] why his objective if he knows if he can
[1:26:41] try to draw us out from under the
[1:26:43] presence of that shakana under the main
[1:26:46] influence where that Fellowship that
[1:26:48] Union with God if he can get us to where
[1:26:51] we're living beneath our privileges then
[1:26:54] in other situations and things that are
[1:26:57] going on around us begin to influence us
[1:26:59] and control us but let me tell you as a
[1:27:02] son and daughter of God you need to
[1:27:04] recognize God gave me this Authority he
[1:27:07] gave me this position I was not made to
[1:27:10] be subservient I was once a slave but I
[1:27:14] always was a son I've been delivered
[1:27:16] from slavery I refuse I refuse to be a
[1:27:21] slave again
[1:27:25] amen thank you

[1:29:48] between the dough the Dove and the crow
[1:29:50] their diet is different he said that's
[1:29:52] the way it is when when a man becomes
[1:29:54] born again there's something takes place
[1:29:56] within him that he's sick and tired of
[1:29:58] the world and there's a Godly Spirit

[1:31:58] Lord he maketh even his
[1:32:04] enemies to be at peace with him
[1:32:09] amen but I'm praying I'm reading and
[1:32:13] those things you you keep doing that
[1:32:14] that's wonderful right but what about
[1:32:17] here is there hostility in here is there
[1:32:20] animosity in here is there grievances in
[1:32:23] here
[1:32:25] here if there is listen this is not
[1:32:27] condemnation it's showing you where the
[1:32:29] enemy the enemy would like to try to
[1:32:31] pack that in to try to hinder the
[1:32:33] channel that you've been brought into
[1:32:36] amen that's Satan's desire to try to
[1:32:38] hand hinder that channel between you and
[1:32:41] God as a son and daughter of
[1:32:44] God this is where the Lord Jesus he said
[1:32:47] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:32:50] now you remember I I'm not going to try
[1:32:52] to read this all but you you can read it
[1:32:54] when you get home I just want to move
[1:32:56] move on Beyond it but in 2 Chronicles
[1:32:58] chapter 9 if you read that he deals with
[1:33:00] the Queen of Sheba she when she heard of
[1:33:02] the fame of Solomon she traveled right
[1:33:06] she came she risked her life she risked
[1:33:09] everything she came with a purpose if
[1:33:12] this is indeed what they have said that
[1:33:16] God has visited his people and put a
[1:33:18] gift among his people then if that is so
[1:33:21] I'm going to give everything I've got to
[1:33:23] for that the Bible said she came there
[1:33:26] and she saw not only the wisdom that God
[1:33:30] had given to Solomon but the Bible goes
[1:33:32] on to say the effect and remember real
[1:33:35] wisdom James said that comes from above
[1:33:37] is first pure right full of Mercy on and
[1:33:41] on and on and on and on she saw the
[1:33:43] wisdom of Solomon not just in
[1:33:45] discernment it wasn't just in
[1:33:47] discernment watch she could sit in a
[1:33:49] service and she saw the different
[1:33:51] discernment that was taking place she
[1:33:53] knew that was more than a man but then
[1:33:56] how that God would have it so recorded
[1:33:59] that she would actually turn and notice
[1:34:02] how the Servants of the house conducted
[1:34:05] themselves the Bible said she even
[1:34:07] noticed of how that they put the meat on
[1:34:10] the table right that's right she noticed
[1:34:13] little small details right you see what
[1:34:17] the wisdom of God did God's promise gift
[1:34:20] coming in it would be that of a man of
[1:34:22] rest it would come in what did it do it
[1:34:24] affected so much that of the Kingdom of
[1:34:27] Israel till they did not despise small
[1:34:29] things they took everything for granted
[1:34:32] they just didn't look and say my we've
[1:34:34] got Solomon here my what a great big
[1:34:36] wisdom no they recognized they came
[1:34:38] under their position it affected their
[1:34:40] life how they weren't the king they
[1:34:42] weren't the priest or this or that but
[1:34:44] maybe they were the ones that prepared
[1:34:46] the meat they were the ones that set the
[1:34:48] table they were the ones that set the
[1:34:50] meat on the table they took that respons
[1:34:53] possibility that was not about them it
[1:34:56] was about the Revelation that God had
[1:34:59] given them they did what they did as
[1:35:02] unto the Lord and it showed amen amen
[1:35:06] what was that the love of
[1:35:08] God when she saw how Solomon even
[1:35:11] ascended up the stairs she said there
[1:35:14] was no more Spirit left in me
[1:35:19] Hallelujah you see the actions that word
[1:35:23] displayed in had an effect upon the
[1:35:26] house of
[1:35:27] Israel this is why the Bible I love this
[1:35:29] scripture 2 Chronicles 9:23 all the
[1:35:32] kings of the earth sought the presence
[1:35:35] of
[1:35:36] Solomon to hear his wisdom that God had
[1:35:41] put in his
[1:35:42] heart sought to come into His presence
[1:35:46] why because they knew the presence of
[1:35:47] God was with
[1:35:50] him and they knew the words that was put
[1:35:52] in his heart God put him there what a
[1:35:58] trust oh my now think of this brother

[1:37:07] and say mey come over here in the name
[1:37:11] of Jesus Satan turn her

[1:39:15] dishes and she's still matter the

[1:39:38] may have to just stop on this one watch
[1:39:41] what brother Ram says if that can be
[1:39:44] done in the home it can be done in a
[1:39:47] church right it can be done in a nation
[1:39:51] it could be done in the whole world it's
[1:39:54] the atmosphere that
[1:39:58] counts
[1:40:02] God 1 John
[1:40:05] 3
[1:40:06] behold what manner that means consider
[1:40:10] the
[1:40:12] quality from what country the race the
[1:40:17] Kindred what
[1:40:19] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[1:40:25] upon
[1:40:26] us has given this is the word bestowed
[1:40:29] given to one what already belong to him
[1:40:32] right appointing him to an
[1:40:35] office I know the real reality if
[1:40:38] somebody comes back and says Father Here
[1:40:41] I am your son I'm coming back but the
[1:40:43] real prodal says I'm not worthy to be
[1:40:47] called Hallelujah your son
[1:40:51] amen if you say you'll be my servant
[1:40:54] I'll be your servant before I go back
[1:40:57] out
[1:40:59] there it's not us demanding of him but
[1:41:02] love moves down yes oh I love how
[1:41:05] brother Ram says he said the angel of
[1:41:07] the Lord went to the pig pin that night
[1:41:11] where that boy was at Hallelujah he
[1:41:14] stunk like a pig eating corn and
[1:41:17] everything the husk he would have ate
[1:41:18] the husk if they would have gave it to
[1:41:20] him he was hungry you let some might get
[1:41:23] hungry
[1:41:24] enough you let it come to a place to
[1:41:27] where where all the world and all these
[1:41:29] other Ambitions where you recognize it's
[1:41:31] nothing it's empty right that's right
[1:41:36] and the angel of the Lord it wasn't that
[1:41:38] boy that he could remember this from
[1:41:39] Sunday school or remember that it was
[1:41:41] the angel of the Lord that dealt with
[1:41:44] his heart amen and turned his heart
[1:41:47] around
[1:41:51] yes has bestowed upon us that we should
[1:41:55] be called the sons of God therefore the
[1:41:59] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:42:03] not
[1:42:05] right it didn't recognize him remember
[1:42:08] they they had the princes of this world
[1:42:11] recognized him they would not have
[1:42:14] crucified him right they didn't know who
[1:42:17] he was but yet it was the very
[1:42:20] manifestation of the word right amen
[1:42:24] they weren't able to discern that but
[1:42:26] here that little that little that little
[1:42:28] woman by the well there was something
[1:42:30] spiritual on the inside beneath all the
[1:42:32] darkness there was a spiritual part on
[1:42:34] the inside that could be awakened when
[1:42:37] the light of the promise Came Upon her
[1:42:39] amen it would scatter the darkness she
[1:42:42] didn't have to go you know and have you
[1:42:44] know find a church let me find a church
[1:42:46] a church on says 10 steps to be a good
[1:42:48] lady uh five steps on how to be you know
[1:42:51] a right kind of a lady no no she didn't
[1:42:52] have to do that
[1:42:54] no right right she just met Jesus amen
[1:42:59] amen she met one of her kind right
[1:43:05] beloved can I have just a few more
[1:43:07] moments I know you're a little lery
[1:43:09] about that Brother Sam you're a few
[1:43:10] moments just a few moments beloved now
[1:43:14] are we the sons of God it does not
[1:43:17] appear what we shall be but we know that
[1:43:21] when he shall appear we shall be like
[1:43:24] him for we shall see him as he
[1:43:28] is we've seen his appearing in our day
[1:43:32] am we've recognized and received the
[1:43:36] visitation of the Holy
[1:43:38] Ghost the love of our father bestowed
[1:43:41] upon us to be recognized as Sons and
[1:43:43] Daughters of God with the life of the
[1:43:45] Covenant flowing through US amen we
[1:43:49] shall see him are you with me amen why
[1:43:53] because we're looking for him amen we
[1:43:55] came to this service this morning
[1:43:56] looking for him am amen we get up in the
[1:44:00] morning we're looking for him oh he
[1:44:02] disappointed no he didn't disappoint me
[1:44:04] amen he comes we're looking for his
[1:44:07] coming amen hallelujah we're expecting
[1:44:10] him to come he comes in the form of his
[1:44:13] word he comes and ministers to our need
[1:44:15] we're looking and living for his coming
[1:44:19] amen we're not just waiting for the
[1:44:21] Corporal and all of a sudden a switch
[1:44:23] gets flipped no no we're looking amen
[1:44:26] for his
[1:44:30] coming this
[1:44:32] verse and every man that hath this hope
[1:44:36] in him do you have that expectation in
[1:44:38] you
[1:44:40] Hallelujah this is what it is every man
[1:44:43] that hath this hope in
[1:44:45] him
[1:44:47] purifieth
[1:44:48] himself even as he is pure
[1:44:54] this is
[1:44:56] why as God will speak to us guide us
[1:45:00] direct US minister to our heart because
[1:45:03] that Hope on the inside that expectation
[1:45:07] is for him we want to please him we want
[1:45:11] to walk in step with him and so he will
[1:45:14] come he'll correct us when we need
[1:45:17] correcting right and many of the times
[1:45:19] listen the correction itself this is
[1:45:20] where discernment comes in there's
[1:45:23] things where sometimes with discernment
[1:45:25] or correction it isn't altogether things
[1:45:27] coming out by word but it is actually
[1:45:29] sometimes that will be displayed through
[1:45:32] the lives of others God will display it
[1:45:36] the Bible Paul said these things were
[1:45:37] written for our
[1:45:39] amples
[1:45:40] discernment sometimes God might ask to
[1:45:43] you know borrow you and you might say if
[1:45:47] I was asking right here this morning hey
[1:45:50] anybody want to go out here on the lake
[1:45:52] today walk on the lake and manifest the
[1:45:54] glory of God by walking on a lake
[1:45:57] probably some people will say
[1:45:59] well long as I have a good windbreaker
[1:46:01] on
[1:46:02] today yeah man that that'd be wonderful
[1:46:05] but how many raise your hand and
[1:46:07] say when God said I want to display my
[1:46:09] my glory I'm going to have people spit
[1:46:12] on
[1:46:13] you talk bad about
[1:46:17] you I'm going to have sickness strike
[1:46:19] your
[1:46:21] body right
[1:46:23] goes goes on for
[1:46:25] months H how how how how many would want
[1:46:29] that no no no say Lord I I I take the
[1:46:32] first one walk walk on water Count Me In
[1:46:35] Jesus is that right that's where we
[1:46:38] would be right that's a truth for every
[1:46:40] one of us what is it the flesh the flesh
[1:46:44] part right but you see now when we look
[1:46:47] at this of how that the life would be
[1:46:50] displayed this is why that brother Bram
[1:46:51] just moving beyond this here and coming
[1:46:53] into a closing part this is why when he
[1:46:56] says when he expresses this in the
[1:46:58] message token he talks about even how we
[1:47:00] talk to our loved ones how we approach
[1:47:03] our homes he said apply it what's he
[1:47:06] talking about it the Holy Ghost the love
[1:47:10] of God he said apply it with such love
[1:47:13] remember what the Holy Ghost is it's the
[1:47:15] word of God right amen don't Sher Cod it
[1:47:19] right apply it with what such love well
[1:47:21] what does that mean does that mean it to
[1:47:23] have goop running off of it no love
[1:47:25] means the condition the confidence you
[1:47:28] have that what this word has done for me
[1:47:32] it'll do the same for them
[1:47:35] amen that's what's happened in our life
[1:47:37] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:47:41] am all that Christ was he poured into
[1:47:44] the church this is the confidence that
[1:47:47] we have and this is why he said apply it
[1:47:49] when you talk to that loved one apply it
[1:47:51] apply it apply it apply
[1:47:57] it this word in verse
[1:48:02] three purifieth
[1:48:06] himself this word means to make
[1:48:09] pure
[1:48:11] cleanse to offer as a
[1:48:14] burnt
[1:48:18] sacrifice even as he is pure so what
[1:48:21] degree of purifying
[1:48:23] even as he is pure right which is that
[1:48:26] which is chased modest Immaculate there
[1:48:28] pure from
[1:48:30] carnality it
[1:48:33] shows it shows there would arise a need
[1:48:37] to purify even though when you've been
[1:48:40] born again that's why Jesus said he that
[1:48:42] is was washed save not need wash yet his
[1:48:47] feet
[1:48:49] only right he that is clean is clean
[1:48:54] indeed but there's times we still need
[1:48:57] washing purifying amen right once my
[1:49:00] soul has been sealed remember that's the
[1:49:02] Perfection of God in his love has been
[1:49:04] perfected the desire to please him
[1:49:06] that's been perfected in us but there's
[1:49:09] still the part that can be
[1:49:11] sticky the part about us that can have
[1:49:14] certain Tendencies although we've been
[1:49:16] delivered from that nature but we have a
[1:49:21] source a source
[1:49:23] of
[1:49:24] purifying and you know that source of
[1:49:26] cleansing and you make yourself
[1:49:29] available as a Living
[1:49:32] Sacrifice you know what a Living
[1:49:34] Sacrifice because if something's dead
[1:49:36] right you know brother Brian you got to
[1:49:37] carry it around and just put it up there
[1:49:39] it's just dead weight God says I don't
[1:49:41] want you to be a dead and we have to die
[1:49:43] to ourselves but now once that life is
[1:49:45] inside of us I want you as a
[1:49:48] Living Sacrifice right where there's
[1:49:51] things that you're having to
[1:49:54] sacrifice Hallelujah your
[1:49:57] will
[1:50:01] sacrifice your feelings yes Lord hello
[1:50:05] amen even Grievances and offenses oh
[1:50:08] those things are terrible I said they're
[1:50:10] terrible every one of us there's been
[1:50:12] grievances come our way offenses and
[1:50:13] whatever more it's terrible right this
[1:50:16] is where we need the purifying amen this
[1:50:20] is where we need the purifying we need
[1:50:22] cleansing from our
[1:50:27] lives this is a real
[1:50:31] process where in evil thoughts are
[1:50:34] dismissed listen now like the prophet
[1:50:36] chose to think different thoughts in
[1:50:39] each of these situations coming back to
[1:50:41] the foundation remember when the maniac
[1:50:44] came on the stage brother brandham
[1:50:47] remember he was he's a pretty good boxer
[1:50:50] he said I sized him him
[1:50:54] up are you with
[1:50:57] me
[1:51:00] right but he said something happened
[1:51:05] Hallelujah brother BR just he goes on
[1:51:07] and tells in another place he said
[1:51:08] that's not something I did he did that
[1:51:11] right but how did God do it remember
[1:51:14] he's a gentleman right he won't Force
[1:51:16] his way in you know what that tells me
[1:51:18] there's a place that we can live
[1:51:21] Hallelujah so surrendered
[1:51:23] and in tune with
[1:51:25] God to where God's able to step on the
[1:51:27] scene because brother Brian sometimes I
[1:51:29] don't know if there's a bull going to
[1:51:30] step up right I don't know if a bull
[1:51:32] will stand up in this
[1:51:33] assembly true I don't know what I don't
[1:51:36] know what we will come along but if we
[1:51:39] can live in such a place in our homes
[1:51:42] and other places live in such a place
[1:51:45] where we are feasting on his
[1:51:48] word what will that word do it cleanses
[1:51:52] us amen sanctify them Father through Thy
[1:51:55] word Thy word is
[1:51:57] truth sometimes that's sanctifying here
[1:52:00] it comes that purifying
[1:52:04] says you you you're leaning a little bit
[1:52:07] too much this
[1:52:08] way you need to let that
[1:52:11] go are you with me right it's purifying
[1:52:15] evil thoughts will
[1:52:17] come thoughts could be thoughts of
[1:52:19] hatred thoughts of detest thoughts of
[1:52:21] the things can come right hello somebody
[1:52:26] amen this is why there's got to be a
[1:52:28] purifying because this God didn't get
[1:52:31] the Holy Ghost your spirit didn't get
[1:52:35] the Holy Ghost but you see when that
[1:52:37] comes that's why there's a governing
[1:52:40] power on the inside that says I don't
[1:52:42] want to feel that way I don't want that
[1:52:43] rainning there I don't want that raining
[1:52:45] there it's not down in your soul but in
[1:52:47] your soul is the love of God yield to
[1:52:51] that and allow God to step on the scene
[1:52:54] and he is there to govern
[1:52:58] that sure it might be something you've
[1:53:01] got to pray over maybe it be something
[1:53:03] months you've got to pray
[1:53:05] over but you know why God said I've got
[1:53:08] a child on Earth they'll pray months
[1:53:10] over this or this you know why because
[1:53:13] they value my presence
[1:53:15] Hallelujah they value you're not just
[1:53:17] going to accept it like well I just seem
[1:53:19] like I can't get this or when I see this
[1:53:21] one or when I see this or when I see
[1:53:23] that oh when I no God brings us to a
[1:53:25] place of purifying
[1:53:27] amen why so that that channel remains
[1:53:31] open what channel the channel so the
[1:53:34] sovereignty of God Amen can be reflected
[1:53:38] through a son and daughter of God Lord
[1:53:42] amen Jesus said I sanctify
[1:53:46] myself for their
[1:53:48] sakes what love amen he did what he did
[1:53:52] for
[1:53:54] us
[1:53:56] Lord if I have this feeling as the
[1:53:59] prophet said your attitude toward a
[1:54:01] brother can determine his
[1:54:04] destination Lord I sanctify myself amen
[1:54:09] if that is
[1:54:11] not is that's not going to be over there
[1:54:13] perfect love is what's going to be over
[1:54:14] there right that's right so if that's
[1:54:17] not going to be over there and we've
[1:54:19] received the spirit of that life in here
[1:54:23] then why would we allow the enemy to
[1:54:25] somehow tell us you've got to suffer
[1:54:27] with this and pack this around the rest
[1:54:29] of your life he's a liar that's right I
[1:54:32] said he's a liar what should I do lay
[1:54:34] aside every weight amen yes and every
[1:54:39] sin that does so easily beset us and let
[1:54:41] us run hallelujah
[1:54:45] amen lot of people a lot of things came
[1:54:47] in the way of the Lord Jesus they called
[1:54:49] him El above they did everything else
[1:54:51] brother br said even while he was going
[1:54:53] to the Cross he packed the cross and he
[1:54:55] said there was the devil saying can't be
[1:54:57] the Son of God it can't be the Son of
[1:54:59] God man look there ain't no way that's a
[1:55:00] Son of God look at him the blood spots
[1:55:03] them growing together a Son of God would
[1:55:05] never stand for that brother Bram says
[1:55:08] oh no he's saying a Son of God will put
[1:55:12] up when he knows he's in the purpose and
[1:55:15] the will of
[1:55:18] God you love him
[1:55:20] amen this is why Peter would say

[1:56:17] glad the word searches us out so that
[1:56:20] our lives would be a peer offering unto
[1:56:22] him amen so that that channel might be
[1:56:24] open between us and him that's
[1:56:26] Discerning the love of God in situations
[1:56:29] whether it's a bull no matter what it is
[1:56:31] let us discern the love of God we're
[1:56:35] here for a purpose he redeemed you and
[1:56:37] me for a purpose that we are co-workers
[1:56:41] with him in
[1:56:43] Redemption you know what a day takes in
[1:56:45] order to redeem
[1:56:47] somebody let's say what all of a sudden
[1:56:49] to redeem maybe it's you know me and
[1:56:50] brother Gabriel and and Paul Paul and
[1:56:52] here we are and man we're just right
[1:56:54] there just just us two but then I look
[1:56:56] out there and I see brother
[1:56:58] Joey now I've got a
[1:57:00] decision do I
[1:57:02] say he's not in this that's not
[1:57:06] Redemption No Redemption says I'll go
[1:57:09] where you're at I'm going come over to
[1:57:11] you but I'll go where you at and I'll
[1:57:13] bring you in to where we are that's what
[1:57:16] Redemption does yes come on now amen
[1:57:20] that's how even Redemption works and an
[1:57:22] eternal life it works that way even in
[1:57:24] assembly right thank you Lord where we
[1:57:26] no longer live our lives just about us
[1:57:29] amen amen what's convenient for us
[1:57:32] what's best for
[1:57:34] us that's not
[1:57:37] Redemption Redemption could take into
[1:57:39] account and say maybe that brother needs
[1:57:41] a
[1:57:42] card maybe that you know what may maybe
[1:57:45] they need reached out to maybe they
[1:57:47] hello right I said hello right that's
[1:57:50] true Redemption
[1:57:54] oh
[1:57:55] my this is why brother Brandon would say
[1:57:58] I I'm closing I know I asked you give me
[1:57:59] a little bit of
[1:58:02] time brother Bon says when Jesus came
[1:58:05] that day on
[1:58:07] Calvary he said he did not live for
[1:58:12] himself his life was spent for
[1:58:16] others remember that order because you
[1:58:19] could do everything in the world for oh
[1:58:21] I did all this for the job I did all
[1:58:23] this for the family I did all this oh I
[1:58:25] do all this for the church but if God's
[1:58:27] not first none of it
[1:58:31] matters hello somebody none of it
[1:58:35] matters it's God first amen and when
[1:58:38] God's first everything else will be
[1:58:39] ordered even nose come out of your mouth
[1:58:43] brother Brian you think you can do this
[1:58:45] like I got a lot going on right now
[1:58:47] brother Samuel not going to be able to
[1:58:48] do that right now
[1:58:50] no now it ain't no knew you understand
[1:58:54] right why everything revolves around my
[1:58:57] time with him right that's
[1:59:02] true when you say you go to church and
[1:59:04] do good things that's fine but when you
[1:59:07] live your life to yourself you haven't
[1:59:09] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:59:12] others it proved it when it come in the
[1:59:14] L Lamb of God he lived and had eternal
[1:59:17] life because he did not live for himself
[1:59:20] he lived for others and you receive
[1:59:22] eternal life by receiving that day and
[1:59:25] you don't live for yourself no more you
[1:59:27] live for others amen someone said how
[1:59:31] can you stand and let anybody call you
[1:59:33] such bad names you don't live for
[1:59:35] yourself you live for others that you
[1:59:38] might redeem that man you become Sons
[1:59:43] right that's the trouble of it is the
[1:59:46] church has forgot they were Sons you are
[1:59:50] Sons you're taking Christ CHR place your
[1:59:53] sons don't live for yourself live for
[1:59:56] others brother renom I can live for this
[1:59:59] brother because he sure is a nice
[2:00:01] man that's not it no live for that man
[2:00:06] who hates
[2:00:09] you I many to say
[2:00:11] Jesus help
[2:00:14] me live for that man who hates you live
[2:00:18] for the person who'd kill you if they
[2:00:21] could
[2:00:23] that's what they done to him they killed
[2:00:26] him and he died that he might save them
[2:00:31] oh my that's true wonder how many times
[2:00:33] brother banam had to die Hur hunting
[2:00:34] with
[2:00:35] birp just a
[2:00:37] thought
[2:00:39] right or when he stood
[2:00:43] there and the man who was a professed
[2:00:46] atheist said the problem I got with you
[2:00:48] preachers you're just barking up the
[2:00:51] wrong tree
[2:00:54] mhm now what if brother brandwood took
[2:00:56] offense to that
[2:00:58] right right hello amen you understand
[2:01:02] this was not what God demonstrated in
[2:01:05] this hour was not that we all would
[2:01:07] become Broms it wasn't brandom DNA that
[2:01:10] did this am this is the DNA of
[2:01:14] God this is the deity of God God sat
[2:01:18] down and took the form of a little Kyan
[2:01:22] amen God manifest his promise in this
[2:01:26] hour through that Veil called William
[2:01:28] Bram what did it do it got the attention
[2:01:31] of other Sons and Daughters of God to
[2:01:34] recognize that's part of the family tree
[2:01:38] that I'm a part of that same DNA is
[2:01:41] inside of me and
[2:01:43] you
[2:01:46] Hallelujah that's eternal life when you
[2:01:49] get that that's in your bosom you're
[2:01:51] facing heaven then you sacrifice your
[2:01:54] own things you give them up like the
[2:01:57] sheep gives its
[2:01:59] wool and you look towards
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:07] Calvary say Lord
[2:02:10] Jesus help us Lord
[2:02:13] amen help us to discern the love of God
[2:02:17] Amen
[2:02:20] Lord theist same how how do I
[2:02:23] discerned by the Holy
[2:02:28] Spirit remember the first messages as we
[2:02:31] started in and I had no idea God was
[2:02:33] going to take us on this
[2:02:36] pathway strong
[2:02:38] meat belongeth to them that are full age
[2:02:44] right who have their senses
[2:02:47] exercised to
[2:02:49] discern Good and Evil
[2:02:52] evil what brings
[2:02:55] discernment the word of
[2:02:57] God you see how it easy this is why the
[2:02:59] enemy wants to try to draw us out like
[2:03:01] he wanted to try to draw brother brandom
[2:03:03] out go ahead and stand with
[2:03:04] me that's why the maniac came the way he
[2:03:08] did that's why the bull that's why the
[2:03:10] bees when they came the way they did now
[2:03:12] think of what brother BR said listen
[2:03:13] what he said if I have known that Hornet
[2:03:16] was there ahead of time I'd have took
[2:03:17] care of
[2:03:18] it but he said I didn't even know it was
[2:03:20] there I've been in and out so much gone
[2:03:22] and preaching say Brother Sam what are
[2:03:24] you saying I'm telling you that you
[2:03:26] don't go and try to impersonate anything
[2:03:28] like that when the fellow that comes
[2:03:31] here and does all the treatments at the
[2:03:32] church to make sure pests don't get in
[2:03:34] here and he showed up the one day and
[2:03:36] said um Pastor um what door are you plan
[2:03:39] on going out I said well I'm going to go
[2:03:41] out that door right there when I leave
[2:03:42] he said well you might want to choose a
[2:03:44] different door I said why he said
[2:03:46] because he said there is a big old
[2:03:48] yellow jacket Nest that's under there
[2:03:50] then he proceeded to tell me he said
[2:03:52] they they're different from paper wasp
[2:03:54] he said they look a lot but the antenna
[2:03:55] and all this stuff like that that's
[2:03:56] different he said now I'm going to spray
[2:03:58] that thing I'm going to dust it when he
[2:03:59] got out and I said well I'll tell you
[2:04:01] what I said I'll leave when you're
[2:04:03] leaving so when you get done you let me
[2:04:05] know he comes here monthly I said so I
[2:04:08] walked out it was right underneath that
[2:04:11] steps now what if I have told him you
[2:04:13] know what we don't need that here we're
[2:04:17] Believers you know we had a prophet that
[2:04:20] you know there was a hornet nest
[2:04:22] man he told them Hornets to go back in
[2:04:25] he didn't know they were there he said
[2:04:28] if I had known they were there I would
[2:04:29] have already removed
[2:04:33] them but s what are you
[2:04:36] saying I'm saying that the the
[2:04:40] expression of this comes out not because
[2:04:44] we're out there to prove it it's because
[2:04:46] a need
[2:04:47] arises oh my I want to Brother s I just
[2:04:51] want to manifest that part as a son and
[2:04:53] daughter of God that love then God
[2:04:56] says the love between you and I yeah
[2:04:59] yeah then God lets tests and Trials come
[2:05:02] he's not worried about you and me but he
[2:05:05] lets that be displayed you see the test
[2:05:07] of trial the test of trial doesn't prove
[2:05:09] anything to God it molds and shapes us
[2:05:12] helps us to realize it's him that's in
[2:05:14] control and to recognize there's a
[2:05:16] greater hold on us than we even we could
[2:05:18] even
[2:05:19] fathom and then situ ations arise in our
[2:05:22] life and say Lord I Want More Love I
[2:05:25] want more patience he says okay then
[2:05:28] this is what has to come remember the
[2:05:31] virtues that are so sealed in our life
[2:05:34] by the spirit of God the virtues do not
[2:05:37] come out in times of
[2:05:40] peace they come out in times of
[2:05:45] adversity that's when Sons and Daughters
[2:05:47] of God
[2:05:49] Shine the brightest is is in the midst
[2:05:52] of these times say Lord help
[2:05:55] me you see if we keep the purpose
[2:05:58] brother Joe if we keep the purpose we
[2:06:00] keep our eyes set we're
[2:06:02] here till everyone comes
[2:06:05] in I got a quote right here this morning
[2:06:07] where brother brandham was talking about
[2:06:09] the president that's coming on and he
[2:06:12] says Lord he said we might be at a place
[2:06:14] that we were getting ready to change
[2:06:16] presidents he said may you he said as
[2:06:18] you anointed kings in the past may you
[2:06:20] anoint the man for the
[2:06:22] hour and here's the thing that it goes
[2:06:25] on to say with the objective that if you
[2:06:28] would give us that Grace for a little
[2:06:30] longer it's so that we might win all of
[2:06:33] the souls that are to be won for the
[2:06:37] kingdom of
[2:06:39] God if there ever was a time we could
[2:06:41] say that we see the two different
[2:06:44] Pathways is that right but you see
[2:06:47] what's the objective until the last one
[2:06:49] comes in that's the objective
[2:06:53] am see if we've got one
[2:06:55] purpose then sure when bowls rise up
[2:06:58] things stand up and offenses come things
[2:07:00] come in our life but if we've got it
[2:07:02] lined up and say Lord you help me Lord I
[2:07:04] don't know how I'm going to cross this
[2:07:06] pasture I don't know how to do this Lord
[2:07:07] I don't know how to get through
[2:07:09] this and you go to back to
[2:07:13] that it's not there I'm I'm used to
[2:07:17] acting this way in this time I'm used to
[2:07:19] and you're I left it no no no God seen
[2:07:23] to it you let it
[2:07:25] down hallelujah what was happening as
[2:07:28] you're feeding on the word you didn't
[2:07:29] realize brother Brian he's causing you
[2:07:31] to lay that gun right down on this seat
[2:07:33] things that maybe you normally brother
[2:07:35] Crest normally would have and you
[2:07:36] realized wait a minute wait a minute
[2:07:39] what's been happening the word has been
[2:07:41] molding you shaping you amen and let me
[2:07:44] tell you something he's prepared
[2:07:47] us brother William he's prepared us
[2:07:50] brother Shane he's prepared us for this
[2:07:52] moment that's right we've been placed
[2:07:55] here for such a time as
[2:08:00] this let's pray Heavenly
[2:08:06] Father help us
[2:08:08] Lord all throughout this assembly those
[2:08:13] streaming Lord you know every single
[2:08:16] need in the hearts of your
[2:08:19] children dear God I pray
[2:08:22] if there's one here that does not have
[2:08:24] has not received that love of God in the
[2:08:26] place of perfection where it comes down
[2:08:29] into their soul may they recognize that
[2:08:31] that's for them Lord may I pray this
[2:08:35] morning their faith have grown a little
[2:08:37] bit
[2:08:38] more Lord Jesus we know it's a sovereign
[2:08:42] work and Lord God may they just just
[2:08:45] simply just say Lord I Give Myself Lord
[2:08:48] I I I want I want all of me to be in the
[2:08:51] hands
[2:08:52] of you
[2:08:54] Lord I think of Lord how brother Bram
[2:08:57] talked about when he came back
[2:08:59] home Rebecca was a little taller than
[2:09:02] Sarah and he said
[2:09:04] Rebecca she came running in
[2:09:07] there she got a hold of her daddy she
[2:09:11] grabbed him around the neck and he said
[2:09:13] little Sarah she was so short she really
[2:09:15] couldn't run that fast but she was
[2:09:17] standing off there and he said Rebecca
[2:09:20] turned around and said
[2:09:23] Sarah I got all of daddy there's none
[2:09:26] for
[2:09:27] you and he said about that time he said
[2:09:30] I saw her little lip
[2:09:31] quiver and I motioned to her said come
[2:09:35] here
[2:09:36] honey Oh
[2:09:38] Glory little Sarah ran over
[2:09:42] there brother brandham reached down his
[2:09:46] arm like a father would pick up that
[2:09:48] child put him on the knee he had his arm
[2:09:51] complet complely around little
[2:09:53] Sarah and Sarah recognizing that she
[2:09:57] looked over at Rebecca he said Rebeca my
[2:10:01] sister you might have all of daddy but I
[2:10:06] want you to know that Daddy's got all of
[2:10:09] me Lord Jesus if there's one here this
[2:10:13] morning Lord God in their soul would be
[2:10:15] trembling like lips quivering Lord may
[2:10:18] they Lord heed to the beckoning call of
[2:10:22] the love of God and say Lord
[2:10:25] Jesus take all of me I want you to have
[2:10:28] all of me there's nothing that compares
[2:10:31] to you
[2:10:33] Lord I want the love of God to Soul fill
[2:10:37] every area of my
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:40] life Lord
[2:10:43] Jesus I look across this
[2:10:46] assembly I see different ones
[2:10:49] lord they're my elders
[2:10:52] I look at them Lord with such great
[2:10:54] respect and
[2:10:55] admiration I know the tests and trials
[2:10:58] just a little bit of test and trials
[2:10:59] that I've come through is in no
[2:11:01] comparison to the amount nor the
[2:11:03] magnitude that they've come through but
[2:11:06] I know the same
[2:11:08] grace that brought them through the same
[2:11:11] love of God that has burned in their
[2:11:13] hearts at times that they didn't know
[2:11:14] what to do when the bull might stand
[2:11:18] up different things would arise no no
[2:11:21] doubt I
[2:11:23] know they've had to purify
[2:11:27] themselves by having an
[2:11:32] access to a washing of Water by the
[2:11:36] word wash away
[2:11:39] grievances wash away offenses oh don't
[2:11:42] take it out of the memory but it's so
[2:11:45] puts it back into place because it takes
[2:11:48] the
[2:11:49] sting out of it
[2:11:52] Lord Jesus I pray right here or over on
[2:11:55] the internet this
[2:11:57] morning as hearts Lord are lifted up to
[2:12:00] you say Lord as a son and daughter of
[2:12:02] God I don't want the channel to be
[2:12:04] closed off I don't want to grieve the
[2:12:06] Holy
[2:12:07] Spirit I don't want to be shut off to
[2:12:10] where the life of the Covenant is not
[2:12:13] flowing in my life the way it ought to
[2:12:15] be I don't want to be cut off from
[2:12:18] fellowship but Lord help me I want to
[2:12:22] walk realizing offenses realizing
[2:12:24] situations realizing things that will
[2:12:27] come but

[2:12:33] vision let my focus be upon
[2:12:36] you let me think different thoughts let
[2:12:40] me give my brother and my sister the
[2:12:41] benefit of the
