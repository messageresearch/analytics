TRANSCRIPT
========================================
who will not leave me who will not forsake me I shall not be moved our trust has got to be in him Hebrews 13 8 says he's the same yesterday today and forever and he said again lo I Am with You alway even to the end the evening time preaching on preaching on it last night at the evening time I'll still be there I'll never leave you no matter what the boat is doing how much rocking and rolling they're doing or anything else I'll be with you be with you to the end time never leave you my what a comfort no matter what the boat is doing I'll be with you no matter what your mind is taking you through I'll be with you no matter the doubt that you're experiencing I'll be with you I would make it a a challenge to each one of you Believers tonight to remove every bit of doubt that you have in your life now it's not just Mind Over Matter but remove the doubt remove the doubt that he's not able remove the doubt that it's not for you remove the doubt that maybe this is the truth remove the doubt that you just happened stance in here remove the doubt that you're here by chance remove the doubt that it's for your sister or your brother remove all doubt and see how God comes on the scene when you're fully trusting in his word alone you're no longer hindered by what about or what if or if I do this or it's a circumstantial worship that way but if you remove the doubt it's God fully moving on your situation yes in such a way as in tomorrow when the Devil Comes against you like a flood recognize where your trust is your trust isn't not in your ability your trust is in him who said he'd be there your trust is in him that sweet dove that abides that sweet comforter that's there that sweet Redeemer that saved you I to think the struggles that we go through in this life and God saw Us Victorious he didn't he didn't see you I don't I don't believe the scripture says that he saw it a a ragtag bride that had torn garments that was just barely crawling their way through but he saw the bride who recognized I am bone of his bone yeah flesh of his flesh long time to speak over that we've got to change our language we've got to change what language we're speaking we've got to speak Jesus we've got to speak Authority we've got to speak over every Mountain that's in front of us to recognize that we are trusting in Him that's already overcoming Big Brother's here we're not waiting for him to come he's here yet a little while the world sees me no more yet ye shall see me the church the believer for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world what are we setting here for what are we even living for what are you trying for what's your efforts for what are you sweating it out for if it's any right at all it's either every bit right or none of it right remember it wasn't you or I or your pastors that made the promise it was Jesus made these promises I remember he said it what are we going through this struggle for if this word isn't true if his promises aren't true if his victory is not true we are living and I know we hear this but we are we are actually walking in the last work that God will do on this Earth it's coming to manifest itself through the hands of Believers just like you can I just share a quick testimony that comes to mind just uh last two Sundays ago I was down in Georgia preaching a a meeting in and uh uh uh the anointing of God came in that building and this I tell this testimony because maybe some of you are going through the same exact situation but this this elderly sister came up was the first one to come up for prayer and she said I've got a cancer and I call it out in the name of Jesus Christ that was her faith that did it I told her by Mark 16 we'll lay our hands on you will anoint you with oil and he's already promised that he would heal you you've just got to believe it and we entered into prayer with her and she began to contact the one who saved her she began to contact the one who she knew would heal her she began to shout out and rejoice and recognize there was a greater anointing there than a man or or just her or big brother in the back but there was an anointing there that could heal a cancer there was an anointing there that could that could eradicate a sickness she began to rejoice and and left out there and I in the prayer I told her I said if you believe by tomorrow this tumor will be gone well you know I wouldn't be telling you this story if I didn't already get the testimony back that next morning she testified that she was listening to a take uh on expectation and while she was listening to that tape she felt just the the the anointing of the Lord come down and brother ran him in the tape said now Sister you had a tumor I said had it's gone and she reached down for that tumor and it was totally gone see we're not living some past age but he's doing it right now through the hands of Believers like you through the faith of Believers like us what are we living this forth he's not a man of his word he will keep his promise he will show up on time later on she had uh sent me the whole testimony she'd been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer it got in her lymph nodes and lungs she went back three days later she already had a scheduled test and they said we cannot find the tumor we cannot find it we must order more scares it's totally gone she said I know it's gone because God came and healed me on Sunday that's the God we serve our trust is not in the doctor our trust is not a medicine it's in God who healeth all my diseases now if he could do that for a cancer in in if the time continues in 10 years 15 years she'll go on and pass from old age but what about the Eternal things that God is doing in his bride what about the holy ghost power that's still on the earth that's filling Hearts igniting Faith opening eyes opening ears recognizing the truth in our hour those Eternal things I put my trust in to testify of it we don't have to look back 60 years we're walking in God's miraculous age where he's working in in his bride it's him in her doing the Greater Works it's him and you that's going to resist that devil tomorrow it's him and you that's going to be able to deny every bit of doubt that comes into your mind it's him in you doing the Greater Works we've got to recognize where our trust is the man would say the only thing we have to do my ought to pay attention to that the only thing we have to do is wake up Shake ourselves call Jesus on the scene and father when you come on the scene speak that you are the same yesterday today and forever and let us know tonight that you're still in the boat you're still here you said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you and let it be known tonight Lord that I have told the truth no matter how many words I should say I still wouldn't be like you saying one thing just one word from you will mean more than anything any man could say we want you father come on the scene just enough that these people here can see that you're in the boat and I believe that every sinner will repent I believe that every backslider will Rush quickly to the altar I believe every sick person will be made well won't you grant it Lord we're calling on you come Jesus some will perish Lord some will die the Eternal death the separation from God if you don't come on the scene we perish Lord some of this had some some of them has forgot your great healing Miracles oh God move on the scene we're calling on you come and arouse our conscious Lord the spirit of Christ that's within us we pray through Jesus Christ's name amen come and arouse the conscience of the spirit of Christ that's already within us we've just got to wake up who's in the boat right the disciples were afraid they forgot who was in the boat we get afraid sometimes we get backed up in a corner we forget who's in the boat we forget what we believe we forget what our trust is in if this doesn't do anything else for us tonight you take these songs that I that I repeated back to you go back into and I think the brother was recording them down read those read those in the time of trouble my trust is in him at all times I shall not be moved he is my refuge in the day of trouble he is my stronghold in the time of Temptation I will put my trust in him at all times my goodness that will defeat the Devil in any circumstance that he comes against you in to know that your Authority is in the word you are anointed to speak this word in this age David was anointed to be king he wasn't worried about it he knew the hour would come that he would be king all right what about you you recognize the anointing power that's been placed on the bride in this age through this messenger you are anointed to overcome the devil that nobody else has been able to do but you this generation this age coming out of an age this age you will defeat him you will bind him in circumstance you will kick him into the Lake of Fire I think it's time to reverse the script on the devil and tell him who he's messing with I don't know who you think you're messing with tonight Della but you're not messing with just some kid on the Block I am a blood bot Blood Washed son or daughter of God and I will not be moved I know where my confidence lies I know who I put my trust in all times I will not be moved our trust is in him who's already working for us my to think he's already moved on the scene he's already ministered to us he's already brought the healing we just got to recognize it he's already brought the Holy Ghost we've just got to recognize this here he's already brought the quickening power to the word we've just got to open our eyes to see it's all ready here remember when John Ryan went through the prayer line and brother Branham told him you're healed and then he went off the he went off the stage and then you know he was a little troubled he couldn't see he said that man told me I was healed right so he marches back up there and he said you said I was healed I still can't see he said you are healed just go testify just go Testify the vision never lies I see you with Clear Vision you are healed just go testify it there is where we become Overcomers in between being told that we're Victorious and manifesting the Victorious word there he was two weeks later in a barber's chair telling everybody I'm I'm Healed I can see I can see and you can imagine they're just putting their hands in front of his eyes but all of a sudden his confession became a reality it's exactly like us like us in this generation looking to the Fulfillment of the word our confession is becoming a reality we have been preaching and we have been living these things for for years some of us our entire lives have been striving to fulfill this but now in this season under this anointing we are seeing the manifested word of God come to pass in our lives this is what we have waited for this is what we have prayed for what we've grown for what we've sacrificed for we've been obedient to the word to see the manifestation of this word in our life if not then what are we doing all right why are we here why are we living this somebody's gonna manifest it it's happening now I say get in the boat it's time it's not time to doubt it's not time to reason with it it's time to get all in surrender every doubt surrender everything that's holding you back get all in testify until it becomes manifested you know Brother Band it was like that for me when I claimed to have the Holy Ghost I was like Paul Ryan I believe that I got the commission of the Holy Ghost one night and it took it took months I was testifying I got it I got it I got it one day I was just by myself somewhere and that promise came to manifest because I'm an overcomer now what about you tonight are you an overcomer I believe you're already here showing the devil that he didn't have enough to stop you you didn't have enough to get you to stay home tonight you didn't have enough to get you to sound too tired to go I worked too hard today I dug too much dirt today he didn't have enough you are here and where he is there is Liberty I don't know what situation you're in tonight but there is Liberty here to get free from any circumstance say Lord I'm drawing the line I'm walking out of here Victorious I am sick and tired of the devil telling me how far I can go what I can attain what I can achieve I say it's time to flip the narrative on the devil listen here bub I don't know who you thought you picked a fight with but you picked a fight with the wrong guy I have authority within me because my trust is in him who has already defeated you they're on Calvary when you thought you beat him he defeated you there in the wilderness when you tempted him and you thought he you defeat him there he defeated you there was Joe when you thought you'd defeat him by the same things that took you out of Heaven job overcame you by the word of the Lord you recognize this it's the same anointing that job had you recognize this Faith it's the same faith that Peter had it's the same faith that Paul had you've lost every time you've came against this faith I say it's time to recognize who we are amen we are not packing some weak watered-down religion we are packing the living Pillar of Fire in this hour that will overcome every enemy in front of us it's a reality to me he's not forgot about you it's the never failing presence of Jehovah maybe it's been some time since you felt that presence you know a lot of times we'll go through these private battles and we'll we'll take burdens on ourself and nobody around us seemingly will know that we're packing this this heaviness you might get asked a question are you doing okay yeah yeah no you didn't have you don't have as much joy as you used to have to have Liberty like you used to have you know the prophet went through the same thing you got a burden on him and yet he was still going to church he was still preaching he was still praying for the sick people were still getting healed revivals were coming and going but he carried this burden with him all that while knowing within himself I'm just not I'm just not as joyful as I used to be but remember he says I said he was there in the wilderness remember he said a voice spoke out just as clear right out of them blue skies not a cloud it all been within just about just a little bit of time now remember just before this there was a big Mighty storm but the man would say the sun's always there is just beyond the clouds he says a voice spoke out just right out of them blue skies just a little bit of time and a voice spoke and said you remembered your promise didn't you I said yes Lord he said I'll remember mine too I'll never leave you nor forsake you and the burden left my heart it hasn't been there since and may it never again the burden left my heart as simple as remembering his promise now for brother Branham it was I'll never shoot a deer that I don't have a tag for and you might think that's a simple thing but how many promises have you made God and now there's a burden on you but it's as simple as remembering your promise and he'll remember his too I'll never leave you nor forsake you by the ramp said I saw that Pillar of Fire said to John his never failing presence as he said in John over there his never failing presence will never leave you he'll never leave you and Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore walk with God the doctor says you're going to die walk with God yeah the doctor says you can't well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you or forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world and he took an oath and by the Covenant that he get that he give you that he would confirm it just walk with God then you'll have your ups and downs don't worry you've got to go through Briar patches and over sharp rocks and over Bluffs down over hillsides up through mountains over Waters sound familiar Church but walk with God yes sir there's so many Hills to climb upward you've heard the old song but how little it'll seem when you get to the end of the way my mind just look at there all that's been look back at your Footprints it won't be very much he that endured he obtained the promise and he says and we know tonight the Morning Star is over us Banners are Gleaming the colors streaming and we're bound to win if we trust in him who will not fail us we stand to our feet tonight Church how could we but trust him he's never failed he's never left you forsaken he's never left you high dry he's never left you on the side of the road he's not going to leave you now but recognize who your trust is in oh my Hallelujah we're going to go through Briar patches go through some tough times where decisions need to be made and the hour we're living in there's a there's a heaviness it's a real tribe at this day and age that we're living in but we have a god no matter how thick the fog is we have a God no matter how it might seem you don't know which direction to turn we have a God our trust is in him we will not fail us I don't know if we know that song he made a way you know that one Brian hey we're encouraged tonight friends you shouldn't be discouraged you should be anchored know that God made a way but it didn't seem like there was a way yet you're here how many times have you said within yourself I'll not go back I'm gonna give up I'm gonna do my own thing I'm going to turn around and you're here tonight why because he made a way oh thank God Amen oh standing here [Music] not knowing how we'll get
