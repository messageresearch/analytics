[15:17] lord we ask it lord in the name of jesus
[15:20] christ
[15:20] for the glory of god amen
[15:23] amen let's go right into the word here
[15:26] to first corinthians 13
[15:27] 4. and uh
[15:34] certainly i want to say those of you
[15:36] that
[15:38] streaming by the internet we certainly
[15:40] appreciate your patience
[15:41] uh with everything at times
[15:44] the way things sometimes the way things
[15:47] go um
[15:49] one of the great blessings about heaven
[15:51] will be there'll be no technology
[15:54] that's a small thing but you know
[15:56] technology is a good thing but it's a
[15:59] it's something else when you're trying
[16:00] to get it and trying to work with it so
[16:02] um and i'm about as ignorant as ignorant
[16:05] can be except when it comes to
[16:07] studying in certain programs and
[16:08] everything else so i was trying to get
[16:10] that back there and ben was working with
[16:12] it so
[16:13] i just appreciate your patience with us
[16:15] and
[16:17] we just want to turn our hearts to the
[16:18] word of the lord tonight and
[16:20] just invite him that you come and just
[16:22] speak to us
[16:24] you want to look here in this scripture
[16:26] here again
[16:28] in first corinthians 13 verse 4.
[16:32] the bible says charity suffereth long
[16:35] and is kind charity envieth not
[16:39] charity vaunteth not itself and is not
[16:43] puffed up i'd like to look at that
[16:47] that verb that part right there in the
[16:49] middle of it if we
[16:50] we could here this evening where charity
[16:53] vaunted
[16:54] not itself you notice how paul he starts
[16:57] out writing with
[16:58] what some of the attributes that would
[17:00] be of
[17:01] charity but then here even in the middle
[17:04] of this verse he'll switch over to some
[17:06] things
[17:07] that are not attributes
[17:10] of charity and one of these is wanted
[17:14] not itself to be boastful to brag
[17:18] to glory in oneself that's not charity
[17:23] so may god bless his word and bless you
[17:25] as you're being seated
[17:27] the amplified bible would pick it up in
[17:29] this way in that particular portion
[17:31] without reading the whole verse
[17:33] would say it's not boastful or vain
[17:36] glorious vainglorious meaning
[17:38] that which is empty glory
[17:42] the word vantif here is it deals comes
[17:45] from the very word that needs to be
[17:47] a braggart and i don't i think that
[17:49] those are things sometimes that we
[17:52] to brag to be a braggart is one who
[17:54] brags and sometimes those are things
[17:56] that
[17:57] it's just something about it you don't
[17:59] have to have real
[18:00] sharp discernment to kind of pick that
[18:02] up and sometimes there's things that can
[18:04] kind of just go to a certain level
[18:07] and you know there's a lot of phrases
[18:09] that you know maybe you heard of and
[18:10] maybe you don't i know they're not just
[18:12] southern phrases i know i just didn't
[18:13] hear my mom say him
[18:15] but you've heard the things where people
[18:16] say you sound like you're tooting
[18:18] your own horn and you know these are
[18:21] things you know that
[18:23] you know there's a lot of phrases that
[18:24] go along with it
[18:26] but it deals with you know where a
[18:29] person would actually
[18:30] uh to vaunt oneself is to really to
[18:33] express
[18:34] things whether by words sometimes it's
[18:37] not even
[18:38] in words it's the way maybe the material
[18:41] of things you know brother brown would
[18:42] tell us over and over
[18:44] from that time he was in the museum and
[18:45] then he keeps using that
[18:47] example throughout the message and he
[18:50] brings it to a place of how they
[18:52] displayed
[18:53] that even a person i believe they were
[18:55] six six foot or maybe they were five
[18:56] foot ten
[18:57] i don't know uh but about 150
[19:00] or so pounds and when you boil it all
[19:03] down
[19:03] they're only they're only worth 84 cents
[19:06] brother graham said enough whitewash
[19:08] to sprinkle a bird's nest so it's not
[19:12] very much and brother adam said you know
[19:14] here were some men that were standing
[19:15] behind him
[19:16] and you know he said they were kind of
[19:17] you know flexing and everything else
[19:19] that they were doing
[19:20] he said brother adam told him he said
[19:22] now that it says it's no
[19:24] that that our bodies it's not worth more
[19:27] than 84 cents he said but the soul in
[19:29] there
[19:30] is worth more than 10 000 worlds
[19:32] [Music]
[19:33] and that's what that's what god came to
[19:36] redeem that's what we've been looking at
[19:38] on sundays that's the part
[19:39] that god came to redeem and through that
[19:41] redemption that leads us back into
[19:44] the redemption of the body and truly
[19:46] there's things that when we can always
[19:48] have before us i believe it's god's
[19:50] desire that we always have it before us
[19:52] never forget
[19:53] where he brought us from you know he
[19:55] remember told israel before they ever
[19:57] went into the land he told them
[19:59] you know let them know there's going to
[20:00] be things that you will prosper and
[20:03] these things when your hands have been
[20:04] able to cultivate this and gather this
[20:07] and gather that but he said beware
[20:09] lest thou forget that that it is the
[20:12] lord thy god that it calls thee
[20:14] to get these things and to recognize
[20:17] that any blessing that we would have and
[20:19] i think that
[20:20] for believers when we look at blessings
[20:23] we
[20:23] we certainly we can appreciate material
[20:26] things
[20:26] but we don't but the greatest blessing
[20:29] and what we
[20:30] we afford is the blessing of god is the
[20:33] blessing
[20:34] of his own life in our soul
[20:37] because with that right there you know
[20:39] it really doesn't matter we can have a
[20:41] lot of
[20:41] even ambitions for our children and a
[20:43] lot of other ambitions but
[20:45] i say it like this if there's one thing
[20:48] that we
[20:49] should have and i believe that we would
[20:51] have and that's
[20:52] that that each and every one would know
[20:54] the lord jesus christ
[20:56] because once a soul has met the lord
[20:58] jesus christ they got the best guide of
[21:00] their life
[21:02] they've got one who will stick with them
[21:05] closer than a brother
[21:07] they've got one that when father and
[21:09] mother will
[21:10] you know go by the wayside i the lord
[21:13] will take them up
[21:14] we've got one who's faithful so much
[21:16] that brother branham when he would speak
[21:18] about
[21:18] even of the trophies that god had
[21:21] allowed him to have
[21:22] uh fishing and hunting and things like
[21:24] that you'll find brother branham in the
[21:26] message of god and brother branham will
[21:28] say
[21:28] he said i couldn't have done that
[21:30] without him he said any trophy that i
[21:33] have he said it's because that
[21:34] he gave it to me so brother branham you
[21:37] know you hear
[21:38] when you would hear a talk of different
[21:39] ones and brother branham was quite a
[21:41] marksman and quite a shooter and
[21:43] different things and even some insights
[21:45] that you would hear but
[21:46] even within all of that brother bannon
[21:48] himself he
[21:49] he did not really he did not rest it or
[21:52] put it
[21:53] to his ability that i'm a good shot and
[21:55] i'm this or i'm that
[21:57] but he winds it all up in that it's god
[22:00] that has provided
[22:01] it's god that's made away it's god that
[22:03] has given these things
[22:05] to me and i i believe that with all my
[22:08] heart that god
[22:10] you know with these things when we look
[22:12] at it you know
[22:13] there's some things in our life if i can
[22:15] just break it over in this regards
[22:18] there's times in our life of things that
[22:20] you come in contact with
[22:22] where you need to be able to have
[22:26] confidence in the abilities you have
[22:28] there there's a part where
[22:30] you recognize the abilities that god has
[22:33] given you
[22:34] but your confidence does not rest in
[22:36] those abilities or even
[22:38] the accolades or whatever has been able
[22:40] to be achieved
[22:41] you recognize this is a god-given
[22:43] ability
[22:44] and i'm trusting on god and it's god
[22:47] who's been able
[22:48] to work through me let me just bring it
[22:50] simple when you go in for a job
[22:52] interview
[22:53] people of the world are not going to
[22:54] understand when you say i wouldn't even
[22:56] be here if it wasn't for the lord
[22:58] i can't do nothing if it's not for god
[23:00] but what's important is
[23:02] it's not so much that that's said right
[23:03] here it's important that that
[23:05] is the characteristic of our heart
[23:08] because when that comes out in that
[23:10] manner
[23:11] whatever is said when you have to be
[23:12] able to relate whatever's on your resume
[23:15] or whatever the abilities that god has
[23:17] given you
[23:18] there's a spirit of humility that comes
[23:20] with it
[23:21] that witness is there even in that hour
[23:23] that even the people of the world
[23:25] can pick it up and say this guy's not
[23:28] tooting his own horn
[23:29] this guy's not you know blowing his own
[23:31] trumpet this guy's you know not not
[23:33] trying to lift himself up
[23:35] it's things that people are able to pick
[23:37] up
[23:38] that the that what is even behind the
[23:41] words
[23:42] and i think that when we would look at
[23:44] this we understand that there are
[23:46] times that we you know would come into
[23:49] it
[23:50] in in our lives and paul if i could just
[23:53] start it in this manner
[23:54] paul would pick it up in philippians
[23:57] chapter 2 the beginning of those verses
[23:59] where he would admonish our the the
[24:02] believing
[24:03] church of the living god that if there's
[24:06] any consolation
[24:07] in christ if any comfort of love
[24:10] if any fellowship of the spirit if any
[24:12] bowels and mercies
[24:14] fulfill ye my joy
[24:18] that you be like-minded having the same
[24:21] love being of one accord of one mind
[24:25] and let nothing notice where he goes
[24:27] with this let
[24:28] nothing be done through strife
[24:32] or vain glory so when the scripture says
[24:36] let it not be done this way there's a
[24:39] reality
[24:40] that that always lays there present
[24:43] yes but it must be brought in
[24:46] subjection let nothing be done through
[24:50] strife or vainglory we're trying to put
[24:54] oneself
[24:55] forward but rather in loneliness of mind
[24:59] esteem each each each uh each esteem
[25:02] other better than themselves this is the
[25:04] very character
[25:06] of jesus christ this god's very nature
[25:09] that is on display
[25:10] this is where the word is admonishing us
[25:13] in these scriptures for unity and in
[25:16] order to really see god move
[25:18] it requires unity and you know anything
[25:21] for unity when
[25:22] we come together in unity we all at
[25:25] different times we have our thoughts
[25:27] about something or our
[25:28] opinions or our feelings but in order
[25:31] for there to be unity
[25:33] it requires us to be able to lay those
[25:35] things aside
[25:37] and assemble for one purpose and there's
[25:39] one objective
[25:41] there's one goal that we have as a
[25:43] believer as
[25:44] even a body and that is to see the lord
[25:47] jesus christ
[25:48] glorified in our midst
[25:52] we might come into a service and it
[25:54] might seem like the text that's being
[25:56] taken
[25:57] this doesn't seem like this is going to
[25:58] apply to my need
[26:00] we've got a choice in that hour and then
[26:03] that moment
[26:03] either we can say hey we need to be
[26:06] about my mountain or we can say
[26:08] hey it's time to take your mountain
[26:10] tonight let's go get it
[26:12] we've got an opportunity right here when
[26:14] we come together
[26:15] we recognize that we're not here with
[26:18] pitchforks to pitch the word somewhere
[26:20] else
[26:21] but we always want to have a heart of
[26:23] humility
[26:24] that god is ever present to deal with
[26:27] our lives
[26:28] and that our lives would be molded and
[26:30] shaped that
[26:31] out of our lives it might come forth a
[26:34] greater consecration
[26:35] a more surrendered life we're more aware
[26:38] and we're more sensitive to the things
[26:41] that are around us we're also more aware
[26:44] of our weaknesses
[26:45] but we're also more aware of the god who
[26:48] is in us
[26:49] that's greater than every weakness
[26:53] you know paul was an apostle which we
[26:55] know that
[26:56] paul was also he was a prophet he was a
[26:59] messenger he would
[27:00] he would uh you know mention there even
[27:04] as i'm a minister uh uh uh
[27:07] to the circumstance or jesus christ was
[27:09] a minister to the circumcision
[27:11] but he would speak of how that god he
[27:13] knew his position
[27:14] in christ and what that position was
[27:17] that the gentiles the offering up as he
[27:19] said
[27:20] it might be sanctified by the holy ghost
[27:23] that that the gentiles themselves would
[27:26] be received by god
[27:28] and it would be by the work of the holy
[27:31] spirit
[27:31] so paul when he would would set this
[27:34] forth he was not only apostle
[27:36] he was a prophet he was a brother to to
[27:39] the body of jesus christ
[27:41] but he was also a realist as well
[27:45] amen paul was one that paul could he
[27:48] laid it out
[27:49] of the real redeeming work and the real
[27:53] plan of god in the election of god we
[27:56] find peter peter would
[27:58] would write of the of the election of
[28:00] god that was not a stumbling stone
[28:02] in the early church that was a
[28:05] foundation
[28:06] principle of the election of the
[28:08] foreknowledge of almighty god
[28:10] and how that the holy spirit comes to
[28:13] seek out
[28:14] and to bring in for redemption
[28:17] that which always belonged to god so
[28:20] paul being with that paul was able to
[28:23] set it forth
[28:24] where he would be even as i could say it
[28:27] tonight
[28:27] a realist where paul would even speak of
[28:30] his own self
[28:31] in romans 7 18 and say for i know
[28:34] that in me that is in my flesh
[28:37] dwelleth no good thing for to will is
[28:41] present with me
[28:42] but how to perform that which is good i
[28:45] find not
[28:46] paul was aware that every day at
[28:49] every moment he packed his enemy with
[28:52] him
[28:53] even though as paul would describe it
[28:56] that we have been redeemed from the body
[29:00] of of the sins of the flesh wherein that
[29:04] that old nature has
[29:05] passed away and now that new nature
[29:08] is set forth but yet it is a new
[29:12] creation in the same old temple
[29:15] and paul could go on and speak of this
[29:18] in galatians 5 24
[29:20] it wasn't a daunting paul wasn't afraid
[29:22] of this but paul was posting the church
[29:25] to realize and to where this is our
[29:29] responsibility when paul would say let
[29:32] every man know
[29:33] how to possess his vessel in
[29:35] sanctification and honor
[29:36] i don't know about you but i look much
[29:38] deeper than a person
[29:40] or maybe a brother you know being weak
[29:42] and you know his head not being turned
[29:43] and look much deeper than that
[29:45] this right here comes into the same
[29:47] place where peter says
[29:49] let us sanctify the lord always in our
[29:51] heart that we might be able to give
[29:54] reason or answer of the hope that lies
[29:57] within us
[29:57] in other words bringing it down for our
[29:59] lives we
[30:00] always want to be available as an
[30:04] instrument that he can use at any
[30:07] [Applause]
[30:09] you know when they do a surgery uh you
[30:12] know i haven't i haven't been in many of
[30:14] those things at all
[30:15] but when they do it there are certain
[30:17] tools that's there but they may not use
[30:19] every single tool but there's tools that
[30:22] are available
[30:23] even when all of our sons were born on
[30:26] certain floors
[30:27] there were many tools that were
[30:29] associated
[30:30] with the birthing center it didn't mean
[30:33] they were going to use
[30:34] all those tools on one of our sons but
[30:36] they were there
[30:38] if they were needed and this is where
[30:41] our lives are to be available and lived
[30:44] in such a way
[30:45] to where it is a life that is sanctified
[30:49] unto the purpose and use of almighty god
[30:53] and you see these things that we're
[30:55] dealing with even with charity
[30:57] if any of the slightness of any vaunting
[31:00] or
[31:01] vainglory or boasting gets in there
[31:04] it hinders god from working how many
[31:07] times you hear brother brandon tell us
[31:09] he says once god will use a man he said
[31:12] he has a hard time
[31:13] finding a man that he can use and that
[31:16] man remaining humble
[31:18] because man gets to looking at and and
[31:21] they get to looking at
[31:22] what was done instead of realizing it's
[31:25] not
[31:26] the man that's doing it and even the
[31:29] ability to be able to yield
[31:31] it is god's grace that would even help
[31:34] you and i
[31:35] to yield to his uh desire and his
[31:39] purpose
[31:39] it's nothing that we can take any glory
[31:42] in
[31:45] i can tell you some of the services that
[31:48] would seem to be
[31:49] uh at times where maybe i have received
[31:52] uh the greatest or response from it
[31:55] it wouldn't be a service that i
[31:56] certainly would not count on saying
[31:59] i'm going to preach that one again i
[32:00] wouldn't think of it in that way
[32:02] i feel like i've just put together you
[32:04] know like shepherd's pie
[32:05] up here or something it just felt like
[32:07] it just come all over
[32:08] but god will do those things also he'll
[32:10] do it for me
[32:12] to keep me reminded that it's not you
[32:16] the gift is not you that gift i put in
[32:19] there
[32:20] for me to use you just get out of the
[32:22] way
[32:23] trust me
[32:26] so here's where paul would say and they
[32:29] that are christ
[32:30] bringing this this point they that are
[32:32] christ have
[32:33] crucified the flesh with the affections
[32:37] and the lust so what is still in the
[32:40] flesh
[32:40] but it's been crucified it's been
[32:43] brought into
[32:44] subjection who they that are
[32:48] christ where christ has established
[32:51] ownership and so if we
[32:55] live in the spirit let us also walk in
[32:57] the spirit
[32:58] notice let us not be desirous
[33:02] of vain glory provoking one another
[33:06] envying one another you see when the
[33:08] scripture when you read in ephesians
[33:10] galatians and so forth
[33:12] when you see that give no place to the
[33:14] devil you find in the book of romans
[33:16] romans 6
[33:17] let not sin therefore reign in your
[33:19] mortal bodies that you would obey it in
[33:21] the lust thereof
[33:22] it is giving to you and i an admonition
[33:25] because our walk with the lord
[33:27] is not just something that's on
[33:28] autopilot the holy ghost has come
[33:31] by the new birth to quicken that seed of
[33:34] god
[33:34] on the inside then as a son and daughter
[33:37] of god we stand there
[33:38] to reign and to rule and to be able
[33:41] to bring our flesh in subjection that
[33:44] when he might want to pull this way
[33:46] but because that we are christ we have
[33:49] crucified
[33:50] the affections and the lust of the flesh
[33:53] it can want to rise up but there's a
[33:55] greater power there's another king
[33:58] who is present that's king jesus
[34:02] there's another desire that permeates
[34:05] our
[34:06] life so not not to be desirous of vain
[34:08] glory
[34:09] we want we want to work in the harmony
[34:13] with the holy spirit because it's him
[34:17] that works in us according to his mighty
[34:19] power
[34:20] paul would write of this um also
[34:24] in an era in first corinthians 14
[34:27] and he would speak to the believers as
[34:29] they were coming together
[34:31] there in corinth and he would ask him
[34:33] how is it brethren
[34:35] when you come together every one of you
[34:38] have a song half a doctrine half a
[34:41] tongue
[34:42] half a revelation half an interpretation
[34:45] let all things be done unto edifying
[34:50] paul believed that the holy spirit
[34:53] should dominate
[34:54] the camp of the living god
[34:57] then it ought to be everyone is a
[35:00] participant
[35:01] in worship but just because you don't
[35:04] have a song tonight
[35:06] doesn't mean that you're not a
[35:07] participant
[35:09] just because it may not be your night to
[35:12] preach or to lead or
[35:13] sing a special doesn't mean you're not a
[35:15] participant
[35:16] we are worshipers let me just say this
[35:19] worship goes beyond these walls
[35:24] if the only worship is when we're here
[35:26] something's not right
[35:28] our lives ought to be a praise offering
[35:32] our lives are admonished that we would
[35:35] present
[35:35] our bodies as a living sacrifice
[35:39] that's ongoing that's daily that's
[35:42] moment from moment
[35:43] that is our reasonable service
[35:48] so here one you know they were coming
[35:51] together
[35:52] my goodness can you imagine poor song
[35:54] leaders in the church of corinth
[35:58] what are you i'm a master of ceremony
[36:01] oh you don't need song no i just called
[36:03] this brother he has a psalm this one has
[36:04] an
[36:05] interpretation this one has this and
[36:06] this one has this and this one has this
[36:08] and this one has that
[36:09] and this one has this
[36:12] was it really was it really
[36:16] what's that impression was that really
[36:18] god
[36:20] see this is where we it doesn't matter
[36:24] with everything it is to be checked
[36:27] by god
[36:31] i don't take anything for granted it's
[36:33] gotta be checked
[36:34] by god
[36:40] sometimes there's things that god can
[36:41] impress on a person's heart he don't
[36:43] want said he just wants you to be an
[36:45] example and live it
[36:48] edification is by the holy ghost
[36:51] it's not by great swelling words of a
[36:54] man
[36:55] you see this is where
[36:58] the inside man and we find this what was
[37:01] taking place here now we can
[37:03] you can deal with this scripture in a
[37:05] lot of ways you can have people that are
[37:07] dealing with
[37:08] complexes that they feel like i've got
[37:11] to do something
[37:12] i got to do this if i don't do this i'm
[37:15] not very spiritual
[37:16] no no no he that is spiritual is
[37:19] spirit-filled
[37:21] and he that is spirit filled heareth the
[37:23] words of god
[37:26] amen to be filled
[37:29] with his spirit so there was pressure
[37:33] if when you look at the scripture my was
[37:36] like
[37:37] the olympic games in the church of
[37:39] corinth maybe they didn't have pews
[37:41] maybe they had a field right here and
[37:43] they had bleachers all around
[37:46] you understand i'm being a little
[37:47] sarcastic it's okay paul did too in the
[37:50] scripture
[37:52] but you see what it was they were trying
[37:54] to outdo one another or
[37:55] maybe as the young people one-upping
[37:58] they were one-upping this person
[38:00] well i've got a psalm and who's got the
[38:02] best song tonight and
[38:03] who's got the they were doing it for the
[38:05] wrong reason
[38:06] first of all you don't have to have a
[38:08] psalm every time
[38:09] you don't have to have a revelation
[38:11] every time
[38:15] you just have to be available
[38:19] don't let the devil put stress on you
[38:22] just be simple be yielded to god
[38:26] god wants to use you he'll use you
[38:31] proverbs 27 2 let another man
[38:34] praise thee and not thine own mouth
[38:39] there's some funny stories but i won't
[38:40] tell them
[38:43] a stranger and not thine own
[38:47] lips
[38:53] now brother brown you a lot of you are
[38:55] familiar with this particular example in
[38:57] it
[38:57] brother branham tells it throughout the
[38:59] message in different places and
[39:01] i it always can't help but when i come
[39:03] across them listening
[39:04] uh i just kind of chuckle when i when i
[39:07] come across
[39:08] and i say that that's the truth you know
[39:10] what brother brown's talking about if he
[39:11] got done
[39:12] preaching at the tabernacle and you know
[39:16] brother neville had called him out to
[39:18] the platform
[39:19] and brother neville had now just given
[39:22] a wonderful introduction i heard brother
[39:25] branham say today you know regarding
[39:27] joseph uh brother joseph mats and mosaic
[39:30] came up to the microphone
[39:32] there when they were in saskatoon and he
[39:35] takes the microphone as hearing it this
[39:36] morning and he begins to talk
[39:38] just to get the people to realize what
[39:40] you're about to witness
[39:42] is a living god who's among us
[39:45] this is not just this is not just
[39:47] services
[39:48] it's a living god keeping his word
[39:51] brother brown comes up afterwards and he
[39:53] says
[39:54] well he says it'd be kind of hard to
[39:55] live up to those words
[39:57] he said he he says that because he loves
[39:59] me
[40:00] he said i love him too he said you know
[40:02] the swedes if they love you they love
[40:03] you
[40:05] see brother randomly just just you know
[40:07] to me there's a lot of things as we
[40:09] can see and can learn from that i tell
[40:12] you
[40:12] when you consider the ministry that god
[40:16] of the end time that god brought forth
[40:18] of malachi 4
[40:20] and the fulfillment of many other
[40:22] scriptures let me just tell you
[40:23] something
[40:24] that ministry itself could not have been
[40:28] entrusted to just anybody
[40:31] that's not building brother branham up
[40:33] it just goes to show us
[40:35] whom god had in mind when he spoke that
[40:38] that particular uh uh promise
[40:42] god already had william branham in mind
[40:44] amen
[40:46] but you know you listen to the
[40:47] supernatural series
[40:49] you listen to that that they that
[40:51] brother owen jerkisson put together
[40:53] the life stories let me just tell you
[40:55] something before
[40:56] the redeeming work of the holy spirit
[40:59] this was a man who wanted nothing to do
[41:01] with god
[41:03] he was ready to fight you if you're
[41:04] going to call him a preacher
[41:07] come on somebody this was one who
[41:10] was ready to fight this was one he
[41:13] didn't want to serve god
[41:14] we're talking about an individual who
[41:16] had been a proud person
[41:17] he had been hurt in his life were you
[41:20] talking about a man and a person that
[41:22] there could have been riddled with
[41:24] complexes but
[41:26] the grace of god came
[41:29] amen and you it isn't that brother
[41:33] himself didn't have the hat in the
[41:34] battle but the difference was is when
[41:37] the holy ghost has come
[41:38] the desire that pulsates in your heart
[41:41] is to please god
[41:43] and when you've made a mistake maybe you
[41:46] vomited or you kind of you know put
[41:48] yourself
[41:48] out there but the holy spirit within you
[41:51] will convict you and it brings it back
[41:54] along why
[41:55] because it's not us it's to be glorified
[41:59] it's him that's to be glorified it's him
[42:02] that was crucified
[42:04] it's him that was buried and rose again
[42:06] and ascended to the right hand
[42:11] glory be to god this is why when brother
[42:13] branham would talk about
[42:14] even in one of the the newspapers the
[42:17] magazines
[42:18] he said one thing he says i think he
[42:20] says when you read it
[42:21] he said one thing he says that they're
[42:23] doing it seems to be they're glorifying
[42:26] the man
[42:27] more than they're glorifying the god who
[42:29] worked through the man let me just say
[42:31] this to you
[42:32] when that comes in that manner like that
[42:35] the ministry even that god had
[42:37] in this last day there were many people
[42:39] that thought him to be jesus christ
[42:43] he wasn't but many people thought it why
[42:46] because you see the same manifestation
[42:50] that was there in the in the corporal
[42:52] body
[42:53] the earthly body of the lord jesus he
[42:55] was so close to where the prophet could
[42:58] stand there
[42:59] in false anointed ones think of this
[43:01] friends here is a man
[43:03] with one burden and one desire and he
[43:06] would ask the congregation
[43:08] three quarters of the way through
[43:10] anointed ones at the end time
[43:11] he said oh can you separate the two
[43:15] he said he says i am not the son of man
[43:19] but i am a son of man revealing the son
[43:22] of man
[43:23] i was not the one who performed
[43:26] those signs those wonders those miracles
[43:29] i just happened to be standing there
[43:33] when he came
[43:38] and the closing paragraph in the resume
[43:41] of the church ages
[43:42] not for one moment do i bring a message
[43:45] that people would follow me or to start
[43:48] a church
[43:49] but there's one purpose that i have is
[43:52] to
[43:52] see a real relationship between
[43:55] god and his people to where men and
[43:58] women
[43:59] become new creatures in christ jesus
[44:04] i'm telling you this message came with
[44:07] the motives of heaven
[44:09] [Applause]
[44:15] hallelujah
[44:20] praise the lord let me get back to this
[44:22] quote
[44:25] brother graham talks about this
[44:27] introduction that brother neville
[44:29] has given him he said why he said that's
[44:31] such a wonderful introduction it makes
[44:32] you feel better
[44:33] if you're feeling bad don't let this
[44:36] just be a quote
[44:41] he said now that would make you feel
[44:42] good just to know the people like you
[44:45] how many know the scriptures say god
[44:47] dwelleth right
[44:49] in the praises of his people
[44:54] how many know brother brandon tells us
[44:55] in corinthians book of corrections
[44:57] he said if the wife didn't every once in
[44:59] a while come by the husband
[45:01] and tell him how much he appreciated he
[45:04] would think
[45:04] something's wrong is that right
[45:08] it's vice versa it's the same way
[45:12] i mean if she ain't burning the biscuits
[45:13] i mean start praising it
[45:16] i mean if they're only slightly brown
[45:18] give some praise
[45:21] if the mashed potatoes are thicker and
[45:22] not soup i mean come on
[45:26] you understand what i'm saying you see
[45:29] brother adam
[45:30] these are things to me when i this is me
[45:32] when i look here at the message i don't
[45:34] just wait and say
[45:35] when can you get to the text i look at
[45:37] everything
[45:39] there's teaching that's in here there's
[45:41] an example
[45:43] amen hallelujah brother van talks about
[45:46] this is the one you'll remember
[45:48] brother brown's walking out of the
[45:49] tabernacle one night after preaching
[45:52] and this woman said oh brother bill that
[45:54] sure was a good message tonight
[45:57] brother said i said thank you sister it
[45:59] made me feel good you know
[46:02] sounds like he's a realist too you know
[46:05] he walked and there's a walk to the door
[46:06] and some fella some fellow was standing
[46:08] there
[46:09] said you know i wouldn't put up with
[46:10] that
[46:12] what but then i said what said i don't
[46:15] want nobody to brag on me or say
[46:17] something
[46:20] here's some words of wisdom there's just
[46:23] one difference brother branham said to
[46:24] that man between you and i
[46:26] i'm telling the truth i like it
[46:31] [Applause]
[46:38] i ain't trying to drop no big hints
[46:39] tonight it really
[46:42] makes anyone look what he said it really
[46:43] makes anyone someone
[46:45] tells you you appreciate it the efforts
[46:49] that you
[46:49] make it makes you feel a whole lot
[46:54] better
[46:56] i mean let's just be honest there's
[46:58] somebody could tell you that was really
[47:00] good
[47:01] but because of their testimony or
[47:04] their cur it don't mean as much
[47:08] as you take somebody else there's a
[47:10] testimony
[47:11] there's a character that's behind it
[47:14] one thing i cannot have told my wife
[47:16] over and over i said honey
[47:17] i said reason it means so much to me i
[47:20] said the things that she would say or
[47:22] when we're talking and things like that
[47:23] i said because i know your character
[47:26] and the life that you live for the lord
[47:28] jesus
[47:29] that's what makes it powerful to me
[47:35] you see this is where we learn a great
[47:37] lesson brother branham would you know
[47:39] take us of how christ praises his own
[47:44] and god does it at the right time you
[47:46] know there's just the right amount of
[47:48] praise brother brown tells us in the
[47:49] church age book he said he knows exactly
[47:52] how to encourage us in the right things
[47:54] and discourage us in the wrong things
[47:57] he's not interested in crushing us
[48:00] he knows how to encourage us in the
[48:02] right discourage us in the wrong
[48:04] and when it all comes down to it from
[48:07] children
[48:08] husband wife and so forth there's one
[48:11] place
[48:12] that our acceptance should be found
[48:16] my wife should not have to seek the
[48:17] acceptance from nobody else
[48:20] right here's where it stops starts right
[48:22] here stops right here
[48:24] it don't matter nobody else in the world
[48:26] likes her that means she's arrogant
[48:29] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
[48:32] so-and-so says
[48:33] maybe you should wear this color right
[48:36] that's right she runs by me
[48:41] same thing and we know how it was you
[48:43] know some of us when we were
[48:44] teenagers and things like that
[48:47] goodness it depends on who we are and
[48:49] how our makeup is
[48:51] sometimes the pressures out there is to
[48:54] kind of fit in
[48:55] well they have this and why don't i have
[48:56] this or this or that and we know those
[48:58] things are real we
[48:59] we don't say oh that shouldn't be that's
[49:01] natural it's parts and journeys of the
[49:04] life
[49:05] well what's important how do you combat
[49:07] that then we come back to the scriptural
[49:09] principle
[49:10] that even in our lives as believers how
[49:12] do we operate
[49:13] we have been made accepted in the
[49:17] beloved
[49:17] it's to let it be known there's one
[49:20] place that you're accepted
[49:21] it doesn't matter your gifts talents
[49:24] skills your failures your mistakes
[49:26] but you are accepted at home
[49:30] that doesn't mean we're condoning sin
[49:32] you understand what i mean
[49:33] i'm talking about there's got to be a
[49:35] basis that when
[49:37] everything else goes around this gets
[49:39] posted or
[49:40] that gets downer or they're this or
[49:42] they're that there is an
[49:43] acceptance that keeps them grounded
[49:47] that's what keeps you and i grounded
[49:49] when we really don't know what's going
[49:51] on
[49:51] or somebody says some or this test or
[49:53] this trial let me tell you what gives
[49:55] you a nice strength
[49:56] that we have been made accepted in the
[49:59] beloved
[50:01] i am my beloved he is mine
[50:06] [Music]
[50:07] proverbs 25 27 it is not good
[50:11] to eat much honey
[50:16] so for men to search their own glory
[50:19] it's not glory
[50:24] searching for somebody trying to drop
[50:26] that twig and try to start that fire and
[50:29] somebody will start bragging on them a
[50:31] little bit well i'm not vaunting myself
[50:33] but
[50:33] but you're you're trying to get it
[50:36] started
[50:37] come on now these are where
[50:40] these principles and what we're looking
[50:43] at
[50:44] is what as as the scripture said it's
[50:46] not good for a man to search
[50:48] out his own glory what we just read here
[50:50] before brother branham once seeking out
[50:52] his own glory
[50:55] i mean he didn't take a survey after the
[50:56] service and say how many of you were
[50:58] blessed
[50:59] how many of you were this how many of
[51:01] you are that right
[51:03] sometimes right after the service it
[51:05] might be all on one
[51:06] end but it's like that sergeant who
[51:09] keeps the troops at arm when it comes to
[51:11] war
[51:11] they'll appreciate it if they can
[51:15] recognize that it's for my good
[51:17] this is where the lord jesus we looked a
[51:19] little bit into this life but notice
[51:21] here here in his walk in his life
[51:24] as we looked at that last week he did
[51:26] not make himself of any reputation
[51:29] the scripture here is his testimony in
[51:32] john 8 50 and i seek
[51:35] not mine own glory
[51:40] they wanted him to go to lazarus he
[51:43] wouldn't go
[51:44] until the father told him to go
[51:48] as a matter of fact i may just kind of
[51:50] move with this
[51:51] but you know the scripture you're
[51:52] familiar with it you you're not only as
[51:54] a believer but you hear it here a lot
[51:56] john 5 19 this is his testimony the son
[52:00] can do nothing in himself
[52:05] but what he seeth the father doing that
[52:08] doeth the son likewise
[52:11] hallelujah this was the testimony of
[52:13] that harmony
[52:16] you see even when jesus was on the cross
[52:22] and here they stood there
[52:28] if you're him come down off the cross
[52:31] save thyself
[52:34] right he could have done it
[52:39] like who is it who was it was it dotty
[52:41] rambo that wrote that song he could have
[52:42] called
[52:43] ten thousand angels maybe i don't have
[52:47] the right person but you got the song
[52:51] paul raider would say they ain't the
[52:52] angels were filled
[52:54] in the bushes just one nod
[52:57] and they would have come
[53:02] but he he glorified not himself what did
[53:05] he do
[53:06] it was glorifying the word and in order
[53:09] for the word to be
[53:11] glorified it required the greatness
[53:14] of humility that he humbled himself
[53:17] even to the death of the cross
[53:20] [Music]
[53:21] which was the cruelest and the most and
[53:24] i want to just say
[53:25] inhumane but it was an embarrassing way
[53:29] to go
[53:34] completely but he submitted himself
[53:38] he was tempted and let me just tell you
[53:40] something
[53:42] his flesh was pulled
[53:50] he was made in the likeness of sinful
[53:52] flesh
[53:54] i referred that to you last week from
[53:55] how can i overcome in
[53:57] different places he was tempted to take
[53:59] the kingdom without suffering
[54:02] but calvary was because a victory was
[54:04] already won he wrestled it out
[54:08] there was a prevailing that took place
[54:09] you know sometimes before
[54:11] you meet even in situations that you you
[54:13] know you're coming into
[54:15] that are hard situations like this now
[54:17] it may not be a situation
[54:19] where you're facing a cross but it might
[54:21] be where you need to crucify
[54:23] the affections and the lust thereof
[54:25] where you might have to crucify
[54:27] your tongue your feelings your attitude
[54:29] come on now
[54:30] and so you've got to wrestle it out but
[54:32] lord they have done this
[54:34] and you're wrestling but nevertheless
[54:36] not my will
[54:37] thine will be done
[54:40] and here it comes again it comes again
[54:42] what's happening
[54:43] there's a prevailing of the power within
[54:46] you
[54:46] that desires to walk in obedience and
[54:49] submission to the word
[54:51] that god would receive the glory
[54:54] in all things
[54:57] glory be to god how great is our god
[55:01] this is why jesus could say in john 5 44
[55:05] how can you believe speaking to the
[55:06] pharisees
[55:09] my goodness you're talking about
[55:12] vaunting these guys
[55:15] is very much noted vaunted they were
[55:19] very much boastful
[55:21] these guys even prayed in a certain way
[55:24] they can't see me out here oh that's
[55:26] good view they can see me
[55:30] you know that's scripture
[55:35] all right let me see how my face oh i
[55:38] need to look
[55:38] i need to look like i've been fasting
[55:43] there's more people that over there let
[55:45] me go over and see all them people
[55:52] come on now there's one person you need
[55:54] to make sure you get attention from
[55:56] and he's willing to give you attention
[55:58] that's jesus
[56:00] he ain't never too busy
[56:04] hey man he don't ever have to say i need
[56:06] a little bit of rest you just go play a
[56:08] little bit
[56:08] nope he never slumbers nor sleep
[56:13] he's always ready to give you a little
[56:14] bit of tension
[56:17] that was free
[56:20] how can you believe notice what he said
[56:22] how can you believe which receive
[56:24] honor one of another
[56:28] these guys were like air pumps to one
[56:30] another
[56:31] honoring one another right
[56:35] this way it went about it wasn't about
[56:37] god
[56:38] it was about one another and they were
[56:41] receiving honor from one another
[56:43] that's what they were seeking after
[56:45] that's why jesus
[56:46] could speak to them they're hypocrites
[56:49] because they were seeking
[56:51] the honor of men more than the honor of
[56:57] our god is not of man amen
[57:02] our approvals of god amen
[57:08] listen i don't feel very well life he
[57:11] was despised and rejected
[57:15] but i can also tell you this right here
[57:18] that he that
[57:18] showeth himself friendly half friends
[57:23] my goodness where is this coming from
[57:28] and receive honor one from another and
[57:31] seek not the honor that coming from god
[57:34] only
[57:35] see that hinders faith that hinders
[57:38] faith
[57:39] when we when it's operated in that way
[57:42] this is why
[57:43] as jesus would say i can't in my own
[57:45] self do nothing in john 8 54
[57:48] he said if i honor myself my honor
[57:51] is nothing
[57:56] as we referred to you last week you
[57:58] remember from the scriptures
[58:00] these are things that over the years i
[58:03] remember
[58:04] you know you just look at it brother
[58:05] carlos where jesus would say
[58:07] he charged them tell no man
[58:11] over and over he charged him don't tell
[58:13] no man he didn't say
[58:15] now go spread this
[58:18] if you do that i'll get invited to more
[58:21] places
[58:23] come on now go spread this
[58:27] he charged him not to do that
[58:31] because listen to me the attention
[58:34] this was to be drawn to the god of glory
[58:38] that was revealing the glory of god
[58:41] through the son of god
[58:42] [Applause]
[58:44] let me just say this to you it's not you
[58:47] it's the god of glory revealing the
[58:50] glory of god
[58:52] through your life our lives are a
[58:55] reflection
[58:56] of his work
[59:00] this is why when brother brown referred
[59:02] to in this way of the lord jesus
[59:04] and the just countless we could go
[59:06] through scriptures he
[59:07] never claimed to be a great person
[59:12] and brother brahma said it like this he
[59:14] only bragged
[59:16] on god constantly
[59:19] it's not me that doeth the works
[59:23] it's the father that dwelleth in me he
[59:26] do it the worst that's the kind of
[59:29] bragging we want to do
[59:32] that's the kind of boasting we want to
[59:34] do
[59:35] where paul could say that i can do all
[59:38] things
[59:38] through christ who strengthens me
[59:42] amen you see this is why that even
[59:46] you know to think of this even you know
[59:48] what he likes for us to brag on him
[59:51] dwells in the praises of his people you
[59:53] see even while the word is going forth
[59:55] sometimes you'll watch how the holy
[59:57] spirit will take a service
[59:59] and let's just talk about just here in
[1:00:01] our own little local assembly
[1:00:03] you watch how the holy spirit will take
[1:00:04] a service and there's things that how
[1:00:06] that god will take it in such a way
[1:00:09] where here the holy spirit begins to
[1:00:11] come and begins to brag on the
[1:00:13] redemptive
[1:00:14] work of calvary begins to brag on the
[1:00:18] power
[1:00:19] of almighty god it begins to what's he
[1:00:22] doing he said if i be lifted up
[1:00:24] i will draw oh men unto me
[1:00:29] and he he loves to come and fulfill
[1:00:32] that word when you and i brag on him and
[1:00:35] we're bragging on him because we know
[1:00:36] what he is to us
[1:00:40] you can brag on him as a healer because
[1:00:42] he heals you
[1:00:43] you can bank on him as a deliverer
[1:00:45] because he delivers you
[1:00:46] you can brag on him as a savior because
[1:00:48] he saved you
[1:00:50] you can brag on him as a quickening
[1:00:51] spirit cause he quickens you
[1:00:55] you've got a right to brag on jesus
[1:01:01] hallelujah you're going to bragging on
[1:01:03] him
[1:01:06] he'll come you go to talking about him
[1:01:09] he'll come hallelujah
[1:01:13] go to talking about healing he'll come
[1:01:17] amen when he's bred dog he'll come
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:22] but where man is bragging on man or
[1:01:24] whatever mark
[1:01:25] he stays away from yeah because he can't
[1:01:28] do nothing there
[1:01:30] oh my you see this is why brother
[1:01:34] branham
[1:01:34] as he says in the message and when he
[1:01:37] says in the message
[1:01:38] token he said he said in
[1:01:41] my ministry he said jesus christ
[1:01:45] had more success in my ministry and
[1:01:47] brother bram says notice
[1:01:49] i said he had more success
[1:01:54] not me he had more success
[1:01:57] in my ministry than he did in his own
[1:02:04] earthly
[1:02:06] glory be to god hey listen you know
[1:02:10] this should be the very testimony in
[1:02:12] this hour
[1:02:13] he has more success in the bride of
[1:02:16] jesus christ
[1:02:17] that has come to a completion than he
[1:02:19] had back there on azusa street
[1:02:21] the word has advanced we're walking in
[1:02:24] the fullness of the light
[1:02:25] and the fullness of the holy ghost is
[1:02:27] here it ought to be that way
[1:02:30] that ought to be the expectation that
[1:02:33] he's able to do
[1:02:34] more because there's believers that
[1:02:36] believe him that trust him
[1:02:38] that love him that know him and they
[1:02:41] that know their god shall
[1:02:42] do great exploits
[1:02:48] glory be to god in the highest this is
[1:02:51] why
[1:02:52] in he in john 16 jesus would say
[1:02:55] regarding the spirit of truth
[1:02:57] when he has come he will guide you
[1:03:00] into all truth for he shall not
[1:03:03] speak of himself
[1:03:06] you catch that he won't speak of himself
[1:03:10] in other words he's not there to
[1:03:12] highlight
[1:03:13] the vessel yet
[1:03:16] he comes as
[1:03:19] joshua was magnified in the crossing of
[1:03:22] the jordan
[1:03:23] but the magnifying was not to elevate
[1:03:26] joshua
[1:03:27] but it was that the people's confidence
[1:03:30] would recognize
[1:03:31] that the same god that was with moses is
[1:03:33] the same god with joshua
[1:03:35] because it isn't man that stabilizes us
[1:03:38] it is
[1:03:39] god that stabilizes us
[1:03:45] so then he's the holy spirit the spirit
[1:03:48] of truth he's the spirit of truth
[1:03:50] he'll never elevate or glorify
[1:03:53] the vessel that he's working through
[1:03:58] hallelujah because the vessel
[1:04:02] couldn't even hear couldn't even receive
[1:04:05] if it hadn't been that it got ears to
[1:04:07] hear
[1:04:08] and the spirit of truth comes and
[1:04:10] reveals the truth
[1:04:13] and truth is revealed in vessels of
[1:04:15] truth
[1:04:16] it's god hiding and revealing himself in
[1:04:19] simplicity
[1:04:20] it's not lies that can boast themselves
[1:04:23] right
[1:04:25] no you're a good builder you're a man
[1:04:27] you're a great boat builder
[1:04:30] me i never built paper boats before
[1:04:36] all i know is about hoes and shovels my
[1:04:38] farmer
[1:04:40] come on he planted a vineyard he was a
[1:04:41] farmer
[1:04:43] god don't call you because of your
[1:04:45] abilities
[1:04:47] because if it was by abilities none of
[1:04:49] us would be called
[1:04:51] but god calls us and sometimes the
[1:04:53] things he asks for
[1:04:55] it's very ironic and you look and you
[1:04:57] think me
[1:04:58] maybe you got the wrong guy maybe you
[1:05:00] should have picked this one god says
[1:05:01] no i chose you and i chose you for this
[1:05:05] purpose
[1:05:05] lord my brother so-and-so or sister so
[1:05:08] and so i've got a purpose for them
[1:05:10] but the purpose that god and where he
[1:05:12] places us it's in a place that we depend
[1:05:15] on him not trusting in ourselves
[1:05:22] that's why even in a real marriage we
[1:05:24] don't walk by marriage manuals
[1:05:27] we take our leading from the holy ghost
[1:05:30] are you with me
[1:05:31] that's why even when you know raising
[1:05:33] children and things like that brother
[1:05:34] brandt said get out of them books
[1:05:37] you understand i'm not understand i'm
[1:05:38] not saying that there's not good
[1:05:40] principles out there don't misunderstand
[1:05:42] me
[1:05:42] what i'm saying is that brother you get
[1:05:44] into such a place where you're trying to
[1:05:46] go along with that
[1:05:47] instead of just being sensitive god
[1:05:49] packed that attribute in you
[1:05:50] to be a mother to be a father husband
[1:05:52] and wife god pack that in tribute
[1:05:54] let him unpack it and just as israel
[1:05:58] knew where to stop and unpack
[1:06:00] and when to pack back up the pillar fire
[1:06:03] is present to lead
[1:06:04] to nowhere to unpack and set up camp he
[1:06:07] knows the stations
[1:06:08] and junctions of our life and over time
[1:06:11] all that we have to say is i'm following
[1:06:13] him
[1:06:14] i'm looking to him i'm waiting on him
[1:06:16] what is that that's a life that's not
[1:06:18] vaunting itself like i know this or i
[1:06:20] know that or i know that
[1:06:22] as a matter of fact the further you go
[1:06:23] on you realize the less you know
[1:06:29] many times i've told the lord in prayer
[1:06:30] i said lord i i
[1:06:32] think i'm getting kind of close lord
[1:06:33] maybe to my preschool certificate
[1:06:35] in preaching and pastoring
[1:06:39] i said i think i might be getting a
[1:06:40] little bit closer lord thank thank you
[1:06:42] lord for all the correction
[1:06:44] this time you feel that way oh i feel
[1:06:46] that way yeah i feel that way
[1:06:48] you mean you're still nervous oh i'm
[1:06:49] more nervous now than i've ever been
[1:06:51] well you ought to be arrested the
[1:06:53] responsibilities
[1:06:55] are the responsibility you recognize
[1:06:56] that it becomes greater and greater
[1:06:58] it was fearful in the beginning i didn't
[1:07:00] want it
[1:07:01] but the longer it goes along and it's
[1:07:03] realizing it's realizing lord
[1:07:05] what is it that needs to be brought how
[1:07:07] do we bring it's not a question of what
[1:07:08] to break well you know is there
[1:07:10] something to bring it's lord
[1:07:11] what's what's the purpose what do we
[1:07:13] need for right now what's what's the
[1:07:14] point for this season
[1:07:18] that's not me that's him
[1:07:24] do you understand oh
[1:07:27] my how i covered your prayers thank god
[1:07:30] we pray for one another
[1:07:32] this is why jesus said he shall glorify
[1:07:34] me let me let me just try to wrap this
[1:07:36] up he shall glorify me
[1:07:38] for he shall receive a mind and show it
[1:07:41] unto you this is why
[1:07:44] brother brown would we just speak of
[1:07:46] that there in john 14 or
[1:07:48] hear the lord jesus saying that if you
[1:07:51] ask the father
[1:07:52] in verse 13 if you ask anything in my
[1:07:55] name
[1:07:56] that i will do that the father
[1:07:59] may be glorified in the son
[1:08:02] if you shall ask anything in my name i
[1:08:05] will do it
[1:08:07] this is why peter brings it down and
[1:08:09] says
[1:08:11] if any man will speak let him speak
[1:08:14] as the oracles of god
[1:08:18] i got to looking at this word oracles
[1:08:20] maybe some of my buddies might like this
[1:08:22] one
[1:08:23] oracles mean brief utterances
[1:08:27] from god
[1:08:32] our two hour three-hour brief utterances
[1:08:34] from god
[1:08:35] if any minister let him do it as
[1:08:38] of the ability which god given
[1:08:43] why that god in all things may be
[1:08:46] glorified
[1:08:48] through jesus christ to whom he prays
[1:08:51] and dominion forever and ever
[1:08:53] amen this is why let me just let me just
[1:08:56] close here tonight
[1:08:59] this is why when brother branham when he
[1:09:01] he preaches
[1:09:03] a message called discernment of spirit
[1:09:08] i really well to me it's just
[1:09:12] it's a message that's a very key message
[1:09:16] because brother brahma he goes into this
[1:09:18] into this message and he's dealing
[1:09:20] with life and things that can be
[1:09:25] very gifted brother bran will use these
[1:09:27] words within it
[1:09:29] that no matter how great of a teacher
[1:09:31] somebody is or
[1:09:32] how powerfully or how intellectual
[1:09:36] he is how his gift may operate
[1:09:39] if it isn't trying to achieve something
[1:09:42] for the body of jesus christ
[1:09:44] it's wrong
[1:09:48] brother branham drills down here in this
[1:09:49] message and it is throughout even when
[1:09:51] you read
[1:09:53] um when you read go throughout the whole
[1:09:55] message and then you come into the
[1:09:56] church age book
[1:09:58] if you even just go to the resume of the
[1:10:00] church ages
[1:10:01] you find how the holy spirit picking up
[1:10:03] on the motives
[1:10:05] and objectives not so much of what's
[1:10:08] being done but what's the motive
[1:10:10] behind it brother branham would tell us
[1:10:13] he said something can absolutely be the
[1:10:16] will of god
[1:10:17] but if our motive is selfish or it's not
[1:10:21] right
[1:10:21] it's the same as it not being
[1:10:24] the will of god like you could take a
[1:10:27] person maybe that was going to be
[1:10:28] baptized and they're baptized maybe
[1:10:30] because their peers
[1:10:31] are baptized hey that's a wonderful
[1:10:33] thing to be baptized in the name of the
[1:10:35] lord jesus christ but it's the wrong
[1:10:36] move
[1:10:39] this is why everything emotive and
[1:10:40] objective
[1:10:42] even when it comes to receiving the holy
[1:10:44] ghost
[1:10:45] see this is why and brother brown will
[1:10:47] make this and i i'm closing on this
[1:10:49] but he says no matter how accurate or
[1:10:51] how perfect
[1:10:52] it is it's wrong if it isn't
[1:10:55] used for the body of jesus christ
[1:10:59] see it should never be a gift that pulls
[1:11:02] people
[1:11:04] to the person a gift
[1:11:07] is meant to blend with the body
[1:11:12] so that real true edification doesn't
[1:11:16] put somebody up but it works
[1:11:20] to further bring unity and harmony
[1:11:23] in the body it's edification
[1:11:26] so this is where even in the scripture
[1:11:29] beloved try
[1:11:30] every spirit whether it be of god
[1:11:32] brother brahms really laying out in a
[1:11:34] shorter message
[1:11:35] false anointed ones at the end time
[1:11:37] because to judge that
[1:11:39] motive and objective he said what are
[1:11:41] they trying to achieve and this is what
[1:11:42] he says he said
[1:11:43] maybe that person doesn't come from your
[1:11:45] church
[1:11:46] he said but don't judge them where they
[1:11:49] come from
[1:11:50] judge them according to what are they
[1:11:53] trying to achieve for the body of jesus
[1:11:55] christ
[1:11:57] and i say it like this everyone has an
[1:12:00] approach
[1:12:01] we don't all have the same approach in
[1:12:03] the same avenue
[1:12:04] every church is sovereign
[1:12:08] there's certain ways that god has led me
[1:12:10] sometimes to approach
[1:12:12] to go after souls that someone else
[1:12:14] could have said i don't know if i would
[1:12:15] have taken that approach
[1:12:17] but they're not me and i'm not them i
[1:12:19] have to follow him as he told me to go
[1:12:22] is that right so
[1:12:26] it's the objective what are we trying to
[1:12:27] achieve for the body of christ and
[1:12:29] brother braham says see he says
[1:12:30] you get to a place he said he said the
[1:12:32] spirit he said that's in that man he's
[1:12:34] trying to point the people away from
[1:12:36] himself to calvary
[1:12:39] that's true it's trying to it's to edify
[1:12:42] the body
[1:12:43] of believers you know
[1:12:47] it's where brother brahma you know as he
[1:12:51] goes into that i i just really enjoy
[1:12:53] that message and brother brown
[1:12:54] he deals with it in discernment of the
[1:12:57] spirit there
[1:12:59] what would be the purpose of somebody
[1:13:01] saying well the lord showed me so
[1:13:02] so-and-so is going to be president
[1:13:04] brother branham
[1:13:04] he brings it out so clear what what's
[1:13:06] that to the body
[1:13:10] that's not edifying the body that's you
[1:13:14] or as brother brown says somebody comes
[1:13:16] up and says yeah you see this
[1:13:18] god showed me this and i knew this was
[1:13:20] going to happen
[1:13:23] and then see now on the other part of it
[1:13:25] it requires us to have a little bit of
[1:13:26] patience
[1:13:28] are you with me sometimes it requires us
[1:13:31] to have a little bit of patience
[1:13:33] sometimes
[1:13:34] if something has to be called out god
[1:13:35] will have you to call it out
[1:13:37] and maybe it doesn't mean that maybe
[1:13:38] that person hasn't seen that but it
[1:13:40] wasn't in that way for that to be made
[1:13:42] known
[1:13:43] because when it's stated even in that
[1:13:45] way who does it glorify
[1:13:48] the person not god god tests
[1:13:52] us things are put in our hands to test
[1:13:54] us
[1:13:55] can he entrust us with more
[1:14:00] he does that because he's a faithful
[1:14:03] father
[1:14:04] he knows for every one of us he knows we
[1:14:07] are but flesh
[1:14:09] that's not an excuse but he knows within
[1:14:11] our flesh
[1:14:13] there's there is a part that could you
[1:14:16] know if
[1:14:17] envy is where as the scripture said
[1:14:19] charity envy is not
[1:14:20] it's looking at what someone else has
[1:14:22] this portion of scripture
[1:14:24] is trying to make yourself have
[1:14:26] something
[1:14:27] or to put what you have out
[1:14:31] vaunted let me just tell you something
[1:14:35] he came to where you were and he sought
[1:14:39] you out
[1:14:40] out of all of the people persons that
[1:14:44] were around
[1:14:46] you talking about value he came to me
[1:14:51] he came to you he sent his word
[1:14:55] and brought healing in our life
[1:14:58] if there's one thing that we should brag
[1:15:00] on
[1:15:01] it should be that he came to me
[1:15:04] amen i was lost and undone
[1:15:08] he came to me there's no way i could be
[1:15:11] here today
[1:15:12] but he came to me
[1:15:15] i was in need of a savior he came
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:22] i close i think of that one sister the
[1:15:26] one she said brother branham
[1:15:29] very good things that you said should
[1:15:30] only get one problem
[1:15:33] only got one problem with your preaching
[1:15:37] you brag too much on jesus
[1:15:41] i'm gonna stop there tonight
[1:15:46] we can never break too much
[1:15:53] we could never break too much on him for
[1:15:56] what he's done
[1:16:00] it's true there's a lot of things the
[1:16:01] way god uses us for what he'll speak to
[1:16:03] us
[1:16:04] it's about those are things that are
[1:16:06] entrusted to us
[1:16:08] and this is where we have to be we have
[1:16:10] this is where the word takes us when we
[1:16:12] look at these things in the scriptures
[1:16:14] this is where we have to really brother
[1:16:16] and sister
[1:16:17] be willing it's a it's a big journey
[1:16:21] to be able to go into that place and be
[1:16:24] able to take the word and reflect and
[1:16:25] say
[1:16:26] lord are there some things that really
[1:16:29] need to be rooted out
[1:16:31] it's complexes
[1:16:34] inferiority and superiority but god
[1:16:37] god's the answer to that
[1:16:40] he's the answer to that none of us can
[1:16:42] undo what
[1:16:43] maybe a father or mother didn't do or
[1:16:45] where they forsook you or what somebody
[1:16:47] said or how they belittled you or
[1:16:49] whatever moral or abuse or and we don't
[1:16:52] make the light of that
[1:16:53] but i'm here to tell you there's one who
[1:16:56] cares
[1:16:58] there's one who heals
[1:17:02] wounds that are in your spirit
[1:17:06] he cares for you
[1:17:11] you say why would that need to be healed
[1:17:13] because
[1:17:14] if it's left unattended he can't use you
[1:17:17] according to how he wants to use you
[1:17:20] but to be honest and say god just search
[1:17:23] me
[1:17:23] and if there's something that is there
[1:17:25] lord you're the remedy for it lord
[1:17:28] i surrender it to you because let me
[1:17:30] tell you something
[1:17:32] you're the apple of his eye hallelujah
[1:17:37] if i have in my hand brother brendan
[1:17:39] used this example over and over
[1:17:41] he said if i had in my hand a vial
[1:17:44] full of the literal blood of jesus
[1:17:47] christ
[1:17:48] it would be no greater than what i had
[1:17:51] before me
[1:17:52] because he was willing to give his blood
[1:17:59] i think of that song if that is in love
[1:18:02] than the oceans
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:08] oh he cares so deeply
[1:18:12] if there's one thing in our testimonies
[1:18:14] it continues to go musicians going to
[1:18:16] come
[1:18:16] it goes forth even from this time you
[1:18:18] have to come
[1:18:19] is that our testimony is
[1:18:25] it's god that's supplied
[1:18:28] even if we've come to a place and maybe
[1:18:31] there's a good
[1:18:32] decision you've made it's it's been a
[1:18:34] good decision
[1:18:36] but it's things that you realize lord
[1:18:39] you helped me
[1:18:40] to be sensitive for even that decision
[1:18:45] thank you lord because that was a
[1:18:48] great accomplishment on your part help
[1:18:51] me to be more sensitive
[1:18:54] help me to be more simple lord
[1:18:57] i need lord that my life is
[1:19:00] really consecrated in that in everything
[1:19:03] it can be said
[1:19:06] he's the one who's glorified in all
[1:19:10] things
[1:19:12] i don't know about you and it's not
[1:19:13] something we're trying to do
[1:19:15] but i i certainly certainly would want
[1:19:17] that testimony
[1:19:19] that it would be that maybe
[1:19:22] if the inside of hell could even stick
[1:19:25] up their voice and say
[1:19:29] you can't even stick around that
[1:19:32] that man or that woman i mean they they
[1:19:35] might be talking about car insurance for
[1:19:37] one moment and then they start talking
[1:19:38] about how god's provided for them
[1:19:43] and you try to bring a test up or a try
[1:19:45] you try to bring something up
[1:19:47] and point out or an obstacle and then
[1:19:50] here they stand around and say
[1:19:52] he's still a waymaker
[1:19:56] i mean it doesn't matter what goes on
[1:19:59] they brag on him
[1:20:04] that's the testimony
[1:20:08] that i want to have
[1:20:11] that's not a show we're putting on right
[1:20:13] let me just say it very clearly
[1:20:15] i think every one of you can identify
[1:20:17] with me tonight
[1:20:18] he's more than life to me
[1:20:22] he's everything he's been my he's my
[1:20:25] comforter
[1:20:26] when i've been distraught he's
[1:20:28] encouraged me
[1:20:29] when i felt lower than the padding under
[1:20:31] this rug
[1:20:33] he's picked me up when i fell down
[1:20:37] he's encouraged me he's given me
[1:20:39] strength he's touched my body
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:45] and i didn't feel like i could make one
[1:20:46] step in front of another
[1:20:49] he came he said come on son i'm right
[1:20:52] here with you
[1:20:56] hallelujah but maybe i've taught all
[1:20:58] along
[1:20:59] in the midst of a situation felt like my
[1:21:02] prayers were going up
[1:21:03] and coming off but then
[1:21:06] through that moment it would be a place
[1:21:08] that would
[1:21:10] something would take place that lets me
[1:21:13] know
[1:21:14] he's been right here the whole time i
[1:21:17] believed it
[1:21:19] i couldn't see it i couldn't feel him i
[1:21:21] believed it
[1:21:22] but i sure am glad that he did that for
[1:21:24] me i'm glad that he let me have that
[1:21:26] little token
[1:21:28] and let me know i care i've been here
[1:21:30] the whole time
[1:21:31] [Music]
[1:21:34] oh my god we can't brag on him enough
[1:21:40] well even here tonight we could have a
[1:21:42] testimony service it could go all the
[1:21:44] way into the wee hours of the morning
[1:21:48] sister armor there'd be something you
[1:21:50] say and i'd say well you know what that
[1:21:52] reminds me of something over here
[1:21:53] i'd get up and say it brother bill might
[1:21:55] have already passed up here 52 times
[1:21:57] because
[1:21:57] you know what that reminds me of a time
[1:22:00] then about that time sister barb you've
[1:22:01] already been up here 63 times and sister
[1:22:03] bart said you know what that reminds me
[1:22:05] of another time

[1:22:12] hallelujah he's worthy of all of our
[1:22:16] prayers
