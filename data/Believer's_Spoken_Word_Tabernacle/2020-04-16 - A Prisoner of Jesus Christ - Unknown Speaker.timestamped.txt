[29:38] well we want to just greet you in the
[29:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and maybe
[29:45] before I turn to the word here just a
[29:48] few moments I'm not going to take much
[29:50] time here tonight but I just our hearts
[29:56] you have already known as an assembly
[29:59] with brother herb Keithley and certainly
[30:03] our hearts are very heavy and yet we are
[30:10] sad but yet we are joyful because we
[30:14] know that our brother he's no longer
[30:17] suffering he has really been those of
[30:20] you that know very keenly aware where
[30:23] the herb is certainly battled especially
[30:26] the last two years of his in his journey
[30:30] here and which it's nothing new for
[30:35] brother herb to to battle
[30:37] Ian's sister Jo there's so much that I
[30:40] would like to say here tonight but I
[30:42] will reserve that here for perhaps to
[30:45] share some things on Sunday just a true
[30:50] pillar of the church you know there's
[30:53] many times there's pillars of different
[30:56] ones that can come in over the years and
[30:59] they're a pillar is one that is one who
[31:02] has established as strong in the Lord
[31:04] there with the vision for the Word of
[31:08] God their hearts desire is to see the
[31:10] work of God the Living Word flourish in
[31:14] the hearts and lives of the people and
[31:17] to stand faithful in all things and I
[31:21] would say that brother herb has done
[31:25] that and been that from the very
[31:27] beginning here and we just want to say
[31:32] that we so love and appreciate well
[31:35] everything that he has meant to us
[31:37] throughout the years and we are
[31:41] certainly going to to miss him but we
[31:44] know that soon and very soon we're gonna
[31:47] see him I would say that that day that
[31:50] that final at the final moment
[31:54] and whenever as that final moment and
[31:57] that final crossing over there in that
[32:01] dividing of time I would say there was a
[32:03] great reunion on the on the shores that
[32:07] on that evening or that morning we
[32:09] should say when he would meet his
[32:12] sweetheart sister Joe when they stood
[32:14] hand-in-hand and very much for the
[32:18] gospel of Jesus Christ and so very much
[32:21] they mean to this assembly some that may
[32:24] not know and and some of that of the
[32:27] background perhaps we'll be able Lord
[32:29] willing to share a little bit of those
[32:31] things a little bit of it on Sunday but
[32:34] I want you just to keep keep them in
[32:38] prayer the Keithley family and during
[32:42] this time also to remind you that the
[32:45] funeral itself is one that it is it's
[32:48] private
[32:49] we understand that because of the
[32:52] situation that's going on health-wise it
[32:55] will be streamed we will send the link
[32:58] to you in the email so that you can
[33:00] stream it the brothers and sisters if
[33:03] you would so if you would like to do
[33:06] that you'd be able to stream the service
[33:08] that we will have there we'll send all
[33:11] the information to you via email here
[33:14] hopefully as soon as we would have the
[33:17] things possibly by tomorrow I would
[33:20] expect if not already by this evening so
[33:23] without that it without for any further
[33:26] ado I want to say I just appreciate the
[33:28] testimony that I heard and I'm sure
[33:30] there's other testimonies and just to
[33:32] remind you as we said in prayer the Word
[33:36] of God is not bound these are not
[33:40] circumstances that we delight in but we
[33:45] know nonetheless the Word of God is not
[33:48] bound and to think of it you know we see
[33:52] that we see that that reality even where
[33:56] we witnessed it on the platform of where
[33:59] even here the prophet standing here and
[34:01] we know that as he would yield himself
[34:04] and the ange of the Lord would begin to
[34:07] unfold things that people had been
[34:10] praying about or even the doctor they
[34:14] had seen and go through the whole visit
[34:17] of the doctor's visit and you realize
[34:20] that though here the the prophet and the
[34:23] rest of the audience was there in time
[34:26] but the ange of the Lord would pick up
[34:30] the prophet and he would be able to see
[34:32] not in the dimension of time but here it
[34:35] is standing in eternity and be able to
[34:38] look over and say I see you were here
[34:40] and this is this and that and that was
[34:42] only to build the faith so that they
[34:45] could walk on and receive what was being
[34:49] spoken and that's why brother Branham
[34:51] would tell us over and over he says
[34:53] there's not a vision that heals you you
[34:56] must have faith in what he told you in
[34:59] the vision
[35:00] and that same way spiritually as well
[35:03] yet there is a vision the Prophet told
[35:05] us in Daniel 70 weeks there's a vision
[35:08] and a power behind this message that
[35:11] sent from God to get the people in order
[35:14] for the rapture he told us in that same
[35:17] message and then in the message the Ange
[35:19] of the Lord he spoke even in the the
[35:21] getting together of Israel and the
[35:24] 144,000 how God was moving in the earth
[35:27] he said the angel of the Lord is on
[35:30] earth tonight getting he said that of
[35:32] the hundred forty-four thousand in
[35:34] position and so we recognize we might
[35:37] look at it and say my that was said
[35:39] clear back in the late 40s or early 50s
[35:42] but remember God is in no hurry you
[35:45] can't hurry him up and you can't slow
[35:47] him down nothing can hinder God from
[35:50] fulfilling his word his word is going to
[35:53] be brought to pass is that right
[35:55] sometimes we understand God has to move
[35:58] in certain ways to get our attention and
[36:00] get us into the place so that the word
[36:03] itself the vision can break forth but
[36:05] everything is one one thing for sure is
[36:08] that the vision though it Terry you
[36:11] cannot fail so we thank God for that so
[36:14] we want to just also remember as we
[36:17] would turn in the word of the Lord
[36:18] tonight we also want to remember brother
[36:20] Joel Forney in prayer we've you know
[36:23] heard some good reports and I've been
[36:25] getting the reports appreciate different
[36:27] brothers I had brothers calling me from
[36:31] different places and and different texts
[36:33] and things and so not just here in the
[36:36] assembly but also from other places
[36:38] allowed me to know that about with
[36:40] brother Jewel and I just had spoke with
[36:43] brother jewel on the phone just two
[36:44] weeks ago and we were just talking about
[36:46] some different things there in the work
[36:49] of the Lord and you know brother Jew we
[36:53] just want to lift him up in prayer that
[36:55] God will just give our brother strength
[36:57] and just completely restore him
[37:01] and that is certainly what we're looking
[37:03] to so tonight I have a couple places in
[37:06] the scripture I'd like to go to and
[37:08] begin on a little thought that a few
[37:12] weeks ago
[37:14] as we're just getting ready to speak on
[37:16] a Thursday night here the Spirit of the
[37:18] Lord just came right there in the office
[37:20] and just moving upon these things and so
[37:23] we want to just bring that by the help
[37:26] of the Lord tonight as he would give it
[37:28] and has given it them in Philemon it's
[37:33] only one chapter but verse 1 of Philemon
[37:36] and we know that this is a letter it's a
[37:41] personal letter if you could say it it
[37:45] would be like maybe in our database an
[37:47] audio letter it was not an epistle it
[37:50] was a personal letter to Philemon and it
[37:54] was written on behalf of Onesimus but we
[37:58] want to focus just on the first part of
[38:00] that verse Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[38:05] Christ and Timothy our brother unto
[38:07] Philemon our dearly beloved and fellow
[38:09] laborer and I just want to focus on that
[38:12] part Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ may
[38:16] God bless you bless the reading of the
[38:17] word as you're being seated
[38:19] I like to speak on a thought or begin to
[38:23] hear tonight on a prisoner of Jesus
[38:26] Christ and sometimes when we we just
[38:30] think of that or that thought would be
[38:32] thrown out and placed out there one in
[38:37] their mind you know that would not be
[38:42] converted they have within them a
[38:46] warring or wrestling within and they
[38:51] really are still imprisoned to that of
[38:54] the first nature in that of the world
[38:56] and there can be a desire to serve God
[38:59] and that's what God put within them and
[39:02] only God can quenched that in fulfilling
[39:04] but once God has come and quenched that
[39:08] desire and God has brought it into a
[39:10] living reality and the old nature is
[39:13] dead then were no longer connected to
[39:18] that of that old nature of that first
[39:21] Adam but the second Adam has come into
[39:25] our heart as Peter would write the
[39:27] hidden man of the heart and remember
[39:29] just as Christ Himself just as God came
[39:32] down and become flesh and remember here
[39:36] this is where heaven and earth embrace
[39:40] this is where here the unfolding of
[39:43] redemption where God had made a body
[39:45] that he and through that body him coming
[39:48] and redeeming that body unto himself
[39:51] that he had made he stepped into that
[39:55] body that Tabernacle and He fulfilled
[39:58] the Word of God the law of redemption
[40:02] the working of the kinsmen that then the
[40:04] life that was with inside that blood
[40:07] cell once the blood cell was shed then
[40:09] that life can be imparted to us as
[40:12] believers and then we come under that
[40:15] blood we have been delivered from
[40:18] darkness and have been translated into
[40:22] the kingdom of his dear son then we have
[40:26] the testimony I am a prisoner of Jesus
[40:29] Christ
[40:30] and it is not the testimony or something
[40:33] within our heart that we desire to get
[40:36] out of on the contrary
[40:38] we desire more and more of him once you
[40:41] have tasted of the Lord and God has
[40:43] moved within the heart you want more and
[40:46] more of him you are a prisoner meaning
[40:50] that we desire that it would be the will
[40:54] of God to be fulfilled in our life
[40:56] because that's exactly the way it was in
[40:59] the life of the Lord Jesus when he was
[41:02] here he said I've not come to do my own
[41:05] will but I come to do the will of my
[41:08] father when sent me and so we see that
[41:11] from Psalms it's expressed in Psalms
[41:14] that sacrifice and burnt offerings that
[41:16] would it's not but a body has stopped
[41:18] prepared for me sacrifice and offerings
[41:21] were given that him that a man might
[41:23] come and have and have fellowship with
[41:26] God but those sacrifice and offerings
[41:28] could never do away with what really
[41:30] separated man from God and that was sin
[41:33] nature but God coming down and now
[41:36] living in that body of flesh here was
[41:39] the fulfillment or the restoring of what
[41:43] Adam the first Adam lost or forfeited
[41:46] now is restored by the second Adam and
[41:50] now that is imparted to the sons and
[41:53] daughters of God because in order as we
[41:56] were sons and daughters of God always in
[41:58] order to bring forth a son and daughter
[42:00] of God you must have the life the
[42:03] original life of the father that can be
[42:06] imparted to actually bring
[42:09] transformation and release the son and
[42:12] daughter that's beneath the darkness
[42:14] that cover in our life so it took God
[42:17] coming and now is he paid the price then
[42:21] that life it comes to you and then our
[42:23] testimony is like Paul I am a prisoner
[42:27] of Jesus Christ so as you know we're
[42:31] looking here in the scripture and I
[42:33] might my my my attention in my heart was
[42:37] drawn to in acts 28 verse 16
[42:42] and when we were you remember the tops
[42:45] we were ministering on be of good cheer
[42:47] the Lord is in full control and we were
[42:50] dealing with that journey and we we came
[42:53] to a certain spot but how the Lord
[42:56] during that time begin to quicken some
[42:57] things to me I just waited just to see
[42:59] cuz you never know
[43:01] when's the timing is it now is it for a
[43:03] year from now when is it for and so
[43:05] these are some things that we just want
[43:08] to share from our hearts that that would
[43:10] relate to our walk with God and we find
[43:13] this is dealing with Paul they come up
[43:15] on the island in the shipwrecked and
[43:17] remember Paul is in route to Rome he has
[43:21] appealed unto Caesar here he is you know
[43:23] he is a prisoner he's being carried and
[43:28] transported all the way there to Rome
[43:31] and when they comes here in verse 16
[43:33] this is after they've been on the island
[43:37] and so forth for three months and the
[43:39] Bible says in verse 16 and when we came
[43:41] to Rome the Centurion delivered the
[43:45] prisoners to the captain of the guard
[43:47] but Paul was suffered to dwell by
[43:51] himself with a soldier that kept him now
[43:55] I want you just to think of this for a
[43:57] moment Paul was not regarded as anybody
[44:01] who had done anything wrong he was not
[44:04] regarded as a male factor and as someone
[44:06] who was a criminal but what it was they
[44:09] recognized there was a case that was to
[44:12] be heard and there was that of a request
[44:15] the way then it would be stated that has
[44:18] the other prisoners were delivered to
[44:20] the common prison they were sent to go
[44:23] there but yet here you find Paul is
[44:26] given an opportunity or he is rather the
[44:30] the allotment for him is that he would
[44:33] be with a soldier or a soldier would
[44:36] keep him he would not be in the prison
[44:39] but as the scripture would go on if we
[44:41] could read in acts 28 30 it goes on to
[44:45] unfold and say Paul dwelt two years in
[44:48] his own hired house
[44:51] now this was aware where there was a
[44:54] place a lodging it was not a jail this
[44:57] was a house that was there Paul that was
[44:59] renting now the think of it why is he
[45:01] here for this longevity of time when the
[45:04] Bible says he's there for two years in
[45:06] his own hired house because remember
[45:08] he's waiting to stand before Caesar you
[45:11] see he has appealed to stand before
[45:14] Caesar in that of a Roman citizen but it
[45:17] was not remember Paul is not as we read
[45:20] in Philemon he's not allotting hid that
[45:23] his imprisonment as a prisoner of Rome
[45:26] he said I'm a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[45:29] because it was God's will that this
[45:32] gospel would be carried to the Gentiles
[45:34] and so to think it would be the last
[45:38] place that God would allow Paul to be
[45:40] carried to would be that in Rome and how
[45:44] that the word itself even rise in Rome
[45:46] and we we won't get to that tonight now
[45:48] the Word of God even in the midst of his
[45:51] bonds the word was being manifest the
[45:54] word was growing now to think of it
[45:56] there's things that you and I have
[45:58] wanted and we've waited for a much
[46:00] shorter time Paul was there waiting for
[46:02] 2 years he did not know when the
[46:05] quarantine I mean he did not know when
[46:07] he was going to peel before Caesar all
[46:09] he knew is I'm here and this is God's
[46:12] will this is life that I am here so I'm
[46:15] going to occupy myself with the gospel
[46:18] so Paul is delivered and he is there
[46:23] while the rest of the prisoners are in
[46:25] the common prison but just to give you a
[46:27] little bit of a background within this
[46:29] here Paul was placed in a manner so that
[46:32] the soldier as the Scriptures we read
[46:35] there before that there was a soldier
[46:39] where Paul's right hand was actually in
[46:42] a chain and it was chained to that of a
[46:45] soldiers left hand it was constantly
[46:49] this is where the soldier kept him it
[46:51] was not a soldier just sitting in the
[46:53] house but there was a chain upon Paul's
[46:56] hand
[46:56] so wherever Paul went this soldier had
[46:59] to go where and when Paul sat down the
[47:01] soldier he could get close by kid
[47:03] stander Achatz
[47:04] sat down wherever wherever whatever Paul
[47:07] did this soldier had to do and to think
[47:11] of it the soldier itself just sold that
[47:13] the soldier didn't get so overtired the
[47:17] soldier was relieved of its duties
[47:19] according to that of history every four
[47:22] hours there was a fresh soldier that was
[47:25] put on duty so when we think of this
[47:27] this to me it just seems very parallel
[47:32] when we look at this of even our walk as
[47:36] believers you know
[47:38] Paul would write it like this in Romans
[47:41] 8:21 and he would say the creature
[47:44] itself now what's a ball what he's
[47:46] speaking of the creature itself talking
[47:49] about the real son and daughter of God
[47:51] on the inside shall also be delivered
[47:56] from the bondage of corruption into the
[48:00] glorious liberty of the children of God
[48:03] you see Liberty has already come to our
[48:08] soul and once that Liberty has come to
[48:13] our soul which is the earnest of the
[48:15] Spirit it becomes aware to you and I
[48:20] this this veil this body is the bondage
[48:24] of corruption it will its weaknesses
[48:28] within this body but when Christ is
[48:32] moved on the inside there is no weakness
[48:35] in him and we are in him so this is
[48:39] where we can say greater is He that is
[48:42] in me than he that's in the world I can
[48:45] do all things through Christ that
[48:47] strengtheneth me so this this bondage
[48:51] that you and I this bondage of
[48:53] corruption is that of the pest house
[48:56] brother branham would refer to it in
[48:57] that way in many places it's a pest
[49:00] house Paul would pick it up and write in
[49:03] Romans 7 verse 14 and say for we know
[49:06] that the law is spiritual but I am
[49:08] carnal sold under sin for that which I
[49:11] do I allow not for what I would that do
[49:16] I not but what I hate
[49:18] do I if then I do that which I would not
[49:21] I consent unto the law that it is good
[49:25] now venting is no more I that do it but
[49:28] sin that dwelleth in me for I know that
[49:31] in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no
[49:35] good thing remember Paul would expressly
[49:40] over and over a says it in the book of
[49:42] Philippians he says that that for If any
[49:45] man think is to have confidence in the
[49:47] flesh he said I more he said for Here I
[49:50] am a Pharisee of the Pharisees born of
[49:52] the stock of Benjamin he lay what's he
[49:54] letting it be known the flesh no matter
[49:56] what kind of pedigree is behind this
[49:58] flesh it's death
[50:00] it's to have no confidence in this flesh
[50:04] let me just say it clearly it doesn't
[50:06] matter if this flesh has been in a
[50:07] message church it's still corruption
[50:10] it's gotta come a change on the inside
[50:14] hey man there's got to be a Liberty come
[50:17] on the inside cuz this man is the
[50:19] Ishmael he can never be tamed by word
[50:23] alone come on somebody he can only the
[50:27] only way Ishmael can ever be brought in
[50:31] subjection is when Isaac rises from the
[50:35] inside and Isaac is what Isaac is that
[50:39] gene that is written in the Lamb's Book
[50:42] of Life and when the Holy Ghost has come
[50:44] it stands there it seals the breach
[50:47] between that soul and that
[50:50] representation there on the Lamb's Book
[50:52] of Life and what happens there you begin
[50:55] the reflection of the life that is
[50:57] written in the word the character of
[51:00] this hour is being made manifest through
[51:02] your life you are no longer in bondage
[51:05] and slavery to that of the old man but
[51:08] now you are you to Christ the word by
[51:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my
[51:15] because Ishmael Hien there's got to be
[51:18] an Isaac that's who God said my covenant
[51:21] shall be with him for know for to me for
[51:25] to will is present with me but how to
[51:27] perform that which is good I find not
[51:30] for
[51:31] good that I would I do not but the evil
[51:34] which I would not that I do now if I do
[51:37] that I would not it is no more I that do
[51:41] it but sin that dwelleth in me I find in
[51:45] a law that when I would do good evil is
[51:47] present with me for I delight in the law
[51:51] of God after the inward man that's
[51:53] what's important
[51:54] who's your delight Psalms one one come
[51:58] on now blessed is the man is that right
[52:01] that man is planted not freshly planted
[52:04] brother bran tells us that planting it
[52:06] was by predestination in the word for
[52:09] this hour and the Spirit of God moves
[52:12] upon you to reveal you are already
[52:15] ordained in Christ but the Spirit of God
[52:17] has made you aware of those rights
[52:20] redemptive rights that belong to you
[52:23] that you can claim as a son and daughter
[52:25] of God where the enemy has tried to rob
[52:27] you and keep you back you can say I've
[52:30] got a right these are my redemptive
[52:33] rights there was a sacrifice my
[52:35] sacrifice on Calvary and these are my
[52:38] redemptive rights I've got a right to
[52:40] healing I've got a right to the baptism
[52:43] of the Holy Ghost I've got a right to
[52:45] deliverance I have redemptive rights
[52:47] that Jesus Christ has come and he has
[52:50] restored back to me I delight in the law
[52:55] of God after the inward man but I see
[52:59] notice I see another law in my members
[53:06] whose members are they they belong to me
[53:09] this body is given to me is that right
[53:14] it's your body is given to you that's
[53:17] why brother Branham will tell us he said
[53:18] you've never seen the real William
[53:20] Branham all you've seen is the thorn
[53:23] right you've only seen the form which
[53:26] that of the expression or as it would be
[53:30] spoken of there in the book of
[53:33] Philippians being morphe of God wherein
[53:35] that which is invisible would strike the
[53:38] visible form so what we have seen and
[53:42] brother man said you come up and say god
[53:43] bless you brother man three
[53:44] your brother branham but really who
[53:46] is it the real brother branham is the
[53:49] one who's down on the inside that's why
[53:51] when a saint or child of God when God
[53:54] would summons them home remember he is
[53:57] graduating taking with him precious and
[54:00] the side of the Lord is the death of his
[54:02] Saints what's he doing he is calling out
[54:04] the jewels that have already been
[54:07] brought forth in that life it is
[54:09] character the very character that life
[54:12] who they really are
[54:13] what do we go to the funeral home and
[54:15] see we see the shell but the real one
[54:18] lived in and that shell was just a
[54:20] temporary home here but all we go to one
[54:25] that is not made with hands it is
[54:27] reserved in the heavens and while we're
[54:30] here in this life we are reflecting that
[54:33] we are from another world Oh glory be to
[54:38] God
[54:38] yeah I see this law in my members you're
[54:41] blessed to see this warring against the
[54:45] law of my mind you're blessed to see it
[54:48] that way
[54:49] and bringing me into captivity to the
[54:52] law of sin which is in my members all
[54:56] wretched man that i let me just stop
[54:58] then let me back up on verse 23 you
[55:00] might look at that and say it brings me
[55:02] into captivity to the law of sin which
[55:04] is in my members do not get your mind
[55:06] just on drinking smoking adultery
[55:08] fornication remember sin is unbelief and
[55:11] to think about it if you allow something
[55:14] to dwell it might be a grudge a hard
[55:16] feeling how many of us and I'm gonna ask
[55:18] you to raise your hands you've had to
[55:20] repent for something you've said it may
[55:22] not have been what you said was wrong it
[55:24] might have been the motive and objective
[55:26] of which you had behind it and you
[55:28] realize that was wrong it wasn't so much
[55:31] what was said it was the motive or
[55:33] ejected or the way it was said what was
[55:35] that the law of sin in our members is
[55:40] that right oh but we realize we don't
[55:42] just let that alone say oh you know that
[55:44] wasn't me no Sarah we say forgive me
[55:47] Lord Jesus or if it's something I've
[55:49] done to brother Richard or brother bill
[55:51] say brothers forgive me I shouldn't have
[55:52] said that what is that patty is not
[55:55] allowing that law to reign in that life
[55:58] I will not give no place to the devil Oh
[56:03] Gloria now sometimes when that has to be
[56:07] done this soldier don't want to go do it
[56:09] you win we win you know we take the
[56:11] right hand and we sit come on we're
[56:13] going well we've got to go make
[56:15] something right sir and soldier says no
[56:16] no no the flesh says no no no no no no
[56:19] if I do that then it'll embarrass me I
[56:22] mean look what they'll make me fight
[56:23] look what they'll feel about me but the
[56:25] inside man says come on we're going and
[56:28] I need to borrow your lips
[56:29] Oh wretched man that I am my wood we've
[56:40] been delivered of the pride in our soul
[56:43] oh my then we've got victory right there
[56:46] all wretched man that I am Who Shall
[56:48] deliver me from the body of this death I
[56:50] thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord
[56:54] so then with the mind I myself serve the
[56:57] law of God but with the flesh the law of
[56:59] sin no brother branham answers this in
[57:02] many different places in the message but
[57:04] I'm just going to pick up the one in
[57:05] question as an answer 64 when brother
[57:07] Brandon would go to answer this
[57:09] particular question about I can't
[57:11] understand Romans seven and brother Bram
[57:13] says let me just kind of polish it up so
[57:15] you can he said this is what Paul is
[57:18] saying in me is two persons right one
[57:23] wants me to do wrong the other wants me
[57:26] to do you know that what the right one
[57:29] wants me to do and wrong the other one
[57:31] wants me to do and every time I start to
[57:33] do right then wrong hinders me
[57:37] now we can ask you in your living rooms
[57:39] how many of felt led to do something
[57:41] before and instead of doing it you know
[57:43] they get so lets it gets all reasoned
[57:45] out and you don't go to do it what was
[57:47] the reasoning part the reasoning part
[57:49] did not come from with him that of the
[57:51] soul but the reasoning part came from
[57:53] that other pool than other part that's
[57:55] out there now notice he says you are an
[57:58] outward man which is controlled by six
[58:01] senses or five senses rather you are an
[58:04] inward man controlled by one sense which
[58:06] is faith and this faith disagrees with
[58:09] all five senses if the five senses
[58:12] doesn't agree with faith oh my so we
[58:16] don't remember God doesn't need a
[58:18] majority he is us and God are in the
[58:22] majority when he called when he called
[58:25] and spoke to Gideon he said thou mighty
[58:27] man of Valor
[58:28] remember Gideon was only one but
[58:31] remember it does not take a whole
[58:33] company or a whole multitude of people
[58:36] we see that in Gideon's day we see it in
[58:38] other wars that his real fought it was
[58:40] not about the multitude of numbers you
[58:43] and God the Prophet would say it like
[58:45] this you and God are in the majority
[58:48] when you are united together I can do
[58:52] all things through Christ that
[58:53] strengtheneth me now notice this so
[58:57] faith itself faith will stand alone when
[58:59] the rest of the senses are trying to
[59:01] pull it this way or trying to say this
[59:03] but faith will make it stand upon God's
[59:06] Word now he says now one is contrary to
[59:09] the other now as long as the six senses
[59:12] agree with the faith wonderful but when
[59:15] the five senses disagrees with faith
[59:18] then leave the five senses alone
[59:22] but how many times that we have not and
[59:26] then we have to come around and say Lord
[59:29] forgive me right forgive me what
[59:33] happened well that God that were chained
[59:35] to is the one that's pulled us in that
[59:37] way is that right
[59:39] but the end the end were God the real
[59:41] Paul the real you the real son and
[59:44] daughter of God on the inside remember
[59:46] this is where the struggle this is where
[59:49] then here as we war even when the word
[59:51] would come forth let me just keep
[59:53] reading here brother Graham said for
[59:55] example Jesus made a statement and the
[59:57] inside man says that's true
[1:00:00] the outside man reasons that it can't be
[1:00:03] true to you then ignore oh my then
[1:00:09] ignore the outside man and accept the
[1:00:13] inside man it doesn't mean that the
[1:00:17] outside man is going to shut up but
[1:00:19] you've got to ignore him
[1:00:21] you know God listen we'll just look at
[1:00:24] it for example through the scripture you
[1:00:26] found that when God well when Abraham
[1:00:28] was praying to God in the book of
[1:00:30] Genesis and he said O God that Ishmael
[1:00:33] might live before you you find when he
[1:00:35] was praying that way God just runs right
[1:00:38] over top of that he acts like it didn't
[1:00:40] even hear it he ignores what Abraham is
[1:00:43] praying about and about two verses later
[1:00:46] he after Abraham gets done God just
[1:00:49] picks it up as though they both had been
[1:00:51] talking about Isaac and then after God
[1:00:53] gets done saying what he wants to say
[1:00:55] then God says oh yeah by the way yeah
[1:00:57] I've heard you what you said about
[1:00:58] Ishmael he said my covenant is not with
[1:01:01] him but but I'll bless him and this and
[1:01:03] that you see what is it God's Word if
[1:01:05] God values his word first this is what
[1:01:08] God is speaking to is the inside man
[1:01:11] then if God would so value that to bring
[1:01:14] you and have the redemption battle by
[1:01:17] the new birth then how much more should
[1:01:19] you and I value that of the inside of
[1:01:22] really the real true you and me that is
[1:01:25] down on the inside not valuing our own
[1:01:28] plots out here our own opinions out here
[1:01:30] our own feelings out here those are the
[1:01:33] things that
[1:01:34] under us and they hinder the working of
[1:01:36] the Lord in our lives now notice this is
[1:01:39] why brother Branham would go on to say
[1:01:41] in that same quote he said we are carnal
[1:01:44] and that part must perish now what he's
[1:01:48] talking about right there and just that
[1:01:50] little abbreviated statement there's got
[1:01:52] to come a perishing of that nature on
[1:01:55] the inside we cannot perfect this body
[1:01:58] that's not the perfection that is
[1:02:00] entrusted to you and I
[1:02:01] but without to receive the perfection
[1:02:04] that comes from the Lord where he said
[1:02:06] in Matthew 5:48 be you therefore perfect
[1:02:08] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[1:02:10] is that right and then we find where
[1:02:12] Paul would write and he would say let us
[1:02:14] go on to perfection Paul was not writing
[1:02:17] that for you and I to try to perfect
[1:02:19] this body but the real perfection comes
[1:02:22] when our nature is changed and there
[1:02:25] comes the perfection of that life on the
[1:02:28] inside that the Indrid man delights to
[1:02:31] do the law of the Lord where the desire
[1:02:34] on the inside of all of our life is to
[1:02:36] please the Lord Jesus Christ so that
[1:02:39] carnal part that's on the inside has to
[1:02:42] die well if that inside part dies what
[1:02:45] do you have you have the shell the
[1:02:47] temple that is only a temple a house
[1:02:50] where one guy used to live but now when
[1:02:53] the new man steps on the inside when
[1:02:55] Jesus Christ comes down and brother he
[1:02:58] brings about the new birth others can
[1:03:00] look at you and say well I remember
[1:03:02] Richard Sanchez or I remember Tony Gomez
[1:03:04] and they can go down that but you know
[1:03:06] there's something different about them
[1:03:07] now they see the same house out here but
[1:03:10] they know there's something different
[1:03:12] they can't put their hand on it what is
[1:03:14] that there has been a transformation
[1:03:16] that is taking place on the inside
[1:03:19] there's been the new man Christ Jesus
[1:03:21] that has brought a son and daughter of
[1:03:24] God into expression it's the same old
[1:03:27] temple but brother we are a new creation
[1:03:29] in Christ Jesus all things have passed
[1:03:33] away and behold all things have become
[1:03:36] new Oh glory be to God and then inside
[1:03:41] we are a spirit man
[1:03:43] soul inside that's faith in God's Word
[1:03:46] then we bring our outside body under
[1:03:52] subjection to the word by faith by
[1:03:54] accepting what God said now he goes on
[1:03:57] he says how can I take a a burrow
[1:03:59] and make a grain of wheat out of it
[1:04:03] the son of this statement no it's not
[1:04:06] very deep but it's very important it's
[1:04:08] impossible for me to do it it doesn't
[1:04:12] matter how much how much sweet life is
[1:04:15] preached and the cockerel says well you
[1:04:18] know I'm gonna try to do this and I'm
[1:04:19] going to try to do that it's impossible
[1:04:21] for you to do it it's impossible
[1:04:25] it takes a sovereign work of Almighty
[1:04:29] God because you're not gonna face flakes
[1:04:32] of flesh and blood you are going to come
[1:04:34] face to face with demon powers you've
[1:04:37] got to have assurance in your heart that
[1:04:40] passes beyond the five senses you've got
[1:04:42] to have an anchor that I know that I
[1:04:44] know that I know that I know that I am
[1:04:47] his and he is mine it's impossible for
[1:04:52] you to do it the only way is because
[1:04:56] inside that kokuboro has been
[1:05:00] transmitted from a kookaburra a cook a
[1:05:04] burl to a germ called wheat life wheat
[1:05:09] life so if we take it you could take
[1:05:12] this seat here you take the or LCD
[1:05:15] cut it open on the inside is a germ of
[1:05:18] kokuboro if you take the germ out of
[1:05:21] kokuboro put the germ of wheat on the
[1:05:24] inside close it back up and you plant it
[1:05:26] when you plant it what's going to come
[1:05:29] out of it once that seed ross wheat life
[1:05:31] that's where the mystery and the
[1:05:34] unfolding of great is the mystery of
[1:05:37] godliness the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:39] it's God's sovereign work that takes out
[1:05:42] the old Cocker burrow jerem and he puts
[1:05:45] in that wheat germ from the inside Oh
[1:05:49] glory be to God oh my then you bury that
[1:05:53] Taco Bell it'll produce a grain of wheat
[1:05:56] because there has been a life of wheat
[1:05:59] put in that Tucker burrow and the life
[1:06:01] of the kokuboro has been taken out but
[1:06:03] the nature of the kokuboro is still
[1:06:06] sticky and it will be until this new
[1:06:10] life has been fully developed out of the
[1:06:13] ground and raised up again until we
[1:06:17] the body that matches what has taken
[1:06:19] place in our soul we're still gonna deal
[1:06:22] with this sticky kokuboro
[1:06:25] part o glory when it comes forth then
[1:06:30] it's no more cooker bro I'm looking
[1:06:33] forward to that aren't you you see it we
[1:06:36] don't want to just be I want to be young
[1:06:37] cockerels
[1:06:38] no that's not what the body change is
[1:06:40] the body changes and come on coming back
[1:06:42] to a young KOCO bro no kokuboro is that
[1:06:45] nature that's sex birth but there is to
[1:06:49] come that will the birth of a life of a
[1:06:51] body that will not come through him by
[1:06:54] sex but it will be a body that will come
[1:06:57] forth by the spoken word of god as joe
[1:07:00] said he will call and I will answer a
[1:07:03] man just as that soul of yours has
[1:07:06] responded and answered the call of the
[1:07:09] world in this hour there were our bodies
[1:07:12] will answer the call of the word because
[1:07:15] the real you and me on the inside are
[1:07:18] actually leading our bodies to a change
[1:07:23] so come on Roman
[1:07:27] alright oh man
[1:07:38] a cockerel notice while it's here on
[1:07:40] earth a cockle barrel it's still sticky
[1:07:43] but it's got the nature on side inside
[1:07:46] of a wheat as long as you're in this
[1:07:49] life you're gonna be sticky and have a
[1:07:52] carnal nature you know it's sticky means
[1:07:54] a Oboro is something you can be
[1:07:57] walking by it and you don't even have to
[1:07:59] brush you in hard against it and it
[1:08:00] sticks to your pants
[1:08:02] or it stick to your sleeve I've had them
[1:08:04] when I went out hunting and especially
[1:08:06] at different times with brother herb
[1:08:07] we'd be clown and Wellington walking
[1:08:09] through woods and fields and I'd come
[1:08:10] out of there after leaving out a certain
[1:08:12] way to meet him back out there man I'd
[1:08:14] come forth in my hunting gear
[1:08:16] I'd have cooker bras all over me then
[1:08:17] boogers to hurt when you go to try to
[1:08:19] grab them and pull them off they want a
[1:08:21] stick they don't want to go really
[1:08:22] easily I hope you're hearing me tonight
[1:08:24] there's certain things certain feelings
[1:08:26] we have but you don't know how they
[1:08:27] looked at me you don't know what they
[1:08:29] said to me you don't know what they did
[1:08:30] to my family there are certain sticky
[1:08:32] parts about us that sometimes that
[1:08:34] stickiness just don't want to let things
[1:08:37] go it wants to hold onto things and keep
[1:08:40] building walls around it keep propping
[1:08:43] it up making excuses for it but let the
[1:08:45] wheat life on the inside let it help you
[1:08:48] pluck away all of those cockle burrs
[1:08:50] that might still be sticking on your
[1:08:53] life and hanging around your life come
[1:08:55] on church there are things that you and
[1:08:57] I may have even from our early life of
[1:09:00] things that was of no fault of our own
[1:09:01] certain things that would surround us
[1:09:04] and it was little hurts or wounds or
[1:09:06] scars or whatever and the enemy will
[1:09:08] always exploit those things like he
[1:09:12] exploits a bruise hell and cancer will
[1:09:14] thorn that's the way that the enemy will
[1:09:17] try to come and exploit those areas but
[1:09:19] you've been given wheat life on the
[1:09:21] inside a greater is he that is within
[1:09:25] you you've got power there to be able to
[1:09:28] pull those sticky parts away I like this
[1:09:36] that's a carnal nature that's going to
[1:09:39] bother you as long as you live how about
[1:09:42] you out there streaming does it bother
[1:09:44] you if it don't bother you then you got
[1:09:46] problems
[1:09:48] if you make excuses for it you got
[1:09:51] problems it ought to be things that
[1:09:53] bother you
[1:09:54] there's one guy that bothers me more
[1:09:55] than anybody that's me but you see the
[1:09:59] real me is able to make the difference
[1:10:01] between me and me are you with me how
[1:10:07] are you able to do that the word is a
[1:10:09] discerner it separates hallelujah but
[1:10:14] the inside of you you're born again and
[1:10:16] when you're raised up you're in the
[1:10:18] likeness of Christ and all the sin is
[1:10:21] gone from you that's the thing
[1:10:23] no brother man you know you've heard me
[1:10:25] speak of this in different ways and
[1:10:27] different times than a lot of other
[1:10:28] ministers and brother man he alludes to
[1:10:31] this part about that Indian chief in the
[1:10:33] same Bank or or quote or question
[1:10:36] remember the Indian chief when they
[1:10:38] asked him after he received the Holy
[1:10:40] Ghost
[1:10:40] he said they asked him how do you do he
[1:10:42] said sometimes good sometimes bad and
[1:10:44] they asked him what in the world do you
[1:10:46] mean and he said since me got the Holy
[1:10:49] Ghost he said it's like two dogs in me
[1:10:51] warring is that right now notice he goes
[1:10:56] on and brother BAM says see remember
[1:10:59] they asked the chief which one of them
[1:11:01] wins you know the black dog and went oh
[1:11:03] he said it depends on which one chief
[1:11:06] feeds the most you catch what he said
[1:11:10] it's not about which one of those dogs
[1:11:13] gets in there and bullies out the other
[1:11:15] one no the chief is the one who
[1:11:18] determines which one gets fed the most
[1:11:21] let me tell you something when the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost just come to you he is the chief
[1:11:26] Shepherd and Bishop of your soul he has
[1:11:30] entrusted you and I God will not pray
[1:11:33] for us
[1:11:33] he will not read our Bibles for us he
[1:11:36] will not listen to the message for us he
[1:11:38] will not do the personal walk for us it
[1:11:41] is something that you are I must make a
[1:11:44] decision on a daily basis and even
[1:11:47] moment-to-moment it is not something
[1:11:50] that you can even go and say well man
[1:11:53] yesterday I had a good day
[1:11:55] remember the guards were changed every
[1:11:59] four hours
[1:12:01] sometimes we get weary but the devil is
[1:12:05] just changing them out here he comes in
[1:12:08] with fresh from bombed bombardments are
[1:12:11] you with me here is this soldier that is
[1:12:15] there that Paul has chained to now I
[1:12:17] want you to think of this he said it
[1:12:19] just depends on the warring of the body
[1:12:22] that's in you it depends on which one
[1:12:25] you cater to God has never made anybody
[1:12:29] stumble in their walk God has never made
[1:12:33] any of us become cooled off or cold
[1:12:37] none God has never done that that's us
[1:12:40] God entrust us with this responsibility
[1:12:43] which Nader it all depends on which one
[1:12:46] you cater to which nature you cater to
[1:12:49] the carnal nature after the things of
[1:12:51] the world or the spiritual nature after
[1:12:53] the things of God and we just be honest
[1:12:55] with you right now when the scripture
[1:12:57] goes on to say walk in the spirit and
[1:12:59] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:13:02] flesh for the flesh lusteth against
[1:13:06] capital s PIR t the spirit and the
[1:13:11] spirit against the flesh and these are
[1:13:13] contrary the one to the other so that
[1:13:16] you cannot do the things that you would
[1:13:19] but if you be led of the Spirit ye are
[1:13:22] not under the law now in order for us to
[1:13:25] be led of the Spirit we've got to be
[1:13:26] surrendered and submissive to his will
[1:13:30] is that right we never and we never you
[1:13:33] know the Roman the Roman soldier he was
[1:13:36] never looking at Paul and as we'll look
[1:13:39] at it here Paul wrote many epistles
[1:13:41] during this time I don't know if Paul
[1:13:43] was right-handed or left-handed I don't
[1:13:45] know what she was I guess it really
[1:13:46] didn't matter because Paul would write
[1:13:48] many different epistles during this time
[1:13:51] that would express the life of Christ he
[1:13:54] would also deal with the falling away
[1:13:56] and the apostasy when he would right
[1:13:58] there within Timothy but much of it is
[1:14:00] dealing with the expression of Christian
[1:14:03] life manifestation of sons and daughters
[1:14:05] about our position in Christ Jesus not
[1:14:08] to think of it have all that would be
[1:14:10] wrote all of these letters there would
[1:14:12] be one soldier then maybe
[1:14:14] another one than another one here they
[1:14:16] were coming at different times there's
[1:14:18] not one of those soldiers are you
[1:14:19] listening to me there's not one of those
[1:14:21] soldiers got inspiration from God to
[1:14:24] write the book of Philippians there's
[1:14:26] not one of them that got inspiration to
[1:14:29] write the book of Ephesians but they
[1:14:31] were so close to the one who was
[1:14:34] receiving the direct inspiration from
[1:14:37] God that would express and make known
[1:14:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ our
[1:14:42] position in Christ Jesus can't you see
[1:14:45] that this part right here the flesh
[1:14:47] profiteth nothing but the spirit it
[1:14:50] deals with the inner man there's a part
[1:14:53] of you and me that is made to receive
[1:14:56] inspiration from the throne of God
[1:14:58] there's another part of you and I it can
[1:15:01] stay right under the inspiration all
[1:15:03] night law but it will never ever be able
[1:15:06] to receive it harness it to where it
[1:15:08] could become expressed but the inside
[1:15:11] man on the inside
[1:15:12] can see I received a direct revelation
[1:15:16] from God that comes rolling from an
[1:15:18] unseen rail it moves down there from
[1:15:21] that inside man and inspiration strikes
[1:15:24] it brother though we are here in a
[1:15:26] bondage of corruption but we are
[1:15:29] receiving messages from home the Word of
[1:15:33] God is not bound Oh glory be to God
[1:15:40] notice here the flesh lusteth against
[1:15:44] the spirit and the spirit against the
[1:15:46] flesh now watch how brother Ram will
[1:15:48] break this down in the message thirst
[1:15:50] 1965 he said there's two different kinds
[1:15:53] of thirst there is a thirst physically
[1:15:55] and there is a thirst also spiritually
[1:15:58] and he speaks he write reads that of a
[1:16:01] belief Psalms 42 my soul thirsts for God
[1:16:02] for the Living God he said now son
[1:16:05] historic or something that happened some
[1:16:07] years ago or some tale that someone told
[1:16:10] not not that but for the Living God a
[1:16:13] god that's ever-present and his soul
[1:16:18] thirsted for that God not for some
[1:16:20] historical something you see the first
[1:16:23] the first is a great blessing blessed
[1:16:26] are they who do
[1:16:27] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:16:31] for they shall be filled now we find God
[1:16:38] gives the control tower in you to give
[1:16:41] you the things that you need now the
[1:16:43] control tower in you is what directs you
[1:16:46] and you see that just as much as I do
[1:16:49] just in the natural part there are
[1:16:51] certain things you get a hankering or
[1:16:52] hunger for we say hankerin if you get
[1:16:54] something you're wanting one to eat man
[1:16:56] and you know you go to get it out
[1:16:57] refrigerator you get this I don't hit
[1:16:58] the spot did your going to get that or
[1:17:00] hit the spot then you go over it and you
[1:17:01] want this now I want that know about
[1:17:02] that now know about that and it's
[1:17:04] something you're longing for there's
[1:17:05] some sort of a craving there's some sort
[1:17:08] of a thirst that we are searching for
[1:17:10] now in the spiritual part of it God has
[1:17:13] given that controlled power that first
[1:17:15] that to give us the things that we have
[1:17:18] needed now that control tower in you is
[1:17:20] what directs you he says this thirst
[1:17:22] runs in on this control tower and tells
[1:17:25] you what you have meet how spiritually
[1:17:27] speaking the control tower in the body
[1:17:29] and in the soul also there is a control
[1:17:32] tower in the body that tells you the
[1:17:34] need that's needed in your body you
[1:17:37] don't have to tell yourself you're
[1:17:38] hungry you've got a signal on the inside
[1:17:41] you let you know I'm hungry
[1:17:43] is that right certain things that are
[1:17:44] built within certain appetites and
[1:17:47] whatever more it'll kick in and it it'll
[1:17:49] it'll pull upon that now notice that
[1:17:51] tells you that you've got need in your
[1:17:52] body it's brought to you by thirst
[1:17:54] also there is a control power in your
[1:17:57] soul that tells you the spiritual things
[1:18:00] you have need of something in your
[1:18:02] spirit so even when we're looking listen
[1:18:03] to me now even when we're looking let me
[1:18:05] Paul's here on the natural things do you
[1:18:07] realize even on the natural things we
[1:18:10] want to pass that through the filter of
[1:18:12] God's Word table does not strip all of
[1:18:15] the different desires and appetites and
[1:18:17] other things that are here job doesn't
[1:18:19] want that but remember when there goes
[1:18:20] to be a calling remember were to run
[1:18:23] that through the word so what it'll come
[1:18:25] out in a godly way are you with me now
[1:18:28] notice this here he says now he says
[1:18:31] there is a control tower in your soul
[1:18:33] that tells you the spiritual things you
[1:18:35] have need of or something in your spirit
[1:18:37] and you listen by this
[1:18:40] and tell what kind of a life is
[1:18:43] controlling you but what what are your
[1:18:46] desires on the inside when you can see
[1:18:50] what your desires are then you can tell
[1:18:52] by that what kind of a something that's
[1:18:55] in you that's creating this desire that
[1:18:58] you have so there is a certain thing you
[1:19:00] thirst for and it can tell you in your
[1:19:02] soul what your desire is by the nature
[1:19:05] of the first that you have so when a
[1:19:08] person wants to know have a pass from
[1:19:11] death unto life now remember you can say
[1:19:13] well I had an experience but let me
[1:19:15] remind you in a prisoner of Jesus class
[1:19:17] that's not the only message well brother
[1:19:19] Branham would spend a great deal of time
[1:19:20] in there in Hebrews matter-of-fact
[1:19:22] throughout all the message he would let
[1:19:24] us know that the experience is the
[1:19:27] passing from death unto life Paul listen
[1:19:30] I really don't know if anybody else
[1:19:32] maybe there's been some others brother
[1:19:33] branham different ones that would have
[1:19:34] some sort of a supernatural experience
[1:19:37] as far as they're as they see that
[1:19:38] pillar fire we know he's appeared right
[1:19:40] here we know also that he has made
[1:19:42] himself known to different ones but
[1:19:44] notice Paul Paul even in has it spoke
[1:19:46] out and said I'm Jesus whom now
[1:19:48] persecutors Paul never put his foot on
[1:19:51] that right then he went in the desert
[1:19:54] and he proved it out because any
[1:19:57] experience must match the Word of God it
[1:20:00] was more than just God revealing himself
[1:20:03] in the pillar fire but Paul had to see
[1:20:06] that that same God the reality the
[1:20:09] supernatural God that promised that he
[1:20:12] had promised Israel that it had taken
[1:20:14] place in his life when Paul walked out
[1:20:17] that supernatural experience that he had
[1:20:20] brother it was not just something that
[1:20:22] he was a part of around a meeting but it
[1:20:25] had moved into his life his desires his
[1:20:29] nature was changed Paul didn't have to
[1:20:31] wrestle and say well I still want to be
[1:20:33] a Pharisee and you know I still want to
[1:20:35] go around and do this no he was tied to
[1:20:38] that but remember when the new birth has
[1:20:41] come there's a different absolute now on
[1:20:44] the inside there you're a prayin and out
[1:20:46] of Paul's hands and
[1:20:47] well you got to turn this loose well you
[1:20:49] got to let this go Paul you got a no sir
[1:20:51] Paul was tied to a different absolute so
[1:20:54] then whatever God desired for his life
[1:20:57] Paul said thank you lord I yield myself
[1:20:59] to it a change had come on the inside he
[1:21:04] was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so you
[1:21:08] can tell by the nature that's on the
[1:21:10] inside of you what are your desires
[1:21:14] notice the control tower of the soul one
[1:21:17] for the body
[1:21:18] each tower is a warning caller for the
[1:21:22] needs of the other each one calls to the
[1:21:24] need for what the caller is calling for
[1:21:25] it sends out a wave of warning so for
[1:21:29] example for instance he said the flesh
[1:21:31] thirsts to satisfy the desires that's in
[1:21:33] the body and the spirit desires for the
[1:21:36] things that's in the soul many times
[1:21:38] these war one against another and he
[1:21:40] said that's where we find the great
[1:21:41] trouble today too many people try to
[1:21:43] live between those two desires from one
[1:21:47] of them desires the thing of the earth
[1:21:48] and the other desires a thing of heaven
[1:21:50] God don't want us live in between two
[1:21:52] desires and they just say to you right
[1:21:55] now maybe and you guys are blessed thing
[1:21:57] if you're in a place where you have not
[1:22:00] experienced that victory on the inside
[1:22:02] you know that the love the love of the
[1:22:04] world is still there the desires for the
[1:22:06] things of the world you know that that
[1:22:08] is still there then you know right now
[1:22:10] if there is something beneath that that
[1:22:12] says but yet I want to serve God I want
[1:22:15] to serve God don't try to live between
[1:22:17] the desires of the flesh and the desire
[1:22:20] that's down there in your soul
[1:22:21] ask God to come and quick in that desire
[1:22:24] you say what do I do you that desire is
[1:22:26] quickened by our surrendering God will
[1:22:29] never override our own human will he did
[1:22:34] not drag his son to Calvary against his
[1:22:37] own will are you with me
[1:22:40] the only way that the lamb went was by a
[1:22:43] surrendered will the only way death can
[1:22:46] come and the new birth come is by a
[1:22:48] surrendered will
[1:22:51] is that wrapped but there's a warning
[1:22:53] collar that goes out so let's say here
[1:22:56] that the body you know here are the soul
[1:22:59] the soul begins to say you know what I
[1:23:02] want to I want to go pray that begins to
[1:23:05] move forth it sends out there a call but
[1:23:08] the body says no
[1:23:10] you're too tired your knees hurt well
[1:23:15] what do my knees have to do with praying
[1:23:17] I can pray on my knees pray standing
[1:23:19] Paul said standing
[1:23:20] I can pray on my face I can pray Paul
[1:23:24] says always that means if I'm walking in
[1:23:26] the middle of Walmart
[1:23:27] I can pray is that right so prayer is
[1:23:31] not a condition of the body it's a
[1:23:33] condition of the heart is that right so
[1:23:37] it relieves us a tradition to know that
[1:23:39] prayer itself you know prayer it's not
[1:23:41] just the words coming out of our mouth
[1:23:42] prayer is even the meditation of our
[1:23:44] heart when you begin to meditate get
[1:23:47] quiet because in prayer many times
[1:23:50] prayer is just it's just pray words
[1:23:52] afterwards afterwards afterwards but
[1:23:54] that's not real prayer the prayer always
[1:23:55] starts with worship then notice the
[1:23:57] Bible will always bring together prayer
[1:23:59] and supplications prayer is the worship
[1:24:02] prayer is the praise that goes up to him
[1:24:05] for who he is and then the supplication
[1:24:07] our requests that are to follow the
[1:24:10] worship for who he is but you notice
[1:24:13] here this this outside God will say
[1:24:15] you're too tired you're too weak uh you
[1:24:17] know what it's time to go to church or
[1:24:19] it's time to log in Oh we'll just catch
[1:24:21] it tomorrow you know oh you know God is
[1:24:23] so good he understands but you remember
[1:24:25] you've got to remember here if you're
[1:24:27] really if you if you're a real prisoner
[1:24:29] of Jesus Christ God is not going to
[1:24:32] bring that room and in subjection for
[1:24:33] you you've got to bring that room in in
[1:24:36] subjection and let me just tell you
[1:24:37] something
[1:24:38] it isn't just something on church days
[1:24:40] if you feel or we feel our life with a
[1:24:43] lot of carnal stuff of the world I'm not
[1:24:45] talking about watching awful movies and
[1:24:47] this and that I'm not even talking about
[1:24:49] that I'm talking about where you
[1:24:51] actually starve that white dog on the
[1:24:53] inside by feeling your life with so many
[1:24:56] other things and this is going on and
[1:24:58] this is going on I'll tell you it ought
[1:25:00] to be a heart's desire but not just when
[1:25:02] I walk back through those doors when
[1:25:04] they allow us to come back in here but
[1:25:06] while I'm at home right now in my life
[1:25:09] I want that white dog to be a big fat
[1:25:11] dog I want that black dog to be smaller
[1:25:14] skinner skinnier than a chihuahua
[1:25:16] brother I want his bones to be showing
[1:25:19] where I have starved him to death and
[1:25:22] had that white dog and that's what it is
[1:25:24] with you and I hi it requires who you
[1:25:27] and I will cater to cuz this let me just
[1:25:34] tell you the Roman when Paul would have
[1:25:37] the room and say come over here Paul
[1:25:40] what are you gonna do the inspiration
[1:25:43] for me to write right here Paul come on
[1:25:45] you just man you just wasn't writing how
[1:25:49] long you wrote how many chapters you
[1:25:51] wrote and then you had that nut pencil
[1:25:53] on your thing and you look like you was
[1:25:55] out somewhere in la-la land down there
[1:25:57] and then all sudden you'd come back in
[1:25:58] and write oh come on man why do I gotta
[1:26:00] come over there right now II can't you
[1:26:02] just write at any time but you see you
[1:26:04] can't turn inspiration on and all to a
[1:26:07] child of God a mind so Paul he would say
[1:26:11] no this is right here you got to come
[1:26:13] over here remember Paul did not have to
[1:26:15] obey that Roman that Roman was given
[1:26:18] there with a chain and that Roman had to
[1:26:21] call where Paul wins and I'll tell you
[1:26:23] Paul had to get to a place he wasn't
[1:26:26] ashamed where he went he packed that
[1:26:28] Roman with him when it came time to
[1:26:30] raise his hands he raised his hands and
[1:26:32] when he did the hands of the Roman went
[1:26:35] up in the air why they were chained
[1:26:37] together they were chained together the
[1:26:41] Roman had to do what Paul did and I'll
[1:26:44] tell you if the spirit that raised up
[1:26:47] Jesus Christ from the grave if it well
[1:26:49] in you it shall also quicken your mortal
[1:26:53] body it brings that outside man subject
[1:26:57] to the word this is why that inside man
[1:27:03] there's got to be a change because the
[1:27:05] worshiper once he's purged has no more
[1:27:08] desire for sin it's not know if I can
[1:27:11] keep myself from this oh if I can keep
[1:27:13] myself I better not look at this and I
[1:27:14] better not do this know what you need to
[1:27:16] do is get real Liberty you need to get
[1:27:19] real Liberty where it takes the very
[1:27:21] desire out of you and puts a good a
[1:27:27] better one a stronger one on the inside
[1:27:29] the Bible goes on to say first John 2:15
[1:27:32] love not the world neither the things
[1:27:33] that are in the world
[1:27:35] men love the world the love of the
[1:27:36] father is not in him notice how he dealt
[1:27:38] with this you cannot have the love of
[1:27:40] the world and the love of the Father
[1:27:42] they won't cohabitate it's either one
[1:27:46] love or the other Jesus taught it no man
[1:27:49] can serve two masters it's all right
[1:27:50] brother Burleigh preached it right here
[1:27:53] in January you can't serve two masters
[1:27:55] you can't do that you can't be bitter
[1:27:58] and sweet water coming out is that right
[1:28:01] it's cotton when it's the love of the
[1:28:03] Father on the inside that right there is
[1:28:06] a desire that you know on the inside
[1:28:09] the love of the world's gone this is why
[1:28:14] Paul would go on to write in Romans 8:1
[1:28:18] I'm trying to come down there is
[1:28:20] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:28:23] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:28:25] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[1:28:28] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:28:30] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:28:32] sin and death for what the law could not
[1:28:34] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:28:37] let me just tell you like this right
[1:28:39] here not only was the law weak but even
[1:28:42] listen to me now the message that God
[1:28:44] has sent us if it doesn't ever grow go
[1:28:47] any deeper than the flesh the learning
[1:28:50] of the doctrines come on now I'm quoting
[1:28:52] come follow thou mean 1963 preached to a
[1:28:55] group of graduates out there in Phoenix
[1:28:57] brother Graham says oh he says I think
[1:28:59] we've studied the message and it's
[1:29:01] become like theology to us he said that
[1:29:03] that won't do you've got to meet the
[1:29:05] person of Jesus Christ this message has
[1:29:08] got to be more than doctrines it's got
[1:29:11] to be more than truth you've got to meet
[1:29:13] the person of Jesus Christ himself to
[1:29:17] where it becomes the message of life to
[1:29:19] you where it has breathed life into your
[1:29:22] soul but all the liberty that comes with
[1:29:27] this message if you're just yield
[1:29:29] because when the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:29:31] there is Liberty brother this message
[1:29:34] calls you to Liberty if you just let go
[1:29:38] it'll take you to what God is calling
[1:29:41] you to to what the desire you have in
[1:29:43] your life in that it was weak through
[1:29:45] the flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:29:48] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:29:50] condemned sin in the flesh aren't you
[1:29:53] glad he paid that price that you and I
[1:29:56] could walk free he paid the necessary
[1:29:58] judgement that the righteousness of the
[1:30:01] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[1:30:04] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:30:07] for they they they that are after the
[1:30:11] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[1:30:12] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:30:14] things of the Spirit
[1:30:16] for to be carnally minded is death but
[1:30:18] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:30:19] peace oh but he says ye verse 9 are not
[1:30:23] in the flesh but in the spirit if so be
[1:30:26] but the Spirit of God dwell in you and
[1:30:32] if Christ verse 10 be in you the body is
[1:30:36] dead because of sin but the Spirit is
[1:30:41] life because of righteousness
[1:30:46] you know the scripture goes on to tell
[1:30:49] us we've got an anchor within the veil
[1:30:52] there's a forerunner that's went Jesus
[1:30:55] Christ the righteous the life has come
[1:30:58] back upon our lives the brother man will
[1:31:01] take this scripture right here and to
[1:31:03] bring it right around to our lives and
[1:31:05] says do you realize what's behind your
[1:31:07] veil is an anchor
[1:31:09] he said because remember he said it's
[1:31:11] this veil that keeps us from seeing God
[1:31:14] who's in this place
[1:31:15] he said it's this veil who keeps us from
[1:31:18] seeing the angels but it goes on to
[1:31:20] declare it to us he says now remember
[1:31:22] you're always in the prints of God and
[1:31:24] he quotes the scriptures lo
[1:31:25] I'm with the always I'll never leave you
[1:31:27] no forsake you on and on through the
[1:31:28] Scriptures he quotes but you know what
[1:31:30] happens this veil remember the veil is
[1:31:33] by feelings the veil itself sometimes
[1:31:36] you don't feel is that right sometimes
[1:31:39] when we don't feel but you see God
[1:31:41] trains us even in the times where we
[1:31:43] don't feel remember feeling itself it's
[1:31:45] not what our faith is based on there's
[1:31:47] not one of us that don't love to feel
[1:31:49] God and feel the presence of God but
[1:31:51] remember there are times where we've got
[1:31:52] to stand upon God's Word when there
[1:31:54] ain't no feeling all around this is
[1:31:56] where trust and perfect faith comes into
[1:31:59] play when we don't have any feeling when
[1:32:01] there's no feeling like the Hebrew
[1:32:03] children that's one example but we've
[1:32:05] got to stand on thus saith the LORD why
[1:32:07] because his presence is abiding in us
[1:32:10] and we are in him so it's this veil that
[1:32:13] keeps us from seeing God but RAM said
[1:32:15] it's this veil that keeps us here from
[1:32:17] actually living the way we should
[1:32:19] it's the veil that keeps it from doing
[1:32:21] the things that we really want to do is
[1:32:23] that right I want to ask you how many of
[1:32:25] you sitting out there in front of your
[1:32:26] computer tablet phone or whatever now
[1:32:28] how many of you said you know what man I
[1:32:30] were I really wish I'd have done that
[1:32:31] this day or this week or or this or that
[1:32:33] and what is it the Veil the veil gets in
[1:32:36] the way we're not making excuses for it
[1:32:38] but we realize hey wait a minute here I
[1:32:40] cannot let that veil have the right away
[1:32:42] there's times I've got to bring it over
[1:32:44] there when that Roman soldier when he
[1:32:47] says no no no I don't want I don't want
[1:32:49] no more inspiration I don't want you to
[1:32:50] get over there and write them letters
[1:32:52] I don't want to do that right now why
[1:32:53] because that that soldier that Roman
[1:32:57] soldier still has that carnal sticky
[1:33:00] nature that Roman soldier is the one
[1:33:02] that says remember so-and-so I mean what
[1:33:04] so-and-so says I'll tell you right now
[1:33:06] he's preaching on you I'll tell you
[1:33:07] right now you know what they said you
[1:33:09] know how your wife you know she said
[1:33:10] that nah she looked at you boy you ought
[1:33:12] to just straighten her out right now you
[1:33:13] remember how your husband said this
[1:33:15] night what gets on that that ain't the
[1:33:17] son and daughter of God on the inside
[1:33:19] because the son and daughter of God on
[1:33:20] the inside is one that's a lover of
[1:33:22] peace come on somebody it's a love for a
[1:33:25] peace but that outside man gets sticky
[1:33:27] and it wants to keep bringing things up
[1:33:28] and you did this and you did that you
[1:33:30] know what the sticky guy wants to do it
[1:33:32] gets stuck on something
[1:33:34] ooh and it keeps on bringing it up and
[1:33:38] you think could you get over it come on
[1:33:42] somebody now but we gotta I've gotta
[1:33:43] have this hammered out right here I've
[1:33:45] got it but remember what is that sticky
[1:33:47] part of our life but remember God gives
[1:33:50] us grace on the inside of we can
[1:33:52] recognize it it's that sticky part that
[1:33:55] actually if we allow it to go on it
[1:33:57] hinders the love of God from propagating
[1:33:59] out into our spirit and moving over to
[1:34:03] bring our body in subjection but what do
[1:34:06] we want to do let the inward man have
[1:34:09] the right away it's kind of like when
[1:34:13] you're out there on a construction site
[1:34:14] you're driving down the road all of a
[1:34:16] sudden you see the guys standing there
[1:34:18] with the sign right and he has on he can
[1:34:22] put it once they're slow flips it elves
[1:34:24] are stopped is that right
[1:34:26] and remember there's only one lane of
[1:34:28] traffic open only one can proceed you
[1:34:32] can't get both ways of traffic not both
[1:34:34] ways are open right now so there's only
[1:34:37] one way that holds somebody there's only
[1:34:40] one way so what has to happen well hell
[1:34:43] you can show up there and say I think I
[1:34:45] got here man I've got here first
[1:34:47] I'm going faster I've got it that it
[1:34:50] becomes our way and here here here here
[1:34:53] here the towers going out on the inside
[1:34:56] stop stop will say that stop stop don't
[1:34:58] do that stop what the Spirit of God but
[1:35:01] bless our on the inside it's clear now
[1:35:03] hey hey hey don't do that
[1:35:04] hey hey don't do that hey
[1:35:05] that way before you even say anything
[1:35:07] it's picking up the vibrations that are
[1:35:10] there like a lie detector can pick it up
[1:35:13] the inside man picks it up and says
[1:35:15] you're not in a condition this is not
[1:35:17] right
[1:35:17] don't go that way it's vibrating on the
[1:35:20] inside but the Roman says come on let's
[1:35:22] go come on let's go but the inward man
[1:35:24] is buzzing there on the outside don't go
[1:35:27] that way don't go that way don't go that
[1:35:29] way
[1:35:36] what should we do see what the sign says
[1:35:40] do science says stop
[1:35:50] stop
[1:35:52] stop
[1:35:56] lord help me
[1:35:57] temper my spirit temper my heart it's
[1:36:03] not right Lord it's not writing right
[1:36:06] now a temperate father
[1:36:12] and then it turns slowly and you're able
[1:36:17] to ease on out in there and slowly going
[1:36:23] around the obstacle there's obstacles
[1:36:25] that we come in contact with over and
[1:36:30] over
[1:36:36] Paul said in Romans 6 neither yield ye
[1:36:42] yourselves instruments to
[1:36:46] unrighteousness they yield your
[1:36:49] instruments to righteousness as those
[1:36:54] that are alive unto God from the dead
[1:36:58] instruments our spirit my body yielded
[1:37:06] to righteousness
[1:37:11] yield it is the key
[1:37:17] captivity can do a great thing
[1:37:24] we see it here and constantly his
[1:37:28] brother Brandon would put it like this
[1:37:29] in perfect strength he says that many
[1:37:31] times in the message
[1:37:33] but Allah Kylie says it and the message
[1:37:35] perfect strength remember how God would
[1:37:38] come to Paul and Paul would write about
[1:37:42] this where he had asked God three times
[1:37:44] take this away from me
[1:37:47] it was that where his eyes are brother
[1:37:50] Ram would tell us it wasn't a besetting
[1:37:53] sin
[1:37:55] Paul's eyes brother brems said they
[1:37:56] would come and go certain things God
[1:37:59] would touch his body his eyes you'd be
[1:38:01] able to see real good then you find like
[1:38:04] when he wrote in the book of Galatians
[1:38:05] he said you see how I've wrote him with
[1:38:07] written with large letters his eyesight
[1:38:11] mother bream said his eyesight was never
[1:38:12] the same since he's seen a pillar of
[1:38:16] fire and how that the enemy a messenger
[1:38:20] of Satan would come and buffeting
[1:38:23] blow after blow not on not all the time
[1:38:26] not every day but there would be times
[1:38:29] where it would come to buffeting why by
[1:38:32] God knew that Paul needed help to keep
[1:38:38] this Roman in subjection because this
[1:38:43] Roman can get in just a moment's I won't
[1:38:48] even say a snap just real quick he can
[1:38:51] go right into the channel of pride and
[1:38:54] with all that God had showed to Paul God
[1:38:58] said I've got to keep him in a place so
[1:39:01] he can reflect this so it can be
[1:39:04] reflected through himself God to remind
[1:39:06] him and help him it wasn't that palme
[1:39:08] the inside did not didn't know that he
[1:39:11] needed he needed the help with the Lord
[1:39:12] he did he said we got this treasure in
[1:39:14] earthen vessels that the excellency may
[1:39:16] be of the power of God and not us he
[1:39:18] knew that but you see just knowing it
[1:39:21] even though he was the prophet of God
[1:39:23] full of the Holy Ghost he needed help
[1:39:27] this is what Paul would say when I'm
[1:39:30] weak then I'm strong the RAM says from
[1:39:36] the riches from the riches of us to the
[1:39:41] poorest of us from the lowest to the
[1:39:44] highest
[1:39:45] he said it's us that keeps God out of
[1:39:48] our lives us beginning god it's us it's
[1:39:55] us and then he makes the familiar
[1:39:59] statement that you and I've heard many
[1:40:01] times notice how he words it if I can
[1:40:05] get William Brennan out of the way
[1:40:13] I can get my wheel out of the way if I
[1:40:16] can get my direction my way my thoughts
[1:40:19] my opinions my abyss but then goes
[1:40:21] through a whole litany of things in that
[1:40:23] particular quote he says then when that
[1:40:26] can happen notice not God get him out of
[1:40:27] the way Lord Jesus you come get my
[1:40:29] faults other way no you have to get him
[1:40:31] out of the way what brothers saying I
[1:40:33] might buy those thoughts that seems so
[1:40:34] hard right now what dog you been feeding
[1:40:39] it's Paul the little skinny guy and the
[1:40:41] Romans a big chunk
[1:40:46] you need to fatten up the paul on the
[1:40:49] inside hallelujah brother harun if
[1:40:55] you're listening that's the reality he
[1:40:58] prepared me a table in the presence of
[1:41:00] mine enemies
[1:41:02] this guy on the inside is feasting on
[1:41:05] the Word of God and this kind the
[1:41:08] outside sometimes this guy could get
[1:41:09] around say don't you feel like you need
[1:41:11] to go the bathroom don't you feel like
[1:41:12] you need not not that's it so it's okay
[1:41:13] to go to the bathroom but you know
[1:41:15] sometimes they didn't get the moving on
[1:41:16] this outer guy sometimes we have to
[1:41:19] learn you know what I shouldn't have
[1:41:21] drunk that an extra cup of coffee before
[1:41:23] I come here because it's causing me to
[1:41:25] leave when the preaching is going on
[1:41:28] what happens you're learning not to
[1:41:31] allow that soldier that's chained to you
[1:41:35] to control you but you see you take even
[1:41:39] the natural appetites of it and you
[1:41:41] funnel it right through and say women I
[1:41:43] know you'd like another cup but we're
[1:41:45] going to the house of God and I ain't
[1:41:47] leaving when the song service is over
[1:41:49] matter of fact today I'm changing my
[1:41:51] routine when song service is over I'm
[1:41:54] sitting right here in the pew and I'm
[1:41:55] waiting on the Word of God come on
[1:41:58] somebody
[1:41:59] you see it's where we start telling the
[1:42:02] Roman son rob somebody
[1:42:04] this is how things are going to be I'm
[1:42:06] not tied to you you're tied to me as
[1:42:08] long as I'm here in this slot you're
[1:42:10] gonna do what I tell you to do if I say
[1:42:13] we're going to church we're going to
[1:42:14] church if I say we're reading we're
[1:42:16] reading we're praying even if you fuss
[1:42:18] and complain and hold my knees are
[1:42:20] hurting oh this is certain hold my back
[1:42:22] you know what I'll lay in the bed and
[1:42:24] pray then but I'm still gonna have
[1:42:26] contact with God
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:31] when I can get he says william branham
[1:42:34] out of the way
[1:42:35] he said then Jesus can come and have a
[1:42:39] good and do things far beyond that of
[1:42:46] William Branham aren't you glad for this
[1:42:51] deliverance aren't you glad that you can
[1:42:54] look and say
[1:42:56] that's what I used to have on the inside
[1:42:58] of me I used to have an old Roman nature
[1:43:01] on the inside of me I don't have a Roman
[1:43:03] nature in the water I'm a child of God
[1:43:05] on the inside aren't you glad there's a
[1:43:07] war aren't you glad that that old carnal
[1:43:10] sticky nature bothers you and aren't you
[1:43:15] glad for the Spirit of God on the inside
[1:43:17] that says no peace pact
[1:43:19] no compromise let's pray father we thank
[1:43:25] you tonight for your mercy Lord Oh God
[1:43:32] Lord - look at this when you just spoke
[1:43:36] to my heart I begin to look at these
[1:43:38] things have been studying or for weeks
[1:43:42] looking at these parts with Paul or he
[1:43:45] would write in these prison epistles we
[1:43:50] see the part Lord that here he is in
[1:43:52] Rome he was there I would say when Paul
[1:43:57] would speak and even write in Romans
[1:43:58] chapter 1 it's for sure he desired to go
[1:44:02] there but many times he said when I got
[1:44:05] when I wanted to go there the way was
[1:44:07] hindered everything is always in your
[1:44:10] timing the Lord I would say just like
[1:44:14] many of us this was a circumstance that
[1:44:17] Paul found himself in
[1:44:20] that was not because of his doing he was
[1:44:24] clear in these scriptures between the
[1:44:26] one that we open with tonight and those
[1:44:28] last two verses and acts he lay he let
[1:44:31] those jews that he gathered their first
[1:44:32] even the father's among the Jews and
[1:44:35] would speak of to them of the hope of
[1:44:37] Israel the redemption that which is made
[1:44:39] known through Isaiah fulfilled through
[1:44:41] Jesus Christ as he would make known of
[1:44:44] those things Lord God Paul himself no
[1:44:46] doubt he never thought about there would
[1:44:48] be the circumstances he never thought
[1:44:51] Lord God that here he would be in a
[1:44:53] house hired house though he had more
[1:44:57] Liberty as far as not being in a prison
[1:44:58] but he had a Roman soldier chained to
[1:45:02] him every four hours there would be a
[1:45:05] relieving of that Roman soldier of fresh
[1:45:08] life a new one would come Lord what it
[1:45:14] shows me which we know as believers but
[1:45:18] what it makes us know very clearly this
[1:45:20] is why the inward and then man needs to
[1:45:22] be removed this is why we need as Paul
[1:45:25] would write in Romans 12 a renewing of
[1:45:28] our mind we need renewed he would write
[1:45:30] Lord in the book of Titus we need a
[1:45:32] renewing by the Holy Ghost
[1:45:33] we need renewing we need Lord God truly
[1:45:38] if there's anybody listening tonight
[1:45:40] Lord that has not been born of the
[1:45:42] Spirit of God and they find themselves
[1:45:44] Lord God's steel with the love of the
[1:45:46] world in their life I pray tonight Lord
[1:45:48] God may they realize the simplicity of
[1:45:50] it it's simply yielding to you
[1:45:53] it's simply giving over and say Lord I'm
[1:45:56] tired of this I want to serve you food
[1:45:59] I'm tired of acting tired of going
[1:46:01] through the drills I don't want I want
[1:46:04] to serve you I want you to be the Lord
[1:46:05] of my life father when a sincere heart
[1:46:08] will call out in that way that they are
[1:46:10] ready to die you come you'll step
[1:46:14] forward and Lord Jesus from where that
[1:46:16] you have stepped may be Lord right into
[1:46:19] the very edge of their life
[1:46:21] as their Savior but you want to be lord
[1:46:25] you want to have control over every door
[1:46:28] of their life of our lives or these
[1:46:34] circumstances that we are in
[1:46:39] oh god I never thought it would be this
[1:46:42] way that Here I am i preaching lord god
[1:46:46] to a church that's intended my lord god
[1:46:50] just right here in front of me Lord
[1:46:52] enough Lord of thee of individuals just
[1:46:55] to simply man the slides of them and the
[1:46:58] different Lord the streaming recording
[1:47:01] cameras just a few people and yet many
[1:47:04] and Lord God the Saints here they are
[1:47:06] streaming on the Internet I never
[1:47:08] thought I never imagined it this way
[1:47:12] annoyed this circumstance is not going
[1:47:17] to hinder the Word of God it didn't
[1:47:20] hinder the Word of God when Paul was
[1:47:22] there Oh Lord God what inspiration came
[1:47:27] to him
[1:47:28] may we I pray Lord like children of God
[1:47:31] may we not allow the circumstances to
[1:47:33] hinder the inspiration
[1:47:34] Daniel was down there in Babylon but
[1:47:37] Daniel did not let the setting where he
[1:47:39] was at hinder him from receiving
[1:47:42] inspiration from God David Daniel made
[1:47:45] himself available to you may we Lord God
[1:47:50] I pray in these times Lord as we are
[1:47:52] praying for this virus to pass praying
[1:47:54] Lord God that you would Lord Jesus help
[1:47:57] them Lord the different ones Lord as
[1:47:59] they're looking and researching Lord in
[1:48:01] trying to find a vaccine because we know
[1:48:03] that's what's going to ease the minds of
[1:48:05] the people to even be able to release
[1:48:07] different ones and go back to work and
[1:48:09] all these things Lord it's it's there
[1:48:11] it's all around us and we ask you Lord
[1:48:13] like our prophet would stand there and
[1:48:15] say as a Christian Lord we would pray
[1:48:17] for it Lord God the cure for cancer we
[1:48:20] would pray for different cures ask you
[1:48:22] Lord that you would help them Lord God
[1:48:24] to be able to tap into that Lord that
[1:48:27] would help suffering humanity Lord Jesus
[1:48:29] our desire is to be able to be gathered
[1:48:32] together Lord old brothers of people of
[1:48:35] God that I pray father that even in the
[1:48:38] midst of this time may it be so real to
[1:48:41] every heart then Lord to let them know
[1:48:43] they don't have to be sitting in this
[1:48:45] church to be born again they don't have
[1:48:47] to be sent here Lord to receive
[1:48:49] deliverance Lord oh God to realize Lord
[1:48:52] the power of God the Word of God is not
[1:48:55] bound Lord God you can go right to where

[1:49:30] little mama daddy
[1:49:31] Lord God can lay their hands on one
[1:49:33] another or on their children
[1:49:35] Oh Lord Kanha it's not our hands but
[1:49:38] Lord God is the quickening power of God
[1:49:40] that moves within our body Lord God that
