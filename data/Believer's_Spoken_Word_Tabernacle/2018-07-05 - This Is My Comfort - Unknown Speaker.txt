to the people uplifting strengthening on a parade your God we asked us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to the glory of God amen if you could turn me in your Bibles to one to me on down to the 92nd verse unless the law had been my delights I should then have perished in my affliction I will never forget thy precepts for with them down as quicken me I am dying save me for I have sought thy precepts the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but I will consider thy testimonies you may be seated we as human we look people look for comfort in many different things there are some people that look for comfort in sickness it might seem strange but there is a word for that it's called hypochondriac and as long as they got something they're okay they've always got to have something wrong with them and you realize that one of the things that's anxiety that actually brings on these false symptoms that they feel and you know used to be they would have a home health care encyclopedias now they got Google now they can ask Siri you know tell them this is what I'm feeling it and there's a disease for every occasion and there's an illness for every symptom there are people who take comfort and in things like David one time took comfort in he was hit away from solving men when saul was chasing David and David took refuge in a cave to hide from Saul and then while David and his men are hid in this cave why salt comes there and salt Kampf right down at the cave and actually lays himself down to sleep right there in the cave David says in the Psalms when that happened he said my refuge has failed me and people take refuge or comfort in a lot of different things and these other things fail them there are some people who take refuge in your job in a job you know being able to provide for themselves is what they feel like and then they lose that job and now they don't have that refuge there are some people who take refuge and money they take comfort in having money money money can fail you it can run out there are people that take comfort in money and maybe perhaps have enough to where that they'll never run out in their lifetime but without Christ their refuge has failed them because when you come down to the end you can't take none of it with you and it won't buy you anything on the other side but the Brenham says man's always tried to find some way to save himself right here it is that's his nature in the Garden of Eden the man as soon as he found out he was lost he made himself a religion a fig leaf apron and put it over him that's the strain of man yet today even after 4000 years yes nearly 6,000 years man still trying to cover his own sins by his own merits he'll quit eating meat there's a lot of that going on today well could eating meat just eat all vegetables and you'll be better than theirs they've got many of people that you can read about in the news of a swear by this and how much better their life is and how much better they're feeling brother Brown says that here he said there could eating meat and they'll keep all kinds of days and he'll tear himself down he will try everything he can to save himself when it's so simple that even a fool couldn't fail to find it that's right the Bible says so just simply by grace are you saved through faith yet he will try to mystify it have all kinds of seen lights and hearing sounds and everything and all kinds of mystifying things to get people to be saved there's only one way to be saved jesus said I'm the way the truth the life but David writes here what we read in our text and saw that his comfort was the word had quickened him in his afflictions this was his comfort the word had quickened him he wasn't looking for sympathy from someone else there are times when people will face things and I think I might have said there's some Sunday I'm not sure but they will they'll call up somebody else looking for somebody to sympathize with what they're going through and try to find some kind of comfort in the fact that somebody else would say oh poor you but David said his comfort was in the word had quickened him in officience chapter 2 Paul writes a new hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in time past she walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lusts of our flesh the fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in mercy for his great love we're in he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and it's raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so we've been quickened from trespasses and sins we should be able to take comfort in that that's what David saying I take comfort in that the word has quickened me we take comfort in knowing our destination we're not going to find any comfort here in this world and this world is a comfort seeking type of world and as I said people are seeking that comfort in many different types of things to try to lose themselves or or to escape from the things that are troubling their minds but we as the Bride of Christ ought to be able to look and say I know I've been quickened I know that he called me he ordained me this is where I find my security this is where I find my refuge this is my comfort before I know no man did it and in joining the church but it's joining Christ Jesus letting Christ come into your life and he said we were dead in sins but he hath quickened us in Christ hallelujah I like this he writes in Colossians chapter 2 verse 13 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses I haven't forgiven you all trespasses Satan will try to plug your mind through the gate of your memory with things that you had done or committed but this says we have been forgiven all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of the Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so all of our trespasses our sins the handwriting as the Bible says that was against us has been nailed to the cross we should be able to take comfort in that amen knowing that will not have to face those things the Bible says that there is coming a day of judgment and it said every man will appear in his body and give account for the sins which he committed in the body says I believe it's in 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 but we have a new body our bodies will be changed will not be in this body in this condition that it's in and it's bill all because he nailed it all to the cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it the battle is already won you know when we lose is when we try to do it ourselves we try to take it into our own hands that's when we lose but he's already won for us we're already victors we already have the victory brother Branham says he was talking into message of God's who's rich in mercy he was talking about his little story about the Eagle the little Eagle it that was hatched under a chicken and and how that it was scratching around in the barnyard not knowing what it was and trying to eat like the chickens were eating because it was born there but then one day said that great eagle flew over and screamed looking for that little one and when I heard that scream it wakened something within that little eaglet and it caused it to jump up on the fence post and begin to spread its wings and then took off soared into the heavens all because that it it became to itself to realize what it really was something that was in that screen spoke to him didn't speak to any of the other birds but it spoke to him and brother Branham says that's the way it is with every born-again believer you can hear all the theology you want to and all the man-made discrepancies but when the word flashes out there there's something that takes ahold you come to it you were once dead in sin that life has he quickened there has to be a life there to to quicken to first so when you were born there was a life in you there's more than this life and it's quickened when you heard the word it brought something that brought a change in you something that felt like came alive that there had to be a life there first in order for something to be quickened and God by his foreknowledge knowed all things and we were predestinated to be sons and daughters of God see he connects this with this God's foreknowledge there's some people that stumble with these things and say well there's some does it mean that they don't have a choice no everyone has a choice everyone has a choice but God being all-knowing knows what you're going to choose and therefore can predestinate means your Destiny's already determined I I don't see a problem with that if you're gonna if I'm gonna go somewhere I've got to know what my destination is going to be I don't don't get on a plane and say wherever you take me well when you book an airline ticket why you booked it from where you're at to where you're going to and you know where you're going to so our destinies been predetermined we got a flight that's going to take out of here and go straight to heaven we are predestinated to be sons and daughters of God ye who were once dead in sins and trespasses we're in all had our times past but hath he quickened and brother Branham goes on to say look at Paul he was a great theologian but when he came face-to-face with the word Jesus in the light it quickened him he come to life right quick because he was ordained to be that you realize you were ordained to be where you're at you were getting to be what you are if you are a born-again believer filled with the Holy Ghost you are gain for that and if God has called you and you say well I don't know that I haven't received a whole negotiate but if God has called you you're ordained to receive the Holy Ghost talking more about Paul he said he was a part of the word brother Branham says in one message he says in the back parts of God's mind he had some thoughts that he was wanting to manifest those thoughts were redeemable thoughts those thoughts were you and I that he would in the age to come in the right season you would be born you would come forth and you would be quickened by the Word of God in the season God had preordained for you he was part of the word meaning there was part of if you are a part of God then you always had to be a part of God you were born a part of God you may not have known but once you came in contact with the word there was something that changed in you there was something that that that spoke to and the word saw the world and all the clucking of the hens and the Orthodox churches didn't effective have no effect upon him he saw the word and it was part of him I one time went and was on a round to Easter time I went and I bought some ducks some little ducklings and they were just little fuzzy little yellow looking things and and they seemed real fragile and I took an eye I bought a container to put them in to keep them and while they were little and put a light in there you know to shine on a little to give him some warmth so they wouldn't be cold and they had water to drink and had food to eat but then one day I bought him a bigger container they were still pretty small they still were yellow in color and I bought him a bigger container and then I bought this little tub that would fit in that container and I put some water in it now that little ducts had been hatched in an incubator because the kind of ducks say words of Peking Duck they call him and those ducks will not sit on their eggs they're a heavy duck and could perhaps even crush their own eggs if they tried to sit on them so to get these ducks you've got a hatch him in an incubator and so these ducklings had come out of an incubator had never been around a mother duck had never been around water except for a little bit of water that was in a special container where they could get around and drink out of it but when I put that tub of water in there something happened to them little ducklings and one of them I guess must have been the leader took off straight for that water just as fast as he could go and it wasn't good enough for him just to get in it he would dive down to the bottom in that little tub and will you see him dive down the bottom and just moving those feet and just going down through the water and he was like look more like a fish than a duck brother Brennan tells a story about that now he said a duck that was hatched in a chicken yard he said he'd never knew anything about water and something strikes because when you go to buy these ducklings buy them in place like TSE or someplace like that and they'll have other containers of chickens in their little chicks and they're eat now the same type of container the Ducks treat now to other drinking out of the same kind of containers the Ducks are drinking out over so they're treating these ducks like chickens brother Brown said this little duckling it was born in chicken yard he didn't know any different except that one day he smelled water and he took off of that water just as hard as he could go brother branham said he had never been on a pond before he had never been in the water but he was a duck to begin with you ever heard that saying like a duck to water ducks have to have water they have to keep their feathers cleaned and and they have to keep oil that they spread throughout their feathers so that it makes him boy in the water just roll off you've heard the same like water off a duck's back a lot of those sayings you've ever heard about ducks I've seen they are true and brother bream said but he was a duck to begin with the only thing he had to do was come to himself and that's the same thing to believer is there's something in him that when he meets God faced the faith he faced he comes to himself that seed in him is quickened I've had someone come to me one time and they were saying no they you weren't born with that seed in you state they had been in brother branham's meetings as individual they said brother Branham put that seed in me I said no he didn't because that's against even when he preaches I've had other people come see my pastor put that seed in me no he didn't if you have that seat of God that you were born with it God put it there no man gave it to you no man can take it away the devil didn't give it to you and he can't take it away the devil cannot do one thing about your predestination he can't stop you from going to heaven because you're ordained to go there my that's right he says he flies away from the things of the world they become dead to him my I remember we all had our life in the past and those things of the world but once we got a hold of that real thing something that quickened us a little seed that come to life then all the things of the world rotted right there we had no more desire of often think of the story of the woman at the well I like how in John and Jesus says I have need to go by Samaria I love that statement I have need to go by Samaria why do you have need because there was a redeemable thought down there but it was the woman at the well she was a Samaritan she was half two and half Gentile she was a Samaritan the Jews didn't have anything to do with those people but jesus said I have need to go by there you may have been sitting in some other Church in some other place but one day Jesus said I've got need to go by there and there was something in you that seemed like it just wasn't being satisfied and so you went searching everybody is searching but sometimes brother Brown says they take the things of the world and try to to quench that thirst that God put in him for himself but there was something that you couldn't be satisfied with that the other man says in another place said maybe while you were growing up you you would go and do certain things he said but it seemed like there was something that kept you from going any further and he said you would see others do those things and was like it had just rolled right off there meant nothing but to you you felt a little something you and it was more than just some morals or something in you what was it it was that seed it was the the part of the word that was in that woman she come to the well at a time when it was later a little bit later in the day the afternoon after all the maidens and and different women had already been to the well and left then she came because the Bible says she was a ill-famed woman but you know Jesus never one time even though he discerned those things he never condemned her he never said because of these things you have no chance he went down there especially just for her you know the story she comes to the well she says he says give me a drink and she says it's not customary for a Jew dass's american for something to drink and he said if you knew who you were talking to you to ask me for a drink and I'd give you a drink you never thirst again see he knew she had a thirst in her life for something she was trying to quench that thirst with all these other things she tried to quench that thirst with all these other men she had been with but Jesus recognized he knew the thirst was still there that's why I said you'd never thirst again if you drink this water she said the wells too deep you have nothing to draw with how are you getting where did this water come from then he just begins to talk to her you noticing about it he never goes on talking more about the water or how he's gonna draw the water but yet again he is talking about it because he begins to to talk to her and she says well our Father said worship in this mountain and others say worship at the temple and and what do you say and he said the time will come when you would neither worship in the mountain or the temple but all that worship Him will worship Him in spirit and in truth she said I perceived you are a prophet now when he went down to the temple they called him belzebub they called him the Prince of Devil's City casts out Devils by the Prince of Devil's that was the priest the so-called religious man of the day they didn't recognize him why because religion is not enough to be able to recognize Christ you don't recognize him by religion and his religious as they were and as much of keeping the law as they did they didn't recognize the very Messiah that they were looking for they looked for a messiah because the law told him that it was coming the prophets prophesied of him they were looking but all through the time of waiting they had made up in their minds how it was going to be and it didn't come the way they thought it was going to come so they did there was nothing in them to recognize that voice jesus said my sheep know my voice they were not of his sheep they couldn't wreck that was not something in them that recognized that voice maybe perhaps some of you can remember the first time you ever heard brother branham it wasn't his voice there was a voice behind that voice that you recognized and it spoke of the truth but she said sir I perceive you are a prophet it's because there was something in her that recognized that voice there was something about that voice to her and then went on talking and Jesus said go get your husband and she said I have no husband he said you spoke him well for you've had five and the one you're with now it's not your husband this didn't cause her to be offended there was something in her that said you have to be the Messiah she dropped her water pots the Bible said and running into the city come see a man that's told me everything I've ever done there are some individuals that can say well they were raised in this message grew up hearing this this message grew up hearing the tapes when they were young grew up hearing the tapes in their homes but went out and did the things of the world or just seemed like you wasn't quick into that but one day you were one day it did quicken why it was at the time and season that God had ordained for it to happen brother Branham says concerning the little woman at the well he said she had fallen from God's thoughts she could be redeemed she was a subject she had representation in heaven look at the difference between her and them preachers her priests they saw it and said this man's a fortune-teller they didn't know the word but she said sir you must be a prophet we ain't had one for hundreds of years we know that when the Messiah comes and he what he's going to do oh my and then she recognized that it was him my parents come to this message when I was just a young boy and I can remember living up in Cleveland Ohio and sitting out on the porch and in a little chair and hearing the tapes played and I could tell you things that were said on the tapes I could tell you things that brother Branham said I could tell you the stories that he talked about I must have had a tender heart for the Lord but when I came to be a young teenager why begin to see the attractions of the world and they glitter and they shine and they look pleasant just like in the Garden of Eden and just like the Bible says sin is pleasure for a season and then it's death but one day something spoke to me and I had grew up to me knowing that the message was right and when that hunger for God began to be awakened in my life I didn't look somewhere else to define to quench that thirst another church I mean but I I knew that it could only be quenched in in the God that had been revealed in this age it changed something hidden me stayed you ever backslide sure it did brother Ram talks about Abraham said he was back slid over in the desert telling that King that Sarah was his sister and not his wife one day I got the Holy Ghost and that changed everything that changed everything I'm thankful tonight that he's quickened me that I can look and I can see where I'm going I know where I'm going we need to know that just this week Monday actually marked the date my dad had passed a year ago but I know where he's at and I know there's others that's passed away and I know they're there together and sometimes I said and I I think about the different ones that's went on to be with the Lord and the ones that are together and that knew each other here in this life and are together there now and I think I can't wait to be united reunited with them again for the date when we'll have that time to be reacquainted oh my then I look forward friends I find comfort in knowing that I'm gonna have a body change in this body I struggle with different diseases but I know I none of those are gonna be in that change body this body some of the diseases I suffer with they if I let them they'll worry my mind that I'll worry about as I get older how well will I be able to get around but in that body I don't have to worry about that and I'm trusting in God while I'm in this body and I believe that he said I'm the LORD thy God that healeth all thy diseases and if he can heal somebody from cancer what can stand in his way no disease and I know the Bible says that he wouldn't put on us more than we could bear some things that we struggle with and they remind us of our the dis life is short this life has no certainty but we know we got a life that's coming how one of the things I thought well my after my father passed was he's not suffering anymore he suffered so many different illnesses and I thought well he's not suffering them now right before he passed he couldn't walk very well but he's walking now and he doesn't need a cane and I'll see him again I take comfort in that Paul talking about that he says comfort one another with these words that the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be changed be caught up together to meet him in the air and Paul says comfort one another with these words when we lose a loved one that's one of the things that we can look forward to take comfort in is that we'll see them again I take comfort in coming to church when you've been through a week you're facing different things and having to do different things and and you face different ones out in the world and things have happened and things have been said in that and but when it comes to church time you can't wait to get there brother Branham said leave it's
