[36:28] I
[36:29] bless
[36:35] your
[36:39] amen hallelujah what a wonderful
[36:43] privilege that God has given us this
[36:45] morning to be able to come together and
[36:48] amen to Fellowship around the word of
[36:49] the Lord and be able to and receive
[36:53] strength and encouragement and that
[36:56] he'll Minister just exactly ly what we
[36:58] have need of that's my prayer is that
[37:01] God will just speak to us what we have
[37:02] need of there's things that I that he's
[37:06] laid on my heart and we've had here for
[37:08] some time but God knows how to put it
[37:10] all together he knows what needs to be
[37:12] said knows exactly how that the words
[37:15] and the emphasis and so we just we
[37:18] certainly want his his leading this
[37:21] morning don't we amen we're certainly
[37:23] we're not gathered here this morning by
[37:25] accident it's not by chance
[37:29] but this is a it's a real Divine
[37:31] appointment Amen to be able to be
[37:33] gathered in the presence of God
[37:34] sometimes I know we we look at it and
[37:37] and because within the natural and the
[37:39] senses and this realm that we live in it
[37:42] can just seem like sometimes that we're
[37:44] going through the motions is sometimes
[37:45] you feel that way you don't sometimes
[37:48] other times you you feel if I can say it
[37:51] in this way you feel more spiritual and
[37:55] then there's other times where you're
[37:57] acting in obedience to the word not by
[37:59] your feelings cuz if you went by your
[38:01] feelings you wouldn't be
[38:03] here and let me just tell you something
[38:07] that in itself is greater than when you
[38:10] do feel
[38:12] spiritual because God is able to look
[38:15] upon us as his children and say they're
[38:18] not serving me based on their
[38:21] feelings because there's beautiful days
[38:23] out like today today A beautiful day is
[38:26] that right we love the Sun but when it
[38:28] gets the gloom and you get the gray
[38:31] clouds
[38:32] over man those things can be difficult
[38:36] days and times but you see this is where
[38:40] God made it so that our lives were not
[38:43] made to really spiritually be
[38:46] regulated by
[38:48] Lights by feelings this is why that God
[38:52] wanted us and draws us into that of the
[38:55] innermost Court of his presence because
[38:59] that's the shikina light that that's
[39:01] God's own light that's God and no matter
[39:03] what comes no matter what test no matter
[39:05] what trial nothing can put that out
[39:09] that's a joy that's an anchor that no
[39:12] matter how the elements change no matter
[39:14] how things change there's a constant and
[39:17] that's what the true Holy Spirit brings
[39:21] in our lives and through that God gives
[39:23] us a leadership how to really really
[39:26] conduct Our Lives you love him this
[39:29] morning God is so good he's faithful I
[39:32] couldn't help it this morning on the way
[39:34] to to church and I just begin to worship
[39:37] and just just crying and thinking about
[39:40] the goodness of God how God is so
[39:43] faithful and so merciful to us amen and
[39:47] um so I certainly want to say thank you
[39:49] for your prayers for uh my wife and um
[39:54] it um finally got settled pretty late
[39:57] last night and uh but it's right as it
[40:00] comes out of the kidney and I'm trusting
[40:02] that we're believing that that kidney
[40:04] stone is going to fully pass and uh you
[40:08] know when we got in there yesterday the
[40:10] emergency room they said you know are
[40:12] you sure I said we're
[40:14] sure we've been here many times
[40:17] before we're sure U but um I just thank
[40:21] you for your prayers and we're just
[40:23] believing that I'm I'm believing God
[40:25] that while the ministering of the word
[40:26] is going going forth that while she's
[40:29] there at home laying there on the couch
[40:32] that the spirit of God can move right
[40:34] down for that need I believe the same
[40:36] thing for your
[40:38] need amen your loved one those that's
[40:41] not able to be here with us this morning
[40:43] I believe he's the same God he's no
[40:44] respector person he's mindful don't you
[40:47] love him he's so good to us let's just
[40:52] pray Heavenly Father what a privilege it
[40:55] is to be gathered together

[41:01] Precious
[41:02] Faith now

[41:18] ago but father they're standing here

[42:15] grace that I can get out of the way so
[42:18] that you can come and speak to us we
[42:22] want to hear from you Lord just one word
[42:25] just even a few words
[42:28] is more more Lord is more meaningful
[42:32] Lord than anything
[42:35] else now Lord we just invite you take
[42:38] control Lord in the remaining part of
[42:39] this service have your way we pray in
[42:43] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God
[42:47] bless you this morning I I'm going to
[42:50] want to say thank you to the musicians
[42:52] and uh I'm going to invite you into the
[42:54] scriptures here to 1 John chapter
[42:58] 4 and I want to just read just a few
[43:00] verses
[43:03] here and
[43:21] uh I want to say we're supposed to have
[43:23] a fellowship dinner next week but sister
[43:26] Amanda she's going to need some
[43:28] help and
[43:30] um I know she's her her back that's why
[43:33] she's sitting back there from the fall
[43:35] that she had some weeks ago and she
[43:38] didn't ask me to say this and um but I
[43:41] just asking that maybe we can kind of U
[43:45] move together of the sisters brothers
[43:47] different ones and and try to help out
[43:49] and shoulder this that load right now if
[43:51] you have a question because we we all
[43:54] appreciate those Fellowship dinners
[43:55] don't we
[43:57] I do yeah I do I I think it's something
[44:00] that's very it's very beneficial to us
[44:03] as a body and it'll probably be a while
[44:05] before we have another one um but um if
[44:08] if you wouldn't mind it would be a great
[44:10] help just to uh reach out to brother
[44:13] Aaron sister Amanda and ask what can we
[44:16] do in this time to lighten lighten that
[44:19] and to help out so um if uh if you need
[44:23] their number I'm sure someone can get
[44:25] that to you and I hope that's all right
[44:28] if it's not I'll take I'll take the
[44:29] tomatoes for
[44:30] it but I just I really I'm asking for
[44:34] that if we could um also the sample
[44:37] books that are out there of the church
[44:39] age books uh sealed books if you want to
[44:41] order one put it down on the list out
[44:44] there uh for those of you uh
[44:46] frenchspeaking and I know we have
[44:48] frenchs speaking population now so I'm
[44:50] working on that I've got I'm I'm sending
[44:53] out fillers for that brother Barry's
[44:54] supposed to get back with me and I'm
[44:56] trying to to get all of those things
[44:57] filled as well so uh just trusting
[45:00] that'll that'll um come to fruition 1
[45:03] John 4:1
[45:05] 17 herein is our love made perfect or
[45:11] rather that the love of God May perfect
[45:13] Among Us that we may have boldness in
[45:17] the day of judgment because as he is so
[45:22] are we in this world that that's where
[45:25] that comes from because as he is so are
[45:28] we in this world there is no fear in
[45:33] love but perfect love casteth out fear
[45:39] because fear hath torment and he that
[45:42] fearth is not made perfect in love and
[45:47] we love him because he first loved us
[45:52] amen may God bless you and bless the
[45:55] reading of the word I want to to
[45:57] continue on this just to try to he a few
[46:00] moments and try to tie this portion up
[46:03] here this
[46:04] morning as we've been looking at this
[46:06] and I want to begin back as we were
[46:09] looking at this on on the love of God
[46:13] and perhaps just to kind of just move
[46:15] right in and give the the setting for it
[46:18] when we look at that of that scripture
[46:21] of 1 John
[46:23] 4 and I want to just kind of set it in
[46:26] this way and then just move into a few
[46:28] quotations that the prophet makes to
[46:31] kind of draw trying to draw us into the
[46:34] same mind and the thought but you know
[46:37] this scripture when it is speaking here
[46:40] it's never it's not saying that there
[46:42] would not be times that fear will not
[46:46] come around your life it's not saying
[46:49] that you won't experience fear it's not
[46:52] saying that things won't take place in
[46:55] that way but this is what the scripture
[46:58] is referring to it's dealing with where
[47:01] we have a confidence and a settl by the
[47:05] love of God through the holy spirit
[47:08] because the love of God and the Holy
[47:10] Ghost are one and the same that where
[47:13] when we have a
[47:15] confidence that where the love of God
[47:17] has reached in the depths of our
[47:20] soul and has changed our life has
[47:23] changed our nature our desires and our
[47:27] only desire is to please
[47:30] him when his word comes across our
[47:32] pathway and corrects us God it can sting
[47:36] but our desire is to please him and it's
[47:39] also a love that reaches that trust him
[47:43] yes even when things seem to be going
[47:46] backwards yes sir it's a it's a constant
[47:49] that holds you it's it's very much like
[47:51] that in a real Godly marriage that love
[47:55] is the glue that holds you together and
[47:59] that love is what gives you confidence
[48:01] to where you're not worried about one
[48:03] another I wonder where he's at or I
[48:05] wonder where she's at and but it's a
[48:08] it's a real love that gives you a
[48:09] confidence that no matter if you around
[48:11] on another part of the world you've got
[48:14] a confidence by love of that there is no
[48:18] worry there's no fear now if that would
[48:21] be in the natural Union of where you
[48:24] would take a man and a woman that would
[48:26] fall in love and a real a real love
[48:29] within their heart for one another that
[48:31] they can't even explain how much deeper
[48:35] is the love of God because that love
[48:38] that we're speaking of is a fial love
[48:40] between that of a man and a woman and
[48:42] yet we understand in our own lives as as
[48:46] Believers and as married people that I
[48:48] don't want to just walk in my marriage
[48:51] under the aelio love but I want the
[48:54] agape love to be over the AAL love
[48:58] because AAL love is a love that is based
[49:00] on many times of friendships and and
[49:03] there there is a care and and there are
[49:05] things that's there but agape love is
[49:07] where it goes beyond even when there are
[49:11] things that may not be so uh um uh let
[49:14] me say easy or things of where there's
[49:17] disagreement but there's a love that
[49:19] goes beyond that and that's the love
[49:21] that agape love that doesn't keep
[49:24] records agape love I'm I'm just quoting
[49:27] 1 Corinthians 13 it don't it doesn't it
[49:30] doesn't keep any records it's not you
[49:32] know has a file cabinet and digs it out
[49:34] when it's convenient to bring it back up
[49:36] to you no no love doesn't do that now
[49:38] listen our love cannot do
[49:43] that but God's love in our life it it
[49:47] will and it does produce a real true
[49:51] genuine forgiveness yes sir yes sir and
[49:54] it's it's real it's it's a it's a hidden
[49:57] power in our life and it moves in our
[50:00] life and and it works even as we grow in
[50:04] the Lord the love of God as Paul would
[50:06] say it in one way it is shed abroad in
[50:10] our hearts it it's taking over more of
[50:13] Our Lives as the more that we are
[50:16] yielding and giving ourselves to him and
[50:18] then you may ask the question how do I
[50:20] know that I'm yielding more to him how
[50:22] do I know that more is taking over my
[50:25] life well we can watch the attributes of
[50:29] how are things coming about in our life
[50:31] where is there change that's taking
[50:33] place within our life but you know many
[50:35] of the times we do not even realize
[50:38] where we in ourselves are falling short
[50:41] unless the word of God would point it
[50:44] out see this is why it's the beauty of
[50:47] and we need that of Hebrews 4:12 the
[50:49] word of God is quick alive it's powerful
[50:52] it's sharper than any two-edged sword
[50:54] now I'm not saying that the person could
[50:56] but not read their Bible as you would
[50:58] through the week or listen to the
[51:00] message of the hour or even you know
[51:03] maybe you're reading a sign as you go
[51:04] down the road and the spirit of God
[51:06] could strike your heart I believe that
[51:08] we can live so in tune with God to where
[51:11] that God can speak to us even through
[51:13] nature but it doesn't those things do
[51:16] not replace the assembling as the
[51:18] scripture said the assembling of
[51:20] ourselves together because you see it's
[51:23] something about when the Living Word
[51:25] comes forth that it's not anything and
[51:27] and all of that is the Living Word but
[51:29] you understand that when the word comes
[51:32] it will discern Our Lives because
[51:35] sometimes we can feel that everything is
[51:38] right on the money and you know you know
[51:40] we've got our favorite mirror that we
[51:42] like that makes us look skinny instead
[51:44] of plump and we have those things about
[51:47] it and you know certain things and but
[51:49] yet the word of God it doesn't present
[51:52] to us what we're thinking the word of
[51:54] God displays to us the things even that
[51:57] would be lacking in our life now the
[52:00] word of God will come in times and it
[52:02] will correct us like in manners like
[52:04] that show us where we're lacking and
[52:06] then there's other times the word of God
[52:08] will come to encourage us and yet every
[52:11] time God corrects us he's also going to
[52:14] encourage Us in the right matters as
[52:16] well and so these are things within our
[52:19] life that the love of God it is always
[52:22] something in our life that as a Believer
[52:24] it is things that we would say God I
[52:26] believe it should be our prayer Lord I
[52:29] desire more of the love of God I I
[52:32] wanted to so completely take control of
[52:35] every part of my life every relationship
[52:39] I want the love of God to be the the
[52:41] Central and the reigning factor in my
[52:44] life yes sir and you'll find that even
[52:47] as you walk with God how that the love
[52:50] of God even grows deeper I mean because
[52:52] it's God's love that found you and I
[52:54] when we were in our sin is that right it
[52:57] it it it led us to repentance it it
[53:00] didn't show us that hey you're without
[53:02] hope but the real love of God being made
[53:04] manifest shows us there is a way out and
[53:07] I am your way it lets us know there is a
[53:10] way back there is there is a place that
[53:13] of Deliverance there's a place of
[53:14] freedom and and all of that there's a
[53:17] place in my
[53:19] house but that's where the love of God
[53:22] comes it begins to deal with our hearts
[53:24] it begins our minds begin to term to
[53:27] that but with the ultimate goal is where
[53:31] the love of God would find its residence
[53:34] Amen in our heart amen not just in our
[53:39] Minden not just in our emotions it had
[53:42] God the love of God is what's working on
[53:43] our life to turn our life but God's
[53:46] desire is that that love of God his own
[53:49] Spirit his life would fill the very
[53:52] center of our
[53:54] life and that's not something that you
[53:56] you or I have done or could do that's a
[54:00] sovereign work of God there's not one of
[54:02] you nor myself that gave our own selves
[54:06] the Holy Ghost it was God who even by
[54:10] his love would condition our hearts to a
[54:14] place to where our faith would become
[54:17] acceptive in his sight yes that's good
[54:20] and then the holy spirit is the Seal of
[54:24] our faith yeah who's done it all it's
[54:28] God we are his
[54:31] workmanship so it's God working it's not
[54:33] you it's not him that willth nor him
[54:35] that runneth it is God that showeth
[54:38] Mercy amen that's what the love of God
[54:41] at work in our lives now when you look
[54:44] at this throughout let me read a few
[54:46] quotations brother BM says in Divine
[54:49] love and Sovereign Grace he said the
[54:51] greatest hindrance that there is in the
[54:53] church today he says among other people
[54:56] people everywhere is fear but love
[54:59] perfect love cast out fear and it says
[55:03] the reason your fearful is because the
[55:05] right Temperance of love has never
[55:09] entered yet when there's real love all
[55:12] fear passes away when you really love
[55:15] the Lord now what is he speaking of here
[55:19] with the right Temperance it's just as
[55:21] said moments ago where where when the
[55:23] right Temperance where the where the the
[55:25] holy Spirit the love of God has come
[55:28] into the very depths of our soul where
[55:31] it is no longer a wondering did he do it
[55:35] for me am I included in this is this is
[55:38] this really about me but it's where that
[55:41] it actually becomes something that is
[55:43] absolutely personal that Calvary becomes
[55:48] a personal
[55:50] revelation let me just tell you the
[55:52] power of that that if there was no one
[55:55] else
[55:57] he would have did it for
[56:00] you because you belong to
[56:03] him he didn't let me just say this to
[56:05] you he did not become flesh for the
[56:09] masses that's good that's so good he
[56:13] became one of us the Bible said for the
[56:16] son of man is come to seek and save them
[56:21] that were
[56:23] lost that's so good now if you you know
[56:27] my car keys are my car keys if I lose
[56:29] them they're my car keys that are lost
[56:31] they're not
[56:32] yours and this is where when God coming
[56:35] down he come down to find what always
[56:38] belonged to him sin separated us sin got
[56:43] in the way but he came down what brought
[56:45] him down his
[56:47] love it was love that brought him down
[56:51] yes it it was love the where when he
[56:54] walked in a life that was despised and
[56:57] rejected he bore that humiliation he
[57:00] bore that reproach he bore all of the
[57:03] stripes he took it all for you and me
[57:07] that was the love of God being
[57:12] displayed not because we were worthy we
[57:15] weren't worthy we were not we were not
[57:17] living lives even list listen even him
[57:20] seeing way ahead in
[57:24] time and could see the conditions that
[57:27] we would be in the situations that we
[57:29] would be found in but he did not look at
[57:33] the situations and determine whether or
[57:36] not we were worthy of his love because
[57:40] the situations were that you and I were
[57:42] in the darkness that we were enshrouded
[57:44] in that is not who we were it's the
[57:48] atmosphere that was around our life but
[57:50] the love of God came and it broke that
[57:54] atmosphere and it revealed
[57:56] what was there the whole
[57:59] time a son and daughter of
[58:04] God the love of God does not make you a
[58:07] son and daughter of God it only reveals
[58:09] to you who you always
[58:12] were that's why the scripture said
[58:15] beloved 1 John 3 uh uh that now oh
[58:19] consider this love what manner of love
[58:21] that we should be called the sons of God
[58:25] let me tell you something you a person
[58:26] could walk right into a meeting and be
[58:28] bound in everything else and they can
[58:31] the spirit of God takes a hold and
[58:33] begins to say you're my son you're my
[58:36] daughter you say how can you say that
[58:38] with habits and everything else and sin
[58:41] even not have repented yet because the
[58:44] word is letting you know who you are and
[58:47] you're living beneath your
[58:51] privileges Hallelujah the love of God
[58:54] doesn't mince words the word word is
[58:56] Discerning beneath your Darkness who you
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:03] are so
[59:06] good and Satan's always about trying to
[59:09] bring
[59:11] fear yes but there's a place where that
[59:14] of the right Temperance would enter in
[59:17] where you're able to walk daily with a
[59:21] confidence that everything can be going
[59:24] wrong around you you don't even know the
[59:27] next step to take but there's a
[59:30] joy that someone say and it isn't maybe
[59:34] you're even smiling but there's a joy
[59:35] there's something that when you wake up
[59:36] in the morning that you know that you
[59:39] know that you know that you know it's
[59:42] settled like the like the old song said
[59:44] the old account was settled long ago
[59:47] Hallelujah you
[59:49] know what has done that not your works
[59:52] not my works the love of God and you
[59:55] know what it is don't try don't try to
[59:57] to barter with it because you and I
[1:00:00] could never do anything that would Merit
[1:00:02] the love of
[1:00:05] God don't try to work your way into it
[1:00:08] accept
[1:00:09] it say God let the love of God let it
[1:00:12] move deeper into my life
[1:00:16] Hallelujah Samuel I've had a lot of
[1:00:18] people let me down let me just tell you
[1:00:21] even every week even sitting here can
[1:00:24] let one another down but there is one
[1:00:27] amen who will never let you down and
[1:00:31] that is the Lord Jesus Christ as a
[1:00:34] matter of fact the Bible says even when
[1:00:37] we ourselves you know be be be in a in a
[1:00:40] place yet he abideth faithful yes he
[1:00:43] does even in those times and moments he
[1:00:46] does not abandon you and I and say I
[1:00:48] hadn't heard from you in a while I
[1:00:50] haven't you haven't talked to you in a
[1:00:51] while or I see you kind of you know
[1:00:53] maybe you're floundering a little bit
[1:00:55] and you feel that in your own Spirit but
[1:00:57] yet listen to me he's not abandoned
[1:01:01] you he's a friend that sticking closer
[1:01:05] than a
[1:01:06] brother he's not a friend that you've
[1:01:09] got to somehow make yourself do
[1:01:11] something or look like something or or
[1:01:13] something in order to be accepted let me
[1:01:16] tell you he accepted you before the
[1:01:19] foundation of the
[1:01:21] world you were accepted in the mind of
[1:01:24] God where the lamb was slain the pritu
[1:01:28] your way back the love of God already
[1:01:31] made a way
[1:01:33] back Hallelujah that's right and when
[1:01:36] that strikes that right
[1:01:38] Temperance of love it settles in it
[1:01:42] settles into our life let me just say
[1:01:45] this to
[1:01:47] you even with that there's things that
[1:01:51] God continues to speak to us and remind
[1:01:56] us and tell us who we
[1:01:59] are because let me just say this to you
[1:02:02] you see the person in the mirror every
[1:02:05] single
[1:02:06] day you have whispered in your ears all
[1:02:10] your
[1:02:11] failures all your
[1:02:14] disappointments and this is this is the
[1:02:16] challenge and let me just say not only
[1:02:19] the challenge but this will be such a
[1:02:21] great Victory is for a people that'll be
[1:02:24] able to take the word
[1:02:26] above their own thoughts right right
[1:02:29] above their own feelings of their own
[1:02:31] self I'm not talking about where we're
[1:02:33] ignoring I'm not talking about ignoring
[1:02:34] sin I'm talking about that you know
[1:02:37] where you're standing and you're no
[1:02:38] longer looking at your own self
[1:02:41] am that will affect the way that you
[1:02:44] walk in this life when you're no longer
[1:02:46] looking at your love to God it's not
[1:02:49] your love you love him because he first
[1:02:52] loved
[1:02:53] you your love will wear out my love love
[1:02:56] would wear out but his
[1:02:58] love his love
[1:03:00] endured it moved through Noah it moved
[1:03:02] through Abraham it moved through
[1:03:04] Jeremiah it moved through Elijah and the
[1:03:06] same love of God it moves through your
[1:03:10] life it's not about your love it's about
[1:03:13] his
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:16] love the Rapture is about his love
[1:03:19] coming to claim what his love has
[1:03:23] perfected is so good
[1:03:26] Hallelujah for a people
[1:03:29] walking in these in these places these
[1:03:33] temporary booths these Dwelling
[1:03:38] Places and we've got life above
[1:03:42] us hallelujah life in
[1:03:45] us the prophet said the church is
[1:03:48] lacking in Divine love he said I don't
[1:03:50] mean affection and love one for another
[1:03:51] I mean agape love have it so richly into
[1:03:54] your heart until you just love the Lord
[1:03:56] in everything and you just take his word
[1:03:59] for it and you don't mistrust him yes
[1:04:03] Hallelujah that's so good brother BR
[1:04:05] said the greatest hindrance that the
[1:04:06] Christian church has is fear
[1:04:09] Christianity is not a try at it it's a
[1:04:12] noo it's something that is real let me
[1:04:17] tell you the whole point of the Gospel
[1:04:19] is
[1:04:21] rest is rest rest in what a finished
[1:04:23] work amen that that's the same way let
[1:04:26] me just say this to you you can discern
[1:04:29] every spirit that comes to you if it
[1:04:31] wants to put a wedge between you and the
[1:04:34] rest of God that's the
[1:04:37] devil well brother Samuel I I may not be
[1:04:39] where I ought to be but remember the
[1:04:42] spirit of God will never come to a place
[1:04:45] to point you that there's no way out but
[1:04:48] even in our error and even in our wrong
[1:04:51] the spirit of God comes to correct us
[1:04:54] but he'll always correct us with the
[1:04:56] view of
[1:04:58] Calvary but Satan will always punch you
[1:05:01] to a dead end
[1:05:02] Street your life is not a dead end
[1:05:06] [Applause]
[1:05:07] Street yes we had to come to a place in
[1:05:10] our life where we realize it's an end of
[1:05:12] me I'm tired of me you get tired of
[1:05:14] being Samuel Jacob got tired of being
[1:05:16] Jacob you've got to get tired of being
[1:05:19] you and when you get tired of being you
[1:05:21] then God himself will step in
[1:05:26] Jacob was a deceiver but on the
[1:05:29] inside there was a there was a hidden
[1:05:31] Mystery he was a prince the whole time
[1:05:35] he was being subdued by so many other
[1:05:37] things but one moment in the presence of
[1:05:42] God he came out of there a limping
[1:05:46] Prince it affected his walk in every
[1:05:49] other part of his
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:54] life yes
[1:05:58] now rman goes on to say in another place
[1:06:02] he says said I want to talk on faith a
[1:06:04] little while just to build up your
[1:06:05] Christian faith one of the greatest
[1:06:08] hindrance that the church has got today
[1:06:10] is that you're scared to death what are
[1:06:13] you scared about that that's what I'm
[1:06:15] wondering if you'll just only
[1:06:19] realize you don't know who you
[1:06:22] are God you don't know who's sitting
[1:06:24] next to you right
[1:06:26] well let me just say let me just pause
[1:06:28] on this for a moment you're not going to
[1:06:29] find out who you are from
[1:06:34] YouTube you're not going to find out who
[1:06:36] you are you see you see one of the
[1:06:38] things the devil likes to do is try to
[1:06:41] Cloud over and he'll want to take you
[1:06:43] away from the source that tells you who
[1:06:46] you are that's right come on sometimes
[1:06:50] you you you you can get down you get all
[1:06:52] clouded here you know sometimes even
[1:06:54] from young believers the middle one or
[1:06:55] more you get down and you get clouded
[1:06:58] over and you know what it is what
[1:06:59] Satan's trying to do is break you away
[1:07:03] from the source that holds the true
[1:07:05] mystery of your
[1:07:07] life and releases strength to you that's
[1:07:12] very true you you can't find out who you
[1:07:15] are from any other source but the word
[1:07:17] of God and let me tell you the more time
[1:07:19] you spend in the word of God you'll find
[1:07:22] out who you are because the scripture
[1:07:24] said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:07:26] by the word of God it's going to take a
[1:07:28] little bit more than just just coming to
[1:07:30] church on Sunday and just coming on
[1:07:33] Thursday it's going to require a real
[1:07:35] relationship and you getting in the word
[1:07:37] of God yourself to realize that God
[1:07:40] allowed this to be printed for me this
[1:07:43] is a love letter to me God sent the
[1:07:47] message to illuminate this word to my
[1:07:51] life it was from me God sent the message
[1:07:54] for me you said do you know he said he
[1:07:56] didn't say behold I send unto behold I
[1:07:59] send unto you behold I send unto you
[1:08:03] Elijah that is so good it's
[1:08:07] personal the love of God is
[1:08:11] personal Hallelujah Oh Glory he says oh
[1:08:16] well you say who's sitting next to me
[1:08:17] that's my neighbor I know I know him all
[1:08:19] right but he's a Son of God right
[1:08:22] adopted by Jesus Christ into the family
[1:08:25] that's a daughter of God you're sitting
[1:08:26] next to and who are you if you're a
[1:08:30] Christian believer you're a Son of God
[1:08:33] what are you scared about no need of
[1:08:35] being scared as long as the devil can
[1:08:40] keep you scared right that's all he
[1:08:44] wants to do he's got you right then
[1:08:47] right if he can just keep you
[1:08:51] afraid now that
[1:08:53] works even throughout all of our life to
[1:08:57] it's constant we're the enemy as I said
[1:08:59] now once we've got that inner man taken
[1:09:01] care of where the love of God has come
[1:09:05] in then that through perfect love that's
[1:09:09] what'll cast
[1:09:10] out fear because fear has torment fears
[1:09:15] can come oh don't don't don't let don't
[1:09:18] let there be a misconception as though
[1:09:20] that you're going to walk around in this
[1:09:22] life and you're not going to experience
[1:09:23] fear from time to time right
[1:09:28] the prophet himself in the message go
[1:09:31] tell he was there and had a sinus
[1:09:35] condition and a and a fever and it
[1:09:37] wasn't breaking people were praying for
[1:09:40] him and finally God re God showed up in
[1:09:44] a vision because he went off into the
[1:09:47] din room and the reason he went off into
[1:09:49] the den room is because he had just at
[1:09:51] this time the you know you're sick we've
[1:09:54] all been sick and you get into a
[1:09:56] condition you're a sick man there's
[1:09:57] things start swirling and he looked at
[1:09:59] sister mey said you know what sometimes
[1:10:01] I doubt whether I'm even called or
[1:10:05] not I thank God those things are
[1:10:07] included like
[1:10:10] that so sister mey said the reason he
[1:10:12] was in that Den
[1:10:14] room act a little bit like us sometimes
[1:10:17] she said you ought to be ashamed of
[1:10:19] yourself he said so I went there just
[1:10:21] kind of laid over you know the bed I was
[1:10:22] a little B I got rebuked you know but as
[1:10:26] he laid there here came a vision of
[1:10:27] Calvary and the light shining through
[1:10:30] and the Holy Spirit said now I have
[1:10:33] confirmed the furtherance of your com
[1:10:36] your commission to you but you haven't
[1:10:38] accepted it and so the prophet said then
[1:10:42] Lord I accept it and he said as soon as
[1:10:45] I said that The Fever broke Hall the
[1:10:48] condition broke right there
[1:10:51] amen and then he goes on to explain to
[1:10:54] you and I what was going on he said what
[1:10:56] it was I was afraid of
[1:11:01] failure and and he goes on to explain
[1:11:03] what it was he said he takes you know he
[1:11:05] hears about thing from General Patton on
[1:11:08] the radio and a quotation and he said so
[1:11:10] then he refers to that he said what it
[1:11:12] is he said I've come to that place he
[1:11:14] said if I put a bullet in and it doesn't
[1:11:16] go off I'll take it out and put another
[1:11:17] one in let me bring that down home for
[1:11:21] us that's putting a promise right in the
[1:11:24] word of right in the gun if that promise
[1:11:27] doesn't go off it's filled with all
[1:11:30] kinds of promises maybe we we got the
[1:11:33] wrong promise in there but there's a
[1:11:35] promise for my life for this situation
[1:11:38] and I'm going to keep on putting bullets
[1:11:41] in the
[1:11:43] gun come on Friends these bullets are
[1:11:47] loaded the promises of God are not
[1:11:51] duds these are not like a box of snaps
[1:11:53] you got as a little boy or a little girl
[1:11:56] you threw this one down it didn't go off
[1:11:58] you threw that one down and went off
[1:11:59] then you go back and get this other one
[1:12:00] throw it down again it don't go off
[1:12:02] throw it down again it don't go off
[1:12:03] finally you go over and smash it it
[1:12:04] don't go off this that's not how the
[1:12:06] word of God is every promise in
[1:12:11] him is filled with a boom a yes and
[1:12:17] amen there's no Duds in the fireworks of
[1:12:21] God's
[1:12:22] promises you don't got to doctor it up
[1:12:27] right just let Faith light it
[1:12:32] off and have enough humility to say
[1:12:34] maybe I was I maybe I didn't have the
[1:12:37] right promise in the gun at the right
[1:12:40] time but God show me the right bullet to
[1:12:42] put in this
[1:12:45] gun prise the Lord is that all
[1:12:49] right so love brings confidence let me
[1:12:53] just refer to this love brings
[1:12:54] confidence
[1:12:55] that's what the love of God does because
[1:12:57] love produces Faith that's why Paul
[1:12:59] could say in that scripture reading
[1:13:01] there that Christ would dwell in our
[1:13:03] hearts this was his prayer that we would
[1:13:05] be rooted and grounded in love how many
[1:13:09] of you know that with plants plants
[1:13:11] continue to be rooted down continue to
[1:13:14] be grounded how many of you know that
[1:13:16] you plan it it begins to get established
[1:13:19] but you may have to be really careful
[1:13:22] with that for a number of years until it
[1:13:24] finally takes right and that's the same
[1:13:28] in our life listen the new birth does
[1:13:31] not come in our life the love of God
[1:13:33] down and dwelling there in the midst of
[1:13:35] our soul and all of a sudden we we we
[1:13:38] don't need anym no we need more we need
[1:13:40] to
[1:13:42] grow God is not coming and and forgive
[1:13:45] me I don't I don't know how I to say it
[1:13:46] it come to me God's not coming to to
[1:13:48] Rapture the seven dwares right he's
[1:13:51] coming to Rapture mature Sons and
[1:13:54] Daughters of God
[1:13:57] right we start out as
[1:14:00] babies right and and even throughout the
[1:14:04] the time that that we're together but
[1:14:06] we've got to grow now the scripture says
[1:14:09] you have not received the spirit of
[1:14:11] bondage again to fear but you've
[1:14:14] received the spirit of adoption or that
[1:14:16] which will lead you to full adoption
[1:14:18] whereby you cry Abba Father so through
[1:14:21] that through the indwelling of his
[1:14:22] Spirit that's where you can cry out that
[1:14:25] th art my father right the spirit itself
[1:14:28] beareth witness with our spirit that
[1:14:31] we're the children of God Amen 2 Timothy
[1:14:34] 1:7 For
[1:14:36] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[1:14:39] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:14:42] mind so it it fear is not of God right
[1:14:46] amen fear does not come from God that's
[1:14:50] right now I'm saying that with this
[1:14:52] regards because situations in life see
[1:14:55] seasons of Life times of Life
[1:14:57] circumstances fear can come around your
[1:15:00] life but I want you this is one place
[1:15:02] you can stand on that God never gave a
[1:15:06] spirit of fear as a matter of fact the
[1:15:09] Bible says in Hebrews 2 he had come to
[1:15:12] destroy that that which was over men's
[1:15:16] lives that held him in the bondage of
[1:15:18] fear what do you talking about the
[1:15:19] bondage of fear job said the thing which
[1:15:22] I feared is come upon me what was said
[1:15:25] that job feared it was death it was the
[1:15:27] unknown come on down I'm not in the
[1:15:30] message I don't have time to go through
[1:15:32] all the quotes but this is the part that
[1:15:34] job himself it was unknown it was not
[1:15:37] revealed to them yet but to you and I
[1:15:40] that the light Paul said in the book of
[1:15:42] Titus that this light has been brought
[1:15:45] that light of immortality we have a true
[1:15:48] expectation listen when the question was
[1:15:51] rised what happens to man when he died
[1:15:54] it was through the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:56] that the answer was made manifest when a
[1:16:00] man lays down and giveth up the ghost
[1:16:02] what happens to him now came the secret
[1:16:05] revealed on that Easter morning when the
[1:16:08] seals of where they tried to seal him in
[1:16:10] the seal was
[1:16:13] Broken
[1:16:16] Hallelujah
[1:16:18] broken just so you understand the Lord
[1:16:21] Jesus himself listen this is follow him
[1:16:25] for a
[1:16:26] moment one of the greatest acts that he
[1:16:28] ever did after all the Miracles the
[1:16:32] Bible tells us in the Book of John
[1:16:34] knowing that he come from God and goes
[1:16:37] back to God what a
[1:16:38] revelation see it only deepened in his
[1:16:41] life and the very next scripture says he
[1:16:43] GED himself and began to wash their feet
[1:16:47] you see what the glor you see what the
[1:16:48] glory of that Revelation did it brought
[1:16:51] forth
[1:16:51] humility it brought forth further
[1:16:54] service to the will of God and so he
[1:16:57] knows he knows that there's no there's
[1:16:58] no question here he is in the Garden of
[1:17:01] Gethsemane praying three times if it's
[1:17:04] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:17:06] Hebrews 5 CH chapter 5: 7 said though he
[1:17:11] were a son yet he learned
[1:17:15] obedience through the things which he
[1:17:17] suffered he was heard in that he feared
[1:17:22] with strong tears and crying right
[1:17:24] hallah I ask you what part of the Son of
[1:17:27] God was in
[1:17:30] fear was it that was it that inside
[1:17:34] part or was it that outside
[1:17:38] realm so you can see

[1:20:13] stone in the court when they gave that
[1:20:15] stone with that name written that only

[1:20:43] a few moments to work with a little bit
[1:20:44] of this here comes and right why C I can
[1:20:49] get it right why Christ speak brother BR
[1:20:51] turns to this sister she's on the
[1:20:53] platform he the spirit of God's been
[1:20:55] calling out many people right there as
[1:20:56] you standing he said you feel now you
[1:20:58] feel different don't you sis now you go

[1:21:03] you believe I'll be
[1:21:05] well well sure certainly I believe
[1:21:07] you're well see you've got that complex
[1:21:11] wrapped around you but the power of it
[1:21:15] broke just a few minutes ago
[1:21:18] now you understand what's happening it's
[1:21:21] the Holy Spirit telling her to look down
[1:21:24] your shackles are
[1:21:26] gone the chain is
[1:21:29] broken that which has held you and has
[1:21:32] stopped you and and has held that
[1:21:34] complex look at it he's telling he's
[1:21:36] directing her the power of it has broke
[1:21:40] yes that's how he's he's that's how he's
[1:21:42] able to say you will you are well why

[1:22:30] you out here he like that's why he likes
[1:22:32] to get your mind going a million
[1:22:33] different ways while you're sitting

[1:23:05] straps I'm
[1:23:06] Healed see the power of it's
[1:23:09] broken when the power of Egypt's hold
[1:23:12] was broken they could go forward but
[1:23:15] they had to keep going forward there
[1:23:16] were obstacles in their way but the
[1:23:18] power of Egypt had already been broken
[1:23:20] the blood of the Lamb had loosed them
[1:23:23] when it came upon the door it released
[1:23:25] them from the power of Egypt's
[1:23:28] ho and they kept walking till eventually
[1:23:31] they walked right through the Red Sea
[1:23:33] and all that was after himen became
[1:23:37] consumed when it tried to pursue him you
[1:23:39] say what are you saying I'm saying get
[1:23:41] so deep in God to where the devil can't
[1:23:44] even find
[1:23:46] you I'm telling you say brother Samuel
[1:23:48] where I'm at right now forget listen
[1:23:50] forget about where you've been you're

[1:23:53] spirit of God God is wanting to take you
[1:23:55] High say God I'm going to rise in the
[1:23:58] wings of Grace right now I feel the
[1:24:01] Winds of the Holy Ghost blowing right
[1:24:04] now I'm going to move on this current
[1:24:06] and I'm going to rise there what am I
[1:24:08] going to do I'm going to go deeper in
[1:24:11] Jesus
[1:24:13] Christ it's like you're in a
[1:24:17] house like you're in a house you know
[1:24:20] how it is you're close to the door
[1:24:22] you'll hear this right right but you get
[1:24:25] off in another room you get off in a
[1:24:28] room that might be more inward I don't
[1:24:30] care who's out there right you're not
[1:24:34] going to be hearing it right that's the
[1:24:36] way it is when you get in Christ and
[1:24:39] keep going deeper the deeper you go the
[1:24:43] fainter the fainter the quieter that the
[1:24:47] devil's Roar and his hot breath and what
[1:24:50] he wants to say about you get a get
[1:24:53] further in Christ
[1:24:56] stop going over to the
[1:25:03] door don't even look through the people
[1:25:06] did you hear me don't even look through
[1:25:08] the
[1:25:10] people you don't have to answer him his
[1:25:13] his question has already been

[1:25:41] on and be well everything will be all
[1:25:44] right looks all right around you right
[1:25:46] now where it's dark when you was here on
[1:25:49] the platform so when she came up brother
[1:25:51] Joy it was dark but what's happened
[1:25:54] broke through the clouds broke back
[1:25:56] brother Aaron she sees the
[1:25:58] lifeline it broke back she sees that
[1:26:00] Lifeline how to get back what I do it's
[1:26:03] broke now when this meeting's over if
[1:26:06] the clouds try to come back but just
[1:26:08] take hold of that rope keep keep moving
[1:26:10] your hands up like the prophet was
[1:26:11] looking from that rope say God I know
[1:26:13] you've showed me the lifeline out of
[1:26:15] here he showed you the lifeline out of
[1:26:17] here keep walking in the direction where
[1:26:20] he has showed you
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:24] oh Lord I wish I had I wish I had more
[1:26:26] strength he said notice you're all right
[1:26:30] the blessing's on you now if you'll just
[1:26:32] keep on
[1:26:34] going let me give you another let me
[1:26:37] give you another one cuz I know
[1:26:40] sometimes we come in situation we hear
[1:26:41] things on the news and then sometimes
[1:26:43] you experience things in life where fear
[1:26:45] can come based on those
[1:26:47] experiences right we have what do we
[1:26:50] call the acronym
[1:26:52] PTSD right I mean you got going happen
[1:26:54] you know like we driving a car you get
[1:26:55] in a car accident right all of a sudden
[1:26:57] man coming up to coming up to
[1:26:58] intersections all and you know it's not
[1:27:00] saying that we shouldn't be cautious but
[1:27:02] sometimes sometimes fear can come around
[1:27:04] a child of God and it become so
[1:27:07] debilitated maybe if they've gotten in
[1:27:08] an accident maybe when it's early
[1:27:10] morning maybe it's night it just it
[1:27:12] becomes like something that moves around
[1:27:14] them that at that at night it's just one
[1:27:16] of those things that just seems like man
[1:27:18] it just seems to maybe maybe get upon
[1:27:20] them listen the prophet when that gun
[1:27:22] went off in his face you remember that
[1:27:25] when that gun they tried to bore it out
[1:27:27] to be a weather be Magnum I believe it
[1:27:29] was and when it went off remember what
[1:27:31] brother Bram said he did he said I got
[1:27:33] right in the gun range the next day cuz
[1:27:36] I didn't want something to set in in my
[1:27:39] life that is so
[1:27:41] good I wonder I wonder you see because I
[1:27:46] I don't believe that brother BR went out
[1:27:47] to that gun range just walking on the
[1:27:49] clouds but he went out to that gun range
[1:27:51] because wisdom was if I set on this
[1:27:54] that's right fear is going to build
[1:27:56] right so you know what he did Brother
[1:27:58] Joy he went put it right went that gun
[1:28:00] and started shooting I wonder if there
[1:28:02] weren thoughts going through his mind I
[1:28:04] know there was he don't have to tell us
[1:28:07] but when he says that I did it so
[1:28:09] nothing sets in it shows that if he
[1:28:11] would have let it it could have set
[1:28:14] in we're going to preach
[1:28:17] now this is the time that even through
[1:28:20] your failures don't sit around and stoop
[1:28:24] amen amen and where you start carrying
[1:28:26] your bottom lip around like this come on
[1:28:29] friends I'm not picking on you I'm
[1:28:31] trying to remind you who you
[1:28:33] are your flesh is always going to
[1:28:36] disappoint you but you've got to look
[1:28:38] beyond your flesh You' got to think
[1:28:40] beyond that you got to get right back in
[1:28:43] the gun range put another bullet in
[1:28:45] there and fire
[1:28:47] again cuz if not you'll sit around and
[1:28:50] doubt will build fear will build and
[1:28:52] eventually a complex
[1:28:54] has you wrapped
[1:28:56] up it'd be easier to get out of a hold
[1:28:58] of an octopus than that
[1:29:08] complex maybe we should open the door
[1:29:10] and just let him out of here no stay
[1:29:12] around I want to whoop you a little bit
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:18] more watch this I love this 1964 brother
[1:29:24] is talking to a brother he holds his
[1:29:26] brother on the platform I'm not going to
[1:29:27] read that whole thing to you but he
[1:29:28] holds his brother on the platform goes
[1:29:29] through the four anointings goes through
[1:29:31] where we're at in the eagle age and then
[1:29:33] he's asked the brother you know where
[1:29:34] we're at you know with the stone coming
[1:29:36] into the image and he says brother do
[1:29:39] you believe that that the word in stone
[1:29:41] the coming one the brother said I do he
[1:29:43] said you have a very fine feeling sir
[1:29:46] now what your trouble you've had an
[1:29:49] accident and in that accident you were
[1:29:51] gassed with carbon monoxide side gas
[1:29:55] that is true it poisoned you it poisoned
[1:29:58] you in your liver and you had trouble
[1:30:00] with that you had trouble with your
[1:30:02] stomach the brother said that's right
[1:30:03] you had trouble with your heart that's
[1:30:05] right and it's made you a nervous until
[1:30:08] you built yourself in a complex notice
[1:30:12] in a
[1:30:14] complex you see a complex isn't
[1:30:17] something in here a complex is something
[1:30:19] that gets wrapped get something that
[1:30:20] gets built in other words it becomes
[1:30:23] like the man of the gated community I'm
[1:30:25] not letting you in unless you can come
[1:30:28] through this
[1:30:29] complex that's right that's exactly
[1:30:31] right they see the very thing with that
[1:30:32] the reason the whole goal with that is
[1:30:34] Satan is trying to hinder that's right
[1:30:38] this man's relationship with God now you
[1:30:40] might look and say what does him going
[1:30:42] to work have to do with his relationship
[1:30:45] with God because if Satan can affect him
[1:30:48] in one area of his life it'll actually
[1:30:51] start to spiral depression despondency
[1:30:55] anxiousness it'll work through every
[1:30:57] aspect of his life let me just say this
[1:31:00] to you you might not think that your
[1:31:02] natural life means too much to God but I
[1:31:04] want to tell you God's put certain
[1:31:06] skills and gifts and things within you
[1:31:08] God's put it within you that you and I
[1:31:10] are built in order to work labor see
[1:31:14] achievement and when that doesn't happen
[1:31:16] it will affect you even in your
[1:31:18] spiritual
[1:31:19] walk you know why because you feel
[1:31:22] useless you feel worthless you feel like
[1:31:26] I don't have nothing accomplished and
[1:31:28] that is one of Satan's poys to try to
[1:31:32] get at you to hinder you because if you
[1:31:34] can get you in one area that you're
[1:31:37] doubting or you're feeling down then he
[1:31:39] Smooths that over and it affects you
[1:31:42] being yielded at all times to God right
[1:31:46] everybody with me now that is so good Oh
[1:31:49] my he says now watch you're poor you
[1:31:53] must go back to work but you're afraid
[1:31:56] to go back to work you're afraid of that
[1:31:59] carbon monoxide gas but it's going to be
[1:32:02] all right if Jesus will tell me who you
[1:32:05] are them things was true weren't they if
[1:32:09] he'll tell me who you are will you
[1:32:10] accept it and know and go on back and be
[1:32:13] of a good cheer will you do it I'm
[1:32:15] asking you will you do it your name is
[1:32:18] Mr Wagner go on back on your road now
[1:32:22] let me tell you something if God wanted
[1:32:25] to he could call your name right here
[1:32:27] this morning but this word is the one
[1:32:30] thing that's calling your name it's
[1:32:32] Discerning your life and you're
[1:32:34] realizing this is me God is speaking to
[1:32:37] my life you know what that is that is
[1:32:39] the spirit of God the same Angel of the
[1:32:42] Lord that accompanies the message that
[1:32:45] is Discerning the thoughts and hearts of
[1:32:48] his people and he's calling your
[1:32:52] name he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:56] forever hallah the mighty Angel is
[1:33:00] here

[1:33:04] hallelujah
[1:33:06] hallelujah hallelujah I want you to
[1:33:09] think of this one I didn't put this one
[1:33:10] up there but just listen this for a
[1:33:12] minute this one always struck me brother
[1:33:14] Bram calls out there's a sister standing
[1:33:15] on the platform and brother Bram said
[1:33:17] well he said you you've got a nervous
[1:33:19] condition a nervous trouble he said but
[1:33:21] really you're not you're you're really
[1:33:22] not here for yourself'
[1:33:24] uh there's other troubles you got and
[1:33:25] the main thing is there's a young boy
[1:33:29] about 18 or 19 years old and he's got a
[1:33:33] nervous trouble I see you go to a doctor
[1:33:36] and it's a shock treatment on that boy
[1:33:38] he's a it's a nervous disturbance he's
[1:33:42] self-conscious he don't like to get
[1:33:45] around where people's at he is a
[1:33:48] Christian are you hearing me now the
[1:33:51] spirit of God is Discerning it he is a
[1:33:56] Christian but the devil has bound him

[1:36:59] little letter just a little something he
[1:37:01] likes to try to see if you're going to

[1:37:51] coming I'm coming down here but just
[1:37:52] just really really focus with me here a
[1:37:53] minute an eagle stirreth up her nest and
[1:37:57] brother brandom is talking about you
[1:37:59] know he says you got one that's healed
[1:38:00] and then there's one that sits here it
[1:38:02] it lingers on a little bit there's
[1:38:04] another one another one something's
[1:38:06] wrong somewhere he said sometimes he
[1:38:09] said I think it this is what it is it's
[1:38:10] a complex that people build up now just
[1:38:14] listen he said now you'll resent this
[1:38:18] when I tell you but it's true you take a
[1:38:21] child that's been petted that child
[1:38:24] becomes to a place till it just wants to
[1:38:26] be petted it builds up a complex and you
[1:38:29] can't do nothing with that child until
[1:38:32] you shake them right good he said that's
[1:38:36] how it is when a person gets sick they
[1:38:39] become
[1:38:41] self-pay it here in just a minute that's
[1:38:44] good that's when a person gets sick they
[1:38:45] become self ped oh I'm in such a
[1:38:49] condition I've been prayed for people
[1:38:52] will say well I don't believe I feel any
[1:38:54] better you'll never feel any better like
[1:38:57] that that's not it if that's the
[1:39:00] attitude don't even approach him at all
[1:39:03] cuz it's not right in his sight don't
[1:39:07] have a complex but come with a Burly
[1:39:11] robust faith that it's a settled thing
[1:39:15] God said so and this settles it right
[1:39:19] now now let me just ask you this anybody
[1:39:22] got a button with this button all of a
[1:39:24] sudden you're like there it goes robust
[1:39:27] Faith right if you do can you buy one on
[1:39:31] Amazon for me and prime it to my house
[1:39:35] cuz I'd like to have that button too
[1:39:37] brother Samuel don't you have faith yeah
[1:39:39] but I'm preaching reality right now
[1:39:42] because Faith itself is not something
[1:39:44] you work up that's
[1:39:46] right come on now that's right faith is
[1:39:50] sovereignly revealed it is God's will
[1:39:53] reveal to
[1:39:55] you are you with me remember when we
[1:39:58] started this series back in September
[1:40:00] it's being in the right place having our
[1:40:03] lives as a channel that's open to God
[1:40:05] that that can drop at any time right so
[1:40:08] good but here that that part of Faith
[1:40:10] well where does faith come from comes
[1:40:12] from the word of God right sometimes
[1:40:16] let's just get down home with this
[1:40:18] sometimes you you you it maybe in your
[1:40:20] feeling and how you feel and you think
[1:40:23] oh man man I here's a few days that's
[1:40:25] went by and man I don't feel like I've
[1:40:26] really been you know in prayer and and
[1:40:28] talked to the Lord and and and but let
[1:40:30] me just tell you something don't make
[1:40:31] prayer some
[1:40:33] tradition where you got to go put on
[1:40:35] some kind of robe with tassels hanging
[1:40:37] down and don't make a tradition you can
[1:40:39] talk to him at every time let me just
[1:40:42] tell you something even in the times
[1:40:43] where it just seemed like that man it
[1:40:45] don't seem like it seem like everything
[1:40:46] is pulled out of you but there still at
[1:40:48] that time if you'll just raise your
[1:40:49] hands and say Lord you're worthy amen
[1:40:52] you may not be doing nothing but just
[1:40:54] worshiping him but let me tell you
[1:40:56] something he will draw
[1:41:02] nigh my God is not an idol he's not a
[1:41:05] tradition he's not an imagination he is
[1:41:08] a living reality he is a
[1:41:14] being
[1:41:19] Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah yes
[1:41:22] it's good in it
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:25] yeah that is so good
[1:41:28] sometimes it's just where you put on a
[1:41:31] message and you just put it on and you
[1:41:34] know what you're not even worrying about
[1:41:37] trying to get everything set the right
[1:41:40] way you just put it on and maybe you put
[1:41:43] it on and say you know what I've got to
[1:41:45] go and I got to put a load in the
[1:41:46] laundry yep right and you put it there
[1:41:49] on the dryer and you go ahead and have
[1:41:51] it going you know what's happening
[1:41:52] there's an atmosphere that's being
[1:41:54] created amen whether you whether you
[1:41:57] realize it or not but when you begin to
[1:41:59] move within that aspect of it right
[1:42:01] there because you may not even have the
[1:42:03] strength at that moment to open the
[1:42:04] Bible you've got other things going on
[1:42:06] but you're realizing the atmosphere
[1:42:08] needs to be changed and as an amateur
[1:42:11] God as a son and daughter of God I have
[1:42:13] the authority to change the atmosphere
[1:42:15] how do you change the atmosphere you
[1:42:18] change it by the word of God and you'll
[1:42:21] put it on and all of a sudden you'll
[1:42:22] find an atmosphere being changed I
[1:42:24] guarantee you one thing you'll think
[1:42:26] it's by chance you're picking out a
[1:42:28] message but you watch God will drop
[1:42:30] something right out of that message you
[1:42:32] know why because he knows where you're
[1:42:34] at Elijah he still has angels that are
[1:42:38] dispatched that will drop what you have
[1:42:40] need right by the Brook

[1:44:38] ahead of me there when you get to
[1:44:40] pitying yourself you want everybody to
[1:44:43] pity you and you pity yourself I hit
[1:44:47] that spot one time oh I love the
[1:44:51] transparency of God's prophet
[1:44:54] I hit that spot one time sitting right
[1:44:57] there on the porch with a breakdown
[1:44:59] staying 8 days in meetings without
[1:45:01] coming out for food sleep or anything I
[1:45:03] stayed right in the platform praying for
[1:45:04] the sick I got to a place notice I got
[1:45:07] to a place and I said well I just can't
[1:45:11] feel any
[1:45:12] better he got to that place I just can't
[1:45:16] feel any
[1:45:19] better but one day he said I heard a
[1:45:21] scream right and I heard it in a little
[1:45:25] book called Christian confession if
[1:45:27] you've never read that that on healing
[1:45:28] thoughts by FF Bosworth powerful book if
[1:45:31] you if you read it you'll realize

[1:45:40] an eagle scream through a little book
[1:45:42] called Christian confession by FF
[1:45:44] Bosworth that Christians they confess
[1:45:47] not what they see but what they believe
[1:45:49] don't make any difference what you're
[1:45:50] looking at we don't see by sight we see
[1:45:53] by our faith no
[1:45:56] self-pity just speak the word I'm the
[1:46:00] Lord who heals all thy diseases I don't
[1:46:05] care what your conditions are if you'll
[1:46:09] lay a hold on the wings of God's Eternal
[1:46:12] promise this morning and say it is mine
[1:46:17] it belongs to me something in me called
[1:46:20] me here to this Tabernacle to be be

[1:47:04] sealed you let me pause here for a
[1:47:06] minute or brother Samuel I don't believe
[1:47:08] that I have the token yet then let me

[1:48:44] here to make good on every Divine
[1:48:47] promise so
[1:48:49] good let's bow our heads
[1:48:55] Heavenly
[1:48:57] Father dear
[1:49:00] God you see Lord how the enemy has
[1:49:03] wanted to hinder this even
[1:49:08] today Lord you permitted it and he
[1:49:12] wanted to afflict my
[1:49:14] wife Dear God but how you rich in
[1:49:19] Mercy have sweeped down lord God
[1:49:23] and
[1:49:25] father I believe for every one of our
[1:49:27] needs that's right here this morning oh
[1:49:30] I believe that Lord I believe right here
[1:49:32] this morning that there is not one
[1:49:35] person not one person has to walk out of
[1:49:38] here the same way they came in I believe
[1:49:42] Lord that there has been realities
[1:49:46] deliverances healing I believe the Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost has went forth right while the
[1:49:50] word's being preached
[1:49:52] and Lord even as we would stand here and
[1:49:54] agree together maybe there is one that
[1:49:57] would
[1:49:58] say I I I need I need help I need
[1:50:00] strength I need Faith United with my
[1:50:02] faith and Lord God as we would go to
[1:50:05] pray and lay hands on one another
[1:50:08] according to your word you said if they
[1:50:10] shall lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:50:13] recover so Lord we're not coming to
[1:50:16] approach your word based on a formality
[1:50:19] we are coming in Divine obedience from
[1:50:22] our heart we believe Lord that the
[1:50:25] quickening power is in the body the same
[1:50:29] quickening power that raised our lord
[1:50:31] Jesus from the grave the same quickening
[1:50:34] power that has moved Upon Our Life to
[1:50:37] Quicken us and bring us Lord into this
[1:50:39] place and so completely Quicken our
[1:50:42] lives and change our very nature we
[1:50:45] believe that quickening power Lord
[1:50:46] moving in the body is present Lord right
[1:50:50] here to break every complex
[1:50:53] amen any City that's standing in the
[1:50:57] front
[1:51:00] of not a man out of a civil
[1:51:03] war but out of one in the front of one
[1:51:05] of your
[1:51:07] children your Prophet was asked the
[1:51:09] question as he brought
[1:51:11] it in greatest battle ever
[1:51:14] fought how do we how do we do this how
[1:51:17] do we go about this he said you do it
[1:51:20] just like Grant did in the war
[1:51:23] you take it as you come to it Grant took
[1:51:27] Richmond when he got to
[1:51:30] it you can't worry about something else
[1:51:33] and looking far off let's let's let the
[1:51:35] Holy Spirit what he has ministered right

[1:51:44] the Holy Ghost let's take it let's say
[1:51:46] right here this this is my this is the
[1:51:49] morning right here
[1:51:53] if it's a
[1:51:55] complex right here this morning right
[1:51:57] here the Lord has brought it face to
[1:51:59] face I see what that is I see how it's
[1:52:01] hindered maybe right here in the middle
[1:52:03] of this time there's things that's been
[1:52:05] built in your life and the spirit of God
[1:52:07] has wooed you right back in your heart
[1:52:10] and the gold of God is rising in your
[1:52:13] life and you want to say Lord Jesus I
[1:52:16] accept my Deliverance Oh Glory the fog

[1:52:33] am I accept that Lord maybe there's one
[1:52:37] here this morning

[1:52:42] need and ask the question what must I do
[1:52:47] to be
[1:52:48] saved what must I do Lord Jesus
[1:52:54] may they rise and take that promise
[1:52:58] repent be baptized in the name of the
[1:53:01] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:53:03] your
[1:53:05] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:53:08] the Holy
[1:53:10] Ghost glory be to
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] God oh brother Samuel you don't know the
[1:53:17] habits in my life I'll tell you right
[1:53:19] now if you continue to focus on those
[1:53:21] habits you'll never
[1:53:24] move but you need to take your eyes off
[1:53:27] of your habits off of your circumstance
[1:53:30] and you need to put them onto the one
[1:53:33] whose voice is speaking to you I'm
[1:53:35] talking to the Lord about the Lord Jesus
[1:53:38] Christ you put your eyes on Calvary
[1:53:41] don't let the devil distract you and get
[1:53:43] your eyes on your habits that that is
[1:53:46] Satan's entanglement but put your eyes
[1:53:49] on
