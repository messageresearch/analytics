amen we're just happy to be with you tonight um if you would just stand with me for a moment here we invite you just to look to the Lord for uh for a moment here in a word of prayer and then we'll go into the scripture tonight let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for a a faith that's been proven Lord we read through the book of Hebrews the 11th chapter they were saw aund they were fed to liance but to Lions but by faith they quenched the violence of fire they overthrew kingdoms though they watered in sheep skins and in deserts they dwelt in caves and yet the world was not worthy of and I'm so grateful tonight Lord you've never left yourself without a witness but though the fire is Raging tonight and though there's trials in our lives there's a people here that are standing on the same word of God that Abraham stood on that Moses stood on that Paul stood on that Peter stood on and tonight we're thankful because it's real to us it's more than just a church Creed it's more than just something we've heard rehearsed time and time again from the pulpit but it's our Our Testimony amen it's our testimony tonight we're so grateful for that kind of a testimony that's the kind of testimony that overcomes the enemy in the darkest and most wicked times Lord we thank you tonight we ask now you just come bless the reading of the word and the ministering thereof father there's many going through trials even tonight but yay though we walk through that Valley of the shadow of death we will still fear no evil because you promised to be with us and Lord we just Commit This Time in your hands now we're grateful that you're here tonight I'm grateful for these that have shown up but most of all Lord you showed up tonight and you're going to show up and you're going to keep showing up you'll never leave us you'll never forsake us bless the ritten of your word now we pray and may you just help the different needs here tonight bless this time we commit it into your hands now and we thank you as we give you all the praise and glory and honor for we ask it all in the mighty name above every other name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says am amen God bless you if you have your Bibles tonight let's look into the book of Nehemiah once again I think I've done the different ones except this one so uh Nehemiah the fth chapter and uh our hero has been through many kinds of situations that we've talked about and uh we're going to look here in Nehemiah the 5ifth chapter tonight he's got to deal with a really rough group of people tonight it's not the guy trying to kill him it's not the guy throwing stones it's not the guy trying to stop him from rebuilding the wall tonight he's going to deal with some church folk tonight amen well praise the Lord I thought a few more you'd laugh about that well praise the the Lord you must all just get along just fine that's good praise God never had a church problem never had a fuss never had somebody well praise God well for us that have had to deal with that I find this uh it's interesting to mean you'll get there if you haven't yet so Nehemiah the fth chapter we're just going to read the first 19 verses here actually is that the whole chapter it might that's the whole chapter well praise the lord we got a whole chapter in today we will here in about two minutes but verse one it says there was a great Cry of the people and of their wives against their Brethren the Jews for there were that said and they said this he said our we our sons and our daughters are many therefore excuse me I just lost my spot therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands Vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dir there were also that said we have borrowed money for the king's tribute and that Upon Our lands and Vineyards yet now our flesh is as the Flesh of our Brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and Vineyards notice Nehemiah says and I was very angry when I heard their cry in these words then I consulted with myself and I rebuked the Nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact user everyone of his brother and I set a great assembly against them and I said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our Brethren the Jews which were sold unto the Heathen and will you even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they their peace and found nothing to answer and I said it is not good that ye do all ought you not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the Heathen our enemies I likewise and my brethren and my servants might exact of them money and corn I pray you let us leave off this Usery restore I pray you to them even this day amen their lands their Vineyards their Olive yards and their houses also the H hundredth part of the money and of the Corn the wine and the oil that you exact of them and they said we will restore them and we and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest then I called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise and I shook my lap and said so God shake out every man from his house and from his labor that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said amen and praised God and the people did this according to this promise more from that time I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah from the 20th year even unto the 2 and 30th year of arch Xerxes the king that is 12 years I my bre have not eaten of the bread of the governor but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them Bread and Wine beside 40 shekels of silver yay even their servants bear rule over the people but so did not I because of the fear of God we'll just stop there tonight may the Lord bless the Read's Bo you may be seated I'd like to speak on a thought tonight the this is a legal word so I'll have to you know might have to Google it I'm Googling people it's great the adjudicator the adjudicator of a greater world we look at our opening scripture here in Nehemiah the 5th chapter and uh just in case uh the it's a little harder to follow there's a group of people they come to Nehemiah and their concerns they had to borrow money just to pay the king's tribute in other words they're borrowing money just to get by a couple of us probably know what I'm talking about tonight amen amen they're just they're Bor they're deep in debt they've mortgaged their lands and now their sons and daughters are in servitude and they've got no way to repay their creditors because they don't even have their lands so in other words they're they're so deep in debt because the bondage is so heavy they just come back to this land they've got nothing there they got no food or anything laid up so they they put themselves in debt to try to stay and to rebuild this wall and to do the work of God and now they're deeper in debt they've ever been before and they're selling their sons and daughters as servants into into slavery amen and I really like this is one of the reasons I really like Nehemiah U my son and and the guy in the Bible but um this guy he doesn't he doesn't mess around I like he just he gets angry and he just deals with it he calls the Nobles and the rulers together and he rebukes them for exacting Usery on their Brethren which they we're not supposed to do in the first place according to the law amen according to Leviticus the 25th chapter it says take thou no user of him or increase but fear thy God that theyy brother may live with thee so when you reading the law about the the law of borrowing when they lended to their brother they weren't supposed to exact Usery or take interest or whatever of them the whole purpose of this he says fear God that your brother may live with you in other words if you're going to lend something to your brother if you're going to help him out do it so that he can continue to live with you you're helping him out you're not taking advantage of him amen praise the Lord somebody so it's it's it's it's relevant not just what the law of Moses says but but why it's that way amen the purpose of the lenting was to help the brother out not to put them in bondage now these people they just come out of bondage amen they'd been there for 70 years and their fathers before them and they've been in Babylon they've been in different places and they were bound they were in bondage they just got out of bondage and right away immediately they find themselves in the same situations now their sons and daughters being sold slaves and listen it's not because they were just spending too much money they wanted to go to Disneyland or they just didn't know how to control their listen they're just trying to get by amen but they find find themselves in binding agreements and and according to the law of lending that they would have probably had there they were contractually obligated but the whole system's rigged against them if we could say it this way kind of like what we got today in America amen the whole thing's just rigged against you you look at your house loans and you look at credit cards and I won't get to preaching all and all that tonight amen but listen the SI the system is not rigged in your favor I'll just say it that way amen it's designed to take advantage of you the the people that are on the lower end of the income bracket the people praise the lord it's it's designed to do that amen and I love it because Nehemiah this great social reformer if I could call him this he calls out these wealthy Nobles and rulers he says listen we just redeemed our Brethren back we literally just got them back to the land a couple months ago we finally got them free we got them this place where they're not in bondage and you're going to turn right around and sell them right back into their into bondage you ought not to do this and these men they couldn't answer because they realized they were caught dead to rights they were literally putting the people right back in the thing that they just came out of amen and he says this thing that you do is not good ought you not to walk notice what he says in the fear of God the same thing the Commandment said fear the lord your God that your brother might live with you amen can I say it this way listen if you say that you love God whom you've seen but you can't love your brother who you who you whom you've seen I mean you you love God whom you've not seen how can you say you don't love your brother whom you have seen amen in other words if you really love God you love your brother you love one another because the Bible commands us to do that but more than that because it's in your heart to do that amen and so Nehemiah calls him out listen if you really cared about these people if you really cared about them you wouldn't be doing this you're taking advantage of them in the weakest place in their life amen am amen and he makes the point listen we could have done the same thing to you as rulers we could charge you taxes and we could take advantage of you but we we chose not to do that because we fear God Amen so in other words this great price that was paid I've talked about it before but there was a great price that was paid to set these people free amen it doesn't make sense to have paid and done so much to get them out of bondages not righteous to put them right back in amen what amazes me about this and and this is this is a whole study on this book but you know what amazes me about this is we talked about toaya many times one of the you had sambot and tobia these different men that come against um Nehemiah that come against the work there of rebuilding in Jerusalem you know here's tobah he's sent threatening letters to Nehemiah he's uh he's he's basically tried to get him killed he's he's subverted the work of God he's withstood what God is trying to do it every every opportunity that he gets amen he s out threatening letters and everything else and yet by the end of this book when you go when when Nehemiah he leaves for a few days and he comes back who is it that's dwelling in the very House of God but but tobiah the very enemy that had opposed the work of God is living in the house of God in a chamber and why this amazes me why I say this is you know why he got away with it he was married into the family he was married into the priesthood you know oh that's my buddy I go hunting with them that's my family well my family's got this rule I got different rules and they would literally take their own people and put them in bondage yet they let the enemy come in and give them free housing in the temple me out somebody amen they're going to put all these people back in slavery and the Very ones trying to bring him into bondage they're giving him a free pass see if we don't watch it we'll do what they do that's what the Jews did in the days of Jesus they would strained a KN but they'll swallow a camel they'll hold you accountable for the littlest things if you're a Pharisee if you're a special person they'll let you get away with murder amen see if we're not careful we let Tobi live in our house amen we're so busy trying to fix everybody else's lives up and trying to micromanage everybody else but we got a Tobi living in our house amen we'll let strife and lust and variance and envy and addiction and backbiting come right into our homes right in our lives and we'll let it run rampant but we'll fight somebody over Christmas well it's that time of the year it's the most oh I better not sing that song now listen I'm not here tonight to preach what you should do with that or not but listen we we'll take stuff in this message and we'll fight you to the death over it and we'll run everybody down and we'll burn every bridge and we'll fight somebody but we'll have bitterness we'll have Strife we'll have a bad attitude we'll get a wrong Spirit we justify that well listen I ain't got this in my home but you got the devil in your home and he's ruining your testimony he's ruining your joy he's taking away the blessing of God from you and you'll let that thing run rampid so you can nitpick somebody else to death amen somebody listen I'm not I'm not here to all fight y'all tonight am amen amen we'll fight people over they're too quiet in church or they're too loud and yet we've got major problems in our life amen if the preacher Don't Preach your pet Doctrine you'll get all puffed up with him and yet things aren't even right in your own house Amen brother B talk about a story and it's in God of being misunderstood I'm just going to paraphrase it for the sake of time brother BR tells this story this this guy come up to him and he was all like brother brandom you got this this girl playing piano in the church and brother brand said she was new in the way and you know she had a good spirit about her but she just wasn't really acclimated to things yet and her hair hair was short amen not justifying that now but he's telling you where she's at she's just a new believer amen and her skirt wasn't quite right and all this stuff and this man coming against brother Brandman it's funny brother BR kind of takes a shot back at him amen well listen and we we believe in Holiness amen but he makes this point you know that when he was confronted you know brother makes it clear he didn't approve of how she looked that he didn't endorse that or whatever but he said this same person had an his church well that tells you kind of what he was dealing with I guess he said the same person had in his church a lady who had long hair and wore long dresses and had a temper enough to fight a buzs saw just as mean as she could be praise God I hope you're not here tonight hope she's streaming just as mean she's got long hair and a long dress just as mean as she could be says long hair and long skirts don't take you to heaven no sir it's the spirit takes you to heaven can I say this way if you got the right kind of a spirit it'll produce the right kind of a life amen but you can try to live right that doesn't mean anything so he's sitting there in his eyeball looking for mistakes hey brother Brandon I thought you were a Pentecostal preacher you I thought you preached Holiness amen see that was easy to see that's what it was it was easy to see see be careful when you're not trying to when you're trying to run everybody else's lives you you don't have to buy it in your house amen cuz what you'll end up doing instead of living closer to God you just get better at hiding what you're doing wrong that's what a lot of people do in church amen they're not actually getting closer to God they just find out how to hide their sin better amen well the preacher thinks I'm a good person the Deacon thinks I'm good and so mommy thinks I'm good and Daddy thinks I'm good but God sees everything amen God is Not mocked he is not deceived amen that's what a lot praise the Lord that's that's what a legalist will do a lot of times they can tell everything about where you're wrong at amen cuz you're not fake about it amen it's all on display that's why they see it so easy amen many times they're putting everybody else in bondage like these guys were doing they put everybody else in bondage with their expectations and their ideas and I know better than everybody else amen but deep down they do it because they know if everybody else isn't good enough that justifies the sin they know they got in their own life amen well PR youall get quiet on me tonight you're not all a bunch of legalists so I mean you should be okay with this listen well and this is not just a preacher but as a preacher yeah I've had people come to me and say well I don't see this how you preach it this way and this and that that's all right they're finding to disagree with me I ain't got no problem with that amen it's a free country that we used to have here yes right brother Brian a nice country you used to have they're allowed to do that that's fine but they will they they'll nitpick because they think that you present a certain thing wrong and they're in deep sin they've got real problems and I'm not saying that to condemn them I'm saying what they need is to get out of sin and in trying to put everybody else in bondage we need to get out of bondage amen let's not try to take the Moto of somebody's eye we got to beam in ours that's what I saying amen praise the Lord see God is not judging us based on what everybody else sees about us God is not judging us tonight based on what everybody else's opinion about us is amen that's what makes him a righteous judge he sees it all he says he sees every wrong motive he sees all the pettiness amen he sees all the duplicity so these people you know what as long as nehemiah's watched them they're going to behave themselves but as soon as Nehemiah steps away for a few days they go right back into the very things they did before amen they take people right back into bondage amen you know I was I was studying this a while back brother B talks about the the vision he's seen in the preview of the Bride he talks about some different places but he talks about in the Masterpiece message in in particular this really caught my attention when I was studying this this one time because you know he talks about the preview the bride he's seen a bride at the beginning and he sees all the different nations they're all marching then he sees the American church at the end she's basically naked she's dancing the rock and roll doing all this stuff and he gets discouraged but then the voice tells the bride will come into preview again and he begins to see a bride she's marching that song something like he said Onward Christian Soldiers and she's marching and she's keeping beat and and and we all know there's there's two three uh sisters or whatever was at the end of the vision they start getting out of line and brother bam calls he says get back in line stay in line now we've heard that a lot of times before I've heard it many times but it's interesting because in this quote here in the Masterpiece brother B says this I have to watch her she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch when she's passing by think about that now if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm overse when I'm finished or whatever it is in other words whenever as long as she got out of line and he was there to watch they would get back in line but his concern was if I'm not there to watch it what are they going to do see if nobody's watching you how you going to act when nobody's there to say hey you need to do this you need to do that amen and I'm thinking if brother Brenham saw that in the 1960s where are we at today in this generation I'm saying this for a reason tonight amen I'm not just trying to wax poetic but I'm saying this for a reason tonight amen if if brother Brandon were to visit some churches that call themselves message churches and his name wasn't William brandom they'd be the first ones to kick him out and man it's easy to CL CL the message when there's no message to tell you you're not preaching what he preached amen praise the lord it's easy for us to present ourselves as message Believers when no one's holding us accountable and everybody thinks we're great praise the Lord somebody you say well how do you know they' kick him out cuz that's what they did to Christ in the latest SE age amen the church was the one that kicked him out behold I stand at the door and I knock amen you say we that's Christ you're talking about brother brandom that was the voice of God to this age it's no different than what they did with the prophet Samuel when they rejected Samuel they didn't reject the man they rejected his gift as a prophet cuz he spoke for God and when the churches of this generation they rejected the message God given they put Christ on the outside why cuz it's so easy to call yourself a church when Christ isn't there to tell you you're not it's easy to call yourself a Christian and live any kind of of a life when the word isn't there to evaluate and to judge and say what you're doing is wrong and the things that are preached today we preach all this Liberty and we preach lasciviousness and sin and all they've done to is give a license to to people to live any kind of a way listen that's not Liberty that's the same bondage they come out of and churches and preachers are putting people right back in the same bondage that God sent a message to get them out of hallelujah amen too many people today and it happens in message churches too we're obsessed with the blessings of God we're obsessed with the power of God but there's no fear of God there's no love of God and that's the only thing that's the only thing that'll get you over there amen it's not how blessed you are it's not how loud you are how intellectual you are it's do you have perfect love cuz if you love that brother you're not going to put him in bondage if you love that sister you're not going to lay a burden on him that you couldn't bear in the first place amen somebody praise the lord it's Christ he's on the outside today the church has rejected him the word they embrac the idea of a man named Jesus that lets him get away with whatever they but they've rejected the word that would not have let them go back into bondage amen but praise God because there's a people on the earth tonight amen we've got some of them here tonight they've recognized the word of God they've recognized the presence of God they're identified with the word of God they've invited him in they've made him feel welcome amen what does the scripture say come out from among them be ye separate say the Lord and touch not the unclean thing separate yourself from man's ideas separate yourself from the world Amen I will receive you I will be a father unto you ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty see everybody oh I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God separate yourself from the unclean thing separate yourself from your own ideas separate yourself from denominational thinking amen separate yourself from the leadership of man's thinking amen I I I think I preached about here last time talking about the over seers and the pastors they come and they scatter the people and one of them was in Jeremiah 23 but I I'm we'll finish reading Jeremiah 23 tonight this next few verses amen because when all looks lost when all the false preachers when all that false church has scattered the people of God into all kinds of different places the Bible says this in verse 5 it says behold the days come sayith the Lord that I will raise unto David A righteous branch and the King shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and Justice in the earth in his days Judah shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely praise the Lord listen we're all worried about Israel listen there's one coming there's one coming they're going to dwell in safety amen they're not going to be utterly destroyed God will take up for his people cuz God made a promise God will not forsake them he cannot forsake them and he cannot forsake you and I amen God will set up a king over them after David this Bible says here verse six in his days Judah shall be saved Israel shall dwell safely and his name whereby he shall be called the Lord our righteousness Jehovah Sindu amen the Lord our righteousness amen what makes you righteous tonight because the same judge that condemns the world the same judge that indicted denomination is the same judge that is testified you're forgiven you're Justified it's like you never did it in the first place the judges spoken over your life amen hallelujah listen if you're free tonight if the son has set you free free then guess what ye are free indeed amen that's not like a hall pass you get out of class for 10 minutes you're free you're free indeed you're the freest people if they put you in jail tonight if they lock you away of prison because of where you stand for the Lord guess what you're still the freest person you're the freest people on the Earth tonight amen listen I know the system's rigged we live in a generation where the system I'm not just talking about finances now amen church is the system is rigged you want to be a part of this fellowship if you want to be liked by this certain Church you got to do this and you got to do such and such and this and that friends listen if it's just going to put you right back into bondage it's never worth it how much do you value your freedom tonight amen listen if they raise the taxes by 1% tomorrow we'd be Marching In the Streets if they want to take our guns or do something to us as Americans we'd be up in arms we'll go to Schoolboard meetings and we'll fight perversion and we'll fight nonsense amen but we'll go and put ourselves into bondage to man's ideas the religious thinking Amen to our own ideas about things amen listen if it's going to put you in bondage it's never worth it you don't have to worry tonight about being everybody's best friend amen you don't have to strive to be accepted by the world you don't have to look for popularity you look for the fire of God the light of God over your dwelling you look for a token in your life amen tonight I want to stand in the fear of God and holy reverence knowing that I'm clean in his sight tonight you're accepted amen for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them who believe amen praise the Lord you know brother one brother brand one time he was in Chicago and uh of course you seen a vision of it they told him they' set a trap for him there they were going to try and and and they were they were going to come against him for the message of Grace and how he preached serp seed water baptism amen listen all those men decided they were against that man William br him listen when he walked in that room that day he didn't have one friend with him except for the Lord Jesus Christ and you know what he prevailed Jesus Christ prevailed amen listen if you stand for Christ he said I'll Stand For You amen you believe that tonight listen you don't need anybody else to stand with you tonight except Jesus Christ if Christ is for you who can be against you tonight amen am I I love the words of the Apostle Paul he says henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall shall give me at that day and not to me only but to all them that love his appearing amen is there anybody here tonight say I love his appearing amen we love his appearing that's what we live for and listen if your heart wasn't right before God you should dread that or you would dread it or you should dread it amen because listen if you recognize he's coming back to judge the world he's also coming back to redeem a people amen so if you're right in the sight of God the coming of the Lord is to change this vile body unto a glorious body liken unto his own amen but if your heart's not right with God it doesn't matter who's impressed with you or who's your best buddy amen see the coming of the Lord doesn't change your character right well you know if I do this and this and that and such and such listen the the coming of the Lord doesn't change your character it just changes your body amen changes your Dwelling Place our character is not what we act like at church amen our character is not who we are when Nehemiah is looking amen it's not who we are when the pastor's watching us what do we like when no one's around do we have a life that's worthy of the Gospel amen listen stand for Christ in a message church tonight we're in a message church right listen if you stand for Christ here that's not really that hard I hope it's not anyway it's not really hard to say I Believe In Christ I'm going to stand for the that's easy to do in a group of people that all say and believe the same thing amen but what if you were the only one at your church that stood for the truth maybe at your job or work or your family listen some of you have been there before you know what I'm talking about you might have been the only one in your family that believed this word but you stood for them amen you stood for my mommy and daddy didn't stand for it when they didn't know and God rewarded you and you're here tonight amen well praise the Lord some of you got some of you got a great reward coming for that amen that'll make you a little happy tonight you know what I stood for Christ when it wasn't popular when it wasn't easy when it wasn't accepted when nobody else in my family when no one else that I knew was with me and yet I stood for him and he stood for me and the righteous judge he's laid up a crown I've got a crown waiting for me amen it's more than just a house it's more than just an address of the new city you got a crown waiting for you amen why cuz you stood for him when nobody else want to stand for him amen we talk about about this idea of adjudication I titled this the adjudicator greater World an adjudicator amen it's a it's a legal term to adjudicate it means to to render a Judicial opinion and so the the usage of it has evolved somewhat over time and the definition kind of differs depending on which country and stuff even but I want just just give you an idea what we're talking about let's take the idea of of arbitration for example amen when you have an arbitration you've got these two different parties and you know they're disputing over a certain point of the law or grievance so in the interests of avoiding a court proceeding they decide they're going to sit down and get an Arbiter or an arbitrator to sit down as an intermediary to come to an acceptable resolution in the hope that if they abide by the arbiter's findings that they can avoid going to court now this is the role of Christ in the church today amen the Bible tells us in in first Timothy chapter 2 verse 5 there is one God and there's one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus now I think it's noteworthy the scripture say the man Christ Jesus amen because the humanity of Christ is important in this context of IM mediator you say why because for the parties to have a mediator there must be some common ground for them to meet on so God could not meet you just as a Divine spirit in your Humanity in your Fallen nature so God had to come down because you couldn't get up to him amen he was the one that was that was that you you were the one that was guilty and he was the judge so he had to make a way cuz you couldn't make a way the law couldn't make a way your obedience couldn't make a way even your faith couldn't make way but it brought God down and so the man Christ Jesus he's the meteor he's the Common Ground that's mutually acceptable to both parties amen Christ is fully a man yet he's fully God Amen now I would just say this too because you know I some people some people I know they preach that he's no longer that now but for him to continue to be a mediator he must still be a man today amen now he's not just a man he's more than a man he's an eternal spirit he's living in his church but there is a body of Christ amen on the earth spiritually but he has a representation he's sitting tonight amen in Heavenly places and that's why our vile body shall be changed like his own he has a body he didn't dissolve and turn into nothing amen praise the Lord so he's still fully a man and yet fully God Amen it's the same reason according to Hebrews the 9th chapter that he is the mediator of the New Testament he's also the testator of this Testament because the last will and testament is of no no Force while the testator liveth the Bible says so in other words God as a spirit couldn't die for you to give you this inheritance but God through his son Jesus Christ died and rose again that you might be an heir of God and a joint heir of Jesus Christ amen through his death we receive the promise of Eternal inheritance amen praise the Lord hallelujah he's the only mediator tonight William Brand's not the mediator the Apostle Paul's not the mediator Christ is the only mediator of the New Testament because he's the only one the father permits to mediate amen so it has to be somebody that we that both parties agree to now there's many people today that don't want Christ to be the mediator they want a pope or a preacher or their favorite minister or whatever they've got different ideas they want open for Winfrey or whatever else they want some other person to be the the mediator but Christ is the only one that God agreed to amen that's why he's the only mediator amen now a man has a right to refuse the mediator legally amen and certainly do that today they reject the offer of Salvation given by Christ or maybe they try to find another mediator but listen it's in our best interests to accept this mediator amen because if both parties cannot reach a mutual agreement guess what their judge their case is taken to the judgment and this is where the adjudicator comes in amen see right now he is a mediator but always he is an adjudicator amen so this adjudicator it can be somebody that's nominated they're elected or maybe they're agreed upon but many times the the judge appoints the adjudicator amen he's a person that's appointed to judge a case and he appoints this adjudicator and once the adjudicator is appointed no no we're not all lawyers tonight but stay with me for a second we're not all lawyers but what's the adjudicator is appointed he has the legal authority to render any decision and the court upholds that decision amen the adjudicator can even set precedent for a case for something that's not even happened yet in other words he can literally say if this happens this is how we're going to handle it and the court upholds the decision of the adjudicator and whatever contingency he's laid out to expedite future cases amen so he can even determine ahead of time what the rules are and the court has to follow all that so I know this is all real Technical and I'm just kind of touching on it really and and I know you all didn't pay for your your college tuition to listen to business law 101 amen but the Arbiter the arbitrator is there to negotiate between two parties amen but the adjudicator is there to render a verdict amen now like I said Christ is the mediator of the New Covenant today but he will not always be that mediator there is a time he comes off The Mercy Seat amen but he is the adjudicator or the judge the by which the world will be judged amen John 5:22 says for the father judgeth no man right Jesus said the father judgeth no man but he hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honth not the son honth not the Father which has sent him in other words you can't say you honor the judge if you don't honor the one he's sent to judge the case if you don't honor the adjudicator and you don't up you don't uphold or you don't abide by what he says then how can you say you abide by the father amen verily verily I say un you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath past tense hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life now how could he say that because the Judgment hasn't come yet he can say it because he's an adjudicator he can saved because it's his right to declare if you do this your verdict has already been rendered you've already passed from death into life no man can change it there's no higher court of appeal there's no Double Jeopardy no one can overturn that it's already been settled barely verely I say unto you the hour is coming and now is that was 2,000 years ago what about tonight the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of man and they that hear shall live for as the father hath life in himself so ha he given to the son to have life in himself and ha given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the Son of Man Marvel not at this and that's pretty wild Marvel not at this for the hour is coming which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good under the resurrection of life and they that have done Evil under the resurrection of damnation I can of my own self do nothing listen he did not presume this Authority he say you know what I want to be the judge of the world I'm going to go down there and judge everybody like some of my church people do amen I'm not doing this of my own accord I didn't do this of myself he was appointed to it as I hear I judge Amen in other words he's he's heard all the legal EAS he knows exactly what it takes amen he says as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which ha sent me amen now since he's the adjudicator he represents the full authority of the will of the justice system he can issue a ruling before the appointed time and that judgment will be upheld this is why Jesus says in St John chap 12 notice what he says says here now the Bible is not contradicting itself he's showing you something he says if anyone hears my words and believe not I judge him not well no wait I thought you said he was the judge watch but he's already issued something is what it is I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the world well now wait a minute if you're trying to save the world then where's the Judgment come in notice he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath won judge him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day in other words listen I'm here to try to save everybody but if they don't receive this the judgment is already there amen they're not going to get condemned they were already condemned we all come to the world born separated from God come into the world speaking Liv we were condemned from the GetGo but there was one that come to bail us out he doesn't need to go find everybody guilty sin the law has already concluded that but he found some that says but you know what I'll take that plea bargain I'll take that deal there's one that made a way for me out my sin had to be judged he couldn't be brushed away it couldn't be put in a closet somewhere but somebody's paying for it and if you receive him you receive life amen you've all already passed from Death unto life listen I believe that's what brother B saw in 1963 he sees the cloud amen he sees this wigged one and he began to ask different people I think he talks about he he asked brother Jack Moore why does Christ have white hair brother Jack said well that's his glorified body that's that's just how he looks now brother said it just didn't ring true to him for some reason amen it just didn't ring true with him he began to look and he was look in the Book of Daniel in the Bible begin to talk in the Book of Daniel about the Ancient of Days whose hair was like pure well and again in Revelation the first chapter when John turns to see the voice that spoke to him and he beholds one like the son of man what does he see his head and his hair were white as the snow and brother BR says this in 1965 trying to do got a service he says he's wigged with that white angel wig Hallelujah that the message of him being God is the truth he is the Supreme judge of the universe Supreme judge of Heaven and Earth he is God and nothing else but God he is God expressed in human form called the son of man which the son was the man Hallelujah in case you didn't catch it yet clarifies it if that don't make our message exactly right identified by the scripture identified in service identified by his presence the same yesterday today and forever therefore those seven seals are the truth Brethren amen amen why does he appear as a judge at the end of seven Church changes now we know he's going to judge the world actually his word is going to judge the world so why does he appear in this form brother say it's to vindicate that this message is the truth in other words to vindicate that this word is the word that will judge the world Amen he's rendered his opinion amen he's rendered his legal judgment already and this Cloud this judge appeared it speaks to you and I this message is the thing why is it after brother brandom preaches the opening of his seals he comes back and preaches an indictment why because it couldn't be judged amen it was a carrier of that life God used that but once the fullness of the word come once the judge validated this the word whereby I will judge the Gentile Nations now a verdict could be rendered that they were found weight in the balances they were found wanting amen now some people take this whole idea they take it out of context and they say well see Christ he's if he's judging he's no longer on The Mercy Seat he's come off that's why he preach the seals but listen if he's no longer mediating then no one can get saved because there's no other place to mediate Amen in other words it's no longer the New Testament therefore salvation have to come some other way other than what the scripture mentions and most of the people that preach that their way is their church doctrine or their Revelation or whatever it is and see what it does becomes a tool to put people in bondage just like we read about the beginning well if you don't see it my way or my Revelation or my church and it's a tool of fear to bring people into bondage amen but listen this word of God you can be in the middle of the desert you can be sitting in your home it doesn't matter you're Justified because he said it and you believe it and that settles it you don't need you don't need somebody else to judge or qualify that the Supreme judge has already put his stamp of approval on thus say the Lord through the prophet Malachi 4 it's Vindicated it's approved of God tonight the same thing that judges the denominations has set you and I free tonight Amen brother bam said I can show you where the god started the apostolic age you show me where he took it out it's funny we read that quote but you know what God put in the apostolic age 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that means tonight if you want the Holy Ghost you get the same way they got it back there in the book of Acts it's not a different Doctrine it's not a different kind of a message it's the fullness of what was preached amen so what does it mean if he's a mediator why is he judged why why is he wigged it testifies the Supreme judge has Vindicated this message amen that the word has been restored according to ma Malachi CH 4 Luke 17:30 man-made systems have been judged that's why the prophet preaches their their Blasphemous names amen so even this is what I'm getting at they're still around today there's still denominational churches around today yet they've already been judged by the word amen Brotherman this future home message paragraph 3 385 he's talking about Isaiah the 4th chapter scripture we've probably heard many times but he says this in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach now I've heard this used different ways different times but brother B reads this scripture and he says that's at the end time where we're living now amen that's the condition of marriage and divorce today that's the spiritual condition of the churches today they all want to dress how they want they all want to feed on what they want but they want to be called Christians amen but the prophet said any church that puts aside the leadership of the Holy Ghost it's the world with his name attached to it so they want to claim the name of Jesus but they want to reject the word and the leadership it's already been condemned now this would be discouraging for many of us to say well this the day we live in but you know what there's there's more in that chapter besides that first verse he says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and cly for them that are escaped of Israel and it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purg the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning and the Lord will create upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon all her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and The Shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense Amen in other words God's going to put a light over your dwelling he's already put a cloud over it but he's going to put a light over your dwelling place it's the glory of God and the glory of God will be a defense to you in a generation when the world's falling apart when man's systems are falling apart and religion has failed there's a light there's a token over our homes amen though there's darkness in the land of Egypt there's light and go tonight amen we are not in darkness we are not sitting tonight in Gross Darkness we've got the light the light has appeared the Vindicated word has declared you're not guilty with the world you're not condemned with the world tonight brother Ram said that's the this what he says in future say that's the Holy Ghost and Fire amen it's the Holy Ghost and Fire and it's keeping me alive it's keeping you alive it's keeping us alive amen my my my my it is Justified it has cleansed it has regenerated us amen listen I believe tonight you don't have to wait to get a token any more than denomination has to wait to be judged it's here now amen the token is here now to testify every one of us was guilty every one of us deserved judgment but the mediator made us a deal he suffered and died for our sins and he rose again amen Heath made him to be sin who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness Jehovah can do amen the Lord is our righteousness he is our righteousness and now we've been made his righteousness amen we might be made the righteousness of God in him you believe that tonight listen if you believe that with all your heart and you've confessed that with your mouth you believe that Christ died and rose again and you've repented of your sins God's obligated to give you the Holy Ghost amen why cuz he promised it but listen it's more than just that he he he's he's obligated to brother BR said God wants you to have it more than you want it and me tonight the problem is not that the judge is out to get us amen the problem is we haven't accepted the verdict if we don't have the Holy Ghost tonight amen whatever our need is we don't need to go try to get a ruling passed down from the judge see that's where many of us struggle we go and we petition the Lord I wish you'd help me with this and I wish you'd do that and God has already done it God said I've already judged you sin I've already judged that sickness in your life I've already judged that mind battle that depression that you're dealing with I've already said you're not guilty I've condemned the thing you don't have to get my permission you go you're an ambassador of Christ you cast it out who is he that condemneth Paul says is Christ that died ye rather is risen again listen Satan cannot condemn you tonight amen help me out somebody Satan cannot condemn you tonight the preacher cannot condemn you tonight amen the world cannot condemn you tonight you can't condemn you tonight there's only one person that can condemn you tonight is Jesus Christ who already said you're Justified you're forgiven if he has said you're not condemned then you can't be condemned with the world Amen in other words who is he that condemns there's only one that can do it and he's already passed his sentence not guilty on them that receive the word I can't be condemned you can't be condemned because the only one with the actual authority to condemn has already wrote pardon on your book amen listen if you want to know can can a man be saved today you don't have to find that out he's already declared it amen we were already wounded or he excuse me he was already wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are already healed he say I don't feel well tonight listen I don't either amen I come here with his headache I'm like man this is it's always the best time you know brother Bill what's going on I don't know if I'm getting older or what but listen it doesn't matter how I feel it matters what he said he said everything all the powers of Darkness for this reason was the son of God manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil it's already defeated tonight you're already healed you're already saved you didn't just get saved you recognize you recognize what the judge said about you 2,000 years ago that you were saved 2,000 years ago actually you were saved before the foundation of the world the Supreme judge had you in his mind the whole time he said you're not guilty oh but I fail God but you're not guilty tonight listen but I made mistakes but you're not guilty tonight listen I've let God down so many times but he's lifted you up every time you're not guilty tonight A righteous man falls seven times but you know what the difference is between him and the unbeliever he gets back up you can stay on the ground you can stay defeated or you can get back up but God's made a way for me God Made A Way listen I'm not hoping to make it tonight if you're hoping to make it tonight don't stay there don't hope no amen say I know I'm going to make I I I know I'm going to make it no I don't know I'm going to make it I've already made it I know I've already made it cuz he said so and if he said it you know my wife and I were just talking the other day she she brought this up you know I preached her a while back about you know brother BR went be on the curtain of time and he his little Sharon Rose and she was waiting for Billy Paul took him 86 years to get there I think she was I think he was two I think he was two when she passed away took him 86 years to get there but he got there and she made this point you know this is really something if you're Billy Paul you know she was already waiting for you that means she knew you were going to make it hallelujah amen listen if God has declared a thing amen if brother B could look and see there's there I am Crossing with my wives and there's or manev listen that ought to give you so much encouragement because God can't change his mind about his judgment about you he said but I never been in the vision I never this I never that listen you've got a more sure word of Prophecy tonight you've got thus sayi the Lord according to the scripture that's greater than the vision amenu that's greater actually brother said if one of these Visions wasn't according to the word to throw it out why cuz the word is the judge that's how you judge prophecy that's what you that's how you judge right or wrong the word is the judge and listen the same word judged the things in your life that are coming against you if you're sick tonight your sickness has already been judged I'm the Lord thy God which heals all your diseases amen that forgive us all that iniquities you know years ago I don't know who's going to catch this but whatever ever here we are who's listening but you know years ago I was in a church I might have told Brother Brian this story but I was in a church and I was I'd walked out my my son Nehemiah he was just a little baby at the time basically one or two I guess it's not a baby but you know how you know how parents are toddler whatever he was I took him out I'm in the vesle and there was this young lady she this is her first time being in church I'd never seen her there before and she was sitting up against the wall in the VES and I began to speak to her I said uh can I ask you what's going on said oh my head hurts I've never had a headache that's bad I feel sick I said can you wait here just a second I want to read something to you I grabbed my Bible and I I read Isaiah 53 to her that with his stripes I said now this is speaking of Christ I said you now listen this is not a church person this is not a scholar or a theologian just some young teenage girl I said now you read this does that speak of Christ she said yes I said Do you believe what this says she said yes I believe it I said then if you believe believe that then you're already healed according to the scripture and God raised her right up there that night and she walked right back to the service completely healed now that was a good testimony I'm like yeah praise God you know what's really funny I had somebody get offended about that they come and said well listen the preacher preaching this and that and stuff and and you should have waited this that I'm like I'm not going to make her weight with a headache listen Christ dealt with the same thing Christ well praise the Lord somebody well listen this this woman you there's seven days in a week you didn't have to heal her on the Sabbath you could have waited he said listen bunch of Hypocrites if you had an ox in the ditch on the Sabbath you'd get it out and ought not this daughter of Abraham be set free listen I'm not going to wait if she's got a need Christ is not waiting to render his verdict on it he's already spoken about it who am I to hold it back amen that girl when she was sitting there she didn't get healed she was already healed she just recognized it farby any man or any preacher any other person to try to hold that back listen I'm this is the way I see it if God hadn't already approved it he did there that's why I said well listen if you really had an issue with it you should take it up with the Lord cuz she got healed if you don't like it take it up with him wasn't me that did it it was the Lord that did it so I guess God made a mistake should have waited till the end of the service you see how the now that sounds funny but that's how the car that's how the religious mind is it puts the blessing over here listen one day you'll get delivered one day you'll be good enough one day you'll be accepted no you're accepted now because he said it if Satan can gets you to put off to another day brother Bim said that's as good as he wants it you'll never get get it just accept it's yours right now by faith it's settled the judge said you're not guilty you're not guilty tonight amen listen you and I have a grand opportunity tonight to do something amen it's more than just praying you say well it could be greater than praying listen lots of people pray about lots of things they pray to lots of things it doesn't mean anything but tonight right you can do more than just pray you can believe amen you can pray and believe Jesus said when you pray believe right then you have what you asked for and you shall have it now if the judge said that then I can't overturn that and you can't overturn that you can't overturn that in your own life or somebody else's amen you know what you can do though you could thank him amen you could say Amen Lord I believe that I accept it you can praise him I believe the report that he gave on the cross it is finished amen listen you're going to have that confidence that David did when he faced G I love how brother R talks about and why Christ speak he said you know what there's David getting ready to face Goliath and and I love how brother Ram says it he says he didn't pray through he was already prayed through God prayed him through before the foundation of the world Amen he was anointed for the job he had to speak the word and go forward tonight you're not speaking your idea about what God did for you and if you are you can throw that out amen you're speaking what God said about your life when we bring it to pass he's already judged it amen it's all already settled Thy word oh lord it's settled we ought to be settled tonight if the word is settled we can be settled about his word you believe that tonight as you stand to your feet you know what the amazing thing about that is laws change all the time governments change all the time look at the laws in this country how they've changed in the last decade and you think about all the nations and the kingdoms that have ever been the different types of governments we do history with the kids at home it's crazy how much the world has changed in th000 years but you know what his judgment has never had to be altered he's never had to set a new precedent he's never had to change his mind it's not in his nature to do that amen if you said you were healed 2,000 years ago you're still healed tonight if you said you were righteous 2,000 years ago you're righteous tonight amen don't fall back into a snare of bondage in your life don't go back into that thing that you the Lord paid such a great price to bring you out of Amen none of us are probably going to go down to the denominational church this weekend how many times in our own life will we let our own insecurity our own expectations our own ideas limit somebody else limit ourselves amen tonight he's greater than your judgment right or the the the the chief or the Supreme Court or whatever amen his verdict is true his words are faithful and they're true you believe that tonight amen uh give me the key of uh a [Music] flat oh the blood that Jesus shed for [Music] me away back on calary oh it's
