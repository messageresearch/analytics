[37:19] while I live will I praise the Lord will
[37:24] I praise the Lord I will sing praises
[37:26] unto my god while I have any being put
[37:32] not your trust in Princes nor in the Son
[37:36] of man in whom there is no help his
[37:39] breath goeth forth he returned it to his
[37:42] earth in that very day his thoughts tear
[37:47] happy as he that hath the God of Jacob
[37:50] for his help
[37:52] whose hope is in the Lord is God which
[37:56] made heaven and earth the sea and all
[37:59] that therein is which keepeth truth
[38:03] forever which executed judgment for the
[38:08] oppressed which giveth food to the
[38:11] hungry the Lord loose me loosen the
[38:16] prisoners the Lord opened the eyes of
[38:20] the blind the Lord raiseth them that are
[38:23] bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous
[38:26] the Lord preserveth the strangers he
[38:31] relieving the fatherless and widow but
[38:35] the way of the wicked he turneth upside
[38:38] down the Lord shall reign forever even
[38:42] though God o Zion unto all generations
[38:46] praise ye the Lord amen may God bless
[38:52] you as you're being seated and I just
[38:56] would like to take a very very simple
[39:02] title here this morning and we know that
[39:07] it certainly is not in the length of the
[39:11] title but it is in the author coming to
[39:17] express that title and make it real to
[39:21] our hearts and I just want to speak
[39:25] these words happy Easter the things too
[39:32] as we find that brother branham would
[39:35] mention it like this to us in the great
[39:37] and mighty Conqueror
[39:39] and he would speak of he says may it be
[39:43] that it's a happy Easter to everyone of
[39:46] us it's one of the greatest days this is
[39:49] a commemoration of the resurrection of
[39:52] our Lord it's one of the greatest days
[39:54] of all the world's history it's the
[39:57] resurrection and this is this is where
[40:01] our our happiness and our reality is
[40:05] tied to not just that he raised but we
[40:11] have also raised with him and because of
[40:17] what it means to to us as as believers I
[40:24] realized that this you know maybe would
[40:27] seem to be a peculiar text that would be
[40:30] read for a time of Easter but to look at
[40:36] it it is it is something that just
[40:39] filling on my heart to move in this
[40:43] direction and perhaps the Lord will help
[40:46] us then too to see this when we look in
[40:50] the scriptures I I take I take that
[40:53] thought because we know that Easter
[40:56] itself is more than just a time of the
[41:00] year it's more than just a memorial if
[41:05] if it's only just a memorial to us and
[41:08] there is no more than just that of
[41:11] something that we remember or something
[41:14] were you know many times people will
[41:16] come together as a family
[41:18] and yet many of the things not even
[41:21] realizing why this is what is it about
[41:24] this moment that would be so special
[41:28] that would cause us to remember remember
[41:30] the Lord Jesus when he was unfolding the
[41:37] Varon the Passover when he had said I
[41:40] desired to eat this Passover with you
[41:42] remember when he he had taken the bread
[41:45] and blessed it and then he took the cup
[41:47] and blessed it and he spoke of the bread
[41:50] he said take and eat this is my body
[41:53] and he said drink of this of this of the
[41:55] cup he said for in this this is the
[41:58] blood of the New Testament or the life
[42:01] contained therein and He blessed that to
[42:04] know that there would be through the
[42:07] varying through the very offering up of
[42:11] his life that here that we you and I
[42:15] would receive what we would have need of
[42:19] to actually come to a living reality in
[42:24] our lives with God and we we see this
[42:29] and I want to draw your attention to the
[42:34] students sure of Psalms 146 and
[42:38] verse 5 and the scripture would say
[42:42] happy is he that hath the God of Jacob
[42:46] for his help I I just feel to stop here
[42:49] for a moment I want you right here if
[42:52] you've got a need on your heart you
[42:54] already know this but I feel an unction
[42:56] of the Holy Ghost you pray upon your
[42:59] heart and you ask God Lord you come
[43:01] speak to my heart this morning now as I
[43:05] read this scripture in verse 5 happy is
[43:08] he that hath the God of Jacob for his
[43:12] help whose hope is in the Lord his God
[43:17] notice not happy was are not happy will
[43:20] be but happy is and this word happy is
[43:25] also the word that is used you will find
[43:29] it used in the in the Hebrew that speaks
[43:32] of blessedness of the blessedness that
[43:36] would reside in the heart and life of
[43:40] the believer happy is he that hath the
[43:43] God of Jacob for himself this speaks of
[43:46] a present tense a living reality this is
[43:51] not something of a past event it's a
[43:54] living reality and this is why that as
[43:59] the believers as the believers as a
[44:03] child of God
[44:05] we should be the happiest people in the
[44:09] world because not only has Jesus raised
[44:13] from the dead but he's here with us the
[44:18] same faith that was once delivered to
[44:21] the Saints that they have contended for
[44:24] that saying faith is right here among us
[44:29] that same God working among us to show
[44:33] himself that he is the same yesterday
[44:36] today and forever
[44:38] how reminds you Jesus took time in there
[44:44] especially in the book of of John where
[44:49] he would speak on the coming of the
[44:52] comforter on the Spirit of Truth and he
[44:55] would declare to them that you have joy
[45:00] now but soon you will have sorrow but he
[45:05] said your sorrow is going to be turned
[45:09] unto joy and he let them know they were
[45:13] not aware of what he was talking about
[45:15] but he let him know that once your
[45:18] sorrow has been turned to joy and he
[45:20] ties it into that of a woman that is in
[45:24] travail that when she has in travail
[45:28] orders of great sorrow and pain is
[45:31] taking place but once that which she has
[45:35] held within now has been delivered or
[45:39] brought forth or made manifest then the
[45:42] sorrow is turned to joy that a man child
[45:46] is born into the world he was speaking
[45:49] of when his life now recognize this he
[45:54] was speaking of when his life that has
[45:57] as Eve herself remembers she didn't have
[46:00] her own name but when she is taken out
[46:03] of Adam as Adam was put to sleep God put
[46:07] Christ to sleep open up the side and
[46:10] took out the elements that would go to
[46:13] make up the bride of Jesus Christ it is
[46:16] not something outside of
[46:18] word but it must come from him and he
[46:23] knowing that by his word that you and I
[46:27] as a believer here this morning as one
[46:31] that you may not even be a believer but
[46:34] there is a tug or a pull upon your heart
[46:38] and me just say it like this but the
[46:40] random would go on to say he said you
[46:43] ought to be a happy person that God
[46:46] would even lead you and you would even
[46:48] want to come and hear the word of the
[46:50] Lord
[46:51] he said keep following him and he leads
[46:55] you to the fountain of eternal life
[46:58] don't stop just because you hear the
[47:01] word the word is only to point out to
[47:04] you there is a fountain that is open in
[47:08] the house of David that can take the
[47:10] unclean and make them clean so how that
[47:14] God would would so work in a life to
[47:17] where it would be his own life coming
[47:19] back to that part of husband and wife it
[47:22] would be God's own life that would come
[47:26] into the believer there on the day of
[47:29] Pentecost and remember they would not be
[47:32] reflecting a church a church as a woman
[47:34] they will not be reflecting a church
[47:37] because to reflect a woman is to reflect
[47:39] fallen condition is to reflect deception
[47:43] but remember they were to receive that
[47:46] of the man Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost
[47:49] which Peter said the hidden man of the
[47:52] heart they were to receive a headship of
[47:56] that of a life that would come to them
[47:58] showing that the Dominion of the world
[48:02] had been broke from over their life and
[48:05] so what our happiness that we ought to
[48:08] have remember they were sad when they
[48:12] were walking in Luke 24 as you read of
[48:16] the events leading up to the
[48:19] resurrection even when he was taken like
[48:23] the lamb was taken and inspected prior
[48:26] to the Passover they did not know what
[48:28] was taking place but the scripture was
[48:30] being fulfilled
[48:31] from the book of zechariah smite the
[48:34] Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered
[48:35] but it did not say the wolves would be
[48:39] scattered
[48:39] they were always sheep the sheep were
[48:42] scattered it would take the Shepherd to
[48:44] come and bring the sheep back together
[48:46] and that's what he did after his
[48:49] resurrection the sheet sent word
[48:52] together the sheet together there's only
[48:55] one way that the sheep are brought
[48:57] together and that's by his word for he
[49:00] said my sheep know me and I am known of
[49:03] them his voice in his word we know his
[49:07] voice and that is his word this is why
[49:10] when the Spirit of God in no matter
[49:13] where it's at in a life but how God
[49:16] would even begin to deal with a heart
[49:18] you ought to be happy that God has even
[49:22] spoke to your heart let me just say it
[49:26] to you like this this morning you might
[49:28] look in your life and say I've got so
[49:30] many different things in my life brother
[49:32] Samuel I really need I really need your
[49:34] real sanctification I really need the
[49:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:39] let me just tell you something take off
[49:40] that sadness and be happy because God
[49:44] has already dealt and began dealing with
[49:47] your life what should I do
[49:48] be happy in the Lord and look to God to
[49:52] lead you to what the desire is in your
[49:55] life to a fulfilling of that they were
[49:58] sad let me just say it to you when you
[50:00] are sad oh man think about how the
[50:03] prophets said we were made to be happy
[50:06] we were not made to walk around worried
[50:09] worried is not something of the Spirit
[50:12] of God worry is a spirit of permit we
[50:16] were not made to be worried we were not
[50:19] made to live sad that is not how God
[50:22] made us to live that is not humility
[50:25] that is distrust in Jehovah
[50:29] and when the enemy can get us in a place
[50:32] where we're discouraged like he got them
[50:34] as they were walking on in on the road
[50:38] to him he made us remember he starts
[50:41] porn and on when the enemy can get you
[50:44] discouraged but RAM said that's when he
[50:45] wants to pour it on they started what
[50:48] did they start doing
[50:49] they started acting like people whose
[50:51] very life line had been taken out you
[50:54] see what it was depression was moving in
[50:56] a poem where Peter said what are we
[50:59] gonna do let's go fishin they didn't
[51:01] know what in the world to do they just
[51:02] went on back to their lives they went
[51:05] back to try to relieve themselves they
[51:07] their expectations that they had that
[51:10] they had thought we thought he should
[51:13] have been the one to redeem Israel and
[51:15] he is the Redeemer but what happened is
[51:17] their thoughts about things was not
[51:20] lining up with the thoughts of God but
[51:22] God in His mercy because they were a
[51:26] part of that thought then God in His
[51:28] mercy he came and he sought them out a
[51:31] man it was Mary Magdalene at the tomb
[51:35] that morning let me just tell you
[51:37] something here for a moment the first
[51:39] ones that saw Jesus when he rose was
[51:42] women come on somebody
[51:46] he was Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
[51:48] then there were other women that were
[51:50] there with him now are you with me now
[51:52] and you're recognized here they were and
[51:55] here when Mary you know she didn't she
[51:58] did this is a gardener that's what she's
[52:00] supposed him to be but when he spoke her
[52:03] name she recognized who it was she knew
[52:08] because when he called her name it moved
[52:11] it did something it released it brought
[52:14] the reality of who it is that's talking
[52:17] to her don't you realize this hid her
[52:19] eyes was withholding from knowing him
[52:22] standing there but as soon as he spoke
[52:25] she recognized this is not a gardener
[52:28] this is rabona my master my lord why he
[52:33] called her name
[52:36] hello glory be to God in the highest
[52:39] they were sad and walking around with
[52:43] sadness and Jesus even steps out there
[52:46] in Luke 24 they didn't recognize him but
[52:50] he began to step out and he begins to
[52:52] walk with them and they had they are sad
[52:54] in their communications but notice he
[52:58] had told them that their sorrow would be
[53:02] turned to joy and when their sorrow
[53:06] would be turned to joy remember what he
[53:09] told him you'll have a joy that no man
[53:12] will be able to take from you it's a joy
[53:16] that no matter what circumstances arise
[53:18] no man will be able to take this joy
[53:22] from you I'm telling you this as an
[53:26] everlasting eternal joy within a heart
[53:30] as a believer we can go through all
[53:33] sorts of things and things sometimes you
[53:36] seem like you're praying for and it
[53:38] seems like everything is happening
[53:40] contrary but there's a joy in our heart
[53:43] because the joy of the Lord is our
[53:45] strength we know in whom we have
[53:47] believed I said happy is the man who's
[53:51] helped whose help is the God of Jacob
[53:55] happy is that man when they came out of
[53:59] the tomb remember Jesus met him he met
[54:03] him when they begin when they were told
[54:05] go tell my disciples and Jesus appears
[54:09] before the women and he says all hell
[54:12] those two words oh hell that word is a
[54:15] salutation of great cheerfulness
[54:19] it's a salutation of great joy
[54:24] hallelujah I mean you say it like this
[54:27] he's a present God happy is is he the
[54:33] scripture opens to us even in Acts
[54:37] chapter 1 and it expresses like this it
[54:40] says all Theophilus in sense of all that
[54:45] Jesus began no
[54:47] how it opens the book of Acts is not the
[54:51] Acts of the Apostles is the acts of the
[54:54] Holy Ghost in and through the Apostles
[54:57] because it was not men acting upon their
[55:00] own account this was God that same Jesus
[55:04] now reflected in the body of his bride
[55:10] that which he began to do and teach you
[55:15] see his death brother ran will pick it
[55:17] up like this in the token he said his
[55:19] death did not stop him
[55:22] he was only the beginning you see all of
[55:26] that lights and shadows that was laid
[55:29] within the Old Testament but it all was
[55:32] pointing through that of a real Liberty
[55:36] of a freedom of a working of the Spirit
[55:39] of Christ because remember you and I
[55:41] were not here in a rightful condition
[55:46] that's right and this is why there had
[55:50] to come the crucifixion thank God for
[55:53] Calvary but it didn't stop there
[55:57] it put him in the tomb but it didn't
[56:00] stop there he went down and into hell
[56:03] and he laid every one of the sin upon
[56:08] the devil you know the Bible said I
[56:09] believe it's in Romans five he was
[56:12] delivered for our offenses I'm telling
[56:16] you it don't matter if it's something
[56:18] past present future he gathered up the
[56:21] sin of the world you know what he paid
[56:24] the price for every sin he saddled the
[56:28] question of sin death he deposited the
[56:31] Lord and he rose up on that Easter
[56:34] morning but it didn't stop where it kept
[56:37] on going because if it stops there then
[56:40] we are still in sin we are still in
[56:42] bondage but because he rose he came with
[56:46] a message to you and I because I live
[56:49] you shall live also he gathered them
[56:53] there and he spoke to them he revealed
[56:56] himself through the
[56:58] stretchers and he told them as he
[57:01] breathed on them
[57:03] he said I've sinned the promise of the
[57:06] Father upon you you shall be endued with
[57:10] the Holy Ghost
[57:12] this is his promise what that he would
[57:16] be the Living God the present God
[57:18] working among his people this is why
[57:24] Hebrews 13:8 is not just a scripture no
[57:31] scripture is just a scripture all
[57:33] Scripture is given by inspiration from
[57:36] God but Jesus Christ is the same
[57:40] yesterday today and forever he's the
[57:46] same
[57:47] he has never changed I'm God and I
[57:49] changed or not man has changed but God
[57:53] has never changed he revealed himself to
[57:57] John when John was there on the Isle of
[58:00] Patmos he would reveal himself to John
[58:02] and let John know in verse 17 fear not I
[58:06] am the first and the last I am he that
[58:10] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[58:14] Alive for evermore and have the keys of
[58:17] hell and death
[58:18] I want you understand this he he himself
[58:22] he went and he paid the price
[58:25] you see here he was he died he here he
[58:29] was but now the Spirit of Christ the
[58:32] Spirit of God in Romans 11 says if that
[58:36] spirit that raised up Christ from the
[58:38] dead dwell in you it shall also quicken
[58:41] your mortal body
[58:42] why because to show that these seeds
[58:46] must be raised to life that you and I
[58:50] were dead in sin and trespasses there
[58:54] was no way for you and I to get out of
[58:56] it Oh God
[58:59] had given little glimpses where the Holy
[59:01] Spirit would move through revelation you
[59:04] know it would move upon the prophets of
[59:06] old it would move down upon their and
[59:09] through the elect
[59:10] now they were offering the lamb but now
[59:12] there was coming a promise of one that
[59:15] he would come and he would dwell with us
[59:18] even in us because the scripture
[59:22] declares he that is the Lamb of God the
[59:26] identification of the Promised One
[59:29] is he on whom the Spirit comes and abide
[59:33] and that's exactly the same way it is
[59:36] for every son and daughter of God
[59:39] brother the spirit don't come and leave
[59:42] the Spirit comes and abides it takes its
[59:46] abode in its temple that it has cleaned
[59:49] up that it has called for its glory and
[59:52] it's SATs down here badge on the inside
[59:55] oh my you cannot separate God from his
[59:59] people
[1:00:00] amen when the Holy Ghost has come it is
[1:00:03] a seal of the Living God I said yes he
[1:00:08] that has the God of Jacob for his help
[1:00:13] been everything that you got need of you
[1:00:16] have the overcoming power within you
[1:00:20] this is why we should be the happiest
[1:00:24] people in the world
[1:00:27] then they reminds you happiness does not
[1:00:30] consist of what goods of the world you
[1:00:33] own go ahead save and do everything you
[1:00:38] can to get certain goods
[1:00:39] it'll be out on the street in a few
[1:00:41] years if not a few months by the shirt
[1:00:44] by the dress by whatever it is and you
[1:00:46] save and save eventually the threads
[1:00:48] will wear bare your taste for it will
[1:00:50] fade what is it because it's just a
[1:00:53] material it's just things of this earth
[1:00:55] my brother there is one thing that does
[1:00:58] not fade and that's the joy of the Lord
[1:01:01] oh I wish I had some witnesses right now
[1:01:05] a man of where through many dangers
[1:01:09] toils and snares I have already come his
[1:01:12] Grace had brought me safe thus far it'll
[1:01:15] safely take me on home
[1:01:17] oh let me tell you something that's real
[1:01:19] children of God oh my
[1:01:22] the road is not easy oh is it easy from
[1:01:25] the inside is it easy to live a
[1:01:27] Christian life it is because it's his
[1:01:29] life on the inside but the road the path
[1:01:32] is not an easy path it's not an easy
[1:01:34] road our position the matter of fact
[1:01:37] every force of darkness is against us
[1:01:40] but oh what a promise in reality we have
[1:01:43] that if God be for us who can be against
[1:01:46] us greater is He that is in us than he
[1:01:49] that's in the world I said happy is he
[1:01:52] that hath the God of Jacob
[1:01:54] for his help this is why we are to be
[1:01:57] the happiest people that's living in
[1:01:59] this day Christians trelles especially
[1:02:02] in this hour as they believer to realize
[1:02:05] our Redemption draweth nigh
[1:02:07] we recognize that more and more the
[1:02:10] signs and those things that we see
[1:02:12] happening all around old brother it is a
[1:02:15] happy time for us because this world is
[1:02:19] not our home this is we're just Pilgrims
[1:02:21] and strangers I'm as much a pilgrim or a
[1:02:24] stranger here as I would be when I went
[1:02:27] to the Philippines I'm not a citizen
[1:02:29] there I don't belong there I just went
[1:02:32] there for a visit and the reality of it
[1:02:34] is though this body right here might be
[1:02:36] an American but I've got a different
[1:02:39] citizenship on the inside I've been born
[1:02:42] of the Spirit of God oh my brother when
[1:02:45] the word came my way I believed and got
[1:02:47] the passport and then after I got the
[1:02:50] passport he said go on up there and
[1:02:53] receive the visa on your passport that
[1:02:56] will guarantee your entry you know that
[1:02:58] visa says that visa says I've got all
[1:03:02] the necessary inoculation all that I
[1:03:05] need to give hair brother he injects his
[1:03:08] life back into us we are Pilgrims and
[1:03:12] strangers happy is he that hath the God
[1:03:17] of Jacob for his help
[1:03:20] I'm he even liveth and was dead and
[1:03:23] behold I am Alive for evermore I've got
[1:03:25] the keys of hell and of death this is
[1:03:30] why blue Rann would tell us like this
[1:03:33] don't you look you said for anything
[1:03:35] greater you can't have no greater than
[1:03:38] the Holy Spirit you got it right now you
[1:03:42] see this is the problem many don't have
[1:03:44] it this is why they run to and fro
[1:03:47] there'll be a famine a famine in the
[1:03:51] last days come on
[1:03:54] for what hearing the word of God where
[1:03:58] will the famine be the famine is in the
[1:04:01] hearing a person can hear it
[1:04:04] it could be preached right over them but
[1:04:06] unless the hearing he that hath an ear
[1:04:09] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[1:04:11] the church oh brother you see what a
[1:04:13] blessed reality when the Holy Ghost has
[1:04:16] come he reveals the truth places you in
[1:04:20] the truth and becomes the truth leading
[1:04:23] you on the inside oh man this is why
[1:04:27] there's a famine there is no lack with
[1:04:33] the Lord I'm telling you right now
[1:04:36] you can take the very words jesus wept
[1:04:39] if the Holy Ghost gave that to be
[1:04:41] preached this morning the Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] will take that word this morning and
[1:04:45] he'll whip every devil he'll meet every
[1:04:48] need he'll circumcise every heart he'll
[1:04:51] cast out every devil you want to know
[1:04:53] why because he's making it known and
[1:04:55] real that it's the same God come down
[1:04:58] and become one of us
[1:05:00] and took our sin upon himself and paid
[1:05:03] that price and release back the Holy
[1:05:06] Ghost Satan cannot stand in the presence
[1:05:12] of the revealed word when the angel of
[1:05:14] the Lord is passing to deliver that word
[1:05:17] let me just tell you right now there's
[1:05:20] the angel of the Lord that accompanies
[1:05:22] my ministry there's the angel of the
[1:05:24] Lord that I cut every ministry every one
[1:05:27] this pawn of the Spirit of God come on
[1:05:29] now the message investments brother

[1:05:34] stood there that day remember what the
[1:05:36] people's charge was there in Joshua it

[1:05:42] Moses let him comfort
[1:05:44] himself with you as well and we will
[1:05:46] follow why because the people of God are
[1:05:49] not following me they are following
[1:05:52] saith the Lord
[1:05:53] the teller of fire the Spirit of Truth
[1:05:56] that's how God leads his people by his
[1:05:59] word is that right oh yeah don't let
[1:06:04] that shake you the same God who gave the

[1:06:39] he's here with us to bring us into my
[1:06:42] father's house are many mansions don't
[1:06:47] look for anything greater you can't have
[1:06:50] no greater than the Holy Spirit is that
[1:06:53] right when Jesus remember what he said
[1:06:56] he said greater works than these shall
[1:06:58] you do not more not not not not ones
[1:07:03] that would be bigger or greater it means
[1:07:06] more of the same but where the profit
[1:07:09] would take that up greater than this he
[1:07:11] said what it would be
[1:07:12] he said his mouth the declaration would
[1:07:15] be preached the Holy Ghost is come and
[1:07:19] that is the greater works amen to preach
[1:07:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is
[1:07:27] the resurrection of Jesus Christ it is
[1:07:30] an Easter coming personally to you and
[1:07:34] in you and living through you ho glory
[1:07:39] this is why the scripture this is why
[1:07:42] when it come to Gideon Gideon said if
[1:07:46] God be with us
[1:07:48] we'll be all his miracles where is the
[1:07:55] god of power come on now where is the
[1:08:00] god of power where is this where is that
[1:08:02] same nature you know Israel the Spirit
[1:08:06] of God will begin to move upon Israel
[1:08:08] the Bible records it in Isaiah 52 and
[1:08:11] Isaiah 53 that it'll become a longing in
[1:08:14] the hearts of Israel that for all God Oh
[1:08:17] for the arm of that power and thy
[1:08:19] strength as that has opened the Red Sea
[1:08:21] they will begin to call for the same
[1:08:23] power of the same God to come and
[1:08:26] manifest himself you know why because
[1:08:29] when there is a desire within the heart
[1:08:32] for God to come God is going to move
[1:08:35] upon that life there's a message of the
[1:08:39] real baptism of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:08:41] to go to Israel after the rapture of the
[1:08:45] Gentile bride and they will come to know
[1:08:47] his power he is just the same oh yeah
[1:08:52] glory be to God because remember when
[1:08:55] Naomi and Ruth came back it was barley
[1:08:57] seasoned barley is resurrection power a
[1:09:00] man when Ruth herself here and Gentile
[1:09:04] bride the Gentile bride comes in
[1:09:06] resurrection power is a right and Naomi
[1:09:09] herself coming back comes into
[1:09:11] resurrection power war glory if God be
[1:09:16] for us we're beyond his miracles now
[1:09:20] let's look here just a few moments let
[1:09:21] me just take just a few moments here and
[1:09:24] just preach how he breaks it in Psalms
[1:09:27] 146 this is what this is what hearing
[1:09:30] notice happy years which made heaven and
[1:09:36] earth the sea and all that therein is I
[1:09:41] want you to notice this is the only word
[1:09:46] which may that goes back to past tense
[1:09:51] let me preach a little bit now you see
[1:09:55] in the midst of Everest chapter every
[1:09:57] verse if every verse does not reveal
[1:10:00] Jesus Christ to be the same then
[1:10:04] something's wrong with that revelation
[1:10:06] not the verse happy is remember he
[1:10:09] reveals himself in the book of
[1:10:10] revelations he which was which is and
[1:10:13] which is to come amen he is the Lord God
[1:10:17] Almighty notice how it's revealed which
[1:10:21] may he which made heavens and earth and
[1:10:25] sea and which all are all very early
[1:10:28] this is what the Lord God did notice the
[1:10:32] consideration this same God that would
[1:10:36] be on my side this same God that I can
[1:10:40] say I am happy because he is my help
[1:10:44] he is my expectation because what he is
[1:10:48] the one when there was nothing
[1:10:52] God did not start taking atoms and
[1:10:55] molecules and generate something there
[1:10:58] was no atom or molecules nothing it was
[1:11:03] nothing but a know him before the Angels
[1:11:06] but notice in his mind he already had
[1:11:10] the plan laid out and notice he spoke
[1:11:14] notice he spoke and when he spoke then
[1:11:17] what happened the word began to come
[1:11:20] into expression that begin to come and
[1:11:23] begin the four things begin to come into
[1:11:26] their place what by His Word and the
[1:11:29] earth itself became a watered garden of
[1:11:32] eden and was transformed from a darkness
[1:11:35] of chaos and voidness into a beautiful
[1:11:38] water garden of eden because it obeyed
[1:11:42] the word of the lord and it came and it
[1:11:45] moved around the sun think about it
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:49] which made heaven and earth see and all
[1:11:51] there in the Lamb's Book of Life was
[1:11:55] already wrote in his mind come on now
[1:11:59] revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain
[1:12:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:05] Isaiah 53 it speaks past tense because
[1:12:08] why it's already a finished work in the
[1:12:11] mind of God it was just to be made
[1:12:13] manifest it's letting us know that where
[1:12:17] our happiness is derived from is because
[1:12:20] we know where we have come from and
[1:12:23] where we are going we know who is over
[1:12:26] it all God is over let me just say like
[1:12:30] this the same deity of God the same one
[1:12:33] where the scripture said all things were
[1:12:35] made by him in John 1:3 it goes on to
[1:12:38] say he created all things by Jesus
[1:12:40] Christ what is that his word it's his
[1:12:44] word that brings creation her brother it
[1:12:49] takes more than just reading the word it
[1:12:51] takes him who is the word to step into
[1:12:54] that word and bring that word to life
[1:12:58] hey man to where it moves from where
[1:13:02] it's not the deity in heaven but the
[1:13:04] deity that was in heaven
[1:13:06] is now inside of you and me is to make
[1:13:10] us aware of the same God that was there
[1:13:13] and that same God is dwelling here oh I
[1:13:18] think how what brother Ram said he said
[1:13:20] to think he said that he said of a
[1:13:22] born-again Christian he said you take a
[1:13:24] man who's the center that's never known
[1:13:27] what it is to really you know have his
[1:13:30] sin deck clean and his heart filled with
[1:13:32] God he said he cannot even imagine how
[1:13:35] the mighty God who I love this language
[1:13:37] he said how the mighty God would desire
[1:13:40] to come down and be reconciled and
[1:13:42] become buddies buddies with that man I'm
[1:13:46] telling you God wants to be your buddy
[1:13:49] God wants to be your friend God wants to
[1:13:52] be your helper your buddy
[1:13:54] one who sticks closer to you
[1:13:57] then a brother oh it means something to
[1:14:01] me grow repeat of God Oh to think of it
[1:14:05] he keepeth truth forever God keepeth his
[1:14:09] word he's watched over his word he's
[1:14:12] kept his word even even what God has
[1:14:15] promised remember
[1:14:17] he keeps truth his word is truth but
[1:14:20] remember the word is a person jesus said
[1:14:22] I am the way the truth and the life
[1:14:26] so the keeping of truth is God coming to
[1:14:29] fulfill his word now here in the
[1:14:33] scripture let me just pause here just
[1:14:34] for a moment in the script circles we're
[1:14:37] looking at this happy is because we
[1:14:40] realized that for many Easter itself
[1:14:43] would be no more than just Easter lilies
[1:14:46] that's all that is
[1:14:48] for many it's no more than just a hat or
[1:14:50] a dress and yet if we bring it on down
[1:14:53] to there may be there's many vetted that
[1:14:55] could even have teary eyes when they
[1:14:57] would think of Calvary thank God for
[1:14:59] that if it's really from the heart but
[1:15:01] to recognize the Calvary was to pay the
[1:15:04] debt in other words to make you
[1:15:06] acquitted of the charges that were
[1:15:08] against you that you would have a right
[1:15:10] to believe now listen to me now this is
[1:15:13] why he was raised for our justification
[1:15:14] a person that is called by the Spirit of
[1:15:18] God in justification the same devil the
[1:15:21] same spirit the one that made him live
[1:15:24] filthy when they were in the world
[1:15:25] when they can just respond to the call
[1:15:28] that there is an acquittal of all
[1:15:30] charges and they can rise and believe
[1:15:33] that though they can say Lord forgive me
[1:15:35] of my sins lord how repent Lord Jesus I
[1:15:39] need you as my Lord and Savior they can
[1:15:41] still have all the habits all the world
[1:15:43] the same one that made them do it out
[1:15:45] there is still living right there inside
[1:15:48] of their life what needs to happen they
[1:15:50] need to go deeper to where now the work
[1:15:53] of the acquittal the work of the blood
[1:15:56] being applied how do you apply the blood
[1:15:58] you apply the blood by obedience you
[1:16:01] take the simplicity of the word and you
[1:16:04] obey it when the scripture said repent
[1:16:06] God can't repent you've got to repent
[1:16:08] the
[1:16:09] says you'd be baptized in the name of
[1:16:11] Jesus Christ God can't be baptized
[1:16:13] you've got to do that you've got the two
[1:16:16] parts that you have to do in obedience
[1:16:18] to God's Word and God said I'll do
[1:16:21] something that you can't do and there's
[1:16:23] no man can do it
[1:16:24] no Church can do it and that is I will
[1:16:26] give you the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[1:16:29] can't earn it you can't merit it it's
[1:16:32] got your name on it
[1:16:33] it's been under the tree of Calvary with
[1:16:36] your name on it
[1:16:37] he'll my it was all wrapped up just for
[1:16:39] you to be delivered in this hour now let
[1:16:46] just tell like this anybody that really
[1:16:48] wants to be free they can be free and
[1:16:50] you have my permission to call anybody
[1:16:53] who says I really wanted to be free but
[1:16:55] you know what God never set me free
[1:16:56] you've got my permission according to
[1:16:58] the Word of God to call him a liar
[1:17:00] because they did not want to be free if
[1:17:03] you ever want to be free you are already
[1:17:06] free he has already paid for every
[1:17:10] offense right now he has already have
[1:17:14] been raised for our justification a full
[1:17:17] acquittal where you and I can believe on
[1:17:20] him well glory be to God you see it just
[1:17:27] depends on how much and do you really
[1:17:29] want it notice the scripture goes on in
[1:17:32] in here in 90 Bruce chapter 9 when we
[1:17:36] begin to talk about this life now
[1:17:38] remember there is a covenant that God
[1:17:40] has made there's no way remember the
[1:17:42] covenants that God would make with man
[1:17:45] when God made it to where man had to
[1:17:47] keep a certain part man couldn't keep it
[1:17:49] man always failed for him going from the
[1:17:51] very beginning in the first dispensation
[1:17:53] of innocence man fell from that covenant
[1:17:55] but then men see how that God was
[1:17:58] setting in an example of the
[1:18:00] unconditional covenant there with
[1:18:02] Abraham to where it was not based upon
[1:18:04] Abraham's merits it was not based upon
[1:18:07] Abraham's work was not based upon his
[1:18:09] status or who he was
[1:18:11] it was the unmerited grace of God the
[1:18:14] sovereignty of God's election and we
[1:18:18] find that within this covenant that God
[1:18:20] is not asking if
[1:18:22] you will I will but I have already is
[1:18:25] that right
[1:18:26] then we find of how that from out of
[1:18:28] that unconditional coming it you have
[1:18:30] found that later on I believe it's alms
[1:18:32] eighty nine where we begin to rerun
[1:18:35] folded to us of the sure mercies of
[1:18:37] David of how that God has dealt with
[1:18:39] David and how that there is to be that
[1:18:42] of the temple man of a tabernacle one
[1:18:45] that will actually be raised up but he's
[1:18:48] speaking prophetically much all the way
[1:18:50] through Psalms eighty-nine it is the
[1:18:53] sure mercies of David which was the
[1:18:55] fulfillment in the life of the Lord
[1:18:58] Jesus Christ it's being fulfilled in the
[1:19:00] lives of the believers by the same Holy
[1:19:03] Spirit the same God who gave it
[1:19:05] it will be fulfilled in through the
[1:19:07] lives of the 144,000 and it will all
[1:19:10] come to pass there even the wedding
[1:19:12] supper there in the Millennium there in
[1:19:14] the future home but sure mercies of
[1:19:16] David are continually being unfolded
[1:19:18] when God makes a covenant even when you
[1:19:21] read there at some point in time there
[1:19:23] can be all kinds of falling short in
[1:19:25] within that covenant but remember God's
[1:19:27] God's Word is not anchored to flesh
[1:19:31] God's Word is who the ears it is
[1:19:34] anchored to him who cannot lie it's
[1:19:37] anchored to him who cannot repent he's
[1:19:40] not man that he should repent or lie he
[1:19:43] is one who has made his word and his
[1:19:46] word is sure Oh glory be to God notice
[1:19:50] here it speaks of how how much more
[1:19:53] verse fourteen Hebrews nine how much
[1:19:55] more shall the blood of Christ who
[1:19:57] through the Eternal Spirit offered
[1:19:59] himself without spot to God purge your
[1:20:04] conscience there's got to be a purging
[1:20:08] of the conscience the soul from dead
[1:20:12] works to serve the Living God let me
[1:20:16] just skip this just for time to move
[1:20:17] down through here Paul would go on to
[1:20:20] bring this forth that in order just as
[1:20:23] the first covenant as the first
[1:20:25] Testament as that which was given at
[1:20:27] first it was given and dedicated or
[1:20:30] inaugurated brought forth with blood so
[1:20:32] would this
[1:20:34] estimate in order for this Testament to
[1:20:36] come forth remember jesus said this is
[1:20:39] the New Testament in my blood remember
[1:20:42] in order for this Testament to come into
[1:20:44] force whatever a testator has said like
[1:20:47] if you were to go to make out a will and
[1:20:50] you know my son can have this my
[1:20:51] daughter can have this and this and this
[1:20:53] and this that will is for when you are
[1:20:55] deceased when you die or you pass then
[1:20:58] what is wrote in that will those who are
[1:21:01] wrote in there can actually come when it
[1:21:03] is made known to them or somehow they
[1:21:06] have an inclination daddy left me
[1:21:08] address her daddy left me a bedroom said
[1:21:09] mama left me this this set whatever it
[1:21:12] is that has been wrote in there and
[1:21:14] designated you can actually go and make
[1:21:16] a claim upon and this is exactly where
[1:21:20] had the Lord Jesus himself when he
[1:21:22] calmed brother he did not come with
[1:21:24] another along another another list of
[1:21:27] Commandments he did not come with
[1:21:28] another law he came to fulfill that word
[1:21:32] he came to represent this is what Phasis
[1:21:35] is what the first Adam was when he
[1:21:38] walked with God one who could hear lip
[1:21:40] two-year he came to represent and
[1:21:43] identify this is what every son and
[1:21:46] daughter of God is to be and will be his
[1:21:51] life was a witness that there are gonna
[1:21:54] come more just like me glory be to God
[1:21:58] amen there will be more sons and
[1:22:01] daughters of God for that is why he came
[1:22:04] to this earth he came to redeem that
[1:22:07] which belong to him he came to bring it
[1:22:11] out of the pawnshop brother he sent back
[1:22:15] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the
[1:22:17] receipt that lets it be known his
[1:22:21] presence coming right in to your living
[1:22:23] room right now it lets it be known that
[1:22:25] every promise that is made whatever your
[1:22:29] need is whatever it promised that he's
[1:22:31] made he is present to fulfill that word
[1:22:35] Oh glory this is why
[1:22:42] we serve God with living signs because
[1:22:49] the Bloods been applied and the life is
[1:22:52] within the blood a man is not a dead God
[1:22:56] went well he used to do that he's the
[1:23:02] same yesterday today and forever as he
[1:23:09] raised up that body on the Easter
[1:23:12] morning here to take nothing less than
[1:23:15] the same power of the Holy Ghost by the
[1:23:18] same vindicated word to raise a body in
[1:23:22] rapture cuz he said I am Alpha and Omega
[1:23:32] he ain't diminished in power and listen
[1:23:37] it can't be power without word that come
[1:23:40] together I said they come together is
[1:23:45] that right well notice this serving the
[1:23:49] Living God serving him his living
[1:23:52] presence right among us
[1:23:54] it's his living presence he does the
[1:23:57] same he does the same that he did before
[1:24:03] this is where the scripture would say in
[1:24:05] mark 16 the Lord was with them they went
[1:24:10] preaching the gospel and the Lord was
[1:24:12] with them confirming the word with signs
[1:24:14] and wonders following is that right
[1:24:18] that's what Jesus said the works that I
[1:24:21] do shall you do also verse sentir look
[1:24:25] at this in in sums 146 verse 7 look

[1:25:07] things are packed full you could spend a
[1:25:09] month of Sundays on this here which
[1:25:12] executed judgment for the oppressed let
[1:25:15] me tell you what oppression is it's a
[1:25:17] devil oppression is one who is under the
[1:25:22] control of another and they can't get
[1:25:26] free but he comes who who does happy is
[1:25:31] he that hath the God of Jacob for his
[1:25:33] help the same one that looses Jacob the
[1:25:38] Bible said in the Book of Jeremiah a
[1:25:40] stronger one than he had gathered him
[1:25:44] back home
[1:25:46] loosen it whoo-hoo executed gentlemen
[1:25:49] you know a sickness is an oppression
[1:25:52] come on somebody

[1:25:57] feeling it's a devil
[1:25:58] it's a tormentor a sickness a disease
[1:26:02] I'm talking about a condition of a soul
[1:26:06] a man like you take a 1 lakh who was by
[1:26:09] the name we know him as Legion we don't
[1:26:11] know what his name is but the man was a
[1:26:13] very good man but it all started one
[1:26:16] time like he just took one little drink
[1:26:18] hit one little thing started it he took
[1:26:21] one little look he started with one
[1:26:22] little thing that he thought I can
[1:26:24] control it I'll be all right and what
[1:26:27] did it do it overtook his life -
[1:26:30] eventually or even come in at times
[1:26:32] oh he had a sweetness sometimes about
[1:26:34] him he would be around his family but
[1:26:37] then all of a sudden there'd be a time
[1:26:38] them Devils would come back and drive
[1:26:41] him right back out into the tombs
[1:26:42] I'm telling you brother it was a devil I
[1:26:45] think many times what we're calling
[1:26:47] personalities on people is nothing but
[1:26:50] Devils
[1:26:50] it is not personalities it is absolutely
[1:26:53] demons of oppression that would want to
[1:26:57] bind the children of God but I've got
[1:26:59] news for the devil this morning
[1:27:01] there is one that is with me in me and
[1:27:04] anointing this word that execute
[1:27:07] judgment on the oppressed that
[1:27:10] absolutely can take that word and Pierce
[1:27:13] the devil's hide with it I tell you this
[1:27:19] morning in the name of the Lord
[1:27:21] quit being the devil's playground if
[1:27:24] you're being oppressed this morning
[1:27:26] there's one is greater ball we can
[1:27:32] preach on that but let's just moon we
[1:27:35] just want this one just go as he just
[1:27:37] directed this is what he also does he
[1:27:41] give a food to the hungry
[1:27:47] hallelujah David said he's satisfied for
[1:27:50] long and soul he fell at the hungry soul
[1:27:52] with goodness
[1:27:55] you know God made a man to thirst but he
[1:28:00] made they put that thirst within him and
[1:28:02] the only way that first ever be
[1:28:04] satisfied is by the one who put it in a
[1:28:09] lot of things the devil can try to give
[1:28:12] and fill it with different things this
[1:28:13] is why you have things people change
[1:28:15] from this to this and do that and to
[1:28:18] this and to that and to that look this
[1:28:19] is why you find even among the athletes
[1:28:21] in the sports and people who are famous
[1:28:24] look at they got all the money in the
[1:28:26] war and see if they got so much money
[1:28:28] they could bottle it up like Kleenexes
[1:28:29] and blow their nose on it and throw it
[1:28:31] away they got someone they got so much
[1:28:33] money but look what it's done many times
[1:28:35] you order you see their lives their
[1:28:36] lives are nothing but dope addicts and
[1:28:38] drunkards and prostitutes and
[1:28:40] whoremongers and adulterers and
[1:28:42] everything else why because they have
[1:28:44] not found the one who can satisfy that
[1:28:48] first I'm telling you you can look all
[1:28:50] the way through life you can look up and
[1:28:53] down and say when I get this I've got it
[1:28:55] alright I get this I've got it let me
[1:28:57] just tell you right now
[1:28:59] they are nothing but empty promises from
[1:29:01] hell they are not full of life
[1:29:04] whatsoever they leave your only wanting
[1:29:07] something else but if you ever meet God
[1:29:09] in the power of his resurrection
[1:29:11] according to his word blessed are they
[1:29:14] that do hunger and thirst after
[1:29:16] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:29:19] rather the world is gone there is no
[1:29:22] more love for the world there's no more
[1:29:24] case or desire for the world he is your
[1:29:28] all-in-all the salmon do stir get hungry
[1:29:36] yeah but not for anything the appetites
[1:29:38] been changed

[1:29:49] the sin is bread but for a season
[1:29:52] pleasure for a season come on now that's
[1:29:57] how Satan wanted to sell that bill to
[1:30:00] Eve in the beginning he came and begin
[1:30:02] to talk to her about the tree he put his
[1:30:04] hand begin to touch her her hand she
[1:30:06] begin to have emotions move through her
[1:30:08] body well how I feel like I've never
[1:30:10] felt before he's making me feel so
[1:30:12] special no it's not he's drawing you out
[1:30:14] into a trap that's exactly what he's
[1:30:17] doing
[1:30:17] it was moving into such a way till it
[1:30:20] even moved in her mind what he was
[1:30:21] saying became an imagination between
[1:30:24] them right in her mind so much for them
[1:30:27] said she said Wow wouldn't that be a
[1:30:28] thrill he moved her into that place
[1:30:31] simply by touching her he made it as
[1:30:34] though hold this is one thing that'll be
[1:30:37] so much fun it will just give you so
[1:30:39] much joy what did it do it brought
[1:30:41] through that one yielding to that one
[1:30:44] word it brought every sickness it opened
[1:30:47] up a hole where in that Satan could
[1:30:50] never get in to the to the people of God
[1:30:53] he had opened up a hole to let every
[1:30:55] germ disease every devil every sin
[1:30:58] sickness everything back in but all my
[1:31:01] there was one who came down and he took
[1:31:04] our place and mother he said with my
[1:31:07] life inside of you I will seal you and
[1:31:10] your shell will be preserved and it will
[1:31:14] lead to a change of the body oh I'm glad
[1:31:17] he giveth food to the hungry aren't you
[1:31:21] I'm glad he gives us our daily bread you
[1:31:26] see every one of these happy is he
[1:31:28] you've got to be a witness of it you got
[1:31:31] to be a witness for you can start
[1:31:32] telling other people come on now the way
[1:31:38] to be a witness of it is to have that
[1:31:41] same life the same God who is the word
[1:31:45] the same Living God living and making
[1:31:48] himself known to be the same living
[1:31:51] signs living wonders the Lord loosen
[1:31:54] a--the the prisoners
[1:31:58] it meant amazing isn't this amazing that
[1:32:02] how that Satan would come around and
[1:32:05] promise people he will use agents and he
[1:32:08] will promise people you can be free
[1:32:10] there just over the top you know that
[1:32:12] that stuff I tell you about a prophet
[1:32:15] and you know that stuff about you know
[1:32:17] you can't cut your hair and wearing that
[1:32:19] and those are those are things yes
[1:32:20] that's in God's Word but notice how that
[1:32:23] the enemy will just so put it on my this
[1:32:26] is so over-the-top and look at their
[1:32:28] lives bound their lives are full of sin
[1:32:33] and the Bible says they come bound
[1:32:37] trying to promise you Liberty you can
[1:32:40] never you never adequately disclose
[1:32:43] Liberty unless you're a product of it if
[1:32:46] you're not a product of Liberty you
[1:32:49] don't know what you're talking about in
[1:32:51] Liberty is more than a state of mind
[1:32:53] Liberty is more than just about living
[1:32:56] in the land of the free I'm talking
[1:32:58] about a Liberty where you are set free
[1:33:02] and that reality moves in to your life
[1:33:05] you're no longer a prisoner a prisoner
[1:33:11] is one who does what somebody else wants
[1:33:14] them to do well I can't help it I can't
[1:33:18] get free of this no Christ has already
[1:33:20] made you free will you believe what he's
[1:33:22] done for you are you willing do you hate
[1:33:26] it enough so you wanna dance if a person

[1:33:32] something
[1:33:32] I have it is a devil it's an unclean
[1:33:35] spirit don't try to put quotes on it
[1:33:38] don't try to don't try to doctor it up
[1:33:40] and make it look real good I have it
[1:33:42] here's a devil
[1:33:43] it's a place where a devil can
[1:33:45] congregate but there is to be we're
[1:33:48] gonna let no devil have any place in
[1:33:51] your life there is a greater one that is
[1:33:54] present that lucema 'the prisoners
[1:33:58] how sad it would be if we did not have
[1:34:01] the president living God how sad it
[1:34:03] would be if we did not have a token and
[1:34:06] were admonished to apply it apply it
[1:34:09] think of it
[1:34:11] brother branham uses what I just quoted
[1:34:12] living signs from a living word by
[1:34:14] living presence those words those
[1:34:16] sentences are spoken right after he said
[1:34:19] take this token and apply to your
[1:34:22] families apply it to your homes apply it
[1:34:25] to your loved ones thank God that we've
[1:34:28] got a living reality I remember her
[1:34:35] different ones you know that I went to
[1:34:38] school with here's what they said they
[1:34:40] said you know what Samuel hit that they
[1:34:42] said Sam they call me Sam they said you
[1:34:44] know what they said his daddy and mom
[1:34:46] and they sent him off to a youth camp
[1:34:47] I'll tell you what he got his mind
[1:34:49] changed around now that's what they
[1:34:51] thought because they had seen that guy
[1:34:54] before but what they didn't realize is I
[1:34:57] hadn't got my mind changed but there had
[1:35:00] been a great work of the supernatural
[1:35:02] God it was not a camp that changed me it
[1:35:06] was the same God that came there and met
[1:35:09] Paul on the road to Damascus I met that
[1:35:12] same God I didn't meet a tape or a book
[1:35:15] I met the God who set the message where
[1:35:18] the message said come unto me oh you
[1:35:20] better heavy laden and I will give you
[1:35:23] Savio's for your soul reach me from the
[1:35:27] prison house this is the presence of the
[1:35:33] Living God
[1:35:33] not did it in the past no no he still
[1:35:37] doesn't he Lucinda 'the prisoners
[1:35:46] Oh glory he loosened Peter when Peter
[1:35:50] was in a common prison he loosened Paul
[1:35:55] and Silas when they were in the
[1:35:56] Philippian prison you see there's times
[1:36:01] you can still get into prisons sometimes
[1:36:05] you can get into prisons in your mind
[1:36:07] sometimes you can get into prisons
[1:36:09] prisons which are actually traps come on
[1:36:15] now traps that are not even all together
[1:36:17] with me even sinful it looks so innocent
[1:36:20] but it's a trap it's hindering you from
[1:36:24] walking as a son and daughter of God
[1:36:26] ought to walk it is where victory
[1:36:31] becomes a word of the past and only
[1:36:33] something to look for in the future but
[1:36:35] victory is not past or present
[1:36:38] it's a present tense reality I can do
[1:36:43] all things through Christ who
[1:36:44] strengthens me
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:48] prisons that need to be set free but
[1:36:52] this is the presents God he openeth the
[1:36:55] eyes of the blind he not only came in
[1:36:59] Auckland been naturalized let me do
[1:37:01] something what kind of a God who can do
[1:37:04] that
[1:37:05] the Pharisees could quote the Scriptures
[1:37:10] but when that Living God began to show
[1:37:13] up the same I am that sent Moses and met
[1:37:18] Moses and they claim to be Moses
[1:37:20] disciples but when the I am stood before
[1:37:23] them and here was a man who didn't even
[1:37:26] have even any apples clay was put upon
[1:37:30] his eyes and he was told to go wash in
[1:37:33] the pool of Siloam what happened there
[1:37:36] were eyes bad the creator himself that
[1:37:39] came into there and he now had eyes he
[1:37:44] that did not even have eyeballs now
[1:37:46] there came eyes they didn't even that
[1:37:51] all they said was this is Beelzebub
[1:37:54] you're breaking the Sabbath this is all
[1:37:57] they knew was a letter letter the other
[1:38:01] letter they didn't know the Living God
[1:38:04] of the world but he opened the eyes of
[1:38:08] the blind and let me just tell you
[1:38:10] something
[1:38:11] he not only opened the eyes of those who
[1:38:14] were physically blind there are multiple
[1:38:17] accounts of that in our day he opened up
[1:38:21] the eyes of the blind
[1:38:29] will it be to God but what's more
[1:38:34] important than your physical eyes being
[1:38:35] open is your spiritual eyes to have our
[1:38:41] spiritual eyes open is more important
[1:38:44] than any physical if we had our dreads
[1:38:46] or our Rather's we would rather be I'd
[1:38:49] rather be physically blind than to be
[1:38:52] spiritually blind hey man because
[1:38:55] remember the Pharisees they said we see
[1:38:58] and Jesus said because you said you see
[1:39:01] your sin remains they seen but they
[1:39:06] didn't see as far as to recognize who it
[1:39:09] was and the heart was not given to it
[1:39:11] they tried to kill it they tried to
[1:39:14] eradicate it but brother
[1:39:15] you cannot stop God he openeth the eyes
[1:39:22] of the blind I once was blind but now I
[1:39:25] see
[1:39:28] let me just tell you real personal I
[1:39:31] said in a message Church that he was a
[1:39:36] pastor of a message church which for
[1:39:38] many of you out there some that may be
[1:39:40] listening don't know that and I set four
[1:39:43] years
[1:39:46] then I know it's true I knew it was
[1:39:48] truth did I understand about mom and dad
[1:39:52] did I know what it was what made him
[1:39:53] tick not at all I couldn't understand it
[1:39:56] it was a mystery
[1:39:59] they could tell me about it did you
[1:40:01] believe it's true yeah I believe it's
[1:40:02] truth I've seen a difference between
[1:40:05] others I've seen a difference where you
[1:40:09] see things where word is being
[1:40:11] compromised then you see those things
[1:40:13] but one thing about it I didn't know I
[1:40:15] didn't know I looked at it and looked at
[1:40:17] it but all I remember when God began to
[1:40:21] deal with my life brother Iraq and still
[1:40:25] remember the moment where he opened and
[1:40:28] revealed where this message was not a
[1:40:31] message of mama and daddy but this
[1:40:33] message became my message this message
[1:40:37] became a revelation of Jesus Christ to
[1:40:40] me personally that my sin debt was paid
[1:40:43] it became right it gave me life I
[1:40:47] remember that and I'm a living reality
[1:40:50] to this moment my eyes became open he
[1:41:00] raiseth he raiseth them that are bowed
[1:41:05] down I know I'm not gonna have time to
[1:41:07] go through all these but I just want you
[1:41:09] to know this is a present God he raises
[1:41:15] up those that are falling he raised them
[1:41:17] up those that are bound with infirmity
[1:41:21] he loosens him a mattre meet he exalteth
[1:41:26] he raiseth up things that you and I
[1:41:30] could never see he raises up that we can
[1:41:33] see him hey man those who are bowed down
[1:41:37] those who who are weak he raises up boom
[1:41:43] Naha like even the man at the gate
[1:41:45] called beautiful he raised that man that
[1:41:49] man was bound and lame from his mother's
[1:41:51] womb every one of us came to length
[1:41:54] spiritually from our mother's womb we
[1:41:59] couldn't walk right couldn't talk right
[1:42:03] couldn't live and write but all it took
[1:42:08] is the passing by of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:14] hallelujah when they came by the gate
[1:42:17] called beautiful silver and gold have I
[1:42:19] none but such as I have rise up in the
[1:42:23] name of Jesus Christ where wasn't the
[1:42:26] word of authority

[1:42:53] in his life brother that changed him

[1:47:38] talking about a living God but the way
[1:47:43] of the wicked he turned us upside down
[1:47:47] this is the only part here in this
[1:47:48] scripture all this whole portion of
[1:47:51] Scripture and lets it know the wicked
[1:47:55] everything's going right
[1:47:57] remember David said I've seen him
[1:47:59] prosper like the Green Bay tree and just
[1:48:02] all my everything is so good remember a
[1:48:04] song of saifa ASF Asaph in Psalm 73 a
[1:48:09] Seth got to looking at how the world was
[1:48:11] going my goodness it looks like they got
[1:48:13] it easy my goodness it looks like there
[1:48:15] ain't nothing come their way ma they
[1:48:17] don't have it as hard as I do my all the
[1:48:19] way down Psalm 73 and you get to a spot
[1:48:21] where you recognize Asaph was still
[1:48:23] coming to the house of God that had his
[1:48:25] eyes on the world it came to a certain
[1:48:27] spot in the psalm 73 where it says I
[1:48:30] hadn't lost my footing
[1:48:33] I had slipped why he got his eyes off of
[1:48:37] the god that he should have had his eyes
[1:48:39] on
[1:48:40] but God in His mercy that's why I love
[1:48:42] Psalm 73 in better they said God
[1:48:44] restored hey Seth his vision right back
[1:48:48] brother
[1:48:48] he won no longer just playing in the
[1:48:50] church his vision had been restored he
[1:48:54] got his eyes back in line
[1:48:56] I'm so glad so glad because the way of
[1:49:01] the wicked oh it seems your good seems
[1:49:04] seem so and I'm not talking about to
[1:49:06] that of the natural remember lot looked
[1:49:08] down there and he saw the well-watered
[1:49:11] Plains of Sodom like as unto the Garden
[1:49:15] of God
[1:49:16] it looks like one it kind of looks like
[1:49:18] the Garden of God it looks like a
[1:49:20] blessing all that looks like that's such
[1:49:22] green grass my tell you how that's all
[1:49:24] laid out there man I'm telling you there
[1:49:26] wouldn't be one problem my sheep my
[1:49:28] cattle they'll have no problem gracing
[1:49:30] over there but God notice Abraham
[1:49:33] Abraham stayed in the barren land only
[1:49:36] look barren to the natural i but it
[1:49:38] wasn't barren he he what does he do he
[1:49:40] leadeth me inside the green pastures it
[1:49:43] does not mean like we looked at on
[1:49:44] Tuesday Belly green deep grass that we
[1:49:47] can sit around and get all fat in it
[1:49:49] means he's leading us step by step of
[1:49:52] the way he gives us the food that we
[1:49:54] have need of the rest of the world says
[1:49:56] what do you see in this we look at it
[1:49:58] and say maja I am receiving the
[1:50:00] nourishment of the rushing mighty wind
[1:50:03] that is proper moisture and there is my
[1:50:06] food hidden in the rocks and there I'm
[1:50:09] following my shepherd the Lord is my
[1:50:12] shepherd and I shall not want
[1:50:16] the way of the wicked he turneth upside
[1:50:19] down
[1:50:23] and they just be very clear on this
[1:50:28] wickedness it's not altogether to go out
[1:50:33] into the world and sinning and
[1:50:36] everything else all those things are
[1:50:37] true that's part of wickedness but
[1:50:39] remember there's one sin and that's
[1:50:42] unbelief
[1:50:43] it's failing to accept what God has
[1:50:48] provided where a man will take a church
[1:50:51] membership or he'll take an
[1:50:54] acknowledgment of a creed well let me
[1:50:56] bring it on down he will take an
[1:50:58] acknowledgment of the message of the
[1:51:00] hour is the truth he will simply settle
[1:51:03] for that instead of ever getting what
[1:51:06] the message is really pointing to and
[1:51:09] it's really all about and that is the
[1:51:13] literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:51:15] the baptism of the holy ghost me remind
[1:51:19] you there'll be many disappointments
[1:51:22] come that day of rapture many
[1:51:25] disappointments
[1:51:26] now the bootlegger will not be
[1:51:28] disappointed the drunkard will not be
[1:51:30] disappointed the prostitute on and on
[1:51:33] they're not going to be disappointed but
[1:51:36] who's going to be disappointed is the
[1:51:39] church member those that set around it
[1:51:42] and Jesus even knows him as a friend
[1:51:46] when he came into the man who was
[1:51:48] sitting at the wedding supper he never
[1:51:50] called him stranger he said friend
[1:51:53] brother BAM tells us it shows he knew
[1:51:56] him by church acquaintance friend how
[1:51:59] did you get in here he was so close to
[1:52:03] the way but he would never submit he did
[1:52:06] not have to make the wedding garment all
[1:52:08] he had to do was receive and come God's
[1:52:15] provided way

[1:52:22] want to be his lover I want to be that
[1:52:26] son and daughter of God amen I want to
[1:52:28] be one that is submitted to him you
