[47:15] weekend
[47:22] and just so appreciate brother Nathan
[47:25] just yielding to the Lord and you know
[47:27] and and what has what started out as one
[47:30] part and you watched how the Holy Spirit
[47:32] just begin to take a hold in that
[47:34] service and I'm glad what I'm thankful
[47:36] for is lives and hearts that just be
[47:40] obedient to the Lord
[47:42] know there's some times where you come
[47:43] into a meeting and there's times where
[47:45] even sometimes where I've come into a
[47:47] meeting and I know it's kind of an
[47:49] arrest where I kind of think what God
[47:51] has a direction to go in you're kind of
[47:53] resting in that and then there's times
[47:55] where I've had things that all of a
[47:56] sudden I have to just start putting down
[47:58] notes and then things get extended here
[48:00] and there and but it's just what's
[48:02] wonderful I appreciate the minding the
[48:06] mind of the Lord because God knows what
[48:08] we need
[48:09] God knows what we need and I'll tell you
[48:11] what God has has just been so wonderful
[48:14] to us already and I'm of expectation
[48:17] here this morning amen God's going to do
[48:19] something very very special right here
[48:21] this morning and it's the way God comes
[48:24] it isn't in Breaking great big lights
[48:26] and flashing and things but God comes by
[48:29] way of his word and He makes himself
[48:31] known and there are things right while
[48:33] the word is coming forth that transpires
[48:36] you don't have to wait till the end but
[48:40] right while the words coming receive the
[48:42] word and the word will take an effect
[48:44] within your heart and in your life and
[48:46] just be obedient to the Lord God moves
[48:48] on your heart in the service and you
[48:50] want prayer at the end of the service
[48:51] we'd be happy to pray for you but we
[48:54] just want to let go and let God have his
[48:56] way this morning just pull on the gift
[48:58] of God God knows what we have need of
[49:00] and so I want to say to brother Nathan

[51:33] according to your world
[51:37] [Music]
[51:44] praise the Lord
[51:47] amen
[51:50] you know where the brand talks about a
[51:51] man named Zacharias there that
[51:56] the angel came and told him
[51:59] said Joel you'll have a child
[52:02] in his old age him and his wife and
[52:06] he couldn't understand that said
[52:11] so the angel said well you'll be you'll
[52:13] be dumb for the space of the pregnancy
[52:14] here and it's
[52:16] I think we'd be better off sometimes if
[52:19] God would just shut our mouths
[52:21] yeah like he did Zacharias there and
[52:23] brother M said he had all kinds of
[52:24] examples in the Bible of people that
[52:27] were Barren that had children
[52:30] and but then the angel came and
[52:33] told a young virgin said you're going to
[52:35] conceive not knowing a man
[52:38] she said be it unto me according to that
[52:41] word
[52:43] she didn't have one example in the Bible
[52:45] to go off of but she did have one verse
[52:48] that said it was going to happen
[52:50] and she said be it unto me according to
[52:52] Thy word so I pray that's our prayer
[52:54] this morning be it unto me whatever his
[52:56] word says
[52:58] Lord just be it unto me
[53:01] brother Nathan can you figure it all out
[53:02] no but just be it unto me
[53:04] how's it going to be when's it going to
[53:06] be I don't know but just be it unto me
[53:09] according to that word
[53:12] brother Sammy was talking about how he
[53:13] appreciated good friends and he has
[53:15] certainly become a good friend you know
[53:17] I have a tendency to get myself in
[53:19] trouble
[53:20] and speak when I should be silent and
[53:23] he has a tendency to be silent when he
[53:25] should speak so
[53:26] [Laughter]
[53:28] we uh we we've got to know each other I
[53:31] I need to start asking myself now what
[53:33] would brother Samuel do and it'll keep
[53:34] me out of trouble and then then he needs
[53:36] to ask well now what would brother
[53:37] Nathan do in this situation
[53:39] maybe he'll get in more trouble and I'll
[53:41] get in less that way
[53:43] but you know brother Willie I am not a
[53:45] detective
[53:47] but if I were you I would check brother
[53:49] Samuel's closet
[53:54] praise the Lord
[53:57] let's turn to Malachi this morning
[54:01] Malachi chapter 1.
[54:04] and uh
[54:10] look into the word this morning
[54:13] did that connect back there all right
[54:15] yeah
[54:18] Malachi chapter one and I am I was
[54:22] sitting there at the at a picnic table
[54:23] yesterday with some of the brothers
[54:24] fellowshipping and and they began to go
[54:27] down some paths with some conversations
[54:28] and things and the Lord was already
[54:31] beginning to deal with me a little bit
[54:32] for the service this morning and and I
[54:34] thought I I've just got to sit here and
[54:36] keep my mouth shutter I'm going to
[54:37] preach tomorrow's sermon and I asked
[54:40] myself what would brother Samuel do so I
[54:42] just
[54:44] and uh I'm learning brother I'm learning
[54:48] and so I uh I went back to the hotel
[54:53] yesterday afternoons began to study a
[54:55] little bit and and the Lord led me down
[54:58] a path and and um then went back over
[55:01] and had some more fellowship and Sister
[55:03] Kim said oh I think you should just keep
[55:05] going and she said that's been so good
[55:07] and so I didn't tell her last night but
[55:10] we're going to look at God's choice part
[55:12] three
[55:13] this morning so
[55:15] amen I had something in mind early on
[55:19] when brother Samuel invited me and a
[55:21] sermon that I'd preached a while back at
[55:23] at church and up in Canada last year and
[55:26] and I thought maybe I'd preached that
[55:28] this weekend just didn't seem like I
[55:29] could get to it but but the way this
[55:31] this sermon has went and the way the
[55:34] notes are today I actually borrowed a
[55:36] few of those notes so we'll get a little
[55:37] bit of it in anyhow but Malachi chapter
[55:40] 1
[55:42] and verse 1.
[55:44] the burden of of the word of the Lord to
[55:47] Israel by Malachi
[55:50] I have loved you saith the Lord
[55:54] yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us
[55:58] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[56:01] Lord yet I loved Jacob
[56:04] and I hated Esau
[56:07] I loved Jacob and I hated Esau so we
[56:11] want to look at this again this morning
[56:13] with the help of the Lord I'm God's
[56:14] choice and let's just bow our heads
[56:16] together this morning Heavenly Father
[56:19] Lord truly we are thankful Lord for your
[56:23] guidance for your lord the wisdom that
[56:26] you impart to each and every one of us
[56:28] for our daily needs and for the
[56:30] direction of Our Lives we're thankful
[56:32] for your word we're thankful for your
[56:35] promises Lord because we know that they
[56:37] are yea and amen and that anything that
[56:40] you say and anything that you do is
[56:42] perfect
[56:43] Lord we're we're imperfect in ourselves
[56:47] Lord but we serve a perfect God and so I
[56:51] pray that you would just have
[56:52] preeminence in this service this morning
[56:54] I pray you would get me out of the way
[56:56] so that you can speak something that
[56:59] would be of help I pray Lord that you
[57:01] would blessed this congregation bless
[57:03] the pastor Lord bless every musician
[57:06] every song leader every Deacon every
[57:09] trustee every Sunday school teacher Lord
[57:12] each part of the laity each member of
[57:14] the body Lord those that help so
[57:17] Faithfully yesterday and each one that
[57:19] has a part those that support with their
[57:21] tithes and their offerings and their
[57:23] prayers and their attendance Lord we're
[57:26] so thankful for churches like this that
[57:28] are standing for truth in this dark hour
[57:30] and Lord no doubt the enemy Lord how he
[57:34] loves to come against as your Prophet
[57:36] said the word didn't say that the gates
[57:39] of hell wouldn't be against the church
[57:41] but it said that they wouldn't prevail
[57:43] so we believe that's true for this local
[57:46] assembly as well Lord that the Gates of
[57:48] Hell May hate a work like this but yet
[57:51] it won't be able to Prevail because
[57:53] you're faithful and you're true Lord and
[57:56] there's promises in your word that says
[57:58] we're Overcomers and so we're thankful
[58:01] that there will be Overcomers in this
[58:02] age and Lord we just Commit This service
[58:05] to you and and for the outcome Lord we
[58:07] pray that it'll be a help and a blessing
[58:09] and an encouragement we love you Lord
[58:11] and we thank you for all that you do in
[58:14] Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you
[58:17] richly you can be seated
[58:27] certainly appreciate
[58:30] brother Samuel's friendship and his
[58:32] invitation to be here and we certainly
[58:33] enjoyed his ministry last Labor Day
[58:36] weekend and and looking forward to it
[58:39] again this coming Labor Day Lord will
[58:41] willing and and appreciate his ministry
[58:43] and to stand for the word and all that
[58:45] God is doing here
[58:48] you know when we when we look back
[58:50] through history and we look at the
[58:51] scriptures
[58:53] we look at some of these characters of
[58:55] the Bible that we looked at
[58:57] over the last few Services no doubt in
[59:01] our mind there are many that we love to
[59:04] meet as I was talking about yesterday
[59:05] about how brother Branham said he'd love
[59:07] to shake uriah's hand for me I if you
[59:11] want to go to the Old Testament I I want
[59:12] to meet David
[59:14] if you go to the New Testament I I want
[59:16] to I want to meet Paul if you go to the
[59:19] church ages I want to meet brother
[59:21] Branham there there are ones that I want
[59:23] to eat most of all I want to see the
[59:24] Lord Jesus
[59:26] but there are characters that stand out
[59:28] to us that that you know this we uh
[59:33] something we connect with there whatever
[59:34] it be and so there's ones that I long to
[59:37] meet and and we look at it like that and
[59:40] maybe it's somebody different for you
[59:42] maybe for some of the sisters it's Ruth
[59:44] or Esther or Deborah or maybe Mary or
[59:48] different ones in the scriptures there
[59:49] that you'd like to meet and maybe for
[59:52] some of the brothers you know maybe for
[59:54] some of our bodybuilders it's Sam Center
[59:56] you know whoever whoever it is that you
[59:59] you look up to in the scripture I wasn't
[1:00:00] pointing fingers brother brother Sammy
[1:00:03] fingers over here I wasn't pointing
[1:00:05] things
[1:00:06] maybe maybe you know whoever it is that
[1:00:09] you uh you want to meet in the Bible but
[1:00:11] you know I believe that they're over
[1:00:12] there looking down into this age
[1:00:15] sir and to see the darkest age that has
[1:00:18] ever been wickedness yeah spiritual
[1:00:21] wickedness in high places and we'll get
[1:00:24] over there and we'll want to hear how
[1:00:25] David overcame and how jephthah and and
[1:00:28] how Gideon and and different ones how
[1:00:31] they overcame and and they'll say now
[1:00:33] wait a minute aren't you from laodicea
[1:00:36] aren't she from down there and in the
[1:00:38] darkest most evil age that ever was we
[1:00:40] want to hear your testimony how on Earth
[1:00:42] did you ever make it
[1:00:44] it's hard for us to
[1:00:47] to look at it like that because you know
[1:00:49] we can't go back in the pages of the
[1:00:51] Bible maybe and find our name and our
[1:00:53] story because it's still being written
[1:00:55] but just as those men were Overcomers in
[1:00:58] their age there has to be Overcomers in
[1:01:00] this age and so
[1:01:02] yeah so I I'm afraid many times we take
[1:01:04] that for granted and we we Look
[1:01:06] Backwards or we look forwards but we
[1:01:08] fail to recognize what God is doing
[1:01:10] right now Romans chapter 9 and verse 11
[1:01:14] we want to look at this what uh what
[1:01:17] Malachi was referring to here we want to
[1:01:19] look at it a little further this morning
[1:01:20] for the children being not yet born
[1:01:25] neither having done any good or evil
[1:01:28] that the purpose of God according to
[1:01:32] election might stand not of works but of
[1:01:36] him that calleth it was said unto her
[1:01:39] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[1:01:43] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[1:01:47] have I hated now notice Paul's saying
[1:01:50] here that children not being born yet
[1:01:53] and not having even done any good or
[1:01:56] evil but that the purpose of God
[1:01:59] according to election would stand God
[1:02:01] could look down through time and he
[1:02:03] would say Jacob have I loved and Esau
[1:02:07] have I hated now you don't understand
[1:02:09] predestination by foreknowledge and the
[1:02:12] election and the calling of God then you
[1:02:14] look at statements like this and if
[1:02:16] you're not careful you begin to think
[1:02:18] well that is so unfair of God here here
[1:02:20] these men hadn't even been born they
[1:02:23] hadn't done any good or any bad to be
[1:02:25] judged by and yet God already made his
[1:02:28] choice but yet if you understand
[1:02:30] election then you're very thankful for
[1:02:34] this type of scripture you see a man
[1:02:36] like Jacob would be so thankful for
[1:02:38] election because God can look down
[1:02:40] before there was a Jacob and love him a
[1:02:44] man like Esau says now that's not fair
[1:02:46] God I hadn't even done anything yet but
[1:02:48] God by foreknowledge God didn't just go
[1:02:50] down through time and say eeny meeny
[1:02:53] miny moe and and go back and forth I'll
[1:02:55] take this and I won't take that one and
[1:02:57] I like this I don't like that one but
[1:02:59] God by foreknowledge could see the end
[1:03:00] from the beginning he knew what she
[1:03:03] would do he knew what your actions would
[1:03:05] be he knew that she would be sitting
[1:03:07] here this morning he knew what your name
[1:03:09] would be 300 years ago before your great
[1:03:12] great grandparents ever knew what their
[1:03:15] children's name would be he knew what
[1:03:16] your name would be he knew when you
[1:03:18] would come to the Earth he knew what
[1:03:20] color eyes you would have what color
[1:03:22] hair you would have who your parents
[1:03:24] would be who your grandparents would be
[1:03:26] he could look down through time and see
[1:03:28] by predestination and foreknowledge all
[1:03:30] of these things that's why in the Garden
[1:03:33] of Eden when Adam fell it didn't shock
[1:03:35] God God knew that was going to take
[1:03:37] place when Judas betrayed Jesus it
[1:03:39] didn't shock Jesus Jesus knew that the
[1:03:42] Betrayal was coming because he knew all
[1:03:44] things and so God looks at things
[1:03:47] differently than you and I do and we get
[1:03:49] so worried we we go through something
[1:03:51] like this pandemic that we just came
[1:03:53] through of coven and if we're not
[1:03:54] careful fear begins to creep in and grip
[1:03:58] the people they begin to be afraid and
[1:04:00] begin to worry to be upset but God has
[1:04:03] already looked down through time God
[1:04:05] knows what my end will be
[1:04:08] there was a man in the Civil War a
[1:04:10] general by the name of Stonewall Jackson
[1:04:13] and they called him Stonewall because
[1:04:14] he'd stand right out there on the
[1:04:16] battlefield on his horse and and and
[1:04:18] bullets and cannonballs be flying all
[1:04:21] around him and he'd just stand there
[1:04:22] like a stone wall and they asked him one
[1:04:25] time and said how can you do that he
[1:04:26] said God has predetermined the time of
[1:04:29] my departure and he said so I am just as
[1:04:32] safe on the battlefield as I am in my
[1:04:35] own bed
[1:04:38] God knows all about us God could look
[1:04:42] back through I almost forgot to share
[1:04:44] this testimony I was going to share this
[1:04:45] weekend but God brought it right back
[1:04:47] around so God knows what he's doing and
[1:04:49] you know God can look back
[1:04:52] at the time and he can look forward
[1:04:53] through time and God knew hey there are
[1:04:55] people who their lineage was snuffed out
[1:04:59] because the last man in the family was
[1:05:01] killed in a war or was killed in a
[1:05:04] plague and we've come through ages of
[1:05:06] Dark Ages and we've come through ages of
[1:05:09] plagues and of famines and of wars and
[1:05:13] great turmoil and yet somehow you got
[1:05:16] here even though maybe you had a great
[1:05:18] great granddaddy in World War one or a
[1:05:21] grandfather in World War II or a daddy
[1:05:23] that was maybe in in the Korean war or
[1:05:25] in Vietnam or something like that and
[1:05:28] maybe men falling to the left of them
[1:05:30] and to the right of them maybe they went
[1:05:32] through all kinds of sickness and
[1:05:33] pandemics and things if you trace your
[1:05:35] lineage back maybe you had people back
[1:05:37] there in the days of the plagues and
[1:05:40] things like that and and when there were
[1:05:42] thousands upon thousands dying over in
[1:05:44] Europe maybe in their own village and
[1:05:46] yet they would survive why because God
[1:05:49] had a predestinated seed that he had
[1:05:51] looked down down through time and he
[1:05:53] knew you would be here this morning
[1:05:55] and then we get a little scared well
[1:05:57] what about this and what about that
[1:05:59] we've got a sister in our church one of
[1:06:02] one of my deacons wives that not one of
[1:06:04] his wives like he has many wives but
[1:06:07] my Deacon one of my deacons has a wife
[1:06:11] that you got to be careful how you word
[1:06:13] things or people begin to add their own
[1:06:15] interpretation to it
[1:06:17] but he uh the sister her dad lived in
[1:06:22] Germany during the time of World War II
[1:06:24] and and he was a Jewish young man about
[1:06:27] 11 or 12 years old and and he was taken
[1:06:30] and placed into one of the prison camps
[1:06:32] there and he would see them take people
[1:06:34] into the gas Chambers and and would see
[1:06:36] people by the thousands being killed and
[1:06:39] and and one day he would he would see
[1:06:42] them gathering together a big group of
[1:06:44] people and that he was there with and
[1:06:46] and he just felt to hand supernaturally
[1:06:49] pick him up and place him on the other
[1:06:51] side of the fence and he looked around
[1:06:53] to see who it was that had done that and
[1:06:55] there was nobody there but separated him
[1:06:57] from that group of people that was being
[1:06:59] taken to the gas chamber and another
[1:07:01] time a man met him over by a fence on
[1:07:04] the exterior perimeter there and it was
[1:07:06] a farmer that would bring in supplies
[1:07:08] and produce and things and he said
[1:07:10] listen I've got word that they're going
[1:07:12] to kill a bunch of you all tomorrow but
[1:07:14] if you can meet me at this certain gate
[1:07:16] I'll smuggle you out of here and I'll
[1:07:18] get you across the border into another
[1:07:20] country and he got out and escaped when
[1:07:23] there were others of his relatives and
[1:07:24] things that died during that time but
[1:07:27] God protected and preserved that line
[1:07:30] because there was a sister that was
[1:07:31] predestinated to receive the message in
[1:07:34] this age that had to be here
[1:07:37] [Applause]
[1:07:38] and maybe thousands dying to the left of
[1:07:41] him and thousands dying to the right but
[1:07:43] yet she's there she survived her lineage
[1:07:46] was preserved and and we can't figure
[1:07:49] those things out when we think about
[1:07:51] eternity and things like that it's
[1:07:52] enough to our little human Minds can't
[1:07:54] comprehend it all but God can look down
[1:07:57] at their eternity and knows what will be
[1:07:59] and knows what will take place and Satan
[1:08:02] has maybe been after you since the very
[1:08:04] time of your birth yet we find that he
[1:08:07] wasn't able to Snuff out your life
[1:08:09] because God had a plan for you maybe
[1:08:11] he's tried to discourage him maybe he's
[1:08:14] tried to destroy you maybe he's tried to
[1:08:16] sap your Victory and he's trying to keep
[1:08:19] you pushed down but yet somehow that
[1:08:22] predestinated seed you can bury it under
[1:08:24] semen or whatever it'd be it'll find a
[1:08:26] way out and said you core you pour
[1:08:29] cement over a seed and he said you
[1:08:31] watched around the edges of it it'll
[1:08:33] begin to come out and begin to find
[1:08:34] light so I believe that's how it is by
[1:08:37] the predestinated of God brother man
[1:08:39] said that man went out on a Jeep ride
[1:08:41] after there had been all kinds of bombs
[1:08:42] and things in the war there and he said
[1:08:44] he was looking around just Devastation
[1:08:46] everywhere and he picked up a rock and
[1:08:49] under that rock was a little flower
[1:08:51] hey man oh hide me in the cleft of the
[1:08:54] rock Jehovah
[1:08:56] we have a brother from our church that's
[1:08:58] a deacon brother brother uh brother
[1:08:59] Samuel knows him very well from from byc
[1:09:02] in different places Brother David Hoover
[1:09:04] and his dad was a Pentecostal preacher
[1:09:07] that that knew brother Branham his name
[1:09:08] was L.G Hoover and brother banham goes
[1:09:11] and dedicates his church in in the 50s
[1:09:14] there and down in Elizabethtown Kentucky
[1:09:16] and brother LG Hoover his mom was a
[1:09:20] Praying believing Christian and and she
[1:09:23] actually would would go and and brother
[1:09:25] Brandon would have her come in as a
[1:09:27] nanny for some of the children there in
[1:09:29] their home that she would help with the
[1:09:31] children when brother Branham and sister
[1:09:32] Brandon were traveling and things like
[1:09:34] that and and brother Hoover has a lot of
[1:09:36] testimonies about that that he can share
[1:09:37] you sometime but but when LG Hoover
[1:09:40] brother Hoover's dad was was a young man
[1:09:42] he joins the military or he was drafted
[1:09:45] I can't remember which but he winds up
[1:09:47] in World War II at a battle called the
[1:09:50] Battle of the Bulge which was a very
[1:09:52] bloody battle that not a whole lot of
[1:09:54] people came out of and and I had an
[1:09:55] uncle on my mom's side we've married one
[1:09:58] of her sisters and and he and my uncle
[1:10:00] he he was a Purple Heart veteran there
[1:10:03] from the Battle of the Bulge and he
[1:10:05] looked like Santa Claus he had a big old
[1:10:07] white beard and things but he was in
[1:10:09] that battle and almost all of his
[1:10:10] platoon got destroyed and so LG Hoover
[1:10:13] he's over here and they get to where the
[1:10:16] Battle of the Bulge is going to be there
[1:10:18] and and there there's a hotel there that
[1:10:20] the U.S troops come in and take control
[1:10:22] of and they think we're finally going to
[1:10:24] be able to spend the night in a nice bed
[1:10:26] tonight and then there was a man there
[1:10:29] with the English troops that he
[1:10:31] outranked the U.S officer there and he
[1:10:34] came in and said you get these U.S
[1:10:36] troops out of here the English troops
[1:10:38] are going to sleep in a bed tonight so
[1:10:39] they had to go out and just find
[1:10:41] different places around this Village to
[1:10:43] sleep well brother L.G Hoover he finds
[1:10:46] himself in a chicken coop with a uh I I
[1:10:49] believe it was a African-American man on
[1:10:52] one side of him and uh no I'm sorry it
[1:10:54] was a Mexican man on one side of him him
[1:10:56] and a Native American Indian on the
[1:10:58] other side of him and these three men
[1:10:59] bunched together in this chicken coop
[1:11:02] sleeping and in the middle of the night
[1:11:04] the Germans realize that they're there
[1:11:07] in the city and they begin to bomb the
[1:11:09] hotel and begin to shoot bombs and shoot
[1:11:12] missiles and things in and begin to
[1:11:14] destroy it in about four in the morning
[1:11:16] the top of the chicken coop disappears
[1:11:19] it explodes and and they sit up and they
[1:11:21] looked at one another and said what is
[1:11:22] it taking place here and LG said well I
[1:11:25] don't know but he said we're all right
[1:11:26] let's go back to sleep and in the middle
[1:11:28] of all this they go back to sleep in the
[1:11:30] middle of the night in this chicken coop
[1:11:32] well the the Native American Indian man
[1:11:35] was sleeping in the middle of the two
[1:11:36] other men and when they woke up they
[1:11:39] looked down and he was sleeping with his
[1:11:41] legs spread out like this and right in
[1:11:43] the middle of his legs was a mortar
[1:11:46] shell buried in the ground
[1:11:49] but it didn't go off
[1:11:51] I'm sure they very carefully got out of
[1:11:54] that chicken coop
[1:11:55] and he was a little Shook Up by this
[1:11:59] and so they would go and and they would
[1:12:02] begin to get their supplies and things
[1:12:04] the next day and after the battle was
[1:12:06] over and and they began to recuperate
[1:12:08] their lines and things and patent had
[1:12:10] got some people around behind the German
[1:12:12] lines and and brought them back some
[1:12:13] reinforcements and they were able to win
[1:12:15] that battle even though they were
[1:12:16] outnumbered and surrounded initially and
[1:12:19] so as things begin to catch up with the
[1:12:21] process there they begin to get mail
[1:12:23] again through the lines and and LG goes
[1:12:26] down one day to get a letter and there's
[1:12:28] a letter that's dated the day of the
[1:12:30] Battle of the Bulge and it's from his
[1:12:32] mother and he opens it up and she said
[1:12:34] LG I don't know where you are
[1:12:38] and said it's four in the morning and
[1:12:40] God woke me up
[1:12:42] and she said I'm praying for you
[1:12:45] [Applause]
[1:12:46] and she said I sent something with you
[1:12:48] in this letter and she'd taken from her
[1:12:50] Bible and cut out the psalm there and it
[1:12:53] said of thousands of all the left of
[1:12:56] thee and a thousand shall fall to the
[1:12:58] right but it won't touch you
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:02] God knows what he's doing
[1:13:06] he knows the path that he's chose for
[1:13:08] you maybe if it had been you you would
[1:13:10] have chose a different path brother
[1:13:12] random said he what if he wanted to be a
[1:13:14] Trapper he wanted to be back there with
[1:13:16] Bud Southwick and just let everything go
[1:13:19] and go out there but God showed him what
[1:13:21] that future held
[1:13:22] God had a better choice for him
[1:13:25] hey when I was 21 I was a a young man
[1:13:29] with a call on my life in Jeffersonville
[1:13:32] Indiana where preachers if you don't
[1:13:33] know aren't very popular and all the
[1:13:35] girls that I wanted to date weren't
[1:13:36] interested in dating a preacher and I
[1:13:38] decided I was going to move to
[1:13:40] Indianapolis and be a police officer but
[1:13:42] God had different plans for me that was
[1:13:44] my plan
[1:13:46] but God had a different plan amen
[1:13:49] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 4.
[1:13:53] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:13:59] when I came to an altar one time
[1:14:02] when somebody handed me a message book
[1:14:05] when somebody gave me a Bible
[1:14:08] he had chosen Us in him
[1:14:13] nation of the world
[1:14:15] now people who get mad at brother
[1:14:17] Brandon for preaching predestination
[1:14:19] they ought to be honest with themselves
[1:14:20] and get mad at Paul and get mad at the
[1:14:22] Lord Jesus and get mad at John the
[1:14:24] Revelator and get mad at all these other
[1:14:26] men that talked about predestination
[1:14:29] he had chosen Us in him before the
[1:14:33] foundation of the world before when God
[1:14:36] created the earth and the dust that was
[1:14:38] there in the earth he pulled Adam from
[1:14:40] that and each one of us was laying there
[1:14:43] in the dust and and before that dust was
[1:14:46] even created before you were even
[1:14:48] thought of by Humanity before your
[1:14:51] parents had any idea that you were on
[1:14:53] the way before Adam was breathed the
[1:14:55] breath of life into his lungs before
[1:14:57] there was a moon or a star or a Galaxy
[1:15:00] or a universe before the Earth was
[1:15:03] created God before the foundation of the
[1:15:06] world had you in his mind
[1:15:09] and not only did he have you in his mind
[1:15:11] he chose you
[1:15:14] in him before the foundation of the
[1:15:16] world he could look down before Jeremiah
[1:15:19] was born and say before you were formed
[1:15:22] in your mother's womb I chose you and I
[1:15:25] ordained you I elected you to be a
[1:15:28] prophet of God Amen well if he knew that
[1:15:31] Jeremiah would be a prophet he knew what
[1:15:33] I would be he knew what she would be
[1:15:36] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:15:40] before him in love now I won't ask you
[1:15:42] to raise your hand but I'll just raise
[1:15:44] my hand and say hey there's so many
[1:15:46] times I don't feel holy and Without
[1:15:48] Blame
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:53] because by my works and by my abilities
[1:15:57] I'm not holy and I'm not without blame
[1:16:00] but I'm holy and Without Blame because
[1:16:02] he's not looking at my human weakness
[1:16:05] he's not looking at my failures he's not
[1:16:08] looking for every time I Stumble he's
[1:16:10] looking at what his thought was of me
[1:16:12] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:16:15] he chose me
[1:16:17] in him before the foundation of the
[1:16:20] world we should be holy and Without
[1:16:22] Blame before him in love
[1:16:24] having predestinated us unto the
[1:16:27] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:16:30] himself
[1:16:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:16:34] will
[1:16:35] now brother remember says in the church
[1:16:36] age book he says you can't read it any
[1:16:39] other way the heart purpose the Eternal
[1:16:42] purpose of God was to take a bride of
[1:16:46] his own choosing
[1:16:47] and that purpose was in himself and
[1:16:51] being Eternal was decreed before the
[1:16:54] foundation of the world
[1:16:56] amen before you had any choice in it God
[1:16:59] looked down through time and said I
[1:17:01] Choose You
[1:17:02] that's right amen you can't outrun
[1:17:05] election
[1:17:08] God chose you
[1:17:11] how did you come to this oh
[1:17:13] I came to this because somebody handed
[1:17:15] me a book no that that's how you begin
[1:17:17] to realize
[1:17:18] how you came to this
[1:17:21] well when were you saved all brother
[1:17:23] names and it was at a camp meeting I
[1:17:25] remember who was preaching I remember
[1:17:27] the song leader I remember who was
[1:17:30] playing the music that night I remember
[1:17:31] the sermon and I came down to the altar
[1:17:34] that's when I say no that's when you
[1:17:36] realize that you were saved you were
[1:17:39] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:17:43] with me she saved oh I was saved Back 2
[1:17:47] 000 years ago when Jesus died on Calvary
[1:17:49] no that's when the price was paid for
[1:17:52] your salvation but you were saved before
[1:17:56] the foundation of the world
[1:17:58] God looked down through time and he said
[1:18:02] I choose this one I choose that one
[1:18:04] because I see something in them I see
[1:18:08] the nature that's in them I see what
[1:18:10] they'll be because I've elected them by
[1:18:13] my foreknowledge and he chose you and
[1:18:16] you say well my brother Nathan Jesus
[1:18:18] wasn't even crucified then how can I be
[1:18:20] saved because the Bible said that the
[1:18:22] lamb was slain before the foundation of
[1:18:24] the world
[1:18:26] now he wasn't physically slain but in
[1:18:29] God's mind he had already thought it and
[1:18:32] so it was going to take place no matter
[1:18:34] how many demons out of hell tried to
[1:18:36] stop it it was going to take place
[1:18:38] because in God's mind there was a lamb
[1:18:41] who had been slain now we can say Amen
[1:18:43] to that but can we say Amen to the fact
[1:18:45] that we were in his mind as well and
[1:18:48] doesn't matter how many demons out of
[1:18:50] hell try to stop it you didn't choose
[1:18:53] him he chose you
[1:18:56] amen the Bible said we love him amen
[1:19:00] because
[1:19:03] he first loved us
[1:19:05] the man said you didn't go seeking after
[1:19:07] God God went seeking after you you say
[1:19:10] oh no brother Nathan I remember I got a
[1:19:12] burden on my heart I begin to feel a
[1:19:14] pull yes but who put that pool there
[1:19:18] you were just responding to the fact
[1:19:20] that he came seeking and searching after
[1:19:23] you if you ever sought him it was only
[1:19:26] because he was seeking you first
[1:19:30] he came seeking and searching those who
[1:19:33] he had predestinated now brother Banner
[1:19:35] would say it this way he said there in
[1:19:37] the journey in the wilderness the
[1:19:38] children of Israel it said that there
[1:19:40] wasn't one of them that was feeble among
[1:19:42] them they were healthy through the
[1:19:44] Journey he talks about Dr Moses's script
[1:19:47] bag what it must have looked like there
[1:19:48] and he said somebody came up said I've
[1:19:50] got a toothache he said oh I've got
[1:19:51] something for you here open up his
[1:19:53] doctors back somebody came up and said
[1:19:54] oh I got this I got that what was his
[1:19:56] prescription I am the Lord that healeth
[1:19:58] all thy diseases and so there wasn't a
[1:20:01] feeble one among them all that time they
[1:20:03] went through there and sickness was
[1:20:05] stayed back from them God said what was
[1:20:07] God said excuse me well God said it
[1:20:10] through the prophet but rather than said
[1:20:12] that what God did there was he allowed
[1:20:14] Israel to draw dividends on a down
[1:20:17] payment that hadn't been made yet
[1:20:21] they were drawing strength from an
[1:20:24] atonement that hadn't even been made yet
[1:20:26] it had just been promised
[1:20:30] to mind it was settled amen that even
[1:20:33] though it hasn't actually come to
[1:20:34] completion yet I know that the price is
[1:20:38] paid so hey I want you to go down here
[1:20:39] to the bank and say hey I've got a rich
[1:20:41] aunt and I'm in her will and you know
[1:20:43] when she dies she's going to leave me
[1:20:45] all this money so I'd just like to go
[1:20:47] ahead and start drawing dividends on
[1:20:49] that investment they'll laugh at you
[1:20:51] they'll run you out of the bank but God
[1:20:52] allowed it amen God allowed them to draw
[1:20:55] dividends on a down payment that hadn't
[1:20:58] even been made yet all friends and then
[1:21:00] we get flustered and we get worried oh
[1:21:03] God I do you understand and God do you
[1:21:05] see and God do you care he cared so much
[1:21:08] that before there was even a World
[1:21:10] created in here in his mind he knew
[1:21:13] about you he knew what your trial would
[1:21:16] be he knew it's your Temptation would be
[1:21:18] he knew what your circumstance would be
[1:21:21] he knew the pressures he knew the things
[1:21:23] that she would face the opposition and
[1:21:26] the persecution and he was already
[1:21:27] making a way for you
[1:21:29] before you needed a way he had already
[1:21:31] provided away
[1:21:34] Church age book again they he's talking
[1:21:36] about the children of Israel there in
[1:21:37] the wilderness they had their side that
[1:21:39] wasn't praiseworthy sounds like he's
[1:21:41] talking about some message believers
[1:21:45] phaseworthy but in spite of their
[1:21:47] imperfections by the purpose of God that
[1:21:51] works through election by grace and not
[1:21:53] by works they had the cloud by day and
[1:21:56] the pillar of Fire by night they had the
[1:21:59] smitten a rock and the Brazen serpents
[1:22:01] and the signs and wonders they were
[1:22:03] Vindicated not in themselves but in God
[1:22:10] amen he chose me
[1:22:13] it was his choice that elected me
[1:22:17] I didn't come up with this I didn't work
[1:22:19] myself into this I didn't educate myself
[1:22:22] into this he chose me
[1:22:26] amen then he's obligated to carry me
[1:22:28] through
[1:22:32] Jacob have I loved and Esau have a hate
[1:22:35] and let's be honest just like these
[1:22:37] other men that we looked at if we had
[1:22:38] been choosing we would have chose the
[1:22:40] exact opposites we would have looked at
[1:22:43] Esau and said hey he's a pretty good
[1:22:44] church member hey look at his attendance
[1:22:48] records and look at his tithe records
[1:22:50] and look how nice he is to his mommy and
[1:22:52] his daddy my he'd make a good Deacon or
[1:22:54] a good Sunday school teacher look at
[1:22:56] this man look at his works and God
[1:22:58] looked down and said I chose Jacob I
[1:23:01] love Jacob and I hate Esau and we look
[1:23:05] at he saw a little seister a deceiver
[1:23:08] always trying to go around do something
[1:23:10] but there was something in Jacob he
[1:23:12] didn't care how he got the birthright he
[1:23:15] just knew he had to have it and Esau
[1:23:17] looked at the same thing and despised
[1:23:19] the birthright it was something that had
[1:23:21] become common to him and that attribute
[1:23:23] in them God looked down through time he
[1:23:25] said I love Jacob and I hate Esau amen
[1:23:28] hey there were better people in New
[1:23:31] Albany Indiana when I was born in 1982
[1:23:33] in Floyd Memorial Hospital there there
[1:23:35] were better people that God could have
[1:23:37] picked he didn't pick me because I was
[1:23:39] better than somebody he picked me
[1:23:41] because he saw an attribute down inside
[1:23:44] of me that was a reflection of damn
[1:23:47] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 25 husbands
[1:23:50] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:23:53] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:23:55] and all the sisters said
[1:23:59] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:24:02] with the washing of the Water by the
[1:24:05] word that he might present it unto
[1:24:08] himself a glorious Church
[1:24:10] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[1:24:15] thing but that it should be holy and
[1:24:18] without blemish
[1:24:20] don't raise your hands this morning but
[1:24:22] how many feels holy and without blemish
[1:24:26] come on now
[1:24:27] I don't feel holy and without blemish
[1:24:30] you can watch my life for a while and
[1:24:32] you recognize brother Nathan he's my
[1:24:34] he's a pretty good brother but without
[1:24:36] spot
[1:24:37] or without wrinkle
[1:24:39] without anything any any blemish
[1:24:42] I don't know about that but I can look
[1:24:45] back and shoot and say the same thing
[1:24:48] but Paul says that God chose this church
[1:24:53] knowing that she would be without spot
[1:24:56] or wrinkle without a blemish holy
[1:25:00] brother Adam said how's it going to be
[1:25:01] he said I don't know but God's word said
[1:25:03] it'll be so there'll be one that's there
[1:25:08] Jesus says in Matthew chapter 5 verse 48
[1:25:11] be therefore perfect
[1:25:14] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:25:17] is perfect
[1:25:18] well I won't ask you to raise your hands
[1:25:19] on this either but how many feel perfect
[1:25:22] this morning well don't worry I wouldn't
[1:25:23] have my hand up either
[1:25:25] I don't feel perfect talk to my wife
[1:25:28] long enough she'll explain to you in
[1:25:29] detail I'm not perfect
[1:25:33] I haven't met a perfect pastor I haven't
[1:25:36] met a perfect deacon
[1:25:39] I haven't met a perfect song leader or a
[1:25:42] perfect Sunday school teacher I haven't
[1:25:44] met a perfect evangelist
[1:25:46] I haven't met a perfect church member
[1:25:51] but Jesus says be therefore perfect
[1:25:55] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:25:56] is perfect well how are we going to do
[1:25:58] these things a church without spot or
[1:26:00] blemish
[1:26:01] not ring not a wrinkle holy
[1:26:05] and then we got to be perfect as our
[1:26:07] Father in heaven was perfect well it
[1:26:09] looks like Jesus set the bar higher than
[1:26:12] we're able to attain to
[1:26:14] all right now you're beginning to
[1:26:16] realize
[1:26:17] what we've been looking at this weekend
[1:26:20] that it's not our ability
[1:26:23] it is impossible for me to attain to
[1:26:25] these scriptures that we just read
[1:26:27] it is impossible for me I don't have
[1:26:30] enough good works I don't have the
[1:26:32] ability I don't have the personality I
[1:26:34] don't have the wisdom the knowledge I
[1:26:36] don't have the ability to fulfill this
[1:26:39] on my own but I'm so thankful he's not
[1:26:42] expecting me to fulfill it on my own
[1:26:46] law in 1955 brother Brandon says now the
[1:26:49] blood could not be perfect by an animal
[1:26:51] but the blood in Christ was perfect now
[1:26:55] I will never be perfect and you will
[1:26:58] never be perfect
[1:27:00] I will never be perfect in your sight
[1:27:03] you will never be perfect in my sight
[1:27:05] but let's let's lay that aside
[1:27:09] what about in God's sights
[1:27:12] so that's what matters
[1:27:15] you know I
[1:27:16] it's not I don't say it to be to be
[1:27:18] cruel or or just to brush aside but when
[1:27:21] it comes right down to it what you think
[1:27:23] about me doesn't matter
[1:27:25] what I think about you doesn't matter
[1:27:27] really what we think about ourselves
[1:27:28] doesn't matter so much because many
[1:27:31] times the devil can get us in a corner
[1:27:32] where we think pretty low about
[1:27:34] ourselves but let's lay that aside
[1:27:37] let's lay all that aside what about
[1:27:40] God's sight
[1:27:42] I look at you as a human
[1:27:45] I look at she was a brother but God
[1:27:48] looks at you through the blood of his
[1:27:50] son as a redeemed one
[1:27:53] Jesus said be therefore perfect even as
[1:27:56] your father in Heaven is perfect and not
[1:27:58] what you've done you have nothing to
[1:28:01] Merit it but it's what Christ did for
[1:28:03] you oh do you see it
[1:28:06] the Perfection 1957 then my salvation
[1:28:11] yours tonight does not hinge upon the
[1:28:14] merits of our own acts it hinged upon
[1:28:18] the positive Sovereign Grace of almighty
[1:28:21] God who has chosen Us in him certainly I
[1:28:25] can never be perfect nor you could never
[1:28:27] be perfect and we don't claim to be
[1:28:29] perfect but we have this one consolation
[1:28:32] that our faith rests in a perfect
[1:28:35] sacrifice that's already been received
[1:28:42] man that kind of takes the pressure off
[1:28:44] doesn't it
[1:28:48] because I'm not depending on me I'm
[1:28:50] depending on him
[1:28:52] I'm not resting in me I'm resting in him
[1:28:57] oh
[1:28:58] Saint Paul we looked at him yesterday
[1:29:00] how that God had brought him
[1:29:03] from a man who persecuted the church
[1:29:06] a man who was constantly going about
[1:29:08] trying to upset and pull people out of
[1:29:10] churches and put him in prison and even
[1:29:12] consenting under their death and God
[1:29:14] takes this man and he calls him with
[1:29:18] such a high calling that he makes him
[1:29:20] the prophet messenger for that first
[1:29:22] church says the Ephesians Church age and
[1:29:25] he stands there no doubt feeling
[1:29:26] inadequate no doubt feeling unworthy and
[1:29:30] God would get a hold of his life in such
[1:29:31] a way and Paul would say it this way to
[1:29:33] the Corinthians and and in chapter 1
[1:29:35] verse 5 of Corinthians for I am the
[1:29:38] least of the Apostles as we looked at it
[1:29:40] the other day I don't think he was just
[1:29:41] saying this humbly I don't think he was
[1:29:43] just trying to show people his humility
[1:29:46] and and all what a what a nice man that
[1:29:49] Paul is but he's saying this from his
[1:29:51] heart I'm the least of the Apostles that
[1:29:54] I'm not meat to be called an apostle
[1:29:57] because I persecuted the church but
[1:30:00] by the grace of God I am what I am
[1:30:07] what's your testimony brother Nathan you
[1:30:10] want it in a nutshell but by the grace
[1:30:12] of God I am what I am
[1:30:16] wasn't because of my family name wasn't
[1:30:19] because of my ability wasn't because of
[1:30:23] of how many chapters of the Bible I read
[1:30:25] or how many tapes that I listened to or
[1:30:28] how many services I attend or or any any
[1:30:31] good work that I could do it wasn't
[1:30:33] because of that it was just his grace we
[1:30:36] sing it so many times that I think it
[1:30:38] just becomes a song to us instead of Our
[1:30:40] Testimony but I hope you don't lose
[1:30:42] sight of it the son said his grace has
[1:30:45] brought me safe this far and Grace will
[1:30:49] lead me on
[1:30:51] we have a tendency that when we get
[1:30:53] Beyond a trial when we get out of that
[1:30:55] Valley and we're on the Mountaintop all
[1:30:57] we look back we say oh thank you God
[1:30:58] you're so mighty you're so powerful God
[1:31:02] you're so good to us and then we get in
[1:31:04] the next trial and we forget about that
[1:31:07] we forget about all the things that he's
[1:31:09] brought us from and and the dark trials
[1:31:12] and how how desperate our circumstances
[1:31:15] looked and and yet God brought us
[1:31:17] through that and we can look back down
[1:31:20] through life and see he brought me from
[1:31:21] this sickness and he brought me from
[1:31:23] this persecution he brought me from this
[1:31:26] financial distress or or this
[1:31:28] circumstance in my personal life that I
[1:31:30] didn't know God how am I ever going to
[1:31:32] get Beyond this and yet he brought you
[1:31:34] through and then we get in the next
[1:31:36] round oh God I guess you just don't care
[1:31:40] I guess you just don't understand no the
[1:31:43] same God that brought you through the
[1:31:45] last trial can bring you through this
[1:31:47] one that's why God didn't just throw
[1:31:49] David out in the front of a giant there
[1:31:51] but he allowed a lion and a bear to come
[1:31:54] in and no doubt David could go down to
[1:31:56] the other Shepherds and say hey you all
[1:31:57] having any lying problems you all having
[1:32:00] any bad problems they'd say no man what
[1:32:02] are you talking about we haven't seen
[1:32:03] lions or bears around here in years he
[1:32:06] said well I don't understand every time
[1:32:07] I turn around there's something trying
[1:32:09] to come in and steal my sheep and I've
[1:32:11] got to raise up and fight against it and
[1:32:13] why why me God why did you allow these
[1:32:16] pressures on me instead of these other
[1:32:17] Shepherds because God was not training
[1:32:20] them to be giant slayers
[1:32:21] [Applause]
[1:32:24] God trusts us with trials because he
[1:32:27] knows what we can stand and he doesn't
[1:32:29] allow us to have more on us than we can
[1:32:32] bear and he pressurizes us for the
[1:32:35] pressures of the age and we look around
[1:32:37] we say oh God why did you allow this
[1:32:39] because he's preparing you for something
[1:32:42] he has to build a character inside of
[1:32:45] you he has to get you into a condition
[1:32:47] to be Rapture Ready and then we look at
[1:32:49] it and say well why doesn't my neighbor
[1:32:51] go through this and why doesn't this
[1:32:53] other brother go through this or go
[1:32:54] through that maybe God's not going to
[1:32:56] use them the way that he's going to use
[1:32:58] you
[1:32:59] maybe your testimonials shake the gates
[1:33:01] of hell when you stand and maybe see a
[1:33:04] little sister there that's going through
[1:33:05] a trial and maybe she doesn't know what
[1:33:07] to do or where to turn and she's about
[1:33:09] to lose her mind and you step up and you
[1:33:11] say it's honey I I know I know I was
[1:33:14] just like you I was going through this
[1:33:16] or I was going through that but I want
[1:33:18] to tell you God brought me through
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:22] yourself God can do it for little sister
[1:33:24] so and so surely he can do it for me
[1:33:27] there's many times in prayer lines where
[1:33:30] somebody will come up you know hey I
[1:33:33] I've never gone through menopause
[1:33:36] I don't plan to
[1:33:38] I don't identify as a 60 year old woman
[1:33:40] I don't plan to
[1:33:47] I told somebody I'm gonna start
[1:33:49] identifying as a senior citizen so I can
[1:33:51] get that discount at the restaurants
[1:33:55] people identify all this crazy stuff and
[1:33:58] Sanity right
[1:34:00] but I've never gone through that so I
[1:34:01] can pray for a sister
[1:34:05] and show her quotes of what brother
[1:34:06] Branham said about it I can try to
[1:34:08] encourage her but you know who can be a
[1:34:10] better help to her is a sister who's
[1:34:12] gone through it and come out the other
[1:34:13] side Victorious maybe it's how I felt
[1:34:15] like I was losing my mind I was so
[1:34:18] nervous I was so upset the devil
[1:34:20] tormented me I drove my husband crazy
[1:34:22] but you know what I came through it we
[1:34:24] came through Victorious
[1:34:29] good
[1:34:30] they can help more than I can yeah my
[1:34:33] wife and I never we never had a
[1:34:35] miscarriage I can pray for people I can
[1:34:38] sympathize with them I can some quotes
[1:34:40] and scriptures I can try to be an
[1:34:42] encouragement I can't Comfort them the
[1:34:44] way that somebody else that has gone
[1:34:45] through that camp that's right right
[1:34:47] I've had back pains from lifting
[1:34:50] something heavier than I should have
[1:34:51] lifted and pulling a muscle or something
[1:34:53] like that or sitting in the wrong
[1:34:55] position too long or something and and
[1:34:56] pulling a muscle or something about I've
[1:34:59] never had chronic back pain from disc
[1:35:01] troubles and things like that I pray I
[1:35:02] never do I've never had problems with my
[1:35:04] sciatic nerve and things like that I
[1:35:06] pray I never do and so when somebody
[1:35:08] comes up with in a prayer line that has
[1:35:10] had just extreme back trouble there's a
[1:35:12] couple brothers that if they're not
[1:35:13] there in the prayer line sometimes I'll
[1:35:15] call them up and have them pray with us
[1:35:16] because they've gone through that and
[1:35:18] they can enter into that person's
[1:35:20] suffering and they can tell them hey
[1:35:22] I've been there but God brought me
[1:35:24] through
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:26] we go through trials and we think oh God
[1:35:28] why didn't you allow this maybe God is
[1:35:30] preparing you to be an encourager for
[1:35:32] somebody else maybe God is using your
[1:35:34] testimony to deliver others and to help
[1:35:37] others somebody said oh my I wish I had
[1:35:39] brother Ron Spencer's testimonies I
[1:35:41] don't
[1:35:43] know that's right I don't say that to be
[1:35:45] detrimental to brother Ron I wouldn't
[1:35:47] want to go through what he's gone
[1:35:48] through to have those testimonies if God
[1:35:51] didn't call you to that you might not
[1:35:52] have made it through those trials and
[1:35:53] pressures
[1:35:55] I don't want his trials but I'm thankful
[1:35:57] that there's somebody that's standing
[1:35:58] that has testimonies like that
[1:36:01] it's encouraging to us
[1:36:03] the Paradox 1963 brother Brandon said
[1:36:06] I've seen critics stand off and make fun
[1:36:09] and carry on of the Holy Ghost Revival
[1:36:13] and after a while god get a hold of that
[1:36:15] same man
[1:36:16] and change him
[1:36:19] and here he stands right in the Pulpit
[1:36:21] preaching the same thing that he once
[1:36:24] hated
[1:36:26] it's a paradox how that God can take the
[1:36:29] unbeliever and make a Believer out of it
[1:36:33] praise the Lord
[1:36:35] amen we still serve that same God
[1:36:38] amen what a testimony that God could
[1:36:40] take somebody that hated it
[1:36:43] was against it
[1:36:45] turn them around and set them on fire
[1:36:47] for God do you realize that's what he
[1:36:49] did with Paul
[1:36:50] Paul was persecuting it and God got a
[1:36:53] hold of him
[1:36:54] and turn him around I want you to notice
[1:36:56] my I love this next quote here brother
[1:36:58] Branham talking and the grace
[1:37:01] that he has for people that are sitting
[1:37:03] there
[1:37:04] are even in their mind disagreeing and
[1:37:07] and in their mind thinking that it's
[1:37:09] false or
[1:37:11] thinking that it's a gimmicker or
[1:37:13] thinking that that you know that this
[1:37:15] isn't this can't be real and they're
[1:37:17] against it in their mind
[1:37:19] but Grace
[1:37:22] looks beyond your current condition
[1:37:26] Grace looks beyond your current attitude
[1:37:29] and your current condition your current
[1:37:31] situation and many times as Believers as
[1:37:34] we looked at with Samuel there he looked
[1:37:37] at a lion's
[1:37:39] physical condition and a stature and he
[1:37:42] judged him by that and said that must be
[1:37:44] the king but he hadn't even seen David
[1:37:46] yet but if he had seen him that would
[1:37:48] have been the last one there that he
[1:37:49] would have pitched
[1:37:51] and sometimes we'll look at somebody and
[1:37:53] we look at their current condition we
[1:37:55] look at their current attitude we look
[1:37:57] at their their current Outlook and and
[1:38:00] the current weight maybe they're not
[1:38:01] very receptive uh to the sermons I had a
[1:38:05] a young sister that used to her parents
[1:38:07] used to bring her to church and you
[1:38:08] could tell by the expression her faith
[1:38:09] she didn't want to be there
[1:38:12] sure you could preach her heart out and
[1:38:15] she'd sit there and just stare a hole
[1:38:16] right through you no no emotion no
[1:38:18] expression
[1:38:20] she come to the youth Bible studies and
[1:38:22] things and I think goodness gracious you
[1:38:24] can tell this girl just does not want to
[1:38:26] be here
[1:38:27] and now she married a young man for from
[1:38:30] our area and her family doesn't go to
[1:38:33] our church anymore they don't go to as
[1:38:35] far as I know they don't have a home
[1:38:36] church and there she is faithful
[1:38:39] every Sunday
[1:38:42] if I'd have been judging just by our
[1:38:44] outward appearance
[1:38:46] and you'd ask who
[1:38:48] from this family will be coming should
[1:38:50] have been the last one I would have
[1:38:51] picked
[1:38:53] she's the one that's faithful
[1:38:56] because God looked beyond her current
[1:38:57] attitude and her current condition
[1:39:01] amen if you'd have looked at me as a 19
[1:39:04] year old
[1:39:06] you wouldn't have picked me to be the
[1:39:07] guy that was preaching this revival
[1:39:08] meeting this weekend
[1:39:11] not that guy
[1:39:13] no you wouldn't you wouldn't have liked
[1:39:15] me as a 19 year old probably
[1:39:20] but God rich in Mercy
[1:39:23] but by the grace of God I am what I am
[1:39:28] I'll share this this part of the
[1:39:30] testimony I've shared at other places
[1:39:32] maybe it'll help a young person
[1:39:34] as I said I was raised in the message
[1:39:37] and raised in a message church and
[1:39:40] but that wasn't good enough just having
[1:39:42] a Christian Mommy and Daddy just
[1:39:44] attending a Christian Church that wasn't
[1:39:46] good enough for me I had to have an
[1:39:48] experience for myself
[1:39:50] and so I found that God as a very young
[1:39:53] man four or five years age I found out I
[1:39:56] had a call of God on my life to minister
[1:39:58] and as I began to be a teenager and
[1:40:01] recognized how unpopular that was in our
[1:40:03] area especially I began to run from that
[1:40:06] call of God in my life and I found out a
[1:40:09] little secret that the the further I got
[1:40:11] away from God the quieter that call got
[1:40:14] and the closer I got to God the stronger
[1:40:18] that call got
[1:40:19] I was up here at Brother Ray Erickson's
[1:40:21] Church in a meeting one night and
[1:40:22] brother Ron Spencer was preaching he
[1:40:23] looked right down at me made direct eye
[1:40:25] contact said there's a young man here
[1:40:27] tonight that God's got a call on his
[1:40:28] life I thought look somewhere else
[1:40:30] brother Ron
[1:40:35] he didn't have to tell me I knew
[1:40:38] foreign
[1:40:41] and I ran from it
[1:40:43] and I got to the spot where you know I
[1:40:46] I'll just be transparent with you this
[1:40:48] this one I never cared for alcohol I
[1:40:50] didn't enjoy the The Taste I didn't
[1:40:52] enjoy the effects but I wanted to prove
[1:40:55] to my buddies how big and bad I was
[1:40:58] so I'd get together with a couple of
[1:41:00] them that they'd also been raised in the
[1:41:02] message and had an apartment there and
[1:41:04] and they they moved out for Mommy and
[1:41:06] Daddy I was still back home with Mommy
[1:41:08] and Daddy but I'd go visit them and and
[1:41:11] sometimes I'd spend the night with them
[1:41:12] or different things and and you know
[1:41:14] they'd have one of them was old enough
[1:41:15] to buy alcohol and so he'd buy alcohol
[1:41:17] for all the rest of us and there I was
[1:41:19] as a 19 year old man and empty bottles
[1:41:22] in the trash cans and going to bed that
[1:41:24] night one of the young men that owned
[1:41:26] the apartment or rented it there he said
[1:41:28] you care if I turn on a tape
[1:41:33] well I've heard of mixed drinks but I
[1:41:35] didn't like mixing that together you
[1:41:37] know
[1:41:39] I didn't usually mix those two together
[1:41:42] but see he had got to a spot and he's
[1:41:44] he's passed on now I pray that that God
[1:41:47] got a hold of his soul before he left
[1:41:48] this world but but he'd got to a spot to
[1:41:51] where to listen to that voice it didn't
[1:41:54] convict him anymore it didn't condemn
[1:41:56] him it was just something he had been
[1:41:58] used to that comforted him to go to
[1:42:00] sleep at night it'd become background
[1:42:02] noise did it become white noise that
[1:42:04] just just something that was just out
[1:42:07] here you know on a surface level but
[1:42:09] wasn't entering down and so I said hey
[1:42:11] it's your your apartment you do what you
[1:42:13] want he said well I've only got two CDs
[1:42:15] here and he said I've got life story but
[1:42:17] I played that last night I said so I'll
[1:42:19] play this other one that I've got man
[1:42:20] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:42:26] and I laid there all night with that on
[1:42:28] repeat and it was like Adam Where Art
[1:42:31] Thou
[1:42:31] and I'd love to tell you that I just
[1:42:33] woke up the next morning I was filled
[1:42:35] with the Holy Ghost and and I went out
[1:42:36] and began to jump over a troop and leap
[1:42:39] over a wall and and but no it wasn't
[1:42:41] like that but it was a turning point it
[1:42:44] was a spot that God got my attention
[1:42:47] and I recognized that cannot be a
[1:42:49] coincidence out of 1200 to something
[1:42:52] tapes that you would have a man who was
[1:42:54] in no condition to be wanting to listen
[1:42:56] to it take play a tape that night and
[1:42:58] out of all the tapes that he could have
[1:42:59] picked to play that tape
[1:43:01] it got my attention there were other
[1:43:03] things that would happen that would get
[1:43:05] my attention and I began to turn around
[1:43:08] and I begin to to take steps in his
[1:43:11] Direction I found out whenever I'd take
[1:43:13] a step in his Direction he'd take
[1:43:15] several more in my direction
[1:43:17] I'll just try him this morning maybe you
[1:43:19] say but brother Nathan I've been on the
[1:43:20] wrong path and I've made the wrong
[1:43:22] choices oh yes he knows all about it he
[1:43:25] knew you'd make those choices before you
[1:43:27] did but just take a step towards him
[1:43:30] this morning and see what he'll do
[1:43:33] brother Randall says in Abraham's
[1:43:35] Covenant confirmed 1961 now listen
[1:43:37] Church
[1:43:38] I want to drop this in here
[1:43:41] because I believe the Holy Spirit told
[1:43:43] me to do it
[1:43:45] you may be sitting there which some of
[1:43:47] you are I know you are
[1:43:49] disagreeing with me right now
[1:43:52] I can call your name if you want me to
[1:43:57] my goodness
[1:43:59] he says now I'm going to drop this in
[1:44:02] here because the Holy Spirit wanted me
[1:44:04] to
[1:44:04] and there's some of you sitting here
[1:44:06] disagreeing with me and I can call your
[1:44:09] name if you want me to
[1:44:11] he said so I know that
[1:44:15] but I also can see farther than that
[1:44:19] amen that you're gonna believe it one of
[1:44:21] these days
[1:44:22] amen so I'm gonna just put this in so
[1:44:25] you'll understand so I can give you a
[1:44:28] little spot of Grace here
[1:44:32] oh
[1:44:34] what do you say this morning brother
[1:44:36] Nathan I say thank you God for a little
[1:44:39] spot of Grace that was left to me that
[1:44:41] even when I was bad even when I was
[1:44:44] wrong even when I was unlovable yet God
[1:44:47] knew my attitude he knew my thoughts he
[1:44:49] knew my opinion he knew my condition but
[1:44:52] he left a little spot of Grace there
[1:44:54] because he could look a little further
[1:44:56] than my current circumstance and see
[1:44:58] what I was going to be down the road
[1:45:00] amen amen I can give you a little spot
[1:45:03] of Grace here when it ain't going to be
[1:45:05] too long until you're going to change
[1:45:07] your mind some of you some of you won't
[1:45:11] oh I'm so thankful he had a man God had
[1:45:14] a man that could look a little further
[1:45:15] [Music]
[1:45:17] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 being
[1:45:20] confident of this very thing that he
[1:45:22] which has begun a good work in you will
[1:45:25] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:45:29] amen all right thank you Lord oh if he
[1:45:32] started to work in your life
[1:45:34] you may not be a
[1:45:37] you may not be able to compare with some
[1:45:39] of these other brothers and sisters
[1:45:41] around the message and and the devil
[1:45:42] keeps getting you to look and compare
[1:45:44] your life with theirs and and where
[1:45:46] they're at now but maybe they're way
[1:45:47] further in the journey than you are and
[1:45:49] maybe if they can take you back to their
[1:45:50] testimony just like I did and begin to
[1:45:53] show you hey you're looking at me now
[1:45:55] all right but if you only knew how far
[1:45:58] he'd brought me from
[1:46:00] and so you start off with Jesus and
[1:46:03] brother Adam said men aren't born men
[1:46:04] they're born babies and you look at some
[1:46:07] of these spiritually mature Christians
[1:46:09] and you think oh God why am I like that
[1:46:11] person well let them tell you their
[1:46:13] testimony from 20 years ago and you'll
[1:46:15] find they weren't always that way either
[1:46:17] but I believe they tell you but he who
[1:46:20] began a good work in you
[1:46:22] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:46:25] Christ
[1:46:26] brother Samuel sang that song He's still
[1:46:28] working on me
[1:46:30] and I was driving in the car yesterday
[1:46:31] my wife was telling me to do this and do
[1:46:33] that and I said she's still working on
[1:46:35] me
[1:46:36] to make me what she wants to be
[1:46:39] foreign
[1:46:45] I'll preach the rest of the sermon from
[1:46:47] down here
[1:46:52] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore
[1:46:54] sing
[1:46:56] we also are compassed about with so
[1:46:58] great a cloud of witnesses
[1:47:00] let us lay aside every way in the Sin
[1:47:03] which does so easily beset us and let us
[1:47:06] run with patience the race that is set
[1:47:08] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[1:47:11] and the finisher of our faith
[1:47:16] Jesus isn't like me and the way that I'm
[1:47:19] a procrastinator
[1:47:22] I'll start a project and
[1:47:24] well I'll get distracted
[1:47:28] I'll have good intentions to do
[1:47:30] something and I'll do something else
[1:47:33] I uh I'll start a book sometimes I
[1:47:36] probably have about 30 books at home
[1:47:38] that I've started and didn't finish
[1:47:40] because you know I got bored with a
[1:47:42] certain part in it or something and
[1:47:43] picked up the next book that looked a
[1:47:45] little more interesting
[1:47:49] I think they'd call that ADHD is what
[1:47:51] they
[1:47:52] try to label me as but I don't want your
[1:47:54] labels squirrel oh sorry
[1:47:58] [Applause]
[1:48:02] I don't want your label
[1:48:05] but Jesus isn't like me at least I
[1:48:07] didn't say Chipmunk we had a chipmunk
[1:48:10] emergency yesterday
[1:48:13] oh my
[1:48:16] God but Jesus isn't like that he doesn't
[1:48:18] start with brother Samuel and I said
[1:48:20] well you know he's he's not coming along
[1:48:22] as fast as I want him to I'll go to
[1:48:24] brother Stephen and then brother Stephen
[1:48:26] I I got a little distracted with him
[1:48:28] I'll go over brother Ray and I'll go to
[1:48:30] this one that one just leave us half
[1:48:32] finished projects all up all over but
[1:48:34] when God begins to work he's going to
[1:48:37] see it through to the completion
[1:48:41] he's not just the author of our faith
[1:48:44] he's the finisher of our faith
[1:48:47] young people middle age old whatever you
[1:48:50] are this morning I want to remind you
[1:48:52] that God is not just in the saving
[1:48:55] business but he's in the keeping
[1:48:57] business
[1:48:58] if he's powerful enough to save you he's
[1:49:01] powerful enough to keep you amen
[1:49:03] what does it take to make a Christian
[1:49:05] Life 1957 there isn't enough power in
[1:49:09] all hell that can ever defeat the
[1:49:11] purpose of God
[1:49:13] amen God will do it anyhow
[1:49:16] now I want to read you two more sections
[1:49:18] of scripture before we close these
[1:49:19] services
[1:49:21] and I I just want to look at some things
[1:49:22] well you know a culture out here will
[1:49:25] say all kinds of things about you
[1:49:27] they'll try to label you they'll try to
[1:49:29] put you in a box somewhere message
[1:49:31] Believers they'll try to get a spot
[1:49:33] where they can they can put you and say
[1:49:34] oh yes he's of this group or he believes
[1:49:36] this Doctrine or he believes that
[1:49:37] they're looking for a way to put you in
[1:49:39] a box so that they can figure you out
[1:49:41] and oh yeah okay I know what he's made
[1:49:43] out of and and they'll just set you off
[1:49:45] to this side or that sign and and the
[1:49:47] devil he'll tell you all kinds of things
[1:49:49] about yourself and he's got all kinds of
[1:49:51] ideas and opinions and hey if there's
[1:49:53] one thing I found about message folks
[1:49:54] we've got a lot of opinionated message
[1:49:56] folks you just ask one of them what they
[1:49:58] think about you know they'll be honest
[1:50:00] with you and tell you and maybe they
[1:50:02] have all kinds of opinions and thoughts
[1:50:04] and you should do this and you shouldn't
[1:50:06] do that and they can give you their list
[1:50:08] but I want to tell you this morning what
[1:50:10] God says about you
[1:50:15] Jeremiah 29 verse 11 for I know the
[1:50:18] thoughts that I think towards you saith
[1:50:20] the Lord
[1:50:22] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:50:25] give you an expected end
[1:50:27] God knows what your end is going to be
[1:50:29] amen
[1:50:30] amen he knows you know we look so
[1:50:39] Romans chapter 8 verse 29 for whom he
[1:50:42] did for no he also did predestinate
[1:50:46] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:50:48] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:50:50] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:50:52] predestinate then he also called in whom
[1:50:55] he called then he also Justified and
[1:50:58] whom he justified them he also glorified
[1:51:01] what shall we say then of these things
[1:51:04] if God before us who can be against us
[1:51:09] he that spare not his own son but
[1:51:11] delivered him up for us
[1:51:13] for us all how shall he not with him
[1:51:15] also freely give us all things who shall
[1:51:18] lay anything to the charge of God's
[1:51:20] elect it is God that justifieth oh I
[1:51:24] know him oh I can tell you a little bit
[1:51:26] about them
[1:51:27] I can post something on Facebook about
[1:51:29] them and I can I can tweet about them
[1:51:32] and I can do this and I can send you
[1:51:34] some text messages but who shall lay
[1:51:37] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:51:40] it's God who justify us
[1:51:43] right I was telling some of the brothers
[1:51:44] yesterday you know I you see some of
[1:51:46] these people they walk away from the
[1:51:48] message and they have all these
[1:51:49] complaints and they have their websites
[1:51:51] and they have their attacks and and but
[1:51:54] I want to see their testimony pages on
[1:51:56] their websites
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:52:05] where's the supernatural in their midst
[1:52:09] of page after page after page and topic
[1:52:12] after topic after topic and news
[1:52:15] clipping after news clipping and they
[1:52:17] try to associate all these things to
[1:52:18] brother random and Page after page but I
[1:52:21] haven't found their testimony sites
[1:52:32] and so they have all this and they want
[1:52:34] to take you back they want to take you
[1:52:36] back to the world oh we can be free I
[1:52:37] don't want that kind of freedom
[1:52:40] they're serving somebody they're just
[1:52:42] not serving the same one we're serving
[1:52:43] they say oh you're just following a man
[1:52:45] yes well at least the man I'm following
[1:52:47] was Vindicated the men you're following
[1:52:50] I wouldn't follow across the street
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:59] everybody's following somebody no that's
[1:53:02] right
[1:53:04] that's right some of these men I
[1:53:05] wouldn't follow across the street right
[1:53:07] let alone out of the message that's
[1:53:09] right some of these men I wouldn't
[1:53:11] believe them if they said good morning
[1:53:12] let alone if they said brother randoms
[1:53:14] of false prophets
[1:53:16] God Amen I've seen their lives I don't
[1:53:19] want what they have to produce
[1:53:21] I'm not interested
[1:53:24] and so I can look and I can see what
[1:53:27] Jesus did for me that's very plain I can
[1:53:30] see what he did to help me and all the
[1:53:33] sacrifices he made I can look at brother
[1:53:35] Brandon's life and I can look at the
[1:53:36] hours of family time and of leisure time
[1:53:40] and a vacation time that he sacrificed
[1:53:43] so that he could be traveling somewhere
[1:53:45] preaching the gospel and praying for the
[1:53:47] sick and laying this message in for us I
[1:53:49] see what he did for me but I asked what
[1:53:52] have they done for me right
[1:53:54] right
[1:53:54] that's right that's true that's right
[1:53:58] yes I had a man you'd know his name
[1:54:01] probably if I called him one of the Ring
[1:54:02] leaders of some of this stuff
[1:54:04] he kept trying to send me stuff I said
[1:54:06] listen you're just wasting your time
[1:54:08] right
[1:54:09] you're wasting your time you got here
[1:54:11] too late
[1:54:13] I've seen in action what this message
[1:54:15] produces
[1:54:16] [Applause]
[1:54:18] so some friends of a good brother uh at
[1:54:21] our church
[1:54:23] some friends of his went down to
[1:54:25] Indianapolis and spent their whole
[1:54:26] family vacation at a library trying to
[1:54:29] find death certificates
[1:54:32] to try to prove this guy wrong they were
[1:54:34] determined they were going to find 16
[1:54:35] death certificates at the Indianapolis
[1:54:37] Library there and they went through all
[1:54:40] kinds of records and all kinds of things
[1:54:42] and they wound up leaving the message
[1:54:44] over it
[1:54:47] they couldn't find enough evidence
[1:54:49] I found all the evidence I needed a long
[1:54:51] time ago
[1:54:56] and so they did find two death
[1:54:58] certificates though of men that died in
[1:55:01] the construction of that bridge
[1:55:03] and they gave it to this guy who they'd
[1:55:05] been trying to refute and joined up with
[1:55:07] him and started their own website
[1:55:09] and so he sent me a thing on Facebook
[1:55:11] back when I was still on Facebook
[1:55:13] and he said
[1:55:18] he said listen we found out that that
[1:55:19] Branham guy said
[1:55:21] you know he he was wrong it wasn't 16
[1:55:24] men it was two
[1:55:27] and so I just shot right back because
[1:55:28] you know me brother Samuel I can't keep
[1:55:30] my mouth shut
[1:55:32] I said oh that is so interesting
[1:55:36] I said last year you told me there was
[1:55:38] Zero now you say there's two
[1:55:42] I said you're an eighth of the way there
[1:55:44] buddy you just keep digging
[1:55:46] [Applause]
[1:55:52] I don't need their proof no sir amen
[1:55:55] I've seen the proof of the Resurrection
[1:55:59] amen
[1:56:01] the soldiers there could say hey they
[1:56:03] came and stole his body away
[1:56:05] but when his life came back in The
[1:56:07] Believer how did they explain that
[1:56:10] who was that that came back on the
[1:56:14] believer
[1:56:17] brother Chris Kathy and
[1:56:19] some of the brothers from here I think
[1:56:21] different ones are over in Israel right
[1:56:24] now going and seeing some of the things
[1:56:25] and I'm just trying to pray and say God
[1:56:27] help me not to Envy my brother's trip
[1:56:29] help me not to get that Spirit on me you
[1:56:31] know
[1:56:32] and so they've been texting us all kinds
[1:56:34] of pictures and videos of Rome and
[1:56:37] Israel and on the Sea of Galilee
[1:56:39] listening to the testimony on the sea on
[1:56:41] a boat like Jesus was on during that
[1:56:43] time and my they're just sending me
[1:56:46] stuff left and right so brother Samuel
[1:56:47] took me down to Charles Finney's tomb
[1:56:49] and I got a picture beside it and I said
[1:56:52] hey
[1:56:53] this two may not be empty
[1:56:55] but it's the best I could do on my
[1:56:57] salary
[1:57:00] but we have an empty tomb
[1:57:04] [Applause]
[1:57:07] amen I can take you to where Jesus was
[1:57:09] laid but he's not there
[1:57:12] it's an empty tomb
[1:57:16] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:57:18] God's elect
[1:57:21] it's God that justifieth
[1:57:24] who is he that condemneth
[1:57:27] it is Christ that died yea rather that
[1:57:29] is risen again
[1:57:31] who is even at the right hand of God who
[1:57:34] also maketh intercession for us
[1:57:36] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:57:38] Christ
[1:57:40] shall tribulation
[1:57:42] or distress
[1:57:44] or persecution
[1:57:46] or famine
[1:57:47] or nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:57:52] or critics or websites come on I'm not
[1:57:57] interested in going back to the Baptist
[1:57:58] Church I'm not interested in going back
[1:58:01] to the Pentecostal church I'm not
[1:58:04] interested in going back to the Catholic
[1:58:06] church I'm not interested in going back
[1:58:08] to the bar stool
[1:58:10] who shall separate us as it is written
[1:58:13] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:58:15] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:58:16] slaughter name in all these things we
[1:58:19] are more than conquerors
[1:58:21] through him that loved us
[1:58:24] for I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[1:58:26] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:58:28] powers nor thing things present
[1:58:33] nor things to come nor height nor depth
[1:58:35] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:58:37] separate us from the love of God which
[1:58:40] is in Christ Jesus
[1:58:43] our Lord let's stand together this
[1:58:45] morning
[1:58:55] nothing's going to separate us
[1:58:59] thank you Lord you say oh brother Nathan
[1:59:01] I feel so defeated
[1:59:05] I feel so discouraged
[1:59:08] well that's your thoughts
[1:59:10] well the devil came and he told me that
[1:59:12] I'm not worthy and that I'll never make
[1:59:14] it
[1:59:15] and that I'm a failure where that's the
[1:59:17] devil's thoughts
[1:59:19] God said we're more than conquerors
[1:59:23] God said his thoughts to us
[1:59:27] or to bring us to an expected end
[1:59:30] thoughts of peace and joy and mind what
[1:59:33] a blessed people we are
[1:59:36] spout our heads together
[1:59:42] Lord Jesus
[1:59:45] Lord I'm so thankful
[1:59:47] Lord that it wasn't left up to me
[1:59:51] Lord that the choosing was not in myself
[1:59:54] but that you did the choosing
[1:59:58] Lord if we had chosen ourselves Lord we
[2:00:00] would have no doubt wondered at some
[2:00:01] point oh God am I the right one did I
[2:00:04] make the right choice but Lord we didn't
[2:00:06] have any choice in it it was you
[2:00:08] who chose us before the foundation of
[2:00:10] the world we just came to a spot where
[2:00:13] we recognized
[2:00:14] that you had chose us
[2:00:18] as we said the other night brother
[2:00:19] Branham said they're in the church age
[2:00:21] book it takes a son sometimes a long
[2:00:23] time
[2:00:24] to recognize that he's a son
[2:00:26] but Lord we didn't you didn't take us
[2:00:29] from being a pig or a goat and make us
[2:00:33] into his sheep
[2:00:34] you didn't take us from being a chicken
[2:00:36] or a buzzard and make us an eagle Lord
[2:00:39] we were a child of God all along
[2:00:42] it just took us a while to recognize it
[2:00:45] yes
[2:00:47] so we're thankful for eyes to see and
[2:00:49] here's to hear
[2:00:50] we're thankful for your choosing
[2:00:53] as brother Adam said in one place if God
[2:00:56] without us having any choice in it
[2:00:59] could have brought our grandparents and
[2:01:01] our parents and all these together to
[2:01:03] bring us here
[2:01:05] without us having any choice in it
[2:01:08] then what can he do now that we can
[2:01:10] choose him as well
[2:01:13] what can he do now that we can agree
[2:01:15] with him in this choice
[2:01:18] help us Jesus when Satan comes and
[2:01:21] begins to lie to us begins to speak his
[2:01:24] thoughts over us Lord may we not take
[2:01:27] his word for it but may our mind go back
[2:01:29] to these quotes and scriptures that were
[2:01:31] read this weekend Lord may it give us
[2:01:34] courage and strength to recognize it's
[2:01:36] not me
[2:01:37] I don't have the ability I don't have
[2:01:39] the strength it's not me that's holding
[2:01:41] on it's him that's holding on to me
[2:01:45] oh how we love you Jesus we worship you
[2:01:49] we thank you
[2:01:51] for all that you do
[2:01:53] I pray if there's any here Lord that has
[2:01:55] hasn't recognized you in that way
[2:01:57] Lord that before they leave today
[2:01:59] they'll settle it here forever and say
[2:02:01] God I accept what you've done for me
[2:02:04] I accept it by faith
[2:02:07] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen

[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:12] amen
[2:26:15] hallelujah
[2:26:17] hallelujah how many can just say I have
[2:26:21] been refreshed
[2:26:25] have been refreshed
[2:26:28] you know I think my
[2:26:31] God has spoke so personally
[2:26:33] so personally
[2:26:35] and you know the thing within it is that
[2:26:39] we not only want to be able to see the
[2:26:41] grace of God
[2:26:42] for our own lives
[2:26:44] we must see the grace of God
[2:26:48] for every life
[2:26:52] when we can really see it to the debt
[2:26:54] that we need to be then we can look at
[2:26:55] it and look at one another
[2:26:57] and I thought God has just moved in such
[2:27:01] a special way
[2:27:02] and I'm glad you know God never
[2:27:05] nobody in the church here at least
[2:27:07] nobody should have a black and white
[2:27:09] striped shirt up and down walking around
[2:27:12] with black pants and a whistle
[2:27:15] [Music]
[2:27:20] if we're able to do that then we got too
[2:27:22] much time
[2:27:25] but the more we stand before the
[2:27:26] presence of God and in his throne we
[2:27:28] recognize the grace of God that we need
[2:27:30] in our own lives and it will take Grace
[2:27:33] all the way through
[2:27:35] amen and you know and that was so
[2:27:37] tremendous even how God spoke to us
[2:27:40] through those things of where the many
[2:27:42] of the times we can look at others
[2:27:44] before us but to realize nobody jumps to
[2:27:49] a certain spot in God
[2:27:51] you don't skip the rapture's not a jump
[2:27:55] the Rapture is not a skip the Bible said
[2:27:57] Enoch want
[2:28:00] with God
[2:28:02] walked with God
[2:28:04] and Enoch's name is when you look at his
[2:28:07] name dedicated
[2:28:10] dedicated what was he dedicated to he
[2:28:13] was dedicated to the Lord
[2:28:15] when the Lord said Enoch you're wrong in
[2:28:18] this area
[2:28:19] dedicated himself by repenting and
[2:28:22] saying yes Lord
[2:28:24] when God said Walk This Way yes Lord he
[2:28:28] was just dedicated to the voice of God
[2:28:31] now you might we don't have all of the
[2:28:32] records we don't have all of the things
[2:28:34] wrote out about Enoch's life that we do
[2:28:37] about Abraham's life
[2:28:39] we don't even have a lot of details like
[2:28:41] the Holy Spirit it brought out about
[2:28:42] Noah's life and the rest of them but God
[2:28:44] included what was needed to pick up for
[2:28:46] you and I and we can look back and
[2:28:49] realize that even with Enoch's life
[2:28:50] which is our time it was nothing but the
[2:28:53] grace of almighty God
[2:28:56] and that's why we're standing here today
[2:28:58] you know what's important is that we've
[2:29:00] received the grace of God that even as
[2:29:02] the word has been ministered God's grace
[2:29:05] begins to move in our life I'm just
[2:29:08] going to say it right here even as the
[2:29:09] spirit of the Lord made that statement
[2:29:11] here about turning points I believe
[2:29:13] there's been turning points in these
[2:29:15] meetings I believe that
[2:29:18] some things you may not even see right
[2:29:21] now but there's been turning points I
[2:29:23] believe there's needs that you've held
[2:29:25] before God they may not even be sitting
[2:29:27] in the building right here but they
[2:29:29] don't have to be said
[2:29:30] we've got a almighty God with an
[2:29:32] All-Seeing Eye he knows exactly where
[2:29:35] it's at
[2:29:36] amen he is faithful and true amen oh my
[2:29:42] how many have just appreciated the word
[2:29:45] of the Lord appreciate the friends of
[2:29:47] God
[2:29:50] my mama
[2:29:52] amen
[2:29:55] how many like that brother Nathan come
[2:29:57] back
[2:29:57] [Applause]
[2:30:03] okay third week in June
[2:30:08] [Music]
[2:30:09] amen no we have we have feasted on the
[2:30:13] word of God
[2:30:16] and take the word of God
[2:30:18] and you know what God has given us is
[2:30:21] just like what he told Samson Samson saw
[2:30:23] the Jawbone of an ass
[2:30:27] God
[2:30:31] the same word that is brought loosening
[2:30:33] and brought Liberty and brought
[2:30:34] encouragement that same word in
[2:30:36] Revelation is what you will use to stand
[2:30:39] and fight the devil
[2:30:42] maybe it'll be a moment from now or an
[2:30:44] hour from now but the same word it will
[2:30:46] back the devil off
[2:30:48] amen because what God Said is true
[2:30:52] how many know that to be true
[2:30:54] brother Graham said it like this he said
[2:30:55] when a minister gets done preaching he
[2:30:57] said Satan will come right at him he
[2:30:59] said on Monday morning and try to knock
[2:31:00] all the confidence out of him that the
[2:31:03] Holy Spirit instilled in him
[2:31:06] now I know not only just for ministers
[2:31:09] but he'll do it to everyone we're
[2:31:11] leaving out of these services and we've
[2:31:14] been refreshed I I have been spoken to
[2:31:17] if I'd have been the only one in the
[2:31:19] building for him to come and speak to I
[2:31:22] would have said I have had a Time
[2:31:26] I've shouted I've wanted to shout a
[2:31:29] whole lot more but I wanted to hear and
[2:31:32] then there's things that I have just sat

[2:33:44] Lord we are
[2:33:46] your workmanship
[2:33:50] we've not been crafted by the hands of
[2:33:52] man
[2:33:54] but it's your workmanship
[2:33:57] and you're bringing out
[2:34:00] bringing out all of that
[2:34:03] that you have placed within us
[2:34:07] every chunk that Michelangelo took off
[2:34:10] of that piece of marble
[2:34:13] that was something that was not
[2:34:15] in his mind
[2:34:18] and he worked
[2:34:21] to set free Moses who was in that chunk
[2:34:25] of marble
[2:34:27] and God you in your great Mercy
[2:34:32] have moved Lord to set us free
[2:34:35] from the mud and the gum and all the
[2:34:38] gunk as your Prophet said all the dirt
[2:34:40] that was packed in US
[2:34:42] Lord we're standing here as trophies
[2:34:46] of your
[2:34:50] not by words that we have done
[2:34:53] but by the grace of almighty God
[2:34:58] Lord this same message that you have
[2:35:00] delivered to us right here in the end
[2:35:02] time
[2:35:04] breathed Upon Us Lord and once again

[2:35:57] testimony you placed upon his heart to
[2:35:58] say
[2:36:00] when he was going away from you the more
[2:36:03] distant that voice became
[2:36:06] but Lord as he
[2:36:08] was turned to you and the more he began
