[8:08] for us. Lord,
[8:10] I remember that St. Paul was burdened
[8:13] down for the souls of his brethren
[8:16] because they did not recognize the
[8:18] mystery that was being unfolded in his
[8:20] day. For God, you had come down and
[8:24] walked in a body of flesh. You laid your
[8:27] life down, Lord, that we might have an
[8:29] atonement to draw closer to you.
[8:32] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord,
[8:34] that you have opened our eyes. as much
[8:36] of the world is still blind to that
[8:38] atonement. But God, you have blessed us
[8:40] in that way that we can come as the veil
[8:44] had been torn. We can step into the most
[8:46] holy place and have fellowship with God.

[8:53] have been laid before you. You know each
[8:56] and every request. You said if you will

[9:08] and every one of them. That Lord God
[9:10] that you will heal the sick and save the
[9:12] lost whatever the needs might be. Lord
[9:16] that you fulfill your word in that
[9:18] situation.

[9:22] that you have given.

[32:17] Oh, I will rest
[32:20] on
[32:22] his promise.
[32:24] Hallelujah.
[32:26] which is given
[32:28] [Music]
[32:29] to
[32:32] me. Jesus breaks. Jesus breaks
[32:38] every
[32:40] fet.
[32:44] Jesus breaks
[32:47] every
[32:49] f.
[32:52] Oh Jesus breaks.
[32:56] every
[32:58] feed
[33:01] and he sets
[33:05] me
[33:07] free.
[33:09] Do that part again. I will sing. I will
[33:11] sing. Hallelujah.
[33:14] Hallelujah.
[33:15] [Music]
[33:19] Oh, I will sing.
[33:22] [Music]
[33:24] Halleluah.
[33:28] Oh, I will shout
[33:33] halleluah
[33:38] for
[33:39] he set
[33:42] me
[33:44] free.
[33:50] Oh, once like a bird in prison I dwell.
[33:57] No freedom from my sorrow I fell.
[34:03] Then Jesus came and listened to me.
[34:09] Glory to God. He set me free.
[34:14] He set me free. Yes. He set me free.
[34:20] free for he broke the bonds of rising.
[34:26] Yes, I glory bound my Jesus. You see,
[34:33] glory to God. He set me free.
[34:41] Am climbing higher each day.
[34:46] Darkness of night has drifted away as my
[34:53] feet are planted on higher ground. And
[34:58] glory to God, I'm homeward bound. Oh, he
[35:05] set me free. Yes, he set me. Thank you,
[35:09] Lord. Yes, he broke the bonds of prison
[35:15] for me. Oh, and I'm glorify
[35:19] my Jesus to see.
[35:23] Glory to God, he said.
[35:27] Let's sing that last verse one more
[35:29] time. Now I am climbing
[35:33] higher each day, and darkness of night
[35:39] has drifted away. For my feet are
[35:44] planted
[35:45] on higher ground and glory to God. I'm
[35:52] over
[35:55] he set me free. Yes. He set me free.
[36:00] Yes. And he broke the bonds of prison.
[36:06] Well, I glorify
[36:09] my Jesus to sing.
[36:13] Glory to God. He said
[36:19] goodbye to goodbye to sin and things
[36:24] that come.
[36:26] Oh, not of this world shall turn me
[36:31] around. And daily I'm working. Yes. And
[36:35] I'm praying to you. And glory to God.
[36:41] I'm going through. Yes. He set me free.
[36:47] Yes. He set me free. Well, he broke the
[36:52] bonds of risen.
[36:56] Yes. And I'm glory now. My Jesus.
[37:02] Oh, glory to God. He set me free.
[37:09] [Music]
[37:12] Hallelujah.
[37:14] Praise the Lord. Aren't you thankful to
[37:16] be free?
[37:18] Amen. There's nothing like real freedom
[37:22] that God brings to a life. You know, you
[37:25] can we come in we come in here and you
[37:28] you know, we experience the presence of
[37:29] the Lord and there's a freedom. There's
[37:31] things that are actually lift. But, you
[37:33] know, I'm thankful that it's much deeper
[37:35] than just coming into a place and
[37:37] burdens lift. I'm grateful that that is
[37:39] not something we have to just come here
[37:41] to have, but it's an abiding presence
[37:44] down in the depths of our soul. Because
[37:45] the real the real victory and the real
[37:47] freedom is the deliverance from
[37:49] ourselves. And then that freedom, it
[37:51] just keeps ringing out through our
[37:53] lives. It gives us authority again and
[37:55] again and again. I'm so grateful for
[37:57] that real freedom. Aren't you? Amen.
[37:59] That's what Calvary, that's what the
[38:01] blood was shed for and that the Holy
[38:03] Spirit was sent back that we could have
[38:04] that complete freedom in our lives.
[38:07] Amen. Glory be to God. Amen. So good to
[38:11] be together tonight. And I'm not going
[38:13] to um prolong that, Brother Trevor. This
[38:16] was a kind of un unexpected, but it was
[38:19] a good surprise. And so, um, there were
[38:22] some things that he had to do up here,
[38:24] uh, today. And, um, so we're just
[38:27] thankful that he and Sister Ana May were
[38:29] able to be here with us. And we so
[38:31] appreciate Brother Trevor, I know he's
[38:33] not only loved here, he's also loved
[38:35] there uh, with brother Nathaniel and the
[38:37] saints. And we have different ones here
[38:39] tonight. And man, it's just it's good to
[38:41] be in the presence of God with brothers
[38:44] and sisters of Light, Freshest Faith.
[38:45] And my, let's just get let's just get
[38:48] into the water tonight. invite the Lord
[38:51] just to come down in a very special way
[38:53] just to speak to our hearts. And I
[38:55] believe God has something special. God
[38:56] never calls a meeting without ever
[38:59] having something special to say to us.
[39:02] Amen. You believe that? Amen. Amen.
[39:04] We're witnesses of that. Amen. So, we're
[39:06] just going to invite brother Trevor to
[39:08] go ahead and make his way forward and
[39:10] maybe we'll just stand, change positions
[39:12] at this time. You have a song on your
[39:14] heart.
[39:17] I love you, Lord,
[39:22] and I lift
[39:26] my
[39:29] voice
[39:32] to worship
[39:38] you,
[39:40] oh my soul.
[39:44] [Music]
[39:46] Take your
[39:50] take your
[39:53] king
[39:58] in
[40:00] what
[40:02] you hear.
[40:07] May be a sweet,
[40:12] sweet
[40:14] sound
[40:16] in your rear.
[40:21] [Music]
[40:26] I love
[40:29] you, Lord.
[40:31] Hallelujah.
[40:34] And
[40:35] I live
[40:38] my voice
[40:44] to worship
[40:47] [Music]
[40:49] you.
[40:52] Oh my soul
[40:57] rejoice.
[41:01] Oh, take joy. Oh yes, Lord. He worshiped
[41:07] tonight
[41:09] in
[41:11] what
[41:13] you
[41:14] [Music]
[41:19] me.
[41:22] [Music]
[41:33] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[41:35] Amen. Hallelujah. I greet you tonight in
[41:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. As
[41:40] you might know, I will state the
[41:43] obvious.
[41:45] It's really good to be here
[41:48] and we love you and uh we're just we're
[41:50] happy to be here. As brother Samuel
[41:52] said, we had some things we were uh
[41:54] doing up in this in this area and uh so
[41:57] we just kind of rolled in just a little
[41:59] bit ago, but we're we're happy to be
[42:01] here. So, as you have your Bibles and
[42:03] you're standing, turn to Psalms chapter
[42:04] 127.
[42:13] Yeah, that'd be great.
[42:25] Psalm chapter
[42:27] 127
[42:29] 127:es 3 to5 Lo children our inheritage
[42:35] of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is
[42:40] his reward.
[42:42] Amen.
[42:44] How many feel that way?
[42:47] Glory to God.
[42:50] Sometimes it feels more of a reward than
[42:52] others,
[42:54] but it's truth. Children are inherited
[42:57] of the Lord. The fruit of the womb is
[43:00] his reward. As arrows in the hand of a
[43:04] mighty man, so are the children of the
[43:08] youth. Happy is the man that hath his
[43:11] quiver full of them. They shall not be
[43:13] ashamed, but they shall speak with the
[43:16] enemies in the gate. Let's just go to
[43:20] the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father,
[43:21] Lord, as we just look to the scripture,
[43:23] Lord, and um it's a midweek service,
[43:26] Lord, and many have come from work and
[43:28] we've come from various places, Lord
[43:30] Jesus, and tried to to bring ourselves,
[43:33] Lord, just into the into the atmosphere
[43:35] of worship, Lord God, and into the house
[43:37] of God that we could hear from you,
[43:39] Lord, that you would speak to our
[43:41] hearts, Lord God, that we could um for
[43:43] this for these few moments, Lord, push
[43:45] the the world out and just hear from you
[43:48] and let let your Holy Spirit just speak
[43:51] Lord God. Anoint me to speak and the
[43:53] people to hear Lord and may you have
[43:55] your way. We ask it in the name of the
[43:57] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[44:00] Amen. So you may be seated.
[44:05] So perhaps maybe something a little
[44:07] different than um I don't know if I have
[44:10] a normal especially here. I I've I've
[44:11] preached a lot of different a lot of
[44:13] different sermons here but but um maybe
[44:17] this is just something a little
[44:18] different. Um, but something that I
[44:21] haven't been able to get away from. This
[44:22] is a um something I brought to our
[44:25] church uh a couple months ago and then
[44:28] just it was just felt like kind of a
[44:30] one-off sermon and then Okay. And then I
[44:34] just about a month ago it was just like
[44:37] I don't even remember what I said. I
[44:39] need to go back and listen to that and
[44:40] look at those notes. And it just
[44:41] wouldn't leave me until just uh this
[44:44] week. I just I was like, "Okay, I've
[44:46] just got to go back and look at this."
[44:47] And so I just um just felt like perhaps
[44:50] that's the leading of the Lord for us
[44:52] and that that we could look at these
[44:53] things. So So this is kind of a
[44:55] parenting
[44:57] I will try not to do that again. This is
[44:59] kind of a parenting um service. So um
[45:03] but hopefully hopefully even if wherever
[45:05] you're at in life, you will be able to
[45:07] still make applications to um you know
[45:10] things of the Lord in your life and in
[45:12] your walk. And if you are yet to have
[45:15] children um maybe this would be good
[45:16] advice for you so you could listen up
[45:18] and then um Amen. Okay. And then um you
[45:24] know and so is it I I just hope this is
[45:26] okay. So um you know that that we could
[45:28] look at that. So raising children who
[45:30] are unashamed and that could be your
[45:33] title for the internet if you wanted it.
[45:34] Um because I have three other four other
[45:37] titles that we could use if we wanted to
[45:39] because they were all kind of what I was
[45:40] trying to say. teaching our children a
[45:42] posture of courage could have been
[45:45] another title. Um or raising courageous
[45:50] Christlike children in a culture of
[45:53] anxiety, but there was too many C's for
[45:55] that one. But that's that's kind of what
[45:57] we're what we're trying to think about
[45:59] is to recognize that that there's a that
[46:02] that truly we we we are living in an
[46:05] anxious generation that that where where
[46:07] we're at and that there there are more
[46:09] people on, you know, going to therapy
[46:11] and all kinds of things. There are more
[46:13] people suffering with anxiousness and
[46:15] depression and and and listlessness in
[46:18] their life, not knowing what their
[46:19] purpose is or where they're going. and
[46:20] they're struggling with what, you know,
[46:22] why am I even here and what am I even
[46:24] doing and and all kinds of things and
[46:26] I'm not good enough or am I good enough
[46:28] or all of these things that we have and
[46:30] so but but but we want to bring out that
[46:33] that that if there's a thing of anxiety
[46:36] that means there's a that there's a
[46:37] there's some fear that's there. And so
[46:39] what we want to do is to begin to to
[46:42] bring up our children and even even our
[46:45] own lives. If we, you know, if you don't
[46:47] have children or or or you're past that
[46:49] stage at this point, well, perhaps think
[46:50] of your own life like how am I
[46:52] structuring how am I parenting my own
[46:54] heart, you know, um and and to bring it,
[46:58] you know, and to bring it into a posture
[47:00] of courage or or a courage, you know, to
[47:03] be courageous and Christlike throughout
[47:06] the things that that I'm dealing with in
[47:09] my own life. And so um so so we asked
[47:13] the question, what does it mean to be
[47:15] Christlike? And I I brought this out as
[47:17] a youth Bible study, um for our our well
[47:20] we have two groups, you know, we have
[47:21] our our older group and our younger
[47:23] group, you know, and and we separate it
[47:25] 10 to 15 and then and then um well 10 to
[47:28] 14 and then 15 and up is how we have
[47:30] things separated. And but we talked
[47:32] about the same things, you know, and so
[47:33] for the younger group, we use the medium
[47:35] of pizza and what does it take to make a
[47:37] good pizza? And you know, you can throw
[47:40] all kinds of things on a whiteboard and
[47:41] you know, it might be it's pepperoni and
[47:43] maybe it's pineapple and you know, now
[47:45] everybody hates me and you know, but but
[47:48] you know, but but we can just start to
[47:50] just start to think about like what does
[47:52] it mean, you know, what does it mean to
[47:54] be good at this thing? Like what does it
[47:55] mean to be Christlike? And of course, if
[47:58] you ask young people, you know, um what
[48:00] does it mean to be Christlike? You know,
[48:02] the first answer you're going to get as
[48:04] any Sunday school teacher would be it's
[48:06] like to be like God.
[48:10] We had to get that one out of the way.
[48:11] Absolutely. Yes. That is what that
[48:13] means. Can we have more information? And
[48:16] then then we begin to dive into all of
[48:18] the right wrong answers and um you know
[48:21] like um well you know to to be kind and
[48:25] to be loving and to be you know uh to
[48:28] dress right and to act right. I mean all
[48:30] of these things. Amen. That's that's all
[48:33] these are all the right wrong answers.
[48:35] Um, you know, they're they're they're
[48:37] good. You should do these things and and
[48:39] these are attributes of being
[48:41] Christlike, but what does it mean to be
[48:45] Christlike? And and so we begin to dive
[48:47] into these things and and and just
[48:49] really try to draw out the heart of the
[48:52] issue. And and when it all comes down,
[48:55] if we distilled, you know, an hour of a
[48:57] youth talk down into, you know, where
[48:58] where we really came down to is is to
[49:01] distill it down to like, well, what was
[49:03] it actually that that Christ, you know,
[49:05] what was the essence or the heart of the
[49:08] of all of it, of all of his actions and
[49:10] all of the things that we could emulate
[49:12] that he did in his life? What was the
[49:14] heart of those things? And that was a
[49:16] heart of love that made a choice to go
[49:21] to a cross and die for you because of
[49:24] love. And so it was his choice to do
[49:29] that that was his his most let's say
[49:31] maybe his most defining characteristic
[49:35] was that because he loved he chose.
[49:41] Amen. Okay. So, so then to be Christlike
[49:45] would mean to help little old ladies
[49:47] across the street. No. Well, yes, but
[49:49] no. No. Then, but to be Christlike would
[49:52] would to to to embody what it meant to
[49:55] be exactly what Christ was here on this
[49:57] earth would then to understand that kind
[50:00] of love and say, you know what, that
[50:03] that that that take that that brings up
[50:06] love in my own heart reciprocating to
[50:08] his love. And so because of that, I will
[50:12] choose then as he chose to sacrifice
[50:15] because of his love, I'm going to choose
[50:17] to sacrifice to return his love to him.
[50:22] And so the choice to sacrifice all that
[50:24] I am for his glory is what it means to
[50:28] be Christlike. And and then it and then
[50:31] it throws away, you know, if it's for
[50:33] his glory, then it throws away all the
[50:35] selfishness.
[50:40] That's good preacher. All right.
[50:43] So, so, so then
[50:47] we're choosing
[50:50] and that's what it means to be
[50:51] Christlike is to choose him. So, how
[50:56] many want to be Christlike?
[50:59] Amen. Okay. You all want to help little
[51:01] old ladies across the street. You are
[51:02] the little old lady that wants help
[51:04] across the street. All of these things.
[51:05] Okay. No. No. It's so so so that the
[51:08] love in our heart we could we could then
[51:10] choose to to to be with him and choose
[51:14] to lay ourselves down that we could be
[51:16] with him and and this is what it is to
[51:18] be Christlike. So so we all want to be
[51:21] Christlike then and then as parents then
[51:24] I would ask this obvious question then
[51:27] do you want to raise Christlike
[51:29] children?
[51:31] It's like, well, yes, that's of course
[51:35] that's our goal, right? And so, okay,
[51:38] but then we need to begin to think about
[51:40] what our definition of Christlike. If
[51:43] you want to be able to raise Christlike
[51:46] children, it's like, hey, man, why don't
[51:50] you choose Jesus? Cuz that's what it
[51:53] means to be Christlike. I'm not giving
[51:56] you an option. I'm not giving you a
[51:58] choice. You have to
[52:04] So, how many
[52:07] how many how many want to raise
[52:08] Christlike children?
[52:11] And so, then we've like, oh, well, this
[52:14] is almost redefining sometimes. We have
[52:17] to begin to think about, well, what
[52:19] okay, so then, okay, I want to I I want
[52:22] to raise Christlike children, but now I
[52:24] have to begin to ask another question.
[52:26] And it's like then then if to be Christ
[52:28] if I want to raise Christlike children
[52:30] or children that have the choice because
[52:34] of love to sacrifice their lives for
[52:37] him, then I'm going to need to be able
[52:40] to give them a choice. I'm going to need
[52:43] to be able to to h to strengthen their
[52:48] ability to make good and correct
[52:51] choices. And so if I then begin to limit
[52:55] the amount of choices they are making in
[52:59] their lives, they will not have the
[53:02] ability or the strength to make the the
[53:05] the most amazing and most you know even
[53:08] difficult but most monumental choice
[53:14] because I have I have removed all
[53:16] ability for choice from their life
[53:19] except for this one. and that I expect
[53:21] them to make the one choice I allow them
[53:24] to make correctly.
[53:28] That is a tall order,
[53:33] right?
[53:34] And so, so, you know, so we begin to
[53:37] think about this. And so, as we were
[53:40] discussing these things with with our
[53:42] young people and, you know, because
[53:45] because it it is it has to be about that
[53:47] choice because we I begin I brought up
[53:50] this this whole idea, this kind of
[53:52] thought of of you you're familiar with
[53:55] um uh what Brother Brandham says about
[53:57] sister Hattie, right? And she she said,
[54:00] "That's nothing but the truth, brother
[54:02] Brennham. And the spirit of the Lord
[54:03] came in and and God spoke to brother
[54:05] Brennham and said, "Ask her what, you
[54:07] know, to say whatever she wants and it
[54:08] and it'll be given to her." And and so
[54:11] brother Brennham tells sister Heddy this
[54:12] and you can ask your sister needs
[54:14] healing or you know you could you need
[54:17] money and all all of these things and
[54:19] she asks, you know what she asks for?
[54:20] She asks for the salvation of her
[54:21] children. And these these guys that were
[54:24] laughing, these two these two young
[54:25] brothers that were laughing before, now
[54:28] through the course of that evening, end
[54:30] up falling over their mother's lap and
[54:33] coming to repentance.
[54:36] Amen. So,
[54:40] did they did they get to choose?
[54:44] And then everybody's head was like
[54:48] and everybody's head exploded, right?
[54:50] because it's like, "Wait a second, how
[54:52] does that work then?" And so, but you
[54:54] know, and so, but but but God did not
[54:56] take away their free moral agency, but
[54:59] but God knew I I would say it like this
[55:01] that God God knew that their heart
[55:04] already had a posture of coming to him
[55:07] and it just hadn't been that like that
[55:09] day hadn't come to fruition yet. But
[55:12] because of what was spoken, an
[55:15] atmosphere came into that room that took
[55:18] the posture of their heart and and and
[55:21] maybe accelerated where they were always
[55:24] going to be. Because I would ask you
[55:26] this day, hallelujah. And may God come
[55:29] and do the same thing again tonight for
[55:31] everyone here that it would accelerate
[55:34] their decision to be with him.
[55:37] Amen.
[55:39] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes sir.
[55:43] But so we but we as we finish this idea
[55:46] and this thought though because if I
[55:49] were to tell you like like let's just
[55:51] you know this is I don't believe this is
[55:53] what happened. But if God were to have
[55:56] removed that choice from to to serve him
[55:59] and because of the spoken word they were
[56:02] made to serve him would you consider
[56:04] them Christians?
[56:09] No we wouldn't. Why? because they
[56:11] actually aren't Christlike
[56:14] because Christ chose.
[56:17] So good. Christ chose. And so God isn't
[56:20] removing choice and he never will remove
[56:23] choice because he would be removing your
[56:25] ability to be like him. That is so good.
[56:29] That's good. Yes sir. That's good. So it
[56:32] has to be choice. It has to be that you
[56:36] would choose. But that if we want to
[56:38] raise Christlike children, we're then
[56:41] going to have to come and take a step
[56:43] back and begin to give them the ability
[56:47] to choose, which means they're going to
[56:49] have to come into the gray zone.
[56:54] Was Did you all hear that ominous music?
[56:57] Just I said the gray zone. I was like
[57:03] because because this is what's going to
[57:05] happen with young people, right? Like I
[57:07] I always use this as an example, you
[57:09] know, you have the 10 to 12, 13s, you
[57:12] know, um uh and and maybe maybe they
[57:14] start coming out of it at 14, but they
[57:16] have, you know, there is no gray zone if
[57:18] you're 10,
[57:20] you know, it's black and white, man.
[57:23] It's like, you know, would would you
[57:25] consider stealing a cookie from the
[57:26] cookie jar? Oh my.
[57:28] Who would do that, brother Trevor? That
[57:31] would be so wrong. Like, of course, I
[57:34] would. I'm a good Christian young man or
[57:37] young lady. I would never I would never
[57:39] do such a thing. It's like, do you think
[57:40] you'll ever, you know, I mean, let's
[57:42] just, you know, it's 2025. We have
[57:43] relationship. Like, do you think you'd
[57:44] ever want to kiss a boy or, you know,
[57:46] girls kiss, you know, or boys kiss a
[57:48] girl? And it's like, oh my goodness. So,
[57:50] I mean, number one, that's disgusting.
[57:52] And then number two, like that would be
[57:55] that's that's only for married people.
[57:57] And I would never want to do that.
[58:00] Uhhuh. And that's because you're 10, you
[58:03] know, and you just, you know, as a youth
[58:04] leader, you just you're just like, well,
[58:06] praise God, that's so wonderful.
[58:10] You're not lying. You truly believe it.
[58:12] But we'll come and we'll talk about this
[58:14] again in six years. But trust me, you
[58:16] know, or eight or something like that
[58:17] because because then because then, you
[58:20] know, because as their brains develop,
[58:22] you know, and and we could, you know, we
[58:24] could say there well, if you're
[58:25] interested in these kinds of things, you
[58:26] know, the amigdala has already, you
[58:28] know, now it's formed and it's holding
[58:29] data and all of these things, but the
[58:30] prefrontal cortex, man, that is still
[58:34] developing and it won't finish until 25.
[58:39] That's right. You know, so you arrived,
[58:41] right? Like you're there, right? Thank
[58:42] you, K. Good job. This fully developed
[58:45] brain.
[58:47] But that decision maker and that, you
[58:49] know, and it it's it's just starting to
[58:51] develop. And then now it started
[58:52] starting to produce these brain
[58:54] chemicals and and you know, things are
[58:56] just going the circuitry is weird,
[59:00] you know, and they're that now that and
[59:02] now like they're having like, hey,
[59:04] kissing a boy or kissing a girl isn't
[59:06] gross anymore. Suddenly it's actually
[59:08] wow, that would be seems like that might
[59:10] be nice. And then, you know, so now
[59:12] that's different in the decision matrix.
[59:14] And now maybe it's not black and white
[59:16] anymore. Now there's now there's varying
[59:18] stages of gray, right? And there's, you
[59:20] know, uh I mean, well, I mean, you know,
[59:25] how pretty is she? And you know what's
[59:27] the So there's an 80% likelihood we
[59:30] might get married anyway.
[59:33] So then it'd probably be okay. No.
[59:37] No.
[59:41] But if they but I'm just telling you if
[59:44] they never get in the gray zone they can
[59:46] never actually be Christlike
[59:51] though because even Jesus was in the
[59:53] gray zone. Even Jesus was tempted in all
[59:56] points like as we are yet without sin.
[59:59] So Jesus had to go through this and
[1:00:02] chose these things for you. And so so so
[1:00:05] so your young people are going to
[1:00:07] they're coming into the gray zone. Maybe
[1:00:10] they're already there, you know, and and
[1:00:12] and and now you you have to deal with
[1:00:16] that. But you want you want to raise
[1:00:18] Christlike children. Then now what
[1:00:21] you're try what what what your idea to
[1:00:23] what you would want to be doing is now
[1:00:26] coming alongside them and shephering
[1:00:28] through them through these decisions.
[1:00:32] All right. Here's
[1:00:35] what begins to happen.
[1:00:39] They begin to notice that there are
[1:00:41] other styles of music out there.
[1:00:46] And of course, we don't allow them the
[1:00:48] choice. We threaten them on pain of
[1:00:51] death and you know and the rack and
[1:00:56] scorpion bites that if you ever were to
[1:01:00] to listen to anything other than just
[1:01:02] good gospel music you know except for is
[1:01:06] are are we not removing choice then
[1:01:10] right I mean at some point in time if
[1:01:12] you threaten them with death they don't
[1:01:13] have the choice anymore is that is that
[1:01:16] is that fair like maybe everything short
[1:01:18] of death is fine you know, but I don't
[1:01:20] know. Like, it's just going to depend on
[1:01:22] the situation, right? And and I'm not
[1:01:24] just saying, hey, let's just make it a
[1:01:25] free-for-all, but you have to begin to
[1:01:27] understand they are going to need to
[1:01:29] begin to make choices in their lives.
[1:01:34] And I would tell you that even like it's
[1:01:36] just crazy, you know, because I was I
[1:01:37] was telling uh my wife as we were
[1:01:39] driving up here. It's like, you know,
[1:01:41] there's a sermon that was very very
[1:01:43] popular and pro maybe people still are
[1:01:45] listening to it that brother Donnie
[1:01:46] Reagan preached like in the '9s called
[1:01:49] choices we make. Right. See, right? 30
[1:01:54] years ago,
[1:01:56] he preached this. Right.
[1:02:00] No one listens to that anymore because
[1:02:03] we just like them to make choices now.
[1:02:05] Like we, you know, it's like make the
[1:02:07] right choices. It's like I would
[1:02:08] actually just like some young people to
[1:02:10] choose something. Anything. Just make a
[1:02:13] ch like I'm not worried about all the
[1:02:15] choices. Like there's so many choices.
[1:02:17] You want to make sure you make the right
[1:02:18] ones. I'm like, would you make a choice
[1:02:20] and we'll go from there?
[1:02:23] Because again, because what are we
[1:02:25] talking about? There's a generation of
[1:02:27] anxiety that has crept in and and we'll
[1:02:30] talk about the wise and some of that if
[1:02:31] we can get to all of that. But but to
[1:02:33] where they're locked in anxiety and even
[1:02:36] un the unable to make a choice and if
[1:02:40] they cannot make a choice then the devil
[1:02:43] has come in at a very low level and
[1:02:46] removed their ability to even ever
[1:02:48] become Christlike. Wow.
[1:02:52] So then we so then we can and we have to
[1:02:56] understand where we are and what is
[1:02:57] happening so that when we come along
[1:03:00] we're not you know inflicting more
[1:03:02] damage on ability to make choices but
[1:03:05] helping and and and and helping them to
[1:03:08] understand that as they make choices we
[1:03:10] are there for them as they come into
[1:03:12] this gray zone. Yes, you're going to
[1:03:15] make some wrong.
[1:03:19] But dad will be here, but mom will be
[1:03:22] here. There may be some punishments, but
[1:03:25] you probably won't die.
[1:03:31] Right. And so and so we've got to end up
[1:03:34] becoming to to begin to recognize that
[1:03:37] hey, you know, when when when those of
[1:03:40] us that were listening to brother Donnie
[1:03:41] Reagan's choices we make sermon, we were
[1:03:44] sitting there going through our own
[1:03:45] lives, some of us making really dumb
[1:03:48] decisions, some of us making really bad
[1:03:51] decisions. But at the end of the day, it
[1:03:54] wasn't about did we listen to the wrong
[1:03:56] music some? Did we have some of the
[1:03:59] wrong relationships? Did we do some of
[1:04:02] the wrong things at the end of the day?
[1:04:05] What it came down to was were we
[1:04:07] Christlike or not? Did we come to a
[1:04:10] place where we chose him and to love him
[1:04:13] and to serve him with all that we were?
[1:04:16] That is what that is the thing that
[1:04:19] mattered. And Christ had died for every
[1:04:23] other wrong choice that you could make.
[1:04:27] Hallelujah. Yes. And so, so it's it's
[1:04:30] hypocritical then for us as parents
[1:04:32] knowing we were listening to that sermon
[1:04:34] 30 years ago making dumb choices to come
[1:04:37] along and say, "Well, if you ever make a
[1:04:39] bad choice,
[1:04:41] buddy, it's curtains for you, man."
[1:04:47] I mean, I get it as parents, you know,
[1:04:49] like. So, well, anyway. So, then so then
[1:04:54] why that just leads us into what we're
[1:04:56] talking about. Praise the Lord. Why do
[1:04:58] we parent then? What is the point of it?
[1:05:00] What what what why are we what are we
[1:05:03] doing when we parent? And so I came up
[1:05:05] with some really bad reasons for
[1:05:06] parenting in 2025.
[1:05:09] Um but are often very common. It makes
[1:05:11] me good look good on the gram. You know
[1:05:14] how it is. You have children. You have
[1:05:16] an aesthetic that you you know you want
[1:05:18] to present. And so you have your
[1:05:20] 2-year-old and your you know or your
[1:05:21] three-year-old and your one-year-old and
[1:05:23] you know you may maybe you choose
[1:05:25] pastels. Maybe that's your thing and
[1:05:26] linens and you know and so you use the
[1:05:29] filters that you know do everything like
[1:05:32] that. Maybe you like more of the crisp,
[1:05:34] bold, clear colors and so you're you
[1:05:35] know you like the higher resolution and
[1:05:37] so you use those filters and you know
[1:05:39] and every and it's just you know it's
[1:05:41] Sunday morning you know um you know what
[1:05:43] is it you know the G get ready with me
[1:05:46] GR YM right you know you've got your grm
[1:05:49] videos get ready with me on Sunday
[1:05:51] morning and you the little kids coming
[1:05:53] through you know and they're all you
[1:05:55] know dressed the way they're supposed to
[1:05:57] be dressed and there's nothing wrong
[1:05:58] with any of this okay it was just right
[1:06:00] but it's if that's Like you can do that.
[1:06:03] That's fine. But if that's your reason,
[1:06:05] like if you search your heart, like if
[1:06:06] that's your reason for parenting is
[1:06:08] because these children make my brand
[1:06:10] look good and I look like this amazing
[1:06:12] mother and I have this look that
[1:06:14] everybody oh they look at me and they
[1:06:15] go, "Oh my goodness." like I wish I was
[1:06:18] her and you know and they don't see like
[1:06:23] like all the behind the scenes footage
[1:06:26] from that get ready with me you know
[1:06:30] and how terrible that was you know but
[1:06:33] that's like oh I wish I was her like oh
[1:06:35] my goodness okay so you know makes me
[1:06:36] look good on the gram really bad reason
[1:06:38] for parenting not I'm not saying it's
[1:06:41] bad to do but it's if if that's your
[1:06:43] reason like you should be you should be
[1:06:45] praying because I don't think you're
[1:06:47] going to find that in scripture
[1:06:48] anywhere. Um because well, praise God,
[1:06:51] that's what we're supposed to do.
[1:06:54] We're we're message believers. We're
[1:06:56] Christians. We have children.
[1:06:59] So, we parent them.
[1:07:04] Good. That's a wrong right answer. I
[1:07:07] don't know what that is, but like like
[1:07:08] there's some nuance there. Like good.
[1:07:10] Like yes, a believer should be a good
[1:07:12] parent and they should do the right
[1:07:14] things and they you know yes that's
[1:07:16] that's fair but is like really is that
[1:07:18] the is that it? It's just like because
[1:07:19] I'm supposed to. So I'm going to try to
[1:07:22] be good at parenting because I'm
[1:07:24] supposed to. I was like look man I mean
[1:07:27] the only reason we tried to do as good
[1:07:28] as we did as we were supposed to. I
[1:07:33] actually kind of annoying but to be a
[1:07:35] good Christian I had to try to do a good
[1:07:36] job with you. So that's what we did.
[1:07:41] That's probably not a good reason,
[1:07:42] right? This is No, this is And then, you
[1:07:45] know, we're parents because that's the
[1:07:46] natural product of being married. Like,
[1:07:48] we were married and kids came
[1:07:52] and so I guess we should feed them.
[1:07:56] They're here after all. So, that's also
[1:08:00] probably not a bad, you know, not a good
[1:08:03] reason for parenting, right? Should
[1:08:06] there be more? Like back to our opening
[1:08:08] scripture that children are a heritage
[1:08:10] from the Lord. They're his his reward,
[1:08:15] right? And so well, how do we parent
[1:08:18] with these reasons then? Um the maximum
[1:08:21] impact of our image, maximum impact of
[1:08:24] them doing what they are supposed to do
[1:08:27] or the maximum impact of removing the
[1:08:29] inconvenience. And so if you were if
[1:08:31] you're parenting and the reason you have
[1:08:33] kids is so that it looks good on the
[1:08:34] gram, then the the your style of
[1:08:37] parenting and what you do as parenting
[1:08:38] is to maximize how good it makes you
[1:08:40] look. If you are just trying to look
[1:08:42] like a perfectly good Christian and
[1:08:44] message believer and and a a fine uh
[1:08:47] believer's spoken word tabernacle,
[1:08:51] you're going to, you know, you're going
[1:08:52] to make sure they have a tie or a bow
[1:08:53] tie on and when they come in through the
[1:08:55] church doors and you know, all of those
[1:08:57] things, you know, if if you just ended
[1:08:59] up having children and you just didn't
[1:09:01] weren't even planning on any of that,
[1:09:03] but you got married and here they came
[1:09:05] and so well then then you're going to
[1:09:07] how you do it is going to be removing
[1:09:09] the inconvenience as best as you
[1:09:11] possibly can. They're crying. Okay, feed
[1:09:14] them. Like, that's it's because, right,
[1:09:16] or all kinds of other reasons that are
[1:09:18] just totally bad. And I and I would say
[1:09:22] like I would hope that none of us are
[1:09:24] doing any of these things in totality,
[1:09:27] but do they impact us? Are we afflicted
[1:09:31] or impacted by that in some ways? I
[1:09:34] think so that that happens to us. And
[1:09:36] and again, this is something where we
[1:09:38] search our hearts and go, well, is this,
[1:09:40] you know, is this something I should I
[1:09:42] should be be in prayer about? So, so
[1:09:44] then if all of those are bad reasons, um
[1:09:47] we'll come back next week. No. Um we
[1:09:49] have plenty of time. So, we should
[1:09:51] actually perhaps talk about the like,
[1:09:53] well, is there really good reasons for
[1:09:55] parenting? And so, um yes, there are. Um
[1:10:00] and we're going to we're going to listen
[1:10:01] to this quote here in in just a moment.
[1:10:03] Um it I've got a seven minute uh
[1:10:06] quotation from um from questions and
[1:10:08] answers here um prepared. But I just to
[1:10:10] just to talk through something really
[1:10:11] quick. Brother uh Brandham says she
[1:10:13] needs a buddy and you're the one to be
[1:10:16] her buddy. You and I were her parents.
[1:10:19] And in my mind, I I would call this the
[1:10:21] MCD principle. And I have to unpack that
[1:10:23] for you now because you probably don't
[1:10:25] know what that is. I I don't know if
[1:10:26] anybody's familiar with Brother Paul
[1:10:28] Dirkson up in Saskatchewan, Canada. and
[1:10:31] he put together a green book that's
[1:10:33] called marriage courtship and dating and
[1:10:35] it's a really good resource and um lots
[1:10:38] of quotes um over and over and over
[1:10:40] again it's about yay thick or whatever
[1:10:42] and um and just really a just a
[1:10:44] wonderful resource and the role of a
[1:10:46] woman and role of a man and you know all
[1:10:48] of these things and talks about court
[1:10:50] what you know what brother Brandham said
[1:10:51] about marriage what brother Brandham
[1:10:52] said about courtship what brother
[1:10:53] Brandham said about dating all of these
[1:10:55] things so we had him to our church and
[1:10:56] he'll he'll take five services if you
[1:10:58] give it to him um to go through this
[1:11:00] whole thing and it probably be really
[1:11:01] great. But we gave him one at our church
[1:11:04] and so we gave him a Wednesday night and
[1:11:06] so he's like, "Okay, well, here we go."
[1:11:08] Um, and but he made this in in my in my
[1:11:10] opinion, he made this really profound
[1:11:11] statement that it's marriage. He he
[1:11:13] called the book marriage, courtship, and
[1:11:14] dating. And it's like, well, wouldn't
[1:11:16] shouldn't it be like dating, courtship,
[1:11:18] marriage? Like, shouldn't you start low
[1:11:19] and then, you know, work? And he's like,
[1:11:21] "No, because if you don't understand
[1:11:23] what marriage is, you don't know what
[1:11:25] you're doing when you're courting or
[1:11:26] dating. Right? The only reason you would
[1:11:30] court or date is that you would get
[1:11:31] married. And if you don't know what if
[1:11:33] you don't know what the final end result
[1:11:35] is, then you well, why would how would
[1:11:38] you do the other the the the starts of
[1:11:41] those things, right? You you you really
[1:11:43] wouldn't. And so so I thought I was
[1:11:45] like, well, that that's really quite
[1:11:46] brilliant. And so, but we can and we
[1:11:48] should we should we should probably
[1:11:49] think that through when it comes to
[1:11:50] parenting. What's the final stage? What
[1:11:53] are we looking for when we come to the
[1:11:55] end of the road? And the prophet gives
[1:11:57] us this example that we're going to
[1:11:59] listen to here in a little bit about
[1:12:00] having some issues and and coming to a
[1:12:03] place where he recognizes they're
[1:12:05] getting older. They going to need a
[1:12:06] buddy. So that would tell you then that
[1:12:09] the final stage of being a parent is
[1:12:11] that you have raised a godly friend. Is
[1:12:15] that this is going to be your brother
[1:12:17] and sister in Christ one day. Now, just
[1:12:20] just pro tip. If you're in Norway and
[1:12:22] young people start asking you these
[1:12:24] questions and you get kind of on this
[1:12:26] little deal and there's a sister who's
[1:12:28] about 6 months pregnant, you know,
[1:12:30] telling her that, you know, and going
[1:12:33] through what brother Brandham talked
[1:12:34] about and beyond the curtain of time and
[1:12:35] how Sharon Rose was, you know, 19 and
[1:12:38] just, you know, now it was a sister in
[1:12:39] Christ, you know, she's going to start
[1:12:41] crying because she's now thinking that
[1:12:44] the baby in her womb that she still
[1:12:45] wants to mother is going to be 19 when
[1:12:48] Jesus comes. and she wants to have that
[1:12:51] little baby. Just pro tip because I that
[1:12:54] happened anyway. So,
[1:12:59] but that's the end result, right? Like
[1:13:02] at some point in time, we're all going
[1:13:03] to be 19, 20 years old beyond the
[1:13:05] curtain of time. We're going to be
[1:13:07] brothers and sisters in Christ. We
[1:13:09] should be we're we're going to be
[1:13:10] friends with one another. And so then
[1:13:12] the final the the the end result of
[1:13:14] parenting is that you have raised
[1:13:16] children that are now some of your
[1:13:18] closest friends.
[1:13:22] And and that's consistent with what
[1:13:24] we're talking about because if now like
[1:13:26] if now we're going to give them begin to
[1:13:28] give them latitude in the in these final
[1:13:30] teenage stages and early 20s and all of
[1:13:33] these things, we're going to give them
[1:13:34] latitude to make these decisions. then
[1:13:36] then then they can't make decisions if
[1:13:38] we are if we are thumb down on top of
[1:13:41] them. They can't really truly make
[1:13:43] decisions. But if we're next to them and
[1:13:46] beside them saying, "Well, buddy, I
[1:13:47] mean, hey, this is I'm just calling what
[1:13:49] I see, right?" You know, now I'm
[1:13:54] becoming I'm becoming alongside you as a
[1:13:56] friend, a very trusted friend. And as as
[1:13:59] we raised our children, I you know, I
[1:14:01] would express to them like, "Hey, these
[1:14:03] are things that you should have told
[1:14:04] me." And I get it. I understand that
[1:14:07] perhaps you were afraid to tell your
[1:14:08] father. But I want to remind you there
[1:14:11] is no one on the face of this earth who
[1:14:14] is more for you
[1:14:17] than than your mother and I. There is no
[1:14:21] one on this earth that wants you to
[1:14:23] succeed more than we do. There's no one
[1:14:26] like like if you can't tell us, you
[1:14:29] can't. You're truly alone, man.
[1:14:33] That's right. cuz we are I I understand
[1:14:35] you think your friends are there but
[1:14:37] like they have not invested near what we
[1:14:39] have man like we are so for you. That's
[1:14:43] the truth.
[1:14:45] But if we're manifesting that and it's
[1:14:47] like man I am so for you and and because
[1:14:50] of that you are grounded for four years
[1:14:54] you know that there that's it's still
[1:14:56] true but it's lost in translation.
[1:14:58] That's right. Right. Right. So as they
[1:15:01] grow older then so then as they're as
[1:15:04] they're younger. Yes. You know look they
[1:15:07] look they can't practically breathe
[1:15:08] without your help sometimes and you know
[1:15:11] they can't eat without your help like
[1:15:12] you are like right and then they grow
[1:15:14] older and then now you're you know now
[1:15:16] you're really directing you know and
[1:15:18] you're playing the video game
[1:15:19] joysticking them around. No go left. No
[1:15:21] go right. No I said your other left. And
[1:15:23] you know all of these things right? And
[1:15:24] then, you know, and then they're growing
[1:15:26] and they're getting older and they're
[1:15:27] getting more responsible. And now you
[1:15:28] start, you know, it's like, yeah, okay,
[1:15:30] you can do some of these things. And
[1:15:31] then but but we're we're you know, we're
[1:15:34] self-reflecting in this pattern as we go
[1:15:36] through to recognize, hey, they're
[1:15:38] growing older and maybe I need to start,
[1:15:40] you know, giving, you know, backing away
[1:15:41] and giving them some more latitude. And,
[1:15:43] you know, I told Zion one day, I said,
[1:15:45] you know, I think I probably let go just
[1:15:47] a hair late. He's like, "Well, yeah,
[1:15:51] you know, but that, you know, but as you
[1:15:53] you know, hey, none of us are perfect."
[1:15:56] Uhuh. That's right.
[1:15:58] But to understand that that's what we're
[1:16:00] trying to do. So, our reasons for
[1:16:02] parenting, godly reasons for parenting,
[1:16:05] is to raise sons and daughters of God,
[1:16:08] to raise godly friends, and to glorify
[1:16:11] God. And so if you could play, I have a
[1:16:13] seven minute um portion of this message
[1:16:16] if it's okay that we listen to this
[1:16:19] because I could read the whole thing.
[1:16:20] But why?
[1:16:24] Dear brother Brandham, will all the sons
[1:16:26] and daughters
[1:16:28] of true bornagain believers be saved?
[1:16:33] No, brethren. No, they sure won't. See,
[1:16:37] as I as I copied David duplices on this
[1:16:41] remark, God don't have grandchildren.
[1:16:45] Just sons and daughters. See, they'll
[1:16:46] have to be born just exactly like their
[1:16:48] father and mother was born of the
[1:16:49] spirit. See, that's what makes a man a
[1:16:52] new person is because he's born again,
[1:16:54] reborn. His first birth brings him a
[1:16:56] natural man on earth. His second birth
[1:16:58] brings him a spiritual man of heaven.
[1:17:00] See, it changes him. His soul, not his
[1:17:02] outward cons, his outward being, his
[1:17:04] senses. He still feel, smell, taste and
[1:17:06] hear, but his inward parts, his desires,
[1:17:09] what motivates him, has been changed to
[1:17:11] God. See, now remember, the only way
[1:17:15] that this could happen would be this,
[1:17:16] just like it was in the time of the
[1:17:18] Roman centurion.
[1:17:20] Paul told the Roman, him and Silas, when
[1:17:24] he wanted to pull his sword and kill
[1:17:25] himself because God had shut the jail
[1:17:27] down with an earthquake. He said, "Do
[1:17:29] thyself no harm, see we're all here.
[1:17:31] Rise." And I wonder what he could do. He
[1:17:33] said, "Rise and be baptized, calling up
[1:17:36] on the name of the Lord, and thy and thy
[1:17:38] house shall be saved." See, in other
[1:17:40] words, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:17:42] I thy house shall be saved.
[1:17:45] Now, how if your house believes in the
[1:17:48] same way that you believe, see, you pray
[1:17:52] and commit your children to God and hold
[1:17:54] on to God, believing that they will be
[1:17:57] saved. I just went through the
[1:17:59] experience with my Rebecca
[1:18:02] just committed to God when she got to be
[1:18:04] a little teian and she was going with
[1:18:07] some girl when we first went out there
[1:18:09] going run over some girl's house taking
[1:18:11] music lessons and this girl I come by
[1:18:13] one day and here this girl was setting
[1:18:14] up piano playing rock and roll
[1:18:18] that was just enough for me so I told
[1:18:20] her stay away from over there and then
[1:18:22] she said well it's the only place they
[1:18:23] got to go take music you know how
[1:18:25] teanties get and I said every kid has to
[1:18:27] go through that practically everyone
[1:18:30] goes through that age. You did, I did.
[1:18:33] And we got to think their thoughts.
[1:18:36] So then a few days after that, her
[1:18:38] mother got at you for something and she
[1:18:39] sassed her. Now that's not Rebecca at
[1:18:41] all. Tuck off and slammed the door,
[1:18:43] almost knocked the things off the wall,
[1:18:45] went to school.
[1:18:47] Now I ought to have seemingly just taken
[1:18:50] my belt off and follow her out there in
[1:18:51] the yard and brought her back with warps
[1:18:53] around her. See? I thought, "Wait a
[1:18:54] minute. I got to think 18year-old
[1:18:56] thoughts."
[1:18:59] Now I said, "Mother, I know." And she
[1:19:00] started crying immediately. I said, "I
[1:19:01] know you done all you can do. I done all
[1:19:04] I can do. Now, if it's out of our hands,
[1:19:06] we have to take the next step." As some
[1:19:09] lady sweetly wrote the other day, it's
[1:19:11] in one of these questions. She said,
[1:19:12] "Brother Brand,
[1:19:15] you're not the Messiah, are you?" I
[1:19:16] said, "No, ma'am." She said, "We believe
[1:19:19] you to be our shepherd, but you're
[1:19:21] always partners to the great shepherd."
[1:19:23] I said, "That's right. That's right." I
[1:19:25] said, "Well, look, honey. Now, you've
[1:19:27] got to listen to him. It's hard for you
[1:19:28] to do this. I'm your husband, but people
[1:19:31] drive across the nations and around for
[1:19:32] just a few words of advice." Now, if you
[1:19:35] I talked to her the other day, and she
[1:19:37] just walked away from me. Now, Becky
[1:19:39] never did do that to me. And when her
[1:19:42] mother said something about she slammed
[1:19:43] the door and said, "Expect me to sit
[1:19:44] here and be a wall of power all my life
[1:19:46] and blam me." She slammed the door and
[1:19:47] went out. That's a devil. I remember the
[1:19:50] first two years of her life, she cried.
[1:19:52] We go into a restaurant eat. I'd walk
[1:19:54] her on the street while me to eat and
[1:19:55] then she'd walk her while I eat. Just
[1:19:56] cried, cried. And one day up here in
[1:19:59] Canada, cried all night and I couldn't
[1:20:01] rest. Everything be stand there. Now
[1:20:03] something said to me, it's a devil
[1:20:05] getting at your ministry. I said, "Hand
[1:20:07] me that baby." I said, "Satan, in the
[1:20:09] name of Jesus Christ, you take your
[1:20:11] hands off of her." She stopped right
[1:20:13] there and never cried more. She's the
[1:20:14] quietest kid of God. In that very hour,
[1:20:17] it was gone. You have to get that. You
[1:20:19] have to have that ino before you can do
[1:20:21] it. And then once she then that she
[1:20:24] started that I took Medi about an hour.
[1:20:26] I said, "Mei, take your hands off me.
[1:20:29] That's my kid." I said, "Is it mine,
[1:20:30] too?"
[1:20:32] All right. I said, "If she was dying
[1:20:34] this morning, you'd have to commit her
[1:20:35] to God for her eternal destination. Why
[1:20:38] can't we commit her to God now for her
[1:20:41] earthly journey?" And she said, "Well,
[1:20:42] that's my kid." I said, "It's mine,
[1:20:44] too." I said, "How can you take care of
[1:20:47] me? Not saying that." I said, "I never
[1:20:48] said that. We quit schooling her. Just
[1:20:50] advise her. She needs a buddy. And you
[1:20:52] are the one to be her buddy. You and I.
[1:20:55] We're her parent. These kids today needs
[1:20:57] a buddy. If they had a mother and father
[1:20:59] would stay home and take care of them
[1:21:00] instead of out here in a barroom run
[1:21:02] around all night and things like that,
[1:21:03] wouldn't have wouldn't have a juvenile
[1:21:05] delinquency. See, they got away from the
[1:21:07] Bible. They all went to church and made
[1:21:09] bunko games and things like that. And
[1:21:11] see, you're trying to polish up like
[1:21:12] Satan's ground out Hollywood. You can
[1:21:14] never bring Hollywood into the church.
[1:21:16] You got to uh mean bring uh the church
[1:21:19] into Hollywood. You got to bring
[1:21:20] Hollywood to your grounds. See, not go
[1:21:22] on their grounds. Let them come over
[1:21:24] here. We got something they know nothing
[1:21:26] about.
[1:21:28] So, we there got down on our knees and
[1:21:30] committed it to God. I said, I know
[1:21:32] she's 18 years old. We'll be in a few
[1:21:33] days and she and a girl at that age,
[1:21:35] she'll think about boyfriends. And we've
[1:21:37] kept her in. I said, I I never want to
[1:21:38] see her get married. I want her put her
[1:21:40] in an office here, do the work. I want
[1:21:42] to see her filled with the spirit and
[1:21:43] and and live like that. She said, "Well,
[1:21:46] we all wanted that." She said, "Well, we
[1:21:48] can't do that." Said, "She just won't
[1:21:49] listen to it." I said, "Wait a minute.
[1:21:51] We've raised her all we can. Now put her
[1:21:52] in the hands of God. Commit her." I
[1:21:56] said, "Then when she does anything, say,
[1:21:57] Becky, darling, mother don't want you to
[1:21:59] do that, but I'm your pal. I'll stick by
[1:22:01] you. Let her know that you love her.
[1:22:03] She's going to get somebody to love her.
[1:22:05] It might be the wrong woman."
[1:22:08] I said, "You be the woman who does the
[1:22:09] loving."
[1:22:11] I said, 'Honey, that sounds kind of
[1:22:13] crude, but people come every word said
[1:22:15] on personal interviews and things. I
[1:22:17] said, 'I'm common. We're common to one
[1:22:18] another because we're husband and wife,
[1:22:20] but we never let that happen. You must
[1:22:22] remember this is the name of the Lord.
[1:22:25] So, she said, "All right." We got out
[1:22:27] and committed to God. Said we take our
[1:22:28] hands off of it. That afternoon, she
[1:22:30] come in. She said, "Well, I guess you're
[1:22:32] still saying I ain't going over there."
[1:22:34] We said, "No, I never said nothing."
[1:22:36] Said, "You know, mother don't want you
[1:22:37] do that. You know what it like to kill
[1:22:38] your daddy when he heard you up there
[1:22:40] playing that boogie woogie music or what
[1:22:42] it was to that girl said now he didn't
[1:22:44] want you to do that and we don't want
[1:22:45] you that Becky but we just committed to
[1:22:46] the Lord I want you to know we love you
[1:22:49] whatever you do we still love you she h
[1:22:51] so I'm going anyhow said all right so
[1:22:55] went ahead and said all right I'll have
[1:22:56] separating when you get back she never
[1:22:58] did go
[1:23:02] no she's never went since
[1:23:05] not long after that she met George.
[1:23:07] George is a Christian. That that settled
[1:23:10] it. Then she's trying to tell Miss Woods
[1:23:12] about that. She said, "Oh, I got awful
[1:23:13] wild."
[1:23:15] Said, "Daddy, mother committed me to the
[1:23:17] Lord." He said,
[1:23:19] "Awful wild." But that that was wild to
[1:23:22] us. We don't want to get any wilder than
[1:23:23] that. See, just let it go like that. All
[1:23:25] right. Your brother Brandham.
[1:23:32] Amen. So, there's some good advice
[1:23:34] there, right? That's right. And brother
[1:23:36] Brandham begins to walk us through
[1:23:39] situations in his own family very
[1:23:41] transparently and begins to, you know,
[1:23:43] be but begins to model for us and not
[1:23:45] just preach to us things, but begins to
[1:23:47] model for us how they were going through
[1:23:49] and things that he recognized. And even
[1:23:51] though it was going to be hard for
[1:23:53] sister Ma, he says, "Look, like, hey,
[1:23:55] yes, I am your husband and I'd like you
[1:23:57] to do it this way, but also like, you
[1:24:00] know, he's saying like people come from
[1:24:02] around the world to hear me. you what
[1:24:04] you need to understand is the seventh
[1:24:06] angel is also saying
[1:24:10] we need to be her buddy. We need to be
[1:24:12] her buddy. And so it's beginning to
[1:24:14] transition. And so as we uh as we were
[1:24:16] looking at it with our youth, we were we
[1:24:18] we got into Galatians chapter 5, I
[1:24:20] believe it was. And and you know the
[1:24:22] book of Galatians that Paul is coming to
[1:24:24] the Galatians and saying who you know
[1:24:26] that they came in and they spied out
[1:24:27] your liberty. You were free in Christ.
[1:24:30] You had the ability to make these
[1:24:32] choices. but they've come and tried to
[1:24:33] push the law back on you. And and so so
[1:24:36] what we need to begin to understand is
[1:24:38] that what Paul is laying out for the
[1:24:39] Galatians is that they've been given
[1:24:42] liberty to make choices. The law was a
[1:24:45] school master to teach them. And so as
[1:24:47] the children are younger, we're using
[1:24:49] that school master to teach them, but at
[1:24:51] some point they've got to get into the
[1:24:53] liberty stage. And as they're becoming
[1:24:57] older, even though Becky is wanting to
[1:24:59] go and do something that she knows
[1:25:02] they're against, hey, we're your buddy.
[1:25:05] You, you know how it makes us feel, but
[1:25:06] you we're we're here for you. you know,
[1:25:10] and how that begins to change her
[1:25:13] response because now she recognizes
[1:25:16] they're not actually because at some
[1:25:18] point in time what happens is if we're
[1:25:20] keeping the law on them too much, they
[1:25:23] begin to we begin to embody the law
[1:25:26] which is against us.
[1:25:29] And I think you'll find Paul wrote about
[1:25:31] that as well. And so they'll begin to
[1:25:33] think you as the as the enforcer of the
[1:25:35] law are against them. And that's not the
[1:25:38] truth. So, we need to make sure that at
[1:25:40] appropriate times, we're beginning to
[1:25:42] allow the law of liberty into their
[1:25:45] lives, just as we need in our own
[1:25:47] Christian experience to allow the law of
[1:25:50] liberty, not that these things shouldn't
[1:25:51] be done or that they're wrong or all of
[1:25:53] these things, but that we need to be
[1:25:55] given the opi the ability to choose that
[1:25:59] path so that we might become Christlike.
[1:26:03] And so in so and so what's so beautiful
[1:26:05] is that as we begin to go through this
[1:26:07] this period now then we come into a
[1:26:10] place where becoming their godly friends
[1:26:15] is the same act as allowing them the
[1:26:18] liberty to make these choices. They gave
[1:26:21] Becky the liberty to make the choice to
[1:26:24] go or not.
[1:26:27] All right. So there's some other things.
[1:26:29] Now a small caveat really quick. If the
[1:26:32] goal of parenting is to produce brothers
[1:26:34] and sisters in Christ and good friends,
[1:26:36] make sure your definition of friends is
[1:26:38] godly,
[1:26:40] you know, if you know, and and so some
[1:26:43] brothers, if you enjoy, you know, and
[1:26:45] you're 40 years old and you're still
[1:26:46] gaming in the basement, and I'm not
[1:26:48] going to say anything against that or
[1:26:49] whatever, but you know, if like if all
[1:26:51] you're doing is raising a godly not
[1:26:54] well, you know, a buddy to play video
[1:26:57] games with you in the basement, perhaps
[1:26:59] you should update your definition of
[1:27:01] what godly friends means, right? Like
[1:27:04] we're not just saying, "Well, we want
[1:27:05] them to be friends and hang out buddies
[1:27:07] and ride roller coasters with." Like
[1:27:09] that's fun, but there's a higher calling
[1:27:12] than that, right? So, just a little
[1:27:14] caveat there. Um
[1:27:17] um from questions and answers number
[1:27:18] four, brother Brandham, what achievement
[1:27:20] should we let our pre-tage pre-
[1:27:22] pre-teenage children participate in?
[1:27:25] What activities should our pre-teen
[1:27:27] children participate in? Also, how
[1:27:30] should we go about helping them select
[1:27:32] their associates? This is a question
[1:27:34] that he was asked. And now here's his
[1:27:36] answer. Keep them in Christian company
[1:27:38] uh as long as you possibly can. If it's
[1:27:41] a girl, keep her with Christian girls.
[1:27:42] If it's a boy, Christian boys, you know,
[1:27:45] don't ever let them out the door with
[1:27:47] anyone that is not good Christian
[1:27:49] friends. Don't ever do it. If a another
[1:27:53] person comes that's not a Christian, you
[1:27:55] must not allow them to go.
[1:27:59] Sorry, I stopped reading at some point
[1:28:00] in time there, didn't I? Right. But but
[1:28:03] but
[1:28:05] we sometimes But that's not what he's
[1:28:07] saying, is it? Right. Keep them in
[1:28:10] Christian company as long as you
[1:28:12] possibly can. If it's a girl, keep her
[1:28:13] with Christian girls, Christian boys,
[1:28:15] vice versa. If she's old enough to go
[1:28:17] with a boy, see that she keeps with the
[1:28:19] right kind of boy. Now, I'm sure now the
[1:28:22] question in your minds is is like, "Oo,
[1:28:25] if she's old enough. What did he mean by
[1:28:27] if she's old enough? What age is that?"
[1:28:29] And it's good that I'm here to tell you
[1:28:31] because I know exactly what Brother
[1:28:32] Brennan was thinking when he said that.
[1:28:34] And it was the No, I don't.
[1:28:39] Some of you were way too like you. No,
[1:28:46] but there's a principle here, right?
[1:28:48] There is an age that's old enough and so
[1:28:52] we should be in prayer about what that
[1:28:54] is for our various children because it's
[1:28:57] probably different for every child.
[1:29:01] But there is a principle of that. Now
[1:29:03] discourage her to any boy otherwise or
[1:29:07] boy to a girl. If she's going with an
[1:29:09] unbeliever, try to encourage her to go
[1:29:12] with a believer and vice versa. So there
[1:29:15] is no law here. there is friends.
[1:29:19] And so, you know, I actually would, you
[1:29:21] know, I would talk to my boys and, you
[1:29:22] know, and of course and Azariah are
[1:29:24] very, very different. And so, this this
[1:29:26] whole process looks very different. You
[1:29:27] know, and at some point in time, I
[1:29:29] recognized that if I if I mentioned
[1:29:31] something about a what I thought was a
[1:29:33] godly young lady that Zion would just
[1:29:34] immediately be like, "Oh, yeah." Like,
[1:29:36] you know, and he'd be kind of
[1:29:37] interested. I was like, "Hey, buddy.
[1:29:38] Like, you got to make your own decisions
[1:29:39] here. Like, stop." He's like, "Yeah,
[1:29:42] maybe I was kind of doing that." that I
[1:29:43] was like, you know, and so, but what I
[1:29:45] would like is, you know, because I want
[1:29:46] to be your friend and, you know, guys do
[1:29:50] this, you know, it's like, hey, what
[1:29:51] about her? You know, it's like, I would
[1:29:52] like to be able to do that with you and
[1:29:54] just call what I see and then just leave
[1:29:56] it there. Is that okay? Can can we have
[1:29:58] and he's like, yeah, you know, and so
[1:30:00] and and he's great with that. And of
[1:30:01] course, well, not anymore.
[1:30:04] Camille would struggle with that one.
[1:30:06] But, you know, now that he's married,
[1:30:08] you know, but and then and then Aariah,
[1:30:10] it's just like I can every now and then,
[1:30:11] you know, but not nearly as often
[1:30:13] because then he thinks I'm pressuring
[1:30:15] him and that's fine because that's how
[1:30:16] he is, you know. But we we because we've
[1:30:18] learned we we've learned one another,
[1:30:20] right? I know what encouragement looks
[1:30:22] like. And if I was encouraging Aariah
[1:30:25] too much, that would actually be
[1:30:26] discouragement, right? So, so our
[1:30:28] children are various and different. And
[1:30:30] so, but we have to begin to understand
[1:30:32] in how to encourage and how to
[1:30:34] discourage. And that that's not a top
[1:30:36] down. That's a beside them kind of
[1:30:40] posture and and and way to go. And so,
[1:30:42] make your home nice. Make your home a
[1:30:45] place where your daughter or son will
[1:30:47] not be ashamed to bring their company
[1:30:48] before their father and mother and into
[1:30:50] their house. And make home so happy
[1:30:54] they'll be pleased in their home to stay
[1:30:56] there. And so if when you know your
[1:30:58] children bring over their friends and
[1:31:00] you come to the door and you're
[1:31:04] I see the kind of riff raft being
[1:31:06] brought around here and I'm sure you're
[1:31:09] all gone out of the basement for some
[1:31:12] evil toaduins and whatever it might be,
[1:31:15] you know, and like and your your kids
[1:31:17] are just like
[1:31:21] that is not what he's talking about
[1:31:23] here, right? Make your home nice, right?
[1:31:26] Welcome the friends, right? Be be a part
[1:31:29] of that. Encourage the right things and
[1:31:32] then discourage. And then maybe have if
[1:31:34] something goes south, you know, you have
[1:31:36] a conversation with it like, "Hey, how
[1:31:38] did that go for you? What did you think?
[1:31:40] I you know, well, I hope that never
[1:31:42] happens here again." you know, but and
[1:31:45] we begin to develop them so that the
[1:31:47] next time they make the choice to stand
[1:31:50] up and put a stop to it or something
[1:31:52] like that because they need to begin to
[1:31:54] develop that ability by your guidance to
[1:31:58] stand as men and women of God to make
[1:32:02] choices to do the hard things because
[1:32:05] they need to be able to strengthen to to
[1:32:07] the ability to make the choice that I
[1:32:09] will lay down my entire life, not just
[1:32:12] one part of it for a moment but my
[1:32:14] entire life for his cause always.
[1:32:19] Amen. So Christlike
[1:32:23] means choosing as we talked about in
[1:32:25] Galatians chapter 5 and verse one.
[1:32:27] Standf fast therefore in the liberty
[1:32:29] where with Christ hath made us free and
[1:32:31] be not entangled again with the yoke of
[1:32:34] bondage. So we have to ask ourselves the
[1:32:37] question who saves and protects.
[1:32:41] And so well the answer to that it's
[1:32:44] church. The answer is Jesus.
[1:32:47] And but that answer doesn't always go
[1:32:51] down easy does it? Especially to parents
[1:32:54] who have been saving and protecting for
[1:32:55] a very long time from all kinds of
[1:32:57] things. And now to begin to take your
[1:33:00] hands off and to begin to give them to
[1:33:04] to begin to let Christ actually because
[1:33:07] you've only been representing Christ
[1:33:09] through this whole time. But at some
[1:33:11] point in time, he you you have to
[1:33:13] recognize he is their savior. He is
[1:33:16] their protector. And you are not it for
[1:33:19] all of eternity. He is you've just been
[1:33:22] representing him. So if if you can
[1:33:26] commit her to God for her eternal
[1:33:28] destination, why can't you commit her to
[1:33:30] God now for her earthly journey? Oh,
[1:33:32] there we are. Sorry. Um, so 2 Timothy
[1:33:36] 1:7, as we just I want to pivot here for
[1:33:39] just just as we kind of wrap some of
[1:33:41] this up here. Um, 2 Timothy 1:7, God has
[1:33:44] not given us a spirit of fear, but of
[1:33:46] power and of love and of sound mind.
[1:33:49] Romans 8:14-15. For as many as are led
[1:33:51] by the spirit of God, they are the sons
[1:33:54] of God. And ye have not received the
[1:33:56] spirit of bondage again to fear, but
[1:33:59] you've received the spirit of adoption,
[1:34:01] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." And so,
[1:34:03] as we kind of begin to draw a lot of all
[1:34:06] these thoughts back into kind of one
[1:34:07] cohesive idea here is that we're
[1:34:10] thinking about to be Christlike must we
[1:34:13] we must choose to be Christlike.
[1:34:16] Choosing is what is what Christlike is
[1:34:18] all about. But if we're going to choose,
[1:34:21] there has to be the ability for fear to
[1:34:24] be there. And choosing would be because
[1:34:28] because what's a choice if there is no
[1:34:30] fear? It's like, you know, I mean,
[1:34:32] that's like, you know, that's like, do
[1:34:35] you want do you want cheesecake or pie?
[1:34:37] It's like, well, I mean, this is a this
[1:34:40] is a choice
[1:34:42] perhaps. I mean, you could say yes and
[1:34:44] hope that the sister gives you a slice
[1:34:45] of each. That usually happens, but maybe
[1:34:48] not. Like, it is a that's yes, it's a
[1:34:50] choice, but it's not really that's not
[1:34:51] much of a choice, though, right? But as
[1:34:54] the choices become more important, more
[1:34:58] fear and anxiety can be attached to the
[1:35:01] choice. These things have to go hand in
[1:35:03] hand, but we've not been given a spirit
[1:35:05] of fear. Uh we're not been given a
[1:35:07] spirit of bondage to fear. We're we're
[1:35:09] we're unable to make choices, but we can
[1:35:12] recognize that go that the comforter is
[1:35:15] there, that the overcomer is there
[1:35:18] inside of us, that the protector and the
[1:35:21] savior savior is there. And e and we can
[1:35:24] recognize that even when I make the
[1:35:27] wrong choices because I've been enabled
[1:35:30] to do that, I I and I've experienced
[1:35:33] I've made a wrong choice, but he never
[1:35:36] left me. Amen. That's right. Now my fear
[1:35:40] goes out the window. The next time I go,
[1:35:42] well, I want to make a better choice
[1:35:44] this time, but I can recognize that he
[1:35:46] is he is alleviating the fear by his
[1:35:49] spirit because of who he is. And now I
[1:35:53] have the liberty to make these choices
[1:35:55] and learn from them instead of thinking
[1:35:58] that these choices are either going to
[1:36:00] make me or break me completely. That's
[1:36:02] good. That being said, we want to
[1:36:05] strengthen our ability to make these
[1:36:07] choices. We want to be able to do this.
[1:36:10] And so, I want to bring um some concepts
[1:36:13] from a from a book I read by a man by
[1:36:16] the name of Jonathan Height. It was it's
[1:36:17] called The Anxious Generation. And it
[1:36:20] was a really a fantastic book um for uh
[1:36:23] you know where we are today and talks
[1:36:25] about a lot of different things about
[1:36:27] parenting. But he he he brings out it in
[1:36:30] in a concept of two basic mindsets of
[1:36:32] discover mode where a kid in discover
[1:36:35] mode will scan for opportunities.
[1:36:37] They're like a kid in a candy shop,
[1:36:38] think for themselves, and have an
[1:36:40] attitude of let me grow. No, daddy, I
[1:36:42] want to do it. It's like, you're going
[1:36:44] to fall. I want to do it anyway. Okay.
[1:36:47] And they fall like good.
[1:36:52] You've let you've let them learn
[1:36:53] something. You've not inhibited them
[1:36:55] from learning something, right? But if
[1:36:57] in a defend mode, they're always
[1:36:58] scanning for dangers. They have a
[1:37:00] scarcity mindset. It's like, well, I
[1:37:02] don't know. We should I don't know if I
[1:37:04] should go get that. Maybe we need to
[1:37:05] save that. And and cling to your team.
[1:37:07] So, mommy, daddy, family, I want to be
[1:37:10] right here with you. And a keep me safe
[1:37:12] mentality. And and and some kids are
[1:37:15] kind of very in varying places of these
[1:37:17] of these things. And we should have both
[1:37:19] of these things. We should be able to
[1:37:21] discover and we should be able to defend
[1:37:23] when we need to. We should not always
[1:37:25] like hopefully your discovery will by
[1:37:28] nature teach you to defend every now and
[1:37:30] then like hey the last time you looked
[1:37:32] over that cliff and fell like this one's
[1:37:34] farther like maybe maybe you should
[1:37:37] defend you know and and so so so a lot
[1:37:40] of discovery will will help you with
[1:37:42] your strengthening your defend. But if
[1:37:45] all you're doing it doesn't work the
[1:37:46] other way though. If all you're ever
[1:37:48] doing is defending and you're never
[1:37:50] learning the attributes of discovery,
[1:37:52] you are now binding yourselves, you're
[1:37:55] in bondage to fear. And this is what
[1:37:58] Paul is speaking of in Romans chapter 8
[1:38:00] that we just read. We are not in a
[1:38:02] bondage of fear. We have we have we
[1:38:05] should be able to understand dangers,
[1:38:08] but we are not in bondage to fear. But
[1:38:11] here's what begins to happen is if as
[1:38:14] parents we remove the ability to be
[1:38:16] Christlike and by that I mean we remove
[1:38:18] the ability for them to make choices
[1:38:21] then all they are are is in defend mode.
[1:38:23] They never learn to strengthen their
[1:38:26] ability to discover because we have we
[1:38:29] have we have generously taken that whole
[1:38:31] ability and that whole thing away from
[1:38:33] them because we know what's best for
[1:38:35] them and they'll be happier if they just
[1:38:37] do as we have prescribed for them.
[1:38:41] Except for what's happened is is they
[1:38:44] just become anxious because why? Well, I
[1:38:48] mean well we've we've removed all of the
[1:38:52] real world from their lives. We've never
[1:38:54] allowed them to climb a tree because my
[1:38:56] goodness, they might fall,
[1:39:00] you know, and but you know what hap, you
[1:39:02] know, do you know what how educational
[1:39:03] climbing a tree and falling is? You
[1:39:05] learn about gravity.
[1:39:08] You know, like you could watch a you
[1:39:09] could watch a YouTube video. You could
[1:39:11] sit them there in defend mode, watch a
[1:39:12] YouTube video on gravity, and they could
[1:39:14] they could, you know, but if they went
[1:39:16] and discovered gravity,
[1:39:19] you know, they climb a tree, they fall,
[1:39:21] right? They've learned what gravity is.
[1:39:23] It's that force that pulls you to the
[1:39:24] earth, right? Okay. And then they now
[1:39:26] they've also learned what a femur is,
[1:39:29] you know, the fibula, the tibula, you
[1:39:32] know, I don't know, wrist, like
[1:39:33] whatever. Like now they've started to
[1:39:34] learn some anatomy, you know, now that
[1:39:36] now they know what a doctor does. Now
[1:39:38] they know what a nurse does. Now they
[1:39:39] now they know what ER stands for. Now,
[1:39:42] right, they think it's just so like it's
[1:39:44] so climbing a tree can be so
[1:39:46] educational. Think of all of the things
[1:39:48] they've discovered just because they
[1:39:49] they climbed a tree and failed.
[1:39:53] What? They made a choice.
[1:39:56] But even in that now now now they know,
[1:39:58] hey, when faced with this, be safer.
[1:40:01] Maybe don't ever do that again. Maybe
[1:40:02] that was too much. Maybe you need to
[1:40:04] strengthen. Or maybe they're crazy and
[1:40:06] they're like, "Well, I'm going to just
[1:40:07] like try it again with the cast,
[1:40:10] you know?" And that's like and but but
[1:40:12] they're learning their limits. They're
[1:40:13] learning their boundaries. They're
[1:40:14] learning their abilities. Imagine going
[1:40:16] into life not knowing your boundaries.
[1:40:17] Not knowing your abilities and not
[1:40:18] knowing your limits. I mean, and it's
[1:40:20] like, well, that sounds like anxiety to
[1:40:23] me. Now I'm like, now I'm going to now
[1:40:25] I'm going to an interview. Now I'm going
[1:40:27] to a job. I don't even know what I can
[1:40:29] do. How am I going to like,
[1:40:32] you know, what if they ask me if I've
[1:40:33] ever climbed a tree in the interview?
[1:40:35] Like, I'll have to say no. Like, that's
[1:40:38] a scary interview, right? Like, that's
[1:40:40] probably never going to happen. But but
[1:40:42] you begin to understand in discovery we
[1:40:45] begin to develop because we're making
[1:40:47] choices and those choices are
[1:40:49] strengthening us because we're not in
[1:40:52] bondage to fear and we're learning what
[1:40:55] choice like we're learning the ins and
[1:40:57] outs of making choices. So, it's
[1:40:59] structuring for us that one day there's
[1:41:02] an in and out of making the ultimate
[1:41:06] choice to choose Jesus Christ. And
[1:41:08] you'll be able to sit there and go there
[1:41:10] is all kinds of reasons that and this is
[1:41:13] how we you know to be honest. Isn't this
[1:41:14] how like we don't want to be some
[1:41:16] Pharisee to our children. It's like you
[1:41:18] need to love Jesus. It's like I don't I
[1:41:20] don't want to have to be that way. What
[1:41:22] I hope that I hope that I'm such a
[1:41:24] friend to them that they want to do what
[1:41:26] their friends do.
[1:41:28] Amen. I hope that like it's like this
[1:41:30] isn't even like we're okay we're talking
[1:41:32] about it's a choice but the but it's
[1:41:36] Jesus we're talking about right like
[1:41:38] he's so amazing that the that the that
[1:41:41] the concept of not choosing him is just
[1:41:45] kind of ridiculous in our household. I
[1:41:47] mean it is the greatest thing ever.
[1:41:49] Everybody thinks that. Everybody
[1:41:51] believes that. Everybody feels that.
[1:41:54] Everybody operates within the glories
[1:41:56] and the wonders and the benefits of that
[1:41:59] that just like there's so many reasons
[1:42:01] that are on display to choose him in our
[1:42:05] household. And it should be the same in
[1:42:07] every one of our households. You know,
[1:42:09] as I've said, you know, the best way for
[1:42:11] to get your kids to love Jesus, love
[1:42:14] Jesus.
[1:42:16] Let them see what it looks like. Let
[1:42:18] them see how amazing it is. make the
[1:42:20] choice. Amaz like like the you know it's
[1:42:23] like look you're stupid if you don't
[1:42:25] choose Jesus. It's like look we don't
[1:42:26] say that in our household but we say
[1:42:28] that in our household right like it's
[1:42:30] like it's not expressly said but it's
[1:42:33] it's inferred in every single part of
[1:42:36] our life and not even in a negative way.
[1:42:38] It's like Jesus is just so great. I
[1:42:41] really don't understand why you would
[1:42:43] choose the devil or yourself
[1:42:47] you know right? And so, so we have these
[1:42:50] this this idea then that we're not we've
[1:42:52] not given a bondage to fear. Then then
[1:42:54] what we need to make sure that we're
[1:42:56] doing is allowing our children and even
[1:42:59] bringing our children into discovery and
[1:43:02] play and all of these things because
[1:43:04] it's so important that they understand
[1:43:07] that they can make choices and how that
[1:43:10] works because we want them to be
[1:43:12] Christlike. And so, you know, I would
[1:43:14] just ask you which strengthens a child
[1:43:16] more, right?
[1:43:22] And and though in this in these photos
[1:43:24] here, you know, where we have the
[1:43:26] trampoline most of us grew up with if
[1:43:28] you're 30 or older, you know, and then
[1:43:31] and then, you know, that isn't allowed
[1:43:33] anymore or the your homeowners insurance
[1:43:35] will cancel you. And then the one that
[1:43:37] you can get at Costco now. And what this
[1:43:39] image doesn't show is the proximity of
[1:43:42] the parent in the image as well. In this
[1:43:45] in in this one over here, the parent is
[1:43:48] no like they do not even know if the
[1:43:50] kids are on this trampoline or not. And
[1:43:52] here the parent is just off to the side
[1:43:55] here making sure that everything's okay.
[1:44:01] Right.
[1:44:03] And just and so it's like which one but
[1:44:05] which one strengthens the children more?
[1:44:07] like well well I mean the one that you
[1:44:09] can you know you know land and your leg
[1:44:12] falls through the one that you can
[1:44:13] actually fall off the one that's
[1:44:15] slightly dangerous and actually fun
[1:44:17] because the other one with the net is
[1:44:19] actually like that was great for like
[1:44:21] three jumps and now it's just kind of
[1:44:22] lame.
[1:44:26] It's that like if we're honest with
[1:44:28] ourselves like there's, you know,
[1:44:30] because like well what does a young man
[1:44:31] do, you know, when like like like if
[1:44:33] he's got a bicycle and and he's got a
[1:44:36] and he's got like, you know, a 2x10 and
[1:44:39] a 2x4,
[1:44:41] well, he makes a ramp, you know, like
[1:44:44] that's what it's what you do, right? You
[1:44:46] know, and you you you begin the process,
[1:44:49] right, of learning, right? you you pedal
[1:44:51] over that and you go kind of slow and
[1:44:54] then you you know and then the board
[1:44:55] kicks up as you come to the end of it
[1:44:57] and you realize okay I got to move that
[1:44:59] board down that way a little bit and you
[1:45:01] know and then actually I went too slow
[1:45:03] and it actually was worse because I went
[1:45:05] slow so I actually got to speed up and
[1:45:06] so yeah some of the guys are like yeah
[1:45:08] this is like my childhood this is great
[1:45:12] right and so and then you kind of get to
[1:45:14] the point where like now it's like yeah
[1:45:15] that was great and it's like but it's
[1:45:18] not high enough and so you get some more
[1:45:20] 2x4s or you cut that one in thirds, you
[1:45:22] know, and now you stack some more up
[1:45:23] there and now you begin to you okay, you
[1:45:25] go too slow and then you go, "Oh, yeah,
[1:45:27] that's right. I learned that it was too
[1:45:28] slow is is is not good, you know, and so
[1:45:31] I got to make sure I have a little bit
[1:45:32] more speed and you go a little bit
[1:45:33] higher and it's like, oh, this is
[1:45:35] amazing, you know, and and then it keeps
[1:45:37] getting higher and it keeps getting
[1:45:38] higher until, you know, and you had a
[1:45:40] great time." And what did you do? You
[1:45:41] you you gradually brought in the danger
[1:45:44] and you gradually overcame the fear. And
[1:45:47] that's how it works. And somehow we've
[1:45:50] lost sight of that in our culture today.
[1:45:52] And we don't allow like that's this is
[1:45:54] just our culture right here. It's like
[1:45:56] my goodness, have the pads, have the
[1:45:59] net, don't allow any danger. Stay in a
[1:46:03] bondage of fear. And that right there is
[1:46:06] what the the first first angel messenger
[1:46:10] was warning us about
[1:46:13] in Romans. No, probably not specifically
[1:46:16] that. But but but that kind of mindset
[1:46:18] is what was happening. It's like we're
[1:46:20] not in bondage to fear. You don't have
[1:46:22] to sit there and worry about the
[1:46:24] Pharisees. Bam, bam, bam, bam. No. Make
[1:46:27] choices. Allow Jesus to come alongside
[1:46:30] you and guide you and strengthen you
[1:46:33] because he's less worried about you
[1:46:35] doing it right than he is about you
[1:46:37] becoming the same thing that he is about
[1:46:40] you strengthening your own life
[1:46:43] spiritually so that you would make the
[1:46:45] same decisions that he would make as he
[1:46:48] enables you to make the choices. He
[1:46:50] begins to recognize he's a chip off the
[1:46:52] old block. He does it just like I do.
[1:46:54] She does it just like I would. But but
[1:46:57] if we but if all it was was this no
[1:46:59] choice and you stayed within the pads
[1:47:01] and within the net, then all you were
[1:47:04] ever going to do is jump the way you're
[1:47:06] supposed to jump.
[1:47:10] And your Christian life will look like
[1:47:11] you're jumping like three times and then
[1:47:14] you're like,
[1:47:17] can I have my phone back now?
[1:47:21] Speaking of which, but anyway, we'll get
[1:47:23] to that in a moment. Um, my children
[1:47:25] speak to the enemies as we read there in
[1:47:26] Psalms. They shall not be ashamed, but
[1:47:29] they shall speak with the enemies in the
[1:47:32] gate. We read the scripture like like
[1:47:36] that that our children are heritage of
[1:47:38] the Lord, but they won't be ashamed.
[1:47:39] They'll speak with the enemies in the
[1:47:41] gate. This is what raising Christlike
[1:47:43] children means is that you are giving
[1:47:45] them the tools to strengthen to such a
[1:47:48] point that when they're older, they will
[1:47:51] come and the enemies will be standing
[1:47:53] there and they won't have a problem
[1:47:55] speaking to them in the gate. They won't
[1:47:57] have a problem with saying, "No, you get
[1:47:58] packing, man. We don't allow you around
[1:48:01] here. You're an enemy. Go." All right.
[1:48:05] Because if we don't, the enemy is going
[1:48:07] to come to the gate and they're going to
[1:48:09] go, they're going to go, "My goodness,
[1:48:11] give me my pads and my net."
[1:48:16] But that's not what the scriptures
[1:48:18] saying. But we never get we never get
[1:48:20] them to speaking to the enemies in the
[1:48:22] gate. We never get them to just telling
[1:48:24] the devil to be go get packing if we
[1:48:26] don't ever allow them choices to
[1:48:28] strengthen their own hearts and their
[1:48:30] own lives. Amen. the unconditional
[1:48:32] covenant that God made with the people
[1:48:34] don't give you permission to sin. Now
[1:48:36] remember that. But what I'm trying to
[1:48:38] get is the fear knocked out of you. Even
[1:48:42] brother Brandham's own ministry. He's
[1:48:44] sitting here grappling with the fear of
[1:48:47] the people. He's spending minutes of of
[1:48:50] preaching and ministry. He's about to
[1:48:52] have a prayer line, but he can't get the
[1:48:55] people to get out of like like, hey, to
[1:48:57] get out of the pads and to get out of
[1:48:59] the net and to come down and to come
[1:49:01] into the prayer line to be able to
[1:49:03] choose to accept what Christ has for
[1:49:05] them. Because they're sitting there
[1:49:07] going, "Well, maybe God actually wants
[1:49:09] me to be sick because of what I've done.
[1:49:11] Maybe I'm not worthy of that." You see,
[1:49:14] they have a scarcity mindset. They're in
[1:49:16] defend mode. I'm fine. My problems
[1:49:18] aren't killing me yet. You know, the guy
[1:49:21] the guy the guy in the Bible sat there
[1:49:23] for 38 years and it was fine for him.
[1:49:25] Maybe I need to just sit my 38 years.
[1:49:30] And brother Brennham has to go to battle
[1:49:32] with this spirit of bondage to fear. And
[1:49:35] he says, I'm trying I'm trying. And
[1:49:37] what's he what he's saying is is that
[1:49:39] Abraham went down there, lied to the
[1:49:42] king of Ger. And the king of Ger, you
[1:49:45] know, takes Sarah and he's about to
[1:49:47] marry her. And Abraham's sitting there
[1:49:49] and he says, "Backslid."
[1:49:53] And then God goes and he speaks to the
[1:49:55] king and says, "You're as good as a dead
[1:49:57] man." He's like, "Lord, right? In the
[1:49:59] integrity of my heart, I've done this.
[1:50:02] He said it was her sister. I know. Go
[1:50:05] have him pray for you.
[1:50:09] [Laughter]
[1:50:11] I'm not the one that lied.
[1:50:14] Yeah, but that man's my prophet." And
[1:50:16] brother Brandham is saying, "See, I'm
[1:50:17] trying to get the fear knocked out of
[1:50:19] you to recognize who you are, to
[1:50:22] discover who you are, to walk into that
[1:50:26] understanding, to live in that
[1:50:28] understanding, to get to get out of the
[1:50:30] bondage of fear, and to begin to
[1:50:32] experience the glories and the richness.
[1:50:34] And sometimes, yes, you'll do it wrong,
[1:50:38] but he'll still be there, you're always
[1:50:41] scared about something, don't be scared.
[1:50:44] God has promised. God has got to do it
[1:50:46] if you believe it. If you're the seed of
[1:50:48] Abraham, he says, "If you can ever get
[1:50:49] the scare out of the church and let them
[1:50:51] realize who they are and what they are
[1:50:53] positionally, healing will be the
[1:50:55] simplest message to be preached or
[1:50:58] anything else." But you're scared.
[1:51:00] You're afraid. You don't realize you're
[1:51:02] sons and daughters of God. And now, not
[1:51:04] will be now. We are now sons and
[1:51:08] daughters of God. Not way off in the
[1:51:10] future. And we won't sometime in the
[1:51:11] future sit in heavenly places, but now
[1:51:13] we're seated in heavenly places right
[1:51:15] now. And how now we are the sons and
[1:51:18] daughters of God. It does not yet appear
[1:51:20] what we shall be in the end, but we know
[1:51:22] we'll see him for we'll have a body like
[1:51:24] his. We'll see him as he is. And so,
[1:51:28] isn't this what's happening then? Is is
[1:51:31] that is that, you know, we don't want to
[1:51:32] be caught in this same place where we're
[1:51:34] now trying to get our our older teens
[1:51:36] now to come and accept Christ. But the
[1:51:40] embodiment of Christ or the
[1:51:42] representation of Christ to them as
[1:51:44] their parents has been one of you don't
[1:51:46] have choice at all ever. And then now
[1:51:49] we're like you're 16, you need to be
[1:51:51] born again. Get up there and make a
[1:51:52] choice.
[1:51:56] Like that sounds terri. Like that's
[1:51:58] scary, man. Like and if I don't do it
[1:52:00] right, I'll be lost for forever. Thank
[1:52:02] you very much. You know, like and we're
[1:52:04] like, "Yeah, go go go get up to the
[1:52:06] altar. Make a choice for Jesus." you
[1:52:08] know, we've we haven't met let you, you
[1:52:10] know, and and and and you know, we
[1:52:12] haven't we haven't built you up, you
[1:52:14] know, to be able to make choices and to
[1:52:16] get over fears and now you're just have
[1:52:18] anxieties because all you've done is
[1:52:19] kind of sat in your room and uh looked
[1:52:21] at your phone and, you know, and all of
[1:52:23] these things. And so, and so now we're
[1:52:25] asking you to step up and make a
[1:52:26] courageous decision for Jesus Christ.
[1:52:28] And we're asking you to have courage.
[1:52:30] And we've never given you the tools to
[1:52:31] to grow in courage. And we've kind of
[1:52:34] scared you with all of the things you
[1:52:35] should or shouldn't do. And if you don't
[1:52:37] do them right, well then, you know,
[1:52:38] that's not good. And so, what do you
[1:52:40] think their opinion of Christ is? And
[1:52:43] I'm not saying whether it's a good or
[1:52:44] bad opinion, but they're going to come
[1:52:45] forward going, "God,
[1:52:49] you probably shouldn't love me.
[1:52:52] Uh, you're kind of scary. You have all
[1:52:56] kinds of restrictions and laws and
[1:52:58] everything. I would like to choose you,
[1:53:00] but you know,
[1:53:04] kind of safe right now.
[1:53:06] Maybe choosing you would be scary. Maybe
[1:53:09] choosing you would make me have to do
[1:53:11] things that I'm not ready to. You see
[1:53:14] what we've developed? What we've done is
[1:53:16] we've developed our children to that to
[1:53:19] that to that spot right there. And
[1:53:21] there's there's no one to blame but
[1:53:23] ourselves because of how we've developed
[1:53:24] them by by removing all these choices
[1:53:26] and enforcing a legalism on them that
[1:53:28] they haven't and and haven't staged that
[1:53:30] out to where they begin to understand
[1:53:33] how making choices for Christ is good
[1:53:35] for them. And so I think the balance
[1:53:37] then is representing Christ until Christ
[1:53:39] can be embodied. Amen. So, um, so we're
[1:53:44] just a little bit over time, but I want
[1:53:46] to just one thing that I could point out
[1:53:48] from the book of Trevor. Um,
[1:53:51] this is from the tech and parenting
[1:53:53] chapter. Um, and and I would just say
[1:53:55] this is as someone who's you who's who's
[1:53:57] worked with youth a lot, who has raised
[1:53:59] his own children until my youngest
[1:54:01] daughter is 19. Weep with me later. um
[1:54:04] you know is that is that um this like I
[1:54:10] understand if they're in public school
[1:54:11] they need a phone you want to be able to
[1:54:12] contact you and things like that they'll
[1:54:14] probably be okay but but you know okay
[1:54:16] give them a phone but restrict the apps
[1:54:19] right just make it a phone you know put
[1:54:21] Google Maps on there remove the browser
[1:54:23] you know the couple of things they need
[1:54:25] they need to you know two buttons is
[1:54:26] what I always said you know call mom
[1:54:28] call dad that's all they that's that's
[1:54:30] all the phone that they would have
[1:54:31] needed until they were 16 you know, and
[1:54:34] so we didn't give our our children
[1:54:35] phones until they were 16 or very very
[1:54:37] close to it and no social media until
[1:54:40] 18. And I would say this is the reason
[1:54:41] why because it it just goes right into
[1:54:43] their fear is we all know that these
[1:54:46] things are so highly addictive that
[1:54:47] they're going to stay there and what the
[1:54:49] and this is defend mode. They are not
[1:54:52] just they are not learn they can watch a
[1:54:54] YouTube video on on gravity on this but
[1:54:56] they will not learn it in the same way
[1:54:58] that they will climbing a tree. They
[1:55:00] will not they will there's no there is
[1:55:02] simulated choice on these devices but
[1:55:06] there's no real choice
[1:55:09] and so if your children are annoying you
[1:55:14] and they will and you are tempted to go
[1:55:17] watch this
[1:55:20] get on this thing you will be quiet and
[1:55:23] I can be sane
[1:55:27] fair enough we've been there Right. But
[1:55:30] be careful. Be be be mindful of of the
[1:55:34] opportunity cost
[1:55:36] as they sit there and just do that. What
[1:55:39] are they not experiencing? What are they
[1:55:41] not discovering? What are they not? And
[1:55:43] so I you you're going to have to manage
[1:55:45] technology in your own way in your own
[1:55:47] families. But what I can tell you is is
[1:55:49] that they are not they are not ready for
[1:55:51] the onslaught of the media that will
[1:55:53] come at them. That's right. because of
[1:55:55] the aforementioned
[1:55:57] um prefrontal cortex, they are not ready
[1:56:00] for it.
[1:56:02] They are not ready for it. And if if you
[1:56:04] are are if you are enabling that too
[1:56:06] early, you are taking away their their
[1:56:10] their ability to strengthen their
[1:56:11] choices. And you you may find yourself
[1:56:15] in a in a in a big world of hurt because
[1:56:18] these phones will just put them in that
[1:56:20] defined mindset mindset and will put
[1:56:22] them in a bondage of fear and not into
[1:56:25] liberty, not into discovery and not into
[1:56:29] um the the that ability to learn and to
[1:56:31] grow and to strengthen. They will not
[1:56:33] strengthen on their phones. That's
[1:56:35] that's just not going to happen. Maybe
[1:56:36] musicians, you can come. As I said, our
[1:56:38] balance here then is as we bring our
[1:56:41] children, our own hearts to Christ is
[1:56:43] that God, I want to be in liberty from
[1:56:46] fear. Maybe we can sing that song. Um
[1:56:48] I'm I'm um no longer a slave to fear.
[1:56:52] Amen. Um but but but that we that we
[1:56:56] that like I said, if if you're if you're
[1:56:58] not in the parenting stage right now,
[1:57:00] but you're parenting your own heart and
[1:57:02] you can you can begin to say to your own
[1:57:04] heart, "Am I in bondage of fear? Is
[1:57:07] there a fear here that I'm worried
[1:57:09] about? How could I how could I begin to
[1:57:12] structure my life into overcoming these
[1:57:15] fears? Into discovering the liberties
[1:57:18] that Christ has for me because I want to
[1:57:20] strengthen my life so that I can
[1:57:23] recognize that the the depth of the
[1:57:25] choice that I have in Christ. Amen.
[1:57:29] Let's just go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:57:31] Heavenly Father, tonight we love you,
[1:57:34] Lord Jesus. And I just I just hope that
[1:57:36] this was encouraging to parents and to
[1:57:38] non-parents alike. Maybe to
[1:57:40] grandparents, maybe to young people that
[1:57:42] are that will be parents one day, Lord
[1:57:44] Jesus, that they can recognize, Lord
[1:57:46] Jesus, that Father, that it's about you
[1:57:49] and it's about our choice of you, Lord
[1:57:51] Jesus. But Lord, we look at you and we
[1:57:54] see your glories and we see your wonder.
[1:57:56] Like Lord, we
[1:57:59] truly
[1:58:00] we can only wonder that those who don't
[1:58:03] choose you do not choose you.
[1:58:06] Lord, I'm captivated by you. Lord,
[1:58:11] Father, the the instructions that you
[1:58:13] give us in your word, the the beauty
[1:58:17] of the life that you give the true
[1:58:19] believer, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:21] You take away our fear, you come
[1:58:24] alongside us, and you lovingly shepherd
[1:58:26] us, oh God, and
[1:58:28] you desire us to be your bride. Lord,
[1:58:31] the amazing God

[2:04:23] me.
[2:04:27] You

[2:04:42] Oh,
[2:04:45] heartaches

[2:04:53] pieces.
[2:04:58] [Music]

[2:05:37] life
[2:05:39] to
[2:05:41] me.
[2:05:45] Empty
[2:05:47] and broken.
[2:05:50] I came back
[2:05:53] to him.
[2:05:56] of their soul
[2:05:59] unworthy.
[2:06:02] So scars
[2:06:05] by sin, but he did not
[2:06:11] despair.
[2:06:13] He started over
[2:06:17] again.
[2:06:19] And I bless
[2:06:23] the day. He did it. Throw
[2:06:28] the clay away. I'm so glad.
[2:06:33] Over
[2:06:35] and over.
[2:06:38] He molds me
[2:06:41] and makes me all into
[2:06:47] his likeness.
[2:06:50] He fashions
[2:06:53] the clay
[2:06:56] a vessel
[2:06:59] of honor
[2:07:02] that I am
[2:07:05] today
[2:07:08] and it's all because
[2:07:12] Jesus
[2:07:13] did his throw
[2:07:16] the clay
[2:07:18] way.
[2:07:20] Oh, well, he is
[2:07:23] the part of Oh, yes. And I am the Oh,
[2:07:30] what a glorious revelation. I am molded
[2:07:34] in molded in his image. That's how he
[2:07:39] wants me
[2:07:41] to stay. But when I stumble
[2:07:47] and fall
[2:07:50] and my vessel
[2:07:54] breaks,
[2:07:56] he just picks up the broken
[2:08:00] pieces. Oh, he doesn't throw like it all
[2:08:05] away. Oh,
[2:08:08] it is over
[2:08:11] and over.
[2:08:13] He holds me
[2:08:17] and he makes me
[2:08:20] and
[2:08:23] his likeness. Oh, he fashions
[2:08:29] fashions.
[2:08:30] Oh, a vessel
[2:08:35] of honor
[2:08:37] that I am
[2:08:41] today.
[2:08:43] And it's all
[2:08:45] because of Jesus. He can throw
[2:08:51] the clay
[2:08:53] away.
[2:08:55] Oh, a vessel
[2:08:58] of on earth
[2:09:01] that I am
[2:09:04] today.
[2:09:07] And it's all
[2:09:09] because Jesus,
[2:09:14] you throw
[2:09:15] the clay
[2:09:17] away.
[2:09:21] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:09:24] Amen. You've been blessed tonight.
[2:09:26] Hallelujah. Think of how brother
[2:09:28] Brandham, Brother Ram says it. He said,
[2:09:30] you know, he said, if God chose me
[2:09:34] before the foundation of the world
[2:09:37] without me having a choice within that
[2:09:40] and then when his presence would come by
[2:09:43] and I would choose him, he said, "How
[2:09:45] much more will he not raise me up if I
[2:09:49] go by the way of the grave?" Because our
[2:09:52] choice is really only reflective of the
[2:09:55] choice that was made before the
[2:09:57] foundation of the world. Aren't you glad
[2:10:00] like his his presence comes by to
[2:10:05] dismantle fear. Amen. Drive away
[2:10:08] discouragement, but never to make the
[2:10:11] choice for us, but to encourage us in
[2:10:14] the right things and to discourage us in
[2:10:17] the wrong things. Aren't you glad? Amen.
[2:10:20] You know, think about it.
[2:10:24] If the rapture was bringing people to
[2:10:28] another dimension that really don't want
[2:10:30] to serve you,
[2:10:32] because the rapture doesn't change the
[2:10:34] character, right?
[2:10:36] So, I mean, to think about that, if you
[2:10:38] if God was going to rapture people that
[2:10:40] don't want to be with him now, I mean,
[2:10:41] why why?
[2:10:45] But but you see the whole the whole
[2:10:46] thing of the rapture is the catching
[2:10:49] away
[2:10:50] to a wedding supper from a union that's
[2:10:54] taken place right here by divine love.
[2:10:59] And you know just like we're standing
[2:11:01] here tonight every one of us had a
[2:11:02] choice. Everybody had a choice.
[2:11:06] Like even when the scripture says
[2:11:07] forsake not to assemble yourselves
[2:11:08] together as the manner of some is. That
[2:11:10] was a choice. So everything is a choice.
[2:11:13] And you know, it it very it comes down
[2:11:15] to such a a simple thing. We've we've
[2:11:18] all made wrong choices. We've all made
[2:11:21] bad choices. And I'm not just talking
[2:11:22] about when before God got a hold of our
[2:11:24] life. But even now, it's choices. It's
[2:11:28] choices. And you know what it is? Is God
[2:11:31] give us the grace to have the humility
[2:11:33] to realize when we made the wrong choice
[2:11:35] and to learn. Lord, I want to learn. And
[2:11:38] he wants to teach us. You know, that's
[2:11:40] one thing about our God. He doesn't rub
[2:11:42] your nose or my nose in the dirt. He
[2:11:44] wants to teach us. So why? Because the
[2:11:47] next time we come to that choice, he
[2:11:49] wants to be standing there and looking
[2:11:50] and saying, "Yes,
[2:11:54] they got it this time."
[2:11:56] Because we everything I know I know I'm
[2:12:00] right here tonight. There's certain
[2:12:01] things I can say, "Man, I don't want to
[2:12:03] have to go through that again." But
[2:12:04] every test that I fail, I got to go
[2:12:07] through it again. And eventually
[2:12:10] eventually it's going to be passed.
[2:12:12] Amen. Lord, let me let me just take your
[2:12:15] grace. Let me accept that grace. Let me
[2:12:17] recognize that you're bigger than me and
[2:12:20] you're greater and and he's there to
[2:12:23] guide us. Amen. Now, I know when brother
[2:12:27] Trevor mentioned that about the net and
[2:12:28] the trampoline,
[2:12:34] but aren't you glad when the when the
[2:12:37] comforter has come,
[2:12:39] we're not put on autopilot.
[2:12:42] It's there to guide us.
[2:12:44] He said he would lead and guide us into
[2:12:46] all truth, not make us,
[2:12:50] not push us.
[2:12:52] See, that's part of our growing into
[2:12:54] adoption is choices. Amen. And he's
[2:12:58] right there alongside of us. Aren't you
[2:13:00] glad for that?
[2:13:04] I I just to me I really really really
[2:13:06] enjoyed the service tonight. Really
[2:13:09] enjoyed it tonight because it it goes
[2:13:11] beyond just of of parenting. I love the
[2:13:14] opening statement and he made it again
[2:13:15] is think about the parenting of our own
[2:13:18] heart because that's true.
[2:13:20] It's the parenting of our own heart. And
[2:13:22] we want our heart in the right place to
[2:13:24] receive the right kind of influence.
[2:13:25] Right? And that's the same thing when we
[2:13:28] come to our children, come with
[2:13:30] everything. God, that's my heart as a
[2:13:31] pastor, husband, father, so forth. Amen.
[2:13:35] Don't you just love him? Amen.
[2:13:38] Amen. Brother Trevor, thank you. Yes.
[2:13:41] Thank you. Amen. If you want to come
[2:13:44] back, if you want to come back and
[2:13:47] [Applause]
[2:13:50] Amen. It's been so good to have him and
[2:13:52] sister anime. Thank you all for coming.
[2:13:54] And I know you were here on other
[2:13:56] business, but man, I'm so glad. I'm glad
[2:13:58] this worked out. Amen. Amen. Let's just
[2:14:01] go to the Lord in a word of prayer
[2:14:03] tonight. And Amen. I know that brother
[2:14:05] Trevor's already prayed and if any any
[2:14:08] request, anything you have on your heart
[2:14:10] and even as we go our separate ways,
[2:14:12] let's just put it before the Lord. God
[2:14:13] knows our hearts.
[2:14:16] Heavenly Father,
[2:14:20] Lord Jesus,
[2:14:22] choice after choice after choice.
[2:14:27] Lord, as we stand here tonight,
[2:14:30] that's our desire is choices
[2:14:35] that lead us closer to you, Lord.
[2:14:38] Father, as you work and you deal with
[2:14:40] each of our lives,
[2:14:43] each of us, Lord, even as we're gathered
[2:14:44] here tonight, Father, throughout this
[2:14:48] portion that's gathered here, each each
[2:14:50] are at different stages. But you know,
[2:14:53] Lord, that's what I love about you is
[2:14:55] how that you work with us right where
[2:14:58] we're at. You've got a goal. There's a
[2:15:02] purpose. There's a desire,
[2:15:04] Lord, for that embodiment.
[2:15:07] And then when Lord that embodiment has
[2:15:10] come like Paul would say until Christ be
[2:15:14] formed in you and then Lord as that
[2:15:17] spirit of adoption enters into our
[2:15:19] hearts the spirit of truth he's there to
[2:15:23] then lead us and guide us into all truth
[2:15:27] teach us tutor us guide us bringing us
[2:15:31] Lord God
[2:15:33] to that place
[2:15:35] what you have in your kind father into
[2:15:38] full adoption. Lord, how we are so
[2:15:41] thankful, God, for your mercies.
[2:15:45] Help us, Lord. Help each and every one
[2:15:47] of us that are gathered here, no matter
[2:15:49] where we're at. May we not, Lord, look
[2:15:51] at ourselves, but may we look to you.
[2:15:54] And oh God, may our hearts be
[2:15:57] strengthened even from taking counsel
[2:16:02] from your word at the mistakes that
[2:16:04] we've made. Father, may you with your
[2:16:07] presence, oh God, just cause our hearts
[2:16:11] like you described that through brother
[2:16:12] Trevor with Sister Hadtie's voice. The
[2:16:15] choice was accelerated,
[2:16:18] Lord Jesus. We need divine assistance,
[2:16:21] Lord. We need your presence, Lord. We
[2:16:25] need, Lord, the sweeping of the Holy
[2:16:27] Ghost, Lord, through every service,
[2:16:29] Lord. And father, even as we would give
[2:16:32] ourselves in prayer, Lord, asking not
[2:16:35] our will but thine will be done. Oh God,
[2:16:38] be the sole influence, Lord. Grant it,
[2:16:42] Lord. Influence us, Lord. You know the
[2:16:45] decisions, the choices. You know what we
[2:16:47] have ahead of us, Lord. I pray, God,
[2:16:50] always be the influence, Lord. Come
[2:16:53] right alongside us, Lord. Guide us and
[2:16:56] direct us, Lord. how you said so
[2:16:58] faithfully you'd be a father to us Lord
[2:17:01] to walk in us Lord. Oh thank you for
[2:17:05] your mercy tonight Lord. Thank you for
[2:17:08] brother Trevor and sister Ana May. Lord
[2:17:11] how we so enjoyed ourselves at your
[2:17:13] table tonight Lord. Father, we walk away
[2:17:15] from here, Lord, oh God, with Lord
[2:17:19] Jesus, a greater desire, Lord, to make
[2:17:24] choices, Lord, just leading to you,
[2:17:27] Lord.
[2:17:28] Help us tonight, Lord. We pray. May you
[2:17:30] go with your children, watch over
[2:17:32] Brother Trevor and him, Lord, as they
[2:17:34] would travel back home, Lord. And I pray
[2:17:36] for the rest of us, Lord. Be with us
[2:17:38] tomorrow throughout the day. God, bring
[2:17:42] us all back at the appointed time.
[2:17:43] Should you, Terry? We love you. We thank
[2:17:46] you so much, Father, for your mercy in
[2:17:48] the name of Jesus Christ.
