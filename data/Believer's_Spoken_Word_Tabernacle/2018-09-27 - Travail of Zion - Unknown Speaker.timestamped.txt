[33:09] [Music]
[33:31] the name of the Lord to think what
[33:36] greatness that how that our Lord Jesus
[33:38] made a way that the desire that he sold
[33:42] within our hearts could come into a full
[33:45] reality I'll tell you that's just
[33:48] something that becomes more precious day
[33:50] by day to recognize and realize like
[33:53] Paul could say it's not either liveth
[33:55] but yea it is Christ who liveth in me
[33:58] the life I now live in this flesh I now
[34:03] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[34:05] loved me and gave himself for me that is
[34:09] that is such a blessed reality that
[34:13] moves within our hearts greater and
[34:15] greater don't you love him
[34:18] it's it is just so real to think of it
[34:21] of how that God's grace here we are we
[34:24] stand another you know another year
[34:26] another time you know but yet it within
[34:30] it all God's grace it has and it is
[34:33] sufficient I'll tell your friends I
[34:36] really believe more and more the longer
[34:38] that we as we journey along and when we
[34:41] stand there on that day we are going to
[34:43] realize just how little that we had to
[34:47] do with it and how much it has been him
[34:51] all the way the only thing he asks us to
[34:56] do is yield and allow him to perform and
[35:00] accomplish in us what he has already
[35:02] seen and declared as a finished work may
[35:06] God just help us amen so good to be here
[35:10] tonight good to be gathered together

[35:24] were given three words to abide by
[35:25] believe watch and pray amen so whatever
[35:31] you need is tonight God already knows
[35:34] what you need
[35:35] no matter if it's something that just
[35:37] arose today he already provided to be
[35:41] able to minister to that need before
[35:43] there was an Adam Stardust or molecule
[35:46] and he is able tonight no matter where
[35:49] you stand or you sit you might be
[35:52] looking and say God I know what you I
[35:55] know what the promise says and what you
[35:57] have made and who you are but just be
[36:00] faithful and stand right there
[36:02] and watch the RAM come on the scene
[36:05] watch God manifests himself as Jehovah
[36:08] Jireh tonight once again so good to have
[36:12] brother Daniel here with us and brother
[36:14] Daniel my brother friend and brother
[36:22] Daniel we've known but the Daniel and
[36:23] I've known one another now for I believe
[36:26] it's been 12 years and so God has made
[36:29] such a way for our brother to be able to
[36:33] visit with us each time that he's come
[36:35] here in the States and brother Daniel is
[36:38] just a real blessing to us as an
[36:39] assembly the gift that God has placed in
[36:42] his life and we just want to look to the
[36:44] Lord tonight and draw from the Lord
[36:48] tonight knowing that God already has
[36:50] prepared what we have need of amen so

[37:14] more than just these eyes right here you
[37:18] know the Bible says we walk not by faith
[37:20] and we walk not by a sight but by faith
[37:22] but sight isn't just this it's feelings
[37:26] it's all things that come in this realm
[37:29] and when we sing this song you turn your
[37:32] eyes upon Jesus I believe with all my

[37:36] turning everything let everything loose
[37:38] let it be focused on the Lord no matter
[37:41] what your feelings say you doubt your

[42:54] eight to
[42:57] but I'll stay team he says who have
[43:05] heard such a thing who has seen such
[43:09] things shall the earth be made to bring
[43:14] forth in one day or shall a nation be
[43:18] born at once for as soon as as I won't
[43:21] reveal she brought forth her children
[43:25] shall I bring to the bay and not cause
[43:28] to bring forth see at the Lord shall I
[43:32] cause to bring forth and shut the womb
[43:34] saith thy God rejoice ye with Jerusalem
[43:38] and be glad with her all ye that love
[43:44] they rejoice for joy with hay all ye
[43:48] that moon for her the Emmis suck and we
[43:53] satisfied with a breast of a
[43:54] constellations they mmm milk out and be
[43:58] delighted with abundance of a glory for
[44:01] thus saith the lord behold I was ten
[44:04] peace to her like a river and the glory
[44:07] of the Gentiles like a flowing stream
[44:09] then shall ye saw here shall be borne
[44:12] upon his sights and be done though upon
[44:15] her needs as one whom his mother
[44:18] comforted
[44:19] so will I comfort you and ye shall be
[44:22] comforted
[44:23] in Jerusalem they the Lord Artus
[44:27] blessing to the reading of his way shall
[44:28] we have our seat
[44:41] well tonight we are we want to speak on
[44:46] a short topic travail of Zion travel of
[44:52] Zion the just the Bible that we have
[44:55] just read is telling us about how Zion
[45:00] travailed and when they don't reveal she
[45:05] brought forth her children amen
[45:10] when we talk about Rockville I think
[45:12] that their sisters who understand it
[45:16] better because meaning of travel it just
[45:22] well if you check the dictionaries need
[45:25] to have a lot a lot of you know
[45:27] definitions of it some say is a sexy
[45:30] excessive pain you know some say that is
[45:37] unfavorable condition you know and
[45:41] others also say that it is something
[45:44] that is hardship okay but I like the
[45:51] other one that says that is just a Libba
[45:55] pain or Beth pain that is Travie
[46:02] Alleluia you know so it's not something
[46:05] that that is you know just light you
[46:09] know rumor around preaches someone it a
[46:11] little bit peens
[46:12] yeah it is where something is getting
[46:15] from one condition to another you know
[46:18] it brings such you know terrible
[46:20] condition upon a being and this one is
[46:24] not your child but Israel travel travel
[46:28] of Zion hallelujah now so we realize
[46:32] that we are talking about Libba pain or
[46:35] childbirth is not something easy and for
[46:41] our club for the assistance
[46:44] yes sir because they understand what I'm
[46:48] talking about right now
[46:49] in fact the sisters who have brought
[46:52] forth who have gone through that
[46:53] condition we see so many so many
[46:57] sometimes in fact we've had pity for
[47:00] them we we feel for them because it's
[47:04] not easy our brother is not easy at all
[47:08] okay so you have to tell God that you're
[47:10] not a woman
[47:11] it's not easy when they carry their
[47:14] children it will come to a time they do
[47:18] if you fail to eat because the moment
[47:19] the food enters into the baby have to
[47:21] bring it out a whole lot of Pinot
[47:23] condition which is not favourable you
[47:27] know and you see oh brother sister I
[47:31] know you know what I'm talking about
[47:33] Alleluia and that is what we call travel
[47:36] amen but the real trouble is when it is
[47:40] time for the child to come when it is
[47:45] time for a bath to come that is where
[47:50] the real trouble comes that is why the
[47:55] bubbly say that as soon as I own travail
[47:59] she brought forth her children amen amen
[48:03] and we know by history that during 1917
[48:09] during the First World War
[48:11] I think that was the first time that
[48:13] even even you know right that was the
[48:16] first and the Jews started going back to
[48:19] the homeland because but then the
[48:22] prophecy of Jesus Christ has already
[48:24] been fulfilled
[48:25] they say that Jerusalem shall be trodden
[48:27] down by the Gentiles okay and they will
[48:31] be scattered all over the world and the
[48:33] property said until the Gentile days are
[48:36] fulfilled so would realize that they
[48:39] were scattered when the rock Tytos
[48:42] beseech the whole place and you know
[48:44] they were able to scatter everybody and
[48:47] broke everything down and all the Jews
[48:49] scattered all over the world my aunt a
[48:53] 1917 instead of going back
[48:57] why because Zion travailed according to
[49:01] Isaiah I said Wednesday on travail you
[49:04] bring you bring forth a children so they
[49:08] went back to nineteen nineteen seventeen
[49:11] back to the island and you know what
[49:14] happened they are born through so many
[49:18] experienced war here were there a little
[49:22] nation fighting about seven nations at
[49:24] the same time you know because it was
[49:27] time that you should go back and take
[49:30] the island in fact the prophecy of Jesus
[49:32] Christ did not say that they will remain
[49:35] in the Gentile world okay they will go
[49:39] back and take possession and we all know
[49:44] that brother sister and today as
[49:47] Jerusalem is in the hands of Israel we
[49:51] all believe and we all know that they
[49:53] will not share it with any other nation
[49:57] hallelujah
[49:59] you know because things are happening
[50:02] you know and it's like nothing is
[50:05] happening okay because God for that
[50:11] matter revealing himself did not do it
[50:16] outside or publicly he did it in a
[50:21] secret place and the revelation is for
[50:27] only the bread of Jesus Christ
[50:30] that is why many things are happening in
[50:33] the world even a political circle and
[50:36] people don't know what they mean but you
[50:39] and I at least we know something is
[50:41] happening amen
[50:44] you know so when they won't reveal she
[50:48] brought forth her children amen I've
[50:55] already stated that I'm not a politician
[50:58] and I don't think I'll be one
[51:02] oh no and I know you're not like also to
[51:09] be a politician hallelujah
[51:12] but in the political cycle
[51:14] brother/sister many things are happening
[51:17] that did themself do know what they are
[51:19] doing in a canoe imagine okay
[51:26] can you imagine that just last year the
[51:29] Zima on the system is Emma the president
[51:35] declared euro solemn as a capital of
[51:37] Israel you know that well you may not
[51:43] like that man and I'm not saying that
[51:45] you like him you understand I don't vote
[51:51] in America so it cannot ask me Brad
[51:56] Daniel do you will you'll vote for the
[51:58] man again oh I don't know I don't have
[52:00] my boots here but you see no matter what
[52:04] no matter how people talk about him no
[52:07] matter how people insult him I'm stating
[52:10] again that I'm not a politician I'm not
[52:11] doing political campaign but at least
[52:15] that man have done something that
[52:17] picture on my heart hallelujah for
[52:20] standing alone in declaring Jerusalem as
[52:23] a so capital of the Israelite amen this
[52:27] was something that God was looking for
[52:29] because Jerusalem must be restored back
[52:31] to the Jews for the preparation of the
[52:35] coming of the Messiah a man a name on
[52:39] the Seas of the Zima last year remember
[52:43] the domicile system a number of a man
[52:44] and no matter of was that that the
[52:49] twelfth man is also restoration so
[52:52] Jerusalem was restored hallelujah by a
[52:56] man hallelujah by a man to fulfill the
[53:02] Scriptures you say what do you like it
[53:07] or not it is declared hey man we know
[53:13] that others came the promise or desk and
[53:15] the promise they were not able to do it
[53:18] but another one has come and has done it
[53:22] it taste to mine joy because Israel as a
[53:27] nation must have the capital where it
[53:30] started they want travail let us look to
[53:37] that place that thing that they have
[53:39] gone through here were they
[53:43] amen and amen God is always looking for
[53:48] that because everything must be in this
[53:53] position
[53:54] the Word of God can never be chopped off
[53:58] everything must be in his position
[54:00] Jerusalem will never be shared among the
[54:04] Jews and any other nation whether you
[54:08] believe it or not there is no politics
[54:11] this is Bible preached the name of our
[54:16] God and today look at what is happening
[54:26] many people are afraid to support that
[54:31] cause many nations were afraid to
[54:36] support that cause but well I remember
[54:42] the bonus of the University or mother or
[54:47] to the UN that time she said America
[54:52] don't need any nation to back her in
[54:56] declaring Jerusalem as the capital of
[54:59] the image because Zion of already
[55:04] travail and a bubble say that when they
[55:08] travail should bring forth her children
[55:14] amen
[55:16] Jerusalem was their capital before they
[55:19] were scattered all over the world so if
[55:21] they have come to take their land they
[55:23] must take Jerusalem amen yes sir and
[55:29] what I love here brothers and sisters is
[55:32] not it is not calling Jerusalem that is

[1:02:18] there is not our mind is not our power
[1:02:21] but is what what I would deign before
[1:02:24] the foundation of the world
[1:02:25] amen i tangled that you pulled me out
[1:02:29] from the false church because this is
[1:02:34] the only place that we can have our joy
[1:02:38] now so let's continue he says as one as
[1:02:44] whom as one whom his mother comforted so
[1:02:48] will i comfort you and ye shall be
[1:02:50] comforted
[1:02:51] in Jerusalem amen and one thing I want
[1:02:56] you to be aware is that us the nation or
[1:03:01] for that matter that city Jerusalem I'll
[1:03:03] be given to the Israelites I am sure
[1:03:05] would know Mahad that no nation will be
[1:03:07] able to take it again from them no no no
[1:03:11] no no now that those things are over no
[1:03:14] nation is going to be able to take it
[1:03:17] from them oh my praised be the name of
[1:03:20] our God that is why today they have
[1:03:22] fortified themselves you know no
[1:03:27] something came around I think about two
[1:03:29] months ago about some you know
[1:03:31] artilleries that you know they are
[1:03:35] prepaid they say in 15 years time do not
[1:03:39] cross the ibadis to fight the enemies
[1:03:42] perhaps why because they are fortified
[1:03:46] themselves okay and today we know that
[1:03:50] every nation is afraid of the other Amen
[1:03:56] so if you want to attack any nation you
[1:03:59] have to know what you are doing you have
[1:04:02] to be sure of what we are going to do
[1:04:03] but you can't play around Israel at this
[1:04:06] time
[1:04:08] hallelujah because she travailed and
[1:04:13] when she traveled she brought forth her
[1:04:17] children and if the children are back to
[1:04:20] the island
[1:04:21] whatever they are preparing via whom
[1:04:26] then the thing that went on wrong they
[1:04:29] are preparing it
[1:04:30] they are building it back amen and we
[1:04:35] know that this travel of Zion for the
[1:04:41] nation to be born we know that it fell
[1:04:43] under the Feast of Trumpets you got it
[1:04:45] yeah because that was what brought them
[1:04:48] from all over the missions and you know
[1:04:52] the we went under the Feast of Trumpets
[1:04:54] and we know what happened so many was
[1:04:59] here and they about seven nation at a
[1:05:03] time fighting this little nation but by
[1:05:06] the intervention of God they were able
[1:05:07] to defeat all the enemies
[1:05:09] Olivia so it was the Feast of Trumpets
[1:05:11] that brought them together to fulfill
[1:05:13] Jesus Christ prophecy and Luke 21 say
[1:05:17] Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the
[1:05:19] Gentiles and the whole place will be
[1:05:22] scattered all over until the Gentile
[1:05:24] days are fulfilled and so when we saw
[1:05:27] them going back it means a trumpet as
[1:05:31] blew and it was gathering all that
[1:05:34] people from all over the world if you
[1:05:36] read Isaiah chapter 43 you see this one
[1:05:38] come from the Sun someone come from the
[1:05:40] know they're not the east and the west
[1:05:42] and he said I would tell them not to
[1:05:44] give up amen I would tell them not to
[1:05:49] give up
[1:05:50] well not back so they came from all over
[1:05:54] the place to build the mission Israel
[1:05:58] amen
[1:06:00] you know that was it but we see they
[1:06:04] didn't just let the feasts of pentacles
[1:06:07] they rejected it when the power came
[1:06:10] they rejected it and that is why the
[1:06:13] Lord God used that period to prepare the
[1:06:16] gentle bride oh praise be the name of
[1:06:19] our God 15 years in all of the period
[1:06:23] that takes that the Pentecost office
[1:06:26] know it God brought it to build a
[1:06:29] Gentile bride of which you are and I am
[1:06:32] also one of the
[1:06:34] amen you see but when the time came for
[1:06:38] the trumpet to blow for them to go back
[1:06:40] the bubble must be more fulfilled
[1:06:43] exactly as Hosea said let's quickly read
[1:06:47] hosea chapter 6 yeah who's there chapter
[1:06:58] 6 he says come let us return unto the
[1:07:01] Lord for he has torn and he will heal us
[1:07:08] he has smitten and he will bind us up
[1:07:12] after two days will he revived us in the
[1:07:17] ten day he will raise us up and we shall
[1:07:21] live in a sight my god he thought so it
[1:07:34] was a doing of God you know the Bible
[1:07:39] say that they were blinded for our sake
[1:07:44] because of you insisted my eye they were
[1:07:47] blinded not that they don't want it so
[1:07:51] that we will come in so they were
[1:07:55] blinded that therefore therefore this we
[1:07:58] praise to God for what he has done for
[1:08:01] us it was not in your intention but it
[1:08:06] was ordained by God so that we'll get a
[1:08:09] chance of taking our position now we are
[1:08:12] taking our position in the Lord before
[1:08:15] we are going to receive the atonement so
[1:08:21] Hosea say that he had gone and he will
[1:08:25] heal us
[1:08:26] he has smitten and he will bind us up he
[1:08:32] started us all over the world by you
[1:08:35] bring us back again after two days
[1:08:39] and of course they're not yesterday
[1:08:42] Wednesday and today toss they know but
[1:08:46] after two thousand years amen after two
[1:08:51] thousand years after two days we'll here
[1:08:53] invite us and that is why we saw the
[1:08:57] revival coming in the life of the Jews
[1:09:01] when they we started going back to the
[1:09:04] homeland it was a revival it was a
[1:09:08] travel because travel brings Reviva to
[1:09:13] bring them back home and he says in the
[1:09:17] third day he will raise us up and we
[1:09:21] shall live in his sight and today we see
[1:09:25] the way and when Israel is reached
[1:09:28] well I don't know whoever who believe
[1:09:31] that but that machine is Rhys there are
[1:09:34] a lot of things that they do to support
[1:09:36] the whole world many many many many
[1:09:39] things that we do even have the idea
[1:09:42] that it was coming from that place
[1:09:45] it's raged he's saying that today we
[1:09:49] will live in a site and we are in the
[1:09:53] 10,000 years of Jesus Christ coming
[1:09:59] dying bury resurrection and ascension we
[1:10:07] only 10,000 years and a prophecy that in
[1:10:10] that 10 day we will live in his site so
[1:10:15] it means they are preparing themselves
[1:10:17] to receive their Messiah praised be the
[1:10:22] name of our God and today if the
[1:10:26] condition is like that in the life of
[1:10:29] the Jews then wash with a Gentile bride
[1:10:32] do now we have seen everything fulfilled
[1:10:38] they are ready not to receive their
[1:10:40] Messiah but as Joseph put his wife and
[1:10:44] children in a palace to reveal himself
[1:10:46] to his brethren so is what would happen
[1:10:50] when Christ must put us a
[1:10:52] the rupture to reveal himself to his
[1:10:56] people what should we do this situation
[1:11:03] currently she also puts us into a sort
[1:11:07] of trouble okay a sort of tribal leader
[1:11:12] that time of jokes brother sister they
[1:11:16] did not a time a time of pampering the
[1:11:20] different time that you should slack but
[1:11:23] this should be a time of serious
[1:11:25] business hallelujah this should be a
[1:11:30] time of availability availing yourself
[1:11:34] for the Spirit of God to use you
[1:11:38] hallelujah
[1:11:39] this is the time that we see ourselves
[1:11:42] always in the presence of God amen and
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:49] they know the time of looking forward ly
[1:11:52] pleasures did not a time of talking
[1:11:59] about someone did not a time of
[1:12:04] destroying somebody sitting by you
[1:12:08] hallelujah
[1:12:10] this is not a time of asking yourself
[1:12:14] the question well I will I go into the
[1:12:18] rapture or not you ask me that question
[1:12:22] I don't know Alleluia
[1:12:26] yeah because sometimes the behavior of
[1:12:29] the believer you know put certain
[1:12:32] questions within him or herself in Osseo
[1:12:38] she is not sure but tonight I want you
[1:12:42] to be sure of yourself
[1:12:44] hallelujah I wanted to be sure of
[1:12:47] yourself
[1:12:48] Amen that you should not allow some
[1:12:52] spirits
[1:12:54] what server to tell you that you are no
[1:12:58] pot no you are part you apart therefore
[1:13:04] allow the Spirit of God to put you in a
[1:13:07] state of travel they love the Lord more
[1:13:11] than any other team in this world you
[1:13:15] see yourself always in the presence of
[1:13:17] God to fill in the scriptures we say
[1:13:21] Britannia what's preaches is that it's a
[1:13:23] force ignore the Assembly of the debris
[1:13:25] together as it has been the manner of
[1:13:28] son as we see the Day approaching
[1:13:32] and I always ask what day that's it
[1:13:37] god bless reveal coming of the Lord that
[1:13:41] day is fast approaching
[1:13:42] and there is a condition the Bible said
[1:13:44] that we should not forsake the
[1:13:45] assembling of ourselves together that
[1:13:48] condition should put us into travail
[1:13:50] that if I don't see my brother I better
[1:13:55] see my sister I am NOT happy that should
[1:13:58] be the condition that is the condition
[1:14:02] that we should pray hard for the track
[1:14:04] to try the church must try with the
[1:14:10] blessings that God has given to us amen
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:14] hallelujah we know that the other
[1:14:20] churches they don't have what we have
[1:14:23] and it just by the grace of God not that
[1:14:27] they want it oh yes
[1:14:30] because many times when I remember Oh
[1:14:32] God so how did not be your grace also be
[1:14:36] among those people then I said God I
[1:14:40] thank you for my life they don't deserve
[1:14:44] to be there but the condition I put them
[1:14:46] day so you see what should we do we
[1:14:50] should rejoice and glorify God for that
[1:14:53] for soul loving us amen that we we are
[1:14:59] not lost my brother we have found the
[1:15:02] way
[1:15:03] oh my is this listen to what the
[1:15:11] prophesy say you let to know what I
[1:15:14] think the greatest need of the check
[1:15:16] today well I think the luckiest is and
[1:15:22] no so tragic their people are not
[1:15:27] brought up enough that is the thing the
[1:15:31] Prophet is telling us there is not
[1:15:33] better simile and you give me someone
[1:15:37] that just saw tore up about lost souls
[1:15:40] that they just cry and wanting a river
[1:15:44] so bad till they can hardly eat they
[1:15:48] just simply can't amen you see brother
[1:15:55] and sister you should understand that
[1:15:59] there should be a condition that who
[1:16:02] make us not love this current you know
[1:16:05] situation that we are now there should
[1:16:10] be a condition he named and we put our
[1:16:14] so down we put our body down to fight
[1:16:18] that cause well very soon we are going
[1:16:24] to see the other chick is chasing us
[1:16:29] chase us that would you preach what they
[1:16:33] want they will chase us and tell us that
[1:16:37] we should come and join them but I know
[1:16:40] that that is not going to be there's a
[1:16:44] blessed assurance the professor that the
[1:16:47] moment they start to do that the rapture
[1:16:50] will take place ever but that does not
[1:16:54] mean that we should behave as if we
[1:16:56] don't know what is going on hallelujah
[1:17:00] the condition to put us into travail the
[1:17:06] condition to make us always be a less or
[1:17:09] what is going to happen us
[1:17:13] amen and amen he said if you read the
[1:17:16] history of the world and the religious
[1:17:19] history you find out it's always taking
[1:17:22] that kind of a spirit to bring a revival
[1:17:25] that is right when they don't travail
[1:17:29] she brought forth her children you have
[1:17:34] to be taught up it is the atmosphere
[1:17:39] hallelujah of anything it is atmosphere
[1:17:43] is it that is why when we are talking
[1:17:46] about atmosphere and the way and manner
[1:17:48] you will travailed it brings me back to
[1:17:52] dead chicken in a shell you see the
[1:17:56] point first it was an egg they will just
[1:18:01] put it on fire for about five or ten
[1:18:04] minutes and bring it out and then you
[1:18:06] know peel it and gas swallow it but it
[1:18:11] was put somewhere and there was an
[1:18:15] atmosphere that changed the condition of
[1:18:19] the of the egg so other cheek developed
[1:18:25] in it you can no longer call it an egg
[1:18:31] can you know because it has moved been
[1:18:35] an egg to a chicken in a shell so our
[1:18:41] chicken is in a shell the situation will
[1:18:44] come to a point that it should not also
[1:18:47] love to be in a shell lemon and nobody
[1:18:54] breaks the shell for it it has its own
[1:18:58] way of breaking the shell you catch it
[1:19:02] now so there must be a condition and I
[1:19:07] know there's a condition coming very
[1:19:08] soon and it's going to break us from
[1:19:11] this body hallelujah and that is all we
[1:19:15] are working for
[1:19:16] yes sir that is going to be a condition
[1:19:19] brothers is that what are you believe it
[1:19:21] or not there is going to be a condition
[1:19:23] and to put us into a trouble and I said
[1:19:27] this body who break oh yes and you know
[1:19:41] what when a woman is pregnant

[1:19:50] months is a noted so first month second
[1:19:55] month Ted man fourth Matt fifth man
[1:20:00] cysmart seventh month eight month nine
[1:20:10] mind you realize the Prophet said it the
[1:20:17] condition of the woman would change so
[1:20:21] when when she is ready to bring forth
[1:20:26] the child say the spirit of the child
[1:20:29] comes upon the woman amen so at that
[1:20:36] time the woman is being controlled by
[1:20:39] the spirit college that is the condition
[1:20:44] so the child who say mummy

[1:21:28] to check out hallelujah amen and amen
[1:21:33] praise be to the name of our God
[1:21:36] hallelujah sometimes when I think about
[1:21:40] our Lord Jesus Christ himself in the
[1:21:44] Garden of Gethsemane or brother system
[1:21:48] when was time for him to go to the cross
[1:21:49] the Bible said that he went and prayed
[1:21:52] Oh father he will be a desire let this
[1:22:00] cup pass over me but not my will but
[1:22:04] dying he went to a travail and he prayed
[1:22:09] until the Bible say that his sweat even
[1:22:13] turned to blood it wasn't easy he wanted
[1:22:19] a travel brother because of you and I
[1:22:23] he was preparing to go to the cross to
[1:22:25] die and cleanse us from our sins

[1:23:16] to much Pilate no you are opening your
[1:23:20] mouth too much

[1:23:34] don't have power over me

[1:25:38] Tabernacle he said I am NOT talking
[1:25:40] about this our Tabernacle but I'm
[1:25:43] talking about a thing that I've seen
[1:25:45] around the United States go to some
[1:25:48] places those things Emma and the
[1:25:55] buildings will begin to shake praise God

[1:26:30] weight that is what put me in a minute
[1:26:39] he says the love is dying away but
[1:26:44] tongue God we will never allow the love
[1:26:45] to die away hallelujah because we are
[1:26:49] born upon the word of God we always shop
[1:26:54] in our Christmas I was telling the
[1:26:56] Brethren that back home we our furnace
[1:27:00] what they do is that there's not there's
[1:27:03] not much mechanized farming they used a
[1:27:05] strength you know so it would fit
[1:27:08] forests like this you go and see a
[1:27:10] farmer using just a cutlass and we did
[1:27:13] around we didn't arrive before he you
[1:27:15] know break the roots that the trees down
[1:27:18] and then you Bennett after all but you
[1:27:21] know what it is such that the moment it
[1:27:25] comes from the farm many of them become
[1:27:28] a shopping via via catalyst on a spoon
[1:27:32] okay the shutting it so when he is going
[1:27:37] to the front the next time you only grab
[1:27:38] it and go and our salt is the weight and
[1:27:44] a stone which happy not is our sole that
[1:27:48] is what we must always come and shopping
[1:27:50] our sort so that anywhere we are our
[1:27:55] sort look shop amen I would be yes sir
[1:28:05] he said look at it not only here but a
[1:28:08] well over the ten is polluted and the
[1:28:11] world the nature or God have mercy the
[1:28:15] whole world in it bad pains the world is
[1:28:19] trying she is traveling even the world
[1:28:22] is traveling the world is service
[1:28:25] traveling is it that is what they are
[1:28:27] planning always to to bring better life
[1:28:30] to the people but the more they try to
[1:28:33] do that
[1:28:34] the more
[1:28:35] but condition the world fund itself so
[1:28:39] the ones that we naturally look today
[1:28:42] having machine is afraid of the other is
[1:28:46] allotted America is afraid of Rajaraja
[1:28:47] so for America Yemen is a little
[1:28:50] Germany's are afraid of Britain
[1:28:52] Britain's afraid of Germany perhaps
[1:28:55] Brazil is afraid of Argentina the nash's
[1:29:01] every nation
[1:29:01] everybody is careful of what you are
[1:29:04] doing because the afraid of each other
[1:29:07] that is the condition that the world has
[1:29:10] fun its itself hallelujah so that is a
[1:29:13] reason we are in a travel Christ to
[1:29:18] bring forth the bride
[1:29:20] everything is travelling and groaning
[1:29:22] there is something fixing to happen here
[1:29:27] then there are some defects into rapid
[1:29:31] we found out in gems of the five
[1:29:33] assisting that the Bible said the
[1:29:35] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:29:39] person advil at much when a righteous
[1:29:42] man a good man gets in trouble or so
[1:29:47] trouble
[1:29:47] oh my indiscretion that effectual
[1:29:55] fervent prayer that man can show that
[1:30:00] cooking it does it does always because
[1:30:06] he is in at reveal hallelujah
[1:30:10] oh brother you remember them when they
[1:30:14] were preparing to leave Egypt the Bible
[1:30:17] say that they act the Passover in haste
[1:30:23] in case they were in a travel to Lee
[1:30:27] okay
[1:30:29] and given the description of the meet
[1:30:34] the person and also donating water put
[1:30:38] it directly on the on the on the fire
[1:30:41] okay so that the the circle get direct
[1:30:46] heat from the fire we are a sacrifice
[1:30:50] today we should allow ourselves to be
[1:30:54] put on the holy spirit putting the fire
[1:30:58] to bring everything that is contrary to
[1:31:02] God's Word out from us
[1:31:06] everything must drop the fire must
[1:31:09] consume every negative things in our
[1:31:12] lives
[1:31:14] hallelujah because we are in a travel
[1:31:19] and when Jesus Christ was talking about
[1:31:22] the human in looks of the 18 he says
[1:31:25] there was an unjust judge and there was
[1:31:28] a widow who always go to this man to
[1:31:32] avenge her and the man was not ready to
[1:31:36] hurt the woman but it is not discourage
[1:31:39] the woman because the condition of the
[1:31:42] woman put her in a state of travail
[1:31:45] he says well this man is ready to help
[1:31:48] me or not he is the only one that I know
[1:31:51] can help me so she continued going to
[1:31:55] this man until it came to attack the man
[1:31:58] himself could not help it say let me
[1:32:01] having this man listen he worried me and
[1:32:04] he did exactly what the woman wanted
[1:32:09] Jesus Christ will he have faith Winokur
[1:32:13] will he have faith will he have a Hooley
[1:32:18] see people on duty who listen people
[1:32:21] traveling for the course of
[1:32:23] righteousness and I believe yes he will
[1:32:28] because you are here and I am here
[1:32:33] amen amen Oh hallelujah
[1:32:37] George of assisting in closing now
[1:32:43] George of the Sistine
[1:32:51] I think that's 21 yeah a woman when she
[1:33:01] is in travail her solo because they
[1:33:04] always come but as soon as she is
[1:33:08] delivered of the child she remembered no
[1:33:11] more the anguish for joy that a man is
[1:33:15] born into the world in through the
[1:33:24] hustle the disappointments the
[1:33:26] frustrations and all will be over very
[1:33:31] soon you not even you do not even
[1:33:33] remember then again but this is another
[1:33:36] period that must go through these things
[1:33:41] not always that is who go the way you
[1:33:44] want it it is not always that you see
[1:33:48] everything is blossoming brother-sister
[1:33:51] know that's the reality but that
[1:33:54] shouldn't take our fate away from us
[1:33:56] we must go we can go through hardship
[1:34:00] but we should always remember that the
[1:34:02] Lord has a promise for us they say he
[1:34:04] will not leave us he will not leave us
[1:34:08] he will always be with us
[1:34:13] amen
[1:34:14] so when the woman bring forth after that
[1:34:17] depth that travel or after a bad phase
[1:34:19] she forgot she forgot what she was going
[1:34:22] through is not true or not which woman
[1:34:27] who bring food and would like to bring
[1:34:29] forth again if they don't forget that
[1:34:35] thing the pace do you think the Buddha
[1:34:39] can sell one another child no no nobody
[1:34:44] would do that I don't want to go to that
[1:34:47] place again
[1:34:48] but God took those pains away
[1:34:52] and that is exactly what we are going
[1:34:56] through very soon brother sister who
[1:35:01] forgets all our frustrations he may and
[1:35:08] Jesus said the generation does see the
[1:35:16] fig tree having her lives that
[1:35:20] generation shall not pass according to
[1:35:25] Matthew chapter 24

[1:35:36] trumpet and they shall gather together
[1:35:39] his elect from the four winds from one
[1:35:42] end of heaven to the other and that is
[1:35:46] that trumpet that has gone forth and all
[1:35:49] the elect have been brought back to
[1:35:53] where they're supposed to be Oh

[1:35:57] he's from one end of heaven to the other

[1:36:14] things know that it is me even add a
[1:36:17] pause verily I say unto you this
[1:36:20] generation shall not pass till all these
[1:36:23] things be fulfilled and a fig tree we
[1:36:29] know what it stands for is a
[1:36:32] degeneration that we see that that
[1:36:36] generation will not pass this generation
[1:36:40] of sin the restoration of Jerusalem back
[1:36:42] to the Jews the generation will not pass
[1:36:48] hallelujah and all be fulfilled for
[1:36:52] brother my sister I just want to

[1:37:51] god bless all of you tonight I promise
[1:37:54] Barbara summer to come and sing for us
[1:37:56] ah that's beautiful song on a hill far
[1:38:00] away yes
[1:38:19] Oh bless us and well sing for me
[1:38:32] and that wonderful you know you want to
[1:38:44] you look at many times there's been
[1:38:46] situations sometimes it's been quite
[1:38:49] comical where you have people that will
[1:38:51] call maybe they're in a city or
[1:38:53] somewhere and they say I'm lost and the
[1:38:56] first thing that the person on the other
[1:38:58] end of the phone will ask them where are
[1:39:00] you the first thing they want to know
[1:39:05] because they know if you can tell them
[1:39:09] where you're at how to how to get out of
[1:39:12] there
[1:39:13] so then when people say I don't know
[1:39:16] where I'm at
[1:39:17] then they start asking them what do you
[1:39:20] see around you and when they start
[1:39:25] looking at things that they'll see
[1:39:27] around them they'll say well I see
[1:39:29] there's a gas station over here okay
[1:39:31] what kind of a gas station is it well
[1:39:33] it's a BP gas station and then okay so
[1:39:36] what do you see further on down and
[1:39:38] they'll start to describe it and then
[1:39:40] they'll maybe what do you see directly
[1:39:41] across the street so all of these
[1:39:43] surroundings they begin to describe it
[1:39:46] to the person on the other end and once
[1:39:48] the other person on the other end can
[1:39:50] then start to pick it up and say okay
[1:39:52] now directly across from that BP maybe
[1:39:55] to the southwest is there a store like a
[1:39:58] convenience store and they turn on yeah
[1:40:00] yeah yeah okay this is where you're at
[1:40:03] if you'll drive just a little bit this
[1:40:04] is the street you should see some of
[1:40:08] you're looking at me like I'm the guy
[1:40:09] who's done this before but you
[1:40:12] understand what it is is that you may
[1:40:15] not know when you would look for where
[1:40:17] you and I were at there's no way in the
[1:40:21] world that we knew where we were at in
[1:40:24] the Word of God but to be able to look
[1:40:28] and see where we are in God's Word it
[1:40:34] takes the Lord Himself to come on the
[1:40:37] scene and to open our eyes to the things
[1:40:41] that we're seeing
[1:40:42] and when you begin to look at everything
[1:40:45] and you know I just was sitting back
[1:40:46] there tonight I just just so you know
[1:40:48] it's just tremendous how God it just
[1:40:50] continues to move upon your heart you
[1:40:52] look at every one of the things that in
[1:40:55] this hour of what God has brought to you
[1:40:57] and I and spoken to us think of even the
[1:41:00] title of the message your day and it's
[1:41:03] message and think back to the text
[1:41:06] that's used for that message is that of
[1:41:08] how Hosea right there is to learn a
[1:41:11] parable of the fig tree so it's to see
[1:41:14] what God is doing there is to recognize
[1:41:18] what God has been doing and is doing
[1:41:21] within our lives you realize right now
[1:41:24] this completion of the work coming into
[1:41:27] it's completion and finish in our life
[1:41:30] is a testimony she's coming it is a
[1:41:34] testimony of what God is doing in
[1:41:37] spiritual Zion of what's going to happen
[1:41:39] there in the natural Zion in that
[1:41:41] wonderful what a day that we're living
[1:41:44] in what an hour what a time to be in
[1:41:47] this moment we are living in the coming
[1:41:50] of the Lord we are living in the
[1:41:53] fulfillment of that moment what a day
[1:41:55] what a day amen let's stand and let's
[1:41:58] sing that song on a hill far away stood
[1:42:03] I think all drug across
[1:42:11] on a hill far away stood an old rugged
[1:42:20] cross fee
[1:42:26] of suffering
[1:42:29] [Music]
[1:42:34] and I love that
[1:42:40] we're the dearest and
[1:42:47] for a world of lost sinner's
[1:42:53] first was
[1:42:56] [Music]
[1:42:58] and so I'll cherish the old rugged cross
[1:43:07] till my trophies sign last time
[1:43:19] oh yes I will

[1:48:30] I thought about brother branham as he
[1:48:34] said this to give that dramatization to
[1:48:38] us from that story he said I was sitting
[1:48:40] into the parking lot and help came up
[1:48:42] came a young man and the young man
[1:48:45] knocked on his door and said Jomon for
[1:48:47] just a moment
[1:48:49] acknowledged the young man and he said
[1:48:52] he began to kind of talk to brother
[1:48:54] about him a little bit about his
[1:48:56] situation and he said I'm as lost as a
[1:49:01] loss can be good brother bana made this
[1:49:05] great declaration he said you don't have
[1:49:09] to stay that way you don't have to stay
[1:49:13] there one of the greatest things is to
[1:49:16] reach out to help because he is not far
[1:49:20] off he's right there he's right there
[1:49:24] you can begin to say Lord Jesus all of
[1:49:27] this what I sense what I feel what I see
[1:49:30] and he lets you know this is right where
[1:49:32] you're at this is how I'm dealing with
[1:49:34] your life all you have to do is
[1:49:36] surrender follow the path of life the
[1:49:39] directions what I've given to you and
[1:49:41] you'll come out in this wonderful in
[1:49:46] reality this is what God has made away
[1:49:49] for you and I'm all mine you've heard
[1:49:52] that saying sometimes lost more loss
[1:49:55] than a needle in a haystack
[1:49:56] but I'm glad that you and I though we
[1:49:59] were lost and you realize you realize in
[1:50:01] order to be lost you belong to somebody
[1:50:05] you belong to somebody
[1:50:08] like my glasses I cannot lose my glasses
[1:50:11] unless they are my glasses like when you
[1:50:14] ask your wife or your husband or ask
[1:50:16] someone and say honey have you seen this
[1:50:20] what are you asking for you're asking
[1:50:23] for what it is that belongs to you and
[1:50:26] you and I were lost but we've been found
[1:50:33] we've been found it just like the woman
[1:50:37] who was sweeping the house looking for
[1:50:40] the coins that she knew that belonged to
[1:50:44] her she was sweeping the house making
[1:50:47] sure because she knew her husband and
[1:50:50] her husband was returning and she said I
[1:50:53] need to make sure I find these coins
[1:50:56] from my tablet because he's coming back
[1:50:59] she knew they were somewhere in her
[1:51:01] house she was sweeping it's so real in
[1:51:06] it that the rapture itself is a sweep
[1:51:09] and the sweep is for the sweepers the
[1:51:15] sweep is for the sweepers is making
[1:51:19] ready for his coming this is all all
[1:51:24] made possible by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:27] so no matter where you're at tonight you
[1:51:29] you might feel like that's a real saying
[1:51:31] I'm just starting out that in itself
[1:51:34] doesn't matter what you need to
[1:51:36] recognize is keep going and allow him
[1:51:40] that starts the work in you to finish it
[1:51:43] and let that be your focus of everything
[1:51:46] let it be more than life just like for
[1:51:51] those who were Christ has moved into the
[1:51:53] depths of our life he's more than life
[1:51:55] to us this is what we're looking for is
