TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that but it's something that's going on there's a shout there's a voice as a trump when we were looking at adoption adoption is model clear back from Jesus Christ we see adoption in Christ we see adoption in the sons and daughters of God and we see adoption in the church and I'll come back to how I know just laid a lot out there but I'll go ahead and qualify this in a moment amen but when we look at Jesus Christ brother Ben talks about God's masterpiece and he had a masterpiece it was so perfect he had to smile him is that right he smoked that master precinct right out speak is that right and why was he smoked that God could have another masterpiece amen now it's not a different look or a different spirit is that right it's different bodies different parts of the earth but it's the same spirit amen just like in the original atom though evil was a separate body though she was a byproduct as far as the creation was concerned yet brother BAM says it was the self same spirit and so today we've received not just the spirit of a holy man or have a prophet but of the only begotten Son of God a son of God that come to an adoption now listen when he was born he's born a son is that right I didn't become a son when the Holy Ghost come down in the river Jordan but he was always a son is that Alright but when the Holy Ghost come down on the river Jordan through a prophet he identified him as a son and then now Jesus is always a son but not he's identified thou aren't my son Andrew Lyon please supply a man so the Holy Ghost comes to identify his sonship that he already has is that right description tells us that the Holy Ghost comes to us for the same reason because we are sons the Bible says God has sent his spirit unto us whereby we cry Abba Father and there would be one thing to just say that God's your father said nothing when the Holy Ghost comes into the human heart and he bears witness he is giving us a voice in a generation when other voices are speaking we've got every kind of opinion and every kind of politics never kind of yeah there's a voice of God in this generation and he is coming to Claire not that you will be not that you could be now are we the sons of God do you want to wait years and not recognize it yet you were a son your daughter that's who you always were but when the Holy Ghost comes he brings an identification this is my son this is my daughter they might not look like much to the world they might not look like a great somebody or be esteemed in the halls of Congress but in the eyes of God they're perfect God sees that photo he took you before the world again we many times we were looking at the wrong thing hey man we're looking at our flash and we're trying to be made perfect and the Apostle Paul says in Galatians 2 if you've begun the spirit are you now going to be made perfect or mature in the flesh I miss you we try to we try to fix this pest house it's not your job to fix it it's your job to outgrow it it's your job to mortify it and then we're gonna put off this thing I'm not taking this with me but that thing that God put on the inside is gonna change the atoms and quicken this mortal body and get shall be swallowed up in life corruption shall put on incorruption amen now we're talking about Christ as a son when we look at the book of Galatians the third fourth chapters it tells you what was the purpose of the law it was a schoolmaster we were we were just doing our home school the other day and we were studying my wife was doing the history of the Greek culture and the Athenians when they're sent come of age he received what's called a pedagogue or a child instructor or what the King James calls a schoolmaster and his job was to oversee the learning of that child he wasn't to oversee everybody's learning he had one child and he oversaw his learning and no matter what his curriculum was or what he thought was taught it was the duty of this of the pedagogue or the schoolmaster to make sure he was being trained right in whatever it is he's supposed to be training and so for the RAM talks about how we have a schoolmaster like that brother man says this is spiritual adoption he said I'd rather have a man that didn't know his ABCs to teach my child that had the Holy Spirit then all the professors in the world that didn't have the Holy Spirit for he speaks of the Father and the Holy Spirit speaks of the father and then it'll teach the child one not to be tossed about with every wind of doctrine as I read the scripture says don't be children tossed to and fro he's trying to bring you to a place where I this person says this about the message this person says that about the Bible and we can stand there and say that go loves me I'm not shaking up listen brothers and sisters there's a lot of nonsense I've received a kingdom it can't be moved you don't pray because I'd rather have that I'm not saying you can't learn your ABC he's not saying that I'd rather have a man that knew what the mind of the father was then to have the rest if you had to choose just one amen hey man he said that tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine but they accept and believe the principles that the father has laid down now the Bible as I was saying here in Galatians 3 and 4 it's telling us if you read through it that the law was a schoolmaster or a teacher and at first it seems like it's saying something different than what the prophets saying but I want you to understand Paul is speaking to a group of Jews about the Jewish dispensation they were given the law as a teacher or a schoolmaster until the fullness of time had come and then what does God knew he sends his son notice he's born of a woman born under the law the Bible says so when Christ when he comes he's born under a law or he has that as a schoolmaster amen so even though he comes to the Jordan River even though the Holy Ghost comes down he lives a life subject to the law of Moses why the show that are you sinless the show that he had come into full obedience is that right though he were a son yet learned he obedience through the things he suffered and being made perfect amen amen being napery he becomes the author of eternal salvation amen so there comes a day we're familiar hopefully whether the Prophet says but under that dispensation he comes to Mount Transfiguration one day and God takes him up there on the mountain with Peter James and John and the cloud overshadowed and testifies now listen the Holy Ghost has already testified that this is a son of God and then he's gonna but he's gonna do two things up here one he's going to reaffirm the witness this is my son but now he's going to give a commandment or a commission with that he says this is my beloved son hear ye him and then in other words now he's come to a position where he can enact the father's business here's a name on the checkbook it's as good as mine and then his de because his name is the family name it's the whole name by which the family of heaven on earth his name amen this is why after the Transfiguration he goes down to Jerusalem and he begins to speak to his disciples and he says henceforth he asked nothing in my name but now I want you to ask in my name and I will pray the father and he will give it to him why what happens his name what does the Bible tell us that he by an inheritance has what obtained a more excellent name than the Angels he men so was not just gifted but as an inheritance now I want to serve in the Bible tells us in Galatians 4:1 an heir is a child he differs nothing from the servant there's no distinction there though he's a son that he's been identified he's playing with the servants and he looks the same and he he serves the will of the Father he comes to maturity he gets an inheritance he's identifying the father plates and he places him as a son he gives him a position and he shows this is my son he's his name I can either give him a signet ring I think they talked about and the old testement to give them a ring because they couldn't all right and you take that ring and you stamp that paper whatever that's as good as the father doing it cause it's the same name so notice my virtue of his adoption he receives a name which is above every other name and then he tells his church or his disciples I want you when you pray to pray in this thing because there's an authority that's greater than everything in heaven on earth every other name is subject to this name and so when you're praying you're praying in the name of an adopted son Jesus Christ he has the authority a men that's why he could say when he returns that all power is given to me in heaven and earth now one should consider that for a second he says all part of that means he he left nothing off and man there's nothing that you're going through today there's no circumstance in your life or things in your past that are above the name of Jesus Christ and it's the family name and so he's trying to impart sonship now notice what Jesus is crucified at Calvary then it's not just a son of God on the cross it's an adopted son of God on the cross that's why the Bible Romans 8 says that we receive what the spirit of adoption so we're not just receiving a spirit but the spirit that was in him an adopted son of God has come back and become the teacher or the schoolmaster not just to the Jew but also to the Greek that's my Paul can say in the second book or second chapter of Romans that they that didn't have a lot they had become a law unto themselves through what through the circumcision not made with hands by the Holy Ghost or the spirit of adoption and then I just think God you know brother branham's listen to him in adoption how about mule religion a man it's for the meal he don't know his mommy is you don't know who his daddy is he says but he's a hard worker that's the only thing he's got known for he's a hard worker he can work harder than the rest me says a real thoroughbred he said this the thing with me you gotta beat him all the time you gotta be there you gotta beat him they're looking they're gonna make him work and then that's about how many Old Religion is amen what I gotta make them do this and don't steal don't kill no I you gotta tell me you gotta force him you gotta make them but a real thoroughbred he did crack the whip once and off they go it's not what I write it is and then Prince I thank God that I don't have to get up here and beat people just serve God but there's a law in their heart that's written that will make them serve go further than stony tables could ever produce listen I thank God for Mosley thank God for those tables that were written on my side of it that could never produce the life but the spirit in Christ the life of Christ can produce the law of love the law of Christ in the heart of believer so now it's come by the spirit that's the law of life amen and that's what we own today that's why it's a tutor or a schoolmaster for us same in the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord so the spirit of adoption as I said Paul said because you are sons he's given to you his spirit a minute so we talked about this in Christ Christ is born he's a son he comes of the River Jordan he received the Holy Ghost but there comes a time of maturity or adoption because every son must be proved when he comes to God Amen everyone God always has a time-tested memorial God's not slack in his business he's not careless no matter who it is no matter who we are he's got to test the material that's in that memorial and if he did it in Christ he's going to do it enough amen so now notice he does it this way he identify him and then adopts him he learned obedience through the things that he suffers amen my mom so now this is an adopted son of God as I said he's yield up his spirit this couldn't happen under Moses it could not happen under Isaiah it had to be the life that was in Melchizedek the life of God was the only thing that could bring this a spirit of adoption amen now what you think about this because Ephesians 1:5 talks about the adoption of sons we've been predestinated we use that word a lot how many's predestinated and you all raise your hand well hopefully you do I mean people are doing their predestinated where's the hand see anywhere here but you know how some people don't like that we're predestination brother in sense but it's in the Bible we talk often about being predestinated but what are we predestinated - that'd be like me sent on the air on the air what is the air of I'm the air of you know you could be there of Trump Tower you could be the air of my bank account that has two different connotations altogether hey man what we're Aries look free destined unto what Ephesians 1:5 tells you are you've been predestinated unto the adoption of sons that's what your predestination is I said the book of Romans says then that he foreknew he predestinated to be conformed to what the image of his son up adopted a predestined son amen so much the most predestination your your destination or your dusties predetermined and we think about that often but many times we fail to look at what is it we've been predestinated - unto maturity under this perfection listen God left something for us in this age hey man is that right the bucket the book of Hebrews tells you about J pepsin Simpson all these different ones and the Bible says that they though they had faced a man yet they died because God had left something better for us that they without us should not be made perfect so I'm coming out of the Church of God or the body of Christ amen because I want you to think about this today your identification we talked about being the Bride of Christ and then I'm not the bride of Christ and you're not but we as a body or the Bride of Christ amen it's not individual brides it's one bride it's a body and so how God treats his church or his bride is different than how he treats you as a son or daughter it's an individual affair he grows his church but he grows individuals within that church the same way so God's pattern never changes they men so we look at the book of Romans 8:23 and it tells us there's an adoption as to it the redemption of the body he's talking about the changing of the body but Paul talks about in the Bible for Scruton is 15 and in 1st Thessalonians 4 they that are asleep in Christ God suffering with amen and then we which are alive I mean we'll be caught up in there will be changed in a moment or the twinkling of an eye it's the redemption of the body and I like to throw this in here real quick Paul says it's the redemption of the body not bodies but one body the whole body is redeemed at once now you each get new bodies in it which is great it's like I said I'm tired of this pest house but it's the redemption of the body of Christ his church or what is now called his bride hey man praise the Lord he got over seven churches and I hope well probably settled on this all right so I'm looking to lay this out real quick because you shall probably know this I'm sure but God through the Holy Ghost he is well didn't want by the spirit of adoption he's building a church through seven Church ages amen so we know that about the church is faith virtue knowledge time you look at these things what he's doing he's building a body of Christ amen praise the Lord now they were given promises the Bible says that we are partakers of the divine nature how many knows how you particular to my nature second Peter tells you how through his exceeding great and precious promises so the promise for your day determines what the nature of God is that you partake of if you lived in Wesley's day you'd have been a partaker under the message of Wesley on the sanctification but we've come to an age of the fullness the Prophet does it's the capstone prophetic ministry in other words the same adopted son that died and rose again his headship has come down you're not partaking of just a measure but the fullness of the revealed word that's why I probably could say this message is Christ because when you partake to this message the only thing it can produce is Christ it has to produce adopted sons and daughters of God he come through Luther he'd come through us say but maturity or adoption wasn't for their age it's for the end time it's for this hour you've got something great or not that doesn't leave off justification but you've got something later justification has done something It's Made away the problems a justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of Holy Ghost and many people stop there with the problems that the baptism the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost at south to come in perfection he said what are you talking I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit but he said what do you mean what's the difference it's one thing to be born it's another thing to produce a child and that's one thing to be born again nothing to reproduce the light of Christ in its maturity listen a child can't reproduce that life it takes a mature son or daughter and so what we're looking for is that the original seed and spoken word it's the original seed there's a separation that comes between the shock or the Pentecostal amen amen now the capstone it comes it comes down with what crimes of grace grace romances it's a rapturing grace for the perfecting of the church amen in other words he's going to produce it listen you can't produce the changing of a lot amen would it be nice to go to the doctor if you could have such a such amount of money and big twenty years old again you that are older than that some of you know my son would be okay he'd be ready to go drive well either you let her own or wouldn't be ready to go to that now listen you you're getting enough money you can go to plastic surgery and you can bow top you can do all these things but you can't change the body it's the work of God is that right it's something that God is going to do in his church in the ordained yet for a certain season it couldn't happen under looser it couldn't happen under Wesley it couldn't even happen under the Pentecostals but when the maturity of the capstone has come because the only perfect love can produce this that will produce the changing of a body it's the Holy Ghost itself in perfection amen praise the Lord it's the culmination of the of the adoption of the church there's an adoption for the church or the body of Christ and it comes at the end time under a prophetic ministry and then there had to be something to bring it all together to top loose ends and brothers and sisters I believe we're here today I'm not looking for it to come I'm gonna ask if it's gonna be another but I believe that the same Elijah that same spiritus that part of the Jordan River that same spirit that was in John the Baptist that same spirit is coming our generation that same spirit by the Holy Ghost he spoke as squirrels in the existence he moved back storms he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart I believe we've had a prophet messenger brother William Branham it's come to fulfill the adoption of the body of Christ there's only one prophesied to come it couldn't be another it didn't come by me or by you but it comes from God through his ordained vessel the Bible tells that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now what you think about it he didn't say every word of God everyone that proceeds out of the mouth of God because God has a mouthpiece and when the Prophet tells the churches today they've become their own mouthpiece they speak to their own spirit they speak of themselves but there's got to be a mouth on the voice of the earth for you to partake of the warning out there's got to be a mouth or a voice somewhere that declares every word of God and I believe he's already spoken and I believe he's speaking again because the spirit the bride under there messenger will be the final voice to the final age what is the voice speaking his I'm just speaking about blessings he's not just speaking my justification he's speaking about adoption the changing of a body he's speaking about the maturity of the sons and the daughters of God amen so I thank God for profit where would we be I think so many times we'd be trying to figure it out and we'd be there's so many denominations amen I get in trouble for saying that some places then that's like climate change or whatever they were for well first it was a global warming that was cooling whatever it is and they give you this now and I'm not against pollution or for or whatever I'm against pollution I'm not making a political point but here's what I'm trying to say they give you this line 97% of scientists believe in this I'm thinking you can't get 97% of anybody to believe anything unless you tell them the skies blue or something and even there to get some smart Moscow to argue it's ready right now all right whatever you can't get that many people to agree on anything if I take tenure here and ask you what you want on your pizza I'll get 10 different answers hey man how are we gonna come from the charity is that right what was the purpose the Bible toasting Ephesians 4 God gives some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry - we all come into the unity of the faith not a faith or a cream the unity of the faith this is not something that you can produce that's the Catholic chick what we all need to be one not that kind of one but the oneness that can only come from the voice of God in a final generation only God can bring that to pass I can't bring it to pass you can't bring you the past with the Spirit of God in you it's the same spirit that was in a prophet as the same that was in Wesley that was in Paul that Spirit can bring it to pass he said how do you know cuz he's doing it right now he's doing through the message of the hour hey man see God gives them gifts is that right I want you to think about that first begotten son hey man think about Christ where the rest is God's wrapped gift and then he was a wrap gift is for the people messin about if somebody loves you and they give me a gift listen if a father to son asks for bread he ain't gonna give him a stone amen if he asked for for uh for an egg he gonna give him a scorpion if you ask for fishing give him a serpent all right if he gives you a gift it's for your good that's of that rat gift no he was despised by the world no one was calling there is above and the Ellen legitimate child and every other kind of name why because it didn't look like what they were looking for see it was God's wrapped gift he was wrapped in the manger the swaddling cloth listen that gift was wrapped in humanity that's why they couldn't see it amen listen you couldn't see the lives but you can see this flesh which declares it programs that you've never seen me and you'll never see me but you've seen this body which declares the life think about that you've never seen it I've never seen you but we've seen the life though we've known Christ after the flesh yeah henceforth we know him no more we know no man after the flesh see that was the problem they were looking at the man hands and said well I thought he was gonna do this and I thought he's gonna come be a Pharisee or be a Sadducee or tear down the Roman government God's wrapped gifts hey man imagine if I come up to you and I said hey I bought your gift brother I got a box I can't to you and my wrapping job's about like this it looks like a three you'll push together the flaps are sticking up most tape everywhere put a little bow on there it's got like hair and glue and macaroni noodles sticking on it you get that gift you say I don't want to ask this looks terrible I'm not taking the gifts because of what they're wrapping paper looks like and then you take the gift because of what's on the inside they say that person loves me and would've give me a guest it's what's on the inside that determines the value you've got the wrapping paper not on the outside and people they look at Christ as a man and they said well that's an illegitimate child that's a that's the son of Joseph that's a carver and their son that's why they couldn't see the gift what does the gift of not it's eternal life they took eternal life and hung it on a cross because they couldn't see what was on the inside of God's wrapped gift it's all they've done in this generation God sent us a wrap gift in that you know and then there's a gif that come down to the Church of God 19 online I like home over the crew and testified not that he's the son of Charles Ella Branham not that he's a bootlegger Samantha needs a Kentuckian the light come to testify this is my gift to this generation this time not just talking about the discernment I'm talking with the life of Christ before he was in the belly before he was formed he was our digging the prophet to the nation's see it's God's gift to us I can you imagine go up someone gives you that gift you reject all you are but I'd be a little upset I wouldn't spend a lot of money to pull us off I got you this gift because I wrapped it like a three-year-old you don't want it you're just gonna tear it off anyway it's not made to last listen this thing's not made to last why do you worry about it so much it's what's on the inside [Applause] why my listen when crisis center he give gifts unto men it's for your dead I mean not look at the outside don't look at your hey man the humanity look at what it's come to produce its come to produce a unity in the faith one Lord one baptism one faith one God and Father of all who is above us all and through us on in you all Haemon education cannot produce this unity Amen a man's intelligence cannot produce this unity a man's charisma or psychology cannot produce this unity it's impossible with men with men these things are impossible but with God but with God all things are possible one what's he coming to do with the Bible says to bring us into the stature of the fullness of Christ into a perfect name amen not perfect men not perfect sons ours he's talking with the body now one a perfect man that's why prophet is saying it is the rising of the Sun that she has now she is bone of his bone of his word spirit of his spirit powers power she is him they're no longer Twain they're one they've been united by an invisible Union by a marriage covenant the United that's what produces the unity there one spirit yeah it's come to brings into the stature of the fullness of Christ it's Christ amen that's why I said the message is Christ if you receive God's wrapped gift because you can't separate the messenger from the message if you receive God's wrapped gift and what it has to say into your heart it will produce the same thing it asks you because every seed brings forth after its own kind how many have claimed or they say or they associate with the message and that's being able to read but once you receive that gift into your heart it can only produce Christ in other words it's predestinated to come to Christ it has to amen why that we're not children tossed to and fro by everyone to doctrine that's why I said when critics they get all whatever in this now I'm not shaking by that stuff because every something received something greater than a man's opinion I received something rather than just a good teaching I have received a kingdom that cannot be moved objects is that right that's my Paul could say that none of these things move me results familiar friends that turned away didn't move him he knew in whom he had believed he was persuaded there was no height depth nothin present nothing that could poke nothing could separate that man nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus because it's progressive because of the seed hey man so that's what I'm saying I'm not shaking by I know what the gift of God wasn't my generation cuz I know they'd give me it did what I could not do you can testify this one God has done something in your life your mommy couldn't move daddy couldn't do psychology couldn't do a preacher couldn't do God has done something in your life only God could do and you know is gone and you're not was the message you know what you're talking about you know where you're standing you're on Christ you can't be shaking off of it you plant your feet on the rock he brought you out of the miry clay and set your feet on the rocks when everything's falling apart and the words falling apart you receive the kingdom you're not falling down you're rising up you lift it off the face of the earth not toss to throw we're not you're not all this other stuff this madness and this message will not condemn the Church of the Living God who condemn what calls itself church but it's not coming to destroy God's people it's not coming to cast them off it's not come to give them a partial victory and a hopes on the maybe it has come to reproduce the fullness of Christ in people in this generation not another generator not another message to come in this age if they don't do what this says there's no other one to come it has to be this age hey man his faith his virtue his tent knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness greater he was looking at last Doorly but now the light or the vindication has come to reveal its to sing Christ oh my all his power of his glory so he ordains nothing less for us has about it hidden the manifestation of Christ in his people no sass his church is that right predestinated individuals that come to the Holy Ghost and they're identified as sons and daughters the church is identified in every age the message is identified the true church and the false because every revival produces twins so the Word of God comes to make a distinction or a separation amen so he's identified the virtue he changed the promise to be changed that his true church he distinguishes now you and I couldn't do that but at the end time according to Matthew 13 it was prophesied that the wheat and the tares they would come to a maturity and in the maturity he makes a distinction listen Wes Eden knows they Luther in Calamba but in this age the voice has identified the true and the false it shows you it's the maturing time because it can't be identified until the maturity hey man so what's the difference between the world and us hey man let's see you're not different because you're smarter than the next person you're not different because you were born into a certain natural home or even because you go to a certain church but what makes you different it's the leadership of God in your life progresses this morning church change says you see the one difference between Israel and the rest of the nations was God put God to one side in Israel was just like any other news listen that's that's why I don't get about these these men maybe they want to preach the message and walk away I said the message made you who you were yeah you think well I can preach without it you have nothing without it you're just like the rest of the world listen I'm not up here that because I'm just so eloquent we're so clever I studied so well God made the difference you're not here today because you're just a good socializer urban Pharisee God made the difference that's the only if without God it's just like the rest of the world he said when Samson cut off his hair he was like any other man boss what he says here put the leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with God's name attached to it Shh hey burn somebody we're in the devil anyway it's nothing but the world with his name attached to it the world in the church think about is the world in the church or of the same lump listen your lump of clay ain't no better than your neighbors and it's the same along just like Jacob and Esau for the same parents but the Spirit of God makes the difference I want to touch one again what makes a difference he says the Spirit of God makes the difference but I want you knows that's not the only thing you said he said it's the leadership of the Holy Ghost if you put the leadership aside so it's not just the Holy Ghost or an anointing because there's anointed ones even the false Church has anointings and it has gifts the difference is not just the Spirit of God but it's the leadership of the Spirit of God or the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen Esau and Jacob they're the same lump is that right it's what I said think about is out Esau was not an unbeliever hang there for a second Esau was not an unbeliever King brother Brent said was a believer all right Balaam was a believer he even prophesied he was just as fundamental as Moses the Prophet said but he couldn't follow the leadership and God said I want you to do certain things that I'm gonna do my own thing when God told Cain you'd do what your brother did and I'll receive you he couldn't follow the leadership he refused to follow it see he couldn't learn obedience Christ could learn obedience we can learn obedience but they couldn't comment over obedience why so it's the leadership that makes the difference they might have had a blessing Brill Graham talks about Pentecost Pentecost had the baptism the Holy Ghost he said was a type of Esau they had the birthright but they rejected the birthright they sold out Esau had the birthright at one point Pentecost had him at one point but they so much Esau sold out for a mess of pottage amen they sold out to gift from money or fame or popularity or wandering or whatever it is they used to have something but it's not the n-word but it has moved on in the Church of God but Pentecost what they used to have a type of Esau think about this bro Graham says this everyone talks about I was just reading this it is sounding you read these quotes we were talked about he went down and he visited Elvis Elvis Presley's pastor is they talked to his pastor and they said yeah that boy he got the baptism the Holy Ghost of my church said he spoke in tongues program says what is it see he has he had something he had an experience but his experience lead him to the word he was blessed with a gift and anointing but he couldn't submit it to the leadership of God that makes a statement I want you to think about this when a man has a gift like that or something and they don't submit to God it becomes a curse but I said he sent more son or more people to hell than than a bootlegger Joyner something I got all them little girls tearing off their clothes and this and that what was it something that could have blessed the Church of God but because it wasn't under the leadership of God had become a blight or a curse or a reproach he's also not for mesopause brother and so he sold Judas a lot of thirty pieces of silver elvis produce a lot for a fleet of Cadillacs see somewhere they've got a price though but the Church of God the true believer don't have a price they've already been bought with a price they've already been paid for there's no price you can buy them for they've been redeemed the RAM preaches in California preached a message called leadership and I want you to consider how he says this he says this many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he says that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven what he says no sir you can you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell now this seems contrary to what we're thinking about but what he's talking about he's having an anointing where the Holy Ghost comes onto people why was a prophet say when he preaches anointed once the end time this could not come to this age because this is the age of maturity that endtime anointing could only come in the time of the harvest there's always been false anointed ones but what he's talking about here at the end of time there has to be a maturity or a harvest to bring in time anointing so it's in that season there's false anointing ones they claim they've dropped the back to the hallways they've got gifts they can prophesy they can do all that jesus said they would he said that comes there where we prophesied your name we did mighty miracles we healed the sick we cast out devils he no naam amen the sorceress catch with this this quote the anointing cannot produce a son or daughter of God amen but it's the control tower or the seed the anointing on that will produce a leadership that will produce a son or daughter of God the anointing by itself will always manifest life but the seed determines what kind of life it is I mean if it rains and it's been raining all day if the season started if we're in spring it sort of grown your weeds would grow up just right with all your whatever you're trying to cultivate the anointing always produces a life or maturity but what kind of life is not determined by the anointing but by the seed that falls on hey men program says this and things that are to be he said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is even in there see if she still have the love of the world what to act like the world and do you like the world he said yet you're in church but a cockle burr and the patch with the we shot with the rest of them rejoice with the rest of them all the spiritual blessings is right upon you you say well I promise I so did Caiaphas so did Balaam he says I has nothing he says I got the baptism the Holy Spirit he said that still has nothing to do with it this is powerful watch he says there that's just only a temporal gift for you what he says the real gift is your soul down in there what's the real gift eats your soul down in there see that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the Word of God and the will that's seen the leadership makes the difference not just anointing but the leadership or the obedience when a person is born of God he's there you grow up said I'll call you to go into a son or daughter hey man I'm mature son or daughter hey man there you grow up see then you're a son or daughter of God your child about these things you come up he's like the mother now you're in the bowels of the earth kind of come forth you're a son of God coming forth and you see the word says I should do this I should be born again amen so what he's talking about this this life or the seed he says that's the real gift amen praise the Lord now listen that determines that you were always a son or daughter of God that's what makes the difference a man now when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes he didn't come just to make you speak in tongues although that's fine he didn't come just to make you shout he didn't come just to make you dance he didn't come to make you excited he comes to identify you as a son or daughter God that's what he's come to do today he's identifying you you are now the sons you know the daughters of God that's why can we come with a purpose he didn't just come to entertain us I'll help us people let me never get to a place where were just entertained to be Christians we just come to church to be entertained please come to identify you as a son or a daughter of God now if you're a child if you're a child of God though your son the distinction comes in the maturity amen praise the Lord what's going to produce it the spirit of adoption brings adoption and we talked about adoption in the church what is it it's it's fulfilled in the changing of the body but it's about spiritual adoption Ephesians 1:5 that's not in the rapture sorry honey what listen that's not in the changing of the body that's none the Mullane but before the rapture before your changing the body before these things come to pass there's got to be a spiritual adoption come to church you don't need it in the morning it's not it's this hour right now in this house so how do you know that we've had one come upon a Christmas I won't come to maturity and adopted son of God there's a wave sheaf testified what there's more like him coming right behind it the way she's don't come up in the spring in the rest of the fall it comes up at the time of maturity the Harless we've had an adopted son of God come on the earth and come back and preach the seal to us to let you know this is the hour there's not another one to come this adoption that was prophesied Ephesians 1:5 Romans egg this adoption of the sons of God by the spirit of adoption now is the time it's not out there somewhere else it's not produced by a man's eye these produce right now I see you going for the message believers and you said you believe it's gonna be rapture I believe the shots already come I believe it's taking place right now but you ask them if they can believe for an adoption well I don't know if God could use my god I don't know if I have that kind of character listen I'm not saying if you got faith that there's gonna be a rapture if you're believing that you've got to have faith for a spiritual adoption because one produces the next there's got to be an adopted people he meant somebody the sons and daughters have to come kill my son ship to bring perfection to the rest of the valley what does adoption it's the placing of a sign Amen listen the Holy Ghost when you receive the baptism the Holy Ghost it identified you as a son but the adoption or the placing the son comes you declare your position amen the BAPS of the Holy Ghost declares your position as a part of the body or in the body of Christ but within that body the adoption or the place user shows where you are in that body Amen what your position is in that by just like Joshua Ephesians is paralleled by Joshua when he comes with the people into the Promised Land there in the promised land brother ed said a type of the Holy Ghost there's still Wars Amen somebody listen now they're still getting some ores there's still gonna be some fight you're still gonna have trials but yeah it's your promised land now you're not fighting to get into the Promised One you're fighting for the part that belongs to you this might be my brother's here this and that but I wanna belongs to me I don't want his field I don't want her position God give me like Caleb killed had a possession he knew we belong to him under the prophet Moses and he told Joshua I don't care from 75 I'm just as strong today I'm just as able today I'm just as ready as I was 40 years ago we are still more than able to take the land I don't care if 20 in 30 40 50 years of gone live the spirit of adoption is here he can still take you to your possession it's more than just your promise saying he's come to give you your Mountain it's calmly give you the portion that you are identified with hey before all these things listen I don't need don't need adoption the millennium I don't need a new heavens new earth but now in this hour there's got to be a voice of God that's come to maturity there's got to be sons and daughters of God on the road coming up into a spiritual adoption what is it when their voice is the same as God speaking they've got the sample order that keep still they can speak and when they speak it speaks with an 40 because their name on the check it's just as good as daddy's mama the spirit of adoption is bringing individuals the adoption of sons it's bringing it into the church right now praise the Lord so if you have faith for a rapture you should have faith that God will place you it has to be that okay that's what it's what listen the whole creations waiting on it it's growing a travailing weary our selves are going travailing waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of God hey man we're all it's all waiting on it amen but I probably could say that your birth is not your adoption like I said the birth positions you in the body of Christ but within the body the adoption places you as an individual within the body of Christ amen that's why I said oh it's one thing to be born into a family that's another thing to give birth it's another thing to reproduce the same life in the maturity that's when that comes I only say this way Abraham was told that he would be blessed he would be a blessing a mess one thing to be blessed it's knowing when you become a blessing see the leadership of the Holy Ghost life will make you a blessing unlike Elvis Presley the leadership is what makes you a blessing it's one thing to be in the family something to come to maturity praise the Lord where the RAM says this the servant spiritual adoption are you falling all right I hope hope I'm not trying to go too fast but you could you kid well brother been preached for parts on this you could make this you could do this all day long but just trying to kind of hit the highlights but brother Ram says this is spiritual adopt she said if the child had not been obedient when it becomes of maturity the age of maturity and I want you think about this no matter how old be this would mean that that child is he's growing all the time and man your son becomes 18 whether he's learning to be a man or not he's an adult on the eyes of the law we've got a lot of kids run around 30 40 years old they're still kids they've never that's true you got more room in there now than ever and six I'm gonna get trouble for this one sixteen-year-old boys used to storm a beach the overflowed over fight overthrow tyranny in Germany they used to strongly be sixteen years old I know a man messes preacher he lied when he was a little boy about his age just to go fight the enemy and now you got to give him safe space you don't know what gender he is you don't know this you don't know if he's a boy or girl he's up or down she's a meal I don't know I don't know he is man they're so conceited it's the age it's the spirit of confusion but I want you to remember God is not the author of confusion he's the author of peace there's got to be a voice with the vindicated identification that comes into maturity a man so there's an age of maturity it's not Luthor or Wesley this is the age of maturity it's in the age of maturity you determine whether that sons gonna inherit or not see Pentecost can inherit it fell off Wesley can't hear it Luthor can't inherit all these that they can't inherit but in the age of maturity there's some predestinated sons they're not your legitimate children now but they can they can receive chastisement because it's for their good because it's going to produce the listen let me say this right the leadership of the Holy Ghost will produce the character of Christ character is not a gift it's a victory but the leadership of the Holy Ghost will produce the character of Christ of you that's why when you go through trials you don't respond like the restaurant that's why when you're tempted you can resist temptation the leadership of the Holy Ghost produces the character of Christ he says this and the age maturity says the son is always a son certainly but it loses something and here's the point I want to drive home may the Holy Spirit take it to every heart of you believers just because you're a believer certainly have everlasting life God said so but would you just want to get in as Jobe said by the skin of your teeth what you just want to come before the Father in the town that he's given every one of you as being negligent you just didn't use it or let something else stand your way you let little petty things that meant nothing to you after all little fusses and stews and arguments and church differences take the meekness and gentleness from your life would you want to stand before the father like that he says I don't believe you would I don't believe it you would do it neither would i amen see they could get away when a child I was using this example that my son had to go I was saying this example that I said I've got a four year old son and he the other kids they're older than he wanted why does he get away with so much and I have to remind him you got away with that when you were his age but you're more mature now listen if if my son if he's four and he makes a mess it's not the same as if my 11 year old makes the mess say at some point if he doesn't mature in his character if it doesn't match his growth there's something wrong so there's got to be a character to match the level of maturity that we're in today if my son's 11 and he acts like he's five we got bad news but if he was 11 he acts like he's 11 or 12 or 13 we were looking for the character of maturity because at some point he's gonna have to be able to say this speak the word and say it just like I said you take over the father's business as you would a men so he's looking to see if they that's why I listen that's why I Luther could get away with persecuting the Jews and and smoking that's why I could get away with these things under Wesley it wasn't the age of maturity you don't expect as much from a little child but in the age of maturity we have to come to the fullness of the word it's no longer optional it's so longer just a measure but we've come to the maturity of it amen that's why he says like I love up for the bread news example job there by the skinnier teeth I think about job listen God was boasting on Joad his character and what happy one God boasted on jobs character he went through the worst trials life that seems so contrite us we just thought he'd been flying around their big old palace and this not but it's when gob became to Moses character he went through the tribes life but God give him a consolation in the midst of that trial he knew the my flesh I shall see God though the skin worms eat up this body yeah I will see him stand upon the earth he needed the sacrifice the he had offered was right no matter what people said or they accuse enough he knew that he'd come into meetings of the world and he imagined I probably said this before but he imagined joke knew ahead of time what God was saying about you might have you read Joe one before he went through his trials his treatise tries a lot different here the hold man God's on me I got him up there in Heaven's and go son go he'll not reject me he'll not denominator thing he didn't know all that he had no idea that the worst trials of his life was because he had the right kind of character and then not making it by the Skinit and that was his consolation got restored tuefel to him everything let him know never a demon but what a consolation you and I have in this age to know that God has said not just that he's going to bless us or forgive us some great anointing but he's bringing us to the adoption of sons and daughters of God big trials are not just there to make you feel bad they're not there to make you down it's there for the perfecting of your character this is something you might have went through things this year you never thought you'd want through in your whole life you might have dealt with things I don't know everybody's situation but you might be going through the trial of your life right now and said what is it all bad but I want you to consider there's a god up in heaven he's boasting today on the sons and daughters of God these are my sons these are my daughters they believe the message they've not been shaken by detractors they've not been carried about by winds of doctrine they're not moved with everybody else in the world they say the word they identify with sword and no matter what they go through they're not they're not coming just to reveal where they cannot be shaking off this rock [Applause] they believe that ah God can make away from them even when there's no way because they've seen God far they've seen a manifest in his word they know he's the same oh what a conservation you know the God's up there saying this is my son this is my daughter here you him hear what they had to say I'm going to put a voice of spiritual authority in them I can give them the kingdom listen God has whole hallelujah I meant what's the real gift it's that soul in there that control that's what God's got confidence in today he didn't have confidence in the stony tablets they were produced the life amen here's have confidence in Ezekiel Camilla tour these are that but the life of Christ in you who has confidence of saying I can give you my kingdom and I know you'll have the character I want you think about this because we get this this comic book superhero idea of adoption amen and then we think well I'm gonna adopt it somehow I'm going to do this and I'm gonna move back storms i'ma speak school well you might do all that but I didn't know one thing's for sure you're gonna have trials you're gonna go through things listen when Jesus when he goes up on Mount Transfiguration what's the very next thing he does he comes off the mountain he starts heading towards Jerusalem now he's ready to be offered and then listen here's an adopted son and he goes up to Calvary his own disciples that rejected him the cipher dishes betrayed him the father has forsaken him and turned his back on him so much that he sweat great drops of blood for you and I but yeah there was a character on display that he would say not my will but thine be done that's what pleases the father he could have called for angels he could have done all these things not my will whatever really forsaken him what he was suffering like no man had ever suffered it would even the father for sayin not my will that I will be done I mean you think about a prophet we talk about miracles we can talk about prayer lines but here's an adopted son of God they come back from out west and what's he doing preaches the opening senses I'm probably lose almost all my friends for this here's an adopted son of God he's dealt with stomach trouble most of his life student deals another one here and a half two years stomach trouble his life hidden opposite of God going on to out less Arizona tell the people airing the door open for me to preach air here's an adopted son of God rejected at the end of his ministry in so let's say he even got a complex and lost his feeling for the people this time time I've got my mature son yeah its complexes with trials with rejection see we thought we were all gonna get away from all that stuff not in this body or no hush it was at that time he goes to the greatest rejections is like the greatest trials the greatest suffering yet though is a character in him God had rested with him and then that he had had to always make new things always had to lead them but he there's a character in that man that he could get to a place where God could testify a back son because you have chosen you chose the hard way it was your choice you made that decision cuz the right leadership is in you therefore great portion of heaven awaits you beside know a lot of people there's a couple making out on the front row like of the prophets means and the voice book said whatever you say it'll be they'd blow up or catch on fire turn to tones or something but there was a character in that man's life what's gonna watch this now what does he say Father forgive them that's what the son said on the cross as it always produces the same thing Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing hey man I'm coming down to eat listen adop's is more than just signs and wonders and miracles you can have that with an anointing and not have the leadership the leadership will produce as I said the character of Christ every time it has to he can't lead you anywhere else he didn't predestinate several options to you he pretend they said predestinated one son conform to one image that's why the Bible says that he gave these gifts in the manner that we would grow up into him in what all things somebody say that would be all things not just a portion not just a measure but all that wasn't God we poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he has now poured into this ride everything that Adam lost has been restored to you in that life and that seat is there everything you need for your journey is in you in the Holy Ghost why because he's quick in the scene every leaf every branch every bit of SAP it's all in the scene even the rapture oh my prophet says this his adoption placing positionally where are they at show me where they're had God calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something's happening I like that they don't have to tell you know I can tell when a man or a woman listen I've managed the restaurants before in this that I can tell another manager something they get in sync here when they have to start telling everybody hang on the boss here I'm the manager listen if you got Authority you don't have to tell everybody every five minutes here no I'm a son of God I'm a believer listen your life will testify hey man when God identified Christ he was a man approved of God the father's by signs and wonders your testified of his gifts God testified who he was she said I'm not done that bore witness of myself the father has borne witness of Who I am listen if you've got a maturity if you know where your sin you ain't got to tell everybody who I'm gonna darken so I'm the best believer in church man I wish everybody get on my level yeah that's maturity around the boss here listen you got to tell somebody it means you don't believe yourself that's what I means Amen listen when you know where you're at and you said God identifies you got to brag to everybody it will bear witness of itself you don't have to broadcast it amen it's like as a minister if I've got it if I'm called as a minister and I've got a gift my eye I shouldn't have to convince you hey by the way everybody on the minister you better listen to what I have to say well if I've got a gift in my life you I don't have to tell you you'll see that's the word that's the word on this play listen God sent some apostles prophets evangelists pastors teachers for the church hey man if you've got a groundcar pastor praise God that's God's gift to you hey men praise the Lord listen obedience is the duty of the son and an option but the placing of a son or adoption that's the father's duty amen we're not here because some people preach adoption that way we got to do this and do that that's not what we're talking about but I should recognize this is the season for it you think the things you're going through and the things that you deal with the blessings in your life and the trials in your life they're bringing forth a maturing you that's not been seen on the face of the earth since the 60s in one man since the before then the shores of Galilee it's gonna produce it not in just one but in a body of believers amen so what's the real gift it's that song I'm talking about God's wrapped gifts amen leave God sense a right to give for this generation I'm not talking about just the discernment I'm not just talking about prophesy that man's life I mean he sent some apostles prophets he didn't send them us the gift of apostles and the gift of prophets the gift of the man is the gift that man is a gift to you for your maturity amen your pastor is a gift to you for your the man is it yes and then if the man says in this publish that God called man that's a gift to you for you it's to dress the bride is that right now listen I know they're athlete's paper don't look like much but if the gift is there it's for your good a man but what I want you understand that's not just the ministry that's not just William Branham he's talking about you this is where I want to come down to today God's wrapped gifts God's got many gifts that solely placed in you if you're believer this morning he predestinated you to it you're a wrap gift now who's the gift floor well it's not just for you it's for the body boy I've been called a lot of things in my life food being called a gift wasn't you all know I'm talking about you you might have been called this by mommy and this by daddy and this by sone so working this by the teacher whatever it is we've been called lots of things in life but the Bible says that you're a gift you are a gift to this 2019 generation they sure don't deserve it it's not a reward you're a gift that's why there's mercy here today God will not judge the unrighteous with the righteous so there's mercy today because God's got some rap gifts now I don't know what y'all did this last week and I'm not here to preach Christmas or not I'm gonna test that was a 10-foot Pole they aim em but you might unwrap some gifts or got some gifts this week but the real gift in your life is that so and then God give me some family got you two some brothers and sisters when you sit in the mountain church God's wrapped gifts to you to encourage you to lift you up to remind you that we're all called to this adoption don't look at the wrapping paper let's see yes like I said we would never do that in the natural hey men listen be careful here I've had some real nice wrapped gifts before and they're like a pair of socks or something know what that I want to shotgun or something yeah it's bullets something cool yeah it's not the wrapping that identifies it it's what's on the inside listen you are a wrap gift to this generation God's had other abuse but you're the wrap gift that God sent in this day men that's the kind of gift I'm looking at today with all of our faults or your failures your insecurities your complexes yet that's God's gift look at the person your left or the right look around you God's gifts to you sitting with you in church amen the whole body edifies itself in love I want you today hey man as I come to a closer I want you to recognize that the gift of God in you is the gift of God to each other it's the same leadership it's producing the same life and listen you've got to come to position your predestinated to it in other words God's were out gifts always find their place you have to find your place your Freda what is your face son maturity adoption that gives you always find its place not just F as a part or in the body but within that body whatever it is whether it's a minister or a fact whatever it is you're called to be God has blessed you to be listen I can't do it without you we can't do it without each other it's one log that's why he talks about fussing soon many times I've done it before not often many times we look at her brother's just say wow they're they're special Olivia so they've at or whatever many times people in church they have variances and strikes because they fail to look at each other the way God looks how can look at my brother and I can see the wrapping paper my sister or brother can look at me see the fault the failure there there hey man I'm not telling you I'm gonna wrap gift the wrapping is no good amen but the gift of God is life to us amen the gift of God in you is life to me amen think about tonight or this this after I guess it still Maureen longer yeah part two I'm ready to go praise the Lord think about all the different talents and gifts their different types of specialists and jobs I don't know engineers or scientists medical professionals guitar players people that can run the screens all these things they're gifts in our life but the real gift that real gift is that soul that person that's who the real that that's not the wrapping that's not who there it's the one on the inside it's an attribute of God that's been quickened to come to maturity along with you so why don't you stand your feet I won't preach part once you stand to your feet though here I want you to shake hands with one another say god bless you your shaking hands with God's wrapped gifts amen tell somebody you love them tell them god bless you cause wrap gifts man oh that that's that's that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy amen now I want you to do me a favor if you struggle with this sort of thing and you go home maybe the night before you go to bed or whatever and you look in the mirror you look at wrinkles and you look at backaches and you look at your past you look at insecurities I don't want you to look at those things I want you to look in the mirror I want you to talk to that person that mirror and say your gods wrapped gift to this generation might be a little hard at first but do it again amen God ordained you to be a blessing amen so we're talk about the maturity it's one thing to be blessed I'm going to go to church because I want a blessing and I want to do this it's nothing to produce life to be a blessing and that's what you're here for that's why I mean it like I said this morning you've all been a blessing to me I appreciate you remind yourself you're ordained to be God's wrapped gifts to this generation amen praise the Lord well let's sing a song here you make key of D I think it's Dean you know what let's do see it's the congregation might want to sing with me I wanna sing that song when he reached down his hand for me I think about it time in my life I didn't look at myself as
