[36:44] we have to be conscious of what God does
[36:47] in our lives
[36:48] not sometimes but always
[36:52] amen and we know that
[36:55] we are human beings
[36:57] but it is not our ability
[36:59] it's not anything that we do ourselves
[37:02] but always just the grace of God
[37:05] amen so we want to see tonight the
[37:08] Angelic protection
[37:10] now David here
[37:14] was saying something
[37:16] that
[37:18] the angel of the Lord encompet around
[37:21] about them that fear Him
[37:25] and deliver them
[37:27] meaning
[37:29] God is always around his people
[37:35] enjoy
[37:38] in trouble last time
[37:41] in a confused state
[37:43] God is always with his people
[37:47] to deliver them
[37:50] and they say oh taste and see
[37:54] that the Lord is good
[37:57] my
[37:59] he said taste it
[38:02] you must test it
[38:06] Hallelujah
[38:08] every one of us must test it
[38:13] it is your own taste
[38:15] not my taste
[38:18] your taste cannot be my taste and
[38:21] maintenance cannot be your taste
[38:25] Hallelujah
[38:27] we made taste of the same food
[38:29] right now
[38:32] if I order
[38:35] what food can I even mention right now
[38:38] at all right now and I say okay let our
[38:40] taste
[38:42] well our desk may call for more salt
[38:47] Others May say that oh no the salt is
[38:50] too much
[38:53] others may try to you know request for
[38:56] some cayenne pepper because it's not
[38:59] spicy
[39:01] like how I like it
[39:05] amen so it is your own taste
[39:09] not someone's taste
[39:12] because when you test it yourself
[39:15] then you can come out with testimony
[39:20] Hallelujah
[39:22] when you test it yourself when the
[39:24] situation arise you know how to stand
[39:28] he said taste
[39:30] he said oh taste and see the law is good
[39:33] blessed is the man that trusted in him
[39:38] oh no wonder no wonder that that day
[39:41] when the book of NASA was trying to you
[39:44] know put fear in the three Hebrew
[39:46] children
[39:47] that if they don't bow down to the image
[39:49] he was going to bend them up
[39:51] but what did the brother say they said
[39:53] King we are not careful to answer you
[39:55] this
[39:56] we know the god that we said will save
[39:58] you from your hands
[40:00] because they have tested and they know
[40:02] how God can deliver them from the hands
[40:06] of the book of days that's very famous
[40:08] they have already tested the Lord
[40:10] hallelujah so they know the ability they
[40:12] know the power of God they said we are
[40:15] not careful to answer your king
[40:17] but we assuring you we are not going to
[40:19] bow down to your image
[40:21] right Nebuchadnezzar said well if you
[40:25] will not bow down I'm going to ban you
[40:28] they heated the finance seven times
[40:32] and they threw this Brethren inside
[40:35] can you imagine
[40:37] the soldier that threw them into the
[40:39] fire their Flames came up and passed on
[40:41] them and they died
[40:43] and these three brothers were standing
[40:45] jumping in the fire and they were
[40:46] worshiping God
[40:48] Hallelujah nobody asked them to do that
[40:51] there's two because they have the taste
[40:53] of God already
[40:55] David said Test the Lord come and Test
[40:59] the Lord and thank God we have tested
[41:01] the Lord in this message of this hour
[41:03] and we know how sweet the Lord is
[41:07] oh Hallelujah
[41:09] and and also in the book of uh uh Psalm
[41:14] 27 in the seven he said the Lord is my
[41:17] light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[41:20] on this Earth
[41:23] behind the egg
[41:25] outside the Earth Whom Shall We Fear
[41:29] Hallelujah he said the Lord is the
[41:31] strength of my life or Whom Shall I be
[41:34] afraid
[41:36] when they're Wicked even my enemies and
[41:38] my foes came up upon me to eat of My
[41:41] Flesh they stumble and fell
[41:44] though and whole shouldn't come against
[41:47] me my heart shall not fear
[41:50] the world should Rise Against Me
[41:53] and this will I be confident
[41:57] and one thing have I desired of the Lord
[41:59] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[42:03] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[42:06] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[42:11] today
[42:13] because of fear
[42:16] people end up protecting themselves
[42:21] falsely
[42:24] people go
[42:26] you know to to much for to see for
[42:29] magical powers
[42:31] to protect themselves because of fear
[42:36] now when you come politically
[42:38] we know that almost all Nations under
[42:42] this Earth are protecting themselves
[42:44] because they don't know what the future
[42:46] is going to be for them
[42:49] Every Nation
[42:52] UK is protecting herself
[42:55] Germany protecting herself United States
[42:58] protecting herself Germany Russia all
[43:01] the countries are protecting themselves
[43:03] because of fear
[43:06] and even Nations that are so poor
[43:10] that their citizens don't have food to
[43:12] eat
[43:14] when they get money instead of buying
[43:16] food they go and buy ammunitions and and
[43:19] you know all kind of thing because of
[43:21] fear they want to protect themselves
[43:24] but all those protections are vain
[43:28] there is no protection that's what
[43:31] passes the protections of God
[43:34] and that is the reason why the Bible
[43:35] said that the angel of the Lord
[43:37] encompassed around the people that fears
[43:41] here
[43:42] Hallelujah so your protections is
[43:46] nothing if Jesus Christ is not your
[43:49] protector
[43:51] amen
[43:52] now we know that in the Old Testament
[43:54] when the worshipers they worship under
[43:57] the blood in those days uh the high
[43:59] priest would go into the holiest of
[44:02] holies
[44:03] and whenever he goes there he is going
[44:05] to seek favor for the people
[44:07] because they need protection
[44:10] they need blessings they need healing
[44:12] they need security
[44:14] and that's the only source
[44:17] of their power and freedom of their Joy
[44:20] so the High Praise will go into the
[44:23] holies of holies with the blood of
[44:26] animals of course
[44:28] because he's going to meet the presence
[44:30] of God
[44:32] between the cherubims
[44:34] the angels of the Lord
[44:36] the moment the end he entered there with
[44:40] that ordinance then the place changed
[44:43] with the presence of God
[44:45] amen and he goes there with the bells
[44:49] ringing around the Hem of His garments
[44:51] because you cannot go into the presence
[44:53] of God silent
[44:55] that God to be noise over there
[44:58] Hallelujah and the best will be ringing
[45:01] here and there to signal that God has
[45:04] descended
[45:06] and so when it come on from the holness
[45:09] of holies he bring the peace of God upon
[45:12] the congregation
[45:14] he bring the blessings of God upon the
[45:16] congregation he brings the healings of
[45:18] God upon the congregation now as it was
[45:22] in those days under the blood of animal
[45:26] how much more you and I
[45:29] Hallelujah who are under the blood of
[45:32] Jesus Christ
[45:34] when the prophet said is the blood of
[45:36] God himself
[45:38] without no limitation perfect blood
[45:42] eight power has no beginning and has no
[45:45] end it has no expiry date
[45:48] amen that is why that sacrifice was done
[45:50] once
[45:51] and for all
[45:53] amen
[45:54] today
[45:56] he will tell you
[45:58] be careful
[46:00] the way that you treat this was
[46:03] because the angels
[46:06] are always beholding the face of my
[46:09] father
[46:11] your angel
[46:13] is always beholding the face of God
[46:17] that is why anybody ought to be careful
[46:20] about you
[46:21] Jesus himself said that now let's look
[46:25] to something here
[46:27] it come to a Time
[46:29] then Abraham called his servant his
[46:33] servant
[46:35] and told him that go into my country
[46:38] and look for a wife for my son Isaac
[46:41] because I don't want him to marry he
[46:44] said don't take any woman in this canal
[46:47] land I don't need that
[46:50] and there are no circumstance you a
[46:51] Believer marry an unbeliever
[46:54] so that thing was from the beginning
[46:58] Hallelujah
[46:59] he said don't marry any woman in this
[47:01] land go to my country
[47:04] and the servant said master
[47:06] what about if the woman is not willing
[47:09] to follow me here
[47:11] Abraham said
[47:12] the God that I worship
[47:15] he will send you an angel
[47:18] and the angel will guide your way
[47:21] Hallelujah and Yahweh will be prospered
[47:24] now when the servant got to the land
[47:28] he prayed a prayer he said oh Lord God
[47:32] of my master Abraham
[47:35] this is my mission
[47:38] I am here to take a wife of my master
[47:41] Isaac
[47:42] please bring me good speed
[47:45] the the dumpster that will arrive here
[47:48] and I'll ask give me water to drink and
[47:52] she will say I will give you and I'll
[47:54] give you that of your animal also let
[47:58] that be the wife of my master Isaac
[48:02] and the Bible says
[48:06] he barely finished with this prayer
[48:10] then Rebecca appeared
[48:14] Hallelujah and as she he prayed exactly
[48:19] it happened
[48:21] so to cut the short story
[48:25] he asked
[48:28] is there a room in your father's house
[48:30] he said yes
[48:33] then his brother Laban
[48:35] rush and met this man by the well
[48:40] and took him home
[48:42] they prepare a place for him
[48:45] now when you realize that God has
[48:48] blessed him
[48:49] he said well why don't you allow me to
[48:52] go with the woman
[48:55] please
[48:57] don't keep me here don't don't wake me
[48:59] he said no why why will we give you the
[49:02] woman just like that
[49:04] give us a course
[49:06] whereby we can allow the woman to go
[49:08] with you
[49:10] and the servant says something let's
[49:12] read it
[49:14] in Genesis chapter 24.
[49:20] Genesis
[49:23] chapter 24
[49:28] and verse 37
[49:38] and he said and my mustard made me swear
[49:41] saying Thou shalt not take a wife to my
[49:43] son
[49:45] or the daughters of the Canaanite that's
[49:47] 24 37.
[49:50] in Westland I dwell
[49:52] but thou shall go unto my father's house
[49:55] and to my Kindred and take a wife unto
[49:58] my son
[49:59] and I said unto my master
[50:02] Pera Adventure the woman will not follow
[50:05] me
[50:06] and he said unto me
[50:08] the Lord before whom I walk will send
[50:11] his angel with thee and prosper thy way
[50:15] and thou shall take a while for my son
[50:18] of my Kindred and of my father's house
[50:22] amen
[50:24] so Abraham
[50:27] promised
[50:28] his servant that no matter their
[50:31] situation
[50:33] I know the God that I serve will send
[50:36] you an angel
[50:37] because that has been his experience
[50:40] throughout all his life
[50:42] the angel has spoken to him on several
[50:45] occasions and for that matter he knew
[50:47] that the angel will always be around his
[50:49] people
[50:50] so if I am sending you in the name of
[50:52] the Lord I know definitely that the Lord
[50:54] is going to send you an angel
[50:57] brother sister
[50:59] let us be conscious
[51:01] that God is always around us
[51:04] Amen in the name of his guiding angels
[51:07] let us be conscious of that and know
[51:10] what exactly we ought to do at all times
[51:13] amen
[51:15] now let's come to the life of Moses
[51:18] we all know what happened to him in the
[51:21] land of Egypt
[51:22] and he has to Escape run away from Egypt
[51:25] to the land of media
[51:27] he lived there for some time
[51:29] Prospect married brought forth songs
[51:33] and as it was he has a particular place
[51:37] that he always go and Grace the animals
[51:41] but one particular day it's the thing is
[51:43] always one day
[51:46] it is always one day
[51:48] that day something happened
[51:52] he saw unusual sin
[51:55] and it attracted him
[51:58] a bush burning
[52:01] with flames
[52:03] without the leaves being consumed
[52:06] he said let me turn around this and seek
[52:08] it well
[52:10] so when you turn then he heard his name
[52:13] mentioned Moses
[52:15] don't come further
[52:18] for where you are standing is the Holy
[52:19] Ground
[52:21] why was there a Holy Ground because the
[52:24] angel of the Lord was standing there
[52:28] and therefore remove thy Sanders
[52:33] and Moses obeyed the instructions
[52:36] now what Moses was running away from
[52:39] this Angel wants him to go back for it
[52:44] that is where the confusion came
[52:46] Moses said no no no no I can't
[52:52] I'm not ready to go you say you are
[52:54] going
[52:56] Hallelujah
[52:57] it's a lord
[52:59] if I go what am I going to tell the
[53:02] people
[53:03] the women ask me which God have sent me
[53:07] say when they ask you that question tell
[53:09] them I am
[53:10] I've sent you
[53:13] amen but let us see what he performed
[53:16] because Moses himself would doubt
[53:18] initially
[53:20] he said what is in your hand he says a
[53:21] rod
[53:22] cut it on the ground he cast it and he
[53:25] turned to a serpent
[53:28] and everybody's afraid of a serpent
[53:31] well those who have the courage to take
[53:33] serpent well I don't know
[53:38] I don't think I would do that anyway
[53:42] oh yes I don't think I would do that
[53:44] taking a serpent
[53:46] putting the serpent around my neck for
[53:48] what purpose
[53:50] now
[53:51] he said take it by the tail
[53:54] you see that is unusual God we are
[53:55] worshiping
[53:57] because nobody
[53:59] would take a snake by the tail
[54:02] you'll be dead
[54:05] but because the angel of the Lord
[54:07] was there and was instructing Moses
[54:11] the unusual thing will happen he said
[54:13] take it by the tail
[54:16] and he reached it and took it by the
[54:18] tail
[54:19] and 10 into the rod
[54:23] he said put your hand in your bottom we
[54:25] put it bring it out it was leprosy he
[54:28] said no no no no no he said put it back
[54:30] you put it again Bring It On he brought
[54:31] it
[54:33] say yes
[54:34] if they don't believe the first sign
[54:37] that I God have sent you do you believe
[54:40] the second sign
[54:42] and we don't know what happened brother
[54:43] sister
[54:44] when Moses was convinced that God have
[54:48] sent him indeed to deliver the people
[54:51] he went
[54:52] to back to Egypt
[54:57] and when they stood before pharaoh
[55:00] there were three oppositions in Egypt
[55:03] Moses was going to face
[55:05] he went to pharaoh
[55:08] that said the Lord let my people go
[55:12] if I don't say who is that God
[55:16] that iron Pharaoh the king of the whole
[55:18] world
[55:20] to allow his people to go
[55:22] and if Allah Israelites to go who do the
[55:25] work
[55:26] Moses I'm sorry a pharaoh demanded
[55:30] what's he said well
[55:31] you want to know that God
[55:33] Iran cast my rod on the on the ground
[55:37] he casted down
[55:39] and he tend to what's happened again
[55:42] and they were laughing you see they were
[55:44] laughing pharaoh and all the Egyptians
[55:47] in the palace were laughing at Moses
[55:50] why because they realized that as for
[55:54] days Janice and generous can do it
[55:56] better
[55:57] is a magical trick
[56:00] we have been doing it here always
[56:03] oh is that so
[56:05] yes we also know that Satan has always
[56:08] impersonated the way of the Lord right
[56:10] from the beginning and you can do to
[56:12] impersonate the work of God
[56:15] they call Janice and generous and they
[56:17] came up
[56:19] they also cast their rod
[56:22] they turn into serpents perhaps bigger
[56:24] than that of Moses
[56:26] amen and they were laughing Moses you
[56:30] see what we told you this is a magical
[56:31] trick
[56:33] but before they realize
[56:37] that of Moses raised it head
[56:41] and swallow the rod of Janice and
[56:45] swallow that off
[56:47] Jam race is that
[56:50] two
[56:52] so
[56:53] that was swallowed that day
[56:56] and the great was also swallowed
[56:59] Hallelujah and Moses picked his Rod back
[57:04] until today
[57:06] they are swallowed
[57:09] they did not know
[57:11] that Moses were not standing alone
[57:16] but the angel of the Lord was standing
[57:18] by Moses
[57:20] and that is what the world don't know
[57:22] about you beloved brothers and sisters
[57:24] maybe you yourself don't know but
[57:26] tonight I am telling you that there are
[57:28] angels around you
[57:30] so long as you remain the child of God
[57:33] oh wow
[57:36] amen and amen now look at Moses the man
[57:41] whom was sent to bring the people
[57:44] and you stand and you challenge him it
[57:47] means you don't know what you are doing
[57:50] that is why people should be very
[57:52] careful
[57:53] those who are challenging the message of
[57:55] this hour
[57:57] they should be very careful I'm giving
[57:58] them free advice I will not judge them
[58:02] Hallelujah they should be very careful
[58:04] brother sister because angels are on God
[58:10] well
[58:11] we all know what happened
[58:13] Pharaoh became so stubborn after all
[58:16] these things he still didn't want the
[58:19] Israelites to go till God struck the
[58:21] whole nation with pestilence and
[58:24] problems and templates troubles here and
[58:26] there
[58:28] right
[58:29] and at the long run
[58:32] you have to depart
[58:35] said Moses
[58:38] tell the Israelites
[58:40] to kill animals
[58:43] let them apply the blood as token
[58:47] for I'm going to send Death Angel
[58:50] to enter into the homes of the Egyptians
[58:55] when they come and you see the blood on
[58:58] your lentils they will pass over
[59:02] amen it's a sign of obedience
[59:06] it's a sign that you will agree to the
[59:08] Covenant that God have written
[59:11] failure to do that you are more than
[59:14] dead
[59:16] and they did it exactly
[59:19] and God with this power or by his power
[59:22] he pulled all these people out from
[59:25] Egypt
[59:27] but look at what happened
[59:29] after they left Egypt
[59:31] Pharaoh said what mistake have we done
[59:35] by allowing Israel to go
[59:38] no
[59:39] I've repented
[59:41] let's go back and bring them again
[59:44] let them come and continue with their
[59:46] liver
[59:47] because they have to work for us
[59:50] and they mounted up their army
[59:53] the Chariots the food soldiers thousands
[59:57] and thousands and thousands of them they
[1:00:00] pursue Israel
[1:00:02] and by that time Israel has also come
[1:00:04] face to face with the Red Sea
[1:00:07] and they didn't know what to do
[1:00:09] oh brother they were crying here and
[1:00:12] there asking Moses Moses are they're not
[1:00:17] grapes in Egypt and you have brought us
[1:00:19] here to die Moses
[1:00:23] and it's always Moses
[1:00:25] Hallelujah
[1:00:27] Moses didn't lead the way
[1:00:30] it was the way that the angel LED Moses
[1:00:36] that got them to that position
[1:00:40] and when they saw the Dust
[1:00:44] of the movement of pharaoh Chariot
[1:00:46] coming towards them
[1:00:48] oh my
[1:00:50] the agitation became so great
[1:00:52] they didn't know what to do Moses have
[1:00:55] you brought us here to die this is what
[1:00:57] we asked you that let us be peaceful in
[1:01:00] Egypt
[1:01:01] now look at what God did
[1:01:04] the bible say that while they were
[1:01:06] approaching Israel
[1:01:07] then the pillar of fire came
[1:01:10] and stood between the Egyptians and the
[1:01:13] Israelites
[1:01:15] oh my
[1:01:17] God and in the night it became a light
[1:01:20] to that of the Israelites and to the
[1:01:23] Egyptians it was Darkness
[1:01:26] can you imagine this who would perform
[1:01:29] this is only the god that we worship
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:34] Exodus
[1:01:37] Exodus chapter 14. let's let's compare
[1:01:40] something there quickly and come back
[1:01:45] Exodus 14.
[1:01:48] and verse 18.
[1:01:54] okay
[1:01:58] and the Egyptians shall know that I am
[1:02:00] the Lord
[1:02:01] when I've gotten me honor upon pharaoh
[1:02:04] upon his chariots
[1:02:09] and upon his husband
[1:02:11] verse 19 and the angel of God which went
[1:02:15] before the camp of Israel removed
[1:02:18] and went behind them
[1:02:20] and the pillar of the cloud went from
[1:02:23] before their face and stood behind them
[1:02:26] and it came between the camp of the
[1:02:29] Egyptians and the camp of Israel
[1:02:32] and it was a cloud and darkness to them
[1:02:35] but it gave light by night to this so
[1:02:39] that the one came not near the other or
[1:02:42] the night
[1:02:44] who did that the angel of the Lord
[1:02:49] the angel of the Lord
[1:02:52] and it came uh verse 21 okay and Moses
[1:02:57] stretched out his hand over the sea and
[1:03:01] the Lord caused the sea to go back by a
[1:03:04] strong East Wind all that night and made
[1:03:07] the sea dry land
[1:03:09] and the waters were divided
[1:03:11] and the children of Israel went into the
[1:03:14] Maze of the sea upon the dry ground
[1:03:17] Hallelujah
[1:03:19] and the waters were a wall unto them on
[1:03:22] their right hand and on their left
[1:03:25] and the Egyptian pursued and went in
[1:03:28] after them to the midst of the sea even
[1:03:31] all fellow horses his chariots and his
[1:03:34] Horsemen
[1:03:35] and it came to pass
[1:03:37] that in the morning watch
[1:03:40] the Lord looked unto the horse of the
[1:03:43] Egyptian through the pillar of Fire
[1:03:46] and of the cloud and troubled the host
[1:03:49] of the Egyptians oh my
[1:03:53] yes sir God is still doing that
[1:03:57] God is looking to your enemy through the
[1:03:59] pillar of Fire
[1:04:01] and when God is looking through the
[1:04:03] pillar of fire for your sake against
[1:04:05] your enemy that you know what is going
[1:04:07] to happen
[1:04:08] victory
[1:04:10] victory victory oh Hallelujah I say Lord
[1:04:15] continue to look to my enemy through the
[1:04:17] pillar of Fire
[1:04:19] amen
[1:04:21] verse 25
[1:04:23] and took off the acharya's wheels that
[1:04:27] they dread them heavily so that the
[1:04:29] Egyptians said let us flee from the face
[1:04:31] of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them
[1:04:34] against the Egyptians and the Lord said
[1:04:37] unto Moses stretch out thy hand over the
[1:04:40] sea that the waters May Come Again upon
[1:04:43] the Egyptians upon their chariots and
[1:04:46] upon their Horsemen
[1:04:47] and Moses stretched forth his hand over
[1:04:50] the sea and the Sea returned to his
[1:04:52] strength when the morning appeared and
[1:04:55] the Egyptian fled against it and the
[1:04:58] Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
[1:05:00] midst of the sea
[1:05:04] all these things happen
[1:05:08] because God dispatched an angel to take
[1:05:11] care of them
[1:05:12] that same angel
[1:05:15] was the one that protected Moses
[1:05:18] when he was born as a baby a child
[1:05:22] Hallelujah and there was a decree by
[1:05:26] Pharaoh that all the children of the
[1:05:29] Jews should be should be killed
[1:05:32] but by faith
[1:05:34] the Bible said that by faith
[1:05:36] Hallelujah the mother and mother of
[1:05:39] Moses kept this child
[1:05:42] and they made they built a cat and
[1:05:45] played this child in and released this
[1:05:47] child on the River Nile
[1:05:49] and we all know that it is said that the
[1:05:52] Nile crocodiles are the biggest you know
[1:05:54] crocodiles one of the most biggest
[1:05:56] crocodiles in the whole world and they
[1:05:59] were all around
[1:06:01] the water
[1:06:03] and this boy or this baby
[1:06:06] crying to attract crocodile
[1:06:10] maybe they have eaten and they were
[1:06:11] looking for some dessert
[1:06:13] so that little baby could have been a
[1:06:15] better desert a good dessert for them
[1:06:17] but the angel of the Lord
[1:06:19] kept protecting this child
[1:06:22] and these are swarm
[1:06:24] this touch one this is swarm being
[1:06:27] between the crocodiles and none of them
[1:06:30] was able to catch it
[1:06:33] that it landed where Pharaoh's daughter
[1:06:36] was taking her shower
[1:06:39] and that was the saving point of Moses
[1:06:41] and that same engine
[1:06:44] the prophet said when you are born God
[1:06:47] give you that angel and that and you
[1:06:50] stay with you through life so it was
[1:06:54] that same engine that kept Moses from
[1:06:56] the crocodile now it was that same angel
[1:06:58] that said Moses bringing the Israelites
[1:07:00] from Egypt to the promised land
[1:07:03] oh brother
[1:07:05] we still have dangerous guidedness
[1:07:07] amen I said we'll still have Angels
[1:07:09] guiding us
[1:07:10] amen and amen and God told his people I
[1:07:14] am sending my angel before thee to guide
[1:07:18] and to protect thee for a very sweet
[1:07:21] communion but
[1:07:24] it is always bad
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:28] God don't send his Angel to guide us
[1:07:32] that we should do whatever we want to do
[1:07:36] God don't send his angels to guide us
[1:07:39] and we think that okay we are the angel
[1:07:41] of the Lord guiding us so we can do
[1:07:43] anything whether good or bad no God
[1:07:46] don't appealed for that when God's son
[1:07:49] is angry to guide us it is for a purpose
[1:07:52] he wanted to remain in God's way
[1:07:56] that is the reason
[1:07:58] he wants us to remain in God's way that
[1:08:02] is the reason
[1:08:03] and so he said
[1:08:05] I am sending my angel before thee can we
[1:08:10] read that quickly also quickly
[1:08:13] Exodus chapter 23.
[1:08:17] Exodus chapter 23 verse
[1:08:23] verse 20.
[1:08:26] Exodus chapter 23.
[1:08:29] he said behold
[1:08:31] I send an angel before thee
[1:08:34] to keep thee in the way
[1:08:37] and to bring thee into the place which I
[1:08:39] have prepared
[1:08:41] beware of him
[1:08:43] and obey his voice
[1:08:46] provoke him not
[1:08:48] for he will not pardon your
[1:08:49] transgressions
[1:08:51] for my name is in him
[1:08:55] I am sending my angel before thee to
[1:08:59] keep thee in your way and to bring thee
[1:09:01] into the place which I God have prepared
[1:09:07] Hallelujah
[1:09:09] made him be very careful
[1:09:12] of that angel and obey his voice
[1:09:16] provoke him not
[1:09:18] for he will not pardon your
[1:09:20] transgressions
[1:09:21] today how many people are provoking the
[1:09:24] angel of the Lord
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:27] you can provoke the angel of the Lord
[1:09:29] with your character
[1:09:31] you can provoke the angel of the Lord
[1:09:34] with your behavior
[1:09:36] you can provoke the angel of the Lord
[1:09:38] with what you do
[1:09:40] and what you ought not to do
[1:09:43] Hallelujah but you see there was a
[1:09:45] question here he said Beware because he
[1:09:48] will not pardon your transgression
[1:09:53] Hallelujah
[1:09:56] we remember this uh you know seditious
[1:10:00] enough personalities like like Dayton
[1:10:02] Korra and abiram
[1:10:04] when they stood against Moses
[1:10:08] and they were challenging Moses
[1:10:10] Moses you take too much upon yourself
[1:10:13] you think you are the only holy man
[1:10:15] amongst us
[1:10:17] why are you making yourself as your God
[1:10:21] on us
[1:10:23] they provoke the angel of the Lord
[1:10:27] right and you say Moses
[1:10:29] separate yourself from these people
[1:10:33] separate yourself from this unbelievers
[1:10:37] don't be on you call your
[1:10:40] it's a frosting but that is the truth
[1:10:43] it's still in that scripture
[1:10:45] and that scripture will never lose its
[1:10:47] power
[1:10:48] that's parody
[1:10:50] he said separate yourself from this
[1:10:53] unbelievers I will deal with them
[1:10:55] because
[1:10:56] they have provoked me
[1:10:59] then Moses was anointed that day
[1:11:02] and he stood before the congregation
[1:11:06] he said any of you
[1:11:10] who don't want to suffer destruction
[1:11:14] separate yourself
[1:11:16] from data Quran and abira
[1:11:21] as if it was a joke
[1:11:24] but when the angel of the Lord speaks
[1:11:27] it has to perform
[1:11:30] Moses came and stood before the
[1:11:32] congregation
[1:11:34] he said today
[1:11:37] you will know
[1:11:38] that it is not me
[1:11:41] but it is the Angel of the Lord
[1:11:44] if these people die a natural death
[1:11:48] then take me as a false prophet
[1:11:53] the bible say that
[1:11:55] Moses has barely finished his statements
[1:11:58] when the earth cliff
[1:12:01] the angel broke the Earth
[1:12:04] he opened the Earth and pushed this
[1:12:07] unbelievers in
[1:12:08] put all their family and everything that
[1:12:12] they had
[1:12:13] and you close it again
[1:12:15] you don't provoke the angel
[1:12:18] beloved brother sister
[1:12:20] God have given us position in him
[1:12:24] and that position it is not we fend for
[1:12:27] it
[1:12:28] it was given to us by his grace
[1:12:32] and the Lord has put us to honor that
[1:12:35] position
[1:12:36] the Lord expect us to be very careful
[1:12:39] of that position that he has given us
[1:12:43] the Lord expect us to do good to glorify
[1:12:46] his holy name
[1:12:48] by accepting his word
[1:12:52] not putting our own ideas
[1:12:55] because that don't help anyone
[1:13:00] your idea can be good for you
[1:13:03] but ask yourself when you bring it to
[1:13:05] the word
[1:13:06] where do you place that
[1:13:10] that is why you say let every man's word
[1:13:12] be a lie
[1:13:14] and let my be the truth
[1:13:17] Hallelujah
[1:13:20] it's about if thou shall indeed obey his
[1:13:22] voice and do all that I speak then I
[1:13:25] will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[1:13:28] adversary unto thy adversaries for my
[1:13:30] angels shall go before thee and bring
[1:13:33] thee in unto the amorites and the
[1:13:35] hitters and the parasites and the
[1:13:37] Canaanites the hevice and the jebusites
[1:13:40] and I will cut them off
[1:13:43] those are not bow down to their doors
[1:13:46] not serve them nor do after their works
[1:13:49] but thou shall utterly overthrow them
[1:13:52] and quite break down their images
[1:13:55] and ye shall serve the Lord your God and
[1:13:58] he shall bless thy bread
[1:14:00] and thy water and now I will take
[1:14:03] sickness away from the midst of thee you
[1:14:06] see the conditions
[1:14:08] you see the benefits that surrounds
[1:14:11] obedience to God's word
[1:14:14] these are the benefits he said I will
[1:14:17] what I'll bless thy bread
[1:14:19] and thy water and I will take sickness
[1:14:22] away from the midst of thee there shall
[1:14:25] nothing cause they are young nor be
[1:14:28] Barren in thy land the number of thy
[1:14:32] days I will fulfill
[1:14:35] Hallelujah
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:38] this is what God promised them and now
[1:14:41] let's listen to what the prophet said
[1:14:42] here I am I'm quoting from the guy he
[1:14:44] said the guide has understanding
[1:14:48] how to go and what to do
[1:14:52] God has always sent a guide to his
[1:14:54] people
[1:14:56] God has never failed
[1:14:58] he sends a guide but you've got to
[1:15:02] accept that guide
[1:15:05] that is the situation you go to accept
[1:15:07] that guide
[1:15:09] amen you see
[1:15:12] you've got to believe it you've got to
[1:15:15] go the way he says
[1:15:18] if you get into the Wilderness and your
[1:15:20] God say we go this way
[1:15:22] and yet you think you go that way you
[1:15:25] are going to come up lost
[1:15:28] then when God sends us a guide to guide
[1:15:31] us
[1:15:32] we've got to follow that guide
[1:15:35] no matter what we think
[1:15:38] what looks reasonable
[1:15:40] and what look ridiculous
[1:15:42] we are not subject to divide that the
[1:15:45] guide is the only one
[1:15:49] amen that God is the only one and thank
[1:15:53] God in this time of ours we have the
[1:15:56] guide
[1:15:57] no matter what you think
[1:16:00] you don't reason the word of God you
[1:16:02] only believe it
[1:16:04] is it that's the reason why today many
[1:16:06] people are throwing themselves of the
[1:16:09] dish
[1:16:10] from out of this message
[1:16:12] people that we knew people that were
[1:16:14] respected people that will cherish
[1:16:17] people that we we said amen when they
[1:16:20] were preaching the message of this hour
[1:16:23] today what do we hear
[1:16:25] it's a reasoning
[1:16:28] you don't reason
[1:16:29] you only believe
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] you only believe the Angelic protection
[1:16:38] in the Book of Revelation Jesus Christ
[1:16:42] was showing John
[1:16:45] how the angels
[1:16:48] Hallelujah were placed in his hand
[1:16:51] in fact the prophet called Earthly
[1:16:53] angels
[1:16:54] they were placed in the right hand of
[1:16:57] God
[1:16:58] for the purpose of the seven Church ages
[1:17:01] and this were going to be the angels
[1:17:04] that were going to guide the people of
[1:17:06] God the bread of Jesus Christ if I
[1:17:09] without a guide you will not see the way
[1:17:13] without those Angelic guidance you will
[1:17:16] not know the way
[1:17:18] so God purposely revealed that
[1:17:20] Revelation to John
[1:17:22] Hallelujah and we realize that in the
[1:17:26] Revelation chapter 4 also there were
[1:17:29] four living creatures that the Bible
[1:17:31] said that they were surrounded the
[1:17:33] throne and one half the face like a a
[1:17:36] lion one have a face like a man and one
[1:17:38] have a face like an ox and the other one
[1:17:41] has a face like a flying eagle
[1:17:42] now these were established in the old
[1:17:46] time
[1:17:47] when God divided the armies of Israel
[1:17:50] into four parts
[1:17:52] you know they had four battalions one
[1:17:55] two three and four
[1:17:56] yeah and the first one we realized that
[1:18:00] it was done taking the north position
[1:18:06] in the East was Judah and their enzyme
[1:18:10] was a a lion
[1:18:12] okay in the West Was Ephraim and the
[1:18:15] Ironside was the first of mine
[1:18:17] and then when you come to the South it
[1:18:19] was Reuben and yeah and son was an ox
[1:18:23] and so when you bring it into our time
[1:18:25] of this end time these were the spirits
[1:18:29] that guided the bread of Jesus Christ
[1:18:33] what about the Antichrist move to cause
[1:18:36] commotion they call the bride to come up
[1:18:39] and see
[1:18:41] amen when the Antichrist jumped on a
[1:18:45] white horse
[1:18:47] with a ball without an arrow to deceive
[1:18:49] the world
[1:18:50] and everybody thought that it was Jesus
[1:18:52] Christ it was one of these angels that
[1:18:56] called The Bride which was John John
[1:18:58] come and see
[1:19:01] and John saw that
[1:19:03] if John didn't have that Angelic
[1:19:05] protection do you think he would have
[1:19:07] seen it
[1:19:08] Hallelujah
[1:19:10] and when the Antichrist realized that he
[1:19:12] has been exposed he went back without he
[1:19:15] came back with another color
[1:19:16] that time there was an angel also
[1:19:19] calling the Bride come and see
[1:19:22] he did it till when you got to the
[1:19:25] fourth time he has mixed all the colors
[1:19:28] and have gone colorless you don't see
[1:19:29] what it is
[1:19:31] the Bible call it pale
[1:19:34] and that was going to be the most
[1:19:36] deceptive age
[1:19:38] but the devil didn't know
[1:19:40] that that was a time God also released
[1:19:44] the angel that have the character of a
[1:19:46] flying eagle
[1:19:48] and nothing can be hit from the eagle
[1:19:51] as much as the Fly High the clearer he
[1:19:55] sees on the ground that is why in this
[1:19:58] end time beloved you and I we can never
[1:20:01] be deceived
[1:20:02] Jesus himself said that the elect cannot
[1:20:06] be deceived because we have a guardian
[1:20:08] angel that is guiding us
[1:20:10] oh Hallelujah and that is the reason why
[1:20:14] we have the power today to go to that to
[1:20:17] the throne and say give us the book
[1:20:20] we have authority now
[1:20:23] Hallelujah we have authority now
[1:20:26] they were guiding angels and today we
[1:20:30] see that is same inspiration
[1:20:33] guiding the book of Acts Matthew
[1:20:36] Mark Luke and John
[1:20:39] and praise be to the name of our God
[1:20:41] that we are the continuation of the
[1:20:43] Apostles
[1:20:45] amen remember
[1:20:48] Peter was imprisoned
[1:20:50] and Angel descended
[1:20:52] open the prison door
[1:20:54] he said Peter go back and stand on the
[1:20:56] street and preach the word
[1:20:59] you think
[1:21:01] God has not dispatched an angel around
[1:21:03] you
[1:21:04] you have them around you
[1:21:06] amen you have them around you
[1:21:10] Hallelujah
[1:21:13] amen
[1:21:14] now
[1:21:15] he said and then
[1:21:18] there was another Danger
[1:21:21] this little company
[1:21:24] just a young man and his little newly
[1:21:28] married wife he was talking about Joseph
[1:21:30] and Mary
[1:21:33] going along the road many robbers were
[1:21:36] in the land in those days
[1:21:38] um
[1:21:39] like Barabbas and so forth
[1:21:42] and what a parade that would have been
[1:21:44] to them to see just a little man walking
[1:21:46] along with a little woman to be a mother
[1:21:49] sitting on a little donkey and with a
[1:21:52] little stick in his hand
[1:21:54] for a group of wild mean men to write
[1:21:57] down and throw her off of there and do
[1:22:00] evil
[1:22:02] but you know if God is leading the way
[1:22:05] what difference does it make
[1:22:09] God will protect you to your destination
[1:22:12] there is no dangers when you are walking
[1:22:15] with the Lord
[1:22:16] oh can you say
[1:22:19] there is no dangers brother sister there
[1:22:22] is no dangers when you are walking with
[1:22:24] the Lord
[1:22:26] I will believe easily that there was a
[1:22:29] horse of Ten Thousand Angels walking
[1:22:31] along there with that man and that

[1:22:51] one time
[1:22:53] when uh Elijah was in Samaria and he

[1:23:01] the king of serious bedroom
[1:23:03] and then he would tell the Israelites to
[1:23:07] be careful where they should go and
[1:23:09] where not to go
[1:23:11] and the king of Syria was so Furious
[1:23:14] thinking that he has some people in his
[1:23:18] own Camp revealing his secret to the
[1:23:21] Israelites and they told him a king
[1:23:23] don't think like that none of us will

[1:27:03] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:27:06] the strength of my life or Whom Shall I
[1:27:09] be afraid when the wicked even my
[1:27:13] enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat
[1:27:16] up my flesh they stumble and they fell
[1:27:19] though and horse shoe and come against
[1:27:22] me my heart shall not fear though War
[1:27:26] should Rise Against Me In days will I be
[1:27:30] confident one thing
[1:27:42] Hallelujah
[1:27:48] amen this is a prayer of the believer
[1:27:53] oh Hallelujah and when you jump to that
[1:27:55] verse 11 he says what he said teach me
[1:27:58] the way teach me thy way oh Lord and
[1:28:02] Lead Me in a plain path because of my
[1:28:05] enemies
[1:28:07] Lord
[1:28:09] I want to be surrounded Always by your
[1:28:12] protection
[1:28:13] Lord without you I am nothing
[1:28:18] Lord I want to be under your Shadow at
[1:28:21] all times
[1:28:23] and the prophet said in them little
[1:28:25] fellows who could mistreat one of these
[1:28:28] by the way
[1:28:30] you should never do that
[1:28:32] you know Jesus said
[1:28:34] take heed that you dispatch not one of
[1:28:37] these little ones
[1:28:38] for their Angels always behold my
[1:28:40] father's face which is in heaven
[1:28:43] remember they have an angel
[1:28:47] when you are born he stays with you
[1:28:50] through life
[1:28:52] and now then when you get saved you have
[1:28:55] the Holy Spirit then
[1:28:58] and it guides you
[1:29:00] do you know
[1:29:02] that when Lazarus
[1:29:04] was he
[1:29:06] he was poor
[1:29:10] he has saw all over the body
[1:29:13] but did you know that that man had
[1:29:15] angels
[1:29:17] guiding him
[1:29:19] it doesn't matter whether you are poor
[1:29:21] or Rich
[1:29:24] evil a child of God
[1:29:26] you have an angel around you
[1:29:29] the bible say that when Lazarus died
[1:29:34] and just carried him
[1:29:36] to the bosom of Abraham
[1:29:42] where did they come from
[1:29:44] they were always around him
[1:29:48] they were always around him and when
[1:29:51] that rich man died he was buried
[1:29:54] so there is difference here brother
[1:29:56] sister
[1:29:57] take note of that
[1:29:59] not all the people are buried
[1:30:02] so when they live here Angels carried
[1:30:05] them straight
[1:30:09] and there are others who are buried
[1:30:12] and they go to hell
[1:30:15] and that was exactly what happened
[1:30:16] between Lazarus and this rich man
[1:30:21] I don't want to go into that story
[1:30:23] Hallelujah but you know it amen
[1:30:27] Hallelujah
[1:30:29] now
[1:30:30] let me call this okay and we'll close
[1:30:34] do you believe
[1:30:37] are you in a refuge
[1:30:39] you have a right to every privilege that
[1:30:41] God has
[1:30:42] if you are in there you believe that
[1:30:46] are you happy to be in this Refuge it's
[1:30:49] a question for all of us
[1:30:52] Hallelujah
[1:30:54] can you just sit back
[1:30:57] and let up the pressure
[1:30:59] say thanks be to God
[1:31:01] I finally made it
[1:31:03] I am here by the grace of God
[1:31:06] I am in the safety zone
[1:31:09] nothing can harm me now
[1:31:12] I am in a safety zone nothing can harm
[1:31:15] me now

[1:32:03] there are angels all around
[1:32:09] last year
[1:32:11] let me share this testimony with you
[1:32:13] before I close
[1:32:15] last year
[1:32:17] there was a sister there is a sister in
[1:32:19] my church
[1:32:20] that was kidnapped by kidnappers
[1:32:23] and uh
[1:32:25] they told her
[1:32:28] after they kidnapped because she didn't
[1:32:30] know that she had been kidnapped
[1:32:33] when he boarded the car
[1:32:35] they took another Direction
[1:32:38] and he said why are you taking me he
[1:32:40] said they said shut up we are going to
[1:32:42] kill you
[1:32:44] you know what God did
[1:32:47] confusion broke between them
[1:32:50] and now they said well after all you are
[1:32:53] not the type of
[1:32:54] the women we want
[1:32:58] can you imagine that
[1:33:00] so give us money and we'll release you
[1:33:03] she said I don't have money
[1:33:06] if you want let me call someone
[1:33:08] and the person can transfer money on
[1:33:10] your phone if you like they say no we
[1:33:12] don't want anybody to transfer any money
[1:33:13] to us
[1:33:15] give us money from your wallet this is a
[1:33:17] wallet they check the wallet there was
[1:33:18] nothing in
[1:33:20] you know what they did
[1:33:21] they go to a Darkness place and they
[1:33:23] dump their sister somewhere after they
[1:33:25] had made her naked in the car
[1:33:28] the sister got up
[1:33:30] she didn't know where she was
[1:33:32] then quickly she put her dress on
[1:33:35] and thankful to the Lord he met a man
[1:33:38] and asked where am I
[1:33:40] he said oh you are so sweating so yeah
[1:33:42] now go forward there is a station there
[1:33:45] you can board a car and go to wherever
[1:33:46] you want
[1:33:47] you are going and a sister
[1:33:49] by God's grace go to the station and
[1:33:52] boarded another car and he went home
[1:33:55] that was last year
[1:33:57] this year also
[1:34:00] on the 28th February
[1:34:03] there's another sister in the church
[1:34:05] I don't know why the devil always want
[1:34:07] to target the people of God
[1:34:10] but it's sometimes good so they'll go
[1:34:12] and can have testimonies
[1:34:14] sister Lucas was going to town that very
[1:34:18] day
[1:34:19] to attend to one or two things
[1:34:21] and so when she came to the road sign
[1:34:24] and stopped the taxi
[1:34:26] she realized that there were three men
[1:34:28] already seated at the back seat so of
[1:34:31] course she has to go to the front
[1:34:34] so she opened the door
[1:34:36] and sat
[1:34:39] before the driver moved the car then one
[1:34:41] of the men
[1:34:42] made a statement
[1:34:44] that we've got one meat
[1:34:47] oh
[1:34:50] not one chicken
[1:34:51] but one meat
[1:34:53] so the sister was alarmed what kind of a
[1:34:55] statement is this
[1:34:57] so there and then
[1:34:59] she told the driver that driver I want
[1:35:01] to get down please
[1:35:03] the driver will not stop
[1:35:06] he said driver
[1:35:07] I want to get down
[1:35:10] the driver was still
[1:35:14] what in the car why do you want me to
[1:35:15] stop for you to get down he said no I've
[1:35:17] forgotten something at home let me go
[1:35:19] get it
[1:35:21] the driver said no way
[1:35:24] and his head off
[1:35:26] after
[1:35:28] he drove about four to five hundred
[1:35:30] years
[1:35:32] they came and met three men standing by
[1:35:35] the roadside
[1:35:37] and one of the men stopped the driver
[1:35:39] and the driver stopped
[1:35:42] and the man asked the driver
[1:35:45] I have heard the voice of this lady
[1:35:48] from afar
[1:35:51] that she will get down why are you not
[1:35:54] stopping the car
[1:35:58] and then
[1:36:00] because she he has stopped they stopped
[1:36:02] got the chance open the door and go down
[1:36:06] and she banged the door
[1:36:10] she was telling to say thank you to the
[1:36:12] men and nobody was behind her
[1:36:16] [Applause]
[1:36:17] Hallelujah
[1:36:19] nobody was behind her
[1:36:22] so she came to church
[1:36:23] and told me pastor this what happened to
[1:36:25] me I said sister go to the church
[1:36:27] immediately and go and testify to the
[1:36:29] glory of God let their brothers and
[1:36:31] sisters know that angels are always

[1:36:36] Hallelujah

[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:42] and I said well

[1:36:46] happened
[1:36:47] I remember in those days

[1:36:53] and there were some three men that came
[1:36:55] to pass

[1:37:01] that spoke
[1:37:03] with an assurance to Abraham he said I
[1:37:06] will visit you next year by this time
