[35:27] certainly
[35:27] appreciate being here with you all it's

[35:32] though we've been absent and body our
[35:34] hearts are with you we pray for the
[35:36] church every day we
[35:37] sure love you and we're glad to be with
[35:39] you once again and uh

[35:42] confidence that if i go out of here
[35:44] today and i don't see you again in this
[35:46] life
[35:46] we'll meet each other on the other side
[35:48] of the river amen we just thank god for
[35:50] his mercy
[35:52] for all he's done for us the time would
[35:53] fail if we just stood here just begin to
[35:55] testify about all that god's done in
[35:56] each of our lives
[35:58] but we sure want to be mindful of him
[36:00] and make sure to give him praise
[36:02] let's just bow our heads for word of
[36:03] prayer this morning heavenly father
[36:07] we are so thankful for your goodness to
[36:09] us as the
[36:10] apostle paul said it is the goodness of
[36:12] god that leads us to repentance
[36:16] lord when i think of the life that i
[36:17] used to have in this world
[36:19] i think of the places have been the past
[36:21] that i have
[36:22] the different things in my life that i
[36:24] had no power to overcome
[36:26] lord i had there was a better way there
[36:29] was something greater
[36:31] a goodness of god and mercy but for the
[36:34] least of us for the very worst of us
[36:37] lord you've loved us when we were
[36:39] unlovable
[36:41] lord you saved us when it seemed like we
[36:42] were unsavable
[36:44] father you've done marvelous things it's
[36:47] your work and it's marvelous in our eyes
[36:50] lord i'm standing before people today
[36:52] they're not just another people
[36:54] they're the purchase of the blood of
[36:57] jesus christ
[36:59] lord if i had your your natural
[37:02] chemistry in a little vile today
[37:04] lord i would treasure it more than maybe
[37:07] any other possession
[37:08] and that i have lord and to think what
[37:10] it would mean just to have a couple
[37:12] drops of that blood
[37:14] that was shed for one so unworthy as i
[37:18] look what it would mean to me what what
[37:19] an attachment i would have to it
[37:21] but father to know the life of that
[37:23] blood that the purchase that blood is
[37:26] standing before me even this morning
[37:28] father i just pray you'd come and do
[37:30] which only you can do lord i
[37:31] i'm not worthy to speak to this but none
[37:34] of us are worthy of this morning but by
[37:35] your grace
[37:37] by your mercy by your election lord
[37:40] you've made us
[37:41] able to stand before you to look upon
[37:43] your holy face
[37:45] lord what a what an unspeakable gift
[37:47] you've given unto us i
[37:49] i pray you just come and strengthen and
[37:52] establish and
[37:53] settle each heart here today lord if
[37:55] there'd be one maybe they back slit on
[37:57] your lord maybe they're away from you
[37:59] i pray lord you'd come and restore such
[38:01] one lord forgive us all or we backslide
[38:04] every day the prophet said
[38:06] lord forgive us our sins forgive us our
[38:08] shortcomings lord we're so grateful
[38:11] that your grace is greater than our sin
[38:14] it's your mercy it's greater than our
[38:16] failings
[38:17] lord we love you today we give you
[38:19] praise
[38:20] may you receive all praise now in glory
[38:23] and honor
[38:23] bless the reading of your word we pray
[38:26] and we thank you in the mighty name of
[38:28] our lord and savior jesus christ
[38:31] amen and amen god bless you as you turn
[38:34] with me this morning
[38:35] in your bibles a couple different places
[38:36] when we look in the book of revelation
[38:38] the third
[38:39] chapter and then we'll be going over to
[38:41] proverbs chapter nine
[38:43] uh the thought i've kind of mentioned on
[38:44] here recently and i just thought it
[38:46] would be
[38:47] by the grace of god i felt like to share
[38:49] it i have a couple prayer cloths here
[38:52] we just uh we'll trust the lord will
[38:55] bless those for the further game's
[38:56] kingdom as well we know that scripture
[38:57] amen
[38:58] so we believe that and i believe that
[39:01] god can do
[39:03] as i say so often the scripture says he
[39:04] can do exceeding abundantly
[39:07] above what we could ask or think many
[39:09] times we limit god with our own
[39:10] imagination
[39:11] amen we say well maybe god can use me
[39:13] this way god can do this
[39:14] he can do more than you can ask or think
[39:18] amen now if you come with an ex a great
[39:20] expectation this morning
[39:22] how much more can he do amen believe
[39:24] that we believe he's faithful
[39:26] revelation the third chapter let's just
[39:28] read verses 12
[39:30] and 13. now i bookmarked my bible and i
[39:32] didn't even bookmark it in the right
[39:33] place so i don't know what the point of
[39:34] the bookmark was
[39:36] but i think we can get it there uh the
[39:39] scripture says in verse 12
[39:40] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[39:43] in the temple of my god
[39:44] he shall go out no more and i will write
[39:47] upon him the name of my god
[39:50] and the name of the city of my god which
[39:52] is the new jerusalem
[39:53] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[39:55] god and i will write upon him
[39:57] my new name he that hath an ear to hear
[40:00] let him hear with the spirit
[40:01] saith unto the churches amen
[40:04] and uh just to give a context to where
[40:06] i'm looking at this morning by the grace
[40:08] of god we'll turn to
[40:09] proverbs the ninth chapter here
[40:12] proverbs chapter nine we'll just read
[40:13] the first six verses
[40:15] together this morning and uh i know i
[40:18] said that sorry but sure good to see you
[40:20] all by the way
[40:22] just uh man i'm just excited uh
[40:25] god is good all the time amen proverbs
[40:28] chapter nine
[40:29] verse one to six it says wisdom hath
[40:31] builded her house
[40:33] she's hewn out her seven pillars she has
[40:35] killed her beast she hath mingled her
[40:37] wine she has also furnished
[40:39] her table she has set forth her maidens
[40:42] she cries upon the highest places of the
[40:44] city
[40:45] whoso is simple let him turn in hither
[40:49] as for him that wanteth understanding
[40:52] she saith to
[40:53] him come eat of my bread and drink of
[40:55] the wine which i
[40:57] have mingled forsake the foolish and
[40:59] live and go
[41:01] in the way of understanding may the lord
[41:04] bless the reading of his word as you're
[41:05] seated
[41:06] this morning i'd like to take a thought
[41:10] here
[41:10] the house the house of seven pillars
[41:13] amen
[41:15] and this ninth chapter of the book of
[41:18] proverbs
[41:19] when you read for the first nine ten
[41:21] chapters there the book of proverbs
[41:23] dealing with two different kinds of
[41:24] women
[41:25] and it's not speaking of two literal
[41:27] specific women although there's
[41:28] characteristics that could
[41:30] certainly be attributed to different
[41:31] kinds of women but it's a father's
[41:33] instruction to his son about wisdom
[41:35] and folly amen so these uh these
[41:39] these attributes of wisdom and folly
[41:41] they are personified
[41:42] as these women and uh there's so many
[41:45] different thoughts and ideas i'm sure
[41:46] that you could preach on this but
[41:48] what i want to look at this morning and
[41:49] this afternoon as a type
[41:52] is as the body of christ of the churches
[41:54] today
[41:55] and the reason i say that brother
[41:56] branham he makes a statement if you want
[41:58] to know the national status
[42:00] he says you watch israel amen you can
[42:02] look in the middle east today
[42:03] and uh there's so many different pieces
[42:05] of chords being made it's it's in the
[42:06] news
[42:07] all this peace is taking place we know
[42:09] the scripture says when they say
[42:11] peace and safety then sudden destruction
[42:13] comes upon them and so
[42:15] we see that all the pieces nationally
[42:17] speaking they're
[42:18] falling into place for what the lord has
[42:19] prophesied would happen to the gentile
[42:21] kingdoms we know through the vision of
[42:23] the
[42:23] prophet daniel what would happen to
[42:25] these kingdoms in the end time amen
[42:27] so when you look at israel you can see
[42:28] the national status but brother bram
[42:30] says
[42:31] if you want to see the condition of the
[42:32] church you look at the morals of the
[42:35] women he says
[42:36] amen so we and why i say that we look at
[42:40] the morals of the women and
[42:41] we have all kinds of denominations and
[42:43] ideas today but what i want you to
[42:45] understand is except the lord
[42:47] builds the house they labor in vain that
[42:49] build it amen
[42:50] there's many things that man has made
[42:53] and there's many things that man has
[42:54] fostered
[42:55] but those things cannot withstand that
[42:56] evil day amen
[42:58] but there's a there's a bride on the
[42:59] face of the earth and i believe that
[43:01] she's not ordained unto wrath
[43:03] but to obtain salvation through our lord
[43:06] jesus christ i hope you believe you're
[43:07] one of them today
[43:08] amen because i you know you've got
[43:10] you've got church you've got
[43:10] denominational churches today i might
[43:12] just start preaching amen
[43:13] you've got denominational churches today
[43:15] amen and and uh we were just driving by
[43:17] one the other day
[43:18] and they're preaching tribulation
[43:19] they're getting ready for tribulation
[43:20] they're storing up canned goods and
[43:22] they're building bunkers and they're
[43:23] getting ready to go in the tribulation
[43:24] i'm thinking well
[43:25] they're preaching their dangerous
[43:26] message because that's exactly where
[43:28] they're going amen
[43:29] but for you and i that have heard a
[43:31] prophet's message we've heard a voice
[43:33] call us to come up higher that's not
[43:35] where we're building our house
[43:37] we're seeking a city that has
[43:39] foundations
[43:40] whose builder and maker is god god has
[43:42] prepared for us
[43:43] a great way of escape amen so the spirit
[43:46] of god in a bright body
[43:48] the scripture tells you look back in the
[43:49] book of ephesians the second chapter
[43:51] he's building a habitation through the
[43:54] spirit amen
[43:55] that's what i'm talking about at the
[43:56] church about his church not what calls
[43:58] itself church not a man's building
[44:00] his church the prophet says his church
[44:03] is himself
[44:04] revealed and then so this is actually
[44:07] god and
[44:08] unveiling or revealing himself in the
[44:10] body of christ
[44:12] that's why i probably could come along
[44:13] and preach in the rising of the sun
[44:15] that she is now bone of his bone she's
[44:18] flush with his flesh
[44:19] she's warned of his word she is him amen
[44:23] so we look at this this personification
[44:25] of wisdom i believe we can look at it as
[44:27] christ
[44:28] in the bride amen you say now where are
[44:31] you coming with this listen the
[44:32] book this bible tells you it's a bible
[44:35] in the book of proverbs the third
[44:36] chapter
[44:37] the bible tells you about this woman
[44:38] wisdom it says that that her words she's
[44:41] a tree
[44:42] of life to them that lay hold on her
[44:44] amen
[44:45] praise the lord she's a tree of light
[44:47] now the prophet tells you when christ
[44:49] come he hung out tree of disgrace he is
[44:51] that tree of life
[44:52] but he was hanged by the romans on a
[44:54] tree of disgrace that he might die
[44:56] in his resurrection the manifestation
[44:59] that had
[44:59] created a church by the baptism of the
[45:02] holy ghost that could come back
[45:04] on the lives of the people amen and that
[45:06] same church through church ages
[45:08] through denomination through darkness
[45:10] through man's ideas increased it was
[45:12] veiled again it was cut down but the
[45:14] prophet says in the end time
[45:17] at the end of seven church ages the same
[45:19] jesus christ that hung back there on the
[45:21] cross that same tree of life that was
[45:23] manifested there
[45:24] there was a bride tree a bride body that
[45:27] was going to be restored
[45:28] and the restoration of that bride tree
[45:31] he said it
[45:32] is the tree of life restore back to him
[45:36] and then praise the lord someone we
[45:37] don't have to go find eden this morning
[45:39] and find a tree of life to lay hold of
[45:42] it's in our midst today
[45:44] it's the same jesus christ the life of
[45:46] jesus christ
[45:47] he's here in the rock today building his
[45:49] habitation
[45:51] amen praise the lord so it's the spirit
[45:53] of wisdom and revelation the bible says
[45:55] in the knowledge of him that's what's
[45:57] building the church today that's what's
[45:58] building us up today
[46:00] man he's not come to tear us down and
[46:03] when the world's ordained to be
[46:04] destroyed but he's come
[46:05] to lift you up he's come to strengthen
[46:08] and establish and settle you amen
[46:12] that's why the prophet can say that the
[46:13] husband and the wife they though they
[46:15] have a different body it's the self-same
[46:17] spirit amen
[46:18] it's not some second or third or lesser
[46:20] portion of him today
[46:21] the spirit of god the same life that
[46:24] coming across the calvary
[46:26] is here today the same holy ghost
[46:29] that philip pentecost he's here today
[46:32] we're not looking for we're not waiting
[46:34] for it he come to us
[46:36] he revealed to us that he is the same
[46:39] amen the same word that speaks to the
[46:41] bridegroom he speaks of the bride today
[46:44] amen
[46:45] hallelujah listen daniel by vision i
[46:47] mentioned just a moment about
[46:48] daniel by vision he saw this one
[46:51] he was a great stone he was hewd out
[46:54] amen
[46:54] but not by man's hands amen well i'm
[46:57] going somewhere now amen
[46:59] this great stone that would bring in the
[47:00] destruction of the gentile kingdoms
[47:03] it was not heat up by a man's hands god
[47:06] healed this out
[47:07] god brought this to pass amen hallelujah
[47:10] and the same intelligence let me listen
[47:12] to me now the same intelligence
[47:14] that hewed that stone out he's the same
[47:16] intelligence today
[47:18] wisdom hewed her seven pillars he's the
[47:20] same life today doing the same thing
[47:22] he's not pillars today when he built
[47:25] this habitation
[47:26] he said wisdom he got seven pillars to
[47:28] do it
[47:30] amen praise the lord so this spiritual
[47:32] habitation
[47:33] this church that i'm talking about a
[47:34] bride body it's not been fashioned by
[47:37] man's hands
[47:38] i mean we're not flirting with the world
[47:39] today this is the orchestration of god
[47:42] almighty
[47:43] human hands didn't do in your life for
[47:45] you what god has done for you today amen
[47:47] it's not built with education it's not
[47:50] built by philosophy
[47:51] it's not built by creator dogma but the
[47:53] architect of this temple
[47:55] is none other than that same king
[47:57] melchizedek
[47:58] that come to abraham and that same one
[48:01] is
[48:02] today it's built strictly upon and
[48:04] strictly by
[48:05] the revelation of jesus christ
[48:08] amen brother talks about this in the
[48:11] ephesian church age in the church age
[48:12] book he says
[48:13] that the church beginning in the book of
[48:15] accidents god's blueprint for all ages
[48:18] amen now he clarifies remember god's
[48:21] thoughts are not like a man's drawing of
[48:23] a blueprint
[48:24] all right so when he talks about a
[48:25] blueprint he's not talking about well
[48:26] we've got this
[48:27] this thing on paper and it's all a
[48:29] theory it's whole idea and maybe someday
[48:32] and then but god saws their eternal
[48:35] god's thoughts are real
[48:37] so when god laid out his plan i'm
[48:39] getting some i don't know what's popping
[48:40] here amen
[48:41] am i hitting something or well praise
[48:44] the lord
[48:44] i'll just preach through it i guess
[48:45] whatever amen
[48:48] but when god lays out his plan his
[48:49] blueprint for a spiritual habitation
[48:52] he's got seven pillars that are hewed
[48:54] out for this supporting of the structure
[48:56] not just being oh i gotta preface this
[48:58] real quick i'm i'm not a contractor i'm
[49:00] not an architect i'm not a
[49:01] i'm not a builder so anything i say here
[49:04] if i say it and someone's like well you
[49:05] know
[49:06] because there's always something that
[49:07] knows more than you about something so
[49:10] i'm not saying this as a guy that's
[49:12] actually put up pillars before
[49:14] emma but in the prophet talks about this
[49:16] what the pillar does i mean
[49:18] when we talk about a pillar i'm not
[49:19] talking about something decorative right
[49:21] i mean i'm not talking about a wall
[49:22] hanging you've got pillars nowadays and
[49:23] they're decorative pillars and you put
[49:24] them in a house
[49:25] we're not talking a decorative pillar
[49:27] man we're not talking about a pillar
[49:29] that's just there to look at
[49:30] we're talking about a column or a
[49:32] load-bearing structure
[49:34] in other words it's something that the
[49:35] building is built upon that it can't
[49:37] stand without it
[49:38] it's built in a certain way to hold up a
[49:40] certain kind of pressure
[49:42] and then pressure's actually what causes
[49:44] the pillar
[49:45] to have a function it's there to support
[49:48] something
[49:49] it's theirs that when wait and trials
[49:51] and burdens come
[49:52] you can rest on that pillar amen
[49:55] hallelujah
[49:55] and god's got pillars the scripture here
[49:58] we read it he's got seven pillars i
[49:59] don't and god
[50:00] god fashions his pillars not like a
[50:03] vertical column but he fastens them like
[50:04] men
[50:05] right and then he fastens them out of
[50:07] people like you and i hey man
[50:08] i believe god has seven church age
[50:10] messengers that he's built through seven
[50:12] church ages
[50:13] to build the new testament church and
[50:15] the life and the testimony that they had
[50:17] the revelation
[50:18] of jesus christ for their day is what
[50:21] the church is built upon
[50:23] amen he builds them like kind of like
[50:25] michelangelo brother talks about he
[50:26] built that masterpiece hey man
[50:28] listen when michelangelo he took that
[50:30] masterpiece he took that block of marble
[50:32] brother and says and he began to chip
[50:34] away at
[50:34] it i want you to notice he didn't go and
[50:37] get a 3d printer
[50:38] and fabricated out of thin air he didn't
[50:41] get a bunch of stuff and tape it
[50:42] together
[50:43] with a bunch of duct tape and some super
[50:44] glue and then he actually had a big old
[50:46] block there
[50:47] and he didn't have to add anything to it
[50:49] he just had to remove some stuff from
[50:51] the earth
[50:52] that was in the way amen because listen
[50:55] the pillar's got to have the right kind
[50:56] of integrity
[50:57] he'll hold away so you think about
[51:00] michelangelo and i was just reading
[51:02] about this here a few weeks ago when i
[51:03] was looking at this
[51:04] and michelangelo i guess i didn't really
[51:06] realize this until i began to study a
[51:08] little bit but
[51:09] michelangelo when he began to do my uh
[51:11] this this sculpture of moses it wasn't
[51:13] the only sculpture he's doing he
[51:14] actually had a whole
[51:15] uh gallery of them he was actually
[51:17] commissioned to do this over the time
[51:19] the space of 40 years which i thought
[51:22] was remarkable hey man think about that
[51:24] you're
[51:24] getting paid to do one job for 40 years
[51:26] now sometimes you work in a factory this
[51:28] that same thing but this guy's like look
[51:29] i want you to make a masterpiece
[51:31] and i'm going to give you 40 years to do
[51:32] it so here he is he's
[51:34] wheeling these big blocks or however he
[51:36] gets them in there i don't know he might
[51:37] be really strong at all
[51:38] will's these big old box in there and
[51:40] he's got this one sitting there
[51:41] and here is a big old stone you look at
[51:43] it and say well there's just a big old
[51:45] block
[51:45] he said no that's moses hallelujah you
[51:48] might not have seen anything that looked
[51:49] like moses
[51:50] in that block but it was a moses amen
[51:52] and i was reading one of the
[51:53] commentaries about uh this guy who knows
[51:55] a lot more about art than i do
[51:57] but he's talking about the the the the
[51:59] intricacy
[52:00] of the development of moses he's talking
[52:02] about the different folds of his garment
[52:03] how
[52:04] how lifelike he says and he says
[52:05] particularly he says the long glossy
[52:07] beard
[52:09] and the hairs he says they're so
[52:11] difficult to render in scripture
[52:13] yet when you look at this marvel it says
[52:15] it looks so soft and
[52:16] downy he says it seems that the iron
[52:19] chisel
[52:20] had become a brush hallelujah think
[52:23] about this
[52:24] listen if i get a chisel it's going to
[52:25] look like i use a chisel on something
[52:27] but this man he was such an artist he
[52:30] had such a capability to wield this
[52:32] chisel tool it looked like the strokes
[52:34] of a brush when he got done amen
[52:36] and i think of the prophet how he talked
[52:38] about how michelangelo's just rubbing
[52:39] rubbing rubble on that spot you know we
[52:40] just hear that sometimes
[52:42] we just kind of gloss over but i want
[52:43] you to think about this this is over the
[52:45] space of 40 years
[52:47] this man might walk into work one day
[52:50] and he sees the statue of moses
[52:52] he just begins to rub and gets a little
[52:54] 120 out or maybe a little 200 or
[52:56] whatever
[52:57] he begins to sand this thing he might
[52:59] spend all day
[53:00] working on one spot all right listen he
[53:03] might spend a week
[53:04] working on one spot and you and i if we
[53:07] don't know what we're looking for like
[53:08] me
[53:08] we would walk and say it look like he
[53:10] didn't do anything all week
[53:12] i'm paying this guy to make a
[53:14] masterpiece he hadn't done nothing all
[53:16] week oh he's doing something
[53:18] just because you didn't see it doesn't
[53:20] mean he's not doing something
[53:23] hey remember listen he's concerned about
[53:25] the details
[53:27] this man is not just making listen
[53:29] michelangelo
[53:30] was inspired for this masterpiece he was
[53:33] so inspired until he struck it and cried
[53:35] out that it would speak
[53:36] this is more than just a day job of this
[53:38] man amen
[53:40] he's getting paid but to this man it's
[53:42] more than just a job
[53:43] it's more than just putting food on the
[53:45] table he had a recognition
[53:47] my life for 40 years is going to be tied
[53:50] up in this
[53:51] this this sculpture this masterpiece
[53:54] sort of hits more than just a job this
[53:56] is his legacy
[53:57] this is what he's going to be known for
[53:59] if he's ever going to be known for
[54:01] anything
[54:01] this is the thing people are going to
[54:02] look at it they're going to scrutinize
[54:04] it
[54:04] they're going to talk about it they're
[54:06] going to try to imitate it his whole
[54:08] life his
[54:09] artistry his passion was tied up in this
[54:11] masterpiece
[54:12] so he's not willing just to do a halfway
[54:14] job
[54:16] he's not willing to say well i've got it
[54:17] done and pencil whip it trying to get
[54:19] out of the way
[54:20] he said no i'm going to take my time
[54:22] every detail is important to him
[54:24] i want you to understand your life every
[54:26] detail is important to god
[54:27] even when you don't see it sometimes
[54:29] maybe you don't think it's important to
[54:31] god maybe you think god
[54:32] he's not working anymore i want to
[54:34] assure you this morning
[54:36] god's still doing the work sometimes it
[54:39] looks like maybe you're praying for
[54:41] somebody and you say it's been weeks or
[54:42] months or years
[54:43] don't look like god's doing nothing
[54:45] listen he's not in a hurry
[54:48] but he wants to make sure it looks right
[54:50] when he's done that's what he's worried
[54:52] about
[54:53] he trying to send you far from my lost
[54:55] loved one listen he's sending you back
[54:57] some second or third rate job
[54:59] he wants to make sure when that
[55:01] masterpiece is in the gallery
[55:03] when he's got a hall of heroes it looks
[55:05] just right
[55:07] it's going to have the right kind of a
[55:09] testimony he's going to have the right
[55:11] kind of a background
[55:13] you've got to have the right kind of
[55:14] furniture in the spirit in your life
[55:16] sometimes you think god ain't doing
[55:18] nothing
[55:18] god used to do this in my life and god
[55:21] used to do that and
[55:22] where's god in my life it seems like i'm
[55:23] not going anywhere sometimes that's when
[55:25] god's working
[55:27] and just because you can't see it listen
[55:29] he's got a lot better eye for detail
[55:30] than you or i do
[55:32] he sees things in your life you don't
[55:34] even see
[55:35] there's things buried under this
[55:37] humanity you can't even see it
[55:40] you say oh but i'm 50 i'm 60 i'm 70
[55:42] listen god dealt with moses
[55:44] the man when he was 80 years old
[55:48] don't tell me god's done working on his
[55:50] church today
[55:51] he's not taking a break he's not on
[55:53] vacation
[55:54] his hand is still on the masterpiece
[55:57] today
[55:58] if god took you out of the miry clay if
[56:01] god put your feet on a rock
[56:02] if god called you if god separated you
[56:05] if god brought you here today
[56:07] his hand is still on his masterpiece
[56:11] i want to encourage you today don't ever
[56:12] think god's not doing nothing in your
[56:14] life
[56:14] sometimes he's doing it even when you
[56:16] don't even see it
[56:17] [Applause]
[56:20] oh hallelujah he's gonna take his time
[56:24] he's gonna be just right listen he's not
[56:27] hurt he's been doing this for thousands
[56:29] of years
[56:30] we get in a hurry we get worried well i
[56:32] don't know if it could be
[56:33] what about this and what about he didn't
[56:35] know hey
[56:36] he says you know i've got one
[56:38] masterpiece i've got one shot
[56:40] he's not building a second or third
[56:42] bride
[56:44] he's not saying well i'm gonna toss this
[56:45] one up listen i don't believe
[56:47] that a prophet come and preach this
[56:49] generation for it to all fall away
[56:51] nobody believed it
[56:52] there is some money no matter what the
[56:56] critics say
[56:57] no matter what happens in the government
[56:59] no matter what you go through
[57:00] there's somebody that's going to receive
[57:03] it because god said i'm going to have a
[57:05] church without spot without limits
[57:08] no wrinkles it's going to look exactly
[57:11] the way i had it played out in my mind
[57:14] [Music]
[57:18] listen god's got to get these men put my
[57:20] messengers now
[57:21] he's got to get these men in just the
[57:23] right condition
[57:24] to be pillars in this house because the
[57:27] testimonies of every believer in that
[57:29] age
[57:29] is going to rest on that pillar
[57:32] it's going to rest on that message if
[57:34] they receive it or if they reject it
[57:36] amen
[57:38] now like i said i'm not an architect but
[57:40] to my understanding
[57:41] there's three main things you look at
[57:43] when you get a pillar and you're trying
[57:44] to put this up amen
[57:45] it's gonna be the right kind of material
[57:47] right hey man if you're trying to build
[57:48] a big old house full of marble
[57:50] you're gonna sit there and put some you
[57:52] know something made out of play-doh
[57:53] under there
[57:54] and it's got to be the right kind of
[57:55] material in the first place he's got to
[57:57] choose out bride material
[57:59] he's not going to choose out worldly
[58:01] material or which he wants the
[58:02] denominational material he's looking for
[58:04] bright material
[58:05] to build his house out of it's got to be
[58:07] the right kind of material
[58:09] it's got to be hewed out or shaped down
[58:12] to fit in there and then you don't just
[58:14] take a block and stick it in there it's
[58:15] got to be fitted just right
[58:17] because everything's going to wrestle
[58:18] it's got to be laid in there just right
[58:22] that's the third thing it's going to be
[58:23] in the right position taught my adoption
[58:25] a little bit here this morning
[58:26] he's got to be in the right position
[58:28] when he places that pillar let's say we
[58:30] put a big pillar in the middle of this
[58:31] room
[58:32] we place it there listen if there's even
[58:33] just a little bit of deviation
[58:35] the whole thing is it's subject to fall
[58:38] over
[58:38] so there's got to be a line somewhere
[58:40] there's got to be a plummet somewhere
[58:42] where you can say this is exactly how
[58:44] it's got to lay
[58:45] and the bible tells you this word of god
[58:47] it is a plummet
[58:49] it's got to stay right with the word of
[58:50] god you believe that
[58:53] so there's no room for deviations
[58:54] because it's got to do the job just
[58:56] right
[58:57] now the prophet tells you that paul had
[58:58] a ministry like that he said his manner
[59:00] of ministering
[59:01] he set the pattern for all future
[59:04] messengers that they were inspired he's
[59:05] actually for every true minister
[59:07] i might say this way even for every
[59:08] christian can i say that right i don't i
[59:10] don't think we're called to not bring
[59:12] forth fruit
[59:13] i don't believe we're called to believe
[59:14] air right remember he said he said he
[59:16] said it's
[59:17] a pattern for everybody to follow after
[59:19] he says there's a three-four
[59:21] three-fold quality of that he's at first
[59:23] paul was absolutely true to the word
[59:25] he says he never deviated from it
[59:28] no matter the cost in other words he's
[59:31] got to be right in the right spot amen
[59:33] he said his ministry was in the power of
[59:35] the spirit
[59:36] demonstrating the spoken and the written
[59:38] word that's the right kind of material
[59:40] amen
[59:41] he said he had the fruit or the evident
[59:43] fruit of a god-given
[59:45] ministry amen so this man if i could
[59:47] send this to this pillar
[59:49] in the first church ages messenger he
[59:51] had a threefold quality to him
[59:52] and every other one is built after this
[59:54] because god builds it all the same way
[59:56] amen so he's got a certain pattern laid
[59:59] out there you think of the apostle paul
[1:00:00] when he meets these men
[1:00:02] james and peter and john he talks about
[1:00:04] the book of galatians believes the
[1:00:05] second chapter
[1:00:06] he says he met these men and he and they
[1:00:08] appeared to be pillars
[1:00:11] he said but these men that appear to be
[1:00:12] pillars when they recognized the grace
[1:00:14] that god had extended to him
[1:00:17] amen they gave their end to fellowship
[1:00:19] he says that we might go
[1:00:20] and preach to the gentiles or the
[1:00:22] uncircumcision
[1:00:23] let me say it this way they acknowledged
[1:00:25] his revelation
[1:00:27] that he was the apostle to the gentiles
[1:00:29] that was the revelation of christ
[1:00:31] for their day and then second peter
[1:00:33] chapter 3 tells you this verse 15
[1:00:35] and 16 he says we account that the
[1:00:37] longsuffering of our lord
[1:00:39] is salvation even as our beloved brother
[1:00:42] paul
[1:00:42] also according to the wisdom see there's
[1:00:44] that wisdom again
[1:00:46] given unto him written unto you as also
[1:00:49] in all his epistles
[1:00:51] speaking in them of these things and
[1:00:54] which are some things hard to be
[1:00:55] understood
[1:00:56] which they that are unlearned and
[1:00:58] unstable rest as they
[1:01:00] do also the other scriptures right
[1:01:03] so even peter's acknowledging this man's
[1:01:05] epistles are scripture
[1:01:07] because they wrestle with it like they
[1:01:08] do the other scriptures
[1:01:11] amen under their own destruction listen
[1:01:14] paul was so certain
[1:01:15] that this ministry was something you
[1:01:17] could build a church on a man he was so
[1:01:19] certain about it he said if an angel
[1:01:21] comes from heaven
[1:01:22] right now another man comes in if i come
[1:01:24] if anybody comes
[1:01:25] and tries to lay something else besides
[1:01:28] this
[1:01:29] let him be a curse these men even the
[1:01:32] apostle paul
[1:01:33] they recognize this gospel is exactly
[1:01:35] according
[1:01:36] to the word of god or the planet so
[1:01:39] there's no other way to build it there's
[1:01:40] nothing else to rest it upon
[1:01:42] amen you could build every other pillar
[1:01:44] in the same manner as this one and it
[1:01:46] would do the same thing
[1:01:47] because it's made of the same kind of
[1:01:49] material it's cute out the same way
[1:01:51] it's put in its own position amen
[1:01:54] amen paul says it this way he knows his
[1:01:58] own mystery
[1:01:58] or his own ministry in first corinthians
[1:02:00] three says the grace that god gave him
[1:02:02] is a
[1:02:02] wise master builder all right man praise
[1:02:05] the lord
[1:02:06] see today you know most buildings like
[1:02:08] this building we've got these studs in
[1:02:09] the walls
[1:02:10] it's a vertical it's a load-bearing
[1:02:12] structure amen
[1:02:14] let me say it this way this is why i'm
[1:02:15] saying this the building that we're in
[1:02:17] today would not be standing
[1:02:19] without it right amen it's not optional
[1:02:23] it's not
[1:02:23] decorative it's it's integral to the
[1:02:26] building
[1:02:26] and so this pillar is integral to the
[1:02:29] rest of the building
[1:02:30] there would be no new testament churches
[1:02:32] we know it today
[1:02:34] without the apostle paul's epistles amen
[1:02:38] it supports the entire structure of it
[1:02:40] that's why and this is why i say many
[1:02:42] times people think
[1:02:42] they have an issue with brother branham
[1:02:44] and something he preached and said well
[1:02:45] there because the problem's not really
[1:02:46] with brother branham it's with the
[1:02:48] apostle paul
[1:02:49] amen you know brother man preached
[1:02:51] against women preachers well paul
[1:02:52] preached against it he just preached
[1:02:54] what paul preached
[1:02:55] well he's got a problem with this uh
[1:02:56] sort of creating this dogma and this
[1:02:58] sort of
[1:02:58] all this other stuff listen he's
[1:03:00] preaching what paul preached
[1:03:02] when he goes beyond the current time and
[1:03:03] that was the very thing he said
[1:03:05] am i going to be judged we're all going
[1:03:07] to be judged well even paul's going to
[1:03:09] be judged so then i'll be all right
[1:03:10] because i preach
[1:03:11] what paul preached in other words this
[1:03:13] message
[1:03:14] this ministry it's not been on some
[1:03:16] other foundation
[1:03:18] it's not laid out as something separate
[1:03:20] it's built on the very same line the
[1:03:21] very same foundation
[1:03:23] that that man the apostle paul built
[1:03:26] amen
[1:03:26] listen paul's one that laid out in order
[1:03:28] for the church and the elders the gifts
[1:03:30] and all these things
[1:03:31] it's the apostle paul we would not be
[1:03:33] here today doing what we're doing
[1:03:34] without that man's ministry
[1:03:37] amen praise the lord he says this unto
[1:03:40] timothy paul says these things i write
[1:03:41] unto thee
[1:03:42] hoping to come unto thee shortly but if
[1:03:44] thou tarry along with thou mayest know
[1:03:46] how they ought to behave thyself in the
[1:03:48] house of god
[1:03:49] which is the church of the living god
[1:03:52] the pillar
[1:03:54] and ground of the truth amen
[1:04:00] i believe this man paul he's preaching
[1:04:02] this ephesian age his doctrine his life
[1:04:04] is ministry that set a precedent
[1:04:05] for each messenger after that amen i was
[1:04:08] looking through the message and there's
[1:04:09] three times i found
[1:04:10] brother brown talks about iranian
[1:04:11] searches the second church age messenger
[1:04:13] he says erranus many people would have
[1:04:15] said well polycarp was
[1:04:17] the messenger to the second age but
[1:04:18] brother bram said no it was a rainist do
[1:04:20] you know why
[1:04:21] he said polycarp leaned right towards
[1:04:24] organization
[1:04:26] see you can't use something that leans
[1:04:27] as a power but we're interested right
[1:04:30] with the water if you have not on that
[1:04:33] leaning whichever way the tree leans it
[1:04:35] falls amen
[1:04:36] if you would build on a man that would
[1:04:37] lean a certain way that's why we've got
[1:04:40] to be so careful even in our own lives
[1:04:42] we don't want to lean to our own thought
[1:04:44] we don't want to lean to our
[1:04:45] understanding
[1:04:45] we want to stay right with the word no
[1:04:48] matter what the word says
[1:04:49] no matter what it has us to do we want
[1:04:51] to stay right with it
[1:04:52] because that's the only thing that's got
[1:04:54] the right kind of structural integrity
[1:04:57] to make it out of layer to see
[1:05:01] amen i think there's three different
[1:05:03] times he talks about that
[1:05:05] the prophet says this in the this is the
[1:05:07] philadelphian church age
[1:05:09] he says oh what a word he says
[1:05:12] we have a word for us all the time it is
[1:05:15] hold fast
[1:05:16] persevere don't give up
[1:05:20] put on the whole armor of god use every
[1:05:23] weapon he has given us
[1:05:26] i tell you what you've got a closet full
[1:05:28] of a bunch of machine guns
[1:05:29] and grenades and everything else and
[1:05:32] listen if the devil's trying to bust in
[1:05:34] your home
[1:05:34] i wouldn't sit there and get out the bb
[1:05:36] gun i put my night vision goggles on
[1:05:39] i put my plate carrier on throw some
[1:05:41] extra ammo in there
[1:05:42] grab a couple guns throw it on the side
[1:05:44] i'd let him really have it
[1:05:47] because i don't want him running off and
[1:05:48] coming back again i want to end it now
[1:05:52] listen we've got a lot of weapons and
[1:05:54] they're not carnal
[1:05:55] but they are mighty somebody help me out
[1:05:58] your weapons are not the weak
[1:06:00] antiquated outdated not capable weapons
[1:06:03] the weapons of our warfare they are
[1:06:05] mighty
[1:06:07] they're able to get the job done you've
[1:06:10] got stuff that don't flush
[1:06:12] what you've got can defeat the devil any
[1:06:16] place
[1:06:16] anywhere anytime he'd say how do you
[1:06:20] know because he did it in paul's day
[1:06:22] he didn't know this day he didn't
[1:06:24] martin's day and
[1:06:25] then columbus day and luther's day and
[1:06:27] wesley's day
[1:06:28] he did it in the prophet's ministry and
[1:06:30] listen my god he didn't die in 1965
[1:06:33] he's still here today he's been still
[1:06:35] defeating him
[1:06:39] hey man this house ain't falling down it
[1:06:41] don't matter what wins blow
[1:06:43] it don't matter what trials come it's
[1:06:45] still on a rock
[1:06:47] it's got the right material in it you've
[1:06:49] got the right material in your life
[1:06:52] to take the pressure he said i won't put
[1:06:55] anything more on you you can bear
[1:06:56] why because you're a pillar he's
[1:06:58] supposed to put some weight on him
[1:07:00] but she said i don't want god to put
[1:07:02] weight in my life i don't need this kind
[1:07:03] of pressure
[1:07:04] listen that's what keeps it from moving
[1:07:08] come on now he said if i put him as a
[1:07:10] pill in my eyes
[1:07:11] he'll go out no more you can't be moved
[1:07:15] you can testify
[1:07:16] like an apostle none of these things
[1:07:18] move me
[1:07:20] you couldn't move if you wanted to
[1:07:21] you're in the building
[1:07:25] there's things in your life those
[1:07:26] pressures those trials
[1:07:28] that we begrudge and we get so
[1:07:30] frustrated over we get so worked up
[1:07:32] those are the very things holding you in
[1:07:34] place
[1:07:40] he says use every weapon he has given
[1:07:42] use every gift
[1:07:44] at our disposal and look ahead with
[1:07:47] joy we ought to be happy you're the
[1:07:50] winners
[1:07:51] listen the devil's not the winner quit
[1:07:54] acting like he won
[1:07:55] but acting like he got one over on you
[1:07:59] you're the ones at the end of the box
[1:08:00] yeah you're the ones with dawson
[1:08:02] he's going into a lake of fire but
[1:08:04] you're part of the city
[1:08:07] you're part of the place hallelujah
[1:08:14] look ahead with joy because you we
[1:08:17] somebody say we
[1:08:19] are going to be crowned by him who is
[1:08:22] king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:08:26] now he is not only giving crowns but he
[1:08:30] says that these in the bride
[1:08:32] will be made pillars in the temple of
[1:08:35] god
[1:08:36] amen he says but what is the temp of god
[1:08:39] god
[1:08:39] jesus spoke of his body he says he spoke
[1:08:43] his body as being the temple
[1:08:44] it was it was the temple of god but now
[1:08:46] that we are his body
[1:08:48] the true church is the temple of god by
[1:08:51] the holy ghost within
[1:08:53] us listen paul talks about it says we
[1:08:56] are the temple
[1:08:57] of the living god amen now we we use
[1:08:59] this this we use this verbology or
[1:09:01] this way of saying it we say we're
[1:09:02] temples we're actually one temple
[1:09:05] you as an individual you're a temple
[1:09:07] when he's taught what paul's talking
[1:09:08] about says you're the temple
[1:09:10] singular you are the temple of god
[1:09:13] by the holy ghost being in you
[1:09:17] amen he says this now he is going
[1:09:21] to make the overcomer a pillar in that
[1:09:23] temple but what is a pillar
[1:09:25] a pillar is actually a part of the
[1:09:28] foundation
[1:09:29] for it holds up the superstructure
[1:09:31] praise god he says
[1:09:33] that puts the overcomer right in with
[1:09:35] the apostles and prophets
[1:09:37] for it says in ephesians 2 19-22 now
[1:09:40] therefore
[1:09:41] ye are no more strangers and foreigners
[1:09:44] but fellow citizens with the saints
[1:09:47] and of the household of god and are
[1:09:49] built upon the foundation
[1:09:51] of the apostles and prophets jesus
[1:09:53] christ himself being the chief
[1:09:55] cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:09:58] fitly framed listen you're not the
[1:10:02] you're not some second or you're yeah
[1:10:04] i'm going to build an addition to this
[1:10:04] like god didn't think about it he's like
[1:10:06] well
[1:10:06] i better add something on here i didn't
[1:10:07] plan for this you are fitly framed
[1:10:09] together
[1:10:10] this is exactly according to his design
[1:10:13] he's not deviated one bit from it amen
[1:10:17] he said together it grow up into a
[1:10:19] habitation
[1:10:21] it's an inhabitation of god through the
[1:10:22] spirit yes verse 22 says that we are
[1:10:25] built together with them
[1:10:26] everything went through the door jesus
[1:10:28] and is a part
[1:10:30] of that body or temple now when god
[1:10:33] puts a man in the temple as a pillar and
[1:10:36] makes him a part of the foundation
[1:10:37] group what is he doing he is giving him
[1:10:41] the revelation of the word
[1:10:43] and of himself because that is exactly
[1:10:46] what the apostles and prophets had
[1:10:47] matthew 16 17
[1:10:49] there he is in the word there he stands
[1:10:52] no i'm not talking about jesus how about
[1:10:53] you there he stands there you and i
[1:10:55] stand
[1:10:56] no one can get him out
[1:11:00] see when you find your position in
[1:11:02] christ nothing can move you out of that
[1:11:04] you're stuck in the temple you're fitted
[1:11:06] in there
[1:11:07] that's why paul can testify these
[1:11:09] afflictions didn't move him he's
[1:11:11] actually unable
[1:11:12] to go out he is a prisoner to that
[1:11:15] building
[1:11:16] you know i i don't want to just be a
[1:11:18] good church member
[1:11:19] paul was not just a good church member
[1:11:21] he wasn't just a good guy that sings
[1:11:22] songs
[1:11:23] he is a pillar he's a part of the
[1:11:26] building
[1:11:27] he's part of the structure amen iranians
[1:11:30] these men
[1:11:31] they're part of this structure integral
[1:11:33] amen they're more than just stories that
[1:11:35] we tell
[1:11:36] yeah listen sometimes we're not careful
[1:11:39] we take this bible
[1:11:40] we take this gospel we take this message
[1:11:43] and we're making a bunch of stories
[1:11:45] this is more than stories to me
[1:11:49] we get this idea like well here's
[1:11:51] abraham and here's moses and here's idea
[1:11:53] isaiah like through these these great
[1:11:55] men and they're just out there and
[1:11:56] they're just
[1:11:57] you know there's something listen these
[1:11:59] are people just like you and i
[1:12:00] yeah these are men with backgrounds
[1:12:04] and mistakes and faults and fails
[1:12:07] and trials and concerns and heartaches
[1:12:10] and sickness and affliction they
[1:12:13] wandered
[1:12:13] and sheepskins in the deserts they were
[1:12:16] tormented they were imprisoned they were
[1:12:18] beaten
[1:12:18] but the world wasn't worthy of them
[1:12:22] hallelujah there's something more about
[1:12:24] their life than their flesh
[1:12:26] these apostles of prophets god didn't
[1:12:28] build on their flesh or on their first
[1:12:30] nature
[1:12:31] but the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:12:34] their lives
[1:12:36] they had a christ-centered life they
[1:12:37] were prisoners to it
[1:12:41] amen hewn out
[1:12:45] hey man didn't have to add something to
[1:12:47] him the seed was there
[1:12:49] he just had to be quick and amen didn't
[1:12:51] have to go find something somewhere
[1:12:53] the life was in that block you just had
[1:12:55] to hew it out
[1:12:56] he went out of lust and affliction and
[1:12:59] addiction
[1:13:00] and carnality he went out cut off all
[1:13:03] that humanity
[1:13:04] cut off all that first nature until
[1:13:06] there was a pillar
[1:13:08] there was something there you could look
[1:13:10] at that life and like paul
[1:13:12] he could testify you can follow me as i
[1:13:14] follow christ
[1:13:16] there's an absolute there's a lot that's
[1:13:17] brighter than his humanity
[1:13:19] amen amen amen what are you getting at
[1:13:23] listen
[1:13:23] you've got something if you're a
[1:13:24] christian today it's greater than your
[1:13:26] humanity
[1:13:27] quit looking at your humanity that's the
[1:13:30] instrument that governs
[1:13:31] your spiritual well-being that governs
[1:13:33] who you are that's not who you are
[1:13:36] that's getting rubbed off that's getting
[1:13:38] taken out listen
[1:13:39] this past house it ain't going with you
[1:13:42] for a reason
[1:13:43] it's not fit to fit in the building
[1:13:45] flesh and blood can't inherit this
[1:13:47] kingdom
[1:13:48] but there's a life on the inside of you
[1:13:50] there's a representation by a theophany
[1:13:52] it's a word-built body that can stand
[1:13:56] the trials
[1:14:04] praise the lord there's got to be a
[1:14:06] healing in our lives
[1:14:08] amen so many times we're trying to
[1:14:10] acquire things god's given us everything
[1:14:11] we need
[1:14:12] all right hey but can we can we submit
[1:14:15] to the hands
[1:14:16] of that great artist that's working on
[1:14:18] it listen he's not just
[1:14:21] he's not just taking you and you just
[1:14:22] have a practical use and that's great
[1:14:24] but there's more to that you're actually
[1:14:26] a work of art there's something about
[1:14:29] your life
[1:14:30] that maybe you don't see you said we're
[1:14:31] talking about these other disciples
[1:14:33] i'm talking about you now for just a
[1:14:34] minute i'll show you why here
[1:14:36] because that quote i read he says that
[1:14:38] if you if you receive the same
[1:14:39] revelation
[1:14:40] you become a pillar hallelujah there was
[1:14:42] the same god that did that to them
[1:14:44] wants to do it in you if you can submit
[1:14:46] to it
[1:14:47] he wants to make a masterpiece out of
[1:14:49] the story of your life
[1:14:51] the story of your life is not a story of
[1:14:53] defeat and bitterness
[1:14:55] and carnality and wickedness and your
[1:14:58] past and your failings
[1:14:59] it's a story about god's redemptive
[1:15:01] grace to you
[1:15:02] [Music]
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:05] despite your feelings despite your past
[1:15:08] despite what you've done
[1:15:09] the grace of god the mighty hand of that
[1:15:12] artist
[1:15:12] his creator
[1:15:16] probably 20 20 in this election this
[1:15:18] idea this god's greater
[1:15:21] amen he don't need excuses michelangelo
[1:15:25] wasn't sitting there going off this
[1:15:26] don't turn out in the right way
[1:15:27] well someone so did this and somebody
[1:15:29] come and bother me one day and i didn't
[1:15:31] have the right
[1:15:31] he didn't make excuses no
[1:15:34] god don't need an excuse because his
[1:15:37] word is going to fail
[1:15:38] he knows it's going to come to pass
[1:15:42] listen you might be worried about your
[1:15:43] life i'm not worried about it
[1:15:45] right amen all right
[1:15:48] they say mike
[1:15:52] i probably did this here already once
[1:15:53] before so i'm not going to do it again
[1:15:54] but if i
[1:15:55] asked for a show of hands but how many
[1:15:58] people in our life
[1:15:59] how many of you in your life have ever
[1:16:00] worried about something presumably at
[1:16:02] least 50 percent of you
[1:16:04] if not more probably all of you we raise
[1:16:07] your hands
[1:16:08] we get worried about things we get
[1:16:10] distraught about things we get
[1:16:12] broke up about things could it be is it
[1:16:15] going to be can it happen
[1:16:16] god he worked up about it he's actually
[1:16:20] saying hold still
[1:16:21] i've got it under control it's actually
[1:16:24] in my hand
[1:16:25] listen you're not just in the working
[1:16:27] process back in the back room somewhere
[1:16:29] you're the one he's got his hand on
[1:16:31] you're the bride for today he don't have
[1:16:34] to go back and work on wesley again

[1:16:37] luther well praise the lord amen
[1:16:39] you're the one he's working on right now
[1:16:42] this is the finality amen
[1:16:45] praise the lord brother says that god he
[1:16:47] takes the very tool of humility
[1:16:49] yeah what kind of tools does god use for
[1:16:51] this do you have a big old
[1:16:54] little jackhammer just whacking pieces
[1:16:56] off gonna be a little sledgehammer going
[1:16:58] to town
[1:16:59] no only two got tools he's got he's got
[1:17:00] the very tools of weakness
[1:17:02] and humility and simplicity to work his
[1:17:06] works with amen
[1:17:08] god don't need an iron chisel to do this
[1:17:09] work amen but he's got some tools
[1:17:12] for you to submit to him amen
[1:17:15] listen paul you want to talk about
[1:17:17] circumstances
[1:17:18] you want to talk about the rock the you
[1:17:20] know all this and this is not my life
[1:17:21] listen paul was a pillar all right he
[1:17:24] could build this church on listen this
[1:17:26] man saw
[1:17:26] tarsus didn't look anything like a
[1:17:29] pillar
[1:17:30] he looked like the one was going to try
[1:17:32] and come and tear it down he was a
[1:17:34] persecutor of the church
[1:17:35] he looked like some hook nose view with
[1:17:37] his mouth sideways
[1:17:39] amen but there was a pillar in that lock
[1:17:42] listen even in the nights
[1:17:45] here's another knox i'm 19 this is a
[1:17:47] christian and he's saying there's no way
[1:17:51] you're being told tarsus i can't go down
[1:17:54] there this man's a persecutor of the
[1:17:55] church
[1:17:56] god said no there's something in that
[1:17:57] lung i will gain him
[1:18:00] to be alive unto the gentiles that's why
[1:18:03] the prophet says you don't even know who
[1:18:05] sometimes
[1:18:05] who it is praying at the altar you see
[1:18:08] somebody with a past
[1:18:09] you see somebody with addiction you see
[1:18:11] some of these problems god says i've got
[1:18:13] a masterpiece
[1:18:14] i'm working on it right now
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:19] in your own life you might wonder god's
[1:18:21] got a masterpiece
[1:18:24] you're not of lesser quality
[1:18:27] than the other one you're you're not of
[1:18:30] a different material than paul
[1:18:31] or of these other messengers amen you're
[1:18:33] the same material
[1:18:35] god's got the same care in your life
[1:18:39] you're saying well look what god didn't
[1:18:40] brother branham's life look at what god
[1:18:41] did these men
[1:18:42] why did he do it for you
[1:18:45] why did god have a messenger why would
[1:18:47] he not allow that man to
[1:18:49] take his own life why would he not allow
[1:18:51] that man to fall into the nomination
[1:18:52] for you it wasn't for the man himself
[1:18:56] only
[1:18:57] it was for your sakes
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:04] god's wisdom in each age god's wisdom no
[1:19:07] man's wisdom
[1:19:08] his wisdom in each age he shoot a pillar
[1:19:10] out after the same pattern
[1:19:12] as that first one every overcomer in
[1:19:14] that ages pattern after that revelation
[1:19:16] hallelujah so for him that overcometh
[1:19:19] you too will be a pillar amen
[1:19:23] this is where i'm going this morning i
[1:19:24] want you to get out of your thinking
[1:19:26] these better pillars and that's where
[1:19:27] god stopped
[1:19:29] amen well these better pillars that's
[1:19:31] true god ordained the same
[1:19:33] for you and i'm amen
[1:19:37] oh man i really dropped this amen
[1:19:41] what i'm saying is if you're just
[1:19:42] looking at someone else's testimony
[1:19:43] that's what we do if we're not careful
[1:19:44] as christians we
[1:19:45] look at somebody else say well there's a
[1:19:47] pillar in the church there's a pillar
[1:19:49] this person they're just they're just
[1:19:50] this rugged they're the staunch
[1:19:52] they're the strong christian listen
[1:19:54] that's your testimony
[1:19:57] amen god ordained that for your
[1:19:59] testimony
[1:20:00] you believe that and listen if if if
[1:20:03] you're always looking at somebody else's
[1:20:04] testimony and saying that
[1:20:06] you've actually missed the point the
[1:20:07] point is can the same
[1:20:09] testimony be said about you and i'm not
[1:20:11] saying this to discourage you
[1:20:12] i'm actually going to encourage you this
[1:20:14] is what overcomers look like
[1:20:17] when we think of these examples in the
[1:20:19] bible they were given for our sakes the
[1:20:21] scripture says
[1:20:22] these men and these women in the body
[1:20:24] they received their little debt to life
[1:20:25] again
[1:20:25] they watched the minds of lions be
[1:20:27] stopped they quench the violence of fire
[1:20:29] he's not just talking about them he's
[1:20:32] talking about you
[1:20:34] listen when george washed across that
[1:20:36] delaware river
[1:20:38] i was there amen
[1:20:41] praise the lord somebody unrepresented
[1:20:43] when they said that declaration of
[1:20:45] independence
[1:20:46] how i was represented in that as an
[1:20:48] american
[1:20:50] but listen that's just the spiritual the
[1:20:52] type but when christ died that day at
[1:20:54] calvary
[1:20:54] i actually died in him
[1:20:58] for the president we that he literally
[1:20:59] died we must also because that we are
[1:21:02] literally the righteousness of god in
[1:21:05] him
[1:21:06] i died with him that day at cover i laid
[1:21:08] in that grave for three days
[1:21:10] but praise be to god praise be to god
[1:21:14] when he rose up on the third day and he
[1:21:16] sat down in heavenly places
[1:21:18] you and i we sat down with him
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:22] god has ordained you not to be the tear
[1:21:25] he would need you to be the head
[1:21:27] he didn't ordain you to defeat he were
[1:21:29] danger to victory
[1:21:30] the courage and love and ability
[1:21:34] listen a great price was paid so this
[1:21:37] masterpiece
[1:21:39] not just putting a gallery somewhere but
[1:21:42] he could put it on display
[1:21:44] and the missing layer to see here that
[1:21:46] there's a people
[1:21:47] that despite circumstances despite
[1:21:50] falsehood
[1:21:50] despite every other kind of voice
[1:21:52] there's a bride that's going to believe
[1:21:54] this word anyway
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:58] he's wanting to put your life on display
[1:22:01] because he's pleased with his
[1:22:02] workmanship
[1:22:04] whether you recognize or not he's
[1:22:05] pleased with what he's done
[1:22:09] he's not looking at your life saying
[1:22:10] well man i made a mistake here i
[1:22:12] i whacked an arm off here and i i cut
[1:22:14] this piece off here and i got the wrong
[1:22:15] kind of material no he
[1:22:16] he's pleased with his own workmanship
[1:22:22] listen i get it i'm i'm i'm a human
[1:22:23] being just like everybody else
[1:22:25] you probably figured it out
[1:22:28] sometimes i think to myself well god
[1:22:30] must just be so disappointed to me
[1:22:32] he he must just be this and he must be
[1:22:33] that listen he's not ashamed to be our
[1:22:35] god
[1:22:36] he's not ashamed to call you brother
[1:22:38] there's something in your life greater
[1:22:40] than your misgivings
[1:22:41] it's greater than your uncertainty it's
[1:22:43] what he has done
[1:22:45] [Applause]
[1:22:46] it's so for it's so easy for us to look
[1:22:48] at these other people in the bible say
[1:22:50] what god did in their life was great we
[1:22:52] look in the mirror
[1:22:54] we begin to think well it's not so great
[1:22:56] it's not so wonderful and it's not so
[1:22:57] amazing
[1:22:58] listen god what god is doing in your
[1:23:00] life what god has done in your life
[1:23:02] don't ever take that for granted
[1:23:06] he's fashioning pillars that can handle
[1:23:09] the pressure
[1:23:11] they can handle the circumstances you're
[1:23:14] equipped
[1:23:15] by the holy ghost through the word of
[1:23:17] god
[1:23:18] to overcome this devil to overcome
[1:23:21] 2020 to overcome your first nature
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:27] praise god his omnipotence is yours
[1:23:34] what can i do man that submits to god
[1:23:38] the event says i'm not pretending
[1:23:41] the question today is not what what can
[1:23:43] god do what can he do
[1:23:45] well he can't fail you can't lie
[1:23:50] and the same god that can't lie and
[1:23:52] can't fail he called you to be an
[1:23:54] overcomer
[1:23:55] what does that speak about your life it
[1:23:57] speaks better things than what you say
[1:23:59] about yourself
[1:24:00] when you get discouraged then what your
[1:24:02] neighbor says about you
[1:24:03] or what mommy says or what daddy says or
[1:24:05] brothers or whoever
[1:24:11] says this
[1:24:15] you know he was he was down in i think
[1:24:16] it was in louisville or louisville
[1:24:20] you know you can go to louisville or
[1:24:22] whatever it's called you're gonna ask
[1:24:24] 10 different people how you say it they
[1:24:25] give you 10 different answers
[1:24:30] amen he was down there one day in
[1:24:32] mordecai hams and
[1:24:33] he was down this place and they had a
[1:24:35] breakfast for these preachers you
[1:24:36] probably know you all know this story
[1:24:38] but
[1:24:38] billy grabs at this breakfast he begins
[1:24:40] to rebuke the lazy preachers
[1:24:42] he says i come here last year he said i
[1:24:44] had 30 000 decisions in this meeting
[1:24:47] he said i come back this year i can't
[1:24:48] find 30. he said it's the lazy preachers
[1:24:52] he said that they you know if they
[1:24:53] weren't lazy they would not do their job
[1:24:55] that wouldn't happen but the prophet
[1:24:56] says not to disagree with that man
[1:24:58] but that's not what it was and what lazy
[1:25:00] preacher took paul's one
[1:25:02] [Music]
[1:25:04] paul might have had one convert amen
[1:25:08] he might have one person but that man
[1:25:10] was a stonemason
[1:25:12] you know how to take a stone and shape
[1:25:14] it down to fulfill a purpose
[1:25:16] he said that one paul might come back
[1:25:18] here later and he's got 30 lar
[1:25:21] what is it he was fashioned for a
[1:25:23] purpose
[1:25:25] hey amen he says we hear tonight about
[1:25:27] so much decisions
[1:25:28] what good is stones without a stonemason
[1:25:33] people wants more members in their
[1:25:34] church we'll make the decision roll up a
[1:25:36] stone
[1:25:37] that's a confession certainly but what
[1:25:38] good is a stone if there is a stone
[1:25:40] mason there with a sharp two-edged sword
[1:25:43] the word of god to shape it into a son
[1:25:45] or daughter of god
[1:25:47] to make it fit into the building
[1:25:50] hallelujah
[1:25:51] he said we need stone masons listen
[1:25:54] we've got a lot of entertainers
[1:25:56] hey man even around the message times we
[1:25:57] get worried about entertainment we've
[1:25:58] got a lot of entertainers and a lot of
[1:26:00] people that can lecture
[1:26:01] we need stone masons
[1:26:04] he says we need stone cutters by the
[1:26:06] word of god to cut confessions
[1:26:08] into real genuine pillars of the church
[1:26:11] of god
[1:26:13] amen hallelujah listen i believe this is
[1:26:16] why i'm saying this
[1:26:17] sometimes i think that if we're not
[1:26:19] careful we you've seen this even around
[1:26:20] the message sometimes people begin to
[1:26:22] change how they preach
[1:26:24] because they want to appeal to more
[1:26:26] people
[1:26:27] we need to water the gospel down we need
[1:26:29] to change what we preach we need to we
[1:26:30] need to lessen just a little bit because
[1:26:32] we want to try to get more stones listen
[1:26:35] you can have all the stones you want
[1:26:37] if you've got a big old heap of them the
[1:26:38] size of a tower and don't do no good
[1:26:41] unless they're shaped down the right way
[1:26:43] you better off that one and shape it
[1:26:46] because that'll bring forth 30 more
[1:26:47] all right amen amen praise the lord amen
[1:26:52] amen listen spiritual let me say it this
[1:26:54] way and i
[1:26:55] hope i can say it's right the right way
[1:26:56] but spiritual multiplication
[1:26:58] comes from maturity in the body amen
[1:27:02] the way we disciple and the way our
[1:27:04] disciples the character
[1:27:06] and the discipleship that they have that
[1:27:08] brings a spiritual multiplication amen
[1:27:11] even in the natural multiplication comes
[1:27:13] from a maturity amen
[1:27:15] so you look at this paul he might have
[1:27:17] got one but because that man was
[1:27:19] fashioned as a disciple
[1:27:22] that's why he'll get 30 more amen so
[1:27:25] that's why i say this we need to i
[1:27:27] believe we need to preach the message
[1:27:30] and when i say that i don't just mean
[1:27:31] the parts we like the parts that are
[1:27:33] entertaining
[1:27:33] we've got to preach this whole counsel
[1:27:35] of god paul said i'm not shunned
[1:27:37] to declare unto you the entire council
[1:27:39] of god
[1:27:41] because he knew that was the thing that
[1:27:43] would set you free
[1:27:44] the only thing that's going to set you
[1:27:46] free brothers and sisters whatever
[1:27:47] you're going through today

[1:30:03] don't buckle under the pressure amen
[1:30:07] praise the lord now it's one thing to
[1:30:09] talk about it
[1:30:12] it's another thing to go through it
[1:30:13] isn't it you know i was talking to
[1:30:15] brother the other day and he was going
[1:30:17] through a certain thing
[1:30:18] and i was trying to encourage himself
[1:30:19] you know it's always a lot easier to
[1:30:20] encourage somebody what's not you going
[1:30:21] through it
[1:30:23] funny how that works it's always a lot
[1:30:26] easier
[1:30:27] hey man we look you know i'll just use
[1:30:30] our profit i'll use brother brown's
[1:30:32] example
[1:30:32] it's interesting to me how many people
[1:30:33] like oh i wish i wish i could have
[1:30:35] done this and i wish i could have seen
[1:30:37] this vision i just that and i'm thinking
[1:30:39] you don't know what that man went
[1:30:40] through or you forgot
[1:30:43] listen we we know about what he told us
[1:30:45] on tape let alone what he didn't tell
[1:30:46] you
[1:30:48] listen there was a pillar of god come
[1:30:51] home one day from a fishing trip
[1:30:53] and he liked to go fishing he'd probably
[1:30:55] been on a hundred or a thousand fishing
[1:30:56] trips in his life
[1:30:57] but one day he'd come home with a piece
[1:30:59] of paper in his pocket
[1:31:01] hey man he come home and come to sister
[1:31:03] hope said look i stopped in this place
[1:31:05] i met these people they're not ashamed
[1:31:07] of their religion
[1:31:09] well i think we've got some of them here
[1:31:10] today too amen they're not ashamed of
[1:31:12] their religion
[1:31:13] they shout and they jump and they dance
[1:31:15] they're they're they praise god
[1:31:17] people call a bunch of holy rollers he
[1:31:19] said that's the cream of the crop
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:22] he said look i got a piece of paper i
[1:31:24] got enough invitations to fill out a
[1:31:26] year man he was doing really good
[1:31:28] got more than i got he said
[1:31:31] he didn't have an ipad or whatever
[1:31:33] either right couldn't facetime him zoom
[1:31:35] him
[1:31:36] he had a piece of paper his pocket from
[1:31:38] a guy from texas from here from there
[1:31:39] had enough invitation in his pocket for
[1:31:42] a whole year
[1:31:44] amen and they sit down and they begin to
[1:31:47] count the cross
[1:31:48] how can we go can we go we go and preach
[1:31:50] i'm going to go out and preach
[1:31:52] he said his wife and him sat down they
[1:31:54] counted up they didn't have enough money
[1:31:56] to pay the car payment that month he
[1:31:59] said but you know what she said we're
[1:32:00] going to
[1:32:01] we're just going to trust god we're
[1:32:03] going to go out and we're going to trust
[1:32:04] god
[1:32:05] now that would have been a good ending
[1:32:06] in the story but you see he went and
[1:32:08] started talking to his mother-in-law
[1:32:11] start talking to other people about it
[1:32:13] hey man now now this is just me i just
[1:32:15] want to throw this in here for a moment
[1:32:16] this is this is maybe i don't i don't
[1:32:18] think i'm presuming too much here but
[1:32:20] when you look at how he he proposed his
[1:32:22] uh sister hope and how
[1:32:24] he went talk to her father and and try
[1:32:26] to talk to the family
[1:32:27] brother branham was always concerned
[1:32:28] because he knew he couldn't give her a
[1:32:30] kind of a lifestyle
[1:32:32] she'd come from a pretty good home they
[1:32:34] were well off and he knew
[1:32:36] he couldn't give that to her with what
[1:32:38] he had
[1:32:39] my opinion or my thought is based on
[1:32:41] what happens that that probably bothered
[1:32:43] him even throughout his whole life and
[1:32:44] his whole marriage
[1:32:46] you see influencing his decision here
[1:32:48] because he goes and he speaks to his
[1:32:50] mother-in-law
[1:32:51] he says i don't want you running around
[1:32:52] with that trash you need to go get a
[1:32:54] good job
[1:32:55] and settle down and pass through that
[1:32:57] church and take care of that
[1:33:00] right and what's he do he takes your
[1:33:02] advice
[1:33:03] now i'm talking about being a pillar i'm
[1:33:06] talking about these things for a reason
[1:33:08] i want you to consider this from brother
[1:33:09] branham he talks to
[1:33:11] to her about that she says that and he
[1:33:13] makes the decision we're just going to
[1:33:14] stay we're not going to go out and
[1:33:15] travel
[1:33:16] we know that that was a mistake but the
[1:33:19] only reason you and i know that's a
[1:33:20] mistake it's because he told you
[1:33:25] i'll let that hang there for just a
[1:33:26] second the only reason you and i
[1:33:29] know that's a mistake is because he
[1:33:31] found out it was a mistake
[1:33:32] and he tells you on tape you say what
[1:33:35] are you getting at brother
[1:33:37] listen he himself and he made the
[1:33:38] decision he wasn't trying to be
[1:33:40] disobedient to god
[1:33:41] amen he didn't say well i'm gonna quit
[1:33:44] preaching the gospel
[1:33:45] well i'm gonna compromise my doctrine
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:50] it wasn't that he went and did something
[1:33:51] altogether sinful or altogether wrong
[1:33:54] but he didn't seek the mind of the lord
[1:33:56] god had something greater in
[1:33:58] mind for him than just to stay there in
[1:34:00] jeffersonville
[1:34:02] and the only reason you and i know
[1:34:04] listen his decision
[1:34:05] naturally speaking looked right
[1:34:09] right right that's what i'm coming to
[1:34:10] now by every natural
[1:34:12] metric and measurement of it we would
[1:34:14] look and say he made the right decision
[1:34:16] and the only reason you and i know that
[1:34:18] it wasn't is because he found out
[1:34:20] afterwards
[1:34:20] he found out he said that's where my
[1:34:22] trouble started he said my daddy died my
[1:34:24] brother died then his wife and his
[1:34:26] daughter died
[1:34:28] everything began to fall apart in his
[1:34:29] life and what i want you to realize
[1:34:32] why i'm saying this listen his decision
[1:34:34] was not a selfish decision
[1:34:36] in his own thinking he was trying to
[1:34:38] listen
[1:34:39] listen the devil come and do the same
[1:34:41] thing to you well the bible says if a
[1:34:42] man can't provide for his own
[1:34:44] the devil sit right there and try to
[1:34:46] convince you you're out of the will of
[1:34:47] god
[1:34:49] listen you got to take care of your
[1:34:50] family you got to do this you got to do
[1:34:52] that
[1:34:58] hey wasn't that he was gonna stop he
[1:35:00] just said i'm not gonna go this route
[1:35:02] with the ministry
[1:35:03] i'm not gonna do this but that was where
[1:35:05] he made him his mistake
[1:35:07] amen the bible says if you seek first
[1:35:10] the kingdom of god
[1:35:10] and his righteousness he'll add all
[1:35:12] these things to you amen
[1:35:14] you say why you say this listen if we're
[1:35:16] not careful
[1:35:17] we get too busy looking at the natural
[1:35:20] oh i got a job and i got a family and i
[1:35:22] got to take care of this
[1:35:23] and i got to do that listen you can't
[1:35:25] take care of yourself anyway you might
[1:35:28] think you had listen
[1:35:29] i got a i got a job at a factory here
[1:35:31] about 10 years ago i was working at the
[1:35:32] time
[1:35:33] and i was at my interview and they were
[1:35:35] interviewing me and of course i i aced
[1:35:36] the interview because
[1:35:38] why not right i remember it
[1:35:42] and i got done and she's doing my
[1:35:43] english as well we just want to know at
[1:35:44] this factory
[1:35:45] he said since this factory has started
[1:35:47] we've never had one layoff
[1:35:49] in the entire history of this factory i
[1:35:52] said that sounds like a pretty good job
[1:35:54] guess what happened a year later all
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:57] we got laid off and i come back i got
[1:35:59] laid off again
[1:36:03] he said what are you getting at listen
[1:36:05] we can try to make all the right
[1:36:06] decisions
[1:36:07] we can try to do all that we can take
[1:36:09] care of ourselves we can take care of
[1:36:11] our family
[1:36:11] we can lay out our 401ks we can make all
[1:36:14] the right kinds of decisions
[1:36:15] but if we don't seek the will of the
[1:36:17] lord we'll miss something
[1:36:19] listen that man he made the decision he
[1:36:21] made because he loved his wife
[1:36:23] he loved his daughter and yet his
[1:36:25] failure love for them
[1:36:26] was the very thing that cost them their
[1:36:28] lives
[1:36:30] what are you getting at bro listen
[1:36:31] you're feeling love can't save your
[1:36:34] family
[1:36:35] you're feeling a love can't make a
[1:36:37] rapture
[1:36:40] we rely too much on this humanity
[1:36:43] we see things going on we get upset we
[1:36:46] say well i've got to do this
[1:36:47] and i've got to do that listen you've
[1:36:49] got to let god do something cause what
[1:36:52] god wants to do in your life might be
[1:36:53] the last thing that you're thinking of
[1:36:55] sometimes
[1:36:57] god wants more than just good decision
[1:36:59] making out of us
[1:37:00] he wants surrender he wants submission
[1:37:04] he wants preeminence in our lives
[1:37:07] he's not satisfied just to say well that
[1:37:09] was a good idea so and so
[1:37:11] that was a good idea son he's got the
[1:37:13] first original thought
[1:37:15] amen and where we get in trouble just
[1:37:18] like that
[1:37:19] we think we're doing the right thing it
[1:37:21] looks like the right thing
[1:37:22] and it's absolutely contrary to the will
[1:37:25] of god
[1:37:26] amen so i can't show you a scripture
[1:37:30] where he
[1:37:30] well he you know the bible says those
[1:37:32] shall not steal he stole
[1:37:34] hey man but god wanted that man so
[1:37:36] surrendered
[1:37:37] oh yeah he want him so submitted to the
[1:37:41] ministry
[1:37:41] because he had a purpose there was an
[1:37:44] angel come told him listen you're going
[1:37:45] to pray for kings
[1:37:46] and potentially you can't do that where
[1:37:48] you're at now
[1:37:50] god's got to get his attention for you
[1:37:52] and i
[1:37:54] sometimes god's got to get our attention
[1:37:56] and we want to want to go through trials
[1:37:58] we wonder why we suffer
[1:38:00] we wonder why we go through rejection
[1:38:02] why we suffer loss
[1:38:04] sometimes god's trying to build
[1:38:05] something up in your life
[1:38:07] greater than your failure love greater
[1:38:09] than your humanity amen amen
[1:38:12] praise the lord sometimes these things
[1:38:14] gotta rub off
[1:38:15] just a little bit that's not quite right
[1:38:17] that don't quite look like what i want
[1:38:19] to look like
[1:38:20] i've got to have preeminence in that
[1:38:23] life
[1:38:28] think about that brother branham's
[1:38:30] failure of love
[1:38:32] caused him to lose the very thing he was
[1:38:33] trying to protect
[1:38:38] hey man fellow love has no power to save
[1:38:41] the lost
[1:38:42] feel love has no power to deliver it's
[1:38:45] human
[1:38:46] instrumentality but god is fashioning
[1:38:49] a building without human hands
[1:38:53] god will take things you say well listen
[1:38:55] i i've made mistakes
[1:38:56] we all do that i made this mistake as if
[1:38:59] god didn't somehow
[1:39:01] know when you that you were going to
[1:39:02] make a mistake that you made
[1:39:04] we find out about we're surprised he's
[1:39:06] like well i know you're going to do
[1:39:07] that's why i suffered and died for you
[1:39:09] he not blindsided by nothing amen listen
[1:39:12] because well i didn't raise my kids the
[1:39:14] right way or i made this mistake
[1:39:16] i spoke wrong with this person i've i've
[1:39:18] went the wrong way listen god can take
[1:39:20] an iron chisel
[1:39:22] and wield it like a brush it's never too
[1:39:25] late for god
[1:39:26] to do something in your life and say
[1:39:27] well i went down the wrong path
[1:39:29] i've gotten away from god i've made so
[1:39:31] many mistakes you're never too far away
[1:39:34] from god to take that hand and take his
[1:39:37] tools
[1:39:39] listen somebody's sitting here today
[1:39:40] wrestle that very thing i did this and
[1:39:42] i've got that
[1:39:43] i i missed it years ago maybe
[1:39:46] that doesn't stop god god knew about it
[1:39:50] he's been working the whole time
[1:39:53] it's not too late he's not done yet
[1:39:56] he's still working
[1:39:58] [Applause]
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:07] oh bill you've preached about it
[1:40:10] you've talked about it why would you
[1:40:12] call me back
[1:40:13] you don't even know what you have no
[1:40:15] idea brothers and sisters we've got no
[1:40:17] idea
[1:40:19] what god's got in store for us and then
[1:40:22] he can do greater things today
[1:40:24] in your life than he's ever done before
[1:40:27] what's waiting for you is greater than
[1:40:30] anything you can lay up on this side
[1:40:33] there's no house nice enough you can buy
[1:40:35] there's no car fast enough there's no
[1:40:37] crossbow nice enough for some recliner
[1:40:39] whatever it is
[1:40:40] there's nothing that can compare nothing
[1:40:43] can't compare
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:48] nothing can compare to what he's laid up
[1:40:50] for you or not nothing can compare
[1:40:52] do what he can do in your life i've said
[1:40:54] it before and i'll say it again
[1:40:56] you might have spent your whole lifetime
[1:40:58] maybe you've resisted
[1:40:59] the will of god maybe you've been his
[1:41:00] permissive will but god can do more
[1:41:03] in five minutes than you can do in a
[1:41:05] lifetime
[1:41:07] don't put the chains on god this morning
[1:41:09] let's let god be
[1:41:10] god let's let him be free here today god
[1:41:13] you can do it
[1:41:16] these men in the bible listen what we
[1:41:18] need today is
[1:41:19] not just another gimmick not just more
[1:41:21] information
[1:41:22] we have transforming power
[1:41:26] it's able to even change the species
[1:41:28] it's able to make you look like a
[1:41:29] different creature
[1:41:31] that tadpole don't look like a tadpole
[1:41:33] when he comes out of that new atmosphere
[1:41:35] he looks like a whole new creature god
[1:41:37] that'll take even where you're at today
[1:41:40] even where you're at today god is able
[1:41:42] to change the situation
[1:41:48] listen these men in this bible they
[1:41:50] hazard their lives the scripture says
[1:41:52] they hazard their lives for this kingdom
[1:41:54] they put their lives on the line
[1:41:56] brother bram talks about the the
[1:41:58] morovian revival
[1:42:00] and what happened there these two young
[1:42:01] men these two men they sold themselves
[1:42:03] oh my
[1:42:05] we think we've got it rough these two
[1:42:07] young men
[1:42:08] sold themselves into a lifetime of
[1:42:11] slavery
[1:42:12] to go preach to a group of lost people
[1:42:14] on an island somewhere
[1:42:16] they would lay down their lives for this
[1:42:19] gospel they put everything on the line
[1:42:22] listen it wasn't because they didn't
[1:42:23] like domestic life
[1:42:25] it wasn't because they didn't enjoy
[1:42:26] comfort but they reasoned
[1:42:28] they saw something like moses something
[1:42:30] was greater the reproach of christ
[1:42:32] is greater than anything the world can
[1:42:36] give you
[1:42:38] they preached it because they knew the
[1:42:40] power of this world to change lives
[1:42:43] to transform to set free to deliver they
[1:42:46] were so
[1:42:47] possessed by that spirit they were so
[1:42:50] convinced
[1:42:51] to the lay of our lives on the line
[1:42:57] they understood this is the only place
[1:42:58] that life is like peter
[1:43:01] they understood there's nowhere else to
[1:43:03] go to
[1:43:05] listen i don't have some sort of a plan
[1:43:06] b or some sort of
[1:43:08] exit strategy i put all my confidence in
[1:43:10] the lord
[1:43:11] i threw my anchor behind the veil a long
[1:43:14] time ago
[1:43:15] because if he can't put it over nobody
[1:43:17] can
[1:43:20] i'm convinced you're young people this
[1:43:22] morning you're convinced older people
[1:43:24] you're convinced
[1:43:25] we're convinced in the power of this
[1:43:28] word
[1:43:29] to transform lives transform situations
[1:43:32] to take the weak
[1:43:33] and the impotent and the unincapable and
[1:43:36] turn them into pillars
[1:43:38] real titans of the face
[1:43:45] i could ask you all the question today
[1:43:46] of course we all know what the right
[1:43:48] answer is
[1:43:48] would we be willing to lay our our lives
[1:43:50] down for this message
[1:43:52] we lay our lives on for this gospel and
[1:43:54] we'd all raise our hands
[1:43:55] i hope so anyway if you're willing to
[1:43:59] die for it or you want to live for it
[1:44:03] amen don't just live for it let it live
[1:44:05] in you
[1:44:06] i mean let it do something in your life

[1:44:30] fair let it speak of
[1:44:32] god's ability

[1:45:51] good ground to put his seed in but
[1:45:53] it was a predestinated heart
[1:45:57] then he went along the way and he might
[1:45:58] have tucked a lot of stones to the side
[1:46:01] but he found some stones that he could
[1:46:03] make abraham see

[1:47:29] the best material listen if god could
[1:47:31] have built it out of something greater

[1:55:13] he's more concerned about you
[1:55:18] what about this policy what about this
[1:55:20] stuff he's more concerned about you
[1:55:22] as an individual he said i've set you
[1:55:24] over kingdoms
[1:55:25] and nature that's more important to me
[1:55:27] all those things they're gonna get wiped

[1:56:01] you ordained something greater for us
[1:56:06] you just bought your heads for a moment
[1:56:12] i wonder today in my own life
[1:56:18] how many times
[1:56:22] i made casual decisions
[1:56:28] i made casual decisions about directions
[1:56:32] in
[1:56:32] life maybe it wasn't that it was ill
[1:56:35] thought out maybe i thought about it too
[1:56:36] much
[1:56:38] maybe i put too much of me into it
[1:56:41] there's been times in my life i've been
[1:56:44] tempted to make decisions
[1:56:48] because it was beneficial maybe for my
[1:56:50] child there's times i wanted to maybe
[1:56:52] do something for them in the natural but
[1:56:55] i realize
[1:56:57] i hope you realize today
[1:57:03] no matter what you've done maybe you
[1:57:05] made a mistake even

[1:57:21] you just can't find an answer listen
[1:57:22] i've been there i understand
[1:57:25] i i'm i'm no better than my father's i'm
[1:57:28] i'm no different than anyone else
[1:57:31] i know what it's like to feel like a
[1:57:32] forsaken orphan's child
[1:57:35] cry out to god hallelujah
[1:57:40] it seems like there's just no answer
[1:57:41] sometimes
[1:57:45] things seem to go on and you wonder why
[1:57:48] i think of david he said many are there
[1:57:51] that say
[1:57:52] there's no help from me and god many are
[1:57:55] there that trouble me
[1:57:58] he said but thou o lord you're a shield
[1:58:00] for me

[1:58:05] head

[1:58:19] maybe you don't feel like you thought
[1:58:21] you would maybe maybe it doesn't seem
[1:58:23] like

[1:58:49] them for me and gain sayers
[1:58:51] i'm going to believe what you've spoken
[1:58:53] about me
