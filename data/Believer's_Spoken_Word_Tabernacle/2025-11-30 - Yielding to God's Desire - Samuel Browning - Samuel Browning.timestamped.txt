[42:30] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[42:33] the dividing aunderder of soul and
[42:35] spirit, and of the joints and marorrow,
[42:38] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[42:40] intents of the heart. Neither is there
[42:44] any creature that is not manifest in his
[42:47] sight, but all things are naked and open
[42:50] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[42:54] to do.
[42:55] Seeing then that we have a great high
[42:58] priest that is passed into the heavens,
[43:01] Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast
[43:04] our profession. For we have not an high
[43:08] priest which cannot be touched with the
[43:10] feeling of our infirmities, but was in
[43:12] all points tempted like as we are, yet
[43:15] without sin. Let us therefore come
[43:19] boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
[43:22] may obtain mercy and find grace to help
[43:26] in time of need. Amen. May God bless you
[43:29] and bless the reading of the word as
[43:30] you're being seated. I want to just
[43:33] speak here just um take a few moments
[43:36] and to speak on this of yielding to
[43:39] God's desire. We've been looking at that
[43:41] on the fellowship within the mystery.
[43:44] God brings us completely uh into a
[43:47] complete uh offering and separation. And
[43:50] when we look at coming into this place
[43:53] of rest, we know that what we have read
[43:55] here in Hebrews, there is an objective
[43:59] that God has had for his people. And
[44:02] actually what all have longed for since
[44:05] that time that Adam and Eve when they
[44:08] when they were they made the choice and
[44:11] they separated uh from the word of God
[44:14] and and then as they uh went out but yet
[44:17] God made a promise that he would make a
[44:20] way back.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And so it has been the longing that has
[44:24] been within the heart of the believer.
[44:26] The prophets all have looked with great
[44:29] anticipation even for the fulfillment of
[44:32] the word that would carry us clear into
[44:35] the millennium and the future home. And
[44:37] yet there are many many little
[44:39] increments that are fulfilled along the
[44:41] way in order to make that possible. The
[44:43] main the main event of all of that is is
[44:47] God himself becoming one of us in order
[44:49] to pay the ransom and then that his life
[44:53] might be shared with you and I. And so
[44:56] when we see this of the rest and that's
[44:58] God's objective. That's the whole
[45:00] objective of the word. The word is not
[45:04] is not sent uh to trouble you. The word
[45:07] is not sent to condemn you. The word is
[45:11] sent to in order to bring conviction.
[45:13] And the conviction is is where the
[45:15] spirit of God moving upon your life to
[45:17] re to help you and I to see who we are
[45:21] and the privileges that we have and that
[45:23] we're actually living beneath. And God's
[45:25] grace is sufficient in that moment when
[45:28] he makes those things known. It isn't
[45:30] about God asking you and I to actually
[45:34] do something, but it's actually you and
[45:36] I just yielding to God's presence that
[45:41] is right there as he's fulfilling his
[45:43] word. And as we'll yield to him, God
[45:46] will take us to where we need to be.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; So when we think of this, brother
[45:51] Brandham asked this question. And I want
[45:53] to just background a little before I
[45:54] display this quote. And he's asking the
[45:57] question, he says, "How do I get into
[45:59] that body to the body of Jesus Christ
[46:02] into the rest which is the Holy Spirit?"
[46:04] And we have been looking at how that God
[46:06] will take us through justification,
[46:09] sanctification, and then into the
[46:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it's all
[46:13] all of that is a work of the self-same
[46:16] spirit. As a matter of fact, brother
[46:18] Brandham would say that of the Holy
[46:20] Spirit, he says it is not. He said it's
[46:22] it's more of the same spirit that fills
[46:25] you and seals you away. So it's the Holy
[46:28] Spirit working all along. I mean you and
[46:30] I could not even repent unless the
[46:33] spirit of God brought conviction on our
[46:35] life because the Bible says it's the
[46:37] goodness of God that leads us to
[46:39] repentance. So when we see it's God
[46:42] working all along to bring things about
[46:44] in our life. So it's it's it's all of
[46:47] this is him. And that's why you don't
[46:49] ever want to lose sight of him because
[46:51] when you when when when when he begins
[46:53] to deal with your life and then you
[46:55] start, you know, becoming focused upon,
[46:58] well, I don't see this or I I I don't
[47:00] know if I'm here, you're losing sight of
[47:03] him. You have to keep your eyes on him
[47:06] who begun the work in your life.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And if you just focus on him, that's
[47:11] Satan wants to distract you and get your
[47:13] attention on yourself.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because if he can get you
[47:16] to look at yourself, he's already got
[47:19] you whipped.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Because remember, the prophet said,
[47:21] "Don't ever doubt your weapon." And the
[47:23] weapon you've been given is the word.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; And God makes his word real to your
[47:28] heart that you might stand with that
[47:30] word and say, "The promise of God
[47:33] belongs to me." And that's for every
[47:34] promise in your life. Even when symptoms
[47:37] come up, if you're praying for healing
[47:38] and God's dropped the word in your life,
[47:40] don't ever look at anything else but
[47:42] that promise. It doesn't matter what
[47:44] comes up. It doesn't matter what
[47:46] surfaces. God's word cannot fail.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, brother Ram is
[47:54] talking how do we get into this? And he
[47:56] refers to Romans 8:1. And and let me
[48:00] just backgroundly. And the scripture
[48:01] says, "There is therefore now no
[48:03] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[48:06] that walk not after the things of this
[48:09] world, the flesh, but after the things
[48:11] of the spirit." And he says that paying
[48:14] no attention to what the world has got
[48:16] to say. If you're sick and the doctor
[48:19] says you're going to die, you pay no
[48:21] attention to it. It don't bother you a
[48:23] bit. If they tell you you have to become
[48:26] a Catholic before you're saved or
[48:28] Presbyterian or have to do this, you pay
[48:30] no attention to it. And he says,
[48:32] "Therefore, no condemnation to them that
[48:35] are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after
[48:38] the flesh, the things that they see,
[48:42] because everything that you see with
[48:44] your eyes is earthly."
[48:47] &gt;&gt; But it's the things you see in your
[48:50] spirit through the word. The word is
[48:54] God's looking glass that reflects what
[48:57] he is and what you are. And brother
[49:00] Brandham just has a time there.
[49:02] [laughter]
[49:03] This is the only book in the world that
[49:05] tells you where you come from, who you
[49:08] are, where you're going. Show me any
[49:11] page of literature anywhere with all the
[49:13] science, anything else, every good book
[49:15] that's written, none of it can tell you
[49:18] that this is God's looking glass that
[49:22] shows what he is and what you are. And
[49:26] then in between there is the bloodline
[49:29] that shows what you can be if you want
[49:33] to make that choice.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SHOWS HE reveals himself. SEE HE
[49:40] MUST REVEAL HIMSELF. THEN THAT through
[49:42] the revealing of himself it actually is
[49:46] unfolding the mystery OF WHO WE ARE. AND
[49:50] SO THEN in between there because
[49:53] remember it takes God's grace revealing
[49:56] the word and it takes his grace to bring
[49:58] us to what he is showing that we can be.
[50:02] NOW WHAT HE'S SHOWING THAT we can be is
[50:04] that of through his word being revealed
[50:08] to our lives. And so when when he's when
[50:11] he's coming in this way, it's grace that
[50:13] takes us all the way. like Paul would
[50:16] say that he hath called you according to
[50:20] our gospel uh through sanctification to
[50:24] the obtaining of the glory of Jesus
[50:27] Christ. So God has made a call through
[50:31] his word WITH AN OBJECTIVE to obtain the
[50:35] glory. And let me just tell you the
[50:37] glory I IS NOT JUST THE FILLING OF THE
[50:39] HOLY SPIRIT. That's the beginning of it.
[50:42] But then when THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COME,
[50:44] IT LEADS US FROM GLORY UNTO GLORY UNTO
[50:48] GLORY TILL EVENTUALLY THIS BODY IS
[50:51] changed and we stand.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW FAITH IS SO IMPORTANT IN OUR
[50:59] LIVES and faith the Bible tells us
[51:02] without faith it's impossible to please
[51:04] God. And this is why when brother
[51:06] Brandham would would speak of this of
[51:08] faith and what we see in front of us,
[51:10] you don't ever go by your feelings. Now,
[51:13] I know throughout this congregation, we
[51:16] all still have our feelings. And I would
[51:18] like to be able to announce to you that
[51:20] by the time you get to a certain time in
[51:23] your walk with God that your feelings
[51:24] will no longer bother you. But that's
[51:26] not true. Your feelings are still there.
[51:29] As a matter of fact, brother Brandham
[51:30] took it like this in uh works of faith
[51:32] express one of the last messages that
[51:34] he's preaching and he says this. There's
[51:36] many other places perfect faith 1963 but
[51:39] he says it like this. He says look he
[51:41] says I'm not above temptation. YOU THINK
[51:43] THAT I DON'T get feeling gloomy at times
[51:46] and he tells us this is the remedy for
[51:48] him in works of faith express. He said,
[51:50] "When I get to feeling what they call a
[51:52] a case of THE BLUES, I GO to Romans
[51:56] chapter 4 and I read about Abraham." And
[51:59] he said, "As soon as I begin to read
[52:01] that about Abraham," he said, he's
[52:03] staggered not at the promise of God
[52:04] through unbelief. He said, "I BEGIN TO
[52:06] FIND those things begin to move away
[52:09] from my life." You see the word IS OUR
[52:12] SOURCE OF STRENGTH NOT ONLY WITHIN OUR
[52:15] LIVES BUT REMEMBER it's the word as the
[52:18] Holy Spirit as we read the word we take
[52:20] in the word IT'S WHAT GIVES STRENGTH TO
[52:22] YOU AND I listen friends the greatest
[52:25] things and times is when even you don't
[52:28] feel like listening to a message you
[52:30] don't feel LIKE PRAYING YOU DON'T EVEN
[52:33] FEEL SPIRITUAL AND READY AND ready to
[52:36] enter into that as a matter of fact you
[52:38] you're LIKE STRUGGLING LIKE WITH YOU
[52:40] DON'T WANT TO, you don't, you don't, YOU
[52:41] JUST DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE PUTTING FORTH
[52:42] THE EFFORT, BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS,
[52:44] and I know I'm just echoing words that
[52:47] YOU'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED, BUT WITHIN
[52:49] THAT MOMENT, WATCH HOW GOD comes on the
[52:51] scene, BECAUSE JUST THAT MOMENT OF
[52:54] YIELDING AND PUTTING ON that message,
[52:56] just that moment OF GETTING IN PRAYER
[52:58] WITH GOD, and you find a sweet release
[53:02] THAT COMES INTO YOUR LIFE, AND GOD KNOWS
[53:04] JUST WHAT YOU HAVE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT
[53:06] HE'S DOING? THAT'S ALSO TRAINING YOU AND
[53:08] I BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE TIMES IN
[53:11] THE JOURNEY WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[53:13] FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN OR FEEL HIS
[53:16] PRESENCE. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
[53:18] FEEL IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S STILL NOT
[53:21] GOD OF HIS WORD.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD MOLDING US AND maturing us as
[53:26] sons and DAUGHTERS OF GOD. NOT THAT
[53:28] WE'RE WALKING AROUND PRESUMING, BUT WE
[53:31] KNOW AS HE SAID, "LO, I AM WITH THEE
[53:33] ALWAYS."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY when the prophet would
[53:37] say it like this, don't ever go by your
[53:40] feelings. He said, even after you're
[53:42] prayed for, oh, brother Brandham, I I
[53:44] I'm more sick now than I was. He says,
[53:46] that's the greatest sign that you've
[53:48] already BEEN HEALED.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT YOU COME OUT of a service and
[53:52] THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS MOVED upon your
[53:54] heart IN SUCH A WAY YOU MIGHT BATTLE
[53:57] TEMPTATIONS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BATTLED
[53:59] THEM BEFORE. BUT THAT'S THE GREATEST
[54:02] SIGN that you have been set free
[54:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SATAN IS TRYING TO CLAIM TRYING
[54:09] TO RECLAIM WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT LIBERTY
[54:13] EVEN INTO YOUR HEART TO ACCEPT WHAT HE'S
[54:16] ALREADY done through his word for your
[54:18] life.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; And this is why brother Bram says it has
[54:22] nothing to do with it your feelings.
[54:24] It's my faith that does it. He said,
[54:26] "Right before us, we see the image of a
[54:30] perfect healed person by faith. Then we
[54:34] just make step by step till we step
[54:36] right into that person and just walk
[54:39] right on." So God makes him makes
[54:42] reveals before you what you can be. He
[54:45] reveals before you of a perfectly healed
[54:48] person. And you see what is actually
[54:50] creating THAT THAT'S NOT A MIRAGE. THAT
[54:53] IS THE word that he came to Abraham when
[54:56] the Bible says the word of the Lord CAME
[54:58] UNTO ABRAHAM BY VISION. THIS WORD IS
[55:02] ACTUALLY opening up. And remember, we're
[55:04] living in THE HOUR OF JOHN 5:19. THE SON
[55:08] CAN DO NOTHING, BUT WHAT HE SEETH THE
[55:10] FATHER DOING, THAT DOETH THE SON
[55:12] LIKEWISE. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE DAYS
[55:14] OF HEARING, BUT I HAVE HEARD, BUT NOW I
[55:18] SEE. WE'RE LIVING IN THE HOUR OF THE
[55:21] OPEN BOOK. WE'RE LIVING IN THE HOUR OF
[55:23] AN OPEN VISION. WE'RE LIVING IN THAT
[55:25] HOUR WHERE GOD OPENING IN our hearts and
[55:28] walking straight into that.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; You know what you see in front of you
[55:32] can affect you greatly.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And Satan also likes to pre present if I
[55:37] can say visions.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. That's why every that's why
[55:42] every vision has to be checked by the
[55:43] word.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Right. This is why when even they tried
[55:46] to persuade the prophet, if that angel
[55:48] of the Lord gave you a vision and told
[55:50] you this and told you that, brother Bram
[55:51] said, if he told me this AND TOLD ME
[55:53] THAT and it's not according to the word,
[55:55] IT WOULDN'T BE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR [screaming]
[56:01] ABSOLUTE.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HOLDS OUR IDENTITY.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; And then the enemy, look what he did
[56:11] when they came into come into the land.
[56:14] They the 10 spies came back and they
[56:16] came back with a report with a vision
[56:19] and it WAS THAT HAD SUCH AN ANOINTING
[56:21] UPON IT THAT IN THE TENTS THE BIBLE SAYS
[56:24] THEY WEPT BECAUSE THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO
[56:26] IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THE GIANTS ARE TOO
[56:29] BIG. I I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO LIVE THAT
[56:31] KIND OF A LIFE. WE'LL never be ABLE TO
[56:32] LIVE OVERCOMING. LOOK WHAT IT'S GOING TO
[56:34] DO TO MY CHILDREN. MY CHILDREN are not
[56:35] going TO LOVE ME. THEY'RE GOING TO HATE
[56:37] ME. MY MY CHILDREN CAN'T LIVE THIS. BUT
[56:39] YOU SEE, CALEB AND JOSHUA WERE NOT
[56:41] LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THEY
[56:44] WERE IN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE GOD WHO HAD
[56:47] ALREADY DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE. AND THEY
[56:50] WERE LOOKING TO GOD THAT HE IS STILL THE
[56:53] SAME GOD THAT PERFORMS THE impossible
[56:56] things.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; HEY, LISTEN. GOD DON'T NEED A GREAT BIG
[56:59] PERSON TO WHIP THE DEVIL. GOD DON'T EVEN
[57:01] NEED GREAT BIG FAITH. HE JUST NEEDS
[57:04] SIMPLE FAITH TO TRUST HIM. [cheering]
[57:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME? GOD DON'T NEED
[57:10] MIRACLE FAITH TO WHIP THE DEVIL.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; GOD JUST NEEDS SIMPLE FAITH TO TAKE HIM
[57:16] AT HIS WORD AND STAND RIGHT THERE LIKE
[57:19] ABRAHAM DID FOR 25 YEARS.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, LOOK AT
[57:24] ABRAHAM'S MISUNDERSTANDINGS. LOOK AT HIS
[57:27] STUMBLINGS." THAT'S TRUE. BUT FIND IT IN
[57:29] THE NEW TESTAMENT. FIND IT WRITTEN IN
[57:33] THE NEW DIVINE COMMENTARY OF HIS LIFE.
[57:36] YOU KNOW WHY? THE THINGS YOU READ ABOUT,
[57:39] MISUNDERSTANDINGS, ALL OF THESE THINGS
[57:41] HERE AND THERE, THAT WAS THAT FLESH PART
[57:43] OF ABRAHAM. BUT WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE
[57:46] NEW TESTAMENT IS WHAT COULD PASS THROUGH
[57:49] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THAT WAS
[57:52] THAT REAL TRUE SEA OF WHO ABRAHAM, THE
[57:55] IDENTITY THAT GOD SAW ALL ALONG AND IT
[57:58] WAS THERE IN THE BOOK.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So walk step by step until
[58:04] we come into that image. Ephesians 2:8,
[58:08] "For by grace are you saved through
[58:10] faith, and that not of yourselves. It's
[58:14] the gift of God."
[58:17] Now, I know everyone has faith,
[58:20] but in order to believe and to be saved,
[58:23] it takes God coming
[58:26] &gt;&gt; and anointing your faith
[58:28] &gt;&gt; to direct it in him.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Who's the finished work?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, because remember in the
[58:35] days of Noah, they there was the
[58:37] ministry that was contrary to that of
[58:40] Noah that said there's no such thing as
[58:42] rain.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; What they were preaching is what they
[58:45] had always known.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; But God was revealing the very judgment
[58:49] you're scoffing at, it's right under
[58:51] your feet.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; It's right above you. They were unaware
[58:54] OF IT. BUT GOD HAD A MAN WHO BECAME
[58:56] AWARE OF THE OTHER REALMS. AND WHEN NOAH
[58:59] BEGAN TO SPEAK and they were they were
[59:01] saying, "Oh, there's no such rain." What
[59:03] was that? That was unbelief. You know
[59:05] the prophet said, "UNBELIEF IS FAITH,
[59:07] BUT IT'S FAITH in the wrong direction."
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[59:12] &gt;&gt; SO IT IT TAKES GOD. NOW, WHAT WOULD
[59:14] CAUSE SOMEBODY TO DISBELIEVE? IT WOULD
[59:17] be the enemy,
[59:19] &gt;&gt; right? It would be the spirit. IT'S NOT
[59:20] A PERSON, IT'S A SPIRIT. SO HERE WE ARE.
[59:23] EVERY PERSON COMES IN TO THIS WORLD. YOU
[59:26] HAVE A DEPOSIT OR A PART OR THAT ABILITY
[59:30] OF FAITH. BUT IT COMES NOW THROUGH WHAT
[59:32] INFLUENCE we come under AND RESPONDING
[59:35] TO THAT INFLUENCE. I I'M SO GLAD THERE'S
[59:38] SOMETHING IN ME THAT IS NOT WHAT I PUT
[59:40] THERE OR WHAT YOU PUT THERE, BUT IT'S
[59:43] SOMETHING THAT WILL RESPOND AND
[59:45] RECOGNIZE EVEN WHEN WE WERE UNAWARE OF
[59:48] WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE. YOU MIGHT BE
[59:50] WONDERING, HOW DID I GET EVEN HERE THIS
[59:52] MORNING? BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[59:54] GOD IS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAD GPS, GOD'S
[59:58] POSITIONING SYSTEM. AND GOD KNOWS HOW TO
[1:00:01] FIND HIS CHILDREN AND BRING THEM RIGHT
[1:00:03] INTO position
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; and bring understanding to our lives.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; For we are his. This is the scripture in
[1:00:13] verse 9. NOT OF WORKS LEST ANY MAN
[1:00:15] should boast.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; It's not about just let me drop this
[1:00:19] here.
[1:00:21] It's not about how long a person was at
[1:00:25] the altar. Right.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; I think we understand. You're mature
[1:00:29] enough to understand this. I know we're
[1:00:31] not talking about
[1:00:33] against the altar. What we're talking
[1:00:35] about is the prophet said, he said, "You
[1:00:38] could lay on this altar for days.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; They would have to bring your food to
[1:00:44] you."
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "BUT IT WILL NEVER do you any
[1:00:47] good unless YOU ACCEPT WHAT HE'S DONE."
[1:00:50] YES.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, SOMETIMES WE'RE FIGHTING AT THE
[1:00:54] PROMISE THAT GOD SAID, "I'VE ALREADY
[1:00:56] MADE IT AVAILABLE.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; STOP [screaming] FIGHTING IT."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS JACOB FIGHTING WITH? WELL, YOU
[1:01:02] SAY THE ANGEL of the Lord. He was
[1:01:04] fighting against his own will.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Are are you hearing me now?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, IT TAKES WHAT THE GRACE OF GOD
[1:01:13] DOES. It takes this out of our hands and
[1:01:16] it's placing it into God's hands. This
[1:01:19] is why the next scripture says we are
[1:01:21] his workmanship. That's why DAVID COULD
[1:01:24] SAY, "KNOW you that we are his sheep."
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; The sheep OF HIS PASTURE. WE HAVE NOT
[1:01:31] MADE OURSELVES, BUT HE HAS MADE US.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HIS WORKMANSHIP, created in Christ
[1:01:38] Jesus unto good works, which God hath
[1:01:42] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:01:44] them. God already saw you
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; walking in the promised land of this
[1:01:50] world.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T CARE HOW MUCH I DON'T CARE HOW
[1:01:54] MUCH TIME. I don't care what has passed.
[1:01:57] Do you remember the quote I read to you
[1:01:58] last week and I sent that to a number of
[1:02:00] other ministering brothers and so forth.
[1:02:02] I read to you last week and I I wanted
[1:02:04] to just take that and just deal with
[1:02:06] that here. But let me just uh emphasize
[1:02:09] that where where where the prophet says
[1:02:11] some of you are sitting here disagreeing
[1:02:13] even right now. He says but I can see a
[1:02:15] little bit I can see further than what
[1:02:17] you can see and one of these days you're
[1:02:20] going to be believing this and it's not
[1:02:22] going to be too very far along.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And he said the HOLY SPIRIT HAS TOLD ME
[1:02:27] TO PUT A LITTLE SPOT OF grace here for
[1:02:30] you.
[1:02:31] AND THEN HE REFERS US TO ABRAHAM AND
[1:02:34] SARAH BECAUSE SARAH laughed within
[1:02:37] herself at the promise.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE GOD, HER IDENTITY WAS WITHIN
[1:02:42] ABRAHAM. YOUR IDENTITY, MY IDENTITY AS
[1:02:45] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, IT WAS ALWAYS IN
[1:02:47] CHRIST. AND SO IT IS GOD THAT IS
[1:02:50] SUPPLYING YOU AND I. IF IT HAD BEEN LEFT
[1:02:52] UP TO you and I, THE BIBLE SAID WE ALL
[1:02:54] LIKE SHEEP HAVE GONE ASTRAY. BUT LET ME
[1:02:56] TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT WAS NOT YOUR
[1:02:58] FAITH THAT THAT THAT THAT FOUND THAT
[1:03:01] FOUND YOU, BUT IT WAS GOD'S FAITH THAT
[1:03:04] FOUND YOU.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS NOT,
[1:03:08] HE SAID, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IT WAS
[1:03:10] ABRAHAM'S FAITH THAT PERFORMED THE
[1:03:12] MIRACLE.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute. Hebrews 11 said
[1:03:15] through faith SARAH CONCEIVED." BUT
[1:03:17] ABRAHAM WAS THE CHANNEL
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; THAT THAT FAITH CAME THROUGH A
[1:03:22] MESSENGER. HE WAS A CHANNEL THAT FAITH
[1:03:25] CAME INTO HIS HOME AND GOD CHANGED THE
[1:03:28] SITUATION around
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; and it became personal. This is why that
[1:03:32] God the unfolding of this faith to you
[1:03:34] and I even as the prophet would stand
[1:03:36] there in perfect faith and he says look
[1:03:38] if you don't have faith for this right
[1:03:40] now I'm going to he said you put your
[1:03:42] faith and I'm going to put my faith on
[1:03:43] top of your faith and we are going to
[1:03:45] believe and claim the promise of God for
[1:03:48] our life. Hallelujah. But you see right
[1:03:51] now in this hour I'm not walking by the
[1:03:53] FAITH OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. BUT GOD USED
[1:03:55] THE FAITH THAT HE DEPOSITED THE
[1:03:57] REVELATION. It has been PLACED UPON OUR
[1:04:00] LIVES. BUT LOOK WHAT IT DOES. IT IS TO
[1:04:02] BRING ABOUT A REAL FAITH IN our hearts
[1:04:05] in the promised word of God.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So what did you have to do with it? What
[1:04:11] did I have to do with it?
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Nothing but just yield.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Just yield.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. See, this is why when
[1:04:19] brother Brandham talks about the
[1:04:21] ministry changing and he speaks of how
[1:04:24] this new ministry coming on and I say
[1:04:27] this sometimes this terminology is I
[1:04:30] understand new sometimes for individuals
[1:04:32] but each ministry Noah's ministry Jesus
[1:04:35] ministry it had three pools within that
[1:04:37] ministry. So there is God is continuing
[1:04:40] to unfold with an achievement like the
[1:04:42] achievement of the Lord of the ministry
[1:04:44] of the Lord Jesus was not just to heal
[1:04:46] the sick to walk on water but the
[1:04:48] achievement of that ministry was to
[1:04:51] deliver the word and with that
[1:04:54] delivering of the word is TO PAY THE
[1:04:57] PRICE AND SEND BACK THE HOLY SPIRIT. SO
[1:05:00] THE GOAL, are you listening to me now?
[1:05:02] The goal of every ministry, AND I'M
[1:05:06] TALKING ABOUT THE MINISTRY THAT COMES
[1:05:08] FROM ALMIGHTY GOD, IS NOT TO produce
[1:05:12] little Elijah's, Noah or
[1:05:16] little this. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT
[1:05:17] GOD'S IDEA. BUT GOD'S IDEA IS THAT HE
[1:05:20] CHOOSES LIVES THAT ARE UNIX THAT HIS
[1:05:23] SEED LIFE CAN PASS THROUGH. AND SO IT'S
[1:05:26] NOT MAN ESTABLISHING his image in the
[1:05:29] heart of a people so THAT THEY CAN SAY,
[1:05:31] "OH, I SEE YOU GO TO SO AND SO." WHY?
[1:05:33] OH, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THIS DOCTRINE.
[1:05:35] YOU BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE NOT UNDER THE
[1:05:37] NAMES OF DOCTRINE. I DON'T WANT MY OWN
[1:05:38] NAME BECAUSE MY OWN NAME MEANS I'M IN A
[1:05:41] fallen condition.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; But the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS ABOVE
[1:05:46] EVERY NAME. [cheering and applause]
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? SO THE OBJECTIVE,
[1:05:51] LISTEN TO ME NOW, THE OBJECTIVE OF EVERY
[1:05:54] MINISTRY IS THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE CHRIST
[1:05:58] IN YOU. IT WAS CHRIST THROUGH THE
[1:06:00] MINISTRY OF NOAH. AND WHAT DID HE DO?
[1:06:02] ONLY EIGHT WERE SAVED. Went in there to
[1:06:04] the ark. Is that right?
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE THE EFFECT WAS COMING INTO THE
[1:06:09] ARK. SAME WAY IN ELIJAH'S DAY. REMEMBER
[1:06:11] ELIJAH? EVERYBODY SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON
[1:06:13] MOUNT CARMEL, BUT IT WAS 7,000 THAT
[1:06:16] NEEDED THE STIMULATION OF THAT
[1:06:19] REVELATION TO BRING COURAGE TO STAND ON
[1:06:22] GOD'S WORD.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; BUT THE OBJECTIVE FOR WHAT? IN WHAT
[1:06:28] WOULD be allotted to them? For the Holy
[1:06:30] Spirit to be able to I don't want to
[1:06:32] just say dwell, but to come and to
[1:06:34] influence the lives of the elect.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Because the Calvary hadn't been made
[1:06:38] away. So there could not be an
[1:06:40] indwelling of his spirit like you and I
[1:06:42] are made are made privileged to be a
[1:06:44] partaker of. But that's the objective.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Everybody okay sir?
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; That's the objective. So the prophet is
[1:06:51] talking about now he said there's a new
[1:06:52] ministry that's coming on in his own
[1:06:55] ministry. And he says now he says it's
[1:06:57] going to be far greater. He says and I I
[1:07:00] don't have time to explain it to you but
[1:07:02] the brethren who knows about it it's
[1:07:04] wonderful and it'll be such a great
[1:07:06] thing for the people. I love that
[1:07:07] statement.
[1:07:09] IT'LL BE SUCH A GREAT THING FOR THE
[1:07:11] PEOPLE.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He It wasn't ABOUT WILLIAM BRANDON. IT
[1:07:15] WASN'T ABOUT MAKING a name for himself.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, WHEN HE STOOD IN
[1:07:19] FALSE ANOINTMENTS AT THE END TIME, HE
[1:07:21] SAID, "IT AIN'T WHAT I KNEW.
[1:07:24] IT AIN'T WHAT I DID.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT I SURRENDERED MYSELF TO. I
[1:07:29] JUST HAPPENED TO BE STANDING PRESENT
[1:07:32] WHEN HE DID THE MIRACLES." AMEN.
[1:07:35] [laughter]
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALLOWED YOU AND ME TO BE
[1:07:39] STANDING PRESENT. AND WHAT WE'RE
[1:07:41] WATCHING IS NOT THE UNFOLDING OF HIM ON
[1:07:45] OUT HERE, BUT WE'RE WATCHING THE
[1:07:47] UNVEILING OF CHRIST IN OUR OWN LIVES.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; It's breathtaking, isn't it?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Overwhelming. I'm grateful to God that
[1:07:57] the hour is soon at hand. I believe when
[1:07:59] God is going to help his children,
[1:08:01] especially for those who can't muster
[1:08:03] the faith to raise up and get a hold of
[1:08:05] God like they should, I believe the Lord
[1:08:07] is providing a way for us now to take
[1:08:10] care of them. Also,
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; some runs into into the faith that they
[1:08:13] can just reach over and receive
[1:08:15] anything. That's great faith. Some of
[1:08:17] them has mustard seed faith and has to
[1:08:19] wait so long to get through. I believe
[1:08:21] the Lord is making a way for those
[1:08:24] people now. And I don't know when it
[1:08:27] will be, but it will be just as certain
[1:08:30] as I'm standing here. It will be. Let me
[1:08:33] just kind of update. It's not coming. It
[1:08:36] is.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD MAKING A WAY FOR YOU AND I. HOW
[1:08:42] HAS GOD DONE THIS? HE HAS DONE THIS BY
[1:08:45] his word.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Now remember when WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[1:08:50] EVEN THAT of his WORD AND HOW THAT he
[1:08:53] would reveal himself. Now remember, God
[1:08:56] shows who he is, what we can be, and
[1:09:00] then in between there is that bloodline
[1:09:03] THAT IF YOU CROSS THROUGH THERE, IT'S
[1:09:06] WHAT it's bringing you through there. It
[1:09:08] brings you RIGHT OVER HERE. SO GOD HAS
[1:09:10] PROVIDED A WAY TO CLEANSE US THAT HE
[1:09:14] MIGHT seal or fill our lives and bring
[1:09:17] us into this place of an expression. So
[1:09:20] I want to say this to you in this
[1:09:22] manner. Choice is a great thing.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Right. That's true.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Now, just keep that in mind. Brother
[1:09:28] Brandon makes this statement in choosing
[1:09:29] of a bride, how choice is a great thing.
[1:09:32] And we know we have many choices in
[1:09:34] life, but there's really two big choices
[1:09:37] in life. And so within this faith, I
[1:09:40] want to just let me just drop this now.
[1:09:42] Faith is an atmosphere that is created
[1:09:46] by the unsealing and fulfillment of
[1:09:49] prophecy. You remember the scripture a
[1:09:52] few weeks back that I read to you out of
[1:09:54] uh Jeremiah chapter 29 where God is
[1:09:57] saying I know the thoughts that I have
[1:09:59] toward you
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; to bring you to an expected end of
[1:10:02] peace. Now remember he says in at 70
[1:10:06] YEARS I WILL VISIT BABYLON AND CAUSING
[1:10:09] YOU to return in the fulfillment OF MY
[1:10:12] PROMISE IN CAUSING YOU TO RETURN BACK TO
[1:10:16] this land. Now I WANT TO JUST SAY IT TO
[1:10:18] YOU LIKE THIS. IT WASN'T 70 years that
[1:10:22] brought the change of atmosphere.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, listen now. TIME ALONE WILL
[1:10:29] not change you.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; IF THERE DOESN'T COME A CHANGE IN A
[1:10:34] PERSON'S LIFE, THEY CAN BE LIKE THIS
[1:10:36] YOUNG, AND IF THEY DON'T CHANGE, THEY'LL
[1:10:38] BE LIKE THIS WHEN THEY'RE OLD.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S GOT TO COME A CHANGE. IN
[1:10:42] OTHER WORDS, THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE WHO
[1:10:44] CAN SPAN THE BREACH. THERE'S GOT TO BE
[1:10:47] ONE WHO CAN MAKE UP THE GAP.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHO ALONE CAN DO THAT BUT GOD
[1:10:53] HIMSELF. [applause]
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO HERE WITHIN THAT IT'S NOT
[1:11:00] JUST TIME BUT IT IS GOD FULFILLING HIS
[1:11:03] WORD. REMEMBER DANIEL IN THE BOOK OF
[1:11:05] DANIEL SAID I UNDERSTOOD BY THE BOOKS.
[1:11:08] THIS IS THE TIME.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE READING? JEREMIAH'S
[1:11:12] WRITINGS.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT HE
[1:11:16] HAD JUST GOT OFF THE SHELF AND BLEW THE
[1:11:18] DUST OFF OF.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; HE HAD BEEN IN THAT WORD.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MOMENT, THIS SEASON, THIS TIME,
[1:11:27] IT WAS DIFFERENT. THERE WAS AN ANOINTING
[1:11:29] UPON THAT WORD [screaming] THAT CAUSED
[1:11:31] HIM TO SAY, "WHAT WILL BE IS NOW UPON
[1:11:35] US." [cheering]
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; LISTEN NOW. THE CHANGE IN THE
[1:11:40] ADMINISTRATION AND THE MINISTRY OF THAT
[1:11:42] WORD IN SEASON, OUT OF SEASON, IT HAD AN
[1:11:46] EFFECT.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST drop this in. I had met with
[1:11:50] a brother years years ago. You know, he
[1:11:52] wanted to sit down with me and go over
[1:11:54] uh with the opening of the seventh seal
[1:11:56] and latter reign and things like that
[1:11:57] and wanted me to kind of help him with
[1:11:59] study. And so we had we had met, you
[1:12:01] know, this is probably now about 19
[1:12:02] years ago, 18 years ago. And we sat down
[1:12:05] and I began to deal with just things,
[1:12:07] you know, with the gifts and all those
[1:12:08] things and going through the things, you
[1:12:10] know, where brother Brandham had taken
[1:12:12] us by scripture. And I, you know, had
[1:12:14] sent him a lot and then we got together
[1:12:15] and went through those things. And I
[1:12:17] begin TO POINT OUT THAT WITH THAT OF THE
[1:12:19] latter rain, it's not something we're
[1:12:21] looking forward to. But the latter rain
[1:12:23] is what is falling even now.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Because the latter rain is the maturing
[1:12:29] rain. IT'S THE QUICKENING RAIN. IT'S
[1:12:31] WHAT BRINGS THE GRAIN TO HARVEST.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; And and what was incredible, I'LL NEVER
[1:12:38] FORGET WHAT THE BROTHER TOLD ME AT THAT
[1:12:39] TIME. HE SAID, "BROTHER SAMUEL," he
[1:12:41] said, "now I understand." He said,
[1:12:43] "Because every time," he said that in in
[1:12:46] our church, he said, "When that was
[1:12:48] mentioned or put out THAT THAT'S
[1:12:50] SOMETHING THAT'S COMING BECAUSE, YOU
[1:12:51] KNOW, many are looking for, oh, when the
[1:12:53] when, you know, when the thunders are
[1:12:54] open and WHEN THIS HAPPENS, MAN, THERE'S
[1:12:56] going to be a great dynamic thing."
[1:12:58] That's not it. This is not a PUBLIC
[1:13:00] SHOW. AMEN.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT GOING TO REPRODUCE ISUZA
[1:13:03] STREET.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; ISUZA STREET SERVED ITS PURPOSE.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; AND AND THE LIFE PASSED ON THROUGH THAT
[1:13:11] SHUCK.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING POINT THAT
[1:13:14] THIS BROTHER MADE TO ME. HE SAYS, "NOW I
[1:13:17] UNDERSTAND." HE SAID IT WAS WHEN THAT
[1:13:19] WAS PUT OFF AS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE.
[1:13:21] HE SAID, "YOU COULD FEEL A DEPRESSION
[1:13:24] COME OVER THE CONGREGATION." IT WASN'T
[1:13:26] THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE.
[1:13:29] BUT REMEMBER, THEY CAN LIVE NO HIGHER
[1:13:32] THAN WHAT'S BEING MINISTERED.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THERE HAS TO
[1:13:38] BE. HE SAID EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE AN
[1:13:40] ABSOLUTE. OH, HE SAID HOW WE NEED A MAN
[1:13:43] THAT HAS AN ABSOLUTE OF GOD'S
[1:13:45] [screaming] WORD AND HOLD THAT ABOVE
[1:13:48] THAT CONGREGATION TILL EVERYONE RISES.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A MAN'S IDEA.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ABSOLUTE OF GOD'S WORD.
[1:13:58] [cheering and applause]
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; HEY, WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; THE EVIDENCE NOT JUST OF A BODY CHANGE,
[1:14:05] BUT THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE FREE.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; THE EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR
[1:14:11] YOU. THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE HEALED.
[1:14:13] HOW? WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE? THE EVIDENCE
[1:14:15] IS HIM.
[1:14:17] [cheering]
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; So the breaking of that begins to break
[1:14:24] back the clouds.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Did it stir everybody at once in
[1:14:29] Babylon? NO. MATTER OF FACT, DID it stir
[1:14:33] everybody? NO.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME who never left Babylon.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But there were those who were part of
[1:14:44] that first season
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; to go back and rebuild the temple. and
[1:14:49] and and IT WASN'T THAT THE SECOND ONE'S
[1:14:51] COMING ON. It wasn't that they were
[1:14:53] somehow lacking, BUT IT WAS GOD HAS
[1:14:56] EVERYTHING IN SEASON. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT
[1:14:59] HAVE DONE? LISTEN TO ME NOW.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; This was very important for a church,
[1:15:03] very important for your family, VERY
[1:15:05] IMPORTANT FOR DISCIPLING. WHAT GOOD
[1:15:07] WOULD IT DO TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT ONCE IF
[1:15:11] this part wasn't made ready to sustain
[1:15:14] what was coming on? Right
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; now, I'm not only talking ABOUT THAT
[1:15:19] WITH THE CHURCH, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:15:20] IT WITH INDIVIDUALS LIVES WHEN WE'RE
[1:15:22] DEALING WHEN I'M working with hearts,
[1:15:24] WORKING WITH LIVES. THIS IS WHY THAT WE
[1:15:26] JUST DON'T SAY GET THE HOLY GHOST. GET
[1:15:28] THE HOLY I KNOW THAT, BUT REMEMBER THE
[1:15:30] PROPHET TELLS US HE WON'T COME IN AN
[1:15:33] UNFIT TEMPLE. SO I NEED WITH THAT
[1:15:37] PROMISE IN MIND UH COMING ALONGSIDE AND
[1:15:40] BUILDING THEIR FAITH AND INVITING LIKE
[1:15:43] AND NOT ADMONISHING THEM. INVITE GOD
[1:15:45] INTO YOUR MUSIC. INVITE GOD INTO YOUR
[1:15:48] CLOTHING. INVITE GOD INTO THIS RIGHT
[1:15:50] HERE. AND YOU INVITE GOD. GOD PREPARES
[1:15:53] THE TEMPLE FOR HIMSELF TO COME AND DWELL
[1:15:56] IN.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; ARE you hearing me?
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'S LIKE
[1:16:01] WE'RE TRYING TO HURT. GOD'S PEOPLE ARE
[1:16:03] not
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; herdsmen. shepherds,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; you lead.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; We lead, not push, not shove.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that can be out of
[1:16:13] frustration.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; We're wanting to see something happen.
[1:16:17] YOU DON'T KNOW. You do not know what's
[1:16:19] happening inside of that person's heart.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you can make the wrong
[1:16:26] judgments. If you had been there when
[1:16:27] Abraham and Sarah, you would have called
[1:16:29] Sarah an unbeliever.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:32] BUT BROTHER, SOMETHING HAPPENED.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, DON'T CLOUD THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE ATMOSPHERE YOU
[1:16:40] SEE AROUND YOUR LOVED ONES OR ANOTHER
[1:16:42] [screaming] BELIEVER. AS FAR AS I'M
[1:16:45] CONCERNED, YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS
[1:16:46] MORNING, YOU'RE A BELIEVER.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO CLOUD THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:16:51] NOT GOING TO UNDO WHAT THE WORD IS
[1:16:52] TRYING TO DO. LET THE WORD DO WHAT THE
[1:16:55] WORD DOES. [applause and cheering]
[1:16:58] GOD DON'T NEED THE HELP OF SIRI. I
[1:17:05] [screaming]
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; got in the way.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED ANY OTHER WAY ENGINEERED.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:17:22] God had a reason when he when he came
[1:17:25] upon this earth in the beginning to
[1:17:27] break back the clouds. Choice is such a
[1:17:30] great thing, you know, because God never
[1:17:34] within the sovereignty of God and his
[1:17:38] elective grace.
[1:17:40] God never removed choice.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Every person has a choice.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; So there's a beautiful,
[1:17:51] beautiful
[1:17:52] way that election, the sovereignty of
[1:17:55] God works with choice. God knew the end
[1:18:02] from the beginning.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; This is why in the book of Ecclesiastes,
[1:18:06] it says that those things which are have
[1:18:09] been.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; see, it's not something that's just for
[1:18:14] you and I. We're coming to learn or to
[1:18:16] see or to understand. But God already
[1:18:18] knows.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; He's omniscent.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? He's omnistant.
[1:18:23] He's all knowing. So, it isn't God
[1:18:26] looking down through a crop of humanity
[1:18:29] like picking a kickball team. I choose
[1:18:31] you.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Let me see here. Choose you. I choose
[1:18:37] you. I choose you. Come on. We We've all
[1:18:40] been there.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; There was some games when I got picked,
[1:18:43] you know, when I was in elementary
[1:18:44] school. I got picked right away. I I got
[1:18:46] kicked pretty far. I could catch pretty
[1:18:48] good. But if you wanted to pick somebody
[1:18:50] to run relay races, I was last.
[1:18:55] [laughter]
[1:18:56] You know why? I wasn't good at it. I say
[1:18:59] that so that you understand God's
[1:19:02] choosing is not about how good you are.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, ESAU WAS A MUCH
[1:19:10] BETTER MAN than Jacob.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK
[1:19:19] AT THIS AND YOU SAY, "WHAT IS THAT
[1:19:21] CHOOSING? WHAT IS THAT?" GOD LOOKED DOWN
[1:19:24] ALL THE WAY, SAW THE END FROM THE
[1:19:27] BEGINNING, AND HE SAW WHAT YOU WOULD DO
[1:19:30] WHEN THE WORD WOULD COME ACROSS YOUR
[1:19:32] PATH. HOW DOES GOD KNOW THAT? BECAUSE
[1:19:35] HOW DOES HE respond to his own word?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; WE ARE A PART. WE'RE ALWAYS A PART OF
[1:19:42] GOD. AMEN.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; MY BOYS, THE THREE BOYS, WELL, ZACH'S
[1:19:46] NOT HERE THIS MORNING. THEY WERE IN ME
[1:19:48] THE WHOLE TIME.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; They were in me. IT'S NATURAL. EVEN AS
[1:19:53] THEY TAKE ON CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND
[1:19:56] WHATEVER MORE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY
[1:19:58] SAY, "NOT going to do this. Not going TO
[1:20:00] DO THAT. JUST GIVE IT A FEW YEARS."
[1:20:03] [laughter]
[1:20:05] THAT'S WHY I CATCH HIM WEARING my shoes
[1:20:06] around the house now and I say
[1:20:09] [laughter]
[1:20:10] just wait a FEW YEARS TILL YOU GET THAT
[1:20:12] REVELATION. THREE PAIRS OF COMFORTABLE
[1:20:14] SHOES IS BETTER THAN 10 pair that you
[1:20:16] can't stand in. [laughter]
[1:20:19] Oh, we have a good time. BOY, JUST WAIT.
[1:20:22] YOU SEE WHAT IT IS? I AND THEY THEY'VE
[1:20:24] COME OUT. THEY COME OUT OF ME. I KNOW
[1:20:26] THERE'S CHARACTERISTICS. I KNOW THE
[1:20:28] STRAINS. I KNOW THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE
[1:20:29] GOING TO BATTLE. And yeah, they've got
[1:20:31] HDR mixed in there. God bless their
[1:20:33] hearts and we pray for them all the time
[1:20:35] and SO FORTH. BUT YOU KNOW, ALL OF THAT
[1:20:37] IS GOING TO COME OUT.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS INSIDE OF YOUR
[1:20:41] LIFE, IT WAS ALWAYS TO BE A SON AND
[1:20:45] DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE DUCK
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; THAT was born
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; and he walked around with the chickens.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the testimony story,
[1:20:58] TOO.
[1:20:59] ONE DAY HE GOT A SCENT OF WATER.
[1:21:03] SPRINGTIME HIT AND HE GOT A SCENT OF
[1:21:05] WATER. BUDDY, HE NEVER WAS IN THE
[1:21:08] CHICKEN PIN AGAIN.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; HE WENT TO THE WATER. WHAT WAS IT? THE
[1:21:12] SCENT OF WATER. IT AROUSED WHAT
[1:21:15] [screaming] WAS IN HIM.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THAT WATER. HE WAS
[1:21:20] BORN FOR THAT WATER.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL [screaming] YOU, YOU WERE
[1:21:24] BORN FOR THIS WORD.
[1:21:29] choice is a great thing.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; You see now look I God our we have our
[1:21:34] own free moral agency.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Free moral agency.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Just let me tell you like this. Just
[1:21:40] because somebody has made a choice right
[1:21:42] now. That ain't you can't define that
[1:21:44] and say, "Well, they've already made
[1:21:45] their choice and they're going to you
[1:21:47] don't know that."
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; friends. I have watched God restore
[1:21:52] lives that have been gone for years.
[1:21:56] That's right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Out of sight.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; You see, you can't and and you don't
[1:22:03] want to you don't NEED TO EVEN WORRY
[1:22:06] ABOUT WRITING anybody off.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You don't want to do that anyhow.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; YOU LEAVE IT IN GOD'S HANDS.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. THIS IS WHY WHEN THE
[1:22:17] PROPHET'S TALKING ABOUT with free moral
[1:22:18] agency, he said, YOU KNOW, I'M A FREE
[1:22:20] moral agent. If I want life, I can have
[1:22:22] it. If I want to refuse it, I'm a free
[1:22:24] moral agent. I can take the devil then
[1:22:26] but if I want God I can take God and
[1:22:29] that's before every person that ever
[1:22:31] come on this earth. Now he says you know
[1:22:34] it's not by my mental conceptions he
[1:22:36] said but what is it? It took the Holy
[1:22:38] Spirit to bring me from the earth. And
[1:22:41] if the Holy Spirit made me what I am
[1:22:45] without having any choice, how much more
[1:22:48] can he bring me back out of the dust of
[1:22:50] the earth
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; by choice?
[1:22:54] not my intellectuals, not my church
[1:22:56] membership, but by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:22:57] brooding down and calling to me, I'll
[1:23:00] answer back to it. And he raised his
[1:23:02] hands and swore that he raised me up in
[1:23:04] the last days. Oh, brother, intellectual
[1:23:08] will never do it. Mental conception will
[1:23:12] never do it. It's the work of the Holy
[1:23:15] Spirit that brings the human being to
[1:23:17] his place. Make your choice. Oh, happy
[1:23:21] day. I fix my choice on thee, my savior
[1:23:24] and my God. No matter what the rest of
[1:23:26] the world does, it's sinking sand. My
[1:23:29] choice is on thee.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Do you see? Choice is A GREAT THING.
[1:23:34] YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE SITTING HERE THIS
[1:23:36] MORNING. YOU KNOW, YOU HAD A CHOICE ON
[1:23:37] whether you were going to come to
[1:23:38] church.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You had A CHOICE. YOU HAD A CHOICE WHEN
[1:23:44] YOU CAME IN HERE IF YOU WERE GOING TO be
[1:23:45] a worshshiper. RIGHT?
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; YOU HAD A CHOICE IF YOU WERE GOING TO
[1:23:49] ENTER IN AND GET INTO THE WORD AND SAY,
[1:23:51] "GOD, SPEAK TO MY HEART." YOU HAD A
[1:23:52] CHOICE. THESE ARE ALL CHOICES.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A CHOICE WHEN YOU LEAVE OUT OF
[1:23:56] HERE. AND you know, MAYBE WHATEVER TIME
[1:23:58] YOU LEAVE, YOU'LL HAVE A CHOICE WHERE
[1:24:00] WHAT YOU DO THE REST OF THE DAY. IT WILL
[1:24:01] ALL BE CHOICES.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, there's plans
[1:24:05] already laid out." But you'll choose
[1:24:07] whether or not how long you do those
[1:24:09] plans or even if you go through with
[1:24:10] them.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; You still have choice.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Choice is a great thing. And choice does
[1:24:16] not remove that free is not does not
[1:24:18] remove the election of God. BUT GOD
[1:24:21] KNOWS AND SEES WHAT choice that you're
[1:24:24] going to make and he puts that before
[1:24:26] you. In other words, brother Ram SAYS IT
[1:24:28] LIKE THIS. GOD DON'T MAKE ANYBODY serve
[1:24:31] him.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; NOBODY. IT'S A CHOICE.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. JESUS SAID, "IF YOU LOVE ME, keep
[1:24:38] my commandments." That's right.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; You see, the reason he WOULD EVEN SHOW
[1:24:42] HIS WORD is because he loves you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler didn't see it that
[1:24:48] way. HE SAW IT AS I can't do this. That
[1:24:50] wasn't what the commandment was about.
[1:24:52] IT WAS GOD'S LOVE.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE WAS UNFOLDING TO HIM. THIS IS
[1:24:57] WHAT'S KEEPING you back because it's
[1:24:59] something you value more than eternal
[1:25:01] life. Yet, you're here asking for it,
[1:25:03] but you're valuing your own possessions.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; It was a choice,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; right? It was a choice. So choice, it
[1:25:11] took the Holy Spirit. You and I did not
[1:25:13] choose. I mean, we didn't choose, you
[1:25:15] know, uh, how our nose is going to look
[1:25:17] and we didn't choose what parents were
[1:25:18] going to come through.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it like this. You didn't
[1:25:21] even choose what the act was, whether it
[1:25:23] was the act inside of marriage or it was
[1:25:25] under maybe adultery or fornication. You
[1:25:27] didn't even choose that.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. We don't need to preach the
[1:25:33] blood takes care of it all.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; But you didn't even get to choose that.
[1:25:37] You didn't get to choose who your
[1:25:38] parents were.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Your parents didn't even choose you.
[1:25:45] [laughter]
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Boom.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T EVEN, YOU KNOW, YOUR
[1:25:52] PARENTS DIDN'T TAKE YOU AND, YOU KNOW,
[1:25:54] LIKE A MR. POTATO HEAD. I like this
[1:25:55] nose. I like this ear. AND I YOU'RE NOT,
[1:25:57] IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; You know, parents, I hope he acts like
[1:26:01] you. I hope he has this like you. I hope
[1:26:02] he I hope he Okay.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T GET TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. And if you DIDN'T GET TO MAKE
[1:26:14] THAT CHOICE, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WHAT
[1:26:17] BROUGHT YOU FORTH IN THAT WAY, THEN HOW
[1:26:21] MUCH MORE WHEN YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH THE
[1:26:23] CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE A CHOICE TO
[1:26:27] surrender and yield to his working,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; how much more will he not bring you out?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Brother Brandham goes on to
[1:26:35] say, "The Holy Spirit that's moving down
[1:26:37] through his word is and saying, "This is
[1:26:39] my word. Man shall not live by bread
[1:26:41] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[1:26:43] out of the MOUTH OF GOD." YES, HOLY
[1:26:45] SPIRIT.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; I promise eternal life to THEM THAT
[1:26:48] BELIEVE. I BELIEVE, HOLY SPIRIT, I'LL
[1:26:51] SEAL YOU. THEN WATCH your life begin to
[1:26:55] move.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Not the church, THE HOLY SPIRIT. NOT THE
[1:26:59] DENOMINATION, THE HOLY SPIRIT. SO IT'S
[1:27:02] RESPOND. IT'S YIELDING TO THE WORD.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S YIELDING IN FAITH TO THE WORD. YES,
[1:27:09] I BELIEVE IT. WHAT GOD IS SAYING, "YES,
[1:27:11] LORD, I RECEIVE IT. YES, I BELIEVE IT."
[1:27:14] AND THEN watching our life being moved
[1:27:18] by him.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Let me just say it. The same one moving
[1:27:21] your life is the same one that moves
[1:27:23] with uncction for things to be said how
[1:27:25] they're said.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Spirit that moved on
[1:27:29] the prophets. He's the same Holy Spirit
[1:27:31] here this morning. That's right.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, this is why when you
[1:27:37] know David could write about how
[1:27:39] marvelous God's thoughts were toward
[1:27:42] him, he said in Psalms 139, "Oh Lord,
[1:27:45] thou hast searched me and known me. Thou
[1:27:48] knowest my downsitting and my uprising.
[1:27:51] Thou understandest my thought afar. Thou
[1:27:54] comp thou compasseth my path and my
[1:27:56] lying down, and art acquainted with all
[1:27:59] my ways." Verse 17. How precious also
[1:28:03] are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How
[1:28:06] great is the sum of them. If I should
[1:28:09] count them, they are more in number than
[1:28:12] the sand. And when I awake, I am still
[1:28:15] with thee. In Psalms 139, going back up
[1:28:19] to verse 13, for thou hast possessed my
[1:28:22] reigns. Thou hast covered me in my
[1:28:25] mother's womb. I will praise thee, for I
[1:28:28] am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:28:31] Marvelous are thy works, and thy and my
[1:28:35] soul knoweth right well. MY SUBSTANCE
[1:28:40] WAS NOT HID from thee, WHEN I WAS MADE
[1:28:42] in secret, and curiously wrought IN THE
[1:28:45] LOWEST PARTS OF THE EARTH. THINE EYES
[1:28:48] did see my substance, yet being
[1:28:50] unperfect. AND IN THY BOOK ALL MY
[1:28:53] MEMBERS were written, which in
[1:28:56] continuence were fashioned, when as yet
[1:29:00] there was none of them.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; David is writing about the book of life.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; David under inspiration is aware. God,
[1:29:12] you have known all about me.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; You are able to look and you are able to
[1:29:19] see. You know me and you also know all
[1:29:23] the downsitting, all the upright. In
[1:29:26] other words, you know the temperament
[1:29:28] that you set in my life.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; You know the temperament is also an
[1:29:33] opportunity for overcoming.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Your temperament can be a great thing,
[1:29:38] but it can also be a hindrance.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; The prophet, it was revealed to the
[1:29:44] prophet about his melancholy. He had to
[1:29:46] shoot them eye and the squirrels through
[1:29:47] the eye. But he was crying about it
[1:29:49] because something was off.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; But see, then the Holy Spirit came to
[1:29:53] him and said, "I made you that way for a
[1:29:55] purpose."
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Because why? To stand. And brother Bram
[1:29:59] caught it. It was to stand and see the
[1:30:01] word hit hit dead on with a bull's eye.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I've made you that way for a purpose.
[1:30:07] Ain't it incredible how God will even
[1:30:09] bring together? I think of it even in
[1:30:10] marriages. I think how God works such in
[1:30:12] a in a tremendous way. And we look at
[1:30:14] that and we we look down in the
[1:30:15] temperament. Oh, the old temperament.
[1:30:17] REMEMBER THE PROPHET TELLS US that what
[1:30:19] it is. He said the Holy Spirit is that
[1:30:21] will that sits down in the middle OF THE
[1:30:23] WHEEL. HE SETS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE. HE
[1:30:26] SAID OF YOUR TEMPERAMENT.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; God needed Paul to be a chloric.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; We're going through.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; HE NEEDED A MAN WITH VISION, A MAN THAT
[1:30:39] WOULD stand unrelenting.
[1:30:41] And remember, God also seen the weakness
[1:30:44] in that strength.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THAT. GOD
[1:30:50] KNOWS ABOUT GOD KNOW LOOK AT LOOK GOD
[1:30:53] KNEW ABOUT EVERY TRIAL. GOD, YOU
[1:30:55] UNDERSTAND FRIENDS, THERE IS NO WAY FOR
[1:30:57] YOU AND I TO COME INTO PERFECTION. I'M
[1:31:00] NOT TALKING ABOUT IF YOUR SOUL THAT
[1:31:02] COMES THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:31:04] I'M TALKING ABOUT INTO MATURITY. THERE'S
[1:31:07] NO WAY TO COME TO MATURITY WITHOUT THE
[1:31:10] TEST AND TRIALS. AND THE WORD IS SENT TO
[1:31:13] ENCOURAGE YOU AND I.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; AND REMIND US WHO WE ARE.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER WAY. THAT'S HOW
[1:31:22] CHARACTER IS MADE.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; This body CAME FORTH THROUGH HIM BY A
[1:31:31] SEXUAL ACT. BUT THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE GO
[1:31:35] AND PASS INTO THE RAPTURE AND I KNOW
[1:31:37] HAVING YOU KNOW GOING INTO THE THEOPHONY
[1:31:39] BUT THAT GLORIFIED BODY IS NOT GOING TO
[1:31:42] COME IS NOT GOING TO BE A SIMPLE
[1:31:45] REPLACEMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE A
[1:31:47] RESURRECTION AND THAT FROM THE VERY MIND
[1:31:50] OF GOD IT WILL BE COMPLIMENTARY. IT WILL
[1:31:54] NOT BE WHAT HAS COME THROUGH JAMES AND
[1:31:57] PAT BROWNING. IT WILL BE WHAT HAS COME
[1:32:00] FORTH ACCORDING TO GOD'S ORIGINAL WORD.
[1:32:03] IT WILL NOT HAVE THE COMPLEXES IN IT. IT
[1:32:06] WILL NOT HAVE THE WEAKNESSES IN IT. IT
[1:32:08] WILL BE FREE FROM ALL OF THAT BECAUSE
[1:32:10] IT'S COMING STRAIGHT FROM GOD.
[1:32:14] [cheering and applause]
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, I want you just to think
[1:32:20] of that
[1:32:22] God had it all written here
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; right in his right in his book, the book
[1:32:26] of life. Like you have a family album.
[1:32:30] YOU HAVE PICTURES OF YOUR kids when
[1:32:32] they're born.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; God had pictures of you and his family
[1:32:35] album before you were ever born in this
[1:32:38] earth.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY ALBUM WAS ALREADY MADE UP.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THE BIBLE TELLS US IN REVELATIONS
[1:32:46] 13 that there were those WHO WILL NOT
[1:32:49] WORSHIP THAT OF THE BEAST, WILL NOT BE
[1:32:51] ENTER INTO HIS SYSTEM. They they they
[1:32:54] THEY HAVE THEIR NAMES WRITTEN IN THE
[1:32:56] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GOD ALREADY MADE UP HIS FAMILY
[1:33:01] ALBUM.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And you KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF HE'S
[1:33:05] ALREADY MADE UP HIS FAMILY ALBUM, THERE
[1:33:07] HAD TO BE something positive to take a
[1:33:09] picture of.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; AND HE ALREADY TOOK A PICTURE OF YOUR
[1:33:15] REPRESENTATION BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:33:18] THE WORLD.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. THIS IS WHY THE
[1:33:22] WORD ITSELF, THAT PHOTO ALBUM, THAT
[1:33:24] FAMILY ALBUM IS NOT SOMETHING WAY OUT
[1:33:27] THERE. THAT FAMILY ALBUM IS THE WORD OF
[1:33:29] GOD BEING REVEALED.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD'S NOT JUST MAKING KNOWN HIS
[1:33:36] THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU. You are his
[1:33:39] thoughts.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS WORD.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE WORD IS
[1:33:44] CALLING FOR THE CHARACTERISTIC OF CHRIST
[1:33:47] IN THIS HOUR, THAT'S WHY A METHODIST
[1:33:49] MESSAGE WILL NEVER TAKE AN EFFECT ON
[1:33:51] YOU. A PRESBYTERIAN, A BAPTIST, A
[1:33:53] PENTECOSTAL, IT CANNOT BRING FORTH OUT
[1:33:56] OF [screaming] YOUR LIFE WHAT CHRIST CAN
[1:33:59] IN THIS SEASON.
[1:34:01] [cheering]
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; They had their part. They lived out
[1:34:06] their word. They lived out their season.
[1:34:08] Now it's bride time. Right?
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; You have to recognize your day and its
[1:34:15] message.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So here before, think of
[1:34:20] the word before
[1:34:23] you were a gene in your father.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; As we said before, you didn't know about
[1:34:28] it,
[1:34:30] but God made a bedding ground to take
[1:34:31] you out of your mother.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; So then you could have fellowship with
[1:34:38] your father.
[1:34:41] The ram says the life that you've come
[1:34:42] in now, the natural life, physical life
[1:34:46] that was by your father and the way you
[1:34:48] can come born again, the only way it has
[1:34:52] to be from your heavenly father, his
[1:34:55] attributes.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come to
[1:34:59] me.
[1:35:00] You are here because your name was
[1:35:04] placed on the Lamb's book of life before
[1:35:07] there was even a foundation of the
[1:35:09] world.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; You're a gene, a spiritual gene out of
[1:35:13] your heavenly father, a part of God's
[1:35:15] word. You said, I've said it. I've said
[1:35:18] it before. You was with Jesus when he
[1:35:21] was here because he was the word. YOU
[1:35:24] SUFFERED WITH HIM, DIED WITH HIM, buried
[1:35:27] with him, rose with him, and now you're
[1:35:29] sitting in heavenly places with him.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Remember, before
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; God told Jeremiah
[1:35:37] that before I formed thee in the belly,
[1:35:40] I knew thee.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE thou camest out of the womb,
[1:35:45] I sanctified thee, and ordained thee to
[1:35:47] be a prophet unto the nations. The
[1:35:50] prophet said you were made for an
[1:35:52] eternal purpose because you was the
[1:35:54] manifestation of an attribute
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; that was IN GOD. THAT THOUGHT of you and
[1:36:02] expressed you and he made an earth to
[1:36:07] take you out of and to make you a human
[1:36:11] being.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Sin come along and perverted his way.
[1:36:15] You come anyhow, but you was lost with
[1:36:18] the world. So he come and redeemed you
[1:36:23] the expressed attribute.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on and who is this
[1:36:29] Melazdc? And he says now he says I want
[1:36:32] you to think about it. You were in him
[1:36:33] his attributes in the beginning. This is
[1:36:36] when the book of life comes into view.
[1:36:39] And he refers to Revelations 13. I
[1:36:41] already referenced the of the beast that
[1:36:43] comes upon the earth will deceive all
[1:36:45] those people on the earth whose names
[1:36:47] were not written in the lamb's book of
[1:36:48] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:36:50] And he speaks, he says, think of it.
[1:36:52] Jesus before he was ever born, 4,000
[1:36:55] years before he came on earth and
[1:36:57] several thousand years before you came
[1:36:59] on earth, Jesus in God's mind died for
[1:37:03] the sins of the world. and the book of
[1:37:06] life was made and your name was put on
[1:37:09] the the book of life before the
[1:37:12] foundation of the world. He said that's
[1:37:14] the Bible truth. Your name was ordained
[1:37:16] of God and placed on the book of life
[1:37:18] before the foundation of the world. You
[1:37:20] were there in his attributes.
[1:37:24] You don't remember it. No, because
[1:37:26] you're just a part of this life. You are
[1:37:29] a part of God when you become a son and
[1:37:31] daughter of God. Anybody remember being
[1:37:33] in your father? That's good.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember being in your
[1:37:37] mother?
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. Do you remember the day
[1:37:42] you were born?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't. You don't know. Is he
[1:37:47] going to touch my doctrine? I'm asking
[1:37:49] you a question. Do you remember the day
[1:37:50] you were born?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the doctor? Do you
[1:37:54] remember the nurse? Oh, some of you,
[1:37:56] man.
[1:37:58] But you know what? Is there any question
[1:38:00] you've been born? That's right.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU QUESTIONING YOU'VE BEEN BORN?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; You're here. [cheering]
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE CERTIFICATE, BUT YOU'RE
[1:38:08] HERE.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO DISPUTING.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND, FRIENDS? YOU CAN TRY TO
[1:38:14] GO. OH, I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT. GO
[1:38:16] BACK TO THAT MOMENT WHEN DR. BRADICK WAS
[1:38:18] THERE IN ROCKFORD AND VANWARD HOSPITAL
[1:38:21] IN VANWARD, OHIO, AND DR. BRAD WITH
[1:38:23] WHATEVER NURSES that was there at the
[1:38:24] time, Stella. I don't know who they
[1:38:26] were, but oh, WHEN THEY WERE THERE, YOU
[1:38:27] DON'T REMEMBER THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, I
[1:38:30] KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN BORN.
[1:38:32] [cheering and applause]
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHY? I'M RIGHT
[1:38:35] HERE, RIGHT NOW, WALKING [screaming] AND
[1:38:38] LIVING AS A HUMAN BEING. AND I KNOW I'VE
[1:38:40] BEEN BORN AGAIN AS A SON AND DAUGHTER OF
[1:38:43] GOD. MY LIFE'S BEEN CHANGED. I'M WALKING
[1:38:45] [screaming] IN GOD'S WORD. AND MY SOUL
[1:38:48] SAYS AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:38:51] [applause and cheering]
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:55] HALLELUJAH. PUT THAT THE DEVIL'S NOSE.
[1:38:58] [applause]
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; CUZ I'VE GOT MY CERTIFICATE. MY NAME
[1:39:03] [screaming] IS ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF
[1:39:05] LIFE. [cheering]
[1:39:06] [applause]
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; THAT ATTRIBUTE WAS FIRST GOD, the
[1:39:19] thought. Now, let me just I'm honing in
[1:39:22] on something here. The attribute was
[1:39:25] first God, the thought, the attribute
[1:39:29] itself all in one without being
[1:39:32] expressed. Then when he expressed
[1:39:35] secondarily, he became then the word and
[1:39:40] the word was made flesh
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us.
[1:39:45] So now
[1:39:47] just keep that in mind as the Bible
[1:39:50] takes us regarding in Romans nine and I
[1:39:54] want to just come through this in Romans
[1:39:58] in Romans nine and with this on that
[1:40:00] that attribute remember neither because
[1:40:03] they are the seed of Abraham are they
[1:40:05] all children but in Isaac shall thy seed
[1:40:10] be called that is they which are the
[1:40:12] children of the flesh says
[1:40:15] these are not the children of God but
[1:40:18] the children of the promise are counted
[1:40:21] for the seed. Now you saw that when the
[1:40:23] Lord Jesus came there were those who
[1:40:24] were of the flesh
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; and then those who were actually of the
[1:40:28] seed of Abraham the promise
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; you're saying what what what was it that
[1:40:34] made the difference when the word was
[1:40:37] made flesh
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:40:41] and intents OF THE HEART THE WORD
[1:40:43] BROUGHT FORTH THOSE REACTIONS. THAT'S
[1:40:45] RIGHT.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; JUST AS MUCH AS THE WORD BROUGHT FORTH
[1:40:48] THE REACTION WHEREIN THEM THEY SAID
[1:40:50] YOU'RE BEZEL ELBA. THEY HAD everything
[1:40:53] religiously down. These were not
[1:40:55] scallywags.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; These were people as the prophet said
[1:40:58] you couldn't put your finger on their
[1:41:00] life.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; They had everything down that Jesus said
[1:41:04] you're whited supplers.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Look good on the outside but you're full
[1:41:08] of dead men's bones.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Right. BUT JUST AS MUCH AS IT BROUGHT
[1:41:12] THAT EFFECT on them, I don't want to
[1:41:15] focus so much on them. WHEN IT BROUGHT
[1:41:17] THE EFFECT ON THE BELIEVERS,
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT THE EFFECT ON THE BELIEVERS.
[1:41:24] It here CAME A MATTHEW. HERE COMES
[1:41:26] PETER. HERE COMES ANDREW. HERE COMES
[1:41:28] NATHANIEL. HERE COMES BARTHOLOMEW. HERE
[1:41:30] COMES THEM. YOU SAY, "YEAH, BUT HERE
[1:41:31] COMES JUDAS." BUT REMEMBER, JUDAS
[1:41:35] DEPARTED.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN HIM ALL [screaming] ALONG.
[1:41:40] That's right.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? JUDAS HE WASN'T GOING
[1:41:44] TO CONTINUE ON WITH THE WORD. BUT THAT'S
[1:41:46] DIFFERENT WITH YOU.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S DIFFERENT WITH YOU. IT'S NOT YOU
[1:41:51] TRYING TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, NOT YOU
[1:41:54] TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING FIT, BUT YOU
[1:41:56] ARE RESPONDING TO THE WORD IN OUR MIDST.
[1:42:00] AND THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THAT CREATION
[1:42:03] IN YOUR HEART. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET
[1:42:05] SAID, "WHAT IS THAT THAT'S MAKING YOU
[1:42:08] FEEL THAT WAY?" 1965 EASTER SEAL. IT'S
[1:42:11] GOD FULFILLING THE [screaming] WORD FOR
[1:42:14] THIS DAY.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THERE WERE MANY THAT WAS WALKING
[1:42:20] IN A PREVIOUS LIFE IN A PREVIOUS DAY.
[1:42:23] BUT NOW IN THIS TIME, THE PROPHECY
[1:42:26] [screaming] BEING FULFILLED, IT HAS AN
[1:42:29] EFFECT UPON THE SEED OF GOD.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And who are the seed of God? The
[1:42:34] attributes of God.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Attributes of God. his thoughts.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Now watch this.
[1:42:44] When Rebecca also had conceived
[1:42:47] by one, let me go back to that minute. I
[1:42:50] think that's powerful. For this is the
[1:42:52] word of promise. At this time will I
[1:42:53] come and Sarah shall have a son. I keep
[1:42:56] reading through that right there. I keep
[1:42:57] thinking of that quote I went through
[1:42:58] and just rehearsed again. I read about I
[1:43:00] think about that for this word of
[1:43:02] promise. Sarah who first doubted but now
[1:43:04] remember it was God who came in. IT WAS
[1:43:06] GOD who performed the miracle in her
[1:43:08] life.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Sarah had nothing to do with it. Oh, I
[1:43:11] really believed. I REALLY KNOW IT WAS
[1:43:13] GOD. [cheering]
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO DOUBT SOME OF YOU WERE
[1:43:17] RUNNING AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS MESSAGE
[1:43:19] YOU GET, BUT YOU CAN'T OUTRUN THE PLAN
[1:43:22] OF GOD.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; ALL KINDS OF CHOICES AND EVERYTHING ELSE
[1:43:28] THAT THROUGH YOUR LIFE. AND THE DEVIL
[1:43:30] THOUGHT HE COULD SNOW YOU IN, SEAL YOU
[1:43:32] IN, BUT HE CAN'T KEEP BACK. [screaming]
[1:43:35] THE WORD FROM COMING INTO MANIFESTATION.
[1:43:39] [applause and cheering]
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. You can
[1:43:46] be in the awfulst mess. You can have be
[1:43:49] in the awfulst sin and condition there
[1:43:51] is. But there is nothing
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; that Jesus won't step down
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; into a situation and turn that situation
[1:44:01] around.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do you know?" Because he
[1:44:03] did it for me.
[1:44:06] IF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME INTO THIS
[1:44:08] PIG PIN,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN MY PIG
[1:44:13] PIN.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO ME THERE.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; GOD CAME TO THE WOMAN IN THE WELL AT THE
[1:44:21] WELL IN THE CONDITION SHE WAS IN.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; He had an appointment.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; That was before Google calendar, too.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:35] Notice, and not only this, but when
[1:44:37] Rebecca also had conceived by one, even
[1:44:40] by her father Isaac,
[1:44:42] for the children being not yet born,
[1:44:44] neither having done good or evil, that
[1:44:46] the purpose of God according to election
[1:44:49] might stand,
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; not of works, but of him that calleth.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; It was said unto her, the elder shall
[1:44:59] serve the younger. It's written, Jacob
[1:45:01] have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
[1:45:03] Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he
[1:45:06] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:45:08] the image of his son, that he might be
[1:45:10] the firstborn among many brethren.
[1:45:14] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[1:45:16] he also called. And whom he called, them
[1:45:19] he also justified, and whom he
[1:45:21] justified, them he also glorified.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is specific
[1:45:29] calling. what I just read here on this
[1:45:30] verse and what I read here, this is
[1:45:32] specific calling. You've got to keep
[1:45:34] your word balanced because you can say,
[1:45:35] "Well, many are called, few are chosen."
[1:45:37] But you've got to keep the choosing what
[1:45:39] God is saying in the word when where
[1:45:41] he's talking about this calling that's
[1:45:44] taking place here.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; You're receiving a specific call. It's
[1:45:49] not you going along with the rest,
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD DEALING WITH YOUR LIFE
[1:45:55] PERSONALLY. I know we went along with
[1:45:57] mom and dad. went along WITH OTHERS. YOU
[1:45:59] MIGHT HAVE WENT ALONG, BUT ONE DAY
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; IT GOT PERSONAL.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; ONE DAY THE WORD GOT PERSONAL in your
[1:46:06] life.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? IT'S GOD MAKING
[1:46:10] A PERSONAL CALL.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT LIKE ON YOUR CELL PHONE
[1:46:15] WHERE THEY SEND OUT AN ALERT AND YOU'RE
[1:46:17] IN THE MIDDLE OF CHURCH. YOU'RE IN THE
[1:46:19] MIDDLE OF THE SUPERMARKET. AMBER ALERT.
[1:46:21] AMBER ALERT. AMBER ALERT. YELLOW CAR
[1:46:24] WITH THIS LICENSE PLATE. [screaming]
[1:46:25] SUCH AND SUCH HAS HAPPENED. AND
[1:46:27] EVERYBODY GETS it
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; except if you turn them off.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; This is different.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; YES, THE CALL GOES OUT. IT GOES OUT TO
[1:46:39] ALL. BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT
[1:46:41] REGISTERS WITH YOUR DEVICE.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; IT REGISTERS IN YOUR life
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; to do what? Bring you into rest. And
[1:46:52] rest
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; is your position.
[1:46:55] So how does God call us? He calls us by
[1:46:58] his word.
[1:47:00] He calls us by his word. This is why
[1:47:02] Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto
[1:47:06] you, they are spirit and they are life."
[1:47:12] He says in verse 65, "No man can come
[1:47:14] unto me except it were given unto him of
[1:47:18] my father."
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Can I have just a couple more moments?
[1:47:23] Let me just drop this drop this bring
[1:47:25] this down of the attributes of the
[1:47:28] thought and of the word
[1:47:32] and I want to just
[1:47:35] just deal with this just a moment.
[1:47:39] The prophet takes this all through the
[1:47:41] message, but
[1:47:43] the message the future home. I've been
[1:47:46] combing through that here the past past
[1:47:48] while.
[1:47:50] And it just so struck my heart how the
[1:47:53] prophet because I remember just from
[1:47:55] studies on the gifts and things like
[1:47:56] that, brother Bran will take this
[1:47:57] message in the future home.
[1:48:01] And he's picking up things that he's
[1:48:02] already taught all along. And he makes
[1:48:05] he makes the declaration about how that
[1:48:09] there is something much different
[1:48:12] with he says a prophecy and an
[1:48:15] interpretation and he's talking about
[1:48:17] discernment. Remember when brother
[1:48:20] Brandham he he he he he told them he
[1:48:22] says look the same thing that prophecy
[1:48:26] is not something to come by a person's
[1:48:29] feeling
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; right
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; oh I feel this is something that needs
[1:48:32] to be said that's why brother Brandham
[1:48:34] could say even regarding interpretations
[1:48:36] question answers God being misunderstood
[1:48:38] multiple ones where he goes through that
[1:48:41] and we took a whole service on that and
[1:48:42] he deals with how he says many times
[1:48:44] interpretations what it is what's wrong
[1:48:46] is because people give an interpretation
[1:48:49] based on what they feel the spirit is
[1:48:52] wanting to say.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; This is very important. See that it not
[1:48:57] limited. Just follow me here within
[1:48:59] this. So when brother Brandham comes
[1:49:01] into future home, he's bringing this
[1:49:03] back up and he says, "Look," he says,
[1:49:05] "the one who stands there in that
[1:49:07] discernment like you see on the platform
[1:49:09] and and you're from so and so and this
[1:49:11] and this and that." The prophet says
[1:49:13] that's how specific
[1:49:16] that prophecy
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; in the church within one of the nine
[1:49:20] spiritual gifts is to be
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; right now. Brother Bram says within that
[1:49:26] he says it will now here's what he says
[1:49:28] he'll give three three qualifiers. He
[1:49:30] says it will call out somebody
[1:49:32] specifically by name
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; tell them what to do and what to avoid.
[1:49:37] Or he says it's something that's spoken
[1:49:39] and the person or persons there know
[1:49:42] it's to them and it hasn't called their
[1:49:44] name
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; you know out publicly.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; So so what it is it becomes known
[1:49:48] between them and God. So discernment and
[1:49:51] prophecy is not the ideas of man.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; It's not the impressions.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; It's not spiritual impressions
[1:50:01] but it's God at work. Now listen. That's
[1:50:05] the same way it comes down within our
[1:50:08] lives when the word of God is coming
[1:50:11] straight from God's thoughts. Listen
[1:50:13] now, brother Bram says this in future
[1:50:15] home. The world, this earth is one of
[1:50:18] his attributes the same as you're one of
[1:50:20] his attributes. The world become one of
[1:50:22] his attributes because it's God's
[1:50:24] thinking in the beginning to have a
[1:50:26] world, to be on a throne, to be a king,
[1:50:28] to be a redeemer, to be a healer. That's
[1:50:30] his attributes. Just like an attribute
[1:50:33] of you, he said, I can say I can't say
[1:50:36] post
[1:50:37] lest I think of a post. I can't say man
[1:50:41] unless I think of man. And when I think
[1:50:44] of man, then I say man. The thinking is
[1:50:48] my attribute and the expression is THE
[1:50:51] WORD. LIKE ISAIAH, HOW COULD HE say a
[1:50:55] virgin was going to conceive? He said, '
[1:50:58] See, many of you wondering how that
[1:51:00] discernment comes. I'm going to tell
[1:51:02] you. IT'S A WORD THAT I SAY AND IT ISN'T
[1:51:06] MY THINKING CUZ I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T
[1:51:11] KNOW OF THE THINKING OF IT. HOW CAN I
[1:51:13] TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU COME
[1:51:16] FROM WHEN I DON'T KNOW YOU? HOW CAN I
[1:51:19] TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID 10 YEARS AGO WHEN
[1:51:22] I NEVER SEEN YOU IN YOUR LIFE, IN MY
[1:51:24] LIFE? HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHERE WHAT
[1:51:27] YOU'LL DO? AND WHERE YOU'LL BE 10 YEARS
[1:51:28] FROM NOW. HOW DO I KNOW THE FUTURE? BUT
[1:51:31] IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S THOUGHT.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT HE'S GETTING TO RIGHT NOW?
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; THIS THIS MESSAGE IS NOT MY THOUGHTS.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S
[1:51:44] [screaming]
[1:51:45] THINKING.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS GOD'S THOUGHTS.
[1:51:51] [cheering]
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; THUS SAITH THE LORD.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S ATTRIBUTES, THE NOW HIS WORD
[1:52:01] BEING EXPRESSED.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT BEING
[1:52:05] CALLED BY A MAN. YOU'RE NOT CALLED BY A
[1:52:08] CHURCH.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; OH, brother Samuel, so and so witnessed
[1:52:10] to me. WHATEVER MORE GOD MIGHT HAVE USED
[1:52:12] A vessel
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; and you might look and say, "That vessel
[1:52:16] is not even serving God anymore." The
[1:52:18] prophet clears that up. See, his need is
[1:52:19] not with a shock. He said, "Sometimes
[1:52:21] there's people that have the real truth.
[1:52:22] They're just carriers of it."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; True. And they've been they've been used
[1:52:26] as witnesses to and here they are
[1:52:28] they've disp HOW HOW THINK ABOUT THAT IN
[1:52:30] AFRICA when all those threw the books
[1:52:31] away all those things. Brother Samson
[1:52:32] Tay speaking of that how the trash cans
[1:52:34] were filled and everything else but when
[1:52:36] those trash cans were filled ain't it
[1:52:38] incredible God seen to it that WHERE
[1:52:40] THOSE BOOKS WERE AT THERE WERE PEOPLE
[1:52:41] WHO PICKED THEM UP IN THE FILLING
[1:52:43] STATIONS [cheering]
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT NOBODY ELSE WANTED.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; THERE WERE [screaming] PEOPLE WHO WANTED
[1:52:49] IT.
[1:52:51] THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY were
[1:52:52] after, but it was God guiding and
[1:52:53] directing them right into the place.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S BY NO THE DISCERNMENT. IT'S
[1:52:59] NOT MY THINKING. SO, WHAT YOU SEE
[1:53:01] HAPPENING ON THE PLATFORM, THAT'S THE
[1:53:03] SAME THING THAT'S HAPPENING BY THE WORD
[1:53:06] OF GOD AS IT'S BEING REVEALED. IT'S NOT
[1:53:08] US THINKING OF A POST. IT'S NOT US
[1:53:11] THINKING OF A MAN. IT'S GOD HIMSELF, HIS
[1:53:14] THOUGHTS, WHAT HE THINKS OF YOU, AND
[1:53:17] THAT'S WHAT HE'S EXPRESSING.
[1:53:21] Let that mind that was in Christ be IN
[1:53:23] YOU. LET THAT MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST BE
[1:53:24] IN YOU. SEE, IT'S NOT YOUR THINKING.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; You're not expressing your own words.
[1:53:32] You're expressing
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; His words.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; As many as received him,
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; to them gave he the power, the rights
[1:53:45] to become the sons of God.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You have the right. You have now a right
[1:53:50] that's been ministered to you. And that
[1:53:52] right itself, as you yield to that
[1:53:54] right, it'll take you to the power
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; to the authority that makes an expressed
[1:54:01] son of God.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, I want to yield.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; I want to yield.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to keep yielding. I
[1:54:11] don't want to Listen, there's no time to
[1:54:13] conflict with your thoughts. Listen,
[1:54:15] it's a time to doubt your doubts and
[1:54:16] believe God's word. That's right.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; This word is more real than the thoughts
[1:54:21] you have of your own self.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; THESE THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE, THESE
[1:54:25] THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE IS THE VERY THING
[1:54:27] THAT'LL DISPEL AND BREAK THOUGHTS. AND
[1:54:29] THESE ARE THE THOUGHTS. THIS WORD IS
[1:54:31] WHAT WILL BRING A NEW BIRTH.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT BRINGS DELIVERANCE.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A WORD THAT IS DROPPED FROM
[1:54:38] ETERNITY DOWN INTO TIME.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JESUS SAID, "NO MAN CAN COME
[1:54:44] UNTO ME EXCEPT THE FATHER WHICH HATH
[1:54:46] SENT ME. DRAW him and I will raise him
[1:54:50] up at the last day. If I be lifted up
[1:54:53] from the earth, speaking of his
[1:54:54] crucifixion, I will draw all men unto
[1:54:57] me. You see, he's drawing.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; I know it's a sad thing where the word
[1:55:03] when we hear the message indictment and
[1:55:06] how that the word was crucified. But do
[1:55:08] you realize the prophet goes on to say
[1:55:10] if you read further in that message he
[1:55:13] said now that word he said up to that
[1:55:16] time at Calvary that word had not come
[1:55:18] into effect
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; but when that happened at Calvary he's
[1:55:22] talking about back at Calvary then the
[1:55:24] word came into effect and he said now
[1:55:27] this word that's been here all these
[1:55:29] years now talking about IN HIS MINISTRY
[1:55:31] NOW that it's been rejected now that
[1:55:33] it's been crucified now it's coming into
[1:55:35] effect Amen.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD HAD TO BE REJECTED. IT HAD
[1:55:41] TO BE CRUCIFIED.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; You and I are benefactors
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; of this life.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; It's now, as the prophet said, it has
[1:55:49] now recently come into effect.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; No man cometh unto the father but by me.
[1:55:59] Let me close on this one.
[1:56:05] Everybody in here has a I'd say probably
[1:56:07] everybody maybe everybody doesn't. I
[1:56:09] understand cell phone.
[1:56:12] Most of us still have radios in our car.
[1:56:15] I think it's like somebody the other day
[1:56:16] wanted to give me a CD. They a brother
[1:56:18] sent me a thing about my daughters have
[1:56:20] just put out this CD. You want to order
[1:56:22] them for your library? I thought I don't
[1:56:24] even have CD players.
[1:56:26] [laughter]
[1:56:26] I don't have them.
[1:56:28] I don't have them. Is it on Apple Music?
[1:56:31] [laughter] I mean, uh, you know, we
[1:56:36] I could have really joshed him and
[1:56:37] teased him, but I didn't. I I was good.
[1:56:38] I was good. But, you know, within it, I
[1:56:41] mean, the the CDs, what I'm trying to
[1:56:43] say is is that even within it comes to
[1:56:45] the cell phones and the radio, there's a
[1:56:48] signal that goes out,
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; TV, all those things, the wireless, it
[1:56:53] goes out. But there's got to be
[1:56:56] something to receive the signal
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; that's being transmitted.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; See, those signals are being transmitted
[1:57:03] all around. I mean, you know, sometimes
[1:57:06] I hear people say, "Oh, Wi-Fi, it's
[1:57:08] making me feel this way and this, you
[1:57:09] know, and they're making fun of people.
[1:57:11] I just, you know, sometimes I just
[1:57:12] Anyhow, I I just, you know, there's
[1:57:14] certain things about signals and this
[1:57:16] and there's signals all through this
[1:57:17] room. It's amazing how many signals. It
[1:57:20] is absolutely amazing how many signals.
[1:57:21] I mean, think about all the
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi signals right here cuz your
[1:57:25] phone's still on. You might have put it
[1:57:26] on, turned it off. I mean, as far as
[1:57:28] vibrating this right here,
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; it's a signal that's being sent to a
[1:57:32] little box over there. And then that box
[1:57:34] carries a wire underneath and all the
[1:57:36] way back over there. But you don't see
[1:57:38] anything between here and there.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, if something
[1:57:42] goes wrong, you'll know, hey, hey, hey,
[1:57:44] somebody needs to get him a microphone.
[1:57:46] Somebody needs to get him a microphone.
[1:57:47] I can't hear. I need again microphone.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; But you don't see it, but you know it's
[1:57:53] happening.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; And this is why the prophet would speak
[1:57:57] about when the word
[1:58:00] was made flesh and when the word is made
[1:58:02] flesh, he says it like this. He was that
[1:58:06] transmitter.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth
[1:58:09] on him that sent me has an eternal life.
[1:58:12] Verily I say unto you, he that heareth
[1:58:14] my words and believeth on him that sent
[1:58:17] me hath eternal life. Now let me ask you
[1:58:19] something.
[1:58:21] That word has been went out from a
[1:58:23] transmitter. What part of that in there
[1:58:26] did it ask you to do something other
[1:58:28] than believe.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Believe
[1:58:33] the signal that's being transmitted.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:58:42] IF YOU CAN JUST BE THE STATION TO PICK
[1:58:45] that up BY SOME CONTROL INSIDE OF you by
[1:58:48] faith, it'll move you right into the
[1:58:50] cycle of God to the new birth and be
[1:58:54] born again.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; PICK IT up and it'll move you.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [laughter]
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; ALL I GOT TO DO IS GET DIALED IN
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; AND IT'LL MOVE YOU INTO THE CYCLE OF GOD
[1:59:07] RIGHT INTO THE new birth.
[1:59:09] But in there in the new birth, notice
[1:59:11] the privilege is always that warning,
[1:59:13] that little buzzer. Then you'll always
[1:59:14] have that buzzer, that that contact
[1:59:16] that's there to warn you, guide you,
[1:59:18] direct you. Why? Because his spirit of
[1:59:20] truth is sent to lead and guide you into
[1:59:22] all truth.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; What's happening? It's God fulfilling
[1:59:27] his word.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; What is it that's making that creation
[1:59:32] inside of you? It's God fulfilling that
[1:59:34] word. Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, even for every one of us
[1:59:38] that here, I believe God wants to take
[1:59:41] every heart deeper. God wants to take us
[1:59:43] deeper. It's a control. It's taking
[1:59:45] wanting to take us deeper. And there's
[1:59:47] things that if you can just recognize
[1:59:48] that it's him.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; It's what he started IN YOUR LIFE. AND
[1:59:52] YOU AND you continue to yield to him.
[1:59:54] Brother Samuel, if I can just get rid of
[1:59:55] this, if I can just get rid of this, you
[1:59:57] you have to believe his word.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have when you believe his
[2:00:02] word, you start fellowshipping with his
[2:00:04] word. You're inviting THE WORD OF GOD
[2:00:06] INTO YOUR LIFE BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD
[2:00:09] THAT WILL KILL SIN.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD THAT'LL BUILD FAITH. THE
[2:00:15] WORD, LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT CHANGES THE
[2:00:17] atmosphere
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; around your life.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; And it will move you into the cycle of
[2:00:27] the new birth. What do I have to do,
[2:00:28] brother? yield.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; You yield
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; to God's desire.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; When Samuel was told to go down to the
[2:00:40] house of Jesse,
[2:00:42] I want you to listen now.
[2:00:45] When he came to Jesse's house, I want
[2:00:48] you to watch this announcement.
[2:00:51] Samuel comes there and he says to the
[2:00:55] Lord before going, "How can I get down
[2:00:58] there and anoint David?"
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it was David. How do
[2:01:05] I get down there and anoint one of his
[2:01:06] sons? How do I do that?
[2:01:09] And you know what God said? Take a
[2:01:12] sacrifice.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; You know what this You know what that
[2:01:17] was? That was God. How God was going to
[2:01:19] come and anoint you and I
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; through a sacrifice. When Samuel came to
[2:01:24] the house, he said, "I'm come
[2:01:25] peaceibly."
[2:01:28] [laughter]
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; HE COME TO OFFER A SACRIFICE. BUT WITHIN
[2:01:32] THE SACRIFICE,
[2:01:36] there was a mystery.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; There was an event that was to take
[2:01:41] place.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; It would be a secret anointing.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; There you go. But it would be openly
[2:01:46] manifest.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; It would not be a public show, but it
[2:01:50] would show itself publicly later.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? [applause]
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD START OUT IN INFASY AND THROUGH
[2:01:57] THAT ANOINTING, IT would bring forth a
[2:01:59] maturity.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD IT DO? IT WOULD IT WOULD
[2:02:03] BRING FORTH THE KING THAT WAS anointed
[2:02:06] on the inside till he sits on the
[2:02:08] throne.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED AND
[2:02:11] REVELATIONS 3 SAID we shall sit with him
[2:02:12] in HIS THRONE.
[2:02:14] SO THE ANOINTING IS WHAT MAKES YOU AWARE
[2:02:17] WHO YOU ARE AND BRINGS YOU INTO YOUR
[2:02:20] PLACE. And then it's Christ maturing,
[2:02:22] moving in your life to bring you into
[2:02:24] that position.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Here's here's Samuel. He's ready.
[2:02:32] Remember, here's a prophet. He's going
[2:02:35] with the word of the Lord.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; He's going with one of God's attributes.
[2:02:41] I'm going to anoint one of Jesse's sons.
[2:02:44] And when he sees the first one come,
[2:02:46] this guy's a great strapping guy.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; He looks perfect, man.
[2:02:51] And Samuel went,
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; God said, "Uh-uh.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; NO, DON'T ANOINT HIM.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; I've not chosen him."
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; THEY BROUGHT THE NEXT ONE.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; GOD ALLOWED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO PASS
[2:03:08] before Samuel.
[2:03:11] DAVID WASN'T EVEN IN the house.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A COMPLEX. HIS
[2:03:18] [screaming] FATHER DIDN'T EVEN INVITE
[2:03:19] HIM INTO THE HOUSE.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; This is an important matter, son. A
[2:03:26] king's going to be anointed. You just
[2:03:27] stay out there with the sheep.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; He wasn't summoned.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SENT SAMUEL
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; WITH A MESSAGE
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; TO ANOINT A KING. [screaming]
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; AND HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE SCENE
[2:03:43] WHEN THE SEALS WERE BEING PREACHED,
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S HERE [screaming] NOW.
[2:03:49] [applause and cheering]
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PEOPLE ON EARTH BEING
[2:03:52] ASSEMBLED BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; IF THE SAME ANGEL OF THE LORD THAT RAN
[2:03:59] BACK ISRAEL TO HER HOMELAND TO MAKE HER
[2:04:02] READY,
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; get her in place so he could reveal
[2:04:05] himself. the same angel of the Lord
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; bringing people,
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; drawing our hearts, dealing with your
[2:04:11] life,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; that you're more than just an ordinary
[2:04:14] young person.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Sure, you walk with the same flesh, have
[2:04:17] the same battles, but you're more than
[2:04:19] just ordinary.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; There's something different about your
[2:04:23] life.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you something.
[2:04:27] YouTube can't explain it.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Google can't explain it.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; GAMES CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; COLLEGE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. A PROFESSOR
[2:04:36] DOES NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY. A DEGREE DOES
[2:04:39] NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY OF YOUR LIFE. GOD
[2:04:41] [screaming] HOLDS THE MYSTERY OF YOUR
[2:04:43] LIFE. [applause and cheering]
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; And here was David. He comes in
[2:04:52] ruddy.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Little guy.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Don't look like a king.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; But this is why God told Samuel, "Don't
[2:05:02] you look on the outside. That's right.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you look on the countenance.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Don't you look based on this cuz that's
[2:05:10] not my choice.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's not how I choose.
[2:05:15] I choose by that which is of my own
[2:05:18] heart.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, you mean to tell me
[2:05:26] God didn't know all the failures that
[2:05:28] David would have? Remember, the Holy
[2:05:30] Ghost wasn't given in that time like it
[2:05:32] is now. But even through all of that,
[2:05:35] why was David a man after God's own
[2:05:37] heart? Because David would repent.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; He didn't try to make excuses for his
[2:05:44] shortcomings.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Now, he needed help. THE WORD HAD TO
[2:05:48] DEAL WITH HIS LIFE. REMEMBER, CUZ MAN,
[2:05:50] he would not have come out and said,
[2:05:51] "KILL THAT MAN."
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAD TO OPEN HIM UP AND GET HIM
[2:05:56] LINED RIGHT UP JUST RIGHT. AND DAVID
[2:05:58] SAID, "That man."
[2:06:02] About that time, the word just dropped
[2:06:04] it down and said, "You the man."
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; You the man.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID DAVID DO? HE REPENTED.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SAID, "WELL, IF MY DAD HADN'T
[2:06:13] BEEN LIKE THIS, IF THIS HADN'T BEEN LIKE
[2:06:15] THIS, IF SHE HADN'T BEEN WALKING around
[2:06:16] up there LIKE THAT, IF THIS, IF THIS, IF
[2:06:18] THIS." NO, HE REPENTED BECAUSE THERE
[2:06:20] WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY WAY BACK WITH
[2:06:22] EXCUSES.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; It had to be full repentance.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; And David, God already knew that. That's
[2:06:29] why God already knew all your
[2:06:30] shortcomings. That's right.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; He knew all my shortcomings. He knew all
[2:06:33] your failures, knew all of mine.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; God didn't choose you based on that.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz if that choice had been on that, you
[2:06:41] would have been standing last on the
[2:06:43] kickball line.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; And you can go on their team by default.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; He poured that anointing oil. And I love
[2:06:55] how the prophet said it. He said,
[2:06:57] notice, he just didn't drop it. He said,
[2:06:59] 'When God pours the Holy Ghost on, he
[2:07:01] pours it on.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I stop here.
[2:07:10] Whose desire was it
[2:07:13] for David to be king? Was that David's
[2:07:16] desire
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; or God's desire?
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Whose desire is it for you to serve God?
[2:07:23] Yours or God's?
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; God's. That's right.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You're not
[2:07:31] a Christian by your desire."
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; You're a Christian by God's desire.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; And that desire, that word will keep
[2:07:41] moving on a life until eventually what?
[2:07:43] Full surrender.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; And then even with full surrender, he's
[2:07:47] what's he doing? Molding us and shaping
[2:07:50] us into that place.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:57] Hallelujah.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Saul. Saul.
[2:08:01] How did you know that David was anointed
[2:08:03] king?
[2:08:07] As a Bible reader, you know, it came to
[2:08:10] about the second time, second or third
[2:08:13] time of their interaction. Remember, he
[2:08:16] didn't cut he didn't cut the the the
[2:08:18] skirt this time.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But it was after after
[2:08:21] this these times that Saul realized,
[2:08:26] you're my neighbor.
[2:08:28] You're the one that God's anointed.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; You know why? His behavior.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; That's so true.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't because of his giant killing
[2:08:37] skills.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; It was his behavior.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; His character is what separated him. He
[2:08:45] was behaving like a king before he was
[2:08:47] ever on the throne. YES. [screaming]
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE ANOINTING OF THE
[2:08:53] HOLY SPIRIT DOES UPON YOUR LIFE. LISTEN
[2:08:56] TO ME NOW. IT WILL MOVE UPON YOUR LIFE
[2:08:58] TO WHERE YOU BEGIN TO CALL THOSE THINGS
[2:09:00] THAT ARE NOT AS THOUGH THEY ARE. WHEN
[2:09:02] THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVES UPON YOUR LIFE AND
[2:09:04] SAYS LIKE I READ THAT QUOTE, I'LL SEAL
[2:09:07] YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. I BELIEVE IN
[2:09:08] LORD.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN HE SEALS YOU WITH THE HOLY
[2:09:12] SPIRIT, I'M TAKING YOU IN RAPTURE. I
[2:09:14] BELIEVE IT LORD.
[2:09:17] YES.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; It's God's desire
[2:09:24] breaking over our lives
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; and it's us yielding.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; And I say to you friends, this yielding
[2:09:33] is not something that happens
[2:09:36] at 11:00 on Sunday mornings
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; or 7 p.m. on Thursdays.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; But the shielding
[2:09:44] is every moment of your life. Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Right here in the service right here
[2:09:49] this morning.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; There can be a beginning. It can be a
[2:09:52] start for whatever the need is in your
[2:09:54] life. Whether it's the Holy Spirit,
[2:09:56] deliverance,
[2:09:57] something of besetting sin, a weight
[2:09:59] upon your life, healing, whatever it is.
[2:10:02] Remember,
[2:10:04] see that image in front of you. And I
[2:10:06] can't just say see that image. But what
[2:10:08] has the word done?
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; The word has not shown you any negative
[2:10:11] image.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? Amen.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; The word has not shown you any negative
[2:10:17] image. Oh, brother Samuel, today when
[2:10:20] you mentioned that about Judas, is that
[2:10:21] all you got out of the service?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; You let the devil rob you?
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; You let the devil robbed you? Oh,
[2:10:28] brother Samuel, if you had mentioned
[2:10:29] them 10 spies, you let the devil rob
[2:10:31] you. Do you Let me ask YOU A QUESTION.
[2:10:34] GOD DIDN'T EVEN TELL THE 10 SPIES,
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; what the devil's tried to tell you.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; God has never done that through the
[2:10:43] scripture. He never even ran Esau down.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; He gave him opportunities.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS SET BEFORE US.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; YES, it is.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; And it's time just to say it's for me.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; It's for me.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; This is not the ideas of a man, not the
[2:11:01] impressions of a man, and let me study
[2:11:03] something to make the people feel good.
[2:11:05] No, no, no.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; This is the word of God.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that'll bring
[2:11:10] change in life is the word of God. And
[2:11:13] sometimes before change can come, the
[2:11:16] conditions around have to be changed.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; God drives back the darkness in order so
[2:11:24] the seed can receive light.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; You're light in the Lord, right? You're
[2:11:31] light in the Lord. You become light in
[2:11:33] the Lord. Let your light shine on your
[2:11:35] loved ones.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Let the light of God shine through. Let
[2:11:38] the light Let it let let it shine
[2:11:39] through. Oh, brother Sam, I can't wait
[2:11:41] tonight. I can't wait till I get done
[2:11:42] with this. I'm gonna sit down and give
[2:11:43] him a Bible study. Don't don't don't.
[2:11:44] That's called frustration.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; They don't need that right now. They
[2:11:48] need you to BE THE WORD.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; SHINE THE LIGHT. SHOW THEM JESUS IN
[2:11:53] FLESH.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T NEED THAT. THEY NEED THAT.
[2:11:56] THERE'LL BE A TIME FOR THAT. BUT NOW'S
[2:11:57] NOT THE TIME.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; Show them what it means for the word to
[2:12:01] be made flesh.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I don't feel that ex
[2:12:06] spiritual. You don't have to feel
[2:12:07] spiritual to tell your son or daughter
[2:12:09] you love them. Amen.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel spiritual to tell
[2:12:14] them you care about him.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel spiritual. You
[2:12:18] don't have to send out. You don't have
[2:12:19] to quote a quote. You don't have to put
[2:12:21] a scripture. Let me JUST TELL YOU, YOU
[2:12:22] HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING THIS MORNING. YOU
[2:12:24] ARE HIS THOUGHTS.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES FOR WORDS TO BE SAID.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; But this is the hour for words to be
[2:12:34] lived. Amen.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Let your light shine.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, we may not talk
[2:12:43] about nothing in the weather. Then be
[2:12:45] Jesus talking about the weather.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAMUEL, MY MY KIDS ALL THEY want
[2:12:52] to talk about if we get together today
[2:12:54] was Ohio State and that team up north.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Then you know what? Be Jesus.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; There you go. That's so good. And just
[2:13:03] so if you need a little help on that
[2:13:05] right there, I think I happen to see a
[2:13:07] little bit of a clip. Ohio State one.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; That may be all you need to know.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; And just GIVE A LITTLE BIT. TALK TO THEM
[2:13:17] A LITTLE BIT AND LET THEM TALK.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Let them talk
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; and you talk along with them. Oh,
[2:13:25] brother Samuel, that's so carnal. See,
[2:13:26] that very thing can keep you from them.
[2:13:29] That's right.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Your carnality didn't keep Jesus from
[2:13:33] you.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Your carnality, my carnality didn't keep
[2:13:37] him back from me.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Matthew's carnality did not keep him
[2:13:41] from going to Matthew's house.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; But he went there
[2:13:46] and the light was shown.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's not us just
[2:13:52] hearing God's thoughts. We are his
[2:13:54] thoughts. Hallelujah.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; Let him take you into that cycle. Hear
[2:14:04] that transmission. Let him take you
[2:14:05] there.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father.
[2:14:09] [sighs]
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, dear God.
[2:14:15] How it just Lord, it means so much just
[2:14:18] to our hearts. our hearts just
[2:14:22] Lord as I've just just sat Lord for
[2:14:24] weeks on in and just you know just
[2:14:26] pondering
[2:14:30] just that just there within future home
[2:14:32] and just that moment just going through
[2:14:34] there just listening to it and I just
[2:14:36] just stopped it Lord and just begin to
[2:14:39] thank you just Lord how you so impress
[2:14:43] your word upon our hearts oh God this
[2:14:47] this word.
[2:14:50] It's not by chance that we're gathered
[2:14:53] here this morning.
[2:14:56] The word that you've sent, Lord,
[2:15:00] it's not the thoughts of a man.
[2:15:07] It's your thoughts, Lord.
[2:15:11] And that's something, Lord, that
[2:15:14] we're resting in that.
[2:15:17] We're resting in the word of God.
[2:15:20] What a rest it brings to us.
[2:15:24] Lord, I pray if if there's one here or
[2:15:27] the sound of my voice or that would hear
[2:15:29] this that
[2:15:32] if they've not made that choice yet, I
[2:15:35] pray God,
[2:15:36] may they may they see
[2:15:40] you and may they see what they can be.
[2:15:46] And may Lord when they see what they can
[2:15:48] be, may they may they see
[2:15:51] that bloodline that's right between
[2:15:55] that can take care of all the unbelief.
[2:15:59] It can take care of fear. It can take
[2:16:01] care of doubt. That bloodline that can
[2:16:04] take care of all unbelief.
[2:16:07] That blood that's been made available
[2:16:11] as the spirit of God would anoint us,
[2:16:13] Lord, to be able to see
[2:16:16] It's already done.
[2:16:19] Lord, there's not one person here or
[2:16:21] should you, Terry, next week that
[2:16:24] even in surrendering their life to God,
[2:16:28] you don't have to go to Calvary one more
[2:16:30] time,
[2:16:32] you already went
[2:16:35] to Calvary
[2:16:38] for us.
[2:16:40] You already went to Calvary for that one
[2:16:42] that
[2:16:44] maybe doesn't even know about you this
[2:16:46] morning. You went for them.
[2:16:53] But Lord, in that season, in that
[2:16:55] moment, how you begin to deal with the
[2:16:58] hard and life to
[2:17:01] bring it to yourself. I love how your
[2:17:04] prophet said that in future home.
[2:17:07] How he led us to himself.
[2:17:11] You've led us by your word, Lord.
[2:17:15] Your spirit, Lord, calling upon our
[2:17:17] hearts and drawing us
[2:17:20] through justification, sanctification,
[2:17:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; We're not our work. It's not our work.
[2:17:30] We're your workmanship.
[2:17:33] Now, Lord, I pray here this morning.
[2:17:37] Lord, maybe there's sons and daughters
[2:17:39] here this morning that
[2:17:43] they just need that atmosphere
[2:17:46] around their life to be dissolved, to be
[2:17:48] changed. May they just take your word
[2:17:51] this morning.
[2:17:53] Allow the word to
[2:17:56] change the atmosphere. Drive away that
[2:17:58] unbelief.
[2:18:00] Drive away that gloom. Drive away that
[2:18:02] doubt
[2:18:04] that the light can shine down upon that
[2:18:08] seed.
[2:18:10] May you change the atmospheres and
[2:18:12] lives. Lord,
[2:18:14] may you, Lord, coming into lives that
[2:18:18] dear God, where that darkness has been
[2:18:20] drove back, clouds have been broken
[2:18:22] back, may the light of God shine in the
[2:18:26] depths of their life.
[2:18:28] And I'm asking you, Father,
[2:18:31] if there's anything that would be
[2:18:32] hindering
[2:18:34] in any heart or any life,
[2:18:39] would you by your light of your word,
[2:18:42] whereby all things stand naked and open
[2:18:44] before you with whom we have to do,
[2:18:46] would you just shine your light into our
[2:18:48] life?
[2:18:50] If it's something that's
[2:18:52] keeping us back from full surrender,
[2:18:55] would you just shine your light into our
[2:18:57] life, Lord?
[2:19:00] Because we want to side with the word of
[2:19:03] God.
[2:19:05] Lord Jesus, if there's something in our
[2:19:08] heart or our life, if there's something
[2:19:10] maybe that's become harbored, maybe it's
[2:19:13] a feeling, maybe it's a grudge, maybe
[2:19:15] it's a resentment,
[2:19:17] Lord God,
[2:19:19] may you shine the light.
[2:19:22] And father,
[2:19:25] for we don't want anything in our lives
[2:19:28] that would keep us
[2:19:30] from being more like you,
[2:19:34] Lord. Right here this morning,
[2:19:37] I give this congregation, myself, Lord,
[2:19:39] into your hands.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Lord God, it's your word that has been
[2:19:46] spoken.
[2:19:48] Father, you have transmitted
[2:19:51] of your life, of your word.
[2:19:55] Now, Lord God,
[2:19:57] the greatest request is we just want to
[2:19:58] be the station to pick that up.
[2:20:02] Whether it's for the new birth, for
[2:20:05] healing,
[2:20:07] oh God, maybe it's a financial need.
[2:20:12] Father, you're still Jehovah Gyra.
[2:20:15] You're Jehovah Rafa. Maybe there's a
[2:20:17] great battle at hand. God, I pray may
[2:20:21] you just move down, Lord, for every
[2:20:24] need.
[2:20:25] And Lord, knowing that law of life is
[2:20:27] within us, may we just surrender like
[2:20:29] that little fish. That fish don't try to
[2:20:32] swim. It just surrenders.
[2:20:37] Oh, God granted.
[2:20:40] No wonder your prophet could say,
[2:20:43] "Just let God take you to the Holy
[2:20:46] Ghost.
[2:20:47] Just let God take you to your healing.
[2:20:50] Let God take you
[2:20:52] to whatever you have need of. Just
[2:20:55] yield. Say, "Lord, I yield."
[2:20:58] The universal sign of surrender
[2:21:00] is yes with our hands up.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; But God can see with our heart. Lord, I
[2:21:06] surrender. [music] I surrender, Lord.
[2:21:10] Take me, Lord. Like David after the
[2:21:12] anointing had come upon his life. Take
[2:21:15] me Lord.
[2:21:19] Lord, he had to go through many hard
[2:21:21] trials.
[2:21:22] He had to go through many
[2:21:25] things, Lord, where he was hunted down
[2:21:27] like a dog.
[2:21:30] But everything from
[2:21:33] before the anointing,
[2:21:35] then after the anointing was all
[2:21:40] character
[2:21:42] preparation
[2:21:43] for the throne.
[2:21:46] Even that which Abigail would come out
[2:21:48] and express to him, David, you don't
[2:21:51] want any regrets.
[2:21:54] Oh God, grant it this morning, Lord.
[2:21:59] Grant it, Lord. Take us, Lord. Take me
[2:22:01] deeper.
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Take us deeper, Lord. Deeper than we've
[2:22:05] ever been before, Lord. Grant it, Lord
[2:22:08] God.
[2:22:10] As a station picking up, Lord, this
[2:22:13] signal of your word.
[2:22:15] Grant it, Lord. I pray. Bring cleansing
[2:22:18] into lives, Lord. The Holy Spirit, Lord.
[2:22:20] May every heart be so focused, Lord, on
[2:22:22] you, the transmitter.
[2:22:25] Grant it, Lord God. Whatever their need
[2:22:27] is, Lord, you're the one who gives the
[2:22:29] Holy Ghost. You're the one that healing
[2:22:31] comes through,
[2:22:34] we're focused on you, Lord,
[2:22:38] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:50] bring me to you,
[2:22:53] Lord. [music]
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Fill me [singing] with your thoughts
[2:22:59] [music] and make it all brand new.
[2:23:03] [singing] Change my life.
[2:23:09] Let me live in all [music] that's true.

[2:23:27] completely to [music] you.
[2:23:30] [singing] Oh,
[2:23:32] fill me with your thoughts [music]
[2:23:37] and make [singing] it all brand new.
[2:23:41] Change my heart.
[2:23:45] Lord, let me [singing] live [music] in
[2:23:47] all that's true.
[2:23:51] [singing] Oh, I just want to think like
[2:23:55] you. [music]
[2:23:59] Oh, [singing] and take
[2:24:02] me
[2:24:04] and [music and singing] mold
[2:24:06] me.
[2:24:08] Lord, teach me [music] to be still.
[2:24:13] [singing]
[2:24:17] Lord, lead [singing]
[2:24:20] me
[2:24:22] and guide [music]
[2:24:24] me [singing]
[2:24:26] or show me your perfect
[2:24:32] will.
[2:24:34] Oh [singing] Lord, I give [music] my
[2:24:36] mind
[2:24:39] completely [music and singing] to you.
[2:24:43] Oh,
[2:24:45] fill me [singing] with your thoughts
[2:24:48] [music]
[2:24:49] and make it all brand new. Change my
[2:24:53] [music] life.
[2:24:57] Lord, let me [singing] live in all
[2:25:00] that's true.
[2:25:02] [music]
[2:25:04] But [singing] I just want to think like
[2:25:07] you take me and won't be long.
[2:25:11] Oh, [singing and music]
[2:25:12] take
[2:25:14] me
[2:25:16] and [music]
[2:25:18] me,
[2:25:20] Lord. Teach [singing]
[2:25:22] me to [music]
[2:25:26] teach me to be still and lead
[2:25:30] [music and singing]

[2:25:33] and guide
[2:25:36] me.

[2:25:43] will.
[2:25:44] Oh, I give my life.
[2:25:50] lead to you.

[2:26:38] Change [music] my life.
[2:26:42] Lord, let me live [singing] and know
[2:26:45] that's true.

[2:42:04] Lord Jesus.
[2:42:06] Oh, Father, Lord Jesus, how grateful we
