[30:23] amen praise the Lord
[30:26] let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[30:28] before return to the scripture tonight
[30:31] Heavenly Father we come approaching you
[30:35] now at this point of the service Lord
[30:38] Father we've heard the worship of the
[30:42] people growing up felt the presence of
[30:45] God here in our Miss now Lord as youth
[30:49] the way is repaired we asked for you to
[30:52] come open the Word of Life to a story I
[30:56] pray you'll anoint me father as I stand
[30:59] in this place to bring glory to You Lord
[31:03] to be a help to your people we asked
[31:07] these things in the name of the Lord
[31:08] Jesus Christ to the glory of God amen
[31:16] why are standing turn with me in your
[31:20] Bibles to 2nd Peter chapter 1
[31:28] what I want to speak on tonight is
[31:31] here--he him
[31:39] verse 10 second Peter 1 verse 10
[31:44] wherefore the rather brother give
[31:45] diligence to make your calling and
[31:47] election sure means steadfast for if you
[31:51] do these things you shall never fall
[31:53] down to verse 16 for we have not
[31:58] followed cunning devised fables when we
[32:01] made known unto you the power and coming
[32:04] of our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[32:07] eyewitnesses of his majesty for he
[32:11] received from God the Father honour and
[32:13] glory
[32:13] when there came such a voice to him from
[32:16] the excellent glory this is my beloved
[32:21] Son in whom I am well pleased
[32:23] amen you may be seated
[32:30] how do we know that God is with us it's
[32:34] not by our numbers
[32:36] God has met with sometimes he meets with
[32:42] great numbers sometimes meets with small
[32:44] numbers one time he met with 500 another
[32:50] time with 70 another time with 12 times
[32:53] with three and he's met with one so it's
[32:58] not it's not the number that determines
[33:01] it but it's the attitude of the people
[33:05] you take an egg from some foul chicken
[33:13] or a duck or whatever and if you put it
[33:16] in an incubator it it'll hatch that egg
[33:21] because it's the atmosphere and if he
[33:26] can get us into one Accord that's what
[33:29] he's looking forward to get us into one
[33:30] Accord in one line then it'll create an
[33:34] atmosphere to where if there were any
[33:38] lost in ability they get saved before
[33:41] they left if there was any sick they get
[33:44] healed before they left all we got to do
[33:47] is have the right atmosphere created and
[33:50] we could have another Pentecost in
[33:58] Matthew 17:5 is the scripture that Peter
[34:04] is referring to this account that
[34:07] Matthew gives
[34:11] in 1705 he says while he yet spake
[34:14] behold a bright cloud overshadowed them
[34:17] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[34:19] which said this is my beloved Son in
[34:21] whom I'm well pleased hear ye him he was
[34:28] wounded for our transgressions he was
[34:30] bruised for our iniquity the
[34:33] chastisement of our peace were upon him
[34:34] and by His stripes we were healed it's
[34:38] past tense it's already done we're not
[34:43] waiting for God to do something more
[34:45] he's already done it it's the finished
[34:47] work
[34:51] and this the the message that God sent
[34:56] by this endtime messenger was a finished
[34:57] work - we're not we're not looking for
[35:03] that he needs to come back to finish
[35:06] anything because that would be against
[35:09] the scripture for the scripture said
[35:11] when he began to sound the mystery of
[35:14] God would be finished yes
[35:17] so it's done paid for it's finished it's
[35:22] all complete
[35:24] he died at Calvary for every sin that
[35:28] would ever be committed
[35:30] wherever was committed it was forgiven
[35:34] on the basis of his blood he knows all
[35:39] things he knew every he knew every word
[35:45] you would ever speak he knew every step
[35:48] you would ever take he knew every path
[35:51] you would ever follow
[35:52] he knew what time that he would call you
[35:56] he knew when you would recognize the
[36:00] call he knew when the father would draw
[36:03] you here you him it won't do you any
[36:11] good though until you accept it it's got
[36:15] to become your personal property your
[36:18] it's got to be based on your personal
[36:20] faith Christ has already done it for you
[36:25] here um
[36:29] the RAM said no man ever sought God at
[36:32] anytime it was always God seeking after
[36:37] man he said it wasn't Adam in the garden
[36:40] saying Father who art where are you but
[36:44] it was God going through the garden
[36:46] saying Adam who art thou and this
[36:53] brother branham said are to settle it
[36:56] that if there's a question your mind he
[37:00] said this ought to settle it Jesus said
[37:02] no man could come to me except the
[37:04] father draws him first you want to know
[37:07] whether you're called did the father
[37:10] draw you what what drew you here what
[37:14] drew you to him what drew you to this
[37:18] endtime message it was the father every
[37:25] time the devil comes and tries to say
[37:26] well you know what you're not one of
[37:28] them you're not going to make it you're
[37:32] gonna be one of ones that's left behind
[37:35] you're gonna be one of the ones that's
[37:37] calling around all panic because you
[37:39] can't get ahold of nobody you can say no
[37:46] the father drawled me he brought me to
[37:50] this I didn't bring myself to this
[37:53] [Music]
[37:55] because the nature of man is always to
[37:58] go the other way the nature of man is to
[38:02] run the nature of man is darkness but he
[38:09] is liked and brother branham said when
[38:14] you get saved he said there's a little
[38:16] light inside you by the size of a button
[38:19] amen and he said then that as you begin
[38:23] to mature that begins to grow but he
[38:26] says that's a little light then that's
[38:29] shining out of the darkness the wonder
[38:33] jesus said you are a lot you are the
[38:36] light of the world
[38:39] God by his foreknowledge
[38:43] he's omnipresent means he's everywhere
[38:46] fills all space he's omnipotent which
[38:52] means he knows everything he's
[38:58] omnipotent which means he's able to do
[39:01] anything
[39:03] so he's everywhere he's able to do
[39:06] anything and he knows everything and
[39:13] it's because of that that he could say
[39:16] before Jacob marisol was even born that
[39:19] I hate Esau and love Jacob because he
[39:23] knew already what kind of a man that
[39:26] Esau would be he already knew what would
[39:30] be in Esau's art he already knew what
[39:33] would be Esau stinking he already knew
[39:35] what would be Esau choices he knew
[39:40] everything he knew every word that he
[39:42] saw whatever speak he knew every thought
[39:44] that he saw would ever think and he knew
[39:47] every he knew what would be on Jacobs
[39:49] heart he knew what Jacob would see
[39:51] captor
[39:52] he knew what Jacobs choices would be God
[39:57] knowing all he knew you he knew
[40:02] everything you would ever do everything
[40:04] ever be he knew every he not only knew
[40:08] all the good things you would ever do
[40:10] but he knew all the bad things you would
[40:13] ever do I like on that song when he was
[40:16] on the cross I was on his mind said he
[40:19] knew me yet he loved me he knew
[40:23] everything I would ever be know every
[40:25] mistake I'd ever make every fault I ever
[40:28] had
[40:28] he knew all of that he knew all the
[40:30] wrongs that I would ever do yet he loved
[40:33] me why did he love me because I belong
[40:37] to you
[40:39] all I needed to be was I needed to be
[40:41] born again he is the inexhaustible
[40:49] fountain of life I've heard people say
[40:57] well look at all the blessings God has
[41:00] blessed me with look at what all God has
[41:02] given me let me tell you something
[41:04] material things is not a sign of God's
[41:07] blessings it's not a sign that God is
[41:11] with you David said that had he
[41:14] considered the wicked he spread forth
[41:16] like a great bay tree God said have you
[41:20] considered his end
[41:23] have you considered his in there are
[41:29] there are people that possess a lot of
[41:32] material things in this life and yet
[41:34] they still haven't found what they're
[41:37] searching for I would rather be making
[41:43] my investments over there than making my
[41:46] investments here it's like that story
[41:50] brother Branham talks about where he
[41:51] went and saw that that one rancher and
[41:54] he said took him out and he showed him
[41:58] his great stretch of Valley in their
[42:00] leases everywhere as far as you can see
[42:02] said I owned it he took him to the town
[42:06] he said everything in this town you see
[42:08] the bait there I own it brother Branham
[42:12] says how much do you own up there
[42:16] the closest that's that's where we want
[42:19] our treasure to be because the Bible
[42:22] says where your treasure is there will
[42:26] your heart be also I don't I don't look
[42:29] for these I don't want to own one thing
[42:32] I can't leave behind the song says amen
[42:39] some people think maybe that God
[42:45] couldn't want them that is but it's not
[42:51] based upon your works it's based upon
[42:54] the grace of God by grace ye are saved
[43:01] brother Branham talks about when he went
[43:04] into a little Museum in Tennessee and he
[43:09] says he saw there an analysis of the
[43:11] human body you remember and it said that
[43:14] that this body when it was all down to
[43:18] what it was made of was worth about 84
[43:21] cents and he says and people are go out
[43:25] and they'll put $100 fur coat which
[43:28] would be more than $100 today on an 80
[43:31] on 84 cents a $50 hat on 84 cents and he
[43:37] said why he was standing there thinking
[43:39] on that things there was two men
[43:40] standing there and the one man said the
[43:43] other said well you know what we're not
[43:45] worth very much are we brother Branham
[43:48] said no you're not he spoke to him said
[43:52] no you're not worth very much but your
[43:54] soul is worth 10 million well this body
[44:04] ain't worth much but this body is not
[44:07] what's going to inherit the kingdom it's
[44:13] not it's not flesh and blood
[44:18] you know to believe the Bible you have
[44:21] to believe in election throughout the
[44:25] Bible it talks about the elect lady and
[44:29] it speaks about election and God you
[44:34] know
[44:35] he elected us by foreknowledge and I'm
[44:39] thankful for the election of God I'm
[44:43] thankful that it's not based upon the
[44:46] good I could do and friends I don't want
[44:50] to stand in the judgment where the basis
[44:53] is the good you've done versus the evil
[44:56] you've done
[44:57] I don't want justice brother Adam said
[45:03] he lives you represented justice
[45:07] they sent army out after Elijah and he
[45:10] said if I be a man of God let the fire
[45:12] come down out of heaven and consume you
[45:14] and fire fell down and consumed them the
[45:17] King thought well maybe that was just a
[45:20] fluke so he sent out another army to go
[45:24] get Elijah and Elisha said if I be a man
[45:26] of God let fire come down out of heaven
[45:28] and consumed in fire consumed that was
[45:30] God's justice I don't want I don't plead
[45:33] for God's justice because what I deserve
[45:36] by his justice what we deserve we
[45:38] deserve hell but the lamb was worthy
[45:46] it's not we don't look at her selves one
[45:49] man told brother Branham he said I don't
[45:52] feel like I'm worthy he said I don't
[45:54] feel like I've been trying he said to
[45:57] get the Holy Ghost but I don't feel like
[45:59] I'm worthy he said I look at myself and
[46:02] I'm not worthy brother Adam said it's
[46:04] not yourself you need to look at because
[46:07] if you're looking at yourself you're not
[46:09] worthy but what we look on is our
[46:11] sacrifice which is worthy and if the
[46:15] sacrifice is worthy then you're worthy
[46:22] think about what Christ as a man Jesus
[46:27] had a decision to make
[46:29] would he you know Jesus a man would have
[46:33] loved to have stayed with his disciples
[46:38] but he had a decision to make and
[46:41] friends he went to the cross for you
[46:44] see I already knew that but how do you
[46:47] really know it he went for you in other
[46:50] words he felt you were worth it you were
[46:55] worth dying for God does the calling he
[47:08] does the choosing he does the elect me
[47:11] Jiri him you know people a lot of times
[47:23] the first come to the Lord one of the
[47:26] things that that devil fights them over
[47:28] is whether they're going to make it or
[47:30] not and you know I've seen people come
[47:34] to the Lord and then the whole time the
[47:36] devil tell them you're just gonna
[47:38] disappoint everybody because there's
[47:41] nothing nothing's happened to you you
[47:42] ain't changed a bit but I'll tell you
[47:45] something friends it isn't the drastic
[47:49] that we look for it's two little things
[47:54] the drastic will come but God changed
[47:59] this one little thing at a time
[48:02] he first changes your heart changes your
[48:09] desire God didn't come down and say look
[48:12] stop wearing this and stop doing that
[48:15] and stop doing this and throw this away
[48:17] and throw that away know what he does is
[48:19] he comes down and changes your desire
[48:21] and you stop doing those things and you
[48:24] throw away the wrong things why it's not
[48:27] because it's a law but it's because you
[48:31] love him
[48:32] because something in you has come alive
[48:36] and something is following you something
[48:40] keeps calling you and it's not you it's
[48:45] Christ in you that does the things dogs
[48:55] got it all in control you realize in
[48:58] your life nothing can go wrong you say
[49:05] well I've had a lot of things go wrong
[49:06] in my life but look at the whole scope
[49:11] of the big picture where are you at
[49:13] today you're not going to go wrong amen
[49:19] when he's got it in control then you
[49:22] can't go wrong and and this word says
[49:27] that all things work together for the
[49:30] good of them that love the Lord that are
[49:32] the called according to his purpose we
[49:36] are called according to his purpose
[49:39] therefore everything is going to work
[49:42] together for your good because the
[49:45] friends why are you here tonight you're
[49:47] not here because of some law or some
[49:50] fear that you'll go to heaven so you're
[49:53] not here you come here because you love
[49:56] the Lord you want to worship Him and you
[49:59] want to hear from him that's why you
[50:03] come you come to hear him that ought of
[50:14] resolve doubts closed look when God was
[50:25] getting ready to take Elijah off the
[50:26] scene
[50:28] the other band said there might have
[50:29] been some of the the profits down in the
[50:33] school of profits they might have been
[50:35] some of them thinking I'll take a
[50:37] largest place God's getting ready to
[50:39] take him out take his place
[50:41] I'll wear his robe when he's done with
[50:42] it but God didn't choose out of the
[50:47] school of the prophets and said he went
[50:50] out and chose a young man that was
[50:52] plowing in the field to take care of his
[50:57] mother and father and he chose God
[50:59] already knew before the world began that
[51:02] it was going to be either Elijah was ill
[51:05] he was going to call to take up in
[51:08] Elijah's stand and God knew that look we
[51:16] have had so many dear loved ones and
[51:19] Christians and soldiers fellow soldiers
[51:21] that have went on to be with the Lord
[51:23] and there's been many that maybe you
[51:26] never and I never even personally know
[51:28] but they knew this endtime message
[51:31] they've lived their life and they've
[51:33] lived their time and now they've went on
[51:35] but God knew who would follow up in
[51:38] their footsteps he knew it would be you
[51:40] because you were the ones he chose and
[51:46] you know what when he chose you you come
[51:49] in the season that he is four ordained
[51:53] for you to come Ian he phone ain't you
[51:57] for this age I don't know if I can make
[52:01] it look he's followed age you for this
[52:04] age you can go make it because why
[52:07] because there has to be overcomers from
[52:11] this age any or date you to be an
[52:17] overcomer earlier there were over comers
[52:24] in every age
[52:29] we go through things because
[52:33] brother Brennan said gob couldn't save
[52:35] you today pull you through a pipe and
[52:36] bring you out on the other end and say
[52:38] to the overcomer
[52:40] because he said you wouldn't have
[52:42] overcome anything you're not in a bubble
[52:45] once you receive the Holy Ghost that's
[52:48] that that's the teacher that's your
[52:51] instructor but you're not in a bubble
[52:55] we're actually in a flesh that's still
[52:58] in contact through the five senses to
[53:00] this world unfortunately but God knew
[53:11] you before the world was ever formed
[53:21] lebreton said you're not saved by your
[53:24] works it's by grace you're saved it's a
[53:26] gift of God Jesus said no man can come
[53:30] to me except the father draws him first
[53:33] all that come to me then they are God's
[53:37] love gifts to Christ you're not yours
[53:40] but you belong to Christ the father has
[53:43] draws you out of your life of sin and
[53:45] giving you to Christ and Christ sent the
[53:48] Holy Spirit to tutor you or to raise you
[53:52] to believe him and brought down his
[53:55] schoolbooks amen
[53:58] notice that I'm so glad he said the law
[54:02] can't save you
[54:03] here you him he's the only one that has
[54:07] the salvation he's the only one that can
[54:10] give you life he's the only one that can
[54:12] give you healing he's the only one that
[54:14] can take away my burden he's the only
[54:16] one who can raised me up at the last day
[54:18] that's the reason hear ye him hallelujah
[54:34] what did Jesus we said Elijah stood for
[54:37] justice what did Jesus stand for the
[54:40] love of God grace was brought by Christ
[54:45] amen this look in John chapter 1 verse
[54:55] 11 through 13
[55:17] he came unto his own and his own
[55:20] received or not but as many as received
[55:24] him to them gave he power to become the
[55:29] sons of God even to them that believe on
[55:32] his name which were born not of blood
[55:35] nor of the will of flesh nor the will of
[55:37] man but of God what is this word power
[55:41] mean here it means the ability the
[55:44] authority that authority to become sons
[55:49] of God you had the ability to become
[55:52] sons of God now
[55:58] I look at this scripture and we're says
[56:02] he gave you the power to become sons of
[56:04] God and yet at the same time I know you
[56:06] always were a son or daughter of God and
[56:10] so what is this scripture meaning it's
[56:13] meaning he gave you the ability to be
[56:15] born again you were in your father
[56:27] before you ever came into this world the
[56:31] germ comes from the man the woman has
[56:35] the egg or the end of bedding ground but
[56:38] the germ comes from the man so you were
[56:41] in your father but you hadn't been
[56:45] expressed yet and that's the way it is
[56:48] with us in God we were in God from the
[56:51] beginning if we're eternal now we always
[56:54] were so we never had a beginning we were
[56:58] always in Him who is eternal and never
[57:01] had a beginning think about that if we
[57:04] were always in him and he never had a
[57:06] beginning but you're you're an attribute
[57:17] you you came at a certain time and
[57:20] season that godhood ordained for you you
[57:23] were born into this world but then there
[57:27] come a time for you to be born again so
[57:32] that he could have fellowship with you
[57:36] you in a natural way in your father but
[57:39] he couldn't have fellowship with you
[57:41] brother Adam said until you came through
[57:43] the bedding ground and then was manifest
[57:46] in this life then he could have
[57:49] fellowship with you
[57:59] that's what brother branham said about
[58:01] the power to become sons he said what
[58:03] the purpose of God was and that was to
[58:05] have fellowship so he gave you the
[58:09] ability to be born again remember when
[58:11] Nicodemus come to him says how can a man
[58:14] be born again can he again enter into
[58:16] his mother's womb
[58:19] how can a man be born again see he liked
[58:22] the revelation of what Jesus was saying
[58:25] but Jesus was talking about this birth
[58:28] that takes place on the inside of man
[58:31] and he gave us the ability to be born
[58:35] again and he told them to go and tarry
[58:41] in Jerusalem until they were in dude
[58:44] with power from on high
[58:49] power that word power there means it's
[58:54] the Greek word Dunamis which you've
[58:57] heard many times
[59:01] it means the power or might the force to
[59:08] be but he gave you the ability to be
[59:15] born again he gave them ability to go to
[59:19] the upper room to receive that new birth
[59:24] your life Jesus came it says he came to
[59:28] his own and his own received him not but
[59:31] you know who did receiving the common
[59:33] folks received him readily the real it
[59:41] the religious soand souls of the day and
[59:45] they didn't receive him but the common
[59:49] people received him gladly
[59:54] and as many as came to him he gave the
[59:57] ability to be born again
[1:00:01] Oh hallelujah sealed away until the day
[1:00:05] of redemption
[1:00:08] you know I look forward
[1:00:12] to the day of complete redemption
[1:00:14] meaning when we received a body change I
[1:00:18] look forward to seeing my loved ones
[1:00:21] again look forward to seeing my dad
[1:00:24] again
[1:00:25] I look forward to seeing my grandfather
[1:00:27] again I look forward to seeing many of
[1:00:30] the fellow soldiers that have went on to
[1:00:33] be with the Lord see them again but you
[1:00:35] know who I want to see the most I want
[1:00:38] to see Jesus I look forward to meeting
[1:00:43] brother Branham but I want to see Jesus
[1:00:47] hallelujah because he's the one that
[1:00:51] gave me the power to become son of God
[1:00:55] hallelujah I wouldn't be anything
[1:00:58] without Jesus you wouldn't be nothing
[1:01:01] without Jesus all the accomplishments
[1:01:08] you could ever make in this life
[1:01:12] you know when I was
[1:01:16] years ago when I was in the army I made
[1:01:18] a lot of accomplishments
[1:01:21] I was good at being a soldier
[1:01:23] I learnt the army way and I was good at
[1:01:27] it
[1:01:28] and I received a lot of awards for it
[1:01:33] and I made a lot of accomplishments
[1:01:38] you know when it come down to it none of
[1:01:41] that meant anything and I was offered a
[1:01:47] lot more if I'd have stayed in
[1:01:51] but I felt this pull from God and though
[1:01:59] my mind told me the best thing for you
[1:02:01] to do is stay in and go ahead and take
[1:02:03] the promotion they're gonna give you
[1:02:10] but my heart told me something different
[1:02:12] I was willing to lay all those things
[1:02:19] down lay all those things aside you have
[1:02:26] had a point in your life where you had
[1:02:28] to make it just look Moses
[1:02:31] Moses / sook everything for Christ
[1:02:37] that's what the Prophet said he gave up
[1:02:42] all the treasures of Egypt
[1:02:45] to become God's man
[1:02:57] some years ago I was down in Sarasota
[1:03:02] Florida and I was with brother Danny
[1:03:05] steaming and we went out fishing we were
[1:03:08] on the bay out there and he started
[1:03:10] pointing out to me different houses that
[1:03:13] were along the coast there and in
[1:03:16] mansions they were actually not houses
[1:03:19] and he was pointing out these mansions
[1:03:21] to me and this one belong to so-and-so
[1:03:24] and this one belong to this famous
[1:03:27] person and this belonged to that famous
[1:03:29] person
[1:03:30] and I thought about what brother branham
[1:03:33] said he said they're having their
[1:03:35] millennium now we're looking forward to
[1:03:41] Armellini
[1:03:43] [Applause]
[1:03:49] turned me to Hebrews chapter 12
[1:03:57] we read verse 5 through 17
[1:04:08] Hebrews chapter 12 this is the chapter
[1:04:10] it starts off with with seeing that
[1:04:14] we're comes to Bob was such a great a
[1:04:17] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:04:18] every weight that does so easily beset
[1:04:21] us and let us run this race with
[1:04:23] patience that's how it begins but then
[1:04:26] in verse five it said you have forgotten
[1:04:29] the exhortation which speaking unto you
[1:04:30] as unto children my son despise not thou
[1:04:33] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[1:04:35] when thou are rebuked of him for whom
[1:04:38] the Lord loveth he chasing it and
[1:04:40] scourges every son whom he receiveth if
[1:04:43] he endure chastening then God dealeth
[1:04:48] with you as with sons for what son is he
[1:04:51] whom the father chasing it not but if he
[1:04:55] be without chastisement whereof all are
[1:04:58] partakers then you are bastards and not
[1:05:00] sons
[1:05:01] furthermore we've had fathers of our
[1:05:03] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[1:05:05] them reverence shall we not much rather
[1:05:07] be in subjection to the father of
[1:05:09] spirits and live for verily for they
[1:05:13] verily for a few days chastened us after
[1:05:16] their own pleasure but he for our profit
[1:05:18] that we might be partakers of his
[1:05:21] holiness now no chastening is for the
[1:05:26] present seemeth to be joyous but
[1:05:28] Grievous nevertheless afterward it
[1:05:31] yieldeth the peaceful fruit of
[1:05:32] righteousness under them which are
[1:05:34] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[1:05:40] hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:05:41] knees make straight paths for your feet
[1:05:44] less that which is lame be turned out of
[1:05:47] the way but let it rather be healed
[1:05:50] follow people peace with all men and
[1:05:53] holiness without which no man shall see
[1:05:57] the Lord look diligently lest any man
[1:05:59] fail the grace of God lest any root of
[1:06:02] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:06:04] thereby many be defiled lest there be
[1:06:06] any fornicator or profane person as Esau
[1:06:10] or for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:06:12] birthright for we know how that
[1:06:15] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:06:16] the blessing he was rejected
[1:06:19] for he found no place of repentance
[1:06:21] though he sought it carefully with tears
[1:06:28] there was no way for Esau to get the
[1:06:31] blessing after the blessing had already
[1:06:34] been given remember he saw says to to
[1:06:36] his father Isaac says blessed me also my
[1:06:40] father he says I can't I've gave the
[1:06:45] blessing to your brother
[1:06:47] I've made you his servant
[1:06:53] he cried
[1:06:58] but it was already done nothing could
[1:07:02] reverse it that's why he says he could
[1:07:05] find no place of repentance
[1:07:13] brother etem says and follow him he says
[1:07:18] job had not sinned he knew he hadn't
[1:07:21] sinned he had not sinned so he would not
[1:07:25] confess it because he absolutely hadn't
[1:07:27] sin but God was really trying him
[1:07:30] putting him to the test and I believe
[1:07:33] that every Christian that's born again
[1:07:34] has to go through those tests every son
[1:07:39] that cometh to God must first be chasing
[1:07:41] purge is that right if you cannot be
[1:07:44] stand chastisement of the Lord then you
[1:07:47] become a bastard or an illegitimate
[1:07:49] child you claim God to be your father
[1:07:52] and you know nothing of it a real true
[1:07:56] born-again child of God stands firm we
[1:07:59] are sold with an incorruptible seed of
[1:08:01] God it cannot perish see what I mean now
[1:08:04] if you got your ups and downs I would
[1:08:09] advise you to go to Dada and stay there
[1:08:11] until you really get born again when
[1:08:15] trials and troubles and heartaches and
[1:08:17] disappointments set in something holds
[1:08:20] it's not you holding there's something
[1:08:23] holding you see it isn't a question
[1:08:26] whether I hold on or not it's a question
[1:08:29] whether he held on or not it isn't
[1:08:32] looking at me it's looking at him he's
[1:08:34] the one something keeps holding me
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:41] hallelujah
[1:08:45] Jacob Jacob running from his brother
[1:08:51] feared for his life flees into another
[1:08:56] country
[1:08:59] then when he meets with God wrestles
[1:09:03] with an angel of God and he says bless
[1:09:08] me I'll not let you go do you bless me
[1:09:11] he was determined to get blessed by the
[1:09:16] angel you know what he got blessed with
[1:09:19] the power to become a prince the ability
[1:09:26] to become a prince
[1:09:28] that's what brother Branham said Paul
[1:09:33] lost all of his education all his
[1:09:36] theology God made him a missionary to
[1:09:39] the Gentiles
[1:09:41] Moses lost his ability become weak God
[1:09:44] made him powerful and sent him back to
[1:09:46] Egypt
[1:09:48] with a stick in his hand 80 years old
[1:09:53] not an army behind he were growing up
[1:09:56] there but in the power of the Spirit
[1:09:58] when you're weak then you're strong it's
[1:10:03] not in our strength or our power but
[1:10:06] it's his strength when works what does
[1:10:10] it mean when we are weak we are strong
[1:10:12] when we're trying to do it we're not
[1:10:14] we're not going to be able to we're not
[1:10:16] going to make it when we're trying to do
[1:10:19] it on our own of our own efforts but
[1:10:23] when we lead on him then we're strong
[1:10:27] then we overcome then we'll succeed
[1:10:38] Bentham says in a super sign he said
[1:10:41] this will be a sign God will be dwelling
[1:10:45] in flesh
[1:10:48] that was to attract the people for as
[1:10:51] many as received him to them gave he the
[1:10:53] power to become sons of God and it's
[1:10:57] supposed to attract the evening light
[1:10:59] people when the light shows what
[1:11:04] attracted you to this message the
[1:11:09] evening light to think of how many are
[1:11:16] not attracted by it when you were in the
[1:11:23] world you may have had friends you may
[1:11:26] have thought they were good friends dear
[1:11:27] friends but when something began to pull
[1:11:31] on you on that inside and you were
[1:11:34] attracted that evening light then look
[1:11:36] what happened to them and I'm so
[1:11:46] thankful we come to the Lord and then we
[1:11:48] realized we got such a great big family
[1:11:53] amen hallelujah I just I enjoy seeing
[1:12:01] the love for one another when I was at
[1:12:04] Paul's graduation gathering and I was
[1:12:09] watching the different people I enjoyed
[1:12:12] the love that I saw coming from each one
[1:12:16] love for each other as just so wonderful
[1:12:23] you're the evening light people
[1:12:27] yeah that ought to that ought to give
[1:12:31] you something see when it said make your
[1:12:35] calling and election sure it didn't mean
[1:12:37] just prop it up but it mean
[1:12:41] make it steadfast another word give it a
[1:12:43] foundation an anchor something you can
[1:12:48] look back to
[1:12:53] he drew you look you young people you
[1:12:57] think well I'm here because mom and dad
[1:12:59] are here know you that God has been
[1:13:02] dealing with God is that that evening
[1:13:04] light is attracting you
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:15] I think there were times in my ministry
[1:13:19] over the years that I kind of forgot I
[1:13:22] was so busy on saying what the prophets
[1:13:26] said I forgot to tell a new generation
[1:13:28] coming up that God sent a prophet
[1:13:35] I thought they would just get it God
[1:13:40] began to deal with me and I had to go
[1:13:41] back and bring in some teachings and
[1:13:43] things and show the scripturally God
[1:13:45] sent a prophet show how that John the
[1:13:52] Baptist was to fulfill to melikhaya 3 he
[1:13:56] was the fulfillment of turning the
[1:13:58] hearts of the father's back to the
[1:14:01] children as the scripture says remember
[1:14:04] the a the angel of the Lord came to
[1:14:06] Zacharias and he said he'll turn the
[1:14:08] hearts of the father's back to the
[1:14:11] children he stopped there but the rest
[1:14:17] of the scripture says that that spirit
[1:14:20] of Elijah was to turn the hearts of the
[1:14:23] children back to the father's that was
[1:14:27] fulfilled in the ministry of brother
[1:14:29] Branham I had to go back and bring teach
[1:14:33] these things just short scripturally I
[1:14:35] was talking to one of my daughters one
[1:14:38] time and I just thinking on these things
[1:14:41] in here she was in her late 20s and I
[1:14:44] said I asked her I said I know you
[1:14:50] believed that brother Branham was God's
[1:14:51] prophet but you know why we say that
[1:14:57] do you know it's scripturally
[1:15:00] she says no so I said oh then I'm gonna
[1:15:03] have to teach it because this generation
[1:15:07] needs to know and it's it's not bringing
[1:15:13] it emphases on the profit but you've got
[1:15:17] to realize God sent a profit so that you
[1:15:19] can hear what the Prophet had to say
[1:15:21] know that we need to hear it
[1:15:24] why because and it's not look the voice
[1:15:27] was not brother Branham for the random
[1:15:30] said I'm just the the mouthpiece that
[1:15:33] God uses but the voice was the voice of
[1:15:36] God hear ye him he can't live in
[1:15:47] yesterday's light you know I
[1:15:53] remember rolling up for a while down in
[1:15:57] another part of whoa hi oh and seeing
[1:16:00] the farmers raise their crops seeing the
[1:16:04] seasons as they changed
[1:16:06] you know they would plant wheat in the
[1:16:10] fall after harvest and everything they'd
[1:16:12] plant the wheat then it would come up it
[1:16:15] would look like green grass and then it
[1:16:17] would lay there all winter and the snow
[1:16:21] would come and be as an insulator over
[1:16:23] it in the freezing temperatures to have
[1:16:26] a good crop of wheat they needed to have
[1:16:28] snow for an insulation of the on the
[1:16:32] wheat
[1:16:34] and but the sun that shined in January
[1:16:38] though it was the same Sun that science
[1:16:41] shined in June but in June it was
[1:16:43] stronger
[1:16:47] and so brother Brahim said is the same
[1:16:49] son it's the same son but it's gotten
[1:16:53] closer
[1:16:54] it stronger the Sun is coming closer the
[1:16:59] in it's closer to its coming and
[1:17:04] it's crunch then the light is gotten is
[1:17:06] getting stronger and stronger you look
[1:17:11] at what we you they were following this
[1:17:14] message back in the 70s looking what you
[1:17:17] knew then now look at what the
[1:17:19] revelation you have today it has got
[1:17:22] stronger you understand more you look
[1:17:28] back at those times as a boy I didn't
[1:17:30] really understand anything and I thought
[1:17:32] I did what is it the sun's getting close
[1:17:38] to we're in it we're in a new light it's
[1:17:40] the same Sun but it's a greater light
[1:17:46] what happened to the ages of Lutheran
[1:17:50] Leslie they the people took and
[1:17:54] organized and they organized around the
[1:17:58] light of that day but as the light began
[1:18:01] to become greater they didn't move on
[1:18:03] with it
[1:18:06] I'm afraid there's a lot of people that
[1:18:09] are doing that today they're still
[1:18:13] living in a light of yesterday I'm gonna
[1:18:17] tell you something friends the light is
[1:18:18] stronger today than it was when brother
[1:18:20] Branham was here it's closer to the
[1:18:24] coming of the Sun it's greater think
[1:18:33] about it what good would the revelation
[1:18:36] do just stayed in one man one what God's
[1:18:43] purpose wasn't for one man to be the
[1:18:46] only one to hold the revelation that he
[1:18:48] was Sentinel in this endtime but he sent
[1:18:52] it through that man that you might have
[1:18:55] the revelation he said to his bride to
[1:19:01] the alert
[1:19:17] you're gonna be there because you say
[1:19:23] why because he knew you were gonna be
[1:19:26] there
[1:19:28] God knew it you know what he knew every
[1:19:32] prayer that would ever be prayed by his
[1:19:35] children don't worry about was not going
[1:19:40] to answer my prayer he's already
[1:19:42] answered it he knew your prayer before
[1:19:44] you prayed it just be patient everything
[1:19:53] comes in the right season everything
[1:19:55] comes at the right time
[1:19:58] God doesn't rush God never feels like
[1:20:04] I'm running out of time now I know there
[1:20:09] there is a supernatural being that does
[1:20:12] feel like they're running out of time
[1:20:15] that's the devil I'm running out of time
[1:20:21] I'm under a lot of pressure I got to
[1:20:24] bring more pressure but you know what is
[1:20:28] the pressure comes on you know what it
[1:20:30] does it just squeezes that little bride
[1:20:31] right on out of here how to look at you
[1:20:38] in the church age book bill around says
[1:20:42] hold this carefully in mind
[1:20:45] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[1:20:48] the original owner God by his death the
[1:20:51] shed blood Brooke bought back his own he
[1:20:55] bought back the spoken-word seed bride
[1:20:57] my sheep hear my voice word and they
[1:21:01] follow me
[1:21:02] you always were a sheep you never were a
[1:21:05] pig or a dog and turned into a sheep
[1:21:07] that's impossible for every kind of life
[1:21:10] produces the same kind and there is no
[1:21:14] change in specie as we were in the
[1:21:19] thoughts of God and then expressed in
[1:21:21] flesh there had to come a day when we
[1:21:23] would hear his voice and hearing that
[1:21:26] voice would be aware of our Father
[1:21:28] calling and recognized that we are the
[1:21:31] sons of God we heard his voice hear ye
[1:21:38] him hallelujah
[1:21:43] he says hidden thinking man's filter but
[1:21:45] when you were born of the Spirit of God
[1:21:47] then you you are son of God when you
[1:21:52] always were a son of God and you always
[1:21:55] will be a son of God no weight is
[1:21:58] separated you have eternal life and
[1:22:00] eternal never did begin neither will it
[1:22:03] ever end
[1:22:10] speaking about Moses and why Christ
[1:22:12] speak he said now then see that he was
[1:22:15] born with the great gifts and quality
[1:22:17] within him and then it only taken
[1:22:20] something to flash across that to bring
[1:22:23] that thing to life see the seat of God
[1:22:26] is actually placed in us from the
[1:22:28] foundation of the world and when the
[1:22:31] light first strikes that seed it brings
[1:22:33] it to life but the light first has to
[1:22:36] come upon the seed I've taught many
[1:22:41] times of the little woman at the well in
[1:22:43] her in that condition though she be a
[1:22:46] ill-famed person though her life was
[1:22:50] degraded and she was in that condition
[1:22:52] because those traditions never touched
[1:22:55] her but when the light first trucker
[1:22:58] quickly she recognized because there was
[1:23:01] something in there to respond to it when
[1:23:05] the deep called to the deep there must
[1:23:07] be a deed somewhere to respond to it
[1:23:11] hallelujah are we doing tonight making
[1:23:15] our calling and election sure Alleluia
[1:23:30] the debate on tongues or the rim said I
[1:23:36] certainly don't want to be wrong and I'd
[1:23:39] better be right cause it's too late when
[1:23:42] I get there
[1:23:45] as the old brother said I don't want no
[1:23:49] trouble at the river so that's right
[1:23:53] it's going to be foggy morning then an
[1:23:55] awful time and I'm sure want my ticket
[1:23:57] in my hand it correctly signed because
[1:24:01] it's too late then you see for the
[1:24:05] random quoting this older brother saying
[1:24:08] I don't want no trouble at the river
[1:24:11] friends we're not going to have any
[1:24:12] trouble at the crossing
[1:24:16] I passed from this life I just go into
[1:24:22] the dimension to wait on everybody else
[1:24:25] I literally and if I'm alive and remain
[1:24:31] at the coming of the Lord then I'll see
[1:24:33] the dead in Christ rise first then I'll
[1:24:37] be changed in a moment in tweekly than I
[1:24:41] I believe that the prophets said we'd be
[1:24:52] here about a month or so after the
[1:24:56] resurrection but I don't believe the
[1:25:01] world will be able to see the dead in
[1:25:05] Christ I don't believe they'll be able
[1:25:09] to necessarily see you when you were
[1:25:11] changed I think about it often and I
[1:25:15] think well I'm not gonna have to worry
[1:25:18] about paying Dixon power you know The
[1:25:24] Electric Company I'm not gonna have to
[1:25:25] worry about the electric company or the
[1:25:27] water bill
[1:25:29] all those things will be passed from my
[1:25:31] mind I don't loo you I'm not gonna need
[1:25:35] my truck I'll be able to travel like I
[1:25:41] thought that was a question I had
[1:25:50] when I heard there were people that were
[1:25:53] believing in the return of brother
[1:25:55] Branham in some years and years back
[1:25:58] there was a brother that had a airplane
[1:26:00] waiting on him he was gonna fly him
[1:26:02] around from place to place I thought
[1:26:04] it'd be come back what in the world
[1:26:05] would he need an airplane for we don't
[1:26:13] need no airplane hallelujah Oh Stan
[1:26:24] Heavenly Father it's been good to been
[1:26:26] in your house tonight Lord I trust it
[1:26:29] what you laid on my heart I trust that I

[1:26:38] of where they might be blessed and
