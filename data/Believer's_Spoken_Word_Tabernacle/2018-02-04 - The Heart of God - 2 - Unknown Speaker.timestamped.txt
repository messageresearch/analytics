[48:31] say just so good here too here is mr.
[48:36] krest
[48:37] back here with us
[48:39] you know sometimes I it's happened to me
[48:42] before I was ministering on Thursday and
[48:44] I looked out on Thursday and I thought
[48:46] that sister Ana I'm making in my mind
[48:50] with she's not been here for a weekend
[48:53] she's been she's been gone did she did
[48:55] she do come back last week my mind inven
[48:57] in the midst of ministering I seen that
[48:59] but she just she just got back if she
[49:02] hadn't come back in time for the
[49:03] fellowship we would have send emergency
[49:04] escort if you don't know what that means
[49:08] well you can talk to me after I've been
[49:10] through the line you love him
[49:16] glory be to God
[49:18] Psalms 19 verse seven I want you just to
[49:27] these are familiar perhaps maybe too
[49:30] many very familiar places in the Word of
[49:33] God but I want you to notice how David
[49:35] and his were in the writing as the
[49:37] Spirit of God is leading David here the
[49:41] law of the Lord is perfect converting
[49:44] the soul the testimony of the Lord is
[49:50] sure making wise the simple the statue
[49:54] of the Lord are right rejoicing the
[49:59] heart the commandment of the Lord is
[50:02] pure enlightening the eye the fear of
[50:07] the Lord is clean enduring forever the
[50:10] judgments of the Lord are true and
[50:13] righteous altogether more to be desired
[50:18] are they than gold yea than much fine
[50:22] gold now here is a man who is expressing
[50:28] from his heart how he truly feels about
[50:34] the law of God in an amazing that in
[50:38] this hour and throughout time that when
[50:41] we look at the law people can look at
[50:43] the law and say law who needs the law
[50:46] but here David is looking at the law but
[50:48] he's looking at it different than how
[50:50] others look at David his David is
[50:54] rejoicing David doesn't even see the
[50:56] fulfillment of where that the law of God
[50:59] would make it to to actually be
[51:01] inscribed upon our hearts but yet David
[51:03] himself is rejoicing what would David do
[51:07] in services like this you see what I'm
[51:12] saying
[51:13] well what would David do and he would
[51:16] dance all right that's the absolute
[51:17] truth he would definitely be dancing
[51:21] because he's rejoicing in the law of God
[51:25] right here Oh mine they're sweeter also
[51:32] than honey and the honeycomb moreover by
[51:36] them is thy servant warned and in
[51:38] keeping of them there is great reward
[51:41] now watch these next few verses who can
[51:44] understand his errors cleanse thou me
[51:49] from secret faults keep back by servant
[51:54] also from presumptuous meaning arrogant
[51:57] proudful sins let them not have dominion
[52:02] over me then shall I be upright and I
[52:09] shall be innocent from the great
[52:12] transgression
[52:13] so David understood that it was the true
[52:17] keeping of the law was not just that
[52:20] David could point to a letter and say
[52:21] I'm doing this but David said God don't
[52:25] let presumptuous sins have dominion over
[52:28] me don't let pride and arrogancy don't
[52:31] let it rule because if that rules then
[52:35] no matter what I can do by the letter
[52:36] I'm guilty I'm guilty let the words now
[52:42] here's there's the request let the words
[52:45] of my mouth and the meditation of my
[52:49] heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord
[52:54] my strength and my
[52:59] amen may God bless you and bless as word
[53:03] as you're being seeded
[53:05] like to speak here
[53:07] can you hear just few moments on the
[53:11] heart of God you know when we we look
[53:16] back through the Scriptures we we always
[53:20] concede that there were always
[53:25] associated throughout the scriptures
[53:28] there were those who were of the elect
[53:31] of God who they were able by God's grace
[53:36] to be touched by the grace of God and be
[53:42] able to live out in that day and in that
[53:46] time and be able to catch what God was
[53:49] was trying to say in that time and we
[53:51] know that all the way down through the
[53:54] time god it was like a a great big
[53:58] puzzle if you were working pieces were
[54:00] continually coming together or we could
[54:03] say an unfolding that was taking place
[54:05] and we find that there were those when
[54:10] we looked at it in just narrowing this
[54:13] in here that a children of God who were
[54:16] able to by God's grace to not just live
[54:20] by a letter but they would live by the
[54:22] revelation of God himself and there was
[54:27] there were their lives if I can say it
[54:30] like this their lives were surrendered
[54:33] to a to the pulsation of God's heart it
[54:37] wasn't David that was register iting
[54:40] these words just because just to write
[54:43] words but David was writing these words
[54:46] that we read here this morning because
[54:48] it was a pulsation of an experience that
[54:52] he had with Almighty God and and this is
[54:55] really how David looked at it this is
[54:58] how David felt about it and here within
[55:01] within that it was a pulsation among the
[55:05] children of God within that hour that
[55:07] you know it was like that of where
[55:10] you take Moses Moses could hear the
[55:12] promise of God and and as his mother
[55:15] would talk of it but when it came time
[55:17] for that promise to be fulfilled that
[55:20] promise it's out there was a pulsation
[55:23] of life that moved into that promise and
[55:26] not just into the promise but it moved
[55:29] into Moses life to where that it was no
[55:32] longer a promise that was here that
[55:34] Moses knew about but now Moses had
[55:38] become one with that promise and so what
[55:41] was what was actually taking place it
[55:43] was the heart of God that was pulsating
[55:46] through Moses life what was it that
[55:48] would cause a man to lay himself down in
[55:52] the gap for many others it it was not a
[55:54] mere man it was Christ in the man what
[55:58] what is it that would that would drive
[56:00] where you would see this to where that
[56:03] this would be so taken by this and even
[56:06] Paul where Paul would speak of this in
[56:08] the book of Colossians and say I strive
[56:11] according to his working which worketh
[56:13] in me mightily and Paul would write of
[56:16] that even in the book of Ephesians
[56:17] letting him know that this is not my
[56:20] doing it's not my working but this is
[56:23] the very heart of God it's his pulsation
[56:27] that is beating out that's moving me
[56:30] it's what's giving me strength in the up
[56:33] times and the down times he keeps
[56:36] supplying me with strength
[56:38] it's life it's not us living out the
[56:41] promise
[56:42] it's Christ living the promise out
[56:45] through you and I that's the real
[56:48] reality of the heart of God and the real
[56:51] pulsation to where our lives are to be a
[56:54] heartbeat where God Himself reflecting
[56:57] and making himself known through our
[56:59] lives you find David David would many
[57:02] times David and many others that they
[57:04] would be so as they're surrendered to
[57:07] the Lord and they would actually speak
[57:09] things that was the very gripping in
[57:12] their hearts but yet it would be beyond
[57:14] their understanding and David would
[57:16] prophesy by the Spirit of God the heart
[57:19] of God would move down
[57:20] they would Paul say through David and it
[57:22] wouldn't begin to speak out my bones my
[57:24] bones they stare at me
[57:26] it is pulsating throughout his life even
[57:28] where in Psalms 40 where it would say
[57:30] that I have I've hid that word in my
[57:32] heart my delight I delight to do thy
[57:35] will O God and I delight with my whole
[57:38] heart
[57:38] all of those pulsations were from
[57:41] Almighty God and David was moved by the
[57:45] position of God to what was being spoken
[57:48] to his heart David would speak it right
[57:51] out and I believe that there is a people
[57:54] on earth right now that is moved by the
[57:57] pulsation of the Holy Spirit where it's
[58:00] not just a written word it's not just a
[58:03] word that's been prophetically spoken
[58:05] but it's a word that is being lived out
[58:08] it's a word that is taking its residency
[58:12] within the heart of the believer and
[58:14] that same word in the heart of faith
[58:16] it's here more powerful and more
[58:18] stronger than it ever is because in this
[58:21] day we have not ordained ourselves for
[58:24] this moment God ordained us for this
[58:26] moment it's God who has provided for us
[58:29] what we have need up to be able to stand
[58:31] in this hour it's God when the enemy
[58:34] wanted to tear down the standard it's
[58:35] down who has rose the standard out when
[58:38] they wanted to dispose of the Holy Ghost
[58:40] it's God who came on the scene and to
[58:42] prove to you and I that he steal every
[58:45] one of his promises are still yay and
[58:47] amen hallelujah amen these are not just
[58:53] statelessness as a reality to you and I
[58:55] that within these things are things that
[58:57] were to take into our hearts and
[59:00] meditate on and give ourselves to David
[59:06] new the Living God he knew God David had
[59:12] a delight we're mean you find David
[59:14] throughout the scripture speaking over
[59:16] and over with my whole heart Oh God
[59:19] you find David asking requests over and
[59:23] over in the scriptures quicken down me
[59:26] Lord quickened down me Lord quickened
[59:29] down me Lord you
[59:31] the profit in this day he didn't just
[59:33] preach of the quickening back in the in
[59:36] the early part of the ministry but he
[59:38] continued and even clear up to the very
[59:41] end delivered the sum of the last few
[59:44] requests in prayer was quick and us O
[59:47] Lord what is the quickening as we said
[59:51] last week the heart itself actually is
[59:54] in the natural is a separation from the
[59:57] central nervous system it actually has
[59:59] electrical impulses of its own and to
[1:00:03] think of this right here that the heart
[1:00:05] of God to think of Christ himself he
[1:00:07] does not need the energy from any man he
[1:00:12] supplies the energy he supplies the
[1:00:15] strength when Abraham said I don't know
[1:00:17] how it can be done
[1:00:18] he said nurse from me he drew Abraham
[1:00:23] white why do you draw the baby what is
[1:00:25] it that really calms the baby it's not
[1:00:27] so much doubt of the breast or the milk
[1:00:30] it's hearing the heartbeat it is hearing
[1:00:33] what it heard when it was in the womb
[1:00:35] and that's what brings strength to you
[1:00:38] and I know we don't remember it but it
[1:00:40] comes to a reality to you and I but I
[1:00:43] was in Christ before the foundation of
[1:00:46] the world I was ordained in the very
[1:00:48] heart of Almighty God and when the
[1:00:50] promise of God comes by in the salary
[1:00:52] and the Living God he reaches down to
[1:00:55] you and I and you say I don't know how I
[1:00:57] can do it I don't know how I can
[1:00:59] overcome this I don't know how I can get
[1:01:01] past this he says my child just
[1:01:03] surrender and he takes us up into his
[1:01:06] bosom
[1:01:07] what is his closer his bosom is the
[1:01:09] prophesied promise of the hour where he
[1:01:13] made himself alive and real where it's
[1:01:16] no longer just aware but it becomes a
[1:01:18] source of strength and nourishment that
[1:01:21] you can receive into your life what you
[1:01:26] have need of with Jesus and my words
[1:01:29] they are spirits and their life
[1:01:36] once she just says we look at this in
[1:01:39] the scripture and Isaiah 29 I I want to
[1:01:44] look here and take a journey into
[1:01:46] looking at how that prophecy itself had
[1:01:50] spoke regarding the condition that was
[1:01:53] that was going to be present when the
[1:01:57] Messiah would come there in Israel and
[1:01:59] we find that how that in the Book of
[1:02:02] Isaiah that even in verse 9 I'm just
[1:02:06] going to kind of move over some things
[1:02:07] here just to refer to it of how that the
[1:02:10] scripture would talk about that they are
[1:02:12] given to a strong drink they're given to
[1:02:16] a drink that would intoxicate them and
[1:02:20] it's an intoxication that would make
[1:02:23] them numb and not realize what is
[1:02:27] actually taking place he goes on to say
[1:02:30] how that God through that would pour out
[1:02:33] the spirit of slumber and here within
[1:02:35] those things here you know the
[1:02:37] intoxicating part leading to that of
[1:02:39] slumber but then how that the Lord how
[1:02:42] it would spoke in the scripture the
[1:02:44] result of this slumbering is where the
[1:02:47] Bible says in Isaiah 29 11 that the
[1:02:49] vision of all is become unto you as the
[1:02:54] words of a book that is sealed which men
[1:02:57] delivered to one that is learned saying
[1:02:59] read this I pray thee and he said I
[1:03:01] cannot for it is Selah and the book has
[1:03:05] delivered to him that is not learned
[1:03:07] saying read this I pray thee and he said
[1:03:10] I'm not learned so the book itself
[1:03:13] though having words the learned doesn't
[1:03:16] understand it but nothing I've learned
[1:03:19] doesn't understand it so it's a
[1:03:22] condition where we can understand this
[1:03:25] that God's desire is that you and I
[1:03:28] would understand that I want you just to
[1:03:30] hang on to that God's desire is that you
[1:03:33] and I would understand but he God does
[1:03:36] not come according to the understanding
[1:03:38] of man he does not work according to the
[1:03:42] intelligence or the wisdom of men but
[1:03:45] God himself he works in
[1:03:47] understanding that whereby his children
[1:03:50] his elect his subjects will understand
[1:03:54] and he knows just what to do
[1:03:59] the Bible says in verse 13 wherefore the
[1:04:03] Lord said for as much as his people draw
[1:04:07] near me with their mouths and with their
[1:04:10] lips do honor me
[1:04:12] but have removed their heart far from me
[1:04:19] they were so close to him but yet they
[1:04:23] were so far away so close yet so far it
[1:04:28] wasn't that they weren't saying the
[1:04:30] right things their heart their heart he
[1:04:35] never come to get their lips he come to
[1:04:38] get their heart their lips were not
[1:04:41] straight from him this their heart was
[1:04:43] straight from him you see God's not
[1:04:46] listen you the inside God gets the
[1:04:48] inside of the life right the outside
[1:04:52] will reflect what's on the inside
[1:04:54] is that right remember the the Pharisees
[1:04:57] and all of them remember they were
[1:04:58] saying you know in regarding to the Lord
[1:05:01] Jesus about how his disciples were they
[1:05:03] were eating with unwashen hands and and
[1:05:05] the Lord Jesus begins to bring it out to
[1:05:08] them that a man is not defiled from what
[1:05:12] he from what as he's taking that in but
[1:05:14] he said his defilement is from that
[1:05:17] which is already within him for out of
[1:05:20] the heart proceedeth and he began to go
[1:05:23] through from all those things where the
[1:05:25] word from the heart those things that go
[1:05:27] forth so is saying that the ministry
[1:05:30] listen to me now the Ministry of the
[1:05:32] Lord Jesus when he's coming here at the
[1:05:35] end of the ages to the to Israel it's a
[1:05:38] ministry that's to deal with the heart
[1:05:41] of the people of God and they are not
[1:05:44] even aware that their heart has drifted
[1:05:47] from God they don't know the condition
[1:05:49] they don't know what's needed but God
[1:05:52] knew the condition and God knows what
[1:05:54] they needed
[1:05:55] just like God knew that can
[1:05:56] in this age and he knows the condition
[1:05:58] this morning and he supplies what is
[1:06:01] needed to bring all things about to
[1:06:05] where his word my half recourse I'm glad
[1:06:08] about that
[1:06:09] I'm so glad about that and their fear
[1:06:13] notice they've removed their heart far
[1:06:15] from me notice they have removed it they
[1:06:19] did God didn't shove their heart away
[1:06:21] they removed it and their fear toward me
[1:06:26] is taught by the precept of man and he
[1:06:30] goes on to talk about of how I'm gonna
[1:06:32] proceed to do a marvellous work among
[1:06:34] this people even a marvelous work and a
[1:06:36] wonder for the wisdom of their wise men
[1:06:38] shall perish and the understanding of
[1:06:41] their prudent men shall be hid I want to
[1:06:46] just look at that for a moment when we
[1:06:48] when it says here in the scriptures in
[1:06:50] verse 13 their fear toward me is talk
[1:06:53] about the precept of a man the Bible
[1:06:58] says that the fear of the Lord is clean
[1:07:01] you see the fear of the Lord does not
[1:07:05] listen when it comes it is clean and it
[1:07:08] does not leave your dirty that's not the
[1:07:12] real fear of the Lord let me just deal
[1:07:13] with this a little bit the fear of the
[1:07:15] Lord does not leave you in a place to
[1:07:18] where you're operating under fear it
[1:07:23] brings reverence and reverence can only
[1:07:26] come by love God's desire is not that
[1:07:33] his children would operate under a
[1:07:35] spirit of fear because that's bondage
[1:07:38] God doesn't want anybody serving them
[1:07:41] because they have to he wants you an act
[1:07:45] to serve Him because we love him I mean
[1:07:49] you wouldn't want to marry somebody you
[1:07:51] don't want to marry right I know I know
[1:07:55] some of y'all understand you got some
[1:07:57] things about arranged marriages and
[1:07:59] whatever more but there's only one
[1:08:00] arranged marriage now I don't say that I
[1:08:02] don't believe in
[1:08:02] marriages cuz I don't want to offend
[1:08:04] anybody or any of my brothers that might
[1:08:06] be listening in other countries but I
[1:08:08] want to say it like this there's one
[1:08:10] arranged marriage that I do believe in
[1:08:13] this is where brother Samson never
[1:08:15] really let me have it very good this is
[1:08:17] where I do believe in one arranged
[1:08:18] marriage that it was already arranged
[1:08:21] before the foundation of the world been
[1:08:24] you and I would be united with Christ in
[1:08:26] this hour let me tell you something it's
[1:08:28] not something forceful we are drawn to
[1:08:31] it
[1:08:31] it is the very desire by heart what
[1:08:34] we've been longing for what we were
[1:08:36] looking for it was a thirst that the
[1:08:38] world could never satisfy but he came
[1:08:41] along and he put that feeling in our
[1:08:44] life it is a thirst quencher it was a
[1:08:52] rage deep in the meeting place where God
[1:08:56] would change your life
[1:08:58] it was divinely arranged Jacob there
[1:09:03] might have been of the church and might
[1:09:04] have been in the garage he might have
[1:09:06] been sitting in your car it might have
[1:09:08] been there but wherever it was it was
[1:09:09] pineal for you it was the face of God to
[1:09:13] you where God met you face to face glory
[1:09:20] be to God the truth here the truth here
[1:09:24] he comes by the presence of the Lord
[1:09:27] it's not generated by man or the
[1:09:30] knowledge of man but it's by his
[1:09:33] presence because when we see it that
[1:09:38] what happened God told them this is what
[1:09:41] was going to happen and we see this
[1:09:44] carrying forth in the Book of Isaiah to
[1:09:47] where it became just a generational
[1:09:50] thing they begin to hand down what had
[1:09:53] come from from generation to generation
[1:09:55] it was not a life it was a lifestyle
[1:10:00] there wasn't when you get asked why are
[1:10:03] you doing this I want you to catch this
[1:10:05] for a moment God let him know when they
[1:10:07] come out of Egypt before they ever come
[1:10:09] out after they come out he continued to
[1:10:11] tell him over and over tell your
[1:10:13] children
[1:10:16] understand not just do it tell them
[1:10:19] about it have a witness in your heart
[1:10:22] and express that to them they may not
[1:10:24] remember the words but the presence of
[1:10:27] the Lord that comes through what you're
[1:10:30] expressing they may not be able to
[1:10:31] understand it that's not what's
[1:10:32] important what's important is that the
[1:10:34] presence of the Lord is there and they
[1:10:36] know that the presence of the Lord is
[1:10:38] tied to his word hallelujah and that
[1:10:41] presence will bring them to that word to
[1:10:44] where it becomes something of fruit and
[1:10:47] understanding in their own life so the
[1:10:48] presence of the Lord is absolutely
[1:10:52] absolutely necessary otherwise it just
[1:10:59] becomes a generational thing becomes
[1:11:02] offering up with no sincerity whatsoever
[1:11:06] you say brother Samuel
[1:11:08] that can't happen around this message
[1:11:09] that attitude right there already as a
[1:11:11] product they thought it couldn't happen
[1:11:15] the moment you think that can't happen
[1:11:18] or happened to you is the very moment
[1:11:21] you are already backsliding we've got to
[1:11:26] walk daily with him this is where the
[1:11:32] profit would be very clear to us in the
[1:11:36] message Christ as the mystery of God
[1:11:38] revealed and he would tell us he said
[1:11:41] were not to make converts to
[1:11:43] Christianity by its government do we
[1:11:46] hold standards absolutely and we must
[1:11:49] hold the standards of the word
[1:11:50] absolutely he's not talking about you
[1:11:52] know not setting a standard well you
[1:11:54] know they're just my children they've
[1:11:56] got to have their own experience why
[1:11:58] would you send them back to Egypt you're
[1:12:01] in the wilderness don't take them back
[1:12:03] to Egypt
[1:12:04] get them on into the promise and no
[1:12:06] listen French listen to me you know it
[1:12:09] has to be God to do all of that I
[1:12:12] understand that there's many as we stand
[1:12:14] faithful you know it's not optimistic
[1:12:16] determined the times and where we can
[1:12:19] you know of a sudden place their births
[1:12:20] and all those things like that you
[1:12:22] understand what I'm saying but yeah I
[1:12:23] hope you
[1:12:24] through what I am saying that are just a
[1:12:26] complacent attitude that is just
[1:12:29] haphazard like well if there's this
[1:12:32] that's the way it'll be my question to
[1:12:34] you what if God had played with your
[1:12:36] salvation that way
[1:12:40] that's not a true committal a true
[1:12:43] committal is even in the midst of you
[1:12:45] where you're able to stand within that
[1:12:47] and say Lord I want to stand I want to
[1:12:49] show the standard and you know they may
[1:12:52] be out of your presence right now but
[1:12:53] you're saved by the Samuel if they're
[1:12:55] not even in my house how can I show it
[1:12:57] true standard by the loyalty of your
[1:12:59] heart the loyalty of your heart right
[1:13:03] now I want to be very clear with this
[1:13:06] here when God would even when we deal
[1:13:08] with these things you can't don't even
[1:13:10] allow yourself in this service to get
[1:13:11] back into a place when you say oh I made
[1:13:13] this flood I made this mistake listen
[1:13:15] receive God's grace and move on move on
[1:13:19] let's let's keep working on this is the
[1:13:21] thing right here don't just get down
[1:13:23] upon it but remember the presence of God
[1:13:26] is to recognize that within these things
[1:13:28] that even your contact with them whether
[1:13:31] you're texting them you're calling them
[1:13:33] you're spending time with them let me
[1:13:35] tell you something what wins the heart
[1:13:37] is not so much the words you say it's
[1:13:39] the life you live and the presence of
[1:13:42] the Lord the Bible says that when the
[1:13:44] Lord Jesus stood there and he spoke
[1:13:46] those words they men those people had
[1:13:49] had heard words and heard words but the
[1:13:51] Bible said never a man speak like this
[1:13:53] you want to know what was the difference
[1:13:55] the presence of the Lord was
[1:13:57] accompanying what was being said that's
[1:14:01] what's important it's easy we all make
[1:14:06] mistakes what I'll say a man for you
[1:14:15] that's not that's not a cop-out but
[1:14:20] we're not out of to make converts out of
[1:14:24] his government this message is not a
[1:14:27] government the gospel of Jesus Christ is
[1:14:31] not a government if that's the viewpoint
[1:14:35] it becomes a lifestyle you understand in
[1:14:39] the message baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:41] the profits for you can have he say here
[1:14:43] you have the sisters with the long
[1:14:44] dresses and along here that said praise
[1:14:46] God but then he also deals deeper than
[1:14:49] just what you see on the outside he goes
[1:14:52] into the issues of the heart see it's
[1:14:56] deeper than what outward conformity
[1:14:58] that's that is not the role the role is
[1:15:03] bad on the inside and then the outside
[1:15:05] will reflect it you see when the desires
[1:15:10] when God deals with your heart by the
[1:15:12] word and you see something that's not
[1:15:14] right then immediately say Lord forgive
[1:15:16] me cleanse me Lord die to that thing
[1:15:19] right there tonight with the presence of
[1:15:21] the Lord that has revealed that because
[1:15:24] in that is liberty they had lost the
[1:15:31] fear of the Lord and what's this they
[1:15:34] lost the fear of the Lord because look
[1:15:36] the presence of the Living God
[1:15:38] look here Isaiah Isaiah prophet Isaiah
[1:15:41] comes into the temple he had already saw
[1:15:44] a man by the name of Uzziah this guy how
[1:15:48] the Bible said he was marvelously helped
[1:15:51] of the Lord but he got to a place - he
[1:15:55] got the thinking he did it all what was
[1:15:59] happening presumptuous sins he got to
[1:16:02] acting his door was something he did
[1:16:04] Isaiah saw this say God had to allow
[1:16:08] that to be removed amen and Isaiah comes
[1:16:13] into the presence of the Lord I said
[1:16:15] don't won the first time in the temple
[1:16:18] but this day was a different day
[1:16:21] he came into the temple that day and the
[1:16:23] post the pillars were moved the presence
[1:16:28] of God the train filled the temple the
[1:16:30] same one that Ezekiel saw the same one
[1:16:33] John saw in the Book of Revelations that
[1:16:34] same one was present there and his
[1:16:38] presence noticed his presence his
[1:16:41] presence caused Isaiah to say woe is me
[1:16:48] Isaiah had been reading the word but
[1:16:51] when it came and said well it's me a man
[1:16:56] of unclean lips God brought from his
[1:17:01] presence there came a confession and
[1:17:04] after there was a confession then the
[1:17:08] angel one of them went to the altar and
[1:17:11] took a live cold not a cold cold of a
[1:17:19] fire from the previous day but it was a
[1:17:23] live coal and is that if he put it upon
[1:17:28] my lips and this has purged and when
[1:17:34] that had come the Spirit of God spoke
[1:17:37] once again and said and let it be known
[1:17:39] the condition and the situation who go
[1:17:43] for me and Isaiah said here am I send me
[1:17:47] what was it that was the inner man on
[1:17:50] the inside here am I send me
[1:17:54] what was it the cloud and everything
[1:17:56] else was clouding over that inner man
[1:17:59] that inner man in the presence of God
[1:18:02] it recognizes who he is what he is
[1:18:06] ordained to do comes out just like the
[1:18:09] fruit upon Aaron's rod it makes itself
[1:18:12] known this is where the prophet and I
[1:18:17] want you just to think of this the
[1:18:21] Prophet would speak in the message
[1:18:25] rapture at the very first part of that
[1:18:26] message and he would speak to the people
[1:18:29] and say I've never been guilty of trying
[1:18:33] to say something
[1:18:34] to please the people encouraging the
[1:18:37] people and pleasing the people are two
[1:18:39] different things
[1:18:41] you say brother samba
[1:18:43] but we understand that but I think
[1:18:45] sometimes we don't understand that I
[1:18:47] think sometimes it is clouding to us
[1:18:50] because to please would mean to make
[1:18:53] happy but to encourage encourage is to
[1:18:58] encourage in what belongs to you this is
[1:19:03] where brother branham will pick up in
[1:19:04] the church age book in the Ephesian age
[1:19:06] and he picks up on the subheading
[1:19:08] praises his own brother m said we as
[1:19:12] pastors as ministers has husbands could
[1:19:17] learn a lot right here t taking the
[1:19:21] spiritual and application where it's not
[1:19:23] just a letter but it's to be a pulsation
[1:19:26] of life that it's not just saying it
[1:19:28] cherish but it pulsates out through us
[1:19:30] of how to run our homes he said to
[1:19:34] priests praise to encourage praise is
[1:19:39] not to please
[1:19:40] praises to lift up it's to encourage
[1:19:50] my guess we just need to take the
[1:19:52] separate service on that it's very
[1:19:57] important he says I've never been guilty
[1:20:02] of that but he said rather and I want
[1:20:06] you to listen to my desire is to say
[1:20:08] something that would further your
[1:20:12] experience with God if you're a
[1:20:14] Christian and if you're not a Christian
[1:20:19] make you ashamed of yourself then you
[1:20:22] will become a Christian so in a service
[1:20:26] the objective within the word coming
[1:20:29] forth is there to be a furtherance of
[1:20:31] experience and at the same time as
[1:20:34] that's being furthered on it's also
[1:20:37] through that same word to draw a life
[1:20:40] that is not a Christian to a place to be
[1:20:44] ashamed of themselves and say Lord I'm
[1:20:46] not who I need to be Lord and draw him
[1:20:50] unto Him I hope this doesn't stump you
[1:20:59] but let me tell you something God can
[1:21:03] bring souls to him and fill them with
[1:21:05] the Holy Ghost by preaching marriage and
[1:21:07] divorce the word is the word John three
[1:21:14] may not be a text that I read this
[1:21:16] morning but John three is always
[1:21:17] preached a life are you with me
[1:21:23] it's not just something that we wait for
[1:21:25] certain services but we're gonna have
[1:21:27] special services Friday nights gonna be
[1:21:29] this Saturday night
[1:21:29] we don't want forms God deals with
[1:21:34] hearts and lives it's him the word yes
[1:21:40] sir I believe that with all my heart
[1:21:43] this is the word in Matthew 13 and watch
[1:21:46] how the Lord Jesus speaks of this he's
[1:21:50] talking about in verse 14 for sake of
[1:21:52] time of how that this this prophecy of
[1:21:55] Isaiah is being fulfilled in them in
[1:21:58] verse 15 it says for this people's heart
[1:22:01] is waxed
[1:22:03] gross and their ears are dull of hearing
[1:22:07] and their eyes they have closed lest at
[1:22:12] any time they should see with their eyes
[1:22:14] and hear with their ears and should
[1:22:17] understand with their heart and should
[1:22:19] be converted and I should heal them
[1:22:24] this people's heart is waxed gross
[1:22:27] what's gross means to make thick to make
[1:22:32] fat or fat metaphor metaphorically to
[1:22:35] make stupid to render the soul dull or
[1:22:38] callous their heart this is what was
[1:22:43] even said in Isaiah 29 their heart was
[1:22:46] removed far from me what kind of heart
[1:22:49] is that a calloused heart a fat heart
[1:22:53] you with me
[1:22:55] you see when he made the statement they
[1:22:59] that here in the scriptures that less
[1:23:02] they should understand with their heart
[1:23:04] and should be converted and I should
[1:23:06] heal them here is the very first part
[1:23:08] it's the heart God comes to deal with
[1:23:10] the heart
[1:23:12] he wasn't looking at all their robes and
[1:23:15] all their accomplishments and all this
[1:23:17] he come to deal with their heart that's
[1:23:21] the same way I'm glad he does that yet
[1:23:24] this morning he doesn't look at all of
[1:23:27] our compliments oh they've been serving
[1:23:29] me here for let me see here 30 years oh
[1:23:32] there there okay no I always loved how
[1:23:37] the Prophet opens up in prayer and
[1:23:38] invisible Union naturally begins he
[1:23:40] begins to talk about different ones
[1:23:41] that's going on he said Oh God
[1:23:43] let the Great Holy Spirit come in here
[1:23:45] this morning and search on our hearts
[1:23:47] and Lord don't leave mine out
[1:23:52] don't leave mine out Lord Sutch mine too
[1:23:56] David said search me and try me Lord and
[1:24:01] see if there be any wicked way in me we
[1:24:05] might want nicer words but David put it
[1:24:07] out and need to be put yes sir now these
[1:24:14] people they didn't think they needed to
[1:24:15] be saved they just thought they were
[1:24:18] rapture ready they didn't know they
[1:24:22] needed to be saved they didn't know
[1:24:24] there had to come a change you see what
[1:24:29] they didn't know they didn't know they
[1:24:30] had been bitten by the serpent as well
[1:24:33] they didn't realize that your natural
[1:24:36] birth even though you might have come
[1:24:39] through and traced your stock back and
[1:24:41] said we're Abraham's seed but I want you
[1:24:43] to know that your great great great
[1:24:45] great great however mark back to Abraham
[1:24:47] he was still born in sin and shaped in
[1:24:50] iniquity he needed a redeemer he needed
[1:24:53] blood just like you need blood you see
[1:24:58] what even hid when he was tying them in
[1:24:59] and letting them know that your life is
[1:25:01] not pulsating with all of those that
[1:25:06] have gone before where they were
[1:25:08] pulsating in the promise uh pterence
[1:25:13] would come through them a further
[1:25:16] opening of the promise making clear to
[1:25:18] the elect God's ordained pathway they
[1:25:22] did not recognize that their greatest
[1:25:25] enemy was themselves
[1:25:28] they didn't see the greatest enemy was
[1:25:31] their first birth they didn't see that
[1:25:34] they looked at the greatest enemy get
[1:25:36] rid of these Romans get all these people
[1:25:38] away from me get all this away
[1:25:43] that was a flee compared to their first
[1:25:46] verse the other said a greater army
[1:25:50] could come in and expel the Romans a
[1:25:52] greater powerful army to come in and
[1:25:55] expel it but guess what if that victory
[1:25:58] don't last they needed a true victory
[1:26:03] day in their soul it was prophesied all
[1:26:09] the way down through the scriptures on
[1:26:11] salvation coming to Israel and Isaiah 52
[1:26:14] even when the Spirit of God would speak
[1:26:17] through Isaiah and speak of how that
[1:26:19] Israel was brought into bondage yet they
[1:26:21] did not see themselves in bondage
[1:26:25] remember when the Lord Jesus here he was
[1:26:28] he's standing there and he lets some of
[1:26:30] them know who started to follow him he
[1:26:33] said if you continue in my word then
[1:26:38] you're my disciples indeed so there were
[1:26:42] some who started that really were not
[1:26:45] disciples indeed they were disciples but
[1:26:50] they never became indeed indeed meaning
[1:26:54] without pretense or false simulation it
[1:26:59] became true how by the word that was
[1:27:04] being made manifest pulsating would
[1:27:06] bring them into the promise of the
[1:27:10] person of truth himself he said the
[1:27:14] truth you shall know look what he says
[1:27:15] if you shall know the truth and the
[1:27:18] truth shall make you free immediately
[1:27:21] when he said that they got angry this is
[1:27:30] a promise from the word I guarantee when
[1:27:34] they read that promise in the wire it
[1:27:36] didn't make him feel that way it didn't
[1:27:41] I never forget a brother one time you
[1:27:43] know he he went here too he went and
[1:27:45] went into a church a pastor and here he
[1:27:47] goes into a situation you have if you
[1:27:49] have a family a husband and a wife you
[1:27:51] know they're laying out of church and
[1:27:52] come back and in and out and everything
[1:27:54] else it goes to him and begins to talk
[1:27:56] to him about being you know and you know
[1:27:58] how the Prophet said when if the love of
[1:28:00] God's in your heart and the sister said
[1:28:08] that makes me mad and the brother said
[1:28:14] sister he said I'm only saying what the
[1:28:16] prophet said and this is what she said
[1:28:18] when he says that it doesn't bother me
[1:28:21] but when you say it it makes me mad I
[1:28:28] don't give the individuals name it's not
[1:28:30] hearsay you see see this is different
[1:28:34] when the white we're just reading it but
[1:28:36] when that word becomes flesh and the
[1:28:38] word is bringing a discernment to a
[1:28:40] situation in a life that's different we
[1:28:46] can listen to it on the tape we can read
[1:28:47] in the book so let me tell you something
[1:28:49] you need to be listening to the word if
[1:28:51] you're not giving yourself to the
[1:28:52] message you need to be feeding on the
[1:28:54] word you know it ought to be something
[1:28:56] that you crave and you desire and
[1:28:58] realize you know but say I need to do
[1:29:00] this and I need to read this book and I
[1:29:02] need to rape this book forgive me
[1:29:04] no don't forgive me let me be very clear
[1:29:06] put your devotionals aside and bury
[1:29:09] yourself in the message of the hour then
[1:29:13] devotionals are written by men that are
[1:29:15] moved by their intellect on the
[1:29:17] scripture let me tell you something we
[1:29:19] have we have received a message from God
[1:29:22] that is the scriptures
[1:29:26] hated it they may have you on a real
[1:29:30] devotional take out the token you want
[1:29:33] another devotional they got the
[1:29:35] exposition of the seven churches
[1:29:37] you want another devotion just once more
[1:29:40] Lord hello it may not tickle your ears
[1:29:47] but it'll stir yourself it'll give you a
[1:29:50] Dominion a Dominion in your life because
[1:29:55] this message may man is the issuing in
[1:29:58] of the kingdom of all my reward is the
[1:30:01] issuing end of the millennium that
[1:30:09] seventh piece that third peak he carries
[1:30:13] clear to the Continental Divide right
[1:30:17] now is a reflection of that ruling we're
[1:30:24] going to a millennium
[1:30:28] you see it's carrying us into a promises
[1:30:35] who Floridita college
[1:30:39] you love him these promises that were
[1:30:46] made known the Jubilee they knew these
[1:30:49] things they knew they could talk about
[1:30:53] him but they knew it is only a fourth
[1:30:56] they didn't know it as an application
[1:31:07] they looked i just want to place myself
[1:31:09] here they looked and they said or
[1:31:12] abraham seed we never been in bondage
[1:31:15] see any man he never been in bondage
[1:31:20] yeah we think our ancestors came out of
[1:31:23] Babylon we never been in bondage we were
[1:31:26] born right here Jesus said a whole mind
[1:31:35] well were they educated they knew about
[1:31:41] Moses they knew the writings of Moses
[1:31:43] but look what had happened their heart
[1:31:47] it wasn't the writings of Moses let me
[1:31:49] let me just drop this very clear it
[1:31:51] wasn't the law that did this it wasn't
[1:31:56] the law it wasn't the writings of Moses
[1:31:59] that did this it was their own hearts
[1:32:03] being moved away literally didn't start
[1:32:07] banging all of a sudden he started out
[1:32:10] little by little by little by a slight
[1:32:16] deviation started out small and here
[1:32:24] what you find when the Lord Jesus has
[1:32:26] come he's revealing if I can say it in
[1:32:29] tight what the horse riders have done
[1:32:31] he's revealing and uncovering Satan's
[1:32:35] working he's revealing demons in a
[1:32:39] religious realm he's addressing enticing
[1:32:43] spirits that are versing the Word of God
[1:32:46] when I speak in tongues in taxing
[1:32:49] spirits versing the Word of God if that
[1:32:51] is what you base on and it allows you to
[1:32:54] assert yourself above the word it's an
[1:32:56] enticing spirit
[1:32:59] well I believe brother ran was a prophet
[1:33:01] and you'd believe that and your life is
[1:33:03] not submissive and the life's not
[1:33:05] reflected that's an enticing spirit we
[1:33:13] don't want to be like them oh we're in
[1:33:16] the message bondage cannot come to us
[1:33:20] really right there is the attitude of
[1:33:24] bondage that's pride its pride our
[1:33:29] learning is not what makes us undeceive
[1:33:31] about we're ordained by God not to be
[1:33:34] deceived but within that our dependency
[1:33:37] is upon the Holy Ghost as the leader of
[1:33:41] the Church of the Living God
[1:33:43] he'll never lead us outside of the word
[1:33:45] a spirit that'll take it and try to lead
[1:33:49] it outside of the word I don't care if
[1:33:51] it's bearing quotes and then quotes take
[1:33:53] you East from West and it doesn't line
[1:33:55] up with the scripture it's a false
[1:33:56] spirit yes sir
[1:34:00] one little deviation from the truth the
[1:34:04] Spirit of Truth when he has come he
[1:34:06] leads and guides us into all truth he
[1:34:14] let him know you are you you that he
[1:34:17] said as a being whosoever committeth sin
[1:34:19] as a servant of sin he let him know the
[1:34:22] servant he's telling him their position
[1:34:25] where you are you're a servant right now
[1:34:27] you did survey your hearing no insight
[1:34:31] the servant abideth not in the house
[1:34:33] forever but the son abideth forever why
[1:34:37] the Sun bears the name of the father's
[1:34:41] house and he realizes I have come in my
[1:34:46] father's name who I see the house of God
[1:34:51] amen this was the house of God
[1:34:54] this was the promises that had been
[1:34:56] spoken now those promises were no longer
[1:34:59] just print but now they had become a
[1:35:02] place for one to dwell and becoming a
[1:35:07] place for one did well he's there to
[1:35:08] minister an entrance into that promise
[1:35:13] they listened they had no pulsation of
[1:35:17] fear within them they had no pulsation
[1:35:20] of real truth fear within them they run
[1:35:24] some how can you how could you say that
[1:35:26] because they so easily took from the
[1:35:29] Word of God and the Word of God has
[1:35:34] tampered with there's a problem with the
[1:35:36] heart it's a problem with the heart the
[1:35:43] Bible says it like this in Psalms 119
[1:35:46] verse 69 the proud have forged a lie
[1:35:50] against me but I will keep that precepts
[1:35:53] with my whole heart their heart is as
[1:35:56] fat as grease but I delight in that
[1:36:00] their heart is this fat as grease the
[1:36:07] heart is this word fat means it's
[1:36:10] insensitive you know one of the things
[1:36:17] when you get to looking at probably some
[1:36:18] of you've looked at this already one of
[1:36:20] the things that their leading
[1:36:21] cardiologist right now have discovered
[1:36:24] years just some just some years back and
[1:36:26] they're putting it forth right now do
[1:36:28] you remember how many of us will maybe
[1:36:29] not many of us maybe there's a lot of us
[1:36:31] that were raised like this that
[1:36:33] saturated fat is the enemy right the
[1:36:38] truth of them the truth be known as
[1:36:40] they're bringing it out it wasn't that
[1:36:41] it's the carbohydrates that are the true
[1:36:45] enemy now that doesn't mean that you can
[1:36:47] go order your porterhouse and sit down
[1:36:48] with a carb filled potato there's a
[1:36:52] right way to do it now
[1:36:54] I'm not holding lessons on it either but
[1:36:57] if you'd like me but if you'd like to
[1:36:58] invite me over I can show you how to eat
[1:36:59] that steak I like mine fixed well done
[1:37:04] by the way with all the trimmings but
[1:37:08] they're finding that what it is that's
[1:37:09] clogging up the arteries is better than
[1:37:11] carb food you know all the foods that
[1:37:14] sometimes our body it actually craves
[1:37:16] almost like an addiction come on
[1:37:19] somebody
[1:37:20] tell me y'all getting quiet listen this
[1:37:23] is not doctrine it's not doctoral so
[1:37:25] don't go home and throw your cakes away
[1:37:26] and don't go into the depot and turning
[1:37:28] over the tables of sweets but this is
[1:37:33] why I look at this here that heart had
[1:37:38] become fat not from hearing the meat of
[1:37:42] the word the heart had become fattened
[1:37:46] by the sweetness of which it was
[1:37:51] presented it tickled the ears they had
[1:37:58] no fear in what they were saying of how
[1:38:00] they would take from the word and what
[1:38:02] did it do it produced its what people
[1:38:04] wanted to hear that's why the Bible says
[1:38:07] they have itching years in this day they
[1:38:11] will not stand still for sound doctrine
[1:38:14] is that right what had they done they
[1:38:21] had taken as the Prophet goes in and
[1:38:23] bringing this out and world's falling
[1:38:25] apart again I'll just just referring to
[1:38:27] some of those places they didn't think
[1:38:29] they needed to be saved and when they
[1:38:33] came here God gave them a baby that was
[1:38:36] a promise behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:38:40] this was not something that was obscure
[1:38:43] that was written in the word God had
[1:38:47] given them promises so that there was
[1:38:49] for that day but they did not see it it
[1:38:56] was a marian of joseph then when it
[1:38:59] became time for that promise to be
[1:39:01] fulfilled it started just kind of like
[1:39:07] he started Paul seeing through Marisa
[1:39:11] yeah the rabbi down there they said I
[1:39:14] don't move like he used to move Mary
[1:39:18] Joseph what does the Prophet mean when
[1:39:21] he said behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:39:25] the Prophet said Joseph looked her and
[1:39:28] said Mary that's too deep for me but one
[1:39:31] thing we know is it's God's Word and
[1:39:33] God's words can't fail he said that is
[1:39:36] the prophets words glory one no pride
[1:39:43] there I don't understand that never been
[1:39:46] done before
[1:39:47] but asked him after it happened
[1:39:53] ask him after happened he knew about it
[1:39:57] then lie they no longer was just writing
[1:39:59] it had become a pulsation for his life
[1:40:02] it became such a pulsation through
[1:40:05] Joseph's life till Joseph himself became
[1:40:08] one with the promise that had
[1:40:10] impregnated Mary and he said I'll be her
[1:40:12] shield I will be a shield for this word
[1:40:21] dwell in me hello children to be one of
[1:40:24] the horns on the lamb to be as
[1:40:27] protection
[1:40:27] the Lambs rights protected upon this
[1:40:30] earth how is it protected not by
[1:40:33] copyright it's protected by the
[1:40:35] indwelling of the Holy Ghost men have
[1:40:39] tried they've copyrighted this they've
[1:40:40] done this they've done that that has not
[1:40:42] protected it
[1:40:43] what has protected the real real reality
[1:40:46] of it the Holy Ghost dwelling in the
[1:40:49] hearts they thought they were saved they
[1:40:58] needed saving they had so excommunicated
[1:41:06] the Holy Ghost from the church in their
[1:41:10] day they took promises and they made
[1:41:14] traditions out of it you see within if I
[1:41:20] can say it like this because remember
[1:41:22] children are born by the presence of God
[1:41:27] God's presence is his word being
[1:41:30] revealed let me tell you something just
[1:41:33] because in their churches it was dead
[1:41:34] didn't mean that God was dead
[1:41:37] there was a man by the name of Simeon
[1:41:43] they fell on the Holy Ghost and he
[1:41:46] revealed to Simeon by the Spirit of God
[1:41:50] siming you're not going to die till you
[1:41:53] see the Lord's Christ it was a promise
[1:41:58] he was already Simeon I'm telling you
[1:42:02] unlike the rest ever they might have
[1:42:03] been reading the same promises that
[1:42:05] Simeon was reading but there was
[1:42:06] different there was electrical impulses
[1:42:08] going through simians life pulsations
[1:42:16] that was moving and that and pulsation
[1:42:19] moved through his life and his testimony
[1:42:21] was I'm not gonna die til I see the
[1:42:23] Lord's Christ here he was setting he
[1:42:26] went being went to every day he went
[1:42:28] there no doubt setting in the office
[1:42:29] every day all of a sudden one day the
[1:42:33] same voice that spoke to him stand on
[1:42:36] your feet Simeon send me a new because
[1:42:41] why the law the word was not just a
[1:42:43] letter he had a relationship of what was
[1:42:48] permitted and given in that hour just
[1:42:53] like we read of David and night Psalms
[1:42:54] and I team then he directed him right to
[1:42:58] the fulfillment of that promise you see
[1:43:02] within it how that the Lord Jesus
[1:43:04] himself here he was standing there and
[1:43:07] as we as we mentioned moments ago when
[1:43:09] he spoke about when they were confusing
[1:43:12] him of your your your your disciples
[1:43:15] their transgressing the tradition of the
[1:43:17] elders and the Lord Jesus himself said
[1:43:23] why do you transgress the commandments
[1:43:25] of God what's greater the elders or the
[1:43:28] commandments he asked them why are you
[1:43:35] transgressing I want you to catch this
[1:43:37] here the Lord Jesus refers to this this
[1:43:39] very thing where they have taken the
[1:43:41] word and instead of holding to the word
[1:43:45] honor father and mother a promise
[1:43:50] the commandment was promised that that
[1:43:52] day's might be long and they took that
[1:43:57] and they altered it to where that it was
[1:44:02] no longer the children looking there to
[1:44:06] the parents in honor but instead it was
[1:44:09] where the children were declaring to the
[1:44:12] parents I'm a gift to you
[1:44:14] that's your Bible right I'm a gift to
[1:44:17] you you see their teaching had so turned
[1:44:21] the order of headship around that
[1:44:25] teaching was a reflection of their life
[1:44:29] you with me that teaching reflected
[1:44:32] their life but they themselves believed
[1:44:36] that they could tell god what to do it's
[1:44:40] a gift
[1:44:41] whereby you might be profited why was
[1:44:43] that why would they have to alter it why
[1:44:45] would they have to change God's Word
[1:44:48] well the same reason that people have to
[1:44:51] change words now to let gays in the
[1:44:52] church and allow all this other stuff in
[1:44:54] the church you want to know why because
[1:44:56] they don't have the power of God to
[1:44:57] stand upon God's Word so they have to
[1:45:01] make compromises on the Word of God
[1:45:03] because they don't know the Living God
[1:45:06] we don't have to back down from what
[1:45:09] promise
[1:45:11] not one promise the same God that gave
[1:45:15] that word the same God listen to me
[1:45:17] that's how you and I but a stand on it
[1:45:20] we're the Prophet himself answers the
[1:45:22] questions and answers and he comes right
[1:45:24] around and he makes it clear in the
[1:45:26] token you're not have the same
[1:45:27] confidence for your children that God
[1:45:30] would deal with them and turn them
[1:45:32] around like the same God did it for you
[1:45:34] you didn't get yourself out of Egypt you
[1:45:37] didn't deliver yourself it was the power
[1:45:39] of God that came down by the blood of
[1:45:41] the Lamb
[1:45:42] in Redemption but what was that they
[1:45:48] didn't have faith in the word they
[1:45:52] didn't believe you know why cuz they
[1:45:56] didn't know God they knew the history of
[1:46:02] the god of Moses are you with me they
[1:46:05] made a tradition out of his life come on
[1:46:09] somebody but you see counting interested
[1:46:12] in traditions God's interested in his
[1:46:16] word coming to pass he'll walk right
[1:46:19] back for dishes God will never come and
[1:46:21] honor a tradition he honors his word is
[1:46:25] that right you see the Bible says that
[1:46:28] the righteousness of God is revealed
[1:46:29] from faith unto faith these people were
[1:46:34] seeking the righteousness of God but
[1:46:36] they weren't seeking it by faith they
[1:46:38] were seeking it by the works of the law
[1:46:40] they were reading the way hearing the
[1:46:43] word in their synagogues but it was a
[1:46:46] mixed but faith there wasn't children
[1:46:51] being born in those synagogues I'm
[1:46:52] talking the children of the promised the
[1:46:54] Lord Jesus identified you took a key and
[1:46:56] you shut the kingdom up and anybody that
[1:46:59] goes to make a step towards it you close
[1:47:01] it off what's he saying that they in
[1:47:04] themselves were hindering the children
[1:47:07] of the promise were not being born you
[1:47:09] said brother Samuel would John went on
[1:47:11] the scene yet for the Lord Jesus but
[1:47:12] remember that there were those who were
[1:47:15] waiting in expectation
[1:47:18] they might have been covered over with
[1:47:20] sin and everything else but they believe
[1:47:23] that when God would fulfill his word and
[1:47:26] God himself would make that word alive
[1:47:30] who takes a woman at the well you
[1:47:33] compare her life to one of those
[1:47:35] Pharisees life the prophets very clear
[1:47:38] on this you couldn't put a finger on
[1:47:39] that Pharisees life I didn't say it's
[1:47:42] hard I said his life Jesus looked at
[1:47:49] their heart and said you're nothing but
[1:47:50] hypocrites whoo glory be to God there
[1:47:56] was no sweet there that was straight
[1:47:57] meat it was uncovering what the rest of
[1:48:03] who was looking at it who MA Wow these
[1:48:06] religious cows and making long pretense
[1:48:09] in prayer and one of her but the
[1:48:12] presence of God was there says come here
[1:48:14] John let me show you something they're
[1:48:18] filled with the blood of the prophets he
[1:48:23] changed the wonderment of those men and
[1:48:26] showed what was behind their robes whoo
[1:48:30] the word was present discerning the
[1:48:33] heart is that right whoa but there was a
[1:48:37] little woman down there by the well and
[1:48:42] when he came talking to her she did act
[1:48:45] like the Pharisees she said widow whose
[1:48:51] Messiah cometh you see what she was God
[1:48:55] she might have been living in sin but
[1:48:57] there was just a little bit of a faint
[1:48:59] pulsation it was not enough brother
[1:49:01] Enoch to bring her to a new life but it
[1:49:03] was something to where she knew there's
[1:49:05] coming a change there's gonna be a
[1:49:07] change with Messias cometh and here she
[1:49:10] is at that moment and
[1:49:11] was a faint pulse at that very moment
[1:49:16] she was brought into the bosom of a
[1:49:19] promise and it became a pulsation in her
[1:49:23] life she went back into the city and
[1:49:30] told him come see a man no pride about
[1:49:33] her come see a man who told me all I
[1:49:35] ever done you you already know me but
[1:49:38] this guy knows all I moved away the
[1:49:52] clown
[1:49:53] she had a genesis beating out
[1:50:09] [Applause]
[1:50:11] hallelujah but here was the GMO
[1:50:18] pharisees genetically modified guys they
[1:50:23] had genetically modified they had
[1:50:26] tampered with the word and yet wanting
[1:50:30] the word to have an effect you can't
[1:50:32] control the effects of the word either
[1:50:35] you want him or you don't want him
[1:50:39] either you do or you don't
[1:50:42] there ain't no halfway they had made it
[1:50:45] nothing but tradition I tell you a
[1:50:48] tradition can never bring down the power
[1:50:50] of God I don't talk about blessings I'm
[1:50:56] talking about the power of God the Holy
[1:51:00] Spirit can pour out and blessings can be
[1:51:02] all over and people and that's why you
[1:51:04] can see and say we loose a man I see
[1:51:05] people dancing in the spirit here I seen
[1:51:07] it at this concert I seen how that
[1:51:08] connoisseur sure the Holy Spirit pouring
[1:51:11] out blessings but I ask you is it the
[1:51:14] power of God because the power of God
[1:51:15] generates a life
[1:51:19] it's one thing to be moved under
[1:51:22] blessings but it's another thing to be
[1:51:24] tied into the Dynamo the generating
[1:51:27] power of Almighty God where it's beating
[1:51:30] out beating out feeding out beating out
[1:51:32] let me tell you something that word
[1:51:33] becomes so real and as becoming so real
[1:51:36] in the bride of Jesus Christ to where
[1:51:38] the temple is not something outside
[1:51:40] she is marching to the tune of onward
[1:51:43] Christian soldiers it is because her
[1:51:45] heart is in tune with the promise what
[1:51:51] the composer has written the seventh
[1:51:55] angel director came and caught the
[1:52:00] inspiration of the composer Bible faith
[1:52:04] was lost but now that director is able
[1:52:08] to be surrendered in the hand of God and
[1:52:10] there's a symphony on earth that can be
[1:52:13] moved by divine action and they're
[1:52:16] finding their position in this greater
[1:52:19] Parliament and beating out the promises
[1:52:21] of God yes sir growing a god hallelujah
[1:52:30] maybe I'll run me later this evening I
[1:52:33] tell you this is so much I tell you what
[1:52:36] you think I act like this here and I'll
[1:52:38] get it back right this here serving or
[1:52:42] my husband Lord the Word of God just
[1:52:44] makes my heart bubble over his presence
[1:52:47] I love nothing more than his presence no
[1:52:52] wonder the Lord Jesus could say blessed
[1:52:55] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[1:52:59] for they hear for many prophets and
[1:53:03] righteous men have desired to see what
[1:53:08] you see what's he letting them know they
[1:53:11] solid in in in divine utterance but they
[1:53:15] didn't get to see it being fulfilled
[1:53:17] many of them honored those things and
[1:53:20] they didn't understand what they were
[1:53:22] saying
[1:53:24] spiritual food in due season he said
[1:53:26] those profits so lived in that word they
[1:53:29] became so wrapped in that word till the
[1:53:31] world and their word was the same
[1:53:35] hallelujah to where he said that even
[1:53:38] their thinking what was being spoken was
[1:53:41] against their own thinking and they
[1:53:45] didn't understand it notice John even
[1:53:48] John speaking out but he didn't
[1:53:50] understand even what he was saying it
[1:53:52] didn't mean that the word wouldn't be
[1:53:53] ineffective little room tent the third
[1:53:59] pulls here God is meeting personally
[1:54:06] with you inside of this little room
[1:54:09] meeting personally has the proper could
[1:54:13] say the one that is here with me he said
[1:54:16] it went and it left me and he went over
[1:54:19] that little room why because it was to
[1:54:21] that uniting time that was being pointed
[1:54:25] to he said I rejoice to hear the voice
[1:54:29] of the bridegroom
[1:54:31] what was the declaration to see a unity
[1:54:35] between the bride and Christ
[1:54:43] the problem is they weren't in love they
[1:54:48] weren't involved they were doing things
[1:54:51] and they weren't in love
[1:54:58] in that terrible gonna be terrible and
[1:55:02] isn't it terrible if what you're doing
[1:55:05] is only because you feel like you have
[1:55:07] to do it you don't have to live that
[1:55:10] kind of life there there's a liberating
[1:55:14] power to free you from that that that's
[1:55:17] not honoring God there's there's a power
[1:55:20] the power of God to liberate you that is
[1:55:22] God's love to work that it's a love
[1:55:27] affair because the Bible itself the
[1:55:30] Bible it's a supernatural book the
[1:55:35] prophets very clearly said you've fallen
[1:55:37] in love with him then he'll reveal fall
[1:55:41] in love with him first in your review
[1:55:42] and he gives always the illustration you
[1:55:44] remember when he was riding back and
[1:55:45] forth to him and meaty and meaty wood
[1:55:47] right you know I'm sitting here and they
[1:55:49] see that and he said because I love her
[1:55:51] I can read between the lines
[1:55:57] because what how does he mean I love her
[1:56:00] he loves her he doesn't have to to see
[1:56:04] and be there physically but he loves her
[1:56:07] he knows her nature yes he knows her
[1:56:11] character he knows her lights and he
[1:56:16] knows her dislikes that's the same way
[1:56:19] in love of farriers
[1:56:21] with the bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:56:24] the same kind of love affair that God
[1:56:27] desires within a people remember when he
[1:56:30] came there among them and here they were
[1:56:32] as people in that time you know there's
[1:56:34] a book when they read the word he wasn't
[1:56:36] prophesy to him in one prophecy to him
[1:56:39] it was just letters of do this and don't
[1:56:42] do that and we ties on this and do this
[1:56:44] and we don't do that and we'd go to
[1:56:46] widows house and me long for our
[1:56:48] everything was just formality
[1:56:50] ceremonialism let me tell you friends if
[1:56:55] you think that net in your life and
[1:56:58] think that here that it can't become
[1:57:01] ceremonialism you're highly mistaken
[1:57:03] let me just say this to you don't don't
[1:57:06] don't don't freeze up on me now I'm not
[1:57:08] against you I'm trying to help you the
[1:57:11] things of this world all the cares of
[1:57:13] this world the things we will even the
[1:57:15] trials that we've been ministry on
[1:57:16] Thursday night sometimes those things
[1:57:18] want to come to try to deaden us to get
[1:57:20] us to a place to where we're just going
[1:57:23] through the motions we don't want to
[1:57:25] just go through the motions listen if
[1:57:27] you feel like you're just going through
[1:57:29] the motions God don't despise you but
[1:57:32] God's trying to let you know hey ask me
[1:57:34] restore unto me the joy of that
[1:57:38] salvation he's wants to help you said he
[1:57:44] said they were stiff-necked and
[1:57:45] uncircumcised in hearts and ears is that
[1:57:47] right they were uncircumcised remember
[1:57:51] the circumcision was to cut the fat away
[1:57:53] from the heart
[1:57:55] the dauntlessly in sensitiveness they
[1:58:00] had received this law by the disposition
[1:58:02] of angels this was not just Moses going
[1:58:06] up into the mount the hosts of the Lord
[1:58:08] were there he meant he received the
[1:58:12] disposition of the law by angels glory
[1:58:18] be to God we have received a message
[1:58:22] that was brought to us by angels
[1:58:27] any man those angels that turned his wig
[1:58:32] are you with me
[1:58:34] hey men it was not it was not the gas
[1:58:37] from a rocket no sir
[1:58:40] those angels the prophets said those
[1:58:43] telescopes on Mount Lemmon
[1:58:44] they caught the cloud coming in it came
[1:58:48] from the west to the east why it had to
[1:58:50] come for you and I but the angels were
[1:58:54] already there waiting on the prophet and
[1:58:56] after the visitation the prophet said
[1:58:59] they caught it coming in but they didn't
[1:59:01] catch it easy
[1:59:03] the world has heard about a message that
[1:59:06] has come but the message of sticks in
[1:59:08] the leaves there is a people that is
[1:59:11] ordained Baptist word to be caught up in
[1:59:15] a moment and a twinkling of an eye the
[1:59:17] world they'll be missing people all over
[1:59:19] the world and the world will never know
[1:59:21] about it what is it a rapturing message
[1:59:25] catch you away if that terminology is
[1:59:30] new to you let me just make it simple a
[1:59:32] rapturing message is that where Christ
[1:59:35] Himself comes into your life and
[1:59:37] completely ignites your soul on fire to
[1:59:41] where the world is completely dead and
[1:59:43] the pulsation of your life is Jesus
[1:59:46] Christ it's not church or Church entity
[1:59:48] or religion but he is your life and
[1:59:51] becomes the very theme of your life
[1:59:54] that's a raptured life when Jesus came
[2:00:01] to him yeah you know many times you know
[2:00:05] I have many times when Jesus came they
[2:00:07] want to kill him they sure did they
[2:00:11] sought to kill him but they couldn't get
[2:00:14] to him and went till his time was up
[2:00:18] there's nothing can touch you there's
[2:00:20] nothing can touch me
[2:00:21] until our time is up and as the Prophet
[2:00:25] is said so say I so say we my time is up
[2:00:28] my purpose is done I'm ready to go he
[2:00:35] told him he says you have not the love
[2:00:38] of God in your heart they didn't have
[2:00:41] the love of God in their heart no they
[2:00:46] were reading but they did not have his
[2:00:48] love say they weren't reading it as a
[2:00:51] love letter Jesus could tell him you've
[2:00:53] never heard his voice nor have you seen
[2:00:56] his shape the word was if I could say it
[2:01:00] in the right way well am I saying
[2:01:01] 1-dimensional the word was just like
[2:01:03] this but - David David was eaten on this
[2:01:07] word is sweeter than honey and the
[2:01:12] honeycomb you know David knew about
[2:01:14] eating honey and honeycomb hallelujah
[2:01:23] glory be to God
[2:01:25] they didn't know his shape didn't know
[2:01:27] his farm they didn't know his voice
[2:01:31] never forget a brother who's trying to
[2:01:33] make an illustration when that one he
[2:01:34] was preaching and he had he had two he
[2:01:37] had that the sister come up here you
[2:01:39] know him so the sister he'd had the
[2:01:40] sister you know call on somebody's name
[2:01:44] you know she you know call out a name
[2:01:47] and then eventually here call her
[2:01:50] husband's me they trying to make this
[2:01:52] work right the preacher woman and he
[2:01:54] answer husband he said I'm sorry I got
[2:01:56] it wrong
[2:01:58] he had the husband's what he had the
[2:02:00] husband's wife up here and he pointed to
[2:02:02] somebody this other sister and she said
[2:02:05] his name pointed his sister she said
[2:02:07] he's name and wife and the wife said his
[2:02:10] name and the brother said he said now
[2:02:12] which one he said I don't know he
[2:02:16] shoulda knew his wife's voice
[2:02:18] what brother got in trouble then I'm
[2:02:20] sure but Abraxas I don't see him
[2:02:33] physically yet but I hear his voice
[2:02:36] coming over the heels I hear you this is
[2:02:47] a time of Resurrection the turtle doubts
[2:02:50] are given forth she's aware of the
[2:02:54] seasons and the times she's aware of
[2:02:56] what to be looking for you see it's not
[2:02:59] just written words she sees nature
[2:03:01] nature is letting her know what is its
[2:03:05] pulsation glory be to God I know you
[2:03:10] have not the love of God in you hold
[2:03:12] mine you love him let me just let me
[2:03:18] just skip the Lord Jesus is working with
[2:03:28] the disciples and I wanted to show this
[2:03:31] we've seen here aware of people within
[2:03:34] themselves they had become hardened the
[2:03:38] scripture said the hearts went grouse
[2:03:40] and in other parts of the scripture who
[2:03:43] used the word term hard they had
[2:03:45] hardened their hearts the Lord Jesus you
[2:03:48] can read this letter later just let me
[2:03:49] refer to it in mark 6 and also mark 8
[2:03:53] the Lord Jesus when there was a need for
[2:03:59] for when they came when he they were out
[2:04:02] on the ship the way mark records it
[2:04:03] around the boat remember the Lord Jesus
[2:04:05] had taken a rest and they're out there
[2:04:07] on the boat on this underst on the ship
[2:04:10] waves begin to come all the story and
[2:04:13] they hear he begins to come he knows
[2:04:15] where they're at and he walks across the
[2:04:17] water and as he comes across the water
[2:04:21] he comes to them and rumor they thought
[2:04:23] he was a spirit and they thought he was
[2:04:26] a spirit he lets it know be of good
[2:04:28] cheer it is I be not afraid and he spoke
[2:04:34] those words to them and he came into the
[2:04:36] boat and he could see they were still
[2:04:37] troubled and the Lord Jesus speaks it in
[2:04:41] this manner and he says why are your
[2:04:44] hearts hardened he's talking to the
[2:04:48] disciples hardened meaning they weren't
[2:04:51] understanding I want you to catch this
[2:04:57] this message is so perfect the Prophet
[2:05:02] says in the message of the seals I
[2:05:03] believe it's a third seal he said
[2:05:05] anybody can see it that wants to see it
[2:05:08] in Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[2:05:11] says oh not just to say that this is
[2:05:13] just for this group of people here but
[2:05:15] anybody who wants to see it so this is
[2:05:18] not a closed event it's open you want to
[2:05:24] Liberty it's being blasted oh you're
[2:05:30] right
[2:05:31] he says hard why are your hearts
[2:05:34] hardened then he comes over a chapter
[2:05:36] later and he's talking about he's
[2:05:39] talking to them about the remember when
[2:05:42] he talked about when he told him beware
[2:05:43] of the leaven of the Pharisees and he
[2:05:45] tells him that remember they start
[2:05:46] reasoning in their hearts because we
[2:05:47] didn't take any bread I wonder if
[2:05:49] there's that because we didn't take any
[2:05:50] bread
[2:05:50] see he's speaking on a spiritual level
[2:05:52] they're reasoning in a natural listen
[2:05:53] now he's in a spiritual level they're in
[2:05:56] a natural there's got to be someone
[2:05:59] there to bring them up where he is he's
[2:06:03] trying to bring them out of the level
[2:06:05] that they're in the level they're in it
[2:06:08] shows a hardening but yet he's there to
[2:06:11] tenderize
[2:06:14] for he makes here's what he does he
[2:06:17] refers them back to he said you don't
[2:06:21] you know said don't remember is that why
[2:06:23] he says your heart hardened he asked him
[2:06:25] that again don't you remember he said
[2:06:27] how many baskets how many fragments a
[2:06:29] bread did you take up twelve Lord how
[2:06:32] many on the other time when we fed the
[2:06:34] other five thousand five Lord
[2:06:36] what's he you say oh say me what does
[2:06:38] that have to do a hardening of what he's
[2:06:39] trying to get him to see
[2:06:42] that what they're looking for and what
[2:06:45] they have need of and what has been done
[2:06:47] is to build their faith to believe God
[2:06:52] for right now to lift them out of this
[2:06:58] realm to where they're not sensitive but
[2:07:02] to bring them into that realm where all
[2:07:05] things are possible so here he comes to
[2:07:09] do what bring them into that place this
[2:07:11] is why even look how he handles John the
[2:07:14] Baptist when John the Baptist remember
[2:07:16] go ask if he's he or do we look for
[2:07:18] another right
[2:07:20] he was offended and no stump you does it
[2:07:25] John was offended because things weren't
[2:07:27] happening the way he thought they ought
[2:07:30] to happen there's a lot of things that
[2:07:33] have happened and been happening in our
[2:07:35] life that we didn't think that was the
[2:07:37] way but it was happening anyhow you
[2:07:39] can't stop the word I wonder how many
[2:07:45] lives were Lord God at the end of this
[2:07:47] service Lord I really Lord I'm gonna
[2:07:49] give my life I really want the Holy
[2:07:51] Ghost before they even get on their seat
[2:07:52] they had it you say brother Samuel
[2:07:57] what's important is that they got it yes
[2:08:00] it will make manifest itself is that
[2:08:04] right so how did the Lord Jesus handle
[2:08:07] this here what do you say yeah give me
[2:08:10] give me some witnesses you go tell him
[2:08:12] what you've seen and heard you know what
[2:08:16] he had confidence that all they have to
[2:08:19] do is talk about the word that's being
[2:08:21] fulfilled it will break the scales
[2:08:25] around the eyes of John why John's
[2:08:28] already in contact with the pulsation he
[2:08:34] just needed a little quickening oh yeah
[2:08:37] that was like a defibrillator it gave
[2:08:42] John charge charge for what he can lay
[2:08:44] his head on the platter
[2:08:47] ha here were the disciple I know I'm
[2:08:53] closing Hakka skipped a lot but here
[2:08:56] he's walking on the road of Emmaus
[2:08:58] what's these hearts they come out no you
[2:09:02] a stranger here what does he say old
[2:09:05] fools slow of heart to believe all that
[2:09:08] the prophets have said concerning what
[2:09:12] did he do he took them into the world
[2:09:15] they were a part of that water so how
[2:09:21] are you going to bring that farm there
[2:09:23] to life how are you going to quicken
[2:09:25] that how are you going to bring that
[2:09:27] into place bring the word that is they
[2:09:30] are a part of that's why no other
[2:09:34] message will take an effect upon you it
[2:09:38] has to be the inspiration that has been
[2:09:41] prophesied for this hour and that's why
[2:09:44] the Ministry of the word is the prophecy
[2:09:46] of this hour that has been spoken now
[2:09:49] coming to flesh all orchestrated by the
[2:09:54] angel of the Lord to him be the glory
[2:09:59] aren't you glad aren't you glad then
[2:10:03] when our hearts would maybe get a little
[2:10:04] harder a little Callister little aren't
[2:10:06] you glad that the angel of the Lord will
[2:10:08] just draw right in here and what does he
[2:10:10] do he helps us he lifts us out of this
[2:10:13] realm into that realm hallelujah you and
[2:10:17] I would try to grab on the fence pour
[2:10:19] ourselves up to the fence I see an
[2:10:21] elephant in the ring pull ourselves back
[2:10:24] up but all when one stronger than us
[2:10:28] gets a hold he can lift us up and we see
[2:10:31] things the way way off to see it why he
[2:10:35] has hit me in his pavilion in the secret
[2:10:38] of his Tabernacle upon this rock we
[2:10:41] stand
[2:10:43] lift it up
[2:10:45] to see those things we could not have
[2:10:49] sinned there but he came this rapturing
[2:10:53] message brings us in sin
[2:10:55] it brings us up from just walking around
[2:10:58] has just mere mortals we are mortal
[2:11:01] still we battle with this mortality we
[2:11:04] battle callousness we battle that
[2:11:06] hardness you say man but there's nothing
[2:11:14] that can defeat the purpose
[2:11:23] god never called us to a church life he
[2:11:29] wants our line not just bone of his bone
[2:11:38] flesh of his flesh life to reflect you
[2:11:46] know you see friends that's why the
[2:11:50] message it's not something that's been
[2:11:53] made to be different some of you that
[2:11:56] are new some of you that's been coming
[2:11:57] for a few years you've heard that term
[2:11:59] over and over and over but I'm saying
[2:12:02] this to you the message is the original
[2:12:06] message of Jesus Christ and his
[2:12:09] righteousness
[2:12:11] it's what had been lost now has been
[2:12:15] restored back to the Church of the
[2:12:18] Living God that life Satan has always
[2:12:22] been after the life you know why because
[2:12:26] he cannot stand before that life
[2:12:30] he can't these powers before that life
[2:12:35] God's life in you by the baptism of the
[2:12:40] Holy Ghost
[2:12:40] you are
[2:12:44] and I'm telling you this right now this
[2:12:46] morning we don't have to alter that
[2:12:48] promise he's still the same yesterday
[2:12:50] today and forever
[2:12:52] whatever you have need of friends I mean
[2:12:54] this with all my heart
[2:12:55] this is his word he has got everything
[2:12:59] covered David broke out in more Psalms
[2:13:03] 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all
[2:13:08] that is within me bless the Lord O my
[2:13:12] soul and forget not his benefits he's
[2:13:19] alarmed that he loved all that diseases
[2:13:22] he is the Lord that redeemeth thy life
[2:13:25] from destruction he crowd is my life
[2:13:29] with tender mercies bless the Lord O my
[2:13:32] soul and all that's within me I'll tell
[2:13:37] you this morning you don't have to set
[2:13:39] bound by any complex of fear you don't
[2:13:42] have to sit there and say I've tried and
[2:13:44] tried before this isn't about trying
[2:13:46] this is about saying Lord I'm standing
[2:13:50] on your word your presence has come here
[2:13:54] this morning and you have made that word
[2:13:56] that's what I ought to give you faith in
[2:13:57] the word not because I've read something
[2:13:59] out of the scripture not because I've
[2:14:02] just read it out of a message it's true
[2:14:03] that's all vindicated that is true we
[2:14:06] ought to have confidence in that but
[2:14:08] it's got to be the presence of God that
[2:14:10] makes it real to you to let you know
[2:14:12] this is for you I think how Elijah
[2:14:17] walked by Elijah that day Elijah walk
[2:14:19] right by Elijah he threw his mantle
[2:14:21] around Elijah he never said one word to
[2:14:23] him but you know what the mantle being
[2:14:26] thrown around him it had an effect on
[2:14:28] Elijah and already had started pulsating
[2:14:30] what did he do he began to follow Elijah
[2:14:33] Elijah said what are you doing he said I
[2:14:35] want a double portion it Elijah didn't
[2:14:39] know it but he was gonna be none I stood
[2:14:42] as profit in the room of Elijah he
[2:14:46] didn't know it when Elijah was off the
[2:14:47] scene but here he would be standing on
[2:14:49] the scene but what was it it's the same
[2:14:53] mantle of God it's the same Holy Ghost
[2:14:56] his
[2:14:56] same killer fire that moves around your
[2:14:58] heart that's a young person has an older
[2:15:01] person it's the mantle of Almighty God
[2:15:03] that moves around themselves I am yours
[2:15:10] to do what draws you unto himself what's
[2:15:17] the greatest thing we can do you say
[2:15:19] Lord I surrender I surrender I forsake

[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:44] my
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:56] aren't you glad he comes to bring you
[2:24:01] and I into the promise you know God just
[2:24:06] didn't bring him up to the Jordan but
[2:24:10] God brought America Joshua was there
[2:24:15] but Joshua was given orders that the
[2:24:18] priests were to take that ARCT and when
[2:24:21] their feet were coming to the brim of
[2:24:23] that water the water passed why they
[2:24:27] were taking the word
[2:24:33] they were taken to work that had come a
[2:24:37] promise word and they were carrying it
[2:24:41] over their heart and the word being
[2:24:46] carried over the heart remember that's
[2:24:49] why the man in the time when they tried
[2:24:52] to take the ark but Wren tells us on a
[2:24:55] mechanical device
[2:24:56] he said they tried to pack the word on a
[2:24:58] mechanical device he said but the word
[2:25:01] wasn't made to be tactical of mechanical
[2:25:02] devices the word was made to be packed
[2:25:05] over the heart a man died because of
[2:25:08] that that was not bad intentions David
[2:25:11] didn't mean anything bad by that David
[2:25:13] didn't mean something bad to happen but
[2:25:15] David didn't have understanding you see
[2:25:19] what David got caught in he got caught
[2:25:20] in enthusiasm and he failed to go back
[2:25:24] to the word it's gotta be the word not
[2:25:29] not enthusiasm come back to the word and
[2:25:31] here they stood and when they packed
[2:25:35] that Ark it came back came into that
[2:25:39] place that resting place and then it
[2:25:41] could come back into Jerusalem there
[2:25:43] were priests that could carry that Ark
[2:25:46] they were carrying it over the heart
[2:25:51] they man the world was made to be
[2:25:54] carried by our heart not by mechanical
[2:26:01] ISM but by a life a heart that's beating
[2:26:06] out when they came to that promise
[2:26:09] they stood there the Jordans party I'll
[2:26:12] tell you this morning friends it's a
[2:26:15] truth no matter what you have need of
