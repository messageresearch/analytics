it's a real song when it's road it's not about does it rhyme everything come together it's about a message we find a lot of things you know that uh sometimes it seems like nowadays there's really not a message sometimes it's songs it's kind of rare i'm talking about songs they call christian songs when you you sing songs that have have a message they could actually just they could preach a whole sermon to you you take like a you look you look back when martin luther they would write you know the inspiration that came in that hour to write certain songs john wesley charles wesley you could take one of those songs it was like a message and had a message to it you take other you know writers there's always it's an experience you really can't write a song unless you've had an experience you know your life my life it's a song [Music] there was a song about our life that wasn't a good song god came promised in this hour this age that you and i are living in and he has given us a news it was always our song we were always a part of it we just didn't know but he who wrote the song the great composer came down moved down and brought us into line with the music sheet i'm glad there's a new song aren't you i'm glad it's not the same old song that what it was but i i'm glad there's a there's a it's a passing away there's a new arrangement it's a new life there's new notes amen i'm so thankful for his grace hallelujah let's just bow our heads in the word of prayer heavenly father we want to say thank you lord jesus how can lord our minds our finite minds ever grasp behold or ever follow the greatness of god lord i'm so thankful that god that you made it so real to us as lord the writer by inspiration would say great is thy favorites [Music] great are thy mercies every day lord we are new how thankful we are lord i just asked lord to see [Music] may you just take us lord in your hands father you know the needs lord of your children and we're needing more we need you lord to come by our way that you would speak to our hearts lord o god that your word would find a find its mark in its place in our life father our desire god is to receive lord from you to know that there is transforming power in the word of god you don't ask us lord try to do anything you just said if thou can't believe lord i pray god hear the sea may you just take control speak very personally to every life and every heart help me to get out of the way help this congregation to step aside father we invite you lord come speak and hear through us lord come perform your word we pray in the name of jesus christ amen and you sing that last verse one more time i love your voice you have led me through the fire in darkest night you are close like no other i've known you as a father i've known you as my friend and i have lived in the goodness of god and all my life you have been faithful oh yes lord jesus and all my life you have been so so good with every breath that i [Applause] am [Music] yes i will sing of [Music] bless the name of the lord jesus oh hallelujah amen thank you lord jesus [Applause] amen we want to just turn our attention to the word of the lord tonight i'm going to read from first corinthians 13 4 that i want to go into the book of psalms right after that i say god bless each and every one of you just good to be in the house of the lord just welcome john and the visitor here god bless you all amen may the lord just richly bless you you you me you heard the different requests that were read different ones different saints here in the assembly and just ask that you just continue to remember each and every one in prayer we certainly thank god for his mercy he meant for sister michelle and we're just certainly believing for our full work thank god for his mercy for our sister and just once you remember i just asked you just remember the meetings and prayer this coming tomorrow begins over there and i always want to say toledo but it's actually michigan and so lord willing be there this weekend and ministering and i certainly covet your prayers that the lord will just just have his way in those services amen we know that every time we come together there's needs amen and i'm glad that he's the one who comes to meet those needs so we just want to just be in prayer for that brother alexander will be standing in here on sunday and then also keep in mind the following sunday brother ronnie long will be here it'll be on the 25th so let's look here in first corinthians 13 4. charity suffereth long and is kind not itself and is not puffed up may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to go to psalms 145 and as we we look at this in the in the scripture and seeing how that paul would would capture and expressing to the church of the living god of what real charity is you remember paul would also write in the book of colossians he would write in each of the in each of the books he would deal with with charity and in the book of colossians paul would write about above all things put on charity and that that phrase put on it means to sink into a garment and those are things that for in our lives where we are constantly challenged and i believe the desire of every believer is that christ would be reflected through our lives and in every situation there's some situations that are more glorious to us than there are in other situations but regardless we want him to be glorified let me just give you an example it's very glorious when we can stand and we can give a testimony and say god has come god has completely healed me the lord touched me and then to have the the the contrast of that would be able to say here we are still we're still suffering but god is faithful and in all things it's glorifying god it's giving god glory and knowing that god has everything in control and god's working it out and how that when we we see this of the love of god and to see that such a such a contrast with this last part we've been looking at it for some services that it's not puffed up it's not that which is lofty or to bear oneself lofty or to think of oneself above another or proud and we know that that's a battle each and every moment and every day of our life because the first birth itself it came by pride and so god by his grace humility comes into our life to grant to you and i and bring us to a place of overcoming and give us the victory that we might be able to recognize that opposition recognize pride because pride is such a subtle little deceptive thing i just was reading where the prophet was speaking of it and he speaks to a woman and he says oh sister he says i see he says the lord has already healed you he said but you got a little hottie about your healing and now that sickness has returned so we always want to look at it and say god thank you for your mercy lord thank you for your grace lord and to recognize that in everything we're nothing but he's everything and this is where when david would would write here in psalms 145 he would say i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name forever and ever every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name forever and ever great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts i will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible that means awesome acts and i will declare thy greatness so the greatness of god is not a it's not a thought but the greatness of god is an actual display of who he is but greatness is not displayed the greatness of god is not something that is displayed how that of the world what the world calls great because remember what the world calls great god calls foolish but what the world calls foolish that's what god calls great and god has so placed it within his word now god will never do anything outside of his word he could but he won't do anything outside of his word so he when god has given his word remember when he spoke his word his thought and even the season the time the vessels all of that is laying within that word and it's god has totally is entrusted to himself to bring that word to pass men can look upon that word and say does this mean this or does this mean that or could this mean this or could this mean that and then those can be things that you and i can look at and we can even see even in the time that we're living in even as we've looked at the message we've looked here at the scriptures and we see things that sometimes maybe we had thoughts like this or thoughts like this but one of the great things is is that we didn't have thoughts that were periods we had thoughts that were commas and thoughts that were open to being removed and it's open to god coming and god fulfilling his word because you or i would miss it if not for the grace of god that's given to our lives to be able to recognize god at work god vindicating his word god vindicating his promise not just looking at a ministry and saying wow what a great ministry wild signs and wonders but to have an unction of the holy spirit to recognize the ministry that god has sent in this hour that it is the fulfillment of the promises that he has made that's the grace of god we didn't give ourselves that that's god's grace that you and i can see that that part in the scripture and that same grace that's given that we can see that god fulfilling the scripture is the same grace that's given to us that then we step in to the word to that part that's to be fulfilled and it's not us fulfilling it it's god fulfilling his word that he promised through you and i in his season in his time through his subjects and it is it is his work and it is marvelous it's beyond that of what men look at it comes in such simplicity even when john was standing here and they looked at those scriptures of how the high places would be made plain and low places would be exalted and they they had in their mind of how that that was going to be but god made that scripture manifest through the ministry of john the baptist here came a man that was not part of their seminaries he was not part of their training he was not part of any of that he was a man that god here he was in the wilderness here he has brought at the time where the ministry is supposed to be god is arranging everything in its season and here was a fulfillment of the word and yet the people are looking right past it let me just say this to you we can understand those things or know those things but let me just tell you something god is still god he's still fulfilling his word he's still passing over the wise and he's still revealing himself to the symbol the simple that just simply says this is your word lord and i'm trusting in you you'll give the unction you give the direction the same god that could lead israel and say pack up it's time to move we're looking to the same pillar of fire the angel of the lord the holy spirit that's leading us from glory unto glory and it is the greatness of god that as we see on display it is the greatness of god that we see that god displaying even his attributes and his and his life and his nature think of the lord jesus when we've been looking at this in in a couple of services here he come and you know brother bran would say it like this that there was 99 of the people and 9 10 didn't even know he was here on earth even right there the bible said he came to his own and his own received him not they kept on probing him tell us whether you're him or not show us or do this but you see it's not god it's not put on like that by believers believers just simply believe it it's something that moves beyond this side beyond these ears it moves down deep and it just it settles down you say this is good this is reality this is life this is truth it just it's something and you know what's awesome god doesn't ask you and i to explain it he just asked can't you believe it because if you can believe it and receive it in that way the same god that's vindicating that word is the same god that in his greatness will come in such simplicity and make it so real in your life and through your life it's greatness how the lord jesus he would come as we've been looking at in such humility that the very god of heaven brother brandon would put it like this humiliated himself he took upon a garment in the likeness of sinful flesh here was the king of glory you would expect kingly garments but he came in a garment that was promised according to his word in order to redeem you and add he took not on him the nature of angels he took on him the seed of abraham the promise of his word and when every time god comes and the word is being fulfilled god is present because it's god failing himself wrapping himself up in his word and making that word manifest to his children and his children recognize him very god of heaven humiliated himself and you know you see these are things as as brother braham goes on he says he says but we don't want to be humiliated and he goes through what god is asking of things he says you know that's the reason the women don't want to let their hair grow out they they don't want to wear dresses like they should they they they get humiliated but jesus he said constantly look who he was greatness he said i'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself great humble humbles greatness humbles itself greatness now i want to just deal with this a moment here humiliates itself it doesn't mean to look down upon yourself [Music] but it really means to have a real conscious awareness of who you and i are in reality we're just 84 cents of dirt but on the inside not the outside but on the inside is on the inside is real cold it's what's on the inside not on the outside remember even the world itself satan paints it out it's it's what's on the outside and it's attractive but then you find no substance of what's on the inside god veils himself in the substance of his life and of his word and it's not the character on the outside or the the visage on the outside it's what's on the inside the scripture said there was no beauty we should desire him no form no covenant it wasn't anything about outside that was so oh attractive as a matter of fact he was a spindly looking fellow he would be one that was looked right over but god chose it that way this was greatness so if that greatness as it was made manifest to where he would humble himself and at the very even at the closing out before heading to the garden he would he would adorn himself with or gird himself with with that of a towel and he would he would fetch water and he would wash the feet of the disciples he would bring himself into a place it wasn't just that he was walking in the likeness of sinful flesh but he humbled himself he became lore became a foot washed funky because there were many who were walking around in bodies though that it was not virgin born but yet here they were walking around in human bodies but here the god of glory he came down greatness and he humbled himself to become a footwash flunky and he humbled himself and washed their feet and he humbled himself even to another degree that not just death but the death of the cross that's greatness that greatness let me just say this that greatness was all about you and me that greatness was not about him amen he endured the cross for the joy that was set before him what was that joy you and me that that life that that was there resting inside of that vessel might now be imparted into you and i that redemption might come to you and i that we might be brought back how could you and i be brought back because greatness came down and took the bling took the blame that you and i could go free oh glory so this same greatness is made manifest within the body the same way that this life as it was in the groom it's the same way that this life is in the body of believers it won't act any different he said if this spirit if this if that spirit the race of jesus from the grave dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body you know act the same way the works that i do shall you do also it'll act the same way it's the same jesus in a different form amen paul writes this in philippians 2. think of how paul here he is writing of this character in this life we read the latter scriptures but now he's dealing with this life this character being expressed in the body if there be any if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any vows and mercies fulfill you my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord and of one mind now this scripture here this is an admonition now to a life that has really been redeemed when we're redeemed we no longer want our own choice we want his choice we want his leading and when the word is put before us it is a standard it's that which we are reaching for or were yielding to and saying god be it unto me we've become so so aware of this part it's already in our nature but god makes us aware of these things in this time how can there be a like-mindedness how can there be the same love being of one accord and of one mind how can this be as paul is speaking of discomfort any fellowship of the spirit it can't be unless there's a like-mindedness how can how how can this like-mindedness be is it a man that gets everybody together and now we're just going to brainwash people not at all this is why it takes the holy spirit and every life just coming into that admonition giving their life to the lord let me just say it very personally as the word is coming forth not just in this service as you're reading in the scriptures as you're listening to the message it's really giving yourself to the word when you do that the effect is a like-mindedness because the word will produce the word so this isn't something we sat down and we're gonna have a class and let's all think the same and let's no this is a work of almighty god this is why paul would say in romans 12 16 be of the same mind one toward another in romans 15 5 now the god of patience and consolation that's comfort grant you to be like-minded one toward another according to christ jesus notice these are things that when you read this here this should be something that we esteem we pray we say god grant among us lord there's a real like-mindedness because you see he says that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ so that we're saying the same thing this is this is the desire because where there is division there's no unity where there's no unity there's no power is that right before the holy ghost ever came on the day of pentecost the bible says they were in one mind and one accord what brought that unity prior to the holy ghost coming was the vindicated word of the hour and the disciples who were sad now here they are the word comes and begins to gather them and as the word is revealing itself that indeed the word has been fulfilled it brings them into a place that does this promise that now is for us of the holy ghost and what did they become centered on they did not become centered upon one another they became centered on the vindicated word that was in their midst oh my when they got their eyes on him completely on him away from all of their cells there was an expectation that they entered into that upper road there's no doubt they were in tighter quarters than they had ever been it wasn't a comfortable spot there was 120 that were gathered there they once spread out like you and i but you know what it didn't matter they were there under the commandment of the word and they had an expectation a day when you get our eyes off the things of the world and we have our thighs on the things of god brother this is the product there is a light mindedness because this is not the work of man this is not brochure sent out and said okay let every baptist church preach the same thing we'll deliver it in your mailbox and and you read through everything that ain't how god runs this program the same god that had paul preaching that reality of jesus christ is the same god that gave it to peter and when they met up having never seen one another they were preaching the same gospel whether god is the one who's over his church it's god that brings about a real like-mindedness in unity and speaking the same thing it should be a reality in our life that if the enemy would rise up we ought to save the same faith get behind me devil loose my sister loose my brother heal my sister heal my brother it ought to be a same mind why we're looking at the living god this is why paul this was this would see you see the enemy's objective is to try to bring division he'll use anything he'll use anything because you see when thoughts themselves start going as though well well if they only seen it like i see it if they don't right there that's division that's the vision boy if they got to what maybe they need to get our pastors tapes or they need to get brother satan no no they no no nobody has any exclusive on the holy ghost are you with me the holy ghost it's the same holy ghost moving throughout the bride body god has not entrusted it to one man upon this earth to keep the bride in line there's not one man that the bride oh right now upon the earth the man the bride's got to go listen to this man god has sent his messenger the message has come and the same god who sent the messenger with the message is the same god that's here confirming that message in the hearts of his children and making it live [Music] a lot of things around us pardon me for taking it off this time but you know there are a lot of things around us to try to to try to break and distract this is why friends we need the discernment of the holy ghost you can't face this world without the discernment of the holy ghost you get away from the word you get away from your discernment because we are called to discern that knoweth now we stand here to say we're not gonna give the devil one inch this is why paul is even right about this even in the corinthian church he said in first corinthians 1 10 i beseech your brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are the house of chloe that there are contentions among you and it goes on you know some are saying i'm a palm apollos i'm a cephas and i'm of christ i just stay home is christ divided has paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of christ or paul you see paul is identifying this division division tears down unity it removes power you say something if the holy ghost is inside of you you can't rest until you're united in brotherhood you might have to wait for somebody to simmer down but your heart there's a longing in your heart that you don't want anything in there it's to restore broken fellowship where did that come from that didn't come from our genes brother our genes ain't that strong our genes hope sometimes can remember certain things we can have certain feelings of disagreement but god himself when man had stepped over the line and disbelieved the word and went out in unbelief god himself came down in a time where he could have condemned man but he spoke out i'll make a way back for you a longing in his heart to be united with his children hallelujah you see there were some evidently when you read this in the book of philippians there evidently was you know a few i don't know this here in verse 2 these two name two names forgive me for not being able to really pronounce them right but i want to butcher them but paul called them right out i beseech you that they be of the same mind in the lord evidence they were kind of had their own little separate things hello see that's the enemy to try to get things isolated where oh my if they could only see the message worth the way the way i'm seeing it if the way you're seeing it is making you feel a little bit higher i don't want to see it that way because when i realize this you're looking above greatness i don't want to see it that way i i want to see it in the turn the reality of greatness because when you really see the word for what it is and when the word is revealed it don't make you feel like a stuffed shirt as a matter of fact when god comes down it's such a humility to stretch your heart not just for him revealing himself but it challenges our life and it examines our lives there's things that as it comes over we can say god forgive me why because the word as it's being revealed is a molding and a shaping of our character and we realize we didn't give ourselves this understanding so in order for this same mind it requires a submitting to one another we're not talking about submitting to sin we're talking about as submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of the lord so this display of character notice how paul would write it goes on in philippians 2 3 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory that that's through a boastfulness or to try to put somebody's self forward but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others lowliness of mind that means to have a humble opinion of oneself i i know we all like to think we've got that but we don't there's things that we steal within our lives is still bringing that in it's objection it's it's daily friends listen it never gets to a spot to where this isn't there this is the admonition of the word because as long as we're walking in these bodies it's gonna have to be brought subject to the word you realize even when you feel like somebody's a little wrong remember how the prophet brought it he said you feel like somebody's a little wrong he said don't let anything set in your heart at that time they might be wrong but don't set in your heart and let anything set in that my goodness how could they not see this or how could they not but just pray for him because to know that it's god's grace to you is that right yeah look at this paul would bob would have steamed this here you know about one's littleness in ephesians four he said i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you're called with all lowliness and meekness and what meekness is to give place give place with long suffering for bearing one another in love boy these are scriptures that this part right here wow and everything's on the mountaintop everybody's agreeing with us everybody's going these aren't made manifest right but in order for bear somebody in love there's got to be something that you've got to forbear we wouldn't esteem that is the glorious thing boy that ain't the same as walking on the water but it requires the same humility it requires the same greatness remember there were many times where they said things about him pressured on him pressed him the bible says the imminently that he would say something jesus removed himself and went out of their midst jesus never felt obligated to debate anybody or to prove anything to anybody he didn't have to prove nothing because it it ain't something where you've got to prove something to a believer well i have to do this or no no no no greatness itself god makes himself known in simplicity notice this notice with loneliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace so this is not just something that just says well you know what listen i tell you what sarasara this is just going to happen i mean we're all believers paul didn't write it that way paul wrote it that here we are to endeavor be diligent to exert oneself to present oneself in a way for what for what cause for the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace brother branham would say it this way in my new ministry he said greatness as he's talking about greatness because he speaks of how john here john the baptist steps out clothed with the you know camels you know and the hair around him and yet god said there's never been one greater solomon was a great one on and on we could go david and on and on but here was john and john steps out as the messenger of the covenant to introduce the messiah he's yielded to that word and he stands right there and god called that greatness but it didn't look great according to the world because you see worldly pride it'll search out for what's the most beautiful place i can go what and it looks for beauty where does that come from that first birth satan is in beauty not godly beauty that which is sinful beauty that which attracts based on just the outside without substance it should be the substance on the inside that attracts you see this is why if it's just well just the beauty of the church then they got to have beautiful programs gotta have a beautiful pastor in this day and age you know you gotta have you gotta you know he just gotta speak just so and the guy can't sweat and everything else puts me out it just all these things gotta be just so and this and that and everything else you see what it is it's got to keep it up but when it is the very beauty of jesus christ it's not about how together how things look i'm not saying that you don't have a nice place i'm saying that it comes down there's a substance on the inside it's like when a man marries a woman if it's just because if she's displaying herself in a way that's what she's going to attract are you with me that's why it's got to be a real jesus on the inside a real god on the inside it's god that attracts his people my sheep know my voice hallelujah because the man he's marrying that character that's right this outside it'll fade it'll get old and everything else but there's a character that's the real person that you're united to oh i feel like preacher i'm telling them that there's hard times it comes there's tests and trials there's things sometimes that don't look so good but here is jesus in the midst of it all and brother dave he's sweeter tonight than he ever was he's more precious tonight i'm more in love with him tonight than i was at first why because we're united with the real character of jesus christ hallelujah and this is real greatness greatness brother brown puts it like this he says greatness that's a great person that'll take the blame for everything just say help me jesus because you know we want to give our side of it somebody has said something i mean we want to give our sign we've got to justify ourselves now i'm not saying there isn't time to justify ourselves but sometimes we're put in situations and we can either just because sometimes even when you try to justify yourself you you really look like the guilty part what would it be better to do well if you try to justify yourself then how all of this comes out it'd be better just to take the blame and say just let it pass on the blame for what it ain't about you it's the body he took the blame greatness took the blame for the body this is why paul said in romans 12 3 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly in other words feet on the ground according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith who dealt who dealt to man god what measure of faith we're talking about we're not talking about your faith we're talking about the faith of the son of god it's that faith that paul said i live by and that faith the love of god is what pushes our faith so who who dealt it to us he did this is how we think soberly not to think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think brother brown puts it so simple he says you know if you want to know how great you are go get a bucket of water and put your finger down in the water and pull it out and you won't see where you put your finger in because we're nothing amen hallelujah god don't need us no we need him amen you see how the spirit of pride works in the last days i am rich and have need of nothing they believe they reach the apex they have cut a hold of everything of what it was all about i don't have need of nothing but the sad part about it is they're deceived every day of our life we have need of god we have need of god i don't care how beautiful the church is i don't care how wonderful the preaching we need him we need the holy ghost to come down and change lives we need the holy ghost to come and perform his word we need the spirit of god to move down in our life and mold our character and bring us in a place where we walk in humility not with our chest stuck out and our nose up in the air but we walk with humility to know it's god's grace that revealed this truth to me be conscious he says of your of how little you are now i want to just let me just deal with this just a just a fraction of a moment be conscious of how little you are i'm not talking about the words that daddy ran you down by i'm not talking about what mama said or the teacher or somebody else that puts you down that ain't what we're talking about because that ain't truth are you with me you may not have been and been an engineer but you ain't dumb as a box of rocks is that all right you see there's a lot of things you could heard in your life it ain't true but being conscious of how little you are is to recognize our need of god it's not focusing on our weaknesses well i'm not good at this i'm not going that's not be you're being conscious of the wrong faith it's to be conscious of how little we are i don't care if you're the smartest person i don't care if you're the most educated the richest it's to be conscious of how little we are and that doesn't always mean walking around and saying i'm so little i'm so little because sometimes people say that and they are not telling the truth they don't believe it no more than anything are you with me oh i'm just the least now sometimes listen friends there's a reality is it that we want to look at that in the right way it's not looking down on ourselves but to recognize we are in need of god's amazing grace when paul could say how god came into this world to save sinners of whom i am chiefest paul looked at his life he didn't deserve what god had done for him matter of fact he said i blasphemed in ignorance he didn't deserve the mercy of god but god said the ribbon paul said the reason god did it that way not only was i in his thinking and his choosing but it was a pattern of the salvation of god that would go forth to others to recognize that a life can say i might have went too far but it can't go further then the grace of god can reach down and deliver it that's a real pattern that god paul's life hallelujah so he says brother says you know don't try to be you know you try to be a little something but be what you are i mean god made you what you are he wants you to be you and once you be like nobody else just be you be who god made you to be paul said i am what i am by the grace of god now that don't mean we walk around saying well i've always been stubborn i guess i'll just discover it no no no you taking that way too far we're talking about being little being yielded in the hands of god to say god i need you luke 18 9. jesus he gives this example he spoke a parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others [Music] these are the kind of people you don't want to have coffee with they'll pick you apart they'll let you know the scripture that you got wrong they'll finish a quote for you or you understand what i'm saying it's they were righteous but they despised others this cannot be the righteousness of god this is self-made righteousness it's a homemade recipe two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican wow to contrast huh the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself that's right because god went with him god i thank thee that i am not as other men are what a time of prayer bragging to god at least i'm not like this one and i'm not like that one lord i'm not like the rest of the people down there have believers spoken word tabernacle god i thank you don't worry god ain't even in the in the prayer room and you ain't even made it to the throne oh my the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breath saying god be merciful to me a sinner be merciful to me i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted you see things that we look at sometimes even in thoughts and thoughts sometimes of pride and listen these are things sometimes that we look at that it can run it can run different even in lines maybe some things that you know you've been through and it can also run sometimes with different strains and and so forth where there's things that maybe for some they have to watch over this a little bit more and others in this way but in all things we need to watch over it and guard it with the grace of god i believe god speaks to us in this way to help us to be able to to further understand to be on guard to to be ready to endeavor to say lord help me lord to catch that because the very moment brother brown tells like this he said the very moment you get puffed up is the very moment god pulls back so when we we look at this here sometimes it's things where complexes complexes can can develop brother graham says you know he says the blood of jesus christ will never give you a complex education learning knowledge that can bring complexes and so when we look at this sometimes he says it can move in a complex of i'm a little bit bigger than somebody else i'm a little bit better than somebody else and i know a little bit more than somebody else notice how paul would put this here and let me just try to bring this down to a close in romans 12 16 he says picking up the same scripture now he says mind not high things but congdon sinned to men of low estate now paul's not speaking of men who you know where you go out and you're mixing with the world and partaking of the world that's not what he's speaking this term of low estate would deal with things of humility those that may be uh maybe would be of a of a lower state or or wherein they're in a situation of maybe depressed or in grief or they're in sickness paul would write of this he talks about of how that when they were cast down it means the same thing when they were in a state of needing to be comforted god sent titus to them and it was comfort to them when they were cast down so what a challenge to my not high things because as we said when paul would write these things it would speak even as he said let a man not think more highly of himself than he ought to think so there's a things that we have to keep in regards and say lord help me now remember as we've looked ahead and just stepped you know stepped into it for a little bit god has also provided for you and i knowing that a time we need divine assistance to keep ourselves in a place where god can use us there's a part of it there's a measure of it that god gives to you and i to keep ourselves humble that we would say lord help me not to rise above that but yet god as he would to paul he would give and there would be a messenger of satan to buffet him lest he should be exalted now how that god god determines that i don't know how that god looks at it and says uh you know what this very thing right now paul's eyesight it's got to go out right now why to keep him in that place of looking up to me god knows that i'm glad i'm glad it's not up to me i'm glad that god's entrusted us there's a desire in our heart to keep ourselves humble lord help me stay humble help me to recognize when a wrong thought would come in help me lord not to look down if there's something that maybe somebody else doesn't see help me not to look down on them i want you to understand this there's times sometimes where maybe someone has stood and whether it's been here or somewhere else and i can hear maybe something being ministered and i realize oh they haven't read this yet or they haven't read this quote they haven't seen where the prophet has brought these things together so that they're not two separate points anymore but you know what i don't know i don't wait to be in the service and pull the individual side and say hey let me tell you this let me tell you this if god permits that opportunity to come with that brother then at that time i would be able to share with that brother hey have you seen this in the message have you seen this right here have you seen this have you seen where brother braham says this and begin to speak of in a way and i've done it that way by the grace of god many times sometimes i just come back right back around and realize god gives grace and i have to stand here and correct it without putting any light on anybody it don't mean that i'm right i'm just saying there's a standard in god's word that we're holding to there's certain things that can be preached and i can look and say well they haven't read this they haven't read that book yet they haven't heard this one more but it isn't something that i'm above anybody else their desire should be that what god has opened to our hearts that god would open it to everybody's heart and to know that god is no respecter of person and you know what regardless if i get to say something to somebody or not hey they got the same master and the same boss i do god didn't send me to correct everybody i'm so glad about that i'm glad that we can just be yield of the lord and just follow his leading mind not high things to things that would put us in the light of something that would put it out here there could be a lot of temptations even with things that's around right now that you have at your fingertips to post this or post that or pull what should i do always examine your motive and object always examine your motive and objective mind not all things mind not high things but condemned sin boy that's a big word isn't it condemned sin which means what to lower yourself where does that example come from from god that was real greatness that was displayed to you and i this is why peter would say and i'm closing likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the elder gay all of you be subject one to another so not just young to the older but all be subject one to another that word subject doesn't mean the just way you're under no that means voluntary attitude it's voluntary for what what what's the goal unity the body friends every decision that we make it should be about the body the moment we get going in our own tracks we're losing the focus this is why the scripture says discerning the lord's body yeah all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble and then he want more grace i do i do i want more of it lord and how do how do we become recipients of it by holding at bay pride holding it at bay the bible says the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride it was hard but to hold that at day listen you can't keep a thought from coming up in your mind you understand you can't keep that thought but you can say lord forgive me even though it's not your thought but right then there lord i give no place to this here i only want you by jesus because there's only one great one among us amen that's him he's our savior he's our deliverer he's our redeemer he's to be the object of all of our worship our adoration our affection and let me say this he's in his body he's in his body may god help us heavenly father dear lord jesus lord i know that as we look upon your word look into it lord as you would speak to our hearts my lord how it challenges our lives i don't believe there's a time lord we can hear your word and our hearts and lives not be challenged your god we want lord with all that's within us as paul would admonish the believers put on charity above all things peter would write be clothed in humility lord it would be like that of a of a belt the way that it's wrote there in the scriptures one of servitude [Music] that would be the display of greatness among the body of jesus christ lord i realize is each and every one of your children we realize lord that there's lord been times different ones lord that's passed through here lord some lord have gone on some lord may be gone back out in the world lord i know that that's at every in every assembly sometimes lord god is we're looking upon your word you've never given an exemption [Music] in a manner to say well if they're not if they're not really exhibiting a life of a real believer then this doesn't apply but quite the contrary [Music] it applies lord sometimes lord there's things lord that's very tough lord in order to hold the body together in unity it takes the holy spirit it takes hearts inclined for one promise one purpose we're looking and we're living for the coming of the lord holding lord to the message that you've given to us that which is lord given us life there's one goal that we have lord there's one purpose help us lord as we look at this we realize that lord our adversary and your adversary the enemy he's always trying to bring disunity try to sow discord lord god whether it would be lord in a local church or throughout the body of jesus christ but help us lord i pray help us not lord than our eyes would be focused on differences help us lord god that our eyes would remain focused on you [Music] it's our desire lord god to walk on with you to go on with you lord jesus to know that lord god the just lord jesus as grace has given to us times that you've corrected us when we've been wrong just lord god has you lord jesus raise us up lord you're the same god you're the same god for each and every one of my brothers and sisters lord i want to stand there lord god and believe it just that way i'd rather be guilty of that lord god than guilty of cutting somebody off i'd rather be guilty lord god of standing there lord jesus and asking for mercy help us lord i prayed your god truly lord our hearts desire lord god we want to see you lord lord jesus this moves the lord god not just in a church marriage is lord holmes [Music] lord i thank dear god as i'm just reading lord here you're studying lord god upon the thought of staying humble how the lord you would lead your prophet in situations lord where he was asked about domestic situations he would ask be asked about divisions in a home lord were once a believer and once not and how that that would be applied in that moment he would take the scriptures of paul would take the scriptures of peter and would apply it stay humble stay humble pray stay sweet lord jesus i know lord god these are so contrary to the things the lord that we many times we want to try to take things lord in many different realms and situations we want to try to fix things or turn things around on the job or other places but we only make a mess out of it lord when we get our hands on it but may lord jesus we just let and place ourselves in your hands say god let me be fully in your hands lord let me look to you lord jesus let my mind lord let my attitude let my feelings oh god let it be in line with you lord jesus let me be of conscious of how little i am [Music] not looking down on myself [Music] but recognizing that i'm but an earthen vessel lord i need you without you i can do nothing if the very son of god could stand here upon this earth and could say i can of my own self do nothing lord jesus it was so submitted and so harnessed to the word of god help us lord i i've got confidence that that same life is working in the body though not in our individual lives in the same measure but it's the same quality of life help us lord i pray help us lord i pray as an assembly help us god i pray from one to another lord lord jesus that greatness as david could write about it there in the beginning that greatness itself might be displayed not what we're trying to do but greatness is humility greatness lord according to your word i pray in jesus name god bless you this evening [Music] oh don't you just love him hallelujah you'd like to stand let's just worship [Music] foreign [Applause] uh oh my strength [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen we want you lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] my [Music] my to [Music] even though you are the key [Music] yes lord [Music] may my spirit [Applause] [Music] i want what you want [Music] whatever wherever [Music] i know that you know what's i want what you want for me [Music] [Applause] i want what you want for me [Music] for me whatever wherever cause i know that you know what's best [Music] [Applause] for you want for me [Applause] amen let's just bow our heads before the lord of prayer lord jesus thank you for this message tonight lord lord in our hearts we're humble lord we take the position that you gave us in your word lord by the sacrifice of christ lord jesus lord we thank you that you keep us lord properly impositioned lord by your word may we never lean to our own understanding lord or think of ourselves more highly lord than what you give it to us but we appreciate all that you've given to us in christ lord jesus help us to stay right in the right in the middle of the world may we be praying for one another lord and and reaching out to one another brothers and sisters in christ lord amen praying for one another lord and staying in humility lord when a brother or sister falls or has trouble lord that we'd reach out to them and let them know we love them lord praying for our lord help us lord to stay together as a body lord jesus may the devil not be able to bring any divisions amongst us we love you lord thank you for this word tonight please bless us all as we go to our homes we love you in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you all tonight
