always warms our hearts to be with you all and we just appreciate the grace of God with your pastor in the church here and we just pray the Lord continue to strengthen and establish and sell you and and everything in Christ Jesus amen if you have your Bibles this morning we look at the Book of Joshua and in the fifth chapter here and we just pray the Lord have his way I pray something would be said that might be a blessing of course to his children that's why we come here amen well that's why I can't praise the Lord I don't know why the devil came he likes to come around Church too for some reason but he always seemed to get beat up when he comes to church I think he learned his lesson you know people come here with trials and struggles and things it's like man why the devil even show up man you know we just know what's gonna happen to him hey man you believe that I can even awe somebody there's somebody somebody's got something they need overcome today is that right we were called to become over comers I believe we're over comers today but I believe this is the place amen in Christ Jesus we can have overcoming Josh for the fifth chapter of course Joshua's just brought the children Israel from Egypt into the Promised Land here and they've been recirc amazed according to the commandment of God that He gave originally to Abraham and that's coming down here the ninth verse this morning in Joshua chapter 5 the Bible says this and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day of course the name gilga means a rolling back or a rolling away so there is a reproach that was on them when they come out of Egypt but I want you to that reproach and this promised land has rolled away there's no more reproach or shame being identified with the children of Israel a man the reproach they had the uncircumcised was taken away at this place a man so back here in the tenth verse and the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month even in the plains of Jericho verse 11 they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the Passover unleavened cakes in parched corn in the self-same day and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of Israel manna anymore but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer this morning gracious Heavenly Father we are so grateful to be here as I was already just testifying with this group of people that are your children your beloved bride father what a what a privilege Lord to stand before them on I think of the prophets of old how many times they would stand in the face of those that did not believe the word of the Lord had come and they were persecuted and afflicted and and caught all manner of evil things falsely for your name's sake and Lord even unto this day with your children with us as believers it happens but I'm thankful for a place like this we can gather together and there's an agreeable spirit with the things of God that your children could worship under the shed blood of Jesus Christ in the unity of the spirit Lord on a man-made unity or a program but something that you have you have given to us by your grace that we could be knit together and loved knowing that every joint would supply father I pray now you'd anoint not just me as a minister but your children the people that have gathered here to give them eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts to receive that what you have for them follow me all darkness and sickness and affliction and all the powers of the King of Hell may they be broken all right now in this place for I believe the anointing still breaks every yoke I believe the power that is still greater than the power of Satan I believe you've not changed but you were the same and you've given us victory in power and dominion over the powers of darkness and over over every enemy and today Lord every footstep that we can take my faith in this promised land is a possession to us that you've given to your children heritance maybe great glorying on an hour miss father may be pleased to move in to dwell in our mets probably give you the praising glory for it we commit this service our hearts our lives everything that is said and done now into your loving hands is a loving and faithful creator and we ask these things in the mighty name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and the bride said Amen god bless you seated today taking a thought here this morning Bread on his table might not sound like it ties in the scripture directly but I'll bring it around here by the grace of God in just a few minutes I won't talk about bread on his table amen you'll notice that after the past I'll really begin to take the corner of the land on the self-same day and they begin to eat of the old corner of the land so we look at this the children visitor they've taken their flight from the land of Egypt and their Exodus in the wilderness and I want you to consider that for the space of 40 years God had supernaturally sustained this people he give them a smitten Rock in the wilderness and it wasn't just a little I love I'll but the bread talks about that you get that artist he painting that and you got the little sprinkler coming out there he forgot that I don't know put the hose away for the winter and he's got this little thing just leaking off there but he said no it was a great big gush it was enough to water two million men besides their women and children and all their their cattle and everything else they had with them and so they had a smitten rock that provided for man and man that fell in quail and God had done all these things you know when one of them got sick brother band said that Moses had a chest that he could go to doctor Moses he said let's look in this chest what's in there he said maybe there's some pot Lissa's or some medicine I don't you know maybe people were some sort of a Tylenol or something like that but he said he only had one thing in that chest I'm the Lord that healeth thee he said that was all Moses had and that was all they needed and really that's all we need today I'm the Lord that healeth thee amen he said I give you all your diseases I believe that word all means all without exception praise the Lord I believe he's still a healer today you think even their shoes that they wore didn't wear out by the space of 40 years of tales that'd be nice hey man I go through she's all the time Amen well it's true retired there's something else our tires would be even better well that's the whole sermon there hey man but for the space of 40 years they travel and even the shoes that were out in their clothes and so worth it's incredible to think about the grace of God that was sustained naturally speaking in this environment for 40 years and for 40 years straight God was faithful every day there's water every day yeah except of course the man is fall in six days and you gather twice as much on the seventh day but listen you could you can set your clock by the program of God God never missed today God never said oh I don't have enough water for the day you have to come back next week we've got a rash in this we're gonna be careful with this you could gather as much as you needed you'd have none left over if you gather sparingly you had enough God provided for them supernaturally and I think about what a great thing it was and what I want you to understand today is as great as that was it's just a means to an end hey man now we'll just have follow where I'm going with this God was doing all these things supernaturally we can look at what God has done through the Bible and through church changes and what God has done we can look at the miracles and the martyrdoms and the things that God has done and we think God for them but I want you to understand there are means to an end God was trying to bring them somewhere God wouldn't want to just leave them in the wilderness and provide for them that way he wanted to give them something better so God says this is great what I've done here but what I'm taking is something better than that it's great to know that you have a hope of life after death but I'm gonna take you to a body change I'm gonna take you to full adoption I'm gonna take you to a place where all the promises are possible all the promises are you a man Oh hallelujah somebody God was taking them to a goal the goal was not the man in the wilderness now for some of them that's as far as they went and they died in the world is having the blessing of God woman having these things yet they died in the waters but things out another generation rose up and God said this is a people that are gonna go into the land when another generation forsaken the blessings of God there's two people I think not for a Joshua the Moses the Bible said or Joshua and Caleb rather the Bible said they had a different spirit about them and God would take them in another Joshua commissioned into the promised land that was the goal of God was to take them not just into the land but to position them in a dwelling in the land listen esagrill the ministry of of the gospel of Jesus Christ it's not just a bless you but it's to take you somewhere where there's rest now listen Joshua gave them a rest but the Bible tells us in Hebrews that was not the rest of God that he wanted to give his people there remained a rest I believe it's what we have today and the Holy Ghost God has given a rest to his people place we don't don't worry about I'm not gonna make it I can't survive can I be a Christian in the darkness of land is here when people are falling away and they've got their eyes on every kind of distraction and every kind of vice and sin yet for the Christian there is rest but Christians don't have to fuss and fight with his brother and sister just to make in the kingdom I know some people out there dot every I and cross every teen if you don't see it that way then draw your right out of the circle but I praise God for a message that draws you right back in says you know I can love you you can be my brother my sister anyway hallelujah I'm not worried about it I don't have to make it I've already made it in Christ you look at brother Brandon preaching them out of this when they enter in the promise and he talks about earlier in the message many times he types it as the Millennium he talks about it being the Millennium but later when he comes around and preaches adoptions of course he makes the point this could not be a type of the millennium cuz there's so Wars and Fighting's there is this the type of the Holy Ghost a man he says ours is not a holy land but the Holy Ghost amen amen what does it make the change because there's a battle being fought in the land a man listen is a Christian you've still got battles ifs about trials but the difference is now you've got victory to go ahead once you used to live in defeat and heartache and distress and worry now you have a victory you didn't win on your own but God give me the land hallelujah somebody but I've been talking about this in paradox division he sees he says it's about three o'clock in the morning I suppose that I've gotten up and looked at where in front me I was coming down to the Jordan looked like it was standing on the map of Palestine you're probably familiar with this he says I was coming down to Jordan it seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to Jordan something was singing it and then I drew near the river I look back and see what your way I had come it was two-thirds of the way there to the Jordan he says and I looked across durin said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays where he says in the promised land now I want to ask you where does every promise lay for the Christian well the Bible tell you the second Corinthians the 1st chapter all the promises of God there yay and there Amen we're in Christ listen there yes look God's not making decisions about his promises today for those that are in Christ I hope somebody gets that today hey man he's already said yes and he's already say day man his own promises if you're in Christ I've ever talked about this but I give these credit card offers all the time the mail they're usually junk and then they said you've been pre-approved for $8,000 credible I'm the $8,000 credit that be all right I don't know who they pre-approval musta got the wrong mailbox but they'll tell you them pre-approved for a certain amount of credits Emma listen you've been pre-approved for the kingdom of God and then gums pre-approved you said I've made promises I've laid out divine promises and divine fats whereby you might be a partaker of the divine nature and if you are in Christ he has already said yes and they learn to every promise in this Bible listen that's why you can sing every promise in the book is mine not because you were smart enough not because you lived all right not because you come from the right kind of a family but because you're in Christ we're all the promises way well helping out somebody if all the promises are there then what are you worried about what are you fussing about honey man you've already had victory over your enemy listen everything you have need of amen brother Brent says everything that need of for your earthly journey is in you right now if you have the Holy Ghost he says even the rapture listen that means what I really need today listen it's not about me or some other man you can draw from the breasts in one oh sorry all right now the word of faith it's 9u it's in your mouth it's in your heart if you can speak to your rock you can have what you need oh yeah listen I think it's important to know where we're at today listen it would be presumptuous to say that ever promised in the book is mine unless you knew where you were act and then listen if you're in the wilderness it doesn't belong to you but if you're in the promise if you're in Christ if you're a part of that scene of Abraham who is Christ every promise in the book is mine levan says it's the adoption messages watch how he addresses this time I pawned book of Ephesians he says this is not to the unbelievers this is to the church it's called to the called out ones the sanctified and call out that are in Christ Jesus now you want to know how we get him to Christ Jesus is if you turn the first Corinthians 12 itself or by one spirits we're all baptized into one body how baptized by the Holy Ghost not water baptism uses you Church of Christ people but by one Capital spirit by one spirit not by one handshake not my one letter but or by one spring but by one spirit we've all been baptized into one body our possession let me see my possession our possession and then the land that God gave us to live in the Holy Ghost just to get Canaan to the Jews he gave us the Holy Spirit by one spirit all baptized into one body sister you get it and he's talking to the spiritual Canaanites Israel the spiritual Israel who has possessed the land he says aren't you glad you've come out of Egypt garlic I'm glad I don't smell like Egypt anymore him and I used to look like in the world talk like the world act like the world but God brought me out thank God some people still wanna listen something will still go back to Egypt that's what they did in the wilderness their hearts never left they physically left but their hearts never left he's if they wanted to go back over there enough graves in Egypt for us to me Barry that's all I can think about was dying because that's all I had to look forward to because people got a possession somewhere we don't look like death we don't talk like death we're carriers of life we ought to be caring about and brag but by death all the time we've got resurrection we've got a possession he said aren't you glad you're out of the wilderness well I am yeah I know some people are still no bonus that's all I preach to a man waiting for God well tell you what looked like the prophets end the third axis that when they were in the Loess they were waiting on God brother Bram said and God was waiting on them notice the mindset of them in the limits they're waiting for God to do something and miss it God is waiting on them I believe a movers on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord we've had a Moses we've had a Joshua Commission tell us don't linger over here in the wilderness go and take the land but God wants his people to dispossessed every inhabitant of spiritual Kingdom every devil and every Prince of pine every power is under your feet and the God of peace shall put Satan under your feet listen he ordained your feet to do it a man no I tell you what my feet I walk around every now and then I get sore feet and I rub my feet and I think man it's it's so hard to walk but just think these same feet that I suffer with today they're gonna be changed one day they sent feet right now have power and they're not the physical body but every footstep as a possession you say what do you mean by that listen every footstep you might not think this is some great thing today say we're just gonna have another church service we're just gonna get together once again you shown up today it's supernatural you believe in God one more day is supernatural because the supernatural God lives inside the supernatural people and they're very footsteps they're ordered up the Lord the fish stuff for normal body you might look normal to the world but there's nothing normal about him now some of us already look less normal than the others people probably wouldn't say I'm normal that's alright you know it's the nuts that hold all the young together they say hi Alysa there's something different about you you've been ordained to take a land hey man he says this aren't you glad you're how the lunar so remember they had to eat manna angels food out of heaven until they crossed over the land and when they crossed over the land the manna ceased to fall they were fully matured than and they eat the old corn of the land's out now you're not babies anymore well hallelujah that's the truth you know you're not designed to sincere milk of the gospel you don't be babied and padded and persuaded to come to church you know it amuses me how you preach the fire you preach about church attends to people that show up to church it wasn't even here the ones that aren't there you know I'm saying like you show up on a mid-weight guy man we need to show up to church more and the people say Amen that showed up a man but that's mature Christians you don't have to pick you don't have to tell him to pray you don't have to tell them to read the Bible you left on the serve God you ain't got a Pamela bat and force them through a pop I know some people rollercoaster Christians and you've always got to make them do everything God don't want us to be that way that wants just to show up and grow up and do a job because we're something wrong you guys listen we've got we've got a tuner over us and what kind of report does he have about our lives this morning is he saying my my daughter my son's been faithful they've kept the word of promise they've held fast to their confession they're walking in the promised land or is he got sagging a baby him I got trimmed the same way they got the same hang-ups I did 30 years ago they haven't overcome the same thing they didn't walk around the same mountain for 40 years what kind of a testament is God how about us this morning well holiday yes truth any haha he says you're not for persuading to come to church now that you're really fully matured Christians you're ready strong meats now you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to understand something that's deep in a rich he says we'll get into it directly he says it's been hidden since the foundation of the world he said now you've come into this I'm addressing this he says to you not to those who've just left Egypt not to those who are still in the journey but to those who are in the promised land that has received the promise and he asked the question how many's received the promise of the Holy Ghost he says aren't you glad you're in the land now how eating the old corn eating the strong things of God and you've got a clearer understanding your spiritual Minds own unmodeled up he said you know exactly who he is you know exactly what he is you know exactly where you're going you know exactly all about it you're know in the whom you have believed and persuaded he is able to keep that which you've committed to him against the day he says that's the one Paul is talking to a man praise the Lord listen to how much just I want you to notice now what he's saying is he says you ready to understand something he says that how many's received the promises you've got a clearer understanding notice I'm where the RAM keeps talking about this say men in other words when you come into the promise that there's an there's an understanding that accompanies that that you didn't have in the wilderness and what is it it's an understanding of position that's what they didn't know the loaners that they learned in the land when they come in under a Joshua Commission god buy them out to Joshua by the inspiration of God now listen they didn't lay out in this land ahead of time and take photos you know they'd send a drone out and survey the land say well we're gonna cut this part up here and I want this mountain here and I want this that know God by inspiration when they come into the land they need understanding this is where Ephraim is gonna be and this is where my Nass is gonna be and this is where Judah is gonna be now they could choose if they want to stand the other side of the river and live off manna but there was no matter their hey man the manna ceased whether they went in or not praise the Lord somebody listen you couldn't just leave out so the promise and say well we're gonna have a smitten rock we're gonna have God's not doing that his chilling have gone into a land this should have entered into something else praise the Lord and we're entering there's an understanding of a position or an inheritance that comes with that brother Ram says emphasis here sets us like Joshua positions as you notice Josh Oh after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land he from here Manasseh here and this one GAD here Benjamin here he divided the land notice he says this is burns in our hearts every one of these Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke of the very place in her labor pains think about that her very prophetic groanings were in labor the very labor pains the very trials and persecutions that a church is gone there spoke of who they where it spoke of their anointing in their age they didn't know at the time so Joshua took him into and they man and that would be positioning the land notice the positioning in the Promised Land is what we're talking about you think about what we've had in this day we've had a messenger come under a Joshua Commission and his position not just us but each other church age listen Wesley didn't know his own age Luther didn't know zone age but under this entering into a promise under this adopts in tomorrow's endtime seed sign when they come in the promised land I want you to notice it was the harvest time because the corn was on the wheat was on the stock already it was a time of the harvest and when they entered into the land that's when Joshua positions that he says this was for their age and this is for their age but we've got something else we've come not just until later to see in condition but we've risen above the hats into a word age where every promise in the book is ours like a spark that's lit off of something you can have what you ask if you cannot believe all things are possible [Music] [Applause] listen what limited them in their day their understanding they didn't understand what was all fully theirs but the understanding brings the positioning when you understand what belongs you you can go walk out you know how to get back you know where it's at you know where it starts like a priest last time you got a landmark you know where it starts you know where it stops you know exactly all about it the confusion is gone notice the Devils the awesome confusion God's not the author of confusion but of peace well hallelujah that's the truth God is not the author listen if you're walking on confusion if you don't know your rights just today you're in a righteous tomorrow they're got two souls that I got one am i up am i down whatever other kind of nonsense is he come back in a cloud or horse what the the confusion see says when the dissolve our doubts comes in you're not walking around in confusion you've got peace because he's the Prince of Peace amen oh yeah I'm high supernaturally they were positioned amen the book of Hebrews tells us in the seventh chapter taught my Melchizedek he says look how consider how great this man was on whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the Spoils and barely they they're the sons of Levi he received the office of appreciate they have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of Abraham but he whose descent is not counted from them receiveth receive tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises hey man and without all contradiction the lasas blessed of the better here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom and his witness that he liveth and as I may so say Levi also who received tithes paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father would look as anak met him him and I believe I talked about this liver the last time for you that were here a man but notice what brother Ram says he says let's look at the Hebrews the seventh chapter the Bible says milk hesitant Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kingdom blessed him it said now Levi he's talking about paying ties and Levi had an order from the Lord to receive ties from his brethren and Levi who received ties paint Tai's he was hit in the loins of Abraham when he met Melchizedek Abraham was his great-grandfather Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Levi Levi father grandfather great-grandfather while Levi was in the loins of Abraham the Bible said he paid tithes to Melchizedek he says hallelujah because I look excited about something there says don't let nobody tell you that any kind of a move in the world can ever interfere with God's great she's moving right on there ain't a devil or enough Devils can interfere with this program listen when you're in the lowest you're subject to the elements and the conditions of the Ronis but if this promised land that don't affect you anymore the trials can come and sickness can come persecutions can come but nothing can take you out of the hand of God when you realize you're already in his hand we have a recognition that God has he has you in his hand and there's not one that can pluck you from his hand that brings the rest amen - no there's nothing can stop you you come from God and you're going back to God amen I says now the Bible didn't say potentially he paint it think about that now the Bible said he paid tithes when he was in his great-grandfather's loins glory he says that's my Lord and then listen he didn't just potentially are sort of doing a shadow or it looked like he did he really didn't pay ties the Bible said the Bible credits him with the righteous of doing that in his father Abraham and listen if you died was Christ at Calvary I don't look that's just a nice finger speech or just a nice poetic philosophy I believe you really did die with him at Calvary if you're part of that Word of God if you're part of that same spirit when he died you literally died with him but when he rose praise God do you literally rose up with them on the third day you're literally right now Justice of God in Christ Jesus not potentially not a hope so not maybe you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus old things are passed away all things are new and they're all of God now listen if you rose up with him on the third day then you can't die and then you can't die you don't already died once you might not remember it but you were there when they crucified my Lord when they put the captivity captive on high they cried out when they asked who is this King of glory he said open up here everlasting gates who is this King of glory the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory you who were dead in sins and trespasses yet he hath quickened he's revived you like I said last time - give me an exorcist he let's breathe something into your life I'm not waiting for a revival this is my reliable this is my promise Kenan is my destination I've got nowhere else to go I'm not looking to go back to Egypt I'm not looking to go over to Babylon I'm not looking to go over to some other place amen I've come to my promise the vehm talking about this Levi's paying tithes he says if he says how aren't you people to live by think about that he says if your sins are visited to the children what about your blessings I'll tell you what I'd rather talk about my blessings in my sins it's true hey man listen leave you can throw the Christian books for a day and they've got all kinds of books on generational curses and and how to overcome this and how to overcome that and well you had you had such and such and your family 14 generations ago so that's why you've got this condition they've got all kinds of things to talk about that I'm thinking I don't I don't need that I'm one generation removed away from Almighty God I'm a new creature in Christ that's not who I am and if God listen if instead of cursing and insane nests and things would come on people because of things are their great-grandfather or their great-great-grandfather who did what about the blessings on the life of a believer listen maybe you've got children or loved ones today and they're out in the world their hearts so maybe they're away from God and you might be wondering yourself today how can i how will they ever overcome how can God never we gonna hold her life what can I do about listening God if you were visit the cursings upon the people that were disobedient how much more will he visit the blessing upon his people he's made a promise in his Bible that you would be in a promised land with your offspring he's given you a token a promise you can believe it doesn't matter what kind of Darkness they're in or what kind of condition my god is more than able this is if you can bring you out of Egypt surely he can reach out to the lowness the wireless for such for some of you know somewhere you were adopters and whoremongers and vile and filthy but yet God save you and you've been washed by the washing of the water up the word [Applause] praise the Lord that's what we do we focus on the bad well I did this I did that yeah but God did this and God did that oh but I've got this my past but before that God said something about you before that God saw something about you he's telling you holy he saw your righteous he saw you accepted in the beloved but he saw your downfalls he saw your weaknesses he saw your mistakes and he loved you anyhow before you knew about him before you did him before you got disappointed in yourself for doing it he knew all about me loved you anyway he said I'm in a provision I've given you a place of promise where it's settled and all the reproaches rolled away hey man I believe that old man's dead you ought to bury him hey man I believe he's dead you got to bear him and not dig him back up every three days and try and preach another funeral to on repent for the same old thing over and over again put him in the ground and leave him there put me to believe him there we are new creatures in Christ Jesus my lie to think about the promises that God had waiting for them in this land what do you wanted to do with them and yet there was a people that didn't want to walk into the land why is it because they become accustom to a certain kind of life a man they become accustomed to just well this is all the better I can get this is all the more God can do for me this is I'm just gonna have to live in this condition for the rest of my life and they become they become complacent they resigned themselves this idea that this is all God can do for me this this is good enough hey man think about that now if we're not careful we'll do the same thing well I think God he did something for me 30 years ago I thank God for it too but where are you at today did you stop somewhere did you move on with God amen praise the Lord I'm on praise the Lord you think about this now to enter into the Promised Land why was it so important because as I talked about a little bit last time because it was not just your possession it was your brother's possession was your sister's possession and then for us to enter the promised land it's not just you it's just me that that's what the devil tries to do to us I mean you watch the church and God says we went to church and he's blessing the people what does the devil try to do we try to come in and sow the seed of discord why because he knows if he can if it can divide you that you're not you you're not as blessed is when you come together you look even the two and a half tribes didn't want to enter into the Promised Land and Josh who made him go in anyway and possess the land with their brothers so that there won't be discouraged they had a job to do a man nyaah listen we we've had like I said we've had so many great testimonies throughout history what God has done for his people but in this age we have a recognition we've been positioning man I think God forward you back there but listen we've come to something better than just manna hey man praise the Lord you look at the word man that something's what is Nathan salad didn't know what God was doing but we've come into an understanding hey man we've crossed into a place for that original seed that had been lying in the gravel hung when Abraham had walked there that seed was in the seed that was in a seed that was in a seat somewhere and that same life was there now on the stop ready for harvest amen ha ha ha so here this generation of people comes in and what happens they get circumcised that's the first thing Joshua does it brings him in the promisin and he circumcised them with the same circumcision they had back with Abraham the same life and they came through that was the same life amen I believe brothers and sisters that God has given us something in this day I believe we can have the same Holy Ghost but they have them the day of Pentecost we'd have to sell for a handshake or a sprinkle somewhere we're gonna have power we have authority we get on the bus you the gospel of Christ let me get back there and even better cuz you've got an understanding that accompanies that amen well prison listen I I'm tired of people tell me I can't have what somebody used to have well that was just for the Apostles well that was just for brother songs huh or that was just for certain there I'm tired of hearing the devil trying to keep me out of my promised land God said it's fine you can put giants there you can put walled cities there it don't matter to God it all falls before the power God the captain the host of the army of the Lord has come down to lead us to victory look he didn't come to lead you back to Jordan to retreat you ain't give me the power to back up on Devil's or to cave into sickness or to give up and defeat he gave me the power to cast out sin and sickness and darkness and then what we need today is a stronger wishbone and get a backbone in her says I believe every word of God I don't care what anybody say about it the promise is for me it's for the children it's for all in our far off it's for my church it's for my kids it's for my wife it's for my husband I can have the power and the blessing of God God set your message so you would understand that belongs do you look you don't belong to everybody but to you that I understand you even have crossed over here and your understandings on muddled up it's for you mama listen I'm not ashamed of the gospel Christ I believe God did a thing a certain time for the RAM said if God ever did a thing for a man ever at one time he's obligated to do the same thing for anybody who come on the same basis cuz he's not a respecter of persons and man I believe that hey man listen now we do I believe that I'm feeling on that I come in the land and I sticks on that corner I say I'm gonna make this into something I'm hungry I've had we've had manna free agent I've got something even better I've got the unfailing body word of the son of man listen a man's words of failure a man that man is good for a day but this comes this is the true brand that cometh down from heaven jesus said your father's ate manna in the wilderness and they died but I am the true bread which descended from heaven and if a man would eat this bread he'll never hungry again oh praise God I believe in him so satisfied in Christ I believe he could draw from the wells of Bethlehem Oh Holly you can draw from the fountain of grace and never thirst again I believe there's something somewhere that satisfies the searching soul it'll satisfy not from one revival to the next not from one church means when that's it'll seal to the day of the redemption we're immature Christian and then Christian when nobody's around nobody has to make him serve God you can be a Daniel in the middle of Babylon with no pastor to pat you on the back and no Deaton in the back here up and make you go to church and you'll still serve God you'll still praise God Who am I I believe we've got a fountain open hey man there was a fountain open in the house of David that day at Calvary and the water blood flowed from his side whoa does those that are a search that they could come and drink hey man you think about that they coming in the promised son again there was Wells in that promise land that Jacob had dug hundreds of years before Jacob what type of grace for the RAM said dwells a lot of haven't done that's what the woman's the well John said before came to him as a well that Jacob had dog hey man said well our Father said okay drink from it our Father Jacob dug this well where our fathers say worship here and that you say worship here they said listen there's another fountain there's another pump that that was good for a day that was good for a season like that man up but there's one here and if you knew who he was on my some of you off you knew who's here right now look it's not me it's not you Jesus is here if you really recognize who is here you and asked for a drink and you would never searched again if your lot of fussing and fighting and being depressed and all kinds of nonsense that tries to drag you down huh listen I'm not up here to beat you up then you got enough against you as it is all the devils and hell are out against this bride but you brought a place to stand you've got a place of strength where the gates of hell can't even prevail against you I got to push you down the devil do that just fine I was oh but if I could just encourage somebody that you know huh you're going through something God has brought you to somewhere well you can drink and you can eat you don't have to go next day and find something else you've got an inheritance you've got a dwelling place you didn't even build it let me say this me it's a house made without hands not your hands anyway he's gonna Hoff's me without hands if this earthly house of a tabernacle be dissolved we've got one ring you don't have to go build a future home he's prepared a place for you he's prepared a place for you oh my dad says this and why a little Bethlehem he says is you can only live in the natural by dead substance something had to die so that you can live natural he said how much more did something have to die so you can live eternally he said Christ died that we might live eternally and he become the house of God's eternal life bread that we cats freshly every hour of the day coming down from God out of heaven the form of the holy spirit feeds our hungry souls as we sit together in heavenly places he says he is our Bethlehem then all true believing sons of God are born in Bethlehem with him notice the position again a man you're if you were son of God or your daughter God you're born in Bethlehem with him he says if Christ had become the bread of life to be born in Bethlehem which is life's bread house then every one of true believers in Christ is born in Christ they're born in God's Bethlehem what is better than the house of God's bread amen not the house of God's manna in the wilderness mister place of bread eternal life bread he says Jesus born Medlen I was born in Bethlehem you were born in Bethlehem how did you do it right here in Phoenix Arizona he said this morning the Romagna you can be born again in God's Bethlehem house of eternal life bread eat and live forever I've been told my position inheritance this morning I want you think about little Bethlehem why little Bethlehem it's the house of God's bread God set up this portion from an ass and Ephraim and way up here in Judah which had nothing to do with priesthood not from Levites but we're appearing to you there's a little town up there and God ordained it to being the tribe of Judah a little Bethlehem you can look at how Purim talks about you can read the history of life it's the center of agriculture they all come from miles it could feed the whole region it could feed the whole nation from Bethlehem there was so much Brad there it was more than what Judah needed it was enough to feed everybody hey man there was an abundance of grace that supplied to them from the house of little Judah of little Bethlehem hey man and what you think about this little Bethlehem because there's something special about this remember christ is born in Bethlehem a man there was a man in him either one but the Bible tells us by the name of Boas you know about the house and he he lived in Bethlehem and bible tells us about this man Boaz in Bethlehem listen there was a seed inside of this man that was waiting to be expressed to be born in Bethlehem and God took a little girl by the name of Ruth her her mommy Naomi was needing somebody to feed her her sons had died and her husband had died and all she had was little rooster take care of her and where did she come she come to little Bethlehem it was there enough of him she met this predestinated Baal has met has predestinated Ruth's because there had to be an oven born in the house of Boaz in Bethlehem there's gonna be a Jesse born in Bethlehem there's gonna be a David born in Bethlehem because there's gonna be a son of David one day born in Bethlehem listen this woman you're looking at your life and you might be you might feel sorry for her she does lost her husband and her father-in-law and she had nothing and she comes back for him but listen God had it for a reason someone's come out of all kinds of homes kinds of walks of life he'd come out of affliction of maybe abuse even and maybe death in the family and heartache and you wonder why did I have to go through these things why did I have to suffer with this one why did I come a certain kind of a family why did I go through certain things in my life but listen God was trying to bring to a place the tender hand of Jehovah was trying to lead you down to Bethlehem because that's the only place but the son and daughter of God can be born as a little Bethlehem and he'll use your trials and they use afflictions these heartaches here disappointments use your own mind battles but the devil's tried to purpose against you to destroy you God will use them for good God will you lead you down to Bethlehem through afflictions through trials to bring you to a bow eyes cuz it's there in Bethlehem Boaz is waiting to bring forth the promised son Oh hallelujah you think about Christ himself his parents said his adoptive parents who say that way they lived in they live in Nazareth but a decree went out throughout all the earth if the people should be taxed listen dollars and take your taxes and using the benefit take your taxes and bless she said how's that gonna happen well didn't you think about a profit line VRS we're gonna go through tax trouble listen does he go through that just for his own sake or for an example for you look God is able to take your trials and even your mistakes and use them for his blind we can either get disappointed and we can get a scourge and we can look at ourselves and throw up our hands and give up or we can say you know what God is greater than my past love is greater than my mistakes God is greater than my family history and sickness and what doctors say and what bankers saying what teachers say and what even though the preachers say Amen God is greater than all that God can take me to Bethlehem why do the taxation go through all the earth to bring a promised son to Bethlehem why do you go through things because God has brought you somewhere you you want to plant it all on your own your own heart devises your own ways but the Lord directs your steps and you might not even you might not you might be like me you might never even heard about a prophet of God growing up you might not even went to church we yet were here some up God through the midst of all this difficulty and in darkness he is led us to Bethlehem what is it it's the house of God's bread a place where you can be full and be satisfied with the Word of God my tell you what even Caesar couldn't stop it even Herod couldn't stop it listen there's nothing that can stop it it's so it's the law of God that's who you are if you're in Christ you were born a little Bethlehem you might have had to come through la Cruz you might have come out just remember Christ will be born a mess for him in your life amen praise the Lord listen you didn't place yourself there God brought you there we that are here today than in Christ I didn't bring you here you didn't bring me here some man someone didn't bring you here a man God brought you here hey man what you really consider that God brought you into the land these people that didn't want enter into the land they'd forgotten God already brought them off if God can rain hit off that catches on fire and some up frogs and lice everything else you don't think you can bring down the walls of Jericho hey man don't think you can slay Giants is that right listen he's the true bread from heaven is that right my my I want you to think about this for a second I want to come to something here a man because this this is the thing God has a purpose like I said in this if you are part of that original Word of God or that seed the Bible says this in Isaiah 55 says first the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and returns not feather but it waters the earth and makes it bring forth and bud they be give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth something about you now he's not saying man he's not just talking out the words on the page here he's talking about you amen it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish I believe right now this morning it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper and the thing we run to I said it listen if God has placed a purpose in your life it's got to come to pass and then don't look at the discouragement don't look at the trial look at the purpose of God looking where you come from and what you spin you can recognize I'm not what I used to be I'm not where I come from God has brought me into a goodly land a land that flows with milk and honey yeah you might have to rise up and fight every night yeah there might be Giants but God has given you the promise this is a land that flows with milk and honey this is a place it's worth it listen it's worth every fight it's worth every trial but if God is in you it's him that worketh in you too willing to do his good pleasure it shall not go forth mine look I've been saving lose you got it you up out of the mire sin they'll let you fall he's not gonna let one word follow the ground Omaha he shall accomplish in your life and in your home and in your work what pleases him its seed to the sower and it's bread to the eater hey man you think about Jesus is on his own life his own ministry he says I'm the true bread that comes from heaven in the in the Last Supper with his disciples he takes the bread he breaks the bread his brother races this is my body take eat this bread is my body the bread is speaking of his body or the manifestation of the seed or the life that was on the inside amen what is the brightness of manifestation or the fruition of what was on the what was on the original life of that tree or that seed or that harvest amen amen jesus said himself talking about his life and Saint John the twelfth chapter says except a quarter we die and go into the ground it abides alone but let now look you can't make bread out of just water but if you ever put that in the ground you get across you can make bread out of the house Amen somebody hallelujah he said it'll bring forth much fruit if it goes in the ground and dies the life that was in Christ goes into the ground it dies he raised up again and when he raises up again you raised with him now there's a purpose that's what I'm trying to come to this we talked about the scene of God the word of God here life the harvest time a man you can look in Matthew chapter 13 the parable of the seed sower the son of man told a good seed and the wicked sowed an evil seed is that right but the purpose of the song of the seed well it's not just the harvest amen praise the Lord listen the purpose of the man in the war was not just to survive off the manna there was something more beyond that they had to come into a promise and possess the land and live off the land we talk about a harvest time and a wave sheep in a ministry of a prophet I think God for those things but many times we stop there and acknowledging that and we missed there's one more step that were missing which is that the Angels go in jesus said in matthew 13 what are the angels they're the Reapers the angels go in at the harvest and they gather the wheat into his bed and his garner is that right why then it might become Bread on his table listen you don't want to just leave it on oh my god you know I've been overseas I've been overseas and I look at that I've been in the heart of the voice of God now Ivory Coast they got a whole warehouse full of books just waiting to be delivered to this country and that country in that country they're there waiting for spiritual food and due season and thank god there's been food stored up for them and they're just waiting to get maybe their fortieth book maybe the 20s book in their language they're just they're just so excited about getting something from God having some bread to put on the table having something to eat knowing that same God that same Jesus performs the same sign breaks that same bread of life to have that amen listen I've got the whole message on this right here we've got at home we've got sitting around with that spiritual food store that but if we're not careful we'll leave it sit on the vine outside and we'll starve to death when there's food right there Amen somebody got since the Reapers he says the angels for the harvest cuz he doesn't want to just leave it on a page somewhere he don't want to leave our device somewhere he wants it to be manifest in you what was the bread of life it was a manifestation of Christ in his body what is it in you it's a manifestation of Christ in your life you say what do you mean listen he wants to take you from just having a seed to be embedded on his table he wants to change your vile body into a glorious body lacking into his own bread he wants you to possess his own likeness his own fullness of his attributes a man not just to look at it and their knowledge but to take it and possess it and either the bread of life amen my my you think about these I think about Ruth amen The Book of Ruth says in the same chapter I don't you think about this Bruce was taking care of my Boaz like I'm talking about this morning why did Boaz take care of ruse he gave her Commandments amen reach up to verse 8 says then said Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my daughter he says go not to glean in another field hey man now I didn't want to go to the field he had his eye on is why you said I want you walking around all these other men I'll give you whatever you want you just stay here in my field stay with the message just say what the tape say don't add your own interpretation don't add to or take away don't try to hide it or do something with it stay in my field stay in my possession don't go into another field agree he's gonna bide here fast by my maiden's he had some other women some other church changes they lived in the same field they'd they'd harvested in the same field a man mom eyes is like not dying eyes beyond the field he says let thine eyes be on the field then they do reap and go after them he says have i not charge the young men that they shall not touch thee prince god that's got some reapers rose got some angels there's coming to the harvest and they're not manhandle this bride they've been commanded not to touch this body I've seen going into another field who knows what I happen to avert you what happened to her the woman but she was safe as long as you stayed with the Reapers and Boaz his fiddle boy I says I don't want you touching that woman coz I've got my eye on her listen he's jealous over you with a godly jealousy he know what you're making eyes with the world he's given commandment to faithful ministers faithful messengers faithful apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers not to manhandle the spread not to add their own idea to it have I not charged a young man at least shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels you really have to go pull it up I have vessels I've got vessels or danger glory with drinking them go drink about what's a young men have drawn they've got water they've got spiritual food in due season all you have to do is stay in this field you don't have to go pull it up or crank it out of a broken cistern somewhere you a left pull off the line I've commanded these men to take that seat and leave a little on the ground for you you don't even have to know harvest it you just call him and you stand up for him you stay in my field you stay in the field your kinsman redeemer hey man you go that Maya think about the waters Bethan david desired the waters of Bethlehem I made those cool waters of Bethlehem we've got something better today we've got the life of Jesus Christ we've got an everlasting everlasting fun of life it'll never run dry chosen vessels chosen reapers chosen mate is that right all with one purpose take care of that woman out there I've got my eye on her listen I love the Bible says she had a recognition she come back - Naomi one night said where'd you get all this food where'd you get this message from I've never heard of the aliveness in the Church of Christ I've never heard any lightness in the Catholic Church oh there's a man by the name of our house he said to stand my field he'll take care of me every day he sound what she did something Gallade his feet that man is a kinsman redeemer she had a recognition of who he was he was more than just a nice man more than just a hippie a historical Jesus of 2000 years ago but there was a relationship that she recognized - that's her kinsman redeemer you go and you laid his feet and he will not rest until he has done the work hallelujah some money we tried so hard we try so hard as Christians overcome and that's why we fail let Boaz do the work you come into the field you abide in this field and you feed on this word of God as you drink from these ones he will do the work he'll go prepare a house Hipple build your future home he'll get all your their furniture ready laterally out for him he'll feed you and clothe you he needed something to drink and what is risk dealing the whole time resting resting at the feet above eyes look she found favor in his side she didn't have it she didn't have to earn favorite inside she found fair why cuz she was a chosen vessel for that life that was in BO has to be expressed there had to be a David come forth they'll have a covenant to have a son of David there was a need for expression hey man where's Laura there was a need for expression God had to bring the past amen mama you think about this brother man says this in Abraham and his seed after him he said we've had every side justification sanctification baptism the Holy Spirit placing the son manifestation of the Spirit says now are the changing of the body for the rapture in other words the seed becoming bread the bread is the body the body changes them is the bread and what one says this in uncertain sound he says this he says I always wondered he's talking about when he was younger he said I was one to live to see Jesus come said I never want to be a spirit I was always afraid of spooks huh I didn't wanted I'm to come a little clown I listened he had his own idea then an understanding come he said I wanna be a little clouds floating around and see my brothers say there they are ah I wish I could shake their hand but they ain't got no hand shake and it's dead and there in the grave his ISM then was made alive that scripture if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting Amen some he says oh just move right here into that one he says I tell you that gives us great hopes listen when I hear that Scripture I don't know what it does for you but let me tell you what that's for me that gives me great hopes if I get sick if I die on the way today if something would have happened to me and they took this body and they burnt me to cast my ashes in the wind yeah I've got one waiting already trying to know how some people filled out but I don't think God has to make it up and I get there I believe it was there before the foundational Oh God furnished me a tabernacle I give this great hope same hand this time seed sign it's a harvest ministry it's an incorruptible body amen Levin says this in a man running from the presence of the Lord he says I believe we have the truth he said I'm satisfied of that so it was rude that's the nature Ruth to rest in the field of bars not go from field to field to denomination the idea the philosophy tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine now she's found the place of rest I'm satisfied but see some people who just never satisfied that's why they can't sit in their pasture that's why I can't go the same church for money here that's why they're always fussing and fighting they're never satisfied listen you get satisfied you don't have to prove nothing to nobody you ain't gonna prove somebody else the church wrong if you arrived I mean you ain't gonna validate yourself you can be satisfied monona you have the truth hey man well praise the Lord Jesus said blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness why they shall be filled the bless he hasn't just been hungry in thirsting the blessing is that you hunger and thirst and there's something to fail you and then there's something that you can come to you're not looking for something but you've come to a place we're not ever learning but you've come to a knowledge of the truth I believe this is the truth and I'm satisfied hey man listen listen if this message don't satisfy us what will well hallelujah I'm a preacher in hell and then some people do not satisfy this missus they go out and they get a bunch of piercings or tattoos or they go work out in there they're taking pictures and putting themselves on there they've got this kind of drug in this contradiction never satisfied they weren't satisfied in church they're not gonna be satisfied outside of church listen they can't live with themselves how are you gonna cope with them amen you've got to come to something like this field I'm talking about there's definitely something that settles all the doubt say man he says I believe the weed is absolutely says the shark is pulling away from it Amen I know she does the point away hey man the shot pulls away from the weak not the weak point away from the look we we don't have to pull away from people I don't believe we should be that type of people hey man I've seen it so many times people do begin to pull away and if we're not careful we push them away I don't believe that's the right attitude a man I believe we should be available listen if we're not available to help somebody how they bring get help a man we ought to be able to draw on the circle bigger hell I just stood there for free he says the shock is pulling away from it you know he says a CI may give a little preload on that tomorrow night when he preaches the seeds higher of the shock he says how the shuck is pulling away from the weight is but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the Sun why is this happening that we has to lay in the presence of the Sun to ripen I believe brother Graham mentioned 7 times the message I believe I have to go back to count again but he meant to sometimes laying in the presence of the Sun amen he says it has to stay in the presence of the Sun they meant to ripen that's what we're here for friend stay in the presence of the Sun watch I says it still our little group of people here till becomes so right to Christ it becomes bread on his table that's the goal amen why are we ripening in the presence on to become bread on his table he says that's what I want to do amen everyone talks about this in questions answers every one more quote here a man he says it's in question answers 1964 he's talking about the Book of Daniel this is the Bible said that when Daniel when he wrote the he calls the first book of Revelation Daniel he says we noticed the vision he come to the ancient of time whose hair was white as wool he's how many remember reading that he says I he and did you notice John and revelation came to the same thing revelation one he stood there his hair was as white as wool his feet in the way it looked ancient of time ancient of time has had no time the eternal one and he came as now watch the saints come to the earth and the books were opened and another book was opened which was the book of life one luck they came to the judgment and he came and with him came ten thousands time ten thousands is that right so who's that comes with him he says ministering to him the bride the queen and king he says who is the little Queen in your home she ministers food to you is that right he says when she ministers to you that's what the bride and I think this is profoundly a man that's what the bride ministers to Christ the word man shall not live by bread alone but every word see she ministers the word to the king manifesting his promised word in the age she's living in and he says Amen he said I said something that he didn't get it he says notice oh my that was a good one I thought was pretty good too so good I thought preached the whole message about it amen notice we talked about him ministering to us but who is ministering to him the bride how does she miss her him she misses the word of the age by manifesting it that's how she ministered to him Narns me ministering to you you're ministering to me the body ministering to one another becomes bright on his table the manifestation of it that's what he's looking for in other words what can I do for Christ become Bread on his table hey he says this my ministering lineage the word notice she came and ten thousands time ten thousands came and the judgment was set in the book open to the other book was opened which is the book of life and there was a judge who was this that come the bride which did not have to come the judgment listen he's not taking you to judgment he's taking him to Brotherhood's table he wants you to come and put this right on the table he wants the life of Christ in you to be manifest that's how you serve Him you present yourself a living sacrifice back to him look God don't bless you used to bless you he's blessed me for a reason he wants you to enter in to embody change he wants you to be his future home he wants that Bread on his table listen a loon of his body loss problems in his heart aches yes since I don't want to bring this thing to God this way I want something that's fit to be my table but I think AHA he's allowing angels drop the seat on the ground and all the things I need their land right there and boy watch this video there's only one thing you've got to do go pick it up go pick it up and make it into bread hey man you say why are you saying all this because God that's his goal he meant the bread of life listen if his body was broken to be healing I believe he's still healer today I'm if he died for your sins I believe he's still saved you from sin today is that right God has not changed his nature or his character a man I believe that God wants something for us more than just to be blessed he wants us to have that box listen he knows what it's like you say brother you don't know what I've been through today you don't know what I've gone through listen he knows was like to feel sickness he knows like to be tempted and he wants something better for you hey man well praise the Lord listen I come in here today I know how you coming to church day I come into church today praying and I tell you what when I come in the back room the devil was talking to me when I come to back room maybe like he did some of you let me know what a failure I am as a minister and how I failed God my lifelong mistakes I made I don't know where that even come from or maybe it was maybe it's just for today I don't know hey man but then I just got hit so strong when I come to church but what a failure and how you can't do nothing to help the people of God how you can't do this and you'll never be this I thought I never said I could anyway I've never claimed nothing but he made a promise the other say you've sinned too much in your lives didn't do something for God he's making many mistakes God's bring them how mistakes I said good Network I first heard part in the devil said listen devil it's true I've made many mistakes I come home from travel last week I tried to be a daddy to my children I tried to be a husband to my wife I tried to do all these things and it's true I may have made many mistakes even just this last week but there's one thing I know God is still going on and no matter what I've done God is still faithful I may have felt God I may have made mistakes but the God that I serve the God that you suck he's greater than those things he's not willing to let you just have another service because I made a mistake because you made a mistake he's willing to say I'm greater than those things don't be bound by your past don't be bummed by doubts the devil would love for you praise the Lord somebody the devil would love for us to come in here and say you know you know one person brother Ram Singh can hinder the service and I'm that one that's what we do that's what the devil tell you said you're that one that that God just can't help that God just can't reach and now the whole service is gonna be bad and the whole thing is just gonna it's just gonna be a wash you all say why do we waste their time and you're that one but listen the Prophet said if one person can change the atmosphere negatively one person can change the atmosphere the right carbon atmosphere well the man come home one day than atmosphere like that one person in the hands of God and you can surrender the will of God and walk right up beside God and coming to Boaz is filled one person can change the whole dynamic of his church of a service of the home of a job no man so ever like I'm not Louis I know not the only one that does that - he'll let you know yeah yeah hello you know were you just gonna have a horrible time at church today you're gonna go home with the same problems the same mind bowels and you'll never overcome well listen I'm not in the devil's field anymore the devil don't feed me you don't don't water me the devil don't take care of me I'm not made of the devil that old man died I've been married to Christ and Christ is faithful you say but this brother and that brother in this person that has nothing to do it God's not letting the Reapers touch you Amen somebody listen we make mistakes and we fail and God says so wife what I have done is greater say we put more confidence in her own weakness in his strange a man and his strength has only made perfect in our weakness listen if it's the times you feel the weakest that's when God's is strongest you sit there in charge and you feel overwhelmed by life you feel overwhelming circumstances say I don't know I can make it and that's right at the time then that God comes on the scene and drop begins to move in the service and go up against the move in trouble the face of the waters and God does something your life somebody's a witness to God does it listen the devil wants you to know that you're wasting your time but I say that God is more than able to bless you today God is more than able to do something for you today you say you know maybe you didn't pray enough I didn't pray 20 hours of sweet God help us I wish you were more faithful about that why not pray 20 hours this week I didn't see Mitch and I didn't raise no dad this week but you're still here you're still making footsteps you're still serving God when the Devils try to Buffalo you and talk you out of it every day a lot yet you're still here this would be in the gutter somewhere or a bar or that old like the cop right in here this I'm just sitting on the penis and if you're a Christian you're more than just sit home whew you're very down sitting and you're uprising is blessed you're coming in you're going out as boss a minister would you tie your shoes in the morning you're blessed when you brush your teeth as one of your rights yes what are you looking the man you see worried you see wrinkles you see old ain't sitting and don't see the Sun not see the daughter of God listen God's not gonna allow my weakness to get in the way of your blessings God's not allow your weakness to get in the way of this purpose in your life and then God's not listen sell the unbelief of some hinder God God for bed listen unbelief only hinder you doesn't hinder God a man don't let unbelief hinder you don't walk away and say I'm gonna go to another field you know I've been to church and I've heard preachers and I just can't seem to overcome hey man don't let the devil talk you out of boys his field a man listen listen God knows a man I don't even know why I'm saying this this morning all son but God is aware of what you've gone through God's aware of the trials and the tempted you said this brother up here in the public he don't know what I've been through I haven't I might not know what you've been through God knows listen God knows and he's fully aware like I said earlier he knows all these things and he chose you anyway that's why there's something different about you than the rest of the maidens in the field he said his eye on you you're the apple of his eye amen think about that I hide my beloved my beloved his mind there's something different about you than all the other daughters and then you say oh I'm black and I'm on calmly I don't look good I'm not good enough this is all now our fear my love oh your your beautiful little Lillian you're further than 10,000 to be listen he looks through the very portals of heaven oh can you imagine bow hands out there in that field she's out there not realising yet what was even going on you might not even realize your life was going on and she's up there just trying to stay alive just trying to make ends meet no the boys out there in the doorway I don't want to be so busy working she can't notice me leave some more food on the ground for oh how he's just waiting for his bride you said I got time to pray and got time news he's trying to make you find time cuz this is hard just skips a beat when you look his way oh she's the bride she's she's come to pray she's come to have service with me just come to sit at my table with me oh oh ha mix his heart race oh how he longs for us to have fellowship with him and we get so busy with the cares of life trying to do the right thing not even simple things just just busy with a life and the cares our lives like with Mary and Martha listen we get so busy with things and I laugh but one thing is needful I sit at the feet of Jesus he says look uh I know what you have need of seek first the king of God misery I should hide all these things of you I'll take care of you listen I've been guilty of being too busy wondering how I'm gonna get by you know what I haven't started yet you can tell far from it I'm going off the foul line now hey man listen I'd starve yard I've never seen the righteous forsaken I've never seen his seed begging brother and then God still faithful and all the times I worried never add one cubit to my statute never change one thing in my life but God is taking care of me even when I didn't believe you I wasn't sure how God is taking care of me he's brought me through sickness he's brought me through on paint bills he's brought me through depression and darkness and sin he brought me into a fiddling light hand and you're feeling all the while just waiting well I hope she notices me today Oh hope I hope she looks my way I hope she stops stooping over just long enough to look up and see me I'm watching her wanting her attention one of her affection want me her to care about something more than just eating for day-to-day living day-to-day life day-in day-out trial a trial problem the problem oh he's like he wants something more for us he wants you to know free from jaws of it you don't have to warn her and look anymore I'm here he's here today if we'll notice him sitting in the corner was on washing feet waiting for us to pay attention well let's not invite him I not welcome him today the Bible says in Hebrews the sixth chapter God is not on the righteous you forget your labor your work and labor of love which you've showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister we desired everybody just show the same diligence there's a full assurance of hope until the end that you'd be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises of the musicians the song leader comes forward that's not forgetful of your living you know we're the ones that forget we we think God forgets about it God never forgot something about us hey man we're the ones that forget I wish God would help I wish God would do something I've done everything before you could ever do he's already done it for you he's left it in the field for you you don't even have to grow it listen if you're hungry today it's not because there's no food around a man human boys is filled and you're starving to death it's not because there's not any food around us because you want me nowhere and pick it up hey man what's your busy complaining arguing and being ungrateful and unthankful unless what's right in front of our nose all the while he's just trying to catch our attention oh I want to change our sorrow into bliss all wanting to give us take away that spirit of heaviness and give us a garment a phrase everything laying right there oh whoa well wander from from all kinds of things people in the world
