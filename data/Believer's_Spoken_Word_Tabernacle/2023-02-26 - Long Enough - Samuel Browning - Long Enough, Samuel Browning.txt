like keep claiming that but it's getting better some things takes more time than others but God's already over and he's the same today and I I had this cancer on my nose and this prayer and all it went away it was healed up I don't know if I scratched it or what I'd done but I busted that thing and got it to bleeding again and I it was hard to stop the bleeding I tried this stuff you if you cut yourself with a razor and all and and just stop it but anyway I come up and uh some uh Sunday and brother Samuel prayed with me and and then and you can't see it maybe but it's all gone it's the grace of God it's Mercy to us and he's still the same today his word is just the same as the day he spoke it just as powerful he hasn't lost nothing no matter how dark it gets out there we're walking in the light in the glory of his Gospel of his word and I just love him and I know we all just hold to his promise we just keep holding to his promises and proclaiming them whatever the needs for our loved ones or whatever I just keep just keep looking at his promise and keep praying God bless you come in praise God amen amen I believe the angel of the Lord must been moving through here because I brother Samuel prayed for me in the back my back was bothered me so bad I could barely walk and he prayed for my back and I felt better by the end of service I was just fine I was like oh yeah wait a minute I had a back problem I almost forgot he gets so into the service I forgot I got a problem God healed me I just praise God for that amen God must have been moving amen God's always moving though we trust we trust in the Lord amen I want to sing this song That's the older song is by the same who comes it's called Palms how many heard said Palms of Victory crowns of glory amen there's a song about a man going up the mountain and he gets on the mountain and he's going downhill and he prays Lord he sees that City on the other side I love this I mean it's a good man [Music] I saw the way weather in tattered garments Clan and struggling up the mountain it seemed that he was sad his back was heavy laden his his strength was almost gone but he shouted as he journeyed to deliver us [Music] Victory I shall wait [Music] even the sun was sinking low he'd overcome the mountain and reach the veil below he let Golden City his Everlasting hold and he shouted loud Hosanna Deliver Us will come of Victory Crown of Glory Palms [Music] while gazing on that City just store the narrow flood a band of Holy Angels Came From The Throne of God [Music] and join him in his child for deliverance has come [Music] always [Music] in us we've reached the promised land and when we reach that City our race on Earth we run we'll all share Deliverance has come [Music] hallelujah amen I've

through that way Lord that opened up a way that we oh God could come back into our inheritance as Sons and Daughters of God Lord when that blood cell was open Lord that the life in that blood cell could be released back upon the worshiper Lord and bring us back into the place Lord as a son and daughter of God across the chasm Lord then we might stand there Lord redeemed Lord in your presence o

reality Lord thank you for your mercy Lord oh God how we love you this morning Lord we just invite you Lord as you're here we just ask that you'll just take control and disservice Lord may you say

hearts Lord and I pray that God that every hold and every yoke Lord may it just be broken right now Lord I pray father May every Lord anything Lord that would be hindering Lord we invite you almighty God lord May our faith rise may it be turned loose the Lord into the promises of God and may you just come Lord in a special way Lord hear this morning minister to us Lord speak to our lives Lord to every need Lord we love you and we need you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen isn't it good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen I just as you're turning with me in in the scriptures I'm going to ask you to turn with me to the book of Deuteronomy and uh I'll be there in the first and second chapter there um I just want to make a couple announcements that when I know sometimes on the dismissal we are here and we're worshiping a little later just to make sure if you are leaving just make sure on the dismissal you go ahead and slip on out and don't uh just staying in the aisleways because sometimes people are trying to others trying to get by and then when we get out on going out into the foyer so if you know you want we welcome you to stay into worship but if you are doing that just try to do it inside of the Pew and so that people are able to still exit as they feel to exit and go ahead and go on their way also want to make mention to you uh just kind of been brought to our attention that I know we have like the cough drops and there's been other rappers that we found here and in the sanctuary and we just asked that first of all I we've had some gum chewing going on and gum wrappers and things and I I'll just tell you personally I don't think that's the place chew gum I just tell you I don't think that's a place to chew gum I think that we want we come to the house of God we ought to give everything we've got and respect to his presence and if you need a cough drop that's fine that's maybe a different story but just make sure you you know you're just careful to pick up the wrapper put it in your pocket and then there's a trash can there and I think there's trash cans almost in every room here in the building amen so if you could that would make it a lot easier when they have to come through and and clean it so they don't have to pick that up so is everybody okay with that there's kleenexes too you know we don't want to you know we don't want to touch those kleenexes and things like that so you just put them in your pocket and take them with you and amen and well it's so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning it's just it's good to be here and amen these aren't the things that I enjoy as a pastor but you know it's it's just like a father at home sometimes I got to cover things at home that maybe not made joyous and great Revelation but it's things that need to be done you know there's one thing to call people to dinner when you've got dinner and it's another thing to say pick up your room you know that's not quite the same but we just we thank God Amen that he's given us a place amen a place where we can come together and to worship Him and Liberty and freedom and um so we thank God for that I as you're turning there I I know with the trustees and it probably would be better if they had given it um and they probably would have if I would have just mentioned it or whatever but they have contacted that the Amish crew and it was actually over a month ago for them that are going to do this out out there and you know the brothers got other bids on it but it wasn't the way that it was drawn up and designed that the brothers drew it up and brother Richie actually had drawn that up and um and so you know we don't fault other companies and you know it's just it would be a quite of a different thing to have somebody else to do it and what we had in our mind and so you just keep praying for that those that con that uh Amish crew has has contacted brother Richie and they came out and looked at the the job and things like that and they're going to do it so it should be any day that they would be starting that so you just keep that in prayer will you do that amen because that certainly will be very very nice and I think God Amen for how he's provided for us let's look here in the word and we just see how the Lord will take us here this morning and um maybe if we could let's just start at Deuteronomy 1 and verse one I'm kind of pulled on where to actually to read from but um uh well maybe you know what let's just read from Deuteronomy 2 I I don't want to have you standing that long uh and Deuteronomy sorry Deuteronomy chapter 2 and verse 2. and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward I want to read that verse 2 again but I'm going to read that as personal the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward I'd like to just speak to you this morning on long enough long enough God bless you as you're being seated some weeks ago was I was just walking in here and of course that's where how God will deal with us on inspiration and just praying and the Holy Spirit just dropped this in and just waiting on the moment here to to bring it and I just felt I knew even from last week this was the moment to bring it and we'll just see how far the Lord will let us get in this but I want to take a a look here at this thought on Long enough and there's a lot of things that I think that we can we come to consensus at different times in our life where it there's a declaration it can be in things in the natural and the spiritual where there's a declaration that rises and says long enough long enough now nobody else can say that has to be a declaration that comes in our heart but I want to hear just to open up with where this is at in the book of a Deuteronomy and if you will go to go back to Deuteronomy chapter 1 and here is a is a preparation for the people to go into the land of promise and Deuteronomy 1 and verse 2 it says there are 11 days journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Sayer unto kadish barnian I want you to remember this is how close they were when they came out from Egypt and when they came to Horeb they were only a few days journey to get where they needed to get to so there it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't going to be it wasn't like it was going to be oh this is a long way this is a long before this no it was only a few days but what made the difference between a few days and years was their choices are you hearing me it was their decisions it wasn't God it was their decisions so here it says in verse 3 it came to pass in the 40th year in the 11th month on the first day of the month that Moses spake unto the children of Israel I find it fitting it's the month of February according unto all that the Lord hath given him in commandment unto them after he had slain Zion the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and OG the king of Bashan which dwelt at asteroth in edree on this side Jordan in the land of Moab began Moses to declare this law saying now here what you find is Moses is rehearsing to them what has taken place and the defeating there as it's mentioned in verse 4 of Scion and OG these are two kings that God brings down before Israel is going to go in the land after the generation that rejected the word of God and the will of God and God awaited for them to die off then God notice what he does to build the faith of the people coming into the land he has them to make an approach to two other kings coming to their land God knowing those kings would read reject their entry into that place but God had that in mind because through that King's rejection then it would invite the grace of God to move that where that king would be dismantled and Israel would take possession there it's the same way with all you see when it comes down to this it's God building our faith for what the moment calls for it's not a pep rally God doesn't pep up his people the word of God stimulates us and stirs our heart for the moment building faith for our life is that right for my life for your life personally so notice Moses begins to rehearse God's full desire and one was God's full desire when God sent Moses down to Egypt he said I've come to bring you out of bondage and in to the land flowing with milk and honey that's Redemption so Redemption has two parts to it coming out of and going into and so now notice in verse 6 the Lord Our God spake unto us in Horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain now this is the initial beginning when they came out and here the law is is given at that time and even at that moment God made a declaration when the law was given you've dwelt here long enough in other words it's time to move from here yes amen okay this is back in chapter one now this is where when God is telling us to move he's telling us personally what to move on is that right turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amrise because remember this gospel is personal it's God telling you not God telling you from me but God's telling you God tells me it's personal I walk with God is a personal walk turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto all the places neither unto in the plane in the hills and in the veil and in the South and by the seaside to the land of the Canaanites and unto Lebanon and unto the Great River the river Euphrates and behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them now Moses goes and he rehearses the rejection that's what he's that's what he's rehearsing right now is when they left Horeb yet they came face to face with the promise and they doubted God's ability to keep his word and really what was what they doubted let me just say this when you doubt God's word you're questioning his love are you hearing me because that that's what the reason his word came it's his love God so loved the world is that right God is love and so remember Jesus himself was the very expression of God's heart when the fall came in the beginning and here that Pillar of Fire came down and how brother Ram dramatizes it he came over and he spelled out l-o-v-e when there was no way back yet God stepped in at that time and said I will make a way back for you you know the promise of that seed that's to come so now here they are at Mount seer in verse 1 of Deuteronomy 2 then we turned now this is after the rejection and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me I want you to catch this for a minute I wonder how many times they walked by the Red Sea and they could rehearse yeah we remember this and we remember this and they remember this but they weren't going on with God good it was only rehearsal of testimonies of what God had done but he is the I am sure he's the I was and he is that he shall be but he is the I am and what's important in our experience with God is that it must be the experience of the I am right now in our lives it doesn't matter what you were even last month what are you today all right well I remember you know last year no what are you today are you hearing me now verse two it comes into our text and the Lord spake unto me saying now this is a declaration for this moment for this new generation you have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward in other words it's time it's time to move it's time it's time to start making the same old tracks it's time to go on command thou the people saying you know listen I want you to catch this now verse 4 and I'm going to read verse 4 through verse 7 and I want you to notice the direction that the spirit of the Lord is given them command the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau which dwelt in Seer and they shall be afraid of you take your heed unto yourselves therefore and meddle not with them for I will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breath because I have given mounts here unto Esau for a possession you shall buy meat of them for money you may that you may eat you shall also buy water of them for money that you may drink for the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand for he knoweth thy walking through this Great Wilderness these 40 years the Lord thy God has been with thee and thou has lacked nothing foreign why am I still here you're here because it's long enough it's time to move [Music] that's why God has kept you alive God has kept you you may have went around the same Mountain over and over but now is the moment and God has kept you for this moment it's long enough it's time to go over Glory I want to just say it like this I want to just I'm going to just lay some things that I know I could preach it but I want to just lay some things in here this morning and and I want to say it in this way this message that God sent to us is not just another move this is not another move this is not a well Moody had this and they were all men of God and those were not just movements those were men of God inspired for the moment and the season they were in but this message that God has sent to us I want you to understand when God had seven stars in the right hand there were many other Ministries throughout the Gentile ages but God had a messenger for each age and that messenger would be one that was calling the people back to the Redemptive rights as a son and daughter of God that they could have a real possession in Jesus Christ because Satan has always been there to try to warp it and try to you know water it down but God comes in his power and His glory through every Ministry of those Seven Stars they reflect the same power and Glory from him who is the mighty conqueror are you hearing me those seven stars are in the right hand they are reflecting the light from a seated one one who has set down one who is the Conqueror one who is standing who is sitting there and it is a declaration that I have overcome it all let me tell you this let me just say this clearly but put the devil on notice there's nothing the devil has in this age that's a match to God [Applause] every age when they when the enemy wanted to come in a manner and come against the word God's word was more than a match not just a match not just equal he's more than enough so we can we rest upon this part of it we're not the we God never called us together around this message just to Fellowship around it but get into it all right notice brother Brown says it like this in the token I'm just going to read for a few places in two of the token messages it was not just to get together and talk about it all then all the Jews come together and say I'll tell you what I'll tell you fellas you know I believe that Moses is right because look we see God identifying himself with Moses because we see that Pillar of Fire we know what happens we know all the identifications that God has given Moses it's right you know he said we got to have the blood on the door I believe that but sometimes that word is okay and there's other times it's just laying up for an excuse to follow behind it I'll take it when it says we who were dead in sins and trespass but God who is rich in Mercy I'll take you there anybody else want to come join in with that and say look I don't want to use it when it's leading to an excuse when the word speak into my life because I'm here this morning to receive the word for my own life we got to have the blood on the door I believe that but you know after all I believe I'm just as good as anybody I'm really a covenant Jew I've been circumcised and I pay my offerings and tithes into the congregation why even the priest I ate dinner with him well I'm just as good a man as the rest of you are that isn't what happened we're not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the word to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do so it's a place so the message is not a collection of Doctrine and teaching it is the person of Jesus Christ being revealed when they stood there on the day of Pentecost what was it it was the person of Jesus Christ that same son of man was veiled now in their flesh and it was in effect when they spoke those words it caused conviction to strike the heart and said what must we do to Veil that same presence [Applause] it was the son of man being revealed in his Redemptive work declaring that I am an overcomer so the message is Christ it is the word and we're to get beneath it now the name goes on to say just to believe it is not enough to walk around where it's at isn't enough that's to make yourself worse yeah see not even to be around where it's at it makes yourself worse if notice for he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin borderline Believers Jesus spoke of the same thing now you can remember in the message how can I overcome and I thought of this as I was looking over this quote remember brother Ram talks about when he where he got he had heard another brother preaching on that of overcoming it and then the Holy Spirit began to deal with him and he began to open and hear for this age and bring it down you know bring it break it forth out of Prophecy and and bring it down he talks about how when he was walking across the Stream and he said I was walking across the stream and and there was this log that was going across the stream and he said when I went to go across that log he said what happened to me when I went across it I jumped on that log and a great big chunk of it fell off now I want you to think of this trees need water is that right but it depends if you're positioned in it or not just to lay in it you'll rot are you hearing me now and that's why I'm doing the band would bring it down he said that's the way so many Christians have become they can't take anything it's like a chunk falls off a Chuck falls off a chunk falls off because they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long I say long enough so they can't hold no weight can't hold no pressure but you see the tree itself this is why when brother Brown would say we as Christians real with as being a Christian we are to keep life in us I'm just referring to this place and he said if we're following the message of the hour at least this part of the message We should strive to live constantly in the Life of Christ are you hearing me amen living constantly in his life that's overcoming don't don't just lay around we want to move within that word I just say it like this you see when we read that there in the scriptures for our text we think about that where we are standing that we realize it's not enough just to be around it but we've got to get beneath it amen we've got to get beneath it and I'd just saying like this is there a desire in your heart to press on over the center I know about sister son I ain't talking about sister so and so I'm talking about you God never sent you to look over for somebody else I'm talking about you we don't come to church to shovel it and Pitchfork it on nobody else I'm talking about you I'm talking about me hello somebody is there a desire that moves in our heart to press on Hallelujah because there should be a pulsation that rises in our hearts that says long enough now you can fill that in for whatever it is in your life long enough Hallelujah now notice Matthew 11 12 from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force let me tell you something Satan is no kitty cat that just is walking around like a powder puff he's in a challenge every every word of God he'll challenge every word that you say I believe that he'll challenge it and to see do you really believe it or not are you hearing me now you see this the kingdom of God is not something that is just handed to us but if it really means something to you you're going to have to fight for it come on now it ain't something that's just handed out but it's something you've got to fight for and you're not fighting against God it's fighting against our own will and sometimes our own will like I read in those quotes I'm okay I'm just as good or this is okay and listen I'm not only talking about the New Birth I'm talking also about things sometimes that we have allowed to remain in our life allowed to remain in our families we've went around mountains in Cycles over and over and over again are you hearing me friends or we go around and make up that we cut off then we make it's time to break the Cycles I said it's time to say it's long enough flesh and blood is not your enemy it's the devil and the violent take it by force God said I've given you the lamb but you're gonna have to fight for every inch of it I want you to listen to this this is as I was with Moses you hear me quote this many times over the years when I've ministered but I'm going to read it today as I was with Moses but REM says or how can you try to make all the lutherans see it all the Baptists see it all the Presbyterians nazarenes and Pilgrim Holiness don't condemn them that's all they know that's all that's in them we don't so we're not trying no notice but to you who believe now see this is where the message is addressing to you who believe to you who know to you that's got something in you that's calling to the Deep if all the Deep you've got's been satisfied then stay where you are if you're saddest sad to say where you're at but as for me I'm going on it may not be comfortable for you but I'm going to go on I'll say like this as for me in my house as for me and the church the group of people that God has given me Grace to stand as Pastor we're going to go on Hallelujah not walking around mountains come on Friends [Applause] you know how it is when brother Brandon was walking around that on that day they called it but then said the Indians call it a death march Brother Brad was thinking man I got this figured out I'm a you're a good guy William Branham you're a good guy you can figure it out and brother Brown realized after so long the time he kept seeing that deer hanging in the tree what was it he was walking the same old pathway and getting nowhere but finally when he humbled himself and said God I'm lost oh can we preacher now brother Branham he liked us that not only to a person spiritually lost but right here this morning there might be something that here you are you're setting and your life everything you say I know in my life in whom I have believed but God I need a way out of this I need the clouds to break back and the lifeline but as for me and my house for me there's something more than what he sees so the person who's who's who's just staying content I want to ask you what do you think that looks like I feel like I'm preaching in my heart and bible study in my living room with my young people what does that look like for a person sister Brandon go up to that go go up one that's right there says if all the Deep you've got's been satisfied then stay where you are what's that look like what's it look like when a person a person I ain't satisfied but what does it look like you see we can say things and sometimes we can become so accustomed to saying the right thing and yet we don't really mean it we're just saying what we know is the right thing to say what does that look like to be satisfied it shows in our walk with God I'm satisfied I've got it made amen amen amen help me Jesus Oh Ma I'm glad the word comes to search us out I'm talking about searching you searching me out are you hearing me I don't believe in getting together I don't believe in getting together and say well you know brother so-and-so or sister so and so no sir the word is for us personally [Applause] he's doing the work but for me and my house oh what a declaration for me there's something more than what he sees there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still a deep calling to the deep I cannot be satisfied with theology I cannot be satisfied with a good church I cannot be satisfied with a good campaign I cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling there's a d that's calling out [Applause] I said I do I just Health to be perfect but I'm reaching reaching I'm reaching I'm pressing on anything you got to press again it's because everything is coming against you but you've got to press on I'm talking about the world some of the things we've got to press through as our own will our own feelings our own faults come on somebody it's pressing through that Bram said so here's what you do if they're content with that just let them alone remember what he said about no matter with Edom just let them alone go on through don't argue with them but we're passing to another land they wasn't ordained to go with you they won't walk with you see how can two walk unless they be agreed but to those who love God to those who are called of God well they say well God give us this church God did this that's right God said I give East on this mountain don't touch him I've got something different for you cross over that's my desire Brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side I'm going to tell you that's my desire my desire is not just to see people in church I believe you ought to come to the Church of the house of God and if you've got the love of God in your heart you'll press through to be in his presence it's the word of God forsake not to assemble yourselves together if you got the love of God in your heart you can't wait for those Church doors to open we can go on and on with him but remember there's something greater it's something more there is a land there is something that belongs to you if you're very you're satisfied where you're at it won't matter how much the preaching goes it wouldn't matter what anything does you'll stay right there but there are lies that are Desiring to say Lord I want a deeper walk there's something staring within me there's a pulsation that says long enough [Applause] [Music] oh my mama if there's something in you here first calling notice in you it's calling out it's a signal calling out there'll be something to respond to that call just settling down I want you to watch this just settling down to sheep raising ain't enough for you go into some sort of business is not enough for you just to join the church and put your name on the book not enough for you because there's something calling all across the ridge Yonder across the next Ridge and across Jordan until you fall into the arms of the Living God Yonder gotta home over younger got about Over Yonder hey man I've got a theophany about it that is reserved in the heavens amen I I have a garment that I am Desiring to be clothed upon because this spirit this flesh it is not a fitting Tabernacle for a Son of God but God said it's not your inheritance but I gave it to you for a possession I manifest my glory through your through your human Spirit through the flesh I'll manifest my glory through you and it will be a longing for that other side longing for more of him I want you to catch this just going into sheep raising ain't enough for you you realize that there was two of the tribes that they settled and they didn't go over Jordan there's a few of them tribes that didn't go over right now let me remind you about one of those tribes what happened to him one of them tribes was a tribe of God and remember you're you're well aware when Jesus came on the scene there was a man we know as the maniac of gadera yeah I'm gonna tell you the result of that right there is that when Jesus came and brought Deliverance to that man that that particular group of people did not want a Revival come on friends they didn't want a real Revival I'll tell you what a real Revival is a real Revival ain't just singing a real Revival is real repentance with men and women that are getting rack and being brought back to the path of God's holy word come on now Church hey man it's more it's a word it takes a wire to bring a Revival the spirit of the Living God to move down in lies so settling down just for sheep reason ain't enough you see what you find here is Satan is such a slew foot he'll do anything to try to get your Zeal channeled elsewhere he can get your Zeal you say well the same how can he get my Zeal he can get your Zeal what God's Desiring the prophet said you let so many other things take it out of you what God's wanting to reveal to you God stirs up the heart God's moving your life but you let so many other things and some of the things that he said he wasn't even saying in that quote movies and other things he said you'd let family we got quiet now but something like so many other things take it out of us when God's stirring up the Zeal it's not for anything else but for more of him because how can I really stand correctly for my family if I'm not putting God first I can't do that it must be God first and then God orders everything else settling down just a sheep breezing ain't enough for us amen we want to go forward in the things of God this is why the Bible said if we walk in the light as he's in the light oh I love that we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sins amen amen amen I want to keep walking with him I want this word to keep moving keep working in my life keep changing me from glory and to Glory hallelujah thank God for the job he gave me but God gave me that job and God did not require me hey buddy you keep it open God gave me the job and if the doors closed God's got another place for me somebody you didn't build the factory you didn't build the hospital somebody else built that and the reason was there because God was going to provide for himself he was going to provide for your needs so what is it it's letting God be first and everything else second hello somebody we're made we should be releasing the Zeal in the right place if we don't release it in the right place it'll be around the mountain see there's things that God brings us to in his grace for us to overcome which way should we as the Church of the Living God which way should we always be going somebody say it again forward never backwards never retreat never sideways amen when you read of how the spirit of God moves in the living creatures it's always moving forward see the spirit of God will never take you backwards are you hearing me now well I'm feeling Latin no the spirit of God don't lead somebody backwards the spirit of God to the believer leads us onward always going forward notice in Jesus Christ the same 1955. brother said don't be satisfied with your fire built here from last night let's build it a little further up the road tonight never build it in the same place you can't stand still you're either somebody read this with me you're either backsliding or going forward it's one or the other it can't be both ways at the same time it's either one or the other now Hebrews 6 verse 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit so Paul the burden that Paul is is expressing is the same thing that God has said to that of Israel in that time you've dwelt here long enough it's time to move on now all the all the principles of the doctrine of Christ every one of those things are absolutely necessary repentance all of those things sanctification every single doctrine of Christ baptism laying on of hands all those things are essential but all of that is a beginning for us and calling us and directing us to go on to Perfection and Perfection is where Christ's life is reproduced in US right see it's got to come to a spot to where in our lives when we look at certain things you've got to go beyond repetitive Cycles say brother Samuel what do you mean by repetitive Cycles well you see this is when God encourages us he doesn't condemn us he comes to encourage us it comes to let us know we're living beneath our privileges don't just be content let me bring it down like this don't just be content with continually asking forgiveness for the same old thing are you hearing me now you see God forgives us and the thing of it is you can fill a release you can fill because you know what the lamb he has already bore he paid for the sins past present and future but you see it comes to a spot to where and that's not something that anybody else can make that up for you or for me it has to come to that place to say this is long enough this cycle is stopping it's enough with the cycle going around the mountain the same Mountain because you almost begin to know the same pathway and the same treads and we know everything but it's long enough right Amen brother Brown says it like this and I think I have this quote on here for the sound of the message Paradox and I want you to think about where we are at here in this moment in this hour brother bran speaks of how that the Holy Spirit here had woke him up and you say he talks about it with three o'clock in the morning and he said I had gotten up and I looked where in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan it looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine and I was coming down to the Jordan and it seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to the down to the Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river I looked back and seen which away I had come and I was two-thirds of the way there to the Jordan first pool second pool I was two-thirds of the way to the Jordan right justification sanctification I was two-thirds of the way and I looked across Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in the Promised Land so look in the cross and seeing every promise lays there my inheritance lays there you see it has meaning that is for me now I want you to think but the brand would speak of it like this when the spirit of the Lord would have him to pick up his pen and write and he talked about seeing the promises coming into view here in 1962 in March and he speaks to you and I and he says let us stand like Joshua and Caleb well how did Joshua and Caleb stand they stood on the word of God there was a lot of pressures around them is they weren't they they were outnumbered but they stood on God's word against what all the odds look like they stood on God's word so I'll say to you right now that you know let me just go back because I think of it right now you might look and say well I've had to repent of this and repent of this but remember just sat on your heart right now long enough stand right now long enough it's long enough I'm not this is not going to go on this isn't trying to psych you up it is the authority of God's word by his Spirit just say it's long enough [Applause] because God's not here condemning you because you couldn't even lift your head up he's here to remind you you don't have to keep walking around the same Mountain [Music] come on church I preach unto every one of us even in our own character come on now oh brother Sammy you know my daddy was like this my mama was like this what tree are you of anyhow are you up there you're still bragging on the first birth or have you been grafted and birth into that tree of life come on Friends anybody can make excuses when it's convenient but when it comes down to push and shut will we stand on God's word come on now it's time to draw a line or I've acted like this all my life when something came up I acted like this all my life it's time to say let there be another action come in my life come on now it's convenient to brag on all the whole first birth oh but let us come to that new birth let's brag on the tree of life let's make our boast in the Lord [Applause] I don't discount nobody's story but I want you to understand that your story is not greater than the blood of Jesus Christ [Music] Hallelujah no Sympathy for the Devil are you hearing me you give that guy a little bit it's just like what the Palestinians are doing over there right now you give them a little bit and a little bit a little bit they'll build on top of one another but they're on land that don't belong to him come on now let's look down in our life is there something in our life where there's some Palestinians at that don't belong there oh brother Samuel That Couldn't meal Holy Spirit said give no place to the devil pulling down strong holds long enough you dwelt on the West Bank of my life long enough come on now brother Samuel what do you do well I'll tell you what we're not the devil's punching bag [Applause] it's time to take the the battle to the enemy's Camp it's long enough we've got to go possess the land now look at this God didn't move Israel until it was God's ordained time remember a lot we're moving around with Joshua and Joshua come on her brother Brian dramatizer come on Joshua come on Joshua come on Joshua come on Joshua come on Joshua you used to have thus saith the Lord and but you see Joshua was not moved by the persuasion of others he was one that could recognize and he was standing on the word of God and brother Brown would make this statement here I think it's powerful he says he knew to wait for a clear-cut decision from God for his time and when the time was come Joshua knew it's time it's time he knew this was the moment right here this is time it's it's time to go so when you think of there's a there's a time and a need for a decision there's a need for a decision in this hour and you know when you make a decision because you really can't you you can't stay neutral none of us can stay neutral remember what we just read we're either going forward or we're backsliding there's no holding in the same place we're either getting closer to God or further away is that right yes so now when brother Brandon would make that declaration and he would talk about Caleb and Joshua and it would be a call that there's a need for a man to challenge the promise of God for this hour I want you to think of this I said it's right there in Candace barnia paragraph 125 and I want to read that what we need in this hour is a man to challenge the promise of God before the people I want you to catch this to challenge the promise of God before the people in other words that God would manifest himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever because through that manifestation it'll build faith in the children of God that no matter what the opposition is it will build faith in their hearts to impress on into the new birth it'll build bread it'll build faith in their hearts that there is no opposition no obstacle too great for God because why theology won't do it but a living God making himself manifest in this hour it's God listen when God veiled himself in the life of the Prophet that was God saying I am going to Avail myself in the life of my pride you're letting you and I know this is what your inheritance is is for Christ to dwell in you supremely oh Jesus help us notice God promised the pouring out of the Pentecostal blessing in the last days I mean a real Pentecostal poor house and it's time for it to come another kadish barnia has arrived and they said you know well we we can do it sure sure we can do it but you see those cowardly church members was looking to what they could see with their eyes I tell you your eyes will always lie to you and they'll always lie to us but Caleb and Joshua was looking to God's promise you know what you go to looking at will affect how you act I don't care how much opposition they had how big the giants look how big the fences look they were looking to God's promise now I want you to watch how Paul says this in Galatians 4 19. and just stay with me here just a few moments my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you now think of that of travailing leads in you think of birth pains that come along you know the preaching of the word when the word is being preached it's what brings conviction to The Sinner now to the heart that don't want to get right it's for its condemnation but for the heart I'm going to respond to it it's conviction it's a way out this is my way out are you hearing me oh my you see we're living in an age of don't judge me don't judge me listen the word the word right here is coming forth and we need the word to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart that word discern means judge are you hearing me it's the holy spirit that brings conviction amen so notice of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you so Paul here he is laboring with the people of God and where they're at in their walk with God and to notice that you know when there is um you know sometimes they'll do things to induce labor they'll you know put that little drip in there and it it begins to start the contractions and starts it moving on down and trying to you know bring bring it to that place of of a birth and let me tell you something the Holy Spirit comes and it streams of Grace that's moving down that's why the real grace of God it comes to bring conviction in our life it deals with the person that says wow this is wrong this is not right what is it it's streams of God's grace to deal with our life that's what real Grace is Grace isn't leaving us in the same condition but that grace of God is at streams of Grace it flows down until Christ himself God's Grace has been fully reproduced in our life in other words it becomes Grace for Grace the grace that God gives to us in Repentance we receive that and we walk on and Grace is given for sanctification we walk on Grace is given for the baptism of the Holy Ghost Grace for Grace so it's an inter continual unfolding of Grace let me just say it like this that Grace as it's flowing what it does it brings a travail in Zion and when Zion travaileth the Bible said in Isaiah 66 verse 8 in the last part of that scripture for as soon as Zion travaileth she brought forth her children you see the streams of Grace it's there to bring what a travailing amen God dealing with the light here's a need for a birth there's a need to go on there's a need for a real experience what is it the spirit of God is bringing travail that's why in the services listen even as the Church of the Living God you have lives that have already crossed over dwelling in the land and have a desire and are feeding of that inheritance and notice the same spirit of God is moving through the body to do what travail this holy spirit is not coming to strip you down he's coming to do what bring travail to bring us to a place of dying to ourselves because by not making a decision you're making a decision God said in Isaiah 66 9 the first part of that one shall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth you see the thing we just have to speak plainly we can't Dodge the new birth there's not another way into the inheritance there's not another way to Victory it's going to come through the new birth and it's a mess are you hearing me when God starts dealing with the light there's things there's decisions you have to start making right some of you know what I'm talking about there's decisions you've got to start making there's things the Holy Spirit starts dealing with your life I'm letting this go I'm forsaking this who is speaking to you to do that and equipping you it's the Holy Spirit and what is it it's dying out it may not happen all at once like this are you hearing me but it's a dying out sometimes I say it in this manner like this if I can just elaborate on this the experience itself is not a timeline it's you surrendering and God taking over are you hearing me because sometimes we can look at things and remember here's the thing that's always the same The Experience itself as far as passing from Death unto life is the same experience but sometimes the timeline and it has nothing with God dealing with God holding anything back it's just God working personally with lives but Samuel what are you saying I'm saying this to you do what he tells you to do and don't ever build your fire on the same place you built it the night before keep moving on with God don't look back don't walk around the same Mountain if you build a fire here keep on moving for the next time and press Holland and look if there's something that's in your life right now ask God Lord take that out of my life that's called dying out take it out of my life Lord because I don't want to keep walking around this mountain I want to go on Hallelujah remember brother random likened it to a little white button a little white button as it comes in he likened the spirit of God coming into a life right but notice he comes in and he grows brother Brian says the more he has you can push out all the malice all the hatred all of this right here what's he doing he's growing into sanctification what is it it's until Christ be formed in you he's growing he's moving he's pushing forth in your life that's why the Holy Spirit when he deals with our life it's God calling to our hearts it's God beckoning to our life I'm just going to speak some things here we just had a wonderful youth meeting there on Friday evening and some of the testimonies and things are being shared sometimes you have things where there's one individual saying you know it went to a youth meeting and made a determination I'm going to let go of all this right here and then here it was back again and then went again back again when again then the things come back again but finally and this is what they said when they got desperate to be free when they got desperate to be free because we can say I surrender you see some of that sometimes those terms seem so vague to somebody who hasn't never come to that place it seems so vague because it's like this right here then you know if I'm going to give you my phone and I'm handing it to Paul say here Paul take it come on take it take it take it take it we're in a tug of war I'm not really surrendering are you hearing me thank you I better keep this or we'll never go to lunch it's where we get for to be free it's got to be desperation you see if we can be content with and we can look at things in our life and we become content well everything's all right here and I'm okay here we'll keep going around the same Mountain but there is something that arises up within us it says long enough [Music] long enough there's power let me tell you this morning there's power in a decision are you hearing me there's power in a decision every one of us has the ability to make a decision here this morning let me let me read this in closing we're just going to stop here but the brand says tonight the Branham Tabernacle has got to make up its mind we're either going to go on or go back we're either going they're going to go we'll go back to garlic and leak and stuff of Egypt or you're going on to Angel's food to the promised land where God made a promise we're going on to an Old-Fashioned Holy Ghost Revival or you'll be wishing while she packing around and pecking like a robin on an Apple until the day you die I don't know about you but I don't want to be wishy-washy I don't want to be that you've got to make your decision you can't go on why haunt you between two opinions said Elijah God be God serve him if he's not God then don't serve him now notice what he brings in here but the brand goes in and he says the real experience of God is what takes the sin out of a man's heart not belonging to a church or belonging to a clan or belonging to an organization goes on talk about how education we'll never do it he says there's only one Savior for the world and that's the blood of Jesus Christ who has freely poured out at Calvary for the remission of every sin that a man ever committed he was wounded for our transgressions Bruce for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his strats we were healed I challenge any man or woman in the name of Jesus Christ to take God at his promise tonight and see if it's right or wrong now watch where he goes into I've seen the dead raised when the doctors walked away and pronounced him dead the guy Witnesses right here some right here that God has raised from the dead [Music] you just had a testimony here this morning that wasn't years ago this was just wasn't last week brother Dave I completely forgot about it he came in my office and told me about it this morning the cancer that was on his nose gone now you tell me who did that right there's no one no man could do that ain't no man's hands that are special it's almighty God that's in our midst and if the same God could take a cancer off a nose what about a cancer in your soul what about a cancer in your spirit what about a cancer in your mind he's still God you say a cancer a cancer is trying to take the life out of you Hallelujah there's something here's greater than spiritual chemo there's the blood of Jesus Christ that Passage and if you'll side with the word of God if you'll make that decision and say that's what I want I want that living reality there's a God who is present Who removed cancer who heals arms who raises the Dead Hallelujah who heals of lupus and going and on there's a God right here this morning that can meet your need when you're ready to say long enough long enough when the doctors have walked away and said nope through let me tell you something you're not a lost cause let me repeat that you're not a lost cause you don't know how many times I've failed you're not a lost cause renounce that enemy that's telling you that it's a life spirit that would want to keep you bound but Liberty is here this morning you're a son and daughter of God you may not know it in reality this morning but there's a voice that's taken a hold of you as the shepherd speaking to his sheep and saying it's long enough maybe you've lived underneath traditions and mind battles and the enemy telling you're not good enough right now this morning it's long enough you don't have to listen to him one more moment long enough I've seen the blind maid see I've seen total blind for years and years seen the death the blind the halt the lane to leap and jump and praise the Lord I've seen prostitutes come off the street and make ladies I've seen drunkards come off the gambling halls and the place of devices of this world and make gentlemen and Saints I challenge any man to produce anything else that'll do it I've seen a man who took Alcoholics Anonymous and tried to be made well took shots in everything and all the psychology in the world and the best doctors of the world could be gotten to give them treatment and fail and I've seen that same man Pardon Me I'm having a moment here because I'm reading about me I've seen that same man picked up by the blood of Jesus Christ and made a saint of God and a preacher of the Gospel Hallelujah I'm a product you're a product of what this word produces and I say this morning it's time to say long enough long enough long enough it's long enough strong enough let's pray Heavenly Father Lord I've spoke what you've laid on my heart just to be obedient Lord to this moment Lord and Lord God is a group of people as a Lord not only as a group but Lord even individually Lord God let the Declaration arise in hearts it's long enough long enough of living defeated long enough of living beneath our privileges long enough Lord Of A Life That's went around encycles the Lord of that same Mountain Lord oh God but right here this morning it's you that's calling us Lord to turn northward Lord you're calling lives to turn northward Lord father you're speaking to each and every one of us no matter where we are at Lord in the economy of God Lord you're calling to our hearts Lord that Lord the same fires we cannot build upon the same places where we have built Lord oh sometimes that's comfortable ground Lord we've already built a fire there but Lord how Lord God you call us to move on Lord I pray God right here this morning Lord May there be a determination Lord a decision that would arise within hearts Lord a repentance that would
