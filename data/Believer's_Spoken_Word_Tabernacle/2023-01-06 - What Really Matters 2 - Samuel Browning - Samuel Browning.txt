only Amazing Grace how God would take a hold of our lives and draw us to him but it's amazing to see his working in our lives right now to see what God is doing and to think of just the the littleness that how God would speak and God would call God would deal with our lives but God seen something and he knew something laid deeper than what you or I could see amen and you know what that brings about just the trustee I trust what he sees amen and just give myself to it it's so good to be in the house of the Lord this evening and we just want to turn our hearts Amen to the word of the Lord and so good to be gathered with you amen and appreciate the musicians and for them here in this moment I'm gonna as you maybe the musicians as they're making their way off let me just read to you a quote just just some weeks ago and it really pertains to what we're dealing with but but Brown here's just a testimony says you know he says I've been through depression I've been through Prosperity I've seen it all together but I wouldn't turn loose the hand of Jesus Christ for all the money and the wealth that you could pile on the face of the Earth and everything else I like this he's my friend when I'm broke he's my friend when I got plenty I love him when I'm hungry I love him when I'm filled I love him when I'm in sorrow I love him when I'm happy I love him because I love him because he first loved me oh he says when I was sick laying dying he was my friend when I'm feeling good tonight and happy you're still my friend when I'm laying Yonder dying somewhere and my chilly veins come up my arms like that he will be my friend then and when these brittle threads that I'm walking on breaks and I plunge out into eternity he will be my friend then when the Angels ages rolls on after ten thousand years and you've sung your Jubilee songs he will still be my friend then yes sir when there's no more moon no more sun no more Earth he will still be my friend then as the ages roll on oh how we ought to love him what a friend we have in Jesus you talking about one who sticks with us through thick and thin oh I'll tell you what he's a friend that sticker closer than a brother you know when you look at that scripture in the in the word of God in the Book of Proverbs if the Bible would say he that showeth himself friendly hath many friends and if you really get to looking at the context of that scripture that scripture is speaking of the Proverbs he that really compromises in order to gain others that's what it's really saying but then that's where this scripture comes in there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother in other words there's a friend that you don't have to compromise on nothing man just be yourself just submit yourself to him there's one that'll stick with you through thick and thin amen aren't you glad for that no friend like the lonely Jesus no not one no not one amen don't you love him amen oh my it's so good to serve the Lord amen let's look in the word of God tonight in Job chapter 21. amen so good as I said to be here with you amen just trusting the Lord just to come by our way I I believe he's here amen just to come and speak to our our hearts tonight God knows what our he knows what our needs are and we just want to reach out and touch him and you know you I just say it like this you might even as you sat and we're listening to the word of God let's be like blind Bartimaeus Lord I know you're passing this way it might seem like that yeah it doesn't seem like he's turning my way but if we just call out to him Jesus we don't know him the son of David we know him as the son of man the same Living God May flesh have mercy on me and then when the enemy could say I don't make no difference he doesn't hear and blind Bartimaeus cried out the more the louder have mercy on me amen let's just bow our heads before we begin reading Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we believe and know Lord in our hearts that you are a faithful and merciful high priest Lord you know the needs Lord and you know every heart Lord that would be gathered together here Lord Lord in presence Lord of one another those Lord by way of internet and those that will Lord go back to Archive it later you know the needs of every one of your children Lord and we're depending on you tonight that Lord you would come I I know Lord the desire of My Heart Lord is that God you would grant me the Lord just to be able to step aside Lord God and and get out of the way that Lord that you can just move down and and speak so personally Lord God to our hearts Lord we just want to give ourselves unreservedly Lord in these few moments Lord to you that you would just come Among Us the Lord and minister to our hearts Lord father that other word is coming forth that diseases will be put to flight Lord father spirits of Oppression will be put to flight oh god father where Hearts will be encouraged Lord as the angels of God have taken their position o God and Father for this meeting Lord that you knew Lord before the foundation of the world and how that you would come Lord and minister to our hearts now Lord we Look to You Lord as little eaglets oh god with our beaks Open Lord God and asking Lord that as David could say in the word he feedeth my mouth with good things Lord we're asking that you would come by our way tonight Lord and you would speak to our hearts Lord God you administer the Lord to us strength o God that only you can Lord minister to us Lord we just invite you o God that you would move Lord in a very special way Lord tonight we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen Amen in Job chapter 21 verse 1 I'll just read a few verses of scripture and we'll let you be seated but job answered and said hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations or your comforts suffer me that I may speak and after that I'm I have spoken mock on as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled Mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth even when I remember I am afraid and trembling takes hold on my flesh amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated you know when we look at this in the scripture job being a prophet of God and remember when God speaks about job he doesn't when he is testifying concerning that life that's on display in job he never speaks of he's my prophet but he says he's a perfect and an upright man he was a prophet indeed but that was a channel that God would work through but what God was bragging upon he's a perfect and upright man now wasn't job's flesh but it was that part of God's own life that part that was within job that had been displayed all through times that's what God had confidence in the Bible says when we think of this heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away God knows like it says in the Book of Psalms that we are he is mindful that we are but flesh he also knows as it says in the First Corinthians chapter 10 that God is faithful I love how that verse starts God is faithful that he will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able to be tempted I'm sure with every one of us we would have tried to and we've tried to sign out we've looked for exit doors and everything but see God knows what you and I not only are able to endure but God is also permitting all those things to work out lez Paul would Express later in that same chapter an eternal weight and a molding of our character it's things that many times that we are is beyond our mind and our understanding but yet we unders we look at it and know that God what God has confidence in is that substance of his own life and his self because our flesh still declares its flesh in the midst of a trial there's times We complain there's times we wonder right there's times we get down our flesh what does it do it still declares that this flesh is not the glorified body amen so with and we we don't look at that to make an excuse but we realize that what God has confidence in is that part of himself on the inside and job job what he's expressing here we know that there's been answers that's been given throughout all of the tests and all the trials that have been uh that or the tests and trials that's come but what job has witnessed all through his life he has an understanding from God and he's also witnessed that the wicked man can actually appear to be blessed and as far as temporal goods and material things of this life in many cases can supersede and it looks to be they're very blessed within those things and though when we look at that we we think about how the Lord Jesus here when God himself would come down in Redemption and create their his own Tabernacle to come and dwell in he never came into the rich palaces or the richness of this Earth but as a matter of fact he did not even have a house to call his own he didn't even have a pillow to lay his head on but he he who was rich became poor and God came even when we look at within that manner and it would be expressed to you and I the admonition that we would see that though a person could take their life and they could use their life to gain the world but yet when they would take their own life and do that they actually lose it and this is why the Lord Jesus very sombering words he would say but who's willing to lose or surrender his life shall find it quite quite a contrast because from the beginning this world system not earth the system that is upon it the world the cosmos all that is born or comes forth from that of where of Temptation to be asked God to to know as God knows and to come into a place of bullying and moving where Pride becomes the basis of everything what a place of reflection and I want to just continue with that thought here tonight on job 21 in the midst of of the trial and to think about this thought once again what really matters I think that I think though that's a question that when everything that we do and everything we set our Our Lives to what really matters what is it that at the end of the day what really matters brother Branham takes an example here when he looks at and you'll hear him all through the message as he compares the poor couple that he married with the rich couple that he married right and he Compares those he Compares that and brother bran talks about when he went to where that poor couple was here they were he come up on the boxcar and how then it looked and everything it would not have been a place that where royalty or king would have felt welcome but when brother Brandon got next to it he heard the conversation he heard the care the love being expressed inside of that home and then he compared that to what he had heard up there on the Hill from the rich people and you know just uh I think it was maybe a year and a half ago two years ago we were privileged and I I guess I would say it put a visual to the context of what brother Branham described there when the brothers took us by in that way and would point out to who of of the rich people and what it was speaking of and and when you think of it they had everything gold-plated uh you know the the the works the Saints everything that could have been a claimed to that would have that would uh seemingly have appeased them and yet here they were in opposite corners of the house fighting with one another jealous of one another and brother Brandon says he asked himself the question Bill if you had to go to a home what home would you feel welcome in what home would you want to be in see it's it comes down to as brother Branham brings it he says it like this he says but if it's to me he says I'd say let me have a real true wife one that loves me let me live down here in a boxcar because I tell you happiness and contentment money cannot buy it money cannot buy love I mean we see money can't buy peace I mean we've seen that just look the world over money does not buy peace the Bible says as money cannot buy love or happiness and contentment it cannot buy that's the real things so the real things happen I'm thankful to God for that the real things what really matters what really matters think about that in everything that we we look at you see when we're looking at these these friends of job who came remember as we were looking at that last week their focus and their judgment everything that they were basing upon whether or not job was um was a was a righteous man or was in good standing with God everything had to deal with temporal things around him because you know what that was their experience their experience was based on just the temporal things but job when we read through job job's not not focused on the temporal things of Life what's job's the thing that job is Desiring his I'm used to having communion with him I'm used to talking with him there's a channel that he'll speak to me I need to talk to him job was focused then as job had always been on fellowship with God that's what job was focused on they were looking at the temporal job looked at it and said that's not what I'm focused on I'm focused on the fellowship that I have with him that's where I'm troubled this is why job could say in verse 7 wherefore do the wicked live and become old yea and are Mighty in power now this is contrasting remember what has been just said in the previous chapter and I we we came we came up to a certain point here last week and it's contrasting because what has been said in the previous chapter and what has been mentioned just in bits and pieces throughout is that will the wicked is cut off and and they who you know they they go against God or they've sinned it's just wiped right out and job has stood over and over but now in a whole chapter he stands there and totally he's dismantling the arguments that are there by what not by what he said not just by his understanding but he's pointing things out to him I can't help but Wonder in the beginning of this chapter I can't help but wonder when job said let this be your consolations you know Brother Carlos I wonder if he's going to let him know when I'm getting ready to say might shake you in your boots but don't worry don't get all you know you're focused on your temporal Goods but don't say oh my goodness these temporal Goods could be taken oh no but then let me just comfort you because comfort those things can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on but I'll tell you job goes on to mention and in this way their seed is established in their sight with them in their offspring before their eyes their houses are safe from Fear neither is the rod of God upon them now what a contrast notice verse 10. their Bull gendereth and faileth not their cow catheth and casteth not her calf now remember all these things that's going through job's lost all of it jobs lost these things but job's able to point it out that on the contrary what you're saying is oh everything's taken and their children are taking off job said no in the country with a wicked he said minute their seed continues to prosper and prosper and prosper and prosper going on being established established established and even their livestock's going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ and they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the Grave I want you to look at this statement in job 14. therefore they say unto God now think about where they're spending spending their life in wealth let me just say this brother Bram said there's as many Penny ears as there is millionaires because a pennier is one who's wanting and wanting and wanting and wanting and get to chasing after Chasing After there's nothing wrong let me just bring the balance here there's nothing wrong with goals you'll find the scripture admonishing you should have goals when I sit down I've got three young men when I sit down with them there's things that we've talked open throughout the years and continue to revisit goals there ought to be goals and ambition right contract that's a real contrast to this age that's not something that I know is going to be just osmosis going to take place with them it's got It's it's a continual it's a reminder it's not a preaching to them but it's working with them that's part of that cultivating there's got to be goals there's got to be expectations things that you pray over and asking God for direction but let God lead you and never allow your goals to be above his will allow his will to be first and then allow that to affect and influence and direct alter change bring to pass everything concerning those goals because the Bible said acknowledge the Lord in all thy paths in all thy ways and he'll direct that path that's the promise right so the scripture in only the scripture is always in the admonishing to our lives and able to bring it down to where we as we walk within in this life but yet we understand as I said Remember the Brandon makes a statement about Penny ears it's talking about where brother Brahm says within it he said if money itself he says is not the thing that's bad it's our attitude towards it it's our attitude towards I mean the Bible says the Love of Money not money but the love of it is the root it's the root of all evil right it's always the chasing after the next best thing and everything the world itself is set up under that principle oh you got the newest model guess what there's another model coming out there's only you your key fob only has two buttons this has four buttons why is it everything everything of the world is to promote curiosity is also to promote lust come on I'm not just talking about man and woman I'm talking about things remember when we look at lust it's desires that are forbidden to where that we the Bible said that the world passeth away and the lust thereof I think if there's anything at all that we look at it and say Lord If It Be Your Will If It Be Your Will Lord If It Be Your Will so notice what they say in verse 14. therefore they say unto God depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways this is what the wicked says we don't want to know your ways we don't care about your ways we don't care about it now those things are said not just by words but also by their actions they don't care they don't care now notice verse 15 this is also this is what's coming from the wicked what is the almighty that we should serve him what profit should we have if we pray unto him not quite the contrary the wicked will say what good does it do to follow God what do I need to follow him I've got everything that I have need of I don't need him I don't need that I don't you know what this is just a little bit too tight you don't need you don't need all this to serve God you don't need all of this that's a little bit too straight that's the spirit that has been and is yet still I am rich and increased with goods and I have need of nothing I've got my understanding I don't need the Holy Ghost I know God I don't need all of this I don't need God doesn't care about this God doesn't care about this that's what the Declaration is they don't want to know his ways you know what his ways are it's his life it's his character and it is life Hallelujah but that's because what has been presented in this age is a loving Jesus in a figment of one's imagination and they've got a Jesus that's crafted and has been crafted by schools of theology it's a Jesus that does not require a change of Jesus that does not require lining up with the word well that ain't my Jesus because my Jesus is the word amen and everything the spirit of truth will line with every part of the word that's my Jesus my Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never fail what a contrast to this age because it's an age the spirit itself that is there that I don't have need of nothing where it can even as job is saying the wicked can look I you know I know of individuals said and talked with them and you hear you hear the things the way they talk they're stuck and look they've been I'm not even going to go into the specifics but there are things where they've been successful in life I mean really successful I've got Kinfolk been very successful in life been hyped and they're they're proud of that which working hard I'm proud of that too I think I think that's ought to be something that merited but when it all comes down to the end of the day where is your soul going to be with God because it don't matter how good you've been well I care for my children I've done that that's all good but when it comes down to the end of the day what about your soul every man has to give an account for his own soul you see what Paul you know what job's trying to do think of job in the midst of this trial accusations and this is God's mercy not only is it repelling those accusations but if these men can really take heed to it and say you know what I need to live a deeper life than a superficial relationship that's based on temporal things if they can really take it the right way but you know how it is number one our flesh don't like hearing rough things but thanks be to God there's got to be something deeper there that says it's tearing me up but keep bringing it down because what's tearing me up it's loosening me from what's trying to bind me keep bringing it keep cutting away because what is it doing it's not cutting away at Moses Michelangelo never cut away any part of Moses he only removed what wasn't Moses oh my this is why Lo their good is not in their hand and the counts of the wicked it's far from me Joe's letting them know in jobs let me know in verse 16 no I I don't understand why that is but that's that's how things are Joe node that he hadn't sinned how many you know I could ask for a raise of hands as you listen to the message how many times you hear that statement over and over I don't care what message you let's do job no he hadn't sinned but it becomes what it is if something becomes so real it was ground that job was standing on the devil couldn't move him he couldn't move no matter what accusations job knew I heard God's voice I've done everything that God has asked me to do what you are charging me of is not right he knew he hadn't sinned it's a stand he met God's requirement now brother Brown said now accidents and troubles that don't happen to people because they're sinners because I've seen Sinners prosper and go on it's on the basis of Fellowship because a man prospers in business that'll make him all together a Christian because there's many Sinners that prosper but what is it our fellowship is not upon the basis of how much God prospers us but on the basis of coming under the shed blood and fellowship with one another that's the real part of Christianity that's what makes these meetings he said so real and special is when people can come under the basis of the shed blood we have things in common and we set in Heavenly places you know the Bible says in Proverbs 28 6 better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness then he that is perverse or wrong in his ways though he be rich you know a rich man might be able to buy himself out of a lot of things but he can't buy himself out of when that fog of death starts moving up he can't buy himself out of that no matter how much money he's got he cannot he can't buy himself into the kingdom of God well he's donated to the poor remember religion that's religion salvation is a birth no matter how many fruit baskets and how many things brother Brandon made it so clear that's religion salvation come to do with the real deal with the real root of the problem aren't you glad for that I'm glad for that we don't have to walk with a covering in our life but there can be a real transformation we can walk in confidence so notice the rich in Proverbs 20 and 11 the rich is wise in his own conceit but the poor that half understanding searcheth him out aren't you grateful for a word it's a living word that searches us out amen we're not rich and this world's good but but we have we have a treasure that searches us out we have a treasure that is is it is real to us this is the riches of his glory Christ in US it convicts us it directs us it leads us it ministers up that's what real riches are the poor have an understanding that searches him out Proverbs 13 7 there is he that maketh himself rich yet half of nothing there is he that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches amen and I love this Matthew 5 3 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven that's what the whole the whole mystery of think when Jesus came among the Pharisees they were not poor in spirit they did not want to surrender or submit themselves to the word of God but they argued against it but here all through the track record where people whose lives would have been wrote off reject a mess unfixable unrepairable damaged goods Hallelujah but Jesus could look down beneath all of that it was he was coming to redeem what lay down beneath air into his presence what everybody else had said rejected damaged goods Beyond repair Jesus could come right down to that and he'll raise up a life that is a trophy of his grace Hallelujah that's what real riches does in our life blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven think of Dwight Moody walking there on the sidewalk and here came a man it was a you know one to be a smart alec about the white Moody you know Dwight Moody couldn't talk right he stuttered and everything else and even how they made fun of him coming and writing in the meetings and saying I don't see who in the world would go to see him he can't even talk right and everything else and the white mood he looked at it God help us to be that way he looked at it and laughed he said of course not they come to see Jesus God help us because we might get on Facebook and start blasting them but they didn't come to see the one Moody they came to see Jesus and remember a smart alec coming down the road the rolling you know and Dwight Moody's walking they're walking like this and the man the mind when he said excuse me he says I don't move for a fool the white Moody tipped this out and said I always do excuse me and he walked home [Applause] what is it the porn spirit is that which is humble to the word humble ourselves in his presence that's real riches because prosperity it's not always the sign that God is with us it's many times that's deceiving because the Bible said the rain will fall on the just and the unjust Brethren would talk into the Christian businessman and you you hear this on various accounts and different messages and they got up they were on an island and you know brother Brandon was there at the meeting you know brother Brandon was there and and they got up and these businessmen they started you know testifying in the things that they were saying is I started off I had a little little itty-bitty place down there but I tell you it was it was my business nothing was good I had a horrible time but the first thing you know I received Christ and I got everything now another banham looked at that he waited till they got back to the hotel and he brought some correction because Prosperity don't mean Christ he told them he said you're trying to compare with wealthy men that's got more than you and you're going to tell them come to Christ you can have more that's not why you serve Jesus Christ it's not because I can have more of this Earth I don't want more of this Earth because this Earth has only brought me sorrow I want more of Jesus that's what I want I want more of him not more of this because you know how it is the more you have the more you got to worry about the more you got to take care of right sometimes that's why maybe we wonder and say maybe a tent would be best right I mean we find out as you get you know you get into a home you you think about a home and then you realize you're going to do homeless repairs it's part of life right true got that repair done good you're just in time for another one that's how it is right so when we look at this the uh of the prospering that's why over and over brother Brown would point out Prosperity is no sign of spiritual blessing people think a lot of times Prosperity God is smelling it's smiling down on us oh and we got you know bigger churches and God's not against a bigger building that's not what brother Brown was talking about he said God it ain't against those things but it's what they're putting stock in it's when things are put stuck in well I gotta you know I got a big house or I got a I got a this car I got this and boy I know God really loves me that's not how we judge Our Lives because remember the king of glory had no house had no place to lay his head he was an outcast despised and rejected he was not in the who's who he was not welcome in their clubs he was despised even when Simon invited him into his house Simon didn't even wash his feet didn't even anoint him with oil but set him down in the corner [Applause] he was poor but he became poor but I might become rich in him in his life or repeated God in the highest thank you Jesus Oh My think of how that even when that pressure came because you know when we look at that of prosperity and they were trying to even Prosper you know press on Micah that whole thing you know in the days that they have well they weren't having Wars and this and man everything seemed to be good and boy God's just smiling on us everything's real good but they weren't judging Nothing by the word let me tell you that's the danger because our life as a Believer I want to know where I stand with God heaven was going to come to hear the word of God it's not that I have a question but I want to know I want to be closer to him I'm depending on that Living Word that flaming sword I'm depending on the word to reveal and to direct to lead questions of God I'm depending on God to answer those questions I'm depending on leadership that I need in my life I want to know what does he say about it I need that that to me is worth more than anything else and my canoe my canoe said real Prosperity is if you believe His prophets you'll prosper Micah knew that I'm going to stay with what Elijah said and that's why brother random going on he would speak of how people think maybe you have to own a lot of worldly goods and that'll show that God is blessing you that ain't true sometimes it's the other way the man brings it on down about the baptism of the Holy Ghost because as it comes down even to that we're looking at the baptism of the Holy Ghost and one clear identity it over and over in the scripture is when the spirit in US identifies every word of God to be the truth if the spirit that we have comes out against the word of God and says that ain't necessary that ain't needful it's not the true baptism of the Holy Ghost because the true baptism of the Holy Ghost brings forth a son or daughter of God that lives under the headship of Jesus Christ the word and is united with him as a husband and wife are one these are no longer Twain They Are One Hallelujah and that's why when we look at it look at Balaam Balaam was tested remember bear Balaam first went when they came to him he said let me go talk to God about this I'm gonna go talk to the Lord the Lord told him don't go with these men and these people they're wanting you to come against they're blessed don't you touch them so Bala went out and told him then you know here they come again well houses land gold and everything else and Balaam said oh that would be given to me yet I will not go and you know in Disobedience to the word of God that sounds good if it is stopped right there but Balaam because the desire in his heart that's why we always got to make sure what the desires of our heart are because whatever the desire is he can lay there for years but if it never gets taken care of it'll come out are you hearing me this is why we always want the desires of our heart to be remedied God let every desire be lined up with you Lord Balaam went and asked God lord what would you say God don't change his mind God don't change his mind God didn't say you know what I think something's changed different now you know I feel a little different about that now God went ahead and told him go ahead and go now after God told him that you can read in the scripture after God told him that you could ask baalem hey what did God say God told me to go ahead and go the very next scripture God sees Balaam God and the Bible said God was angered that he went why he should have known what God has said first he means and he won't change it oh what a blessing that is isn't it if God ever healed anybody he still healed people if God ever delivered he still delivers if God ever filled with the Holy Ghost he still feels with the Holy Ghost that don't change no matter time no matter what happens he's still the same God amen he prospered notice how Balaam prospered but remember this is why brother Brandon would draw our attention to it you can't judge God by Prosperity because the world prospered and Balaam was blessed argue against Balaam Balaam you're out of the will of God no way I'm blessed what God told you in his word not to go yeah but look God turned around and told me to go well this is like when brother Branham had the woman preacher on the prayer line and you know the prayer that when the woman preacher said well brother Brian you know she said God called her to preach brother Brown says I don't doubt that he did that's a good one isn't it right after he preaches rising of the Sun he said what it is he says God don't change his mind about his word because he won't take what God Said in his word and to keep going after it and finally God says go ahead and do what's in your heart because you're going to do it anyhow right right oh I want my heart cleared out I want my heart cleared out I want my heart to match his word if there's something in my heart that's not lined up Lord I'm looking to you that my heart would be lined up with your work I don't want your work to match my experience I want my experience to match your word so that I have a real word experience oh glory be to God think of it how the scripture let me just in speaking of this of of being prosperous remember how the scripture says in third John chapter 1 verse two very familiar scripture to us beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth now no doubt many of you have seen this and it's been passed along it's it's generally every year it's a quote that I get from some way or another from from ministers overseas Brethren and so forth here we all and this is what brother Brown says at the end of Revelation chapter four it's still good no matter how many times you read it he says I wish each of you the most successful and blessful and healthy New Year that I can wish to you God be with you may you grow both physically and spiritually and financially and materially everything that God can bring upon you I pray that he'll do it but I don't know about you but there's one that stands out in there more to me than all the rest of them one that I'm interested in spiritually that's what I'm interested in because he promised he'd provide for all my needs any Witnesses has he done that he promised he would do that I he told me I don't even have to worry about that that's what he told Israel when they were going in the land you don't even have to be occupied with that and Jesus telling the New Testament Church that was going to enter into the land of the Holy Ghost he told him the same thing take no for tomorrow sufficient is the evil thereof don't get all worried about the clothing this and that and this and that he want telling them not to plan but he was sad don't make that your focus I'm your focus I'm your all in all I've got everything covered I'm the same God who didn't allow their sandals to wear out for 40 years I didn't allow their their clothes to become threadbare I'm the same God this is where it comes down to the spiritual mind something rises in the spirit within our lives you can always see the the contrast you know Jacob he saw Abel came Jesus Judas you don't see the contrast I believe with all my heart that the prosperity when we look at the scripture and you take that there were even Kings that's mentioned in the days of Israel that when Zechariah was prophesying amazing I don't know if I'm pronouncing it correctly but the Bible said God spoke to him he prospered as long as he obeyed the word of God you know God told Israel when you come into the land you'll prosper long as you walk in my word that's still a condition we might look and say we're under an unconditional Covenant but what if God allowed you and I just to keep going our own way something's wrong something's wrong because the Bible said if we don't judge ourselves he judges us God God will move in our life and what is he doing God will say hey come on now I dealt with you on these things and you're just kind of passing them by passing them bypass but I mean it I'm not going to lose a one I want you to take notice of these things because God's desire is to work and move and live and flow through our lives we're a branch so I believe within my all my heart but I believe in prosperity but I believe as a believer in my heart this is where I'm set on is spiritual prosperity amen I want to see an advancement of the kingdom of God that's I look at it even in this year how fitting God places in my heart at this time that's what I want to see I want to see an advancement of his kingdom of his body of his life in me in you that's what I want to see that's the desire is to see him on display because everything else it'll take care of it and God knows what we can handle God knows what we need we don't even have to fret about it oh my there's just a Hunger for More of him because when Eliezer could just heed to the words of Abraham the Bible said God made his way to prosper and what was it what he was looking for he found he was under the leading of the Lord Joshua tells us under the leadership of the Holy Spirit God told Joshua he said if you will heed to my word not deviate from the left or right and meditate on it day and night make in other words make the word the center of every decision of every part of your life and then Thou shalt make thy way of a good success and prosperous right because to a real believer brother ramble picked us up you know a lot of times even as those that have been around for a while and you're reading in the message you you know brother Brown was it makes a sign that he pulling this from the scripture very clearly the Cloudy Skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval I don't know how many times I've come back to that quote I don't know brother Chris and I ain't the only ones I don't know how many times I've come back to that quote and in instruments that I've got it on my refrigerator it'd be a good one to put on my refrigerator though it'd be a good one to put on my mirror of a morning it'd be a good one putting next to my nightstand but it's been times when the Holy Spirit will bring in into tremendous we can get going in a certain pathway and the Holy Spirit will just drop right down and bring a quote right back to our attention a word right back and you know what it does it encourages us it strengthens us say wait a minute you know we're facing we're facing accusations like Joe faced but God has not left us alone amen I don't know how everything's going to come back but I've got a word from the Lord amen God would make it known that brights lies bright Skies Still Waters are no signs of his love and approval amen we know what those signs are because what he said what he's manifested how he's brought us to himself how he's gave us of his spirit and he's placed Us in his body amen so it's not something that we're just floating around on we know in whom we have believed we know he's working in our life we know what he's done so far I can stand on it because he's done it I hadn't done it he's done it and that's why that you know brother Brandon would pick that up over because it's the scripture seeing harvesting these things back that have laid in the scriptures that the people of God are not Material minded they're christ-minded you know sometimes there's things that we can look at in the word of God and we can see it and we can look we need God to come down and amplify it and just apply it to our lives because there's a lot of times in the word of God we can look at things and think well I ain't material minded I am christ-minded I I'm not Material but it's what what we are refocusing on what do we put our Ambitions on come on now you know there's things that we can get and it's like look I've got three boys right here I can become so wrapped up in them there's a responsibility I have and their mother has we've got to raise them the Bible didn't say raise them it said train them in other words you be an example and let them follow your example don't tell them what to do you lead the way and let them follow your leading train up a child in the way it should go right but but don't become material minded in the way that you direct them well what Lord what are you saying don't Focus their goals on Earthly temporal Ambitions let them know that the beginning of wisdom is to serve the Lord let them know that let them be that testimony somebody help me preach now see sometimes material minded we could think well I don't know you know brother Samuel dimes don't matter nothing to me at all but what are we focusing on sometimes that isn't dimes we're focusing on it's other material ways and let me tell you something I proved him I know he's a provider but the same how are we going to get here how they're going to get this I tell you what you put God first and expect the miraculous you put God first and wait and in fact the phenomenal to show up what are you doing I'll tell you what I'm doing I'm preparing for a miracle glory be to God just put your life in his hands and prepare for a miracle prepare for God to show up he is a Waymaker when you have a need he'll make a way don't just confine him to Healing your body and saving your soul but say Lord be God of everything of my life Lord let him show up in every experience Hallelujah amen we're not Material minded brother Brandon would put it that way we don't seek the treasures no we don't seek this is below we seek those that are above it's not Material it's within us that's what the kingdom of God is a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things remember in the Book of James I'm coming down remember in the book of James where it's roped they were buttering people they were the in the church in the church they had rich people coming in and they looked at the rich person said I eat something right here poor you don't got the name brands driving driving on beater you said you you stand back there you saw that one scripture that is a scripture it's you know what it shows there is a part about our flesh of sometimes what we value as real success and the things that we call success God calls foolishness is that right the Rich Young Ruler was a successful young man but it was foolish that he turned down the person of eternal life when God got to dealing with things that were in his life what was he dealing with what was holding him back brother tells us he takes us Jesus loved him he said no doubt this man this young man must have had an incredible conscience must have had an incredible character he goes through that in various parts of the message but what was it when the word began to deal in his life and what was it dealing with what's hindering you from a full surrender he turned around and the Bible said he walked away sorrowful because he had great possessions when his thinking was I got to give that up I got to let this go what what am I going to do what am I we're talking about the person of eternal life he who is life don't forget this Rich Young Ruler also knew this scripture it is God that giveth the power to give wealth that's Bible [Music] he knew the Commandments and even after his meeting with God I took a prophetic eye to tie this together that it's the same rich young man that Jesus speaks of in Luke 21. that after his encounter business started flourishing looks like he made it looks like I'm all right I didn't have to go to that extreme real good matter of fact he said you know what these barns ain't even big enough I gotta tear them down and I got to build some bigger ones glory to God God is blessing me he's blessing me and me he's having some praise breaks out there God is blessing me he's blessing me God's Got a Blessing with my name on he's got I mean he's just going around and around and around I'm believing all that but I believe in the real true spiritual blessings and you know what he said he got so bold that he said so just wrestle boy all is good all is good all is good and his life was required of him you know what he put his stock in was his riches the very thing that held him back from the kingdom of God I wonder sometimes it isn't riches sometimes it's clothing sometimes it's family sometimes it's this sometimes whatever it is that hinders a life from giving themselves fully to God it's the same thing that the Rich Young Ruler faced but oh I'll tell you what it's worth it to surrender it all because he's so much greater than anything he's so much greater than what the temporal of this world and whatever more that it could ever offer I I just want to give him everything amen let's just let's close right there tonight amen say Lord I Just Surrender oh Lord I just want to just surrendering just dedicating everything and all that I Am Lord to you what really matters when it comes down to the end of it what really matters what really matters you know brother Bram takes it up an invisible unit of the bride of Christ and he's talking about brother Lyle standing there on the platform how brother Lau has led his children you know to the Lord and things and brother but the brand goes through that and he talks about how you know those things and he says but you know where brother Lyle he said where he stands he said it's like in this life he said this life in itself he said everything that we could do will not matter much unless we've served the Lord that's what matters amen and I tell you within it all we look at this in the scripture we can see and I'm so thankful that within it that riches are not a requirement nor are riches a sign brother Brian goes through it does God is there some rich people in the kingdom sure there's some rich Paul said not many right not many but how the real rich people are those who's rich in him amen is rich in him Lord I just want more of you I want more of you help me Lord if my if I've Got My Mind on other things if I've Got My Mind on this or mind on that I'm trusting in you Lord Jesus I'm trusting in you Lord to grind me and direct me because I want to make my way prosperous I want to see more of you in my life we're not Beyond getting off track or getting our sights or getting our Focus wrong don't ever get that in your mind that oh I've got it all set no we need his leadership this is why Hebrews 4 12 the word of God is quick more powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it cuts dividing the bone from the moral it it goes down to discern the very intents of the heart I'm glad that we serve that kind of a God I I want if my intentions that are within me right now even plans that I have if God if those plans do not align with your plans I don't wanna it might break my heart it might disappoint me right brother Brown said he's told me no over and over he's broken my heart time and time again but I love him for it I want like the song says as musicians would come what you want Lord you know what's best for me you know we can look and it's nothing wrong we can look at something we can look at things and even sometimes you know how it is sometimes you've got to pray about maybe a job or promotion or something comes up but it's so good to be able to put it in prayer and say Lord what do what do you say about this because there might be things that I don't even see about it that you see and what matters most to me is is I want to serve you with all my heart that's a main priority in my life is I want more of you Lord I want to walk in your presence I I I that's my desire so Lord will you guide me because you know what I'm able to handle you know what your will is because any door that God opens up you know God will God makes a way for you and I to be able to stand in that place God provides God makes a way is that right that's why as a Believer we don't have to force any door open we don't have to butter nobody up I mean sure we should be nice to people but we don't have to butter anybody up because once you butter them up one side you better have enough butter to go to the other side as well right because what's got you your position is the butter but oh God I don't want anything that you haven't led me into if my plans don't match with your plans then Lord just take it out of My Heart Lord I I just want I want to say Amen to the word I want to say so be it Lord in my life boy that's my desires there be a spiritual prospering my life would grow in you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord a desire that rises from within our hearts Lord job was able to look with an understanding he was able to see and to know just by experiences the he saw the wicked around me he saw these things of where they had went on and things there might have been some that were cut off removed but job was letting them know that that prosperity in the natural in these things and blessings and that's that's no sign of God's blessing when I think of how your Prophet even takes it deeper oh how we appreciate Lord the blessings of God how we appreciate Lord your presence moving down that God May our hearts May every heart just welcoming you Lord in fully to where Lord there's no resting upon feeling and emotion a blessing because that's there's no life in that all of those things Lord they come apart they come with the package but we understand that Lord even in that part of it the rain falls on the just and unjust your God our hearts desire is Lord I want to be changed Lord have been changed and I want to I want to continue to be changed that's a promise the Lord is here we are in the presence of the Shekinah Glory that Shekinah dwelling in our lives and Lord we are changed from Glory unto Glory even as by the spirit of the Lord oh God may that be our ambition may that be our desire may that be Lord the consolation in our heart what really matters when we think of this year 2023 what really matters what really matters what is it that really matters in our life what because whatever really matters is what we will make time for we will make sacrifices we will cut out this we will cut out that we will stop this we will We whatever really matters is what we will give ourselves to help us Lord whether it's material things offenses jobs family whatever Lord help us help us to move in that right order with everything because we know there's an order and there's a blessing in the order of God help us Lord that our lives where the Bible could say order my steps in Thy Word that's our desire Lord if there's some things that we've cut out or we've compromised on that we didn't need to cut out or shouldn't have been help us the Lord to cut out the other things that we've cut in and everything Lord would be right back in this place to where it needs to be may that be the focus Lord may that be in our heart as we move into this year what really matters what really matters what what's what's my focus even in this year and not just so broad within this year but when I wake up in the morning what's my focus today what really matters today Lord I desire The Daily Bread I desire Lord that your will would be done in my life I desire Lord to see your word come to pass Lord help me Lord I pray Guide Me Lord then the next day comes Lord because it's step by step [Music] I'm sure that Lord God as every one of us can look throughout the whole year and we could we have a desire but God may we reflect on it Lord may it be that Lord that burns within our hearts may it be that Lord God that rises and when decisions Lord are to be made and come our way may that be a question that permeates Lord in our hearts what really matters help us Lord I'm sure Lord God that if we could go just as children others if we could take the Lord within a home and ask a children what really matters what really matters oh God they would be Lord to express the desire Lord the desire Lord there would be to be expressed the testimony serve the Lord to serve his purpose what really matters does this matter does degree matter does career matter do great well yeah all of those things matter but what really matters is the Lord Jesus because he will supply according to all my needs he will help me and direct me when I've got a test that comes up I can give my very best and look to him and say God help me to gather out of this class or out of this what I need to understand and know I'm not interested in just passing a test you know the plans that you've laid for my life you know what I need out of this Lord God May Our Lives Lord our homes Lord fathers mothers May Lord God through the assembly on and on may that be Lord God where the testimony what really matters what really matters Lord You're The One I'll just go ahead and say it Lord in this assembly it's you that matters it's the real baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what really matters the real new birth that's what really matters the word that's what really matters that's what matters and Lord God help us Lord I pray help us the Lord God that we can amen what really matters Lord help us Lord where we can leave Lord our feelings to the side Lord help us Lord God that where we can look out and take in those things that really matter Lord cutting away every hindrance from our life Lloyd everything that would want to take us away Lord what really matters granted Lord may we lord look and take that in and throughout the days even reflecting and God as your presence would go on with us Lord from here I'm thankful Lord we can evaluate we
