[37:51] some things and I think there's been
[37:53] others it's battled with some sickness

[37:57] seems like when you come back from a a
[37:59] meeting like that and different things
[38:01] and like God's grace I didn't get sick
[38:03] but I just said you know the enemy's
[38:05] just upset and I know there were others

[41:33] all the way maybe through the night but
[41:34] it's just continued to just just
[41:37] continue to go on you know I just been
[41:39] starting to see results this all through
[41:40] my life from that night and there was
[41:43] one day at work I mean for myself you
[41:45] know I always sing all the time wherever
[41:46] I go it's not just here I mean it's
[41:48] everywhere it's at home at my job you
[41:50] know I'm passing selling chicken just
[41:52] singing away I just don't care where I'm
[41:54] at I'm just gonna have church I don't
[41:55] have I'm just gonna have a good time and
[41:57] there was one I think it was the Tuesday
[41:59] I got back home and uh I was just I was
[42:03] just having a good time I started
[42:04] singing a song that brother Andrew
[42:05] Spencer uh sang at the choir and I just
[42:08] really started singing I started dancing
[42:10] started getting the moves and all that
[42:11] and one of the one of the one of the
[42:14] customers out there they said you know
[42:16] you're not just happy you got joy she
[42:18] said you Joy that's different than
[42:20] happiness so I thank God for that just
[42:23] thank God for touching me and hey man
[42:25] just uh so looking forward to what he
[42:27] has in store amen so
[42:34] thank you
[42:46] it's good to testify so
[42:48] just really quick not like a huge
[42:50] testimony I mean it is kind of for me
[42:52] but different complexes I had carried
[42:55] throughout my life when I was like a
[42:57] young middle teen I don't want to get
[42:58] into what those were obviously for
[43:00] obvious reasons but
[43:02] um it was things that just
[43:05] the devil had told me a bunch of lies
[43:06] about whether it was you know just a lot
[43:09] of different things in my life where
[43:11] things happened in my life where
[43:12] disappointments discouragements happened
[43:14] but
[43:16] you know God's really been working in my
[43:18] life and I can see I can look back to a
[43:20] Time
[43:21] like one example is when brother Andrew
[43:23] Spencer was preaching and he said you
[43:25] know the devil's been fighting you and
[43:27] he's been battling you he's like
[43:28] but you're but you walk through the door
[43:30] didn't you and I stood up and I started
[43:32] you know clap my hands worshiping
[43:34] because I realized that there was a
[43:35] point in my life where
[43:37] I wouldn't have wanted to be at a camp
[43:38] meeting like that and that changed for
[43:41] me
[43:42] and to even being the type of involved
[43:45] in the type of ministry and to respond
[43:47] to the ministry the way I was able to at
[43:49] that weekend that was incredible to me
[43:50] because again that was a complex I had
[43:53] built and I just you know Lord Set Me
[43:56] Free I believe and because I went
[43:58] through the prayer line one of the
[43:59] things that brother uh Joe Adams was
[44:01] talked to me about was
[44:03] he he came up I was coming through the
[44:05] line and then he grabbed me and he said
[44:07] I said you forget all those complexes
[44:09] and
[44:10] I I talked to him earlier that day but
[44:14] I don't know if it was the discernment
[44:15] of the Lord because I I didn't mention
[44:17] anything about different ways in my mind
[44:19] was working on certain things
[44:21] but I just was an awesome meeting I'm
[44:23] just thankful to God for his work in my
[44:25] life
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:42] amen so Camp
[44:46] um just a lot of things you know like
[44:50] byc he got the Holy Ghost you know but
[44:53] at twt I was just you know hoping for a
[44:56] refilling you know and uh
[44:59] I was just you know praying you know and
[45:01] uh
[45:03] he just
[45:04] ah I just started just confessing that I
[45:07] had a refilling and then I just felt
[45:09] that fire in my soul so God still
[45:13] refills amen
[45:15] [Applause]
[45:23] I should have and I realized that uh
[45:25] even if we got back from byc
[45:27] um and I realized that this morning that
[45:30] I I thought oh my goodness and even
[45:33] after last week I thought man I didn't
[45:34] even allow time for for testimonies and
[45:37] that's just uh not that I don't believe
[45:39] in them I do believe in them but
[45:42] sometimes my mind the way that I operate
[45:44] is just a one-track mind and that's just
[45:46] not when I stand Here on a Sunday
[45:48] morning but even throughout the week
[45:49] sometimes my wife will catch me you
[45:52] should say are you there
[45:54] and you know the things you're studying
[45:57] you're praying about and it's just you
[45:58] get into a vein of a channel and I don't
[46:01] say that to make myself anything it's
[46:02] just that's just how I am I've talked to
[46:04] other brothers and know some of my
[46:07] buddies and things like that they can
[46:08] kind of get into a little bit of a
[46:10] discussion I said look I'm not even
[46:12] going down that track to get into
[46:15] discussion on this and post this and I
[46:17] said because I get into a vein and I
[46:20] don't want nothing taking me from that
[46:22] vein nothing and I said I don't even I
[46:25] said for me it's just like somebody
[46:26] sends me something or whatever more I
[46:28] don't go look at it watch it read it or
[46:30] whatever right away I just I wait and
[46:33] then there comes a time that I can do
[46:34] that but I just want to say I appreciate
[46:37] the testimonies I know that little Aaron
[46:40] wasn't here and anybody else that wants
[46:42] to give a testimony anyone well I don't
[46:46] say anyone but but there was from Camp
[46:48] even though I know others have
[46:49] testimonies as well too so I got to
[46:52] preach sometime
[46:54] here this morning but I think it'd be
[46:56] good with no doubt we need to have a
[46:58] testimony service and so I apologize for
[47:00] not having that laid out and may the
[47:03] Lord help me and my wife my my personal
[47:05] secretary she's the one that really
[47:08] helps me and reminds me and uh this post
[47:10] to note today I actually wrote that on
[47:12] my own
[47:13] usually she has my Post-It notes waiting
[47:15] on me and so I appreciate that because
[47:17] she knows I need that help within that
[47:20] so I just want to say I'm so thankful to
[47:23] see what God is doing and you know it's
[47:26] funny because uh
[47:28] well I could talk a lot more you know
[47:31] within just seeing what God has done
[47:32] from byc and then in twt I'll tell you
[47:35] what it's just some powerful services
[47:37] and what God has done in in the services
[47:40] there and so we just thank God for a
[47:42] life-changing God God is still moving
[47:45] God is still changing lives and God
[47:47] knows exactly what we have need of Amen
[47:50] so I think it's one of those things
[47:52] where I look at it with the the youth
[47:54] and the and the young people I believe
[47:55] brother Brahm says every generation
[47:57] deserves a fresh chance at the word of
[48:00] God and and I think of it in in this way
[48:02] that um
[48:04] you know God has sent a word in this
[48:06] hour that's for for all of us it's for
[48:08] every age and that word comes to bring a
[48:11] real change and a real Liberty in our
[48:13] lives that's the same Lord Jesus Among
[48:16] Us and to me it's nothing to me I Get No
[48:20] Greater Joy than to see lives that have
[48:22] just been set free and God takes a hold
[48:25] of that life and we're just so grateful
[48:27] for that and uh so we just want to say
[48:30] God bless you this morning I want to
[48:32] also greet the visitors amen God bless
[48:34] you amen sister Linda sister Kylie amen
[48:36] God bless you all for being here I know
[48:39] was there anybody else you greeted as a
[48:41] visitor

[48:46] not visitors but yeah you're you're here
[48:48] but we're glad we're glad you're here

[48:53] the house of the Lord with us and now so
[48:55] glad to be together if we could let's
[48:57] just stand and we'll change the order of
[48:59] the service here this morning

[51:47] I'm thankful we didn't have to canoe in
[51:49] here today
[51:51] see different ones it's made it through
[51:53] the storm and I know different ones all
[51:56] the way across and I don't know if that
[51:58] had different flooded basements I don't
[51:59] know if you knew this or not but I was
[52:01] mentioning it when we were praying in
[52:03] the back I I looked over it last night
[52:06] you know on Thursday night there were
[52:08] eight tornadoes that touched down
[52:11] from Portage then it went Vermillion
[52:13] touched down and then and all the way
[52:15] across the last one was in Chardon so it
[52:18] came all the way across and it just kept
[52:20] you know the different ones but I thank
[52:22] God for his Mercy yes and I know that
[52:25] different ones I know that I had
[52:27] neighbors all around me that uh you know
[52:29] you start seeing in the carpet laying
[52:31] out on the streets and the Furnitures
[52:33] from the basements and things and so you
[52:35] know my heart just really went to them
[52:38] and I expressed that to them and but I'm
[52:40] glad to be here this morning
[52:43] glad that God has made a way and my
[52:45] heart's desire is Lord that he'll just
[52:47] come by our way and he knows what we
[52:49] have need of you know even when we Face
[52:51] even the storms of life God knows what
[52:54] we have made of
[52:55] and Lord I just pray as Lord just come
[52:57] by our way and encourage us
[52:59] amen strengthen us Lord minister to our
[53:02] hearts so Titus Chapter 2 Verse 11.
[53:06] the scripture says for the grace of God
[53:08] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[53:13] all men
[53:15] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[53:19] worldly lust we should live soberly
[53:22] righteously and godly in this present
[53:26] world looking for that blessed hope and
[53:30] the Glorious appearing of the great God
[53:32] and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave
[53:37] himself for us that he might redeem us
[53:40] from all iniquity and purify unto
[53:43] himself of peculiar people
[53:47] zealous of Good Works amen may the Lord
[53:50] bless the reading of the word as you're
[53:52] being seated here this morning
[53:55] I want to continue to just that that
[53:58] point and that thought on Grace
[54:02] appearing
[54:04] and this is where in the in the
[54:07] scriptures as we've been looking at that
[54:09] thought on the grace of God and we've
[54:13] been looking at that now for some for a
[54:16] few weeks but I want to look at this
[54:18] just a little more here this morning and
[54:21] I want to just dive right back into that
[54:23] and try to just resume where we were
[54:25] last week in Titus Chapter 2 verse 11
[54:30] out of I want to read out of the
[54:32] Amplified version it says for the grace
[54:34] of God which is his unmerited favor and
[54:37] blessing has come forward or appeared
[54:41] for the deliverance from sin and the
[54:45] Eternal salvation For All Mankind
[54:48] so that appearing to for that to appear
[54:51] this very word it deals with where
[54:54] something becomes visible where
[54:57] something itself becomes light where it
[55:01] becomes known where it becomes
[55:03] manifested and we went into the
[55:06] scriptures and we were looking at the on
[55:09] the appearing and when Grace itself that
[55:11] has appeared this Grace has come the
[55:14] grace of God Has Come forward that
[55:18] bringeth salvation hath appeared unto
[55:21] all men and when we think of that with
[55:24] the grace of God we know that that that
[55:26] term and I don't want to get bogged down
[55:29] with this because I'll get to it but the
[55:31] term Grace itself is many times where we
[55:35] see that's been down uh even not just
[55:38] now but it started in the early church
[55:41] age Satan is always attacked the true
[55:44] grace of God and that's where I remember
[55:46] when Paul and uh Jude under inspiration
[55:49] he the admonition was to contend for the
[55:53] faith uh earnestly contend for it for
[55:57] the faith that was once delivered to the
[55:59] Church of the Living God because he said
[56:02] men have crept in unawares now they when
[56:05] they crept in they didn't come the right
[56:07] way because anyone who comes through the
[56:10] door you've got to come through the word
[56:11] you've got to come through Christ is
[56:13] that right I mean you come in through
[56:15] him then you have experience not only
[56:17] have has the grace become visible to you
[56:20] but now you have become a partaker of it
[56:22] and now that same Grace is visible in
[56:25] your own life and so he says that there
[56:28] were men in that time that had crept in
[56:30] that had turned the grace of God into
[56:32] our lasciviousness now we know if Satan
[56:35] has done anything to want to come and to
[56:38] take away of the grace of God He is we
[56:41] recognized that his whole point within
[56:44] it is to try to take what God has
[56:46] desired for you and I to be a partaker
[56:49] of and so to recognize if we can say it
[56:53] in this way we want to look at that
[56:54] Grace that has come to us even in this
[56:57] hour and so when we look back at Matthew
[57:00] chapter 1 and verse 21 the scripture
[57:03] says and she shall bring forth a son and
[57:06] thou shalt call his name Jesus for he
[57:10] shall save his people from their sins
[57:14] now I want you to notice this he shall
[57:17] save his people from their sins he's not
[57:20] talking about the Jews he's talking
[57:22] about his elect seed
[57:26] he shall save his people from their sins
[57:30] not in their sins but from them
[57:34] so the word save is the word Sozo and
[57:38] that word it means to save or to keep
[57:40] safe and sound and to rescue from danger
[57:44] or destruction it is to also to save one
[57:47] from injury or Pearl to save a suffering
[57:51] one from perishing one suffering from
[57:54] disease to make well to heal to restore
[57:57] to health and to preserve one who is in
[58:01] danger of Destruction or to save or
[58:04] rescue God is still in the saving
[58:07] business
[58:08] remember they were on the the the the
[58:10] the the the sea that night and and here
[58:13] he was uh you know they were about to
[58:16] sink and they called out to him to
[58:19] awaken him and said awake and save us
[58:22] lest we perish so at least they knew who
[58:27] to call on
[58:28] and he stepped forward and he brought
[58:31] Deliverance to them by taking care of
[58:34] not only what was causing the
[58:37] disturbance but the Bible said as soon
[58:39] as he spoke peace be still not only did
[58:42] the storm and the wind stop but
[58:44] immediately the waves stopped
[58:47] now you know after a storm goes through
[58:49] waves don't stop right away
[58:52] but he was over the storm and there over
[58:56] that of all of creation you think of
[58:58] evil when Peter himself was going down
[59:01] and he you know he had got his eyes off
[59:04] the Lord Jesus and he started to go down
[59:06] and anytime a person ever gets their
[59:09] eyes off of the Lord they are going to
[59:11] begin to sink but at least Peter had
[59:15] enough about him to realize the one who
[59:17] bid me even though I had got my eyes off
[59:20] of him but saved me Lord and here as he
[59:24] reached out his hand the one who bit him
[59:26] come reached down and lifted him above
[59:31] that water and they made it back to the
[59:33] boat now when we look at this with
[59:35] saving I want to just look into it
[59:37] diving into it just a little bit in
[59:39] Matthew 18 11 for the son of man is come
[59:43] to save that which was lost I want to
[59:47] say that when God became flesh he was on
[59:50] a mission
[59:51] this was not a haphazard event
[59:55] because we recognize predestination is
[59:59] not something that is a new doctrine
[1:00:01] predestination was not something that
[1:00:03] William Branham came up with it is the
[1:00:06] scriptures all the way through you can
[1:00:08] preach it from Genesis 1 clear to the
[1:00:11] closing scriptures in the Bible and to
[1:00:14] realize it that it's not us and
[1:00:16] ourselves that gives ourselves Faith to
[1:00:19] believe that but it is God in his
[1:00:22] infinite Mercy as he's passing by it's
[1:00:25] like a great magnet that's coming down
[1:00:27] whatever is magnetized and has those
[1:00:30] properties in it when that magnet passes
[1:00:33] by it only stirs up the properties that
[1:00:36] was already in it and that's exactly
[1:00:38] when the presence of God begins to move
[1:00:41] down through a group of people through a
[1:00:44] body Believers through an age it's the
[1:00:47] same great magnet of the holy spirit
[1:00:49] that it'll draw upon those that are
[1:00:52] magnetized to it now you know when
[1:00:54] things are magnetic ties either further
[1:00:57] away you get the less the pool is but
[1:01:00] the closer you get the stronger the pool
[1:01:03] is and if you can just call ask that God
[1:01:06] loosen everything out of my life that's
[1:01:09] bowling me down hindering me Lord and
[1:01:12] stopping me from making my way to that
[1:01:15] magnet God will come on the scene and
[1:01:18] God will do that for you
[1:01:21] you believe that
[1:01:24] amen I'm standing as a witness we Are
[1:01:26] Witnesses of the grace of almighty God
[1:01:30] amen God never asked me or you to free
[1:01:33] ourselves but we have to fight for it
[1:01:36] is that right is something to press for
[1:01:38] and say Yes Lord that's my desire now so
[1:01:42] he came to save that which was lost so
[1:01:45] if it was lost and there had to be a
[1:01:48] time that it wasn't lost but he came to
[1:01:51] find what was lost and remember it
[1:01:53] wasn't God who was lost it was you and
[1:01:55] me who were lost
[1:01:56] when he came he came to seek and save
[1:01:59] that which was lost now Isaiah 45 21 I
[1:02:03] love the Scripture it says let me go to
[1:02:05] the bottom here and it says Tell ye and
[1:02:07] bring them near yea let them take
[1:02:10] counsel together who hath declared this
[1:02:12] from ancient time who had told it from
[1:02:15] that time have not I the lord and there
[1:02:17] is no God else beside me a just God and
[1:02:22] a savior there is none beside me
[1:02:26] adjust God and a savior you know God had
[1:02:29] manifested this attribute of Savior time
[1:02:33] and time again in the Old Testament
[1:02:35] remember the scripture we read uh last
[1:02:37] week out in Nehemiah chapter nine where
[1:02:39] according to his manifold mercies he
[1:02:42] here he sent saviors unto them to save
[1:02:46] them now the man himself whether it was
[1:02:48] Gideon Moses Elijah on and on those men
[1:02:52] within themselves did not have anything
[1:02:55] or any ability to save those people but
[1:02:59] they had come in contact with the
[1:03:00] presence of God and they were standing
[1:03:03] as yielded vessels with a direct word
[1:03:06] from almighty God and there would be
[1:03:08] signs and wonders that would accompany
[1:03:10] that word and remember to show that it
[1:03:13] was a word from God it never left the
[1:03:17] people in bondage that's how every
[1:03:20] message is judged we judge them with the
[1:03:23] message by the word we judge the signs
[1:03:26] and one by the word and to realize when
[1:03:29] it is God it does not leave us in the
[1:03:32] same mess that he found us in
[1:03:35] God is a savior
[1:03:38] he's a just God and he is a savior oh
[1:03:43] mama so every time God would send this
[1:03:46] and he would manifest himself there is
[1:03:49] none else beside me verse 22. now and
[1:03:51] when you think about it in each of those
[1:03:53] times Israel did not deserve it one time
[1:03:57] is that right
[1:03:59] they didn't deserve it you and I didn't
[1:04:01] deserve it you see what Grace Grace is
[1:04:03] not something that you or I deserve
[1:04:07] it is God in his grace listen for you
[1:04:11] and I to even begin to hunger after God
[1:04:13] it is God's grace moving upon our life
[1:04:16] that begins to draw Upon Our Life the
[1:04:19] Bible said blessed are they that do
[1:04:21] hunger and thirst for righteousness for
[1:04:22] they shall be filled and brothers said
[1:04:26] for that scripture to be moving in your
[1:04:28] life it shows the Holy Ghost is upon you
[1:04:31] not in you yet but upon you and what's
[1:04:34] God doing he's stirring up that desire
[1:04:37] on the inside
[1:04:40] even when Israel would be in Babylon to
[1:04:42] come back into the land of Israel God
[1:04:45] said he would begin to move upon their
[1:04:47] heart and he would begin to cause that
[1:04:49] their heart where they would begin to
[1:04:51] seek after him with all their heart he
[1:04:54] said then I'll be found in you how can
[1:04:56] that be unless there is the grace of God
[1:04:59] moving upon the people of God in that
[1:05:02] hour
[1:05:03] is that right
[1:05:05] look unto me notice verse 22 look unto
[1:05:09] me and be saved all the ends of the
[1:05:13] Earth for I am God and there is none
[1:05:16] else oh I love this I have sworn by
[1:05:19] myself the word has gone out of my mouth
[1:05:22] in righteousness and shall not return
[1:05:24] that unto me every knee shall bow and
[1:05:28] every tongue shall swear
[1:05:30] do you realize that God moving upon your
[1:05:33] life and bringing salvation to your life
[1:05:35] even everything that you were wrapped up
[1:05:38] in no matter what sin complexes and
[1:05:40] whatever that God rides in in Victory in
[1:05:44] your life as you surrender and he makes
[1:05:46] those Devils bow down to him he makes
[1:05:49] them bow down and recognize he's still
[1:05:51] the mighty conqueror right here in 2023
[1:05:54] it doesn't matter with the darkness is
[1:05:56] upon us it's a gross Darkness but he's
[1:05:59] still the mighty conqueror
[1:06:01] glory be to God every demon has to bow
[1:06:04] to the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:07] every devil I I've not seen one that he
[1:06:09] hadn't conquered even in this age that
[1:06:12] we're living in in the time of
[1:06:14] prevailing spirits but he's still the
[1:06:16] mighty conqueror
[1:06:19] First Timothy 1 15 this is a faithful
[1:06:22] saying and worthy of all acceptation
[1:06:24] that Christ Jesus came into the world to
[1:06:28] save Sinners of whom I am chief
[1:06:33] and Isaiah 53 10 yet it pleased the Lord
[1:06:37] let's break in on this of Calvary yet it
[1:06:39] pleased the Lord to Bruce him he hath
[1:06:42] put him to grief when wind Thou shalt
[1:06:44] make his soul an offering for sin he
[1:06:48] shall see his seed he shall prolong his
[1:06:50] days and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:06:53] prosper in his hand he shall see of the
[1:06:56] travail of his soul and shall be
[1:06:59] satisfying by his knowledge shall my
[1:07:02] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:07:06] shall bear their iniquities therefore
[1:07:09] will I divide him a portion with the
[1:07:12] great and he shall divide the spoil with
[1:07:15] the strong that word strong is messiah's
[1:07:17] brothers because he hath poured out his
[1:07:20] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[1:07:23] the transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:07:27] many and made intercession for the
[1:07:31] transgressors we were slave to sin
[1:07:36] and one of the first words and first
[1:07:38] that begins with Redemption is someone
[1:07:40] has to come into the market and make a
[1:07:43] purchase and God himself came became one
[1:07:46] of us and he made the purchase but not
[1:07:50] only did he purchase us but he also
[1:07:53] bought us out of the market where we
[1:07:55] could never ever be sold again
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] That's The Power of redemption oh my
[1:08:03] amen now think of it here in Mark
[1:08:06] chapter 10 verse 45 I'm just giving
[1:08:08] these scriptures here for weaving the
[1:08:10] son of man came not to be ministered
[1:08:12] unto but to minister and to give his
[1:08:15] life a ransom for many First Timothy 2 5
[1:08:20] for there is one God and one mediator
[1:08:23] between God and Men the man Christ Jesus
[1:08:27] who gave himself a ransom for all to be
[1:08:32] testified in due time in Galatians 1 3
[1:08:36] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[1:08:40] father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:42] who gave himself for our sins that he
[1:08:47] might Deliver Us from this present evil
[1:08:51] world according to the will of God and
[1:08:53] our father to whom be glory forever and
[1:08:57] ever amen now coming back to that
[1:09:00] scripture in Titus Chapter 2 notice
[1:09:03] verse 14 who gave himself for us once
[1:09:07] again there is a reason that he came he
[1:09:12] came to redeem
[1:09:14] right he gave himself for us now the
[1:09:17] scripture would tell us in John 3 16 and
[1:09:20] 3 17 that whosoever believeth in him
[1:09:23] might be saved
[1:09:26] right might be saved but there is a
[1:09:29] place that's greater than might it's a
[1:09:31] place of security and that's a place in
[1:09:33] him right and that's comes through the
[1:09:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost then we are
[1:09:39] baptized in him but yet there are many
[1:09:40] and we understand that by the scripture
[1:09:42] that there will be there's many
[1:09:44] different classes that are saved but
[1:09:47] they that they are not part of the Bride
[1:09:50] of Jesus Christ they will not be in the
[1:09:52] Rapture they will miss the wedding
[1:09:54] supper they will miss the Millennium is
[1:09:57] that right and they will receive or be
[1:09:59] granted to enter into life standing
[1:10:02] there at the white Throne judgment
[1:10:04] but the Rapture is for the Bride of
[1:10:08] Jesus Christ
[1:10:10] is that right so there is there is a
[1:10:13] saving when it says that it came into
[1:10:15] the world to save Sinners Like Paul said
[1:10:17] of whom I'm chief he did come in order
[1:10:21] to save you and I to rescue you and I to
[1:10:24] deliver us to bring a Deliverance in our
[1:10:26] life that's why the grace of God
[1:10:28] appeared because we were not able and
[1:10:31] could not do anything on our own
[1:10:35] I won't want you to leave this back just
[1:10:37] 2 000 years ago but it's the same Lord
[1:10:40] Jesus come right here Among Us in the
[1:10:43] promise of his word
[1:10:46] that's why when a person says well you
[1:10:48] know I just love Jesus you can't love
[1:10:50] Jesus and not love his word
[1:10:53] if you don't love this word you don't
[1:10:55] love Jesus because he is the word made
[1:10:59] Flash
[1:11:01] so let all the defectors detractors and
[1:11:04] everything else say well I just want
[1:11:06] Jesus Jesus is the word
[1:11:08] you can't say you love Jesus and you
[1:11:11] don't love his word
[1:11:12] [Music]
[1:11:14] you see what you find as many are with
[1:11:16] caught up with the concept of Grace that
[1:11:19] for that that has been given by
[1:11:21] individuals that have never experienced
[1:11:23] Grace
[1:11:25] are you hearing me now
[1:11:28] I believe I want you to understand I
[1:11:30] believe there's some that's out there
[1:11:31] that like brother Brown said there are
[1:11:33] those that will be saved that if they're
[1:11:34] trusting in their Church they're lost
[1:11:37] but if they're trusting in Jesus Christ
[1:11:39] for their salvation they're saved
[1:11:44] and you know here's the reality of it if
[1:11:47] there's not a hunger in them for
[1:11:48] anything more they're not ordained to
[1:11:51] anything more but if there's a hunger in
[1:11:54] your heart for more there's ordained for
[1:11:57] more
[1:11:58] right we're not here I'm not here to put
[1:12:01] anybody down I'm just here preaching a
[1:12:03] message that is calling to the Bride of
[1:12:06] Jesus Christ that's the only ones that
[1:12:08] will respond to this word
[1:12:11] are you hearing me you can't teach it in
[1:12:13] hammering in it is given by the election
[1:12:16] of almighty God that's why the prophet
[1:12:19] said your experience is not taught into
[1:12:21] you it's predestinated by the hand of
[1:12:25] almighty God I hope you listen to me now
[1:12:27] that's where sometimes we get ahead and
[1:12:30] we want to push on things and push on
[1:12:32] things listen everyone has their
[1:12:35] appointed season where God comes down
[1:12:37] and fills them with the Holy Ghost
[1:12:38] you're not going to get ahead of it
[1:12:40] you're not behind that get as everything
[1:12:43] is right on time
[1:12:45] but you see it's Satan's desire to try
[1:12:49] to bring confusion frustration build
[1:12:51] complexes and everything else but listen
[1:12:54] this is where your focus needs to be if
[1:12:57] there is any promise to be given and
[1:13:00] obtained it will be according to the
[1:13:02] grace of God so let me just encourage
[1:13:04] you like this turn your eyes away from
[1:13:07] your efforts from your trying and let
[1:13:10] your eyes be placed on the Lord Jesus
[1:13:12] and listen this is how I would pray in
[1:13:14] this hour I would say God lead me to the
[1:13:17] place of where I need to be in my life
[1:13:20] he's faithful as a Shepherd to lead us
[1:13:24] to that place to bring our hearts into
[1:13:26] that condition God knows what he's doing
[1:13:29] listen the same God that brought Sarah
[1:13:32] and Abraham in condition to receive the
[1:13:35] promised son he's the same God right
[1:13:37] here this morning that's able to bring
[1:13:39] your heart your life right into the
[1:13:42] place it needs to be what do I need to
[1:13:44] do surrender to the grace of God that's
[1:13:47] appearing to your life and in humility
[1:13:49] say God bring me to that place Lord lead
[1:13:53] me to that place
[1:13:56] foreign
[1:13:58] [Music]
[1:14:02] Hallelujah
[1:14:03] oh my well brother Samuel why is Faith
[1:14:06] preached and why sometimes when faith is
[1:14:08] preached and you know things are
[1:14:10] preached with healing and things are
[1:14:12] preached on the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:13] Ghost because let me just tell you God's
[1:14:15] a sovereign God
[1:14:17] knows every moment
[1:14:20] are you hearing me God knows every
[1:14:22] moment it's no surprise you got the holy
[1:14:24] ghost at this point or that point
[1:14:26] there's no surprise to God it's all
[1:14:29] arranged by God
[1:14:31] it don't mean he's going to drag us into
[1:14:33] it or push us into it it's God that is
[1:14:36] aligning everything
[1:14:38] remember brother random when he went
[1:14:40] into that room it was sure that that
[1:14:42] little boy was going to be healed and
[1:14:45] brother Brandon went over that morning
[1:14:46] picked that little boy up pray for him
[1:14:48] he got worse
[1:14:50] preach with me now that's the same thing
[1:14:53] that happens many times even with lives
[1:14:55] just wanting to seek the Holy Ghost
[1:14:57] seeking for healing and what it is is
[1:14:59] trying to reach out within that but let
[1:15:01] me just say this to you it's a promise
[1:15:03] that God has given and just as much as
[1:15:05] the prophet himself had to wait on God
[1:15:08] that who needs to sit in this chair
[1:15:10] where these glasses need to be and who
[1:15:13] needs to be in the house God himself
[1:15:15] knows how to put everything in order and
[1:15:18] all he needs is for you and I to
[1:15:20] surrender to him that's the same way
[1:15:22] with your loved ones it's the same way
[1:15:24] with your children God is the one who
[1:15:27] orchestrates everything say God let my
[1:15:30] frustrations be buried in the blood of
[1:15:33] Jesus Christ because we're all human we
[1:15:36] all get frustrated but Lord let my
[1:15:38] frustrations be under the leadership of
[1:15:41] the Lord
[1:15:44] who gave himself for us that he might
[1:15:48] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[1:15:53] unto himself are peculiar people zealous
[1:15:57] of good works now I want you to notice
[1:15:59] this that he might redeem us from all
[1:16:03] iniquity so he's removing us from all of
[1:16:06] that redeem us paying the price and to
[1:16:10] purify to bring that cleansing and to
[1:16:13] bring a people unto himself a peculiar
[1:16:15] people one that he himself is able and
[1:16:19] designates these are my people
[1:16:22] and resilience of good works
[1:16:26] now this is why in Hebrews chapter 12 it
[1:16:29] says wherefore seeing we also are
[1:16:31] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:16:33] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:16:36] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:16:39] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:16:42] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[1:16:47] the author and finisher of our faith who
[1:16:50] for the joy that was set before him
[1:16:52] endured the cross despising the same and
[1:16:56] is set down at the right hand of the
[1:16:58] Throne of God now I want you to notice
[1:17:00] this it would seem like a commonality
[1:17:03] that where our lives and people can read
[1:17:05] the Bible they can talk about Jesus they
[1:17:08] can talk about God but remember he is
[1:17:10] not only the god of history but he's the
[1:17:13] same God right here this morning he said
[1:17:16] I'm the same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:20] is that right so to see the looking unto
[1:17:23] Jesus there there is a catching when we
[1:17:26] look at the scripture that in that time
[1:17:28] Not only was was the word being
[1:17:31] delivered in that hour to those in the
[1:17:33] among the Hebrews in that time and when
[1:17:36] Paul was delivering this but it was also
[1:17:38] speaking of the hour that you and I
[1:17:41] would be living in where it would call
[1:17:43] you and I to look away from all the
[1:17:46] tradition and the isms of man to get our
[1:17:49] eyes off of ourselves and to look unto
[1:17:51] Jesus now now you know right now if I
[1:17:54] were to tell you to look at something
[1:17:55] and say you know if we had clear windows
[1:17:58] here and I could say look at that buck
[1:17:59] over there there's something that I'm
[1:18:01] seeing that I'm telling you about and
[1:18:04] what I'm telling you about I'm trying to
[1:18:05] get your attention to look to that thing
[1:18:08] right I'm not trying to get your
[1:18:10] attention to look to me but what I am
[1:18:12] saying is about an object that I'm
[1:18:14] seeing and the focus is so that your
[1:18:17] attention it actually follows to see the
[1:18:21] object that the word is proclaiming is
[1:18:23] there and so when we recognize in this
[1:18:26] hour there is a promise that God gave
[1:18:29] for this hour for this time there was
[1:18:32] the promise of the Resurrection sign it
[1:18:36] was the promise of the Messiah in this
[1:18:38] hour that the same God that meant
[1:18:41] Abraham the same God who came down and
[1:18:44] through the body of our Lord Jesus and
[1:18:46] paid the price also announced to you and
[1:18:48] I that there was coming this time and
[1:18:52] when the son of man in his coming would
[1:18:55] be revealed once again as it was in the
[1:18:58] days of Noah as it was in the days of
[1:19:00] lot he announced the same Resurrection
[1:19:03] sign that would be among us is that
[1:19:06] right so it wasn't just healings yet
[1:19:09] healings were prominent yet Miracles and
[1:19:12] signs and wonders and my goodness the
[1:19:14] signs and wonders that were done but you
[1:19:17] realize that there was a voice that came
[1:19:20] with these signs and wonders there was a
[1:19:23] voice that was to call us away and point
[1:19:26] us to the one who is doing the things
[1:19:29] that we see being done it was to call us
[1:19:32] out of organizationalism call us out of
[1:19:36] our own ideas and call us into the place
[1:19:39] of the land of promise is that right now
[1:19:42] to think of it brother Rand would say it
[1:19:43] just like this I don't have the quote up
[1:19:45] there but to thank God would speak this
[1:19:47] in the message I've heard but now I see
[1:19:49] he said to think of it you're looking at
[1:19:51] it with your own eyes The Living Word of
[1:19:54] God made manifest the promise of the
[1:19:57] hour in the last days you're looking
[1:20:00] with your own eyes at the Living Word
[1:20:02] interpreted in natural form God Among Us
[1:20:07] God interpreted his word right through a
[1:20:11] prophet and the same God that was
[1:20:13] interpreting right through his Prophet
[1:20:15] is the same God interpreting right
[1:20:17] through his body in this hour
[1:20:20] not just to God we've heard about but I
[1:20:22] have heard but now I see thee
[1:20:26] right so it's a promised word for this
[1:20:29] hour now you notice God has uh brother
[1:20:33] Brown would talk about this of gifts
[1:20:35] that God would place in the church and
[1:20:37] how you know God sets the gift it's not
[1:20:40] a man that aspires you know to uh you
[1:20:43] know to go and do something and he might
[1:20:45] be ever so inspired to do this or that
[1:20:48] but he may not be qualified and it may
[1:20:50] not be what God has him has for him to
[1:20:52] do but you see God has those that as
[1:20:55] brother bran puts it that our
[1:20:57] ambassadors of God that are able to go
[1:21:00] into the heavenlies and able to bring
[1:21:02] out their the great unknown Supernatural
[1:21:05] to discern and bring things out that the
[1:21:08] natural mind cannot perceive
[1:21:11] now this is God's grace to you and I and
[1:21:14] he says what it does it brings out the
[1:21:16] mystery of God and foretells things and
[1:21:19] things that has been and things that
[1:21:21] will be let me just say it like this
[1:21:23] just as Elisha stood there that day and
[1:21:25] he could say to gehaza who was all
[1:21:27] troubled that he said there are more
[1:21:30] with us than there are against us
[1:21:33] but gehaza was not able to see that
[1:21:37] right now to tell you the truth
[1:21:39] according to what the prophet said
[1:21:40] Elisha didn't see it either but Elisha
[1:21:42] knew God and knew God was a god of his
[1:21:44] word
[1:21:46] it was a type of an Elisha in this land
[1:21:48] in this day a type of the Bride that
[1:21:51] says I don't have to see it I don't have
[1:21:52] to feel it I've already met him and I
[1:21:54] know he's a god of his word whether I
[1:21:56] see it feel it or not God made the
[1:21:58] promise and I know him he's my God and I
[1:22:01] am his son or daughter
[1:22:04] and Elisha was so confident he said God
[1:22:07] loosen his eyes that he can see what's
[1:22:10] already here
[1:22:11] and remember God didn't bring those
[1:22:13] angels down they were already there and
[1:22:15] that's why the prophet could announce to
[1:22:17] you and I he said to God that always was
[1:22:20] and is he said he's always been here but
[1:22:23] now our eyes have been loosened to see
[1:22:26] him
[1:22:28] ah
[1:22:29] I think of how brother Branham just
[1:22:31] listened to it this morning and brother
[1:22:32] I'm talking about in the message of
[1:22:34] Grace he said you know when they were
[1:22:35] walking on the road doing mess he said
[1:22:37] they had a little bit of an inclination
[1:22:38] that it was him all along
[1:22:40] because there was something that was
[1:22:42] moving and Stern but they didn't know it
[1:22:44] are you with me you see God's a god of
[1:22:46] certainty he works to move from just
[1:22:49] inclinations to maybe souls he works to
[1:22:52] bring certainty in our life and how is
[1:22:54] that certainty brought by the grace of
[1:22:56] God has God Appears and makes himself
[1:22:59] known to you and I aren't you grateful
[1:23:01] for that
[1:23:03] friends that ain't us that makes
[1:23:04] ourselves certain
[1:23:06] it's God it's God revealing himself
[1:23:11] so that comes out of that of the Unseen
[1:23:13] it becomes visible before us now notice
[1:23:16] in Zechariah 4 verse 6 notice how that
[1:23:19] this speaks in this hour and you realize
[1:23:21] that this scripture we I've been reading
[1:23:24] from here just a little bit but I to
[1:23:26] realize that this scripture was not just
[1:23:28] something that was pertaining to that of
[1:23:30] when they returned back to Babylon but
[1:23:32] this scripture was prophetic of the hour
[1:23:34] that we're living in
[1:23:36] where the Temple of almighty God God's
[1:23:39] Dwelling Place would be built back by
[1:23:42] the power of almighty God it could not
[1:23:45] be built on the shifting Sands of man's
[1:23:47] reasoning are you hearing me God did not
[1:23:50] borrow any of man's ideas all right now
[1:23:52] we're going to preach now
[1:23:53] but brother Samuel but brother random he
[1:23:55] pulled from this he pulled from that he
[1:23:57] wasn't pulling from a man
[1:24:00] remember those men had spoke certain
[1:24:02] things
[1:24:03] Larkin and all the rest of them are you
[1:24:05] hearing me now but this ministry of
[1:24:08] Elijah is an assembling of Truth
[1:24:12] Elijah never packed the rocks to the
[1:24:16] mountain
[1:24:16] they were there already
[1:24:18] but somebody had to know how to put them
[1:24:21] in order and the reason he knew how to
[1:24:23] put them in order and where to go is
[1:24:25] because he said after it was all said
[1:24:27] and done I have done all of this
[1:24:29] according to Thy word so in this hour
[1:24:32] where men have proved that and Truth
[1:24:35] here and Truth there it is a time that
[1:24:38] truth itself would be assembled by the
[1:24:41] spirit of Truth himself through the
[1:24:44] ministry of Malachi 4 it would be by the
[1:24:48] spirit of God energizing that word that
[1:24:51] would energize the hearts of the
[1:24:52] believer with Rapture and Grace
[1:24:55] are you with me
[1:24:57] Zechariah 4 I'm talking about the real
[1:25:00] reality of Grace Zechariah 4 6. then he
[1:25:03] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:25:05] is the word of the Lord and desirable
[1:25:06] memory he's looking at the seven golden
[1:25:08] candlesticks and he said this is the
[1:25:10] word of the Lord unto zerubbabel
[1:25:12] according to the according to the Lord
[1:25:14] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:25:19] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts
[1:25:23] I won't ask you to try but how many of
[1:25:25] us have tried to do things on our own
[1:25:29] come on now made a lot of made a lot of
[1:25:32] promises let me just tell you something
[1:25:34] there ain't no promise that you can keep
[1:25:36] on your own
[1:25:39] you know are you hearing me
[1:25:41] you got it has got to be one that comes
[1:25:44] and gives you the absolute strength to
[1:25:47] keep his word
[1:25:49] and the way that that comes is thereby
[1:25:52] being obedient to his word
[1:25:56] is that right
[1:25:58] God gives us Grace for that right there
[1:26:00] now Zechariah 4 7 who art thou old great
[1:26:03] Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt
[1:26:06] become a plane and he shall bring forth
[1:26:09] the hedged on thereof with shoutings
[1:26:11] crying Grace Grace unto it
[1:26:15] now I want you to know the very
[1:26:17] important the prophet would continue to
[1:26:19] emphasize this in in the message of
[1:26:21] Grace and say to notice it's not the
[1:26:24] Cornerstone he's bringing forth the
[1:26:26] headstone
[1:26:28] it's the time that we're living in
[1:26:31] it's the capping off it's the finishing
[1:26:34] of the mystery of God now I want to dive
[1:26:37] into this here just a moment crying
[1:26:39] Grace Grace unto it now brother Adam
[1:26:42] says it like this he says now according
[1:26:44] to the prophecy there will come The
[1:26:46] Headstone and he said I want you to
[1:26:48] notice that when The Headstone comes the
[1:26:51] prince that's going to cry out the
[1:26:53] message will cry Grace Grace
[1:26:58] so that's what the message is Grace
[1:27:01] Grace
[1:27:02] for it's by grace are we saved that none
[1:27:06] of Works lest any man should boast and
[1:27:09] the message of Grace listen this now has
[1:27:11] been tramped under the feet of men until
[1:27:15] it's become a disgrace
[1:27:18] come on Friends
[1:27:20] some of them runs out into eternal
[1:27:23] security some runs out into everything
[1:27:25] else but the true message of Grace
[1:27:28] Remains the Same and that's where Satan
[1:27:31] tries to knock it out from the church
[1:27:33] but it's the grace of God that we're all
[1:27:35] saved by now watch how he takes this
[1:27:38] turn now so in the deity of Jesus Christ
[1:27:41] if the Lord God would come there and
[1:27:44] confirm that that is the truth and not
[1:27:46] only that he's talking about Divine
[1:27:48] Healing but by his word he confirms it's
[1:27:51] the truth and by signs and wonders he
[1:27:54] confirms us the truth then also Grace is
[1:27:58] the truth you catch what he's saying
[1:28:01] that this message of Divine Healing that
[1:28:04] has been attacked and been criticized
[1:28:06] you know how many times you stand there
[1:28:08] and the prophet standing and here over
[1:28:10] and over and again and he says I sense
[1:28:12] that Spirit coming in here and saying
[1:28:14] he's just reading their mind
[1:28:18] and then to have the where others that
[1:28:20] when there have been those that's been
[1:28:22] healed right there in the meeting
[1:28:24] they've had others that have come around
[1:28:26] and say well I don't think they ever had
[1:28:28] a problem in the first place I don't
[1:28:30] think they had this and then there were
[1:28:31] others that remembered there was a man
[1:28:33] who was healed there in the media many
[1:28:35] and there was there was different ones
[1:28:37] that were and then all of a sudden the
[1:28:39] the situation reoccurred in their life
[1:28:42] and then a Critic wanted to rise up and
[1:28:44] say see there's nothing to it and
[1:28:46] brother Brown Listen by the scripture is
[1:28:49] able to point them out that Peter
[1:28:51] himself as long as he kept his eyes on
[1:28:54] the Lord he never sunk and your healing
[1:28:57] itself will hold out as long as your
[1:29:00] confession holds out but you get among
[1:29:03] unbelievers and unbelieving spirits and
[1:29:06] those spirits will work to do what
[1:29:08] destroy what God has brought about in
[1:29:11] your body let me just tell you that's
[1:29:12] why if you're living in sin and in sin
[1:29:15] don't expect to get no better until
[1:29:17] you're ready to forsake sin
[1:29:21] if you ain't ready to forsake sin and
[1:29:24] separate don't expect God to do nothing
[1:29:28] are you hearing me
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:32] I'm telling you friends it's true notice
[1:29:36] see this look at this he confirms it's
[1:29:38] the truth then also Grace is the truth
[1:29:42] then why would anyone criticize and say
[1:29:46] that Grace is wrong that we're saved by
[1:29:50] works
[1:29:51] now remember brother Ramos just told us
[1:29:53] in the opening part of this message here
[1:29:54] that he has been so criticized on
[1:29:57] preaching the message of Grace
[1:30:00] huh and what what Grace is that that
[1:30:03] we're not saved by works
[1:30:06] right
[1:30:07] we are saved let's just let's just read
[1:30:09] through it we are saved by grace and
[1:30:12] that through faith not by works work
[1:30:14] shows that you have been saved so work
[1:30:17] shows that you have been saved but what
[1:30:20] saves you is the grace of God grace
[1:30:23] saves you Grace is what God does for you
[1:30:26] works is what you do for God to show
[1:30:29] appreciation of what God did for you but
[1:30:33] by grace are you saved
[1:30:36] now watch he said some people things
[1:30:38] because I go join a church and put my
[1:30:41] name on the book that's all I have to do
[1:30:43] some people think because I shout that's
[1:30:45] all I got to do others think because I
[1:30:48] speak with tongues that's all I have to
[1:30:49] do now you realize what's happening here
[1:30:51] he's dealing with these doctrines
[1:30:54] so-called of Grace
[1:30:56] put your name on the book
[1:30:58] should get happy enough to shout you've
[1:31:01] got it speak with tongues you've got it
[1:31:03] but that's not the true grace of God
[1:31:06] some things because I got power to heal
[1:31:09] the sick that's all you have to do it's
[1:31:12] not it's the grace of God that saves you
[1:31:15] God's Amazing Grace I cannot trust in
[1:31:19] any merits and some said well there's a
[1:31:22] great man that that man I've heard him
[1:31:23] stand up and do this and I've heard him
[1:31:25] stand up and do that and Paul said in
[1:31:27] First Corinthians 13 though I speak with
[1:31:29] tongue of men and angels though I have
[1:31:31] discernment though I have gifts to feed
[1:31:33] I'll take all my goods to feed the poor
[1:31:35] though I can move mountains with faith
[1:31:37] though I have knowledge to understand
[1:31:39] all things I am nothing till love comes
[1:31:42] in which is Grace God has to do it
[1:31:48] you can do all these things and still be
[1:31:52] lost
[1:31:54] remember there are going to be many that
[1:31:56] will come before him on that day and say
[1:31:57] didn't I and he's going to tell them you
[1:32:01] never receive my grace
[1:32:03] depart from me I never knew you
[1:32:07] they preached in his name cast out
[1:32:09] devils and all those things but you see
[1:32:11] now we're God's Great you see what the
[1:32:14] grace of God comes to do the grace of
[1:32:16] God comes to put us in a place of Surety
[1:32:19] and divine Assurance in the Kingdom of
[1:32:22] almighty God it's Grace that saves you
[1:32:25] God's grace to the human race and
[1:32:27] brother Graham said to think of it I was
[1:32:29] thinking of that Grace immediately after
[1:32:31] that appeared Friday morning just at the
[1:32:33] break of day up there in that field when
[1:32:35] I sat on a log and later and bear and
[1:32:38] tears coming down in my eyes and
[1:32:40] remember this was the second time that
[1:32:41] the squirrels were called into existence
[1:32:43] that's where the three rainbows had come
[1:32:45] saying that you know going into one bowl
[1:32:47] I've done that Jehovah the old is Jesus
[1:32:49] of the new he says oh God Your Grace has
[1:32:52] stooped to save me why did you ever have
[1:32:56] such pity upon a poor illiterate Wretch
[1:32:59] like myself anybody else feel that way
[1:33:02] how did you ever come down to our humble
[1:33:06] little Tabernacle where peace and people
[1:33:09] of little Walk of Life poor have nothing
[1:33:12] in this world and steal your grace is
[1:33:15] spread abroad in our hearts by the holy
[1:33:18] spirit that you heal our sickness and
[1:33:21] save our sins which I corrects this save
[1:33:24] us from our sins rather and make us your
[1:33:27] people and deal with us now I want to
[1:33:30] just just kind of change you just for a
[1:33:32] moment and looking at the effects here
[1:33:34] of the grace of God appearing to us
[1:33:37] because when we recognize this just as
[1:33:41] much as the message of true Grace has
[1:33:44] been attacked Satan also was attacking
[1:33:47] Divine Healing
[1:33:49] right and saying it's nothing and you
[1:33:52] know I I thought about it you know when
[1:33:54] you used to see where even they'd have
[1:33:56] ambulances you know you could you could
[1:33:58] uh you know look at clips and things
[1:34:00] like that in Jack Cole's meetings they
[1:34:01] would have ambulances would bring people
[1:34:03] and deliver them right into those
[1:34:05] meetings
[1:34:07] put them on stretchers try to get and
[1:34:09] try to get a home under the hospital do
[1:34:10] it now
[1:34:13] listen friends I'm not against the
[1:34:15] people but you see the where the climate
[1:34:17] and everything has got to
[1:34:20] are you with everything has gotten you
[1:34:22] wouldn't see that now everything is so
[1:34:24] in there there's not even a reverence
[1:34:26] from the things of God if you find even
[1:34:29] one person that has a little bit of
[1:34:31] reverence for God and I ain't talking
[1:34:32] about some ball player that looks up and
[1:34:34] says Jesus help me make a dunk God don't
[1:34:37] care about dunks and touchdowns
[1:34:40] sorry that's another God that's being
[1:34:42] worshiped
[1:34:44] are you hearing me
[1:34:47] amen that's that Babylonian religion
[1:34:49] that's spread throughout all the Earth
[1:34:51] because he said if I be lifted up I'll
[1:34:53] draw men unto me
[1:34:56] is that right
[1:34:58] so we see that there is there's effects
[1:35:01] of this of Divine Healing when Grace
[1:35:03] appears
[1:35:05] to a person's life when Grace appears
[1:35:07] and it's personal
[1:35:09] it's personal how Grace appears like the
[1:35:11] song We Sing of Amazing Grace
[1:35:15] the hour I first believed it is Grace
[1:35:19] that appeared to you and I and not only
[1:35:22] did it appear but by the grace of God
[1:35:25] you received his appearing I want you to
[1:35:29] watch this even when it looks because
[1:35:30] this word saving it's the same word
[1:35:33] that's used even within healing because
[1:35:35] think of how when the Lord himself would
[1:35:38] say through David that I'm the Lord that
[1:35:40] that that forgiveth all that iniquities
[1:35:42] and healeth all thine diseases remember
[1:35:45] there was the woman who came into
[1:35:47] Simon's house and she made her way and
[1:35:50] began to wash his feet and as she washed
[1:35:53] his feet made her way all the way past
[1:35:55] all of them because she had heard that
[1:35:59] he was there
[1:36:01] all the rest of them were making fun of
[1:36:03] him
[1:36:05] but she went by and she went home and
[1:36:08] gotcha if I could say like this she
[1:36:10] robbed her piggy bank and went and got
[1:36:12] the best one met because she knew who
[1:36:14] was there she was convinced it was the
[1:36:17] grace of God that was appearing what was
[1:36:20] it it was something moving in her heart
[1:36:22] do you realize when the prophet preaches
[1:36:24] that message Jesus keeps all of his
[1:36:27] appointments and it's been said all the
[1:36:30] way through the message the reason that
[1:36:32] Jesus kept that appointment was not
[1:36:34] because of Simon but he kept that
[1:36:36] appointment because he knew she was
[1:36:39] gonna be there
[1:36:42] and the grace of God has kept the
[1:36:45] appointment in his word to this
[1:36:48] generation because he knew you were
[1:36:51] going to be here he kept it for this
[1:36:53] moment knowing you and I would be here
[1:36:55] it's the grace of almighty God
[1:36:58] aren't you glad he ain't like you and I
[1:37:00] that we look at a reminder that comes up
[1:37:02] on the phone and says I got 10 more days
[1:37:04] for it to do move move it to the next
[1:37:06] day uh I don't need to do that today
[1:37:09] we'll move it to next week come on I'm
[1:37:10] not the only one who does that I've got
[1:37:12] other things going on but I'm glad with
[1:37:14] Jesus when he comes to fulfill his word
[1:37:17] it does not matter the situations that
[1:37:20] you're in it doesn't matter what's
[1:37:22] taking place when the grace of God has
[1:37:25] come to appear on the scene at that
[1:37:27] moment God has arranged everything and
[1:37:30] there's not enough Devils that can hold
[1:37:32] her back you realize this woman she had
[1:37:35] many complexes about her life
[1:37:38] she had many complexes about her life
[1:37:42] but in the midst of all that there was
[1:37:44] something beneath all those complexes
[1:37:46] that says I can't get rid of these
[1:37:49] complexes I I myself I can't do it but
[1:37:52] there's one who's there if I can just
[1:37:54] get to him
[1:37:57] Hallelujah here it is I feel it the
[1:37:59] prophet said what it was he said there
[1:38:02] was something pulsating in her she did
[1:38:05] not know how to answer the request she
[1:38:08] was being called to do but she responded
[1:38:12] and God made a way he opened up The
[1:38:15] Fountains of her tear ducts and it
[1:38:17] poured down and she washed his feet
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:22] hallelujah hallelujah she made her way
[1:38:26] through every form of criticism she made
[1:38:28] her way through every scoffer let me
[1:38:30] tell you something it may not be people
[1:38:32] that are critics but you'll have to
[1:38:34] press yourself through every lie that
[1:38:37] the devil has ever said over your life
[1:38:39] everything ever accomplished everything
[1:38:41] he's wanting to bind you back you know
[1:38:44] he's done that because he knows there's
[1:38:46] something about your life and he's
[1:38:48] trying to hold you back from the real
[1:38:50] reality that God has for you what made
[1:38:52] you to hunger for God God put that in
[1:38:55] there
[1:38:56] [Music]
[1:38:59] and he said to the woman Luke 7 50. thy
[1:39:03] faith
[1:39:04] has saved thee go in peace
[1:39:07] that Faith yeah her faith was responding
[1:39:11] to his faith
[1:39:16] he just let go her faith let go
[1:39:18] responded to his faith Luke 18 41
[1:39:21] remember this being attacked it works
[1:39:24] the same way in the grace of God in our
[1:39:26] life Luke 18 41 here comes one who was
[1:39:30] blind remember
[1:39:31] um
[1:39:32] uh
[1:39:34] might switch my mind right now
[1:39:35] Bartimaeus and then asked him he said
[1:39:38] what will thou do in Luke 18 41 what I
[1:39:42] shall do unto thee he said Lord that I
[1:39:45] may receive my sight
[1:39:49] I wonder how many men
[1:39:51] we hadn't seen them but how many people
[1:39:53] has walked by him day after day after
[1:39:56] day after day
[1:39:59] but he heard
[1:40:01] and Faith cometh by hearing
[1:40:04] are you hearing me Faith don't come by
[1:40:06] listening faith comes by hearing
[1:40:09] there's a famine in the land is that
[1:40:12] right and the famine is hearing the word
[1:40:14] of God
[1:40:15] ain't for listening to it we've got
[1:40:17] Tate's books Bibles but it's for hearing
[1:40:20] it
[1:40:21] are you hearing me that's where the
[1:40:23] famine is in the hearing
[1:40:26] are you hearing me now so the hearing
[1:40:28] he's hearing this and what's it doing
[1:40:30] it's pulsating upon his heart for the
[1:40:33] condition that he's in if there's a
[1:40:35] faith that is being built in that hour
[1:40:38] in that moment in that time and notice
[1:40:41] as it's being built Jesus said unto him
[1:40:43] receive thy side thy faith has saved
[1:40:47] thee
[1:40:48] we don't even have a record that Jesus
[1:40:50] laid his hands on him
[1:40:53] the word loosened what was on his life
[1:40:57] we're going to preach now
[1:41:01] the prophet tells us when it comes to
[1:41:04] that of a deaf spirit
[1:41:05] he said when it comes to that of a of a
[1:41:07] blind when one's blind he said what it
[1:41:10] is he said it's a spirit like a
[1:41:12] transparent band that's upon that nerve
[1:41:16] and what it is it's squeezing it off
[1:41:19] it's a spirit
[1:41:23] is that right
[1:41:24] but you see God comes along and he's
[1:41:27] addressing the problem
[1:41:30] true
[1:41:31] he's speaking receive thy sight and as
[1:41:35] that word his Faith's already been has
[1:41:37] been built but now it responds into that
[1:41:40] place receive thy sight when that is
[1:41:43] spoken and it is received that Spirit
[1:41:46] loses its hold upon his life his seeing
[1:41:50] comes open can't you see it's a spirit
[1:41:52] that would want to keep you back from
[1:41:54] receiving the Holy Ghost it's a spirit
[1:41:56] that would want to keep you back from
[1:41:58] receiving your real Deliverance it's a
[1:42:01] spirit
[1:42:04] it's like that woman that was there in
[1:42:06] that um
[1:42:08] Institution brother Brandon walked into
[1:42:10] that mental institution he came in to
[1:42:13] pray for people
[1:42:14] and here stands here stands a woman a
[1:42:17] woman constructs right here brother

[1:42:30] and here's what she says
[1:42:32] start with me
[1:42:35] start with me
[1:42:37] oh yeah

[1:42:41] where things had happened at a very
[1:42:42] young age taking advantage of and things
[1:42:44] been look what it did it just continued
[1:42:46] to build Upon Our Life build Upon Our

[1:42:50] was try to Rob value tried to take
[1:42:52] purpose try to Rob all of these things
[1:42:54] and moving on down the line to where
[1:42:56] eventually here she was sitting in this
[1:42:58] kind of a condition and brother brother
[1:43:00] Brown speaks to her and she said you
[1:43:02] know there's been many times where she's
[1:43:04] been told by people well you just need
[1:43:05] to do this and you just need to do that
[1:43:07] and you just need to do that and brother
[1:43:08] Bram told her he said sister he said

[1:43:28] are you hearing me
[1:43:30] that's the same way it was with that of

[1:44:38] of different ones right now that deal

[1:44:42] other assemblies and they're standing
[1:44:43] right there on the promise of God
[1:44:45] they're not defeated they're standing on
[1:44:47] the promise of almighty God are you
[1:44:49] hearing me now it ain't because they
[1:44:51] don't got faith it ain't because they're
[1:44:53] weak some situations friend where
[1:44:55] there's people that are standing there
[1:44:56] and they're looking to God and let me
[1:44:58] just tell you something God is a
[1:45:01] Waymaker
[1:45:05] yes sir
[1:45:08] didn't talk to a brother here not too
[1:45:10] long ago some time ago and he said you
[1:45:11] know God is making a way from my wife I
[1:45:14] said amen don't ever let go of that
[1:45:16] promise you keep confessing that promise
[1:45:20] remember when brother Berry preached
[1:45:21] that message feeling all alone
[1:45:23] when Elijah got down in that situation
[1:45:25] he said God never came down and told
[1:45:27] Elijah snap out of it buddy right
[1:45:31] right that's words of encouragement
[1:45:33] snap out of it buddy
[1:45:37] got quiet now
[1:45:40] don't worry when you have times that you
[1:45:42] need to snap out of maybe somebody'll
[1:45:44] say won't you snap out of that bed
[1:45:46] snap out of this and snap out of that
[1:45:48] you understand we're not dealing with
[1:45:49] DNA
[1:45:51] it's the grace of almighty God
[1:45:53] but God came down and remember he sent
[1:45:56] the angel with the softest hands got the
[1:45:59] best cook
[1:46:01] to do what nourish his servant
[1:46:05] and what I'm saying no matter what
[1:46:07] condition it is don't ever hang that
[1:46:09] sign on your door this is what I'm
[1:46:11] saying don't let it become the
[1:46:13] predominant of the conversation
[1:46:18] I'm and this there is afflicting my body
[1:46:21] but by his stripes I am healed
[1:46:24] this is going on but by his stripes I am
[1:46:27] healed
[1:46:28] is that right
[1:46:30] oh my by faith hath saved thee and
[1:46:33] immediately he received his sight and
[1:46:35] followed him glorifying God and all the
[1:46:38] people when they saw it gave praise unto
[1:46:40] God now think of this woman who had an
[1:46:42] issue of blood I my you know I could go
[1:46:44] through many examples and she said in
[1:46:46] her heart in Matthew 9 21 if I may but
[1:46:50] touch His Garment I shall be saved or
[1:46:55] the word whole
[1:46:57] Jesus turned about and when he saw her
[1:46:59] he said daughter be of good Comfort thy
[1:47:03] faith hath made the whole and the woman
[1:47:07] was made whole from that hour
[1:47:12] bring us to that place
[1:47:15] brother Brown in The Sixth Seal
[1:47:18] as he's talking and he's giving
[1:47:21] rehearsing of that land over there
[1:47:24] and we saw hope and
[1:47:26] he saw those that went beyond the
[1:47:28] curtain of time and he's rehearsing that
[1:47:29] as he's standing at the end of The Sixth
[1:47:31] Seal
[1:47:32] and after he gives that testimony
[1:47:35] and he's speaking about that of what he
[1:47:37] saw on the other side
[1:47:39] there's a sister sitting there that's in
[1:47:42] need of healing
[1:47:44] and brother Brown they sing a little
[1:47:46] song where the brain goes right into a
[1:47:47] little song
[1:47:48] and then he speaks to this sister and
[1:47:50] it's going to break in on it in The
[1:47:52] Sixth Seal he says now see how much
[1:47:54] better it is amen that's it go and be
[1:47:58] well amen the grace of God has appeared
[1:48:03] to you to make you well
[1:48:07] talking about the other side
[1:48:10] that's perfect healing
[1:48:13] and look at the effect of the grace of
[1:48:15] God appearing
[1:48:17] to that little lady who is in need of
[1:48:20] healing in her body so healing in our
[1:48:23] body is God's grace appearing to you and
[1:48:26] I it was God's grace that appeared to
[1:48:29] Legion it was God's grace that appeared
[1:48:32] to the ten lepers nine of them left but
[1:48:36] one came back and said thank you
[1:48:39] is that right so here it's God's
[1:48:42] unmerited grace
[1:48:45] and I just let me just try to my you
[1:48:47] know time just just gets right away from
[1:48:49] us
[1:48:50] but you know when brother Brown is
[1:48:51] talking about this with healing
[1:48:54] he talks about for a born-again child of
[1:48:56] God
[1:48:57] he said when death I want to just read
[1:48:59] this Redemption and completeness in joy
[1:49:02] he said to every believer Born Again
[1:49:04] child of God when death comes stealing
[1:49:07] to the door prematurely the angel of God
[1:49:10] stands between you and the sickness
[1:49:14] now if you want to run on into that
[1:49:17] that's your business
[1:49:18] now you hear me now the angel of gods if
[1:49:22] he wants to if Satan wants to take your
[1:49:24] life prematurely
[1:49:26] here he's coming but the angel of God
[1:49:29] will stand between you and that sickness
[1:49:33] talking about premature now if you want
[1:49:36] to run on to that talking about run on
[1:49:38] into that that that sickness that's your
[1:49:41] business but you don't have to he's
[1:49:44] standing between you and death
[1:49:47] do you understand it is a choice that's
[1:49:49] given
[1:49:50] you don't have to run on into that
[1:49:52] sickness now he said 23 years ago in the
[1:49:55] Jewish Hospital Dr Morris Fletcher gave
[1:49:58] me three hours one of the best surgeons
[1:50:00] here in the city gave me three hours to
[1:50:02] live and I'm living tonight oh he said
[1:50:04] why by unmerited Grace the angel of God
[1:50:09] stood between me and death to protect me
[1:50:12] and I accepted it and in gratitude by
[1:50:16] God's grace I want a half a million
[1:50:18] souls to him tonight
[1:50:23] see it's a choice you don't have to go
[1:50:26] that route the same way it is with
[1:50:28] healing it's the same way it is with sin
[1:50:31] it's the same way with any situation
[1:50:33] whether it's sickness or whatever you
[1:50:35] don't have to go that way
[1:50:38] let me just tell you something what
[1:50:40] about those that with cancer that here
[1:50:43] that they went on home to be with the
[1:50:45] Lord they didn't lose the fight against
[1:50:46] cancer
[1:50:49] are you hearing me
[1:50:51] stood stood Toe to Toe and tenacious
[1:50:54] even to the last moments maybe of their
[1:50:56] last breathing but they didn't lose the
[1:50:58] battle
[1:50:59] God wasn't weak in that case they
[1:51:02] received their healing they received it
[1:51:04] on the other side
[1:51:07] God is Not defeated
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:10] because there's nothing listen now
[1:51:12] balance out with that quote there's
[1:51:14] nothing going to take you out of here
[1:51:16] until God's purpose has been served
[1:51:19] and if the enemy shows up you say how do
[1:51:22] I know if this is premature or not faith
[1:51:24] will always find the perfect will of God
[1:51:27] and move in it
[1:51:29] is that right
[1:51:31] but in the meantime I'm not accepting
[1:51:33] anything and we don't ever have to
[1:51:35] accept anything as being that this is
[1:51:38] the way that it's going to be from now
[1:51:40] on we have promises in God's word and
[1:51:45] Grace has appeared to us to make these
[1:51:48] things real
[1:51:50] oh my don't you love him
[1:51:53] oh blessed be the name of the Lord could
[1:51:56] I have just a few more moments
[1:51:58] let me just drop this in here Ephesians
[1:52:01] 2 8 for by grace are you saved through
[1:52:05] faith and that not of yourselves it is
[1:52:09] the gift of God
[1:52:11] not of Works lest any man should boast
[1:52:16] I know that's that's a very I love that
[1:52:19] scripture but it's a very scripture that
[1:52:21] sometimes you can hear from individuals
[1:52:23] they're going completely the opposite
[1:52:24] way well it's not of Works no no that's
[1:52:26] not what it's saying
[1:52:28] just as it was with the woman that had
[1:52:30] the issue of blood the lepers blind
[1:52:33] Bartimaeus and the rest thy faith save
[1:52:36] thee
[1:52:37] their faith recognized his presence
[1:52:41] and when you recognize his presence it
[1:52:44] releases to you
[1:52:46] what you desire in your heart
[1:52:50] so here for by grace are you saved
[1:52:53] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:52:56] it is the gift of God it's God that has
[1:52:59] moved upon your life it's God that moves
[1:53:02] upon your heart not of Works lest any
[1:53:05] man should boast that's why listen
[1:53:07] sometimes you ever get you ever get in
[1:53:08] your ear well you're just getting worked
[1:53:10] up
[1:53:10] you you just you're just getting worked
[1:53:12] up you're just getting all worked up and
[1:53:13] and you you just claiming a promise you
[1:53:15] know that you nearly no you know there
[1:53:17] ain't no way let me tell you something
[1:53:18] God don't work that way
[1:53:24] God don't work that way to come around
[1:53:26] to his people
[1:53:29] and tap them down
[1:53:31] that ain't how God works but it's Satan
[1:53:34] that's wanting to trouble your mind
[1:53:37] because you want to know why the
[1:53:38] promises of God are inherited by faith
[1:53:42] you receive it by faith not by feeling
[1:53:45] but he asks do you believe
[1:53:49] so no matter what the need is do you
[1:53:52] believe so not a Works lest any man
[1:53:54] should boast for we are his workmanship
[1:53:57] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:54:01] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:54:06] should walk in them
[1:54:09] my mama
[1:54:12] I want to keep going but I don't want to
[1:54:14] just I don't want to force anything
[1:54:18] Hallelujah
[1:54:22] let me just read this last statement and
[1:54:24] I'm just gonna we're gonna stop right
[1:54:25] here
[1:54:27] brother Brown is talking in the
[1:54:29] pergamian age and he says for though we
[1:54:31] are saved by grace apart from Works true
[1:54:36] salvation will bring forth works or
[1:54:40] deeds that will please God
[1:54:43] so true salvation will bring forth those
[1:54:46] Works First John 3 7 little children let
[1:54:49] no man deceive you he that doeth or
[1:54:52] worketh righteousness is righteous even
[1:54:54] as he is righteous he's talking about an
[1:54:58] inward work Brianna skip to that to that
[1:55:01] last the next quote there the one says
[1:55:04] the pergaman church age right after that
[1:55:06] let me just stop here on this quote this
[1:55:08] will sum it up
[1:55:10] if a man fears that he might not please
[1:55:13] God
[1:55:15] then let him fulfill the word
[1:55:18] if a man wonders if he will hear those
[1:55:21] words well done good and faithful
[1:55:23] servant let him fulfill the word of God
[1:55:26] in his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:55:30] those words of praise the word of Truth
[1:55:33] was the Criterion then it's the
[1:55:35] Criterion now there isn't another
[1:55:37] standard there isn't another Plumb line
[1:55:40] and as the world is going to be judged
[1:55:42] by one Christ Jesus even so it is going
[1:55:45] to be judged by the word if a man wants
[1:55:48] to know how he is making out let him do
[1:55:50] as James suggested look into the mirror
[1:55:54] of God's word
[1:55:58] so the same God
[1:56:00] that brings
[1:56:03] salvation
[1:56:04] in healing is the same God who brings
[1:56:07] salvation to the soul
[1:56:10] the same God
[1:56:12] that moves down to redeem from all
[1:56:14] iniquity as the same God who purifies
[1:56:17] cleanses
[1:56:19] and God himself brings forth a people
[1:56:23] that are zealous of good works
[1:56:26] not doing something out of a merit
[1:56:30] but doing it out of appreciation
[1:56:33] The Works that are done is because of
[1:56:36] something inwardly that has taken place
[1:56:39] because in each of these cases of
[1:56:42] sickness in the natural when sicknesses
[1:56:45] you're healed of one sickness
[1:56:49] it may be another sickness that'll come
[1:56:51] later on because these bodies are still
[1:56:53] sin
[1:56:54] but it's still an Evidence
[1:56:57] of Resurrection
[1:57:00] but it's something that God is pointing
[1:57:02] to deeper it points down into the depths
[1:57:05] of our soul
[1:57:07] that there's a God
[1:57:08] that comes right Among Us the grace of
[1:57:10] God to bring about a real change in a
[1:57:14] person's life
[1:57:15] that takes a hold of that life and
[1:57:17] transforms it by his Amazing Grace
[1:57:21] what do I do receive it you receive that
[1:57:25] Grace for every need that you have in
[1:57:28] your life it's important to receive that
[1:57:30] Grace now look you and I both know
[1:57:33] if there was something that I had and
[1:57:35] you wanted
[1:57:36] you wouldn't just walk out of the door
[1:57:38] you would make your way to receive it
[1:57:43] right so to receive it is to acknowledge
[1:57:45] Him that's extending that grace to you
[1:57:50] to know that the same God for whether
[1:57:52] it's healing in your body this morning
[1:57:53] healing in your soul healing in your
[1:57:56] mind healing in your spirit I am the
[1:57:58] Lord that healeth all right
[1:58:01] it's the grace of almighty God what do I
[1:58:04] do first right even in your heart if
[1:58:06] there's things that's there Lord I walk
[1:58:08] away from within my heart to separate
[1:58:11] from sin and to walk fully in his
[1:58:15] presence
[1:58:16] if there's something that's there that
[1:58:18] that seems to be plaguing hold your
[1:58:20] confession of God's promise and God's
[1:58:23] word and walk forward with him
[1:58:28] let's pray
[1:58:31] Lord Jesus
