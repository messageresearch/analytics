just just speak speak to newly and just to share the gospel of jesus christ and god's desire and his pardoning grace and so his desire he said i want to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and um so we we just we just want to pray for our brother god will just also be with him so good to see each and every one of you and um sometimes we um well i just i just i just love seeing you and i know it's a sacrifice and the sacrifice that's made and we just we're just looking to the lord because i know you didn't come to see me you know you may love me and i hope you love me but i i hope you love him more because if you love him more then you'll love me the right way amen so we just let's turn to the word of the lord a song of solomon chapter eight and verse five and i just want to read these through verses of scripture just on this past monday morning i just just as i just was waking up that just these scriptures just moved right into my heart just and the prince of god just just came right there in the bedroom just just as i was awakening and these scriptures i just want to just how god would express it and i always trust my prayer is this lord help me that i can express it the way that you brought it to me if you'll just deliver it that way you know in prayer and that's always the desire is lord just let me get out of the way the way you brought it so here is the scripture verse five who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved this is speaking of the bride i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought before there she brought thee forth that bear thee set me this is the from the bridegroom set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm so this is the request set me as a seal as remember what a seal is it's a finished work it's it signifies that one belongs to another and upon thine arm thy strength let me be the strength of your life for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath the most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love so if you can't quench it neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be content in other words despise not even not even coming close to being equal for love if a man would give all of his substance for love amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated truly the love of god when we to think of it there's no way that in our in a person in our natural mind that we could ever be able to fully um within our minds be able to comprehend the love of god but it but the love of god is meant to be that which is captured not with our mind but with our heart to think that when as the scripture would would express this here of the greatness of love now you know love itself is a very it's a very powerful force brother branham would say it in this way he would say it's the most powerful force there is on earth because he gives the examples of how that love that he says you could see how that a mother would actually move right through flames of fire in order to rescue her child i never forget one time we were as a family we were on vacation and we were there i was i was there with the boys and we were just we were just kind of just swimming around there and here i think it was benjamin if i'm not mistaken we weren't even in really deep water but but benjamin wasn't as tall as he is now but you know and i was right there with the boys and and all of a sudden in the moment it's my wife turn she turned around and here benjamin he's just kind of bobbing a little bit there was nothing her shoes came off in record breaking time she jumped in closing off and she fit i mean it was though as he was in the middle of the pool she went from the edge completely to the middle it's like she walked on water but what did that it was love she saw that her child was in need and it drove her to that she didn't think about whoa what if this this dress gets ruined and chlorine and everything didn't even think about that didn't even come into the picture love is such a very it's the most powerful force to think of it that in that regards that when we're looking at it that's a filial love that's a love that a mother would have for children it's a love that between husband and wife of filial love and that's a very very tremendous uh very tremendous thing because love itself love must be projected if if love is not projected then then there could be nothing come forth from it you know the bible says in order for you to have friends you must show yourself friendly and if you know how it is is once in a while with your husband and wife or children it is very it is very good to express our love now when we we could go through that in many ways but you see love is is not meant is meant to be expressed it's projected but there's a desire within that projection to think that you know where the love would be uh projected you know uh to husband and wife and and to that of a family but yet here god's own love as we are looking at this that his love projected it into the world it produced a savior when love love being projected then it allowed grace to step in and grace to actually bring into reality what love had projected in love itself there's nothing that nothing more strong than love to think of it love itself will make you trust amen love will make you trust real love brings real trust and love itself let me say this love is a risk it's a risk it's nothing that that that that it's something we say well i'm going to get it all on paper and i'm going to have this all wrote out that's not love but love it but it's worth the risk it's worth the risk to think of it that god when god himself become one of us now this was not a haphazard plan god came himself it was the love of god that brought him down to the earth to become one of us in order to redeem you and i and give us the life that we had before the fall it was love that constrained him to do it and how that he himself would adorn even the robe of humanity and to to feel even the temptation to feel what it was to be frustrated to feel what it was to be sick in all of that he he took upon in order that he might be the right kind of a high priest for you and i that he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities to where when we and ourselves would get weak he's there to minister on our behalf to minister strength and encouragement to our lives and so this this love is just as so powerful it brings about of a real of a real trust and you know when you think about it you know brother branham would say it in this way says you know there's things where he says you can belong to a great church and he says you might be a charter member in that church and yet just being a member you would do things that you normally would not do or that you would not do if you belong somewhere he said to a church he said and you have the love of god in your heart you see what makes a person different what is it that makes a christian a christian is the love of god that has come into their heart and this is where jesus what he would say in john 15 9 here he is speaking to the disciples and he says as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue continue ye in my love so it's to abide to remain to tarry so to walk within this love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love so god's love is directly tied to his life to his word and as we as keeping those the commandments of the word and listen i don't want you to think this morning if you think commandments are just a written code of rules you're missing the commandments is that there's a divine expression it's god's word that is coming forth to minister to our hearts to lead us and to guide us and he says if you will keep my commandments now remember this is something that it's up to you and i he's speaking to the disciples well before the holy ghost has come but he's giving them what is absolutely not just them but for you and i what is absolutely necessary in order to walk into the baptism of the holy ghost where the love of god is shed abroad in your heart and it's also the same reality of how that we are to serve god live for god be pleasing to the lord and that is that the word as the word is coming when the desire in our hearts should be god let me be a sponge lord to that word let it be an absorption lord in my life because he's not talking about us keeping it here we could keep it here but god let the life of the word let it so pass into my life let it change me let it transform my life when i'm here i'm hearing the word let it be that life that's coming that's just so penetrating beyond everything lord and having preeminence in my life that's keeping the commandments is ourselves just giving ourselves to him and in doing that he says eve you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love so this the love of god is god making known his word are you with me so god's god making known his word is his love now there's times god makes it on his word and it'll cut and there's other times but it's not always cutting god doesn't delight it in all his cutting but there's other parts how the word is coming it's there because the bible says instruction in righteousness it comes to uh guidance and directness so as we would take that word remember when jesus was here he says the father loveth the son and showeth him all things is that right so the word coming to you and i the word being spoken to our hearts that is the love of god being expressed to you and i and you might sit here and say how do i know that he loves me is he speaking to you if he's speaking to you that's him letting you know he loves you see it's god by his word speaking to our hearts now notice he says these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full now the bible says the fear of the lord is the is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise and do it forevermore revelations 22 14 says blessed are they that do his commandments so it's not just as we're hearing it but there must be a hearing but it's yielding to what we're hearing yielding to that voice and god is not asking you and i to make it happen he's only asking you and i as we read in the beginning set me as a seal he's asking you and i give me my place give me place in your life give me that place that belongs to me and let me just tell you as a believer that never ever stops the word itself is finding its place within our life it's a word to where the word you know the bible says in meekness you know the very word meekness it means to give place to one and the bible said moses was the meekest man in all the world in all the earth why he gave the rightful place to the word in his life it brings out a real meekness because we are not trying to put him there we give him his rightful place so blessed are they that do his commandments remember when jesus stood in acts 1 he spoke to the disciples after his resurrection he was there with them commanding them many things for 40 days he was giving order giving direction to their life and the last words that he spoke before he ascended the bible says he commanded them that they go to jerusalem and be endued with power from on high this is what the word spoke to them because this is now where now the word itself and you now become one so notice they had to receive that if if they hadn't received it they'd have never been in the upper room are you with me if they never had if they hadn't have sin received that word they would have never been in the upper room but showing they had received the word they went to the upper room are you with me now brother branham tells us like this he says when you take that seed word into your heart and then you walk into the holiest of holies it'll bring forth shoe bread manna this is why listen to me not just in the new birth but even after you've been born again there's times you're setting you're hearing the word you're listening to it and it might seem like oh i don't seem like i'm grasping at all i don't seem like i'm grasping at all but if you're open to that word you're yielding to that word let me remind you the word of god is a seed and in that seed it has transforming power it has the authority to become what he spoke it you say what do i do take it in his heart take it in your heart and then as you come into his presence you watch and his presence doesn't mean that you necessarily have to be right here on a thursday or a sunday right in service but you're taking that word in let me tell you you are a priest unto god you can be walking right down the middle of the store walking right out in your lawn and you're there in the presence of almighty god because it's him that's there and about that time that seed word you've taken in it ripens in his presence because his presence brings his faith his presence his life so we want to take the word in our hearts david said i hid it in my heart jesus said in john 17. this is his request father i will that they also whom thou has given me notice has given me he's not just speaking of the disciples who's there but all that has been given him from before the foundation of the world jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them remember when he walked when he came out they were walking on the road to emmaus in luke 24. they were sad they were they were just we thought he was the one we thought he was the one that should have redeemed israel they missed and they were at that time not revealed to them the need for suffering you see it was it they could not continue in the same life they were in that same life they were in peter walked with him and then peter peter backslid is that right and peter rejected him so they so there was a need for a fulfillment there was a need for that life to come that would bring stability that peter alone could not give to himself nor the rest of the disciples there had to be a clarity a revelation of who he was and the work of redemption so it would stabilize them and give them a confidence in the promise that god had for them and then when god himself would so transmit his life in them it would produce a courage it would produce a confidence it would produce a trust let me tell you what kind of trust it produced it produced a trust to where when god said something in his word they just believed it because god said it they didn't need proof of it god said it i believe it that settles it when paul was getting ready and they thought it was they thought they were going to be sunk there one when he was going to rome but he said the angel of the lord whose servant i am he stood before me this night and he begins to rehearse these things and he said be of good cheer there shall not be a man lost but that he would abide in the ship let me tell you they they operated on a trust and a confidence because they knew who he was they themselves were witnesses of the power and authority let me tell you something what would put them out there to where they would preach the gospel that way they would they dared they went out there and they they stood there in the face of the enemy and declared the reality of jesus christ let me tell you what i'll do that the same thing that it does inside of you when you stand there day after day right in the midst of satan's eating and you stand there it's not you living that life it's christ inside of you hallelujah that this same love where you have loved me that this same love may be in them and i in them remember jesus said saturn was moments ago he said the father loveth me and he showeth me these things jesus goes on to say the father loveth me because i lay my life down now think of this listen jesus was not meriting the love of god but the love of god was so preeminent in this in this vessel this predestinated seed of god are you with me it was so preeminent in his life to where god was made visible the invisible god was made visible through his life it was god speaking to him and him yielding to the voice of god and as he would go forth he would go walking that word that was being fulfilled it was the father that dwelt in him that was fulfilling the word but he had to yield to the voice he yield to what he was being shown and he walked in obedience to that word and that word was fulfilled even where jesus could say i have power to lay my life down he said this is the very thing that the father he loveth before you know what the laying down it's more than just you say well there was there at calvary look every moment of his life it was a laying down every part of his life was yielding laying down laying down when they wanted him to go to the tomb of lazarus come on your buddy he's sick he's he's past he's close to death come on this is your buddy they were trying to pull him and no doubt he felt the temptation in the gate of affection out here in his spirit but down on the inside the love of god would stand there upon god's word and god's word alone and he waited until he had the leadership of the holy ghost on what to do in that moment what was he doing laying down his life he laid down his will he had a right for many things he had a right to be married he had a right for all that but he said father i sanctify myself for their sake so this life being laid down it had nothing to do of a selfish motive but it had everything to do for that of his brethren for the family of god for the word of god same love so it calls us to the same thing first john 4 verse 14 here the scripture says we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world i want you to just pay pay close attention these words we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god now we know this confession this has got to be something that's just deeper than just the mouth but it's got to be something to where there's a life behind it that confesses that jesus christ is the lord it comes from seeing and testifying and believing and now it's a life that confesses what they have saw what they have come in contact with and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us oh my this is personal amen we have known that means had an experience known we've we've had an experience and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him the bible says in verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us i'm just going to move here for sake of time on some things and maybe god will help us to come back in a different time but look at it how that paul would bring this here in ephesians 5 ephesians 5 verse 1 paul said be therefore followers that means imitators we know what it means to be an imitator is that right it means you you are watching somebody you can see them you can't if you don't see them you can't imitate him is that right but when you see him then you can imitate him so this is how paul said this is how how you're to be a follower of god followers of god imitators as dear children what's a child doing a child's doing everything daddy does daddy daddy does this i mean daddy's got the axe it's got its little little tights axe you know or or mama's broom handle something it imitates are you with me amen now notice this and walk in love has christ hath loved us to walk our life to be regulated and hath given himself oh glory for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweet smelling savior so our life walking with him yielding our life to him giving over to him notice brother brown would say it like this let me refer to this he says now if you're believing right i want you to hold on to this thought if you're believing right if you just confess it with your lips it won't do much good but from your heart i mean you know the scripture says if a man a man believeth from the heart unto righteousness is that right so it's god the very first work it's god working on that heart amen and sometimes that work on the heart is not something that you all together see i'm talking about even out for our lives and what we have experienced you don't all together whether it's children or whoever it may be you don't all together see that sometimes maybe a loved one somebody you're praying for and it might seem like man i don't think like anything's taking place but remember here remember when we're looking at this god deals with the heart first if god dealt with the body as just as far as just the body and the mind you can have somebody coming in the body and in the mind and their hearts not in it but god before the prodigal ever came home before he ever made one step out of the pigpen are you hearing me his heart was being turned daddy didn't know it mama didn't know it but his heart was being turned why because there was a father and a mother who were praying for him and the prophet said the angel of god went to the pigpen that night that's why i'm telling you to turn the heart if you find yourself my heart beginning to turn beginning to open there's things that you find that my goodness brother samuel you would have never found me here you would have never thought that let me just let you know that's not a work of flesh and blood that's a supernatural work of the same angel of the lord that's on earth tonight he's the one dealing with your life hallelujah amen glory be to god but if from your heart you believe that jesus is the son of god you can't live the same life you once lived you can't if you ever get a true view of calvary how many is thankful for a true view of calvary if you're just taking some haphazard way or just you're just fooling yourself but when you really get a view of what jesus was oh he said how i'd like to preach the supreme deity of jesus christ if you could ever realize who he was and what he did for you he did it all you say what do i have to do yield believe it accept it he did it oh your hearts notice your hearts would rend within you and you'd be willing to throw away the trash of the world to live for him notice getting a view of him will do what caused the trash to be thrown aside because there's something so much greater and you're i'm asked to give up this for this no problem it's not even in comparison on the scales oh he says how marvelous what a person if you realize the condescending of god himself unfolding himself coming down till he could get in your heart now when we look here in romans 6 and as we get ready to look at this here in romans 6. brother i'm taking it at the very end of the message the token there in jeffersonville brother brown begins to guide the people as they're standing there he says that those who said you want to receive this token and he's he's giving them guidance of what to say even in that moment and it's a pouring out of their heart it's just simply being very honest before god let me just let me see if i can find it here so i can read it to you i referred to it and i don't have it right there in front of me is that okay listen what he says listen here's the simplicity of it he said this is what you say lord jesus right now just take all that's in me that's unlike you let me move all my pride all that's in me out all the trash all the unbelief that's in me i discard it now lord i just kick it out and let the sweet holy spirit of god like a dove move down in me i want to live eternally lord and i want you to help me at this time grant it now brother branham goes on to say in this portion here and he says he says now he says that love and he deals with what love is right after he's made that statement he said see love love love him see what he's done for you it's by love love brings obedience you can have the most severe case of rebellion on your hand i've had many times where you know and i don't want to get too much into that but as a person they could you know i've had different times they're standing counsel and i can say well this is the standard and this is where the standard will be in your home but if you're going to hold that you hold that standard and you should but you need to make sure that you've got a firm relationship because because commandments with that relationship becomes rules without love it becomes do's and don'ts whereas when love when the relationship is strong even in the things that that that a person with teenage one or more that may not want to do but if love is there love brings respect are you hearing me love brings respect love itself will conquer that amen hey you and me are living examples you say brother samuel i've already been born again but yet you still pack we still pack around that old sticky carnal nature there's sometimes when the word goes to dealing with our life and here we are i don't know and but yet what does god do god his love is so strong to our hearts and to our lives what does it do it causes us to relinquish even where we think i got a right to feel this way they shouldn't have done this to me or this shouldn't but love the love of god will cause you to relinquish even feelings so love brings obedience notice here in romans 6 16 paul is speaking here to the believers he says know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so he's dealing with a choice let me just let me just remind you every one of us have this choice when paul deals with in this chapter these scriptures it we're not only looking at it leading into the new birth but you're also looking at it these are instruments these instruments that are here just like you know this mask this mask itself is no more than just an instrument the microphone itself is no more than just a tool that tool has got to be picked up and it's put in the hand of one so here paul is dealing with that our lives are instruments and he says you you yield yourselves servants to obey hit that his servants ye are to whom you obey so you're yielding to somebody you're yielding to somebody you're not neutral you're yielding to someone to yield this word yield means to present oneself on the side of one it means to actually place yourself beside one and say i stand with this that's what yielding does it's that i i stand with this how in obedience so yielding and obedience goes hand in hand i know a lot of times we think oh my that's you know that's so elementary but remember obedience god prefers obedience better than any sacrifice obedience itself is a part as a condition that takes place inside the heart of an individual of submission that's what this word it actually refers to a submission now notice what paul would write of this and say but god be faint that ye were the servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you now notice obeyed from the heart so we can hear the word hear the word hear the word but it won't do us any good if we're not receiving it we have to receive the word i think of it brother adam was just texted some brothers and we looked at this here was here was a statement that brother brown makes here in the message after the spirit of the lord calls a man out and says uh this and this and this is wrong with you uh mr so-and-so or don't receive it receive it while it's here and he says oh you're not going to receive it he said watch he'll prove he's the one that's here he goes right around and he calls out the spirit of the lord calls out another one he said see sir you missed it god vindicated your healing was right here i tell you friends we do not want to miss it we do not want to miss it you say i don't want to miss the rapture hey i don't want to miss a service i don't want to miss a moment i don't want to miss any moment of any day that i can be in his presence that is a life that says i don't want to miss it i don't want to miss it so to yield is to obey so there is a part and all how we need the help of almighty god and god would help us to be able to actually to be able to grasp the very things that what god is saying and it's not our natural mind to be able to do it but it is god who does it now let me look at this here just one more time but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you this word even as we look at this this form of doctrine this is not a bank of teaching amen it was delivered to you this form of doctrine it deals with an example an in sample something that has been pressed upon when there's been a living image that's come before you a living reality because teaching alone won't change a man it takes the holy ghost to come and he comes through that word and the spirit of god he'll never override our will he won't do it it has to be our yield our will that's yielded to him notice this paul here's what here's the commission think of paul he could tell them you have been obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you now to think of this in acts 26 18 this was the testimony of where paul had received the visitation and his commissioning from god himself this is what this word is to do to open their eyes it's more than just these eyes but it opens the eyes of our heart and to turn from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me when you trace through the scriptures you find paul as he would and just to hone in on paul paul would declare that when he came among the children of god he said this desire was to know nothing among you save jesus christ and him crucified paul would declare that why he says that your faith might stand in the power of god not in the enticing words of man's wisdom so this form of doctrine that is believed that was believed and obeyed from from the heart it was more than just teaching that turned around because teaching can cause a man a man can grasp that up here a man listen if you hear something long enough you can memorize it you can and everything else but you see god his desire is from the heart that's how we really know god let me just say it like this when you when you know god in that way don't worry about his book this is what brother rand told us he said don't you worry about his book the bible he said you get the love of god in your heart and then he said you'll be able to read the word of god and god will speak to your heart or you may not have everything tied together but it's a love letter there are things that are precious to you that you know that where the word itself was a letter but now it's a love letter to you what's happened something's changed amen this message itself is not just something that mom and daddy believe but now it becomes something to you it's given me life it's made jesus christ real to my life it's given me power it's given me strength this is why paul when he would deal with crucify he was not just pointing them back this was not just pointing back to calvary but here it was remember he could also say that jesus christ he said that of the seed the son of david he was raised from the grave according to my gospel so there had to be a crucifying why because the debt had to be paid let me tell you whether you recognize it this morning or not every one of your sins have already been paid for they've already been paid for he made the ultimate decision as a sacrifice for past present and future sin behold the lamb that taketh away the sin of the world he offered up his life willingly a man here then through the crucifixion and now through the resurrection what does he do he comes back to make known to his disciples that i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore he lets him know the debt has been paid he lets him know the promise is sure to you that these promises they are your promises hallelujah so when we look at this here paul in galatians 3 paul said all foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth now remember what happened to the galatians they they were walking by the spirit but then you had some fellas come in that that wanted to move them back to a place of works and paul said as he's dealing with this he'd said many things concerning him he said i'm afraid of your experience because christ is the fulfillment of the law hallelujah notice he says before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you so paul was standing there and he he made known to them who was the one that's been here right before you who's the one that's been here the whole time he's the one that was set before your eyes this was not just words it was the person of jesus christ coming present coming before them he's the one as he said that worked miracles among you he's the one that dealt with your heart paul is letting it be known he's the one who was sat before you as and that word evidently would be like of a of a canvas where a painting was on and paul was letting it be known hey i'm nothing but a blank canvas but jesus christ has revealed this revelation he put in my heart this image is being expressed not a not an image of a church but it's the image of the living god of his word that's being set before you that has an effect notice the scripture says in titus chapter 2 for the grace of god now dealing with this love you see sometimes love itself some of it is just the way it's looked at is that love is so mushy love doesn't have any backbone on it brother said if your wife would got out there and running around with any other any other man and you just said well i ain't going to say nothing to her you know i love her so much he said your love is not right jesus christ his love is right it's correct i can't speak for all these false prophets and false teachers when they want to paint god's love is it just oh god's love just overlooks your sin all you got to do is love god but you've got to love him get the same love that he loved you [Applause] it begins with your love him tapping your heart but it must come to where your life and life is lived according to the same love that the father loved him you say that's impossible i agree i agree i agree i agree with man but with god all things are possible that's why there must come a higher love that which is the true love agape love that will actually bring deliverance this is where paul would express this here for the grace of god that bringeth salvation i want you to watch this now for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men it came present the grace of god it had made itself known teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world aren't you glad this teaching us it deals with chastening us but chastening isn't always about the belt the rod no no no no it's god instructing you and i instructing us in righteousness there's things that you think what about what did brother graham say he said look he's speaking to the pentecostal women he said here you are he said something with short hair he said but he said but what about he said you accused jacqueline kennedy he said what if she'd heard what you've heard maybe she wouldn't do what she's doing are you with me but you see god's mercy listen friends it goes much deeper even than that just a clothing but god deals with every part let me tell you something this teaching is not a series of services this teaching is the literal person of jesus christ coming present brother branham didn't hold a bank of teaching services in africa when those women were sitting there and they were all they were naked are you with me but when the angel of the lord came present they covered their chest and they bathed out of the meeting who did that the angel of the lord the grace of god appeared amen hallelujah bring us salvation deliverance to rescue and he still teaches us the holy ghost is a teacher on the inside he'll lead and guide you into all truth it's not just talking about mysteries and the unfolding of the word but he'll lead you in all truth in your attitudes your actions and everything else to where it's truth because truth is not a doctrine truth is the person of jesus christ you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you create you free [Applause] hallelujah it's truth when you've been born again of the spirit of god now the life you live is a life of truth that's really who you always were there was a lot of darkness that covered your life but truth came the word was speaking to your life and what does it do as the darkness itself is giving way oh my what takes place truth itself comes into manifestation glory be to god teaching us i want you to think of this paul goes on to say looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity so this is a real view of calvary redeem us not just not just forgive us but redeem us so not only forgiven but to where the nature has been changed on the inside to where god looks at you as a son and daughter of god and says you never did it in the first place why because there's a new man on the inside that he might redeem us from all lawlessness iniquity and purify unto unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works that don't stop can you say amen it's a people that we have been redeemed purified zealous of good works zealous of what good works the good works we were foreign to as the word itself is being made known how that there's a desire there's a passion in our heart to please god there's a love there's a desire in our hearts to please god anybody ever felt so tired that you didn't feel like praying go ahead it's all right sure you felt tired you didn't feel like praying i felt so tired that man i you know here you are and you know i don't have nothing else laying before me today maybe you're you're just you're tired you just don't feel like you don't even feel like reading you know you maybe feel like listening to a message are you with me now but down here is something there on the inside now we can't always say that it goes this way but we can say what a victory it is when we can say lord i'm going to anyhow i'm going to override the feelings of this man and i'm going to borrow his knees so that i can pray lord i don't have right now i'm sweet i'm weak in my body i'm tired but i want to tell you i love you i appreciate you lord i'm thankful lord god for the work that you've done lord in my life i'm thankful god for your word that you sent us you know what you go to doing that just a little bit you'll find how many knows that you find that the tiredness just starts fleeing away why you've made a sacrifice to enter into his presence what made that sacrifice there's a love that you gave into you gave into it nobody drove you to it you gave into it because you know if i can just press beyond this feeling if i can just press beyond this he rebukes notice let me read this scripture as many as i love i rebuke and chase him be zealous therefore and repent now when brother brahm takes this scripture he says there's many true he's then dealing with it at the end of the age he said there's many that are true christians that need to repent now don't get quiet on me because there's things when listen to me now when the word has come in this hour god brought a restoration of what was lost i wish i had half i wish i had half of a bottle god did not give us in this age a quarter of a bottle he down to give us a half of a bottle or three quarters but this bottle right now you could look at it and say this bottle is sealed what's that mean you would say here's a full bottle of water the water being a rep being a type of the holy ghost god did not pour out just that of justification just just sanctification just the restoration of the of the gifts and the outpouring of the holy spirit but god has poured his entire self into the church of the living god are you with me it's not just a part of it it's the very fullness of god himself it's christ himself now living in his bride body so with that life as he would chase him he would rebuke he reproves us and this is done with a vision in mind i want you to understand this is not our final home we're promised to him that overcometh will set with me in my throne even as i have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne we're promised that overcoming so there's a word that works and deals with our life it corrects us he instructs us he leads us it's him doing it amen is that right that's his love because so you see love itself i'm trying to get somewhere here love itself it's a discipline love itself of how god works with our lives let me come in let me come here to this scripture here let me come back to this in romans 6 17 but god be thanked that ye were past the servants of sin enslaved to it yes but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you remember the scripture the bible says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready brother brown makes a statement in the message marriage of the lamb it's very fitting he said many people say if god only took this drinking spirit away from me this smoking spirit this immoral spirit this and that he said but you've got something to do the bible says blessed is he that overcometh he that overcometh shall inherit all things now once you listen what he says he says you've got the power to do it are you risking me now you got the power to do it don't believe what the devil is trying to tell you resetting sin don't believe it believe what the word is saying you have power to do it what's the power to do it he says you must be willing to do it that's the power right there is willingness according to the word to say in your heart lord be it unto me according to thy word it's letting is agreeing with that word that's the power the power is there if you're willing that's the power willing to lay it down are you with me i i know a little bit i've prayed with people many different times and the things still continue on you say brother samuel what is that well listen this is not algebra it's willingness to let it down willingness to lay it down that's the power that's given to you the word the word comes it speaks to our hearts to bring us to that place to say yes lord and it's that simple it's there don't let the devil say oh you got to go to somebody you got to go to somebody else and you got to go to somebody else you could have a hundred preachers lay hands on you it's not the preacher that takes it away from you are you with me it ain't the preacher that takes it away from you it's that willingness in your heart you might say what if a person is possessed of a devil if they're willing come on now i'm going to the bible legion himself he had a whole mess of demons on him but he heard jesus was coming to town there wasn't enough devils that could hold him back why he had the power of willingness to say i'm willing i can be free if i can just get to jesus she have made herself ready that's the fear of god obedience to his word amen hallelujah that's given to you and i being then made free from sin he became the servants the slaves bond slave love slave of righteousness you're not bound by fear you could do whatever you want to do see perfect love it's not held i have to do this i must do this if i don't do this that's not perfect love but perfect love says i do it because i love him you're not obeying his word out of fear you're obeying it because you love him let me try to find here a place to close the bible says in second corinthians 7 after these promises have been made known having therefore these promises dearly beloved what was the promises god's desire was to walk inside of his people live in them walk in them he said having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourself from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god you know i love paul was not afraid to take the hand of the believer and put it in the hand of god and say go to it notice let us brethren let us perfecting holiness bringing it to its perfection to a completion and may i say this to you it doesn't stop it doesn't stop it keeps going who wouldn't listen when you think of this the bible says grieve not the spirit of god whereby you're sealed until the day of redemption is that right so to think of it to hold brother bram says if you got a feeling in your heart i got a right to get even he said as soon as you've got that feeling in your heart the holy ghost takes its flight so even our thoughts but to think sometimes how many times that we've held on to thoughts or feelings instead of holding on to him see it's valuing his presence there can be certain tendencies in your life maybe because of strains down through the family but there's something in your heart that realizes i am not going to make excuses i am going to take god's word cleansing myself cleansing yourself yes because you have access to his life first peter 1 22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfaint love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently notice purified your souls how by taking of the word of god by receiving of that word saying yes lord i believe it don't try to reason with it it won't do you no good soon as you try to reason with it you hybridize it it it kills the effect of it right there what should i do just say amen say lord give me a heart that just so completely in line with the word lord a life that says yes lord seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfaint love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever listen to this and i'll close he said now we know drinking and carrying on is sin but the whole thing is because of unbelief all the rest of it's just attributes of one thing unbelievable because if you believe god and jesus christ to be his son you are absolutely not going to do those things he that's born of god does not commit commit means practice from nature practice sin you must believe the whole thing lays in faith jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but already passed from death unto life he says there is nothing else that you can do only believe you know it's given to you to believe it's given to you paul said in the book of philippians it's given to you to believe if you believe notice this this is profound if you believe then them little immoral things will just drop off like that as you believe you become love as you what believe you become love whose love his love his love that's bringing salvation deliverance it rescues you from the slavery of sin glory be to god it brings a rescue in our life from fear it brings deliverance it gives strength to you and i as you believe you become love and love is god and you begin to wind yourself into christ oh i love that it's so simple in it and you begin to wind yourself into christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's just no desire to do it so perfect love it casts out fear perfect love it drives up because what is fear lack of confidence unbelief it drives it out from that life and as the life just begins to wind themselves on into christ letting their heart just just taking in of that word they're winding themselves in him in a love affair and then it isn't something that we're quitting let me tell you something right now if there's any one of you in here could say you quit something then you still got a problem because there's not one of us that quit anything i didn't quit the things that was in my life you didn't quit them you mean you just kept on doing them no his love was so projected i found something that was so much greater like brother jewel said he said i just stopped dancing i just changed partners just got a hold of the real wine the new wine and it brought a real intoxication a real change of life are you with me it it it change it brings a change in but you see what you say what about the quitting it's the willingness to lay it down that willingness does not come from you your strength it comes from his word he gives you the power to lay it down you say lord i lay it down the ramp said see says that worshiper wants purge there's no more conscience or desire of sin when the worshipers purge when he is born again look at this when his old nature dies and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of god a son of god he gets new life by what the love of god it's just think of how love itself how it works we see god has to come he brings correction into our life he guides us he directs us just his presence coming will bring conviction let me tell you something this would help you to help you if you recognize that lord let my life be so affected by your presence it'll bring conviction you won't say things that you ain't supposed to say you won't run people down you won't post things you're not supposed to post are you with me is it not about a church thing it's about the love of god it's about him that's why i'm coming to the house of god we don't just come here and just we don't want to leave out the same way right what's the purpose in coming if we leave out of here the same way so don't let the devil just say well yeah there ain't nothing happened to you but he look just be simple say god if you're here in that condition this morning say lord let my heart be open to you lord i want my heart to be open lord i want you to deal with my heart i want you to speak to my life lord jesus be honest with god say lord i want to be an absorption to this word i want to be changed in my life lord god every one of us every one of us desire more of god every one of us desire more of god you take for example it's just like like in this i'm closing you take for example hear a man and a woman they start to notice one another and this is filial they start to notice one another then they start talking brown tells us in the token he says love brings obedience love brings courtship love brings marriage so they start talking courtship is a time of wooing don't know is this the one i don't know but see all through the time of courtship is a time of repentance it's a time where of of obedience to the word and then it comes to that place of an of where their hearts in that engagement to where their hearts have become one their their hearts are beating together although they're miles apart maybe or houses apart or whatever you see what's happening is a transformation that's taking place think how god's been dealing with our hearts now for months that old nature doesn't die just just where it's just where there's no agreement there's got to be agreements and it comes to that place where it lines up with god's word and then god takes care of it and brings forth that new man by the new birth then that's a marriage what began as a courtship went into that of an engagement a betrothal however you want to word it but it leads to a marriage that takes place and that marriage is where these two shall no longer be 20 two separate people they shall be one and whoever is joined unto the lord is one spirit is one this is how god moves within our lives i'm so thankful for that aren't you i tell you friends take the word that even how god has spoken this here today a lot of instruction within this but it's obedience from the heart as he's speaking to us obey his voice you want to get anywhere with god obey his voice yield to him he's the one he's the one that we want to hear he's the one we want to give ourselves to let's pray heavenly father lord jesus i thank you this morning lord for your leading lord and for your direction god in the service and lord i pray lord jesus as we are we're standing here lord in this moment i just ask oh god that lord as your presence lord has just just
