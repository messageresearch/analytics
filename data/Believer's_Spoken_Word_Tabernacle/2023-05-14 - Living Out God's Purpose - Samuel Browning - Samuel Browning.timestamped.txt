[44:55] in Jesus name
[44:58] amen and amen
[45:01] amen if you return with me to Ephesians
[45:03] 3 I
[45:05] want to certainly just be as I said just
[45:08] greet all the mothers here God bless our
[45:10] sisters and
[45:12] I
[45:13] want to remind you here we have
[45:17] brother Daniel of foray from Ghana he's
[45:20] no stranger to us he's a good friend and
[45:23] he'll be with us here this coming
[45:25] Thursday and then Sunday
[45:28] and then even in the preparation for the
[45:32] meetings there in Memorial Day and I'm
[45:34] certainly looking forward to what God
[45:37] has in store
[45:39] and um
[45:40] you know with everything that goes into
[45:43] it you know in everything we do for the
[45:46] kingdom of God there's always an
[45:47] investment
[45:49] and every time when even we have
[45:52] meetings and so forth there's a great
[45:53] investment that goes into that to be
[45:56] able to to have that and you know when
[45:59] we as we have the meetings I just say it
[46:02] in this way I don't have them just for
[46:04] me but we have them for a body
[46:07] and it's it's a blessing God in times
[46:09] the reason we would have even those
[46:12] moments of special meetings those are
[46:14] moments and times
[46:16] and I ask you and just request that just
[46:18] to be in prayer for those services that
[46:20] God come by our way and do something
[46:24] special for us Lord
[46:26] God's just that kind of a God I know I
[46:29] know friends I'm not putting God into a
[46:32] bottle of special meetings and the only
[46:34] way you know God is by special meetings
[46:36] no special meetings are special times
[46:40] there's special moments there's things
[46:42] that God will do very specially for us
[46:45] and you know there's expectation and I
[46:48] would say my what God is able to do when
[46:51] we have an expectation
[46:53] and I tell you whatever the need might
[46:56] be there's requests upon your heart and
[46:58] I'd say God just just grant a real
[47:02] outpouring of the holy spirit amen where
[47:05] lives are touched and hearts are filled
[47:07] and immense sicknesses is just just
[47:11] removed from the body
[47:13] that's the kind of God we serve
[47:16] and we are so thankful that we have
[47:18] these Privileges and opportunities and
[47:20] to be a part of that and um
[47:24] I certainly am going to ask for your
[47:27] gracious because even when we get into
[47:30] the month of June and the first part of
[47:31] July even for myself it's going to be
[47:33] even busier with some different meetings
[47:36] and things and I'll speak of that as it
[47:38] comes on for myself
[47:40] and but I certainly covet your prayers
[47:44] and and it's just good to be here today
[47:47] and it's good to be in the house of the
[47:49] Lord and Ephesians chapter 3
[47:53] and verse 8.
[47:57] unto me
[47:59] Who Am less than the least of All Saints
[48:02] is this Grace given
[48:05] that I should preach among the Gentiles
[48:09] the unsearchable riches
[48:12] of Christ
[48:15] and to make all men see what is the
[48:18] fellowship
[48:19] of the mystery which from the beginning
[48:22] of the world hath been hidden God who
[48:24] created All Things by Jesus Christ
[48:28] to the intent that now
[48:31] unto the principalities and powers in
[48:34] Heavenly places
[48:36] might be known by the church
[48:40] the manifold wisdom of God Brothers just
[48:43] turn me down just a hair in my monitors
[48:45] please
[48:46] I want you to notice the purpose of this
[48:48] in verse 10 to the intent the purpose
[48:51] that now unto the principalities and
[48:54] powers in Heavenly places might be known
[48:58] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[49:04] God's a god of variety
[49:07] he's got a great he's got a great
[49:09] variety just like the variety of trees
[49:11] and variety of grasses on and on God's
[49:13] got a great variety
[49:16] in verse 11.
[49:18] according to the Eternal purpose which
[49:21] he purposed
[49:23] in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have
[49:27] boldness and access with confidence by
[49:33] the faith of him
[49:36] amen I I want to read here a quote
[49:38] before I let you be seated if that'd be
[49:40] all right very short
[49:41] but out of the message Paradox and
[49:43] brother Branham will speak of this in
[49:46] a few different places in the message
[49:47] actually in fundamental Foundation of
[49:49] Faith he takes the whole message on it
[49:52] and he says here towards the end somehow
[49:55] or another the Holy Spirit has made its
[49:57] way down into their hearts and as
[50:00] they're telling them you are not here
[50:03] just to eat and drink and to sleep and
[50:06] to get up and work and then to go back
[50:09] eat and drink and sleep again you're
[50:12] here to be Sons and Daughters of God
[50:17] he's not saying we don't sleep we don't
[50:20] eat we don't work
[50:22] but that's not the first purpose that
[50:24] we're here for
[50:25] we're here to be Sons and Daughters of
[50:29] God
[50:30] in each of those things you are here to
[50:34] take your position and place
[50:38] in Christ
[50:40] so I'd like to just speak here if the
[50:42] Lord would help us this morning on
[50:44] living out
[50:45] God's purpose living out God's purpose
[50:49] God bless you as you're being seated I
[50:51] want to say Brother Ray welcome back God
[50:54] bless you God bless you it's good to
[50:56] have you back
[50:58] amen my Aunt Linda it's been a
[51:01] it's good to have her here with us as
[51:03] well and for the Ryan sister Rachel I
[51:05] know they've dealt with some things
[51:06] there in the family and uh brother Ryan
[51:10] we're praying for you all for that the
[51:12] Lord just Comforts your hearts there
[51:15] uh you heard the report of my
[51:17] father-in-law and we just thank God that
[51:20] uh this morning I certainly appreciate
[51:22] your prayers that his um the appetite
[51:25] and that's what we were praying for even
[51:27] this morning as it was praying this
[51:29] morning sometimes you know medicines and
[51:31] other things can really affect you in
[51:33] different ways especially when you're
[51:34] not used to taking them
[51:36] and you know
[51:38] we could look at it and say well just
[51:39] get those medications out of his system
[51:41] and so forth then sometimes there's
[51:43] things that we do have to get out of our
[51:45] system but then there's other parts of
[51:46] it you know where there's a need for
[51:49] certain things to be there and to help
[51:51] and I just said this morning I said God
[51:53] you're still God
[51:55] it doesn't matter where that's at and
[51:58] then the report that we got that what he
[52:00] had ate and was it a full breakfast he
[52:03] ate this morning to drink through the
[52:05] three orange juice things and I mean and
[52:08] so that's as uh this is really good from
[52:11] what from what he has been because he
[52:14] just hasn't had any appetite and just
[52:16] been able to really keep the things down
[52:18] so we just certainly thank God for amen
[52:22] for your prayers and we just want to
[52:24] continue to remember each one in prayer
[52:27] um as we look at this here this morning
[52:29] I I want to just you know I thought of
[52:31] this and I'm looking at this thought and
[52:33] many of those things and some of the
[52:36] people here are individuals young people
[52:39] or maybe middle age now I guess they
[52:41] should say and maybe older you refer
[52:43] when you would read certain books in
[52:46] school and you had to be tested over
[52:48] those books and I don't mean to bring
[52:50] back bad memories you know I but um
[52:53] there's such a thing you know sometimes
[52:55] we would go and say hey let's go get the
[52:58] cliff notes on that book and it was a
[53:01] little yellow book with black stripes
[53:03] and you found the title and you realize
[53:05] you did that to kind of cut to the chase
[53:08] young people covered your ears you you
[53:10] kind of did that to kind of cut to the
[53:12] Chase and all those things now you know
[53:14] it it could help you you know to a to to
[53:17] in a certain extent and things like that
[53:19] but it was to try to summarize and try
[53:22] to make things very simple that might
[53:24] have been a book that was really thick
[53:28] and it would try to summarize it and
[53:30] just simplify even through each of the
[53:32] chapters and so if I could say it like
[53:34] this this morning I pray that God would
[53:36] come the Holy Spirit would come in such
[53:38] a way this would be a cliff note service
[53:41] a service to where the Holy Spirit could
[53:44] take something that when we read these
[53:46] scriptures here in Ephesians 3 and it
[53:49] can seem the wording and the words and
[53:52] it can seem uh so so uh great and
[53:56] overwhelming but there's really God's a
[53:59] god of Simplicity there's words that are
[54:01] said in the way the men those who were
[54:04] moved by the spirit of God when they
[54:06] wrote and they chose certain words they
[54:09] were led by the spirit of God to choose
[54:11] certain words to describe those things
[54:14] and it was God's thoughts that they were
[54:17] coming in tune with and they can write
[54:19] it on paper which they did under his
[54:21] inspiration but it takes the same
[54:23] inspiration that gave it to them that
[54:26] wrote it here to come and lift it out of
[54:29] there and and make it real and what it
[54:31] is it becomes Jesus Christ on display
[54:33] and so when we begin to see this here as
[54:37] we open with that statement that there's
[54:40] things that we have to attend to here in
[54:42] life but it comes down to the very first
[54:44] part and first principle is that God has
[54:48] intended that we would be as Sons and
[54:50] Daughters of God that no matter what
[54:52] capacity we have to work we have to
[54:54] sleep we have to go through all that but
[54:56] that it is a son of son or daughter of
[54:59] God that is on display and operating in
[55:03] whatever that vocation is and that's
[55:05] some of the things in Simplicity that we
[55:07] want to deal with on living out the
[55:09] purpose of God because uh when we look
[55:12] at this we're here to be instruments of
[55:15] his
[55:16] just like this microphone this
[55:18] microphone could have been sent to uh
[55:21] you know some college for lectures to be
[55:24] given it just so it just happened to be
[55:26] this microphone came here this
[55:29] microphone if we decided to sell it on
[55:31] Facebook Marketplace well somebody else
[55:34] could take it and they would use it
[55:35] maybe for other means and you know to
[55:38] sing worldly songs and other things it's
[55:40] just an instrument it doesn't have any
[55:42] mind of its own it can only it can only
[55:45] uh uh uh be used according to what is
[55:49] behind it and we are to we are here to
[55:51] be instruments of his how many know in
[55:54] the scripture where Jesus said I'm
[55:56] Divine you're the branches and to
[55:59] recognize that he says and without me
[56:01] you can do nothing even sometimes the
[56:05] things that we can think and feel like
[56:07] well I'm supposed to be able to do this
[56:09] I should be able to do this and I should
[56:11] and sometimes we can look at even the
[56:13] things that are very natural in life and
[56:16] we can begin to look at just the scope
[56:18] of Earthly things and and feel as though
[56:20] and the thought well you know I can take
[56:22] care of this this is on an Earthly scale
[56:24] but yet to recognize that Lord whatever
[56:27] it is wherever I am whatever job the
[56:30] family you've given me husband and wife
[56:32] so forth and Etc that God we I need you
[56:36] behind me directing me that I might
[56:40] serve the purpose according to your mind
[56:42] and that's where that's the greatest
[56:44] thing that we can have as the Bride of
[56:46] Jesus Christ as a matter of fact that's
[56:48] one of the great characteristics of the
[56:50] Bride of Jesus Christ when the scripture
[56:52] says in Revelations 19 to think of it it
[56:55] says let us be glad and rejoice for the
[56:57] marriage of the Lamb am not the marriage
[57:00] of the lion yet the lion himself has
[57:02] stepped forward with the late claim he's
[57:05] a king that's calling for his Queen but
[57:07] yet what the attribute that is displayed
[57:10] through the life of the Bride is that of
[57:12] the Lamb so she has a lamb nature what
[57:16] is that one that can be led one that is
[57:18] yield one that's willing to be shaved
[57:21] down in mold and and so that's that's
[57:24] the grace of God that is given to you
[57:26] and I in this hour as a matter of fact
[57:28] brother Brandon would say it like this
[57:30] and if God be with us we're Beyond these
[57:32] Miracles he said Lord in his prayer at
[57:34] the end if there's anything that's been
[57:36] accomplished then through our lives it's
[57:38] because your Grace has come and overrode
[57:40] our rebellion in order to fulfill your
[57:43] will now you look at our lives you say
[57:45] well I'm not rebellious I've been I've
[57:47] been born again of the spirit of God no
[57:49] but we recognize that there are things
[57:51] that God has to bring us to that
[57:54] sometimes we look at ourselves and say
[57:55] me me Lord and man you know sometimes
[58:00] it's I don't feel like it or I don't but
[58:02] God in his grace he comes and he
[58:04] overrides and the way that God overrides
[58:06] Rebellion is not with more law or
[58:09] Commandments because that'll breed
[58:10] further Rebellion but God comes with his
[58:13] love which is his word his presence and
[58:16] he lifts us to a place that we can
[58:19] recognize it's not you going to be doing
[58:22] it it's me I just need to borrow your
[58:27] body
[58:29] and oh may God help us to come into that
[58:32] and rest and relax that's the part where
[58:34] Paul said that through the confidence
[58:37] and the boldness by the faith of him
[58:40] that moves in us so I want to just say
[58:42] we're all instruments we're not all the
[58:44] same and neither do uh all the
[58:47] instruments serve the same purpose but
[58:49] we are here for an intended purpose
[58:53] and that's what that's why the scripture
[58:55] said you abide in me and my words abide
[58:57] in you ask what you will and it shall be
[59:00] done and if we can take that scripture
[59:02] and if you abide in me and my words
[59:05] abide in you to recognize that whatever
[59:08] the purpose is that God has called us to
[59:11] God has given his word in this
[59:14] generation that that purpose might be
[59:16] fulfilled and no matter what obstacle
[59:19] you come up against the word is more
[59:23] than enough to take you through the word
[59:26] will and cannot be defeated so the word
[59:30] taking the word and just speaking to
[59:33] that situation let the word be our
[59:36] comfort and I want to just in in one way
[59:39] just really put a true perspective here
[59:41] this morning because when we would speak
[59:44] about the Eternal purpose of God
[59:46] sometimes and with all of us we can get
[59:49] in our minds about certain things and
[59:51] even even after God God has got a hold
[59:54] of our life and certain ways that he's
[59:56] called us and placed us sometimes we can
[59:59] get to looking at one another we can get
[1:00:02] to looking at others and we can get to
[1:00:04] to seeing things and even in our own
[1:00:07] mind begin to entertain thoughts of how
[1:00:10] things should be without sir I should be
[1:00:13] this way or so and so should be this way
[1:00:15] and when we start dwelling on that right
[1:00:18] there that's the very moment that we're
[1:00:21] actually the flow the way God wants to
[1:00:23] use us we begin to restrict the flow of
[1:00:27] the spirit of God operating through our
[1:00:29] lives we're here to be instruments we
[1:00:32] don't get to choose whether we're a big
[1:00:34] screwdriver small screwdriver little
[1:00:37] Hammer big hammer Sledgehammer we don't
[1:00:39] get to choose that that's all been in
[1:00:42] God's choosing before the foundation of
[1:00:44] the world but if we can just find that
[1:00:47] purpose and yield to it and say Lord
[1:00:50] this is what you called me to I I'm
[1:00:53] certain I have a faith in this now Lord
[1:00:55] I just want to submit and give myself to
[1:00:58] you that you can fulfill your purpose
[1:01:01] through my life you say what is that
[1:01:03] that's an eternal God fulfilling an
[1:01:06] eternal purpose here in time
[1:01:09] man so I want to just read a few
[1:01:11] scriptures here to put a true
[1:01:13] perspective on some things that we can
[1:01:16] deal with in First Corinthians 7 17
[1:01:18] remember this is the cliff notes version
[1:01:20] in First Corinthians 7 17 as God has
[1:01:25] distributed to every man as the Lord
[1:01:27] hath called everyone so let him walk and
[1:01:30] so ordain I in all churches is any man
[1:01:34] called being circumcised let him not
[1:01:37] become uncircumcised is any called in
[1:01:40] uncircumcision let him not be
[1:01:43] circumcised circumcision is nothing and
[1:01:47] uncircumcision is nothing but the
[1:01:49] keeping of The Commandments of god
[1:01:51] notice what Paul is putting things where
[1:01:55] the focus and what's important
[1:01:58] circumcision as far as in the flesh
[1:02:01] served as a sign of the abrahamic
[1:02:04] Covenant that God would then it would
[1:02:07] move into that of the spirit where Paul
[1:02:10] said we are circumcised with that which
[1:02:14] is not of the hands wherein that is the
[1:02:17] circumcision of the heart where the
[1:02:19] world the old nature is cut away from
[1:02:22] our lives
[1:02:23] and so Paul is here think of where
[1:02:26] they're standing now because there's
[1:02:28] there's you know parts around the church
[1:02:30] at that time and Paul is letting him
[1:02:33] know that none of that matters but what
[1:02:36] matters is the keeping of The
[1:02:38] Commandments of God in other words is
[1:02:40] keeping the word of God
[1:02:43] let every man this is a tremendous
[1:02:46] scripture let every man abide in the
[1:02:50] same calling wherein he was called Art
[1:02:53] Thou called being a servant
[1:02:55] care not for it but if thou mayest be
[1:02:58] made free use it rather so in other
[1:03:01] words Paul's saying if you're a servant
[1:03:02] don't look upon and say well I really
[1:03:04] can't serve God uh the way that if I was
[1:03:07] a free man no God called you being a
[1:03:09] servant then remember don't care for it
[1:03:12] don't become occupied with I'm a servant
[1:03:15] serve The God Who has called you
[1:03:19] if you're a free man then Paula says now
[1:03:22] your freedom that Liberty have to go
[1:03:24] here to go there in there use it
[1:03:29] suppose dealing with those that are
[1:03:31] looking onward in a way of oh if I could
[1:03:34] just be here or if I could just do this
[1:03:36] or if I could just do that boy I'd be a
[1:03:38] better Christian oh if I could just be
[1:03:40] here or if I could just do there or if I
[1:03:42] could just live here or if I could just
[1:03:44] do this oh if I could just do this but
[1:03:46] where God has called you grow where God
[1:03:49] has called you that's good are you
[1:03:53] hearing me see it's Satan's duty to try
[1:03:55] to get us looking far off to all this
[1:03:58] Utopia out here all this over here and
[1:04:01] remember God doesn't make any mistakes
[1:04:06] are you with me this is why you'll hear
[1:04:09] Brother random through the message of
[1:04:10] the hour you will hear him even in the
[1:04:13] statements questions and answers and on
[1:04:15] and on when different ones would be
[1:04:17] asking should we leave our churches
[1:04:18] should we do this should we do that and
[1:04:20] what did he say he said you go back to
[1:04:22] your church and you be on fire for God
[1:04:25] and it always brought it back down to
[1:04:28] this one part that brother Brandon would
[1:04:29] deal with in it because you see when God
[1:04:32] has really touched a heart and a life in
[1:04:35] that deep of a way they're not going to
[1:04:37] be able to settle for anything less than
[1:04:40] the full word of God
[1:04:42] right because when the spirit of Truth
[1:04:44] has come he will lead and guide you into
[1:04:46] all truth
[1:04:49] not a Creed not a Dogma it's him that I
[1:04:52] met it's him that I love it's him that I
[1:04:55] want to know more it's him not not a
[1:04:57] church it's him
[1:04:59] and that's why the covenant could be
[1:05:01] that you see this is how the message of
[1:05:04] the Hour come not to bring a control
[1:05:06] over our lives you should live here you
[1:05:09] should go there you should do this but
[1:05:11] the message of the hour came that there
[1:05:14] might be a real personal relationship
[1:05:17] between God and his people between you
[1:05:20] and God that God will direct your life
[1:05:23] so the decisions that are being made in
[1:05:26] your life you make them by the absolute
[1:05:29] of Hallelujah
[1:05:31] that's why I don't believe his ministers
[1:05:33] should be telling anybody move here move
[1:05:35] there or do anything like that because
[1:05:37] why you become a person's absolute
[1:05:40] and God never intended a pastor nor any
[1:05:43] other minister to be the Holy Ghost for
[1:05:45] you
[1:05:46] the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost
[1:05:49] he said he would lead and guide us
[1:05:51] that's God's per you realize that's
[1:05:53] God's desire it's just to lead you and
[1:05:56] guide you personally that's his Delight
[1:06:00] he loves to talk to you he loves to that
[1:06:03] dealing with your life and leading you
[1:06:05] and directing you personally why so that
[1:06:08] with whatever decision you make in life
[1:06:10] you choose to take this job you choose
[1:06:12] to do this there's got to be an absolute
[1:06:15] in your life when you're tested on that
[1:06:18] decision that you know I've met God and
[1:06:21] God led me down this pathway yeah
[1:06:25] because we're tested Daniel was tested
[1:06:27] when the will of God was made known and
[1:06:29] Daniel was tested and he purposed in his
[1:06:31] heart we're going to serve God and the
[1:06:34] devil made him prove it that's why faith
[1:06:37] is so important Revelation is so
[1:06:40] important and knowing the purpose of God
[1:06:43] because we will be tested
[1:06:47] my verse 22 for he that is called in the
[1:06:51] Lord being a servant is the Lord's free
[1:06:53] man likewise also he that is called
[1:06:55] being free is Christ's servant I'm going
[1:06:58] to tell you these scriptures were very
[1:06:59] liberating for some brothers and sisters
[1:07:02] very liberating
[1:07:04] ye are bought with the price be not
[1:07:06] Servants of men
[1:07:10] verse 24 Brethren let every man wherein
[1:07:15] he is called there abide with God
[1:07:20] so the spirit of God comes to call us
[1:07:23] from a life of unbelief to a Faith Life
[1:07:29] is that right from a life of unbelief to
[1:07:34] a Faith Life it calls us out of the
[1:07:37] world and bringing us into Christ that's
[1:07:39] why Paul could say the gospel in whom
[1:07:42] you first trusted when the gospel was
[1:07:44] sounded out you first trusted you
[1:07:47] believed you see even the gospel being
[1:07:51] preached the Holy Spirit coming and
[1:07:53] dealing with the life what is happening
[1:07:56] within that life where they would begin
[1:07:58] to turn from the things of the world
[1:08:01] they would begin to turn even turning
[1:08:04] away from the world and turning to the
[1:08:06] things of God in a real repentance what
[1:08:09] is it that would do that it would be
[1:08:12] Faith how does faith come by hearing the
[1:08:15] word of God there's no other way for
[1:08:18] Faith to come is that right so then it's
[1:08:21] Faith being based on a true source and
[1:08:24] then from that that very place right
[1:08:26] there then it's Faith that's operating
[1:08:28] to call us out of unbelief into a faith
[1:08:33] life now I want you to take this in for
[1:08:35] the true perspective here brother random
[1:08:38] makes a statement in spoken words
[1:08:39] Original Seed and I want you to notice
[1:08:41] our brother Adam is dealing with this on
[1:08:43] the seat of Abraham because remember
[1:08:45] that the Seed of Abraham uh Paul would
[1:08:49] write in Galatians 3 that we when we
[1:08:52] have been baptized in to Christ Jesus
[1:08:56] that's talking about Holy Ghost spirit
[1:08:59] induction
[1:09:01] we have put on Christ he said then we
[1:09:05] take on Abraham's seed Not seeds but
[1:09:10] seed and Abraham's seed is Christ
[1:09:15] is that right now let's read let me read
[1:09:17] this quote and here I want you to catch
[1:09:19] this perspective because sometimes it's
[1:09:21] the thoughts about things remember even
[1:09:24] with Elijah James would feel pressed by
[1:09:27] the spirit of God even though it's wrote
[1:09:29] in the Old Testament as far as to be
[1:09:30] able to see Elijah in all these ups and
[1:09:33] downs and everything but James would be
[1:09:35] moved by the spirit of God to write that
[1:09:38] a man subject to like passion such as we
[1:09:41] are
[1:09:42] you say why would that be why would that
[1:09:44] be necessary to remind you and I that
[1:09:47] Elijah he was a mortal In the Flesh he
[1:09:51] had the battles he had the times he
[1:09:53] needed to get under the uh to go to the
[1:09:55] juniper tree he needed to be refreshed
[1:09:58] God had Angels there to nurse him to
[1:10:01] feed him to brush his brow back he had
[1:10:03] the pressures of the day and God would
[1:10:06] allow that for you and I had to see that
[1:10:08] that within that part of humanity there
[1:10:11] was something greater there than that of
[1:10:13] the humanity in other words it's not us
[1:10:15] looking back and say oh if I could just
[1:10:18] be like Elijah you don't want to be like
[1:10:20] Elijah you want to be like God was how
[1:10:23] God was preeminent in the life of Elijah
[1:10:27] is that right that's why you don't want
[1:10:29] to be like somebody else if anything at
[1:10:31] all intrigues or stirs up your life
[1:10:34] it's not the DNA of that person it's
[1:10:37] Christ in that life that is challenging
[1:10:40] and calling to our life that is he's
[1:10:43] preeminent there let him be preeminent
[1:10:45] in your life
[1:10:47] Jesus was the Seed of Abraham fleshly
[1:10:50] speaking a predestinated seat of Abraham
[1:10:54] and when the spirit fell on him what
[1:10:57] kind of a life did he bring he brought a
[1:11:00] Faith Life what kind of a life now watch
[1:11:02] this you mean he's going to be a
[1:11:05] Sojourner like Abraham
[1:11:07] that's where people get so mixed up
[1:11:11] today
[1:11:12] they try to think that a man of God has
[1:11:15] to do this and follow this and do that
[1:11:18] oh mercy no let me just say this very
[1:11:21] clearly
[1:11:23] if Jesus here this morning was in a
[1:11:25] Corporal body he would not be wearing a
[1:11:28] Palestinian robe
[1:11:31] he'd be wearing a suit like the one he
[1:11:33] gave me
[1:11:36] or a shirt tie whatever you know I'm
[1:11:38] quoting many quotes from the message he
[1:11:40] what would he would be wearing he would
[1:11:42] be present and according to his word
[1:11:46] is that right so now so now it's dealing
[1:11:50] with our thoughts and and people looking
[1:11:52] at things of oh so it's a fake life so
[1:11:55] he's got to be a Sojourner like Abraham
[1:11:57] so maybe I need to go sell everything
[1:11:58] and go to Cabela's and go in debt and
[1:12:00] buy a bunch of tents and walk around no
[1:12:01] no you can be that a matter of fact can
[1:12:03] take you further from God because and
[1:12:05] then what you say well well how can that
[1:12:07] take me further from God because you've
[1:12:09] got to know the purpose of God and what
[1:12:11] God has called you to
[1:12:13] that was all a type and an example
[1:12:15] because in this life as Abraham was a
[1:12:19] Sojourner we are sojourners pilgrims and
[1:12:23] strangers in this life
[1:12:26] once we've been born of the spirit of
[1:12:28] God we can say this world is not my home
[1:12:33] I'm just a Sojourner what's a Sojourner
[1:12:36] it's one who is coming to the full
[1:12:39] promise
[1:12:40] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:12:44] right Dwelling Places see often he's
[1:12:47] right there we're on our way now how was
[1:12:50] Christ The Seed of Abraham not so much
[1:12:53] in his body
[1:12:55] because Isaac the seat of Isaac finally
[1:12:57] fell it died it backslid and hybrid too
[1:12:59] he said but the faith Seed of Abraham
[1:13:04] that he believed God's word
[1:13:06] regardless of what the circumstances was
[1:13:12] that's the faith see regardless of the
[1:13:15] circumstances
[1:13:16] so whatever the calling is regardless of
[1:13:19] the circumstances he says all that I
[1:13:22] feel like shouting the faith Seed of
[1:13:24] Abraham what was it not Abraham's body
[1:13:27] but Abraham's Faith Abraham's faith in
[1:13:30] the word of God no matter what come he
[1:13:33] called anything contrary to it as though
[1:13:36] it wasn't there
[1:13:39] it was a faith seed so when we see this
[1:13:42] it's God himself that's actually he's
[1:13:45] operating his life through the
[1:13:48] predestinated seed of promises I I've
[1:13:50] used this example many times before but
[1:13:53] it's just like if I had my cell phone up
[1:13:54] here there's only one way or let me just
[1:13:57] use this belt pack here there's only one
[1:13:59] way that this right here can come across
[1:14:02] through the system there's got to be not
[1:14:05] only the same uh brand but it's got to
[1:14:08] be on the same channel and that has to
[1:14:10] all be set up and let me say this you
[1:14:13] and I were set up already before the
[1:14:17] foundation of the world on the channel
[1:14:20] and frequency of this hour
[1:14:24] that's why no other message previously
[1:14:27] could have had an effect on you but it
[1:14:31] is the inspiration of this hour the Holy
[1:14:35] Spirit God revealing his word that has
[1:14:39] an effect on you and I and what is it it
[1:14:42] is that of God's life uniting with
[1:14:45] himself and what it what does it bring
[1:14:47] forth a new creation just as you need
[1:14:51] sperm and egg to bring forth the seed
[1:14:54] was there as the pre-prepared betting
[1:14:57] ground and God's own life comes in and
[1:15:00] it quickens and it raises up a new man a
[1:15:04] son and daughter of God on the inside
[1:15:06] and then it is God expressing
[1:15:11] himself through every individual life
[1:15:16] that's the sovereignty of God it's God
[1:15:19] living out through you and I his own
[1:15:21] purpose and it's him no matter what
[1:15:24] vocation or whatever we were in life
[1:15:26] it's God calls us to serve his purpose
[1:15:30] and this is why when we think of that in
[1:15:33] the scriptures we read there in First
[1:15:35] Corinthians 7 20 and 24 a lot of times
[1:15:38] we can get into the thought and I I just
[1:15:40] say we and and we can still deal with
[1:15:43] these things sometimes but sometimes we
[1:15:45] have this what we call a perfect
[1:15:48] scenario and you know everything's just
[1:15:50] got this has got to be the perfect her
[1:15:52] you know and we I I I'm not able to do
[1:15:54] this if this doesn't happen or this
[1:15:56] doesn't take place or you know like
[1:15:58] those who were servants or I really
[1:16:00] can't serve God the way I need to and
[1:16:01] you know I'm going to have to be free
[1:16:03] let me just say this to you there was a
[1:16:06] little woman who was taken captive by
[1:16:09] the Syrian Army
[1:16:10] and she was down there in naaman's house
[1:16:12] and let me tell you something you think
[1:16:15] there weren't days that she wasn't down
[1:16:17] you think there wasn't days that she
[1:16:19] didn't long for her Homeland you think
[1:16:22] there wasn't days that she said oh if I
[1:16:24] could only get let me just bring it to
[1:16:25] our time a family reunion if I could
[1:16:28] just see the family well if I could just
[1:16:29] get back into the Homeland God that's
[1:16:31] where your blessings are that's where
[1:16:33] you promised but little did she know
[1:16:35] that she was there because there was
[1:16:38] going to be one by the name of Naaman in
[1:16:41] whose house she would be in and he would
[1:16:43] be suffering with the leprous condition
[1:16:46] well was she a gentile
[1:16:48] oh my and here in the midst of that time
[1:16:52] think about it when that kid got news
[1:16:55] and everything he tried everything to
[1:16:58] take care of his leprosy but she made a
[1:17:00] declaration there is a God in Israel
[1:17:03] there's a prophet there who hears from
[1:17:06] God there's one whom God can speak to
[1:17:09] she was a testimony not in a place she
[1:17:14] chose to be in if she would have been
[1:17:16] given the choice before the foundation
[1:17:18] the world do you want to serve my
[1:17:21] purpose of course being of that of a
[1:17:23] child of God and Alexi she would say
[1:17:25] sure Lord I want to serve your purpose
[1:17:28] well this is where you're going to serve
[1:17:29] my purpose you're going to be a
[1:17:31] testimony and a light in the house of a
[1:17:34] Syrian one who will come against my
[1:17:37] people your people time and time again
[1:17:40] but I'm going to put you as a light
[1:17:41] there and it might only be for one
[1:17:44] little thing that I'm asking you to do
[1:17:46] but it is for a purpose what are you
[1:17:49] saying brother Samuel what if that
[1:17:51] little lady had stood there and said
[1:17:53] well I really can't serve God all the
[1:17:55] p's and q's aren't lined up just right
[1:17:57] everything's just not perfect you know
[1:17:59] but when all this gets better and I get
[1:18:01] back in the Homeland be on fire for God
[1:18:03] no she was there she had to pray through
[1:18:07] she had to look to God she had a
[1:18:09] connection with God now let me tell you
[1:18:11] something she had a strength and a Joy
[1:18:14] about her life you say brother Samuel
[1:18:17] how can you say that because there was a
[1:18:19] testimony even in the midst of that time
[1:18:22] for her to declare God is still God and
[1:18:25] there is a God that can minister to your
[1:18:27] need how do you know that God don't have
[1:18:29] you in that department on that job and
[1:18:31] with this one or that one how do you
[1:18:33] know that your time being right there is
[1:18:35] not for just a word of testimony and a
[1:18:39] witness to one do not despise where God
[1:18:42] has you or look for a perfect scenario
[1:18:46] [Applause]
[1:18:49] Paul just instructed him where we read
[1:18:52] just surrender to the Lord who's called
[1:18:55] you and abide in your calling let him
[1:18:57] use you in whatever capacity that God's
[1:19:01] called you and don't spend your time
[1:19:03] trying to be like somebody else
[1:19:06] are you hearing me but where God has
[1:19:08] placed you and neither don't be
[1:19:11] comfortable or complacent
[1:19:13] where God has placed you but say God how
[1:19:17] might you use me what would you have me
[1:19:19] to do
[1:19:22] brother Ram would sound like this and
[1:19:24] kind of get the picture he said in in
[1:19:27] classic Spirits I love this quote he
[1:19:30] said give me a preacher give me a
[1:19:33] Christian give me a housewife that's a
[1:19:35] Christian give me a farmer or a factory
[1:19:38] worker that'll put God first in
[1:19:41] everything and I'll show you a man will
[1:19:44] be successful in the spite of all the
[1:19:47] devil can put on him because he seeks
[1:19:50] God first notice all the vacations give
[1:19:53] me a preacher give me a housewife give
[1:19:56] me a farmer a factory worker one better
[1:19:58] Christian and I'll put God first I'll
[1:20:01] show you in regardless of all the devil
[1:20:03] can put on them they will come out on
[1:20:05] top because they put God first
[1:20:10] so the vocation well I'm just a farmer
[1:20:13] no put God first
[1:20:15] let God be let God live through you as a
[1:20:18] farmer
[1:20:19] all right
[1:20:21] whatever that God has intended to do as
[1:20:24] a housewife let God live through you as
[1:20:26] a housewife now look at this here in
[1:20:29] Romans 8 28 we know that all things work
[1:20:33] together for good to them that love God
[1:20:35] to them who are the called according to
[1:20:39] his purpose
[1:20:42] how many know that everything's not good
[1:20:44] but it'll work for the good
[1:20:46] right
[1:20:47] even even our our bad decisions if we'll
[1:20:50] if we'll just mind the Lord and say Lord
[1:20:52] now you help me
[1:20:56] Lord I want to learn from this I want to
[1:20:58] grow from this God will make it work to
[1:21:01] our good
[1:21:03] now that don't mean that all of a sudden
[1:21:04] bad decisions we made that God's going
[1:21:06] to come around with the big eraser and
[1:21:08] say hey man let me spoil you a little
[1:21:10] bit and just take all that no that
[1:21:12] doesn't mean that but he will give you
[1:21:14] Grace and he will teach you he will
[1:21:16] guide you through that so that you and I
[1:21:18] come out of there and say you know what
[1:21:19] I got in a place I started trusting on
[1:21:21] the horses and Chariots of Egypt I
[1:21:23] started leaning on the arm of Flesh I
[1:21:25] started leaning on my reasoning facing
[1:21:27] this situation come on now I I know I'm
[1:21:29] not the only one who builds Bridges
[1:21:31] there's a lot of people in here a good
[1:21:33] build Bridge Builders is that right and
[1:21:35] sometimes listen those are parts of
[1:21:37] things that are even in our temperament
[1:21:39] and our makeup and that's why the spirit
[1:21:40] of God many times standing on the
[1:21:42] platform would be identified with
[1:21:44] different ones who were there and say
[1:21:46] your whole problem your life has been
[1:21:48] your makeup well did God strip the
[1:21:51] makeup the temperament out of the person
[1:21:52] no but it's recognizing you're letting
[1:21:56] the enemy Get The Best of You by taking
[1:21:59] that and work against you but God made
[1:22:02] you that way and it's going to take you
[1:22:04] surrendering that to God instead of
[1:22:07] looking at Building Bridges say God I'm
[1:22:09] going to look at your word Lord I'm
[1:22:11] going to take your word and I'm going to
[1:22:13] take it in my life I'm going to quote
[1:22:15] that word confess that word I don't care
[1:22:16] whether I feel like it or not whether I
[1:22:18] feel anything come my way or not I am
[1:22:21] going to stand on your word
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:25] yes
[1:22:27] Hallelujah
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:31] I just got done speaking to young people
[1:22:32] the way the Lord took it on Friday night
[1:22:35] and I told him we're talking about
[1:22:37] habits and establishing good habits of
[1:22:40] walking through things in a message and
[1:22:41] we've been dealing with some of those
[1:22:43] things from the previous time and we're
[1:22:45] talking we've just you know we just talk
[1:22:46] in our Bible study and we're there and I
[1:22:49] said you realize there's many times I
[1:22:51] said every day is not a pie eaten day
[1:22:54] I like apple pie but every day is not an
[1:22:56] apple pie day
[1:22:59] some days it's a flower day sugar day
[1:23:02] it's an ingredient day
[1:23:05] you know what I'm saying
[1:23:06] now you know I don't really get all over
[1:23:10] over the top on ingredient days but when
[1:23:12] the pie is there that's what I'm talking
[1:23:15] about
[1:23:16] but that's the same way it is with our
[1:23:18] life as a Christian what are we going to
[1:23:21] do on ingredient days because if you
[1:23:23] don't give yourself to God on the
[1:23:25] ingredient days that are not the who
[1:23:27] glory to God this and great no what are
[1:23:29] you going to do when it's ingredient
[1:23:30] days because you need ingredients to
[1:23:34] make the pie
[1:23:36] I wish I could preach that
[1:23:40] come on you see that's a true
[1:23:41] perspective as well in our life
[1:23:43] sometimes we get to look at one another
[1:23:45] and we can look at one another and think
[1:23:47] man they're always on the Mountaintop
[1:23:49] that's not true let me go and tell you
[1:23:50] for everybody here that is not the truth
[1:23:53] that's not a true perspective of a
[1:23:56] Christian life but our Christian Life is
[1:23:59] one that's filled with mountains it's
[1:24:01] filled with valleys but what makes the
[1:24:03] difference and will help us through is
[1:24:05] the same God that guides you if you'll
[1:24:08] just let him that even when you're in a
[1:24:10] valley don't just let the valley
[1:24:12] overwhelm you but make a declaration I'm
[1:24:16] going to praise God in the valley I am
[1:24:18] going to have the devil confused he's
[1:24:21] going to think I'm on a Mountaintop but
[1:24:23] I'm gonna praise him in the valley like
[1:24:25] I'm on the Mountaintop
[1:24:29] everybody has valleys everybody's got
[1:24:32] mountain tops
[1:24:35] dear Lord we'd love to live on Mountain
[1:24:37] Transfiguration every day of the week
[1:24:40] but as soon as Jesus got down off of
[1:24:42] Mount Transfiguration at the bottom of
[1:24:45] the hill there was problems
[1:24:48] right Abraham came down
[1:24:52] from Mount Moriah a little bit after
[1:24:55] that Sarah died
[1:24:58] is that right thank God for Mountaintop
[1:25:00] experiences
[1:25:02] but we can't live on the mountains
[1:25:06] well let's go for whom he did for no he
[1:25:09] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:25:12] the image of his son that he might be
[1:25:14] the firstborn
[1:25:16] among many brethren
[1:25:18] more of whom he did predestinate them he
[1:25:20] also he justified in whom he justified
[1:25:24] them he also glorified so we are made
[1:25:26] for a purpose everything around us them
[1:25:29] pews they were made for a purpose
[1:25:33] to have a place to sit right the church
[1:25:36] all this was here it was made it's a
[1:25:38] purpose that we might have a place to
[1:25:40] come and worship
[1:25:41] write our house our house was made with
[1:25:44] a purpose for what for us to live in the
[1:25:46] automobile it wasn't just a bunch of
[1:25:48] guys saying I wonder if we can get a
[1:25:50] bunch of metal together and you know
[1:25:51] whip something up no it was with the
[1:25:53] purpose okay and it wasn't just all
[1:25:55] together to rip you off it was with the
[1:25:57] purpose then you might be able to drive
[1:26:00] from one point to the next
[1:26:02] so everything's with a purpose even when
[1:26:04] it comes to the fingernail for those of
[1:26:06] you that got them on your fingers the
[1:26:09] fingernail itself very interesting not
[1:26:11] going to take a lot of time on it but if
[1:26:12] you didn't have fingernails you'd have a
[1:26:13] hard time turning pages
[1:26:16] and believe it or not your fingernails
[1:26:18] have a sensitivity in them where nerves
[1:26:19] are connected there that's a different
[1:26:21] time
[1:26:22] so everything in itself I mean the food
[1:26:24] the food that was raised it was grown
[1:26:26] for a purpose for what not decorations
[1:26:29] but to eat it
[1:26:31] right
[1:26:33] I mean apples were not made to eat by
[1:26:36] themselves apples were made tea with
[1:26:38] brown sugar
[1:26:39] and oats
[1:26:44] the same I dislike them you need to come
[1:26:47] on up higher in Revelation
[1:26:49] all right
[1:26:52] the tree was made for a purpose
[1:26:55] right you're going to buy a tree for
[1:26:57] your house you select the tree based on
[1:27:00] your need because that tree already has
[1:27:02] built in there's a purpose even in how
[1:27:05] that that that it is brought forth
[1:27:06] whether it's one that can dwell you know
[1:27:08] in in swamping Marshy areas do you want
[1:27:10] a shade tree fruit on and on there's a
[1:27:12] purpose behind it and that's why God did
[1:27:15] not make you and I and just see if he
[1:27:18] could do it
[1:27:21] did not bring you this far just to see
[1:27:24] if he could do it
[1:27:26] brother Ben said he just didn't make you
[1:27:28] just to be a human being
[1:27:30] you are ordained to be a silent daughter
[1:27:33] of God what are you saying I'm saying
[1:27:35] deity being expressed through Humanity
[1:27:39] what God was in Christ
[1:27:42] Christ has now come into the believer
[1:27:45] it's the same Jesus the same yesterday
[1:27:48] and forever the same deity on this play
[1:27:51] the same life the same quality inside of
[1:27:55] you and I
[1:27:56] we're here for a specific purpose no
[1:27:59] matter how little you are how
[1:28:02] unimportant you think you are we're here
[1:28:04] for a purpose that is not a pep talk
[1:28:07] that's a reality
[1:28:11] what are you saying don't get caught up
[1:28:14] in what you're calling just be focused
[1:28:18] on the god who's called you and say Lord
[1:28:21] what would you have me do let my life
[1:28:23] become a life that's filled with real
[1:28:26] Vision like it says in the book of of
[1:28:29] Ephesians 1 Paul prayed for this that
[1:28:32] the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:28:34] father of Glory may give you the spirit
[1:28:36] of wisdom and Revelation in the
[1:28:38] knowledge of him can I just say
[1:28:39] something here this is not a One-Shot
[1:28:41] deal
[1:28:44] what do you say I'm saying that the
[1:28:47] Revelation continues to be unfolded I'm
[1:28:51] saying that God continues to unfold
[1:28:54] himself even through our tests and our
[1:28:56] trials and God permits the oppositions
[1:28:59] to come our way that brings you and I to
[1:29:01] the realization it's not me that's doing
[1:29:04] it now I have it's not me that's been
[1:29:06] doing it it's been God now here's a
[1:29:09] situation that God just wants to remind
[1:29:12] you and I it's me the whole time I'm
[1:29:15] your Waymaker I'm the one to take you
[1:29:17] through and God uses those times to let
[1:29:21] you and I know I've never abandoned you
[1:29:24] I've never left you but what you might
[1:29:26] think is too great I've ordained you for
[1:29:29] this purpose just yield to me
[1:29:34] preaching
[1:29:36] I don't mind telling you that verse 17
[1:29:38] we need that as parents
[1:29:41] I don't mind telling you I need it as a
[1:29:43] pastor I need it as a husband
[1:29:45] but God continued to unfold
[1:29:49] in our lives but the eyes of your
[1:29:52] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:29:54] might know what is the hope of his
[1:29:56] calling and what the riches of the glory
[1:29:59] of his inheritance in the Saints
[1:30:02] I want to know
[1:30:04] I want to know God let the eyes of my
[1:30:06] understanding you you say what do you
[1:30:08] mean I'm saying that we continue to grow
[1:30:10] in Christ I'm not the same that I was
[1:30:12] even a year ago
[1:30:14] I can tell you that there's a lot of
[1:30:15] lessons I've learned there's a lot of
[1:30:17] things that God has already has brought
[1:30:18] me through a lot of things I've learned
[1:30:20] even from when I first started pastoring
[1:30:22] let alone as a Daddy has a husband
[1:30:24] there's a lot of things I've learned and
[1:30:25] guess what I'm still learning
[1:30:29] I don't have a PhD yet in any of those
[1:30:32] categories as a matter of fact I've just
[1:30:34] walked across the kindergarten stage and
[1:30:35] got my certificate and I'm ready to
[1:30:37] start oh brother Sammy you're just
[1:30:39] funding with us no I'm not funning with
[1:30:40] you because you know why the Bible says
[1:30:42] grow and Grace is that right the Bible
[1:30:45] also says at the very concluding verse
[1:30:48] of where it talks about that these
[1:30:50] bodies shall be changed in a moment in
[1:30:51] twinkling of an eye the final verse says
[1:30:54] that you would be abounding in the work
[1:30:56] of the Lord that there is continual
[1:30:59] growth and quickening by the spirit of
[1:31:01] God until we leave here
[1:31:06] I'll tell you what I'm not interested in
[1:31:08] advancements in the natural world I'm
[1:31:10] interested in an advancement out of here
[1:31:13] are you hearing me now I'm not
[1:31:15] interested listen friends Joseph never
[1:31:18] tried to placade or tried to play on his
[1:31:20] boss Joseph didn't do that Joseph was
[1:31:23] just simply being Joseph there in the
[1:31:27] prison he had his times of weeping at
[1:31:29] his times of crying he had his times I
[1:31:31] don't understand God gave me this this
[1:31:33] dream as a 17 year old boy and here I am
[1:31:36] standing here and what is taking place I
[1:31:38] don't know what's going on but Joseph by
[1:31:41] God's grace was able to yield himself to
[1:31:44] where in the midst of the prison the
[1:31:47] Bible could say the Lord was with him
[1:31:49] not because Joseph yielded but the Lord
[1:31:52] was with him and helped him to yield
[1:31:55] beyond all his sorrow Beyond everything
[1:31:58] do you realize that when Joseph himself
[1:32:01] finally got married and had a child the
[1:32:04] very first child that he had called
[1:32:06] Manasseh said the Lord hath caused me to
[1:32:09] forget all of that in the past oh my I
[1:32:13] tell you talking about the power of
[1:32:15] forgiveness it comes through and by the
[1:32:18] sea life of Jesus Christ moving into our
[1:32:21] lives
[1:32:23] Joseph
[1:32:25] he had a vision
[1:32:28] of what God had wanted to do now I just
[1:32:31] I'll just say it in this way that
[1:32:33] there's a man God desires that we be
[1:32:37] people of vision
[1:32:39] not of this not not of this worth
[1:32:42] not of this Earth
[1:32:45] but when we look beyond the visible
[1:32:48] and look into the Unseen
[1:32:50] to where that there's a purpose that we
[1:32:52] are moved by in life
[1:32:55] because the whole the Bible tells us the
[1:32:58] whole conclusion what we're here for
[1:33:01] is to fear God and to keep his
[1:33:03] Commandments
[1:33:06] that's the whole purpose that we're here
[1:33:08] is to serve God
[1:33:10] when it all comes down and said and done
[1:33:13] and we can stand before a casket I don't
[1:33:15] care how good a person's been
[1:33:17] thank God for good people but it ain't
[1:33:19] been good to put you on the other side
[1:33:24] well I know they love Jesus really
[1:33:27] sometimes those are things that people
[1:33:29] can say and they never have a life that
[1:33:31] matches it I'm sorry
[1:33:33] we got to be genuine and true you say
[1:33:35] why
[1:33:36] because the truth is the truth
[1:33:38] if you love him you will keep his
[1:33:41] Commandments
[1:33:43] that's the word of God John 14 John 16
[1:33:46] if you don't love him it shows
[1:33:49] now you can love him here but here's
[1:33:52] where you got to love him
[1:33:54] you can love him here and it'll fade
[1:33:57] but when it gets down here that's the
[1:34:00] love of God
[1:34:02] that's where no devil can ever overthrow
[1:34:05] that
[1:34:07] that's the prevailing power of almighty
[1:34:10] God
[1:34:11] you see the purpose that we're here for
[1:34:13] Stay With Me Now the purpose that you
[1:34:16] and I are here let me read this out of
[1:34:18] spoken words Original Seed brother
[1:34:19] answer our heavenly father you said in
[1:34:21] your word if I be lifted up from the
[1:34:23] earth I will draw all men unto me and
[1:34:26] that is our purpose in life is to lift
[1:34:30] up before a dying generation of people
[1:34:32] that Jesus Christ is still the Son of
[1:34:35] God the savior of the world oh my
[1:34:38] brother REM says here and just once more
[1:34:40] he raised you as an example that he
[1:34:44] might place his power in you to show
[1:34:46] forth his glory
[1:34:49] that's what we're here for
[1:34:53] Ephesians 1
[1:34:55] as it talks about this I just have to
[1:34:57] skip some of this but out of Ephesians 1
[1:34:59] where it speaks our calling that we have
[1:35:02] been blessed with all spiritual
[1:35:04] blessings in Heavenly places according
[1:35:07] out they had chosen Us in him before the
[1:35:09] foundation of the world that we should
[1:35:11] be holy Without Blame before him in love
[1:35:13] are you still with me
[1:35:15] we're going to get to us a cliff known
[1:35:17] here in a minute having predestinated us
[1:35:19] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[1:35:23] Christ to himself it's not adoption like
[1:35:25] we think of it out there today this is a
[1:35:27] placement
[1:35:28] we were always Sons and Daughters of God
[1:35:34] a real child of God here this morning
[1:35:36] that's something that's real then we
[1:35:39] were always a son and daughter of God
[1:35:42] God come and Drew us to himself
[1:35:46] when we're to be to the praise of the
[1:35:48] glory of his grace wherein he have made
[1:35:49] us accepted in the Beloved now
[1:35:55] God
[1:35:56] positionally placing the church
[1:35:59] brother Brian says the church
[1:36:01] positionally
[1:36:02] before the foundation of the world when
[1:36:05] God in his labor pain was bringing forth
[1:36:08] bringing forth you knowing what you
[1:36:11] would do
[1:36:12] he positionally placed you into his own
[1:36:16] body
[1:36:18] to be a housewife
[1:36:21] did I read that right
[1:36:24] that don't seem like maybe a real
[1:36:27] spiritual
[1:36:30] part
[1:36:33] but God positionally placed you into his
[1:36:36] own body
[1:36:37] to be a housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:36:42] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[1:36:44] be that he placed you
[1:36:47] positionly
[1:36:49] so if we look at that correctly it
[1:36:52] doesn't matter housewife farmer preacher
[1:36:55] prophet
[1:36:57] it's all placed in the body
[1:37:01] God's God a purpose
[1:37:05] Joshua remember Joshua was not there
[1:37:08] deciding well I think I like this tribe
[1:37:11] a lot better you know they bring me a
[1:37:13] little bit more treats and things like
[1:37:14] that no no
[1:37:15] Joshua divided according to the
[1:37:18] inspiration
[1:37:19] that God had in his mind for every one
[1:37:22] of those tribes of Israel
[1:37:25] even what Jacob had prophesied under
[1:37:27] inspiration they were Place positioned
[1:37:31] yet to this day placed exactly where
[1:37:35] they are to be according to the
[1:37:36] characteristic of their name
[1:37:39] and God placed them there not to think
[1:37:42] of it when they would get into those
[1:37:44] places it was not it was not something
[1:37:47] that you know would be let's say foreign
[1:37:50] but God had ordained that Ephraim would
[1:37:52] be here Judah would be here and on and
[1:37:54] on God ordained that and the only thing
[1:37:57] they had to do was yield to that
[1:38:00] inspiration and go take what belonged to
[1:38:03] him now just because it was given to him
[1:38:05] did not mean everything was cleared out
[1:38:07] they had to go in and take what God gave
[1:38:10] to them and let me say this to you that
[1:38:13] even when it comes down into our life
[1:38:15] when the Holy Ghost has come remember
[1:38:17] the land of promise is not the
[1:38:21] Millennium the land of promise the
[1:38:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the land of
[1:38:26] overcoming it's overcoming what is it
[1:38:29] that overcomes the world he that's born
[1:38:31] of God and this is that which overcometh
[1:38:34] the world even our faith
[1:38:38] so there is overcoming that has to be
[1:38:41] done Caleb had some overcoming in his
[1:38:45] land
[1:38:46] is that right you said brother Samuel
[1:38:48] what are you saying I'm saying that even
[1:38:50] as God has placed a person as a
[1:38:52] housewife there's overcoming there
[1:38:55] sometimes the overcoming is trying to
[1:38:58] compare ourselves to somebody else and
[1:39:01] can I just say this you may not like me
[1:39:03] but I'm going to say it anyhow don't
[1:39:05] compare yourself to some demo magazine
[1:39:07] either
[1:39:09] that's robed by somewhere only person of
[1:39:12] something else and I'm going to be the
[1:39:14] latest this and I'm going to be the God
[1:39:16] has already given us his word
[1:39:19] oh brother Samuel an email yes it is in
[1:39:22] there it's in there explicitly wrote out
[1:39:25] in Titus in Timothy all the way through
[1:39:28] in Corinthians and there are examples
[1:39:30] with all of the sisters all the way down
[1:39:34] through the Old Testament it's there
[1:39:38] but you see what Satan's desire is to do
[1:39:40] is to get in and try to interpret what a
[1:39:44] position should be
[1:39:47] and that's what's caused all the
[1:39:49] confusion and the mess the way it is
[1:39:51] right now in the world it was prophesied
[1:39:53] to come but we're living in a time where
[1:39:56] the Bible said they would be lovers of
[1:39:59] themselves more than lovers of God
[1:40:02] Lover's a pleasure right they love
[1:40:04] themselves but to thank God has
[1:40:06] positionally placed Us in in his body
[1:40:09] now I want you to think of it in this
[1:40:11] way uh in first First Peter chapter 3
[1:40:13] verse 1. notice Paul is writing this
[1:40:16] here
[1:40:20] I want you to think of this here just
[1:40:22] for a moment likewise you wives be in
[1:40:24] subjection to your own husbands that if
[1:40:27] any obey not the word
[1:40:28] they also May
[1:40:30] without the word be one
[1:40:33] by the conversation of the wise that
[1:40:35] word conversation isn't words
[1:40:39] come on friends this is character
[1:40:42] and conduct
[1:40:44] not the words
[1:40:46] over and over brother Rams asked the
[1:40:48] questions throughout
[1:40:50] when there's not a believing spouse and
[1:40:53] people you have men ask it you have
[1:40:54] women ask it a a bountiful mouth in all
[1:40:58] the questions and answers good question
[1:41:00] it's a good point it's something that
[1:41:02] it's something that is the church and
[1:41:04] people to be able to see and to
[1:41:05] understand you would have those that
[1:41:07] would say Hey you know I I I'm married
[1:41:09] and you know my spouse's not a Believer
[1:41:11] should I just go ahead and get divorced
[1:41:12] and go on and marry somebody else no the
[1:41:14] Bible said that if the unbelieving be
[1:41:17] pleased to dwell with you
[1:41:20] dwell with them
[1:41:22] they might never be saved but if there's
[1:41:26] any hope it's going to be because of
[1:41:28] your life being surrendered to God and
[1:41:30] you being a testimony of the joy of the
[1:41:33] Lord of what it means to serve God let
[1:41:36] him be one by the conversation brother
[1:41:39] bam used the word be salty
[1:41:42] but you see how Satan could also trap
[1:41:44] people into a place perfect scenarios in
[1:41:47] order for me to be what God wants me to
[1:41:49] be and to do this I need to divorce this
[1:41:52] one and I need to remarry this one
[1:41:53] there's no grounds for that sorry
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:57] there's no grounds for those types of
[1:41:59] things
[1:42:00] I know there's been where there's
[1:42:02] certain things I won't even go into that
[1:42:03] where there's been things where people
[1:42:04] have little things of loopholes and one
[1:42:06] of them and there's no grounds for that
[1:42:07] friends when we look at these very
[1:42:09] things when it comes down to it looking
[1:42:11] for perfect scenarios on things oh well
[1:42:14] you know I'm in this situation and I
[1:42:15] really can't serve God who said you
[1:42:17] can't serve God
[1:42:19] maybe the situation that you're in is
[1:42:21] not a situation that you can look at now
[1:42:24] and say I wouldn't have made this
[1:42:26] decision before but right now say you
[1:42:28] know what I'm not going to let this
[1:42:30] situation keep me back from giving
[1:42:33] everything and all that I am to God
[1:42:35] because man's not calling me God's
[1:42:38] calling me
[1:42:39] and that's what I'm yielded to and
[1:42:42] that's why brother random could give I
[1:42:43] think it's beautiful when he could give
[1:42:45] the admonition to different ones and say
[1:42:47] hey look do they even take it right from
[1:42:49] the scripture don't seek to go this way
[1:42:50] or that way just be a real example what
[1:42:53] was he giving them a true perspective
[1:42:57] that you can be an effectual Christian
[1:43:00] and if you want to be a witness and a
[1:43:02] light maybe God has called you to be a
[1:43:05] witness and a light right there
[1:43:08] maybe not Ecuador maybe next door
[1:43:13] oldie but a goodie verse 2 while they
[1:43:16] behold your Chase Comfort conversation
[1:43:18] coupled with reverence who's adorning
[1:43:21] let it not be that outward adorning of
[1:43:24] plating the hair and wearing of gold or
[1:43:27] putting on of apparel
[1:43:29] so it's just nothing that's put on on
[1:43:31] the outside
[1:43:32] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:43:34] heart in that which is not corruptable
[1:43:36] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:43:40] Spirit which is in the sight of God
[1:43:44] a great price for after this manner in
[1:43:46] the old time the holy women also who
[1:43:49] trusted in God adorned themselves being
[1:43:52] in subjection unto their own husbands oh
[1:43:55] Lord
[1:43:57] that certainly won't fit into society
[1:43:59] will it
[1:44:02] even a Sarah will be
[1:44:07] obey do well and are not afraid with any
[1:44:10] amazement likewise your husbands dwell
[1:44:13] with them according to knowledge giving
[1:44:15] honor unto the wife as under the weaker
[1:44:18] vessel and the brothers said
[1:44:21] as being heirs together of the grace of
[1:44:23] life that your prayers be not hindered
[1:44:27] you're pulling that from The Book of
[1:44:28] Malachi
[1:44:29] when they came to the altar God said
[1:44:31] you've been fussing in your home go back
[1:44:33] and straighten that up then come back to
[1:44:35] the altar
[1:44:37] that's cliff notes for what was said
[1:44:44] I know you know I thought about there
[1:44:47] was actually some other thoughts and
[1:44:48] just how God LED it I was going to speak
[1:44:50] on one of the thoughts anointed mothers
[1:44:52] of the scripture but
[1:44:53] begin to look at this and just how the
[1:44:56] Holy Spirit lining this up from things
[1:44:57] has been over some time
[1:45:00] sister meedy
[1:45:02] she made a maybe she made a statement
[1:45:04] when
[1:45:06] brother bill came home the one time and
[1:45:07] remember Joseph had a little boy you
[1:45:10] know he she was going to tan his hide
[1:45:12] for something you know he did and
[1:45:14] and you know brother Brandon was able to
[1:45:15] see that
[1:45:17] you know not that it may not have
[1:45:19] deserved it or needed it brother Brown
[1:45:20] wasn't given him a a pass within it but
[1:45:24] you know there's a lot of things going
[1:45:25] on at the time
[1:45:26] and I'd say it like this
[1:45:28] sister Rebecca Branham even tells
[1:45:31] in a testimony
[1:45:33] of where there was some friction between
[1:45:35] her and her mom that had come up
[1:45:37] and brother Branham called Rebecca into
[1:45:39] the office she just a young teenager and
[1:45:42] he began to go through with her and tell
[1:45:44] her your mom was coming into a season of
[1:45:47] life
[1:45:48] and so you may not understand what's
[1:45:50] taking place but he walked through all
[1:45:52] of that sister Rebecca gives that
[1:45:53] testimony I think it's about a 45-50
[1:45:55] minute
[1:45:56] clip on there and where she was coming
[1:45:58] into menopause
[1:46:00] now think about what brother Brown did
[1:46:01] Brother Bram could have taken that and
[1:46:03] he could have told Rebecca now he he did
[1:46:05] tell her to respect her mother he walked
[1:46:07] her through but I hope you understand
[1:46:09] what I'm saying
[1:46:10] he opened the eyes of her understanding
[1:46:14] are you hearing me now we're talking
[1:46:16] about a father he could have just came
[1:46:18] right out six shooters on tap and we're
[1:46:20] going to blast them
[1:46:22] but he gave the eyes of understanding
[1:46:29] now here she's coming in there's no
[1:46:31] doubt this is during those times as well
[1:46:33] too the pressure is on
[1:46:35] and remember when she made a statement
[1:46:37] to brother Brandon brother brand was you
[1:46:39] know just trying to tell her don't I
[1:46:41] don't think you need to we need to do
[1:46:42] that right now and her statement to him
[1:46:45] was well you ought to be here to care
[1:46:47] for him
[1:46:49] right and you know she came down
[1:46:52] because the Holy Spirit did not like
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:56] is that right
[1:46:57] and brother Bram said oh God no no no
[1:47:00] and what came up on her was a tumor
[1:47:03] cancerous tumor now I want you to think
[1:47:05] of this
[1:47:07] brother Brown's in prayer right before a
[1:47:08] meeting and I want to read this to you
[1:47:10] and I want I want you to the perspective
[1:47:12] is how God looks at the purpose that we
[1:47:16] serve
[1:47:17] and especially when we look at it when
[1:47:19] even as the sisters the housewives right
[1:47:22] now as you'd think of this and you look
[1:47:23] look at this says Lord she didn't mean
[1:47:26] to do that that morning
[1:47:28] Lord not one time has she ever said one
[1:47:31] word about me going in the meetings and
[1:47:34] staying months or whatever it was
[1:47:37] not one time has she ever opened her
[1:47:39] mouth about it she has always sent my
[1:47:42] clothes to the cleaners washed my shirts
[1:47:44] and had everything ready to go in the
[1:47:46] meeting then
[1:47:48] she wonders how she can serve God
[1:47:56] then she wonders how she can serve god
[1:47:59] brother Graham says you women as you
[1:48:01] serve your husband
[1:48:03] you serve God
[1:48:05] course
[1:48:09] you know friends I when I get to looking
[1:48:12] at certain things let me just go on I
[1:48:14] could go into some certain areas now but
[1:48:16] every one of us are born for a purpose
[1:48:21] we're all born for a purpose
[1:48:24] and you look at certain things there was
[1:48:25] an article
[1:48:26] that um
[1:48:28] a little thing from from about a year
[1:48:31] ago year and a half maybe two years ago
[1:48:32] now
[1:48:34] where they had interviewed some
[1:48:36] different women there out of sin and CNN
[1:48:38] had done it I know don't tune me out
[1:48:40] because I said CNN but
[1:48:43] but in any hate in any rate the things
[1:48:46] that they interviewed
[1:48:47] and talk to these women and I read this
[1:48:49] write-up
[1:48:50] where all of them had decided they
[1:48:53] didn't want kids
[1:48:56] I don't want kids
[1:48:57] and the way that when everything comes
[1:48:59] down to if I can give you a cliff notes
[1:49:01] of that right there it come down with it
[1:49:03] it's going to hinder my lifestyle
[1:49:06] because now we got to think about kids
[1:49:10] instead of us me and my partner
[1:49:13] who's proven to be my husband we don't
[1:49:16] have to think about kids we just think
[1:49:17] about us we want to travel here we go
[1:49:18] here we do this we do that
[1:49:21] then you have others that well I deal
[1:49:23] with a lot of anxiety I deal with this
[1:49:24] and you know I don't
[1:49:28] on and on through that article there's
[1:49:30] things that are synonymous common
[1:49:33] underlier
[1:49:34] fear and selfishness
[1:49:37] and let me tell you something fear will
[1:49:40] always come in that way
[1:49:43] God has ordained
[1:49:45] these principles in his word what has
[1:49:49] happened in there where did that come
[1:49:51] from
[1:49:53] are you hearing me now where did that
[1:49:56] come from that those thoughts can be
[1:49:57] made you know when you look at
[1:49:58] statistics people's thinking on
[1:50:01] motherhood changed in the 1950s
[1:50:05] I know I'm talking about I've done a lot
[1:50:07] of research on this Statistics even
[1:50:09] changes even with a lot of things being
[1:50:13] done
[1:50:14] I want to ask you how did that come
[1:50:17] about
[1:50:18] it came about because the church got
[1:50:21] away from the word
[1:50:23] you see if one position is vacated
[1:50:27] then it has an effect on other
[1:50:30] positions
[1:50:32] because one is the church what's the
[1:50:34] what's the duty of the church is the
[1:50:36] church to be a society of clubs is it to
[1:50:39] be a place that we just We Gather to
[1:50:41] have a good time
[1:50:43] what's the purpose of the Church of the
[1:50:45] Living God is to lift out the Lord Jesus
[1:50:47] Christ the purpose of the Church of the
[1:50:50] Living God is that there would be lives
[1:50:53] that are birthed into the kingdom of
[1:50:56] almighty God real motherhood
[1:50:59] that's the objective of the Church of
[1:51:03] the Living God but when they rejected
[1:51:05] Christ they rejected the mail they
[1:51:08] rejected his oversight with the word and
[1:51:11] said we will take it and do it our own
[1:51:14] way look at the effect that it has
[1:51:18] even to what we see going on in society
[1:51:20] today
[1:51:22] how sad that is and you know what
[1:51:23] brother Brown says when motherhood is
[1:51:25] broken the backbone of the nation is
[1:51:27] gone
[1:51:29] and that's been gone a whole long time
[1:51:32] ago
[1:51:33] a whole long time ago
[1:51:36] see it's where Society has come in and
[1:51:39] wanted to condition and I'm saying this
[1:51:41] for a point friends
[1:51:43] do you realize how blessed you are
[1:51:45] to be under the message of the hour to
[1:51:48] have a heart that that what does it do
[1:51:51] call you back to a rightful inheritance
[1:51:54] in Jesus Christ do you realize sisters
[1:51:57] how blessed you are because the world
[1:51:59] does not give you your rightful place it
[1:52:01] wants to strip you down put you out and
[1:52:03] have you prostitute your body out there
[1:52:05] and everything else and demoralize but
[1:52:08] the Gospel of Jesus Christ dresses you
[1:52:11] up and presents you as a real Trophy and
[1:52:14] a lady of God that's what the gospel
[1:52:16] really does
[1:52:18] but this world is a world that pushes my
[1:52:22] rights
[1:52:24] me too
[1:52:26] E2 YouTube
[1:52:29] that's that's the world we're not of the
[1:52:32] world
[1:52:34] we're not of the world that's what God
[1:52:36] has given us a message to call us out of
[1:52:38] this mess he gave us a message to call
[1:52:42] us out of the mass that's here
[1:52:45] and bring us back into our inheritance
[1:52:49] and it doesn't listen to me it doesn't
[1:52:51] mean that there's not challenges
[1:52:54] sometimes the challenges and the
[1:52:57] overcoming of God's grace is where you
[1:52:59] have to be willing we have to be willing
[1:53:03] to look face to face in the mirror and
[1:53:05] allow the spirit of God to comb through
[1:53:07] our lives and say God am I hindering You
[1:53:10] by complexes by past hurts from
[1:53:14] fulfilling the beauty you've called me
[1:53:16] to do
[1:53:19] God has a right example
[1:53:23] is everybody okay
[1:53:24] God's got a right example and God has
[1:53:27] set that right example
[1:53:29] it's just like if you take like a woman
[1:53:31] and she's been raised in a home where
[1:53:34] her mama trampled on Daddy
[1:53:36] and cut daddy down and did everything
[1:53:38] else it will take the grace of God in
[1:53:41] her life to realize that's not a true
[1:53:43] image
[1:53:45] that God never intended for me to be
[1:53:48] that way
[1:53:49] are you hearing me it'll be the same way
[1:53:52] if a boy was raised in a home and Daddy
[1:53:54] trampled on Mama it'll take God's grace
[1:53:57] in his life to realize he may not
[1:53:59] physically do anything but to realize
[1:54:01] wait a minute we're in this together
[1:54:03] submitting ourselves to one another in
[1:54:06] the fear of God
[1:54:08] whoa
[1:54:10] it's talking about positionally placed
[1:54:13] in Christ
[1:54:16] see God never gives us scriptures to use
[1:54:19] for our own just for our own own selfish
[1:54:22] motives
[1:54:23] it'll never work
[1:54:25] the word is meant to work in position
[1:54:28] and in season
[1:54:32] is that right whoo
[1:54:34] so we're all born for a purpose
[1:54:38] how many have heard this story about the
[1:54:39] little wash woman
[1:54:43] she got a burden on her heart and think
[1:54:44] about a wash woman I wonder how many
[1:54:46] times she complained about being a wash
[1:54:47] woman
[1:54:48] I'm quoting but I'm just gonna I'm gonna
[1:54:50] paraphrase it
[1:54:52] here she was she got on her heart
[1:54:54] God put something on her heart to do
[1:54:56] something
[1:54:58] for him
[1:55:00] and she rented out now I don't know how
[1:55:02] big it was Livery stable
[1:55:05] I don't think it was an Airbnb
[1:55:08] that had a nice pool in the background
[1:55:10] this was a livery stable this is history
[1:55:14] she rented that stable out
[1:55:16] and she cleaned that thing up
[1:55:19] brought benches in there
[1:55:21] and they invited a preacher to come in
[1:55:23] and preach a Revival right there
[1:55:25] and here was a boy with long hair comes
[1:55:28] right to the front that night and gives
[1:55:30] his life to God
[1:55:32] you'll know his name Dwight Moody
[1:55:35] she got a burden on her heart maybe
[1:55:37] that's the only thing
[1:55:40] that she ever was to do
[1:55:43] but the main thing is she served God and
[1:55:47] she was so in touch with God to when God
[1:55:50] said
[1:55:50] go get a livery stable probably like you
[1:55:53] and I she probably would have said
[1:55:54] Livery stable I don't even ride horses
[1:55:58] and go clean it up clean it up it's
[1:56:01] enough cleaning all the rest of these
[1:56:02] houses that I clean but I live very
[1:56:04] stable I gotta pick up horse manure and
[1:56:07] everything else and Matt that
[1:56:10] no Lord but you see friends listen
[1:56:13] her flesh was no different than your
[1:56:16] flesh or my flesh
[1:56:18] but what it comes down is to yielding to
[1:56:20] the spirit of God
[1:56:22] what a blessing it is to be in tune with
[1:56:24] his leading
[1:56:26] and follow what he has for us to do and
[1:56:28] that's why brother Adam says don't
[1:56:29] despise where God has you but serve the
[1:56:32] purpose that he has you therefore
[1:56:35] I want you to think about it let me read
[1:56:38] this quote out of out of the message
[1:56:39] influence
[1:56:41] but the brand says it's unscriptural for
[1:56:44] you or I to impersonate anyone else
[1:56:47] and that's why I say it like this
[1:56:49] I appreciate examples
[1:56:52] Titus talked about
[1:56:54] the Elder Brothers being an example to
[1:56:55] the youngers of how to be
[1:56:58] talked about the older women how to be
[1:57:00] an example to the younger women I think
[1:57:02] that's important friends
[1:57:04] we've talked about I really want to
[1:57:05] fulfill the word of God
[1:57:08] well how can we fulfill the seven seal
[1:57:10] and not fulfill that
[1:57:12] oh boy we're getting tight now aren't we
[1:57:15] but see what we're doing is we're
[1:57:16] wanting to skip
[1:57:18] God has called us and you know what I'll
[1:57:21] tell you just like I told my boy as I
[1:57:23] said I trust that the mistakes I've made
[1:57:26] you use them as stepping stones
[1:57:29] and I said when you start getting to
[1:57:31] certain Junctions in your life we'll
[1:57:33] have some more talks because I'll have
[1:57:34] some things that I want to share with
[1:57:36] you even in those times
[1:57:41] why I want I want their home I want it
[1:57:44] to be better
[1:57:46] I want them to start higher
[1:57:49] why should they make the same mistakes
[1:57:51] or have to go through the night we under
[1:57:52] we all have mistakes to make right but
[1:57:54] my desire is not for that it's that that
[1:57:58] our lives would grow would start in a
[1:58:00] higher place so I'm thinking in like
[1:58:02] this right here you know sometimes
[1:58:03] sister you can look at somebody else and
[1:58:05] say oh if I could just be like sister so
[1:58:07] and so young person middle-aged person
[1:58:09] something and you know it's not just the
[1:58:11] young people sometimes you look to
[1:58:12] another one well if I could just be like
[1:58:14] that and they look like the perfect
[1:58:16] example and this is what a housewife is
[1:58:19] to be and this and this and this and
[1:58:21] this and this listen God never called
[1:58:24] you to measure Yourself by somebody else
[1:58:28] he called you to measure Yourself by the
[1:58:30] word let every man abide in the calling
[1:58:34] wherein he was called
[1:58:36] man who
[1:58:38] a
[1:58:41] listen I don't expect my wife to be my
[1:58:43] mama
[1:58:48] I don't expect that I don't expect you
[1:58:50] to do everything like my mama did it or
[1:58:52] whatever more God gave me Grace to move
[1:58:54] beyond that a long time ago
[1:58:57] but we are all individual and neither
[1:58:59] does she expect me to be you know like
[1:59:01] her daddy or or anybody else or whatever
[1:59:03] more there's things we learned this is
[1:59:06] why the Bible I don't know I'm just
[1:59:07] going on this this is why the Bible said
[1:59:09] let a man leave father and mother let
[1:59:11] him cleave to his wife in other words
[1:59:13] God has brought that Union together and
[1:59:16] there should be a culture that is
[1:59:18] developed in that Union there is a
[1:59:21] uniting and a blending of two
[1:59:24] are you hearing me and you know what
[1:59:25] there's going to be some differences
[1:59:29] but that's part of the position we're in
[1:59:32] judah's inheritance didn't look like
[1:59:34] ephraims ephraims didn't look like
[1:59:36] nefertile
[1:59:38] it didn't look like them but they each
[1:59:40] had their inheritance is that right
[1:59:42] everyone positioned so I'm saying like
[1:59:45] this don't try to be like somebody else
[1:59:47] if there can be encouragements you can
[1:59:49] take from one another but you realize
[1:59:51] you can get in your own mind of what a
[1:59:54] of what a Christian is or what a
[1:59:56] housewife is and you can create an image
[1:59:58] that you or nobody else can ever live up
[2:00:01] to
[2:00:03] and you know what you walk around
[2:00:05] defeated
[2:00:08] are you hearing me abide where God has
[2:00:11] placed you
[2:00:14] be what you are and be a good one
[2:00:16] fulfill your purpose so others can see
[2:00:18] you if you're a housewife be a real one
[2:00:21] if you're a husband be genuine if you're
[2:00:24] a deacon be genuine there you go Deacons
[2:00:28] just wonder if you just want to get at
[2:00:29] them and if you're a
[2:00:31] dealer a preacher whatever you are
[2:00:38] your arm wants this church being like
[2:00:40] another church God don't want me as a
[2:00:42] pastor being like another Pastor every
[2:00:45] church is sovereign
[2:00:48] your home is Sovereign you have an
[2:00:52] opportunity to get in contact with God
[2:00:54] and the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:00:56] coming down in your home
[2:00:59] Hallelujah that's God's grace and don't
[2:01:02] let anything stand in the way of that
[2:01:04] purpose
[2:01:15] brother Brown when he talks about
[2:01:17] Moses
[2:01:20] talks about Moses life
[2:01:25] who did Brother Brown always give credit
[2:01:26] to
[2:01:33] well support helped him out a whole lot
[2:01:36] I could go on that angle but I want to
[2:01:38] run on that one today
[2:01:42] his mother
[2:01:47] the Bible tells us those scriptures we
[2:01:49] read last week
[2:01:52] that Moses even from the begins right
[2:01:54] there in verse 23 by faith Moses
[2:01:58] see that Revelation was already working
[2:02:00] it was in their heart
[2:02:01] he's here for a specific purpose
[2:02:04] God revealed it to him
[2:02:06] right it's like when the angel of the
[2:02:09] Lord came to Samson's mother and when
[2:02:12] his mother went and told Daddy Daddy
[2:02:15] said ask him to come again
[2:02:18] why that we may know how to order the
[2:02:21] child's footsteps
[2:02:23] oh my god's got a purpose and Lord I
[2:02:27] don't want us I don't want to Fumble
[2:02:28] stumble Bumble this up I want the angel
[2:02:32] of the Lord
[2:02:33] who brought and gave us this child
[2:02:36] I'm asking for your wisdom because you
[2:02:38] know what the purpose is you have for us
[2:02:40] so as as a Manoa said ask him to come
[2:02:42] again well
[2:02:44] you know with Mo with Moses mother go to
[2:02:47] the next scripture for me
[2:02:51] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[2:02:53] refused to be called the son of
[2:02:54] Pharaoh's daughter he still wasn't born
[2:02:56] again yet
[2:02:57] go to the next scripture
[2:02:59] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[2:03:01] from the people of God than to enjoy the
[2:03:03] pleasures of sin for a season still
[2:03:04] wasn't born again yet next scripture
[2:03:08] is steaming the reproach of Christ
[2:03:09] greater riches than the treasures in
[2:03:11] Egypt for he had respect under the
[2:03:13] recompense of the Roar still wasn't born
[2:03:15] again yet
[2:03:17] he refused he chose and he esteemed
[2:03:21] tell me
[2:03:22] who had the effect on his life
[2:03:25] you realize what a blessing it is as a
[2:03:27] mother when brother Brown would bring
[2:03:29] those dedications and he'd say
[2:03:32] and I said we don't believe in women
[2:03:34] preachers but you are the Fifth Gospel
[2:03:37] he said well you can be telling them
[2:03:39] Bible stories well I'm not a preacher
[2:03:41] we'll tell them the Bible story read
[2:03:42] them a Bible story brother Brown said do
[2:03:44] that rather than having them learning
[2:03:46] tap dancing classes of things that will
[2:03:48] take them further from God
[2:03:51] right brother got kids nowadays to know
[2:03:54] more about Davy Crockett than they know
[2:03:55] about Jesus Christ
[2:03:57] right
[2:03:58] so when I I look at within this right
[2:04:01] here
[2:04:02] I asked the question because it struck
[2:04:04] my heart I was when I was I was talking
[2:04:06] with the young people
[2:04:07] on Friday evening and uh just the way
[2:04:10] the words had come out and we were
[2:04:12] looking at it
[2:04:13] and I asked the question to them I said
[2:04:15] how do you think Moses mother was here
[2:04:17] she was in the house of pharaoh
[2:04:22] she wasn't in Goshen she was in the
[2:04:25] house of pharaoh you think that was a
[2:04:27] perfect scenario to be teaching the
[2:04:30] promises of God
[2:04:33] no I won a perfect scenario at all but
[2:04:36] you know what
[2:04:37] that was where God had placed her
[2:04:40] and she taught him the things of God not
[2:04:44] just teaching him but I asked this
[2:04:46] question to the young people because I
[2:04:47] realize these young people God Terry's
[2:04:49] they're going to be young men young
[2:04:51] women on and out and getting married and
[2:04:52] I said let me ask you a question how do
[2:04:54] you think Moses Moses Mom and Dad handle
[2:04:56] things you think they were passive about
[2:04:58] the message or you think they were
[2:04:59] intentional
[2:05:03] how do you think they were passive or
[2:05:04] intentional
[2:05:06] okay
[2:05:07] and you that's something that you have
[2:05:09] to interpret you have to look at and see
[2:05:11] that you know if we're passive we can
[2:05:14] things can be kind of manipulated and
[2:05:17] cut all around it would have never had
[2:05:18] this effect
[2:05:20] this is a young man that don't even have
[2:05:22] the Holy Ghost yet
[2:05:24] doesn't even have the Holy Spirit had
[2:05:26] never met God yet but the impact
[2:05:29] of an intentional and bringing God near
[2:05:31] had an impact on his life that when
[2:05:34] things got hard
[2:05:36] that God had skin on
[2:05:39] he could refuse certain things choose
[2:05:42] certain things esteem listen friends I'm
[2:05:44] not saying every child or whatever
[2:05:45] everything's going to be perfect and man
[2:05:47] everything but I am saying this right
[2:05:49] here what a blessing and a
[2:05:51] responsibility that as parents that we
[2:05:53] have and I say God bless you
[2:05:56] to the mothers and the sisters that
[2:05:59] would take that of the word of God and
[2:06:01] laying in and just standing right there
[2:06:03] and reminding and lifting up the
[2:06:06] promises of almighty God you say I don't
[2:06:09] think it's going to do any good it did
[2:06:11] with Moses
[2:06:12] it affected choices he eventually made
[2:06:15] and eventually that same Faith led him
[2:06:19] to the path of obedience direct quote it
[2:06:21] led him to a face-to-face meeting with
[2:06:23] God if they've got to go some way show
[2:06:26] them the way
[2:06:29] right just don't let them out there on
[2:06:31] their own Point them in the right way
[2:06:33] the Bible said bring up a child and the
[2:06:34] way it should go and when it grows old
[2:06:35] it'll not depart
[2:06:38] I say what a blessing what an
[2:06:40] opportunity what a blessing it is to be
[2:06:42] able to stand in position
[2:06:45] be able to hold the message of the hour
[2:06:47] and be able to Proclaim that Jesus
[2:06:49] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:06:51] forever I say God for every parent in
[2:06:53] here every grandparent every one of us
[2:06:55] and listen even if you don't got kids
[2:06:57] say God let me be effectual if I'm an
[2:07:00] older brother let me look up some of
[2:07:02] these young ones and be a factual Lord
[2:07:04] and be an example to them and do what
[2:07:06] the scripture has asked me to do
[2:07:09] all right
[2:07:10] glory be to God oh brother Samuel I
[2:07:13] don't got time for that well let me tell
[2:07:15] you something
[2:07:16] I think if God's word has asked for it
[2:07:18] and what a responsibility what a
[2:07:19] blessing it is I'd say that we should
[2:07:21] make time for God's word above
[2:07:22] everything else
[2:07:25] I said God help us
[2:07:28] God help us
[2:07:30] the message has positionally placed us
[2:07:32] and has let us know
[2:07:35] like me sister meaty said what can I do
[2:07:37] for God
[2:07:39] and here she was
[2:07:41] serving the purpose of God
[2:07:44] sending his clothes to the cleaners
[2:07:48] cooking the meals
[2:07:51] you sisters know that
[2:07:53] that even haven't
[2:07:55] come into that place of sister media I
[2:07:57] can't even imagine many times I
[2:07:59] I think about it
[2:08:01] I try to think about it in life and
[2:08:03] knowing just what she had to endure
[2:08:07] but you know what God called her to it
[2:08:09] it didn't mean it was easy
[2:08:12] are you hearing me God called her to it
[2:08:14] but it didn't mean it was easy just
[2:08:17] because God has called you to something
[2:08:18] does not mean it's easy
[2:08:23] but he will give you Grace and strength
[2:08:26] to fulfill what he's called you to do
[2:08:29] and when you feel like you can't make
[2:08:31] another step that's where you go to him
[2:08:34] and say Lord help me Lord right here
[2:08:39] if it got a little passive with things
[2:08:41] say God forgive me let me be intentional
[2:08:44] God first
[2:08:47] God first every decision we make every
[2:08:51] decision Let It Be how is this going to
[2:08:53] affect my walk with God our family with
[2:08:56] God
[2:08:58] that's the kind of lives we want to live
[2:09:01] intentional and positionally placed in
[2:09:04] Christ
[2:09:05] you see it takes Christ to bring forth
[2:09:07] what a real mother is
[2:09:09] it takes Christ to bring forth a real
[2:09:10] father that being in the land is where
[2:09:13] we're baptized into the Holy Ghost our
[2:09:16] purpose is to display Jesus Christ
[2:09:18] through a manifold body
[2:09:21] it's him it's God being displayed
[2:09:23] through a housewife God being displayed
[2:09:26] through a mother through a sister
[2:09:28] through a father through a husband it's
[2:09:29] God on discipline let me just say it to
[2:09:31] you like this
[2:09:35] it's ordinary purposes
[2:09:38] being fulfilled through extraordinary
[2:09:41] means
[2:09:44] ordinary purposes being fulfilled
[2:09:48] through extraordinary means
[2:09:50] it's Christ in you
[2:09:54] the hope of glory
[2:09:57] so don't despise where God has you
[2:10:00] don't look or if I could just be here if
[2:10:02] I could just do this or if I do what God
[2:10:05] has called you to do
[2:10:09] can I give one more example uh
[2:10:13] I don't want to go too much into this
[2:10:15] today but I think it'd be good to say it
[2:10:16] here
[2:10:17] there was a brother in the Tabernacle
[2:10:19] brother Brown comes to the pulpit
[2:10:22] and brother Bram talked to he he calls
[2:10:24] his brother out and he says brother
[2:10:26] he said you've been kind of struggling
[2:10:28] with what
[2:10:30] you've been trying to do some other
[2:10:32] things and here and there he said but
[2:10:35] he said if you can see it what God's
[2:10:37] called you to do
[2:10:38] is to sing
[2:10:40] he said now if you'll just yield to that
[2:10:43] God will use you he said I believe
[2:10:46] that's your purpose
[2:10:50] to me it's a powerful statement those
[2:10:52] little statements like those those are
[2:10:53] things of nuggets I put in a script bag
[2:10:55] for years and look back over those
[2:10:56] things you know why it didn't mean that
[2:10:58] that brother didn't battle
[2:11:01] one wonder if he battled the thought
[2:11:03] sometimes of am I singing too much
[2:11:06] but you see what it is God let him know
[2:11:09] this is your purpose
[2:11:11] every one of us have a purpose
[2:11:14] where instruments to be used by God and
[2:11:17] let me tell you this when you're not
[2:11:19] letting yourself be used by God and
[2:11:21] yielding to God in the right way
[2:11:24] you'll never have the victory that you
[2:11:26] need to have in your life
[2:11:28] even having the Holy Spirit God intends
[2:11:31] to use you and to operate through you
[2:11:34] are you hearing me
[2:11:37] let's pray
[2:11:41] Lord Jesus
[2:11:46] Lord I trust them
[2:11:50] oh God just the simplicity
[2:11:54] that Lord you would give to us in
[2:11:56] looking at these things to realize
[2:12:00] you don't want us
[2:12:02] to be like somebody else we don't have
[2:12:04] to be
[2:12:06] big something little something
[2:12:09] Lord the perfect scenario is truly
[2:12:13] just being yielded to you
[2:12:15] yielded to your voice
[2:12:18] a faith life that's what the Holy Spirit
[2:12:22] comes to produce
[2:12:24] and bring forth
[2:12:26] from every seed of God
[2:12:29] every bit of leaf every bit of apples
[2:12:31] everything
[2:12:33] that's in that seed
[2:12:35] or that comes out is already in it
[2:12:39] it's the spirit of God that comes to
[2:12:41] release it
[2:12:43] the father I pray here this morning
[2:12:47] that God for every one of the needs and
[2:12:50] for different ones through the body
[2:12:53] maybe there's been Lord
[2:12:55] thoughts because we all at times the
[2:12:58] Lord
[2:12:59] your Prophet even
[2:13:01] battled with that
[2:13:03] fought when he walked out of Oral
[2:13:06] Roberts
[2:13:07] facilities
[2:13:10] he looked at it but Lord I must not
[2:13:14] be able to be trusted by you
[2:13:18] but you told him look up I'm your
[2:13:20] portion
[2:13:22] it was in that moment that
[2:13:27] he yielded
[2:13:28] and said Thank You Lord
[2:13:31] he didn't live the rest of his days
[2:13:33] comparing himself to Oral Roberts
[2:13:36] or Billy Graham
[2:13:38] as a matter of fact Lord your Prophet
[2:13:40] would even say
[2:13:41] in three kinds of Believers he said God
[2:13:44] has placed you as a housewife he said
[2:13:47] and you would say I'm just
[2:13:50] a housewife
[2:13:52] but God
[2:13:54] has placed you
[2:13:56] just as he has evangelists prophets
[2:13:59] teachers on and on and on and on
[2:14:05] God I pray this morning
[2:14:06] maybe there's a mother that's here a
[2:14:08] father
[2:14:10] and Lord here they are as a father a
[2:14:13] mother and
[2:14:14] maybe Lord they've been and
[2:14:16] are being faithful Lord in that purpose
[2:14:20] may they not miss the main purpose
[2:14:24] and that's Lord
[2:14:26] to be born again
[2:14:29] to be surrendered Lord to you
[2:14:31] but their life might be filled with
[2:14:33] deity
[2:14:36] because the lord it's then
[2:14:38] that we really become positionally
[2:14:39] placed in Christ
[2:14:42] and then those attributes father mother
[2:14:44] all of those attributes farmer factory
[2:14:47] worker lawyer whatever it is
[2:14:52] it comes out of our life but it's Christ
[2:14:55] on display as a factory worker
[2:14:58] Christ on display as a housewife Christ
[2:15:03] on display
[2:15:05] as a farmer Christ
[2:15:08] on display Lord
[2:15:11] father I pray
[2:15:15] God may you just
[2:15:17] continue to give Grace the even the
[2:15:20] oppositions that come up Lord
[2:15:23] in our land of inheritance
[2:15:27] I pray that God that with each one Lord
[2:15:31] may they look to you Lord for what you
[2:15:33] have ordained for their lives
[2:15:38] we can Lord take examples we can take
[2:15:41] encouragement from one another
[2:15:43] that you don't want us to
[2:15:45] spend our time trying to be like
[2:15:48] somebody else
[2:15:50] but God may we give of the strength we
[2:15:54] have in yielding ourselves
[2:15:57] to you Lord
[2:16:01] I pray God you know everything about our
[2:16:04] lives
[2:16:05] and the purpose
[2:16:07] that you have us here for
[2:16:09] nor do we want to serve it we want to
[2:16:12] serve it well
[2:16:13] father I pray that you would forgive us
[2:16:16] Lord
[2:16:18] God I pray throughout this congregation
[2:16:20] this morning
[2:16:22] father may as we see the value
[2:16:27] and the privilege Lord
[2:16:31] that God as you have given to us
[2:16:33] children I thank the lord of the mothers
[2:16:35] as they sat here and Fathers as well but
[2:16:37] Lord if this being Mother's Day and how
[2:16:40] that opportunity Lord to
[2:16:42] be able Lord just to
[2:16:45] lay in the word of God
[2:16:47] just to express that Lord
[2:16:50] just to be their lord to nurture in the
[2:16:52] things of God
[2:16:55] through the hard times through the tough
[2:16:57] times through the teenage times Lord
[2:17:01] and as your Prophet told us in the
[2:17:03] beginning of indictment we must suffer
[2:17:05] through those moments Within
[2:17:07] God
[2:17:10] I believe we are called to be Overcomers
[2:17:14] so whatever opposition
[2:17:17] that is present
[2:17:19] may you Lord God I pray as we look to
[2:17:22] you give the grace that's needed Lord
[2:17:27] father
[2:17:29] you're a God who restores
[2:17:32] your God lord who mends what's torn who
[2:17:36] heals what's broken
[2:17:38] I pray fathers we just give ourselves to
[2:17:41] you and under this glorious message of
[2:17:44] the hour Lord that has been Lord God an
[2:17:47] imparting of our inheritance
[2:17:50] brings to light our position in Christ
[2:17:52] Lord
[2:17:54] help us father help each and every one
[2:17:56] of us Lord no matter the vocation no
[2:17:58] matter the calling Lord
[2:18:00] may we just Lord God of just
[2:18:02] surrendering our hearts and our lives to
[2:18:04] you that whatever capacity it is
[2:18:06] if it's like that little wash woman
[2:18:09] that what she did at that time was yield
[2:18:11] herself
[2:18:13] and here came a man by the name of
[2:18:14] Dwight Moody Lord
[2:18:16] oh God help us Lord I pray
[2:18:21] we love you and we thank you Father
[2:18:23] in Jesus precious name
[2:18:26] amen
[2:18:29] I tell you I always believe it be in
[2:18:30] order in anything we do
[2:18:36] I'll share with you just some things
[2:18:37] that I pray
[2:18:40] I pray and ask God to help me to be a
[2:18:42] better pastor and what I mean by better
[2:18:43] is Teach Me Lord
[2:18:46] give me the wisdom that I need in this
[2:18:48] season
[2:18:51] as a father
[2:18:53] I pray
[2:18:56] there's been a lot of situations as a
[2:18:58] father that
[2:18:59] I didn't know exactly
[2:19:02] how to deal with it might have things
[2:19:04] where how I felt like dealing with it
[2:19:08] but I've looked to God In Prayer have
[2:19:11] you been perfect no not been perfect
[2:19:13] so throw out that perfect scenario
[2:19:17] but I've learned
[2:19:19] and I'm still learning
[2:19:20] as a husband
[2:19:23] I've asked God
[2:19:25] help me to be a better husband
[2:19:27] Teach Me Lord
[2:19:29] teach me your ways
[2:19:32] help me Lord to be more sensitive
[2:19:34] help me in this season and this time
[2:19:37] as things change
[2:19:39] Lord help me
[2:19:41] in each of these moments
[2:19:44] now I'll tell you
[2:19:45] I know there's young people in here and
[2:19:48] I've said this throughout
[2:19:51] God's got a purpose and God's got a plan
[2:19:53] for your life
[2:19:57] God has all of this laid out as a
[2:19:59] purpose
[2:20:01] if you just let him lead you and guide
[2:20:03] you
[2:20:05] you might be going to college school
[2:20:07] career and
[2:20:09] you might have all these things but let
[2:20:11] me just tell you something don't ever
[2:20:12] make plans
[2:20:16] that Jesus can't interrupt
[2:20:20] say God above all things I want your
[2:20:23] will
[2:20:25] let me just tell you something I think
[2:20:27] everybody here parents would probably
[2:20:28] agree with me parents would probably say
[2:20:31] I'm in agreeing with that
[2:20:33] save yourself some loan money
[2:20:36] save yourself save your father and
[2:20:39] mother save some of that I know
[2:20:40] sometimes we had to go through saying
[2:20:41] things in our life but I'll tell you
[2:20:43] this if you'll just ask God lord what do
[2:20:46] you want me to be
[2:20:48] I believe God's got doctors
[2:20:50] I know he does
[2:20:51] God's got lawyers I know that's hard to
[2:20:54] believe that's a paradox I got some
[2:20:55] buddies and a lawyers pastors
[2:21:01] but see it's God
[2:21:03] operating through many different
[2:21:05] vocations
[2:21:08] and I just say like this remember if you
[2:21:11] can find that purpose that God has you
[2:21:12] for brother Brown says you save yourself
[2:21:14] a whole lot of trouble and God too
[2:21:18] just find that place
[2:21:20] and the other thing about it is you can
[2:21:21] save yourself some money too
[2:21:25] I know that kind of like got everybody's
[2:21:26] attention at the moment but I I say it
[2:21:28] in this way friends listen God's
[2:21:30] interested about everything of your life
[2:21:33] let him unpack and unfold through your
[2:21:36] life
[2:21:38] when God met Abraham there on the planes
[2:21:41] he unfolded to Abraham
[2:21:43] who he was
[2:21:46] he said Blessed Be Abram
[2:21:48] of
[2:21:49] the most high God
[2:21:52] and what you're going to need for this
[2:21:53] journey I'm given to you Bread and Wine
[2:21:57] on the day of Pentecost he gave us Bread
[2:22:00] and Wine
[2:22:01] he gave us what was needed for the
[2:22:03] journey didn't mean there weren't going
[2:22:04] to be some challenges and some
[2:22:05] oppositions
[2:22:09] things when we had my wife and I were
[2:22:11] having children and things
[2:22:13] I hope that's okay
[2:22:15] Paul firstborn
[2:22:18] AKA guinea pig
[2:22:23] we had this guy he was born in June and
[2:22:26] we had him bundled up like he was going
[2:22:28] to catch a cold
[2:22:29] it might have been some other source of
[2:22:30] influence on that one but
[2:22:33] we took him into the doctor and you know
[2:22:35] the doctor looked at us and we said he's
[2:22:37] getting like it looked like a little
[2:22:38] rash on his legs and things like that
[2:22:39] you know what the doctor turned the
[2:22:41] doctor came in there not only did we
[2:22:42] have him bundled up like that we had all
[2:22:44] the blankets
[2:22:46] we probably would have had a down
[2:22:48] blanket we'd have had that on then too
[2:22:50] the doctor said
[2:22:52] take this he took that whole zip up
[2:22:55] thing and left him in his ones he said
[2:22:56] that's all he needs right now it's it's
[2:22:58] it's summertime it's 80 some degrees out
[2:23:01] here you're going to burn this boy up
[2:23:06] you know what
