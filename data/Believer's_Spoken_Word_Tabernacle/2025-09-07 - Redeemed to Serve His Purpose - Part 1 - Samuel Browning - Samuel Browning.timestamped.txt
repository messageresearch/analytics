[8:24] morning. Just trust the Lord that he'll
[8:26] take care of that.
[8:28] Amen. There's an unspoken prayer request
[8:30] here. We want the Lord to answer. Uh
[8:33] someone they say, "I have a yes or no on
[8:34] a decision I need to make and they're
[8:36] just seeking the Lord for that answer."

[9:39] the reason he's not going to be here

[10:03] would like to have a meeting with Jesus
[10:04] this morning?
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does he mean more to you than
[10:07] anything else? That's why we come here
[10:09] this morning. Could have slept in, could
[10:11] have mowed the lawn, could have done
[10:12] anything else, but I'd rather be here at
[10:13] the house of God. Amen. Let's focus on
[10:17] him now. Let's just shut out the things
[10:19] of the world and all the pleasures and
[10:21] all the troubles and everything in this
[10:23] life and let's just look to him this
[10:25] morning for these prayer requests and
[10:26] for the service. Lord Jesus, we we we
[10:29] bring these things before you this
[10:31] morning, Lord. Lord, before anything was
[10:34] written down, Lord God, before before
[10:36] anything before this world even started
[10:38] spinning, Lord, you knew every trouble
[10:39] we'd ever have, Lord. Every trial we'd
[10:41] go through, Lord. So nothing catches you
[10:44] by surprise, Lord Jesus. So, but we you
[10:47] asked us to to bring these things before
[10:49] the saints, Lord, so that we could pray.
[10:51] He said, "We have not because we ask
[10:53] not." So, here we are this morning
[10:54] asking, Lord Jesus, and we have faith
[10:57] and we trust in you, Lord, that you'll
[10:59] undertake for every one of these needs
[11:01] that we've met read, Lord Jesus. And we
[11:04] don't ask for our will to be done, but
[11:05] we ask for your will, Lord. You know
[11:07] every situation. You know what's best
[11:08] for us, Lord. Uh but but until you give
[11:11] us a direct revelation about every
[11:13] situation, Lord, we go by the general
[11:14] orders as our brother said, Lord. So
[11:16] we're praying for healing, Lord. We're
[11:18] praying for salvation. We're praying for
[11:20] those to be lifted up, Lord Jesus, in
[11:22] their spirit, Lord. If anyone's having
[11:23] any kind of financial problem, any kind
[11:25] of trouble, Lord Jesus, I pray that you
[11:28] would uh grant them reprieve, Lord
[11:29] Jesus, and be their guide and comfort
[11:31] during these times. Lord, as our pastor
[11:33] brings, you see, Lord, also as many
[11:35] that's sick this morning, Lord, I just
[11:38] pray that those that couldn't be here
[11:39] this morning, Lord, you give a special
[11:41] blessing to them, Lord, our pastor's
[11:43] been studying for the word of God, Lord,
[11:45] to to bring it and preach to us, Lord,
[11:47] and we're looking forward to it this
[11:48] morning. We've come hungry this morning,
[11:50] Lord, and we're going to pull on the
[11:52] gift of God, Lord Jesus, and we're going
[11:54] to call on your name. And we believe
[11:56] we'll have a meeting with you here this
[11:57] morning. You are welcome Lord to come
[12:00] and make your abode with us today Lord
[12:02] Jesus. Just just be amongst us Lord. May
[12:04] your sweet Holy Spirit, your presence be
[12:06] amongst every child. In Jesus Christ's
[12:09] name we pray. Amen. Church says,
[12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.

[29:25] See if I can still do it in that key. I
[29:27] should be able to do that. Maybe go back
[29:30] up there.
[29:32] Rising up.
[29:35] Rising up.
[29:37] [Applause]
[29:38] There's a New Testament church rising
[29:41] up.
[29:43] Rising up.
[29:46] Rising up.
[29:49] There's a New Testament church rising
[29:53] up.
[29:55] As I look out across the land, I see
[29:59] God's mighty hand and the bride of
[30:02] Christ adorned in a wedding gown. How
[30:05] many sees that this morning? Well, just
[30:08] like in the days of old, they stood in
[30:12] courage b and they turned this whole
[30:15] world upside down.
[30:19] And we're rising up.
[30:22] Rising up.
[30:26] There's a New Testament church rising
[30:29] up.
[30:31] Rising up.
[30:34] Rising up.
[30:36] [Music]
[30:37] There's a New Testament church rising
[30:41] up.
[30:44] Now the Bible plainly tells how the Holy
[30:48] Ghost fell.
[30:50] Signs and wonders done by the apostles
[30:54] hand.
[30:55] Glory to God. Demon spirits were cast
[30:58] out in the jail. They sang and shout. I
[31:03] surrounded by God's holy angel baby.
[31:09] But if you think it's all long gone and
[31:13] the miracles are done,
[31:16] I have some good news to bring to you.
[31:22] He said, "In the last days, he'll pour
[31:26] on his spirit more and more. Like a
[31:29] mighty eagle, your strength he'll renew.
[31:33] Hallelujah. We're rising up.
[31:38] Rising up.
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] We're a New Testament church. Rising up.
[31:47] Oh, rising up.

[32:30] and we're rising up.
[32:36] Woo! Hallelujah.
[32:39] Hallelujah.
[32:40] Amen. We're ready for the word this
[32:42] morning. Amen. Praise God. We just want
[32:45] to make him feel welcome and Amen. We're
[32:47] looking forward to the word this
[32:48] morning. As our pastor comes, this
[32:50] song's been on my heart. I've been
[32:51] wanting to do this one. Amen. So, this
[32:55] song says, "Everybody will be happy over
[32:57] there." Amen. But I believe we've been
[33:01] given a promise. We can have some of
[33:03] that happiness on this side. We can
[33:05] smile and praise the Lord a little bit.
[33:08] Amen. So, I pray, Amen. God will grant
[33:11] us that this morning.
[33:15] There's a happy land of promise over in
[33:19] the great triumph where the saved of
[33:21] earth shall soon show soon his glory
[33:23] share
[33:25] where the souls of men shall enter and
[33:28] live on forever more. Everybody will be
[33:33] happy over there.
[33:36] Oh, I said everybody
[33:40] will be happy. Will be happy. Over there
[33:47] we will shout and sing God's praise.
[33:52] Everybody will be happy over there.
[33:57] There the ransom of all ages will be

[34:03] where no one ever knows or cares
[34:07] and the Christians of all nations will
[34:10] join in the triumph song. Everybody will
[34:14] be happy over there.
[34:18] Oh, I know. Everybody
[34:21] will be happy. Will be happy over there.
[34:29] We will shout and sing God's praise.
[34:34] Everybody will be over there.
[34:39] We will hear nobody pray and no mourning
[34:43] in that land. For no burden there will
[34:46] be for us to bear
[34:49] where all the people will be singing
[34:52] glory, glory to the lamb. Everybody will

[35:16] praises. Everybody's
[35:19] happy over there.
[35:22] And there I'll meet the one who saved me
[35:25] and who kept me by his grace. And he's
[35:28] brought me to that land bright and fair.
[35:33] church. I will praise his name forever
[35:36] as I look upon his face. Everybody will
[35:40] be happy over there. Hallelujah. Oh, I
[35:44] said

[35:54] there. Oh, we will shout and sing God's
[36:00] praise. Everybody will be happy.

[36:23] Everybody will be happy.
[36:28] Yes, everybody will be happy.
[36:36] Hallelujah.
[36:37] Glory.
[36:40] All
[36:41] my hope is in Jesus.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Oh yes Lord.
[36:53] Yes.
[36:55] is
[37:00] [Music]
[37:03] my s
[37:06] for
[37:08] [Music]
[37:15] thank you Lord. Yes father stand with
[37:17] me.
[37:19] [Music]
[37:22] Oh
[37:23] my hope is
[37:27] in Jesus.
[37:28] [Music]
[37:34] Thank God. Yesterday
[37:37] is gone.
[37:41] [Applause]
[37:43] All
[37:44] my sins are
[37:48] forgiven.
[37:51] [Music]
[37:56] been washed by
[37:58] his blood.
[38:00] [Music]
[38:01] [Applause]
[38:02] [Music]
[38:04] Wash by your blood.
[38:10] Amen.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you thankful for that this
[38:17] morning?
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thankful for the grace of God
[38:20] once again and
[38:22] thankful the Lord has given us then
[38:25] another beautiful day, another time that
[38:27] we can come together and so good to see
[38:30] each and every one of you and um
[38:34] we just want to continue to hold one
[38:35] another up in prayer. Amen. before the
[38:38] Lord that truly brother Brian mentioned
[38:41] it already once again and um
[38:45] sometimes when you think that all the
[38:47] sickness and thing is has passed and
[38:48] then you have another one but um
[38:53] God is gracious is faithful. Amen. And
[38:58] uh as I said before it's just reminders
[39:00] that we're here in our temporary body.
[39:03] This is not our inheritance. We still
[39:07] battle sickness. We still get down.
[39:10] As a matter of fact, Brother Bram says
[39:13] the way Satan will come at us is when he
[39:16] knows he can no longer get to your soul.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; He wants to get at that body and hit
[39:24] anywhere that he can. But you know one
[39:26] thing about it, you know, you can't even
[39:28] have a toothache unless he first gets
[39:30] permission.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; From God.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:35] You can't even have, you can't, nothing
[39:37] can come your way unless first Satan
[39:41] gets permission.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; And that's why the prophet tells us in
[39:46] victory day, think of the title of that
[39:48] message. He said, "When God gives you a
[39:52] test, a trial, it shows he's got
[39:55] confidence in you." I know sometimes we
[39:59] think, "Man, I wish he didn't have that
[40:01] much confidence.
[40:04] But it's just how we look at it, you
[40:06] know. It's how we look at it. But God
[40:08] gives us grace through every test and
[40:11] every trial. And I want to say I want to
[40:13] say it like this. You're still standing.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You're still standing. It's the grace of
[40:20] God.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It'll be worth it all.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it all every every bit of
[40:26] the way. Amen. Let's just go to him in a
[40:28] word of prayer.
[40:31] Heavenly Father, Lord, how thankful we
[40:34] are for these times, Lord, that we have
[40:38] to be able to come together,
[40:41] Lord Jesus. Truly they are are so
[40:44] precious, Lord, as we dear God, would
[40:48] come and gather with brothers and
[40:50] sisters of like precious faith.
[40:53] It's more than just being together
[40:57] with Lord our brothers and sisters. It's
[41:01] it's you. It's you Lord. And that's what
[41:05] Lord what we long for. That's the part
[41:08] as your prophet said. It's that love of
[41:10] Christ in us that loves Christ in our
[41:13] brother and in our sister.
[41:16] And so Lord, as we've come here
[41:18] together, you're the one who makes the
[41:20] difference, Lord, in this in this
[41:23] moment, this gathering, this meeting.
[41:26] Lord, I'm asking you, dear God, that you
[41:29] would grant every one of us the grace to
[41:31] be able to
[41:33] &gt;&gt; step beyond the cares of this life.
[41:36] Lord, sometimes they the pressures, the
[41:40] weights just of life itself
[41:43] can become so great, Lord.
[41:46] But Father,
[41:49] there's a place in you where we can let
[41:52] off the pressure.
[41:55] And I pray that Lord, here this morning
[41:57] that may you come by, Lord.
[42:01] Father, as we're gathered here in this
[42:03] place, may you touch each of our hearts
[42:06] and our lives. May the pressure, may it
[42:09] be released, oh God. May we, Lord,
[42:13] receive strength, Lord, that's needed,
[42:16] oh God. Whether it's the pressure from
[42:18] sin or the pressure just from the cares
[42:21] of life, Father, may you come, Lord.
[42:26] And Lord God, there be Lord a right
[42:28] release of that, Lord. strengthen Lord
[42:31] your children. May you minister Lord to
[42:34] not only those that are here but those
[42:36] that would be streaming Lord and Father
[42:39] would have to archive the service you
[42:41] see the different ones that are are
[42:43] battling with sickness Lord and
[42:45] recovering and we just ask that God that
[42:48] you would just continue to touch your
[42:51] children and give each one of them
[42:52] strength Lord different ones Lord that's
[42:55] come through surgeries and different
[42:56] procedures Lord be with them Lord I pray
[43:00] those that would be traveling God, be
[43:02] merciful, Lord. I pray. Watch over them,
[43:04] Lord. Lord, we ask that you just come
[43:07] now and and just
[43:11] give to us our daily bread, Lord.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, we need to hear from you. We want
[43:16] to hear from you, Father.
[43:18] So, we just commit this this moment,
[43:21] Lord, and ourselves into your hands in
[43:23] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:28] Amen.
[43:30] I want to go thank you musicians.
[43:34] I want to go straight here into
[43:37] the scripture and I'm going to
[43:43] reserve uh from reading from that place
[43:46] in Ruth where we were reading it. Still
[43:49] drawing the thought from there. Um,
[43:54] but I want to look here and come right
[43:57] back into the scripture and then we'll
[43:59] let you have your seats and and turn to
[44:02] some other places in the word of God.
[44:04] Amen. And in 1 Corinthians chapter 6
[44:07] verse 19 and verse 20,
[44:13] Paul said, "What know ye not that your
[44:16] body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
[44:20] which is in you which ye have of God?
[44:25] And ye are not
[44:27] your own.
[44:29] For ye are bought with a price.
[44:32] Therefore glorify God in your body and
[44:36] in your spirit which are gods. Now think
[44:40] of that redemption has all has come when
[44:43] when you have received the Holy Ghost by
[44:45] way of the new birth. Their redemption
[44:47] has come to one out of the three parts
[44:51] in your life. You're a temple three-
[44:54] room house. So one of those parts, the
[44:57] soul has been redeemed because what the
[45:00] soul is, that's actually God laying
[45:02] claim on what is his. This body, this
[45:07] body did not come according to God's
[45:09] perfect will, right? It came under sex
[45:12] desire, permissive will, the fall. It
[45:15] should have, everything should have
[45:16] taken place as far as our coming, our
[45:19] body. It should have come the way God
[45:22] intended it by the spoken word.
[45:25] Right? Then we have the the spirit
[45:28] realm. We received a spirit of the
[45:31] world, a human spirit. We bypassed our
[45:34] theophony, which that theophony is what
[45:37] will take the place of our human spirit.
[45:39] Can you fathom that? That one of these
[45:42] days when you stand there, I want you to
[45:43] think about it right now. You have to
[45:45] battle beyond and press beyond. And God
[45:48] gives you the grace to press beyond all
[45:50] of your memories,
[45:52] all your failures, everything. But
[45:54] you'll stand there in that theophony and
[45:56] that theophony will have no remembrance
[46:01] &gt;&gt; of those failures because that theophony
[46:04] is that word body.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And then this body, well, we're still
[46:10] going to dwell in a human body, but it
[46:12] will not be one that is come through sex
[46:15] desire. He will call, Job said, and I
[46:18] will answer. He will absolutely
[46:21] transform this body and it'll be a
[46:23] glorified body. We will be a three- room
[46:27] house. That's why when brother Brandham
[46:28] went beyond the curtain of time, they
[46:30] said, "We're waiting to return back."
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; We neither eat nor drink here. Is that
[46:38] right?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; We're waiting to return back. So, in the
[46:41] meantime, God redeems that part that
[46:44] belongs to him. And through that, God's
[46:47] light will press through in our lives to
[46:50] show his victory, to show his overcoming
[46:54] uh grace and in the molding of our
[46:56] character. And when all of that is
[46:59] complete, we go home.
[47:02] So if God would have thought it was
[47:04] necessary in order for us to live an
[47:06] overcoming life, to have changed our
[47:08] flesh, to have changed our spirit, he
[47:10] would have did it. But he said, "All I
[47:13] have to do is get the nature
[47:15] When I get that nature changed to where
[47:18] it's my nature, then the rest will come
[47:21] subject to that. Amen. You know what
[47:24] he's done? He's placed you as a son and
[47:26] daughter in charge. Amen. You love him.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's You can be seated. May the
[47:32] Lord bless his word. I want to turn to 1
[47:35] Peter chapter 2 and verse 4. And let me
[47:39] read this here and then I'll give my my
[47:41] title.
[47:43] Peter said, "To whom coming?
[47:46] As unto a living stone, disallowed
[47:48] indeed of men, but chosen of God and
[47:52] precious.
[47:54] Ye also as lively stones are built up a
[48:00] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[48:04] offer up spiritual sacrifices
[48:07] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ."
[48:12] Wherefore also it is contained in the
[48:14] scripture. Behold, I lay in Zion a chief
[48:18] cornerstone, elect, precious. And he
[48:22] that believeth on him shall not be
[48:24] confounded.
[48:26] Unto you therefore, which believe, he is
[48:29] precious. That's the truth, isn't it?
[48:31] Isn't he precious? But unto them which
[48:34] be disobedient, the stone which the
[48:36] builders disallow, the same is made the
[48:39] head of the corner, and a stone of
[48:42] stumbling, and a rock of offense, even
[48:44] to them which stumble at the word being
[48:48] disobedient, where unto also they were
[48:51] appointed. But ye are a chosen
[48:55] generation, a royal priesthood and holy
[49:00] nation, a peculiar people, that you
[49:03] should show forth the praises of him who
[49:07] hath called you out of darkness into his
[49:11] marvelous light, which in times past
[49:14] were not a people, but are now the
[49:18] people of God, which had not obtained
[49:21] mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
[49:26] I'd
[49:26] &gt;&gt; like to speak on this thought. Redeemed
[49:29] to serve his purpose.
[49:32] Redeemed to serve his purpose. You'll
[49:35] find that how Paul would write and
[49:38] bringing this in in many in many places
[49:42] especially in the letter to the
[49:45] Ephesians. He'll deal with it also in
[49:48] the book of um Thessalonians. You'll
[49:51] touch on these things even in
[49:53] Philippians and then through Corinthians
[49:56] and bringing it back to a place as we
[49:59] read in our opening scripture to
[50:01] recognize that we are indeed to be the
[50:05] temple or the dwelling place of almighty
[50:08] God. Remember God's rest. He said that
[50:11] he would he would dwell in a temple
[50:14] that's not made with hands. And you
[50:16] would say, "Well, brother Samuel, this
[50:18] right here has come about according to
[50:20] permissive will." That's true. But yet,
[50:23] there's not one person upon this earth
[50:26] that has not come come forth from and
[50:29] through and by a creative act. And yet
[50:33] within this, it's not so much this body,
[50:36] but it is the part that God actually
[50:39] lays claim on, which is that soul that
[50:42] come from him. That's why brother
[50:44] Brandon would tell us when you're
[50:46] looking at predestination so clearly and
[50:49] he would go into the message things that
[50:51] ought to be and he would make the
[50:53] statements. You hear it in the latter
[50:55] the latter messages. You you you hear it
[50:57] all the way through the message. Brother
[50:59] Brandon will really take into some real
[51:02] real um pointed statements there in the
[51:05] latter part and say this is why you can
[51:08] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[51:10] hour of your life and still be lost and
[51:14] go to hell because without that soul he
[51:18] said there in things that ought to be he
[51:20] said that soul is that real gift that
[51:23] come from God because that soul on the
[51:26] inside is that what God that's what God
[51:28] is working on. God's not trying to get
[51:31] our flesh perfected. He's not trying to
[51:33] get our spirit perfected. God works from
[51:35] the inside out. This is why that if
[51:38] anybody tries to start out here and and
[51:41] we're not talking about where you don't
[51:43] try, you don't apply the word when you
[51:45] know what what is right to do God has
[51:47] done and and brought that to your life.
[51:49] Then there is where that you take by
[51:52] faith and begin to apply the blood to
[51:54] your life to bring sanctification
[51:57] by the blood into your life. So there's
[51:59] an applying of that. We we we can't just
[52:01] say, "Well, I'm going to wait on God."
[52:02] Remember, Brother Bram says, "God will
[52:04] not push us through a pipe and pull us
[52:07] out on the other side." He said, "He's
[52:08] got amazing grace to save you, but
[52:10] you're going to have to fight for it."
[52:12] And he goes on and on in giving that out
[52:14] in Marriage of the Lamb. But where the
[52:16] Holy Spirit comes down is is there upon
[52:19] that soul to where that they're in
[52:21] redemption and he changes our nature and
[52:24] it begins to work from the inside out.
[52:26] And this is why that as he works from
[52:29] the inside out, God, he works to bring
[52:31] about uh change in our life. And you
[52:34] know, uh, I read a little thing here
[52:36] before. It was somebody sent me a little
[52:38] thing here the other day, the brother
[52:40] from overseas, and it was saying that,
[52:42] you know, when when God has come into
[52:44] your life, it doesn't remove the
[52:46] problems. The only thing that changes is
[52:48] is how you approach him.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; And so, that's a great difference in how
[52:52] that God would work in our life. And
[52:54] where where the spirit of God, he comes
[52:56] to abide in our life and to dwell and
[52:58] and to reflect himself through our
[53:00] lives. So, we've been redeemed in this
[53:03] life for a purpose. And I'm thankful
[53:05] because we could try to find our purpose
[53:09] in life. And man can try to um look for
[53:13] that and and and go to great lengths,
[53:15] but you know, our purpose can only be
[53:18] revealed by God himself. And that
[53:22] purpose, the whole purpose that we're
[53:23] here for, sure as father, sure as
[53:26] mother, we have different things,
[53:27] career, but that's not your purpose.
[53:30] your purpose, the main purpose is to
[53:33] serve God.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And that and the way that we serve God
[53:36] is we serve God by his spirit dwelling
[53:40] within us. That brings us back into the
[53:43] perfect will of God. And so I want you
[53:45] to think of this. Here we are. Paul
[53:47] would write of this on an individual in
[53:49] in this place of of the temple of the
[53:52] living God. And and Paul and Peter would
[53:54] write of this in First Peter chapter 2.
[53:57] and and to and to to express this that
[54:00] here we are as an individual temple yet
[54:03] we're part of the great temple of the
[54:06] body of Jesus Christ and we are also a
[54:09] priest under God in that temple. So, I
[54:13] want you to think of that here. We are
[54:14] as an individual temple. You're a three-
[54:16] room house. And yet, you are also a
[54:19] stone or a part of the economy of God or
[54:24] the body of Jesus Christ, the temple of
[54:26] God, that holy habitation that God has
[54:30] been building that he might dwell in and
[54:33] reflect his life through us. Now, I want
[54:36] you to think of this within when we look
[54:38] at this within worship. And I want to
[54:40] just read a few scriptures here. In
[54:42] Hebrews 13:15, it says, "By him,
[54:46] therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of
[54:50] praise to God continually." That is the
[54:53] fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his
[54:55] name. I want you to notice by him. In 1
[54:58] Peter chapter 2, we read this that as
[55:01] lively stones, you're built up a
[55:03] spiritual house, a holy priesthood to
[55:05] offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
[55:10] God by Jesus Christ.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; So here in John 4, he goes on Jesus here
[55:17] in John 4, remember at the woman at the
[55:19] well when she's asking this question,
[55:22] this was a desire within her to know
[55:24] concerning that of of worship. And here
[55:27] Jesus said, "The hour cometh, and now is
[55:30] when the true worshippers shall worship
[55:33] the father in spirit and in truth. For
[55:36] the father seeketh such to worship him."
[55:38] Now I want you to understand that Jesus
[55:41] is standing there as the very example of
[55:45] what a true worshipper is. Not only is
[55:48] he the God of glory, the living God, not
[55:52] only is he come uh to be that of the
[55:54] high priest, he he will enter into that
[55:56] office, but right then and there, he's
[55:59] reflecting what man's purpose was from
[56:03] the beginning. And that was to be a
[56:07] living temple of the living God's
[56:09] dwelling place where true worship, what
[56:12] would be a true worshipper? Would a true
[56:14] worshipper be someone that just that
[56:17] that comes to church? That's partly
[56:19] right. But yet that's not the full
[56:22] defining part. It's one who would
[56:24] worship him in spirit and in truth. So
[56:27] not just in spirit but also in truth. So
[56:31] to think about this, you know, when we
[56:33] talk about truth, I don't want you to
[56:35] get confined to where you think truth is
[56:37] just doctrine. But you know, you can
[56:40] worship God in spirit and in truth as
[56:43] the spirit of God will deal with things
[56:45] in your life to convict you to let
[56:48] things go. Hey, you need to approach it
[56:50] this way. God is leading us according to
[56:54] his character because truth is not a
[56:56] doctrine. It's not a written statement.
[56:58] Truth is a person.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the truth, the way,
[57:03] and the life." So even in that, you
[57:05] know, even when you brothers turn your
[57:07] head, that's worship. Do you realize
[57:09] that even when there's things that can
[57:11] rise up in in within, you know, a spirit
[57:14] get around you can, you know, try to
[57:16] rise up and you cause you to say
[57:18] something, do you realize worship is
[57:20] actually being able to stand right there
[57:22] and by God's grace hold your tongue?
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That's a worshipper. So worshiping is
[57:29] not oh how we don't want to just limit
[57:31] it to where it's just if our hands are
[57:33] being raised or we've got the right key.
[57:36] Worship is so much deeper than that. God
[57:38] meant for every moment of our life to be
[57:41] a worship unto him. Remember the quote I
[57:43] read to you last week 1963 why Christ
[57:46] speak brother said God goes to church
[57:49] every single day. God lives in his
[57:53] church and God reflects his life through
[57:56] his body. So, we're not just worshippers
[57:59] on Thursday or on Sunday. We are true
[58:02] worshippers. When we have been restored
[58:05] back to that purpose by the spirit of
[58:08] the living God, then we are true
[58:11] worshippers
[58:13] &gt;&gt; because it's Christ seated in his
[58:17] dwelling place.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; It's God who is seated there. And so now
[58:22] Jesus here in this scripture, he's
[58:24] reflecting on what true worship is. You
[58:27] know, one thing I love about God is God
[58:29] just doesn't leave his word open to
[58:32] interpretation. But God comes to
[58:35] interpret his word.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; He comes, you know why? Because every
[58:39] bit of our approach, you cannot approach
[58:42] God, remember brother Ram says they tell
[58:44] people to come to the altar and oh
[58:46] forget just let your mind go blank and
[58:47] let this brother Ram says you better not
[58:49] do that. He said you're allowable to get
[58:50] a spirit but won't be the Holy Ghost.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Right? So you come with your mind. and
[58:55] you you know what you're doing. You know
[58:57] whom you are approaching and you're
[58:59] coming there with that right approach
[59:01] that's been made. And so as you're
[59:04] coming there and and just channeling
[59:06] within that in in that place to know
[59:08] that there is there is something to
[59:10] where when we come to worship, we're not
[59:13] we're not just coming as far as into
[59:15] that of a building, but every single day
[59:19] of our lives, there is a worship that's
[59:22] to emanate from our lives. Now I want
[59:25] you to think of this here. Here Jesus
[59:27] said God is a spirit and they that
[59:31] worship him must worship him in spirit
[59:34] and in truth. So the Lord Jesus was the
[59:37] absolute reflection. The prophet says it
[59:39] like this in the message indictment. He
[59:42] was the example of what God intended
[59:46] every son and daughter to be. You
[59:48] realize Enoch only heard conversations
[59:52] of what Adam had. Noah heard those
[59:55] conversations,
[59:57] but they had not Adam could only relate
[1:00:01] those. Maybe they were together in
[1:00:03] fellowship because you realize there's
[1:00:04] an overlapping of their of how they
[1:00:06] lived and in their time frame and they
[1:00:08] could only have talked about that to
[1:00:10] hear how Adam would have described it.
[1:00:12] But God was not interested in sending a
[1:00:16] description. God comes himself.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's why when God sent this message,
[1:00:25] that's why this message, it's different
[1:00:28] from other messages.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; This message is not a continuation of
[1:00:35] Pentecost
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; because Pentecost did not have the full
[1:00:41] dwelling of the word of God in their
[1:00:44] midst. Right.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Supernatural had returned.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; That right.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; But but now but God's promise is I will
[1:00:52] restore. Pentecost was not the
[1:00:54] restoration.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; But the restoration is where that God
[1:00:59] would come and tabernacle once again
[1:01:02] within a body, a people that he has
[1:01:06] redeemed and be able to reflect his life
[1:01:09] through you and I. And there would not
[1:01:12] be one thing within the word that you
[1:01:14] and I would say, "Well, I don't agree
[1:01:16] with that." Because it's not you as the
[1:01:19] person, it's Christ in you agreeing with
[1:01:22] his own word.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; This is why this is the hour and the
[1:01:27] time of the adoption. It's the time of
[1:01:30] placing of sons and daughters of God.
[1:01:32] That's why it's Christ himself. He
[1:01:35] promised in this hour in the finishing
[1:01:38] of the mystery of God. And the mystery
[1:01:40] of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] in you in the very form of the person of
[1:01:47] Jesus Christ. Where now in this hour you
[1:01:51] could not have a marriage. Revelations
[1:01:54] 19. You could not have a marriage if you
[1:01:56] did not have a bride on the scene. But
[1:01:59] in this hour you have a bride on the
[1:02:03] scene. And there's been a uniting. You
[1:02:06] say, "What has brought the uniting?" It
[1:02:08] is Christ himself come down in the form
[1:02:11] of his word. And there's already been a
[1:02:14] uniting with Jesus Christ. We're not
[1:02:17] going to a wedding. We're going to the
[1:02:19] marriage supper.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Remember, Revelations 19 says it is the
[1:02:24] true sayings of God that are calling us
[1:02:28] back there and taking us to the wedding
[1:02:31] supper of the lamb. The next event is
[1:02:33] not the marriage that takes place here.
[1:02:36] It's Christ through an invisible union.
[1:02:38] He's making himself known to you like he
[1:02:42] did the disciples that were walking on
[1:02:44] the road to Emmas. What did he do? He
[1:02:48] came to them and begin to make known to
[1:02:50] them according to his word that he was
[1:02:53] the fulfillment of every promise. And
[1:02:56] when they could see that and he got in
[1:02:59] there among them and begin to break the
[1:03:02] bread, you know what he was doing? His
[1:03:03] bread is a staff of life. He's the
[1:03:05] lifegiver. Here he was revealing himself
[1:03:08] to them. And how they said, "Oh, did not
[1:03:11] our hearts burn within them?" Notice the
[1:03:13] effect that it had upon them. It caused
[1:03:15] them to move and merge into the promise
[1:03:19] of the word that Christ himself would
[1:03:22] come into that portion of the word and
[1:03:24] he would meet the worshipper under the
[1:03:28] blood and that life would be imparted to
[1:03:30] them. The Holy Spirit would come now to
[1:03:34] dwell and reside in redeemed vessels.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; What a privilege. Can you imagine as
[1:03:42] they walked out of the upper room, they
[1:03:44] now were a continuation of what had
[1:03:48] absolutely began in the body tabernacle
[1:03:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The prophets
[1:03:54] did not even have that kind of a
[1:03:56] privilege. the spirit would move on them
[1:03:59] and it would pull back because he could
[1:04:02] not abide. That was the defining factor
[1:04:04] of behold the lamb of God whom thou see
[1:04:06] the spirit uh uh uh descending and
[1:04:10] abiding remaining upon the same is he.
[1:04:14] So what made the difference this time
[1:04:16] was the spirit remained and dwelt there.
[1:04:20] And see what made that possible because
[1:04:22] it was that word his word had went
[1:04:25] forth. Here he was created in the
[1:04:28] likeness of sinful flesh, but yet he was
[1:04:31] he was the Passover lamb. And God
[1:04:33] himself creating that body, that blood
[1:04:36] cell, God came down and he claimed that
[1:04:39] that part that he created that through
[1:04:43] the shed blood of that innocent one, God
[1:04:46] coming down and become one of us, God
[1:04:49] might come back into position in the
[1:04:53] heart of man. That's what the baptism of
[1:04:55] the Holy Ghost is. It's the rest of God
[1:04:59] coming in your life. And you know what
[1:05:01] the rest is? The rest is where you are
[1:05:04] no longer working, but it's you ceasing
[1:05:07] and Christ moving.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It's God advancing his program
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; through your life.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And remember, he doesn't do everything
[1:05:21] like this. Right?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; God works. There's things sometimes that
[1:05:25] he'll it'll move right right through our
[1:05:27] lives like this. And then there's other
[1:05:28] times where it comes to certain places
[1:05:30] and it'll come to things. And what is
[1:05:32] God doing? He's bringing you from
[1:05:34] Jericho to Ai to the next city to the
[1:05:37] next city. And every city that you take,
[1:05:40] it will not be the same as the previous
[1:05:43] city.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because God wants to
[1:05:47] declare and not that we would ever get
[1:05:49] dependent in ourselves. That's what
[1:05:51] happened at Ai.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I got on this.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Remember Jericho? After Jericho's
[1:05:56] battle, look how pride look how pride
[1:05:59] blew him up. We don't need everybody,
[1:06:00] Joshua.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; This city ain't that big.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; You know, it ain't that big. We're just
[1:06:05] going to go up there. It was pride.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Pride had inflated. We know what Achen
[1:06:11] did. Pride. There was an effect. See,
[1:06:13] when when sin or anything that's
[1:06:15] unconfessed in your life, it'll it'll
[1:06:17] cause you to start leaning and resting
[1:06:20] to your own self, you're trying to make
[1:06:21] your own self, trying to do your own
[1:06:23] things, trying to cover your own tracks,
[1:06:25] trying to do everything. You were not
[1:06:27] meant to rely on your own understanding.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Listen, friend, this is where a part of
[1:06:34] our lives and maturity where we have to
[1:06:36] start. We have to have that discernment
[1:06:38] to look and say, "God, if I'm leaning on
[1:06:41] my own understanding, if I'm resting on
[1:06:43] my reasoning, I am out of my God-given
[1:06:47] grounds, your God-given grounds of
[1:06:49] authority is from the soul outward."
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Anytime you get in that spirit realm,
[1:06:56] you're probably going to be defeated.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us, he said, "If your
[1:07:01] reasoning goes along with God's word,
[1:07:04] then all right. But if your reasoning
[1:07:06] disagrees with it, cast it down.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Cast it down. I don't care how real it
[1:07:14] seems. I don't care how true it might
[1:07:16] seem. I don't care how it might seem to
[1:07:18] fit you like a god. That your reasoning
[1:07:21] is not what you're being molded to. It
[1:07:24] is the word of God that has been spoken
[1:07:26] over your life. And when you receive
[1:07:28] that word, listen to me now. The prophet
[1:07:30] says in greatest battle ever fought,
[1:07:32] "When you take that word in and that
[1:07:34] word," he said it moves and it moves
[1:07:37] down, what will it do when it gets down
[1:07:39] here? It has an atomic principle. It
[1:07:43] will blow out the flu.
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why taking in the
[1:07:50] word where the prophet said as you
[1:07:53] receive the word,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; you become the word.
[1:07:57] It's the word blowing things out.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; I'm going to try to get somewhere here
[1:08:04] today.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; So notice
[1:08:08] this reflection
[1:08:10] and how that God's approach to worship.
[1:08:13] Remember even when they would come there
[1:08:16] to the tabernacle, God would have these
[1:08:18] types set up in the Old Testament and it
[1:08:20] all spoke of Christ and the appropriate
[1:08:24] approach to worship. When the worshipper
[1:08:28] would come, there was waters of
[1:08:31] separation
[1:08:32] that the worshipper would be sprinkled
[1:08:36] upon the worshipper to cleanse them from
[1:08:39] defilement. And that's what the
[1:08:41] preaching of the word is. It's a washing
[1:08:44] of water by the word.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to hear me now. Not only
[1:08:49] is the preaching of the word does it
[1:08:51] bring conviction to the sinner. Not only
[1:08:53] does it bring a conviction to our life,
[1:08:56] not only will it expose sin, but I want
[1:08:58] you to understand anytime conviction or
[1:09:01] sin is exposed, it's because God is
[1:09:04] saying, "This is my temple, and I do not
[1:09:08] want anything else in this temple to
[1:09:11] hinder our relationship." He's a
[1:09:14] faithful husband over his house.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want his children tormented.
[1:09:20] Come on.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; He doesn't want them tormented. You were
[1:09:23] meant to live and walk in love.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And God, listen, God just don't want
[1:09:30] that to be a scripture in Ephesians 2
[1:09:33] that you're chosen before him in love.
[1:09:36] He wants you to experience and to know
[1:09:40] his love and that working in your life.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, sometimes the way
[1:09:46] that love is made known in your life,
[1:09:48] oh, it's even through the cleansing and
[1:09:51] the forgiveness where you look at and
[1:09:53] say, "God, forgive me. How did I make
[1:09:55] such a stupid mistake? Lord, forgive me,
[1:09:57] Lord, for this trap." And what is it?
[1:09:59] It's the love of God. And you what it
[1:10:01] is? It's a love that reaches beyond your
[1:10:04] knowledge of love. It's that love that
[1:10:06] reaches down. And what does it do? It's
[1:10:08] a sanctifying love.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love that reaches your life
[1:10:13] to where that all of the little things
[1:10:16] about your life that you feel like like
[1:10:18] that of a wife would say, "Well, I can't
[1:10:20] really do this well. I I can't do that
[1:10:22] well." But a husband is there to project
[1:10:24] a sanctifying love. Not to be dishonest,
[1:10:27] but to project a sanctifying love. Not a
[1:10:30] demeaning. God does not listen to me.
[1:10:33] God does not get from his children by
[1:10:36] demeaning them.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about?
[1:10:40] Everybody's had no doubt relatives
[1:10:42] that'll guilt you.
[1:10:44] They guilt you into talking to mom on
[1:10:46] the phone. Guilt you to talking to so-
[1:10:47] and so, guilt you about this, guilt you
[1:10:49] about that, guilt you guilt you. Guilt
[1:10:51] you guilt. God don't guilt you.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand that God
[1:10:55] don't operate that way because you know
[1:10:56] why? All you would do it is based on
[1:10:59] somebody else's guilt.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:11:03] So now when I want you to understand
[1:11:05] that that approach to worship as a
[1:11:07] worshipper comes now is to see the blood
[1:11:10] that has gone before and that he has to
[1:11:12] come under that blood. Now I want you to
[1:11:15] notice how that within this coming under
[1:11:17] that blood and coming back to that part
[1:11:20] of being a priest in the house of God.
[1:11:22] God said in Exodus 19, he said
[1:11:25] concerning Israel, "If you will obey my
[1:11:27] voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then
[1:11:30] you shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[1:11:33] above all people, for all the earth is
[1:11:37] mine, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom
[1:11:40] of priests and a holy nation." Now,
[1:11:42] notice God, we know that God would take
[1:11:46] the Levites, that one tribe, out of
[1:11:48] Israel. God actually took that tribe
[1:11:51] from among the other tribes to serve
[1:11:54] within the tabernacle. Now some of them
[1:11:58] what their whole purpose is you had
[1:12:00] porters you had doorkeepers you had
[1:12:02] different ones. Some some of them their
[1:12:05] responsibility was not not about music.
[1:12:08] Some of them had music. Others of them
[1:12:10] had you know uh uh the to be responsible
[1:12:12] for making sure that the fine flour was
[1:12:15] present that the oil and that all
[1:12:17] everything with the apocryphe that was
[1:12:19] that was followed correctly and and how
[1:12:21] the how bringing all the different herbs
[1:12:23] together. Each one of them had their own
[1:12:25] responsibility because it shows that
[1:12:28] this tabernacle is not something that
[1:12:31] could be manned by one man. Yet, here's
[1:12:35] here's the powerful thing. In the body
[1:12:37] of Jesus Christ, it is Christ that
[1:12:41] empowers you and I, strengthens you and
[1:12:44] I, and then turns around, lays a burden
[1:12:47] on your heart to do something.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; And you respond to that, and at the end
[1:12:54] of the road, you get rewarded.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; And it's all under his administration.
[1:12:59] It's all under his spirit. But he's
[1:13:02] using his body. God could do it all. God
[1:13:05] could just simply say, "You know what
[1:13:06] y'all do? I'll tell you what. Instead,
[1:13:08] in my tabernacle, we're going to have
[1:13:10] nothing but lazy boys set up down this
[1:13:11] side. We'll have them set up this side.
[1:13:13] Have some little L couches. I'll have
[1:13:15] some waiters in here. We'll just, you
[1:13:16] know, I'll tell you what. After I've
[1:13:17] redeemed you, y'all just sit around and
[1:13:19] you don't need you don't need to do
[1:13:20] nothing." But the reality of it is God
[1:13:23] wants to display his redemption. That's
[1:13:26] what the purpose that you and I were
[1:13:29] brought here for. And so God will
[1:13:31] inspire our hearts by his presence. This
[1:13:34] is why friends as I said before guilting
[1:13:37] guilting never works you. This is why
[1:13:39] the you know even when you talk about
[1:13:41] burdens and things like that a burden
[1:13:43] can be a tricky word because someone can
[1:13:46] say well I you know I'm burdened and
[1:13:48] nobody likes to feel within that part of
[1:13:50] burden. There's a heaviness within it.
[1:13:52] But when God gives you a burden to do
[1:13:55] something, that burden is there is a
[1:13:58] supernatural part within that to where
[1:14:00] that even when you don't feel like doing
[1:14:04] it. But it is a burden of the Lord that
[1:14:07] will propel you onward.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; So, you know, I mean, this is why even
[1:14:15] over the years of things, I don't want
[1:14:17] to just ask people, will you do this and
[1:14:19] do this and do that? Because because if
[1:14:21] it is, it's constant prepping. It's
[1:14:23] constant moving. It's constant. It's
[1:14:25] constant. But I believe that God gives
[1:14:27] burdens to his people.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because God's not
[1:14:31] called us to be a prod. We always got a
[1:14:33] prod. But it's the burden. It's got to
[1:14:36] be a burden. And when it's a burden,
[1:14:38] it's Christ that has initiated that
[1:14:41] burden in our heart. And you can't get
[1:14:44] away from that burden. No matter what
[1:14:46] takes place, there is a burden in your
[1:14:50] life from God.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And truly, when God places a burden in
[1:14:56] your heart, you're never going to feel
[1:14:58] like, well, I can do it. But you'll
[1:15:00] you'll have a burden to do it and say,
[1:15:02] Lord, what little I can do, I'm going to
[1:15:04] do it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:06] Now, so God in being a kingdom of
[1:15:08] priests, this scripture, God would take
[1:15:10] all of Israel, not just the Levites, but
[1:15:14] all of Israel would be designated to God
[1:15:18] as a priest, a kingdom of priest, a holy
[1:15:21] nation, a peculiar. It don't mean odd
[1:15:23] acting. It means people who absolutely
[1:15:26] have a display that they belong to
[1:15:28] somebody.
[1:15:30] Remember what what what it was that
[1:15:32] separated Israel from the rest of the
[1:15:35] people through the land. What was it
[1:15:37] when when when when Balam stood up
[1:15:39] there? Va Balum, he had everything
[1:15:42] correct. Seven altars, seven bulocks. Oh
[1:15:46] my. He had anointing. That man had
[1:15:49] discernment. He had dreams right on the
[1:15:53] dot.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But yet it was a false
[1:15:57] prophet. Right.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But see how God See how God permitted
[1:16:01] all that? You say, "Why did God why
[1:16:03] didn't he just take all that out of the
[1:16:05] way?" But God allowed the wilderness
[1:16:07] journey
[1:16:09] to prove what was in the heart.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we look at things, you know,
[1:16:14] in a manner and say, you know, we
[1:16:16] realize, yes, we come over the Jordan.
[1:16:18] You always got to watch your types. We
[1:16:20] come over the Jordan in that of the
[1:16:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yet the type
[1:16:25] of being in the wilderness as far as
[1:16:26] journey into my father's house are many
[1:16:29] mansions to the other side. We're still
[1:16:31] in that wilderness journey. And God
[1:16:34] allows trials. He allows situations to
[1:16:37] come about. This is why through the
[1:16:39] journey in Israel's journey, situations
[1:16:41] would prop up. Listen friends, it didn't
[1:16:44] take very long. There was some people
[1:16:45] that started out. Praise God. Glory to
[1:16:48] God. We're free from that bondage. To
[1:16:50] them, the message of Moses was only
[1:16:53] ammunition against government tyranny.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; They did not understand what the message
[1:17:00] was about.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; They were like spiritual hippies.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; They didn't want anybody telling them
[1:17:07] what to do. And yet, the word that
[1:17:09] brought them out is the very same word
[1:17:12] that was sent to take them in. But not
[1:17:14] everybody was going to be a part of that
[1:17:16] promise. But God never went through and
[1:17:19] said, "You're not a part. You're not a
[1:17:20] part. You're not a part. You're a part.
[1:17:22] You're not a part." God don't work that
[1:17:24] way. God just keeps manifesting his
[1:17:27] word. And the conditions of time, the
[1:17:30] test and the trials that come. Listen
[1:17:32] friends, there's tests and trials that
[1:17:34] will come. You have faced that shake you
[1:17:37] to your core to where you're ready to
[1:17:39] give up. Like the prophet said, "If
[1:17:42] that's the way he's going to be, I was
[1:17:44] about ready to say that." But there was
[1:17:47] an anchor on the inside.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why would God do that?" God is
[1:17:53] interested in proving in you as
[1:17:56] Abraham's seed like he did on Mount
[1:17:58] Mariah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; God knew that lay in Abraham the whole
[1:18:02] time.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; But God allows the tests and trials to
[1:18:05] come for what? What's on the inside
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; to emanate through the spirit
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; and through the body.
[1:18:17] Now watch here just a moment how God
[1:18:20] would set this forth with this kingdom
[1:18:23] of priests. God having a people from
[1:18:26] from all of the earth, he would bring
[1:18:28] these people to himself. Now notice in
[1:18:32] in the book of if we can go to it in
[1:18:34] this way, if you'll notice in the
[1:18:36] scriptures, uh if you turn with me, turn
[1:18:39] with me to Hebrews chapter 7. And I I
[1:18:41] don't I didn't put this up there because
[1:18:42] I didn't really know exactly how much I
[1:18:44] wanted to read out of this, but Hebrews
[1:18:47] chapter 7.
[1:18:49] And I want to pull from here just a
[1:18:50] moment because
[1:18:53] in this priesthood
[1:18:56] that God himself
[1:18:58] set up this Levitical priesthood, these
[1:19:02] men had to offer sacrifices
[1:19:04] for their own sin as well as for the
[1:19:06] people.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Right? But God allowed God set these
[1:19:10] types speaking of an antitype to come.
[1:19:13] And here Paul, my goodness, how Paul
[1:19:15] would set this forth within it. And Paul
[1:19:18] would deal with how in Hebrews 7, the
[1:19:21] coming of the transition of a change in
[1:19:24] priesthood. And Paul would here begin in
[1:19:28] the first three verses of of of Hebrews
[1:19:31] 7. And he would deal with this Melzdc.
[1:19:34] And he would speak of Abraham's meeting
[1:19:36] with him. And in verse three he would
[1:19:38] say without father without mother
[1:19:41] without descent neither having beginning
[1:19:43] of days nor end of life but made like
[1:19:45] unto the son of god abideth a priest
[1:19:48] continually. So there's no other one
[1:19:51] when you look in verse in verse two he's
[1:19:53] king of righteousness king of peace or
[1:19:56] king of salem which is king of peace.
[1:19:58] This was none other than the prefigure
[1:20:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ, which God
[1:20:04] himself, the invisible God, stepped down
[1:20:07] in morphe and made himself known there
[1:20:11] in theophony in the midst of the king's
[1:20:15] dale where Abraham has returned from the
[1:20:19] battle
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; there of Gideon Lot and all the rest of
[1:20:23] the kings and their possessions. And I
[1:20:26] want you to think about this for a
[1:20:27] moment. Everybody with me?
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; I often I I just ponder this. I I ponder
[1:20:32] that Genesis 14 here is all these other
[1:20:34] kings. The king of Lady Osia, the king
[1:20:37] of Chalomar, the king of this, the king
[1:20:39] of this. And these kings are actually
[1:20:42] offering Abraham
[1:20:45] things.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Let us pay you. Let us give you this.
[1:20:49] Let us give you that. And Abraham shows
[1:20:52] the motive that was behind it all. He
[1:20:56] said, "I I'm not going to take a shoe
[1:20:58] latchet lest you should say
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; so that there wouldn't be nothing
[1:21:03] attached to it." And in the presence of
[1:21:06] all of those kings, kings are rulers.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Kings are rulers.
[1:21:11] And in the presence of it, it's almost
[1:21:13] as though that everything itself, there
[1:21:15] comes a silencing of all of that's
[1:21:18] around him. And there's a private
[1:21:20] meeting with Abram and Melzdc. And this
[1:21:25] is where that Abraham receives the the
[1:21:28] the proclamation because when he meets
[1:21:31] Melzdc, he brings to him a tithe, a
[1:21:35] tenth of the spoil. Why didn't he give a
[1:21:38] tithe to any of those other kings?
[1:21:42] What was the difference about this king
[1:21:44] than any other one?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; What was the difference? I'll tell you
[1:21:49] what the difference was. The difference
[1:21:51] was is Abraham was a seed elect of God
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; and he could recognize God's provided
[1:21:59] way when it was revealed to him. He was
[1:22:02] not Abraham did not look at Melazdc as
[1:22:05] just somebody else. But notice when he
[1:22:07] gave the tenth, you know what that was
[1:22:09] in the king's lands in that time to give
[1:22:11] a tenth to take a tithe. It was to give
[1:22:14] that of an honor to bestow or to
[1:22:16] recognize one whom is there.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Are you realize? Because you see,
[1:22:22] somebody could have gave tithes to
[1:22:24] somewhere else. They could have gave
[1:22:25] tithes to the shopkeeper, but it would
[1:22:27] have never been allotted to their
[1:22:29] account.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Like brother Ram explains
[1:22:32] it. Well, you know, uh, brother Ram, if
[1:22:33] I have my ties, can I go ahead and give
[1:22:34] it to this poor widow woman? Brother Ram
[1:22:36] says, no, you take out of this pocket
[1:22:37] and give to her, but give your tithings
[1:22:39] unto God in the house of God. See, you
[1:22:41] don't bring your tithings to a pastor.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; You don't bring your tithings to a
[1:22:46] pastor. You bring your tithings, it's
[1:22:49] unto God.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me friends? It because
[1:22:53] in reality that that is even when we do
[1:22:56] that, that's only a symbol of what God
[1:23:00] actually asks in our own lives. That God
[1:23:03] desires a tithe of our life. He desires
[1:23:06] our soul. And then once the soul then
[1:23:10] God said remember tithes and offerings
[1:23:12] then our spirit and our body becomes the
[1:23:16] offering
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; along with the tithe of our soul
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and an offering remember there's not a
[1:23:22] determined amount
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; a tithe is a tenth of all but there an
[1:23:29] offering well the offering you know
[1:23:31] remember you give a the Bible would
[1:23:32] always define that it's according to
[1:23:34] your heart
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; right five however ever your heart says.
[1:23:39] Anybody want to write $5,000? Praise
[1:23:41] God.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; We can use it for what we're doing.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; But you understand it's an offering. But
[1:23:45] friends, that's only that that's only a
[1:23:47] type of what it would be within our
[1:23:49] lives. That's
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; But notice where Abraham is. It's like a
[1:23:55] silent meeting is taking place right
[1:23:57] here where everything all their voices
[1:24:00] are being silenced out. You don't even
[1:24:03] hear it. All of this is taking place.
[1:24:05] And what is happening is is a special
[1:24:08] meeting with Melzdc. Now I want to
[1:24:11] remind y'all, brother Brown will
[1:24:12] continue to go over this. He said
[1:24:14] Abraham met me Melzdc after the battle
[1:24:19] was over.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; But before he got back home, you see
[1:24:26] before we get to the wedding supper,
[1:24:29] we'll meet Jesus in the air.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? After the battle is
[1:24:33] over, after the toils are over, that's
[1:24:35] the same way. After the battle is over,
[1:24:37] the wrestling out with sin, the
[1:24:39] wrestling out with yourself, then Melzdc
[1:24:43] reveals himself to be your sustainer of
[1:24:46] the bread and the wine, just exactly
[1:24:48] what you have need of, the life and
[1:24:51] revelation of the word operating in your
[1:24:54] life.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Blessed be thou Abram of the most high
[1:25:00] God.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] not of this one and this one and this
[1:25:04] one, but this is who you're really of.
[1:25:06] This is the the person of Melazdc. This
[1:25:09] is none other than God, the prefigure of
[1:25:12] of Jesus Christ. It's the tree of life
[1:25:15] that is speaking to one of his branches.
[1:25:18] Blessed be Abram
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; of the genetics, the DNA, the election,
[1:25:24] the predestinated plan of God.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And Abraham recognized it. And that's
[1:25:32] why the prophet said what Abraham did
[1:25:34] there shows what every predestinated son
[1:25:37] will do in the end time.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; When you recognize
[1:25:42] mec
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; and you recognize it to be eagle food,
[1:25:47] you leave that other thing and you
[1:25:51] cleave to this word.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; It's more than life to you. lady will
[1:25:56] see and said, "Here, I can make you
[1:25:57] this. I can make you this offer. We can
[1:26:00] make it more cushy." But the elect of
[1:26:02] Abraham's seed, oh, the pull. Oh, the
[1:26:05] pool. Because Abraham was pulled. You've
[1:26:07] seen it in other chapters. God allowed
[1:26:09] that to be shown to you and I. So you
[1:26:11] and I could look to the grace of God and
[1:26:13] be able to relate to that. There would
[1:26:16] be a pull to want to give in. Even
[1:26:19] sometimes if you have, the grace of God
[1:26:22] will not allow you to be content in that
[1:26:25] situation.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "If you
[1:26:28] once ever served God and you go away,
[1:26:31] you cannot until you get back in your
[1:26:33] place, it'll haunt you until you get
[1:26:36] back to where you belong
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; because you're off your God-given
[1:26:41] ground.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Your God-given ground is in Christ.
[1:26:48] And here Abraham,
[1:26:50] he surrenders. Now I want to bring this
[1:26:53] here and we'll try to get to I'm trying
[1:26:55] to get to a place here. In Hebrews
[1:26:59] 7 and 11,
[1:27:02] Paul said,
[1:27:04] "If therefore perfection
[1:27:07] were by the Levitical priesthood, for
[1:27:10] under the people received the law, what
[1:27:12] further need was there that another
[1:27:15] priest should arise after the order of
[1:27:18] Melzdc and not be called after the order
[1:27:20] of Aaron? For the priesthood being
[1:27:23] changed, there is made of necessity a
[1:27:26] change also of the law. Verse 13, for he
[1:27:31] of whom these things are spoken
[1:27:33] pertainth to another tribe, of which no
[1:27:35] man gave attendance at the altar. For
[1:27:37] it's evident that our Lord sprang out of
[1:27:40] Judah, of which tribe Moses spake
[1:27:42] nothing concerning the priesthood. And
[1:27:46] it is yet far more evident for that
[1:27:48] after the similitude of Melzdc there
[1:27:51] arose another priest who is made, this
[1:27:54] is important, verse 16, not after the
[1:27:57] law of a carnal commandment, but after
[1:28:00] the power of an endless life, for he
[1:28:03] testifith, thou art a priest forever
[1:28:07] after the order of Melzdc.
[1:28:11] This man is life himself.
[1:28:15] Jesus gave his life. But it was God come
[1:28:19] down. Our Melzdc, the same God who met
[1:28:24] Abraham. He came down in the form and
[1:28:27] the body of Jesus Christ. It was here
[1:28:30] Melzdc right here among his children
[1:28:35] revealing himself
[1:28:38] to his elect.
[1:28:42] And on the day of Pentecost, they
[1:28:44] received bread and wine.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Here we find the revealing. So notice
[1:28:52] God could have all this was made known.
[1:28:55] You can think how this no doubt it
[1:28:57] puzzled so much even with the Jews and
[1:28:59] so forth. Here you have the Levitical
[1:29:00] priesthood, Levitical priesthood,
[1:29:02] Levitical priesthood. But all of that
[1:29:03] was a type.
[1:29:06] But there was coming a priesthood that
[1:29:08] did not have a beginning in time.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; It was that which was from eternity.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Before the devil was ever created,
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; before there was ever any unbelief in
[1:29:24] the mind of God, the lamb was already
[1:29:27] slain because the names were put on the
[1:29:30] lamb's book of life before the
[1:29:32] foundation of the world. So where is
[1:29:35] that lamb's book of life? That lamb's
[1:29:37] book of life was in God's thoughts,
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; God's heart, God's loin,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; and God himself, he what does he do
[1:29:46] through that form of Melzdc? As he
[1:29:48] reveals himself as the living God, as
[1:29:51] the king and priest of the most high
[1:29:53] God, God coming down among us, what does
[1:29:56] he do? He begins to reveal the names of
[1:30:00] his children. He begins to reveal the
[1:30:03] perfect will and purpose of God for our
[1:30:06] lives.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what this means by
[1:30:09] this Melzdc?
[1:30:11] This is not a man going back into
[1:30:14] theories. This priest said this, this
[1:30:17] priest said this, this priest said this,
[1:30:19] this priest said this. This Melzdc is
[1:30:22] that same pillar of fire.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; So now we're not going back through a
[1:30:28] man. What happens now is with Melzdc,
[1:30:30] the pillar of fire, it bypasses all the
[1:30:33] traditions of man and takes us clear
[1:30:35] back to the origin to the very mind of
[1:30:38] God to Christ himself. So it's not man's
[1:30:42] mind. It's not reasoning that's casting
[1:30:45] out fear. It's perfect love that's
[1:30:48] casting out all fear.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:58] So God coming down to become one of us.
[1:31:01] And Melkazedc
[1:31:03] here, he comes down when he takes upon a
[1:31:05] body of flesh. What tribe does that body
[1:31:09] spring from? Well, God created both
[1:31:12] blood, blood, and there of egg and
[1:31:15] sperm. God created that tabernacle, but
[1:31:17] it sprang out of Judah. How fitting
[1:31:20] because Judah means praise.
[1:31:24] It would come through God becoming one
[1:31:27] of us. Even at his birth, praise was
[1:31:30] offered up. There was worship. The
[1:31:33] angels were singing, right? There was
[1:31:35] such joy. Oh, joy to the world. There
[1:31:38] was such praise, such adoration of of of
[1:31:41] of who is among us and who is born. And
[1:31:44] it would only be the beginning of that
[1:31:46] praise and adoration because God would
[1:31:50] bring that praise into the heart of a
[1:31:53] people that would not just be a praise
[1:31:56] where they would journey on a holy day
[1:31:58] or on a feast day or on a new moon or
[1:32:01] under this requirement, but it would be
[1:32:03] a praise that would rain inside of your
[1:32:05] heart. You would not be journeying to
[1:32:08] the tabernacle to behold the shakina
[1:32:11] glory and God's presence. But now you
[1:32:14] have become a tabernacle of the living
[1:32:17] God and the shakina glory. You're a part
[1:32:20] in the in the economy of God has been
[1:32:23] deposited in your soul by the baptism of
[1:32:27] the Holy Ghost. And you know I'm not my
[1:32:29] own. I'm not the same. No, I can't
[1:32:32] explain everything. But I know one
[1:32:34] thing. There is something that changed
[1:32:37] in my life. The only thing I am obsessed
[1:32:40] with is I want to please him.
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Titus 2, let me skip just to verse 14.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; This is what our high priest did. He
[1:32:59] gave himself for us that he might redeem
[1:33:03] us from all iniquity
[1:33:07] and purify unto himself a peculiar
[1:33:10] people zealous
[1:33:14] of good works.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Revelations chapter 1 verse 5 and 6. and
[1:33:21] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[1:33:24] witness and the first begotten of the
[1:33:26] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[1:33:29] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[1:33:34] us from our sins in his own blood
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; hath made us kings and priests unto God
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; and his father
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; to him be glory and dominion forever and
[1:33:50] ever. Amen. So now God what he's laid
[1:33:54] down in type of Israel being a peculiar
[1:33:58] people, a kingdom of priests, a nation,
[1:34:03] then out of that God would take the
[1:34:06] Levites. It would narrow down.
[1:34:09] Then all of that was speaking of of when
[1:34:13] God himself
[1:34:16] was actually coming to redeem and bring
[1:34:20] to himself
[1:34:22] that hidden part that's laid through
[1:34:26] redemption
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; all the way down through the scriptures
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; which come clear all the way from go
[1:34:33] from the garden of Eden. God begins to
[1:34:35] show it even in Eden. And a matter of
[1:34:36] fact, even in Genesis 1, laying under
[1:34:39] darkness, void, under such oppression.
[1:34:44] But now, God comes to bring release,
[1:34:47] redemption. What's he doing? He's coming
[1:34:49] to the earth to redeem what belongs to
[1:34:52] him. No other planet is spoken of or
[1:34:55] wrote of in that terms in the scripture,
[1:34:58] but that of earth. How God would redeem
[1:35:01] that and take it to himself. God showing
[1:35:03] that of redemption. Remember, even as
[1:35:05] we're looking at this, even you see uh
[1:35:07] that of how that Adam's side was opened
[1:35:09] up and out of his side, God took
[1:35:11] therefore a rib and begin to multiply
[1:35:14] with the substance that came from Adam's
[1:35:18] body. Same thing with it is in the Lord
[1:35:21] Jesus Christ where God would take from
[1:35:24] Christ. Now listen, that all how that
[1:35:26] all that was laying there is the water,
[1:35:28] the blood, and spirit. But who is he?
[1:35:30] He's the word. And God would actually go
[1:35:33] word by word and make up his bride, his
[1:35:37] people. It's it's his word that's being
[1:35:40] built and moved within our lives. Now
[1:35:43] then, how God will bring together a a a
[1:35:46] a people that he absolutely loosens
[1:35:50] through the shedding of his blood like
[1:35:52] that of in order to get Ruth, he had to
[1:35:55] redeem Naomi's estate.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; When he redeemed Naomi's estate, he got
[1:36:00] Ruth. Is that right?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; So within getting Ruth now Ruth, it
[1:36:04] would be the bedding ground in Ruth that
[1:36:07] was that was given to raise up name to
[1:36:11] that of the dead. And God has chosen the
[1:36:14] bedding ground. Remember Jesus spoke of
[1:36:17] good ground, stony ground, all those
[1:36:19] types of grounds. The prophet called
[1:36:21] that bedding grounds. And he says in the
[1:36:23] message the rapture, one of the places
[1:36:25] you were a pre-prepared
[1:36:28] ground. You are ordained to receive
[1:36:31] Christ in this hour. You say, "What is
[1:36:34] that ground?" That's that womb. That's
[1:36:36] that seed that came predestinated from
[1:36:39] Almighty God. And when that seed was
[1:36:42] laying there, the seed of God's own life
[1:36:44] comes in and the quickening power raises
[1:36:48] up a new creation on the inside.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Not a new man or a man made over, but a
[1:36:54] new creation. a creation that is made by
[1:36:58] God. King and a priest.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; And I want you to think of this powerful
[1:37:05] king and priest. How God would put both
[1:37:08] of those together because you have it
[1:37:10] has to operate within that way. And not
[1:37:13] only does a priest have to understand
[1:37:15] what they're called to do, their
[1:37:17] position, but there's also got to be
[1:37:19] some kingly rule in that in that place
[1:37:22] as well, too. kingly rule. In other
[1:37:24] words, to say, uh-uh, this ain't how
[1:37:26] this temple operates. It's to operate
[1:37:29] like this.
[1:37:31] How many remember reading Nehemiah
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; in the scriptures? Nehemiah was not a
[1:37:36] priest. He was a governor.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He was a king. And when things started,
[1:37:40] when there was hard things that had to
[1:37:42] be done and said, "Hey, wait a minute
[1:37:43] here. Who's your daddy?" Um, well, I I I
[1:37:48] know I'm of the Levitical priesthood.
[1:37:49] No, no. Who's your daddy?
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Y'all know what I'm talking about. It's
[1:37:53] right there. He did it twice.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; They had no proof of their lineage. And
[1:37:59] when they had no written proof of their
[1:38:02] lineage, Nehemiah said, "Get out.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; You're not a priest." Why? Because a
[1:38:07] priest will have documentation.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; There is a genealogy, a lineage, a tie
[1:38:15] in. Let me say this to you and I. You
[1:38:17] and I did not have a tie in within our
[1:38:20] own natural birth into the economy of
[1:38:22] God. We were just like Ruth. We were
[1:38:25] just like, we were like Rahab. We were
[1:38:27] like others. But Christ himself, that
[1:38:30] was a type to show that through him by
[1:38:32] the union with Jesus Christ, we are
[1:38:35] brought into union and fellowship as
[1:38:39] priests of God.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have even had a fighting
[1:38:45] chance. Our name's on the book, but how
[1:38:47] do I get back there?
[1:38:50] [Music]
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm a priest, but how do I get
[1:38:53] there?
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; How do I get back to that place? Cuz the
[1:38:59] Bible says by one spirit, we're all
[1:39:02] baptized into this priesthood.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Into one body. How am I
[1:39:08] going to get there? There had to be one
[1:39:11] that came and was made like me. Amen.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; There had to be one who became me.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; To become my kinsman, redeemer.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; That he might take upon himself
[1:39:26] my sin,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; my shame, my guilt. You know why? Cuz
[1:39:31] you can't worship with guilt hanging
[1:39:34] over you.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; You can't worship under condemnation.
[1:39:39] You can't worship under that weight. But
[1:39:41] Christ himself came not only to deal
[1:39:44] with sin. He came to deal with guilt. He
[1:39:46] came to deal with condemnation. He came
[1:39:50] to abolish that. What would be hanging
[1:39:53] over your head like you're like an eagle
[1:39:55] wanting to rise up and you get to a
[1:39:57] certain place and all of a sudden the
[1:39:58] bars want to smack you back down. Let me
[1:40:00] tell you something. He didn't just make
[1:40:02] a hole in those bars. He didn't just put
[1:40:05] Vaseline on your side and squeeze you
[1:40:07] through, brother. He opened up the
[1:40:10] prison and the cage that you were held
[1:40:13] in.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; You see, you wanted to serve God. Your
[1:40:17] desire was to serve God. Who put that
[1:40:20] desire in you? God put that desire in
[1:40:23] you. And you'll never be satisfied
[1:40:25] anywhere else outside of the house of
[1:40:27] God, the body of Jesus Christ, the
[1:40:30] revealed word of this hour. Nowhere
[1:40:33] else. You were meant to serve his
[1:40:35] purpose
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; to be a reflection of this hour. The
[1:40:39] prophet said, "A living oracle
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; of the living God in this hour." A
[1:40:43] manifestation of the living God in this
[1:40:46] hour.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; That's why Brother Bam stops at the end
[1:40:52] of Kinsman Redeemer. He says, "And after
[1:40:55] we've been made sons,
[1:40:57] sometimes he said, we forget
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; how we got where we are.
[1:41:05] Who was it that brought you where you
[1:41:06] are? God.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; So go back in your mind and think. The
[1:41:13] same God that brought you into a place
[1:41:18] to where there was nothing as far as
[1:41:19] saying written of you or it was but it
[1:41:23] was hidden.
[1:41:25] But God would come and make that known
[1:41:26] to you. He would so by his presence make
[1:41:29] himself so real to you and draw you to a
[1:41:32] place of surrender. Because remember as
[1:41:35] a priest,
[1:41:38] as a priest, Aaron, Aaron wasn't the one
[1:41:41] walking around and saying, "Hey, Moses,
[1:41:44] you know, we're kin.
[1:41:47] I'll be the priest."
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Paul said in Hebrews 5, "No man taketh
[1:41:52] this honor unto himself.
[1:41:56] But God he said Christ glorified him
[1:42:00] notself not to be made a high priest. It
[1:42:02] was not what Christ said. It was not
[1:42:04] what has as Jesus was walking here. It
[1:42:06] was not what he was saying. Remember he
[1:42:08] what he said? He said I my father and I
[1:42:12] witness. I have a witness that is
[1:42:15] greater than the witness of man.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; What did what witness did he have? The
[1:42:19] same witness that he's provided and made
[1:42:21] available to every one of us. And that's
[1:42:22] the witness of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; To where listen, listen to me now. I'm
[1:42:27] going to close on this. To where that in
[1:42:29] your life, the way that you stand and
[1:42:31] you defeat every devil and from that
[1:42:32] place you grow is the witness of the
[1:42:34] Holy Spirit of what God has done in your
[1:42:37] life. You stand on that witness. That's
[1:42:39] a witness of the Holy Spirit. And that's
[1:42:42] the grounds that you come on. You stand
[1:42:44] on those grounds. That's the grounds you
[1:42:46] live from. Don't get out there in your
[1:42:48] reasoning.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; You can't worship God through reasoning.
[1:42:52] Amen.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; You can't even worship God in
[1:42:55] imagination because if you're not
[1:42:57] careful in imagination, I know we can
[1:43:00] imagine we're somewhere that we're not.
[1:43:01] But there's also a part of imagination
[1:43:03] that the enemy will having you believe.
[1:43:06] And let me just talk it now. He'll take
[1:43:07] these quotes and scriptures and he'll
[1:43:09] start and spin these things sitting
[1:43:11] right here in the house of God and want
[1:43:13] to run you down and want to run you out
[1:43:16] of here. That's not the correct
[1:43:18] interpretation. That's not the spirit of
[1:43:20] God. That's not the witness of the Holy
[1:43:22] Spirit. The witness of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:25] is always wanting to draw you.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I don't even care how bad a situation
[1:43:31] is. The Holy Spirit says, "Come.
[1:43:35] Come. Come.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Don't stay away. Come."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; At one time it was death to stay out of
[1:43:43] the Holiest of Holies to her to come
[1:43:46] into it. Now it's death to stay out of
[1:43:48] it.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Why do you think you're here this
[1:43:53] morning?
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Just listening to the prophet last
[1:43:57] night. He said, "Oh, brother Ram, you
[1:43:58] know, I'm just a church, but I don't
[1:43:59] think I don't think God has any interest
[1:44:01] in me." He said, "Hold on a second." He
[1:44:03] said, "You you couldn't even be here at
[1:44:06] church this morning unless God's dealing
[1:44:07] with your heart."
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something.
[1:44:15] I don't care if the offering you have,
[1:44:17] let me just say this now.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; The offering you have right now,
[1:44:23] maybe in your life it's like that, but
[1:44:26] give it to him.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; And you give that to him, he'll give you
[1:44:32] more.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; I wish I had some other things up here
[1:44:36] that I could use. Eventually, it'll go
[1:44:38] and eventually you'll be offering this.
[1:44:42] Wow.
[1:44:43] It all started with this.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Well, worship what he's done.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Worship him for what he's done, how you
[1:44:49] know him to be. You can't worship him
[1:44:52] according to what he's done for me. I
[1:44:54] can worship him according to how I know
[1:44:56] how he is and who he is to me. So, I'm
[1:44:59] going to worship him. And you know what?
[1:45:00] As you continue to worship him,
[1:45:02] eventually your worship turns into this
[1:45:04] right here.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You see what's happening? It's more of
[1:45:09] himself. His life is taking over. So now
[1:45:12] through avenues of our life, he's
[1:45:15] pressing himself through what is the
[1:45:18] witness
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That deposit
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; from our high priest
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; to his priest
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; and his kings.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; And you have been made kings and priests
[1:45:34] unto God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could just go on right now,
[1:45:40] but
[1:45:46] I'm gonna have you stand
[1:45:48] that way. I know I'm not going to go on.
[1:45:50] Some of you say, "Yeah, right."
[1:45:56] I know I we could just I could go right
[1:45:58] through and preach it, but I'm not in a
[1:45:59] meeting right now. I'm at home. These
[1:46:00] are things I want to really lay in. Look
[1:46:02] how Brother Ram says this here. Lord,
[1:46:05] we'll pick it up next week.
[1:46:07] He says, "And made us priests,
[1:46:12] priests unto him, offering the spiritual
[1:46:15] praise of sanctified lips,
[1:46:19] spending
[1:46:21] our lives as a sweet offering unto him,
[1:46:26] worshiping him in spirit and in truth,
[1:46:31] interceding
[1:46:33] and petitioning
[1:46:37] see God working through his body. I
[1:46:39] mean, if God knew,
[1:46:41] God knew you were going through a
[1:46:43] procedure, why didn't God just Hey, but
[1:46:45] instead
[1:46:47] you ask for prayer.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody even comes on your heart.
[1:46:52] You're driving down the road,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; somebody comes on your heart, what do
[1:46:56] you do as a priest? You intercede.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. To
[1:47:02] intercede for somebody doesn't mean you
[1:47:04] got to get down on these. I know as we
[1:47:06] get older sometimes it gets hard to get
[1:47:07] down. You try to find stuff to get up
[1:47:09] with.
[1:47:10] Interceding is not that you got to be on
[1:47:12] your knees.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have a long long
[1:47:15] prayer. Sometimes where there's things
[1:47:17] where God will wake me up. It'll be
[1:47:19] right in the middle in the morning. Man,
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; those times, you know, other times you
[1:47:25] wish you could go back to sleep, but
[1:47:26] other times you just like feel so
[1:47:27] swimming head. Anybody know what I'm
[1:47:28] talking about? Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; But but somebody's name comes to you
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; or there's a burden lays on my heart.
[1:47:33] What do you do? I just call their name
[1:47:35] out in prayer.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Lord God, help them right now. Lord, do
[1:47:38] for them what they need. Lord, minister
[1:47:39] to them. Why? You're a priest. You're a
[1:47:43] priest.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Interceding and petitioning. Petitioning
[1:47:46] meaning making requests known.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; No wonder the world does not appeal to
[1:47:52] us.
[1:47:54] We are a peculiar people, zealous
[1:47:57] unto good works.
[1:48:00] We have been recreated in him
[1:48:03] to be children
[1:48:06] like unto our father.
[1:48:10] Can I read you one more quote? Kind of
[1:48:12] leave this with you.
[1:48:15] Brother Rem says it like this. He says,
[1:48:17] "I guess it's not against the law in
[1:48:18] Phoenix to say hallelujah. I mean,
[1:48:21] praise our God. I I think he's worthy of
[1:48:23] every praise and hallelujah we could
[1:48:25] ring from these mortal lips. The Bible
[1:48:27] said, "You're a royal priesthood, a
[1:48:29] peculiar people offering spiritual
[1:48:30] sacrifices to God. The fruits of your
[1:48:33] lips giving praise unto him. Oh my, the
[1:48:36] fruits of your lips pouring up praise
[1:48:40] daily before the people."
[1:48:44] What a high priest we have.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; What a priesthood that we're in. The
[1:48:51] priesthood of the circumcision, not of
[1:48:54] flesh, but of the heart. The heart
[1:48:56] circumcised by the Holy Ghost. Then you
[1:49:00] can offer praise and adorations to God.
[1:49:04] The spiritual sacrifice, your lips
[1:49:06] pouring out praise
[1:49:09] unto him.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; What a privilege.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Is it always
[1:49:19] easy? Do we always
[1:49:21] feel like it. No. But this is where you
[1:49:25] have to live and discern.
[1:49:29] You know, you don't serve God based on
[1:49:31] feelings.
[1:49:32] You serve him based on the witness of
[1:49:35] who he is in your soul.
[1:49:39] And from there, he's the strength.
[1:49:42] And he equips you and me to press beyond
[1:49:48] our feelings.
[1:49:50] Because sometimes the very things that's
[1:49:52] caused us to miss out on the blessings
[1:49:55] of God is our feelings.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I wonder think about how the dispersion
[1:50:02] those of you that as you read through
[1:50:03] the scriptures and you notice that with
[1:50:05] all the different responsibilities
[1:50:07] that the priest would have as I told you
[1:50:09] some were responsible for making that of
[1:50:13] the anointing oil. Everybody had their
[1:50:16] responsibility.
[1:50:18] You ever heard that term look like ants
[1:50:20] on an antill?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It was like when those that concrete
[1:50:24] company was out here. Different
[1:50:25] brothers. I remember that last year when
[1:50:28] you're here. I don't I'm not making
[1:50:30] light of them. I'm just saying it looked
[1:50:31] like ants on an antill. I But I never I
[1:50:33] stood right there on that porch at
[1:50:34] different times. I'd come out sometimes.
[1:50:35] I pour right in here. I didn't hear
[1:50:37] nobody telling somebody, "Hey, you do
[1:50:38] this or see somebody over here standing
[1:50:40] around on a on a broom or somebody over
[1:50:41] here on a, you know, on a shovel or
[1:50:43] somebody." No. Everybody was doing
[1:50:45] something.
[1:50:48] But what if what if one of the priests
[1:50:52] said, "You know what?
[1:50:55] I don't feel like making the meal
[1:50:56] today."
[1:50:59] I mean, after all, it's not needed
[1:51:01] today. The meal, it's needed on another
[1:51:06] day.
[1:51:09] But every day, I no doubt, maybe that
[1:51:11] happened, but you know what?
[1:51:15] Everything had to be in place in order
[1:51:18] for the tabernacle service to go
[1:51:21] forward.
[1:51:23] You know, you know what that service was
[1:51:25] about? It was about the entire body.
[1:51:29] It wasn't a service. Oh, Aaron wants us
[1:51:31] to do this. God said this through Aaron.
[1:51:33] God said this through Moses. Said it
[1:51:34] through Aaron. And it was about
[1:51:37] everything they did when they
[1:51:40] were making that fine flour. They
[1:51:42] weren't making that fine flower for
[1:51:45] Aaron.
[1:51:46] Paul said, "In all you do in word or
[1:51:49] deed, do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:51:52] Christ."
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want to give God anything
[1:51:57] less than our best.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; I mean, he he gave his best for us,
[1:52:04] right?
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; And yet, within all of that, to be able
[1:52:07] to say, "Who are we doing this unto?"
[1:52:10] It's unto the Lord. Right?
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "Let him make me a
[1:52:14] sanctuary that I may dwell among them."
[1:52:17] Brother Samuel, my part, my part might
[1:52:19] be a little part. I might have this part
[1:52:21] or this part, but every part is
[1:52:24] significant.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Every part
[1:52:29] is significant.
[1:52:31] Your part, maybe you don't really know
[1:52:33] what your part, your portion, or where
[1:52:35] where it is. Maybe up to this point,
[1:52:38] maybe you coming to that place to
[1:52:39] realize, look, I Lord, I I really need
[1:52:42] to get in to the body. Not just get in
[1:52:45] church. I need to get into the body of
[1:52:48] Jesus Christ. I need I need a real
[1:52:51] spiritual birth, Lord. I need that
[1:52:55] reality. I need that. God's not ashamed.
[1:52:58] Let me just tell you something. You can
[1:53:00] never bring something to God that God
[1:53:02] would blush or be ashamed.
[1:53:06] But matter of fact, what he wants you to
[1:53:08] do, one of the greatest compliments you
[1:53:09] could do is bring your needs and your
[1:53:12] requests before him.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; I'll even tell you this right here. I'm
[1:53:17] not interested in shaming nobody. I
[1:53:19] don't care how bad a situation would be.
[1:53:22] I stand as a Bible preacher and a
[1:53:25] believer of this message to know that
[1:53:28] there's no situation
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; that's beyond redemption. That's right.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; I stand up on that and I'll stand up on
[1:53:34] that till either God takes me home or I
[1:53:37] go by the way of the rapture.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; There is no situation
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; beyond redemption.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; And any minister would want to shame
[1:53:49] somebody, he needs a little correction
[1:53:50] himself because to understand the grace
[1:53:52] of God, that's what we're all here about
[1:53:54] is to call and that God's grace would so
[1:53:56] move within hearts and lives.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; That's my heart's desire. Yes.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Is that yours, Lord? Just let me do my
[1:54:03] part.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I want to do my part, Lord.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; I want to be faithful.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray.
[1:54:11] Heavenly Father,
[1:54:15] oh my Lord,
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; once again, Lord, there's ways and how
[1:54:20] that you take us. And I I just, Lord,
[1:54:22] have to believe how you would guide us
[1:54:24] on things to be said in the way they
[1:54:27] could be said. I certainly don't make
[1:54:29] Lord that every single word that that
[1:54:31] has come through my mouth as though that
[1:54:33] that was you. But there's a human
[1:54:35] element to it as well. But Father, how
[1:54:38] that you would guide us and that's
[1:54:40] always my prayer, Lord. We could hurry
[1:54:43] through an outline and hurry through a
[1:54:45] thought. Oh my. There's there's places,
[1:54:47] Lord, I would love to to get to
[1:54:50] that. But you know what we need,
[1:54:53] Lord, with a thought that you've
[1:54:55] burdened on our hearts and you've drawn
[1:54:58] us, dear God, under the great canopy of
[1:55:01] your grace.
[1:55:03] Lord, I pray this morning
[1:55:08] right here as we've we've gathered,
[1:55:09] Lord, as priests of God.
[1:55:12] Lord, to step aside from the the cares
[1:55:15] of life. I pray, Lord, I I ask you that
[1:55:19] you would bless your children. Oh, I
[1:55:21] know it's Sunday,
[1:55:23] but I don't believe they're here out of
[1:55:26] obligation.
[1:55:28] I know some are traveling, some are
[1:55:30] sick, Lord.
[1:55:32] But Lord God, those of us as we're
[1:55:34] gathered here, whether here or on
[1:55:37] Thursday, next Sunday, should you,
[1:55:39] Terry, we're not here under an
[1:55:41] obligation. Yes, the prophet tells us
[1:55:43] about post of duty, but oh God,
[1:55:47] it's not out of obligation.
[1:55:50] It's because we love you.
[1:55:53] We love you, Father. We want to hear
[1:55:56] from you, Lord.
[1:55:58] Lord God,
[1:56:02] may you, Lord, I pray now.
[1:56:05] If there's a heart or life that has only
[1:56:08] known you, Lord God, in worshiping
[1:56:11] in spirit but not in truth.
[1:56:16] if they've never come fully into that
[1:56:17] place with you, Lord, to wear
[1:56:20] under the blood by way of the new birth
[1:56:25] to know you
[1:56:28] in spirit and truth.
[1:56:31] the living God
[1:56:34] dwelling
[1:56:36] in their lives behind
[1:56:39] that old badger skin where the life of
[1:56:42] that badger has gone out and there's a
[1:56:45] new life on the inside.
[1:56:48] Lord, I pray this morning,
[1:56:51] God, maybe Lord, where they're at right
[1:56:53] now, but they're offering up what?
[1:56:55] Worship.
[1:56:57] They're thanking you, Lord, for
[1:56:58] salvation,
[1:57:00] Lord. God, no doubt other lives are
[1:57:01] thanking you, Lord. Thank you for Lord
[1:57:03] sanctifying. Thank you for dealing with
[1:57:05] me, Lord, and convicting me, Lord, in my
[1:57:07] life on this. Thank you, Lord, for
[1:57:09] dealing with me, Lord, in these areas.
[1:57:12] And then, Lord, other lives would in
[1:57:15] their worship, maybe it's not like this
[1:57:17] cap, but at one times, well, at one
[1:57:20] time, we were like that with that cap on
[1:57:22] this bottle, but we're no longer there.
[1:57:26] But Lord, neither do we just want to
[1:57:27] stay as just that little bottle I had in
[1:57:29] my hand. Oh yes, I want every bit of
[1:57:33] that, Lord God, that you've allotted for
[1:57:35] this moment. I want you to feel it,
[1:57:36] Lord.
[1:57:38] And Father, as we would thank you, Lord,
[1:57:40] and to worship you, oh God, for changing
[1:57:44] our lives.
[1:57:46] And then Lord God, as we would see the
[1:57:48] change that's been brought in our lives,
[1:57:51] then
[1:57:53] we begin to grow from that new birth,
[1:57:57] growing up unto him in all things.
[1:58:00] And we begin to worship you
[1:58:03] through the adding and increase of
[1:58:05] patience.
[1:58:07] worshshiping
[1:58:09] through temperance,
[1:58:11] worshiping you through godliness,
[1:58:14] worshiping you through brotherly
[1:58:16] kindness. Glory be to God. Hallelujah.
[1:58:19] Hallelujah.
[1:58:21] Lord Jesus,
[1:58:23] no wonder your prophet, Lord, when he
[1:58:25] would dedicate the tabernacle there on
[1:58:27] eighth and pin and God hiding and
[1:58:31] revealing himself in simplicity,
[1:58:34] he said, "May we so characterize our
[1:58:37] worship here
[1:58:39] and worship here as though we were
[1:58:43] already over there."
[1:58:46] Oh Lord God, grant it. I pray, Father.
[1:58:51] Lord Jesus,
[1:58:53] how we thank you, Lord.
[1:58:56] Lord God, what a privilege it is, Lord
[1:58:58] God, to worship you in spirit and in
[1:59:01] truth.
[1:59:03] Sacrifices that are offered up by him,
[1:59:06] the surrendering of our lives,
[1:59:07] surrendering of our will.
[1:59:10] Oh God,
[1:59:13] worship is more than a note.
[1:59:16] more than a key, more than a frame, but
[1:59:20] worship
[1:59:23] is an expression
[1:59:25] from the very depths of our life.
[1:59:29] And Lord Jesus,
[1:59:32] it works. It works throughout our lives
[1:59:35] where it may not look the same as us
[1:59:37] standing here and raising our hands or
[1:59:39] maybe where the spirit of God has
[1:59:41] touched us and maybe something the way
[1:59:43] that we're built and it strikes us and
[1:59:44] we stand up and say, "Glory to God." Or
[1:59:47] maybe we take off running or or dancing.
[1:59:50] But yet, Lord, that's not the only way
[1:59:52] we worship. Oh, there's times for that.
[1:59:56] Absolutely.
[1:59:58] But oh God,
[2:00:00] we don't want to minimize worship
[2:00:02] because worship even in that moment,
[2:00:04] Lord God, where we're standing and we're
[2:00:08] waiting on an answer, Lord, I need an
[2:00:11] answer and we're standing there
[2:00:15] worshiping you
[2:00:17] while we're waiting.
[2:00:21] still maybe sickness in our body,
[2:00:24] maybe a doctor's report that's got a
[2:00:26] question mark over it, but in the midst
[2:00:28] of that to worship,
[2:00:32] [Music]
[2:00:34] you're the Lord that health all my
[2:00:36] diseases.
[2:00:38] By your stripes, I am healed.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to worship you, Lord.
[2:00:44] Grant it, Lord God, I pray. Help us,
[2:00:48] Lord Jesus.
[2:00:50] Forgive us, Lord, for when we've
[2:00:51] minimized worship. Worship is so much
[2:00:55] deeper
[2:00:57] than just songs or music or even
[2:01:00] confined to a part of a service.
[2:01:02] Worship, worship is where you're seated
[2:01:08] in the very throne of man.
[2:01:11] and your life, Lord God. It emanates,
[2:01:13] Lord, from the depths of our hearts in
[2:01:16] thanksgiving. For we know who we are. We
[2:01:20] know who you are.
[2:01:22] And we're worshiping you, Lord,
[2:01:25] in spirit and in truth.
[2:01:27] Deity, almighty God, tabernacled
[2:01:31] in flesh. Once again, we love you, Lord.
[2:01:38] Oh my. Could we just raise our hands to
[2:01:39] him and say, "Lord, I love you.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I'm so thankful, Lord.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Thankful. This priesthood that I'm in,
[2:01:49] Lord, I didn't bring myself. I didn't
[2:01:51] choose myself. I didn't take this honor
[2:01:54] unto myself, but you chose me before the
[2:01:57] foundation of the world." Thank you,
[2:01:58] Lord God. Thank you, Lord God, for
[2:02:01] revealing that my name was in the
[2:02:03] genealogy.
[2:02:06] Oh, God. Thank you for your grace, Lord,
[2:02:08] that's broke upon our hearts, Lord, to
[2:02:11] drive back, Lord God, the clouds of
[2:02:13] doubt, Lord,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; and where our lives
[2:02:17] are surrendered instruments
[2:02:20] unto the living God,
[2:02:23] we can raise as it were our hands
[2:02:26] like the instruments in the tabernacle,
[2:02:29] snuffer dishes, other parts that were
[2:02:31] instruments of worship.
[2:02:34] Oh God,
[2:02:36] we love you Lord.
[2:02:39] Father, grant it Lord God.
[2:02:43] May our meditation worship you Lord God.
[2:02:46] May the meditation of our heart be
[2:02:48] acceptable in thy sight. Oh God, grant
[2:02:51] it Lord I pray.
[2:02:54] May you strengthen Lord those that are
[2:02:56] weary. Touch them Lord I pray.
[2:03:00] Give them strength in their bodies Lord.
[2:03:02] maybe through the midst of trials and
[2:03:04] tests and where they're standing, but
[2:03:06] God, may your presence, Lord, God, just
[2:03:10] coming to comfort them right now
[2:03:13] that Father, as even they're going
[2:03:14] through this,
[2:03:17] they can worship you.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; They can worship you. They may not even
[2:03:22] be able to raise their hands. Maybe
[2:03:24] something has happened to their arms.
[2:03:27] Maybe their feet, they're not able to
[2:03:28] dance like they would want to dance, but
[2:03:31] they're able to worship you and say,
[2:03:33] "Lord, I don't care what the doctor's
[2:03:35] report says. You're my healer." Glory be
[2:03:39] to God. I don't care what what the
[2:03:42] enemy's wanted to say. I don't care what
[2:03:44] has remained down through this family
[2:03:47] tree. I'm part of that tree of life.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; By his stripes,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; I am made whole.
[2:03:57] I'm a worshshiper, Lord.
