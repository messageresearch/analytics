[0:00] of the holy spirit this is not an old an
[0:02] old life
[0:03] patched over right now it's it's
[0:07] god creating it's god creating
[0:11] in you god creating in me
[0:14] now look how how paul would go on to
[0:17] write this
[0:18] in romans 12 verse 1 and he says i
[0:21] beseech you therefore brethren
[0:23] by the mercies of god how many thankful
[0:26] for god's mercy
[0:28] i don't want god's law i want his mercy
[0:32] that ye present your bodies
[0:36] a living sacrifice holy
[0:39] acceptable unto god which is your
[0:41] reasonable service
[0:42] what god requires of us as aaron and as
[0:45] the priests
[0:46] they were to take of the uh
[0:50] the sacrifice and to bring them into a
[0:53] place to present them
[0:54] on behalf of the worshiper god is
[0:57] speaking to you and i
[0:59] and letting you and i know the only
[1:01] thing that you and i can do what is our
[1:03] reasonable service
[1:04] is that we would present our bodies
[1:06] don't don't hold anything back but
[1:08] present of our lives and you know what
[1:11] that never
[1:12] stops that never stops
[1:18] and be not conformed to this world
[1:22] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:26] of your mind that ye might prove what is
[1:29] that good
[1:30] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:35] you find paul goes on to say in in
[1:37] ephesians 4
[1:38] 23 and be renewed in the spirit
[1:42] of your mind paul would there are many
[1:45] places in the scripture
[1:46] that would speak of this renewal uh
[1:50] a renewal is is not like
[1:54] changing the carpet in here changing the
[1:56] color of the walls
[1:58] changing all that that's a renovation
[2:00] but it's still the same old building
[2:02] and there's times where we have to do
[2:04] that that that also
[2:06] is part of renewal but this renewal that
[2:09] we're talking about
[2:10] is not just where the outside is changed
[2:13] to where
[2:14] things start appearing right on the
[2:16] outside but it moves to such a place
[2:18] to the renewal brings about a full
[2:21] change
[2:22] a full birth a full transformation and
[2:25] it continues to work
[2:27] in our life to perform and bring forth
[2:29] the word
[2:32] because then the then where the ground
[2:34] that we stand on
[2:36] for every promise of god whether it's
[2:38] healing whatever the need might be in
[2:40] our life
[2:41] then our ground that we stand on is is
[2:44] that revelation of jesus christ in our
[2:46] heart
[2:46] that new birth the love of god then
[2:49] that's where we stand
[2:50] and for every prayer this is our token
[2:53] we offer with our prayer
[2:54] this is the ground that we stand on as
[2:57] sons and daughters of god
[2:59] amen i mean when you go to ask your dad
[3:02] i don't care how old you are
[3:04] or your mom or you know other things
[3:05] like that and you go to ask them for
[3:07] money hey can i have a little bit of
[3:08] money hey can i do this or
[3:09] how are you how are you approaching them
[3:11] you approach them as a son or daughter
[3:13] right how what's your approach your
[3:16] approach is based on
[3:18] who you know you are and who they are
[3:21] and that's what the baptism of the holy
[3:23] ghost even the working of the holy
[3:25] spirit to draw
[3:27] you to a place to recognize this is for
[3:30] me
[3:31] the holy ghost is for me for other other
[3:34] promises in the word
[3:35] this belongs to me you're not
[3:36] approaching as a beggar or as a slave
[3:39] you're not approaching as someone oh i
[3:41] don't know i may not deserve this no the
[3:43] holy spirit comes to make it so real
[3:46] that it's not what you deserve it's what
[3:48] belongs to
[3:49] you it comes to inspire
[3:53] faith in his word
[3:56] so this is why within the scripture we
[3:59] will
[4:00] find you're familiar probably you've
[4:02] heard it or as a bible reader
[4:03] you may have read it but it speaks of
[4:05] even how in isaiah how
[4:07] even the condition of a really strong
[4:11] young person uh could be and so resolute
[4:15] and so forth in their mind and so strong
[4:17] but yet the youth will faint it's not
[4:20] able it's not by natural strength that
[4:22] we're able to live
[4:24] this life oh if i was just younger if i
[4:26] if i
[4:27] it's not it's not about our natural
[4:28] strength this is why the scripture said
[4:31] that our youth is to be renewed as an
[4:34] eagle
[4:35] and that renewal as as isaiah would
[4:37] write that in isaiah 40 he's speaking
[4:40] about
[4:40] the transformation but there's a key
[4:43] phrase in there
[4:44] they that wait on the lord
[4:47] shall renew their strength and shall
[4:50] mount up with the wings as an eagle an
[4:53] eagle
[4:53] remember as an ego you do not become an
[4:57] ego
[4:57] but you are already there is that
[5:00] identity within you
[5:01] that's what's causing you to identify
[5:04] with the word
[5:05] it's what is dealing with your life it's
[5:08] not you guiding you but
[5:10] god the winds the current of the holy
[5:13] spirit by the word
[5:14] is letting you know there are higher
[5:16] heights for you to climb to
[5:18] there is grace given for you what do i
[5:20] have to do as an eagle
[5:22] you spread your wings you give just a
[5:25] little jump you got to put a little bit
[5:27] of effort
[5:28] you give a jump but you're jumping into
[5:30] the current
[5:31] the wind that is moving and you allow
[5:34] that wind to pack you away
[5:37] that wind i'm talking about is the wind
[5:39] of the holy ghost
[5:41] they that wait on the lord shall renew
[5:44] their strength
[5:46] you know brother branham once again and
[5:48] i know i've used this
[5:49] example here in a few services but i
[5:51] want to just be very specific i've
[5:54] referred to it but
[5:55] just feeling pressed of the lord when we
[5:57] look at this
[5:58] i think of how brother branham places it
[6:00] in the message
[6:01] power of transformation and he deals
[6:03] with this earth and the condition it was
[6:06] in darkness and
[6:07] brother brown would say it like this he
[6:09] would say it was a treme
[6:11] terrific mass of something lost
[6:15] like it couldn't find its way and how
[6:18] that god
[6:20] took the great chaos of darkness
[6:23] and transformed it into a garden of eden
[6:26] by his word god did it
[6:30] by his word and that's how we're
[6:33] transformed is by his word let there be
[6:36] light
[6:38] and is it the earth itself now when she
[6:40] doesn't catch this very simple
[6:42] but the earth it obeyed
[6:45] the voice of god
[6:48] that's all god requires for you and i is
[6:51] to believe and when i say all that that
[6:53] requires
[6:54] there because belief unleashes
[6:57] the power of god to obey
[7:00] it invites god to perform his word he
[7:03] asked those when
[7:04] many that came before him with sickness
[7:06] he said do you believe that i'm able to
[7:08] do this
[7:10] and remember even the man who had the
[7:11] son who cast himself into the fire
[7:14] you know and when he came jesus you know
[7:17] asked him and the man said i believe
[7:19] help down my unbelief i believe tonight
[7:23] i would even be that honest and sincere
[7:25] if you can say that and say god
[7:27] i believe help my unbelief because this
[7:30] is what god
[7:31] requires god does not perform it's not
[7:35] god coming and bringing his word to pass
[7:37] any other way it's not some great amount
[7:39] of hoops you got to jump through
[7:41] it's not this listen this is for
[7:42] everyday life
[7:44] are you with me this is everyday life
[7:47] this
[7:47] is this is how we take promises once
[7:50] we're in the promised land
[7:52] we take them by faith in the word
[7:55] amen it's by faith in the word
[7:58] we believe is that right so
[8:01] it became brother brown would say it
[8:03] like this and
[8:04] speaks of how it became a garden of eden
[8:06] because it obeyed
[8:09] the word of god it done the perfect will
[8:11] of god
[8:12] amen see the word was made known the
[8:16] word was spoken
[8:17] what did the word do what did the earth
[8:19] do the earth
[8:21] yielded to the spirit that was brooding
[8:25] over it that's all it had to do
[8:28] he had to just say yes lord hallelujah
[8:31] yes lord amen brother bram said the holy
[8:34] spirit broods over you
[8:35] it says my daughter i'm calling you to
[8:38] eternal life
[8:39] you say what do you say yes holy spirit
[8:41] praise the lord
[8:42] you're responding back it's a personal
[8:44] connection he's pruning over you
[8:46] you are a part of the earth and he's
[8:49] brooding over
[8:50] that part of the earth and what is he
[8:53] doing he's drawing
[8:54] you and i into redemption
[8:59] by himself so it notice
[9:02] jesus would pick this up uh and and he
[9:05] would speak
[9:08] even when he would talking to the
[9:10] disciples and i just referred to this
[9:12] when he spoke to the 12 apostles
[9:15] and he speaks of how that those who
[9:17] would follow him
[9:19] in the regeneration when the son of man
[9:22] shall set on the throne of glory you
[9:24] shall also sit
[9:26] upon twelve thrones judging the twelve
[9:28] tribes of israel and it begins to go on
[9:30] that there's not one who has left or
[9:32] forsaken houses lands family and so
[9:34] forth
[9:34] but it will receive in this lifetime and
[9:36] in the life to come
[9:38] he is speaking in the terms followed in
[9:40] the regeneration
[9:42] remember before god became
[9:45] man there was no way
[9:48] possible that man could come into
[9:52] that relationship of a union where the
[9:55] holy spirit
[9:56] would come and dwell by a seal
[9:59] within that life is that right
[10:03] the spirit of god would come upon david
[10:05] and it would move
[10:06] it would come upon the prophets he would
[10:08] move you see
[10:09] there there had to come a time when
[10:12] there would be one
[10:14] who would stand in the gap between
[10:17] a sinful man and a holy god
[10:20] and there was no man could do that but
[10:23] god
[10:24] himself created the tabernacle the body
[10:28] of his dwelling that he alone would
[10:31] condemn
[10:32] and take upon flesh that he might be
[10:35] able to
[10:36] join us back into our inheritance
[10:40] and so when god became flesh
[10:43] he paid the price for you it's like if
[10:45] you've got a hospital bill
[10:47] and you're walking around and you're
[10:48] saying oh i got this bill oh i can't do
[10:50] this
[10:51] oh i got this bill hey don't you want to
[10:52] buy a new living room suit no i got a
[10:54] bill
[10:54] hey don't you wanna no i got a bill hey
[10:56] don't you want no i got a bill but you
[10:58] recognize
[10:59] when somebody comes and lets you know
[11:01] that the debt that was against you
[11:04] has already been paid when that
[11:07] begins to ring in your heart you now are
[11:10] made freedom freedom is coming to your
[11:13] life
[11:14] you are no longer held in debt to that
[11:17] sin
[11:17] and that's exactly what god did on
[11:21] calvary he paid the debt he paid your
[11:24] sin debt
[11:25] he paid pass present and future
[11:28] he went completely went to the lowest
[11:31] parts of hell
[11:32] deposited sin on the very one
[11:36] who was the instigator of it and he
[11:39] arose
[11:40] on that easter morning and then from
[11:43] there he went and seated on her
[11:45] you know what it means to sit down it
[11:48] means
[11:48] it is finished
[11:52] he has performed the work
[11:56] he comes to you and he lets you know
[12:00] i've already done all that
[12:03] is required
[12:07] he shows you he takes you back away and
[12:09] let you know
[12:10] it's for you personally what's this this
[12:13] is the work of our boys
[12:14] it's the work of our kinsmen
[12:17] it's the work of our lovely lord jesus
[12:22] that's what the gospel is to be about
[12:25] it's not
[12:27] it's not a man talking about an event
[12:30] i hope you understand it's not a man
[12:33] a preacher it's not a man talking about
[12:36] an event
[12:37] but it's god coming and taking
[12:40] the vessel of that man and speaking
[12:42] personally
[12:44] to your heart
[12:47] that's the real gospel so
[12:51] it's gone as he broods over that life
[12:55] as we said god he god re is the renewing
[12:58] of the holy spirit
[13:00] through through repentance through water
[13:02] baptism
[13:03] through sanctification a new heart a new
[13:06] spirit it's the holy spirit at work
[13:09] he's bringing us to a place to cooperate
[13:14] with the vision he already saw
[13:17] see before we were not in any
[13:19] cooperation you could hear the word
[13:21] well not today oh yes yeah
[13:24] oh no that's too hard all right it was
[13:26] there was nothing going it was no
[13:28] interest yet there was something that
[13:29] you could
[13:30] witness and say but i know i know it's
[13:32] truth i know there's something truth but
[13:34] you weren't willing
[13:35] to commit yourself
[13:38] how long suffering he is
[13:42] if it had been up to you and me we'd
[13:44] have done drawn it off the 1st
[13:45] 2nd 5th 50th
[13:48] he's only obligated one time is that
[13:50] right but you see god is working
[13:53] it's god breaking down that first
[13:56] nature the darkness that's there and as
[13:59] you yield to that in obedience and just
[14:01] simply as the words coming forth
[14:03] you say yes lord be it unto me and allow
[14:06] the word to move
[14:08] as brother branham would say it like
[14:09] this entire transformation
[14:11] when he's praying at the beginning of
[14:13] that service he said oh god
[14:15] let the word of god come now and move
[14:18] through us lord while the word is going
[14:21] forward
[14:24] thank you lord i tell you if we can come
[14:27] with that kind of
[14:28] expectation locked in like that i could
[14:32] take much time here but
[14:33] i believe as believers that that ought
[14:35] to be something and i'm talking to those
[14:36] on the internet and to those all across
[14:38] that come here
[14:39] we are not coming together as just a
[14:43] protractive meeting
[14:47] we're coming here because we mean
[14:50] business
[14:54] i want to be changed
[14:58] i want to be transformed
[15:01] amen i i want to grow
[15:06] amen i want to give myself to him i
[15:08] don't want to just it's not just come
[15:10] and say
[15:10] okay yeah you know it's a time or it's a
[15:12] duty or no no
[15:14] it's greater than that listen let me
[15:15] tell you something it's recognizing
[15:17] this is the words of life
[15:22] it's a bread of life that's going forth
[15:27] we value that as children of god
[15:30] and notice paul goes into this here in
[15:33] second thessalonians chapter 2
[15:35] verse 13 and 14 he says but we are bound
[15:38] to give thanks
[15:39] always to god for you brethren
[15:42] beloved of the lord because
[15:46] god hath from the beginning
[15:49] chosen you to salvation through
[15:52] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[15:55] of the truth notice god hath chosen you
[15:59] but his choosing did not allow you
[16:02] to skip or to move from one place
[16:06] just to another but remember it has to
[16:09] be
[16:10] a process he has chosen you
[16:13] chosen to what to be born again
[16:17] his choosing his life is allotted it's
[16:20] given
[16:21] that we might be quickened he has chosen
[16:24] us
[16:26] he has drawn us to that place to
[16:29] to salvation to sanctification of the
[16:32] spirit
[16:32] and belief of the truth he has the one
[16:35] working on us
[16:36] you can say well you know i repented but
[16:39] before you could repent
[16:41] it took a a part of the renewing of the
[16:44] holy spirit
[16:45] to even move your heart and your life to
[16:47] that place
[16:50] and then even our minds being even set
[16:52] in order for holiness
[16:54] it takes a work out the holy spirit
[16:57] it takes a continual work of his working
[17:01] in our life amen oh i'm trying not to
[17:04] get ahead on messages
[17:08] i'm gonna just say it like this look
[17:10] what paul said
[17:11] notice it through sanctification of
[17:14] the spirit
[17:17] the spirit brings the sanctifying work
[17:21] and belief of the truth
[17:26] whereunto he called you look at this
[17:29] statement
[17:30] where unto called you
[17:33] by our gospel
[17:38] paul's letting them know god has used
[17:42] the gospel which is his revelation that
[17:46] he has given to us
[17:48] now that revelation is sounding out
[17:50] remember god didn't give that
[17:52] that wasn't for paul alone that
[17:54] revelation
[17:55] was to be sounded out like a trumpet
[17:59] and what was it to do that truth that
[18:02] trumpet
[18:03] that revelation as it's blown is to
[18:06] sound and take a hold of the hearts and
[18:10] lives that have been
[18:11] chosen too salvation
[18:16] and what is it it's god calling you
[18:19] to himself
[18:26] you see this is where
[18:30] we come under that inspiration of the
[18:33] holy spirit
[18:37] inspiration inspiration
[18:40] we know that god that as
[18:43] a as as as the word of god as it clearly
[18:46] says
[18:47] all word every word is inspired
[18:51] but god takes his word
[18:54] and as the inspiration of the holy
[18:56] spirit is coming out
[18:58] in that word it is god who is inspiring
[19:02] us
[19:03] unto all holiness let me just say it
[19:06] like this
[19:07] it is the brooding of the holy spirit
[19:10] of what in the beginning remember there
[19:12] is an objective
[19:14] that is in mind and the brooding of the
[19:17] holy spirit
[19:18] you see what takes place on the first
[19:21] day
[19:21] well look yeah in order here god is
[19:24] preparing
[19:25] through the brooding of the holy spirit
[19:27] remember the word is at work
[19:29] it is coming to bring forth and there is
[19:32] a brooding going over the earth
[19:34] brother adam would many times he would
[19:36] dramatize it in this way it's the holy
[19:38] spirit he said like the dove
[19:40] that is cooing and you you know
[19:42] sometimes you hear doves every morning
[19:44] they're cooing and
[19:45] you know you hear that cool what is it
[19:47] it's making love to the earth
[19:49] the holy spirit is drawing the earth in
[19:52] obedience
[19:54] not out of a law but out of a love
[19:56] affair
[19:59] it's yielding his presence his
[20:02] atmosphere
[20:04] his person it's creating a yielding
[20:08] hallelujah david was
[20:11] as guilty as a fox and a hen house
[20:15] he sat there in what he had did with
[20:18] bathsheba
[20:20] it took the wisdom of god brooding
[20:23] in that moment when david was sitting
[20:26] there and you know
[20:27] god had nathanael to speak the way he
[20:29] did
[20:30] and talk about you know uh you know i
[20:32] don't want to go into the whole story
[20:34] for sake of time but at any rate here
[20:37] it took the brooding of the holy spirit
[20:39] in wisdom
[20:40] in order to break that hardness
[20:43] in order to break that condition because
[20:46] that condition listen to me now
[20:48] david had not lost his covenant but he
[20:50] had fallen
[20:51] out of fellowship but god's desire i
[20:54] want you to catch this
[20:56] this was not david this was god
[20:59] seeking after david it was not
[21:02] adam in the beginning crying out god god
[21:05] where are you it was god come down adam
[21:09] adam where are thou and it's the same
[21:12] way in our life
[21:13] if there's something that's out alive
[21:15] it's not us it's god the holy spirit
[21:18] that is calling dan look at david's
[21:21] setting
[21:21] in the condition he was in but the holy
[21:23] spirit
[21:24] brooding upon his life he brought him to
[21:27] a place
[21:28] of openness
[21:32] unbelief will try to close you off
[21:35] you know try to close them a person off
[21:37] in condemnation
[21:39] other things like that but if you allow
[21:40] the holy spirit
[21:42] brother he knows how to open you up
[21:46] don't worry if he ain't got you yet
[21:47] he'll get you
[21:50] if you're out of sync with god he'll get
[21:52] you
[21:55] because remember he said i will in no
[21:58] wise
[21:59] cast out amen so if you say oh man i'm
[22:03] brother samuel you know god just told me
[22:05] i ain't welcome
[22:06] right now you need to stomp your foot
[22:07] and say you lying devil
[22:09] because jesus said that they will come
[22:12] to me
[22:13] and i will in no wise cast out but and
[22:16] god does not
[22:17] cast you out
[22:20] it is unbelief that rises to where you
[22:23] allow it to rise
[22:25] and then there's a distance between you
[22:26] and god to where
[22:28] faith becomes obscure but god comes
[22:32] to do what energize our faith
[22:37] but sometimes before our faith can never
[22:39] be energized
[22:40] there's repentance that has to be made
[22:44] amen amen
[22:47] his brooding never stopped he did not
[22:49] stop with
[22:50] when the heavens and earth were
[22:52] separated it did not stop
[22:55] when botany life began to come up
[22:59] it did not stop when wells it did not
[23:02] shout
[23:03] when other animal life came up it didn't
[23:06] stop
[23:08] but there on that sixth day
[23:13] here when one came up in the image
[23:17] of the one who was doing the brooding
[23:22] who achieved that god god's achievement
[23:27] god achieved that you and i could look
[23:30] and say
[23:30] what's going on oh my first day
[23:34] huh lord you're still moving yeah
[23:37] second day you're still moving yeah
[23:40] thursday night lord you're still moving
[23:43] sunday comes around look
[23:45] you're still moving yeah monday comes
[23:47] around look you're still moving
[23:56] one that is in his image
[24:01] mother and father brought forth this
[24:04] under a law of god
[24:05] and it bears their image
[24:09] but only god can bring forth a
[24:12] son and daughter of god that bears his
[24:16] image and he broods over their life
[24:20] he cools to their life making love to
[24:23] their life
[24:32] hallelujah jesus second corinthians 3
[24:36] verse 1
[24:38] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[24:42] or need we and some others
[24:46] epistles of commendation to you or
[24:48] letters of commendation from you know
[24:50] paul's referring to before they would
[24:52] ever receive
[24:53] an evangelist a teacher or whomever into
[24:56] this particular church
[24:57] it was not a man showing up and saying i
[24:59] believe the message and i'm a preacher
[25:01] no no no no i think we probably need to
[25:03] get back to this
[25:05] this is this is this is apostolic the
[25:08] man had to have
[25:08] letters of commendation remember paul
[25:12] would write
[25:12] letters regarding men and say these men
[25:16] these men are on why it's a church
[25:21] it's a safeguard the body
[25:24] there ought to be a life that's
[25:26] commendable
[25:29] are you with me not just somebody who's
[25:31] a good man but a person who is stable
[25:33] amen we can preach on that but you
[25:35] understand there have to be
[25:36] letters of commendation but paul is
[25:40] saying
[25:40] what letters of commendation do we need
[25:42] to you
[25:45] not speaking this ignorantly he's having
[25:48] them to look
[25:50] at what god has done in their life
[25:55] look at this in verse two ye are our
[25:59] epistle written in our hearts then can i
[26:02] just let me just teach a little bit
[26:05] paul was not making paul lights
[26:11] you with me paul was not
[26:14] making uh images of paul
[26:18] no paul the image that was being given
[26:22] notice
[26:23] ye are our epistle you are our epistle
[26:27] that which god has revealed and placed
[26:30] in our heart
[26:34] where god puts the word
[26:40] and known and read of all men
[26:44] for as much look at verse three ye are
[26:47] manifestly
[26:48] declared to be the epistle
[26:52] of christ now wait a minute paul just
[26:54] said our epistle
[26:57] now in verse 3 says the epistle of
[26:59] christ ministered by us
[27:02] what he's saying is we are one with this
[27:04] revelation
[27:07] what god has revealed that indeed
[27:11] that jesus christ is the same it's god
[27:15] come down from glory now that same god
[27:19] who went to calvary who was buried he
[27:22] rose again and
[27:23] now he is seated and has sent
[27:26] back the holy ghost what does the holy
[27:30] ghost come to do
[27:31] the holy ghost comes to point to a
[27:34] finished work
[27:35] the holy ghost coming in a meeting it
[27:38] reveals
[27:39] christ is seated in power
[27:43] hallelujah
[27:46] and this and this
[27:50] is where they were in acts 19 let me
[27:53] finish reading the scripture
[27:55] you are ministered by us written not
[27:58] with ink
[28:01] but with the spirit of the living god
[28:04] not in tables of stone but in fleshly
[28:07] tables
[28:09] of the heart see this is where god said
[28:12] i'll put
[28:12] my spirit into you how does god
[28:16] how does god put his spirit into you and
[28:19] me
[28:20] by his word
[28:24] by his word think of it remember back
[28:27] what was saying moments ago you may have
[28:30] started your journey
[28:32] and someone could have said all you have
[28:35] to do
[28:37] is believe on the son of god believe
[28:41] that he has died for your sins he paid
[28:44] it all
[28:44] he covered it he died and he rose again
[28:47] for your justification your sins
[28:51] are forgiven you raise up and say
[28:55] i accept that
[28:59] i accept that that's god dealing with
[29:02] your life
[29:05] you had to have a start somewhere
[29:09] it's just like in this church you might
[29:11] have come in for a long time
[29:12] but all of a sudden the holy spirit
[29:14] starts dealing with your life there's
[29:15] got to be
[29:16] a start somewhere
[29:21] is that right and to see a person
[29:25] you can only you can only
[29:29] uh walk in what light is revealed to you
[29:34] you can't walk in any more light than
[29:35] what's revealed to you this is why
[29:38] what's important is not and this is for
[29:40] everybody
[29:41] it's not important do not be anxious
[29:45] stay yielded this is in every one of our
[29:49] life
[29:49] because the gospel brings us to real
[29:53] rest
[29:54] it brings us to trust in him you see
[29:57] even as god
[29:58] deals with the life and we repent of our
[30:00] sins what's it doing that is also
[30:02] building
[30:02] faith in our life to trust him in
[30:06] sanctification it sets our mind in order
[30:10] he's giving us strength to do what
[30:11] even when we it may be not feeling it
[30:13] but we look at that and say
[30:15] this is not pleasing to god god has made
[30:17] this known to me by his word so in the
[30:19] name of jesus christ i lay it down for
[30:22] your glory lord god
[30:23] not us trying to do it but god take it
[30:26] out of my life
[30:29] see it's us making ourselves available
[30:31] allowing god to work
[30:34] but you can only walk in what light is
[30:37] presented to you
[30:41] because the light that's presented is
[30:44] the requirements or the expectation
[30:46] or the path that's laid before you
[30:49] but when more light is come
[30:52] then the path becomes open you know the
[30:56] bible says
[30:56] that the path shines brighter and
[30:59] brighter
[31:00] unto that perfect day
[31:05] god moving in your life is like the
[31:07] morning breaking
[31:09] are you with me who is this that cometh
[31:13] as fair as the morning
[31:14] it's like the morning breaking in your
[31:15] life
[31:17] and as you walk on with god what happens
[31:19] more light
[31:21] right i know i'm talking to the brothers
[31:24] even
[31:25] you know i like watching the sun rise
[31:26] and you know sometimes mamas that don't
[31:28] like watching sunrise but they're up
[31:29] with the child with the babies and and
[31:31] they have to watch the sunrise anyhow
[31:32] but you but you know how you know one of
[31:34] the first times i ever drove
[31:35] all night a few times and my it's all
[31:38] it's it's a you know i'm talking about
[31:40] it's a different thing man when that
[31:42] light's coming up it does get real
[31:44] dark before the day breaks
[31:47] you know what darkness looks like it
[31:49] seems like it's a greater
[31:51] impossibility but don't give
[31:54] up that's when god shows up
[32:00] light continues to break forth you
[32:03] cannot compare
[32:04] the morning to the noonday sun what is
[32:07] different
[32:07] same sun different position
[32:13] it's good bringing us in position of the
[32:16] sun
[32:17] you know what i'm talking about you know
[32:20] you know you get up in the morning right
[32:21] now
[32:22] and i look and say 45 degrees man i'm
[32:24] gonna need a
[32:25] a big old sweatshirt this morning maybe
[32:26] a jacket and a sock hat over time i
[32:28] might even need some gloves on there
[32:30] on my my little fingertips when i go
[32:32] outside
[32:33] yeah just maria i know you need them
[32:38] 70 degrees you're wearing them but you
[32:41] understand look what it is right now you
[32:42] know what i'm talking about the bill
[32:43] it's so cold of a morning but by the
[32:45] time it gets to noonday
[32:48] you get out there in the sun you're like
[32:50] oh man this is this is too much
[32:52] i got to take this off and it it's why
[32:54] it's this
[32:55] it's the same sun that you saw in the
[32:57] morning it's rose
[32:58] in a greater intensity and it starts
[33:02] bringing or causing you
[33:04] to change why are you changing you're
[33:06] responding
[33:07] to the position of the sun that you are
[33:11] under and that's what
[33:14] the son of god the son the holy ghost
[33:19] the word as it's moving in your life
[33:22] there is a transformation that's taking
[33:25] place
[33:26] in your life you can look at your life
[33:30] and say
[33:31] it's not the same as it was in the
[33:32] morning he's become greater
[33:37] he's become sweeter there's things he
[33:40] deals with me on now
[33:41] i can just say i just can't take this no
[33:44] more
[33:47] let that go maybe i responded like that
[33:50] you know
[33:50] many years in the past but under the
[33:52] light of the sun
[33:54] it's baking out greenness
[33:57] in my life
[34:02] but we caught them leap there
[34:07] remember saying in acts 19 here were
[34:09] some real believers
[34:11] in the upper coast of ephesus they had a
[34:14] man
[34:15] a preacher ah
[34:18] his name slips my mind right now who was
[34:20] that that man
[34:21] was up there preaching in acts 19.
[34:24] apollos
[34:26] i needed your helper but apollos the
[34:29] bible said
[34:30] he was preaching that jesus was the
[34:32] christ
[34:33] but you see when paul got there to them
[34:37] paul began to notice and he asked him he
[34:40] says
[34:42] have you received the holy ghost since
[34:46] ye believed see they believed
[34:49] they had already believed but now what's
[34:53] he doing
[34:53] he's taking where they're not aware they
[34:56] weren't aware
[34:58] that the sacrifice jesus who is the
[35:01] christ had already been offered up
[35:03] and not only offered up but had rose
[35:06] again
[35:07] seated in power and has sent back the
[35:09] holy ghost
[35:10] they didn't know that so how could they
[35:14] ask for something they didn't know was
[35:16] available
[35:19] light came to let them know this
[35:23] is what's available you say you could
[35:26] have been sitting in a church
[35:28] and a church could have you could have
[35:30] taught well if you just believe
[35:32] you're born again but there's something
[35:34] in you even though you can say
[35:35] praise god i'm i'm born again but yet
[35:37] you know something's not right
[35:40] yes it's a calling there's a calling
[35:43] amen
[35:44] that calling is not just something in
[35:46] earth
[35:47] that call is from the other side
[35:52] but there's got to be a voice on earth
[35:55] that that call and that call is not just
[35:58] your name
[35:59] that call is the call of the world
[36:02] upon your life
[36:06] like geese that are flying around
[36:10] you start seeing the geese right now
[36:11] they're starting to swarm
[36:13] the birds starting to swarm i'm gonna
[36:15] see them on the grass and stuff
[36:17] i mean you know look here you say my
[36:19] goodness i ain't seen this many birds
[36:21] all summer
[36:21] and it's like they're covering the grass
[36:23] what are they doing they're swarming
[36:25] they're preparing
[36:27] for migration
[36:31] you say that's instinct i say it's god
[36:39] but that call was to them in acts 19
[36:43] and paul remember paul said he asked
[36:46] them here's a diagnosis
[36:48] he said how were you baptized they said
[36:51] we were baptized unto repentance
[36:54] john's baptism the repentance of their
[36:56] sins
[36:57] because see the sacrifice hadn't been
[36:58] offered yet
[37:00] for them to unknow that it hadn't had
[37:02] already been offered
[37:03] they didn't know that more light
[37:07] what's coming they were a part of that
[37:10] light you understand
[37:11] they were a part of their life brother
[37:12] joshua we were a part of that light it
[37:14] was not me and you that found the light
[37:16] the light found us
[37:19] it was not you and me oh i was searching
[37:21] for god i was seeking for god
[37:23] the reason there was a hunger is because
[37:25] god put that hunger
[37:27] inside of you you couldn't be
[37:30] satisfied
[37:34] this could be satisfied they're fine
[37:38] they go to church hey okay
[37:42] but there's something different there's
[37:44] a hunger within your life
[37:46] i want to see him i want to see him
[37:51] i want to go up to his door i want to
[37:53] knock on his door
[37:54] i want to talk to him
[37:57] who put that inside of you he did
[38:04] sunday school didn't do it setting on
[38:07] mama's lap didn't do it
[38:09] thank god for all those things but he
[38:11] put it in there
[38:20] inspiration came to them there
[38:24] in acts 19 and they were baptized in the
[38:28] name of jesus christ
[38:30] for the remission of their sins and paul
[38:33] laid his hands upon them
[38:35] and they received the holy ghost
[38:39] how could they receive the holy ghost
[38:41] without the word
[38:43] being are you with me
[38:47] you see the holy ghost it doesn't travel
[38:49] outside of the word
[38:52] it comes through the word this is what
[38:54] brings a true birth
[38:57] this is why coming back to our thought
[39:00] washing of regeneration
[39:04] renewing of the holy ghost this is why
[39:06] jesus said
[39:08] you must be born of the water
[39:11] born of the word right the washing
[39:15] of water by the word
[39:18] a word that comes to purify a word that
[39:22] comes to cleanse
[39:23] a word that comes to challenge our
[39:26] life because it's not just challenging
[39:29] what's god doing
[39:30] he's breaking the darkness from around
[39:33] our life
[39:33] that a real son or daughter can come
[39:37] forth
[39:38] like a palm lily that's down beneath the
[39:41] mock and the scum
[39:42] and the gum of all of that water but
[39:45] beneath
[39:46] that water there is upon lily
[39:50] though you can't see it it's there but
[39:53] the light
[39:54] the sun it draws that pan lily you can
[39:57] look
[39:58] day one i don't see no pond lily day two
[40:00] on and on what's happening
[40:02] it's drawing it from the bottom
[40:05] and eventually that pond lily it gets to
[40:08] the top
[40:09] of that water and it shoots forth
[40:12] the glory that was within it
[40:15] the light has brought it to glory
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:21] what did the light shining
[40:25] released the glory that was inside
[40:30] of that pond hallelujah
[40:36] must be born of the water and of the
[40:38] spirit
[40:39] amen
[40:42] thank you so why the real evidence of
[40:45] the holy ghost
[40:46] is being in the word for our day
[40:52] genuine faith in the word being all the
[40:55] way in that word
[40:58] where our life is lining with that word
[41:01] where we're seeing him so something has
[41:05] been explained to us
[41:06] we see him right people can look for
[41:09] nail scars hands
[41:10] you don't see that but we see him as he
[41:13] reveals himself
[41:15] he makes himself known who is doing that
[41:20] it's him it is given to
[41:23] us
[41:26] this is why paul would say
[41:31] in the scripture paul would say
[41:34] the letter killeth but the spirit giveth
[41:38] life
[41:39] amen see it's not christian government
[41:44] and i would speak from the new i speak
[41:46] to others i speak to those that even has
[41:48] sat here for a long i speak to all of us
[41:51] it's not the idea of christianity
[41:55] is not to convert people by the
[41:58] government of christianity hey
[42:02] muslim nations if you don't believe like
[42:05] they believe
[42:07] right and every on and on and on
[42:11] you talk to somebody about being a
[42:13] christian yeah what are they doing
[42:17] suppressing people by fear
[42:20] controlling people by governments
[42:24] well let me just say this to you outside
[42:27] of the spirit
[42:28] word the spirit revealed truth it
[42:31] becomes nothing more than christian
[42:33] government
[42:34] a person can do everything out here now
[42:37] i want you to understand me
[42:38] they can do have everything seemingly in
[42:41] order
[42:42] out here the pharisees did you couldn't
[42:45] lay a finger
[42:46] on their life out here but the finger of
[42:49] god came down and touched this down here
[42:52] the finger of god came down to the
[42:54] inside and said
[42:56] graveyards and it was a sin for them to
[42:59] touch the dead
[43:01] are you with me they could not be near a
[43:03] dead person
[43:04] if you're are you with me if you're near
[43:06] a dead person
[43:07] you cannot come into the camp
[43:11] and jesus was letting them know you're
[43:13] full of
[43:14] dead men's bones
[43:17] their pride their indifference
[43:22] yet so religious
[43:28] who are you to tell me
[43:31] ah that was all together born in sin
[43:35] who are you too right
[43:39] that's a bad devil who is a bad devil
[43:46] but christian government's not the idea
[43:52] does that mean that we don't
[43:56] coming with the word and giving
[43:59] direction and and
[44:00] no we give direction by the word right
[44:02] we direct our households
[44:05] is that right we direct our children
[44:10] we don't make them christians that's
[44:13] god's job
[44:15] but while they're in our house they're
[44:17] going to live like christians
[44:19] will you preach what means you want amen
[44:24] that's a whole separate part but
[44:27] christian government is not the idea
[44:33] intellects will never do it
[44:37] as i said we believe in the mind being
[44:39] set in order for holiness we believe in
[44:41] that don't we
[44:43] but remember it's a love affair
[44:47] sanctification your mind being set in
[44:49] order for holiness is where you begin to
[44:51] think on certain things
[44:53] you begin to dwell on on certain things
[44:56] as far as saying
[44:57] ah this in it speaking to bother you
[45:00] never bothered you before
[45:03] things begin to stand out to you but it
[45:05] stands out to you to measure that you
[45:07] recognize what is not pleasing to god
[45:10] hey let me bring it on up to all of us
[45:11] here paul said let every man know how to
[45:14] possess his vessel
[45:15] unto sanctification and honor is that
[45:19] right
[45:20] all of us like that song that we sing
[45:23] here
[45:23] lord keep me sanctified
[45:26] is that right this is why this is why
[45:29] times you come from your job
[45:30] and you wonder why am i feeling the way
[45:32] i am you need a bath
[45:35] and i'm not talking about because you
[45:36] physically stink you might
[45:38] but you need a good washing in the holy
[45:40] ghost
[45:41] lord wash my attitude set my attitude
[45:44] right lord what is it
[45:46] it's sanctifying that's what washing of
[45:49] the word does
[45:50] it cleanses us
[45:54] sanctifying by the word it doesn't
[45:57] condem
[45:58] illusions it lifts up
[46:06] let me read this quote here there's many
[46:10] but the bible said here in israel in the
[46:12] church part two
[46:13] now there's many that pretend to be in
[46:16] there
[46:17] there's many that's warring themselves
[46:21] and trying to live right and trying to
[46:23] press in
[46:24] i don't know about them but if they're
[46:27] in there
[46:28] it's just as easy to live a christian
[46:31] life
[46:32] as it is to live any life
[46:36] what makes a difference where you're at
[46:40] where you're at
[46:45] because it says it's just as easy to
[46:47] live a christian life as it is to live
[46:49] any life
[46:50] because you're in christ and nothing
[46:52] else but just so full
[46:54] of the holy spirit lead you and guide
[46:56] you and direct you why
[46:57] sure you'll make mistakes and fall
[47:00] but you can't stay down how can you
[47:04] keep his life down
[47:08] once you've been born of the holy ghost
[47:11] how can you keep
[47:12] that life down that raised
[47:15] that body up and has raised you up
[47:22] what part of you will fall not that part
[47:26] this but this on the inside what would
[47:30] it do
[47:30] how does it raise it back up it doesn't
[47:32] raise it back up and say oh that wasn't
[47:34] me
[47:35] i don't know why i did that i don't know
[47:36] no no the love of the love of god on the
[47:39] inside says father
[47:40] forgive me forgive me lord i didn't mean
[47:44] to do that lord jesus
[47:45] that's what it does the love of god
[47:49] doesn't make
[47:50] excuses
[47:54] why sure you'll make mistakes and fall
[47:56] but you can't stay
[47:58] down look at this it's simple simple
[48:00] because no more than could you make a
[48:01] stalk of corn
[48:02] or a sycamore tree you can't do it jesus
[48:05] said by their fruits you shall know them
[48:07] you have everlasting life
[48:12] amen how many say praise be to god
[48:17] praise the lord praise be to god amen
[48:21] hallelujah you see
[48:24] i'm just just your stuff
[48:29] this is the leading
[48:32] of the lord that moves us
[48:36] and brings us from a place
[48:42] through his working and where
[48:45] it brings us to a place to where he's
[48:48] the one
[48:49] completely seated in our life
[48:53] see to the natural mind
[48:57] this in itself it's a mystery
[49:00] the person think how in the world can
[49:02] somebody have that much joy
[49:04] it just depends on where you're at now
[49:07] look
[49:08] when god first deals with your life you
[49:10] repent you might have all sorts of
[49:12] baggage when it needs to be cleaned out
[49:15] but you know what there's a joy that i
[49:17] know my sins
[49:18] are forgiven what do i do keep walking
[49:22] i said keep walking you see there's a
[49:26] joy
[49:28] so what do i do you you take god at his
[49:31] word
[49:32] your mind is set in order for holiness
[49:34] you know that there are things
[49:36] that god i need this out of my life but
[49:38] don't become focused on the things
[49:41] keep your eyes on jesus
[49:44] and what do i do believe him by faith
[49:48] lay it down i lay it down in the name of
[49:52] jesus christ that's not emotional work
[49:54] up we're doing it by the word
[49:56] you see this is where it comes back to
[49:58] our lives meaning business with god
[50:02] it's not just saying god i just say what
[50:05] lord i just said right here
[50:07] jesus you go ahead whatever you want to
[50:09] take lord
[50:10] you just go ahead take it lord just go
[50:12] and take it no
[50:14] you've got to mean business with god
[50:18] there's things that even after you've
[50:19] crossed listen when you cross into the
[50:22] promised land
[50:23] that is not a bed of ease in canaan
[50:26] battles are fought
[50:28] that's where overcomers manifest the
[50:31] overcoming strength
[50:32] and power of almighty god
[50:38] samuel i experienced temptation but
[50:40] greater is he that is in you
[50:43] than he that's in the world this is
[50:46] where we mean
[50:46] business with god god has touched our
[50:49] life
[50:50] and we mean business with god
[50:54] you'll never get anywhere with god even
[50:56] those are on the internet or anybody
[50:58] here
[50:59] you never get anywhere with god
[51:03] without you taking him at his word
[51:08] i don't feel it it's not about your
[51:09] feelings remember
[51:11] when he called you he's not looking at
[51:14] you
[51:15] he's looking at the sacrifice
[51:20] and the sacrifice every single
[51:23] sin everything was met in jesus christ
[51:28] and when he rose on that easter morning
[51:30] he triumphed over every principality
[51:34] there was not a devil could hold him
[51:36] down
[51:38] and he walked around upon this earth god
[51:41] showed
[51:42] the disciples let me show you god took
[51:45] that and said let me show you my power
[51:48] here was a dead lifeless body
[51:51] brother braham said cold laying there
[51:55] pale in the grave but here
[51:58] on that easter morning according to the
[52:01] word came that resurrection
[52:03] power and brother it didn't matter how
[52:06] cold
[52:06] or how pale that that body was it didn't
[52:09] matter what had it sealed in
[52:11] there is nothing could keep the spirit
[52:14] of god
[52:15] from raising up jesus christ
[52:21] there's not enough faults there's not
[52:23] enough failures there's not enough sin
[52:25] there's not enough darkness
[52:26] there's not enough devils there's not
[52:29] enough
[52:29] to stop the resurrection power
[52:32] of jesus christ
[52:36] if god be for us
[52:40] who can be against us
[52:46] said glory be to god in the highest
