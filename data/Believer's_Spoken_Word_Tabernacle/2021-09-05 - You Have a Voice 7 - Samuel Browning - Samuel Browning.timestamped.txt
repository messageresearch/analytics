[35:53] passing day
[35:55] amen we just thank god for his mercy in
[35:58] this hour
[35:59] we're just thankful amen to be a part of
[36:02] the very redeeming work of almighty god
[36:05] amen it becomes more as i said more and
[36:08] more precious to us to see that god has
[36:11] everything provided
[36:14] you know when you think of it when god
[36:16] let him out of egypt
[36:18] uh they didn't
[36:20] they didn't have to think will i have
[36:22] clothes sufficient will my shoes hold
[36:24] out
[36:26] they didn't that was not even the
[36:27] concern
[36:29] the concern here they had cried to god
[36:32] for deliverance
[36:34] that was the one
[36:35] focus
[36:36] they weren't focused on anything else
[36:39] and everything that was within the
[36:41] promise
[36:42] god unfolded
[36:44] their clothes the bible says their
[36:46] clothes
[36:47] did not wear out
[36:50] their shoes didn't wear out
[36:52] you tell me what clothing or shoe
[36:54] manufacturer makes something like that
[36:55] now
[36:57] you know what i'm saying
[36:59] i mean you go to buy things right now
[37:00] and i will tell you a five-year plan so
[37:02] i asked the guy i said why years ago i
[37:05] said why are you selling me a five-year
[37:06] plan on this he said to tell you the
[37:08] truth sir he said everything's made out
[37:10] of plastic he said it it only lasts
[37:12] about five years anymore i mean my mom
[37:14] and dad had freezers and refrigerated
[37:16] from when i before i was born
[37:18] and it continued on through most of my
[37:20] life
[37:21] so now you know everything is
[37:23] man and making it better making it
[37:25] better
[37:28] man gets a hold of it and makes it
[37:29] cheaper
[37:31] that's the same way if it's just
[37:33] manhandling the word
[37:35] it does not produce the original product
[37:39] but when god when god takes a hold of
[37:41] his word oh my it'll produce the
[37:44] original product that'll stand the test
[37:45] of time
[37:48] amen
[37:49] oh my i'm glad god has everything
[37:51] provided
[37:52] amen we just want to say
[37:55] we're just so thankful to the lord
[37:57] for his mercy this morning and allowing
[37:59] us to come together
[38:01] i want to i know it was already
[38:03] mentioned we want to welcome back
[38:05] brother brother joshua
[38:07] i certainly like to
[38:09] amen
[38:10] [Applause]
[38:15] amen we certainly have missed our
[38:17] brother and uh
[38:20] but i want to just read this from
[38:22] brother joshua he wanted to convey this
[38:24] to you
[38:25] may the lord jesus christ bless you
[38:28] i want to offer you thanksgivings i want
[38:30] to thank us thank you the saints of god
[38:32] for the love you showed for me and all
[38:34] the prayers and support you provided for
[38:37] me before
[38:38] during and after my surgery i also want
[38:40] to thank the lord jesus christ jehovah
[38:42] rafa and the great comforter because
[38:45] despite all the discouragement he heard
[38:47] your prayers and through his
[38:49] never-ending grace and mercy he provided
[38:52] me with comfort and faith during the
[38:53] whole time of my healing after the
[38:55] surgery
[38:56] it has been a challenging time dealing
[38:58] with pain and a prospect of many
[39:01] potential post surgical related
[39:03] complications
[39:05] but through it all god has been faithful
[39:08] even as i am still on this healing
[39:10] journey
[39:11] it's been also such a blessing to have
[39:13] you all watching after me in one way or
[39:16] another through your prayers phone calls
[39:18] and visits may the lord jesus christ
[39:20] bless you and return to you and
[39:22] hundredfold all that you have done for
[39:24] me
[39:25] bless you brother
[39:26] joshua amen
[39:32] amen i'm just so thankful to have amen
[39:35] each and every one of you i want to
[39:37] remind you as we get ready to turn into
[39:39] the word god bless you musicians thank
[39:41] you as we get ready to look into the
[39:43] word here this morning i want to remind
[39:45] you that this coming thursday
[39:47] we will not have service and the purpose
[39:50] as you seen on the calendar it's in
[39:52] light of the upcoming meetings that we
[39:55] have on saturday and sunday with brother
[39:59] darrell ward on saturday it will start
[40:01] at 6 00 and sunday at 11 and that the
[40:04] cancelling of the service on sunday well
[40:05] you know that's not an easy thing for me
[40:07] to do
[40:08] because i mean my we can have service
[40:11] every day of the week
[40:13] and just the the things that the word of
[40:15] the lord is just so rich and so precious
[40:17] to us but i know there's things
[40:19] sometimes that maybe that you have to
[40:21] attend to and you're kind of accustomed
[40:23] to doing that on saturday but it'll give
[40:25] you an opportunity if it's able to to
[40:28] kind of get those things out of the way
[40:29] so we can just have a time just to
[40:31] really focus in on these on these
[40:33] services
[40:34] and for brother daryl
[40:36] being here with us and like it is in any
[40:39] time of our life and
[40:41] i think we've said this more and more
[40:43] even this past year
[40:45] at least
[40:47] to me it always is something that we
[40:49] look at it and that is the lord willing
[40:51] so
[40:52] we i want you just to be in prayer
[40:54] for the services here saturday at 6 00
[40:58] and sunday at 11
[41:00] and
[41:00] let's just come just expecting just to
[41:03] receive from god
[41:05] amen brother brother daryl has just to
[41:07] me just i really appreciate brother
[41:09] darrell's ministry
[41:10] and we're we're expecting to hear from
[41:13] god
[41:14] and you know god has different gifts
[41:16] within the body god doesn't want all of
[41:19] us to be the same every gift it works
[41:22] different and just like what i mentioned
[41:24] before even like with brother daryl
[41:26] brother daryl's ministry is such a a
[41:28] ministry that works to so build faith
[41:31] and there's just so many things and god
[41:34] has used our brother in such a
[41:36] tremendous way i've witnessed it working
[41:38] with him with the young people uh also
[41:41] you know within other times and prayer
[41:43] lines and things and how that god is so
[41:46] moved in such a very special way
[41:48] and so we just want to just come with a
[41:51] real a real expectation will you be in
[41:53] prayer for that
[41:55] amen and just really work you know
[41:57] anything we do
[41:59] you know we're living in we're living in
[42:01] an age and
[42:02] whether we recognize it or not we can
[42:04] look at it and say well this age and
[42:07] these things are not affecting me
[42:09] the spirits of this age are this they
[42:12] are are the spirits remember brother
[42:14] bram says it comes with it's a soft easy
[42:16] living
[42:17] nervous tensions
[42:19] and that drawn to material things
[42:22] and all those things those are pressures
[42:25] that want to come our way and and
[42:27] probably every one of us because even
[42:30] after you've been filled with the spirit
[42:31] of god you still deal with soft easy
[42:35] living
[42:36] none of us wants to push a little bit or
[42:39] move a little bit or sacrifice a little
[42:41] bit but i can tell you this that every
[42:43] sacrifice that we make for the things of
[42:46] god
[42:47] uh well it won't be something years from
[42:48] now you'll have out this to the side of
[42:50] the curb waiting for the trash man to
[42:52] come on bulk day but everything you
[42:54] sacrifice that you really put in
[42:56] i tell you what it's eternal amen
[42:59] there's there's dividends that we reap
[43:00] from that amen in the prince of god so i
[43:03] just want to encourage you in that uh
[43:06] also remember the young people this
[43:08] coming
[43:09] friday evening
[43:11] uh there at our home we'll have the
[43:14] youth meeting and i had to fit it in
[43:15] there because lord willing i
[43:17] will be gone for a few days ministering
[43:19] in the middle of that of that next week
[43:22] so and but i'll be back here for that
[43:23] thursday service but i have to try to
[43:25] fit all that in and i didn't want to
[43:28] come back and you know preach somewhere
[43:30] else preach your thursday and then have
[43:31] a youth meeting friday and then have
[43:32] sunday service so
[43:34] i just have to try to
[43:36] i know my limitations so
[43:39] we just look to the lord well
[43:41] happy to be here
[43:43] amen how many just expecting amen to
[43:45] receive something from the lord this
[43:47] morning
[43:48] amen let's just go to him on a word of
[43:51] prayer and we'll just as we prepare to
[43:53] look into the word here this morning
[43:55] heavenly father
[43:57] lord we are just so thankful to be able
[43:59] lord to come together once again in the
[44:02] precious name of our lord jesus christ
[44:05] lord we believe that god even as we are
[44:08] gathered here lord you said that you
[44:10] would be in our midst and lord we sense
[44:13] your presence here knowing that god that
[44:15] the angels of god have taken their
[44:18] position lord around this building lord
[44:21] and father we ask that you lord will now
[44:23] come and just lord move aside oh god the
[44:27] man part lord and that you would speak
[44:29] to us lord and that god our ears our
[44:33] hearts would be inclined to hear from
[44:35] you lord
[44:36] we just lay aside all of the cares and
[44:40] frustrations and worries and all of
[44:42] those things we place them o god before
[44:45] you
[44:46] and lord for every need that's upon the
[44:48] hearts of your children
[44:50] lord we just invite you that you will
[44:53] just come in a very personal way father
[44:55] this morning may you lord just have your
[44:58] way in the name of jesus christ amen
[45:02] amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse
[45:05] 14.
[45:17] remember brothers i'll let you know when
[45:19] i when i need this i have some
[45:22] slide second corinthians 5
[45:27] 14.
[45:29] for the love of christ constraineth us
[45:33] because we thus judge that if one died
[45:36] for all
[45:37] then we're all
[45:39] dead
[45:40] that he died for all
[45:42] that they which live should not should
[45:45] not henceforth live unto themselves
[45:48] but unto him which died for them and
[45:50] rose again so paul is writing not a
[45:52] physical death
[45:54] but he's writing that where we were dead
[45:58] spiritually so he died
[46:02] that now
[46:03] he might come back and there would be a
[46:06] resurrection in our life
[46:10] of that seed of his own life that he
[46:14] sowed there
[46:16] remember as he revealed himself to john
[46:18] on the isle of patmos i am he that was
[46:21] dead
[46:22] and i'm alive forevermore
[46:24] is that right in the book of ephesians
[46:27] you were
[46:28] dead in sin and trespasses but now hath
[46:31] he
[46:32] quickened
[46:34] is that right so now verse 16 second
[46:37] corinthians 5 wherefore henceforth know
[46:40] we no man after the flesh
[46:43] yea though we have known christ after
[46:46] the flesh yet now henceforth
[46:49] know we him
[46:50] no more
[46:52] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[46:55] a new creature
[46:57] all things are passed away behold all
[47:00] things are become new
[47:02] and all things are of god who hath
[47:05] reconciled us
[47:08] who have reconciled us to himself
[47:11] by jesus christ
[47:13] and has given to us the ministry of
[47:17] reconciliation
[47:19] to wit that god was in christ
[47:21] reconciling the world unto himself
[47:25] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[47:29] and hath committed unto us the word of
[47:32] reconciliation
[47:34] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[47:38] as though god did beseech you
[47:41] by us we pray you and christ's dead be
[47:45] ye reconciled to god
[47:48] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[47:52] who knew no sin
[47:54] that we might be made the righteousness
[47:57] of god
[47:59] in
[48:00] him
[48:01] amen may god bless you and bless the
[48:03] being of the word as you're being seated
[48:05] i just going to continue to
[48:08] under that thought of you have a voice
[48:10] but i want to be very
[48:12] specific in examining this this morning
[48:15] of the living voice
[48:18] of god
[48:19] the living voice of god
[48:22] and the scriptures that we have have
[48:25] read from here
[48:27] this morning
[48:28] when we
[48:29] see there's a great responsibility that
[48:32] is given to us as believers
[48:35] and we recognize that when we as look
[48:38] here in the scripture that our lives
[48:40] when this
[48:41] when the revelation of jesus christ has
[48:45] really struck our hearts
[48:46] it's no longer us living our lives
[48:50] unto ourselves but it's unto him now
[48:54] who died and rose again
[48:56] and we we no longer paul wrote here we
[48:59] read from this in the scripture we no
[49:01] longer know christ in the flesh now paul
[49:04] is dealing with those and speaking to
[49:06] those where just some years prior to
[49:10] that there were those remember who
[49:12] walked
[49:13] when has god walked and was present
[49:16] there in the body of jesus christ and
[49:19] paul is declaring that right now we know
[49:22] no man after the flesh
[49:24] paul is declaring he came
[49:27] he paid the price and he ascended back
[49:30] on high now we know him
[49:33] as
[49:34] they knew him
[49:35] how did they know him
[49:37] they knew him as he revealed himself
[49:41] in the word amen is that right
[49:45] is so this is how they knew when he
[49:47] walked on the road to emmaus
[49:49] he didn't they their eyes were withheld
[49:52] that they should not know him
[49:55] so what did he do he took the word and
[49:57] he began to reveal
[49:59] the things the bible said concerning
[50:02] himself
[50:04] the events
[50:06] the modern events that were taking place
[50:08] christ himself begin to take the
[50:11] scriptures that was one time
[50:14] prophecy
[50:15] that had already been revealed that had
[50:18] already come flesh and were fulfilled
[50:21] now he's declaring that has been
[50:24] fulfilled so how did then how did they
[50:28] know him how do you and i know him we
[50:31] know him as he reveals himself in his
[50:35] word by his presence in this hour
[50:40] now that's the same way then
[50:43] with every son and daughter of god paul
[50:45] brings this right down i'm just trying
[50:46] to lay some of this for a little bit of
[50:48] a foundation of where i'm going to move
[50:50] here this morning it's the same way with
[50:53] every son and daughter of god that is
[50:55] baptized
[50:56] into christ we become a new creation
[51:01] of almighty god
[51:03] and all things the bible has said of the
[51:06] world are passed away
[51:08] there's a new man paul would write over
[51:10] that over and over there's a new man on
[51:13] the inside
[51:15] you see what has happened is there has
[51:18] been
[51:18] the inside man has been
[51:22] transformed or we could say
[51:25] quickened or made alive
[51:28] and now the earthly tabernacle that we
[51:31] walk in this earthly temple
[51:34] reflects
[51:35] an inward
[51:37] work that has taken place
[51:40] so now this only becomes the visible
[51:44] part that expresses there has been a new
[51:49] creation take place on the inside
[51:53] so this is where paul now we can bring
[51:55] the scripture even to our own self you
[51:57] no longer know no man after the flesh
[51:59] even in our own lives though we have our
[52:02] identity of our family trees or whatever
[52:05] nationality we are a part of but yet we
[52:08] recognize by the grace of god that we
[52:12] are sons and daughters of god so we are
[52:16] not known by the old life that we live
[52:20] but we are known now by the life of
[52:22] christ that has come to you and i and
[52:25] has made us new creatures so that we are
[52:29] a new creation in the same old temple
[52:33] and the things that this old temple used
[52:35] to reflect it no longer reflects
[52:38] why there's a new man on the inside
[52:42] is that right it's like you walk by you
[52:44] know you walk my house wow why are they
[52:46] changing the shutter colors they're
[52:47] going you know the pink and lime green
[52:50] and then leaving off the mob what's
[52:51] going on and sometimes you look and say
[52:53] no these it ain't the same person who's
[52:55] living there there there's there's a
[52:57] different person living there so the
[53:00] person on the inside who's living there
[53:02] it begins to reflect itself on the
[53:06] outside
[53:08] amen
[53:10] so it's a sovereign work of grace this
[53:13] is the work of god where god himself
[53:17] reconciles us to himself
[53:20] by jesus christ
[53:22] and god god became kin folks our kinsmen
[53:27] becoming one of us made in the likeness
[53:30] of sinful flesh that he might suffer and
[53:34] pay the ransom
[53:36] i want you just to listen to these
[53:37] points through the act of reconciliation
[53:41] that began in christ now i want you to
[53:44] catch this i the act of reconciliation
[53:47] that began in christ
[53:49] god dwelling in christ he's now
[53:53] continuing on that same work in redeemed
[53:57] subjects
[53:59] that is the lamb of god preserving his
[54:04] rights upon this earth
[54:08] hallelujah this is the continuation we
[54:12] are witnesses
[54:13] of him
[54:15] so now i want you to look at the orders
[54:17] we'll look at this here a little bit and
[54:19] just i'm just giving a highlight of
[54:21] points of these things of where i want
[54:23] to go
[54:24] i want you to notice the order that the
[54:26] reconciliation
[54:28] that was manifested that god was in
[54:31] christ
[54:32] reconciling the world unto
[54:36] himself and he is
[54:38] the word
[54:41] he was reconciling drawing
[54:44] there the world unto himself
[54:46] then through jesus christ and you see he
[54:49] is the word we are reconciled unto god
[54:53] by being baptized into the body of jesus
[54:56] christ by one spirit we receive the word
[55:01] of reconciliation
[55:03] remember we are reconciled and through
[55:06] that reconciliation
[55:08] then we receive the word of
[55:10] reconciliation
[55:12] and so then the word of reconciliation
[55:16] is the is the revelation of jesus christ
[55:20] to us
[55:21] personally
[55:22] that's what the new birth is
[55:25] are you hearing me now a person can say
[55:28] i know who jesus is
[55:31] he has revealed himself to me he is the
[55:34] son of god nobody can dispute what
[55:36] you've said
[55:38] is that right
[55:41] but does your life
[55:43] your actions your character match and
[55:46] reflect him to be the same
[55:49] that's the litmus test right there it's
[55:51] not just somebody who says i believe
[55:53] that jesus christ the son of god to say
[55:55] that then we even in that right there
[55:57] then now you are responsible to receive
[56:00] that same life inside of you to repent
[56:03] of your sins
[56:05] to be cleansed and to be born again of
[56:08] the spirit of god because you are
[56:09] declaring that he
[56:12] has made a way that i no longer have to
[56:15] be a servant
[56:17] of sin
[56:19] i can become now
[56:21] an expressed son and daughter of god
[56:25] is that right it takes away excuses
[56:28] so the word of reconciliation now moving
[56:32] in our life
[56:33] it is declared by the seal of the living
[56:37] god
[56:38] the token that we are covenant-born sons
[56:41] and daughters of god we are ambassadors
[56:44] of christ
[56:47] is that right
[56:50] with the seal the seal of the living god
[56:53] you know a seal like we we have you know
[56:55] sometimes you have to have things
[56:57] notarized
[56:58] and when they put the seal up on
[57:00] something there's papers you can't just
[57:01] take anywhere and have anything done
[57:03] they want it notarized
[57:05] is that right
[57:07] there's some different ones different
[57:09] sisters are setting here they are
[57:10] notaries
[57:12] and they have a special machine it
[57:14] doesn't matter if they have the
[57:15] qualifications it's not just their
[57:17] signature they have to put that that
[57:20] paper
[57:21] when they put that seal
[57:23] it presses itself into that paper that
[57:26] paper that was once just blank like that
[57:29] now takes on the impression
[57:33] of that seal and you know how it is when
[57:35] you feel it like that you feel it on the
[57:37] back side you feel it on the front side
[57:39] that's what the seal of the holy ghost
[57:42] does they're coming and going you are
[57:45] sealed into christ you are a reflection
[57:49] of god wherein your life was like a
[57:52] blank slate but it's come into the very
[57:55] press of the holy spirit and god has
[57:58] pressed his seal his image upon your
[58:01] life
[58:03] that's the seal of the living god it's
[58:05] god living his life through us that's
[58:08] the identification of what a real
[58:09] believer is and i want to just drop this
[58:12] this reconciliation that begins in our
[58:15] life with where the deposit of the word
[58:18] of reconciliation the holy ghost that
[58:21] reconciliation just doesn't stop here in
[58:23] this body
[58:25] amen reckons being reconciled back home
[58:29] amen soon and very soon in a moment in a
[58:32] twinkling of an eye there's to come a
[58:34] completion of this reconciliation to
[58:37] where our soul that has been redeemed
[58:39] then we receive that theory then the
[58:42] glorified body and here we come together
[58:45] a full reconciliation coming to the
[58:47] wedding supper to the millennium to the
[58:50] future home are you with me this
[58:52] reconciliation the work that has started
[58:55] in you
[58:56] does not stop
[58:58] amen
[59:00] it's a work of reconciliation
[59:03] now
[59:05] i've mentioned those things and i want
[59:07] to read
[59:09] this quote here from what house will you
[59:11] build me
[59:12] preached in tucson here
[59:15] i want you to listen how brother branham
[59:17] places this
[59:19] he says i know that each one of you
[59:22] if you feel like i do am so hungry to
[59:24] see the spirit of god moving i just
[59:27] can't hardly stand it
[59:30] some experiences i just had up in the
[59:32] mountain just just to feel that once
[59:35] again
[59:36] that's something that when i was first
[59:38] saved was so glorious to my heart
[59:42] and we can come into a place and we can
[59:44] sit and we see it among us
[59:47] that we're drying now remember what
[59:48] brother brother bram is talking now
[59:51] to a group of people
[59:53] okay
[59:54] that have gathered there in arizona
[59:57] but they they did not have a church to
[1:00:00] go to
[1:00:02] i want let me just say drop this here
[1:00:04] for a moment brother branham never
[1:00:06] advised him to follow him out there as a
[1:00:07] matter of fact he said don't do it
[1:00:10] you're with me i've been in those areas
[1:00:12] and press gotten you know the trailer
[1:00:14] court i went into some of those places
[1:00:16] and talking with different ones that
[1:00:17] have been even a part of those things
[1:00:19] brother brown never desired that to come
[1:00:22] in that way
[1:00:23] but remember what brother branham is
[1:00:25] saying are you with me what brother
[1:00:27] branham is seeing going on here he's
[1:00:29] seeing where people are not on sundays
[1:00:33] they're not going anywhere and their
[1:00:35] kids are out riding bicycles
[1:00:37] on sunday
[1:00:39] they're going about other things and
[1:00:40] brother brahma is looking and say wait a
[1:00:42] minute here what's he saying it is a
[1:00:44] burden on his heart because he knows
[1:00:47] there's got to be a place where the
[1:00:49] people are fed and this word is
[1:00:52] ministered we stay in fellowship let me
[1:00:55] just pause church doesn't save you but
[1:00:58] it keeps you in fellowship
[1:01:00] that's a direct quote
[1:01:01] you can't be as good outside of church
[1:01:04] as you can be in church that's another
[1:01:06] direct quote are you with me if the love
[1:01:08] of god's in your heart you can't wait
[1:01:10] until the church doors are open that's
[1:01:12] another quote there's another quote
[1:01:15] jesus always goes to church we can keep
[1:01:18] on going and going and going
[1:01:24] what brother branham is saying think of
[1:01:25] the title what house will you build me
[1:01:27] this is not just a title to speak a
[1:01:29] little something because brother perry
[1:01:32] comes up and preaches after brother
[1:01:34] branham takes this 30-some minutes if
[1:01:36] you haven't listened to this message
[1:01:37] what house will you build me go through
[1:01:39] it i've been through it over and over
[1:01:40] and over and over and over and brother
[1:01:42] branham as he's going into this he's
[1:01:44] finding amongst the people there where
[1:01:46] there's things that's going on and what
[1:01:48] is it it's not
[1:01:51] of the real message of the hour
[1:01:55] let me tell you something the message of
[1:01:57] the hour is not a movement of man
[1:02:00] it is the flow of almighty god from the
[1:02:04] throne of almighty god
[1:02:07] it's his life the love of god that moves
[1:02:09] down into our hearts so let me just read
[1:02:12] this here he says we come into a place
[1:02:15] and we can sit see it among us that
[1:02:17] we're drying
[1:02:19] as we sit here in the desert i get among
[1:02:22] my brethren they talk with me i talk
[1:02:24] with them also in a little way of
[1:02:26] watching feeling out there with the
[1:02:28] spirit as it was to see just the
[1:02:30] condition of that brother to see what's
[1:02:33] wrong what's going on
[1:02:35] i begin to feel us all
[1:02:38] reclining
[1:02:40] getting away
[1:02:41] from the spirit
[1:02:44] now everybody knows what recline recline
[1:02:46] is where you start just kind of relaxing
[1:02:48] and just kind of
[1:02:50] resting and there's no more pressing
[1:02:53] that's going on
[1:02:54] recounting like we got it made in the
[1:02:57] shade
[1:02:59] everything is peachy but that that's not
[1:03:02] that's not true
[1:03:03] that's a lie of the devil
[1:03:06] you're in a constant warfare until you
[1:03:10] cross onto the other side
[1:03:13] there's a battle that's going on let me
[1:03:15] just say this this is why you need the
[1:03:17] live ministry of the word to discern
[1:03:20] that spirit that would want to try to
[1:03:22] hinder you god's not against you he
[1:03:24] wants your life to be a channel that
[1:03:27] reflects him he wants everything for you
[1:03:30] he wants it more for you than you want
[1:03:31] it for yourself
[1:03:34] i'm not just talking about the holy
[1:03:35] ghost i am talking about the holy ghost
[1:03:37] but i'm talking about a real a
[1:03:40] victorious life each and every day and
[1:03:42] every moment of our life god's desire is
[1:03:46] greater than our desire
[1:03:48] but we've got to be able to identify
[1:03:50] that's true i'm reclining a little bit
[1:03:55] now let's look
[1:03:56] i feel us all reclining
[1:03:59] getting away from the spirit it become
[1:04:01] too natural a thing to us see any time
[1:04:05] listen listen listen these are things as
[1:04:07] far as with stealing this humanity guess
[1:04:10] what things can become common to us very
[1:04:13] quickly
[1:04:14] is that right become very common
[1:04:17] church everything everything around can
[1:04:19] become very common
[1:04:21] that's dangerous
[1:04:23] and we know that we need it is not what
[1:04:25] i'm not going to let it come down and
[1:04:26] i'm not going to let it become god
[1:04:27] no no it takes god staying in his
[1:04:30] fellowship it takes god in his presence
[1:04:33] he's the one that moves in our life that
[1:04:36] keeps the freshness
[1:04:40] about our life
[1:04:43] some of you probably been walking out on
[1:04:44] the grass at different times you know in
[1:04:46] the past couple weeks my goodness i tell
[1:04:48] you we've had some nice dues of the
[1:04:50] morning it's been wet you know what i
[1:04:52] mean it's i mean it's been thick
[1:04:54] any thicker you'd see fish swimming in
[1:04:56] the yard i mean it's been thick
[1:04:58] out there
[1:04:59] cushions you've got outside on your lawn
[1:05:01] footage furniture good luck maybe by
[1:05:03] evening time you'll be able to set on
[1:05:04] them
[1:05:05] it's thick that's happened because we
[1:05:07] know the humidity that was in the air is
[1:05:09] that right listen let me tell you what
[1:05:11] the do represents god never promised
[1:05:14] jacob he said oh i'll this is to be part
[1:05:16] of the covenant with you i'll give you
[1:05:18] all kinds of rain and thunderstorms and
[1:05:20] whatever more god said i'll give you the
[1:05:21] dew
[1:05:22] from heaven
[1:05:24] anybody hear the dew coming
[1:05:26] no it's a silent coming
[1:05:29] are you with me it's a secret coming
[1:05:31] but the dude does something in the
[1:05:34] secret coming that all the rain the rain
[1:05:37] is wonderful the rain can do but the dew
[1:05:39] itself is something so so simple so
[1:05:42] secretive but when you go out at a
[1:05:44] certain time of the day then you can
[1:05:46] walk back on the grass where is the duet
[1:05:48] the do that came it comes from god it
[1:05:51] goes
[1:05:52] back to god
[1:05:54] it's so simple
[1:05:56] of how it happens now notice how brother
[1:05:58] brown would say this he says we must
[1:06:01] worship
[1:06:02] in the spirit where the spirit of god
[1:06:06] not only our message should be the flame
[1:06:09] of the hour
[1:06:10] it should be the flame in our
[1:06:13] hearts
[1:06:15] it's got to be in our hearts or we can't
[1:06:19] rightly present it
[1:06:21] to the people
[1:06:24] the spirit has to pack the message
[1:06:30] itself my my mind
[1:06:33] now i want to just breaking into this
[1:06:36] and dealing from our test and that and
[1:06:38] that point we'll see where we get to
[1:06:39] this morning
[1:06:40] but i want to re take us back into a
[1:06:42] place to recall how moses himself
[1:06:46] hear israel coming out of egypt and
[1:06:49] moses receives from the lord the ten
[1:06:52] commandments he's called by god to enter
[1:06:55] up into the mountain and god as he
[1:06:57] enters into the cloud that's upon the
[1:07:00] mountain he enters into the presence of
[1:07:02] god and god there gives to him the ten
[1:07:06] commandments or as we would know it was
[1:07:09] the very inscription
[1:07:11] of god's own nature but i want you to
[1:07:14] remember it was not inscripted upon soft
[1:07:18] tablets it was on stony tablets
[1:07:22] god was showing that was the condition
[1:07:26] that was present in the lives of every
[1:07:30] person
[1:07:32] our lives were stony tablets there had
[1:07:35] to come something about that would
[1:07:38] change our lives from a stony condition
[1:07:44] because you see if it's just written in
[1:07:46] stone
[1:07:48] you can't move stone around
[1:07:51] but when it's written in
[1:07:53] the heart
[1:07:56] then the heart itself will pulsate that
[1:07:59] to the rest of the body
[1:08:02] so moses as he receives the word of god
[1:08:06] and it was glorious paul writes of it it
[1:08:08] was glorious of what was received i want
[1:08:11] you to remember when moses came forth
[1:08:13] from the presence of god the second time
[1:08:17] when he came forth the second time he
[1:08:19] had a veil on
[1:08:21] god's speaking what he was going to do
[1:08:23] in this day he had a veil on is that
[1:08:25] right
[1:08:26] now god came forth with the veil and his
[1:08:30] face shown with the glory of god
[1:08:36] is that right that was a scripture they
[1:08:38] the all of israel could see his face was
[1:08:41] shining with the glory of god this
[1:08:43] wasn't hollywood production you know
[1:08:45] with lights coming on behind the lights
[1:08:47] flashing ever no it was a glow
[1:08:49] about his life that was the shekinah
[1:08:52] glory of almighty god why because the
[1:08:56] word which is god had been given to
[1:09:00] moses and the shekinah glory accompanied
[1:09:03] moses to bring the word to the people
[1:09:08] are you hearing me now he came down if
[1:09:10] we could say it like this to have his
[1:09:12] picture taken with them
[1:09:15] the shekinah glory accompanied the word
[1:09:19] and moses as he had the word it was
[1:09:22] veiled but after he gave the word out
[1:09:25] moses
[1:09:26] look look when god give him the word and
[1:09:29] he comes back down among the people
[1:09:31] moses then begins to express
[1:09:34] to interpret the writings that god had
[1:09:38] given him
[1:09:40] because he's one
[1:09:42] who is inclined
[1:09:44] with god
[1:09:46] moses was speaking as god
[1:09:50] because he had the revelation
[1:09:54] from god
[1:09:55] for the people
[1:09:57] he was veiled but after the word was
[1:10:00] given out then moses was no longer
[1:10:03] veiled
[1:10:05] the veil was taken off because then that
[1:10:08] word would be placed behind the veil in
[1:10:12] the tabernacle
[1:10:14] it would be placed under badger skins
[1:10:21] now let me just refer to this here just
[1:10:23] a moment
[1:10:25] every one of us
[1:10:27] here we live
[1:10:29] in a three-room house just hold on a
[1:10:31] moment benjamin i want to read these
[1:10:33] scriptures here
[1:10:35] in exodus 25 21
[1:10:38] thou shalt put the mercy seat
[1:10:42] above upon the ark
[1:10:45] and in the ark
[1:10:48] thou shalt put the testimony
[1:10:52] that i shall give thee
[1:10:54] so this was not going to be a testimony
[1:10:57] that moses makes up
[1:11:01] but what god was going to put into the
[1:11:03] ark what he said what goes in the ark is
[1:11:05] the testimony i'm going to give you
[1:11:09] i'm going to give you a testimony and it
[1:11:13] will be the testimony
[1:11:17] and then it goes on in verse 22 and
[1:11:20] there i will meet with thee and i will
[1:11:22] commune with thee from above the mercy
[1:11:25] seat from between the two cherubims
[1:11:27] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[1:11:30] so now when the the the testimony is
[1:11:34] placed in the ark then the ark becomes
[1:11:37] known as the ark of the
[1:11:41] testimony
[1:11:43] these are all the things which i've
[1:11:44] given thee in commandment unto the
[1:11:46] children
[1:11:47] of israel
[1:11:49] now
[1:11:50] let me just let me just work with this
[1:11:52] here just a moment here and i want to
[1:11:53] just deal with this
[1:11:55] can you can you change that benjamin
[1:11:57] please
[1:12:01] okay
[1:12:02] i'm doing i just i wanted to do this
[1:12:06] because
[1:12:08] sometimes these things what i just read
[1:12:10] can seem so vague
[1:12:12] in our minds
[1:12:14] we need something more than just
[1:12:17] we need something greater than simon
[1:12:19] browning to make it plain i can't make
[1:12:21] it plain
[1:12:22] when i interested in the spirit of god
[1:12:24] to come and reveal it
[1:12:26] quicken it make it alive make it clear
[1:12:30] god laid this out
[1:12:32] of this tabernacle this is the vision
[1:12:35] that he gave
[1:12:36] to moses
[1:12:38] of this tabernacle this was a type
[1:12:43] of man
[1:12:45] god's desire
[1:12:47] has always been to dwell
[1:12:50] inside of man
[1:12:54] god's place of rest rest is you know
[1:12:59] you come into your house you don't rest
[1:13:01] in the kitchen
[1:13:05] you rest a little bit in the parlor or
[1:13:06] the living room family room whatever you
[1:13:08] want to call it but you rest in the
[1:13:10] bedroom
[1:13:12] it's a place of rest where you receive
[1:13:14] real rest and refreshment there's nice
[1:13:17] things you know in the living room you
[1:13:19] can sit down in your recliner and my you
[1:13:22] know you can just kind of rest in there
[1:13:23] but there's the real place of rest
[1:13:26] is
[1:13:27] is that part of the bedroom that's where
[1:13:29] you receive refreshment is that right
[1:13:32] when you you know like how many times
[1:13:35] you know you you go by nowadays oh you'd
[1:13:37] only eat six hours of sleep uh give it a
[1:13:39] month oh you need seven and a half give
[1:13:41] it a year oh you need nine hours give it
[1:13:43] another six months oh you only need five
[1:13:45] hours
[1:13:46] it just depends on what flavor of the
[1:13:48] month is going on is that right
[1:13:51] i mean but your body lets you know
[1:13:52] whether you need more rest or not
[1:13:55] is that right
[1:13:56] so the rest itself how this was a type
[1:14:01] of man of how that when you come you
[1:14:04] know when you look here
[1:14:06] uh uh uh of the tabernacle god would
[1:14:08] dwell in and i want to just maybe to
[1:14:11] draw here the attention here just for a
[1:14:13] moment as we look at it
[1:14:16] these are the parts right here
[1:14:17] of the badger skins
[1:14:20] the badger skins well everybody knows
[1:14:22] what a badger is
[1:14:24] anyone like a badger for a pet
[1:14:27] no why
[1:14:28] they're mean
[1:14:30] that was once you
[1:14:33] that was once me
[1:14:36] what happened you're not seeing a live
[1:14:37] badger up there
[1:14:39] but it's the skin that was on that
[1:14:41] badger
[1:14:43] a new creation in the same old temple
[1:14:46] [Applause]
[1:14:49] now
[1:14:51] i want to just
[1:14:52] move here into this place
[1:14:55] this is now just a snapshot of that of
[1:14:58] three courts
[1:14:59] because you and i are made as a
[1:15:02] three-room house
[1:15:04] body
[1:15:06] spirit
[1:15:07] and soul
[1:15:11] and you find it here in the outer court
[1:15:14] let me just let me just refer to it in
[1:15:16] this way this is body out here
[1:15:19] right in here this is spirit
[1:15:23] these are all you remember if you look
[1:15:24] in in the
[1:15:26] uh the previous drawing
[1:15:29] the previous one you have if you have
[1:15:31] the five
[1:15:32] uh posts there
[1:15:34] conscience memory affections reasoning
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:39] this is the spirit realm
[1:15:41] you got body and spirit but you see this
[1:15:44] inner realm right here that's the soul
[1:15:47] this is the place that god dwells
[1:15:53] the other place the spirit and the body
[1:15:56] only reflect what's going on in the soul
[1:16:00] [Applause]
[1:16:01] this is why the new birth is more than a
[1:16:04] work of the body or the spirit the new
[1:16:07] birth is the work and the soul
[1:16:13] that's what being born again is you see
[1:16:15] you can come into a body of believers
[1:16:18] right here and you can have fellowship
[1:16:20] with the body of believers
[1:16:24] your spirit can even be moved and it's
[1:16:27] inclined with wow these are this is good
[1:16:30] i i really enjoy this but it's got to go
[1:16:34] deeper to where it comes into a change
[1:16:38] on the inside and remember the
[1:16:40] scriptures that we read the testimony
[1:16:44] that i give thee
[1:16:46] put into
[1:16:48] the ark
[1:16:50] and the ark right here
[1:16:51] i'm sorry for drawing this on up but
[1:16:54] the ark right here
[1:16:56] that is the type of the human heart
[1:17:02] place
[1:17:03] this room right here of the of of the
[1:17:06] innermost part the smallest room
[1:17:10] but when god is dwelling there it has
[1:17:13] the impact
[1:17:15] an effect on every other part
[1:17:19] of our life
[1:17:22] this is why
[1:17:23] the change has got to go deeper than
[1:17:26] just the body we can conform to things
[1:17:29] but that'll never work
[1:17:31] even in our spirit we can fellowship
[1:17:33] around the good things of god and even
[1:17:36] you know like the word and things but
[1:17:38] it's got to go deeper it must come to a
[1:17:40] place on the inside to where now it's no
[1:17:42] longer just fellowshipping around the
[1:17:44] word but now is the word living itself
[1:17:48] in and through our lives
[1:17:51] that's god's purpose
[1:17:58] oh my
[1:18:00] everybody clear amen
[1:18:03] ben go ahead switch off please
[1:18:08] now in the in this ark
[1:18:11] where this remember the testimony i give
[1:18:14] you
[1:18:15] who gave you your testimony
[1:18:20] but samuel no no this testimony is just
[1:18:23] like it was given to moses it's a
[1:18:25] testimony that god gives you personally
[1:18:29] it's your
[1:18:31] personal testimony
[1:18:33] and god places the personal testimony in
[1:18:37] the ark in our heart
[1:18:42] amen
[1:18:44] see god provided a place for himself
[1:18:46] he's jehovah's ira
[1:18:48] he's jehovah gyra
[1:18:50] he provided the place you could right
[1:18:53] here when you deal with the soul even
[1:18:54] you can preach all seven compound
[1:18:56] redemptive names of jehovah he is
[1:18:58] jehovah rapha we needed healing in our
[1:19:01] soul
[1:19:02] we were sick
[1:19:06] we didn't need our own righteousness we
[1:19:08] needed his righteousness
[1:19:13] but this testimony it would be placed
[1:19:16] in the ark
[1:19:18] that was behind the inner veil which is
[1:19:20] seen there on the picture it is the
[1:19:22] place
[1:19:23] let me just say this this was a place
[1:19:27] where when there was
[1:19:29] a discrepancy
[1:19:31] that arose
[1:19:32] a dispute
[1:19:34] on who was it that god chose to stand in
[1:19:38] the office of the levite and priests
[1:19:41] this was the place
[1:19:43] where god had the rods brought in and
[1:19:46] aaron's rod which was a dried stick
[1:19:51] but it was off of an almond tree
[1:19:56] and it came into this place the most
[1:19:58] holy place and inside of there in a
[1:20:01] 24-hour period of time
[1:20:04] it budded
[1:20:06] it blossomed and it bore almonds
[1:20:09] it went through the whole
[1:20:11] cycle
[1:20:16] it's the same thing with turning the
[1:20:17] water into wine it went through the
[1:20:19] whole cycle
[1:20:22] is that right squirrels coming into
[1:20:23] existence went through the whole cycle
[1:20:27] same thing in your life it went through
[1:20:29] the whole cycle
[1:20:33] and aaron's rod
[1:20:35] remember
[1:20:36] was god declaring this is whom i've
[1:20:39] chosen and it was god himself giving an
[1:20:43] absolute that would dissolve every doubt
[1:20:47] should there ever arise a question come
[1:20:50] back to the sacred sands of my grace
[1:20:54] where i have confirmed my
[1:20:57] self to you
[1:21:01] that's what the testimony does
[1:21:04] it's also the place that when the manna
[1:21:06] fell in the wilderness remember god
[1:21:09] provided what they had needed to eat the
[1:21:11] manner that fail they were to go out and
[1:21:13] gather that up but remember
[1:21:16] they were only together what they would
[1:21:17] eat don't keep none of that manna up
[1:21:20] you keep it up it'll canker
[1:21:22] where did the manna come from it came
[1:21:24] from god
[1:21:26] right
[1:21:27] but you look and say well that come from
[1:21:29] god how can that canker because
[1:21:33] there is an ordained place for the manna
[1:21:36] to come where it will never canker
[1:21:40] this is why god had them to take an omer
[1:21:43] and fill the omer with the original
[1:21:45] manna that fell on the first day let me
[1:21:48] type going back to the day of pentecost
[1:21:50] the same original holy ghost
[1:21:53] that same holy ghost when it comes into
[1:21:56] the soul and brings a change it'll never
[1:22:00] canker but if it's only on the flesh
[1:22:03] it'll canker
[1:22:04] only a matter of time and it's out again
[1:22:07] if it comes into the spirit it may not
[1:22:09] go out there but it'll complain and find
[1:22:11] fault here and this and that and
[1:22:12] whatever more but you see what does it
[1:22:14] it can't curse
[1:22:16] but if the holy ghost ever comes down to
[1:22:19] the inside there is no cankering
[1:22:23] that experience is just as fresh as the
[1:22:26] moment that it was received
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:30] why because it's the testimony
[1:22:34] of god himself
[1:22:36] therefore the ark became the ark of the
[1:22:41] testimony because it held the testimony
[1:22:46] and our life
[1:22:47] becomes the habitation of god because
[1:22:52] the testimony of jesus christ
[1:22:56] comes into our life
[1:23:00] this is where
[1:23:02] as we move from
[1:23:04] the type to the anatype
[1:23:07] and just moving over some scriptures
[1:23:10] god's desire as we were looking at that
[1:23:12] the tabernacle there god's desire
[1:23:15] was to have a place to dwell that was
[1:23:16] only these were only a type
[1:23:19] where god would catch moses up and moses
[1:23:21] would catch the heavenly patterns
[1:23:24] he would catch how could how could how
[1:23:26] could anybody know how to prepare god a
[1:23:29] place to dwell in but god would catch
[1:23:32] moses up and god's mercy his desire to
[1:23:36] dwell among his people was so great that
[1:23:39] he knew it must be that where his
[1:23:41] pattern must now come from the heavenly
[1:23:45] and be spoken upon the earth and it now
[1:23:47] become fruition and so god had one
[1:23:50] reserve he that happened here that could
[1:23:53] be caught up there in that cloud and
[1:23:55] received the pattern from almighty god
[1:23:59] in that pattern to be communicated onto
[1:24:02] this earth
[1:24:03] so then what was in heaven could now be
[1:24:06] reflected upon earth
[1:24:08] see the rest of the nations could look
[1:24:10] at that tabernacle i showed you and say
[1:24:12] what is that
[1:24:13] what a mess
[1:24:15] who would put badger skins up over the
[1:24:18] top of a tabernacle like that where all
[1:24:20] these colors and what are all these
[1:24:22] things and whatever more but it doesn't
[1:24:24] it had no meaning for them
[1:24:26] you see they had their own tabernacles
[1:24:30] they have their own temples
[1:24:33] but in those tabernacles and temples
[1:24:36] which are inspired by demons
[1:24:40] come on now paul brought it right on
[1:24:41] down there's doctrines of devils
[1:24:44] are you with me he called them also in
[1:24:46] the book of revelation synagogue of
[1:24:48] satan
[1:24:51] but what we find is they could look at
[1:24:53] this tabernacle and say what in the
[1:24:55] world is that but it was god's mystery
[1:25:00] what god's desire was he gave the
[1:25:03] pattern to moses
[1:25:04] moses carried that pattern out men that
[1:25:07] fulfilled that pattern let me just tell
[1:25:09] you something why it's important to
[1:25:10] follow the pattern god will not
[1:25:13] recognize anything that's not his word
[1:25:18] are you hearing me i'm talking about the
[1:25:20] new birth god will not recognize
[1:25:23] anything that's not according to his
[1:25:25] word
[1:25:26] but every time that god comes god is
[1:25:30] recognizing this is the original
[1:25:34] pattern
[1:25:36] there's a lot of saying a lot of things
[1:25:37] to be spoke there it shows that in every
[1:25:40] facet of our life if you want god to be
[1:25:42] present you want god then follow the
[1:25:45] pattern of god
[1:25:49] hallelujah so here here we find this
[1:25:52] this rest the rest of man and notice of
[1:25:56] how that solomon himself solomon would
[1:25:58] follow the same pattern
[1:26:00] is that right he followed the same
[1:26:01] pattern how god came on the scene the
[1:26:04] pillar of fire comes down descends and
[1:26:06] it fills the tabernacle it goes clear
[1:26:08] back there where did the pillar fire
[1:26:09] stop in solomon's temple
[1:26:12] not not in the holy place not not in the
[1:26:13] inner outer court not in the holy place
[1:26:15] it went to the innermost part
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:19] that's where the holy ghost is meant to
[1:26:22] go
[1:26:24] you see now when we move from the type
[1:26:28] to the anatype
[1:26:30] oh my my my my mind
[1:26:33] the word itself now
[1:26:36] the word is made flesh and dwelt among
[1:26:39] us we're coming to to jesus christ
[1:26:42] the bible would record
[1:26:44] we beheld him the only begotten of the
[1:26:46] father
[1:26:48] he declared or as john would write it he
[1:26:51] revealed
[1:26:52] he revealed god
[1:26:54] in so much in such completeness till it
[1:26:58] was god in the flesh
[1:27:01] is that right
[1:27:02] notice his ministry was not a writing
[1:27:05] ministry
[1:27:06] jesus never came down to write
[1:27:09] are you with me he did not come down and
[1:27:11] now he's going to write a bunch of
[1:27:13] commandments and it's not a writing
[1:27:14] ministry this is the ministry of
[1:27:17] revealing what has been written amen
[1:27:21] that's why he came in his fullness is to
[1:27:24] reveal the writing
[1:27:26] amen
[1:27:28] revealing in what not in seminars not in
[1:27:30] teaching but reveal it by expressing by
[1:27:34] god's very mind concerning his word was
[1:27:38] now expressed through
[1:27:40] the body of jesus christ
[1:27:43] psalms 40 verse 6 sacrifice and offering
[1:27:47] thou didst not desire
[1:27:50] mine ears hast thou opened or loosed
[1:27:53] burnt offering and sin offering hast
[1:27:55] thou not required
[1:27:57] you see god's desire was for fellowship
[1:28:00] that would be complete
[1:28:03] not just things that's covered over
[1:28:05] but to where there's an absolute
[1:28:07] transformation
[1:28:09] on the inside
[1:28:12] then said i lo
[1:28:15] i come
[1:28:16] in the volume of the book
[1:28:18] it is written
[1:28:20] of me where it's root this is where i
[1:28:22] come see jesus
[1:28:24] he came
[1:28:25] when it was time for that part of the
[1:28:28] drama
[1:28:29] to be fulfilled
[1:28:31] probably everybody in here has seen a
[1:28:32] drama right
[1:28:34] you've seen it some of you
[1:28:36] are with me this morning
[1:28:37] everybody's seen a drama at some point
[1:28:39] in time
[1:28:40] you do not come out on stage until it's
[1:28:43] time for your part in the drama
[1:28:46] the script was written before the
[1:28:49] foundation of the world
[1:28:52] all of the villains that was in there
[1:28:54] and all those things all of those parts
[1:28:56] were already wrote there
[1:28:59] and the holy spirit is on the scene to
[1:29:03] give the inspiration that those that are
[1:29:05] standing back there they begin to
[1:29:07] receive inspiration that now they're on
[1:29:10] the scene and it's time for this part to
[1:29:13] be acted out and you know what it's not
[1:29:16] the people doing the acting it's god
[1:29:19] acting through
[1:29:21] man
[1:29:26] same god all the time just changing his
[1:29:28] mask
[1:29:30] i look out here i see a masked
[1:29:32] god mass
[1:29:36] woo
[1:29:38] you having a good time
[1:29:40] i am
[1:29:42] then said i know i come in the volume of
[1:29:44] the book it is written of me i delight
[1:29:46] to do thy will oh my god yay thy law is
[1:29:50] within my heart this was different
[1:29:53] yes there had been delight in the
[1:29:55] law but now where is this the light
[1:29:57] coming from this delight is not just
[1:29:59] coming from oh i enjoy the word i enjoy
[1:30:02] it but now it's an inward delight
[1:30:05] because look thy law
[1:30:08] is within
[1:30:09] my heart
[1:30:11] this was a prophecy concerning the lord
[1:30:14] jesus
[1:30:16] what was it the testimony
[1:30:19] i have preached now notice what this
[1:30:20] testimony did
[1:30:22] the testimony within the innermost part
[1:30:25] i have preached righteousness
[1:30:28] in the great congregation
[1:30:32] how many knows you don't have to be a
[1:30:33] preacher to preach
[1:30:35] your life preaches sermons
[1:30:37] your life preaches sermons
[1:30:40] is that right
[1:30:41] ah i have not refrained my lips oh lord
[1:30:45] thou know see what see what the coming
[1:30:47] into
[1:30:48] expression does it does not hold back
[1:30:51] it's a releasing
[1:30:55] i have not hid
[1:30:57] thy righteousness within my heart i have
[1:31:00] declared thy faithfulness and thy
[1:31:03] salvation i have not concealed thy
[1:31:07] loving kindness and thy truth from the
[1:31:09] great congregation what is it the lord
[1:31:12] jesus is declaring this is prophetic
[1:31:14] that the life where the testimony is
[1:31:17] placed is no longer a life that's sealed
[1:31:20] up and silenced but it is a life that
[1:31:23] the seals have been taken off of it it's
[1:31:26] a life where the voice has been released
[1:31:28] through and in the lie so it's not us
[1:31:32] that speaker but the blood
[1:31:34] speaketh
[1:31:35] better things
[1:31:38] you see the seals the taking of the book
[1:31:40] that's a mere reflection of what god has
[1:31:43] done in your life to take the seals off
[1:31:46] of your life
[1:31:47] to remove the hindrances and the
[1:31:49] thoughts and the thinking and creeds and
[1:31:52] dogmas but now the breaking the seals
[1:31:54] back is to reveal as a son and daughter
[1:31:57] of god baptized in the holy ghost under
[1:32:00] the blood now stands as a spokesman for
[1:32:03] the living god
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:07] hallelujah
[1:32:09] oh my jesus let me just say it here as
[1:32:12] the prophet could say it jesus is our
[1:32:14] moses of today
[1:32:17] god was veiled in christ manifesting
[1:32:20] himself his word through that body in
[1:32:22] john 14 9.
[1:32:24] look at he said to philip remember they
[1:32:26] asked him show us the father he said
[1:32:28] have i been so long with you yet thou
[1:32:30] hast not known me philip he that hath
[1:32:32] seen me
[1:32:34] had seen the father
[1:32:37] and how sayest thou then show us the
[1:32:40] father
[1:32:41] believeth thou not that i am in the
[1:32:43] father and the father in me
[1:32:46] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[1:32:49] not of myself but the father that
[1:32:51] dwelleth in me
[1:32:53] he
[1:32:54] doeth
[1:32:56] the works
[1:32:59] it's not me making myself no there's
[1:33:02] something behind me
[1:33:05] what is it the testimony
[1:33:10] believe me that i am in the father and
[1:33:12] the father in me or else believe me
[1:33:14] for the very work's sake you see that's
[1:33:17] the same testimony in our lives
[1:33:22] that a person says ah
[1:33:24] i can't believe i can't you
[1:33:27] you the bride of jesus christ
[1:33:30] the scripture applies
[1:33:32] because
[1:33:34] we have a greater witness
[1:33:37] well i can show you here i can take you
[1:33:39] here and i can take you there
[1:33:41] somebody in the spirit realm can do that
[1:33:45] though i understand all
[1:33:47] mistress
[1:33:49] and have not the love of god
[1:33:52] god can speak in tongues and everything
[1:33:55] else without the love of god the
[1:33:57] testimony of jesus christ is nothing but
[1:34:00] a rattling noise
[1:34:03] are you hearing me faith to move
[1:34:05] mountains nothing but a rattling noise
[1:34:07] if it doesn't have the testimony on the
[1:34:11] inside
[1:34:12] [Applause]
[1:34:14] is that right
[1:34:17] hey listen friends this is why this
[1:34:19] world and everyone else don't take it
[1:34:21] personal when you talk about being a
[1:34:23] christian and they look at you and they
[1:34:24] and they first of all look and think
[1:34:27] let me see they've seen so much
[1:34:28] hypocrisy
[1:34:30] listen they've seen gifts this there's
[1:34:32] been many people have seen gifts work
[1:34:34] they've seen people go and pray for
[1:34:36] people and they come up out of hospitals
[1:34:39] and it ends up being nothing but a
[1:34:41] hypocrite
[1:34:42] i'm gonna preach it straight
[1:34:44] you know why that is because they never
[1:34:47] got born again
[1:34:51] come on now
[1:34:52] let's get right down to the rubber of
[1:34:54] the boat we're talking about the
[1:34:55] testimony of jesus christ then whether
[1:34:58] or not you ever pray for anybody whether
[1:35:01] you ever speak with tongues whether you
[1:35:03] ever move a mountain it's the testimony
[1:35:06] of jesus christ in your life that is
[1:35:08] identified in the word and your life is
[1:35:11] identified as a christian not because of
[1:35:14] who you associate with or what church
[1:35:17] you come to but you're identified by the
[1:35:20] presence of jesus christ
[1:35:23] in your life
[1:35:26] whoa if you can't believe me
[1:35:28] believe the works
[1:35:33] right
[1:35:34] believe the works
[1:35:36] they they testify me walking right in
[1:35:38] the word
[1:35:40] and jesus said it like this
[1:35:42] in john 14 12
[1:35:44] he that believeth on me
[1:35:46] the works that i do
[1:35:48] shall he do also
[1:35:50] greater works means more more
[1:35:53] right you take one grain of wheat put it
[1:35:55] in the ground what comes up
[1:35:57] multiple grains
[1:35:59] how many ever planted corn before
[1:36:01] remember my daddy used to get you know
[1:36:02] he'd get the corn from the seed catalogs
[1:36:05] he'd take one little corn dad would
[1:36:07] separate him all have him on the kitchen
[1:36:08] table he's got his sweet corn here he's
[1:36:11] super white right here brother oh he has
[1:36:13] the beans over here they all came in
[1:36:15] brown paper bags
[1:36:17] from the seed catalog company
[1:36:19] but he knew if i plant one of them seeds
[1:36:22] one of them little seeds of corn
[1:36:24] what's going to come out as a whole ear
[1:36:28] you see god was bottled up in one man
[1:36:32] god became flesh the testimony
[1:36:35] of god was placed in one earthen vessel
[1:36:41] but now that the life has been offered
[1:36:44] up and the life that was within there
[1:36:46] the blood paid the ransom and now the
[1:36:49] holy spirit comes back to do what raise
[1:36:52] up a mini-membered body not one kernel
[1:36:56] but a whole cob
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:05] if i didn't have to preach i'd run man i
[1:37:07] i i mean i just feel like turning loose
[1:37:11] oh that ain't just here that's at home
[1:37:13] too
[1:37:15] glory be to god
[1:37:17] oh my you see here's what jesus was
[1:37:20] saying let me just put it in here in my
[1:37:22] paraphrasing my words i will send back
[1:37:24] the holy ghost the living word of god
[1:37:27] and i will continue to do the same works
[1:37:29] through your mortal body being with you
[1:37:31] and in you until the end of the age you
[1:37:34] will be identified by my presence
[1:37:37] abiding in your life i will declare
[1:37:39] myself alive by my life being lived
[1:37:42] through your life it will be the
[1:37:44] testimony of jesus christ that will
[1:37:46] reflect through you making your
[1:37:49] testimony to bear witness of the scene
[1:37:55] i want you to consider this this is
[1:37:57] pretty simple
[1:37:59] everybody remember john dillinger
[1:38:02] i mean he's a he's a lightweight
[1:38:03] compared to nowadays
[1:38:07] hate to say it like that but you know
[1:38:08] what i'm saying i mean you know but if i
[1:38:11] said simple if i said i had the spirit
[1:38:14] of john dillinger in me what would you
[1:38:16] expect me to do
[1:38:18] not go around and serve tea and biscuits
[1:38:22] you would expect me to be packing some
[1:38:24] guns
[1:38:26] right gangster
[1:38:28] you'd expect me to be robbing some banks
[1:38:29] matter of fact you'd be saying but watch
[1:38:31] your eyes around that boy
[1:38:33] because that guy man i'll tell you what
[1:38:34] he won't just rob your blind he'll come
[1:38:36] right to your face
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:39] the owner man i'm tell you what you
[1:38:41] think now it's it's funny if they if
[1:38:42] they you know and what they have you
[1:38:44] walk into the bank with now brother let
[1:38:46] me tell you something right now if
[1:38:47] anybody giant dillinger's coming in oh
[1:38:50] lock the vault everybody lock it look
[1:38:53] why
[1:38:54] because the spirit of john dillinger is
[1:38:58] present in my life so what are they
[1:39:00] doing they're expecting the works of
[1:39:02] john dillinger to be done
[1:39:04] are you with me
[1:39:08] come on now y'all you all have talked a
[1:39:10] little bit and i don't care what side of
[1:39:11] the railroad tracks you come from
[1:39:13] everybody knows a statement apples don't
[1:39:15] fall far from the tree
[1:39:19] is that right
[1:39:21] yes sir buddy now notice what if i said
[1:39:24] i was beethoven or mozart
[1:39:27] what would you expect
[1:39:30] you'd expect me to really enjoy
[1:39:32] classical music and write it
[1:39:34] and compose it if i had that spirit in
[1:39:36] me
[1:39:38] let's bring it down
[1:39:39] what if i said that i'm a christian
[1:39:42] amen and i've got the spirit of jesus
[1:39:44] christ living within me what would you
[1:39:47] expect
[1:39:48] the same things that he did
[1:39:50] that i would do
[1:39:52] not me to do with it come on amen
[1:39:56] it wasn't the spirit oh me trying to act
[1:39:58] like john dillinger no the spirit was
[1:40:00] within me and now my body just reflects
[1:40:02] what's inside
[1:40:08] the ark itself
[1:40:09] it spoke of an
[1:40:11] inward work that would
[1:40:13] emanate throughout all
[1:40:16] of that life
[1:40:21] let me just try to just wind this down
[1:40:24] here
[1:40:25] the scripture says in hebrews 10 14.
[1:40:29] everybody okay
[1:40:32] now i haven't parachuted yet i'm on the
[1:40:35] i click click i'm on the line
[1:40:39] you heard the click right brother joy
[1:40:40] click click on the link
[1:40:42] for by one offering he hath
[1:40:45] perfected forever them
[1:40:47] that are sanctified
[1:40:49] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[1:40:52] to us for after that he has said before
[1:40:55] this is the covenant that i will make
[1:40:58] with them after those days saith the
[1:41:00] lord
[1:41:01] i will
[1:41:02] put my laws into their hearts
[1:41:06] and in their minds will i write them
[1:41:10] notice
[1:41:11] i will put them there
[1:41:13] i will write them there
[1:41:16] what is this the testimony that i give
[1:41:19] thee yes
[1:41:21] and their sins and iniquities will i
[1:41:24] remember
[1:41:25] no more
[1:41:30] you know you and you you and i can walk
[1:41:32] around and say
[1:41:33] uh you know we could remember certain
[1:41:35] things that were done but even the
[1:41:38] things that were done in the body it
[1:41:40] haunts us in the fence in the sense of
[1:41:42] us oh god we no our sins are forgiven
[1:41:46] the debt is settled but it's still that
[1:41:48] part that oh my that this was done but
[1:41:50] remember
[1:41:52] when god has moved to the innermost
[1:41:54] place and the testimony is there it's
[1:41:58] not the same old person
[1:42:00] there is a new
[1:42:02] creation
[1:42:04] let me just let's just try to give it a
[1:42:06] simple example
[1:42:08] brother drake there's no doubt where you
[1:42:10] where you and sister rebecca moved
[1:42:12] somebody else lived in that house before
[1:42:14] right
[1:42:15] okay
[1:42:16] so whoever lived there when you moved in
[1:42:17] the neighborhood probably this happened
[1:42:19] to some of you
[1:42:20] you can you can move into a house and it
[1:42:22] wasn't your house but you move into it
[1:42:25] but there was a reputation of the people
[1:42:27] who lived there before you lived there
[1:42:30] maybe they were the kind of people that
[1:42:32] put their recycle bin out on windy days
[1:42:35] and the wind just blew the recycle all
[1:42:38] over the place
[1:42:40] is that right
[1:42:41] and you get people that kind of just
[1:42:42] dropping hints
[1:42:45] what it is they're reminiscing
[1:42:47] about somebody who used to live there
[1:42:51] and that's what that person would do
[1:42:54] but you're not that person
[1:42:58] same old house
[1:42:59] but there's a new person on the inside
[1:43:03] there's a new person that says windy day
[1:43:05] i'll get up early and put the trash out
[1:43:08] i know that one very deep and very
[1:43:10] spiritual but it might help somebody
[1:43:12] might help you with your neighbors a
[1:43:13] little bit there you understand what i'm
[1:43:15] saying what makes the difference people
[1:43:17] can talk about oh my the neighbor who
[1:43:19] used to live there they can talk about
[1:43:21] your life there's people that remember
[1:43:24] things you used to do you remember but
[1:43:26] what you know on the inside that same
[1:43:28] person don't live here no more
[1:43:33] i don't have the same appetite and the
[1:43:36] same desire that i used to have my
[1:43:39] desire is to please jesus christ
[1:43:43] is to live for him
[1:43:46] the guy that used to set his recycle bin
[1:43:48] out like that the guy that used to run
[1:43:50] around the guy that used to drink the
[1:43:52] guy that used to do all that that guy
[1:43:55] don't live here no more
[1:43:57] there's a new man on the inside
[1:44:01] and a church didn't make you a new man
[1:44:04] it's god himself that makes you a new
[1:44:08] man and a new woman
[1:44:10] i will write
[1:44:13] my laws
[1:44:15] upon your heart
[1:44:17] i
[1:44:18] will put my laws into your mind
[1:44:25] and when that takes place
[1:44:27] your sins and iniquities
[1:44:29] i remember no more
[1:44:32] devil wants to accuse you god said who
[1:44:34] are you talking about
[1:44:35] well you know son no who are you talking
[1:44:37] about
[1:44:38] amen
[1:44:39] what do you mean who am i talking about
[1:44:41] you know as good as well samuel this or
[1:44:43] bill this or joey this or brian this you
[1:44:46] know goody well carlos this or you know
[1:44:48] greg this or richie that you know good
[1:44:50] as well
[1:44:52] oh
[1:44:53] i see your problem
[1:44:56] that's not the same guy on the inside
[1:45:05] you can do what you want to in front of
[1:45:07] him
[1:45:08] he's got my seal on him
[1:45:15] go ahead buy him a whole pallet full of
[1:45:17] sick cigarettes you won't touch him
[1:45:21] come on somebody
[1:45:23] do whatever you want to ain't going to
[1:45:24] bother him
[1:45:26] you know why there's a new man on the
[1:45:28] inside it's united with jesus christ
[1:45:35] let me just
[1:45:36] i want to really just drop this down
[1:45:39] the testimony
[1:45:41] of jesus christ
[1:45:45] works within our life
[1:45:47] to bring the reflection
[1:45:50] of his presence
[1:45:52] of his life
[1:45:55] you and i both can feel we can all
[1:45:57] fellowship on this point there's a
[1:45:59] there's people that sometimes you work
[1:46:00] with and you go into a job
[1:46:02] go into a home
[1:46:04] you don't know what you're going to find
[1:46:05] you don't know if you're going to find
[1:46:06] somebody that every other word out of
[1:46:07] their mouth is
[1:46:09] swear word
[1:46:10] or they're going to talk about how much
[1:46:11] they drank the night before or or what
[1:46:13] they did you know running around
[1:46:14] fornicating adultery and everything you
[1:46:16] don't know what they're going to talk
[1:46:17] about
[1:46:19] but you know sometimes
[1:46:20] tell you what
[1:46:22] it's refreshing when you hear somebody's
[1:46:23] got a clean mouth
[1:46:27] and they and they themselves
[1:46:29] they don't profess nothing
[1:46:31] right then again maybe they're they're
[1:46:33] professing
[1:46:34] some of what they of what they know
[1:46:38] and they can only reflect
[1:46:41] what has been made known to them
[1:46:45] you see the testimony
[1:46:48] of jesus christ
[1:46:50] it will produce
[1:46:52] a good
[1:46:53] clean
[1:46:54] moral
[1:46:55] life
[1:46:57] but just a good clean moral life
[1:47:01] is not the testimony of jesus christ
[1:47:03] are you hearing me
[1:47:05] it's a life the lord jesus we all agree
[1:47:08] he lived a good clean moral life the
[1:47:11] bible said he was tempted
[1:47:13] without sin
[1:47:14] but what made him god
[1:47:17] is because
[1:47:19] god
[1:47:20] dwelled inside of him
[1:47:23] when he walked about
[1:47:25] the confidence blind bartimaeus had the
[1:47:27] woman at the well on and on and on we
[1:47:28] could go their confidence was god
[1:47:32] was in christ
[1:47:34] so the testimony of jesus christ
[1:47:37] is when our life
[1:47:39] has been transformed from the inside out
[1:47:42] and we're no longer talking about the
[1:47:43] message amen we've become the message
[1:47:47] amen
[1:47:48] we are a reflection
[1:47:50] of the message
[1:47:52] of this hour
[1:47:55] our lives declare that our hearts have
[1:47:57] been turned
[1:48:00] you love him this morning
[1:48:03] where remission of these is
[1:48:06] there is no more offering
[1:48:08] for sin
[1:48:10] where remission of these you see it
[1:48:12] speaks of the the very depths within our
[1:48:14] life let's just close
[1:48:16] this is why
[1:48:18] that the testimony of jesus christ
[1:48:23] ben can you go back to that slide just a
[1:48:25] minute please buddy
[1:48:27] this is why
[1:48:29] the testimony of jesus christ
[1:48:33] i am closing
[1:48:36] this is why the testimony of jesus
[1:48:38] christ it's got to be more than just
[1:48:40] right out here
[1:48:43] it's got to be more than just on our
[1:48:44] spirit
[1:48:46] because in our spirit it we start
[1:48:48] thinking differently
[1:48:50] i shouldn't do this shouldn't do that
[1:48:52] shouldn't do this
[1:48:55] and that's all part of the journey are
[1:48:57] you with me
[1:48:58] that's all part of
[1:49:00] the testimony
[1:49:03] but the objective is that the testimony
[1:49:07] finds its place
[1:49:10] in our life
[1:49:12] that's where it comes down to the soul
[1:49:16] where it comes down to the change
[1:49:19] on the inside
[1:49:20] this is the place in here
[1:49:23] where the rod
[1:49:25] dissolves doubt
[1:49:29] this is the place in here
[1:49:32] where the manna
[1:49:33] never cankers
[1:49:35] it's the place of life
[1:49:38] it's the place that now his presence
[1:49:41] his presence now it emanates throughout
[1:49:44] all of the court
[1:49:46] so where is our influence from then
[1:49:49] our influence is to be lived from right
[1:49:51] here well i've marked this all up but
[1:49:54] this is where we're to live our life
[1:49:55] from
[1:49:56] not from what we're reading out there
[1:49:59] not from things well so and so treated
[1:50:01] me this they did no live
[1:50:03] from inside yes amen let the inside
[1:50:07] flow
[1:50:08] to the outside
[1:50:13] the testimony
[1:50:15] of jesus christ
[1:50:17] it is the spirit
[1:50:18] of prophecy
[1:50:20] what is prophecy divine inspiration
[1:50:23] preaching it's uttering what do our
[1:50:25] lives do whether you're a preacher
[1:50:27] such as the gift god's place in my life
[1:50:29] or
[1:50:30] you're called to be a witness and your
[1:50:32] life preaches a sermon

[1:54:52] hallelujah as our heads are bound here
[1:54:54] in his presence
[1:54:56] amen i wonder as we're in his presence
[1:54:59] here this morning he's spoken so
[1:55:01] personally to our hearts
[1:55:03] i wonder if there would be one that
[1:55:04] would say lord
[1:55:05] i want that testimony
[1:55:07] in the innermost part of my being
[1:55:10] i want that to dwell lord i want my life
[1:55:13] it to be a real reflection of you
[1:55:16] maybe there's things the testimony of
[1:55:18] jesus christ is there but maybe there's
[1:55:20] things you've allowed to accumulate in
[1:55:21] your spirit
[1:55:23] maybe in your body
[1:55:24] but you say lord i i want a real
[1:55:27] renewing
[1:55:28] of the holy spirit lord a cleaning out
[1:55:31] maybe you've never surrendered your life
[1:55:32] to god
[1:55:34] but right now this morning is that where
[1:55:35] you recognize
[1:55:37] there's been a a man surrendered to god
[1:55:39] and god has come down to let you know
[1:55:41] this is not the work of a church
[1:55:44] it's the work of almighty god
[1:55:47] and that he himself
[1:55:49] will take your life
[1:55:51] and transform it as a trophy of his
[1:55:53] grace would there be one that would say
[1:55:54] god
[1:55:55] that's me this morning lord
[1:55:57] i want to give my life completely to you
[1:56:00] lord
[1:56:01] amen god bless your hands
[1:56:03] amen
[1:56:05] hallelujah let's just as we join
[1:56:07] together in prayer
[1:56:08] heavenly father
[1:56:11] lord we realize as we stand here
[1:56:15] that this testimony
[1:56:18] is not a testimony that any church
[1:56:20] or any man
[1:56:22] can give to us
[1:56:24] but lord
[1:56:25] it's ministered to us by the holy spirit
[1:56:29] but it's a work between you
[1:56:32] and your child
[1:56:34] lord to where that we stand
[1:56:37] as new creatures
[1:56:39] in christ jesus
[1:56:41] now lord i pray behind those hands you
[1:56:43] know the real request
[1:56:46] lord no doubt through this building
[1:56:49] there's many lives that
[1:56:51] they lord god have received
[1:56:54] that testimony
[1:56:56] of jesus christ in the innermost part of
[1:56:59] their being there there's been a change
[1:57:01] that's come about in their life
[1:57:04] more than just
[1:57:06] good morals which we thank you for that
[1:57:09] but it's a love affair between you
[1:57:12] and your people
[1:57:15] lord
[1:57:17] but maybe there's been a reclining of
[1:57:19] the spirit
[1:57:21] maybe there's things that's entered into
[1:57:22] that spirit got in the way
[1:57:26] but lord right now they would just like
[1:57:28] to ask for a renewing
[1:57:31] of the holy spirit
[1:57:34] would you just move down in a special
[1:57:36] way for their needs just as much as lord
[1:57:39] you would move down for that heart that
[1:57:41] would say lord
[1:57:43] i want that testimony
[1:57:46] in the very depths of my soul
[1:57:49] not just on my body where i'm trying to
[1:57:52] conform
[1:57:54] not just on my spirit where i know
[1:57:56] what's right
[1:57:59] and the word begins to yeah
[1:58:02] the word we're agreeing with the word
[1:58:04] but where it comes to the soul
[1:58:07] and now
[1:58:08] from the very inside outside to the
[1:58:11] outside it reflects
[1:58:13] the testimony of jesus christ
[1:58:16] just the simplicity lord that you gave
[1:58:18] to us in the example that the prophet
[1:58:20] would give us time and time again about
[1:58:22] john dillinger beethoven mozart on and
[1:58:24] on we could go
[1:58:27] and if the spirit of one of them would
[1:58:29] live inside of us
[1:58:31] we would do the works that they did
[1:58:34] but the spirit of jesus christ living
[1:58:38] inside of a child of god
[1:58:41] then we can lord say that
[1:58:43] this day
[1:58:44] this scripture is fulfilled that he
[1:58:48] would do the works he that believeth
[1:58:51] on me the works that i do shall he do
[1:58:54] also this day
[1:58:56] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:58:59] granted lord we pray
[1:59:01] may you continue to work in each of our
[1:59:03] lives lord
[1:59:05] may we lord as the dew falling upon the
[1:59:08] grass
[1:59:09] lord where it comes down
[1:59:11] in such secret such silence
[1:59:15] it descends o god
[1:59:17] upon lord the grass upon the plants upon
[1:59:20] the leaves
[1:59:22] and then it arises lord that that light
[1:59:25] begins to come upon that dew drop and
[1:59:26] that dew drop begins to move around
[1:59:30] until eventually the strength
[1:59:32] of the sun
[1:59:34] draws it back to where it come from
[1:59:38] granite lord
[1:59:40] may we live under the refreshment
[1:59:43] of the dew from heaven lord
[1:59:45] that our lives would be sweet
[1:59:48] peaceful
[1:59:50] gentle
[1:59:51] loving
[1:59:52] full of joy
[1:59:54] from the dew of heaven
[1:59:57] granite lord
[1:59:58] for that is your word
[2:00:01] to the firstborn
[2:00:03] of the covenant
