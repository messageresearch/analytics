life tonight I just ask you maybe just about your heads with me as we look to him our gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful tonight for your many blessings in our life though undeserved in our lives you've made a way of Escape for us you've offered us that grace and mercy and peace to us tonight we are thankful as we've gathered together once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you've promised to be in our midst and to speak to us and to build up this church lord it's not our church tonight it's your church your body and you've made a promise you said that you would have a a church without spot or blemish that you would bring us into the fullness of the stature of the the Lord Jesus Christ and so we look tonight with great expectation that you would come in and speak Words of Life Lord help me as a man to move out of the way tonight that you could come and have preeminence not just in this place but in each heart father bless this time we pray and we committed into your hands as a loving and a faithful Creator and we give you all the glory and honor now for we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you we are a privileged people tonight let's just take this little bit of time that we have on Earth and and commit it back to him every every breath that we draw is by his mercy and Grace so we just want to greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we're happy to be here good to see each one our brother Holden where's he there he is hey man good to see you tonight I know everybody I believe uh brother Brian said something already but I just want to Echo that we're so happy to see him and each one of you that's here tonight and thankful for what the Lord is doing in each of your lives if you have your Bibles this evening we're going to look into the book of Nehemiah the fifth chapter tonight and I'll try to uh uh well if I say I'm not gonna take your time then I will so we'll just see what happens no I I believe the Lord has something for us tonight though and uh we just I'm just happy to be with you tonight really just to feel good to be in this place I hope you feel the same way amen well if you don't hopefully you do by the time we get done so uh but God is good to us amen Nehemiah the fifth chapter of course I've been speaking out of the book of Nehemiah the last few times I'd like to look here in verse 5 I'm sorry chapter 5 verse 14 this evening and we'll read it on the 19th verse of course remember your pastor in prayer as well as he's traveling he he messaged me earlier that he's preaching tonight so uh of course they have a time difference so hopefully I'll be done by the time he starts but uh anyway Nehemiah the uh fifth chapter no I'm in the fourth chapter just saying here the fifth chapter verse 14. Nehemiah says this moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah from the 20th year even into the two and thirtieth year of Archer Xerxes the king that is 12 years I and my brother have not eaten the bread of the governor but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bred and wine beside 40 SEC shekels of silver yeah even their servants bear rule over the people but so did not I because of the fear of God now just keep that in your mind because of the fear of God so you say what's this God do with anything well I'm getting somewhere so verse 16 he says yea also I continued in the work of this wall neither brought bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work moreover there were at my table and 150 of the Jews and rulers besides beside those that came unto us from among the Heathen that are about us now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six Choice sheep all so fouls were prepared for me once in 10 days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor because the bondage was Heavy upon this people and then verse 19 says think upon me my God for good according to all that I have done for this people may the Lord bless the reading his word you may be seated this evening for my thoughts it kind of you're like well that's really nice that he did that but what's what's where's this going tonight my thought tonight is of course we're speaking about the Lord as tonight the benefactor of a greater world Amen and so uh I was uh I was motivated here recently to look up the uh the net worth of our elected officials in Washington D.C and it's really enlightening as you should check it out sometime it's enlightening when you realize that the mean or average income of the or I'm sorry the the net worth rather of a of a congress member the average is a million dollars they're each that's by average they're a millionaires some are multi-millionaires and then to be fair some of them have made money from other Ventures or they married into money but many of these people they've made tens of millions of dollars while they're in office and of course they don't get paid tens of millions of dollars a year but somewhere they made tens of millions of dollars and so I was reminded of the words of Harry Truman He says show me a man that gets Rich by being a politician I'll show you a crook so we realize there's a lot that goes on in the realm of politics and it's not just politics in America but especially in America we realize it's true and so a lot of people they enter a public office or or let me just bring it home a little bit sometimes they enter a Ministry or whatever they enter it not for the benefit of other people but for their own benefit amen they enter a public office they're a public servant and yet they're the ones that are making out like a bandit but this was not so with the character of Nehemiah and why I read this scripture tonight we read this and we see that Nehemiah he was he was he was entitled to certain things based on his position but for for for because of the need and because of the things in his life he turns it down we know of course the second chapter Nehemiah he's spoken to the king he's got a letter from the King to go get timber for these building projects and the King gives it the Bible says because of the good hand of God that was upon Nehemiah and it's remarkable to me he's anybody has anybody here ever read uh the testimony of George Mueller anybody who George Mueller is okay maybe one or two but you really well I won't go there then you don't have to eat you know he was he was uh he was he was um famous for having an orphanage and he I don't remember the thousands of different orphans he raised but he was a man of faith and he took in these orphans and there'd be times he'd be praying for something that didn't have enough food to feed the people the the children that they had there for the day and he prayed the Lord would provide him with something and you know this farm would be going down the road and said hey I broke a wag uh an axle on my wagon and you know here's here's 50 pounds of this and uh 20 pounds of this and stuff and and God was just supernaturally provide for him and we see it through the Bible as well and through different testimonies of of different ones like Nehemiah that you know God has a way of making Provisions for people amen and even in this case we look at King archers Xerxes God can take a heathen a man that's not even a believer not even in Covenant with God and he'll make that person bless you with their substance because at the end of the day no matter what you're doing in this life it's hard to do it without money and then if you drove here tonight you had to pay gas to get here it pays it takes money to put these lights on it takes money to do just about anything unfortunately amen and the reason I'm saying this is that no matter what you're doing we we probably we all get bills we all know what I'm talking about tonight amen but when God wants to accomplish something in your life he has a way of moving provision around to the right place and then like he did with Nehemiah he he put He took this Heathen Kingdom this Heathen King but he used to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and use it the Bless the people of God Amen so we understand God is able to provide like that but what I really want to look at tonight with our scripture is not just the idea of provision but there's a certain kind of provision that can only come through somebody making a sacrifice to give it to you amen we see in the book of Nehemiah the seventh chapter you don't have to turn there but but uh the Bible talks about how the tishatha says he gave The Treasure of a thousand drams of gold and 50 basins and 530 priests garments that Nehemiah of course is the tear shatha he's the governor he's giving of his own substance in this book and we see it time and time again and the reason I'm bringing this up tonight is Nehemiah is not required to offer his portion to the people but of his own free will because that the bondage because it was heavy on the people because they were in a great need he forfeits what he's entitled to in order to get help for the cause that lies before him why well I mentioned a few moments ago because he fears God because he cares about the people because he believes in the work that is taking place and so in order to make this provision for this work he's being caught on to make sacrifices in his life amen he's giving up what he's entitled to with no expectation of ever seeing it again in this life amen but if he was hoping it would be a help to the people his Hope was that God would remember the sacrifice that he was making so this wasn't something that made his life more comfortable amen it wasn't something to make his life were convenient he didn't enter politics just to make money or to benefit from it personally but he had to build a better future for his people he wanted to see the god of his father's glorified amen so when we talk about making a sacrifice tonight we're not just talking about making an investment because when you make an investment you're looking to get a return on what you invested but when we talk about a sacrifice sure you're laying down or giving up something with no expectation that you'll see the same thing or even possibly a reward in this life at all amen but he's giving it up for a cause and then as a minister and I'm just using myself as an example you know sometimes I have to sacrifice my time or things that I had planned for the ministry amen I've had to honor commitments I made can I just be real transparent for a moment tonight amen sometimes you you you get asked to go somewhere and you make a commitment you pray about it and then you get asked to go somewhere else in the natural man would say well maybe this place would be more beneficial than this place but you honor the commitment you made because you felt led to go there because you committed unto God because it's not a business it's a Ministry and so you make sacrifices and you you you you stay true to your word and sometimes you offend people even but why do you do it you're doing it because you believe that the cause is greater so you want to lay down things and listen it's not restricted tonight I'm not saying it for my own sake it's not restricted to the ministry each one of us here can probably be a witness that you made sacrifices in your life somewhere amen and why did I make the sacrifice to make because I Fear God because I care about the people of God and you've made sacrifices let's everyone here if they're any sort of an age at all you've made sacrifices in your life whether you realize it or not amen some people sacrifice their career for a family and some people sacrifice their family for a career amen if you go to college and you want to do well you got to sacrifice some of your time of of being friends and being social just studying to apply yourself and if you don't care about that you'll sacrifice your future uh career or whatever to go have a party and have a good time amen so no matter what you're doing you're making a sacrifice amen we looking we just had a we just observed Memorial Day this week listen men sacrifice their lives for you and I to be here tonight and have the Liberty to preach this gospel and to preach this message and to believe that men made sacrifices with no expert listen they didn't go and say well it's going to work out for me they were laying their lives down for the cause that they were fighting for for their generations to come for you and I tonight that made a sacrifice for the greater good amen so we tonight we are we are here because they've secured Liberties for us through their sacrifice amen listen if God has called you to do something you've got to make sacrifices sometimes let me just say this sometimes you say well listen well I can't do that I'm not able to make that sacrifice make no mistake you're still making a sacrifice and remember what you've done is you've sacrificed your relationship or you're standing with God for ease or for comfort so no matter what you're doing you're making a sacrifice amen The Book of Malachi talks about all these sacrifices the priests brought and they bring these sacrifices to God he said listen if you offer this to the governor if you offer this to your word your boss at work or your daddy he wouldn't want it and you think it's acceptable to me to offer the lame and the heart and the blind these sacrifices of these animals it's a stink in my nostrils he said amen we see with the Elijah and the prophets about listen the prophets of Baal made sacrifices hey they cut themselves and they worshiped and they did things but it was for the wrong purpose and we as Christians were called to make sacrifices sometimes we sacrifice our time our money even our happiness or our comfort because we are called the Bible says to present our bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is our reasonable service amen we're called to make the Bible says spiritual sacrifice with the fruit of our lips giving Thanksgiving unto God Amen so no matter what you're doing we're making sacrifices and I hope I'm not I hope I'm not wearing that word out too much but this is what I'm talking about tonight amen so listen if we're gonna make a sacrifice what I'm saying tonight is we want to make the right kind of sacrifice if you're gonna make a sacrifice make it a meaningful one don't make it empty don't make it vain amen and listen if we're not prepared to make them it's only going to invite ruin into our own lives listen if we say we want to serve the Lord and we're going to set out Jesus said you make sure you count the cost first because it's gonna cost you something somewhere it might cost you a friend it might cost you a job it might cost you are you standing with your family whatever it is there is a cost associated with taking up your cross and following Jesus Christ amen so there's always a cost involved and if we're not ready for that we've invited we've invited ruin into our lives amen just like Kane in the butt listen Kane nabel both had sacrifices and Cain I I think about it sometimes King probably labored harder for his sacrifice but it wasn't by Revelation it wasn't what God wanted he could say look how hard it worked look what I've done but it was empty and Jesus said the same thing to the Jews he said listen in vain you worship me teaching for Doctrine you teach the com the the traditions of men and so the Commandments of God so if we're gonna make a sacrifice we don't want to be like Cain who made all of his work and his effort it was for nothing we look at the we look at King Saul in the Bible listen King Saul was told to go down and utterly Smite now I should have put it in here who it was I think it was the amalekite say man listen he was told to go uh is that word well praise the Lord you say well this is some preacher here amen should have put listen King songs he was called to to go and utterly Smite that nation and when he didn't do that amen the prophet Samuel comes and what does he really rebuke some and and I I love that well I don't love it I actually dislike but it's it's telling how he he justifies his behavior said listen I've collected all these goats and I collected all these sheep it's to be a sacrifice for God and Samuel said but listen it's better to obey than to sacrifice it doesn't do any good to sacrifice if you can't obey the Lord he's not looking just for you to say listen I gave this up for God and I gave that up are you obeying what he said if I do a lot and I cut up a hundred chickens and I cut their heads off and I burn them on a pie that doesn't mean anything to God amen so it's not what I want it's not my will or your will it's the will of the Lord amen praise the Lord so listen sacrifice to help you get this this what I'm trying to get at tonight our sacrifices are not optional because we're always going to be sacrificing something but what kind of sacrifice we offer it shows our priorities and it shows what kind of value we place in those priorities so there's no way around it we might as well make the right meaningful kind of choices amen and listen we are here tonight because like I said people have made sacrifices men and women have made sacrifices throughout the ages for us to be here but what greater sacrifice tonight do we have but what God give us when he offered us on Jesus Christ for us and offering for your sins and your trespasses amen listen we are not making sacrifices tonight to be found righteous we are making them because we have already been found righteous amen because of what God has done because he's made a way I mean we're not trying to attain some some sort of a righteousness tonight by our own ability but we do it because we have responded to what he's done for us so he's sitting he's trying to evaluate what your sacrifice looks like what did his look like amen praise the Lord he made a sacrifice for you and I tonight to be here listen not just for the world that we're in listen we are beneficiaries today of what he's done for us amen we are beneficiaries tonight of his power to heal the sick we're a beneficiary tonight of his power to raise the dead to make righteous not which is corrupted and dead and sins and trespasses we are beneficiary tonight of everything he paid for when he made the sacrifice of Calvary and tonight we don't have to wait we have received the earnest of our inheritance in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so if you've got the Holy Ghost tonight you've got a reason to Rejoice because the sacrifice was enough for you the sacrifice is enough for me what he paid for what he made a way for it's enough for us tonight and he didn't just sacrifice for this life that we're living now but for the world to come a greater world this is just the beginning we barely scratched the surface of what God's gonna do in the lives of his people he has gone to prepare a place for us that where you are he would be there also of this Earthly House of a tabernacle be destroyed we haven't house waiting that's been laid up and listen it's already paid for there's no lien there's no mortgage there's nothing you've got to do it's been paid for through the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made for you and I tonight so we talk about what he has paid for what he's paid for you're not supposed to pay for because sometimes people get this attitude they they approach the Lord and maybe let's say they're sick and body they come say well Lord I'll do this and I'll do that and if I do this will you heal me but listen he already said I did this with my stripes you're already healed so don't make the mistake tonight of trying to pay for something he's already paid for it and he's much more qualified to pay for it than you and I tonight so we all make sacrifices but God made a sacrifice God pay the price amen let me say this tonight he didn't just provide for it he made a sacrifice to pay for it you say well listen God owns the cattle in a thousand hills he he's making a place where the streets are made of gold it's not like God lacks for material amen listen money is no object to God Amen well praise the Lord listen if it's simply a matter of supply and demand well well can God can God provide this listen he can make Manna he can make Quail he can make anything he makes streets of gold he can multiply loads of fishes amen he can make squirrels from nothing it's not a problem listen if it was just a matter of what I can make another thin air our Federal Reserve does that that's why your dollars aren't worth anything anymore we're not pray if I'm getting political tonight hey man listen they print billions and trillions of dollars all the time they didn't bring it anymore they just type in a number well yeah we've got this much money out there that's why it's not worth anything if you just conjured up by itself there's no value attached to it but God isn't just Conjuring up things amen your salvation this future home this future world that you're going to live in a sacrifice was necessary listen there's some things that can't be paid unless a sacrifice is made because that attaches value to what is being offered I mean one thing I've got to send your sins are forgiven but that wasn't possible the price was too great the wages of sin was death somebody had to pay your price it's not enough to say God I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it will you forgive me but somebody still had to pay for every sin for every short coming for every wrong thought everything you've ever been through but somebody paid for it amen hallelujah unless it's paid for tonight it's paid for by the blood of the Lamb that was slanted Calvary and listen he didn't make a down payment he paid the whole thing if you paid the whole thing tonight you don't have to pay one minute oh Hallelujah so God has provided a sacrifice for the world to come amen it would be one thing if he was like some Heathen Idol or some Heathen god well you've got to make me sacrifices and you've got to do this and you've got to do that it's rules for me but not for thee it'd be one thing if God required us to make a sacrifice and he just sat on a cloud in heaven and he destroyed the Psalms and he was he was he was uh he was uh indifferent to the plight of man but God said I require sacrifice but I'm also willing to make a sacrifice I'm not going to require you to do something that I myself would be unwilling to do you hear me tonight God did not put you in we say listen what I've been through listen what I've given up look at my struggles look at what he gave up for you look at what he went to for you and I tonight we're not the only ones that have ever struggled our Lord come down from Glory he come from the ramparts of Glory he come from a multitude of angels he come from that place into this Dimension and he humbled himself and he suffered he became perfectly learned through obedience through the things he suffered and he humbled himself even unto death my my God's letting us know listen I've made sacrifices too when you sit there and you begin to feel sorry for yourself man I've lost this and I've given up that and I've gone through this remember he went through things too he is naughty he's not ignorant he is able to be touched with the feeling of our property he was tempted just like we were yet without sin it's not just you and I tonight well look what I've done for God look what he's done for you and I that's why we get discouraged we forget what it costs sometimes we don't really value it the way we ought to amen listen I know it costs a lot of you a lot to be here tonight a lot of you've given up a lot to be here and to serve the Lord and have a conscience void of offense before God but it cost him too he didn't just consign you to do he said I will also pay the price I will also lay my life down Hallelujah we all know the story of Abraham Abraham and Isaac God calls upon Abraham I want you to go and offer your son Isaac as a sacrifice and God is requiring the most precious thing he could require from Abraham hey man this is not just his offspring this is his miracle baby this is the heir of all things it was promised that God promised him this one specifics and I'll name him for you I'll tell you what he's gonna be like I'll tell you he's going to come according to the time of life God perfectly laid up this one and then God says that's the one I want I want the one that you put all your hopes and dreams in I want the one that you placed all you've invested yourself into amen it's in this desperate time Abraham's prepared amen unless in the Bible tells us Abraham encounter that God could raise it up because listen he said I'm gonna go up on the mountain I am the lad we're going to go up and we're gonna come back why because God didn't promise him another seed he said this one and Isaac shall I see be called God sent this one and not another one so when he goes up there to make that sacrifice he realizes God's gonna have to make a way for me because what God is requiring for me I am not able to give him hello help me out somebody you ever been there I've got I can't give you what you need that's why God says I will provide for me will provide a sacrifice listen there's times you get in your website I don't know how I'm going to make it through you're going to make it through because he already made it through for you God can do things he can provide things you can't provide for yourself amen and as he begins to do that God says listen I shall provide I love this he says I shall provide for myself I'm the one that required it but I'm the one that's gonna pay it I shall provide for myself and sacrifice amen amen listen God has already made his Covenant with Abraham he said I swore by himself then in Abraham I would bless the Nations and then God said listen I already promised to take care of it I can't put that back on him now I already promised it I already made a commitment now it's up to me to make the sacrifice amen so he has made promises to Abraham of his own will and now he's going to keep his word amen in other words I require a sacrifice like this one but you don't have what it takes to pay it so I'm gonna pay it amen the Bible says in Abraham called the name of the Lord Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and I like that he sees it amen we talk about Jehovah Jireh and we talk about you know it means the Lord provides it actually has a compound meaning it's more than just how he provides he does provide we believe that tonight but this word Jehovah Jireh means that he sees it as well in other words he sees the need and then he sees two the need amen he's not ignorant of it and you walk up to the man I didn't see that coming he saw the need before you encountered the need and he made a way for you and he paid for that before you even got there so God who's required it is willing to pay it himself he's not some Buddha up on a mountain telling you well this is how you're going to overcome he said I will show you I will lay down my life so you know how to overcome amen listen that realm and thinking that was just a ram and a ticket but what was he telling Abraham I'm gonna provide a sacrifice I'm gonna send a lamb one day he'll be caught in his humanity and that Lamb of God he will pay the price he'll make the sacrifice listen brother Ben said he had a choice he had a choice he could have lived a normal life he could have went and had a family he could have did whatever he wanted but he saw the value and what he was going to pay for he despised the cross he endured the shame for the joy that was set before him listen that Joy wasn't just set before him at Calvary it was set before the foundation of the world that's why when he prayed for you he said father I pray that they would share the glory that I had with you in the beginning listen any sorrow you come from he knew where you were going that's why he paid the price he didn't just go and put money on a desk or write a check out he laid down his life because of you you were the joy that set before him amen you're the one he saw your need and he saw to it amen for God to provide a sacrifice like I said a moment ago he said I'll provide for myself to provide for Abraham was to provide for himself because he was in come with Abraham amen listen when God tonight when he has provided for you he's provided for himself your bone of his bone your flatulous flesh your spirit of his Spirit your power is power let me say this way without this bride she is him listen the Bible says no man ever hated his own flesh but he nourishes it and he challenges it so should a husband lay down his life he should he shouldn't he should he should cherish his wife amen how does a husband care biblically speaking how does the husband care for his wife it's not just by Senator Macy's or letting it on Amazon he lays down his life for his family he makes sacrifices to make sure they're taken care of and God made a sacrifice for you because you're his bride he didn't choose him he chose you and he took that Veil and he placed it on his shoulder and said you're my responsibility now I will pay the price for you amen Paul says he nourishes a man nourishes his own flesh he cherishes it even as the Lord does the church amen praise the Lord let me say it this way tonight his our need that is his need say does God need anything God in you does brother you need things amen listen when God was going to go wipe out Sam Gamora he says shall I hide from Abraham the thing I'm gonna do listen Abraham I'm gonna go down to these cities I'm going to wipe him out and amen says listen I've got a need down there I've got a I've got a man by the name a lot I got family down there till this time I'm gonna see God if there's 50 or Isis will you spam yeah I'll spare him for your sake listen he wasn't spamming for their own sake he did it because God would not judge the righteous with the unrighteous and even when he can't find ten righteous God sends two angels and he pulls lot out of Sodom why because Abraham's need is God's need your knee tonight it is God's need and listen if you would take care of yourself if you want to nourish your own flesh how much more don't tell me God's not a provider's name he's still a provider he's still Jehovah Jireh he still does the things he said he would do he still makes a way when there is no way hey man friends there's a lot of things that you and I we could sacrifice and devote Our Lives to and give up things for amen but there's only one thing that God made a sacrifice for you and I if he was willing to make that for us how can you and I not give everything to him he gave his only begotten son for us he proved it amen this future home this greater world he was so willing to have it he laid down his life for you and I amen of his own will be got his right we didn't have to twist his arm that was his idea amen if he is the benefactor of a greater world what does that make us tonight the beneficiaries we are beneficiaries is that right brother bam says this in the rising in the sun he says how do we know that he was the Christ because he proved what he was talking about how will I know the message of the hour God proves what he promised and he talks about it aren't you glad God didn't just hide this under aren't you glad you know about it tonight where would your life be tonight what would you look like if you didn't know what he did for you but listen you're his bride he doesn't have to keep secrets from you you're the one he confides him you're the one who tells love secrets too he says let's not light something up for you I've done a little something for you here I put a little more on the ground over here you get a bow ass tonight that's made provision he's laid up for you because he wants you in this home Hallelujah so he does it and then he tells you God proves what he promised he talks about it that is the identification we are beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proved what he has talked about what he promised to do in Christ he proved on the resurrection man what he promised to do in the days of Moses he proved it when he promised in the days of Enoch he proved it and all the days of the Apostles he proved it now Hallelujah in this day he proves what he said can I get a witness tonight he proves what he says why because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to God oh what a message he says I say the same thing what a message tonight you've been paid for bought by the blood of Jesus Christ and he's proved it through the resurrection and listen we are not just tonight we are not just here discussing the resurrection we Are Witnesses because we are beneficiaries we know what he's done in our life we've seen him heal the sick we've seen him up on the eyes of the blind we're a witness and he can take the violent Sinner and not just cleanse their hands it can cleanse your heart tonight oh my god brother Brandon says on Easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in crisis crucifixion they were with him at the resurrection we are his beneficiaries quickened after being dead in darkness amen they don't light your fire you wouldn't might be wet hey man we're we're not just gonna get raised we've already been raised the Bible says we've been made to sit down we have benefited each one of us personally we are personal beneficiaries of what he did 2000 years ago brother Brown says this this body may be rot in the sea it may rot in the ground there might not be a spoonful of Ashes but she is coming forth amen we get so worried about how we're gonna get in the grave all I'm worried about is getting out I mean you might not have the right kind of insurance but I got a Blessed Assurance I mean no matter where they stick me they can join the peat bog they can bring you to a million pieces they can feed into the Sharks but guess what on the resurrection no matter where you are no matter what condition you look like you're coming up you're coming forth listen he can number the hairs on your head he can rearrange his body you can scan it to the four wins he's gonna bring it forth if you can do that with your body what can you do with your bank account what can you do with your health tonight amen what can you do in the situations that you're dealing with tonight he's more than able he's proved it he's already paid for it he's already made away man quit trying to make a way when he's made a way for you except his way it's God's provided way Amen to obey that's better than sacrifice amen he says the spirit that raise up my Lord from the dead has quickened this Mortal body it's quick in your mortal body amen and we are his beneficiaries of his resurrection his policy of eternal life that I talked so much about you know no wonder he said fear not he would know listen that's not the end how do you know because he already did it and he come back that's why you know you can come back if he raise up Christ he can raise listen if he didn't resurrect our faith would be in Maine we would be the most miserable people on the face of the Earth but he did raise proving he can do it again and he's gonna do it again amen sometimes I don't know how I don't know how long it's gonna be but I know he's gonna do it he promised it he's already shown me the earnest of it in my life listen if he can take who I was and I know what I was you know what you were if he could take that life and change it it's not hard for him to raise the Dead [Applause] amen he says no wonder he said fear not he would know first Paul said death where is thy sting grave where is your Victory I'm full of quickening power Hallelujah thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ yes sir quickening power now listen if you're not full of quickening power I understand why you'd worry about it I understand why you'd be concerned I don't know how I'm gonna get up but if you're full of quickening power you've got enough listen when Elijah's bones were dead in a cave there's enough quickening power to raise up another man let alone him from the dead listen you've got more than what it takes tonight to raise it from the dead by the Holy Ghost it's in you you've got more than enough tonight listen the policy is not just for enough it's for whosoever well there's an abundance of life it's a gift of righteousness for us tonight oh my he's still Jehovah Jireh you believe that tonight listen when Dr best was in Houston Texas and he challenged brother random and brother Bosworth he challenged him on the idea that God is still a Healer God doesn't do those things anymore he's he's different and and brother Bosworth gets up there and listen this was this was a smart man he knew the Bible he understood Divine Healing and brothers he just did one little thing that was too much for Dr best to handle he goes up there and he asks him the question he said I've got one question for you he says to the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah pertain to Jesus amen because if they don't then he's a different person it's some different God but if he's the same God then he does the same things if he was Jehovah Rapha then he's Jehovah Rapha now it was Jehovah Jireh then and he's Jesus today he's still Jehovah Jireh today amen if he was Jehovah Jireh before he's still Jehovah Jireh and I want you to think about this because here's Dr best this is an educated man he's got Seminary teaching he's got degrees he's educated he knows all this stuff but that man was all of his seminar experience and his timely Pulpit couldn't answer one question he couldn't answer it because he knew the answer would condemn him let me say this the answer might condemn him but it don't condemn me that's what saves me that name was everything he learned and everything he understood he couldn't answer the question it's just like when the chief priests and the scribes and the elders they questioned Jesus he said let me ask you a question John's baptism was it from God or was it from Men let's sat there man how are we going to answer that if we say it was for men amen but the people who are John's a prophet man they'll take up arms against us they all know he was sent by God and if John's baptisms from God then they'll say why didn't you believe him I may ask you about the ministry of this day this this Elijah that we had was it a man or God it was man then how did it do the things that City would do and if it's a God why didn't you believe him so he's educated scholarly men these scribes in Paris he's just like Dr best said well listen I'm going to sit here and make fun I'll crucify you but I can't answer the question because the answer condemns me no matter what we cannot answer and Jesus said well I'm not going to answer you either praise the Lord somebody listen friends don't you ever have a life where you can't answer that question because it'll condemn you like it did them amen but praise God hallelujah I love it because that man he couldn't answer that question that scholarly preacher he was afraid to face the answer but you've got a little poor woman by the name of Hattie Wright and then she never never was educated in a seminar not some big Theologian just a simple woman about as poor as could be amen but when brother Branham when the lord gave brother Ram them squirrels out there in the woods listen he couldn't explain the science behind it he couldn't explain the materials and how it all come together he knew it was a bit it wasn't a vision he knew that much amen but he didn't even know how they got there he thought about that story and he began to think about that Ram that Abraham saw him to think and he thought about that very same thing he said well all I can say is he's still Jehovah Jireh and that little woman she didn't argue she didn't fuss she didn't try to explain it she said brother Branham that's nothing but the truth and when she said that Hallelujah she said the right thing and then sometimes you just got to say Amen to the word of God quit trying to explain it quit trying to educate yourself India just take the word believe the word and say Amen I don't believe he sold Jehovah Jireh and the bride says amen I believe he's still a Healer today and we say amen I don't know how he does it but I know that he does it I know he paid for it and the same God that changed my life the same girl that changed your life he's the same God that does he sing tonight we say Amen listen you got something better than the Seminary experience you got something better than Dr mascot you've got the earnest Hallelujah that's nothing but the truth that's what it takes tonight not trying to argue or disprove she believed in the benefactor so she became a beneficiary When You Believe in the benefactor that makes you a beneficiary hey man how many beneficiaries we got here tonight when you believe the testimony of Jesus Christ you overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony because his testimony becomes your testimony you didn't bring yourself here tonight you didn't do this on your own you're a beneficiary of the of the finished work of Calvary tonight Hallelujah he's still a provider tonight because the sacrifice that he painted Calvary is even enough today he's still Jehovah Jireh in 2023 he's still Jehovah Rapha in 2023 he's still Jehovah in 2023 we are his beneficiaries because he laid it up for us yeah he's our benefactor tonight amen amen he didn't just pay for our Redemption he sacrificed forward amen we look at the scripture I talked about in the beginning Nehemiah was a benefactor of the work there in Jerusalem and he entreats the god I read that 19th verse he treats the Lord he says think upon me God for the good that I've done for these people like I said here a while back we just had a memorial day this week and we remember the sacrifices that people made we we take time to observe what they did you take a certain man or you take a philanthropist and they they donate money to build a hospital or or some cause they'll make a memorial form in honor of their sacrifice so they'll get them a plaque or a tile or something to make him a statue if it was a lot of money I don't know but we make these memorials who remember the sacrifice that was made amen we remember that prices were paid but listen in the world to come there's only one Memorial there there's a memorial unto the Lord and let me tell you this the disciples they got a chance to see it in this life and not just the ones that come I said what are you talking about Jesus appears to them after his resurrection and there's Thomas he says he says Thomas said I won't believe except I can thrust my hand and decide and feel the scars where he's at and Jesus he comes and he appears to Thomas and it appears to the disciples he says reach hither thy finger and behold my hands reach hither thy hand and thrust into my side be not faithless but believing listen he left invisible evidence of his contribution he left a visible evidence of his sacrifice amen praise the Lord my my brother brother man talks about those Jews he said when they see him they'll say where did you get these wounds in the house of my friends they'll let them say man something happened here he doesn't look like everybody else in this group oh my think about that and honey man they'll see him who they pierced and they will weep amen that brother man said you could take any hypocrite today he could have nail pierced hands he could try to look like Jesus and that would just be a man doing it he's not identified that way today he's identified right now by his word and his spirit amen they've been record from Heaven who he is but in a greater world the benefactor of that world the one that paid for it amen he's got a memorial for his sacrifice I don't know how you feel about it tonight maybe you feel differently but if you believe the Bible and what the prophet says about it amen listen when you and I get there we're not going to be all marked up you're not gonna have back pain you know that scar that you've had since you were three it's not going to be there if you're missing fingers you're missing something it's all going to be there each and every one of us that's resurrected in that lightness there's not gonna be one spot or blemish not one burn mark But the rim says it'll be perfect you're not gonna be chopping pieces or whatever there's a picture that's on file amen this negative of what you look like it wasn't just taken at your best when you were 18 or 20 or 22 it was taken before the world began there's a picture on file and listen when you come up in the resurrection there's not going to be one indicator physically in your body of what you went through in this life hey man no wrinkled hands no broke down tissues but the best that's all the mark of the Fall another man sitting the resurrection one mark of sin and yet here is Christ's scarred amen he doesn't have a big plaque or a statue he Bears it in his own body this Memorial hey man when you look at him you'll be like that was the price that was a pain I can still look at it even in the new heavens and a new Earth there's those scars that held him to the Cross there's the stripes that bore my healing in them it's all been paid for it can never be forgotten amen I heard a man say one time the scars that Jesus has they're the only man-made thing in heaven and everything else that God made but there's one thing there that man made the scars on Jesus body hey man you know brother Ben tells the story about Fanny Crosby some some secular music producers they come to her one time of course she was blind and they asked her to write these worldly songs she refused he said God called me to write songs for him now listen she could have made money she could have been even more famous but she she Sanctified that gift to God she sacrificed her own advancement she sacrificed what she could have done in this world he said God called me to write songs for him and then infidels they mocked her and they made fun of her and said listen you're blind you've never seen him before when you get to heaven how are you even gonna recognize him well first of all they were ignorant she's not gonna be blind there are you gonna recognize him how you gonna know you say you believe in this Jesus he did all these things for you how are you going to recognize him and she began to write that song she said I shall know him I shall know him and Redeemed by his side I shall stand I shall know him I shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hands I think every day should be Memorial Day for us to our Lord Jesus Christ when we take the communion we we drink the wine we break the bread we do it in remembrance of him it's a memorial unto him the only Memorial we're gonna have there the memorial what he did for us the greatest Memorial that's ever been there might not be one in this world and the one to come it's the greatest Memorial amen listen sometimes like Fanny Crosby we have to choose a hard path brother Brandon chose a hard path but you know what that's why there's a great reward waiting for him hey man listen we we are gifted many things by his sacrifice but when we make sacrifices there's a reward for your service like Nehemiah was gonna have Fanny Crosby she made sacrifices but there's a crown that's waiting for her because she she did not suck her she did not sell out her gift that God gave her to the world Amen and all I want you to understand tonight brother Bram chose a hard path and sometimes you and I we choose a hard path but I want you to remember tonight your sacrifice is never in vain the Bible says he's not forgetful of your labor of love you believe that tonight amen it's not in Maine because he made a sacrifice for you and I amen he made a sacrifice that one day we could sit at a table and he would wipe away every tear from our eyes and he would tell us well done you fought battles you went through things you paid prices you made sacrifices but I'm gonna reward you well done I made a sacrifice but you made one and I'll remember yours too well done good and faithful servant hey man when he when he made a sacrifice for the joy you tonight it was worth it to him and he didn't get bamboozled you were worth the sacrifice to him amen when you when you give up something for the cause of Christ would you will delay something it's worth it every time don't forget tonight it's always worth it to give it unto God amen isn't he wonderful friends we listen tonight we can have the same kind of confidence that Nehemiah had God will remember us as well maybe tonight God's calling some of us to maybe even make some sort of a sacrifice tonight maybe at our job or a family situation whatever it is he's always worth it friends hey man perhaps this year you'll have to make a sacrifice he never had to make before hey man but let me Testify the same God that was faithful to Abraham he's faithful to you and I he's a rewarder do you believe that tonight you know the Bible says in Hebrews 11 6 without faith it is impossible to please God for he that comes to God must believe that he is and we forget about the second part I think a lot and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and let's not just say well I believe that he is he wants you to have the same faith that he is a rewarder now listen it's it's always been interesting to me because it's like well God doesn't have to do it that way but God chose to do it that way God wants to reward you amen not not reward you salvation or something like that he paid for that but he went he wants to reward you when you make the right choice when you honor him and you obey him amen he wants listen it's his idea he wants to do it I think we act like we're robbing god well listen I don't you know I don't want to do this and this and that and stuff and I don't expect anything listen you should expect it on the pretense that God is a rewarder he wants us to think listen he's not well this is politically correct I guess it's not some sort of an Indian giver or something or he's faithful he wants us to believe that he's a rewarder amen of them listen how many believes that please leave that for your own life listen we're not here tonight to build hay and wooden stubble we we've built our lives up on this word of God with gold and silver and precious stones why because there's a reward in it he wants that listen he wants it for you that's why that's why God Brother Brad at one point in his life said why do I have to push you into everything where's your reward is that all right listen he wants to give you beneficiaries of what he's paid for but he also wants you to prove the same character in your life I mean sometimes you're gonna make a sacrifice for your family for your church for peace whatever it is amen when you take God's way it's not an easy it's the hard way listen if it was easy everybody would do it but we do type because we believe that the price is outweighed by the benefit Nehemiah could have lived an opulent Life as a governor he could have had all this money but he said you know what I'm going to give that up for the cause of God for God's people you believe that tonight let's stand to your feet I want to remind you tonight if you're discouraged God's rewarder of them that diligently seek him he's faithful tonight amen he's made a way for you and I he is not forgetful wherever whatever you're going they're not being encouraged he's made sacrifices too he was willing to pay the price he's made a way for us amen it's a reasonable service in light of everything he did to it's a reasonable service to offer him sacrifice let's just take a few moments let's offer him some spiritual sacrifice with our lips as we as we sing here let's just pray and father we thank you tonight Lord you are so faithful Lord you are so faithful you are a rewarder of your people when they humble themselves and they call upon you we can testify tonight I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Father help us to be diligent help us to apply ourselves may we not be like that man that buried his talent but may we labor for your kingdom until you come Lord we're thankful tonight we are not here of our own power we are here tonight

Our Lives be a memorial to the resurrection of Jesus Christ that you've witnessed in this day through the prophet of Malachi 4 through the scriptures thank you Lord tonight for all you've done I pray for these people these dear people that you paid a price for May you bless them I pray may you strengthened may you establish may you settle each one may you exceeding abundantly do for them above anything that they could ask or think may you work in a greater measure in our lives than you've ever worked before maybe we just so yield to you tonight may we just so submit ourselves to you tonight Lord I believe you're calling us to lay our lives down once again to Die daily to be willing to say Lord I'll take my way with your despised View Lord I'm so thankful tonight our labors are not forgotten you see the things that nobody else sees you see the private struggles you see the sacrifices no one else sees Lord you promised to reward us if we would labor to be seen a herd of men we would have a reward already you said but we do these things as unto you knowing that we get a greater rewarding Glory I'm so thankful tonight you're faithful in every word that you promised lord it's
