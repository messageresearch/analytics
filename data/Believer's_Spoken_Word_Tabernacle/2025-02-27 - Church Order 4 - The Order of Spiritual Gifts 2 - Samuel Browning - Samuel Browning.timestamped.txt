[28:44] Lord oh praise the
[28:48] Lord oh I praise the
[28:51] Lord
[28:53] hallelujah I'm free
[28:58] [Applause]
[29:06] [Music]
[29:10] praise the
[29:13] Lord so good to be in the house of the
[29:15] Lord tonight and so good to be gathered
[29:18] together good to have brother Malachi
[29:20] with us amen and uh and all the rest of
[29:24] you has been strangers
[29:29] be so good on Sunday the services the
[29:33] lord gave us here on Sunday and uh you
[29:38] know it was an expectation we we come
[29:40] with and um also was very good to see
[29:44] different ones on Sunday that hadn't
[29:45] been able to be in church for a while
[29:48] and so that was very that was very
[29:50] refreshing as well um and just to see
[29:53] just the just the sweet atmosphere of
[29:55] the Holy Spirit just coming in such such
[29:58] a wonderful way and then there in the
[30:00] night service after the questions and
[30:02] answers and just so many uh different
[30:05] needs and just being prayed for and and
[30:08] ministered to I certainly expect great
[30:10] testimonies to come from that it was
[30:12] such a wonderful atmosphere wasn't it
[30:14] just a wonderful presence of the Lord
[30:16] and and you know that's something that
[30:19] the word of the Lord will bring that and
[30:20] where Believers are gathered and where
[30:22] our hearts are in that in that desire
[30:25] and looking for him we can come to
[30:26] church for a lot of things uh but the
[30:29] main thing that we come to church for is
[30:31] to see him and to be able to see where
[30:35] our our weak places are and you know
[30:37] that takes real sons and daughters of
[30:39] God to be able to look in the face of
[30:41] the word and say God show me where my
[30:43] shortcomings are because the reality of
[30:45] it is is that we until the very change
[30:48] of the body we continually need to be
[30:53] growing and we need his leadership in
[30:55] every part of our life so we're not just
[30:58] here left and spinning our wheels and
[31:00] but but God is working in our lives and
[31:03] so we we know that you know no matter
[31:05] what everything else is going on in the
[31:07] world and all of those other things you
[31:09] know the thing of it is is that that
[31:11] those things that are taking place we
[31:13] can see things here and there but you
[31:15] know it's not for us to try to infer or
[31:18] figure everything out even when you look
[31:20] at the the ministry of the prophet in
[31:23] this hour when he would speak about
[31:26] going into to minister the church ages
[31:28] it wasn't until that things be to press
[31:31] on him that he saw the hour we're in and
[31:33] he said I must give this to the church
[31:36] at this time so a lot of things around
[31:40] us but God let me keep my sight let me
[31:43] keep my mind let me keep my heart
[31:45] centered on the coming of the Lord amen
[31:49] because that's what's more important
[31:50] than anything um I want to uh mention
[31:53] there there was there's an order form
[31:56] that's out there there's four samples
[31:58] books uh I don't know if we there was
[32:00] there was four out there and so if we
[32:02] got the I I left the four of them out
[32:05] there two um in English and Spanish in
[32:08] each of the seven Church age book as
[32:10] well as the sealed book and um uh
[32:14] brother George had went through that
[32:15] here on uh Saturday evening and so um
[32:20] those are some things that I want to be
[32:21] able to put um an order in uh for that
[32:25] and so if you are wanting um any of
[32:28] those books I tell you I would really
[32:31] love for you to have those books uh
[32:34] especially when you get into the uh the
[32:36] church ages because brother Brenham put
[32:38] so much what what what took place after
[32:40] the seals were open this is why you find
[32:42] that there were so many things that the
[32:44] Holy Spirit had him to put into the
[32:46] church age messages after that he had
[32:49] already spoke and so that's what's
[32:51] something that's so important and I say
[32:53] this very openly because there's things
[32:56] that's been said and taught and
[32:59] mentioned in the past it's false and
[33:02] regarding and surrounding that book and
[33:05] so those are things that I'm very
[33:06] adamant about that um and so those are
[33:10] things that I wanted to be very clear
[33:12] because you know I know that maybe even
[33:14] some of you that are here you haven't
[33:16] read that book but I can tell you that
[33:19] book is one where brother Ram says I put
[33:21] the doctrine in it and that on the seven
[33:23] Church age book you'll find such Clarity
[33:25] when it gets into the baptism of the
[33:27] Holy Ghost all the doctrine it's laid
[33:30] out so clearly in that church age book
[33:32] and so you know it's like um brother
[33:34] George didn't um go over this the other
[33:37] night but we were we were talking and
[33:40] you can look it up at home but if you
[33:42] look up Romans
[33:43] 16:22 if I were to ask you you know
[33:45] brother Aaron who wrote the book of
[33:47] Romans you would say well that's Paul
[33:49] Paul wrote that book and if you look in
[33:51] Romans
[33:52] 16:22 it says I tortilis wrote this
[33:56] epistle
[33:58] so what was it Paul he took down Paul's
[34:01] words right and that's how that most of
[34:04] the letters when we say oh that's Paul's
[34:05] letter well most of them outside of a
[34:07] few were actually taken down by other
[34:09] people so sometimes you know it's things
[34:11] that when we look at all of that that I
[34:13] know that for the most part that's not
[34:15] been uh an issue and things like that
[34:17] here and I know that um you know there's
[34:20] been a lot of other things that have
[34:21] been kind of ironed out in other places
[34:23] as well too and uh but sometimes things
[34:25] can just be uh you know taught and he
[34:28] gets caught in a certain way and people
[34:30] get scarecrows and uh but it's like what
[34:32] brother George says he said show me one
[34:34] place show me one person that that that
[34:36] book's ever hurt and so and it's that
[34:39] those are the things that if to me in
[34:41] you know uh with the young people and
[34:44] things like that brother Malachi brother
[34:45] Shane you remember that I took a period
[34:47] of time with just the young people and
[34:49] they each had a copy of the church age
[34:50] book and I just spent time and I went
[34:53] through uh a meeting after meeting we
[34:55] had with the young people just trying to
[34:57] go through it and it's very challenging
[34:58] for me not to dive into things and just
[35:01] to hit and skip over it but you know
[35:03] because it's it's just filled and I'll
[35:05] tell you if you say well I'm looking for
[35:06] a devotional book save your money at the
[35:09] Christian
[35:10] bookstore $5 right there that that very
[35:14] thing will get will it'll be a very very
[35:16] benefit to your life absolutely and uh
[35:18] and I just say it in this way if if
[35:20] anyone would be you know maybe you're
[35:22] you're not able to do it at this time
[35:24] and and uh you need some help well just
[35:27] just see me just see me because I want
[35:28] it in your hands I certainly want it and
[35:31] if it's in Spanish and or English and
[35:33] however we need it I also contacted
[35:35] brother Barry and asked him I said hey
[35:38] because I asked brother George do you
[35:39] have any in French uh because uh we we
[35:43] we have a French population here now and
[35:45] so I said do you have any in French so
[35:47] brother Barry said let me check brother
[35:49] George said he didn't have any so uh
[35:51] they're working on that for me right now
[35:53] to try to get that in place so uh we
[35:56] really want to um try to do that as well
[35:58] and you know there's just only so many
[36:00] services you have I told my wife I said
[36:02] I'd love to have just a service where I
[36:03] can deal just with the church ages and
[36:05] just to have maybe a Friday night we can
[36:07] come together but we all have all kinds
[36:09] of schedules and uh so you know we
[36:12] realize we can't do that and so may God
[36:14] help us to use the utilize the time but
[36:16] I I really enjoy those things I believe
[36:19] you'll be benefited and blessed as well
[36:21] and and I'll tell you one thing that
[36:22] I've done with the church age book is
[36:24] that I've done it like brother George
[36:26] was saying uh I actually um it was one
[36:29] of the times he was speaking to our
[36:30] young people and I just took it uh what
[36:32] he was saying because you know you've
[36:34] comb through it you you you read through
[36:36] it many times and other times I'm in
[36:38] studying in certain places but I just
[36:40] made it a part of the devotional so you
[36:42] know you read a page page and a half a
[36:45] day and and believe me it's it's like a
[36:48] concentrate you know what I'm talking
[36:50] about but but you get through it you you
[36:52] you get through it and it's it's good
[36:53] it's digestible and uh it's really good
[36:56] so uh
[36:58] but so I just that order form is out
[37:00] there and um and so uh we just you can
[37:04] check off what you want and obviously if
[37:07] you don't speak Spanish then you
[37:08] probably don't want one in Spanish uh
[37:10] but the seal book and the the thing with
[37:12] that book that's out there now as I
[37:13] explained and brother George went
[37:15] through brother George went through and
[37:16] redid both of yes you guys can God bless
[37:20] you thank you uh he went through and he
[37:23] put out new uh he he did a nice job on
[37:26] the paragraphs and I was was showing
[37:27] brother Gomez the other night of how
[37:29] that those of you remember the old
[37:31] church age book everything was run
[37:33] together he took the scriptures and it
[37:35] just separated them so it's very easy
[37:37] read um with how that's done so um you
[37:41] know they do have leather bound ones I
[37:43] have a leatherbound seven seal book and
[37:44] a Le leatherbound Church age book but
[37:47] those are about3 $35 a piece and and
[37:49] I've had people that's gifted those to
[37:51] me but if you want those you can I'll
[37:53] get you the website you can order them
[37:55] but I'd like to try to put something
[37:57] together and get an order in here for us
[37:58] on these books so I didn't want to I
[38:01] apologize for taking that time but I
[38:02] thought I would just say that for what's
[38:04] out there um as we stand tonight and we
[38:08] just prepare to open the word of the
[38:10] Lord um I want to uh ask you to continue
[38:14] remember um Sister Sarah Lewis they're
[38:16] just waiting to get her uh transferred
[38:20] um she you know there was a stroke that
[38:22] she suffered here just about a week and
[38:24] a half ago and so it's just was a uh
[38:27] she's been there in the Cleveland Clinic
[38:29] and so they um you know with therapy and
[38:32] everything that is going on so uh
[38:35] they're just looking for then a facility
[38:36] to transfer her to so we want to
[38:38] continue to keep her in prayer and
[38:41] um also uh brother and sister Crest I
[38:44] spoke with them today and and they're
[38:46] not uh feeling well at all and brother
[38:49] Dave bless his heart he said brother
[38:50] Samu I wanted to be there tonight He
[38:52] said you know me I want to be there I
[38:53] said I know you do I said he said but
[38:55] I'll be praying for the service I said I
[38:57] I appreciate that but he just you know
[38:59] the congestion cold and things like that
[39:02] so let's remember him in prayer also
[39:03] brother Dave Jr a lot of train lot of
[39:05] changes at work that are taking place
[39:07] and so he's uh he said he was texting me
[39:10] and writing me about all those things
[39:12] too that's going on it's really trying
[39:14] it's really tying him up there so let's
[39:16] just remember them in prayer and I know
[39:18] we already lifted prayer request and
[39:20] perhaps is there any other unspoken
[39:22] request maybe you have something on your
[39:23] heart to say Lord you know my need maybe
[39:26] it's in your family maybe it's job
[39:28] whatever the situation God is mindful
[39:30] amen let's just can we just go to him in
[39:32] prayer Heavenly Father Lord how we thank
[39:35] you for your mercies once again this

[39:53] Ice And we thank you for those things
[39:55] father we ask that Lord that for each
[39:57] one of these requests Lord that have
[39:59] been written out and read earlier along
[40:02] with these Lord that I've mentioned and
[40:04] every uplifted hand father you know the
[40:07] needs of your children and you are
[40:09] mindful Lord to minister to every one of
[40:12] our needs now we just ask that Lord May

[40:17] each one of the written and the uplifted
[40:19] hands oh God that you would just Lord
[40:22] Minister Lord and father move on behalf

[40:33] our stay you are our everything Lord now
[40:36] may you just have complete control guide
[40:39] and direct Lord the words of my mouth
[40:41] Lord just speak to our hearts tonight in
[40:44] a special way we pray in Jesus precious
[40:47] name amen amen let's look here in First
[40:51] Corinthians chapter
[40:53] 14 uh number two
[41:02] I want to I want to go back into this
[41:05] and I'm just going to try to move to
[41:07] some places here
[41:09] tonight uh with the spiritual gifts just
[41:11] a little
[41:13] bit and um verse
[41:16] one follow after charity and desire
[41:19] spiritual gifts but rather that you may
[41:23] prophesy for he that speaketh in an
[41:25] unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but
[41:28] unto God for no man understandeth him
[41:32] how be it in the spirit he speaketh
[41:35] Mysteries but he that prophesieth
[41:38] speaketh unto men to edification and
[41:41] exhortation and comfort he that speaketh
[41:45] in an unknown tongue edifieth himself
[41:48] but he that prophesieth edifieth the
[41:50] church now I want you to draw your
[41:52] attention back to verse three and that's
[41:54] I'm going to come through that a little
[41:55] bit tonight he that prophet prophesieth
[41:57] speaketh unto men to edification
[42:01] exhortation and comfort amen may God
[42:04] bless the reading of the word as you're
[42:05] being
[42:06] seated Paul goes on to say I would that
[42:10] you all spake with tongues but rather
[42:14] that you prophesied for greater is he
[42:17] that prophesieth than he that speaketh
[42:19] with tongues except he interpret that
[42:23] the church may receive
[42:25] edifying now now notice Paul continues
[42:28] to move with this on the that of the
[42:30] spiritual gifts and I think that no
[42:33] matter if we're dealing with tongues
[42:36] interpretation we're dealing with a song
[42:39] special we're dealing with ministering
[42:42] of the word it should all be about
[42:45] edification of the church because see we
[42:48] could leave that just for the gifts but
[42:50] it actually applies to all that is all
[42:53] that is to be done is for the benefit of
[42:56] the church yeah you see a minister could
[42:59] actually Minister based on the
[43:01] revelation of what he is studying at
[43:04] that particular time and it can be it
[43:07] can be right up here but if it's up
[43:10] there and the people it's not that the
[43:12] people are would be lower but if that's
[43:14] not where we're at and that's not where
[43:16] the needs are at then it only becomes a
[43:19] display of what one knows in the
[43:22] ministry this is why that there's really
[43:24] two terms that I like to use there's a
[43:27] difference between preaching and
[43:28] ministering uh preaching you know uh
[43:31] where it can really get in and it's
[43:33] really preaching preaching of the word
[43:35] and yet really the real preaching should
[43:37] be ministering and that's serving and
[43:40] that is where you don't get to determine
[43:43] what it is that you're going to speak
[43:45] there's sometimes there's things that
[43:46] you think you know and I'm just giving
[43:48] you a little insight that I might think
[43:50] even sometimes when I'm going into a
[43:51] meeting in other places and I think you
[43:54] know sometimes there's been things that
[43:55] have dropped on my heart heart that uh
[43:58] this I think this is I I feel like I'm
[44:00] feeling pressed to go in this direction
[44:02] and then when you get there things all
[44:05] together change and here you are it's
[44:07] almost like you God's just given you
[44:08] from here and you're pulling from here
[44:10] and pulling from there pulling from here
[44:12] pulling from there but you know God
[44:13] knows what he's doing and so I tell you
[44:16] when I first started to Ministry it made
[44:17] me a nervous wreck now it doesn't still
[44:20] don't make it's not that it don't make
[44:21] you nervous but you just what it is it's
[44:23] you come to a place to really you're
[44:24] realizing to rely more upon him and so
[44:27] God knows you know you studied and all
[44:29] those things and it's kind of like
[44:31] brother George Smith what he always
[44:32] tells me he said you prepare the bread
[44:33] ahead of time you get it he said all you
[44:35] got to do when you get there is just
[44:36] slice
[44:37] it so you know and and that part of it
[44:40] comes of just just laying you know just
[44:42] laying in the word and just waiting on
[44:44] God and sometimes God will bring a
[44:46] collection of things together from maybe
[44:47] a series that we've ministered here or
[44:49] other things but at any rate it it
[44:52] everything that we do should be for the
[44:53] edifying whether it's singing and uh
[44:56] playing and everything anything like
[44:57] that it's for the edifying of the body
[45:00] of Believers and that really is the
[45:02] heart of Christ because remember the
[45:04] whole uh purpose and Redemption was not
[45:07] about self-serving it came in order to
[45:10] minister on our behalf to pay the price
[45:13] for you and I so that same heart of
[45:17] redemption that same part is what
[45:19] actually is to work and operate through
[45:21] every part within the body no matter if
[45:24] it is a gift that is listed here in 1
[45:27] Corinthians 12 or even in 13 it it
[45:30] really doesn't matter if you look and
[45:32] say well I don't know if I can find the
[45:34] the gift or whatever in there but you
[45:35] know there are sometimes where
[45:37] individuals really have a gift to be
[45:39] able to witness and there are times that
[45:41] where that there are things that God
[45:43] will call us to do if I don't mean to
[45:45] take a sidebar but brother Branda would
[45:47] tell us even when he deals with Peter
[45:49] and John and he would deal all of us
[45:51] know that Divine love must is an
[45:54] essential in our life to be expressed
[45:56] but the phet would tell us in the
[45:58] message that John would be called to
[46:00] display that on a level that Peter was
[46:03] not called to so to think that John the
[46:05] Beloved would be called to express love
[46:07] maybe there was other Brethren that
[46:09] maybe they had ministries of Miracles
[46:11] and gift of faith and gift of healing
[46:13] and all those things and John would say
[46:15] what about me and yet what God had
[46:16] called John to do was to be a display of
[46:20] the love of God and then that same thing
[46:23] with Peter and others so sometimes it's
[46:25] you know God doesn't want us try trying
[46:27] to press and try to obtain something
[46:31] whatever he has for us just we want to
[46:33] make ourselves available to him and God
[46:35] will see to it that it comes out in its
[46:37] time because every part is vital in this
[46:40] great
[46:41] Symphony every part is vital whether it
[46:45] whether you you may not even be somebody
[46:47] who's even vocal who even knows you're
[46:49] around you may not be a person who's
[46:51] spitting out quotes and scriptures or
[46:53] whatever more but your love and your
[46:55] fervency your dedication and service to
[46:57] God is a testimony and it's a vital part
[47:01] within the Assembly of God so when we
[47:05] look at this Paul goes on to say
[47:07] Brethren I come to you I if I come unto
[47:10] you speaking with tongues what shall
[47:12] what shall I profit you except I shall
[47:16] speak to you either by Revelation by
[47:19] knowledge by prophesying or by Doctrine
[47:22] so if none of these fit what good would
[47:25] me speaking in Tong Tong if I can come
[47:28] in speaking all these tongues and you're
[47:29] not edified in one of these
[47:32] ways so that's the part that when we
[47:35] walk and we leave from here and you know
[47:38] and sometimes the the the the the the
[47:41] way the gift that God might have and I'm
[47:43] talking about the ministerial gift might
[47:45] be ever so different from maybe what
[47:47] we're used to uh and how that we're
[47:50] looking at things but if we can just say
[47:52] Lord help me just to see you God will
[47:55] speak to our hearts he'll minister to us
[47:57] just according that we have need of and
[48:00] so that's something that even I mean you
[48:02] look look at look at Sunday what look
[48:04] how with brother George brother George
[48:05] was taking it in a manner it was almost
[48:07] like we're sitting around a fire and
[48:09] he's just going through the scriptures
[48:11] in that way why that's brother George's
[48:13] gift if brother George I couldn't speak
[48:15] like brother George brother George
[48:17] couldn't speak like me it's the gift
[48:18] that's in his life and so every man God
[48:21] so fixed that that a man has a way of a
[48:24] certain approach every ministerial gift
[48:26] he has an approach to the word of God
[48:29] and so God does that that's that's the
[48:31] great uh uh uh uh I can't think of the
[48:34] word out of the Ephesians but it it is a
[48:37] diversity it's a that God has among uh
[48:41] the gifts and forgive me the word
[48:43] doesn't come to me right now but it's
[48:44] out of Ephesians 4 but but Paul speaks
[48:46] of that so I want to deal with this a
[48:48] little bit more on the order of
[48:50] spiritual gifts and uh I really want to
[48:53] hone in tonight on a part here when
[48:55] we're looking at interpretation and
[48:58] looking at prophecy and I I'm going to
[49:01] to move into that just a little bit more
[49:03] tonight but then I'm going to move into
[49:04] a different angle of it to show how when
[49:07] the prophet is speaking of things about
[49:09] a direct message and the things that
[49:11] he's saying within that uh because there
[49:14] there is there is another angle to it
[49:16] it's not something that's off but we
[49:18] want to see what the prophet is saying
[49:21] as well as what it says within the
[49:24] scriptures as well so Paul said when
[49:27] he's dealing with you know with tongues
[49:29] he said I think my God I speak with
[49:31] tongues more than you all now Paul was
[49:34] not talking about the different
[49:35] languages he knew he actually spoke in
[49:38] tongues but this would have been in his
[49:40] prayer closet maybe at home or why he's
[49:43] out he so you know this is what he was
[49:45] dealing with and so yet in the church
[49:47] once again I had rather speak five words
[49:50] with my understanding that by my voice I
[49:54] might teach others also than 10,000
[49:57] words in an unknown tongue notice it's
[49:59] about
[50:00] others so it's not about even where Paul
[50:04] was dealing in another place of the
[50:05] scripture how be it Brethren when you
[50:07] come together one has a song one has a
[50:09] this one has a that one has a that I as
[50:11] I said before I do not believe that
[50:13] those those individuals they were doing
[50:15] things to be wrong I believe that they
[50:17] felt like I must do something I I must
[50:19] do something within this service I must
[50:21] do that and because of that because the
[50:24] prophet tells us he he goes very very
[50:26] clear he says You must remember he says
[50:29] when we're looking at things is it the
[50:31] gift or is it the Holy Spirit he said
[50:34] because the gift always wants to work
[50:38] but is it the Holy Spirit
[50:40] leading that
[50:42] gift so it's you see what's happening
[50:45] think about the time we're living in
[50:47] we're living in the adoption of the Sons
[50:50] and Daughters of God the gifts and
[50:52] things returned at isua street but there
[50:54] was a great mixture in there and then
[50:56] you find it traveling over coming to a
[50:59] place to where when the message of the
[51:00] hour strikes and the word begins to come
[51:03] forth now remember for the prophet when
[51:06] he first seen it operating he didn't
[51:07] know what was taking place and then it
[51:09] was really confusing when he saw one man
[51:11] who was genuine and another man who
[51:14] himself as a vessel was false yet it was
[51:17] the genuine Holy Spirit speaking through
[51:19] him giving a genuine interpretation and
[51:22] remember the prophet was he he didn't
[51:25] understand that but you see God revealed
[51:29] that to him out of the book of Hebrews
[51:31] chapter 6 the rain falls on the just and
[51:34] unjust right I mean you don't go out in
[51:36] your garden and say hey weeds don't
[51:37] receive any water just for the
[51:40] flowers all receive it right all receive
[51:44] that and then we come over to Matthew 24
[51:47] false Christ so we have all of these
[51:49] things and God God gave us a word in
[51:52] this hour not when he gave the word it
[51:55] was to bring BR us into rest it was to
[51:58] speak peace to our lives because if God
[52:01] has placed anything in the church we do
[52:04] not have to be scared about it we do not
[52:07] have to be intimidated about it we don't
[52:09] even have to lock it up we just need the
[52:12] order of the Holy Spirit by the word to
[52:15] put it in the order that he gave it and
[52:17] when it's like that then we can rest we
[52:19] can have peace and we can look to God so
[52:22] remember one word that the prophet will
[52:24] use over and over with among the
[52:27] Pentecostal people and with the gifts he
[52:29] says You must reverence those
[52:33] gifts and he says in another place he
[52:35] says I believe it's in the message of
[52:37] all things he said you have taken
[52:39] genuine articles of God and made a
[52:42] tradition out of it how did they do that
[52:45] you think how can you make a tradition
[52:48] out of speaking in tongues out of
[52:49] interpretation out of all these other
[52:51] things because when it becomes a
[52:54] necessity of having to be done
[52:57] when the prophet said that every one of
[52:58] these nine spiritual gifts are in every
[53:01] local assembly yet yet the only one that
[53:05] as far as you know in in in where we're
[53:08] at that you would see or hear would be
[53:10] of tongues and prophecy and yet like the
[53:13] gift of faith when Brothers have come I
[53:15] think like brother Daryl Ward other
[53:17] brothers that that have such a gift of
[53:19] faith I think like brother Ron Spencer
[53:20] when I mean God is that their Ministries
[53:23] nobody else you can't parallel that and
[53:24] say well I'm going to be like brother r
[53:26] or I'm going to be like brother no no
[53:28] they God God put gift in their
[53:31] life and they're so geared in a way that
[53:33] you can say well I I want I want brother
[53:35] Ron's I'm just pick on him but but you
[53:37] know just to say well I want brother Ron
[53:39] to preach like brother Tim or or or he
[53:42] would preach like brother Harold
[53:43] hildbrand he's not that man but God has
[53:45] put a gift in his life that's right are
[53:48] you with me I'm not elevating I'm just
[53:50] trying to say you know those of you that
[53:51] youve heard brother Ron it really is a
[53:53] word that's building faith
[53:57] is that right you've catched that so
[53:59] sometimes there's there's things I'm not
[54:00] elevating any man I'm just trying to get
[54:02] you to see that these gifts they are
[54:04] also they're working in many different
[54:06] ways through the
[54:07] body like that gift of healing for the
[54:10] young for the mother who was setting
[54:12] behind that one that had the baby and it
[54:15] was pressed on her heart go pray go pray
[54:17] for him she no no no I'm not going to go
[54:18] I'm not going to go and finally she just
[54:20] got him ask the mother she said if you
[54:21] don't mind I got to get this off my
[54:23] heart would you mind if I pray for your
[54:24] baby and and she said after I pray for
[54:26] him I want you to keep your prayer card
[54:28] and I want you to go on up there in line
[54:30] but can I do you mind if I get this off
[54:31] my heart she said sir go ahead and she
[54:33] prayed for and when when the mother came
[54:36] up with the child that night in the
[54:37] prayer line the Holy Spirit called it
[54:40] out and said ma'am your your baby was
[54:42] suffering with this and this but it was
[54:43] healed before the service when that
[54:45] mother prayed for your baby and brother
[54:48] brandom Ties That in see nobody would
[54:50] have known that nobody would have known
[54:52] that it was something that was just
[54:54] taking place throughout the body yes
[54:57] [Music]
[54:58] right and I always I've always admired
[55:01] this part of the quote too I've always
[55:03] admired the humility to where that lady
[55:05] she said now you going on up in the
[55:07] prayer line and you let brother Brandon
[55:08] pray for him she never said bless God
[55:11] I've got the thus sayith the Lord the
[55:12] word of the Lord I it would to those are
[55:15] little things like that that just stands
[55:17] out to me that always has over the years
[55:19] just watching the the approach the
[55:20] humility within that but see we would
[55:23] have you nobody would have ever known
[55:25] that and and and like the prophet said
[55:27] he said God he said that mother would
[55:29] have more compassion being a mother than
[55:32] what I would even have in my prayer so
[55:35] so you know this is why remember always
[55:37] Lord I'm always I want to be available
[55:39] to
[55:40] you and so that's where the availability
[55:43] how do I stay available just keep things
[55:45] out of your life sure we're going to
[55:47] have offenses come we're going to have
[55:48] things that come our way we're going to
[55:49] have misund under we're going to have
[55:51] that we're going to disappoint things
[55:52] are going to happen but listen this the
[55:54] whole thing is Lord don't let me become
[55:58] clogged up let me be free at any time
[56:02] that you can use me that's how we want
[56:04] to live is that right we want to live in
[56:07] that way so notice Paul you know he's
[56:09] placing the proper usage of tongues and
[56:11] I want to just drop this in here a
[56:13] little bit he says in verse 13 let him
[56:15] that prayeth in an unknown tongue pray
[56:19] that he may interpret so if he's
[56:22] speaking in an unknown tongue uh Paul
[56:24] said pray that he may interpret why
[56:26] because if he's speaking in an unknown
[56:28] tongue now I want you to listen very
[56:29] carefully to where that it
[56:32] raises to be heard and
[56:35] known pray that he may
[56:38] interpret are you with me let me go to
[56:40] another scripture here in in verse 27
[56:43] and 28 and hopefully this will give some
[56:45] understanding with things if any man
[56:47] speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by
[56:48] two or three and that by course and let
[56:51] one interpret that's out in the
[56:54] congregation okay but if there be no
[56:57] interpreter let him keep silence in the
[56:59] church and let him speak to himself and
[57:02] to God now notice let him keep silent in
[57:05] the church now though you've heard it on
[57:07] tape you've heard it here youve heard
[57:09] where it
[57:10] raises and it's to be heard and yet
[57:14] there's there's a there's a pastor right
[57:15] now that I could call out and I've been
[57:17] to minister and to preach and if you get
[57:19] close and here he is he set right on the
[57:21] end of the Pew and I tell you what he
[57:22] gets to enjoy in the word so well you
[57:24] don't hear it but I can look over and
[57:25] you can to see here he is there's
[57:27] tongues that's coming out but you don't
[57:29] hear it as far as like where it's you
[57:31] understand what I'm saying where it's
[57:32] taking over that's why like in a service
[57:35] in a meeting the glory of God can fall
[57:37] but it will not be where where you know
[57:40] where just tongues are in such a loud
[57:42] place like that there can be that part
[57:44] where this little one this little here
[57:46] this little over there because that that
[57:48] can happen in that way so that's what
[57:50] Paul is talking about when he's saying
[57:52] keep silence in the church in other
[57:54] words it's not raising to the volume
[57:56] where everything shuts down right and
[57:59] we're listening for
[58:01] it that's
[58:04] good
[58:05] so here we come into tongues and
[58:09] interpretations and I want to just say
[58:11] it in this way this is not I love how
[58:13] the prophet lays this out it's not a
[58:15] person's thoughts I want you to listen
[58:17] to me very carefully it's not an
[58:22] impression it's not even a
[58:24] feeling it's not even a person that
[58:27] maybe they're observing something in the
[58:30] assembly and they think oh man and they
[58:33] just get so burdened and all of a sudden
[58:34] it just no that's
[58:38] flesh that's
[58:41] carnal you you I hope you understand let
[58:43] me just let me bring it to the other
[58:44] side on the ministering side brother
[58:46] Bram will say where he sees he said the
[58:48] ministers they they see the weak places
[58:50] and they begin in study on there but do
[58:52] you realize that even as a minister
[58:54] there are things that as the pastor here
[58:56] that it's not just looking at things and
[58:58] all of a sudden I'm trying to correct
[58:59] everything from the platform I can I can
[59:02] only go as God is bringing things by
[59:04] inspiration there has been many times
[59:06] where things that even at times where
[59:08] I've studied out and I've shared this
[59:10] with you at times and all of a
[59:12] sudden I I just can't feel the the
[59:14] leeway to bring maybe we're right in the
[59:16] middle of a series I can't even feel the
[59:18] leeway to bring it I'm thinking here it
[59:20] is 400 p.m. I mean I was I was you know
[59:22] I was everything was just I was just
[59:24] building up and everything and all of a
[59:25] sudden God changes
[59:28] things why it's because of the
[59:30] needs it's the needs but it's not about
[59:33] oh we need to do this and we need to
[59:35] correct that when in that way that would
[59:37] be very in for even a minister that's a
[59:40] fleshly way that's good
[59:45] right I never forget my father-in-law he
[59:48] tells me a story that uh there was a man
[59:51] that was down there he came in a
[59:53] minister and he came in he was preaching
[59:55] to brother mccormix in Mansfield man he
[59:57] was just preaching and all of a
[59:59] sudden brother brother McCormick got up
[1:00:02] after me he said brother the brother sat
[1:00:04] down he said I know whose house she was
[1:00:06] at
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:09] yesterday see that one discernment of
[1:00:11] the Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit he was at somebody's house in the
[1:00:15] congregation and so he was just going
[1:00:18] [Laughter]
[1:00:22] to God bless brother McCormick
[1:00:27] but it's true you know sometimes there's
[1:00:29] things that got to be said like that
[1:00:30] that it'll set the Sheep at ease right
[1:00:34] because how many how many times we've
[1:00:35] come in here whether it be with a guest
[1:00:37] minister or maybe in you're in another
[1:00:39] uh a special meeting somewhere but or or
[1:00:41] God will bring in a minister or maybe
[1:00:43] it's right here right right right
[1:00:44] through this channel right here and
[1:00:46] there's things you're sitting there and
[1:00:47] you're like dear Lord he doesn't even
[1:00:48] know the conversation he doesn't even
[1:00:50] know this and is right I don't know it
[1:00:52] but God knows it or whoever the vessel
[1:00:55] that God would use it's God Discerning
[1:00:57] and God declaring himself to you or I
[1:01:00] yes
[1:01:02] sir Now watch how this with tongue's
[1:01:05] interpretation so it's it's God's
[1:01:06] thoughts brother brah says a word is a
[1:01:09] thought expressed first it must be a
[1:01:11] thought and then it becomes a word
[1:01:12] because you do not speak your words
[1:01:14] without a thought when we speak in
[1:01:17] tongues we have no thought it's God
[1:01:20] taking the thoughts it's God's thought
[1:01:22] using our lips we don't think or know
[1:01:26] what you're saying when you're speaking
[1:01:28] in tongues if it's inspired
[1:01:32] speaking when you interpret you don't
[1:01:35] know what you're saying you just say it
[1:01:36] now let me I'm going to work with this a
[1:01:38] little bit that's all that's God and
[1:01:41] prophesying you're not using your own
[1:01:43] thoughts it's because it's God you you
[1:01:46] say things that you ordinarily wouldn't
[1:01:49] think about
[1:01:50] saying so when you look at this with
[1:01:53] with interpreting and I think this is a
[1:01:55] a very key thing to point out uh
[1:01:57] interpreting if you look at the bottom
[1:01:59] part it's to unfold the meaning of what
[1:02:01] is said to explain or to expound upon
[1:02:06] something to ex to unfold what is being
[1:02:08] said now how does that interpretation
[1:02:12] come now well it comes it comes by
[1:02:15] divine inspiration because whether it's
[1:02:17] the same individual who speaking in
[1:02:20] tongues that then it changes over to
[1:02:22] interpretation or there is
[1:02:24] interpretation that gift that Spirit
[1:02:27] working in conjunction with that of the
[1:02:29] tongues and the prophet would say it
[1:02:31] over and over he's he says he tells us
[1:02:34] what's the rise and fall here and it
[1:02:36] must match the rise and fall here so in
[1:02:39] other words it cannot be a message this
[1:02:41] long in tongues and the interpretation
[1:02:44] is this long something's wrong and then
[1:02:47] he's talking about even the rise and the
[1:02:49] fall he said in the nouns and the
[1:02:50] pronouns and and all those other things
[1:02:53] and that that to me is beyond my pay
[1:02:55] grade when you get to looking at
[1:03:00] languages but you know how does
[1:03:02] interpretation come I think this is I so
[1:03:05] thank God for the message of the hour
[1:03:07] because you know what the message of the
[1:03:08] hour did the revealed word it it it
[1:03:11] brings back it brings it back to the
[1:03:12] written word right to where the word of
[1:03:15] God is the absolute of the believer amen
[1:03:17] amen so notice he said and God being
[1:03:20] misunderstood if you haven't listened to
[1:03:21] this message in a while questions and
[1:03:23] answers God being misunderstood man it's
[1:03:25] really good within these things that
[1:03:27] we're covering brother B says in the
[1:03:29] interpretation of tongues many people
[1:03:31] interpret tongues by an extraordinary
[1:03:34] expression of them feeling to say such a
[1:03:37] thing that's not
[1:03:40] interpretation so notice catch what he's
[1:03:42] divining that out the there see said
[1:03:45] many interpret based on what they're
[1:03:46] feeling that's an extraordinary
[1:03:48] expression that's not
[1:03:50] interpretation interpretation is when
[1:03:53] you are speaking in an unknown tongue
[1:03:55] you are hearing them in English or
[1:03:58] whatever your native language is I know
[1:04:01] some of you speak both but you know
[1:04:03] however God will work with that and just
[1:04:05] repeating over what they're saying so
[1:04:07] you're hearing it in the person who's
[1:04:10] doing the interpreting is actually
[1:04:12] hearing it being spoken in their own
[1:04:16] native
[1:04:17] language so let's say for example it
[1:04:19] might be you know brother Aaron he's
[1:04:21] speaking in Africans and the spirit of
[1:04:24] God Falls and he's speaking in in
[1:04:26] Africans I don't know
[1:04:29] africant but the spirit of God the same
[1:04:32] Spirit of inspiration that would cause
[1:04:34] him to speak in an unknown another
[1:04:38] tongue is the same holy spirit that
[1:04:40] would help me and give me the
[1:04:43] understanding of what's being said in
[1:04:46] English yes sir so you see it's not oh I
[1:04:49] don't know africon that's not what it is
[1:04:51] that's not what interpretation is that
[1:04:53] and brother Ram goes into that here in
[1:04:54] this message question question and
[1:04:56] answers God being misunderstood it's not
[1:04:58] like when Brother Carlos stands up here
[1:05:00] when we did that funeral here for his
[1:05:02] father-in-law he heard me in English He
[1:05:04] interpreted to them in Spanish he heard
[1:05:06] me in English He interpreted Spanish
[1:05:08] because he knows English and he knows
[1:05:10] Spanish that's not what it is it's there
[1:05:13] is a tongue that's going out and then
[1:05:15] the person in whom the inspiration of
[1:05:17] interpretation falls on hears it in
[1:05:21] their native language
[1:05:25] and I'm G to show you we good some
[1:05:27] scriptures here in just a moment this is
[1:05:29] why brother Ram says I do not believe
[1:05:31] that The Interpreter is interpreting the
[1:05:34] language of the person I do not believe
[1:05:36] that I believe that the spirit is
[1:05:38] present and The Interpreter is
[1:05:40] prophesying and he goes on to say he
[1:05:42] says now he says and if you are speaking
[1:05:45] in an unknown tongue and interpreting
[1:05:47] you are hearing in the language that you
[1:05:50] were born in because that's the only way
[1:05:52] you can interpret what what what they're
[1:05:54] saying the Holy Spirit has interpreted
[1:05:57] it to you and you're just speaking for
[1:06:00] the holy spirit so once again it's like
[1:06:03] if if you know if uh if if brother
[1:06:06] brother Aaron maybe brother Aaron is
[1:06:08] speaking in French I don't know
[1:06:10] French but if he's but the Holy Spirit
[1:06:13] here drops and there is now a tongues
[1:06:16] that goes forth how am I going to hear
[1:06:18] it I don't I don't understand French if
[1:06:20] God if that Spirit of interpretation
[1:06:21] Falls On Me Maybe it falls on Brother
[1:06:23] Richard he's going to hear it in his
[1:06:26] native
[1:06:29] language that's right right that that's
[1:06:31] that that's scripture now let's look at
[1:06:32] a few scriptures here acts 2:4 remember
[1:06:34] brother brandham if you listen to the
[1:06:36] message debate on tongues brother Bram
[1:06:38] goes right into this he says and how
[1:06:40] they came out the Bible says coming out
[1:06:41] of the upper room they were all filled
[1:06:43] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:06:45] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:06:48] them utterance see this is why that
[1:06:50] remember the Pentecostals like to go and
[1:06:52] say well the evidence is is speaking in
[1:06:55] tongues but it's unknown tongues well
[1:06:56] that's not the scripture everybody
[1:06:59] understood what they were saying there
[1:07:00] was a
[1:07:01] message are you hearing me there was a
[1:07:03] message and that message was of the
[1:07:05] resurrection and the atonement what has
[1:07:08] been promised has
[1:07:10] come and you know what it didn't call
[1:07:12] out any names but it hit the target and
[1:07:16] hearts were pricked they knew who they
[1:07:20] were that's the kind of direct message
[1:07:22] I'm going to talk about tonight they
[1:07:24] knew their names were not called out of
[1:07:26] that multitude but they knew who who was
[1:07:29] they knew they were being spoken to out
[1:07:31] of a whole multitude it was as though
[1:07:33] their name was being called because
[1:07:35] their heart was being convicted that's
[1:07:38] so good that's so good so that's one of
[1:07:40] the ways with direct message I want to
[1:07:41] deal with tonight here a little bit
[1:07:43] notice acts 278 and they were all amazed
[1:07:46] and marveled saying one to another
[1:07:48] behold are not all these which speak
[1:07:51] galileans and how hear we every man in
[1:07:55] our own tongue wherein we were born
[1:07:59] isn't God
[1:08:01] marvelous this Feast remember brother
[1:08:03] George was kind of going into this the
[1:08:04] other day the Feast of Pentecost because
[1:08:07] three times a year all the males were to
[1:08:10] appear before the Lord and how God had
[1:08:13] it so fixed to where they would be
[1:08:16] gathered from other countries you know
[1:08:18] why because they needed to hear this
[1:08:20] message and take it back to their
[1:08:23] countries
[1:08:25] that's why brother Ram says when Phillip
[1:08:27] went to the unic the unic he said had
[1:08:29] been there at Pentecost and was on his
[1:08:32] way back and that's why he was asking
[1:08:34] the questions he was
[1:08:35] asking so good oh my so good hallelujah
[1:08:40] oh brother and sister what a privileged
[1:08:42] people we are I say thank you God for
[1:08:45] your mercy amen amen so interpretation
[1:08:49] is is prophecy we can go into you know
[1:08:52] in cornelius's house the same thing and
[1:08:54] so prophecy itself let me just read that
[1:08:57] uh capitalized portion it is a discourse
[1:09:00] emanating from divine inspiration and
[1:09:04] declaring the purposes of God now watch
[1:09:06] this whether by reproving admonishing
[1:09:09] the wicked or comforting The Afflicted
[1:09:13] or revealing things hidden so there's
[1:09:17] one part of it that deals with
[1:09:21] uncovering hindrances in a person's life
[1:09:25] what might be hindering them from
[1:09:26] obtaining their healing you see that
[1:09:29] example I gave you of that Sunday school
[1:09:31] teacher where she had that hidden in her
[1:09:33] subconscious of an act that she had
[1:09:35] committed while her husband was away she
[1:09:38] was so anxious so tense and and she had
[1:09:40] been asking God Lord forgive me she
[1:09:42] repented but brother Bram tell said you
[1:09:44] didn't sin against God you sinned
[1:09:46] against your marriage vow and once that
[1:09:48] was broken and this is just a little
[1:09:50] Sidetrack you know her husband was the
[1:09:52] Deacon and at the church down there and
[1:09:53] brother BR said well no wonder what's
[1:09:55] wrong with brother Johnson's Church down
[1:09:56] there and the man came in and he said
[1:09:58] I'm going to resign brother said oh no
[1:10:00] no no no no you you you all don't have
[1:10:01] to do that get right with God and then
[1:10:03] go on and serve God see see sometimes
[1:10:07] you understand what I'm saying sometimes
[1:10:08] the focus becomes uh just like of the
[1:10:10] resigning and I'm not saying there
[1:10:11] aren't there aren't times for things to
[1:10:14] step aside that to me is just a part in
[1:10:16] humility is that okay that's just a part
[1:10:18] in humility it would be like you know
[1:10:20] somebody singing specials and things
[1:10:22] like that and all of a sudden you know
[1:10:23] they get caught up in the world and
[1:10:25] other things like that I think it would
[1:10:26] show humility and fruits and build back
[1:10:29] confidence for them just to sit down for
[1:10:31] a
[1:10:32] while whether it's Ministry and on and
[1:10:34] on why that's
[1:10:36] humility so so what the prophet is
[1:10:38] dealing with right there is he the the
[1:10:41] main thing is about let's not focus on
[1:10:43] the wrong things it's just like a person
[1:10:45] said I got to get this music out of my
[1:10:47] room I got to get this you're focusing
[1:10:49] on the wrong thing say God get it out of
[1:10:51] my heart amen get it out of my heart
[1:10:54] amen see it's got to focus on the heart
[1:10:56] the devil is always there to try to
[1:10:59] point our attention in so many other
[1:11:01] ways why he's a deceiver he's settle he
[1:11:04] does not want to be uncovered but when
[1:11:06] we can look at it and say God I want to
[1:11:08] really deal with the source of the issue
[1:11:12] then the Holy Spirit can come and move
[1:11:13] down on our behalf the Lord oh my now
[1:11:17] notice this is where the scripture let
[1:11:20] me I want to read this just for our
[1:11:22] background we've we've read read this
[1:11:23] many times and brother br says how that
[1:11:26] or this Paul says therefore the whole
[1:11:28] church be come together into one place
[1:11:30] all speak with tongues there come in
[1:11:32] those that are unlearned unbelievers
[1:11:34] they will say you're on mad so if
[1:11:36] there's just speaking in tongues and
[1:11:38] people just going around people say what
[1:11:40] is
[1:11:41] this right and and the the the the very
[1:11:44] serious thing about that and this is why
[1:11:46] one of the times this is why one of the
[1:11:48] burdens that the prophet it never
[1:11:50] happened again in the Tabernacle but his
[1:11:52] desire was was to get the gifts into a
[1:11:55] room once they had accumulated and come
[1:11:58] to a place it never it never came back
[1:11:59] to to a fruition in that way but the
[1:12:03] reason that he even in doing that is
[1:12:05] because he said the unlearned are among
[1:12:08] us and he was seeing things where people
[1:12:10] would be chewing gum he was seeing
[1:12:12] things where people wouldn't bow their
[1:12:14] head where people and he was so what it
[1:12:16] was it was a concern for those people
[1:12:19] let me just say this while we're on a
[1:12:21] side note there's many times if there's
[1:12:23] a real uh and not every need is
[1:12:25] important but sometimes if there's a
[1:12:27] real serious need this would have
[1:12:28] behooved to every for parents for for
[1:12:31] young people for all of us is not a time
[1:12:34] to be looking around there are spirits
[1:12:37] that are being dealt with that's right
[1:12:40] it's a time to Bow our heads in prayer
[1:12:42] and if it's called hey let's bow our
[1:12:43] heads in prayer here's here's a need
[1:12:45] that's right here you don't have to know
[1:12:47] what the need is many times those needs
[1:12:49] are so serious but if that's a time when
[1:12:51] those happen that's a time that we don't
[1:12:53] want to be we don't want to be irest
[1:12:55] towards things we want to enter right in
[1:12:56] and pray alongside with so that goes
[1:12:59] right along with this as
[1:13:02] well Lord but if all prophesy and there
[1:13:05] come in one that believeth not or one
[1:13:07] unlearned so if there's a prophecy he is
[1:13:10] convinced of all he's judged of all that
[1:13:14] word judge is like a forensic
[1:13:16] sight right right and what's a forensic
[1:13:20] like they have the forensic psychologist
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:25] whe what a
[1:13:26] job I mean to go look at a crime scene
[1:13:29] and they have to be able to the bullets
[1:13:31] there the gloves there and they're
[1:13:34] looking at this they're looking at that
[1:13:35] what are they trying to do they're
[1:13:36] trying to piece together the evidence
[1:13:40] and that's what Paul the word that's
[1:13:42] used judged it's like a forensic it's
[1:13:44] like a investigating where the spirit of
[1:13:46] God has come down for what purpose not
[1:13:50] embarrassment are are you hearing me
[1:13:52] it's not embarrassment it's a about
[1:13:55] there's a
[1:13:56] need brother BR says maybe they come up
[1:13:59] for prayer and there's something and
[1:14:00] saying brother do you believe in Divine
[1:14:01] Healing I do I do believe in Divine
[1:14:03] Healing brother what you know is there
[1:14:05] anything that's wrong I don't know and
[1:14:06] so the brothers come up and maybe one
[1:14:08] that has a you know they're praying and
[1:14:10] brother BR says the how God will work to
[1:14:12] bring that release in that person's life
[1:14:14] because let me just say this to you the
[1:14:16] holy spirit will never bless over
[1:14:18] unconfessed
[1:14:19] sin it's got to be according to the
[1:14:22] correct Channel that's why the prophet
[1:14:24] would tell us he he cares do you care
[1:14:27] and throughout the message the comfort
[1:14:28] and other places he said we know what
[1:14:30] the Cure is but we got to find the cause
[1:14:34] so good if you don't find the
[1:14:37] cause it won't do no
[1:14:39] good right and we we've been through
[1:14:42] some of those things with that I I want
[1:14:43] to keep moving into this thought here
[1:14:45] watch how watch this he is convinced of
[1:14:47] all he's judged of all and thus are the
[1:14:49] secrets of his heart made manifest so
[1:14:52] falling down on his face he will worship
[1:14:53] God and Report that God is in you of a
[1:14:56] truth that's what a Believer will do
[1:14:58] maybe they walk in unlearned but here
[1:15:01] God speaks to their heart and right
[1:15:02] there they they'll respond to it but
[1:15:05] someone else could say I don't not me
[1:15:08] I'm not it well we can't we can't do
[1:15:11] anything about that they they go on
[1:15:13] brother BR says if you speak with
[1:15:15] tongues in the adoption series it can't
[1:15:17] be just some repeating of scripture cuz
[1:15:19] God said don't use vain repetition it's
[1:15:22] a message directly to somebody
[1:15:25] Now watch how he PR pairs this with
[1:15:27] prophecy ask me one time put your finger
[1:15:30] on one time that the Holy Spirit ever
[1:15:33] under the discernment he's talking about
[1:15:35] on the platform told somebody repeated a
[1:15:38] scripture over and over you see what
[1:15:40] he's doing he's paralleling it as the
[1:15:44] same now now remember the same thing
[1:15:47] that was taking place here through the
[1:15:50] prophet's Ministry was not a gift of
[1:15:53] Prophecy yet it was the Same Spirit of
[1:15:56] Prophecy but it was through a
[1:15:58] Prophet this that we're speaking of one
[1:16:00] of the nine spiritual gifts is the gift
[1:16:02] of Prophecy and the prophet would go
[1:16:05] over and over all the way through the
[1:16:06] message and says no one judges a prophet
[1:16:10] but a
[1:16:11] prophecy that is given must be
[1:16:16] judged that's why all all the way all
[1:16:18] the way through the message Rapture all
[1:16:20] all the way down through he's constantly
[1:16:21] he's dividing that out between a gift of
[1:16:24] Prophecy yet it's the same Spirit
[1:16:28] working to uncover to make known hidden
[1:16:31] things to help to minister right
[1:16:35] remember the lady who was had her heart
[1:16:37] was all worked up it was affecting
[1:16:39] things in her church deep called to deep
[1:16:41] remember she comes up there and my heart
[1:16:42] always goes to that
[1:16:44] lady she stands right there she's you
[1:16:47] could just you could just sense she's
[1:16:48] tore up and the Holy Spirit comes and he
[1:16:51] reveals to her oh he says that there was
[1:16:53] a man who professed divine healing and
[1:16:55] and he said you was a witch and he did
[1:16:58] he said sister that's nothing but a lie
[1:17:01] that that whole that whole lie has got
[1:17:02] your your heart all worked up right
[1:17:04] there what was it that was not something
[1:17:07] uncovering something hidden in her life
[1:17:10] it was the Comfort to The
[1:17:13] Afflicted Hallelujah so prophecy is also
[1:17:16] Comfort to The Afflicted to dispel
[1:17:20] doubts let me tell you something he
[1:17:23] works even while the word is being
[1:17:25] preached Spirits are broken hearts are
[1:17:28] deserted because it is the holy spirit
[1:17:30] that is among
[1:17:32] us we have been taught as children of
[1:17:35] God that I don't have to wait to a
[1:17:37] certain time of a service to get my
[1:17:40] answer God knows my need it might come
[1:17:43] through a song special it might come
[1:17:45] while worships going on it might come
[1:17:48] right while the preaching of the word it
[1:17:50] might come at the end but God has my
[1:17:52] answer amen hallelujah
[1:17:56] Hallelujah the days of teing are over
[1:18:02] Hallelujah watch brother R says notice
[1:18:05] he said it always told him something
[1:18:06] that was wrong with them something they
[1:18:07] had done something they must do and
[1:18:09] something had happened or something like
[1:18:11] that so is speaking in
[1:18:15] tongues and
[1:18:17] interpretation and he gives an example
[1:18:19] let brother Neville raise up and another
[1:18:21] brother give interpretation tell this
[1:18:23] man yesterday he went out there done
[1:18:24] something wrong you done the doctor told
[1:18:26] him today he had cancer go make that
[1:18:28] thing right come back here and get right
[1:18:29] with
[1:18:30] God see that's that's one
[1:18:33] angle and watch
[1:18:35] this Gabriel's instructions to Daniel
[1:18:39] brother brandom will you have any more
[1:18:41] healing services in the Tabernacle with
[1:18:43] discernments no no 1961 the discernments
[1:18:47] will be given by our other board we have
[1:18:51] brother Neville here now who has a gift
[1:18:53] of Prophecy that prophesies over the
[1:18:55] sick and makes known to them the things
[1:18:58] that they have need of knowing right wow
[1:19:01] I go into this in a different service
[1:19:03] but that was happening right at the
[1:19:04] altar but it got to be to a place that
[1:19:07] people were so depending on wanting and
[1:19:09] and they were pulling things out of
[1:19:11] brother Neville to where brother
[1:19:12] brandham had to go to him because the
[1:19:14] people said hey there's things being
[1:19:15] spoken that's not happening and brother
[1:19:18] Bram had to correcting brother B tells
[1:19:19] it very plainly here but see that's now
[1:19:22] that was happening that's not out there
[1:19:24] that's also prophecy it can be right
[1:19:25] there in a prayer line and you know what
[1:19:27] that's judged right away if a person
[1:19:29] says that ain't
[1:19:32] me that's good then you know what the
[1:19:35] right thing to say for the person doing
[1:19:37] it believe me I know would be to say God
[1:19:41] forgive me instead of saying no you know
[1:19:43] you had
[1:19:45] it I'll leave that alone but see there's
[1:19:48] things right now that when we're
[1:19:50] standing in the midst of these things
[1:19:51] right here you see just because
[1:19:53] something this is where one of the nine
[1:19:55] spiritual gifts I don't care if it's hit
[1:19:57] every time in the past 10 out of 10 if
[1:20:00] it's a gift of Prophecy it's got to be
[1:20:01] judged every single time that's good you
[1:20:05] understand we're not going on a track
[1:20:06] record we're going on at that particular
[1:20:08] time and if somebody comes through the
[1:20:09] line and says no that ain't
[1:20:12] me that ain't me oh there's things I
[1:20:15] could tell you about
[1:20:17] it notice brother bam says concerning
[1:20:20] brother Neville did I read the rest of
[1:20:22] that oh yeah I did what a relief that is
[1:20:25] for me at home look brother brandom
[1:20:28] coming home he's like what a relief this
[1:20:29] is Brother Neville has this gift what a
[1:20:31] relief it is for me at home why is it a
[1:20:34] relief for you at home brother because I
[1:20:35] can
[1:20:36] rest that discernment on the prophetic
[1:20:39] side just tears me down and God has sent
[1:20:42] me some relief for that through prophecy
[1:20:47] speaking in tongues interpretation which
[1:20:49] is prophecy which prophecy is to speak
[1:20:51] in tongues so he so notice God sent me
[1:20:55] some
[1:20:56] relief and the prophet was thankful what
[1:20:59] he saw that man this is because it's in
[1:21:02] the same messages where he's saying oh
[1:21:03] he said we're beginning to see things
[1:21:05] just hitting right on the line you know
[1:21:06] Out Among the congregation oh as the
[1:21:08] gifts keep accumulating then we want to
[1:21:10] come here to a place and really set them
[1:21:12] even further in order now let's look at
[1:21:15] this part because this is where we even
[1:21:17] as assembly because like I said uh if if
[1:21:20] you don't have it depends on you know if
[1:21:23] it gets to a place to where we have a a
[1:21:26] real collection of gifts and and we see
[1:21:28] how things how things are uh within it
[1:21:31] then that's when you know if God uh
[1:21:34] directs us to make that change because I
[1:21:35] believe the prophet he had wisdom in
[1:21:38] what he was speaking about wanting to
[1:21:39] put it in a room but let me just say
[1:21:41] this to you I'm not anxious about
[1:21:43] putting it in a room that doesn't mean
[1:21:44] that I'm against the room right because
[1:21:47] I've heard some kind of some snide
[1:21:50] comments about those things which I I
[1:21:52] really don't think should be made but I
[1:21:54] look at it in this way is that these are
[1:21:56] things that you know what if God if that
[1:21:58] God God will take us to where we need to
[1:22:00] be and he'll give us the unction at the
[1:22:02] right time that is so good so you know
[1:22:05] because everything it we stand up on the
[1:22:07] word God will give the unction we need
[1:22:09] at the time it's rest so notice when we
[1:22:12] noticed in the after service which is
[1:22:14] the after the ministering of the word
[1:22:16] even even at times after the altar call
[1:22:19] if an alter call has been given or thing
[1:22:20] and then the Holy Spirit and brother
[1:22:22] Brown would commend different ones on
[1:22:24] how that everything was so uh done so
[1:22:26] orderly and you remember the scripture
[1:22:28] said the spirit of the prophets is
[1:22:30] subject to the prophets and the prophet
[1:22:32] said after the service was over and the
[1:22:33] blessing of God would come down upon the
[1:22:35] congregation then they would begin to
[1:22:37] speak then they begin to magnify God and
[1:22:39] every time it was a direct message to
[1:22:42] somebody now now watch this that direct
[1:22:44] message he said you have to watch it it
[1:22:45] just isn't something fleshly it'll be a
[1:22:48] message to somebody for somebody to do
[1:22:51] something or something to edify the
[1:22:54] Church it'll be something to glorify the
[1:22:57] church so it's not vain repetition but
[1:23:00] it is a message either to directly to
[1:23:03] someone maybe uh don't go to the job
[1:23:06] tomorrow and this and this and that and
[1:23:07] that's it's you know it's got to be
[1:23:10] judged uh or you know uh something comes
[1:23:15] and it's you know a person it's
[1:23:16] uncovering something there in their life
[1:23:18] well I'll tell you that's judged right
[1:23:19] there you know what I mean you you know
[1:23:21] that's judged right there the person
[1:23:23] knows whether or not they have anything
[1:23:24] in their life you see you see what I'm
[1:23:26] saying that's why the things like when
[1:23:28] brother BR was pointing and hopefully I
[1:23:29] can get to that not tonight but you know
[1:23:31] even as it's coming through when God was
[1:23:33] using Brother Neville right there in the
[1:23:34] Tabernacle for those things and uh just
[1:23:38] to look at it in this way it'll be
[1:23:40] something to edify the church or to
[1:23:42] glorify the church so this is another
[1:23:44] angle of Prophecy and when I say another
[1:23:46] angle I'm not talking about another
[1:23:49] another teaching I'm talking about
[1:23:51] another side of it because it's not just
[1:23:53] the side of judging convicting there is
[1:23:57] a part that was within that but brother
[1:23:59] Bram goes into this and the scripture
[1:24:01] says here in verse 31 for all may
[1:24:05] prophesy one for one by one that all may
[1:24:07] learn and may be comforted the prophet
[1:24:11] said it's got to be exact not some
[1:24:14] repeating Jesus said don't use vain
[1:24:15] repetitions watch this words it's got to
[1:24:18] be something directly to somebody or to
[1:24:22] help the church or or to help the
[1:24:28] cause so sometimes and you see in just a
[1:24:31] few of the places that I'll get to
[1:24:32] tonight when the Holy Spirit brother
[1:24:35] Bram is going in maybe I'll just go and
[1:24:36] refer to the one one of the places uh in
[1:24:39] questions and answers on the Holy Ghost
[1:24:41] the prophet refers back to the previous
[1:24:43] night which um that tape they don't have
[1:24:47] uh you know on an Evidence they don't
[1:24:49] have that tape that recording it's only
[1:24:51] what is the Holy Ghost what's it given
[1:24:52] for and then it goes into question
[1:24:54] answers but the prophet refers back to
[1:24:56] that in that statement and questions and
[1:24:59] answers on the Holy Ghost and he's
[1:25:00] talking about how that you know if I was
[1:25:03] able to be here Pastor long enough and
[1:25:06] stay around here and not have to travel
[1:25:07] this is how I'd set the church in order
[1:25:09] and he's talking about getting the gifts
[1:25:10] to meet before service and all these
[1:25:12] things that he's talking about and then
[1:25:14] he goes in and references to the people
[1:25:17] what took place just the previous night
[1:25:21] am I going too quick everybody with me
[1:25:23] he refer first what was going on the
[1:25:25] previous night he says if you'll notice
[1:25:27] those they said those uh two confirming
[1:25:31] things that happened in the meeting he
[1:25:33] said the tongues and the prophecy was
[1:25:35] given and he said and notice how the one
[1:25:37] when is speaking out blessed is he that
[1:25:40] cometh in the name of the Lord and he
[1:25:42] said at that time he said it caught me
[1:25:45] and I said in other words blessed is he
[1:25:48] that has come in
[1:25:51] this and brother Bram said as soon as
[1:25:53] that was said and open he said if you
[1:25:56] remember the Holy Spirit fell in the
[1:25:58] building and he said the reason what was
[1:26:00] happening is Satan was sitting on
[1:26:03] people's shoulders and the devil was
[1:26:05] telling them you don't have to receive
[1:26:07] the Holy Ghost now you don't need to
[1:26:08] have it right now you don't need to do
[1:26:10] it right now he said but the Holy Spirit
[1:26:12] came back around in Vindication to the
[1:26:16] message and brother brandom listen now
[1:26:18] listen I'm just going to drop this in
[1:26:19] for free brother bram's own sister said
[1:26:22] brother uh brother Bill Bill when all
[1:26:24] those people then when the Holy Spirit
[1:26:25] fell and everybody started screaming and
[1:26:27] started worshiping I had the most awful
[1:26:29] feeling come over me and I didn't like
[1:26:32] feeling that way brother Bram said
[1:26:33] that's the time you should have
[1:26:36] worshiped
[1:26:37] hallelujah hallelujah Satan was only
[1:26:40] trying to cool you down Hallelujah you
[1:26:43] see how the devil does he was telling
[1:26:45] some people don't respond don't do this
[1:26:48] and then this is instruction when you
[1:26:50] feel that cooling down it's not the Holy
[1:26:54] G that's cooling you down that's the
[1:26:56] time to press
[1:26:59] through Hallelujah I say boo
[1:27:02] devil boo devil you're not worthy you're
[1:27:06] not this no I'm going to press
[1:27:09] through hlah let me tell you the devil
[1:27:13] has never held the mystery to your life
[1:27:15] he doesn't know you his statements don't
[1:27:18] Define you your life is defined by the
[1:27:22] word of almighty God
[1:27:25] your life is not even defined by your
[1:27:27] failures it's not even defined by your
[1:27:30] successes it's not even defined by your
[1:27:32] feelings your word your life is defined
[1:27:36] by the word of
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:45] God hallelujah that is so good
[1:27:48] Hallelujah can you turn with Me 2
[1:27:50] Chronicles chapter 20
[1:27:54] oh
[1:27:57] my oh my
[1:27:59] Hallelujah somebody say thank you
[1:28:02] Jesus amen now I'm not going to read
[1:28:05] this whole thing you can read it when
[1:28:06] you get home but brother Brown refer to
[1:28:09] this account over and over when he talks
[1:28:11] about the spirit of God falling in the
[1:28:14] congregation when there was a need now
[1:28:17] you can read in here when you get home
[1:28:19] it was a need because there was an Army
[1:28:21] that was invading Judah and that was
[1:28:23] Moab
[1:28:24] Moab was coming against them
[1:28:26] Jehoshaphat and Judah gathers to have
[1:28:30] prayer and they begin to pray and
[1:28:32] Jehoshaphat begins to talk to the Lord
[1:28:35] and just speak to the Lord as as fathers
[1:28:38] wives children everybody's gathered
[1:28:41] together and they're talking to the Lord
[1:28:43] now I want you to even notice the order
[1:28:44] here after he had finished talking in
[1:28:47] verse
[1:28:48] 13 and the Bible said and all Judah
[1:28:50] stood before the Lord with their little
[1:28:52] ones their wives and their children
[1:28:53] verse 14 then upon jeziel the son of
[1:28:57] Zachariah the son of beniah the son of
[1:28:59] Jil the son of matiah a levite of the
[1:29:02] sons of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord
[1:29:05] in the midst of the congregation he said
[1:29:07] hearken ye all Judah ye inhabitants of
[1:29:09] Jerusalem Thou King of Jehoshaphat thus
[1:29:11] sayith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid
[1:29:13] nor dismayed by the reason of this great
[1:29:16] multitude for the battle is not yours
[1:29:18] but God's tomorrow go you down against
[1:29:21] them behold they'll come up by the cliff
[1:29:23] I could read the rest of it but he goes
[1:29:26] on to tell him you're not going to need
[1:29:27] to fight stand still you're going to see
[1:29:30] the salvation of the Lord and after it's
[1:29:32] all said and done the Bible tells us
[1:29:35] Jehoshaphat in verse 18 he bowed his
[1:29:37] head and began to worship see they were
[1:29:39] well you know what they were looking for
[1:29:40] brother Gomez they wanted to know Moab
[1:29:43] is invading us Lord what do we do so
[1:29:46] they came together and they begin to
[1:29:48] seek God I mean that's that's what we do
[1:29:51] even when we come to the house of God
[1:29:52] that's right right there's decision some
[1:29:54] times that we lord I I need answers to
[1:29:56] now God has different ways we all know
[1:29:58] this as Believers God answers in many
[1:30:00] different ways don't he sometimes the
[1:30:02] answer is always so simple it might be
[1:30:04] something we've walked by forever and
[1:30:05] God says hey go pick up that Jawbone of
[1:30:07] an ass right now and start start T start
[1:30:10] tearing up these Philistines right like
[1:30:12] like shamgar with an Oxo God all of a
[1:30:13] sudden anoints him oh this a it's been
[1:30:15] there all the whole time see God God
[1:30:18] answers in many ways so we're not we're
[1:30:19] not going to confine God to where that
[1:30:21] I've got to come through a prayer line
[1:30:23] God works through I listen I believe in
[1:30:24] prayer lines this is one preacher that
[1:30:26] believes in them I believe we need all
[1:30:28] the resources that God gives and how to
[1:30:30] God to minister to his children I
[1:30:32] believe in all everything that God has
[1:30:34] you're not taking one thing from me
[1:30:36] everything that God has this message
[1:30:38] never put nothing in a closet never
[1:30:41] locked it up but it's put everything in
[1:30:43] its rightful place and given it access
[1:30:46] and put it into the hands of Sons and
[1:30:48] Daughters of
[1:30:49] God so with that being said notice how
[1:30:52] they came out in the ible tells us they
[1:30:54] came out and begin to sing Oh My My My
[1:30:57] My in verse 21 when he had consulted
[1:31:00] with the people he appointed singers
[1:31:02] unto the Lord that should praise the
[1:31:03] beauty of Holiness as they went before
[1:31:05] the Army and to say praise the Lord for
[1:31:07] his Mercy endure forever that day they
[1:31:10] begin to worship God before they ever
[1:31:14] saw the sign of
[1:31:16] Victory see the word had already
[1:31:18] declared and gave the direction the
[1:31:21] spirit of God fa gave Direction it was
[1:31:24] settled in their hearts and they begin
[1:31:26] to worship you know that scripture right
[1:31:29] there you think there's not power right
[1:31:32] in singing of songs oh yes I mean I we
[1:31:35] ain't just singing lyrics we know but
[1:31:37] it's things that mean something personal
[1:31:39] to our heart we're singing to the beauty
[1:31:42] of his
[1:31:43] Holiness oh my I wonder sometimes if
[1:31:46] when we feel a little Gloom after we're
[1:31:48] prayed for if we just start breaking
[1:31:49] into a sing a song and just start begin
[1:31:52] to worship and push that Gloom away
[1:31:54] listen friends things are not going to
[1:31:56] be put in our lap and handed to us
[1:31:58] you'll have to fight for every Divine
[1:31:59] promise of God but let me tell you if
[1:32:02] God be for us who can be against
[1:32:05] us amen glory be to God I feel
[1:32:10] good now brother Bram addresses this in
[1:32:13] question and answers on the seals I I I
[1:32:16] just can't I I I wish I could read all
[1:32:17] those quotes I can just send them to you
[1:32:20] and uh but notice we've all been here
[1:32:22] here here's in church order brother Bram
[1:32:24] says now if you ask me should I be
[1:32:26] baptized he said that's in the Bible but
[1:32:28] he says if you say brother brandom what
[1:32:30] must I do I've got a decision here I've
[1:32:32] got to make whether I should take this
[1:32:34] church or go to another church something
[1:32:37] like that or should I do this or that
[1:32:39] now that have to come from God see see
[1:32:42] God will have to tell us that but that
[1:32:43] would come through another Ministry
[1:32:46] because the word don't say let Armen
[1:32:47] Neville leave brandom Tabernacle and go
[1:32:49] to the Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle he
[1:32:51] don't say that in the word here that
[1:32:53] that's what these gifts are
[1:32:56] for so if you somebody is praying about
[1:33:00] that and Lord I'm praying about this or
[1:33:03] that there's also a word of caution
[1:33:07] don't go looking to some man and say I
[1:33:10] need an answer that can be a Gifted Man
[1:33:14] but you might pull something
[1:33:16] out if if the man's not really in tune
[1:33:20] and really with understanding you might
[1:33:21] pull something out that may not it has
[1:33:24] nothing to do with a man I mean I'm
[1:33:25] talking about what happened to brother
[1:33:26] Neville so you know what it is however
[1:33:28] God wants to answer Lord I know you got
[1:33:30] my
[1:33:32] answer you got my answer if you've got
[1:33:34] to have somebody you think God can't
[1:33:36] give your phone number to
[1:33:38] somebody come on friends we're talking
[1:33:41] about the Living God who actually worked
[1:33:43] through Samuel to tell Saul where the
[1:33:45] mules were
[1:33:47] at listen if God's going to get you just
[1:33:50] have faith in God the message will get
[1:33:52] to you righten
[1:33:54] your answer will come however just be
[1:33:56] looking for his answer and don't put it
[1:33:58] in a certain frame of a man or a woman
[1:34:01] or something or or a gift but just put
[1:34:03] it just say settled on the word of God
[1:34:05] Lord I'm looking to you cuz you said if
[1:34:07] two or three agree as touching any one
[1:34:09] thing it shall be done you said I ask
[1:34:11] the father anything in my name shall be
[1:34:14] done Lord I'm standing on your word
[1:34:17] hallelujah my my my notice in the
[1:34:21] message why everybody all right amen
[1:34:24] afraid to say something if you're not
[1:34:28] huh what I told you about questions and
[1:34:30] answers on the holy ghost or the service
[1:34:33] that was preached before where the
[1:34:34] spirit of God come down and encouraged
[1:34:36] and broke that away from the people same
[1:34:38] thing happened in the message the token
[1:34:40] in treport and it was right where it
[1:34:41] should be too the spirit of God I wanted
[1:34:44] to play some of these here for you
[1:34:45] tonight but I I'm just not going to be
[1:34:47] able to because I wanted you to hear it
[1:34:49] and uh maybe I maybe I'll start out next
[1:34:51] service with just that part and then go
[1:34:52] from there but you hear it come and it
[1:34:55] is coming right according to the word
[1:34:58] and it's moving in in that place to to
[1:35:00] encourage the people of God in the
[1:35:03] promise of God now watch uh you know uh
[1:35:07] brother Bram will say it in in in this
[1:35:09] place here in the message why he's
[1:35:11] talking now I want remember this thing
[1:35:13] I'm talking about on direct message and
[1:35:15] how it comes in that way brother Bram
[1:35:17] says a tongue's interpretation has gone
[1:35:20] forth and he says now he commends the
[1:35:23] people he said now holy spirit is
[1:35:24] present he said that's exactly right in
[1:35:26] order as it should be he's at Phoenix
[1:35:28] right now and he says now what watch
[1:35:30] this now somebody in here feels the
[1:35:33] effect of that
[1:35:39] message this is just one of many places
[1:35:42] somebody in here feels the effect of
[1:35:43] that message and he says now you just
[1:35:46] wait just wait for a moment I know it's
[1:35:48] right I do believe in altar calls we're
[1:35:50] coming up and confessing things and so
[1:35:51] forth like that but in the scripture as
[1:35:52] many as believed you said it might be
[1:35:54] somebody in here that's been halfway
[1:35:57] seeking the Holy Spirit he says you run
[1:36:01] around or some sinner that doesn't know
[1:36:02] God just maybe maybe three or four
[1:36:04] trials and and just kindly unconcerned
[1:36:07] that message is sinking right down in
[1:36:09] their heart right now ever who it is
[1:36:11] this would be the hour for
[1:36:15] you now my father-in-law is sitting back
[1:36:20] there God began to deal with his life
[1:36:23] I'm sure he don't even know how in the
[1:36:25] world he ended back up in
[1:36:27] church I don't want to say he's stubborn
[1:36:29] or anything like that
[1:36:34] but but many of you remember that that
[1:36:37] that that that old building we used that
[1:36:39] other building we used to
[1:36:40] rent he was sitting right right up right
[1:36:43] right out in
[1:36:44] there now this comes back to me even
[1:36:47] more his his sister Norma had just given
[1:36:49] her life to the Lord she was sent I'm
[1:36:52] going to tell this on him too she was
[1:36:53] sitting right there in this
[1:36:55] chair and God just struck her heart in
[1:36:58] the service here she comes running I I
[1:37:00] don't know if it's I don't know if it's
[1:37:01] a month before two months I I don't
[1:37:02] remember that part of it but he comes
[1:37:06] and sits down in you know he has to sit
[1:37:08] out there in the foyer because want no
[1:37:09] room inside the congregation the funny
[1:37:11] thing he sat down in the same chair she
[1:37:14] was at as if the chair you know he turns
[1:37:17] around he all of a sudden gets up goes
[1:37:19] and sits in another chair it wasn't the
[1:37:20] chair that did anything must have
[1:37:22] thought man that's a zero hitting spot
[1:37:24] pow I don't
[1:37:28] want now I didn't see him do that there
[1:37:30] was musicians that saw him do it matter
[1:37:32] of fact it was my mom right there sge
[1:37:34] saw him do that and so but here's the
[1:37:37] thing that happened in that service that
[1:37:39] day I never forget brother Browning got
[1:37:41] up and he took his text out of Ezekiel
[1:37:43] and talking about how the how how the
[1:37:45] prophet among the people of God before
[1:37:47] they went into Exile that the message
[1:37:49] they weren't taken real serious and it
[1:37:51] says Thou Art nothing but a lovely song
[1:37:54] in other words something that's just
[1:37:55] Pleasant that's all they were taking the
[1:37:57] message as just something that's
[1:37:58] Pleasant and lovely and not really
[1:37:59] getting into it and this is why they
[1:38:01] were in Babylon and the spirit of God
[1:38:02] went right down through in that service
[1:38:04] and I never forget the Holy Spirit
[1:38:06] struck and it spoke right out in that
[1:38:08] service right after that message came
[1:38:10] forth I'm telling you it was it didn't
[1:38:13] matter what chair he was sitting in he
[1:38:15] was at the altar right he knew it was
[1:38:18] for him if he could stand up here and
[1:38:20] tell you right now he said I knew at
[1:38:22] that time that was for me that was my
[1:38:24] last
[1:38:27] opportunity you understand what I'm
[1:38:29] saying you say well shouldn't that be
[1:38:31] judged it was
[1:38:32] judged you see it's just like when the
[1:38:34] prophet tells us in question and answers
[1:38:37] when he's talking about brother Neville
[1:38:38] being up here he says right then and
[1:38:39] there that's judged right
[1:38:41] there you see what I'm saying and this
[1:38:44] is where like is I never forget Brian
[1:38:46] you know man you think it don't mean a
[1:38:47] lot were you serving the lord your kids
[1:38:49] Brian I remember Brian when he realized
[1:38:51] that his dad was standing at the altar
[1:38:52] he rean ran up there and he grabbed his
[1:38:55] feet I don't know if he's afraid he's
[1:38:56] going to run away or what but he grabbed
[1:38:57] his feet I tell you he had so many
[1:39:00] people around him that day there ain't
[1:39:01] no way he'd got out of
[1:39:06] there that is so
[1:39:12] good and watch how the prophet says this
[1:39:15] I I I I know you all don't believe me
[1:39:16] anymore when I say I'm closing
[1:39:19] but let me read this let me read this
[1:39:22] last quote and then can I do something
[1:39:23] I'll Lord willing next next time we're
[1:39:26] together here on next Thursday I I'll
[1:39:28] start out with this and then we'll move
[1:39:29] on from there CU I want you to hear this
[1:39:32] one but I'm just I'm not going to play
[1:39:33] it tonight but just listen to this end
[1:39:36] time evangelism brother Bram says those
[1:39:38] messages because something spoke right
[1:39:41] out in that service of end time
[1:39:43] evangelism and brother Bram says now
[1:39:45] notice he
[1:39:46] said he said these messages sometimes
[1:39:49] speak someone we don't know who they are
[1:39:53] sometimes they tell who they are but
[1:39:57] just someone in here that maybe just
[1:39:59] started to move away without it in other
[1:40:01] words coming back to God or what how the
[1:40:05] message was going within time evangelism
[1:40:07] and when you do remember that's the Holy
[1:40:09] Spirit speaking to a language that it
[1:40:11] just takes some inspiration the same
[1:40:13] that spoke it the same to interpret it
[1:40:17] now that's no mystery to us because how
[1:40:21] the holy spirit will come even through
[1:40:23] the preaching of the word and it's like
[1:40:25] our lives have been com combed over
[1:40:27] sometimes it comes to correct us is that
[1:40:29] right then there's other times it comes
[1:40:32] to comfort us and it's direct right it's
[1:40:36] direct you you you can you can just you
[1:40:38] can pick it up and we're always at the
[1:40:40] point of making that decision but even
[1:40:42] how the prophet was bringing this here
[1:40:44] that there is times and I have I have
[1:40:46] witnessed that I witnessed that even
[1:40:48] here in the assembly a brother was
[1:40:51] praying for a job and he was between
[1:40:53] jobs and I never forget it was during I
[1:40:55] don't know if it was during a prayer
[1:40:56] meeting or a midweek service I think it
[1:40:59] might it might have been a midweek
[1:41:00] service and the Holy Spirit just just
[1:41:03] just it spoke in that time and uh you
[1:41:06] know I'll be honest with you my my in my
[1:41:08] part of it and this is just you know how
[1:41:09] how we grow I was looking at it and I
[1:41:12] thought well it don't seem exactly exact
[1:41:14] but the Holy Spirit spoke in such a way
[1:41:17] speaking peace to that person and to
[1:41:20] that individual I'm not making anything
[1:41:21] up they it's spoke to them just be of a
[1:41:25] good cheer and be at peace with God God
[1:41:28] knows your need it went right down
[1:41:30] through the line now you see here I am
[1:41:32] standing I I'm listening for everything
[1:41:34] and you know what happened was it was
[1:41:35] exactly that brother right after the
[1:41:37] service he said you know what that was
[1:41:39] for
[1:41:40] me it was it was just that that direct
[1:41:43] you see what I'm saying that was judged
[1:41:45] right
[1:41:46] there now if things within that manner
[1:41:50] would continue and if we would see
[1:41:52] things where it's not then that's where
[1:41:54] there's some things that God would give
[1:41:56] us Grace to step in are you are you
[1:41:59] hearing me so it isn't just things
[1:42:01] that's just left open just loose but I
[1:42:03] you understand what I'm saying it's
[1:42:04] things that I've got I could read much
[1:42:07] more quotes to you but it's just to show
[1:42:09] you there's also another angle to it
[1:42:11] isn't isn't always uncovering sin
[1:42:14] sometimes there's things where God comes
[1:42:15] to bring comfort and you know what the
[1:42:17] person who's being spoke to in a direct
[1:42:20] message God can call their name and
[1:42:22] sometimes God calls in and it's as
[1:42:23] though they're the only one
[1:42:26] setting that's how you feel sometimes
[1:42:28] when the preaching of the word it's
[1:42:29] almost
[1:42:30] like turn that screen off my whole
[1:42:32] life's up
[1:42:35] there and the songs you've sung and the
[1:42:37] service and this who's done that the
[1:42:39] same Holy Spirit through a different
[1:42:41] Channel but it's the same God and you
[1:42:42] know why you know why God's doing that
[1:42:43] that's his love the prophet said it like
[1:42:46] this he said he said here's God he said
[1:42:48] he said if it was me he said I gave you
[1:42:50] my word that should be enough he said'
[1:42:52] now that's me that'd be enough he said
[1:42:54] but not God he said God loves you so
[1:42:56] much that he put five ministerial gifts
[1:42:59] to tell you what he said in here already
[1:43:01] and he said you know what if you still
[1:43:03] don't get it his love for you reaches
[1:43:05] out because he's placed nine spiritual
[1:43:07] gifts because he wants you to get what
[1:43:10] he said about
[1:43:13] you Hallelujah I feel like singing that
[1:43:15] song if that isn't
[1:43:17] love if that is in
[1:43:21] love don't you love it
[1:43:23] tonight amen I I trust I haven't been
[1:43:27] just you know just speaking from my
[1:43:28] heart and as things are coming but I
[1:43:30] trust there's some things I trust it
[1:43:31] maybe made sense and I um I also told
[1:43:34] you know with the I mentioned um with
[1:43:37] the brothers we were I was talking the
[1:43:39] other day and I said you know and it was
[1:43:40] before brother George had come and I
[1:43:42] just I this is what I I plan on doing is
[1:43:45] I get a little further here a little bit
[1:43:46] more with uh with church order and just
[1:43:49] just stay some things in that I feel
[1:43:50] like the Lord would be bringing us to
[1:43:52] I'm sure there'll be questions and so I
[1:43:54] I'd like to have times on questions and
[1:43:56] answers just to with things just
[1:43:57] pertaining to that and because maybe
[1:43:59] there's some things you thought I think
[1:44:01] I heard it this way and maybe it's this
[1:44:02] way it just allows us to polish it up
[1:44:04] okay so if if we're talking about
[1:44:07] questions on the church order please
[1:44:08] don't ask me questions on
[1:44:11] pajamas the reason I say that because
[1:44:12] brother Bram got them questions and
[1:44:14] questions and answers on the seals but
[1:44:16] but I'll say it in this way if you've
[1:44:17] got a if you've got a question we want
[1:44:18] to try to keep it around that subject
[1:44:20] but we we'll let you know that in ahead
[1:44:22] of time and if You' got question I'll
[1:44:23] say it like this if there's something
[1:44:24] that that that that I've said and you
[1:44:26] got a question about it that's been
[1:44:28] brought from here look anytime you can
[1:44:30] have my notes I I don't I don't have
[1:44:31] nothing to hide I don't have no certain
[1:44:33] quotes to hide and I keep other quotes
[1:44:35] if there's a quote I ain't seen give it
[1:44:37] to me I'll put it with the rest I I just
[1:44:39] I want all the word of God if there's
[1:44:41] something you don't let me just say it
[1:44:42] like this I'm not interested in being
[1:44:43] right I just want to be correct yes and
[1:44:46] so with that in mind there's many times
[1:44:48] I've had to say forgive me I'm wrong oh
[1:44:51] my oh I see this a little bit more and
[1:44:52] I'll tell you I have been enjoying just
[1:44:54] even going through and studying on this
[1:44:56] and how the Lord just man I've just been
[1:44:58] having such a wonderful time going
[1:45:00] through it and and uh well you know it's
[1:45:03] kind of like the cook that maybe thinks
[1:45:04] they made a good and I didn't bake
[1:45:06] anything good this is my doing but man I
[1:45:08] just love to be able to share it and I
[1:45:09] trust that God gets it across to us amen
[1:45:12] help me to get out of the way Lord so it
[1:45:14] can get across to his people amen so we
[1:45:17] Lord willing we'll do that at some time
[1:45:19] and and have that you know uh uh that
[1:45:21] that time after we've come to place with
[1:45:23] with that but I I just so thank the Lord
[1:45:25] for his Mercy don't you yes sir amen
[1:45:28] amen I tell you if there's some I
[1:45:29] believe there's things that God has
[1:45:30] spoke personally to our hearts tonight
[1:45:32] even out of a teaching message that God
[1:45:34] has spoken very clearly and you know may
[1:45:36] maybe you're the one that got the part
[1:45:38] about breaking through hey when the
[1:45:39] gloomy Spirit comes around break through
[1:45:41] that thing don't let that thing get on
[1:45:43] there well everybody else is shouting
[1:45:44] everybody else having a good time break
[1:45:46] right through that don't let that thing
[1:45:48] lay on you bust right through that thing
[1:45:51] now that don't mean making a show of
[1:45:52] your it just means you know what don't
[1:45:54] let that cooling thing hang around
[1:45:56] you You're Made To Worship the Lord
[1:45:59] that's right you might start out like
[1:46:00] this the prophet said start out waving
[1:46:02] that pinky all of a sudden now it's
[1:46:04] going like this then it's like
[1:46:06] this Hallelujah you know what this
[1:46:09] moving this right here it's a sign the
[1:46:10] rest of the hands going to be moving my
[1:46:12] arms going to be moving then eventually
[1:46:13] my torso everything else is going to be
[1:46:15] moving I'm pressing on
[1:46:17] through because God's got something for
[1:46:21] me amen

[1:46:33] to just also just offer prayer just pray
[1:46:36] with our brother tonight for a need and
[1:46:40] let's just let's just go to the Lord
[1:46:41] here in
[1:46:43] prayer heavenly father thank you for
[1:46:47] your mercies Lord once again
[1:46:49] tonight father it's just been a
[1:46:51] wonderful it's been wonderful Lord to
[1:46:53] have been here and I believe Lord that
[1:46:56] you not only have broken the bread to us
[1:46:59] Lord and and speaking and teaching our
[1:47:02] hearts Lord to bring Lord Us in in a
[1:47:05] place Lord where our lives are edified
[1:47:07] there's a growth there's an
[1:47:08] understanding and we're not we're not
[1:47:10] walking with fear we're not walking Lord
[1:47:13] in intimidation we know that God that
[1:47:15] you you place the gifts in the church
[1:47:18] and Lord we know that sometimes Lord man
[1:47:21] and I don't believe men and people Lord
[1:47:23] for the most part all the way I'll say
[1:47:25] down through down through time I don't
[1:47:27] believe people Lord have meant to do
[1:47:29] things that's been wrong but Lord how we
[1:47:32] thank you for your leadership because
[1:47:34] you want everything Lord to be held in a
[1:47:38] manner of reverence that it that it
[1:47:40] would work effectually it's just like
[1:47:42] Lord in a life that there's so much out
[1:47:44] of a life that can be testified and
[1:47:46] spoken maybe a person that goes to
[1:47:48] school they go to their job Lord they
[1:47:51] maybe haven't said a word but their life
[1:47:53] speaks
[1:47:54] volumes and Lord
[1:47:56] Jesus we thank you for your mercies I
[1:47:59] pray tonight Lord for every one of us
[1:48:02] that's gathered here those that are
[1:48:03] streaming those that Lord would listen
[1:48:06] to this Lord I pray that if there's
[1:48:08] something that was said Lord maybe in a
[1:48:10] someone from another congregation or
[1:48:11] something I I didn't mean that I didn't
[1:48:13] mean anything for anybody else it's just
[1:48:15] Lord what I feel on my heart for here
[1:48:18] but Lord I I've not cut any angles I've
[1:48:21] not cut certain quotes and taken things
[1:48:24] out we believe it all Lord we believe
[1:48:26] this message that you've sent to us and
[1:48:29] father to give us you've given us Grace
[1:48:32] to be able to look in and see father the
[1:48:34] full counsel of God Lord I'm sure that I
[1:48:39] don't see everything the way I need to
[1:48:40] see it but I'm asking you for Grace
[1:48:44] Lord father the great wonderful things
[1:48:48] that you've given us Lord from your word
[1:48:50] and the greatest thing you could ever
[1:48:52] give us Lord is your word yourself then
[1:48:55] from there Lord every part and
[1:48:57] everything that is unpacked and unfolded
[1:48:59] Lord from every gift oh
[1:49:02] God it's because of
[1:49:05] you Lord if if there wasn't
[1:49:08] a if there wasn't a gift or even as we
[1:49:11] we had a question would you rather have
[1:49:13] some gift or may make you a great person
[1:49:16] or would you rather have the love of God
[1:49:18] In Your Heart Lord I than every one of
[1:49:22] us us could say safely I'd rather have
[1:49:25] the love of God because it's real Divine
[1:49:28] love that gives value to every
[1:49:33] gift it it it it gives the real
[1:49:37] density to that gift lord it's like we
[1:49:40] can take Lord two different balls that
[1:49:43] maybe a little ball like they have in
[1:49:44] them grocery stores at times they're so
[1:49:46] light you throw up in the air if it's a
[1:49:47] wind it'd blow it away you could get a
[1:49:49] bowling ball that's the same size but
[1:49:52] the difference is it might look the same
[1:49:54] size but the difference is the
[1:49:57] density and father it's the love of God
[1:49:59] in our life that makes the
[1:50:02] difference that's what makes a
[1:50:03] difference and that love of God that's
[1:50:05] you that's the word of God that's the
[1:50:06] Holy Spirit that's that honey of
[1:50:09] almighty God pouring down through our
[1:50:12] lives Lord help us we just love you Lord
[1:50:16] we want to be a benefit to the body
[1:50:18] we're not here Lord to chase after gifts
[1:50:21] they're in the body we just want to be
[1:50:24] available and we want Lord ask you to
[1:50:26] forgive us of our shortcomings forgive
[1:50:29] us Lord of things that dear God of
[1:50:31] anything is in our heart if there's
[1:50:33] anything Lord that is a channel that we
[1:50:36] need to empty up Lord then father we
[1:50:39] want to be available to you at all
[1:50:41] times most importantly Lord we're
[1:50:44] looking forward to that Rapture
[1:50:49] morning for you I
[1:50:53] Ram has come in view on this Mount
