Lord we ask that you would forgive us Lord God of our shortcomings father we pray Lord but Lord Jesus may the spirit of grace Lord move among us tonight Lord God and bring us Lord in two places Lord that you ordained for us to be in Lord Father we just Lord God give ourselves to you now Lord and asking your blessing on the further part of the service in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen will you turn with me to revelations 14 I want to look here revelations 14 tonight just a few verses of Scripture revelations 14 verse 1 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads now this is this is after you know this is after the rapture this is after the tribulation this is this is after that of Armageddon here what we're looking at is now to see God's great accomplishment and achievement look at this and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written in their foreheads and I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders look what access and what their privileged tune right now what access and what privilege before the throne they sung as it were a new song and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand which were redeemed from the earth I want you to notice those words tonight which were redeemed from the earth these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto God and to the lamb and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of God amen may God bless his word bless use your being seated tonight we know that in this scripture were looking at a time of where that Israel themselves comes into the glorious revelation of who the Messiah is and also their part within it to Israel itself where where they will be saved where God Himself will accomplish what he started and I know we when we look at this here within the scripture as we started here in Exodus 15 and and you realize that so much in Exodus 15 when you read it there's so much of things that Moses would come under the joy of what he saw take place and remember with the Egyptians they saw on the seashore but mem says when he saw that Moses entered into the spirit and you realized so much was spoken then of what had happened and yet as you read through it which we went over that sometimes you read and you see where there is much of it that is prophecy that was actually going to come where Israel would come into the land and then there's still prophecy of when Israel themselves would actually come in to the position that God had ordained for them there's still also a part even in Exodus 15 that pertains even prophetically speaking of the bride of Jesus Christ also that even of those who will of the Gentiles that will come through the tribulation period so there's much within that of Exodus 15 of how that when you come to the real some of it and you look that it's all the Lord's doing that's one thing that when we look at all of it in Exodus 15 is the Lord will help us here you find that it's all he's doing and truly that's something that you and I we become more aware of I know I've said it a lot but it's something that for me I just become more aware of you find things to where you and I can have burdens and desires on our heart things that we know that are necessary but yet within it we're looking and saying you know Lord how does this happen how is this performed how is this brought about but you know when God gives us a for something it isn't that God would drop that burden in her heart and then ask for us to use human instrumentality to perform it but what God wants us to do when he drops a burden in our heart is that we might take that burden and pray about that burden and put it before God and then watch God who dropped the burden which is what his desire is once God bring to manifestation the burden that he's placed on our hearts we see that over and over God it's not looking and he does not want our human instrumentality he doesn't need us to bring the word to pass the only thing that he needs is for us to be obedient and submit to him he'll bring the word to pass and so when we see this here tonight and we look at it there is that of Israel that which is redeemed as the Scriptures we read here that when we think of this in Redemption you know that Redemption itself is that we're in that one who actually already and always belonged now is brought back to the one in whom has do they always belong to so when we see these words redeemed and we'll look at them through the scriptures tonight that redeemed itself is we're in that how that God it will speak that these here of the 144,000 that they themselves are also in the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb section they are also those in Revelation six which when it says that of the fifth seal is open and you find that of the martyrs who of that during the time as brother Ben calls it the amateur tribulation or pre tribulation time of Eichmann where in that you know that those spirits were released against the Jews to actually to drive Israel back to the homeland and brother Brandon goes into that they're laying that out for us that even those in that time as they're crying out how long till thou avenge and brother brems says how he goes into the scripture how they are given white robes he said see they also are elect of God having being given white robes their names on the Lamb's Book of Life so to recognize that Redemption itself is that which actually always belonged to him and God never forgets what belongs to him the whole process itself the Bible self is a great love story being unfolded from God's mind his heart and a great love story that's being unfolded and I I trust you tonight that even as the Lord would just move through the word that we can see the parallel of how that God would deal with Israel in order to bring Israel back into position and back into her homeland it's the same thing that God has done and is doing with our lives even right now so when we look at this with Redemption and thinking of election notice in Romans 11 verse 1 I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid for I also AM an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin now remember that it was Israel themselves they rejected here the Messiah when he come because as we'll read here in a few moments it was because of blindness now to see how all of that had come about there were traditions there were all of those things that God had permitted to come and we see all of that making away to where they could not identify the very simplicity of how that God himself would come and come down among him did they have the word they did have the word they had the writings of the prophets they had the law they had everything as far as writings that one could have but you see it just goes to show that just to have the writings alone is not enough it has to be the Spirit of God working with the election of God that will actually bring the eyes to be open I'll tell you as we look at this here tonight I trust that it becomes more real to you that it is not our strivings and what we have done it is God's grace that has been poured out upon us if we see tonight it's because that the grace of God has been poured out upon our lives and so to see this of how that Israel remember that Israel even in the time of Paul's ministry here the Lord Jesus had spoke that there would be a trotting down there at Jerusalem and remember even after the Lord Jesus was offered up and that Calvary and the resurrection remember that even in Jerusalem that went on for many years but then you find the scriptures there in the book of Acts where Paul is members bringing the word and the gospel to the Jews and when it reaches its final moment then he says hello we turned from the Jews unto the Gentiles the brother Graham picks that up that's then when you find in this letting go of Titus his besiegement now coming against Jerusalem but yet within it all God has not forgotten Jerusalem so to see how that Paul would pick this up by being able to look back into the Old Testament and the prophesies of which the Jews themselves were looking for God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew glory what he not what the scripture said of Elijah how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying Lord they have killed by prophets and digged down thine altars and I am left alone and they seek my life but what saith the answer of God unto him I have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of bow even so then at this present time see what's how Paul under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost can reach back and pick that up where in Elijah's ministry and the type of it was that there was a minority there was a elect that was reserved in that hour and Paul can reach back by the Spirit of Jesus Christ remember the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy he can look right back and see that expression and bring it forward and say that that even is is an actual representation and a prophecy that even at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then it is no more of works is that right so it's no more well I did this I did this and God knowing this and that that's not at all that's still your works well I cried and I sought after God that's your works it is not our crying that has got God's attention the real reality any brokenness about our life to where that we and ourselves would be moved to repentance it's because he has already made a choice and the spirit of grace is being poured out upon our lives so it is nothing that we can take credit for then all of a sudden we've done something and God came by and he just seemed that we meant business know that still fleshly carnal glory it is all the work of the grace of Almighty God you might have forgot God but he never forgot you and if by grace then it's no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then and it's no more grace otherwise work is no more work not what then Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for in that an odd statement he was seeking for it but he didn't obtain it why he wasn't looking for it in the right way remember Paul goes on to let this be known to us I believe it's Romans 9 where Paul says because they sought it not by faith but as it were by works you see it was not that they could do anything to merit it you realized that even when they would have went back and begin to reflect there in Deuteronomy God let it be known that I didn't call you out because you were more of a people than anybody else I called you out and brought you out of Egypt because I made a promise to your father's you see God works by it's promised world can we have confidence in that then if we can have confidence which we should that God performs his promised word then how can there be any way that a bride of Jesus Christ the real bride can come back with anything less than the full world because you would have a woman who is part believing part doubting but you see far to be the bride of Jesus Christ it's got to believe that God is God and God keeps every one of his promises and so to see this then that they sought it not by faith but by works but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded notice the election and the rest according as it's written God hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day so there's an elect rim not to think of this how that God would call Israel out of Egypt remember even he called Israel of Egypt there were two out of those millions that were actually of the election is that right it was only two that was of the election the rest of them jesus said they died in the wilderness they perish there but you see Joshua and Caleb to put it plainly as the prophet spoken in the message he said it took an effect upon Joshua and Caleb to know what the message was really all about are you with me now so you see then there is in the time of Elisha there is the seven thousand that God had reserved to himself now watch what this does even though Joshua and Caleb even though you have the seven thousand even though you have with Ezra and Nehemiah and the returning remnant even though that you have within each of them they are better the election but what's the grace of God as the grace of God goes forth it stirs them out because they are a part of the and that of the word that is to be fulfilled in that hour and the spirit of grace moving upon their life it actually brings them in position hey that's exactly what it's done for you and I it's been the spirit of grace not the spirit of law it's the spirit of God's grace and when God's grace moves it writes upon our hearts the very laws of Almighty God it brings about a change so that you and I are not looking at something on the outside but we and ourselves have within our lives by the grace of God the word written upon the tablets of our heart to where Paul could say you are written epistles read of all men so to recognize that which the Spirit of God Himself has expressly wrote and now is made manifest so you see it's God Himself drawing us to him for us to even seek after him it's because he's drawing us so you find that even in the time when you find that the Jews coming back out of Babylon after captivity there was a remnant not all the Jews came and not all of them came at the same time you see there had to be Azra come first then you find me and mine in them coming right and even before Ezra there was others who came before Ezra right so then you find there is a remnant the Bible says remember who and when even when Cyrus recognizes his position he said whosoever that that that the Lord his spirit is with him to stir him up to fulfill this word so it was not men trying to fulfill the prophecy it was God stirring up the hearts to fulfill the prophecy because they were gonna face adversity but you see when God already knows what adversity even they were going to face he knows what adversity you and I were gonna face but the Bible is very clear he strengthens us before ever encompassed glory be to God blessed be the name of the Lord you see even in the time of the Lord Jesus there was a minority a minority that was looking for him yet if you looked and asked no doubt throughout all of Israel they would say we're looking for the Messiah but yet there was a minority who was looking for him Bill Graham tells us in birth pains that small little church Anna Simeon I can't remember the others build a few many names off it was only those who were looking now watch this what's the spirit of grace preparing this Luke chapter 2 verse 25 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem notice whose name was Simeon where was he at in Jerusalem and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him it was the Spirit of God that was upon Simeon at this time he was waiting for that consolation remember Israel was looking for the Messiah because through the Messiah it would come that of redemption and that in itself would be the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the kingdom would be set up here upon this earth did they not ask the Lord Jesus before he ascended they're asking him millennial terms when will the kingdom be restored to Israel right but he didn't tell them he didn't tell them at that time will glory be to God and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost I love that that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ wonderful was simians great great great great great great great great great great great great great great grandchild that said when he boarded that flight maybe from Iran that said we're not going back there to die we're going back to see the Messiah well it might not have been in the natural but he was also under the influence and the direction of the Holy Ghost glory be to God think of the Syria and to see this in Romans 11 for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceits you see it was a mystery this was not seen of the taking of the Gentile bride ball goes into right the covenants all those things that pertain to Israel but what was not seen is the taking of a Gentile bond but remember Joseph has brethren but he came to get a bride a man one can never take the place of the other then to see how Paul would going to write this lest you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in I'll tell you right now we're here we're here the Bible's clear when you begin to see that fig tree putting forth her buds that fig tree represents Israel she's now back in her homeland they write all of these things with the prophecies throughout the scriptures everything just coming and tying together and so all Israel shall be saved does that mean every Jew no all Israel come on the Bible says in the Book of Isaiah he said the Lord has sent a word unto Jacob and he hath lightened upon Israel there is a world that is set to Jacob but it will lighten upon Israel you with me not every Jew but all Israel of the hundred and forty-four thousand shall be saved as it is written there shall not come out there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins is that not what he's done for us that he himself has come to remove ungodliness from our life where does he go he goes to the very root of the problem he's not going to try to make every little thing we do just perfect he goes to the root of the problem remember he himself come there filled with that spirit of the law of the spirit of life there of Jesus Christ and to think over there it was a life that lived in victory and manifested that work and then that varied and that very reality being birth within our hearts it brings that reality where there is a release from ungodliness it wouldn't matter if a person never did a thing is still ungodly because the first birth were under the condemnation is that right so to notice here all Israel shall be saved now to think of this of God's great providential working you know brother Graham will say it like this he says in that sixth seal it's the Tribulation Period and this is what takes place the bride has gone there's no living creature speaking of one of those of the four living creatures there nothing there to say it so there was no announcement there either at the fifth seal or the sixth seal now God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel so and the finishing up here of the Gentiles the Spirit of God that here is upon the Gentile church it will move forth upon the two witnesses and then the scripture is clear let him that's filthy be filthy still there will not be within that time anymore with when the same within the Gentiles God will not be dealing anymore with the Gentiles at that time but he will be dealing expressly with the Jews just like even in this hour right now he is expressly dealing with his bride there are other it listen we're not going anywhere until every member every one that is wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life because he will not lose one he's not going to go anywhere until he has each and every one that's what he's doing he's claiming his subjects by his word as he's ministering to our hearts so to see God's grace in dealing with our life but I'm says God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets of revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation the bride is not a nation the bride is the wife Israel is a nation God's servant nation and when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom aid is where David the son of David sets on the throne so he breaks on over there in the Millennium now notice here in the scriptures in Zechariah chapter 10 verse 6 of how that God would speak here this Redemption many places in the scripture but notice he says I will strengthen the house of Judah and I will save the house of Joseph and I will bring them again to place them for I have mercy upon them and they shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the Lord their God and will hear them oh my we can stay on that a long time but if you'll notice no part in there it's me I will I will I will I will I will I will so who's getting the glory he is this is his sovereign Providence you're working by his spirit notice I will bring them again to place them not just bring them in into the land but to place them in the land you see this is a time for Israel to be positioned it's a time for her to be positioned as a nation before I mageddon been dead before the millennium such it's a time for her to be positioned just as you and I receive our positioning in Christ right now as the sons and daughters of God being born of the Spirit of God baptized by one spirit into that one body right now we receive our placement who is it by I will I have mercy upon them and I don't I love this last partner I'm not gonna preach on this and they shall be as though I had not cast them off for I am the Lord their God and will hear them do you realize that it comes a time even when God works with Israel here that there is a time for Mourning and then there's a time to turn that morning to where they come to that fountain they received that cleansing that of the baptism of the holy ghost it's a timed in for them to rejoice job does not want Israel walking around mourning and dragging for what she did in the past oh listen to me now job does not watch you walking around or me walking around and dragging in the past he wants to remove the former sales the former remembrance and that's why the Spirit of God moves in our life behold all things have become new amen we become new creatures in Christ Jesus glory be to God and they have ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine as through wine wonderful rejoicing through wine like we're rejoicing through wine becoming mighty by who him yeah their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the Lord no what's the scripture boy I about lost myself and I will hiss for them you know this word hiss means it means to whistle or pipe as a signal God's gonna sing a song I will hiss for them and gather them for I have redeemed you mean he's not going to know he already has redeemed them remember the Feast of the atonement in Leviticus 23 is not another killing of the lamb it Nevada cursed three mentions nothing about killing another lamp it points back till the lamb killed in the Passover you with me this is the revealing to you and I even in this hour it's not another lamb it is the revealing of the true atonement to point out what he has already done I will hiss for them it's a signal brother bill well who get the signal those who are the certain sound - it'll be a certain sound to them they start assembling what at his hissing his planting his whistling his signal will glory be to God and they shall increase as they have increased so they've already been redeemed when at Calvary right but just as the Prophet tells us some souls in prison now that when the word comes across to our path that that is when Christ himself thoroughly redeems you and I he makes real and personal that Calvary was not a wholesale affair Calvary was with you in mind it's personal are you with me when that blue net name is splashed beneath that Clorox bleach notice Zechariah 10 9 and I will show them among the people notice how it breaks back and forth I will sow them among the people now if you saw something that's seed and seed itself is going to bring forth at the right time so I will sell them among the people so here is Israel being scattered and dispersed and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn again and I will bring them again also out of the land of each of notice here here is he's typing the south and gather them out of Assyria and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon and and place not be found for them look at this in verse 11 and he shall pass through the sea with the fliction oh here goes another journey through the sea he shall pass through the sea with the fliction and shall smack the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall drive notice how both were brought out here there was a parting of the sea and there was also a parting of the river Jordan right had to come through the sea there a consuming of enemies and they had to go through the Jordan to come into position Oh glory be to God and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down you know as these are speaking of spiritual powers here and the scepter of Egypt shall depart away and I will strengthen them in the Lord and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the Lord I think of the scripture in Isaiah 43 6 where it says I will say to the north give up my sons I will say to these let my daughters return you see God himself his voice though the rest of the earth cannot hear it but those sons and daughters are hearing him say come back home come back home come back home what's he doing he's hissing for them he's signaling for them come back home he listened friends when the baptism of the Holy Ghost breaks upon our soul in the new birth listen that is a manifestation that we were already redeemed at Calvary and he goes clear back to the mind of God where it says in Revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world it reaches clear back into joel when the sons of God shouted for joy men shouting they're represented there's a lamb that's one that is here to bring us back home girl would be the dawn out say to the north give up I love it I say I say tonight one of the authority here they've listened if Israel being moved under that signal what about a bride that comes in life with the option of a Holy Spirit in this hour to manifest and reflect on earth what's taken place in heaven the Prophet tells us he said if he moves his hand in heaven there must be a movement on the other the movements that's going on in the heaven are being reflected in the earth one a unity that's coming here Hosea 6:1 come let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up I want you to catch this come let us return unto the Lord this is a beckoning going out that - into Israel gathering them back home this is the same listen this same beckoning comes over to us as the bride of Jesus Christ come let us return unto the Lord because remember here down through the ages notice how the outpouring of the Holy Spirit would come as he's making a bad Gentile bride but there has to come a time of completion because the bride herself he comes from down through the ages to where Christ Himself does not marry a little girl but he marries and unites with a mature woman one who is of his choosing she is the secret the mystery that was in him she is that what she United with while Israel was in blindness Joseph United with a Gentile bride it's the same spirit of god that would call us as the bride of Jesus Christ remember when all many of Christendom it looks as though it's worshiping the Lord but yet they drifted from the real reality of a real walk with Almighty God where there's really been a birth of the Holy Spirit in their life it's drifted to church isms and and church anity and just knowing this and knowing that well but the call is come let us return unto the Lord look what assurance he's torn but he'll heal us he's smitten but he'll bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his side one who can really deal with the pools on this one right here but to see how that God after two days after 2,000 years he will revive us notice they are there they are in left remember as Paul said there is an elect according to his foreknowledge just like he's tapped into 7,000 there in the time of Elisha but notice it's him that revives them to come at that time it's not a man it's not a president God will use vessels but it's not the vessel it's God moving all the sea come on somebody it's just like in this hour to see this is a time Jerusalem must be recognized as the capital you know I you know that shells because it's fixin to break forth after there of the tribulation and after on the getting where your Jerusalem is the center of worship we'll repeat of God Pulsar ways you said mother Samuel that's President Trump remember as I said last week who was Cyrus maybe there was you know Cyrus showers I don't know Cyrus real-estate but one thing about it if you read the scripture it says that God held him up on this right hand it was called who gave Cyrus power to do what he did you see it's something to recognize that and to see God moving things into position in this hour oh my in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight has he not raised us up in the third day come on somebody there had to be the unfolding of the just shall live by faith it had to be the unfolding of the sanctification and cleansing work through the blood for a vessel to be clean that he himself could move into and there the baptism of the Holy Ghost making way for the person of Jesus Christ the Son of man to step down himself in a black body our body that he himself a tabernacle that he has built he has built against opposition there has been answerís and Nehemiah's down through the ages but what was it he strengthened them lucky strengthens Judah he strengthens you and I then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning prepared it's already prepared that's the morning it's just everything getting in position and he shall come unto us as the rain as the Lateran former rain unto the earth here was Jacob out of the land he was over there his father-in-law Laban and Jacob was over there making money right brother Bram goes into it and he brother Ram will actually apply even that spirit of man and wisdom and he'll deal with that even with the Jews he said they know how to get every dollar don't see he said don't you try to make a deal with him they're all Fox you need a matter of fact brother BAM said see when Peter came by the gate called beautiful he said you know something happened to that Jew if he said silver and gold have I none he said the way they love money he said you know something happened to him are you with me so you begin to see that Jacob look at this in the parallel Jacob member he begin to get homesick and when he got homesick remember even he notices he notices the katniss of laman and the Brethren are turning against him now you find that this turning which was very obvious in the time of the Holocaust right you see that now where how the brother bran brings that out there of the tender hand of jehovah we see those things you know coming out I'll bring you home on the wings of an eagle we see that but a but you know when we look at that there had to be that necessary part even of that of the Zionist entering back into the land and those that would be moved by God what a paradox in that that language itself would be raised back up now you might look at it and say well it really wasn't necessary for the Hebrew language to be raised back up but if you notice what the Prophet tells us there in the fifth seal he said Jesus will speak there to the 144,000 in the Hebrew tongue it was necessary that that language be raised up I ask you wasn't it necessary for the language that have been here within the scriptures that had been lost and denominations had cut it out and substituted everything wasn't there an e for the pure language of the Holy Ghost to turn to the Church of the Living God once again once is their need for when seminaries and men have yanked it out of the scriptures but he said I will turn them again to a pure language God restoring the language of the bride in the South hello we know what we're talking about back his grace he has opened to us this language it's a real love language and it's not just a language of just words these words are expressive action words words that are filled with atonement words that bring relationship grow Robina God many returned under the Holocaust many returned there were those that were brought back but then you see that within it there are those even as we looked at it last week who are making their ally off their immigration they're coming back home and to look that even within this one I began to look at other things as I mentioned here last week they're giving given a free ticket for a one-way flight back home they're provided with temporary housing they are provided with with cash payments to actually sustain them and when they live in that temporary housing actually was looking at a few things for six months those who come back into the country there they are now under the instruction of the Hebrew language to learn that language say they never knew it before you and I'd know terms right now we never knew before but we've been under the tutorship of the Holy Ghost there's things we never knew before but now under the tutorship of the Holy Spirit what's it doing it's restoring us back to her you say this just seems like my native tongue it is your native tongue it my native tongue glory be to God oh ma I think of that you know even as I mentioned here last year Bibi Netanyahu saying we call on the mass absorption of Jewish immigration from Europe you realize all they have to do is have a grandparent that's a Jew when they step off the plane there is singing in the airports welcoming them back home and they go into a room like this and right there before leaving the airport they become citizens Wow a flight citizenship a token benefits you mean just like that we have access to all things freely given us all things so there's no doubt about it there is a multitude of Jews that have been and that are immigrating as I said last week when I begin to look at that word immigrate and immigrate is really in some ways it's similar but it's really different immigrate means you're focusing on the country in which you are going to and calling that country whole immigration means you focus more on the country that you're leaving what you think about that scripturally the Bible says that we are Pilgrims and strangers it says concerning Abraham and Sarah if they had been mindful of the country they came out of they might have had opportunity to return what you see when God brings us on Holly ah it is not looking back at what we got to give up and I gotta stop this and I know it's about him you see when you look back to what you got to do is still operating under that first selfish berth I got to do this and I don't know if I can do that and iiiiii it's to emigrate come home well I don't know get that eye out come home ah no come on homie emigrate now the think of this here there's no doubt that there's many men are coming there and you see them as they're coming in you can watch the different things and some of the the video things you know I look at with the news and different things and you see them coming in there being greeting was singing this ain't no dead thing there greet them there are people who has been organizing the events for them to come home this has been it's been going on for a long time now there's no doubt about it that buries those who are coming back that will not be part of Israel 144,000 but within it there is 144,000 see there's a mixed multitude coming up come on somebody you see this is where brother branham here he'll tell us even in the message recognizing your day in its message if you go to paragraph 83 there brother Brian he says why do they do that he's talking about them riding a paper fast pray fast pray fast pray that God will send the Prophet fast pray fast pray he goes on now at the opening a paragraph 83 and says why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing there will be an awakening some of the Gentiles they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride by being a Christian they feel the pull of the album that's why they can write songs that they write and it has more meaning to us let the sound son tonight waymaker it has more meaning to us well brother Simon I don't know about that I can't hack it I could take the rest of the night and on through the next day and everything else to show you songs where inspiration was poured out and it was poured out years before and then even that which was poured out during the time of that word that how that they would look back and take that song and they would apply to this time or then there would be inspiration that would break within that moment and that song would have prophecy but yet it would also have a divine application for that time you with me you see by being Christians they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something is supposed to happen notes like Israel they knew something was going to happen they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened right by you so there are those listen now when you think of these of the 144,000 moving in here into Israel and you look at how that many 30,000 in just a year's time they're actually looking at how things will be doubled now there is politicians that's looking at it in terms of let us get as many Israelites as we can so that you know we'll always have the solidarity to be a state and you know it'll be a a pushing out a crowding out and even think of his brother a sent me this video here the other day and I begin to watch it of how that a rabbi pointed out that we're here is Trump and he's talking to the Jews now you know that that Trump's had a lot of good you know among the Jews even from before he was elected he made promises and those promises were kept and remember now he stood right before those Jewish men and different ones before and just said once again and he talks to them in terms of for your country thought it was interesting the rabbi pointed out he said now think about it those of you who are Irish those of you who are when maybe let's say you know whatever your national wherever you're from he said would it not be an insult for somebody then instead of saying you Americans but rather they say those of you from Ireland after you've been here so long don't get what I'm saying but instead notice even how this is said for your country to recognize that this right here that for the Jews Israel is their country but I find it remarkable how that Rabbi went on to say that there are Jews rabbis included that they don't think of Israel as being home but there are some who say it's home you understand there's got to be certain things said and the persons they don't know about this let me just say like this don't try to make things that don't fit we don't need conspiracy theories to make the Word of God more credible we don't need a mixing around listen brother round didn't mix around he was led by the Spirit of God when he dealt with Eisenhower and Khrushchev it was led by the Spirit of God he wasn't trying to put things together you with me but to see that there's certain things let me tell you something there has to be certain things all glory there had to be certain things said about you and I think about it the Prophet here he is ministering in the seals he said I've just wait a minute he said I'm not going to call you Church no more I'm gonna call you brat that you might understand you see this is where your country there are things that have to be said in a certain way it has an effect upon things and we know that that's how it is on our life spiritually let me try to finish this here tonight Isaiah 54 1 I may just skip a little bit on these verses I was a a 54 one sing o barren pal that did it's not bear break forth into singing and cry loud thou but did it's not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the Lord he goes on to say in verse 4 fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed either be now confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame about youth and shalt not remember the reproach about widowhood anymore for that maker is thine husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and that Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shot this is a millennium shall he be called for the Lord verse 6 for the Lord hath called thee as a woman Forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith the Lord for a small moment have I forsaken me but with great mercies will I gather thee in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness I will have mercy on me saith the LORD thy Redeemer Hosea - I just got a skip move just a little bit Hosea 2 verse 14 therefore behold I will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her he's drawing Israel he's going to bring that hundred forty-four thousand into the wilderness what does wilderness mean it's to shut out everything around shut out everything around that he might want speak comfortably with her before God will allow the Nations to fully compass Jerusalem he seals them away first he strengthens them can't you see that in our lives before God would permit there of that testing and trial that would absolutely if we were just resting in our own intellects it would shake us away but he puts strength in us he strengthens us you know what I'm talking about the Bible says you endured a great flight of evictions let me just bring this here around and I will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of Achor for a door of hope you know what a core was about a core is where Aiken was stoned that which troubled Israel and prevented them from subduing the city of AI God said I'll remove the ungodliness glory and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth notice she sounds she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt let me just stop here if she's going to sing as it was in the days when she came up out of Egypt as in the days of her youth there's got to be a song and it's not a man-made song remember that song it was not Miriam who sang it first it was Moses the Prophet on the scene at that time he said I will sing unto the Lord the Lord he hath triumphed over the horse and his rider the Lord is my soul not words in it he is myself so she's gonna say see not he she then there's got to be some directors on the scene who's under the unction of the composer that can bring the harmony among the 144,000 are you with me so who is it that that brings this about that comes to a place to where that Israel will actually come in to that melodious singing it's under that and the two witnesses by the power of the word they open that sixth seal and the Israel the 144,000 they're coming under that word that's being ministered that same baptism of the Holy Ghost that's been preached to the Gentiles Israel coming under that you see what's going on right now it's like when you show up to a symphony or you show up if you've ever been to one and you know when you show up there there's a lot of things that you hear when you walk in the building you know I just went to another one and even though it was an elementary thing and I'm not talking about how they played but actually you hear him when they're there you know Silas and Briana then Silas was the one playing that night you walk in there and I remember it even when you know that I was in school you would walk in you walk into the to the room the orchestra room your ear you hear all sorts of them people tuning up their instruments they're they're getting them in tune and this one's over here playing and this one's over there playing this one's on the piano here and you know going through all these things what are they done they're getting ready for their performance God is assembling everything together he's getting ready to learn this song that only they can learn and let me tell you something you've learned a song that only you can learn only that which has been redeemed remember the angels can't sing the song the angels can say wow that's beautiful they can't sing it you know why because it's a song of experience your love or Jesus what care what provision Lord we can look and see this upon the israel's life or upon them Lord as you gather them you've never forgot about it the scripture we read their Lord and Zechariah you'd bring them through the scene make away through the river and you'd place them or Jesus how that father you've brought us through the sea of affliction you brought us sword everyone must cross through that River Jordan must be born of the Spirit of God or do you've not called us to a church we've not been called to a movement the Church of the Living God in this ours not even called to a station we're beckoned this is homegoing time this is time to be ready for our flight our soul has been translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of your dear son no longer I will be under the reign and domain of darkness but as Paul said you sometimes were darkness but now are you light and the Lord Lord we come and we look at this within Israel who is it that would call the people even great exodus from Europe what would cause them to uproot their families or do we know that it's a pool that's going on there is an election Israel to be saved or they've got to be in the homeland here was Simeon he was in Jerusalem he was waiting for the consolation he had been moved upon what would cause these what would cause them to do this to move to forsake everything or Daud we hear about it we know that there is an encroachment of those which absolutely hate the Jews as it was mentioned Lord and really the interviews many of them Lord have been bullied in everything else by the Muslims moving in there they have to in right there in France have to have guards guarding the schools there's some Lord as they stand there they say we don't want to leave but we have to leave it's the only way for our family Lorna yeah who knows maybe some of them Lord that I watched on that little documentary there maybe some of them are of those of that elect we don't know because Lord the real reality of it is we look at our own life when you begin to deal with our life even with things that you moved on our hearts when we were young but God as your prophet spoken like this he said many can fellowship with me on this point we knew there was a god somewhere with nil there was a reality something was pulling us we might have tried this and tried that but nothing could satisfy we didn't realize what that was that was the grace of God that would not allow us to get settled down in a place that was not our home or Jesus you know how to take every bit of comfort you pull the comfort out of the nest maybe there's some here tonight some that are streaming in Lord you're gone if they're still in the nest I pray God may the great eagle of the Holy Ghost stir that nest tonight Lord take out the feathers Lord take out the Comfort Lord Lord don't let him know there's wings there to fly may they Lord God in obedience to your word be removed out of that nest granny lord I pray play a film Lord with the Holy Ghost may there be such a hunger Lord such a desire Lord God for you Lord that goes beyond Lord God everything else but overrides Lord when they lay down to go to sleep at night Lord let it be that Lord like Jacob Lord where he can look and see the town that's changing toward him what God made me be able to look clearly and recognize Lord granting or God if it's friends turning on him Lord let friends turn on him lord if it's family let family turn on him Lord whatever it would be Lord o'clock to get their attention Lord God like that prodigal son if he does still had money to live it up it would have never struck his heart but his parents were praying for him and when his parents got to pray no doubt they pray to many many nights but they got through a place he had spent all his living and he began to remember ho ho ho Hall never changed it was him that changed but he needed to come back home Lord maybe there's one here tonight they need to come back home but here father the Spirit of God speaking to the high hearts come let us return unto the Lord or granite Lord God I pray Heavenly Father may they hear that of the hiss the signal the whistle the pipe of the Holy Ghost may they Lord God most importantly be obedient to that son in secret but you would gather them Lord or Jesus for a new is strength in u.s. authority you are our defense you're our defense or tonight the Bible is true and we are witnesses that many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them or Jesus maybe there's one tonight there in some low notes in their life they're not singing in a tenor Alto soprano mid-range but maybe they're in the bass right now but I pray Heavenly Father would you just move by your spirit and encourage them and let them know the song is not all low notes it's just a verse we're a part of the verse but the song is comprised of many notes that when blended together brings forth us what your the song of our lives you're the reason that we see you're not just a word in our song you are our lord we were like this of Israel Oh Lord we had so many layin lines there's so much ad-libbing that had been done and left the original sheet music but there had to be inspiration that would be poured out in this our spirit of grace will be poured out Lord God they would take these promises of the word that were being auctioned off left and right and that brick bowl of the Holy Spirit would take that of the promises of God's Holy Word and would begin to strike it and would bring forth the promises Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to show it is of the same value the same power Lord I asked tonight if there's one who does not know you in that resurrection pound they don't know you Lord God in that Lord God of that cleansing power of the new birth what God may this be their night may they Lord be gathered some that are setting may be here tonight or streaming Lord to where that in their hearts their being gathered maybe they're like those some that are leaving from Europe or God they have to start making a decision I think of the ambassadors Lord that I watched on the film men that are working right there upon the settlements in Samaria those who are working with this Ally off they go into these places in Europe and there are Jews that come together in a place they got questions but it shows their heart is being stirred and there's a man who lives in the land that can tell them about it or Jesus there's a man here tonight who can turn on the light I pray God that you would grant Ward our tonight in the name of Jesus Christ granite Lord granny Lord Jesus come here [Music] I'm coming [Music] [Applause] [Music]
