[33:01] a brother um
[33:02] leon van aard he's from
[33:05] south africa and he's

[33:09] just arranged it from when we were
[33:11] together
[33:12] in
[33:13] byc
[33:14] and then that's where we went we spoke
[33:17] their two services and then
[33:19] there was another brother that when
[33:22] i heard that i was coming down he asked
[33:24] if i would come over and speak the
[33:25] sunday evening service there so
[33:28] we
[33:28] we went there as well and then lord just
[33:31] really just moved in a very wonderful
[33:33] way
[33:34] on hearts and lives so i just appreciate
[33:36] your prayers because it was all
[33:38] all the working of the lord it's just
[33:40] wonderful when you see hearts just
[33:42] that god coming and god ministering to

[33:51] in their life and a renewing
[33:53] amen and healing so we just thank god
[33:56] for his mercy
[33:58] amen so i wanted just to pass along
[34:00] their greetings to you and just say
[34:02] thank you for your prayers
[34:04] let's look here in the scriptures
[34:07] in numbers 2 and number 6 and verse 22
[34:10] and
[34:12] just at the close of last thursday just
[34:15] this scripture as i was standing here
[34:16] these scriptures just pressed
[34:19] so deeply upon my heart and i'd like to
[34:21] just begin here
[34:23] remember we were referring to we were
[34:25] reading out of that last scripture of
[34:27] psalms 23 surely goodness and mercy
[34:30] shall follow me all the days of my life
[34:33] and i shall dwell in the house of the
[34:35] lord forever and you realize that that
[34:37] scripture
[34:38] when it speaks of it it's it's surely
[34:40] goodness and mercy is in pursuit of my
[34:43] life
[34:44] so not only is god going before us but
[34:47] the same god is also coming right behind
[34:50] us as well we are we are enclosed and
[34:53] enshrouded in the blood of jesus christ
[34:55] and i'm thankful for that
[34:57] amen so we want to just read here in
[34:59] verse 22.
[35:02] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[35:06] speak unto aaron
[35:08] and unto his son saying on this wise ye
[35:12] shall bless the children of israel
[35:14] saying unto them the lord bless thee
[35:17] and keep thee
[35:19] the lord make his face
[35:21] shine upon thee and be gracious unto
[35:24] thee
[35:25] the lord lift up his countenance upon
[35:29] thee and give thee peace
[35:31] and they shall put my name
[35:34] upon the children of israel
[35:36] and i will bless them
[35:38] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[35:40] of the word as you're being seated
[35:43] as we're speaking here on
[35:45] on the love of god
[35:48] i want to just say i don't know tonight
[35:50] if we'll be able to finish this this
[35:52] thought on the peace of god but
[35:55] as it relates here
[35:57] from that portion of scripture we've
[35:58] been looking at that love charity itself
[36:02] does not behave itself
[36:04] unseemly
[36:06] and i would say tonight it's just like
[36:08] in in in everything in our life that we
[36:13] are many times the way the of the
[36:15] victory in our life really
[36:18] depends on what we're really tapped into
[36:21] and what we're really drawing from
[36:23] because we understand that when when our
[36:26] lives when has been touched by god and
[36:28] we've been born
[36:30] of the spirit of god that's the victory
[36:32] of calvary that's the victory as john
[36:34] would write even our faith that
[36:36] overcometh the world
[36:38] and to realize that in our lives as
[36:40] believers i think that as we
[36:42] walk on with the lord we we realize more
[36:45] and more we see our shortcomings
[36:48] we know our weaknesses very well
[36:50] and we are constantly we're looking to
[36:53] the lord that god would continue to give
[36:55] us grace and it's things that we want to
[36:58] continue to grow and we realize that
[37:00] many times there's things about now how
[37:02] god is placed within our lives it's it's
[37:05] up for us and god entrusts us to keep
[37:07] our lives in a place to where it's
[37:09] enriched and under the effect and the
[37:12] influence of the holy spirit in our life
[37:15] and you know when we look at this here
[37:18] in in in number six i want you to notice
[37:21] the order and just thinking of this of
[37:23] even in a home in many places where it
[37:25] could apply
[37:26] that the bible says the lord spake to
[37:28] moses and then moses was to speak this
[37:31] to aaron and to his sons and this was to
[37:35] be spoken
[37:36] this blessing upon the children of
[37:39] israel and to think of how you know when
[37:42] you think of how that uh the presence of
[37:45] god would move down and to recognize
[37:48] even uh the time that we're living and
[37:50] we realize that there's no there's no
[37:53] true reality outside of the holy spirit
[37:57] there's no true reality outside of god's
[38:00] word being made real and being made
[38:03] known when the holy spirit gets a hold
[38:05] of the word and he begins to speak to
[38:07] our life it's it's just a it's a divine
[38:10] connection between us and god as god
[38:13] begins to deal with us and you can sit
[38:14] here in a service and uh and you realize
[38:17] it's as though that you it's just you
[38:19] and god alone and god's just speaking
[38:21] right down to where you're at it's like
[38:23] he's calling your address out and and
[38:25] what's great about that is when our
[38:27] heart can just respond and say yes lord
[38:31] that's me lord i i want to identify with
[38:34] that lord be it unto me
[38:36] that's submitting to the word and
[38:38] allowing the word to have preeminence
[38:40] allowing the word to take the lead and
[38:42] the direction in our life and and that's
[38:45] exactly what god was even speaking here
[38:48] to moses and i think of that scripture
[38:50] in the book of psalms when it says how
[38:52] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[38:55] together in unity and david would write
[38:59] this by inspiration he says it's like
[39:01] that of that precious oil that was
[39:04] poured out upon the head of aaron and it
[39:08] ran down his beard it ran down his
[39:10] garments you see what started with the
[39:13] head moved down in the body
[39:17] and what what greater union and showing
[39:19] that there's no unity
[39:22] really outside of the holy spirit
[39:24] man can have unity but it's not a true
[39:27] unity but the holy spirit is what brings
[39:30] a real unity and a real harmony because
[39:34] there's a power the love of god that
[39:37] lays within that of the holy spirit to
[39:39] unify him and god was giving that of a
[39:43] direction there of how that this
[39:46] unifying it would symbolize that of
[39:48] christ and the bride it would be a
[39:51] symbolizing of the message that would go
[39:54] forth for every age it would be a
[39:57] symbolizing of how that every local
[39:59] assembly is to be and god's desire for
[40:02] every marriage and every home because it
[40:06] almost it there has to be a source and
[40:09] it takes god himself god is the one who
[40:13] releases of his life into the church of
[40:17] the living god
[40:18] and it's that life that brings that
[40:21] unity and you think of how that every
[40:23] time when we look at the peace of god
[40:26] you you you read every letter that's
[40:30] paul would be moved by the spirit of god
[40:32] or peter and you read some of the very
[40:34] first words that are mentioned to the
[40:36] saints of god and it would start out
[40:38] with grace and peace be multiplied unto
[40:42] you
[40:43] in how that john would stand there on
[40:46] the isle of patmos and here john would
[40:48] come with that very same announcement
[40:51] grace and peace uh be unto you from he
[40:55] which was which is which is to come from
[40:58] the seven spirits that are before the
[40:59] throne and from jesus christ the
[41:02] faithful witness from the dead so it's
[41:06] all coming down that the peace of god
[41:08] there's one place for real peace and
[41:11] that's from god
[41:12] it's not a peace that the world itself
[41:15] gives and so when we we look at this
[41:18] here
[41:19] in psalms 29 verse 11 just to think of
[41:22] how that david would write this by
[41:24] inspiration because all through the old
[41:26] testament god prophesied that there was
[41:29] going to be peace that would be coming
[41:32] to that even of israel and god also made
[41:36] known that there was that of a peace
[41:39] that was coming that would be a peace
[41:41] upon earth and we recognize that god
[41:44] every promise that god has made it's up
[41:47] to god to fulfill it
[41:50] now to think how god would place this
[41:52] here i'm just going to read this
[41:53] scripture in psalms 29 11 the lord will
[41:56] give strength unto his people and the
[41:59] lord will bless his people with peace
[42:02] i don't think there's anything greater
[42:04] than peace
[42:06] the peace of god is the is the greatest
[42:09] blessing that a mortal could ever have
[42:12] is to know that their soul and their
[42:14] life is at peace with god you can face
[42:17] anything that the devil could try to
[42:19] throw your way
[42:21] because you've got a peace you're tapped
[42:22] into a peace that as paul would write
[42:25] that passes all understanding meaning
[42:27] that it doesn't even make sense to your
[42:30] understanding of how that you can have
[42:33] such a peace in the midst of a
[42:35] circumstance like this
[42:37] but god is the one who gives peace to
[42:40] you and i i'll tell you if there ever
[42:42] was a time and an hour then we need
[42:44] peace it's right now
[42:46] there's always where satan is always as
[42:49] an agent to try to take peace and
[42:51] disrupt peace from the children of god
[42:54] to try to take peace from the family try
[42:56] to take peace from a marriage try to
[42:58] take peace from a believer you realize
[43:01] that even when a sickness comes and you
[43:03] might have had a report and then you've
[43:04] got to wait for these results to come in
[43:06] you realize what happens is a spirit of
[43:09] torment that tries to get in there and
[43:11] tries to do what trying to remove peace
[43:14] from your life and what if this has come
[43:16] out and what if this comes about
[43:18] satan is always against the peace of god
[43:22] because the peace of god is is that
[43:25] which it invites and it's god's presence
[43:27] moving within the life of a child of god
[43:30] but satan is always always against peace
[43:35] when you think about how brother adam
[43:37] tells us that even among those nations
[43:39] and he talks about how that there's a
[43:41] demon power there that is controlling
[43:43] each nation and brother says they can't
[43:46] even get along with one another and
[43:48] they'll get stirred up with one another
[43:49] and fighting one another satan's kingdom
[43:52] is not a kingdom of peace
[43:57] satan's kingdom is a kingdom of hatred
[44:00] he don't want to present itself as love
[44:02] and you know and then all these words
[44:05] you know that are nothing but lies when
[44:07] it wants to put it out of tolerance i
[44:09] remember when i first started going into
[44:10] i was in teaching and two years before i
[44:12] graduated and i had to take a a class
[44:15] and and i i didn't like that class at
[44:18] all some of the stuff that they wanted
[44:19] to bring out and everything they wanted
[44:21] to put this word was the word that they
[44:24] wanted to push is the word tolerance you
[44:27] know that's a word that the roman
[44:28] catholic system when they went into
[44:30] every nation and they wanted to try to
[44:32] blend unity among religions that is a
[44:35] word that they use from eons ago is
[44:38] tolerance but in reality satan ain't
[44:41] tolerant of nothing
[44:43] there is no tolerance it's simply that's
[44:46] my way or the highway
[44:49] and then we recognize if this is not the
[44:51] peace that god calls for you see even
[44:55] when there's nations that try to gain
[44:57] peace and you know brother brown tells
[44:59] us she said you don't gain peace by
[45:01] trying to buy out friends
[45:04] that's that's not real peace you you've
[45:06] got to keep shelling out but a real but
[45:08] but this of a real peace it's something
[45:11] that comes from god and god alone i want
[45:13] you to look here in isaiah chapter 9
[45:16] verse 6 here isaiah writes of the
[45:18] promise and he says for unto us a child
[45:21] is born unto us a son is given and the
[45:24] government shall be upon his shoulder
[45:27] and his name shall be called wonderful
[45:29] counselor the mighty god the everlasting
[45:32] father the prince of peace what a title
[45:36] that the lord jesus this title as the
[45:39] prince of peace
[45:42] of the increase look at this of the
[45:44] increase of his government and peace
[45:47] there shall be no end upon the throne of
[45:50] david and upon his kingdom to order it
[45:53] and to establishment with judgment and
[45:55] with justice from henceforth even
[45:57] forever the zeal of the lord of hosts
[45:59] will perform this
[46:01] so this peace that isaiah
[46:04] was privileged by the spirit of god to
[46:06] begin to prophesy
[46:08] of this peace
[46:10] this was a peace that would would be
[46:12] brought to the earth by the prince of
[46:14] peace himself by god himself
[46:17] condescending
[46:19] and taking upon an earthly an earthly
[46:22] veil that he himself prepared for
[46:24] himself to come down and bring this
[46:28] peace to earth because there were lives
[46:31] on earth that were in need of peace
[46:34] lives like you and i that here to come
[46:36] years later would be desiring the very
[46:39] peace of almighty god and you know when
[46:42] you think about it brother brian
[46:44] mentioned it when he was here uh within
[46:46] leading the song service of how desires
[46:48] and things that that people would have
[46:51] and what it is it's a craving it's a
[46:53] longing for peace it's a longing for
[46:55] satisfaction but there's only one can
[46:58] satisfy that thirst that god put in you
[47:01] and that is god himself where god alone
[47:05] is the one who brings peace into a life
[47:09] oh my and of that peace as it says here
[47:11] in verse seven there there is no end to
[47:14] that peace look at the ministry of john
[47:16] the baptist here this the advent of
[47:18] peace coming upon the earth the bible
[47:21] says in luke 1 79 here was concerning
[47:24] john to give light to them that set in
[47:26] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[47:28] guide our feet into the way of peace now
[47:31] i want you to lock in on this now
[47:33] because bringing this down to where it
[47:35] will go in our lunch box notice god's
[47:38] word coming on the scene his revealed
[47:40] word of what it was going to do it was
[47:43] to uh to guide us into the way of peace
[47:47] notice in luke chapter 2 verse 14
[47:50] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[47:54] peace
[47:55] good will toward men brother braham said
[47:58] in the message shalom he says he said
[48:00] listen he said when this full bible has
[48:03] been thoroughly vindicated then will
[48:04] come in eternal shalom
[48:06] and eternal peace he come and said he
[48:09] was peace on earth good will towards man
[48:13] but the world didn't receive it he was
[48:16] peace to everyone that come to him for
[48:19] peace
[48:20] that's a big thing he was peace to
[48:23] everybody that would come to him for
[48:26] peace
[48:26] you can't find one one place in the
[48:28] scripture where there were those when
[48:31] they would come to the lord jesus for
[48:33] peace whether it's you know the woman
[48:34] with the issue of blood whether it was
[48:36] you know the the man that we know by the
[48:38] maniac of gadara when that cry was gone
[48:41] out across the sea
[48:42] anyone who came to him for that of peace
[48:46] and received that peace that he gave
[48:48] their lives were set at peace but there
[48:50] were those who stood right face to face
[48:53] with him and they rejected the peace of
[48:57] almighty god as it stood right there in
[48:59] their midst whether it was the courier
[49:01] that went to invite him to simon's house
[49:03] or any of the pharisees they rejected
[49:06] the very peace of almighty god
[49:09] but there were those who received it he
[49:11] was peace to everyone that come to him
[49:14] for peace oh my this is the kind of
[49:16] testimony that we want to be
[49:19] is that right is that what's the kind of
[49:21] testimony to be peace for anybody who
[49:24] would come to us
[49:26] is that right peace on earth good will
[49:28] to men he was the peace at that new year
[49:31] beginning that new day of god for why he
[49:34] was the vindicated light of that day but
[49:37] there's more word to be vindicated he's
[49:40] got to vindicate more word and when the
[49:42] last word is vindicated
[49:45] rather then death is swallowed up in
[49:47] victory and the dead in christ shall
[49:49] rise shall rise the millennium will set
[49:51] in and it will be one great peace shalom
[49:55] let's live for that day brother and
[49:57] sister for that one great shalom
[50:00] so how do we live for that for that
[50:03] eternal shalom is to first have that
[50:06] eternal shalom within our lives
[50:09] to where we ourselves are drawing from
[50:12] that eternal shalom that eternal peace
[50:15] that then our lives are regarded as
[50:18] lives of peace
[50:22] think about this when the lord jesus
[50:23] would speak about the holy ghost and the
[50:26] coming of the comforter he would say it
[50:28] in this manner in verse 27 peace i leave
[50:32] with you my peace i give unto you not as
[50:36] the world giveth give unto you now think
[50:38] about it the peace i leave with you you
[50:41] know they were troubled when he was
[50:43] crucified but when he appeared there to
[50:46] them after his resurrection and began to
[50:48] gather them from mary magdalene to those
[50:51] on the road to emmaus and then appeared
[50:53] then he was invited in and he broke the
[50:55] bread as he did before and then he was
[50:57] with them there for that space of about
[50:59] 40 days brother and sister he was
[51:02] leaving his peace with them they were
[51:04] gathered there to the word you see god
[51:07] was vindicating the word and he was
[51:10] there as as an agent as the vessel that
[51:13] identified god was vindicating his word
[51:16] and that brought peace to them as
[51:18] believers so much so that the bible says
[51:21] in the book of luke that they went to
[51:22] the upper room rejoicing
[51:26] this was before the holy ghost come why
[51:28] because they realized the promise was
[51:32] certain
[51:33] you see this is why god as he comes to
[51:36] work with a life before any promise can
[51:38] ever come to pass in our life it god
[51:41] comes to settle us in a place remember
[51:44] faith brother brown would describe it
[51:45] like this faith is a settled something
[51:48] and so what brings that settling is the
[51:51] very peace of almighty god there's
[51:53] nothing that will bring peace in a
[51:55] situation outside of the word of god
[51:58] being vindicated and made real in our
[52:00] life it brings a settledness it brings a
[52:02] peace it brings where you and i as
[52:04] brother bran told us regarding over and
[52:06] over with abraham abraham could go ahead
[52:08] and ask sarah how are you feeling any
[52:10] different today no i don't feel no
[52:12] different but he could rejoice why he
[52:14] had the peace of god by the faith of god
[52:18] that when the situation that anything
[52:20] that would be contrary he was abiding in
[52:23] the peace of almighty god
[52:25] oh my he was there in his home he
[52:28] brought peace right into that situation
[52:30] think about it that even in a situation
[52:32] that was a situation of even uh you know
[52:36] when we look at it that he says my peace
[52:38] i give to you not as the world giveth
[52:41] give i unto you let not your heart be
[52:43] troubled neither let it be afraid
[52:46] now you know
[52:47] it don't take it don't take a rocket
[52:49] scientist to know that the world
[52:52] paul wrote about this how that the world
[52:54] would say peace and safety he said and
[52:57] then come a sudden destruction
[53:00] because the world doesn't hold the
[53:02] announcement for peace
[53:06] amen that's only that's that's in god's
[53:08] that's in god's economy because satan is
[53:10] not the author of peace
[53:12] think of how the world will do my
[53:14] goodness i mean you just see the i mean
[53:17] some of the foolishness you know that
[53:18] even that even when you look at it even
[53:20] now and you try to look at things i mean
[53:22] you know it's just like how things are
[53:25] just so you know bombarding one to
[53:27] another with even some of the recent
[53:29] things they put out there and and you
[53:31] know go do this and go do that and well
[53:33] if you do this you know we're gonna put
[53:35] this out there in an article and you you
[53:37] got things on all sorts of things even
[53:39] when it's dealing with the virus and
[53:41] things like that that's present and you
[53:43] see there are things that it'll put out
[53:45] something to try to settle people
[53:47] haven't done that a lot lately but then
[53:49] they'll try and then they'll come
[53:51] something else along and try to stir
[53:52] them up why that's a piece that the
[53:55] world gives
[53:56] but the peace that comes from god is a
[53:59] peace that passes all understanding it
[54:01] doesn't matter what kind of report is
[54:04] being aired you've got peace
[54:10] it isn't because of you or me it's
[54:12] because of god
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:15] not because of what this world has to
[54:17] offer
[54:19] you know whether they find a cure or
[54:21] whatever more for covet but the believer
[54:23] you've got peace
[54:26] you've got peace within your life to to
[54:28] know that god is in control
[54:31] and satan's desire is to try to disrupt
[54:34] that peace and and try to hinder that
[54:36] and try to block that but brother and
[54:37] sister we think about it just like
[54:40] gideon when god spoke to gideon this is
[54:43] where god reveals himself as jehovah
[54:46] shalom is right there with gideon and
[54:48] gideon was in a situation he was afraid
[54:52] are you hearing me now
[54:53] we're just going to run with it he was
[54:55] afraid and he was out there threshing
[54:57] wheat behind so he couldn't be seen
[55:00] because the medianites had been showing
[55:02] up and taken the wheat every time they
[55:05] would wait until they got right about
[55:07] time for that harvest to come in and
[55:10] here they came right on time let me tell
[55:11] you something we know this as believers
[55:14] the devil knows exactly how to try to
[55:16] come and bring trouble and to try to
[55:18] trouble our mind try to trouble the
[55:20] whole satan knows about it but as a
[55:23] believer we're not ignorant of satan's
[55:26] devices
[55:28] come on friends this is why we need the
[55:30] discernment of the holy spirit in this
[55:32] hour god has not left us
[55:35] god has not left us in a place to where
[55:37] we're wandering and going about and
[55:39] running here and running there but god
[55:42] has prepared and he continues to build
[55:44] the faith of the believer in this hour
[55:47] that no matter what circumstances come
[55:49] about our faith is in the living god my
[55:52] faith is not in my age my faith is not
[55:55] in my substance my faith is in the
[55:57] living god he said i'll never leave you
[56:00] nor forsake you that's where the
[56:03] believer's faith is resting in the
[56:05] living god
[56:08] glory be to god
[56:10] john here gideon had a meeting with god
[56:13] and god come down and begin to speak to
[56:16] him the things that the prophet who had
[56:19] been speaking about now the angel of the
[56:21] lord followed the message of the prophet
[56:24] and begin to take that message and begin
[56:27] to come to those and say you are the
[56:29] ones that the prophet was speaking about
[56:32] if i can paraphrase it in that way
[56:34] and gideon was looking me yeah you sure
[56:38] you got the right address a mighty man
[56:40] of valor but god wasn't looking at a
[56:42] scaredy-cat what god was recognizing if
[56:45] you go by yourself you'll always be
[56:47] afraid
[56:49] you'll be afraid of this you'll be
[56:50] afraid of that you'll be afraid of this
[56:52] this will come up you'll be afraid but
[56:54] god said a mighty man of valor is where
[56:56] that man becomes surrendered he becomes
[56:59] glory be to god he becomes so settled
[57:03] and with such a confidence in the living
[57:05] god that is vindicating himself right
[57:08] there before him that gideon surrendered
[57:10] his life and now gideon would go forth
[57:14] as a mighty man of valor because he met
[57:16] the man of valor himself the living god
[57:19] the strength of the living god so it
[57:21] wasn't gideon's great dna it was a
[57:24] mighty god that gideon met that gave him
[57:27] strength and courage
[57:29] and peace
[57:32] to wage war
[57:34] on the midianites
[57:36] i think no nothing can give peace like
[57:38] god right
[57:40] you can go to all the shopping trips you
[57:41] want it'll never give peace
[57:43] it'll give you a big bill but it'll
[57:45] never give you peace
[57:47] is that right now notice this not that's
[57:49] the world giveth
[57:51] but this is this piece give i
[57:55] you
[57:56] in john 16 33
[57:58] these things have i spoken unto you that
[58:01] in me
[58:02] ye might have peace
[58:04] that's the only place of peace
[58:06] is in the lord jesus
[58:09] he's identifying that this place now see
[58:12] he's going to go away
[58:13] to prepare
[58:15] he's going to go away he must go away in
[58:18] order to open up the pathway
[58:21] that the disciples and every believer
[58:24] might come into this place of peace
[58:28] glory be to god
[58:30] oh my
[58:31] now notice in the world
[58:34] you shall have what
[58:37] oh
[58:39] but be of good cheer i've overcome the
[58:41] world
[58:42] so
[58:42] coming in him is where we have peace in
[58:45] him
[58:46] but in the world we have tribulation
[58:48] you can have you have peace within your
[58:50] life once the life of god has come in by
[58:54] the baptism of the holy ghost you have
[58:56] peace in your life but out here in the
[58:58] rest of the world there can be chaos
[59:00] going on all around you you can have
[59:02] afflictions you can have doctors reports
[59:04] you can have all sorts of things that
[59:06] are going around but yet down within the
[59:08] midst of your soul there is a peace that
[59:12] passes all understanding to where how is
[59:15] this going to come out i don't know but
[59:16] god is going to bring me through this as
[59:18] a matter of fact i'm going to go ahead
[59:20] and confess he is a high priest in my
[59:22] profession god is working it out right
[59:25] now i may not see it but that don't mean
[59:28] that the east wind ain't blowing i'm
[59:30] standing right here i'm going to speak
[59:32] to my mountain i'm going to speak to
[59:34] that adversary and let the resurrection
[59:37] wind of almighty god come down and open
[59:40] up a wave
[59:42] what does that in a believer it's the
[59:44] peace of almighty god that passes all
[59:47] understanding
[59:49] oh my we're not free of trouble we're
[59:51] not free of these things
[59:53] god never promised or you won't get
[59:55] cancer or this won't come you know
[59:56] people sometimes they live their lives
[59:58] you and i've both seen it people that
[1:00:00] live their lives trying to avoid things
[1:00:03] are you with me
[1:00:05] i mean you get people that men they want
[1:00:07] to avoid i don't want you know i don't
[1:00:09] want my family having cancer so i they
[1:00:12] they can't eat any ketchup that's got
[1:00:14] high fructose corn syrup
[1:00:16] ain't no look there ain't nothing wrong
[1:00:18] with it but when some things become a
[1:00:19] religion then the question becomes are
[1:00:22] we living by faith are we living by fear
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:26] [Music]
[1:00:27] is that right
[1:00:28] how many times we're praying the bible
[1:00:30] says that let nothing be received but
[1:00:33] through prayer and thanksgiving
[1:00:35] let it be sanctified is that right
[1:00:38] hey listen we've depended on god this
[1:00:40] far i ain't about to stop trusting in
[1:00:42] him he's brought me safe this far he'll
[1:00:45] take us the rest of the way
[1:00:48] amen it ain't the time to back up and
[1:00:50] start wandering and start looking around
[1:00:52] sometimes the things that we call wisdom
[1:00:55] and things that's promoted as wisdom it
[1:00:57] ain't wisdom it's fear that's trying to
[1:01:00] work but never is a child of god to be
[1:01:03] motivated by fear we are to be occupied
[1:01:06] with the peace of almighty god
[1:01:15] we got a trouble all around us but in
[1:01:17] him we have peace
[1:01:21] this is why paul could write regarding
[1:01:23] this life
[1:01:24] he says in romans 8 6
[1:01:26] to for to be carnally minded is death
[1:01:28] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:01:31] peace
[1:01:33] our nature has been changed this minded
[1:01:35] is where our very desire that pulsates
[1:01:38] from our life is life and peace
[1:01:42] that there's for a real for a believer
[1:01:44] there's nothing that you can stand to
[1:01:46] come between you and god it ain't about
[1:01:48] do's and don'ts the desire within your
[1:01:50] heart is i want to please him
[1:01:53] i love him i don't do it because i can't
[1:01:56] do it i could do it but i don't want to
[1:01:58] do those things i want to do those
[1:01:59] things that please him
[1:02:03] amen it's spiritually minded our lives
[1:02:05] have been changed
[1:02:07] it's a desire that god has quickened and
[1:02:09] raised up to be spiritually minded his
[1:02:12] life and peace notice paul would write
[1:02:14] in ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 for he
[1:02:18] is our peace amen right so our peace is
[1:02:22] a person
[1:02:24] the person of the lord jesus christ
[1:02:27] when he send my peace i leave with you
[1:02:29] he left them his word and his word is
[1:02:32] his promise his word is his seal his
[1:02:35] word his commitment and god honors his
[1:02:39] word oh my if you could just take the
[1:02:41] promise of god tonight no matter what
[1:02:43] the promise is and begin to take that
[1:02:45] promise and begin to draw from the
[1:02:47] living god and say god this is a promise
[1:02:50] you made and maybe i'm not in the shape
[1:02:52] to receive it right now but i'm going to
[1:02:54] draw from el shaddai till my life is so
[1:02:57] lined up and in a place lord god that
[1:03:00] matches for the fulfillment of that word
[1:03:02] to take place why because he's a god and
[1:03:05] he will not lie he always confirms every
[1:03:09] single word
[1:03:11] he is our peace
[1:03:16] hallelujah new news channel is our peace
[1:03:20] good lord the cdc ain't our peace either
[1:03:24] come on friends
[1:03:26] they change their mind as much as you
[1:03:27] change your mind about what you order in
[1:03:29] a restaurant and then you say you know i
[1:03:31] wish i'd got this
[1:03:33] stick around the wind changed i'm not
[1:03:35] disregarding any faith i'm trying to say
[1:03:37] he alone is our peace
[1:03:41] we've got to have a source of peace come
[1:03:44] on now some people draw their peace from
[1:03:46] their bank account
[1:03:49] but panting a lasting peace
[1:03:52] that's a temporal material faith
[1:03:56] i'm talking about one who's a friend
[1:03:58] that's sticking closer than a brother
[1:04:01] i'm talking about he is our peace
[1:04:08] think about what he did
[1:04:10] who hath made both one hath broken down
[1:04:13] the middle wall of partition between us
[1:04:15] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[1:04:18] even the law of commandments contained
[1:04:20] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[1:04:22] twain one new man so making peace
[1:04:28] oh my
[1:04:29] right there at the river jordan peace
[1:04:31] was being sounded out
[1:04:33] peace was already been declared at the
[1:04:35] birth but now god
[1:04:37] had united with his word
[1:04:40] in redemption
[1:04:42] you realize every one of us were already
[1:04:44] represented there in christ
[1:04:47] is that right when the word became flesh
[1:04:50] we were a part of the word
[1:04:52] always
[1:04:54] and when the word was made flesh brother
[1:04:56] them said we were transferred from the
[1:04:58] loins of god's mind to the lords of
[1:05:01] jesus
[1:05:04] you want to know how a believer will act
[1:05:06] with the word what about levi and
[1:05:09] abraham levi paid ties to melchizedek
[1:05:12] while he was in the loins of abraham you
[1:05:15] want to know how the bridal act the
[1:05:17] bride will act the same way as the
[1:05:18] groove because the bride was there in
[1:05:21] class the whole time
[1:05:23] hallelujah
[1:05:25] glory to god i felt like preaching but i
[1:05:27] gotta stay here thank you father
[1:05:30] man i'll tell you i feel like running
[1:05:32] all over the building
[1:05:34] praise god but you know i have to kind
[1:05:37] of behave myself and preacher you all do
[1:05:38] sitting here going wow brother sam's
[1:05:40] getting a good blessing in me
[1:05:43] but that excites me
[1:05:45] he made peace
[1:05:50] we desire there was a longing there
[1:05:52] would be a longing for us but he made
[1:05:55] peace
[1:05:57] by becoming
[1:05:59] me
[1:06:00] by becoming you
[1:06:02] he
[1:06:03] made
[1:06:04] peace
[1:06:06] and that he might reconcile both unto
[1:06:08] god in one body by the cross having
[1:06:10] slain the enmity thereby and came and
[1:06:13] preached peace to you which were afar
[1:06:16] off and to them that were nine
[1:06:19] now you might look at it you know think
[1:06:21] about you know when we recognize when
[1:06:23] the preaching of the peace of god has
[1:06:25] come to our life
[1:06:27] god comes and brings correction don't he
[1:06:29] but you see the peace of god
[1:06:31] is not that that pats us on the back
[1:06:35] it's not that that tells us how good we
[1:06:36] are because
[1:06:37] what it is that's been going on in our
[1:06:39] life is a war
[1:06:42] when a person let me just let me preach
[1:06:44] now is this coming as a person has a
[1:06:46] seed of god on the inside there's a
[1:06:49] desire to serve god
[1:06:51] is that right but that old nature is
[1:06:54] still there it's influenced by all the
[1:06:56] things of the world
[1:06:58] but it's only it's only by god that can
[1:07:01] bring a real release to that inner man
[1:07:04] to where that desire becomes a full
[1:07:07] living reality
[1:07:09] because before that there's a war
[1:07:11] internally that's going on i'm talking
[1:07:13] about in the soul but there's only one
[1:07:15] that can settle that war in the soul
[1:07:18] you'll have the battle in the mind are
[1:07:20] you with me now
[1:07:21] we got a war like brother branson says
[1:07:22] war constantly with this thing right
[1:07:24] here is that right but in the soul there
[1:07:28] the war itself where the battle is in
[1:07:30] the soul he came that that battle might
[1:07:33] be dissolved and that victory might come
[1:07:36] to that life and what happens when
[1:07:38] there's a victory there's a peace treaty
[1:07:40] that's me brother the peace of the world
[1:07:43] those things can come and go
[1:07:45] this nation can be at peace with this
[1:07:48] nation and then after a period of time
[1:07:50] no longer peace but not so with god and
[1:07:53] a believer all the peace of god is so
[1:07:56] real it's so sure it's so great it's a
[1:07:59] seal of the living god that even the
[1:08:02] enemy cannot break that peace the enemy
[1:08:04] wants to try to take it away but even in
[1:08:07] the midst of the storm there is still
[1:08:10] peace in the life of the believer i say
[1:08:13] greater is he that is in us than he
[1:08:15] that's in the world
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:22] he came and preached peace to us
[1:08:25] he brought us
[1:08:26] the goodness of god led us to repentance
[1:08:29] is that right
[1:08:30] he brought he brought us to a place
[1:08:32] because there was a longing in our life
[1:08:35] to have real peace
[1:08:38] now i want you to think of this here
[1:08:40] in isaiah 52
[1:08:43] how beautiful
[1:08:45] upon the mountains
[1:08:47] or the feet of him
[1:08:48] that bringeth good tidings
[1:08:51] that publisheth peace
[1:08:54] that bringeth good tidings of good
[1:08:56] that publisheth salvation that saith
[1:08:59] unto zion thy god
[1:09:01] reigneth
[1:09:03] i want you to think how god
[1:09:05] would so place this because you find
[1:09:07] paul picks this up and referencing you
[1:09:09] know of the gentiles and then we also
[1:09:11] know this promise they'll be that to the
[1:09:13] to the jews when the those two witnesses
[1:09:15] step out and they will be themselves
[1:09:18] publishers of peace
[1:09:20] they will be preaching the same
[1:09:22] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:24] they'll be preaching let me just put it
[1:09:26] like this they'll be preaching the same
[1:09:27] message
[1:09:29] that we are preaching
[1:09:31] because the message that we have
[1:09:32] received is that of the fullness to call
[1:09:34] us back to the true atonement
[1:09:36] call us beyond traditions and isms of
[1:09:39] man and and self-sacrificing here or
[1:09:42] this and that but it calls us back to a
[1:09:44] complete rest in the perfect atonement
[1:09:47] about perfect blood that brings a
[1:09:48] perfect peace within a life
[1:09:50] [Applause]
[1:09:51] think about this the feet
[1:09:53] you know the feet
[1:09:56] can be looked at when one of the most
[1:09:58] unbecoming parts of the body remember
[1:10:00] paul said there are uncomely parts i
[1:10:02] mean think about it right
[1:10:04] sometimes
[1:10:06] some of the most expensive clothing
[1:10:08] items we we adorn
[1:10:10] is to cover our ugly feet
[1:10:13] is that right
[1:10:15] don't worry you're young they get older
[1:10:18] well we won't go there
[1:10:20] but you know it's uncommonly parts that
[1:10:22] paul talked about think about it we
[1:10:24] beautify
[1:10:27] but how god was writing this here that
[1:10:30] there's nothing more beautiful than feet
[1:10:33] that have been adorned with the peace of
[1:10:36] almighty god
[1:10:37] in other words our life where we go and
[1:10:40] where we go and where we live from the
[1:10:42] peace of god it is there with us and the
[1:10:45] peace of god when we leave the peace of
[1:10:47] god is to be right there as well
[1:10:50] is that right when we go into a place we
[1:10:52] don't go into a place and leave it worse
[1:10:54] than when we got there
[1:10:56] is that right to think to the beauty of
[1:10:58] our lives the beauty of our lives as
[1:11:00] believers is the peace of god that we've
[1:11:03] experienced in our lives by the holy
[1:11:05] ghost
[1:11:07] it's taken an uncomely part of our life
[1:11:10] and beautified it with his own life
[1:11:14] because he is our peace there's no
[1:11:16] greater beauty in our life than to be
[1:11:17] adorned with the peace of almighty god
[1:11:20] with christ himself
[1:11:22] so you know what that makes us that
[1:11:24] makes us publishers of peace
[1:11:27] we've been commissioned to be publishers
[1:11:30] of peace
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:32] oh my it don't mean you printing books
[1:11:35] it means our lives
[1:11:37] our lives that are going to publish
[1:11:39] peace lives that that witness of the
[1:11:41] peace of god that we've received
[1:11:44] lives that cultivate peace notice you
[1:11:46] see
[1:11:47] even when the dove descended there from
[1:11:50] from the heavens when they were open and
[1:11:52] it descended down there at the river
[1:11:54] jordan there was a a proclamation that
[1:11:57] was going on because the dove itself is
[1:12:00] a symbol of peace anywhere you go any
[1:12:02] nation the dove is a symbol of peace
[1:12:09] oh my to think of this
[1:12:11] matthew 5 9 let's try to draw here just
[1:12:14] for a few moments
[1:12:17] blessed
[1:12:20] are
[1:12:21] the troublemakers
[1:12:25] stinksters
[1:12:28] i don't know what version of the bible
[1:12:30] that is
[1:12:31] blessed are the peacemakers
[1:12:36] for they shall be called
[1:12:38] the children of god
[1:12:45] you know brother bahamut when he talks
[1:12:47] about this of a of a life being a
[1:12:49] peacemaker
[1:12:50] he says you know he says
[1:12:53] within a man who is is in that place
[1:12:56] i don't care what the world says and
[1:12:58] what you say about him you try to make
[1:13:00] him mad he won't get mad i don't care
[1:13:02] how much you talk about him he won't pay
[1:13:04] no attention to it he'll go on because
[1:13:06] he's got a blessing in there he'll pray
[1:13:08] for you you might do anything in the
[1:13:10] world he'll never pay no attention to it
[1:13:13] he won't back bite his neighbors and go
[1:13:15] around and stir up trouble he'll be a
[1:13:17] peacemaker he'll do everything he can
[1:13:20] for he's a child of god and blessed is
[1:13:22] that man
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] amen you know sometimes stirring up
[1:13:28] trouble is just simply repeating things
[1:13:29] that you ought not to repeat
[1:13:33] you see a tail bearer is one that just
[1:13:35] keeps on carrying something but you know
[1:13:36] there's sometimes there's things that
[1:13:38] can come to you that you want to let
[1:13:39] your life be the ending of it
[1:13:43] then i'm not going to pass this on i'm
[1:13:44] not going to be a conduit that keeps
[1:13:46] this thing going on because even if it
[1:13:49] is true we also have the way to evaluate
[1:13:52] even if it's true what will it cause
[1:13:55] this person
[1:13:56] or what could it cause this person
[1:14:00] is that right
[1:14:02] i mean you know i think back to brother
[1:14:04] ram tells us this in a
[1:14:06] and one of the message to be certain of
[1:14:07] god that comes to my mind right now
[1:14:09] there was a sister you know brother
[1:14:12] branham had told a uh a joke and you
[1:14:15] know that brothers were around well then
[1:14:16] one of the brothers repeated it wasn't
[1:14:18] nothing bad at all but it was the
[1:14:21] perception of that sister and what she
[1:14:23] had and that sister was so offended now
[1:14:25] watch how brother branham approached it
[1:14:26] in the pulpit he said you know what he
[1:14:28] said i'm sorry that that happened to
[1:14:31] that sister
[1:14:32] that she would even to feel that way why
[1:14:35] because we are peacemakers
[1:14:38] a real child of god is a peacemaker is
[1:14:42] that right
[1:14:42] there's times that we have to make a
[1:14:44] stand but you know the real the real
[1:14:47] heart's desire within a child of god is
[1:14:49] to be a peacemaker this is what it means
[1:14:51] it means to
[1:14:53] to pacific which means that word means
[1:14:55] peaceful in character or intent loving
[1:14:59] peace
[1:15:00] yes amen
[1:15:01] no you know sometimes
[1:15:04] we look at peace i want you to look at
[1:15:05] peace here how how paul writes of this
[1:15:08] of peace
[1:15:09] peace is powerful
[1:15:12] i mean look what it's done in our lives
[1:15:15] now look how paul would write about this
[1:15:17] here because god himself is the author
[1:15:20] of peace
[1:15:23] if i was in need of peace
[1:15:26] i'd want to go to the author of it
[1:15:29] is that right
[1:15:30] now that god noticed hebrews 13 20 now
[1:15:33] the god of peace that brought again from
[1:15:36] the dead our lord jesus
[1:15:38] that great shepherd of the sheep through
[1:15:40] the blood of the everlasting covenant
[1:15:42] you catch that the god of peace that
[1:15:44] brought
[1:15:45] from the dead our lord jesus
[1:15:47] what brought him the god of peace
[1:15:52] amen working according to the word
[1:15:54] remember the bible tells us how the lord
[1:15:56] jesus was raised from the dead according
[1:15:59] to the spirit by the spirit of holiness
[1:16:01] he was raised from the dead according to
[1:16:04] the word of almighty god when he stood
[1:16:06] there and he said destroy this temple
[1:16:08] and in tune and in three days i'll raise
[1:16:10] it up again it was speaking by the peace
[1:16:13] of almighty god it was the peace of god
[1:16:16] which is the harmony of god operating
[1:16:21] through his son
[1:16:24] think about what this does in our life
[1:16:26] look at verse 21
[1:16:28] this really excites me it'll make you
[1:16:30] perfect in every good work that means
[1:16:33] complete
[1:16:34] to do his will
[1:16:36] working in you that which is well
[1:16:38] pleasing in his sight through jesus
[1:16:40] christ to whom be glory forever and ever
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] i'm grateful for the god of peace
[1:16:46] that's maturing my life
[1:16:49] is i can look to him he makes me
[1:16:51] complete there's a maturing that's going
[1:16:53] on by the god of peace because as he's
[1:16:56] dealing with my life he's not dealing
[1:16:57] with samuel you must do this and you got
[1:16:59] to do this but no the atmosphere his
[1:17:02] desire is is that i myself would come in
[1:17:05] harmony and unity with himself all he
[1:17:08] has to do is reveal himself and then
[1:17:11] within my heart my life what does it do
[1:17:13] it submits itself last the wife would to
[1:17:16] the husband and say be it unto me lord
[1:17:19] jesus according to your word that's the
[1:17:21] god of peace working in harmony
[1:17:27] notice in first thessalonians 5 23 and
[1:17:30] the very god of peace
[1:17:33] sanctify you holy
[1:17:36] aren't you glad for that amen
[1:17:38] amen like that song the brother blind
[1:17:40] would sing lord keep me sanctified
[1:17:43] that right
[1:17:44] continue to keep me clean we've got a
[1:17:46] place where we can continue to be washed
[1:17:49] by the water of the word
[1:17:52] is that right we to have a place to be
[1:17:54] washed so who would do this the very god
[1:17:57] of peace so what washes us is the word
[1:18:00] of god but remember brother tells us in
[1:18:02] invisible union he said if you won't
[1:18:04] stand under the word then you can't be
[1:18:07] washed but if you'll be washed by the
[1:18:10] word allow the word to wash you then
[1:18:13] it's coming in harmony with the word and
[1:18:15] it's the god of peace that is
[1:18:18] sanctifying us holy
[1:18:22] oh my
[1:18:23] notice in romans 16 20 and the god of
[1:18:27] peace
[1:18:28] oh i love that
[1:18:30] shall bruise satan under your feet
[1:18:34] shortly
[1:18:36] the god of peace
[1:18:38] the god he works in harmony with his
[1:18:41] word and with his believers
[1:18:45] let me just try to bring something down
[1:18:47] here
[1:18:48] in first corinthians 14 33
[1:18:53] i want you to just to think of this here
[1:18:57] the bible says in first corinthians 14
[1:18:59] 33
[1:19:01] for god
[1:19:03] is not
[1:19:04] the author
[1:19:06] of confusion
[1:19:08] but of peace
[1:19:10] god is the author of that
[1:19:13] confusion itself is not just something
[1:19:15] that's outward
[1:19:17] confusion can be even something as it's
[1:19:19] inward
[1:19:20] we're in your spirit it's all tore up
[1:19:23] it's all vexed
[1:19:25] let me just say this every one of us
[1:19:27] have been there
[1:19:29] enough times
[1:19:31] to where you know in your spirit your
[1:19:33] spirit's not right to even be getting
[1:19:35] ready to say what you're getting ready
[1:19:36] to say
[1:19:38] or even in a situation whether it's with
[1:19:40] the boss whether it's with somebody else
[1:19:42] you say what should i do this has to be
[1:19:44] said but remember you want the god of
[1:19:46] peace
[1:19:48] you want the god of peace to to have it
[1:19:50] in control because there's things that
[1:19:52] has to be said and you and we have to be
[1:19:54] honest with god and say god i need you
[1:19:57] lord god to give me peace within this
[1:19:59] situation and pray until you have a
[1:20:03] peace and a settledness in your heart in
[1:20:06] your spirit
[1:20:08] because god's not the author
[1:20:10] of confusion
[1:20:12] he's the author of peace
[1:20:16] now james in james 3 he writes about
[1:20:18] this wisdom that goes back and forth
[1:20:20] earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom
[1:20:23] james said in james 3 verse 16
[1:20:26] where envying and strife is
[1:20:29] there is confusion
[1:20:31] and every evil work
[1:20:37] well samuel i don't want it to be there
[1:20:39] blessed are the
[1:20:41] peacemakers
[1:20:44] somebody's got to be the peacemaker
[1:20:47] hello somebody
[1:20:49] again god ain't saying blessed are the
[1:20:51] peacemakers and and brother richie's
[1:20:53] sitting there saying i'll tell you what
[1:20:54] i wish brother samuel get his mind made
[1:20:56] up and get his act together man i'm just
[1:20:58] tired of this envy and strife and
[1:21:00] everything else no no he he's a
[1:21:01] peacemaker if he is born of the peace of
[1:21:04] god
[1:21:06] come on somebody
[1:21:08] then the same god lives in him that
[1:21:10] silenced the wind and the sea
[1:21:13] that same god lives inside of you don't
[1:21:15] let the devil try to sell short the
[1:21:17] deity is not in heaven the deity's in
[1:21:20] you
[1:21:21] [Music]
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:22] you were made to control the elements of
[1:21:26] this earth
[1:21:27] you were made as a son and daughter of
[1:21:29] god believing behold what matter of love
[1:21:32] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[1:21:34] should be called the sons of god that
[1:21:36] ain't a title all right that's a
[1:21:39] relationship with power and authority
[1:21:42] that's been given to us through and by
[1:21:45] our lord jesus christ he is our peace
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:50] and we have a dominion over that devil
[1:21:54] he's nothing but a bluff he's a liar
[1:21:57] amen he wants to try to take peace from
[1:21:59] a child of god try to take peace from a
[1:22:02] situation and put peace if something out
[1:22:04] there peace ain't out there peace is in
[1:22:07] you my peace i leave with you
[1:22:11] my peace i give to you
[1:22:14] so you're a publisher of peace if your
[1:22:16] feet are shot
[1:22:23] oh my
[1:22:25] but the wisdom
[1:22:27] that's from above is first pure
[1:22:30] then peaceable
[1:22:32] gentle
[1:22:33] easy to be entreated
[1:22:35] full of mercy
[1:22:37] good fruits
[1:22:38] without partiality
[1:22:41] and without hypocrisy
[1:22:43] that's a big difference from earthly
[1:22:45] wisdom and heavenly wisdom
[1:22:49] let's just let's go right here to this
[1:22:50] next verse
[1:22:52] oh my this is
[1:22:54] lord jesus help us
[1:22:56] and the fruit
[1:22:58] of righteousness
[1:23:00] is sown
[1:23:02] in peace
[1:23:04] of them
[1:23:06] that make
[1:23:08] peace yes
[1:23:12] god has entrusted us to be
[1:23:15] sowers
[1:23:18] of righteousness now look
[1:23:20] it's not a question we could go right
[1:23:22] around here and say there's some seeds
[1:23:24] that i've sown
[1:23:25] that i'd like to take back
[1:23:29] but yet you can't take those seeds back
[1:23:31] here's what you can do
[1:23:33] you can sow seeds
[1:23:35] that'll counteract the effect
[1:23:38] of the bad seeds
[1:23:41] you you can spend your whole you can
[1:23:43] spend your whole time of saying well i
[1:23:45] wish i hadn't said this or i wish i
[1:23:46] hadn't done this or i would
[1:23:48] or you can go
[1:23:50] to him who is our peace and say lord
[1:23:52] jesus
[1:23:53] i was wrong
[1:23:56] right here is where peace has got to
[1:23:58] start right now if peace is going to
[1:24:00] start anywhere my home piece has got to
[1:24:01] start right here
[1:24:03] if peace is going to start on my job
[1:24:04] peace has got to start right here i
[1:24:05] can't be looking at outside things
[1:24:07] because there's nothing of the world can
[1:24:09] bring me peace
[1:24:12] but peace
[1:24:13] begins
[1:24:14] within us
[1:24:18] eventually
[1:24:20] the bible says
[1:24:22] that this earth will be filled with the
[1:24:24] peace of the lord in the millennium
[1:24:28] is that right
[1:24:30] amen and those who occupy it
[1:24:32] are those who delight themselves in the
[1:24:35] abundance
[1:24:36] of peace
[1:24:39] i believe with all my heart i'm speaking
[1:24:41] to children of god tonight amen that you
[1:24:44] love peace
[1:24:46] you desire peace
[1:24:47] but remember you are called to make
[1:24:50] peace
[1:24:51] to make peace
[1:24:53] doesn't mean
[1:24:54] that you go along with the world
[1:24:58] but neither does it mean
[1:25:01] that you have rough edges
[1:25:03] that rubs the world
[1:25:06] are you with me amen just like let's say
[1:25:08] you had a job let's say you had a boss
[1:25:11] on the job and that boss
[1:25:13] and pick whatever denomination you want
[1:25:14] to pick well
[1:25:17] let's just say that he's uh
[1:25:19] associated around the message but he
[1:25:21] don't believe in ministers
[1:25:23] let's just bring it up here
[1:25:26] now
[1:25:28] you can go to that man
[1:25:30] and all the time you can tell him
[1:25:35] you need
[1:25:36] to be in the church
[1:25:39] you need to be going to church
[1:25:42] you need every time eventually he's
[1:25:44] going to avoid you
[1:25:46] brother samuel what should i do
[1:25:48] let him see what you have
[1:25:51] is better and greater than what he's got
[1:25:55] you be an advertisement for the living
[1:25:57] god i'm not you understand we're not
[1:25:59] saying at times that there ain't things
[1:26:00] that has to be said are you with me
[1:26:03] but if you're all the time running
[1:26:05] somebody down you're not making peace
[1:26:09] is that right when jesus said look let's
[1:26:11] just balance this out around here in the
[1:26:13] scripture i would just we'll just bring
[1:26:14] this out here when jesus said think not
[1:26:17] that i'm come into earth to bring peace
[1:26:20] but i come to bring a sword well that
[1:26:22] sounds contradictory doesn't it
[1:26:24] he said i'm come to set a man at
[1:26:26] variance
[1:26:27] his own foes shall be there of his
[1:26:29] household
[1:26:31] whoo
[1:26:32] but you see
[1:26:33] what was the difference
[1:26:35] it would not be that you have people
[1:26:37] that are fighting one another but it
[1:26:40] would be the change of our nature
[1:26:43] that he himself waged war on the prince
[1:26:47] of this world
[1:26:48] to deliver you and i from that from that
[1:26:51] inward that war that was going on right
[1:26:54] there that the peace of god can come on
[1:26:56] our life to where you and i can live in
[1:26:58] this world and yet not be a part of it
[1:27:01] amen
[1:27:02] that's the peace of god to know that
[1:27:05] it's not me that's doing it it's not i
[1:27:08] that doeth the works it's my father that
[1:27:10] dwelleth in me he's the one that's doing
[1:27:13] the work that that's a peace in our life
[1:27:15] to know that it's not me it's christ who
[1:27:19] liveth in me
[1:27:21] it's a strength it's a peace within our
[1:27:23] life
[1:27:26] it'd just be like within you know in
[1:27:28] life you say you know
[1:27:30] you know maybe you say well you want you
[1:27:32] know your wife
[1:27:33] i wish she would clean house better i
[1:27:34] well there may be some things you wish
[1:27:36] you'd do better too
[1:27:38] but if you but every time if you see her
[1:27:39] is you know what honey i wish you'd be i
[1:27:41] wish you'd you know be a better house
[1:27:43] cleaner like so and so
[1:27:45] i wish you'd do it like this i wish
[1:27:46] you'd do it like that
[1:27:48] that ain't making peace
[1:27:50] i don't know how in the world
[1:27:52] that ain't making peace all that's doing
[1:27:55] is bringing contention
[1:27:58] are you with me
[1:27:59] the bible says they that compare
[1:28:01] themselves among themselves are
[1:28:04] fools
[1:28:05] not wives
[1:28:06] is that right
[1:28:08] you see this is where you and i are
[1:28:10] called blessed are the peacemakers
[1:28:14] for they shall be called the child of
[1:28:16] god
[1:28:17] let our lives be that of where the fruit
[1:28:19] of righteousness is sown in peace
[1:28:22] of them that make peace
[1:28:25] think about it on your job think about
[1:28:27] it wherever you go in your home or
[1:28:28] wherever it's at no matter what the
[1:28:30] situation is
[1:28:32] what allows the seed to go forth
[1:28:35] is a life that's lived
[1:28:37] in peace
[1:28:39] it don't mean you're going to their oh
[1:28:41] we got this uh you know halloween party
[1:28:43] coming up or we got this thanksgiving
[1:28:45] gathering or this you know christmas
[1:28:47] party oh my i got to go to the christmas
[1:28:48] party to make peace with them no that's
[1:28:50] not what we're saying
[1:28:52] what we're saying is is that within it
[1:28:54] that our lives are peaceable
[1:28:58] our lives are not contentious we can
[1:29:01] stand for principle without being
[1:29:04] contentious
[1:29:06] whoo
[1:29:08] this is what the peace of god does in
[1:29:10] our life
[1:29:12] yes
[1:29:13] it's that it might be that which would
[1:29:15] draw
[1:29:17] it withdrawal
[1:29:19] the peace
[1:29:21] is sown that fruit of righteousness is
[1:29:23] sown in peace of them
[1:29:25] that make peace i want to be a
[1:29:26] peacemaker
[1:29:27] i want to be a peacemaker
[1:29:30] there's a lot of times when there's
[1:29:31] situations whether it's in your home
[1:29:33] whether it's within the church
[1:29:35] the objective is
[1:29:36] is that god might have free course
[1:29:39] just as much as god would hold me
[1:29:41] accountable to it for the church god
[1:29:42] holds every one of you accountable in
[1:29:44] your homes and and everything else even
[1:29:46] in your jobs and situation god holds us
[1:29:49] accountable to those things to be agents
[1:29:52] of peace
[1:29:55] i say god help us amen
[1:29:57] but let me tell you something greater is
[1:29:58] he that's in you amen greater is he
[1:30:01] that's in you and i'm so glad we can go
[1:30:03] to him in prayer and say lord
[1:30:06] i need more yes amen i need more amen
[1:30:10] oh my as i stood in the office here you
[1:30:12] know this afternoon and praying i said
[1:30:14] god i need more
[1:30:16] i need more of you lord i want more of
[1:30:19] the love of god
[1:30:20] i want more lord in my life lord jesus i
[1:30:23] want more of you oh god
[1:30:26] amen that that that peace and give me
[1:30:28] the wisdom lord continue to give me the
[1:30:30] understanding lord that in
[1:30:32] everything that we are
[1:30:35] truly operating blessed are
[1:30:38] the peacemakers
[1:30:41] you think of how the lord jesus
[1:30:43] this is something sometimes that many
[1:30:45] times that
[1:30:47] maybe you've noticed it maybe you
[1:30:48] haven't
[1:30:49] you know a lot of times they pressed on
[1:30:51] him with questions
[1:30:53] they came and they the bible says they
[1:30:55] pressed on him vehemently to try to
[1:30:57] catch him
[1:31:00] they
[1:31:01] it seemed like you would think
[1:31:03] well
[1:31:04] wouldn't sweet jesus want to answer
[1:31:05] their questions
[1:31:08] but you see the lord jesus
[1:31:10] even in knowing it
[1:31:11] that even in times of being a peacemaker
[1:31:14] there's times where you know what to
[1:31:16] avoid
[1:31:18] is that right
[1:31:20] you know what to avoid even sometimes
[1:31:21] when there's you know people that can
[1:31:23] come around whether it's on your job or
[1:31:25] even in situations that sometimes can
[1:31:27] arise in your home and you realize and
[1:31:29] you might say uh-oh
[1:31:30] that right there is like a hole i'm not
[1:31:32] stepping in that yes
[1:31:34] all right
[1:31:36] it isn't your brother and your sister it
[1:31:38] in your husband and in your wife
[1:31:40] recognize it for who it is it's the
[1:31:42] enemy
[1:31:43] and you stand as a son and daughter of
[1:31:44] god
[1:31:45] as a peacemaker
[1:31:50] oh my you love him
[1:31:53] good to be back home
[1:31:58] god is so good
[1:32:00] he is our peace
[1:32:02] no matter what the situation i
[1:32:04] i think god i know god has been really
[1:32:06] laying this very clear for our lives
[1:32:09] that no matter what the situation is
[1:32:11] remember
[1:32:12] who
[1:32:13] you are
[1:32:15] remember the authority that god has
[1:32:18] invested
[1:32:19] in your life
[1:32:21] you are a son and daughter of god
[1:32:24] situations don't control you
[1:32:27] you control them
[1:32:30] you say brother samuel but you know i
[1:32:32] don't want to be ashore you're not a
[1:32:33] shawl don't don't let the devil
[1:32:34] misinterpret that
[1:32:36] every time the squirrels came into
[1:32:38] existence there was a need
[1:32:40] all right
[1:32:41] sister meaty
[1:32:43] had that cancer that was in need
[1:32:46] brother branham was up in the mountains
[1:32:48] and the storm there was a need
[1:32:52] when they stood before the red sea there
[1:32:54] was a need
[1:32:56] so the word itself is operating in times
[1:33:00] of need
[1:33:03] so what must i do speak to that storm
