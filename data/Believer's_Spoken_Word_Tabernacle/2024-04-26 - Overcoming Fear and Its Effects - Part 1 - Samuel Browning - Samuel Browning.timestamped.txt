[35:40] you and Lord where their lives had

[38:23] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[38:25] could ask or think Lord we ask ask it
[38:27] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[38:31] amen amen amen if you'll turn with me in
[38:35] the Bible to Job chapter 3 I um brother
[38:42] brother Greg kener he had um text me
[38:45] today and U sister Suzanne is doing uh
[38:50] much better she's on a walker right now
[38:53] it'll go from a walker to a cane and
[38:56] then getting back but as far as the pain
[38:57] that she had been dealing with in her
[39:00] back that's gone that's all gone but the
[39:04] you know how it is the pain from the
[39:07] surgery or the procedure that was done
[39:09] that's that's what she's uh just had to
[39:11] deal with right now but so they just
[39:13] wanted me to pass it along and just say
[39:15] thank you because they know it's just
[39:17] the prayers that's really just that's
[39:19] just holding holding her up and so we
[39:22] want to just uh remember her in prayer
[39:24] as well I want to read here from uh
[39:27] three verses scripture out of job and
[39:30] it's kind of going back um a little bit
[39:32] here but um dealing with this thought uh
[39:36] on worry and uh where job was at and
[39:39] that we've been dealing with that for
[39:40] some time and to remember as the prophet
[39:44] said and I have heard but now I see I
[39:46] started out reading that to you and
[39:47] that's where we kind of Drew some things
[39:49] from is that when things were not going
[39:52] as they normally would or job couldn't
[39:55] get an answer now I don't know how long
[39:57] it was just like you don't know or I
[39:59] don't know how long it is until we get
[40:01] an answer you might be facing something
[40:04] and you might been had other situations
[40:07] where you know okay it's been maybe days
[40:09] or weeks or months or something and then
[40:12] I've always got an answer somehow maybe
[40:13] it's when I've come to the house of God
[40:15] maybe I've been in prayer somewhere
[40:17] you've got an answer but then let's say
[40:19] here you've went on for days weeks
[40:21] months and it's it's gone in a manner
[40:23] that's just much different seemingly to
[40:26] you and yet this is where for job
[40:28] remember God he knew God by inspiration
[40:32] and so when he had not received that
[40:34] inspiration as far as what was taking
[40:37] place at that moment and what we'll call
[40:39] that inspiration is substance Faith
[40:43] because faith is a revelation it takes a
[40:46] revelation of what God has done for you
[40:49] through Calvary and that Revelation is
[40:51] the new birth and then from there every
[40:54] situation and things that we come to we
[40:57] trust God but yet there's times where we
[41:00] don't know what the outcome's going to
[41:01] be but we trust him is that right that's
[41:04] like the Hebrew children they didn't
[41:06] know that they were going to walk out of
[41:07] that fiery furnace but they trusted the
[41:10] Lord is that right so they they didn't
[41:13] have a thus sayith the Lord I'm going to
[41:14] walk out of here they did not have that
[41:16] of a substance that I'm going to walk
[41:18] out of here but they did have that
[41:20] substance they knew where they were
[41:21] standing with God that if this situation
[41:24] it's not going to separate me from God
[41:26] that's right I don't know I don't know
[41:28] how God's going to work this out but
[41:29] it's not going to separate me from God
[41:32] so that's why it's so important that
[41:34] faith is the victory that overcometh the
[41:36] world so when job he didn't he didn't
[41:39] remember he he wasn't getting that
[41:40] inspiration so he got worried and I'm
[41:42] sure everybody every one of us here have
[41:44] been through those times where you're
[41:46] not getting an answer or maybe something
[41:47] isn't coming in a way that you are used
[41:50] to coming and that's where the Prophet
[41:53] said it was worrying him so it was no
[41:56] longer just a concern it had become a
[41:59] worry a worry and a worry is an an
[42:03] anxiousness and anxiety now watch this
[42:06] back here in the beginning in Job 3 this
[42:08] is where I want to draw from for my sign
[42:11] cometh before I eat and my roarings are
[42:16] poured out like the
[42:19] waters for the thing which I
[42:22] greatly
[42:24] feared is come upon me
[42:28] wow
[42:30] job had
[42:32] fear the thing which I greatly feared is
[42:37] come upon me and that which I was afraid
[42:42] of is come unto me I was not in safety
[42:46] neither had I rest neither was I quiet
[42:50] yet trouble
[42:52] came I'd like to speak here tonight at
[42:55] least to start in on this overcoming
[42:58] fear and its effects may God bless you
[43:02] bless the reading of the word as you're
[43:03] being
[43:05] seated I've often looked at this
[43:07] scripture
[43:09] and I think back to when I first started
[43:12] pastoring there in 2002
[43:16] and we took a little series on job that
[43:19] the Lord would let L us into at that
[43:22] moment there's certain parts and things
[43:24] within the scriptures that I I just be
[43:26] honest with with you I don't I don't
[43:28] understand all the way or I don't
[43:31] sometimes it's just hard to as we look
[43:33] into it but I believe God would give us
[43:36] insight into these things and when we
[43:38] can look and pick these things up and
[43:41] sometimes we can put job and other men
[43:43] Elijah and so forth and others even
[43:46] brothers and sisters we go to church
[43:48] with and we can sometimes put people
[43:50] somewhat on a pedestal but we don't see
[43:53] the battles they go through behind the
[43:55] scenes it's not we're trying to the
[43:57] actors it's not that at all CU I know
[43:59] sometimes we can call one another and
[44:00] say hey I'm in a battle I'm I'm In the
[44:02] Heat of the battle I need some backup
[44:04] right now and we're able to stand there
[44:06] and pray for one another but we realize
[44:08] James would write very specifically you
[44:11] know James was a was one who would write
[44:14] um it was very much kind of in a way
[44:16] like a pastoral epistle because it
[44:18] always dealt with feet on the ground
[44:21] remember he would write about faith
[44:22] itself but he would write about faith
[44:24] differently than Paul would James would
[44:27] say that with you say that you have no
[44:29] works with your faith then your faith is
[44:31] in vain but he would say faith without
[44:34] works it's dead so James was was you
[44:37] know was was was feet on the ground type
[44:40] guy knowing that yes we're to be
[44:42] influenced by the Heavenly but whatever
[44:44] is in when we're influenced by the
[44:46] Heavenly then it will actually show
[44:48] itself out through our lives and so when
[44:52] we look at this scripture here in verse
[44:54] 25 the thing which I greatly feared is
[44:58] come upon me and that which I was afraid
[45:01] of is come unto me I want you to watch
[45:04] how brother branam brings this in
[45:06] perfect Faith he says in the Book of Job
[45:08] it says here job feared and what he
[45:12] feared it actually
[45:16] happened what brought it his
[45:20] fear that's what made it happen his
[45:24] faith would have kept would have kept
[45:26] him from it but his fear brought it to
[45:30] him he was scared it was going to happen
[45:34] and it did happen if he hadn't if he
[45:37] knowed it wouldn't have happened it
[45:38] wouldn't have
[45:39] happened now you know it's a Marvel I
[45:42] I'm not going to go into this tonight
[45:44] but it's a Marvel to give account after
[45:45] account that even you find that many
[45:47] times of how that fear will work upon
[45:50] the physical body where there's people
[45:53] there's one account that I have here in
[45:55] in my studies of one lady who was laying
[45:58] there in the hospital or exam room and a
[46:01] doctor came in with a special team of
[46:03] doctors and he he mentioned regarding
[46:06] that this woman that she they look at
[46:09] her and they're looking at the situation
[46:12] and he says to the rest of the doctors
[46:15] um this is uh TS now it's all he says
[46:18] this is TS and immediately she Begins
[46:21] the account of the situation is she
[46:24] begins to think TS you're in in a
[46:27] medical situation your things that
[46:29] you're wanting to know what's going on
[46:30] in your body and immediately the thought
[46:33] comes to her terminal
[46:35] situation and when that comes into her
[46:38] mind immediately her blood pressure
[46:41] Spikes all of these other vitals go up
[46:44] regarding this lady and as they they
[46:47] they they go about the situation and
[46:49] they come in and they begin to speak to
[46:51] her they looking at what what's taking
[46:53] place and they what it is is that she
[46:55] heard TS but actually what it was it had
[46:58] nothing else I I can't pronounce the
[47:00] name I don't I could pull it up it's
[47:02] here in front of me but I I wasn't
[47:03] planning on referring to it but it just
[47:05] comes where where she where she was at
[47:08] it was actually just a condition that
[47:09] wasn't even terminal wasn't even fatal
[47:12] but because she took that in and
[47:14] believed that it actually set things in
[47:17] Motion in her body in a certain way I
[47:20] tell you fear is a terrible thing it's a
[47:23] horrible thing that you know that even
[47:25] while we're here within this life from
[47:27] now until we're changed or go by the way
[47:29] of the Grave we will experience fear
[47:32] fear will come to us in many different
[47:34] forms and varieties but the thing that
[47:36] we want to be able to look at is to be
[47:39] able to discern the spirit of fear when
[47:42] it would come and be able to stand there
[47:45] with God's word and let the word drive
[47:47] it right back
[47:48] out he says now if you're afraid watch
[47:51] how brother Bram brings this application
[47:53] down in of what I just read about job he
[47:55] said if you're afraid when you come by
[47:57] the prayer line maybe I just haven't got
[48:00] the faith sufficient it'll never happen
[48:03] don't worry he says but if you know it's
[48:05] going to happen it'll happen now watch
[48:08] this it's a substance of
[48:12] something so when when that substance
[48:15] he's talking about is Faith when God
[48:18] reveals to you your suffering is over
[48:21] that is a substance for that
[48:25] situation are you with me we have a
[48:28] substance when we've been born again of
[48:30] the spirit of God we have a substance
[48:32] faith in that we know where we're
[48:33] standing with God we passed from Death
[48:35] unto life but as far as the substance
[48:39] when we're right reading this right here
[48:41] it's something that is so made known to
[48:43] you or something that is so personal and
[48:46] and you begin to be occupied by that
[48:47] it's a substance and notice it's a
[48:50] substance of something watch how he says
[48:52] this job had a fear that these things
[48:56] would come up on him and they did
[48:58] marvelous I mean it's incredible faith
[49:01] is a substance and so is fear both of
[49:04] them are substances so fear isn't just
[49:07] something of Simply of just well you
[49:09] know just just don't just don't think
[49:11] that way it's a
[49:13] spirit it's a
[49:15] spirit now watch if you have a fear that
[49:18] your disease won't leave you it won't if
[49:21] you have faith that it will now he says
[49:24] you can ask any medical doctor I I love
[49:26] this simple application the first thing
[49:29] he'll try to get you to do is to have
[49:32] confidence in the medicine he's given
[49:35] you is't that exactly what God does is
[49:38] always to bring our confidence in the
[49:40] word not not focusing on your disease
[49:43] but let's get confidence in what can
[49:45] take care of the situation it just shows
[49:49] us where to be looking at he's given it
[49:51] to you if you haven't got no confidence
[49:52] in it you better leave it alone he said
[49:55] well what is it then it's faith faith
[49:57] that does the healing it's faith that
[49:59] does it all the time now think of this
[50:02] job had no fear of his message being
[50:05] right no fear at all he had no fear of
[50:09] where he was standing with God because
[50:12] he knew even in this scripture the
[50:15] chapter we've been working out of in Job
[50:17] chapter 23 he said I've not gone back
[50:19] from the Commandment of his lips I have
[50:21] esteemed his word from his mouth more
[50:24] than my necessary food he knew where he
[50:26] was standing even when the attacks were
[50:29] coming in upon Him job you've done
[50:32] something surely and all of those things
[50:34] that we went through there about a year
[50:35] ago and bringing those things out and
[50:37] showing all of that but yet with job was
[50:40] able to stand as the prophet would say
[50:42] over and over and over flat-footed this
[50:45] is what I Marvel he is able to stand
[50:47] this way with such a resilient Faith but
[50:51] yet there were things that happened to
[50:53] him because he feared
[50:56] that's a Marvel it's a Marvel to me how
[50:59] how a person and how we and ourselves
[51:02] can have faith in that where we're
[51:04] standing with God but fear can move in
[51:07] there through one of those inlets and
[51:10] fear itself job said the things which I
[51:13] feared have come upon me what I was
[51:16] afraid of now no doubt he must have seen
[51:18] something seen these destructions seen
[51:21] other children being lost seen other
[51:23] things taking place and there had to be
[51:25] something that was presented an unknown
[51:28] something in his mind that he would
[51:30] begin to dwell on that he had no fear of
[51:33] where he was standing so when we think
[51:35] of this it's an aspect of fear that you
[51:38] know that you and I everybody has
[51:40] experienced fear we and fear itself if
[51:43] even after we know it entered in because
[51:45] of the fall but realizing that there's a
[51:48] part of that that's given to you and I
[51:50] for our protection when there's things
[51:52] you you hear a loud bang boom you Run
[51:55] for Cover you try to get away from a
[51:57] situation you hear tires screeching and
[52:00] you're driving on the road you quickly
[52:01] look around of where's the Escape Route
[52:04] or what's going on around me why there's
[52:05] a part within you that even after the
[52:08] fall where fear itself would set in God
[52:11] would place what they would call a
[52:14] response within you and I of how that we
[52:16] would see certain things just like when
[52:18] here you would you know you're walking
[52:20] maybe deep in thought everybody have had
[52:22] probably had this happen you're deep in
[52:24] thought and all of a sudden somebody
[52:26] just say something to you you just it
[52:27] startles you and you're think hey hey
[52:29] hey hey it's all right and you know you
[52:30] were out far away though sitting right
[52:33] there then you've had maybe somebody
[52:35] jump out and scare you and you
[52:37] immediately you know you maybe you jerk
[52:38] back you know to give them a little
[52:40] fivefold or or something you know and it
[52:43] it it's a scare a fear can come about us
[52:45] and sometimes there's things that can
[52:47] happen with a doctor's report can come
[52:50] around our way now I'm not saying that
[52:52] you've accepted it but I'm saying that
[52:54] when things come and things will come
[52:57] they continued even as God would address
[52:59] Israel I'll not get to that tonight but
[53:02] On and On Through the scriptures even
[53:04] when God would confirm his word to his
[53:06] children he would admonish them that
[53:09] there are things that's going to be
[53:11] fearful that's coming up just like when
[53:13] Paul was going to Rome the angel of the
[53:15] Lord visited him that night told him
[53:18] fear not Paul you're going to Rome but
[53:21] before you get there there's going to be
[53:23] a shipwreck and you're going to be up on
[53:25] an island now do you thinking that
[53:27] shipwreck that Paul just you know
[53:28] grabbed the board and just laid back and
[53:30] propped his feet up no he was probably
[53:33] paddling and swimming for his life like
[53:36] you or I would but he had a strength
[53:38] from almighty God that equipped him and
[53:41] helped him to push beyond the fear of
[53:44] present
[53:46] circumstances so it's not that fear
[53:48] won't come it's just we don't want to
[53:50] give a place to fear and give an
[53:52] occupancy or a part of it within our
[53:55] life now not notice when we think of
[53:57] this of how that fear itself and God
[54:01] would speak to you and I let's look at a
[54:03] few scriptures itself of how that God
[54:05] would speak to us about fearing the
[54:08] right thing and not to fear the wrong
[54:10] thing I like how David writes this I've
[54:12] always love the scripture in Psalms 56:3
[54:15] what time I am afraid my here's a giant
[54:18] killer here's a man that faced a bear
[54:21] and a lion right but remember when he
[54:23] walked out there to face Goliath brother
[54:26] BR said he danced all the way to the
[54:28] battle cuz he already knew the outcome
[54:30] what did he have substance he had a
[54:34] revelation it was
[54:37] finished is that right same thing with
[54:39] the lion the bear so it wasn't just it
[54:42] wasn't just David just walking out there
[54:44] and saying well you know I I trust this
[54:46] takes place but he had a revelation yet
[54:48] there's times in our life there's things
[54:50] we face and say Lord I trust that you'll
[54:53] bring me out Lord I Trust You Lord I'm
[54:56] looking to you and what we're looking
[54:58] for God but sometimes where we and
[55:00] ourselves become so worried is because
[55:03] we don't have a revelation in that
[55:05] moment of a substance of what God's
[55:08] going to do in that moment but yet there
[55:10] is an element are you hearing me tonight
[55:12] there's an element of faith in our soul
[55:15] that will guide us with a true
[55:17] expectation that's called hope it will
[55:20] guide us with the true expectation that
[55:23] I know what God has done I know he's the
[55:26] the god of his word I don't have a
[55:28] direct Revelation regarding this
[55:30] situation but I've got his word on it
[55:33] and I'll take his word and what
[55:36] Revelation comes forth concerning this
[55:39] if God reveals something then I'll
[55:41] accept that but in the meantime I'm
[55:43] going to stand on his word that's why
[55:45] the prophet could say over and over
[55:47] greatest battle ever fought he said if I
[55:49] pray for 10,000 tonight and every one of
[55:52] them died he said I'd be standing on the
[55:55] platform tomorrow night praying for
[55:58] another
[55:59] 10,000 why I trust
[56:03] him look at this David said what time I
[56:07] am afraid my David you mean you had
[56:10] experience fear sure there's situations
[56:14] sometimes that can be very
[56:17] fearful but here's what I'll do I will
[56:20] trust in
[56:23] thee this is this is the battle so you
[56:25] see this isn't like this isn't pretty
[56:28] Texas picnics of you know with smiley
[56:31] white teeth and name it claim it
[56:33] religion that's not what this is no
[56:35] offense sister Lily she's not a she's
[56:37] not that way she's a Texan but she's not
[56:39] that way but you understand what I'm
[56:40] saying it's not this old picnic and and
[56:43] no easy no there's going to be battles
[56:45] but David said when fear comes this is
[56:47] how I'm going to face it amen I will
[56:51] trust in
[56:53] thee in God I love this I will praise
[56:57] His word in God I have put my
[57:02] trust I will not fear what flesh can do
[57:07] unto me so that's we don't want to fear
[57:09] that it's not what flesh can do to you
[57:12] remember it's just like somebody comes
[57:13] up to you on the job boss whomever it is
[57:15] or somebody oh you know this and this
[57:17] wait a minute you didn't give me this
[57:20] job you might have interviewed me but
[57:23] you didn't give me this job oh God gave
[57:25] me this job so I'm going to praise him
[57:29] in his
[57:30] word I'm going to trust him because this
[57:33] is not what I did see this is where we
[57:35] need to turn our attention because it
[57:37] isn't going to be we're going to walk
[57:39] around in a bubble and all of a sudden
[57:41] one of these moments we will be
[57:43] completely in a place where we'll never
[57:45] experience fear anymore that's not true
[57:48] at all we will experience
[57:52] it but this is the way that we handle it
[57:56] I will not fear what flesh can do unto
[57:58] me verse 10 in God will I praise His
[58:02] word in the Lord will I praise His word
[58:05] notice this is where it has to be in God
[58:09] in the Lord this is our place of safety
[58:12] that's our place of Deliverance in him
[58:16] in God have I put my trust I will not be
[58:18] afraid what man can do unto me notice in
[58:24] Luke 12:4 Jes Jesus said I say say unto
[58:27] you my friends be not afraid of them
[58:30] that can kill the body and after that
[58:33] have no more that they can do but I
[58:35] forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear Him
[58:39] which after he hath killed hath power to
[58:42] cast into hell yay I say unto you fear
[58:45] him so a rightful fear though because
[58:47] remember the fear that comes from the
[58:49] Lord is not a tormenting
[58:52] fear the Bible said the fear of the Lord
[58:54] is clean yes this is what love the love
[58:57] of God comes to do is cast out that
[59:00] ungodly fear and brings about a real
[59:04] reverence and a real trust to the Lord
[59:07] oh my notice when we look at this even
[59:10] in in verse six are not five sparrows
[59:13] sold for two farings and not one of them
[59:16] is forgotten before God now I think it's
[59:18] think to me it's marvelous how God would
[59:20] choose what he does to speak about he
[59:22] does not speak about two golden Mansions
[59:24] or two you know things that are so
[59:27] illustrious but he takes simple little
[59:29] things that you and I would say what
[59:31] would be significant in that I love how
[59:33] the prophet brings that how that God
[59:35] would bring that of two little sparrows
[59:37] even the very hairs of your head verse
[59:39] seven are all numbered fear not
[59:42] therefore ye are of more value than many
[59:48] sparrows Revelations 17 when I saw him I
[59:52] fell at his feet as dead and he laid his
[59:55] right hand upon upon me saying unto me
[59:57] fear not I am the first and the last I
[1:00:02] am he that liveth and was dead and
[1:00:04] behold I'm alive forever more and have
[1:00:06] the keys of death and of Hell or of hell
[1:00:10] and of death so with this is where over
[1:00:13] and over it's admonished even after the
[1:00:15] Lord Jesus would raise and he would
[1:00:17] speak to the disciples over and over and
[1:00:20] we see it all the way through the
[1:00:21] scriptures even through the New
[1:00:22] Testament he would admonish his children
[1:00:26] over and over fear not it's incredible
[1:00:28] the amount of times that God speaks to
[1:00:30] Joshua in the book of Joshua I'm not
[1:00:32] going to get on it tonight but many
[1:00:34] times not just in the first chapter but
[1:00:37] every time when they're coming into
[1:00:38] situations God will address Joshua again
[1:00:42] uh Be not Afraid be not fearful do not
[1:00:46] fear why these situations if you look at
[1:00:49] them they are fearful but don't be
[1:00:52] afraid don't be afraid that's good don't
[1:00:55] be afraid yeah now notice so over and
[1:00:58] over we see this don't fear don't fear
[1:01:00] don't fear but you see God is not just
[1:01:03] one is just telling us you know don't
[1:01:04] fear or don't Fe but but it's him it's
[1:01:07] him that's telling us this it's him when
[1:01:09] he comes through his word and speaks to
[1:01:12] us that's what stabilizes you and I
[1:01:15] that's that's what gives you and I
[1:01:17] Strength it's when God comes and God
[1:01:20] speaks to our lives it's God confirming
[1:01:22] his word listen you and I could not even
[1:01:25] walk in the hour hour that we're walking
[1:01:27] in had it not been for god making
[1:01:30] himself known that he's the same Living
[1:01:33] God this is what God did this is why God
[1:01:36] sends a message this is what this
[1:01:39] message of the hour is all about it's
[1:01:41] it's unlike any other message that's hit
[1:01:43] the face of the Earth because this
[1:01:45] message is not a rumor that he's alive
[1:01:49] that's what they had in isusa Street
[1:01:51] Pentecost it was a rumor that he's alive
[1:01:54] but when he came back in his fullness it
[1:01:57] was no longer a rumor he indeed was
[1:02:01] alive he was Arisen from the grave he
[1:02:04] proved himself to do the same things he
[1:02:06] did before he was
[1:02:09] crucified and what did it do it
[1:02:11] stabilizes them this is why that
[1:02:14] Revelation and this is why Walking with
[1:02:16] God it means so much to our life of
[1:02:19] where we to draw our strength from to
[1:02:22] overcome fear and the effects that it
[1:02:25] would want to bring
[1:02:27] amen God don't want to let don't God
[1:02:29] don't want anything to bother us now
[1:02:31] watch this with Paul in 2 Corinthians
[1:02:33] chapter 7 and verse 5 now Paul had many
[1:02:37] many dealings he had a lot of tight
[1:02:40] places he was in for bringing the
[1:02:43] gospel watch when Paul said when we were
[1:02:45] coming to Macedonia our flesh had no
[1:02:50] rest he didn't say his soul didn't have
[1:02:53] rest his soul had rest
[1:02:56] his soul was within the inner Veil but
[1:03:00] he said our flesh had no rest but we
[1:03:04] were troubled on every side without were
[1:03:08] fightings within were fears that's good
[1:03:13] oh my you see I I I I love how the
[1:03:17] scriptures you know Paul this is why
[1:03:19] brother brandom brother Ram could tell
[1:03:20] us he said this Bible he said it ain't
[1:03:23] the book of man book of man all us try
[1:03:25] to hide highlight man well I don't have
[1:03:26] fear and I don't that's highlighting man
[1:03:29] H George Washington never told a lie but
[1:03:32] God never God does not mind those things
[1:03:35] being wrote in the scriptures where
[1:03:38] David could say in what time I am afraid
[1:03:41] it's not glorifying fear it's glorifying
[1:03:44] God who through David's life who through
[1:03:47] Paul's life where they were able to
[1:03:49] stand there and being honest to somebody
[1:03:51] else and say what time I'm afraid I will
[1:03:55] trust in
[1:03:56] God that's so good
[1:04:00] hallelujah oh my without we're fightings
[1:04:03] within were fears Paul feared for his
[1:04:07] life in what in what way did was Paul
[1:04:09] fearing that oh no I'm not right with
[1:04:11] God I'm not ready to meet God no no that
[1:04:14] it was not the fears that he's talking
[1:04:15] about it was the fears of are we going
[1:04:18] to get out of
[1:04:19] this are we going to get out of this
[1:04:21] well brother Samuel he knew that was the
[1:04:23] prophet of God he didn't know that
[1:04:25] because in order to know that that would
[1:04:27] require a revelation from God that you
[1:04:30] are going to come through this everybody
[1:04:34] hearing me that's a substance that's
[1:04:36] where it becomes a substance that's
[1:04:38] where it becomes that Revelation that's
[1:04:41] where it becomes like the prophet said
[1:04:43] if the doctor said you were going to die
[1:04:45] and God were to tell you these things he
[1:04:48] said you would look at the doct doctor
[1:04:51] and laugh it would not be a laugh out of
[1:04:53] fear of no I'm a Believer the that
[1:04:57] that's not going to happen to me no it
[1:04:58] would not be that it would not be a
[1:05:00] laughter of no no no I I'm not going to
[1:05:02] die I don't want to die no it would be a
[1:05:05] substance faith and the only way it's a
[1:05:08] substance faith is by a divine
[1:05:12] revelation you've come here tonight no
[1:05:14] doubt faith has brought you here tonight
[1:05:17] right even every person has a Measure of
[1:05:20] Faith even now everybody else that's out
[1:05:22] there they've got a measure of human
[1:05:23] Faith they got in their car went to work
[1:05:25] this morning went to their jobs that's
[1:05:27] Faith fundamental foundation for Faith
[1:05:29] takes Faith to bring you here but to
[1:05:32] think about it there's things where
[1:05:34] you've come here but I could probably
[1:05:35] ask every one of you and say has it been
[1:05:38] revealed to you before you got here what
[1:05:41] God was going to say tonight and how God
[1:05:43] was going to move probably not but you
[1:05:45] come here with an expectation because
[1:05:48] he's moved before and he promised where
[1:05:51] two or three are gathered together in my
[1:05:54] name there will I be also these are the
[1:05:57] kind of people that God wants to worship
[1:06:00] him this is why the prophet says in
[1:06:03] three kinds of Believers he said that
[1:06:05] ought to be the achievement for every
[1:06:08] every believer is to believe every word
[1:06:12] of
[1:06:12] God whether I have a direct revelation
[1:06:16] of my sickness my disease my situation
[1:06:19] I've got God's word on
[1:06:23] it are you with me yes yes sir but
[1:06:27] sometimes if we don't have a direct thus
[1:06:29] sayith the Lord we walk around as though
[1:06:31] we're defeated right that's good don't
[1:06:34] worry that's how job was going
[1:06:36] around he was getting all worried cuz he
[1:06:38] wasn't getting any
[1:06:39] inspiration he was all worried well I've
[1:06:42] been praying about this and it's getting
[1:06:44] he was getting
[1:06:46] worried I'm glad that God included these
[1:06:49] things aren't you but watch watch how
[1:06:51] God deals with this in verse six
[1:06:53] nevertheless God that comforted those
[1:06:56] that are cast down comforted Us by the
[1:07:00] coming of Titus and not by his coming
[1:07:03] only but by the consolation wherewith he
[1:07:06] was comforted in you when he told us of
[1:07:08] your earnest desire fervent mind toward
[1:07:10] me so that I Rejoice the the more now
[1:07:13] notice when Titus comes to them God God
[1:07:16] does not look down upon Paul and say
[1:07:18] shame on you for having fears and
[1:07:20] wondering about what's going to happen
[1:07:22] God God understands these things but God
[1:07:26] knows how to work with it and deal with
[1:07:28] it he sent he didn't send Paul a book he
[1:07:31] didn't send Paul a tape we believe in
[1:07:34] books and tapes you ought to be in them
[1:07:36] but what he sent was the what was on the
[1:07:38] tapes what was on the books he sent the
[1:07:41] word made
[1:07:43] flesh another brother Titus he sent him
[1:07:47] with a word of comfort and that word of
[1:07:49] comfort was not Paul get out of your
[1:07:52] situation it was look it was pointing
[1:07:54] Paul to what the word was doing in the
[1:07:58] lives of the Corinthian Believers and
[1:08:00] when Paul could look at that he drew
[1:08:03] comfort from seeing God's
[1:08:05] work sometimes we're looking for answers
[1:08:09] and they're right before us that is so
[1:08:11] they're just not coming out in the exact
[1:08:14] phrases or statements but God will
[1:08:16] always encourage Us by making his Word
[1:08:19] Flesh Now watch how brother Bram I love
[1:08:21] that message greatest B fault it it
[1:08:24] covers all all basis
[1:08:26] notice brother B is talking about after
[1:08:28] the devil is put out of your life he
[1:08:30] says if he can get in there at all he's
[1:08:33] got your army
[1:08:35] routed right then now what is he talking
[1:08:38] about if if once a Believer has been
[1:08:41] sealed by the spirit of God Satan can no
[1:08:44] longer get there in that of the
[1:08:47] soul but these other two
[1:08:51] Realms he'll come and he'll
[1:08:53] attack he'll attack in the mind flesh
[1:08:56] spirit all that's attached now watch
[1:08:59] brother B says if he can get in there
[1:09:01] he's got your army routed right then you
[1:09:04] got five senses right five natural
[1:09:07] senses then we got five Spirit
[1:09:10] senses and notice that within all of
[1:09:13] those things if if reasoning we know how
[1:09:15] the prophet has taught us if reasoning
[1:09:17] agrees with the word of God okay then
[1:09:20] but if it's against the word of God I
[1:09:22] don't care how perfect it looks
[1:09:27] we walk away from
[1:09:29] it yes sir is that right this this comes
[1:09:33] to the scripture of Romans 8 that there
[1:09:37] is n nor for no condemnation to them
[1:09:39] that are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:09:43] according to the flesh but they walk
[1:09:45] after the spirit and brother BR picks
[1:09:48] that up I believe in Acts of the Holy
[1:09:49] Spirit he said if the doctor says and
[1:09:51] gives you a report that you can't get
[1:09:53] well and this situation he said well
[1:09:56] that's what the report says he said but
[1:09:58] when the spirit says you're coming out
[1:10:01] of that then we no longer walk by the
[1:10:05] flesh we walk by the spirit we've
[1:10:09] received a direct substance word that we
[1:10:12] didn't make happen you realize every
[1:10:15] Revelation we've got it a us that's
[1:10:17] pulled it
[1:10:18] down Revelation that's come for the
[1:10:20] healing in your body even Revelation
[1:10:23] that's come for the new birth you didn't
[1:10:24] pull it down I didn't pull it down even
[1:10:26] situations you're facing oh I fasted I
[1:10:29] no you have to understand you can't
[1:10:31] Merit that that is sovereignly given by
[1:10:34] almighty God it's sovereignly given it's
[1:10:37] not anything we work ourselves up into
[1:10:40] and I'm just going to go speak the word
[1:10:42] and you're going to fall flat on your
[1:10:43] face you've got to wait for an
[1:10:45] inspiration to come from God and that
[1:10:49] doesn't mean that I wait around and oh
[1:10:51] Lord I I Lord you don't you don't love
[1:10:53] me I I you know you usually reveal you
[1:10:57] no no no sometimes God wants to see are
[1:11:00] we going to stand up and begin to mature
[1:11:03] or are we going to stay down there in a
[1:11:05] way it's got to be my way or the highway
[1:11:07] you've always done it like this or are
[1:11:09] we going to trust him in the face of
[1:11:12] every situation even when it isn't
[1:11:15] happening or coming the same way I will
[1:11:18] trust in him hallelu my my my my if
[1:11:24] you're memory the prophet said if your
[1:11:27] imaginations if your conscience anything
[1:11:30] disagrees with what's on the inside get
[1:11:33] rid of
[1:11:35] it amen anybody
[1:11:38] ever probably everybody's cleaned house
[1:11:41] some of you went through everybody got a
[1:11:42] junk drawer no out in the kitchen I
[1:11:44] think every house got that what do you
[1:11:46] do with this put in the drawer what you
[1:11:49] do lay it over
[1:11:51] there but then you know what so
[1:11:53] everybody starts laying things around
[1:11:55] there then eventually somebody gets the
[1:11:57] wise idea to clean it we're going to
[1:11:59] empty that drawer out you know coupons
[1:12:02] from back when George Washington cross
[1:12:04] the Delaware all these things are just
[1:12:06] forgotten about you know over time cuz
[1:12:08] we're creatures of have we just kind of
[1:12:10] I don't want to worry about that right
[1:12:11] now I don't even think about that who
[1:12:12] cares about pizza maybe we'll give Pizza
[1:12:14] you know somebody and you just look at
[1:12:15] and all of a sudden you start going
[1:12:17] through it what do you do when you go
[1:12:20] through it you discard the things that
[1:12:22] are of no value
[1:12:28] and let me tell you something if there
[1:12:30] is anything that presents itself to you
[1:12:33] that takes down the value that God
[1:12:36] himself has spoken over your life and
[1:12:39] placed into your life I say get rid of
[1:12:41] it you have the word of a prophet that
[1:12:45] says discard it shred it burn it get rid
[1:12:49] of
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:52] itall Lord oh my
[1:12:56] then brother BR said what you got then
[1:12:57] you got a solar system oh Hallelujah he
[1:13:00] give God can set the stars in order and
[1:13:03] said hang there till I call on you they
[1:13:05] stay there there's nothing going to move
[1:13:06] them when God can get a man in his hands
[1:13:09] till his senses conscience everything
[1:13:11] cleaned out until it stands with God
[1:13:14] behind it in the spirit there's not a
[1:13:17] devil in the world can poke a
[1:13:20] doubt in
[1:13:22] there where's in there
[1:13:26] that
[1:13:27] Soul cuz doubts can come in your
[1:13:31] spirit come on I I'll get to the words
[1:13:33] of the Prophet you know I've already
[1:13:35] read to you quotes already
[1:13:38] before but here is job here was job even
[1:13:42] in this situation here was David now see
[1:13:44] we could take well job and David you
[1:13:46] know they Brother Sam they didn't have
[1:13:47] the Holy Ghost like we had but here was
[1:13:49] Paul a man who had the Holy Ghost like
[1:13:52] you and I had it let's take the Lord
[1:13:54] Jesus he Hebrews 5:7 when it came down
[1:13:58] to him to go to Calvary the Bible said
[1:14:01] he was heard in that he
[1:14:06] feared woo was he fearing where he was
[1:14:09] standing with his father not at all see
[1:14:13] that's what's important is that that
[1:14:15] fear is not in
[1:14:17] you is that you know where you're
[1:14:19] standing with God like the Hebrew
[1:14:20] children they knew where they were
[1:14:22] standing with God I don't know what's
[1:14:24] going to come out of this ver
[1:14:25] Daniel didn't know what was going to
[1:14:26] come out of that dying Lion's Den but he
[1:14:28] knew where he was standing with God
[1:14:30] that's the most important thing don't
[1:14:33] let the enemy try to worry you for an
[1:14:35] answer I got to have an answer for this
[1:14:37] I got to have an answer for this I got
[1:14:39] to have an answer for this don't let the
[1:14:40] devil that's a de listen you are not
[1:14:42] supposed to clown for the devil you
[1:14:45] don't owe him no answer that even
[1:14:47] includes your own
[1:14:49] mind your own
[1:14:52] taking we have the answer
[1:14:55] God he's alive he's the same yesterday
[1:14:58] today and forever he's the god of his
[1:15:01] word but notice how the devil he'll come
[1:15:05] around and say you don't feel any
[1:15:08] better probably nobody's ever heard
[1:15:11] that your conscience has even gone to
[1:15:14] that I I want it to stay gone don't you
[1:15:16] right I want it to stay gone to that you
[1:15:19] know that that's your and I's
[1:15:21] responsibility so that those Gates stay
[1:15:23] in a place our lives to where when
[1:15:26] things come about in Satan cuz he'll
[1:15:27] come around he did it to the Lord Jesus
[1:15:29] over and over he would come to the
[1:15:31] prophet over and over he would even tell
[1:15:34] the prophet you're nothing but a bluff
[1:15:36] you think he if he told the prophet that
[1:15:38] you don't think he's going to come
[1:15:39] around for you and
[1:15:40] I amen but you see here's here's the
[1:15:44] approach to it Lord help me to stay
[1:15:47] strong in you be strong in the Lord not
[1:15:50] in myself not in how many good days I've
[1:15:53] strung together be strong in the Lord
[1:15:56] and in the power of His
[1:15:59] might oh my your conscience has gone to
[1:16:02] that the flu is so clear it shouts
[1:16:04] Hallelujah the outlets blow a whistle
[1:16:06] glory to God it shines out just as clean
[1:16:09] and clear for the word of God to work
[1:16:11] through the power of God that's the main
[1:16:15] thing I read this scripture to you
[1:16:17] before 2 Timothy chapter 1 ver7 for God
[1:16:21] hath not given
[1:16:23] us the spirit
[1:16:25] of fear right but of
[1:16:28] power and of
[1:16:30] love and of a sound
[1:16:33] mind that's the spirit that God's given
[1:16:36] us but not the spirit of fear watch how
[1:16:37] brother Bram will say this in God's way
[1:16:39] that's been made for us he said the
[1:16:41] worst thing the devil can put upon you
[1:16:44] is fear Now watch how he says this the
[1:16:46] worst thing he can put upon you is fear
[1:16:49] if you even had a Cancer and didn't fear
[1:16:52] and believe God would heal you you would
[1:16:55] be in too bad a shape God can take care
[1:16:58] of that if you're sick whatever it is if
[1:17:00] you don't fear so fear is one of the
[1:17:04] worst things that Satan can place upon
[1:17:06] the person the prophet never said cancer
[1:17:09] is the worst
[1:17:10] thing fear is so circumstances will come
[1:17:15] you see Satan loves to
[1:17:18] exploit times in our life when
[1:17:21] situations
[1:17:22] happen does take for example somebody
[1:17:25] gets in a car accident then it becomes
[1:17:27] where just natural if you start thinking
[1:17:29] about that oh my goodness I don't know
[1:17:30] if I should let so and so go and I don't
[1:17:32] I tell you what you just stay on this
[1:17:33] road you do this and do that and and we
[1:17:35] we may do that but then we have to come
[1:17:37] to realize wait a minut here there's a
[1:17:38] part of wisdom and there's a part of it
[1:17:41] I trusted God all those other times
[1:17:42] before why am I going to stop trusting
[1:17:44] him now right that's good see it it CS
[1:17:47] us to look back on you say well how does
[1:17:48] that happen Brother Sam well it's not
[1:17:50] like a light switch you see remember he
[1:17:52] is the strength of our life it's not our
[1:17:55] mind over matter you know what I'm just
[1:17:57] going to turn this kind of thinking off
[1:17:58] no that's not what it is it's called
[1:18:00] casting it out so if it's something that
[1:18:02] needs to be cast out it takes a stronger
[1:18:05] Force than that Spirit that's there is
[1:18:08] that right many scripture we go on on
[1:18:10] that now notice brother R says I've
[1:18:12] tried to prove by the scripture that the
[1:18:14] man that's born again of the kingdom of
[1:18:16] God has nothing to fear you're
[1:18:19] absolutely safely secure in Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] think of on through the scripture he
[1:18:25] would say you you're you know you have
[1:18:27] been you have been brought to me no man
[1:18:29] can come come to me except it were given
[1:18:31] to my father and I will in know why cast
[1:18:33] you out you're you're you're here in the
[1:18:35] palm of my hand you cannot be plucked
[1:18:37] out you've been sealed until the day of
[1:18:39] redemption see over and over it's
[1:18:42] assurances the word are you hearing me
[1:18:44] tonight the word does not come to
[1:18:46] destabilize
[1:18:48] you the word comes to stabilize you and
[1:18:52] it comes to make known if there's ground
[1:18:54] that you're standing on that you feel
[1:18:56] unstable well get off that ground let's
[1:18:59] get on stable ground there's Solid
[1:19:02] Ground And there's no other ground as
[1:19:04] solid as the word of the Living God
[1:19:07] there's no other place more sure than
[1:19:10] that of Jesus Christ he is a sure
[1:19:14] Foundation my thank you
[1:19:17] Lord the Bible says in 1 John
[1:19:20] 4:8 there is no fear in love
[1:19:28] no fear in
[1:19:31] love but perfect love Now watch how this
[1:19:34] goes but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:19:37] because fear hath
[1:19:39] torment now this love that we're talking
[1:19:42] about is the love of God it's the spirit
[1:19:45] of God remember Paul Jude would write it
[1:19:50] Paul would write over and over put on
[1:19:53] bows of mercy and the elect of God sink
[1:19:55] into Paul would even write in 1
[1:19:58] Corinthians 13 expressing Love Is This
[1:20:01] Love Is This Love is not that love is
[1:20:03] this and I'm sure probably every one of
[1:20:05] us have read it when you go through that
[1:20:07] scripture you go through the scripture
[1:20:08] oh oh it's not this and Lord I I I Lord
[1:20:11] I you know oh man I've got to you know I
[1:20:13] need to be more patient no it's not it's
[1:20:15] not trying to mimic the attributes of
[1:20:19] love it's just realizing Lord I need
[1:20:22] more of it you know what I need in my
[1:20:24] life I need more of it you see that
[1:20:26] takes it away from you and I trying to
[1:20:28] do it when we look at the word to
[1:20:30] realize if we just say Lord I need more
[1:20:33] of it this is why Jude could say keep
[1:20:35] yourselves in the love of God Amen is
[1:20:38] that right keep yourselves in it we we
[1:20:41] need more of the love of God even as
[1:20:45] God's love would work to call somebody
[1:20:46] in Repentance then his love works it
[1:20:48] moves even deeper sanctification then
[1:20:51] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:52] keeps on working all the way into
[1:20:54] maturity but watch what it's doing there
[1:20:56] is no fear in love but perfect love cast
[1:20:59] out fear because fear hath torment he
[1:21:02] that fearth is not made perfect or
[1:21:06] complete in love now when we think of
[1:21:09] that this is where God wants you and I
[1:21:11] to reside in our life to where as we
[1:21:14] said over and over here tonight is that
[1:21:16] where we're standing we know where we're
[1:21:18] standing with God and there is no fear
[1:21:21] of where we're standing with him that's
[1:21:23] where job was at job had no fear of
[1:21:25] where he was standing with God but
[1:21:27] evidently job had got into his mind of
[1:21:30] this is this could happen and it begin
[1:21:33] to dwell on it remember what I read to
[1:21:34] you the prophet said his fear is what
[1:21:37] made it
[1:21:39] happen his fear made it happen you let
[1:21:43] somebody go many many examples I have
[1:21:45] here where things have taken place in
[1:21:47] the medical realm and so forth even a
[1:21:49] man who thought he was going to die
[1:21:51] thought here it been you know a bullet
[1:21:53] had come in you know and and you know
[1:21:54] and somehow it had grazed him or or been
[1:21:56] a part of his clothing or whatever more
[1:21:58] and he thought he was fatally going to
[1:21:59] die he and the doctor was really you
[1:22:01] know looking at it but there was no
[1:22:02] blood he he wasn't bleeding at all but
[1:22:04] he in his mind he thought man I I've
[1:22:06] been shot I I'm going to die and and
[1:22:08] when he's taken off his clothes the
[1:22:10] doctor hears this on the ground and he
[1:22:12] sees a flattened bullet he picks up this
[1:22:14] flattened bullet now the man's heart
[1:22:16] rate everything else was going haywire
[1:22:18] at this time cuz he believed he was
[1:22:20] going to die although he had no wounds
[1:22:23] or blood coming out of of him but as
[1:22:25] soon as the doctor said here's the
[1:22:28] bullet and you don't there's no wounds
[1:22:30] around at all everything
[1:22:34] reversed well what changed that you see
[1:22:38] substance of fear is what caused his
[1:22:41] body to start to act in a certain way
[1:22:44] even where there's been other
[1:22:45] individuals that I could give you
[1:22:46] examples of things that was not even
[1:22:48] wrong with them but they believed it and
[1:22:49] they
[1:22:51] died why fear
[1:22:54] but think about faith though as soon as
[1:22:57] it was shown to him this is not what's
[1:22:59] happened look at this bullet there's
[1:23:01] nothing wrong with you now as soon as
[1:23:03] that happened that substance overrode
[1:23:06] that a fear what did it do it cast out
[1:23:09] that fear but how much more you and I
[1:23:12] even as Believers where perfect love can
[1:23:15] cast out all fear the devil might have
[1:23:17] you looking at a situation that looks so
[1:23:20] Bleak but just let God step in amen
[1:23:25] come on just let God step in
[1:23:29] on brother BR says you're always scared
[1:23:32] he said that's where the church is at
[1:23:33] you're always scared it's not going to
[1:23:34] happen and that's the reason it don't
[1:23:36] happen but love will cast love cast out
[1:23:39] fear and when you got love fear is gone
[1:23:41] but as long as you got fear love cannot
[1:23:46] Operate Now I want you to watch this
[1:23:48] statement as long as you got fear love
[1:23:52] cannot operate can love be there
[1:23:55] absolutely and fear can be there but
[1:23:58] love can't operate let me refer to the
[1:24:01] rest of this quote brother R goes in to
[1:24:04] talk about the bull right after this
[1:24:06] statement the bull he's walking in there
[1:24:09] he doesn't know that bull is there so
[1:24:12] he's not walking in there by faith I'm
[1:24:14] going to walk across this pasture no
[1:24:19] no he doesn't know that Bull's there but
[1:24:23] that bull remember had just killed a
[1:24:24] black man brother Bram talks about it it
[1:24:27] was there in the news but brother Bram
[1:24:28] didn't even know that bull was in there
[1:24:29] it had been sold moved from another
[1:24:31] place and all of a sudden this bull
[1:24:33] raises up and starts coming to him now
[1:24:35] brother Ram Will Tell Us in different
[1:24:36] plac of the message when he talks about
[1:24:38] this bull talks about the Hornets
[1:24:41] remember the Hornets in his backyard
[1:24:43] right the maniac you'll find it over and
[1:24:46] over in the message find the different
[1:24:48] accounts and brother br will say when
[1:24:51] those three different things rose up
[1:24:53] there was a fear that set
[1:24:56] in because the man was able to back it
[1:24:59] up the bull had already killed another
[1:25:01] man the Hornets could kill this is
[1:25:03] Brother Ram's own words he said I was
[1:25:06] afraid aren't you glad that brother
[1:25:09] brandom was not a show
[1:25:11] off aren't you glad he didn't say bless
[1:25:14] God I'm the messenger of the age I'm a
[1:25:16] real
[1:25:20] believer it's like I heard when Brother
[1:25:22] Carlos stood up here and told his little
[1:25:24] bit of his testimony on Vietnam he said
[1:25:26] these guys that get up and they talk
[1:25:28] about all these super stories don't
[1:25:30] believe them I've heard that from a lot
[1:25:32] of other veterans too he said we were
[1:25:34] hugging dirt to get out there were
[1:25:37] firing going on all around us you see
[1:25:40] sometimes when you hear things like that
[1:25:41] you know you just kind of look at say ah
[1:25:43] no this isn't just right at all you know
[1:25:45] it a't right because when we look at the
[1:25:47] prophet fear had come around him but
[1:25:50] brother Brown will make this statement
[1:25:51] I've always marveled at this brother
[1:25:53] Brown says at that moment he said I
[1:25:55] chose to think different thoughts I'm
[1:25:58] not going to die as a
[1:26:00] coward I've taken God at his word all
[1:26:04] the way through he said I'm not going to
[1:26:06] die as a coward I'll stand here right
[1:26:08] here in a challenge to that and you know
[1:26:11] what what was that was that brother
[1:26:13] brandom's own will that was The
[1:26:15] Sovereign Grace of God friends that's
[1:26:18] what it means to walk with God it isn't
[1:26:21] you or me Conjuring things up or Mar in
[1:26:24] a word from God it's just staying in
[1:26:27] fellowship with him and just like he
[1:26:29] lifted Enoch and like he'll lift you one
[1:26:32] of these days he'll lift you in
[1:26:35] situations and give you the strength you
[1:26:38] have need
[1:26:42] ofall watch out brother B we just I just
[1:26:45] read this as long as you got fear love
[1:26:47] can't
[1:26:48] operate that bull was getting ready to
[1:26:50] charge
[1:26:51] him and then it ran on up just like The
[1:26:53] Maniacs spit in his face and never you
[1:26:55] you know the stories but watch how
[1:26:57] brother Ram when he describes how that
[1:26:59] bull it got to his place it ran up and
[1:27:02] it just dead stopped what did it run
[1:27:05] into it sure didn't run into the
[1:27:08] genealogy of
[1:27:10] brandom it didn't run into the genealogy
[1:27:12] of brandom it didn't run into that DNA
[1:27:15] but it ran
[1:27:17] into I'll just say it to you plain it
[1:27:19] ran into the almighty
[1:27:22] God that's shouldn't be any power Marvel
[1:27:25] to us the Bible said the angel of the
[1:27:27] Lord encampeth round about them that
[1:27:30] fear
[1:27:31] him is that
[1:27:33] right so it ran so it was able brother R
[1:27:36] was able to S by God's grace take the
[1:27:39] grace to that he could come into a
[1:27:41] situation where he was there in that of
[1:27:44] love how many remembers brother Ram said
[1:27:45] over and over he said oh I wish I could
[1:27:47] live in that all the time is that right
[1:27:51] so when you go to reading about love
[1:27:52] don't don't read down through in first
[1:27:53] Corin Ians 13 and just start feeling all
[1:27:56] condemned remember there is an
[1:27:57] atmosphere to live in there is things
[1:27:59] listen for you to even forgive somebody
[1:28:02] to have patience and whatever more that
[1:28:04] is not you handling the word that is the
[1:28:07] word living its life through you that's
[1:28:10] right Hallelujah sure God came down and
[1:28:14] became tangible but he did not love you
[1:28:16] and I with human love he loved us with
[1:28:19] his undying
[1:28:21] love and he went to Calvary for you and
[1:28:24] I It's
[1:28:25] Supernatural
[1:28:28] Hallelujah watch how brother Ram says
[1:28:30] the very last line of this after this
[1:28:34] about the bull he said it was love go to
[1:28:36] that next one Brianna please it was love
[1:28:40] that took the fear
[1:28:43] away and God seen me through I don't
[1:28:46] know about you but I've been there I had
[1:28:49] been faced with Bulls I had been faced
[1:28:51] with Maniacs but I've been in situations
[1:28:54] where God came down and took the fear
[1:28:55] away and seen me through anybody else a
[1:28:58] witness on that God came down and seen
[1:29:01] me through situation we give testimony
[1:29:05] but God stepped in but God stepped in
[1:29:09] amen so to think of it of how that when
[1:29:12] when love itself you see when love is
[1:29:14] there when fear is gone then Faith
[1:29:16] becomes perfect let me just kind of move
[1:29:18] through some of these things of you know
[1:29:20] and this is where we if we can get get
[1:29:22] scare away brother BR would say place if
[1:29:24] we can get the scare away then love will
[1:29:27] come into its place and all of these
[1:29:30] these great these great uh placements
[1:29:32] remember when uh ji gyrus was on his way
[1:29:36] back to the house he had went he had
[1:29:38] persevered Faith had drove him to get
[1:29:42] the
[1:29:43] master it was revealed to
[1:29:46] him that
[1:29:49] he he is the Messiah is so good is that
[1:29:53] right that is so good but on the way
[1:29:57] back he gets him because he knows the
[1:30:00] word can handle the
[1:30:03] situation that's what his faith is
[1:30:05] saying you think it wasn't fearful no
[1:30:08] doubt many others had died many other
[1:30:10] children had died from whatever it
[1:30:13] was but there was something that took a
[1:30:16] hold of him and now is there on their
[1:30:18] way back to the house somebody comes out
[1:30:20] and says
[1:30:22] hey you don't even need to trouble him
[1:30:25] no more she's
[1:30:31] gone verse 50 of Luke 8 but Jesus heard
[1:30:35] it and answered him and said fear not
[1:30:38] believe only and she shall be made whole
[1:30:42] there he had a substance
[1:30:47] Revelation what was he doing before
[1:30:49] walking by faith but he was not revealed
[1:30:52] this is how it's going to be this is how
[1:30:54] going to come out but he had a
[1:30:55] revelation what I seen him do for others
[1:30:58] my situation is no different he walked
[1:31:02] and approached the word and on his way
[1:31:04] back walking with the word that was
[1:31:07] there to handle the situation fear
[1:31:10] wanted to come around him you see that
[1:31:12] fear didn't even say oh and then it's
[1:31:15] somebody oh you know somebody go to talk
[1:31:17] about the boss and they run out and
[1:31:21] there fear didn't stop it came right up
[1:31:25] to where he was and the master standing
[1:31:28] right beside
[1:31:29] him Satan don't have no
[1:31:33] respect no matter how long we've served
[1:31:35] no matter how many times the the power
[1:31:37] of God has moved on our life no matter
[1:31:39] how much of a change in our life Satan
[1:31:42] will try to come back I'm not talking
[1:31:45] about your soul when your Soul's been
[1:31:47] sealed and the love of God is entered
[1:31:49] there it doesn't matter where you are
[1:31:52] you can be an all Lion's Den you can be
[1:31:54] in a fiery furnace you are still a
[1:31:57] Christian you are still a genuine
[1:32:00] believer cuz you've got genuine
[1:32:03] substance
[1:32:04] faith in what the word has made
[1:32:10] you
[1:32:12] my my my my I feel like dancing right
[1:32:16] now
[1:32:28] in Mark chapter 11 let me try
[1:32:32] to try to bring this down here in Mark
[1:32:35] chapter 11 this is these are very key
[1:32:37] scriptures we're talking about with fear
[1:32:39] you know sometimes when
[1:32:42] we're let me just read the scripture and
[1:32:44] then we'll speak here a moment remember
[1:32:47] they're watching at this tree that the
[1:32:49] Lord Jesus had spoken he cursed the life
[1:32:52] of the tree and he it was dried up from
[1:32:54] its
[1:32:55] roots and Peter beheld
[1:32:58] it that it was withered up and verse 22
[1:33:01] of Mark 11 Jesus said have faith in God
[1:33:03] so he was pointing him what did it was
[1:33:05] have faith in God so the life was
[1:33:08] speaking contrary now notice remember
[1:33:12] the Bible tells us it had leaves on it
[1:33:14] but it wasn't even the time of figs
[1:33:16] brother Ram takes us into the message
[1:33:17] hidden life he said see he said it was
[1:33:19] all this blowing and shaking he said but
[1:33:22] it didn't have the fruit fruit on it and
[1:33:25] he said when God comes to inspect his
[1:33:27] church he don't want to just see leaves
[1:33:29] blowing he wants to see
[1:33:31] fruit and so when the Lord Jesus came
[1:33:34] there it wasn't even the time of figs
[1:33:36] but you see something was bearing it was
[1:33:38] it was not moving in the right context
[1:33:41] and so what did he do speak against it
[1:33:43] I'm glad that he speaks to things that
[1:33:45] can be going on in my mind in my spirit
[1:33:48] my life I'm glad that he can speak to
[1:33:50] and said hey wait a minute that's that
[1:33:52] that that's how to season that's not in
[1:33:54] line with my word so what does he do
[1:33:57] address the life or the spirit that's
[1:34:02] there notice he says in verse 23
[1:34:04] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:34:06] be thou removed and cast into the sea
[1:34:08] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:34:10] shall believe that those things which he
[1:34:11] sayth shall come to pass he shall have
[1:34:13] whatsoever he saith what things soever
[1:34:15] you desire When you pray believe that
[1:34:18] you receive them and you shall have them
[1:34:20] when you stand praying forgive if you
[1:34:22] have ought against any that your father
[1:34:25] also which is in heaven forgive you your
[1:34:27] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:34:29] neither will your father which is in
[1:34:31] heaven forgive your
[1:34:33] trespasses so it comes down brother Bram
[1:34:35] would go over this remember this was a
[1:34:37] scripture that brother Bram said it
[1:34:38] stumped me for the longest
[1:34:41] time he said you know I just had thought
[1:34:43] about well yeah the prophets and how
[1:34:45] they would speak and when the word would
[1:34:47] come to him and those things but how
[1:34:50] that the Lord met him out in the woods
[1:34:53] and each of the times he met him because
[1:34:54] it wasn't just once where squirrels were
[1:34:56] created but each of those times he
[1:34:58] brought him back into that portion of
[1:35:01] scripture brother BR said I marveled
[1:35:04] upon that scripture for so long until
[1:35:06] the Lord began to reveal to me the
[1:35:09] prophets had the word in them and they
[1:35:13] spoke according to that word that was in
[1:35:16] them because it comes to say if ye say
[1:35:19] not not if he says if you say to this
[1:35:21] mountain so there must be some something
[1:35:24] come to drop in our hearts now watch
[1:35:27] what watch what Mark 11 is about Mark 11
[1:35:30] is not us going out and just I'm going
[1:35:32] to speak this mountain out of existence
[1:35:33] it's about a sovereign word dropping in
[1:35:37] our
[1:35:38] lives that's so good this is why
[1:35:41] sometimes we've maybe went and we've
[1:35:43] been defeated because we thought well I
[1:35:44] I spoke to that mountain but first of
[1:35:46] all it's got to be a channel that's
[1:35:48] clear and that's open is that right the
[1:35:51] prophet just lays that out and I have
[1:35:52] heard but now I see a 1965 it's he place
[1:35:54] takes that whole message on job and
[1:35:56] dealing with being a clear open channel
[1:35:58] for inspiration to fall in and when
[1:36:00] we're dealing with that we know in order
[1:36:01] to be that kind of a channel where our
[1:36:03] lives has got to be lined up with the
[1:36:04] word and Satan is always busy to try if
[1:36:08] he can to put some little kink in our
[1:36:11] armor this is why the Lord Jesus would
[1:36:13] say when you stand praying forgive so
[1:36:17] what's he telling us faith is based on
[1:36:20] forgiveness that's what he's dealing
[1:36:22] with so he's dealing with all of he's
[1:36:24] not making it as though well well you
[1:36:26] know there's something you can't do
[1:36:28] anything wrong no when you when there is
[1:36:30] something that's done wrong conviction
[1:36:31] comes to your heart let's get into the
[1:36:33] City of Refuge let's make it right let's
[1:36:35] lift it off and put it back on the
[1:36:38] accuser notice do we want to be certain
[1:36:41] of God so if there's anything anything
[1:36:44] this is why listen to me very closely
[1:36:46] I'm just going to try to close on this
[1:36:47] point this is why when we're dealing
[1:36:50] with fear we're dealing with anxiety
[1:36:53] when I've worked with things whether
[1:36:54] it's in prayer lines or I I pray and ask
[1:36:56] God lord is there something that's there
[1:36:58] that's out of line you say why because
[1:37:01] listen in the presence of the Angel of
[1:37:03] the lord we can pray and that thing will
[1:37:06] lift but if there's something there that
[1:37:09] invites it back it'll come right back
[1:37:12] it's got to have the strength there to
[1:37:15] keep it
[1:37:15] away and remember we've got to stay
[1:37:18] fortified in the word Jesus said go and
[1:37:22] sin disbelieve no more right they said
[1:37:26] stay in the company of Believers is that
[1:37:29] right these are things God's not going
[1:37:30] to do for us we've got to do our healing
[1:37:34] means more to us My Liberty in my mind
[1:37:37] way means more to me so I'm going to
[1:37:39] keep my mind I'm going to keep company
[1:37:41] in the right things that believe the
[1:37:44] same
[1:37:47] way BR says it like this and what Dost
[1:37:49] thou hear if there's something in your
[1:37:52] life that condemns you he says you
[1:37:55] better make that
[1:37:57] right he says now you just can't operate
[1:38:00] right the Holy Spirit can't deal with
[1:38:03] you when you got
[1:38:05] prejudiced
[1:38:07] selfishness and all those things in you
[1:38:10] the Holy Spirit can never bless you now
[1:38:12] watch how he says this you might get
[1:38:14] some intellectual
[1:38:16] emotions some work
[1:38:19] up but see it's not a
[1:38:21] channel it's not an open channeled so
[1:38:24] you see where Satan's desire is to try
[1:38:27] to do what he can to clog that channel
[1:38:30] it's kind of like what they did in the
[1:38:31] days of Isaac where you had the
[1:38:33] Philistines and different ones the wells
[1:38:35] that Abraham dug they filled them
[1:38:39] up are you with me the Philistines
[1:38:42] filled them up kept throwing rocks down
[1:38:43] them rocks down them when Isaac his day
[1:38:47] came he said we're going and dig them
[1:38:50] out those places that God took our
[1:38:53] father are still the places that God
[1:38:56] wants us to be where the enem is trying
[1:38:59] to stop up the wells of God's word of
[1:39:02] real repentance of the baptism of the
[1:39:05] Holy Ghost those Wells of Our Father
[1:39:07] Abraham when a seven sealed book has
[1:39:10] come open those Wells have been emptied
[1:39:14] out those are still our god-given
[1:39:17] places and places where the enemy would
[1:39:20] want to try to fill up in your life f up
[1:39:23] complexes fill up fear fill up uncon un
[1:39:27] unforgiveness well so and so offended me
[1:39:29] and this what that's doing is it's
[1:39:31] blocking off a
[1:39:36] channelise Lord watch how brother Bram
[1:39:38] takes this here he says right the very
[1:39:40] next
[1:39:41] statement he said see what job said the
[1:39:44] things that I feared
[1:39:46] worse is come upon
[1:39:49] me see what was it it was something that
[1:39:51] was there that allowed that to attack
[1:39:54] if there's something that's unconfessed
[1:39:56] sin if there's something that's there if
[1:39:58] there's some sort of a fear or Scare
[1:40:00] that's what the word comes to do is to
[1:40:02] drive that out it comes to drive it out
[1:40:06] oh Lord how we
[1:40:08] need the word of the Living God how we
[1:40:11] need the word being alive in our
[1:40:15] services powerful a discerner of the
[1:40:17] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[1:40:19] more than that Lord we want hearts that
[1:40:21] even if I've got some things that are
[1:40:23] clogged up I do not want to hold back
[1:40:26] because of stones that I have in my
[1:40:30] Channel I want those stones out because
[1:40:33] that's what he's come to do is to free
[1:40:36] us from All Fears all doubts because
[1:40:39] that brings
[1:40:41] paralysis let's
[1:40:44] stand watch how brother bam says this
[1:40:46] goes on to say in this
[1:40:49] quote he says you want to be above
[1:40:51] everything
[1:40:53] where there's no condemnation or nothing
[1:40:55] to you you got to
[1:40:58] live like real
[1:41:01] Christians live in the presence of
[1:41:06] God live daily hourly
[1:41:09] momently say nothing do nothing go
[1:41:12] nowhere let it be Christlike everything
[1:41:15] you do all your actions God requires us
[1:41:17] absolutely to abstain from the
[1:41:20] world and separation
[1:41:26] now I know that I'm reading I'm reading
[1:41:28] this to Believers we're Believers here
[1:41:31] tonight but I realize these statements
[1:41:33] what I've just
[1:41:35] read to live above
[1:41:37] everything live in the presence of God
[1:41:40] live daily hourly
[1:41:43] momently that's a
[1:41:46] battle you realize even we could pray 24
[1:41:50] hours a day seven days a week
[1:41:54] and still have
[1:41:56] grudges offenses absolutely you know why
[1:42:00] because we've never got Before the
[1:42:02] Throne the prophet said as soon he said
[1:42:05] when you'll really get Before the
[1:42:07] Throne he said then you go to seeing
[1:42:11] what maybe that other brother has been
[1:42:13] through that other
[1:42:15] situation sometimes we wonder well I'm
[1:42:18] praying I'm praying but sometimes we
[1:42:19] stay so Earthbound in our prayers listen
[1:42:22] friends that's not it's not us it's not
[1:42:23] us trying to but it's to realize Lord
[1:42:25] when I'm coming into
[1:42:28] prayer I the real reality of prayer is
[1:42:31] for me to be able to look at somebody
[1:42:33] else like you look at
[1:42:37] them I tell you how I pray
[1:42:39] Lord I want to so love your people the
[1:42:43] way you love
[1:42:44] them over and over I ask God that I want
[1:42:48] to love him the way you love him I want
[1:42:50] to love him the way you love me brother
[1:42:52] Samuel you don't you don't feel you do
[1:42:54] no I I believe I do I I've got that I I
[1:42:57] believe that but I need more of it I
[1:43:00] need more of
[1:43:01] it because you see within this life
[1:43:04] sometimes you never lose your experience
[1:43:07] but sometimes we just
[1:43:09] need a
[1:43:11] renewing we need a refilling you know
[1:43:14] what a renewing a refilling a Revival
[1:43:16] you know what it does it washes out all
[1:43:19] the
[1:43:20] trash washes out all of the accumulated
[1:43:23] offenses and things that's just mounted
[1:43:26] up you know it just starts drifting down
[1:43:27] and hanging up on this and hanging up on
[1:43:30] this pretty soon you start hanging up on
[1:43:34] everything and I tell you I I don't want
[1:43:37] to be too big to go before God and say
[1:43:41] Lord I'm wrong if there's something I've
[1:43:44] done wrong I I I I want it to be
[1:43:48] right that's my prayer that's that's my
[1:43:50] prayer that's that's where I search I
[1:43:52] couldn't stand here and even have the
[1:43:54] confidence to stand here and preach
[1:43:57] that's why it's always blown my mind I
[1:43:58] I've never since just a a young boy even
[1:44:02] beforehand and then even starting to
[1:44:03] preach I I never could fathom in my mind
[1:44:05] how that sometimes you hear about these
[1:44:07] things where individuals go off and they
[1:44:09] do things and they go out here and live
[1:44:10] all kinds of immortally and then get up
[1:44:12] before the people I never understood
[1:44:14] that you say brother Sammy don't you
[1:44:15] believe in the Forgiveness of God I do
[1:44:17] believe in the Forgiveness of God but I
[1:44:20] believe in the full Deliverance
[1:44:23] I believe in that but when you see
[1:44:26] things it's just not it's just it's a
[1:44:27] Continuum I've looked at how could they
[1:44:30] have that confidence when I'm standing
[1:44:32] here no matter when I'm standing here
[1:44:34] when I'm in the office no matter what
[1:44:35] situation when I'm with my family and
[1:44:38] I've got to address situations in the
[1:44:40] home I don't have to feel his presence
[1:44:43] to know that he's there I know he's
[1:44:45] there he said he'd never leave me nor
[1:44:47] forsake me is that right right so when
[1:44:49] it comes to a situation dad this
[1:44:51] problem's rose up Dad this situation Dad
[1:44:54] we need to have prayer
[1:44:57] here I want to be able to stand there
[1:45:00] where my conscience is clear no
[1:45:03] condemnation and be able to stand there
[1:45:06] with the word Lord knowing I've done all
[1:45:08] that you've told me to do amen not
[1:45:10] anything on my account or any bragging
[1:45:13] but listen it's being a channel that he
[1:45:15] can move down in that's what God wants
[1:45:17] out of us friends that's that's the real
[1:45:19] victory in our life is living as a
[1:45:21] channel you're Victory is not confined
[1:45:24] to this
[1:45:25] building that where all of a sudden it
[1:45:27] has to be a service day and then all of
[1:45:29] a sudden we we're we got Victory no God
[1:45:31] wants to give you a deeper Victory than
[1:45:33] that he'll bring you Victory after
[1:45:35] victory in Services that's true he'll
[1:45:37] help you he'll encourage you but you've
[1:45:39] got to remember take that and continue
[1:45:42] to move on with god oh Lord take
[1:45:44] anything if there's anything that would
[1:45:46] hinder in my life I don't care what it
[1:45:48] is Lord I want to be a channel where the
[1:45:51] inspiration of the the Holy Ghost can
[1:45:53] drop
[1:45:54] into offended sure we've all been
[1:45:57] offended and we've offended other people
[1:45:59] but God let me have the same Grace for
[1:46:01] my brother my sister family whoever it
[1:46:04] is that you have for me
[1:46:07] Lord oh God help
[1:46:10] us anybody want to go with me before the
[1:46:13] throne say
[1:46:15] Lord I Want More Lord amen I want more
[1:46:18] of the love of God I want more like I
[1:46:20] described that months ago I think it was
[1:46:23] if I took a full hand Cube whole
[1:46:25] handfuls of ice cubes and you had a cup
[1:46:27] up here and I dropped them ice cubes in
[1:46:29] that cup you know what'll happen that
[1:46:31] water will go splash right out of that
[1:46:34] cup that's how I want the love of God to
[1:46:36] come in because the love of God will
[1:46:38] cast out fear it'll displace things
[1:46:40] that's not of God lord I just want I
[1:46:42] need a fresh baptism of the love of God
[1:46:45] a fresh
[1:46:47] refilling let's go to De
[1:46:49] prayer Heavenly Father
[1:46:54] Lord
[1:46:56] Jesus we're standing Lord God in need of
[1:46:59] you tonight once
[1:47:01] again Lord you come by way of your word
[1:47:04] to examine our lives and how thankful we
[1:47:06] are for it
[1:47:07] Lord Oh Our flesh Lord our flesh does
[1:47:10] not rejoice in that but Lord that inner
[1:47:13] man that Soul it hears the voice of
[1:47:16] Liberty it
[1:47:18] matches it
[1:47:20] matches as a son or daughter of God
[1:47:23] we were meant to live free
[1:47:25] Lord sometimes Lord with circumstances
[1:47:28] of life things can
[1:47:32] accumulate sometimes un known to us job
[1:47:35] even though he could say the things
[1:47:37] which I greatly feared he never said
[1:47:39] this in previous chapters this is only
[1:47:42] the third
[1:47:45] chapter but it was
[1:47:48] there it was something Lord that he had
[1:47:50] dwelt on a thought
[1:47:53] and allowed fear to
[1:47:55] attach although job had received in a
[1:47:59] previous
[1:48:00] [Music]
[1:48:03] chapter bragging on
[1:48:05] him and Lord the truth be known you
[1:48:08] didn't change your bragging on
[1:48:10] job you were the one that called the
[1:48:13] testimony meeting and invited the devil
[1:48:16] and bragged on
[1:48:17] him called him a perfect man not because
[1:48:21] he was perfect in his own self not
[1:48:22] because he did he was free and didn't
[1:48:25] make mistakes no he found his
[1:48:29] perfection in the word of the Lord in
[1:48:32] the
[1:48:33] sacrifice and that's where he
[1:48:36] rested but circumstances of
[1:48:40] life now
[1:48:42] Lord maybe there's Hearts here tonight
[1:48:45] whether here visibly or
[1:48:46] streaming maybe they've Lord never
[1:48:48] experienced that of the love of God down
[1:48:50] in their soul
[1:48:53] where Lord God that the
[1:48:54] fear of where they're standing with you
[1:48:58] has been
[1:48:59] dismissed I pray Heavenly
[1:49:03] Father May Lord God like your Prophet
[1:49:05] says at the end of the message the token
[1:49:08] oh Hallelujah Oh Glory when he asked the
[1:49:12] people
[1:49:13] Lord how many would want to receive that
[1:49:16] token then he said oh he said you feel
[1:49:19] he said just make everything right if
[1:49:21] there's anything in your life that's out
[1:49:23] of the line just make it right and he
[1:49:24] says oh he says now you feel that lovely
[1:49:27] Spirit coming in here that's the
[1:49:30] sweetness of the Holy Spirit he's wooing
[1:49:34] to Your Heart In A Love Affair it's love
[1:49:39] that does
[1:49:40] it oh he said just receive him
[1:49:44] now Lord
[1:49:48] Jesus Grant it tonight
[1:49:51] Lord and Grant it Lord for every heart
[1:49:54] that's here Lord that like mine Lord I
[1:49:58] want a fresh refilling
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] Lord Lord sometimes we get to looking at
[1:50:05] the wrong
[1:50:07] things sometimes Lord we hear things or
[1:50:11] feel different symptoms and we can go to
[1:50:12] start reading something and all of a
[1:50:14] sudden we start entertaining and
[1:50:16] thoughts can
[1:50:18] come Lord Jesus you never said that they
[1:50:20] wouldn't come
[1:50:24] but you told us to trust you
[1:50:27] Lord in
[1:50:29] God I will praise His word in the Lord I
[1:50:35] will praise His word Lord we want to say
[1:50:38] thank you
[1:50:39] Father thank you Lord for how that you
[1:50:41] have cared for our
[1:50:44] lives thank you Lord for how that
[1:50:47] throughout countless times maybe
[1:50:50] it's where your word has come and maybe
[1:50:53] you've anointed a man of God whether
[1:50:55] it's stood behind this pool pit or maybe
[1:50:56] in another meeting somewhere else maybe
[1:50:58] it's been listening to a message and
[1:51:00] that fear what wanted to reside and take
[1:51:03] hold was driven
[1:51:05] out maybe it was the coming of a Titus
[1:51:08] to
[1:51:09] us Lord I'm thankful for when Titus
[1:51:12] comes help us to be able to receive that
[1:51:16] kind of a comfort as well when you send
[1:51:19] to Titus oh it may not be by the name of
[1:51:21] Titus but it might be by the name of of
[1:51:22] one of my brothers or sisters Lord help
[1:51:25] us Lord to receive
[1:51:27] you in the form of one of our brothers
[1:51:31] or
[1:51:33] sisters Lord we love you I pray tonight
[1:51:38] Lord if there be any
[1:51:41] fear any thoughts maybe there's a a
[1:51:44] diagnosis maybe there's a doctor's
[1:51:46] report that's right
[1:51:49] now Lord I pray Heavenly Father
[1:51:53] Lord as every heart and every life would
[1:51:54] be
[1:51:56] clear Lord we want to stand upon your
[1:52:01] word like the Hebrew
[1:52:04] children like
[1:52:08] Daniel Lord God we want to
[1:52:11] stand upon your word because you are
[1:52:14] faithful
[1:52:15] Lord the father I pray that as your word
[1:52:19] has come Lord you would lead us to this
[1:52:22] point in this
[1:52:24] service may we take Lord God the things
[1:52:27] that you've
[1:52:28] said Lord God where the clarity of the
[1:52:30] spirit of God has moved down to cast
[1:52:33] those things Lord from our life holds or
[1:52:35] anything Lord that would want us to
[1:52:38] remain or to try to occupy but now may
[1:52:40] the spirit of
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:43] God dismissing every fear
[1:52:47] Lord Lord where Satan has stood over him
[1:52:50] to try to as he would come with that
[1:52:52] fear and then want to turn around and
[1:52:54] condemn them for being
[1:52:58] afraid but Lord You've exposed
[1:53:02] him and our hearts are settled on
[1:53:07] you whereas our army at one point was
[1:53:11] routed it's no longer
[1:53:13] routed we have heard the bugling call
[1:53:17] that says go forward my
[1:53:19] son go forward my son my
[1:53:23] daughter Grant it Lord I
