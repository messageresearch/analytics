[37:56] oven wouldn't bake a cake and you and
[37:58] sister rita laid hands on it and baited
[38:00] bake the cake for the believers to come
[38:02] over
[38:05] because when they first come to the lord
[38:06] just simple
[38:07] the simple faith
[38:09] i tell you i i just to me i was just i
[38:12] said thank you lord i was just so
[38:14] thankful god knows god knows what our
[38:17] need is so and
[38:20] i know uh brother willie and sister
[38:21] mercy were there i think at about 12 and
[38:25] uh helping to really set up and
[38:29] there's just no way that this the
[38:32] meeting and things could have went on
[38:33] without all the efforts
[38:35] that are that are apart and go into it
[38:37] and most importantly we just thank you
[38:40] for being here
[38:42] because when we have a meeting like this
[38:43] anytime anytime i feel on my heart with
[38:46] having a meeting i don't have a meeting
[38:47] just to have a meeting
[38:49] i don't even have brothers to come in
[38:50] just to say well i'm gonna have a
[38:52] brother come in
[38:53] but it's where
[38:55] i fill it up on my heart
[38:58] and it's not it's not just for me it's
[39:00] for all of us
[39:02] and we just we just really want to get
[39:04] in there and i just so appreciate each
[39:06] of you just
[39:07] amen just just being here and just
[39:09] really pitching in the other part is is
[39:12] really making the saints of god just
[39:14] feel welcome
[39:15] i mentioned this to the church on
[39:17] thursday
[39:18] over and over the brothers and sisters
[39:19] from south carolina the things that they
[39:22] themselves continue to mention was just
[39:24] the love
[39:25] that they felt from the people
[39:28] and they just continued to say it over
[39:30] and over perhaps i'm sure they probably
[39:32] said it to many of you and just the
[39:34] liberty
[39:35] and the atmosphere to be able to
[39:37] minister the word of the lord
[39:39] and
[39:40] perfect people no we're not perfect
[39:42] people
[39:43] by far none of us are perfect
[39:46] but if there's one thing brother branham
[39:47] would say it like this
[39:49] he said if i could have one he said one
[39:51] request
[39:53] he said i would rather have
[39:55] this congregation he's speaking of
[39:56] branham tabernacle
[39:58] he says
[39:59] i would rather have it be known
[40:02] for the love of god
[40:04] then
[40:05] we have all the gifts
[40:09] because i can tell you the love of god
[40:11] will work
[40:12] it works it's the holy spirit
[40:15] the love of god would
[40:17] reach out into a heart and a life that
[40:19] might be struggling
[40:21] the love of god will reach out into that
[40:23] life
[40:24] and encourage it
[40:26] you know the church itself
[40:29] we
[40:29] we you know children come to birth and
[40:31] we we have we we carry children
[40:34] right
[40:35] and as children are to come to birth
[40:36] what do you do you supply the different
[40:38] needs what's needed right you see
[40:42] different ones you see needs and needs
[40:43] to need to encourage here need to
[40:45] encourage there just like the sister or
[40:47] our lady here they begin to you know eat
[40:49] certain things craving certain things
[40:51] they're doing that for that life that is
[40:54] within them
[40:55] that's the same thing as a body of
[40:57] believers that even as the word is
[40:58] coming and then even as as we're looking
[41:01] on to be able to minister to one another
[41:03] so i i just i tell you i thank god for
[41:06] that amen and may it always be that way
[41:10] may it always be that way that's as our
[41:12] desire
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] i also want to just hear this morning
[41:18] musicians i won't keep you here i'll let
[41:20] you be seated i also before i ask you to
[41:23] stand for the reading of the word before
[41:25] that i'd like um
[41:29] sister gomez and sister naomi and sister
[41:31] maria my wife if you would stand
[41:36] this is
[41:37] purposely to embarrass you
[41:40] sister maria i want to i want to say
[41:44] i want to thank these sisters because
[41:47] they
[41:48] they took on the
[41:50] the sunday school
[41:52] and um
[41:53] they
[41:54] throughout all the
[41:56] all the years and everything from
[41:58] it was shortly after
[42:00] 2006 and uh until that time of when when
[42:04] covet had come in in 2020 and
[42:07] their their dedication and labor
[42:10] uh to the work because
[42:13] you know there's a lot that goes into
[42:14] that you know of with with that of
[42:17] sunday school
[42:18] it's not just you know there might be a
[42:20] little kids that were teaching in
[42:22] different ages but there's a lot of
[42:24] there's preparation that goes into that
[42:26] you know we don't want to they can we
[42:28] don't want them when they show up there
[42:29] they have a worksheet or you know just
[42:32] play a video or just do something like
[42:34] that no we want we want some things to
[42:36] be or some instructions some things to
[42:39] be
[42:40] mentioned there and so
[42:42] these sisters have from that time and
[42:45] and we just i want to say from the
[42:47] behalf of the whole congregation and
[42:49] some of them are going to be alternating
[42:50] in here
[42:51] um but i want to just say
[42:54] i really and as a congregation could we
[42:56] just give them a man a hand clap for
[43:01] everything
[43:06] amen god bless you thank you sisters and
[43:10] lord willing next sunday we'll be
[43:12] starting the sunday school and um
[43:15] sister lily derekot
[43:17] will be be taking that on it might just
[43:19] be a couple and they're very small
[43:22] very young children
[43:23] but um
[43:24] it's a start
[43:26] and so we just want we'll just see how
[43:28] the lord will just go from there and we
[43:31] just i just want to say
[43:33] um
[43:34] we are so grateful for the grace of god
[43:37] and that burden that the lord has placed
[43:40] a man upon different hearts and
[43:42] and so
[43:44] i don't think there's any other
[43:46] announcement that i have to do
[43:50] and i know this time always gets counted
[43:52] against me
[43:54] that's why i almost want somebody else
[43:55] to do announcements
[43:57] as soon as i step up here
[44:01] time starts going
[44:03] so
[44:03] if we could just if we
[44:06] just stand and we want to go
[44:09] before the lord once again and
[44:11] i know we're here you have needs and
[44:14] i have need
[44:17] each and every one of us certainly have
[44:19] a
[44:20] have a need from god
[44:22] we just want to invite him to come you
[44:24] know i have
[44:26] i have things that are right here before
[44:28] me that's
[44:30] been on my heart and just that god has
[44:32] inspired but we need him to come
[44:34] and inspire all of us
[44:36] we want him to come and speak to us
[44:39] i'm not interested never have been that
[44:41] i have to go according to all my notes
[44:43] because if you if sometimes if you've
[44:45] seen how many pages of notes that i have
[44:46] you would probably faint
[44:49] i i find myself doing more of that
[44:51] sometimes now because sometimes i don't
[44:54] all together i like to be able to read
[44:56] over the thought of where i'm going so
[44:59] don't faint
[45:00] you you might think some other times
[45:02] like oh brother samuel you must be
[45:04] preaching that 20 some 30 some 40 some
[45:05] pages of no no no usually it's only
[45:07] about five but i have to but all those
[45:10] things so if you've seen it all oh my
[45:12] [Laughter]
[45:14] you'd probably ask for different chairs
[45:16] in here but but god knows
[45:18] what we have need of and i'm just would
[45:20] you pray with me god will just come and
[45:23] just help us to get out of the way that

[47:37] stands on our behalf lord and lord we
[47:40] ask that you'll just come lord
[47:42] have your way in the precious name of
[47:45] jesus christ
[47:46] amen
[47:48] amen in mark chapter 5 i'm just going to
[47:50] read three verses of scripture
[48:00] verse 21 if we could
[48:03] and when jesus
[48:05] was passed over again by ship
[48:08] unto the other side much people gathered
[48:11] unto him
[48:12] and he was nigh unto the sea
[48:15] and behold there cometh one of the
[48:17] rulers of the synagogue gyrus by name
[48:20] when he saw him
[48:22] he fell at his feet
[48:25] and besought him greatly saying
[48:28] my little daughter
[48:30] lieth
[48:32] at the point of death
[48:34] i pray thee
[48:36] come
[48:37] and lay thy hands on her
[48:40] that she may be healed
[48:42] and she
[48:44] shall
[48:45] live
[48:47] may god bless the reading of the word as
[48:48] you're being seated
[48:51] i'd like just to continue that thought
[48:53] this morning we were looking
[48:56] a few sundays ago on the pursuit
[48:58] of your need
[49:01] you know what we read here with jairus
[49:05] there's much resolve
[49:07] in a decision anytime a person
[49:10] is to make a decision we should never
[49:11] make a decision too lightly
[49:14] the lord jesus even said
[49:16] what man
[49:18] goeth to war and doesn't first set down
[49:21] and consider all the cost
[49:24] or goes to build something and first
[49:26] does not consider all the cost
[49:29] what the lord jesus is speaking there
[49:32] he's dealing with
[49:33] it there's a decision and that decision
[49:36] is a decision that's made by faith
[49:39] because faith is not a short-range
[49:43] faith is a long-range vision
[49:46] faith doesn't see all the obstacles
[49:49] faith just knows this is the goal right
[49:51] here
[49:52] because there's a lot of obstacles
[49:54] there's a lot within that of the journey
[49:56] and
[49:56] you know the need arose jairus was a
[49:58] secret believer remember brother branham
[50:00] would preach that message uh regarding
[50:03] jairus matter of fact he would preach it
[50:04] many times the raising and healing of
[50:06] jairus's daughter the secret believer
[50:08] jairus and then brother branham would
[50:10] take and he would speak
[50:12] also once again under inspiration but he
[50:15] would tie it in prophetically and deal
[50:17] with jairus's daughter as a maid as one
[50:21] who was predestinated to life she was 12
[50:24] years of age she had come to the age of
[50:26] accountability
[50:28] she was laying dead and brother brandon
[50:30] will take that and type that into we
[50:32] were dead
[50:33] and it had to be the lord jesus had to
[50:37] come and to raise us to life
[50:40] and this is this is reality you know you
[50:43] can you or i can walk in this life and
[50:45] you feel like i have life but david
[50:48] david caught
[50:49] caught inspiration that there is a life
[50:52] that's higher than this life i mean
[50:54] think of it this life alone holds so
[50:56] many disappointments and sickness and
[51:00] everything else but there is a greater
[51:02] life a life that is beyond just of this
[51:06] life that's here and this is why david
[51:08] could say
[51:09] thy loving kindness
[51:11] is better than life
[51:13] it's something that is more than just
[51:16] the things of of this earth and of this
[51:18] season
[51:19] and this and you see
[51:21] many times this is where uh a person can
[51:24] become very uh settled and just with
[51:27] this life and being a part of this and
[51:30] being a part of a church or being and
[51:32] they just become settled with this life
[51:33] but in reality it's not being a part of
[51:37] a church that should be your aim of your
[51:39] goal
[51:40] but our aim and our goals should be
[51:42] i want to be part of jesus christ i want
[51:46] my life
[51:47] to be
[51:48] the display of what is written in here
[51:52] just like a packet of seeds that has all
[51:54] that writing on it
[51:56] and it tells you
[51:58] uh where it will start the germination
[52:00] and all the process and what it will be
[52:02] in its maturity and you flip on the
[52:04] front of the seed package and you see
[52:07] the plant in its maturity where it has
[52:10] reproduced
[52:11] what it really is
[52:13] that's what that's what we desire as a
[52:15] people of god
[52:17] we just don't want to be as we're kind
[52:19] of looking at that on thursday night
[52:20] just associated around we want to be
[52:24] united with jesus christ
[52:26] that's why that's why we've that's why
[52:28] we've come here and being united with
[52:30] jesus christ then it becomes the desire
[52:33] within our life so overwhelmingly then
[52:36] all i want to do is please him
[52:39] all i want to do is live for him and the
[52:42] the the goal of our life and the desire
[52:45] is the coming of the lord because you
[52:47] are longing for the very one that you're
[52:50] united with spiritually in your life
[52:54] i mean what young lady or what young man
[52:56] does not look forward to that that time
[52:58] of the marriage ceremony if they're not
[53:01] really looking forward to it then
[53:03] something's wrong on the vowel that was
[53:05] made
[53:06] but the vowel itself is now only an
[53:09] entry way for other love secrets and
[53:11] things to be expressed and there's a
[53:13] there's a looking forward to that moment
[53:17] to be united with him and we are looking
[53:19] forward to the promise because we are
[53:22] living in a moment where the lord
[53:24] himself has descended with a shout
[53:28] according to his word what's a shout
[53:30] it's to gather the people not not not to
[53:33] a personality but he's gathering the
[53:36] people unto himself
[53:39] and then as as as we know within this
[53:42] this time that we're living in it it's
[53:46] something that we have to look forward
[53:49] to
[53:50] and i i say it within this disregards
[53:53] jairus had a decision that he had to
[53:56] make now he was already a believer
[54:01] but he was a secret one
[54:04] he was ruler of the synagogue he had a
[54:07] position
[54:09] he had a position that if he makes this
[54:12] decision
[54:13] he knows it's going to cost him
[54:18] isn't it incredible how god
[54:20] allows that that decision to hover
[54:24] and knowing the time see sometimes for
[54:27] you and i we are so
[54:29] we get in a hurry and let's just be
[54:31] honest we all do
[54:32] we can get in a hurry with one another
[54:34] get in a hurry with god about things and
[54:37] yet
[54:38] god had all of this arranged
[54:41] god never looked down on jairus and said
[54:44] ah
[54:45] why did it take your daughter that's not
[54:47] what god god had all of this arranged
[54:50] these the things that you and i look at
[54:52] sometimes and then to see how god has
[54:55] things so uh
[54:57] intricately arranged in the fulfillment
[55:00] of his word to where sometimes we're
[55:02] just looking at the fulfillment here
[55:05] and yet we fail to recognize all of
[55:08] these parts had to be in position in
[55:12] order for that to be fulfilled
[55:14] and who is it
[55:15] that put these pieces in position the
[55:18] same god who fulfilled it because these
[55:21] pieces are part of the fulfillment
[55:25] is part of it that's very very key
[55:27] because even when brother branham when
[55:29] you take the message visions of william
[55:31] branham and brother branham begins to go
[55:34] through that he was very uh
[55:36] excited about the uh the the the little
[55:39] baby being healed when graham smelling
[55:41] came down and picked him up and remember
[55:43] brother bran went right into the house
[55:45] he picked up the baby and prayed for it
[55:46] it got worse
[55:51] why was that was it that god's desire
[55:53] was not to heal that baby no it was the
[55:55] will of god god gave the vision and the
[55:58] vision cannot fail
[56:01] are you hearing me now
[56:03] god that vision can't fail this word is
[56:06] a vision
[56:08] when the holy spirit gets upon the word
[56:11] the word moves from print to it becomes
[56:14] a vision
[56:16] it becomes something that is open that
[56:18] you and i can see now what brother
[56:21] branham had to realize at that moment oh
[56:23] my goodness this baby what's going on
[56:25] then then he becomes aware of the vision
[56:28] that oh the grandmother has to be here
[56:31] so-and-so has to be sitting in the
[56:32] rocking chair with the glasses and and
[56:35] and you know the handkerchief here and
[56:36] you've heard me say these things many
[56:38] times and you know what even though the
[56:41] hat had to be here grandma had to sit
[56:43] there brother branham never had to tell
[56:46] the people put the hat here put the
[56:48] handkerchief here oh you put the glasses
[56:50] here he never had to do that when god
[56:53] gave the vision all of those pieces and
[56:56] you could say what does it matter about
[56:58] a hat what does it matter about a
[56:59] handkerchief what does it matter where
[57:01] who sets where because all of them
[57:04] are a part of the fulfillment of that
[57:07] vision you know what that would show to
[57:09] me is that we don't have to be somebody
[57:13] or the preacher or a deacon or a song
[57:15] leader we just want to be part of the
[57:17] vision
[57:18] we want to be exactly where god has us
[57:20] to be i want to be in and a part of what
[57:24] god is doing
[57:26] and jairus is forced to a decision
[57:30] but god knows how to arrange things to
[57:33] where
[57:34] this decision
[57:36] now that he makes
[57:38] he's not even worried brother grave
[57:40] about being ruler of the synagogue no
[57:41] more
[57:44] there's something that's greater
[57:46] than being the ruler of the synagogue
[57:48] there's something that means more than
[57:51] his status
[57:54] and that is the need that is arose for
[57:58] the healing of his daughter his belief
[58:01] he's already heard about jesus
[58:04] now that decision is made and here he is
[58:07] and he approaches the lord jesus and he
[58:10] says if you come to my house and you lay
[58:13] your hands on my daughter i know
[58:17] she shall be healed
[58:20] what is that that's faith
[58:24] i like how brother benny said it on
[58:25] saturday night
[58:27] you know sometimes he says people can
[58:28] get to such a place where we're just
[58:29] going to speak the word we're just going
[58:31] to speak the word and we're just going
[58:32] to speak the word we believe in that
[58:35] we believe in that i'm witnesses of that
[58:37] i witness why the word is going forth
[58:40] healing comes deliverance comes the holy
[58:42] ghost comes
[58:43] but i'm also aware of the word
[58:45] jesus never never made alterations on
[58:48] the word and the prophet never made
[58:50] alterations on the word
[58:52] i find brother random standing in the
[58:54] latter part of 1965
[58:56] days before he'll be taken on home to be
[59:00] with the lord and he says oh i want to
[59:02] have a prayer line like we used to have
[59:06] but in building for that prayer line he
[59:08] preaches an absolute masterpiece of a
[59:10] message works as faith express
[59:14] and showing god's sovereignty and
[59:16] dropping his word so i'm just saying in
[59:18] this way like brother benny said brother
[59:19] baby said i'm a spiritual jew
[59:22] he said you tell you oh laying on hands
[59:24] that's for the jews oh i'm a spiritual
[59:26] jew
[59:27] i tell you friends listen let us never
[59:30] get too big
[59:33] you know i don't it should be when i
[59:35] need when we really got a need i don't
[59:36] care how that need has got to be met i
[59:40] know that jesus can meet that need
[59:43] [Applause]
[59:45] well i'm just claiming my healing i
[59:47] would i would look at a moment and say i
[59:49] want some divine assistance i want some
[59:52] faith to go with my faith
[59:55] are you hearing me now
[59:57] amen glory to god so when we're looking
[1:00:01] at this you know i think it begs the
[1:00:02] question that uh that we could really
[1:00:05] think upon that why are we here
[1:00:08] why are we here this morning
[1:00:11] there's got to be some reason or some
[1:00:13] purpose
[1:00:15] you got to you we've gathered here for
[1:00:17] some reason or there's it has to be that
[1:00:20] and to think
[1:00:21] before
[1:00:22] you could ever have that reason or that
[1:00:25] purpose
[1:00:26] there's already a
[1:00:28] god who already provided for that need
[1:00:33] that's why brother graham could say how
[1:00:35] many are hungering for divine healing
[1:00:38] i can ask that here this morning how
[1:00:39] many need healing in their body how many
[1:00:42] are desiring healing maybe spiritual
[1:00:45] healing and
[1:00:46] you know before before you could have
[1:00:48] that and hunger for it that shows
[1:00:51] there's already got to be a source
[1:00:55] that is present
[1:00:56] to meet your need
[1:00:59] amen before the brother graham could say
[1:01:01] before there was a creation uh there had
[1:01:04] to be a creator to create that creation
[1:01:07] he said because you believe that there's
[1:01:09] healing something has put that in your
[1:01:12] heart my mama if we could just take that
[1:01:16] right there something has put that in my
[1:01:18] heart that i i i not only do i need
[1:01:21] healing but there's a desire for healing
[1:01:24] something has put that in your heart
[1:01:29] for deliverance for the holy spirit
[1:01:32] something has put that in your heart
[1:01:37] who put that there the creator
[1:01:41] hallelujah
[1:01:43] and if there was none
[1:01:45] brother brad said if there was no
[1:01:46] healing he'd never put it in your heart
[1:01:49] are you hearing me now
[1:01:51] now you ought to really get that down
[1:01:52] and let it be personal
[1:01:54] if he didn't put it in my heart
[1:01:57] then then there wasn't then there
[1:01:58] wouldn't be anything there this is not
[1:02:00] just a whole congregation it's god
[1:02:02] coming in the midst of a people and
[1:02:04] god's speaking personally just like when
[1:02:06] we read this gyros ruler of the
[1:02:08] synagogue there were many people but you
[1:02:11] and i must step into that part of the
[1:02:13] vision like brother benny was saying
[1:02:15] about the woman there in memphis she
[1:02:17] read the bible about the of a woman
[1:02:20] but when she wrote it her need for her
[1:02:23] son's salvation she said eyes that
[1:02:27] shunammite woman
[1:02:29] now this is who i am now lord where is
[1:02:32] your elijah
[1:02:34] you see this is where you can say lord i
[1:02:37] am a believer o god now lord send the
[1:02:41] holy ghost i am a believer now lord
[1:02:45] sinned and released lord healing virtue
[1:02:48] to my life
[1:02:50] god put that there do not despise small
[1:02:54] things
[1:02:56] god put that there it's a need it's a
[1:02:58] need that has a rose in our life now i
[1:03:01] want you to think of this here for a
[1:03:03] moment that you know when you look at
[1:03:06] jairus
[1:03:07] that decision that is made it requires
[1:03:09] him to go beyond all circumstances that
[1:03:12] are surrounding him and you think of the
[1:03:14] word when we look at a need and
[1:03:17] something that's neat it's necessary
[1:03:20] it's not a want it's a need
[1:03:24] it's a need
[1:03:27] and and when you have a need of
[1:03:28] something this is when you get desperate
[1:03:34] you get desperate
[1:03:37] friends listen let's just be very plain
[1:03:38] here
[1:03:39] we are living in a world i'm not i'm not
[1:03:41] talking i'm not getting into politics we
[1:03:43] are living in a world it's been going on
[1:03:45] for years
[1:03:48] where everything is just handed
[1:03:50] right are you hearing me brother brahm
[1:03:52] talks about in the beginning of
[1:03:53] desperation he says you know he says you
[1:03:55] never appreciate anything he says like
[1:03:57] they talk about people being born with a
[1:03:59] silver spoon in their mouth you never
[1:04:00] appreciate anything
[1:04:02] the only things you appreciate is the
[1:04:04] things that you have to be desperate
[1:04:06] about and pursue
[1:04:09] is that right you don't appreciate it
[1:04:12] but you see this is where with life i
[1:04:15] tell you this the holy spirit is the
[1:04:17] gift of god how many believe that
[1:04:19] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:04:21] christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:04:24] the holy ghost
[1:04:25] you can't earn it you can't merit it but
[1:04:28] being that it's the gift of the holy
[1:04:29] ghost does not mean that god is just you
[1:04:32] know sending out and just you know
[1:04:33] throwing it out there like throwing out
[1:04:35] t-shirts and hats and everything in a
[1:04:37] gathering no
[1:04:39] god gives the bible says in the book of
[1:04:42] acts god gives the holy ghost to them
[1:04:46] that obey him
[1:04:50] and where is obedience not here
[1:04:52] obedience is from the heart
[1:04:54] and that obedience is based on faith
[1:05:00] god just doesn't give it out
[1:05:02] but yet he wants to give it matter of
[1:05:05] fact he wants to give it more than you
[1:05:07] want to receive it but when your
[1:05:09] receiving of it reaches to that place
[1:05:13] like jacob when he says i will not let
[1:05:16] you go until you bless me
[1:05:21] when he gets to that place then god
[1:05:25] releases you say but say now how do i
[1:05:27] get to that place well i would just say
[1:05:29] it like this if you're aware that
[1:05:31] there's things in your life the world
[1:05:33] and and you're still loving this i still
[1:05:35] like this a little bit i still like this
[1:05:37] then i this is what i would say to you
[1:05:39] this morning don't walk away and say
[1:05:42] well i guess i'm just not ready this is
[1:05:44] what i would be doing i would be saying
[1:05:46] god remedy everything in my heart in my
[1:05:50] life that's unlike you
[1:05:53] because you'll never clean your life up
[1:05:55] you'll never straighten it out you'll
[1:05:57] never make yourself good enough you can
[1:05:59] try to quit this and quit that but if
[1:06:01] you will pray and ask god to come and
[1:06:04] take it out of your life and let him
[1:06:07] come and do that lord make me to hunger
[1:06:14] come on friends
[1:06:16] my my my
[1:06:20] so we're talking about perseverance
[1:06:24] persistence
[1:06:26] brother said that's what perseverance
[1:06:28] means it means to be persistent in
[1:06:30] trying to make a goal
[1:06:32] it's not not trying to you know you're
[1:06:34] trying to do something and you're when
[1:06:36] you're perseverant you're persistent
[1:06:39] his parents a lot of times can recall of
[1:06:41] our kids asking us over and over
[1:06:44] right
[1:06:46] unless you stop that trend
[1:06:51] now all christians listen to this
[1:06:53] statement out of perseverance i'm just
[1:06:54] reading from here all christians must be
[1:06:57] persistent
[1:06:59] they must be persevering these are some
[1:07:01] groundwork i'm even laying and the only
[1:07:03] way you're able to do this
[1:07:06] is first to have faith in what you're
[1:07:08] trying to do
[1:07:12] even those of you that are here whether
[1:07:14] you went to college trade school or
[1:07:16] you've taken on another position or job
[1:07:19] you've got to have some people
[1:07:21] that encourage you
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:25] you don't have a boss or somebody says
[1:07:27] man you can't ever do this you'll never
[1:07:28] be able to do this where a mom and dad
[1:07:30] says you'll never be able to do this or
[1:07:32] a teacher or whatever now there might be
[1:07:33] some of those uh extraneous variables
[1:07:36] and things that's out there but the
[1:07:37] reality is there is encouragement that
[1:07:39] that is along the way but in also in
[1:07:43] order to have faith in order to be
[1:07:45] perseverant in something you've got to
[1:07:47] have faith
[1:07:48] you know why because when you don't have
[1:07:50] faith you can't be perseverant and the
[1:07:53] least little trial the least little
[1:07:55] thing comes up well i guess you know
[1:07:56] there was nothing to it that's because
[1:07:59] there wasn't any faith
[1:08:03] you say brother samuel but there's got
[1:08:04] to be faith to begin with there are
[1:08:06] doves but have you continued to water
[1:08:09] and feed that faith
[1:08:13] it's like we're talking about growing
[1:08:14] tomato plants
[1:08:17] you know what them tomato plants i
[1:08:18] remember when i worked at the greenhouse
[1:08:20] and i had to you know during the january
[1:08:22] and february we'd have little and then
[1:08:23] little things were just so tiny little
[1:08:25] things about like that we'd have to take
[1:08:27] them in our hands separate them boom put
[1:08:29] them in them you know the holes and put
[1:08:31] them in those flats those things were so
[1:08:34] so small
[1:08:36] they weren't like other plants were like
[1:08:38] they were like plugs some other plants
[1:08:39] were plugs you could take them out of
[1:08:40] the plug and plug plug plug plug plug
[1:08:42] these things you had to take them out
[1:08:44] put them down and pinch the soil but you
[1:08:46] know what when you go when when i had to
[1:08:48] go back there in the greenhouse
[1:08:49] eventually in may and around the time to
[1:08:52] get them things out and and take them up
[1:08:54] front where people were buying them like
[1:08:56] hot cakes and things like that they
[1:08:58] didn't look the same way
[1:09:00] now they weren't producing tomatoes yet
[1:09:04] are you hearing me now
[1:09:05] but they were on their way
[1:09:07] they had been in a place way back there
[1:09:11] in one of them covered greenhouses we
[1:09:13] had watered them we had taken care of
[1:09:16] them but they didn't look like the
[1:09:18] plants that i planted in the beginning
[1:09:22] are you hearing me what were they
[1:09:24] receiving oh my as my bus was watering
[1:09:26] them and you know he'd be spraying that
[1:09:28] stuff on them maybe it was miracle grow
[1:09:30] that blue looking stuff i don't know if
[1:09:32] that's what it was or not but you know
[1:09:34] it was all with the preparation now i'm
[1:09:36] sure if i would have followed one of
[1:09:37] those flats it would eventually come to
[1:09:40] a place i could have went to that
[1:09:41] person's house and eventually what i
[1:09:44] within that one little plant that was
[1:09:46] about that high i'm sure eventually
[1:09:49] there would have been tomatoes we'd have
[1:09:50] been taken off of there
[1:09:52] but you see if that little thing don't
[1:09:55] make it in the ground isn't cared for
[1:09:57] isn't nourished it'll never become a
[1:10:00] plant
[1:10:04] things that god does it don't start big
[1:10:06] but it's a big god who does small things
[1:10:10] and whatever he does brother it is an
[1:10:13] awesome thing
[1:10:17] if you have no faith look what he says
[1:10:20] here if you have no faith you're just
[1:10:22] jumping at it
[1:10:24] then you cannot be perseverant
[1:10:26] but when you really know it's the truth
[1:10:28] how many know it's a truth
[1:10:31] then there's nothing going to stop you
[1:10:35] you're really perseverant then and man
[1:10:37] of all ages that's ever been able to do
[1:10:39] anything and have faith in what they're
[1:10:41] doing were perseverant
[1:10:44] there's a basis of faith we were looking
[1:10:47] at this uh
[1:10:48] a couple weeks ago there's a basis of
[1:10:50] faith
[1:10:52] you know like brother brandon talking
[1:10:54] about people talking was saying well i
[1:10:55] believe i'd go out there that fence post
[1:10:56] and you know i touched it i'd be made
[1:10:58] well no there's no basis of faith in
[1:11:00] that
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:03] i mean you find people i'm not against
[1:11:05] watching or looking at and reading all
[1:11:08] these you know books and things like
[1:11:10] that and
[1:11:11] you know eat these kind of vegetables
[1:11:13] and
[1:11:14] i'm not against all those things but
[1:11:15] sometimes
[1:11:17] there's so much faith that's placed upon
[1:11:19] those things
[1:11:20] instead of instead of coming in just
[1:11:22] simplicity not saying it's wrong to take
[1:11:24] care of our health and our body but but
[1:11:26] sometimes the things that we miss is
[1:11:29] what's important and that's the word of
[1:11:31] god the bible tells us in the book of
[1:11:32] proverbs it shall be health to thy navel
[1:11:37] come on friends i think it ought to be a
[1:11:39] time that we're we're looking for the as
[1:11:42] the word of god it's what produces a
[1:11:44] healthy life the word of god is what
[1:11:47] produces and gives you strength to
[1:11:49] resist sin
[1:11:52] hallelujah it packs within it brother i
[1:11:55] don't care what kind of microbe or not
[1:11:57] or ladybug or what kind of pest would
[1:12:00] come up there is strength in the word of
[1:12:03] god though it comes upon you he might
[1:12:06] want to try to nibble at you but there
[1:12:08] is strength within that word that's
[1:12:11] pulsating through the branches that are
[1:12:15] birthed in the vine
[1:12:17] hallelujah there's got to be a basis of
[1:12:20] faith and the bible tells us that faith
[1:12:23] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:12:26] word of god
[1:12:28] listen to this statement out of
[1:12:29] perseverance i'm just quote reading from
[1:12:31] some of these quotes he said if you're a
[1:12:33] sick person in here tonight and could
[1:12:35] just have faith in god like george
[1:12:37] washington your delaware that stands
[1:12:40] before you tonight so your sickness is
[1:12:43] your delaware
[1:12:46] your unbelief or whatever that it is for
[1:12:48] your need that's your delaware
[1:12:51] yeah come on now
[1:12:53] if he says would it would have to melt
[1:12:56] away
[1:12:57] some way that you would cross it no
[1:13:00] matter what your opposition is
[1:13:02] you would still cross it now let me just
[1:13:05] pause right here as i just feel him
[1:13:07] directing me this way
[1:13:09] because when we preach on faith
[1:13:11] sometimes
[1:13:12] some listen
[1:13:13] faith
[1:13:14] is is is is what god has given to you
[1:13:18] and i for us to contact him
[1:13:21] faith is what god has a work that god
[1:13:25] does in our life to raise our faith into
[1:13:27] that place
[1:13:28] of victory in our life that then we can
[1:13:32] walk in victory
[1:13:34] but listen
[1:13:35] just because and i hope you're hearing
[1:13:37] me now i'm going to read to there's a
[1:13:39] few places in here we'll get to
[1:13:41] that just because there's something that
[1:13:43] doesn't come right away
[1:13:45] or something you're waiting on is no
[1:13:48] sign that you don't have faith
[1:13:51] well brother samuel we were praying for
[1:13:52] so and so and and you know they they
[1:13:55] died
[1:13:56] really
[1:13:59] really what i'm saying is surely there's
[1:14:01] got to be something wrong
[1:14:04] but have you considered
[1:14:06] that it could have been the timing of
[1:14:08] the lord
[1:14:11] come on friends
[1:14:13] it can be the timing of the lord and
[1:14:15] remember healing is not just something
[1:14:17] in this lifetime
[1:14:20] there's four anointings lion anointing
[1:14:23] is that right
[1:14:24] there's ox anointing there's man
[1:14:26] anointing and eagle anointing oh then
[1:14:29] those anointings have come in healing as
[1:14:31] well
[1:14:32] many times we want that of that uh you
[1:14:34] know eagle anointing just catch us away
[1:14:36] two miracle we're healed right now
[1:14:39] oh we like that when nobody wants to
[1:14:42] nobody asks for the ox anointing
[1:14:44] because that healing comes when we cross
[1:14:46] to the other side
[1:14:49] i'm glad i had one amen on that one
[1:14:52] [Laughter]
[1:14:54] but the ship but in then with him
[1:14:56] because remember all those anointings
[1:14:58] come together but the lion itself is to
[1:15:00] be able to stand there with a boldness
[1:15:02] god has spoken
[1:15:05] oh you don't feel no different but god
[1:15:07] has spoken this is god's word and if
[1:15:10] there hadn't been nobody else god wrote
[1:15:12] it for me it's something that's
[1:15:14] pulsating in my life can you explain it
[1:15:17] i don't have to explain it there's
[1:15:19] something deeper than any explanation
[1:15:22] what is that the lion roaring
[1:15:28] and then we have the man anointing
[1:15:31] surgeries
[1:15:34] doctor oh we get quiet on this one too
[1:15:36] boy
[1:15:37] you know why
[1:15:38] because we're still carrying sometimes
[1:15:40] past 11.
[1:15:42] past 11
[1:15:44] past teachings
[1:15:47] and the prophet was very clear god
[1:15:49] performs miracles through surgery
[1:15:52] god performs miracles through medicine
[1:15:56] come on friends
[1:15:59] however god's going to do it
[1:16:01] fine with me
[1:16:03] some way one way or another then walls
[1:16:05] of jericho are coming down
[1:16:09] that's the kind of resolute don't base
[1:16:11] your faith on i don't feel this right
[1:16:13] don't feel different here no your faith
[1:16:15] is based on the word i have met god's
[1:16:18] requirements that settles it what are
[1:16:20] you going to do i'm going to wash him
[1:16:22] while i wait
[1:16:26] whoa glory be to god
[1:16:28] my my my my
[1:16:31] notice no matter what your opposition is
[1:16:33] you would still cross it you would be
[1:16:35] persistent so persistent until that
[1:16:38] cancer tumor whatever it is would never
[1:16:40] be able to stand there because you would
[1:16:42] cross over to the promise that god had
[1:16:44] given you i couldn't help but read this
[1:16:46] and time i read about different things
[1:16:48] with cancer and things like that and i
[1:16:49] think about different ones but i think
[1:16:51] about brother ron spencer you know as
[1:16:53] they've they've looked there and you
[1:16:55] know there hadn't been any any decrease
[1:16:57] in the cancer in his body
[1:17:01] the doctors told him that
[1:17:03] but you know what
[1:17:05] people around the world
[1:17:08] are wanting to know
[1:17:09] what is it that's about this man
[1:17:14] brother ron when you if you watch him
[1:17:15] minister he wears that white ribbon
[1:17:18] now why ribbon deals with
[1:17:20] for for cancer
[1:17:23] here's what the doctors have said around
[1:17:25] they've sprinted around
[1:17:28] they said if you want to see something
[1:17:30] that works
[1:17:31] watch this man he's got something that
[1:17:33] works
[1:17:34] you that people tuning in and watching
[1:17:37] it think about it i like how brother ron
[1:17:40] says stupid devil
[1:17:44] i mean to me it's like this here is a
[1:17:46] man stage four cancer he could be at
[1:17:49] home crying moping and everything else
[1:17:52] he has a right to do that but there is
[1:17:54] something greater than the circumstance
[1:17:58] faith isn't always i'm getting what i
[1:18:00] want but faith is to stand there in the
[1:18:03] midst of it all and says god is still
[1:18:06] god
[1:18:09] that's faith
[1:18:14] like the little over there
[1:18:16] stance cliff baby
[1:18:18] where brother random opens in the
[1:18:19] message messiah in 1961
[1:18:22] and here with that statscliff baby they
[1:18:25] but they said we're going to fly you
[1:18:26] over here on a jet
[1:18:27] brother brown went and prayed about it
[1:18:29] and the holy spirit said don't touch it
[1:18:31] it's the hand of the lord
[1:18:34] i'll tell you when i hear that right
[1:18:36] there i think
[1:18:37] beyond what sister stance had just had
[1:18:39] to think i i think that took that god
[1:18:44] god was really dealing with some mature
[1:18:45] believers
[1:18:47] she didn't cop an attitude with brother
[1:18:48] branham on the phone
[1:18:50] oh so my baby ain't worth it huh
[1:18:53] you think the devil won there
[1:18:57] you think the devil the devil will oh if
[1:18:59] he would really if he really cared if he
[1:19:01] this or that but as a believer see she
[1:19:04] was a believer
[1:19:06] her and her husband and when brother
[1:19:08] branham said that that part right there
[1:19:10] god has forbidden that's the hand of the
[1:19:12] lord let me tell you something right
[1:19:14] there that requires faith
[1:19:18] trust isn't when you understand
[1:19:20] everything that ain't faith
[1:19:23] but faith is when you don't understand
[1:19:26] it i don't know how it's going to come
[1:19:27] out but that's faith
[1:19:32] the little baby went on home
[1:19:34] to be with the lord is that right
[1:19:37] and sister stansley got the feeling
[1:19:39] i must not have had
[1:19:41] faith
[1:19:42] brother brandon writes
[1:19:44] writes to her
[1:19:45] he says oh no sister sister stackliff
[1:19:48] you have great faith because he said
[1:19:50] when god
[1:19:52] made the decision to take your baby he
[1:19:54] said you stood firm
[1:19:59] so even when things don't go our way
[1:20:04] come on friends when they don't go our
[1:20:07] way this is where faith matters
[1:20:11] it's got to be a faith
[1:20:14] walk
[1:20:17] oh glory be to god
[1:20:19] men can only be persistent after they
[1:20:21] have heard from god and faith is is only
[1:20:24] based on the word of god because faith
[1:20:26] comes by hearing the word of god now you
[1:20:29] know faith the bible says this in
[1:20:30] hebrews 11 1
[1:20:32] faith is the substance
[1:20:35] of things
[1:20:36] expected
[1:20:39] it's a substance
[1:20:41] it's the evidence
[1:20:43] of things not seen
[1:20:48] you know an evidence
[1:20:50] is something that's real
[1:20:53] substance is something that's real
[1:20:56] let me tell you something god brother
[1:20:58] branham places it this way in the
[1:20:59] message confirmation and evidence
[1:21:02] god has made man
[1:21:04] you and me
[1:21:06] in that way
[1:21:07] that we must have a confirmation
[1:21:11] for evidence
[1:21:13] god built us that way
[1:21:16] so that it would be a faith walk that
[1:21:18] what our faith is based on it's a it's
[1:21:21] an evidence in our life
[1:21:24] it's an evidence that's that's greater
[1:21:26] than any circumstance that comes up
[1:21:28] faith is a substance it's not a myth
[1:21:31] brother bram says it'd be just like
[1:21:33] if i was starving to death
[1:21:36] he said then you gave me a quarter
[1:21:39] if the loaf of bread cost a quarter boy
[1:21:41] we'd have to go back a hundred years for
[1:21:43] that one wouldn't we
[1:21:46] if it only cost a quarter right then
[1:21:50] though i don't have the loaf of bread
[1:21:52] i've got the purchasing power are you
[1:21:56] hearing me now
[1:21:57] he said i can be just as happy
[1:22:01] with the quarter
[1:22:02] as i would with the loaf of bread why
[1:22:06] because i've got already the evidence
[1:22:10] it's mine
[1:22:13] though i don't have bread in my hands
[1:22:15] though i'm not buttering up and putting
[1:22:17] jelly on it i've already got it
[1:22:21] so what is faith faith is a settled
[1:22:25] something in the heart that you just say
[1:22:28] i just know
[1:22:30] i can't explain it
[1:22:32] it's just i just know
[1:22:34] that's faith that's god working with
[1:22:37] faith within our life and god has said
[1:22:40] it in that way and that's why that the
[1:22:43] initial way the initial way
[1:22:45] of having faith
[1:22:48] is by hearing the written word of god
[1:22:50] brother adam you'll find him
[1:22:53] in the message perfect faith
[1:22:55] and then clear back here
[1:22:58] a year before in confirmation and
[1:22:59] evidence
[1:23:01] and in other places brother branham is
[1:23:03] dealing with how that in his life
[1:23:06] he's able to have
[1:23:09] a faith that anchors
[1:23:12] and he's dealing with
[1:23:13] how that that faith has been built
[1:23:16] within his life i don't want to that's
[1:23:18] that's a separate thought i know i can't
[1:23:20] continue to speak on all of that but
[1:23:22] there's a faith that he started with and
[1:23:24] it's a faith that's been built i i think
[1:23:26] it's good that we can have lives and
[1:23:29] hearts brothers and sisters around us
[1:23:31] where there ought to be a preeminent
[1:23:33] faith in other words there ought to be
[1:23:35] salt that actually causes thirst
[1:23:39] and seeing reality it's not to be like
[1:23:41] brother so-and-so or sister so and so
[1:23:44] but to say i want that faith of that
[1:23:46] faith that preeminence of christ to be
[1:23:49] so preeminent in my life just as it is
[1:23:51] in there because you realize it's not
[1:23:54] based on somebody's family tree but you
[1:23:57] have a right to partake of that same
[1:24:00] preeminent grace of god's life
[1:24:04] friends we sell ourselves too short many
[1:24:07] times
[1:24:09] if there's things that we see out before
[1:24:11] us ask god for it
[1:24:14] why do you think god's showing it god
[1:24:16] ain't showing you things to rub your
[1:24:18] nose in the dirt god's making it before
[1:24:20] you when he comes and he vindicates his
[1:24:23] word it's just like paul said my
[1:24:26] preaching and teaching was not within
[1:24:28] passing words of man's wisdom but that
[1:24:31] your faith would stand in man but that
[1:24:34] your faith might stand in the power of
[1:24:37] almighty god
[1:24:40] so many times i think we're selling
[1:24:42] ourselves too short
[1:24:44] brother brahman this message said i
[1:24:46] wonder he says he said i believe we as
[1:24:48] people don't realize the position we're
[1:24:50] in
[1:24:51] what he's talking about
[1:24:53] is there is sitting there at the
[1:24:55] tabernacle and seeing what god is doing
[1:25:00] healing taking place
[1:25:02] lives being changed the holy spirit
[1:25:04] coming and changing life the word coming
[1:25:07] forth and discerning
[1:25:10] i tell you what a position
[1:25:12] may god help us to recognize the
[1:25:14] position we're in
[1:25:16] i'm talking about right now because the
[1:25:19] past is the past
[1:25:21] you could go back oh i remember back in
[1:25:23] 93 that's history
[1:25:26] oh i remember back in 2019 that's
[1:25:28] history
[1:25:30] where are you at today with god
[1:25:36] this message is not a camp i'm preaching
[1:25:38] now
[1:25:39] this message is not a station are you
[1:25:41] hearing me
[1:25:43] and why little bethlehem brother bradham
[1:25:45] takes and he stops in that message and
[1:25:47] he's dealing with why wasn't it that he
[1:25:50] wasn't born in shiloh why was he not
[1:25:52] born here why was it little bethlehem
[1:25:55] and then brother branham will type the
[1:25:58] ministry of restoration where god said i
[1:26:01] will restore the ministry of luther the
[1:26:04] ministry of wesley and the ministry of
[1:26:06] pentecost and he says we in this hour
[1:26:09] are not called to another station
[1:26:14] you know what that means
[1:26:17] it's like on a flight
[1:26:21] sometimes we have connecting flights
[1:26:23] and you know what you don't walk off the
[1:26:25] wing of one airplane in midair to
[1:26:27] another
[1:26:28] you got to stop at a station or an
[1:26:30] airport
[1:26:32] hopefully enough time to grab a coffee
[1:26:35] hopefully they get you in there in time
[1:26:36] so you're not running to your next
[1:26:37] flight
[1:26:38] come on now
[1:26:40] we are not stopping at another station
[1:26:44] are you hearing me this message is the
[1:26:47] final
[1:26:49] unfolding of the mystery of god it's the
[1:26:52] final impartation of life and it's not
[1:26:56] just a portion but it's christ himself
[1:27:00] come down in veiled in bright form we
[1:27:03] are not stopping and that's where you
[1:27:05] have to look in your life i look in my
[1:27:08] life we are not promised a station
[1:27:12] we're promised the change of our
[1:27:16] bodies so i'm going to keep pressing on
[1:27:20] when brother branham went beyond the
[1:27:22] curtain of time he never came back and
[1:27:24] said relax
[1:27:26] relax
[1:27:27] keep relaxing keep relaxing keep
[1:27:30] relaxing people know when it came beyond
[1:27:33] from beyond the curtain of time think
[1:27:35] about it
[1:27:36] this was a man who had visitation after
[1:27:39] visitation after visitation but when he
[1:27:42] went beyond the curtain of time
[1:27:46] it affected him in such a way
[1:27:50] there were decisions that he was already
[1:27:53] resolute he became even more
[1:27:58] resolute hello
[1:28:01] he said this one experience
[1:28:03] has changed me
[1:28:05] i can never be the same william branham
[1:28:09] that i was
[1:28:10] oh wow brother sammy you mean brother
[1:28:12] brown got born again no he was already
[1:28:14] born again
[1:28:16] see one thing that brother branham could
[1:28:18] recognize
[1:28:19] and it's to speak to you and i
[1:28:21] this message is not a station
[1:28:26] it's not a
[1:28:27] praise god we made it
[1:28:30] no
[1:28:31] it goes higher
[1:28:33] and higher
[1:28:34] and higher that's where every
[1:28:36] organization failed and became an
[1:28:39] organization
[1:28:40] are you hearing me now is your life
[1:28:42] worthy of the gospel brother braham says
[1:28:43] if we fail to walk with him daily then
[1:28:47] we take on
[1:28:49] an organizational life
[1:28:53] now i would say this because i know this
[1:28:55] i would say this for every one of us in
[1:28:56] my heart included not one of us would
[1:28:58] hold our hands up and say i want an
[1:29:00] organizational life we don't want an
[1:29:02] organizational life
[1:29:04] an organizational life
[1:29:06] is not god's life
[1:29:09] is that right
[1:29:11] you can be members of churches i just
[1:29:12] had just had something here that
[1:29:15] had you know
[1:29:16] well there's there's things you know i i
[1:29:18] just had read
[1:29:20] an article this is even by a
[1:29:23] somebody that's not even walking in the
[1:29:25] in the light that we're in
[1:29:27] and here's the headline why are the
[1:29:29] churches getting so dark inside
[1:29:33] to where it's only the lights on the
[1:29:35] stage this ain't a show
[1:29:39] are you hearing me now this ain't a show
[1:29:42] but that's all churches have become it's
[1:29:44] shows run by business leaders
[1:29:49] that have never met god they've never
[1:29:51] met the pillar of fire
[1:29:54] that's why they're twisted up in their
[1:29:55] marriages that's why they can allow
[1:29:57] homosexuality that's why they can live
[1:30:00] in adultery that's why they can't preach
[1:30:02] on sin because they're still bound with
[1:30:05] sin
[1:30:07] and you can't proclaim liberty unless
[1:30:10] you're free
[1:30:14] but god has provided a liberating power
[1:30:18] in this hour
[1:30:19] it didn't have to be a new blood
[1:30:23] but the reality of that voice where
[1:30:25] satan had tried to show it up and
[1:30:27] silence it but the veil has been broken
[1:30:30] and god is no longer silent but he's
[1:30:33] speaking
[1:30:36] the opening of the seventh seal breaks
[1:30:39] the silence
[1:30:41] god is no longer silent but god is
[1:30:44] speaking openly and clearly and the
[1:30:47] blood speaks
[1:30:49] better things
[1:30:51] better things than what wesley had
[1:30:53] better things than what pentecost had it
[1:30:56] speaks better things what is it grace
[1:30:59] grace it's time for rapture
[1:31:02] [Applause]
[1:31:07] and there's a little woman on earth
[1:31:09] she's in position and she's learning in
[1:31:12] silence
[1:31:15] hello somebody she's under the headship
[1:31:17] of the word oh my and she's hearing the
[1:31:20] lovely voice of her bridegroom speaking
[1:31:22] unto her she's maturing in the time
[1:31:26] of silence
[1:31:28] not silence to us
[1:31:31] the silence to the world
[1:31:34] the initial way of
[1:31:36] having faith is by hearing the word
[1:31:39] i want you to think about
[1:31:41] brother branham would
[1:31:42] say this here i've got to find this
[1:31:44] this place in here
[1:31:47] you know when god
[1:31:49] when he says a certain thing
[1:31:52] it wouldn't matter
[1:31:54] brother branham could say it like this
[1:31:55] he says when it says a certain way it
[1:31:57] says he said this is how faith is
[1:31:58] talking about that quarter faith is
[1:32:00] something that you have
[1:32:02] and you know you got it
[1:32:04] and when you receive faith that god is
[1:32:07] then that god is going to give you this
[1:32:10] listen your healing might not be there
[1:32:13] yet
[1:32:15] what's he talking about the
[1:32:16] manifestation of it
[1:32:18] but something
[1:32:20] has anchored within you
[1:32:22] that tells you
[1:32:24] it's going to be all right
[1:32:29] now
[1:32:32] let me just try to
[1:32:34] just move beyond these
[1:32:37] these points right here let me get to
[1:32:38] where i
[1:32:39] wanted to get to today
[1:32:45] now
[1:32:47] let me just let me just move to this
[1:32:50] i don't want to say clothes because i
[1:32:51] don't want you closing me off right now
[1:32:54] let's get back to drivers can we
[1:32:58] a lot more we can say but we'll say that
[1:33:00] i just feel that's for the next
[1:33:03] let me can i read a couple of scriptures
[1:33:04] here
[1:33:06] in mark 5 35 i think it's quite at the
[1:33:09] end of the
[1:33:10] of the notes i gave you
[1:33:13] while he yet spake now remember
[1:33:16] jairus
[1:33:17] jesus is going with jairus right now
[1:33:20] they're on their way
[1:33:21] in the midst of going
[1:33:23] the woman with the issue of blood
[1:33:25] she receives her healing
[1:33:28] so it goes to show you that god
[1:33:31] is not just
[1:33:32] here just to take care of one need
[1:33:34] although he'll come to take care of one
[1:33:35] need
[1:33:37] but when god comes
[1:33:39] it may not even be your need as read in
[1:33:41] the text but you said i've got needs
[1:33:45] if i can touch the hem of his garment i
[1:33:46] shall be made whole
[1:33:48] that's the kind of faith because you
[1:33:49] know
[1:33:50] he's present
[1:33:54] notice this that daughter
[1:33:57] is dead somebody came and told him this
[1:33:59] that daughter's dead
[1:34:01] why trouble is thou the master
[1:34:03] any further
[1:34:05] now so far as humanly speaking
[1:34:08] this person is thinking
[1:34:10] why bother anymore i mean just just just
[1:34:12] let him alone it's the situation's over
[1:34:14] with
[1:34:18] oh my oh i could get it on the shouting
[1:34:20] right now in verse 36
[1:34:22] but as soon as jesus heard the word that
[1:34:24] was spoken
[1:34:26] he said to the ruler of the synagogue
[1:34:29] be not afraid only
[1:34:33] belief
[1:34:36] so not only is jairus walking here with
[1:34:40] faith
[1:34:42] if i can get if he just come and lay his
[1:34:44] hands on my daughter she shall be whole
[1:34:48] if i can just get jesus to my house
[1:34:51] if i can just get jesus to my life if i
[1:34:54] can just get jesus to my need
[1:34:57] and then somebody comes along the way
[1:35:00] and said
[1:35:01] hey it's too late
[1:35:03] don't bother him anymore but here's a
[1:35:05] powerful thing
[1:35:07] the word heard it
[1:35:11] the word heard it the bible sent the
[1:35:13] eyes of the lord run to and fro
[1:35:15] throughout the earth doing what showing
[1:35:17] himself strong in behalf of his children
[1:35:23] the word has heard it
[1:35:26] glory be to god hallelujah the word has
[1:35:29] heard it and the word is there to
[1:35:31] address that need can't you see how if
[1:35:34] they would have jesus would have just
[1:35:35] let that go maybe jairus's faith it was
[1:35:39] waning at that point but the word came
[1:35:41] to do what energized his faith and
[1:35:45] strengthen it
[1:35:48] glory aren't you glad that god comes and
[1:35:50] encourages us
[1:35:52] oh come on friends we get down in the
[1:35:54] journey we get weak in the journey
[1:35:57] oh we're pressing towards the mark of
[1:35:59] the high calling but sometimes we get a
[1:36:02] little weary we get a little weak we get
[1:36:04] a little down we can get frustrated but
[1:36:07] aren't you glad that the word oh
[1:36:10] my the living word is present to address
[1:36:15] our need and say keep going come on

[1:36:24] i need that
[1:36:26] i needed jesus i need that
[1:36:29] hallelujah
[1:36:31] oh my in another place in luke say means
[1:36:34] the same thing when they had told him in
[1:36:36] luke 8 50 when jesus heard it he
[1:36:39] answered and said fear not
[1:36:41] believe only
[1:36:42] and she shall be made whole
[1:36:46] you know why
[1:36:47] when news like that come
[1:36:51] fear just standing right there waiting
[1:36:52] to enter
[1:36:55] fear is the result of doubt
[1:36:57] worry
[1:36:59] right
[1:37:04] let's take it up to
[1:37:06] brother brown that had silver tipped
[1:37:08] grizzly
[1:37:10] and bud was sitting there
[1:37:13] brother brown i don't know what caliber
[1:37:14] you remember what caliber it was
[1:37:16] i'm not good with guns i just like bows
[1:37:19] remember what caliber it was
[1:37:21] i normally know 22.
[1:37:23] but it sure was a caliber that got
[1:37:24] brother bud nervous
[1:37:27] right it's like my brother brother
[1:37:28] brandon went to africa and and and and
[1:37:30] the model that he was shooting with in
[1:37:32] africa even brother sidney jackson are
[1:37:34] you sure
[1:37:35] all right
[1:37:36] we're talking about shooting cape
[1:37:37] buffalo
[1:37:39] yeah
[1:37:40] friends you say brothers you brother sam
[1:37:42] you just try to spiritualize everything
[1:37:44] really
[1:37:45] really
[1:37:47] over and over i'm told in the message
[1:37:49] and i see it in the word
[1:37:51] that the word of god
[1:37:53] can defeat satan anywhere anytime
[1:37:57] anyplace
[1:37:58] i'm also told and led to believe and i
[1:38:01] am a product of it how many ever witness
[1:38:03] of this right here
[1:38:04] that when the weakest christians
[1:38:07] get on their knees
[1:38:10] hell begins to tremble
[1:38:15] you know what getting your knees on
[1:38:17] back up right here we're riding
[1:38:18] artillery fire what are they doing we're
[1:38:20] calling in some reinforcements from
[1:38:21] above to drop some daisy cutter bombs on
[1:38:24] them and other things oh that's what
[1:38:25] prayer is it's greater than an atomic
[1:38:28] bomb we're calling in reinforcements
[1:38:30] right there why because we ain't backing
[1:38:32] up oh it's thick firing that's going on
[1:38:35] but i need some reinforcement there are
[1:38:37] angels all around i need reinforcement
[1:38:42] what is that faith being persistent that
[1:38:46] we are going through and we're going
[1:38:48] through this way
[1:38:56] peter would like to step in
[1:38:58] it's just like when god
[1:39:00] when god does anything for you fear
[1:39:02] would like to step in
[1:39:05] is that right
[1:39:07] fear is right there to try to step in
[1:39:09] but let the good man of the house faith
[1:39:10] stand right there
[1:39:13] remember from the beginning of this
[1:39:15] service you didn't create that within
[1:39:18] you
[1:39:20] god put that there
[1:39:23] and there's a witness that there is a
[1:39:24] healing fountain for me
[1:39:26] there is a fountain that washes away
[1:39:28] every guilty sting
[1:39:32] so
[1:39:33] here's jairus coming
[1:39:35] and between the time
[1:39:37] he makes a decision
[1:39:39] and until they get back to the house
[1:39:42] all in between here
[1:39:44] this is part of the journey
[1:39:46] this is where faith itself
[1:39:48] will declare itself
[1:39:51] jairus didn't know all this was going to
[1:39:53] happen
[1:39:54] he didn't know he was going to get that
[1:39:55] kind of news
[1:39:56] but god knew about it
[1:39:59] god knew about it
[1:40:01] and even though the case looked too
[1:40:02] great
[1:40:03] it wasn't too great for god
[1:40:09] brother brahm takes a situation in the
[1:40:11] message life is the healer
[1:40:13] he talks about when he was standing
[1:40:14] there in africa
[1:40:16] and there was a young
[1:40:18] a young boy
[1:40:20] he said a little black boy that was
[1:40:21] cross-eyed
[1:40:23] and they were setting in
[1:40:25] those eyes are just pointed in i
[1:40:27] remember
[1:40:28] now it comes remember
[1:40:31] little sharon rose
[1:40:34] brother branham went to look in upon her
[1:40:36] when she had all them flies and stuff
[1:40:38] remember she's dying
[1:40:41] brother brown prayed and
[1:40:43] you know the story that happened but
[1:40:45] from that moment god went ahead and god
[1:40:48] took her on home little sharon as well
[1:40:50] as hope
[1:40:51] but brother branham could stand right
[1:40:53] there
[1:40:54] and when he would ask me ask the
[1:40:55] question
[1:40:57] now there are the things what he went
[1:40:59] through with that right there
[1:41:00] he said would that was ask brother brown
[1:41:02] talking you know kind of like with
[1:41:04] himself in front of the audience
[1:41:06] would i go through it again
[1:41:09] would i go through that heartache again
[1:41:11] losing his wife losing his little
[1:41:13] daughter
[1:41:15] he said it hurt he said but i would
[1:41:19] do it all again
[1:41:20] because he said from that moment
[1:41:23] there's not been one cross-side baby
[1:41:28] that's been able to come in that prayer
[1:41:30] line and its eyes not be straightened
[1:41:32] out
[1:41:34] you see what it is oh friends this is
[1:41:36] why when god permits a tester trial to
[1:41:38] come your way
[1:41:40] we can all let i hope you don't
[1:41:41] misunderstand me testing trout yes but
[1:41:44] listen god never meant for us to become
[1:41:46] recluse in a tester trial and pity me
[1:41:49] and pity me that's not actually
[1:41:52] receiving the benefit
[1:41:54] because sometimes it's not even a tester
[1:41:56] trial it's our own decisions that's put
[1:41:59] us in the corner we're at
[1:42:02] tests and trials molds you
[1:42:06] shape you
[1:42:08] and even bad choices and decisions of
[1:42:11] where we become isolated if we will
[1:42:13] allow god
[1:42:15] all things
[1:42:17] work together for the good
[1:42:20] to them who are the called according to
[1:42:21] his purpose we all could get down we all
[1:42:24] could have a pity party and no doubt we
[1:42:26] do sometimes in front of the mirror
[1:42:29] come on friends sometimes we all get a
[1:42:31] little bit down and why me and why this
[1:42:33] and why isn't this going and why isn't
[1:42:35] this and well every one of us in here
[1:42:43] but think about this brother branham was
[1:42:45] able from that moment
[1:42:48] his test
[1:42:50] and the trial
[1:42:51] it became a catalyst a channel
[1:42:54] for god to manifest through let me tell
[1:42:57] you something your test or your trial is
[1:43:00] not just about you
[1:43:02] it's about the body
[1:43:07] it's about the body
[1:43:09] god permit you to go through something
[1:43:10] so that you're able then for me to enter
[1:43:12] into prayer
[1:43:14] with a more compassion
[1:43:16] than what we've had before
[1:43:19] are you hearing me also to be an
[1:43:21] encouragement to somebody else and say
[1:43:23] hey hey brother hey sister
[1:43:26] god's faithful i'm a witness of that
[1:43:29] he's seeing you through you may not feel
[1:43:30] like it see you're able to enter right
[1:43:32] in and to and to talk to him
[1:43:36] are you hearing me i don't know how many
[1:43:38] times i'll refer when somebody comes
[1:43:40] talk to me about something or like that
[1:43:41] if it's something you know that's not a
[1:43:43] private matter you see something that's
[1:43:44] going on like that and i can pull it out
[1:43:46] and say hey you know it's something
[1:43:47] that's you know wide open and known you
[1:43:49] know this person went through that with
[1:43:50] a job or this or that my goodness i can
[1:43:52] refer them right back to hey you want
[1:43:53] you need to talk to brother so-and-so
[1:43:57] they christ in them too
[1:43:59] it ain't just christ in the pastor
[1:44:02] come on lean a bunch of nickelodeons
[1:44:09] here's that little boy i'm closing
[1:44:14] that little boy here he is standing
[1:44:15] there and he comes up they put him in
[1:44:17] the line brother brown sees everything
[1:44:19] about his home and his you know
[1:44:21] everything where the father and mother
[1:44:23] and things raised in the christian home
[1:44:24] born in a christian place but bran said
[1:44:26] i look back at that little boy
[1:44:28] after standing in that vision looks back
[1:44:29] and he says i see
[1:44:30] his eyes are as straight as
[1:44:33] he said then i could say anybody sees
[1:44:35] you don't have to pray for him his
[1:44:37] little faith has made him
[1:44:39] made him whole pass him on through
[1:44:42] and about that time
[1:44:43] brother braham said he was a doctor that
[1:44:45] came running up on the stage
[1:44:47] and that doctor was trying to get to
[1:44:48] brother branham
[1:44:50] and brother bosworth holding him back he
[1:44:51] said hey wait a minute i've got a
[1:44:52] question i got a question and that
[1:44:54] doctor begins to talk to brother bram
[1:44:55] and said now what kind of mental
[1:44:57] telepathy and things like that that you
[1:44:58] were doing and brother brown turns
[1:45:00] around and says you're a doctor you know
[1:45:02] brother go through the whole thing and
[1:45:03] they send you to doctor school if if if
[1:45:05] mental telepathy will do that for people
[1:45:07] then why aren't you all why aren't they
[1:45:09] teaching you that in school
[1:45:13] i'm telling you a greater than solomon
[1:45:14] was standing there
[1:45:18] hallelujah and all of a sudden then that
[1:45:20] man he said you know that that doctor
[1:45:22] begins to talk to him and things like
[1:45:24] that he says look he said i'm the one
[1:45:26] who put him in the line
[1:45:29] he said
[1:45:30] but he says now notice he said he was
[1:45:33] standing there i saw his eyes i'm the
[1:45:35] one who put him in the line his eyes
[1:45:37] were crossed he said what happened
[1:45:41] between there
[1:45:42] and here what happened
[1:45:45] here's a simple answer god is standing
[1:45:48] here
[1:45:50] what happened between there and here god
[1:45:57] what happened between where you were at
[1:45:59] in need of your healing and the healing
[1:46:01] has come what happened in between god
[1:46:05] what happened here you showed up meeting
[1:46:08] the baptism of the holy ghost what
[1:46:10] happened between here here and there god
[1:46:14] amen
[1:46:18] it's a paradox i put them in cross and
[1:46:21] now they're no longer crossed who
[1:46:23] strained them out
[1:46:24] god straightened them out
[1:46:28] that doctor took the microphone he says
[1:46:30] then from this very moment he said i
[1:46:33] give my life to jesus christ and i make
[1:46:36] up my mind he said i'm going to serve
[1:46:39] the lord
[1:46:40] brother branham went on to tell how that
[1:46:42] doctor became a missionary let go of his
[1:46:44] practice and became a missionary
[1:46:46] he was affected
[1:46:48] between here and there
[1:46:51] sometimes the between here and there
[1:46:53] it's not real far
[1:46:55] it's from here to here
[1:47:00] hallelujah
[1:47:02] glory be to god so jairus what happened
[1:47:05] from between here and there

[1:47:19] little woman that was in need of a meal
[1:47:21] and oil what happened between here and
[1:47:24] there god showed up
[1:47:28] some morning between six and nine what
[1:47:30] happened between here and there god
[1:47:32] shows up
[1:47:38] it's the in between we get too focused
[1:47:40] on

[1:47:50] belongs to me
[1:47:51] god is moving in my life and in my heart
[1:47:54] it belongs to me
[1:48:00] let's pray heavenly father
[1:48:05] lord jesus
[1:48:08] between here and there
[1:48:12] lord we everyone in this building
[1:48:15] can identify with little gyrus
[1:48:19] that god from the moment
[1:48:22] that moment where the decision is made
[1:48:24] and gyrus moves
[1:48:27] from that place oh it's faith
[1:48:29] but oh god how we can see this morning
[1:48:33] that you
[1:48:36] encouraged jairus
[1:48:38] as he was in pursuit of his need
[1:48:44] lord it shows every one of us
[1:48:46] myself lord as a pastor
[1:48:49] this congregation
[1:48:51] and no matter lord where any life
[1:48:54] is at in their journey maybe they've
[1:48:57] just started on their journey
[1:48:59] lord we know that there's not a set time
[1:49:01] and nor is there really then as your
[1:49:04] prophet would say a set pattern
[1:49:06] yet there is lord the pattern of your
[1:49:08] word but
[1:49:09] we recognize lord jesus
[1:49:12] oh god
[1:49:14] it's the between here and there
[1:49:19] and how the lord
[1:49:22] we need encouragement lord
[1:49:25] we come to the house of god
[1:49:28] there's a purpose there's a reason
[1:49:31] lord if it's just something that is a
[1:49:33] carnal reason and it remains that way
[1:49:36] it's only a matter of time
[1:49:40] it's only a matter of time
[1:49:43] but lord i've stood lord not only to
[1:49:45] witness right here i've witnessed lord
[1:49:47] when i've stood in meetings
[1:49:50] i've stood lord in youth retreats youth
[1:49:52] camps
[1:49:53] i've had young people lord that's come
[1:49:57] and they were able to stand there and
[1:49:59] say brother samuel
[1:50:01] i came here for the wrong purpose
[1:50:04] but i'm standing here tonight
[1:50:09] i'm standing here tonight to openly
[1:50:11] acknowledge that
[1:50:13] but i want to meet jesus
[1:50:16] oh lord god
[1:50:18] you lord god are the one who could come
[1:50:21] and you're here
[1:50:23] to change
[1:50:25] purposes
[1:50:28] to give purpose and reason lord
[1:50:31] for our gathering give purpose and
[1:50:33] reason for that life
[1:50:36] being lived because we only pass this
[1:50:39] way once
[1:50:42] you are only obligated lord by your word
[1:50:46] to give us
[1:50:47] one opportunity
[1:50:50] how many times lord god
[1:50:52] you've given us opportunity after
[1:50:54] opportunity
[1:50:55] lord i pray this morning god
[1:50:59] may lord god hearts
[1:51:02] just being honest in your presence
[1:51:05] saying lord god i i want to take that
[1:51:08] opportunity may they also realize the
[1:51:11] lord
[1:51:11] hearts not only here that
[1:51:13] lord that
[1:51:15] never surrendered their lives and lord i
[1:51:17] i'm talking more than just repentance
[1:51:19] that's a first step you can't bypass
[1:51:21] that but i'm talking about really where
[1:51:23] they surrender their lives
[1:51:25] and they really get desperate to meet
[1:51:28] you
[1:51:29] where they get tired of
[1:51:31] of just going about and trying to live
[1:51:33] and
[1:51:34] on their own as far as to just make it
[1:51:37] where they say lord i want you to be the
[1:51:39] lord of my life
[1:51:41] instead of me trying to guide my life
[1:51:43] and figure this out and figure that out
[1:51:46] i'm tired of wasting time
[1:51:49] i want my life to be birthed
[1:51:53] from time into eternity to where the
[1:51:55] eternal god would come down
[1:51:58] and there would become a new creation on
[1:52:00] the
[1:52:00] inside remember you could never have
[1:52:02] that longing
[1:52:04] without first there being a creator to
[1:52:07] create that desire within you
[1:52:12] why don't you just let go
[1:52:14] and let him
[1:52:15] quench that thirst in your life
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:22] right here this morning
[1:52:24] between here and there
[1:52:27] between here and there
[1:52:31] for your healing
[1:52:33] for deliverance between here and there
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:38] i'll tell you i take this as a word of
[1:52:40] encouragement that the word knows
[1:52:42] exactly your need in your situation
[1:52:46] and the same god that has already
[1:52:48] brought you to that place where there is
[1:52:50] a decision that was made
[1:52:52] faith was moving that if i can just get
[1:52:55] to jesus
[1:52:56] it's settled
[1:52:58] [Music]
[1:53:00] let me just share a little something
[1:53:02] with you
[1:53:04] brother braham says many times
[1:53:06] that's what people think
[1:53:08] and they end up very disappointed
[1:53:12] because when we get to jesus
[1:53:14] there's also a battle right there as
[1:53:16] well
[1:53:19] not jesus but there's a battle going on
[1:53:22] the sarah phoenician woman
[1:53:24] when she came
[1:53:26] thou son of david
[1:53:29] and he turned to her and said woman
[1:53:32] it's not fit to take the bread and cast
[1:53:35] it unto dogs
[1:53:38] but that faith was so great
[1:53:41] it overcame every hindrance
[1:53:46] and it lowered itself it became humble
[1:53:49] in the presence of the word surely lord

[1:54:55] brother brandon brother brown would talk
[1:54:56] about brother bosworth he had such a
[1:54:59] fondness and the dearness of brother
[1:55:00] bosworth
[1:55:01] you know one of the things that brother
[1:55:02] bosworth would say
[1:55:04] to the people of god
[1:55:07] that when god has made the promise and
[1:55:09] god has confirmed that to you he said
[1:55:12] between the time
[1:55:13] of when that has taken place and the
[1:55:15] manifestation he said fill your life
[1:55:19] with god
