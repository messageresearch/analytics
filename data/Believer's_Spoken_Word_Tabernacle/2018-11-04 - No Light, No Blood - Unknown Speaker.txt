then it comes closer closer it's him drawing us shielding and he moves inside and he don't stop drawing he keeps on drawing and he keeps ministering to us and one of these days as we sung here just moments ago like Enoch that type will be fulfilled one of these days you might be getting up and getting ready for work it might have been one of those morning's where you push the snooze button twice seem like you just didn't get the rest that you needed last night the chamomile tea didn't work for you but that's the morning that there was a host a caravan that's visiting us on that day I believe that's I believe that's as believers that we live in that kind of an expectation that's what the that's what the message that God has sent to us the angel of the Lord coming to us in this hour has brought to us a living expectation amen don't you love him this morning Amen how many just enjoyed the word of the Lord last night or the presence of the Lord is just so so precious so sweet I just love him don't you Amen we just says brother jewel comes I'm just so thankful brother jewel it was just a good friend and I'm glad that he was able to be able to be here with us and you know I was just praying this morning and you know where the jewel was supposed to be here in May and then you know the the the passing there of brother John Keith had taken place and brother Joe had to cancel there and at the end of May but you know what God knew God knew how everything has been so divinely arranged by him even to where of this weekend and how God is so set that I believe that with all my heart and I believe there's such a witness that the Holy Spirit has set right before us what a continuity that how that God has taken vessels and it's almost been like the same person has preached for weeks because in actuality the same person has been it's the preacher himself and that that's who we want here I'm so glad that he's mindful of our needs aren't you I'm glad about that we just let's just move in this morning enter in draw on the gift of God and you watch God it'll come right down to what your need is and I believe we're here this morning not because that we are not needy we're here because we are needy we are here in defiance of the spirit of this age that says I have need of nothing we send here and say Lord I need more of you I need more of you now what if he'd come by your way and say I need you worship I need your praise Lord I'm feeling pretty good my needs are met I know but would you just pull because there's a lot more needs here that need to be met would you make yourself available this morning that God can just pass by this way let's just yield ourselves to the Lord right brother Jule to come I want to remind you next Sunday Lord willing we have a fellowship dinner that was posted on the calendar there after that after the service just wanted to make you aware of that but let's sing that song I know we sang it before we're together again that

do you you know we all come together bring a little liquor find anything you know revival everybody you know fine you know you say bad I said when we go to church we go to church to be a blessing for somebody else somebody else sitting beside you might not be lifted up being you get to praising God they say you know if I break all over the church and they say we thank God just this morning appreciate but Samuel forgiveness opportunity to be here and share the word Lord with you just weekend we trust God that we can say something to really be a blessing I don't think I'm trying to sing a song but I won't go right to the word Lord we'd be traveling back this evening so keep it simple I'm gonna read from two places in the scripture this this morning hungry from the book of Hebrews the tempter starting at verse 25 and 2228 never read at first John not st. John first John 1 verse 5 through 8 Hebrews the temperature Kaptur and I'm gonna restart it verse 25 to 28 and here is like this not forsaken to somehow self together as a matter of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching for it wishes if we sin willfully after we had received a knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for the looking for of the judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the amateur he that despises Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses first John first John first chapter Henry five through eight it says since then is the message which we have heard of him and declared unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sins if we say that we have no sin saying we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us that's birth agressors father help me one more time to hear my body my spirit my soul to you Oh father help me to get myself out of the way Lord if the peoples can hear from you Lord father God I give you all my scrip for this service use my body for your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this morning hello to God is that hungry God is light and in him there is no darkness at all halli I like to wear this studying you saying you know that what we've seen endless long walk in the light as he is in the light Holly won't let her do drops of mercy and bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus is the light of the world hundred I took this scripture this morning him and I begin to talk I want to tell him when to speak on a little subdued I kind of just started a few weeks ago hello when I deal with a subject no light no blood no light no blood how do you weigh another where we begin to realize you you say brother do what you're trying to say I'm trying to say if you ain't in the light there's no blood or coma for you holidays nothing they play because it takes light to bring life so that I begin to look here I begin to realize here and I'm gonna talk a little bit on that light right here because with God when God created it in God the Bible say the earth would that the Bible say the earth will win void and darkness was upon the face at a deeper Derb how do we do we realize how old is Satan why you think they're going to death saying it had been keep down to the earth under God because you realize you just don't just never come from God this God God just came from the devil hello in every garden made of Earth in the earth we would have born with void and for me is a way that was seizing her but none was grow be called darkness had paralyzed that seat honey but God had a purpose in his mind helooo Godhead he had a purpose in his mind so God says having me to break the powers of Satan how do Satan no doubt he thought he had this herb under his Dominion ship Holly but God said what these words let there be light honey the power dawned is no longer hold back because could hold it any longer when God said let there be light the power Gardner would broke under garden when he said let it be like Holland like Hitler the earth begin to give birth to ever see that was in your defeat redistricting up holida Barney like every day begin to come alive because is light and in him there's no darkness at all so God spoke words I learned that light hit that light hit the earth right there and there come a manifestation of the power God and I begin to realize you then God did we realize you that God took you here and he for man I didn't think God put man in his own image in God that man that God put in his image that man was a man Adam was a son of God and he also and it was the light that was in God with dwelling in Adam there was no sin at all in her I don't walk in the light and they Adam was woken in delay he was a son of God he walked in the life there was no power talking to him at all I begin to think of new things when I was looking at this here I'd say oh god I said it was such a perfect fellowship with God hallelu how did the father lights come down and gave birth to a son of light how do you know her here go out of here you know what he saying that word that was no saying that was not there was no worries that was no signals now it on Sarah Holly he was just a son of the life how did that dwelleth God breathing out and light holiday the word did not begin to look here but we realize here and I went that night so Satan only he could do Holly we could not Satan is not a creator he is a perversion ally he got at him and every member that was no way for Satan to get there no way Shana had no power over anywhere it was it was impossible because God had divided the light from the darkness [Music] so daughters had no power and only way to Satan you get to Adam he could not come in he could not come he could not come in and pull him out Adam had to walk out hey give it to the devil have no way for him to get in hadn't walked up behind the word Halloran walked in the door there that's how to deal with it but if he wouldn't there was no way for doctor you cannot break you cannot put out light with darkness you can do this I was in those little places filled with you must buzz a few years ago don't know if you've been there called Ruby Falls and it carried me down we got in this big okay buddy go down an elevator I don't know maybe 40 or 50 of feet deep in the earth or whatever have four it was we got down in that deep that deep down in there and that elevator went down there and the man cut the light off you talking about darkness there was a kind of darkness you couldn't even see your hand flash I said lord I said if I would have had to find my way out of that it would have been impossible Holly it was Sodor you can see nothing hallelujah but like the problem say there was a man they could turn on the light how do you say he to click the light I don't know I don't see how powerful that door in this world it had a spell but we God cut the light on Halloween the minute turn the light off the power daughters were broke Hollywood God candle idol not power darkness is broke we begin to look at these things right here and I begin to look here so down how I'm dealing with this thing for a few minutes ago in in a wetland I'm an inspiration preacher so I had to catch a man of God you know so you had to bear with me forgive me I got no up here to look important but here we are it's God but it was it was so everyone here go out of here here go here he will head on the perfect fellowship there was no death there was no sorrow everything was a unity the animal was in unity everybody had perfect fellowship holiday God broke the seals anatomy took out his wife which was the mission Adam revealed how loose she was his revelation Halloween underwear - anyone show even perfect harmony take a walk down in the cool of the day and God to speak to Adam lip their father Adam had perfect fellowship he was in the life to underpin his back hello him and God could help fellowship with each other and all of a sudden he was Satan king and broke the union between the man and the woman broke the union between the fellowship they had with God by telling a lie about a slight you said what Allah Allah is the fruit of darkness so it was same came in and slipped over he slipped in a line and he told Eve he said Evy says he that way say God God there's no in the day you eat uh you will surely die do I begin to talk they don't talk to eat and she begin to go right he took the Lord out of it by the way the Bible said the Lord God say it's safe to say that he didn't say God's a highly-regarded Evan old he got no problem with you believe it in God how do you say well I believe in God have in the world got their testimony but would you say I believe that that God is my Lord and Savior she's cut that would a saint have a problem so we begin to realize it so when Ana was saying come in he breathed the breath that darkness begin that don't fail hit to her ha let me go ahead and walk out to st. Holly when he walked out to Satan right here hi Lou Adams separating himself highly from God right there his body becomes subject to death so now Adam go had to learn how to die how do we go he never knew what there was so he didn't know he didn't know what there for so he had to learn how to die Holly show you remember her Holly wouldn't when Adam and Eve fell Holly what did they do they they hid himself in the presence of God that same boy Adam fellowship with that same boy - Adam had Camellia where Holly now he's hiding from the very day that created him he hide from the voice of God Halima we God called his name being a sheep regarde my sheep know my voice how he will he never was ago he was machine all the time when he called his name Hannah I heard your voice Holly I heard your voice and I was afraid so for the first time Adam spoke something out of his mouth that God had never spoken never came from God the words for how do you eat and God never spoke the word for how do you Adam is speaking here out of his mouth he was portrayed by his speech I have fell from grace I'm afraid now I feel further highly-paid how lucina's come now because of this prayer right we all got a better this than enough flood but God did not give us a spirit of her he gave us power at peace in a sound mind oh god here he was he fell in he fell down him now he began to he begin to have to had to learn

separate himself it took blood it took blood to cover himself so here to cover himself by blood hallelujah near the leader and he left out of the presence of God he had to be hell scared and he had to be in blood had to be dripping because god when I see that blood how do you Adam I can hear your voice through the blood holla but then we begin to realize how much you don't know sir when Adam never Hollywood that blood that was shed how that beast that was how did God had to drive out of the garden - either because if Adam would have stayed in the garden either every time he wouldn't cover the Tree of Life and would have lived up the day never tell he was saying where to become eternal honey but God was not go give saying eternal a he separated it from the flaming sword er don't you come

hallelu another word and I will let you know right now Jesus is the light of the world hallelujah and their way if he's the light then we gotta walk in the light we had to walk in the world we go he is a revelation of the crisis of mystery of God revealed it always take light to get you out of darkness hello Jenny why Joshua double the Ephesian judge would type Joshua how you type the book of

here oh praise God I'm just preaching this let me preach haliinen her so how do I show here he was Jesus come on the scene and he's testifying I am the light of the world I am the light of the world in me is no darkness at all we just say he did help darkness what about his body good question he was a man about a man that was thirty years old he looked like he was 50 I told her I was I was out there while back like I said how was that a place a while back in and the waitress come up to me and says gave my wife a menu to order and did she looks at me but brother Brown she said do you need a senior minute I had attitude you know action person did you ask me I let me ask you to ask me do I need a senior mentor so Jesus what happened to his body Jesus could God was so holy he was so pure that nothing nothing to touch his wholeness even a priestess before they enter image behind the veil they had to step down and go through all the second I had to wash their hands and their feet bigger when they walk be dependent of God they got to be clean oh if somebody drop dead Paul I'll even they're holding this man we're gonna never be able to fellowship with God that way so God made a way so we could touch him and fellowship in the garden eat he cursed the earth and the reason he cursed her here to make him my body highly they can feel your pain he had to make it my body they can feel you'll see he had to make it my body taking that day when you got a headache and you don't know what to do he's not gonna make a body I gotta make me a body they can feel he was Nazi he became sad for you it was not insane it was your sins here in me Redemption we need a Redemption hello so that darkness in his body could cause him the age so you look at him he not a man over 50 and he's saying before Abraham I am a doctor man this is don't even make sense hello where but see the point of it was they were looking at the veil holiday was not looking at the Shekinah glory behind the veil holiday was not looking at that light that was in here but Jesus began to testify I am the light Holly in me there's no darkness at all that what Jesus couldn't go to a further service Tina couldn't even go to a further service be going every time he walked in front and down that light would bring it back to life I lose that power that was in him but done that earth that laying there dead he hadn't seen it it will quicken it you remember the story says here when malaises died and he he was dead and Ben bird for about four days Jesus had got already got a text message it was already on Facebook at that time your best friend is dead jeez you need to come and see where and already Jesus kept going like he didn't pay no attention you know he didn't he he just like he didn't know what to say lives down today and after about four days he showed up he had a reason for doing it just because the Jews at that time they believed that the spirit hung around the body for three days if Gina would have read Andrade lines it up in the third day they would say well his career was to run so they whent held to their tradition but he waited he broke their tradition and he showed up on the fourth day just measured this method is not based on tradition and based on Revelation not as man is going to the tune Eliza's his flesh beginning to get like any man started weeping but don't tell you what he did he will we petite so not to come out too old God if you would have been here if you were too bitter my brother neither had went ahead died Jesus lay here raised she said we know here raised in the general resurrection Jesus looked at us are you this brother you could suck what you say I am I am the resurrection and the life show me what you later may know what gift of the power darkness had took him he carried him in the grave and his body is staking edges guy I love Jesus the light goes to the tomb here's a roll it back boys you rolled a stone but I'll do that same man that was weeping that same man that had compassion he was rolling this to man and stay crushed complain what he was and all of a sudden Jesus say honey I call my sheep my name because if he wouldn't have called in my name it would have been a general resurrection and he creams scooped up his shoulder he looked into the region of daughter and he cried Landru let there be light be heard and where he started when the word call you we live in darkness but the words are like a bee like oh god help us here how does show me begin realizing how probably is Jesus the light of the world but he testified I am the light of the world I am him except you believe I'm he you dye your seeds he knew so but the point of it is it's time to make known to the world time to make known to his followers who he is Halloween it was so he hadn't made that know yet and he's this great light that was in him that light that was in that earthly body that earthly body had no dominion over that light that light had dominion over his body how do you said brother what you trying to say because he was able to make his body come subject to every word of God so darkness had no power of it even though he feel pain even though he feels sorrow and only that but he had no power he made his body pulled his subject in the word see what did you say he says time for me to let you know who I am I'm gonna let you know
