[30:15] Hallelujah he's all
[30:19] things all things to
[30:22] us you know God would take through all
[30:25] of those examples through the Old
[30:26] Testament and he would
[30:28] show that for every situation for every
[30:32] need every one of those Redemptive names
[30:35] God would make himself known that this
[30:39] situation I've got it in control and I'm
[30:43] the God of this situation yes sir I'm
[30:46] the god of your
[30:47] need I'm thankful for that because every
[30:51] one of those compound Redemptive
[30:54] names it's all God and all of that will
[30:58] was poured into
[30:59] Christ and now that we are in him and he
[31:04] is in us all that we have need of the
[31:07] Prophet said once you have received the
[31:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost all that you
[31:12] have need of including the Rapture is in
[31:16] you
[31:18] then so what we have need of he's our
[31:22] provider he is our peace he's our Banner
[31:26] he's our Shield aren't you glad for that
[31:30] aren't you glad that he's all things
[31:32] Amen to us as a Believer amen we just
[31:35] want to say uh this morning that
[31:38] we are so thankful uh I know different
[31:42] ones were able to be there to yesterday
[31:44] others of you were not able uh you know
[31:48] but I thank you for praying uh for us
[31:50] and for the family as we were different
[31:53] ones were gathered there yesterday for
[31:55] to see uh sister Linda and the the
[31:58] homegoing and the celebration amen for
[32:00] our sister and um you know that's that's
[32:04] one of those things that uh and brother
[32:06] Jerry as he was ministering at here and
[32:09] what we had even said on Thursday night
[32:11] we'll certainly miss her here but it's
[32:12] like Paul says we mourn but we don't
[32:14] mourn as
[32:16] others because we we've got an
[32:19] expectation amen we know that we're soon
[32:21] and very soon amen that we're going to
[32:23] be reunited once again and I you know
[32:27] when I was down there in um in
[32:30] Jeffersonville and we were there in the
[32:32] meetings and um I just got back to the
[32:34] office after the Sunday morning service
[32:36] and I walked in and I picked up my phone
[32:38] in between the services and I seen where
[32:40] she had
[32:41] passed and uh I just told my wife I said
[32:44] you know I said I thought about like
[32:46] brother brandham went beyond the curtain
[32:47] of time I said brother brandham when he
[32:50] went beyond the curtain of time I said
[32:52] he looked back now he he wasn't even in
[32:54] a a condition that sister Linda was in
[32:56] but it's still nonetheless was this body
[32:59] and he asked the Lord he said do I have
[33:01] to go back into that
[33:03] thing do I have to go back into that
[33:06] thing but it was for a purpose and so
[33:09] this Veil is we only here in this Veil
[33:12] for a temporary time but I'm glad
[33:15] there's already been a connection made
[33:16] to the other side aren't you and I think
[33:19] as the spirit of the Lord came by our
[33:20] way on Thursday night and this is this
[33:23] is a moment this is why we have the
[33:25] services that we have it's a Time of
[33:28] preparation it's a time to be ready it's
[33:30] a time to be very sure it's a time to
[33:33] move on in as the spirit of God is
[33:35] dealing with our hearts amen it's a
[33:38] moment when we when we think of that any
[33:41] the spirit of God desires to bring a
[33:43] real rest and a real peace a solidness
[33:46] in every heart in life to where you can
[33:47] know beyond the shadow of a doubt that
[33:50] I'm included in that Rapture in that
[33:53] Resurrection because when that happens
[33:55] in your life that's just not about for
[33:57] what's coming yet that's very important
[34:00] but that will affect the way you live
[34:03] right now because when you have that
[34:06] assurance that trumps everything going
[34:09] on in your life even when offenses come
[34:13] that's greater that's good that's what
[34:16] allows to put everything else back in
[34:18] line where it needs to be amen don't you
[34:21] love him I want to just share a little
[34:23] something here with you maybe musicians
[34:24] just hold on a second can you kick it
[34:26] over there for me I want to just share
[34:28] something here with you uh a scripture
[34:32] um and this is very familiar to us but I
[34:35] want these these scripture and this is
[34:38] even in regarding it says Nation shall
[34:41] rise against nation and Kingdom against
[34:43] Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be
[34:45] in divers mean many different places and
[34:49] famines and pestilence and fearful
[34:52] sights and Great Signs shall there be
[34:55] from heaven and we we understand of
[34:59] these of of this in this hour and time
[35:02] we can read it through many of the
[35:03] places of the gospel and you know I
[35:06] thought of it even as we were on our way
[35:08] here today they're already starting the
[35:10] preparation for people coming in here
[35:12] for this eclipse and there such
[35:15] preparation and my wife just made a
[35:16] simple comment when we were going by she
[35:19] said isn't it incredible because you
[35:21] have people at the end down here that
[35:22] they're setting up and they're going to
[35:24] be selling food you've got them blocked
[35:26] off in the Black River she said it and
[35:28] incredible people would make such
[35:29] preparation for an event like this
[35:31] instead of preparing for their
[35:34] soul because all of I thought that I
[35:37] said well maybe should have her come up
[35:39] and say it but but uh I thought that was
[35:43] I thought that was very good I'm sorry
[35:45] honey I didn't mean to embarrass you but
[35:46] I just said you know what I said that's
[35:48] exactly the truth you know you see
[35:50] people can become so enamored with
[35:52] things that's going on and we see
[35:54] everything that has taken place all
[35:56] around us we know we're not a pign a
[35:59] people that Paul said we're not ignorant
[36:01] of this time that we're living in we
[36:03] know the hour that we're living in
[36:05] because one of the greatest signs and
[36:07] the truest signs you could have all of
[36:08] this and it still not be a sign of the
[36:10] end time the sign of the end time is God
[36:13] would send a prophet and a prophet is a
[36:16] sign of judgment that's coming before
[36:19] mercy and we've already we've receive
[36:21] that and we're seeing these things come
[36:23] come about here I want to show you this
[36:25] picture here and uh this picture this is
[36:28] a path of the eclipse that that that
[36:31] line as it's coming down the one that
[36:33] comes from Washington down like this way
[36:36] right here when you look at this one
[36:38] right here this pathway right here
[36:40] that's
[36:41] 2017 this is right from our government
[36:43] website but then you find this part
[36:46] right here this is
[36:47] 2024 this is and this is where we are
[36:50] right over in here and I want you to
[36:51] notice this it's just a black mark
[36:54] across the
[36:55] nation ohow a black mark right across
[36:58] the nation sir and I want you to notice
[37:00] this here brother Bram makes a statement
[37:02] in choosing of a bride he said so I pray
[37:04] Lord in jesus' name let people shake
[37:07] themselves tonight flee from the Wrath
[37:09] that is to come for inad is rote over
[37:12] the doors and over the Nations a black
[37:14] check mark has come across it the spirit
[37:17] of God is grieved away from it and
[37:19] they're weighed in the balances and
[37:21] found wanting the Feast of
[37:23] Nebuchadnezzar has repeated again with
[37:27] drunken parties and half-dressed women
[37:29] calling themselves
[37:31] Christians I say we have
[37:33] arrived we have arrived yes sir and I
[37:37] you know I you you know me a lot you can
[37:39] go aad switch it off uh uh you know
[37:42] there's not a lot of things and I I just
[37:44] look at it I don't try to make a lot of
[37:45] things out of things I don't spend my
[37:47] time in that way uh just everybody has
[37:49] to do according to how they're LED of
[37:50] the Lord but I know if inspiration comes
[37:53] but I look at this right here and I
[37:54] think and when I see that I say God
[37:57] thank you for for your mercy because we
[37:58] see judgment is all around us in this
[38:01] hour that's right and we see that you
[38:04] know brother Bram said that God is
[38:05] taking his people beyond the camp of
[38:07] just relying on human reasoning but he
[38:10] said Satan is also taking his people
[38:12] beyond the camp of human reasoning into
[38:16] Insanity we've been caught up into the
[38:18] supernatural they're being caught into
[38:20] insanity is that right and so I'm so
[38:23] thankful for the mind of Christ setting
[38:25] down Among Us I'm Greatful F in this
[38:28] hour we can look at this and we see
[38:30] these things passing by we see them
[38:31] coming by but I'm so grateful for the
[38:34] stability that God brings in a heart and
[38:36] a life that right now there's an anchor
[38:38] that I'm ready to go and I just say to
[38:40] you this morning that what kept
[38:42] pulsating in my heart even on Thursday
[38:43] night if you're not ready make ready to

[42:30] amen amen I'd like you to turn up in
[42:33] your Bibles to Hebrews chap 11 and we're
[42:36] we're we'll read the first six verses of
[42:40] this
[42:42] scripture uh I
[42:48] um I've come through some
[42:51] experience of some things over the
[42:56] past several years quite a few years it
[43:00] it it was something that uh I was faced
[43:04] with in my life that it uh uh it
[43:10] actually took place over a span of years
[43:13] that it just kept continuing and it was
[43:16] a a personal Battle of mine and uh I
[43:21] want to share that with you this
[43:26] morning
[43:30] has a
[43:32] testimony
[43:33] um I I I
[43:39] gave some testimony over different
[43:42] periods to my church at home in that but
[43:45] for a few moments before I do that I I
[43:48] just want to speak to you about
[43:51] faith so uh Hebrews 11 verse1 now Faith
[43:56] is the substance of things hoped for the
[43:59] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[44:02] the elders obtained a good report
[44:05] through faith we understand that the
[44:07] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[44:10] that things which are seen were not made
[44:12] of things which do appear by faith Abel
[44:17] offered unto God a more excellent
[44:19] sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained
[44:22] witness that he was righteous and God
[44:25] testifying of his gifts and by by it he
[44:28] being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch
[44:31] was translated that he should not see
[44:33] death and was not found because God had
[44:35] translated him for before his
[44:39] translation he had this testimony that
[44:41] he pleased God but without faith it is
[44:44] impossible to please him for he that
[44:47] cometh to God must believe that he is
[44:50] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[44:52] diligently seek Him amen you may be
[44:54] seated
[44:56] I
[44:58] I start out by saying this uh you know I
[45:02] uh I I moved down to Tennessee and the
[45:06] toward the end of
[45:08] 1998 and started to Pastor the church
[45:12] down there in Dixon
[45:14] Tennessee and uh you know at the time I
[45:19] I really uh uh you know I had a lot of
[45:23] confidence but only in the fact that I I
[45:26] knew God had sent me but I I did feel
[45:31] inadequate in my in my understanding of
[45:36] some things and in my knowledge of
[45:39] things and uh Faith was actually
[45:43] something that uh when it came to
[45:46] certain aspects that I I felt a little
[45:51] inadequate but you know I've been there
[45:54] 25 years and uh you know I had
[45:57] ministered for years before that and had
[46:00] had been here and things but I'll tell
[46:02] you when you got to preach every service
[46:04] service in service out to the same
[46:06] church the same people you know so it
[46:09] isn't like you know evangelizing you
[46:11] might realize this but evangelizing you
[46:14] can actually take a uh they call it a
[46:16] little script bag of of sermons brother
[46:20] brandham did it and and and you can go
[46:23] preach that sermon at this church and
[46:24] then go preach that sermon at this
[46:26] church and then go preach it at that
[46:28] church you know and and of course God
[46:30] will come down the spirit and he'll
[46:32] bring in things you to say here that you
[46:34] didn't say there and and somewhere else
[46:37] that because he tailor it to the people
[46:39] in that but it's it's just how God works
[46:41] through evangelism that but when you're
[46:44] a pastor you know you can't get up and
[46:45] just preach the same set of three or
[46:48] four message five messages over and over
[46:51] and over you know and and you you've got
[46:53] to uh be able to follow the leaders ship
[46:57] of the Lord because you know you're
[46:59] feeding the people and the people have
[47:01] got to grow and they got to mature and
[47:03] and in in their in their walk with the
[47:06] Lord in their understanding of the Lord
[47:08] because it's not that we want to get
[47:09] real smart or be able to be real
[47:12] intellectual excuse me a moment brother
[47:14] Alex is so good to see you you
[47:19] know you know I I enjoy seeing all of
[47:22] you but for many years I used to come up
[47:24] here and when I'd come up I'd see
[47:26] brother Alex and I haven't seen him in
[47:27] so long and and he he's a real good uh
[47:30] dear friend to me so I really love that
[47:34] that brother I got to when I really got
[47:36] to know him and uh we went to a men's uh
[47:39] meetings down in uh Tennessee and and
[47:42] spent some time together and and man he
[47:45] just looked after me and took care of me
[47:46] and everything and it was you know and
[47:49] and I I really got to kind of really
[47:52] spend more time with him and got to know
[47:53] him he's a precious brother he's a dear
[47:55] brother amen and he loves loves The Lord
[47:58] Oh my he he really loves the Lord and he
[48:00] believes with all his
[48:02] heart um you know we and so you know as
[48:07] a pastor the people have got to grow and
[48:10] uh not just in to be intellectual but
[48:13] you got to grow an understanding because
[48:15] as you grow an understanding in
[48:16] Revelation it's really about knowing
[48:19] more about Jesus Christ and actually him
[48:23] becoming more and more a part in your
[48:27] life of what he wants to be and and and
[48:30] that because he he wants to uh that
[48:33] that's one of the things that that God
[48:35] wanted to do you know was actually be
[48:38] magnified in his people that's right and
[48:41] and and and that so uh but so anyway I I
[48:46] I feel like uh that uh I'm not
[48:49] proclaiming that I know everything and
[48:52] all and and I still believe I've got
[48:54] things to learn but I just want to share
[48:56] with you you what I have
[48:58] learned and uh I I I know this that you
[49:02] know the prophet said about faith he
[49:04] said you know like our body is
[49:06] controlled by five senses and some of
[49:08] these things I'm going to say you're
[49:09] familiar with but I'm just going to let
[49:11] the Lord lead me to tie all this in
[49:13] together our body you know is actually
[49:16] controlled by five senses in this world
[49:18] see taste feel uh smell and here and and
[49:23] but now but none of those senses
[49:26] actually declare
[49:28] faith and you know faith brother bam
[49:31] said is a six sense you know and and and
[49:35] I'm going to tell you something science
[49:38] cannot explain Faith science can explain
[49:43] uh the other five senses uh you know of
[49:45] the body and things like that and and
[49:47] and there's things they can explain
[49:49] about the you know the physical makeup
[49:51] and and and of your body and your organs
[49:54] and your brain and all these things and
[49:57] that but they cannot scientifically
[50:00] explain
[50:02] faith and and you know and churches
[50:05] everywhere religions everywhere uh you
[50:08] know uh all the denominations and
[50:10] everything they they they they always
[50:13] want to Proclaim Faith to the people and
[50:16] and and and they bring it in their uh
[50:20] actually many times intellectual
[50:22] conception of what it is and but uh
[50:26] faith is is more than those five senses
[50:29] faith is actually a direct positive
[50:32] that's right you know you can uh realize
[50:36] this that they've actually got medical
[50:38] terms for things that people can
[50:40] actually experience the actual pain of
[50:44] having a heart attack uh they can
[50:47] experience it in their body I've done it
[50:49] myself Pain's going down you know you
[50:51] wake up Pain's shooting down your left
[50:53] arm pains in your chest you go in and
[50:55] everything else they check you out find
[50:57] there's no blockage you're not having a
[50:58] heart
[50:59] attack you know and one of the words
[51:01] they have for many of these things and
[51:03] it works within the body and in the
[51:04] brain and all these the the one term
[51:06] they use is pseudo which uh is it's
[51:11] actually something that mimics it but
[51:13] you actually really feel it you're
[51:16] experiencing it you can feel it you you
[51:18] are experiencing that but it's not
[51:22] real that's good but Faith you can't
[51:27] feel Faith is not
[51:32] excitement you can't feel Faith No but
[51:36] faith is more real than anything that
[51:40] you can contact in your five senses of
[51:42] this body it's a direct
[51:47] positive now Faith is not uh something
[51:51] where you work up to it brother brand
[51:54] said he said you cannot work up Faith
[51:56] amen you you can't work it up by
[51:59] repeating things you can't say well I'm
[52:01] just going to take this frame of mind
[52:03] and I'm I'm going to think this
[52:05] way that's not
[52:08] Faith you know uh maybe the and I know
[52:12] some of these things you can try to
[52:13] point to me to other quotes and things
[52:15] but uh that uh maybe backs what you
[52:18] believe faith is but I'm telling you
[52:21] I've studied through the message I'll
[52:22] use your quotes and all the other ones I
[52:24] found too
[52:28] you know but I'm going to tell you just
[52:30] you say well uh and I know that brother
[52:33] Bram said the doctor says this and and
[52:34] you know but faith can call him a liar
[52:36] and all but this is what I'm saying a
[52:38] lot of people they use actually denial
[52:41] of things to to represent Faith denial
[52:44] is not
[52:47] faith if if the doctor says you've got
[52:51] high blood pressure you know and you say
[52:53] well I'm just not going to accept that
[52:58] you know I I'm going to believe I don't
[53:00] have it I'm just not going to accept
[53:02] that and you go home and every time you
[53:04] check your blood pressure it's high I'm
[53:06] telling you you probably should take
[53:08] some medication before you have a
[53:10] stroke that's
[53:13] right remember this here's a direct
[53:15] quote too brother Venom said God gave
[53:19] doctors and medical science the the
[53:22] knowledge they have to actually help
[53:25] poor suffering Humanity
[53:27] so you're not going to hear me get up
[53:28] here and and tell you don't take an
[53:30] aspirin don't take a Tylenol don't take
[53:33] medication don't go to the doctor
[53:35] because I don't believe that and the
[53:37] prophet didn't teach that that's right
[53:39] that's right that's that's right but I'm
[53:43] also going to tell you don't just rely
[53:46] on medical science you don't have to
[53:49] because we have Divine Healing right
[53:52] that's right the Lord that's right
[53:56] that's right
[53:57] remember when uh sister Bram sister mey
[54:03] had uh that I believe cyst that had come
[54:06] up in that and and and because of and we
[54:09] I don't want to get into all that but
[54:11] you know why she ended up with it was a
[54:12] correction from the Lord and all that
[54:14] but brother Brandon remember what he
[54:15] told her he said you go to the doctor
[54:18] and let the doctor do the test and tell
[54:21] you it's not there that's right he
[54:23] didn't tell her you just go out and
[54:24] don't claim that never told
[54:27] UPS shows up at the door with a package
[54:29] of assist you just saying I ain't
[54:31] accepting that package now don't get me
[54:33] wrong friends but I'm telling you there
[54:35] there are people that approach things
[54:37] with a an
[54:39] intellectual way of faith and that does
[54:42] not move on the word of
[54:45] God that's right that's so good faith is
[54:48] not positive
[54:51] thinking
[54:52] right brother vom say he actually says
[54:55] you want another quote he says it isn't
[54:58] I believe it I think it he says it's I
[55:02] know
[55:04] it right so it it's not and listen I
[55:09] uh uh you know I I spent five years in
[55:12] the service and and one of the you know
[55:14] and it did you know there was a lot of
[55:17] positive things that that came out of my
[55:19] time uh that I believe the Lord used
[55:22] that to work things within me and things
[55:25] molding and developing certain things in
[55:27] that but you know one of the things you
[55:29] know they they teach you I I believe in
[55:31] every branch of the military and that is
[55:34] is actually how to try to overcome
[55:36] things
[55:37] mentally you know that when you you're
[55:40] faced with physical problems you know
[55:42] the first thing is your mental approach
[55:44] to it you know and and and they they
[55:47] will tell you don't think this way think
[55:50] this way you know but I'm telling you
[55:52] that's not how Faith works right amen am
[55:58] brother random says sometimes people
[56:00] come up before me and they're trying to
[56:03] work themselves up into faith and he
[56:05] says I'll notice people come here and
[56:07] some of times they're shaking themselves
[56:09] and saying Oh Glory to God oh glory to
[56:10] God oh glory to God I believe he says
[56:12] that's not Faith he said actually he
[56:15] says that interferes with
[56:18] faith good he says you cannot work
[56:21] yourself up into Faith to
[56:25] believe he actually says faith is not
[56:29] excitement that's right
[56:34] right now there are times and I've
[56:37] witnessed this where people have come to
[56:39] me for prayer and uh they they're
[56:43] getting ready to face an
[56:45] operation and they've come up to me and
[56:47] they say brother Jerry I am just so
[56:49] afraid of anesthesia I have read so much
[56:51] about it people getting going under
[56:53] anesthesia and them not being able to
[56:55] bring them back too and they end up
[56:56] dying and all that and so I don't want
[56:58] to have that surgery I don't want to go
[57:00] under anesthesia and I said well I'm
[57:02] telling you with your approach and the
[57:04] way you're thinking you're going to have
[57:05] to because what what the problem is
[57:08] you're coming up here and you're basing
[57:11] everything on your fear I don't want to
[57:13] do this because I'm afraid so God don't
[57:16] make me have that to have to happen fear
[57:20] is not a basis for
[57:25] faith and I'll tell you this it takes
[57:28] just as much Faith actually more faith
[57:31] to go through the operation than for God
[57:34] to come down and perform a miracle on
[57:38] you brother brandom actually was he
[57:41] there was a man came up before him in in
[57:44] a message 51 where he brother bram's giv
[57:46] a testimony and and the man comes up and
[57:48] brother Bram says you you have kidney
[57:50] problems and he says uh I I I see a
[57:54] doctor standing before you and and he's
[57:56] examining you and you're up for an
[58:01] operation and then I love this part he
[58:04] says but I I feel though you've made
[58:07] preparations for something
[58:09] else and he says you've just been saved
[58:13] too and converted recently because you
[58:17] got on the same suit of clothes you've
[58:19] got on that I've seen you on getting
[58:21] saved
[58:23] GL Hallelujah now you think wow that's
[58:26] great that's wonderful you know he's
[58:27] preparing for something else brother man
[58:29] said you're preparing you know for for
[58:33] the Lord you know a a difference of
[58:35] changed in your life is really what he's
[58:37] saying he says well don't you feel your
[58:39] fear your operation brother Jesus Christ
[58:42] the son of God has made a preparation
[58:44] for you with his blessings may he rest
[58:46] upon you don't fear it brother you're
[58:48] going to be all
[58:50] right now you know the prophet many
[58:53] times he would say you know you've got
[58:55] this and you got that you stand to your
[58:57] feet you no longer got to get off that
[58:59] cot and all this and he tells this
[59:00] brother don't fear just go ahead and
[59:02] have your
[59:05] operation yes
[59:08] sir now you say why are you bringing
[59:10] that out because brother benam what he
[59:13] had to deal with was the man actually
[59:15] reason he come up there is because he
[59:18] had
[59:19] fear so brother Brandon really didn't
[59:21] deal with the operation or or or it was
[59:24] actually kidneys that he had a kidney
[59:27] problem and and brother Brenham didn't
[59:29] actually really deal with that but what
[59:30] but what he dealt with was the the whole
[59:33] problem the man actually had was
[59:37] fear and I've I've seen so many people
[59:40] come for prayer for things and it's
[59:42] really all because they're
[59:45] afraid you know and just forgive me I
[59:49] don't mean to offend anybody but there's
[59:51] sometimes you've got to go through
[59:52] surgery there's sometimes you've got to
[59:53] go through treatment and and and and
[59:56] I'll get to those things in in a little
[59:58] while why the reason why that you have
[1:00:01] to do that sometimes that's
[1:00:05] good let me just drop this in you wanted
[1:00:08] to be Christlike right I'll get to that
[1:00:10] in a
[1:00:12] minute well this is the thing look he
[1:00:16] the the the scripture tells us he is the
[1:00:19] high priest of our
[1:00:21] profession and brother Venom says look
[1:00:24] you testify and you believe it and he
[1:00:28] says as you testify of your salvation
[1:00:32] that you got saved he says that works
[1:00:34] righteousness in your life he said
[1:00:36] testify of of your healing and that
[1:00:39] works healing in your life that's right
[1:00:43] he says you know Paul says hold fast
[1:00:46] your
[1:00:48] profession because we've got a high
[1:00:50] priest that can be touched by the
[1:00:53] feelings of our infirmities so hold fast
[1:00:56] your
[1:00:57] profession and come boldly to the throne
[1:01:00] of grace that you might be able to
[1:01:02] receive help in the time of
[1:01:07] need you can go to you can go to Jesus
[1:01:12] you got a problem you got a sickness you
[1:01:13] got a need I don't care what it is you
[1:01:16] can go to him the thing about it is
[1:01:18] Friends he knows your condition and he
[1:01:21] actually understands
[1:01:24] you I I want you to get this you've
[1:01:27] heard it preached probably uh so many
[1:01:29] years and in all your walking in with
[1:01:33] the Lord as a chrisan and that but look
[1:01:36] he came down in flesh to experience what
[1:01:39] you go through every day in this life so
[1:01:43] he understands
[1:01:46] you I've had people so many times think
[1:01:48] you know they they come to me as a
[1:01:50] pastor or something you know and they're
[1:01:52] like well you you just wouldn't
[1:01:53] understand what I'm going through you
[1:01:54] don't know what it's like to have
[1:01:56] actually had a child die wow I said well
[1:01:59] God is God knows he had a child that
[1:02:05] died look the Bible tells me friends he
[1:02:09] understands us that's the whole reason
[1:02:11] he came down and embodied himself in the
[1:02:14] likeness of man in the likeness of Flesh
[1:02:18] was made lower than the angels and and
[1:02:21] and and God is mindful of him and God is
[1:02:24] mindful of us
[1:02:26] [Music]
[1:02:33] I'm going to tell you something if you
[1:02:34] got to go talk to God about something
[1:02:36] you don't got to get you know real Pious
[1:02:38] and and and real religious and THS and
[1:02:41] th and all that kind of stuff and and
[1:02:43] try to impress god with what you uh your
[1:02:46] spirituality and that just go talk to
[1:02:53] him yes sir look if you're upset if
[1:02:57] you're frustrated if if something just
[1:02:59] got you turned upside down go tell him
[1:03:02] that's
[1:03:03] right that's right if somebody has
[1:03:06] pushed your buttons and got on your last
[1:03:08] nerves go talk to him about it right
[1:03:12] that's good yes
[1:03:16] sir I'll pass this on it is really I
[1:03:19] just slip it in there I I heard a
[1:03:21] brother from Ireland preaching one time
[1:03:24] and he said you know sometimes people
[1:03:25] complain say the service they preach too
[1:03:28] long and the service is too long he said
[1:03:29] I'll tell you what you do the next time
[1:03:31] you feel that after you leave church go
[1:03:33] get on your knees and tell God about
[1:03:36] it just tell him what you're
[1:03:44] feeling good hold fast your
[1:03:48] profession it don't matter what what you
[1:03:52] feel it doesn't matter what is going on
[1:03:55] it doesn't matter what what the the the
[1:03:58] it doesn't matter what things are tests
[1:04:00] and everything else are saying or
[1:04:02] whatever and that you hold
[1:04:05] fast don't accept what the devil's got
[1:04:08] to say about it brother vom actually
[1:04:10] says when you testify he says don't fuss
[1:04:14] with the devil about it that's right
[1:04:16] when the Devil comes to you and tries to
[1:04:19] get you to doubt and all that he said
[1:04:20] you say well people want to say no devil
[1:04:23] I ain't listening to you no devil I
[1:04:24] believe in quot he says don't do it he
[1:04:27] says ignore him don't talk to
[1:04:35] him that's
[1:04:38] right we how do we hold fast our
[1:04:41] profession we we have the promises of
[1:04:47] God the scriptures the the Bible that we
[1:04:50] believe friends it's more than ink on
[1:04:54] paper are plenty of religious people
[1:04:57] that carry around ink on paper that's
[1:04:59] all it is to
[1:05:01] them like I'd preached to to my church
[1:05:03] last Sunday on Easter I said look the
[1:05:06] thing about it is it's got to come down
[1:05:07] to more than ink on paper it's got to
[1:05:09] come down to you being a part in that
[1:05:12] Resurrection Jesus Christ that you
[1:05:14] actually not looking back that Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ arose 2,000 years ago but that
[1:05:19] there's been a resurrection that's
[1:05:21] happened in you there has been a new
[1:05:24] life that's come alive in
[1:05:28] you you are possessed with the spirit of
[1:05:33] Goden that's everything you have need of
[1:05:37] is in
[1:05:38] you you don't got to look for it friends
[1:05:41] look it ain't about ink on paper with
[1:05:43] the Bible it's about that the word of
[1:05:46] God being wrote in our hearts and coming
[1:05:49] alive and being manifest and produced
[1:05:52] through our
[1:05:54] lives that is is
[1:05:56] [Applause]
[1:06:02] faith faith produces the promises to you
[1:06:06] through
[1:06:09] [Applause]
[1:06:13] you
[1:06:15] Hallelujah and don't limit God to how he
[1:06:19] he has to work you know sometimes people
[1:06:22] latch on to one scripture and they they
[1:06:25] limit God to well this is how you got to
[1:06:27] work this one scripture I know it says
[1:06:29] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:06:31] they shall recover I know it says if
[1:06:33] there's any sick among you let them call
[1:06:35] for the Elders of the church and let
[1:06:36] them come and anoint you with order oil
[1:06:38] and the prayer of faith shall save the
[1:06:40] sick but I'm telling you really all it
[1:06:42] takes for you to be healed is just
[1:06:44] accept it believe
[1:06:48] it but not convincing yourself mentally
[1:06:52] I'm talking about something that happens
[1:06:54] down in here
[1:06:57] yes the healing isn't coming from out
[1:07:00] here somewhere it's coming from in here
[1:07:05] sir it's in you brother B said you're
[1:07:08] possessed with it
[1:07:11] sir that's right brother Samuel quoted
[1:07:14] as I was walking out you know that
[1:07:16] everything you have need of including
[1:07:18] the Rapture is in
[1:07:20] you when you have the spirit of God when
[1:07:24] you have the Holy Ghost everything you
[1:07:25] have need of that means
[1:07:27] everything you know brother brandom says
[1:07:30] including the Rapture because people
[1:07:32] look at that as being such a great
[1:07:34] mysterious miraculous thing that is
[1:07:36] going to happen in that but friend so if
[1:07:37] that's so great mysterious and and
[1:07:39] miraculous and all that and and it's in
[1:07:41] us then so is your healing that's
[1:07:46] right so is friends look you you you
[1:07:50] think salvation comes from out here
[1:07:54] somewhere that's good that's so
[1:07:57] good the author of Salvation is in you
[1:08:02] Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] huah and he was made the author of your
[1:08:08] salvation because of the
[1:08:10] suffering that he went through in the
[1:08:13] same kind of body that you walk around
[1:08:18] in now I want you to realize
[1:08:23] this brother Adam says God God will
[1:08:26] actually let his people come down many
[1:08:29] times to the last minute before he moves
[1:08:32] on the scene and does
[1:08:36] something Israel comes out of Egypt they
[1:08:40] they get down there to the Red Sea
[1:08:42] brother Adam said it looked like the
[1:08:43] General Moses had just was a horrible
[1:08:46] General had led them into a trap
[1:08:48] Pharaoh's Army came up behind
[1:08:52] them the people all got scared they're
[1:08:55] all
[1:09:05] crying he let it come down to where it
[1:09:07] would look like okay we're trapped
[1:09:10] there's no way out of this and brother
[1:09:12] Ram says God allows those things to
[1:09:14] happen just so he can come down and show
[1:09:15] how Supernatural he is show his
[1:09:19] power and he does something
[1:09:22] impossible sometimes you know we we
[1:09:24] actually we've heard it so much and
[1:09:26] everybody saw the Ten Commandment movie
[1:09:28] and all these different things and all
[1:09:29] that and so we kind of just some now got
[1:09:31] to where we kind of take it for granted
[1:09:32] but I'm going to tell you something
[1:09:34] rolling rolling back the Red Sea to them
[1:09:36] to walk on dry ground that was a big
[1:09:42] happening I want to tell you something
[1:09:45] greater than the moon passing in front
[1:09:47] of the
[1:09:49] sun yes sir
[1:09:51] am yes
[1:09:53] sir and not only that
[1:09:56] they went through on dry ground Pharaoh
[1:09:58] said if they can do it I can do
[1:10:00] it so where it looked like they was in a
[1:10:02] Trap God just led the devil into a
[1:10:06] trap God told Moses says I'm going to
[1:10:09] drown all of them and they'll never be
[1:10:12] seen
[1:10:13] [Music]
[1:10:15] again that's
[1:10:17] hallu he'll let you come down to the
[1:10:20] last minute brother Ram says he said
[1:10:21] look at Shadrach Meshach and abedo yeah
[1:10:25] yes
[1:10:27] sir and see manye just put yourself in
[1:10:30] the situation of those three children
[1:10:32] those three Hebrew
[1:10:34] children many of us the way we actually
[1:10:37] approach things and think and actually
[1:10:38] even approach our needs in this life
[1:10:40] today and and things we want from God
[1:10:42] and that we're thinking God don't let
[1:10:45] them throw me in that
[1:10:47] furnace I just believe God's going to
[1:10:50] allow something to happen and I'm not
[1:10:51] going to have to go through chemo I'm
[1:10:53] not going to have to go through this I
[1:10:54] ain't going to have to have that
[1:10:57] surgery don't don't let them God's going
[1:11:00] to do something I'm not going to end up
[1:11:01] being in that
[1:11:06] fire look they didn't feel
[1:11:10] anything they didn't get excited they
[1:11:13] didn't feel some kind of you know
[1:11:15] Pentecostal blessing on them
[1:11:20] sir they didn't all the three of them
[1:11:23] all start speaking in tongues and things
[1:11:25] no friends look they said we're putting
[1:11:27] you in there this is the thing we're
[1:11:28] going to play this these instruments and
[1:11:30] when we play them you bow if you don't
[1:11:32] bow we're putting you
[1:11:34] in and they said take a minute to
[1:11:36] consider what you're going to do and he
[1:11:37] said oh no no King we don't we don't
[1:11:39] need to take any time to consider this
[1:11:42] we're not
[1:11:46] bowing they didn't have to have a
[1:11:49] conference they didn't have to have a a

[1:13:10] him on a death march started marching
[1:13:12] them down in in there the fire furnace
[1:13:14] he
[1:13:15] said God didn't show
[1:13:17] up they kept getting closer and closer
[1:13:20] God didn't show up they couldn't feel
[1:13:22] him they didn't see him nothing was
[1:13:24] changing
[1:13:25] he said they got on down there so close
[1:13:27] he said maybe uh the the men behind them
[1:13:30] was maybe a Spear's distance behind them
[1:13:32] driving them in and the Flames were so
[1:13:35] hot that it killed the
[1:13:37] men yep that that was forcing them
[1:13:42] in but they walked on in he said it just
[1:13:46] goes to show you God was actually with
[1:13:49] them they might not be able to feel it
[1:13:51] it might not look like anything was
[1:13:52] happening but God was with them the way
[1:13:56] while these other ones was dying from
[1:13:57] the heat they were marching on in he
[1:14:00] said and that's how Faith Works that's
[1:14:02] the way to do it just accept it believe
[1:14:05] it and keep marching keep walking
[1:14:09] [Applause]
[1:14:12] forward yes sir brother gives a
[1:14:15] dramatization you know he says I can see
[1:14:17] in heaven perhaps maybe an angel saying
[1:14:20] God are are you seeing what's going on
[1:14:22] with your children down here he says oh
[1:14:24] yes I am
[1:14:26] if my eyes are upon the sparrow my eyes
[1:14:28] are upon them he said I see what's
[1:14:32] happening he said ain't you going to do
[1:14:35] something just
[1:14:39] wait they march on down in there
[1:14:42] friends you
[1:14:44] know he
[1:14:46] says he says God says you know what I'm
[1:14:50] not going to send one of you Angels down
[1:14:51] there this time he I'm going to I'm
[1:14:55] going to go down there myself this
[1:14:58] time Nebuchadnezzar you know he he was
[1:15:01] actually his hand being forced it wasn't
[1:15:02] really that he really wanted to do this
[1:15:04] he was just under political pressure you
[1:15:06] know and that and so he says look down
[1:15:09] in there and see what's going on how
[1:15:10] they're fairing they said did we not
[1:15:13] cast three men in the fire Glory said
[1:15:16] yes he said well I see four men down
[1:15:19] there he said and they're not bound
[1:15:23] anymore Hallelujah and the walking
[1:15:25] around down there and the fourth man
[1:15:28] looks
[1:15:29] like God
[1:15:36] hallelujah God showed up the song You
[1:15:39] sung and he took them through the fire
[1:15:41] he'll take us through the
[1:15:47] fire
[1:15:50] Hallelujah he can be touched by the
[1:15:52] feelings of our infirmities amen
[1:15:56] he knows our condition he knows our
[1:15:59] condition because he came down and
[1:16:00] walked in our
[1:16:04] flesh you've heard the
[1:16:06] saying walk a a mile in a man's shoes
[1:16:10] Another Man's
[1:16:11] Shoes to see what they it's like in
[1:16:14] their life and what they go
[1:16:17] through well you want to be
[1:16:21] Christlike he walked in our shoes oh
[1:16:25] sometimes God allows things to come your
[1:16:27] way sicknesses and different things for
[1:16:29] you to go through for you to walk
[1:16:31] through that so that you can experience
[1:16:34] that so that he can come through you and
[1:16:37] be the high priest of people's
[1:16:39] profession so that he can come through
[1:16:41] you and minister to people to show them
[1:16:44] he knows what they're going through and
[1:16:46] feeling because he's got no mouth other
[1:16:48] than your mouth no hands other than your
[1:16:51] hands that's so good
[1:16:57] abely back in
[1:16:59] 2011 I went to Costa Rica in March with
[1:17:02] my father-in-law I came back I went
[1:17:04] home something very traumatic happened
[1:17:08] back in diction and that and uh it it
[1:17:11] caused me such trauma that I actually
[1:17:15] suffered from PTSD from
[1:17:17] it
[1:17:19] and uh I I I actually discovered the
[1:17:23] body of somebody who had committed suici
[1:17:25] side that somebody that I was close to
[1:17:27] dear to me and and
[1:17:30] and but I was already before that I was
[1:17:34] already starting to have some something
[1:17:36] happening to me
[1:17:37] mentally and and I couldn't understand
[1:17:40] it and I had already started to where
[1:17:42] once I got back from Costa Rica that
[1:17:44] that there was times where I was like
[1:17:47] trying to escape it and what I I I did
[1:17:49] was I just go to bed and try to go to
[1:17:51] sleep so that I didn't have to deal with
[1:17:52] this conscious mind
[1:17:56] but but things just kept progressing and
[1:17:59] getting worse and worse as the years
[1:18:03] progressed within a a a year's time it
[1:18:07] had got so bad and I was I was being
[1:18:09] attacked so much and things you know and
[1:18:12] and and people say well uh you know
[1:18:14] there was people that tell me look it's
[1:18:15] just the devil and and you know and that
[1:18:18] and I realize the devil can attack you
[1:18:20] friends but look there's things that can
[1:18:21] go wrong in your
[1:18:23] body and I'll tell you this
[1:18:25] I have found in my experience that
[1:18:28] sometimes people have an actual stigma
[1:18:30] about mental health Y come on now you
[1:18:33] know they can accept somebody having a
[1:18:35] heart condition they they can accept uh
[1:18:37] you know sugar diabetes or high blood
[1:18:39] pressure or even tenser and all these
[1:18:42] things and that but when somebody starts
[1:18:43] suffering in mental health you know it's
[1:18:45] like well whoa now don't you go see a
[1:18:48] doctor over that don't you go talk to
[1:18:50] nobody about
[1:18:53] that yes sir and I didn't know what to
[1:18:57] do and finally you know my my son uh
[1:19:01] youngest son uh my son Nate anyway he
[1:19:04] was getting married and it just caused
[1:19:08] me to re-experience this PTSD from that
[1:19:11] from that day during that day and and I
[1:19:13] was just in a mess but I was trying to
[1:19:15] cover it up and hide it from everybody
[1:19:16] and I didn't tell my wife or anybody
[1:19:18] about it and everything but I was a mess
[1:19:20] that day and so uh afterwards in that
[1:19:25] finally I sat down my my daughter uh
[1:19:27] Jessica is a nurse you know and so I I
[1:19:30] sat down with her and I sat down with my
[1:19:32] wife and I started telling them man this
[1:19:33] is what I'm going through this is what
[1:19:35] I'm experiencing I said and these are
[1:19:36] the thoughts and this is everything
[1:19:38] that's happening at that and so my
[1:19:40] daughter she says you need to go talk to
[1:19:41] your
[1:19:43] doctor so I went and talk to my doctor
[1:19:46] and and the doctor said you know it was
[1:19:48] it was actually uh depression but but it
[1:19:51] wasn't uh you know I had suffered PTSD
[1:19:54] from this atic experience and things and
[1:19:55] all that but I was not depressed because
[1:19:58] of Any outside stressors anything that
[1:20:00] was going on in my life I actually had
[1:20:02] some good things going on in my life my
[1:20:05] son Nate had just got married you know I
[1:20:08] uh you know and as time progressed you
[1:20:10] know I uh you know grandchildren started
[1:20:14] being born there in Dixon I had I had
[1:20:16] two grandchildren you know out uh uh you
[1:20:20] know in Utah in that but the other
[1:20:22] grandchildren started being born around
[1:20:24] there in Dixon and things you know and
[1:20:27] and uh uh you know and and I had a lot
[1:20:29] of happy things going on and and all
[1:20:31] that or whatever and you know and you
[1:20:33] could say well just focus on those
[1:20:35] things just think on that the thing
[1:20:36] about it was it had nothing to do with
[1:20:37] my thoughts that's
[1:20:39] right it was actually I was being struck
[1:20:42] with an
[1:20:43] illness and I went to the doctor and
[1:20:45] they said well you know and I actually
[1:20:46] found this in the message they said the
[1:20:48] chemistry of your body's changed and
[1:20:51] they said you know you you're actually
[1:20:54] uh you're you're having a something
[1:20:56] chemical that's going wrong in your
[1:20:59] brain you know a chemical
[1:21:01] imbalance and that you know and well I
[1:21:04] found just the other day in in in the
[1:21:05] message where brother random was talking
[1:21:07] about how he was sick with his stomach
[1:21:10] and and that he was giv testimony of it
[1:21:12] so he went to the Mayo Clinic and all
[1:21:13] that and had all these different tests
[1:21:15] done and everything else and he was
[1:21:16] talking about how sick he was and how
[1:21:18] this stuff was coming up in his mouth
[1:21:20] and how it was making him weak he
[1:21:22] couldn't hardly get around and he was
[1:21:23] thinking well I've prayed for people
[1:21:25] that's far sicker than what I am and
[1:21:27] they got healed and here I am suffering
[1:21:30] from
[1:21:31] this and brother R says and then he says
[1:21:34] and and I'm suffering mental things he
[1:21:36] says every seven
[1:21:39] years I start suffering mental
[1:21:43] things they say every seven years your
[1:21:46] body goes through a
[1:21:51] change and brother randam in that
[1:21:53] message friends he he he he actually
[1:21:56] left off from testifying says you know
[1:21:59] I'm not healed I I will get back to you
[1:22:01] and let you know how this comes
[1:22:08] out I uh you know I the doctors gave me
[1:22:14] medication the it just kept getting
[1:22:16] worse and worse you know they got a term
[1:22:18] for it they call it uh clinical
[1:22:20] depression I think it is you know which
[1:22:23] which is is not anything you know it's
[1:22:25] not something that you experience and
[1:22:26] you say well I got sad about that that's
[1:22:28] right that's right you know there's
[1:22:31] you've got no understanding of it and
[1:22:34] there's you can't say well and I'll tell
[1:22:36] you before this happened to me I used to
[1:22:38] try to deal with people and I say don't
[1:22:39] think that way well I'm going to tell
[1:22:41] you something it ain't about
[1:22:43] thinking it has nothing to do with
[1:22:49] that and so I could not mentally say
[1:22:53] well what I I'll do is you know I just
[1:22:55] won't think that way and I I'm just
[1:22:57] going to claim I'm Healed you know and
[1:22:59] I'm just not going to accept that or
[1:23:01] whatever it stayed there because the
[1:23:03] thing about it it wasn't actually
[1:23:05] connected to thought
[1:23:10] right you know look friends when a
[1:23:12] person gets cancer brother random says a
[1:23:15] a cell in their body
[1:23:17] backslides and he says and then a life
[1:23:20] enters into that you know and then
[1:23:23] brother B talks about you know casting
[1:23:25] that demon out and that or whatever but
[1:23:27] friends it it's and you say well all
[1:23:29] sickness is of the devil well the thing
[1:23:31] about it is really the reason you get
[1:23:34] sick and experience these different
[1:23:35] diseases and everything it's not really
[1:23:38] you know you say well it's the devil's
[1:23:40] fault it's actually Adam and Eve's
[1:23:44] fault come that's right because they
[1:23:48] disbelieved one
[1:23:50] word brother bam says if they're
[1:23:52] disbelieving one word it's what throwed
[1:23:55] us all into this it's going to take
[1:23:58] believing every word to get us
[1:24:01] out that's
[1:24:03] right yes
[1:24:05] sir so sometimes you can get uh hit with
[1:24:09] afflictions in your body in that and and
[1:24:11] you think that it was the devil that
[1:24:13] come and actually attacked you what
[1:24:15] sometimes happen is your body's failing
[1:24:16] you you're
[1:24:18] dying and then the devil sees that
[1:24:20] happening and so then he comes and
[1:24:21] starts to adding outside stressors
[1:24:29] I got high blood pressure you know and
[1:24:33] there was a time about two couple of
[1:24:36] years ago or so uh my blood pressure it
[1:24:39] was kind of hard medication wasn't
[1:24:41] really working to help me in things and
[1:24:43] and and that but uh you know some the
[1:24:46] one doctor I was going to at that time
[1:24:47] they were saying well it's not too bad
[1:24:49] you know and and they were just kind of
[1:24:50] letting it go but I I was having
[1:24:53] constant pain in my head all the
[1:24:56] time no type of no no type of Tylenol or
[1:24:59] anything else would relieve that it was
[1:25:02] a constant pain that was there you know
[1:25:05] and I sat on my back porch and I
[1:25:07] actually you know that doctor uh had
[1:25:10] gave up the practice so I was having to
[1:25:11] get a new doctor and that and so I I I
[1:25:14] made an appointment but it was becoming
[1:25:15] a new patient so I was having to wait to
[1:25:18] get in to see this new doctor and in the
[1:25:21] meantime and that and so uh while I was
[1:25:23] waiting and I was like I don't know what
[1:25:25] they're going to have to do I don't know
[1:25:26] what this pain is and so there was
[1:25:27] thoughts that would come down now now
[1:25:29] it's the devil thoughts would come in
[1:25:31] and say you might have a tumor you might
[1:25:35] have this you might have that they're
[1:25:37] probably going to have to do a scan on
[1:25:39] your head to figure out what's wrong
[1:25:40] with you it's going to be the first you
[1:25:43] know this here is December the first of
[1:25:44] the year is turning over and so you know
[1:25:47] you're deductible on your insurance and
[1:25:48] all the stuff you got to meet and
[1:25:50] everything and all that is going to turn
[1:25:51] over and start all over again so you got
[1:25:53] to come up with all this
[1:26:00] money I went in it turned out just to be
[1:26:03] blood pressure I didn't have to have any
[1:26:05] other you know brain scans or anything
[1:26:08] like that or whatever they they did do
[1:26:09] some other test to make sure that that
[1:26:11] that blood pressure running that high
[1:26:13] for so long hadn't damaged other things
[1:26:15] other organs and things of our body so
[1:26:17] they ran some test to see and all them
[1:26:19] were okay and all that you know and they
[1:26:21] it took them a while to adjusting
[1:26:23] medications and things like that you
[1:26:25] know and it got my blood pressure you
[1:26:27] know and that pain went away and all
[1:26:28] that and things you know but my point in
[1:26:30] saying all that is you know it started
[1:26:32] and then the devil attacked me right so
[1:26:35] when I was going through this this
[1:26:37] mental illness that I had you know the I
[1:26:41] started going through it and then after
[1:26:42] that the devil started adding stressors
[1:26:44] to make it
[1:26:47] worse there was he he he he worked
[1:26:50] through other people uh you know even uh
[1:26:54] some children that we had adopted in
[1:26:56] that to to bring a an attack and even an
[1:26:59] attack against the family we actually
[1:27:01] ended up in court for over a year over
[1:27:04] one of the
[1:27:06] attacks you know and it just kept these
[1:27:09] things it just seemed like it just kept
[1:27:10] dragging on and on and
[1:27:16] on 200 19 I came here and I and I
[1:27:21] preached a service and I entitled the
[1:27:23] message midnight
[1:27:24] and and I preached and I didn't preach
[1:27:26] real long and then we we but we had a
[1:27:29] lot of prayer for a lot of people
[1:27:31] afterwards and actually I spent more
[1:27:33] time up here praying for the people than
[1:27:34] I'd spent actually
[1:27:36] preaching and and and that and but there
[1:27:38] was somebody who came up for prayer you
[1:27:41] know and and they they were what they
[1:27:44] described to me they were suffering from
[1:27:46] the same mental illness that I was
[1:27:48] suffering
[1:27:50] from and I prayed for them
[1:27:54] and God instantly healed
[1:27:57] them wow they went off of all medication
[1:28:00] and that and everything came back and
[1:28:01] gave testimony God had instantly healed
[1:28:05] them I told my wife I said God I prayed
[1:28:09] for that person God healed them with the
[1:28:11] very thing I'm going through and I'm
[1:28:13] still suffering from
[1:28:19] it October of that year Samuel and I
[1:28:23] went to the Philippines we we we spoke
[1:28:25] at a a youth uh meetings that were there
[1:28:28] a youth
[1:28:29] camp we had uh one uh morning we had a a
[1:28:35] a session of questions and answers for
[1:28:37] for these young people you know and and
[1:28:40] these young people I think they actually
[1:28:42] were all 21 and up I think and uh so
[1:28:46] there was a a young lady there and she
[1:28:50] was asking a question you know and and
[1:28:53] and I found out things more things about
[1:28:55] it later than that but she was asking a
[1:28:56] question and it had to do with mental
[1:28:59] depression and so Samuel was actually
[1:29:02] standing there when she gave the
[1:29:03] question well when she gave the question
[1:29:05] that he turned to me and said why don't
[1:29:07] you address this one and so you know I I
[1:29:10] I spoke uh to her and the young people
[1:29:13] for a minute on that and things you know
[1:29:15] and and and I said you know you can seek
[1:29:19] uh medical uh help in that I said but
[1:29:23] you know but I I don't remember what all
[1:29:25] I said but I actually gave some some
[1:29:27] instructions and things that didn't
[1:29:29] actually have anything to do with uh
[1:29:31] doctors and medical things and all that
[1:29:33] and and and and I don't even remember I
[1:29:35] didn't even remember them what all
[1:29:36] actually all said to this young lady in
[1:29:38] that and then uh that was uh those
[1:29:42] Services ended we we left out of there
[1:29:45] and uh Sunday morning uh brother roel
[1:29:47] took Samuel and he took him to a a
[1:29:51] church to go speak that Sunday morning
[1:29:53] and uh brother boy that was there who's
[1:29:55] actually the pastor of the church there
[1:29:57] now the
[1:29:58] Overcomer he took me him and his wife
[1:30:00] and they took me to speak at this little
[1:30:03] church that was up in this just little
[1:30:06] village like and I got up there and I I
[1:30:09] spoke in this little church we actually
[1:30:12] had a somebody that wanted to get
[1:30:14] baptized after I preached in that and so
[1:30:16] then after they done the baptism and
[1:30:18] that then uh some of them wanted to give
[1:30:20] testimonies and out of this crowd of
[1:30:23] people this small church and that out
[1:30:25] steps that same young
[1:30:27] lady and she says I was suffering from
[1:30:31] this these mental things and she said
[1:30:34] and I was I was ready to take my own
[1:30:37] life and she said and I asked the
[1:30:40] question there in the youth Mee she says
[1:30:42] and brother Jerry spoke and told me what
[1:30:44] to do and things to do and I did that
[1:30:46] she says and I'm
[1:30:52] free
[1:30:59] hallah now you say why why are you
[1:31:01] saying things not to not to point at me
[1:31:03] or lift me up but what I'm saying is
[1:31:05] brother random said you know somebody
[1:31:07] would come up to to be prayed for and he
[1:31:09] said he would see they had no shoes he'd
[1:31:11] put his foot over by their foot to see
[1:31:13] if his shoes would fit them he would he
[1:31:15] would took his shoes off give it to them
[1:31:17] he he he'd looked at to see if his coat
[1:31:19] would fit them he would give it to the
[1:31:20] man brother man says if you want to pray
[1:31:23] and your prayers be successful he says
[1:31:25] put yourself in their
[1:31:30] place and I'm telling
[1:31:33] you it's nothing of me but what I'm
[1:31:37] telling you he says let the mind that
[1:31:39] was in Christ Jesus be in you what does
[1:31:42] that mean for that to happen friends
[1:31:46] then that's why God allows you to suffer
[1:31:49] through things that's why God allows you
[1:31:51] to go through things in that because
[1:31:53] that's part heart of the mind that's in
[1:31:55] Christ Jesus being in you he came down
[1:31:58] and became us so that he could
[1:32:01] understand us and he allows us to go
[1:32:04] through things so that we can do what
[1:32:06] the prophet said put ourself in their
[1:32:08] shoes so our prayer for them is
[1:32:13] successful here I was suffering through
[1:32:16] these things but because I was suffering
[1:32:18] through them and and actually been going
[1:32:20] through them for several years you know
[1:32:23] here I was able God was able to move
[1:32:25] through me and actually pray for them
[1:32:27] and and their faith reach out and them
[1:32:30] get healed of the very thing I was
[1:32:32] suffering
[1:32:33] from God was able to speak through me
[1:32:36] and actually move to them and then be
[1:32:39] deliver to the very thing I was
[1:32:41] suffering
[1:32:51] from that was 2019
[1:32:54] it didn't stop it kept getting worse and
[1:32:56] worse and
[1:33:00] worse finally it got to where you know
[1:33:03] they had increased medication for me and
[1:33:05] everything else to where medication was
[1:33:07] no longer
[1:33:09] working and I'll tell you friends it
[1:33:11] would get so bad there was times you I
[1:33:13] would sit around and I would cry and I'd
[1:33:15] call up the doctor on the phone i' say
[1:33:18] I'm going to Pieces right now I called
[1:33:20] my wife up she was working in Nashville
[1:33:22] and I said I'm going to pieces right now
[1:33:25] I said I I'm ready to end this I said I
[1:33:28] just want to be I want to escape
[1:33:32] this I said I'm experiencing such
[1:33:34] anxiety right now and that and I don't
[1:33:37] know what to
[1:33:41] do you know then that's when the devil
[1:33:44] would come and add other
[1:33:46] stressors well you remember what it felt
[1:33:49] like you know when when you weren't
[1:33:51] serving God and you used to get drunk
[1:33:53] why don't you go do
[1:33:59] that I just said and I'll tell you
[1:34:01] friends when you get that back
[1:34:03] you you you you start searching now what
[1:34:06] am I going to do I just I just want to
[1:34:08] be I want to be free I just want to
[1:34:10] escape
[1:34:12] this and you think well why didn't God
[1:34:15] do something he just let it keep going
[1:34:22] on
[1:34:24] and then last year after I was here in
[1:34:27] July and then I went back
[1:34:29] home and I'll tell you during this time
[1:34:31] there some me lay this in here during
[1:34:32] that time I got to where I felt like
[1:34:34] there there was actually a time you
[1:34:36] might not have knowed about it because
[1:34:37] there was other things going on down
[1:34:38] there and things going on here and there
[1:34:39] was actually a year I think it was 2015
[1:34:42] that I didn't even come up here and
[1:34:44] during that time I I was in such a a
[1:34:47] mental state in a wreck and everything
[1:34:48] else I couldn't even
[1:34:51] preach and then finally I was like well
[1:34:53] i' got I got to start preaching again I
[1:34:55] it's been months and I haven't
[1:34:58] preached I I've got to do this I'm
[1:35:00] supposed to be Pastor in this
[1:35:03] church and so I I just I said I'm going
[1:35:06] to force myself to do
[1:35:08] it but you know and I know maybe you
[1:35:10] don't understand completely how all
[1:35:12] these things work and all that you know
[1:35:13] but I'll tell you friends look it
[1:35:15] doesn't matter how much you know as a
[1:35:17] preacher it doesn't matter how much
[1:35:19] you've
[1:35:20] studied you actually got to get inspired
[1:35:23] ired by the spirit of
[1:35:26] God yes sir and God can actually in he
[1:35:30] he will come and Inspire just a thought
[1:35:32] to you that will take you to a scripture
[1:35:34] and all this and then like Jesus said
[1:35:37] when you've got the Holy Ghost he'll
[1:35:38] bring back to your remembrance
[1:35:40] whatsoever I've said unto you and then
[1:35:42] all these things you've read and heard
[1:35:44] brother Ram said and and and studied on
[1:35:46] and heard you know good good ministers
[1:35:49] uh you know real God called Holy Ghost
[1:35:52] filled ministers of this message preach
[1:35:55] and and teach under that and and you've
[1:35:56] got all these things and that when that
[1:35:58] inspiration comes it just starts drawing
[1:36:00] from all
[1:36:02] that there I was I was like I'm not
[1:36:04] getting no
[1:36:05] inspiration and I'm not feeling anything
[1:36:08] and I would get up and preach and and
[1:36:10] and and and I wasn't feeling the
[1:36:12] excitement I said something to Samuel
[1:36:14] about it one of the times he was in the
[1:36:15] Philippines and he said well I saw you
[1:36:17] out there you look looked side I didn't
[1:36:18] tell him but it was an all in
[1:36:22] Act
[1:36:25] I'm supposed to act this way so I better
[1:36:27] act that
[1:36:31] way and I'll just tell you something you
[1:36:33] know you you can think what you want
[1:36:34] about it whatever but friends I was
[1:36:36] recycling
[1:36:40] messages and my confidence was
[1:36:43] blowing and there was times I just felt
[1:36:45] like I was just getting up and just
[1:36:47] reading stuff and just just you know
[1:36:49] just going through things you
[1:36:52] know but I just kept on
[1:36:55] pushing but then you know uh from I
[1:36:59] think it was from uh it started in 2021
[1:37:04] things begin to change a little bit you
[1:37:06] know and uh I I I started changing it
[1:37:10] started feeling a little different when
[1:37:12] I was preaching it started feeling a
[1:37:13] little different to me and and then uh
[1:37:16] you know uh
[1:37:18] 2022 uh you know I I started I made some
[1:37:21] other changes in in in my physical life
[1:37:24] and things and and so things begin to
[1:37:27] change in that I went to the doctor I
[1:37:28] said I got to get off this medication I
[1:37:30] hate this
[1:37:32] stuff I feel like it just it masks
[1:37:35] everything but it's all still
[1:37:37] there and and and I said I I I just want
[1:37:40] to to get off of it and so started
[1:37:42] coming off of it you know under the
[1:37:44] doctor's guide little by little and
[1:37:45] little by little and and that and uh you
[1:37:48] know of course you know and look I'm not
[1:37:50] trying to Advocate anything but I was
[1:37:52] exercising and dieting and all these
[1:37:54] different things and and trying to
[1:37:55] actually take better care of myself and
[1:37:57] that you know and things and so I was
[1:37:59] starting to prove and and as I was going
[1:38:00] on I was feeling more and more like
[1:38:02] myself and and I was starting to come
[1:38:04] more and more off of these different
[1:38:06] medications and things and that and then
[1:38:09] uh I preached here uh last year in July
[1:38:11] I went back home and I started a series
[1:38:14] of preaching on overcoming and it was
[1:38:16] because that I had individuals in the
[1:38:19] church that had come to me with things
[1:38:21] they were going through and and and
[1:38:22] battling with and that and and and and
[1:38:25] and needed help in that and so I felt
[1:38:27] inspired preach on overcoming and so I I
[1:38:30] I started through and like pastors do
[1:38:33] many times you know you God gives you an
[1:38:35] inspiration you start through it and
[1:38:36] that and it just keeps building and
[1:38:38] building and building and before you
[1:38:40] know it you got part six and part seven
[1:38:42] and part eight and all this you know and
[1:38:44] and and things of the thought you know
[1:38:46] and it just keeps growing and expanding
[1:38:48] and that's how this did you know and
[1:38:50] then uh I think uh one of the uh uh uh
[1:38:54] last messages that I preached on that
[1:38:56] series I I I gave the I was starting to
[1:39:00] beginning to feel a whole lot better and
[1:39:02] I was off of most of all the medication
[1:39:04] and that and and and I got up and I told
[1:39:06] the church look you know that I went
[1:39:08] through these things and everything I
[1:39:09] said but I'm
[1:39:11] back that's right that's
[1:39:15] right and I said I said God has healed
[1:39:22] me and you know and I gave and and
[1:39:25] actually that particular service
[1:39:26] actually they had started singing and
[1:39:28] the the way they do it at our church I I
[1:39:31] I don't know exactly why they do all
[1:39:33] this way but they what they had been
[1:39:35] doing was just actually kind of
[1:39:36] recording from the time I got up to
[1:39:38] speak until I got finish speaking so
[1:39:40] sometimes when Nate comes up to sing in
[1:39:42] that there's no more recording that but
[1:39:44] he' already come up to sing and then
[1:39:46] after he sung it's when I actually
[1:39:47] stepped up and gave the testimony
[1:39:49] there's no record of it and so I gave
[1:39:52] the testimony in that everything you
[1:39:53] know and and and it really bless the
[1:39:55] church mean and I we left we got out we
[1:39:58] went in the truck and uh I I actually
[1:40:01] think I had a couple of the grandkids
[1:40:03] with me I think or something and we were
[1:40:04] going out to eat and I told my wife I
[1:40:06] said okay the rest of that medication
[1:40:07] I'm on I says I'm not taking it
[1:40:10] anymore well that kind of upset her she
[1:40:13] was really worried about me and I said
[1:40:15] no I I've testified God's healed me I
[1:40:17] ain't doing it so uh the next morning
[1:40:20] she gets up and you know she gets up
[1:40:23] about 4:30 in the morning and so she had
[1:40:25] done some research and things you know
[1:40:27] before I got up and she said look let me
[1:40:29] just she just do this let me cuz she she
[1:40:32] actually divies out all my medicine for
[1:40:34] me at the beginning of the week thank
[1:40:37] God for
[1:40:39] her and she puts it all in these little
[1:40:42] trays and all I had to do is just at
[1:40:44] this time take those pills you know and
[1:40:48] uh I look at them I I couldn't tell you
[1:40:50] what one pill was from the other really
[1:40:52] and uh so uh she said let me just start
[1:40:56] and take what you've got left I think it
[1:40:59] was actually only one pill one kind of
[1:41:01] medication I had left said let me just
[1:41:03] start and I'll just take it away a
[1:41:04] little time she said till until until
[1:41:07] you know for a week or so and then then
[1:41:08] you'll be off it I said okay I thought
[1:41:11] you know you know she was really upset
[1:41:13] and I thought okay to satisfy you but I
[1:41:15] believe I'm Healed but anyway I
[1:41:17] testified that
[1:41:19] Sunday I came home that Sund we went out
[1:41:21] to eat I came home that Sunday evening
[1:41:23] we got ready to go to bed and I went and
[1:41:26] I I laid down the bed and I sleep with a
[1:41:28] CPAP machine and so I put that on and if
[1:41:31] you what that is you know it's
[1:41:32] constantly blowing air in your face to
[1:41:34] keep you breathing you know because it's
[1:41:35] a condition that some people have that
[1:41:37] they actually stop breathing while
[1:41:39] they're sleeping and so uh uh so this
[1:41:42] air was constantly blowing in my face
[1:41:44] and I was laying there and it just felt
[1:41:46] like a heavy
[1:41:48] weight had come and rested set down on
[1:41:51] my chest it was was like as if my
[1:41:54] grandson had come in and climbed up and
[1:41:56] sat on my chest while I was laying down
[1:41:58] and I felt like I was suffocating and I
[1:42:01] could feel that weight was there it was
[1:42:04] I could feel
[1:42:07] it and and and and I started panicking
[1:42:11] and I sat back up in the bed I ripped
[1:42:13] that mask off and I was gasping for air
[1:42:15] and I was gasping for air and and and
[1:42:18] and I sat there a little bit you know
[1:42:19] and that and my wife was behind she was
[1:42:21] dozing off and and so then I thought
[1:42:24] okay I'm feeling better I I'll try this
[1:42:26] again I'll lay back down I'd lay back
[1:42:27] down and there it was all again and so
[1:42:30] this happened several times finally I
[1:42:31] said me you're going to have to pray for
[1:42:32] me I said I'm going to tell you what it
[1:42:34] is I said the devil is attacking
[1:42:38] me and I said and and and but but but it
[1:42:42] it feels real I can feel this this is
[1:42:44] not my
[1:42:45] imagination and so you know she prayed
[1:42:47] for me eventually I was able to get a
[1:42:50] little sleep I got up that that next
[1:42:52] morning you know
[1:42:53] and and I went out and that whole week I
[1:42:56] sat around the house I couldn't do
[1:42:58] nothing I didn't have any energy for
[1:42:59] anything and I sat around the house and
[1:43:02] that weight was on me on my chest like
[1:43:04] somebody sitting on me all the time and
[1:43:06] I I was my wife would come out and she
[1:43:09] would sit down and I was just sitting
[1:43:11] there gasping for
[1:43:13] air
[1:43:15] and it got on in uh to I think Saturday
[1:43:20] and
[1:43:21] u i i I was I was sitting there on the
[1:43:25] couch and and I
[1:43:28] was you know and I I did I kept telling
[1:43:31] my wife look I testified and I believe
[1:43:34] that that God has healed
[1:43:36] me and I I said and
[1:43:39] and I said so I I'm not I'm not going to
[1:43:43] accept this I'm not going to accept any
[1:43:44] of this but it wasn't changing anything
[1:43:46] it was still all
[1:43:49] there
[1:43:51] so I I text my mom just to ask her hey
[1:43:56] could you pray for me this is what's
[1:43:57] happening can you pray for me you know
[1:44:00] cuz I had actually been texting her a
[1:44:02] testimony and telling her how God was
[1:44:04] working on it but here I told her this
[1:44:06] is what I've been suffering since Sunday
[1:44:07] night and I said and here it was
[1:44:09] Saturday and I said and and I said it's
[1:44:11] not getting any better I said could you
[1:44:12] just pray for me and so she she went to
[1:44:15] prayer but then right away she text
[1:44:17] Samuel and he was actually out of town
[1:44:18] somewhere uh getting ready to minister
[1:44:21] uh somewhere and and and that so she
[1:44:24] text him and and he he texts her back
[1:44:26] and he says I just read this quote right
[1:44:31] here and so she quickly forwarded the
[1:44:34] the quote onto me I think she said she
[1:44:36] didn't even read the quote she just
[1:44:38] forwarded on me and read the quote
[1:44:40] afterwards and and and that and and and
[1:44:43] this is what it said I I sat down I I
[1:44:45] got the quote on my phone and I started
[1:44:47] to read it and and it said and then
[1:44:50] after I read it on my phone I I jumped
[1:44:51] up I went and got my laptop I brought it
[1:44:53] into the living room put it on a tray
[1:44:54] there in front of the couch and and
[1:44:56] quickly looked it up so I could look up
[1:44:58] the whole context of the whole thing
[1:45:00] what brother random was dealing with and
[1:45:01] things but this is what he says this is
[1:45:03] in healing what cancer is he said a
[1:45:06] woman came here with cancer and all at
[1:45:08] once something strikes her and she says
[1:45:10] oh I see it and the Holy Spirit reveals
[1:45:12] what's wrong with her and tells her what
[1:45:14] she's done and what she has to do to get
[1:45:16] rid of everything and then pronounces
[1:45:18] God blessing upon her and away she goes
[1:45:20] and she's believing with her heart and
[1:45:22] she feels good and she goes home and she
[1:45:25] starts eating she says I'm fine and
[1:45:27] dandy in a few days she began to get
[1:45:29] sick and the doctor said uh you need to
[1:45:32] stay away from that bunch of Fanatics
[1:45:34] and it says and and but he sent word to
[1:45:36] her and said it and it's the very best
[1:45:40] sign in the world that the woman's
[1:45:43] [Music]
[1:45:45] healed and when I read that
[1:45:48] hallu something happened to me so fast
[1:45:51] it was quicker than thought
[1:45:54] Glory it wasn't my mind dwelling in
[1:45:56] thinking on
[1:45:59] this it wasn't you know there was no
[1:46:02] time for me to figure this out
[1:46:04] intellectually or or latch on to it even
[1:46:06] intellectually there was just something
[1:46:08] to
[1:46:09] instantaneously
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:15] happened it's the best side in the world
[1:46:18] you're
[1:46:21] healed
[1:46:23] that weight was instantly
[1:46:26] gone it was a demon it was a spirit it
[1:46:29] was the devil here's the thing I found
[1:46:31] out brother Ram said you go testify to
[1:46:34] something and when you testify of it the
[1:46:36] devil is sure to come and bring an
[1:46:39] attack on you and you'll actually be
[1:46:41] attacked for the testimony you gave
[1:46:44] that's right that's right that's
[1:46:48] right and he says and God will actually
[1:46:51] allow it to happen
[1:46:55] to see what you're going to
[1:46:58] do well look it ain't go you friends
[1:47:00] look it ain't God trying to figure you
[1:47:02] out it's actually God trying to show you
[1:47:05] him in
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:09] you look Jehovah the whole name of
[1:47:12] Jehovah is all about God wanting to
[1:47:14] reveal
[1:47:17] himself he is he is The God Who reveals
[1:47:21] himself am
[1:47:23] and this was just him wanting to reveal
[1:47:26] himself in

[1:56:56] compassion so that we can have
[1:56:58] understanding so that so that we

[2:12:31] see what God is doing he's the same God
[2:12:33] and every generation has has a fresh
[2:12:36] visitation amen so we want to just uh
[2:12:39] baptize uh sister Brianna here and we're
[2:12:41] so thankful for the testimony of what
[2:12:44] the Lord has been doing in her life and
[2:12:46] then on Thursday we had just a moment
[2:12:48] back there in the office and she would
[2:12:50] just get relating to me of you know even
[2:12:53] in her testimony and where God has
[2:12:55] brought her to uh you know for her
[2:12:57] coming into repentance and really just
[2:13:00] um recognizing her need of the Lord as
[2:13:03] her Savior and Redeemer and a desire
[2:13:06] just to walk on with God and I told her
[2:13:08] right back there I said the same
[2:13:10] yielding that's taken place the god that
[2:13:13] led you to repent is the same God that
[2:13:16] wants to come fully into your life and
[2:13:19] it's just one little statement that I
[2:13:20] can make that a applies to all of us the
[2:13:22] more that we surrender the more God will
[2:13:25] come in and that's the thing is that
[2:13:28] God's our desire is God just may you
[2:13:31] fill her life to a complete complete
[2:13:33] fullness I've watched I've watched
[2:13:35] Brianna here over the past years watched
[2:13:37] her setting in the youth youth meetings
[2:13:39] there even at our home let alone here in
[2:13:41] service you know she runs the slides but
[2:13:43] she's back there taking notes and
[2:13:45] running slides and the reason I know
[2:13:47] that is because in our meetings there at
[2:13:48] the house she's taking notes and and the
[2:13:51] things that's going on in the youth
[2:13:52] meetings and then they'll talk about it
[2:13:54] on the way home so I tell you what the
[2:13:56] word God is getting his word to his
[2:13:59] children amen and so I want to say I I
[2:14:02] thank God for what he's doing in in
[2:14:04] Sister Brianna's life what he's going
[2:14:06] doing in every young person in every one
[2:14:07] of our Lives because God's at work God
[2:14:11] is at work and though we may not see it
[2:14:14] here we may not see what God's doing in
[2:14:16] somebody else's life but rest assured
[2:14:19] God is working amen and what God does in
[2:14:22] secret will be rewarded and made
[2:14:24] manifest openly amen so let's just go to

[2:23:06] a half or so ago now uh I was at work uh
[2:23:09] had a little episode um and uh had to
[2:23:13] leave work and I figured well I better
[2:23:15] go get checked out um I had shortness of
[2:23:18] breath and just a lot of things and
[2:23:21] uh went to the doctor um kind of make a
[2:23:24] long story short and uh they found um
[2:23:27] the the doctor sat down with me and said
[2:23:30] you have uh some damage to your heart
[2:23:34] uh Eerie IR reversible uh damage to your
[2:23:38] heart um moderate you know it's it's
[2:23:41] it's not like super serious it's just a
[2:23:43] moderate thing um I talked to my at my
[2:23:47] job I talked to them about it uh the POS
[2:23:50] position I have is is can be very
[2:23:53] stressful and so they were just real
[2:23:56] nice about it and said well uh we'll let
[2:23:59] you step into another position a lot
[2:24:01] less stressful and stuff just you know
[2:24:03] let us know um and and they were just
[2:24:07] real nice about it and such so I had
[2:24:09] until this past Monday uh to to let them
[2:24:13] know and
[2:24:15] uh so I'd been praying about it and just
[2:24:20] really
[2:24:21] going uh back and forth with you know
[2:24:22] what what to do and just not getting you
[2:24:26] know the the Thunderbolt leading that I
[2:24:29] was I was looking for so
[2:24:33] um but all all last weekend I just uh
[2:24:36] what what just kept coming back to me
[2:24:38] was I I know that the Lord led me into
[2:24:41] this position I I I I know that for a
[2:24:44] fact you know and he really wasn't
[2:24:47] leading me anywhere else even though I
[2:24:49] wasn't getting yes or no I I was not
[2:24:52] getting you know a leading to go
[2:24:54] anywhere else
[2:24:56] so I text emailed my my uh my boss in HR
[2:25:02] um Monday
[2:25:04] morning and uh
[2:25:07] said in in a way kind of apologize said
[2:25:09] I don't mean to you know be religious or
[2:25:12] anything but you know
[2:25:14] the one of my favorite uh verses in the
[2:25:18] Bible is brother Jerry quoted the Lord
[2:25:20] is my
[2:25:21] shepherd and I just told him he led me
[2:25:24] into this position and I'm not going to
[2:25:26] let fear lead me out of this position
[2:25:29] and
[2:25:29] so um that's what I wanted to uh you
[2:25:32] know share with you how you know
[2:25:36] sometimes it just came up came about in
[2:25:39] the in in the service today is is you
[2:25:42] know it's sometimes is fear or or other
[2:25:44] other things that can be U motivators
[2:25:46] and such and God brings these things
[2:25:49] about and and it's not not about you
[2:25:51] know this isn't really about me or
[2:25:52] anything you know it's about what God is
[2:25:55] doing you know to us and and showing us
[2:25:58] things about ourselves that
[2:26:00] we sometimes don't even know about so he
[2:26:03] has to bring a circumstance about it's
[2:26:05] not to show that he can do something
[2:26:07] it's to show us things about ourselves
[2:26:10] and let us understand things better so
[2:26:14] um that's right still don't know I go
[2:26:16] through I've been through half a stress
[2:26:18] test and all these tests and stuff I go
[2:26:20] on Wednesday for the second half of the
[2:26:22] stress test and things don't know how
[2:26:25] it's going to work out but all I know is
[2:26:26] just sitting this morning
[2:26:28] and uh it just came to me you know God
[2:26:31] takes a special ear when things are said
[2:26:34] irreversible or impossible he listens to
[2:26:38] that type of language and and he is the
[2:26:40] god of impossible he's the god of
[2:26:42] irreversible so uh kind of like uh you
