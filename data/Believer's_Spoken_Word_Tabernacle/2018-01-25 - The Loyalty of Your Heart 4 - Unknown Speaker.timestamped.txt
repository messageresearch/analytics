[24:27] [Music]
[24:33] [Music]
[24:43] and
[24:49] [Music]
[25:13] [Music]
[25:31] you believe that why'd you believe that
[25:40] because you're a believer you know why
[25:44] you're a believer cause he ordained you
[25:45] to be a boy and he has brought forth
[25:50] what he has ordained let's just turn in
[25:57] the word of the Lord tonight the Romans
[25:59] chapter 5 verse 1 in the house of the
[26:03] Lord
[26:25] Romans chapter 5 verse 1 therefore being
[26:33] justified by faith we have peace with
[26:36] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[26:40] whom also we have access by faith into
[26:43] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[26:47] in hope of the glory of God and not only
[26:52] so but we glory in tribulations also
[26:56] knowing that tribulation worketh
[26:59] patience and notice at verse 2 there is
[27:02] glory we are rejoicing waiting in
[27:05] expectation in the coming of the Lord
[27:08] but then with an understanding in verse
[27:11] 3 and not only so not just rejoicing and
[27:14] glory in that but we glory in
[27:17] tribulations also knowing that
[27:20] tribulation worketh patience this word
[27:25] worketh here which we want to deal with
[27:27] a little bit more tonight tribulation
[27:30] worketh patience it's to cause or to
[27:34] work out to perform accomplish or
[27:37] achieve so it's in you but it must be
[27:42] worked out we all have to have that work
[27:48] down when does it reach it's in when we
[27:51] are changed it's there in us and to be
[27:56] worked out of us and patience experience
[28:02] and experience hope and hope maketh not
[28:08] ashamed
[28:09] just like the song we said God can do it
[28:12] again our expectation we're not ashamed
[28:17] there's also experiences that have come
[28:20] in our life as brother Ram tells us that
[28:21] when you go through sickness or whatever
[28:24] it is that you've been through going
[28:26] through those things are given to us
[28:30] that we might also have a testimony it's
[28:34] just like how can you tell somebody he's
[28:35] a savior if you don't know
[28:36] is how do you know him to what degree do
[28:40] you know him to be a savior is that
[28:43] right so it's to know to what what
[28:45] degree and then it's a testimony brother
[28:48] M says it's no longer you saying huh I
[28:50] you know I know him to be a healer but
[28:52] you know by experience music Amen and
[28:58] hope maketh not ashamed because the love
[29:00] of God He shed abroad in our hearts by
[29:03] the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[29:06] let's just tonight Heavenly Father Lord
[29:13] Jesus as we take Lord a few moments now

[30:21] commit ourselves to you ask that you
[30:23] would just have your way tonight and
[30:25] speak to arts in a very personal way in
[30:27] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[30:29] amen may God bless you bless His Word
[30:34] and bless you as you're being seated
[30:38] I want to look here tonight and going
[30:44] back into this quote we've been looking
[30:47] at out of three kinds of believers and
[30:52] when you you look at it that everything
[30:55] that within our lives that once an
[31:00] individual has been born of the Spirit
[31:03] of God we we no longer as us going by
[31:07] our own nature it's not us trying to
[31:10] perform the Word of God by our own
[31:13] nature but it is God Himself that is
[31:15] performing his word in our life and
[31:18] admit has to be him it has to be him to
[31:21] do it as a matter of fact even of the
[31:24] greatest amount of what we would deem to
[31:26] be humility yet God himself through the
[31:29] Prophet tells us in desperation he said
[31:31] that even taking off our shoes would not
[31:34] satisfy what God is calling for he said
[31:38] the only thing that will satisfy is a
[31:40] life that would bring forth the fruit of
[31:42] the Spirit and the fruit of the Spirit
[31:45] is that of the life that would be
[31:48] working through the actual branches that
[31:51] are designed to give a true witness and
[31:53] a true reflection of the life that is
[31:56] within the violin as we looked at it
[31:58] last week that the trial itself is also
[32:01] a time of purging where many that would
[32:04] have you know the orchards in different
[32:05] places around us there is a time of
[32:08] purging or cleansing pruning back that
[32:11] the tree itself might continue to
[32:13] receive the light it needs in the middle
[32:15] as well as to continue to bear more
[32:18] fruit and God Himself he he knows
[32:21] exactly what what he's doing within our
[32:24] life there's there's not one of us that
[32:25] when we were born again that we came out
[32:28] fully mature but we have received the
[32:31] maturity of the promise of the life that
[32:34] has been ministered to us in this day
[32:36] and we come to maturity under that word
[32:40] and in that word that we have been
[32:42] ministered to and birthed by so when
[32:46] Paul would talk about the gospel of our
[32:48] salvation we know that God
[32:50] is very precise in that there is a word
[32:53] his word that is allotted for each day
[32:56] in each time and when that word itself
[32:59] the people of God um whom that word is
[33:01] ordained to be reflected through in
[33:04] their life that word by the Spirit of
[33:07] God will seek out the children of God
[33:09] and then by by the Spirit of God we are
[33:11] birthed into the body of Jesus Christ
[33:14] which is the Word of God which is Christ
[33:17] himself and so living out that word when
[33:21] we are coming into that it requires us
[33:24] and coming into a continual yielding
[33:26] just like we heard ministered here on
[33:28] Sunday you you never stopped yielding
[33:30] you don't yield and say well I come to
[33:32] the altar and then I yield it and my
[33:34] life has been cleansed up and I've
[33:35] yielded and and I've received the Holy
[33:37] Ghost but that right there equips you
[33:39] the Holy Spirit equips you to go into
[33:42] deeper realms of yielding than you've
[33:44] ever could go within your own natural
[33:46] ability so it takes it takes the Spirit
[33:49] of God to move within our lives for us
[33:52] to be able to come into those places and
[33:55] be able to bring our lives in subjection
[33:57] and submit ourselves unto his word and
[34:00] to his care and so when we're looking at
[34:03] this and I think of that word patience
[34:05] of how that tribulation worketh or works
[34:08] out patience itself and the very word
[34:11] patience is that of the steadfastness or
[34:14] the constancy the endurance in the new
[34:17] testament it's the characteristic of a
[34:19] man who has not swerve from his
[34:21] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[34:23] faith and piety by even the greatest
[34:26] trials and sufferings patiently in
[34:29] steadfastly waiting for a patient
[34:32] enduring sustaining and perseverance now
[34:34] this loyalty of faith it doesn't mean
[34:36] that you and I may not come to what we
[34:39] would think I'm at my breaking point but
[34:41] as far as our humanity our humanity
[34:43] would reach a breaking point and it does
[34:46] reach the breaking point as a matter of
[34:47] fact the test in the trial exposes our
[34:50] humanity and the test and trial exposes
[34:53] that you and I are not in glorified
[34:55] bodies we are in earthen vessels vessels
[34:58] that are still fragile and it exposes
[35:00] the weakness
[35:02] of our life there is not one of us in
[35:04] here that likes to faint or look about
[35:06] our weaknesses but yet it's our
[35:08] weaknesses that we come to have made
[35:11] known there's no weakness in your soul
[35:13] if you're born again there's no weakness
[35:15] in my soul if I've been born again but
[35:17] where the weakness would lie what is God
[35:20] trying to do is God trying to perfect my
[35:22] flesh no he's trying to perfect the
[35:25] character of my life and the only way he
[35:27] can protect and perfect that character
[35:30] is by the indwelling of his own
[35:32] character his own life he molds and he
[35:36] shapes our life I'm sure that if we
[35:39] could have had our way we would have
[35:40] rather have had character somehow
[35:42] wrapped up and given to us as a gift
[35:45] because if it was given as a gift
[35:47] there'd be no dying there would be
[35:48] nothing that we would have to do it
[35:50] would be simply handed to us and when we
[35:53] would stand there on that day we would
[35:54] be able to tell the Lord I would praise
[35:56] you but I have nothing to declare
[35:58] that I have overcome because when you
[36:00] gave me the Holy Ghost everything right
[36:02] there I was already overcoming perfect
[36:05] but that's not the truth of the matter
[36:07] the truth of the matter is when we are
[36:09] born of the Spirit of God we have
[36:11] overcome the world we don't have to go
[36:14] through a list of things but we have
[36:16] within us the life that has overcome the
[36:19] world this present state and cosmos this
[36:22] system this administration that's upon
[36:25] the world of which you and I came into
[36:27] this earth under but the grace of God
[36:29] that life has moved upon us to raise us
[36:33] up into that other realm and into a
[36:36] place to where God can begin to deal and
[36:39] mold and shape and bring out what is
[36:41] placed in our life that what you want I
[36:43] want that I want that continual
[36:45] development so when we're looking at it
[36:48] you look at how brother Branham makes a
[36:50] statement here in three kinds of
[36:51] believers and he says sometimes
[36:53] believers put to the test and not
[36:56] sometimes but every time for every Sun
[36:59] that cometh to God must be chastened
[37:01] tried and child trained and remember the
[37:05] trials the dusty roads the hot Sun of
[37:08] persecution but though he says remember
[37:11] the trials the dusty roads
[37:13] the hot Sun of persecution but the
[37:14] loyalty of your heart beats that
[37:17] material what material your character so
[37:22] the loyalty of my heart the loyalty of
[37:25] your heart is actually beating out the
[37:28] character into the mold or the shape
[37:31] that God Himself is desiring but it's
[37:35] not my it's not me it's not you but it's
[37:37] the loyalty of the heart what loyalty
[37:39] are we talking about because loyalty
[37:42] itself can be across all sorts of things
[37:43] but the ban tells us himself Cain was a
[37:46] loyal believer seeing very very very
[37:49] powerful statements he said Cain himself
[37:51] who was humble humble how was Cain
[37:54] humble what level could came come to
[37:56] Cain could only come to a certain level
[37:58] of humility but Cain could not humble
[38:01] himself to the life of the word of what
[38:04] the word was calling for in that hour
[38:06] you know there's a greater humility for
[38:08] you and I it's not something that we've
[38:10] attained to and these things that we're
[38:11] looking at and we set back and say okay
[38:14] seatbelts buckled
[38:15] I'm rapture ready I'm ready to go I'm
[38:17] waiting on everybody else that's not the
[38:19] work of the Spirit of God in our life
[38:21] when they were born by the Spirit of God
[38:23] even during the time of Luther when
[38:25] their birth they were not automatically
[38:28] born fully mature but they had to come
[38:30] into the full image and stature of the
[38:33] word that was spoken within that hour
[38:35] how did they do it by continually
[38:37] yielding to the working of the Spirit of
[38:40] God that had come through the word in
[38:42] that hour and the Spirit of God you say
[38:44] well why didn't the Spirit of God just
[38:45] do it why don't he just give why don't
[38:47] it just be the Spirit of God why does it
[38:49] have to be the word because the people
[38:51] of God the elect are moved by the Word
[38:53] of God and the Spirit directs the people
[38:56] to the word so that the people have an
[38:58] expectation of what is to be fulfilled
[39:01] within that hour so Gramps I'm so
[39:04] thankful for that so the loyalty of
[39:06] heart it's more than just being loyal to
[39:09] to something it's having a loyalty to
[39:12] Christ himself not just loyalty to a
[39:14] church we understand that you can be
[39:16] loyal to a church you can be loyal to
[39:19] principles you can be loyal to standards
[39:21] that's not the loyalty that we're
[39:23] talking about here the loyalty
[39:25] we're talking about is that of an
[39:27] invincible union where Christ himself
[39:29] has come and made the heart of the
[39:32] individual his very own throne and it is
[39:35] a union whereby Paul would talk in
[39:37] reverent Romans a it is the love of
[39:39] Christ that is dwelling on the inside
[39:41] and that's where Paul could say who who
[39:44] can separate us from the love of Christ
[39:47] not what who can separate us so when
[39:50] we're looking at it if this is the power
[39:52] of the indwelling of his Union in this
[39:56] union in our lives we love him because
[39:58] he first loved us right so the loyalty
[40:03] of your heart beats the materials so
[40:05] when the test or trial comes our way the
[40:08] loyalty of the material under loyalty of
[40:10] the heart underneath the tester trial
[40:12] actually is beating out the material
[40:16] that is there until he says she's ready
[40:19] to go in the mold what is it that you
[40:22] and I are gonna take with us a character
[40:25] our character and yet now the Lord Jesus
[40:29] would speak even at the end of this age
[40:32] come and buy of me gold that's tried in
[40:34] the fire and yet he won't accept none of
[40:37] your money it don't matter how rich
[40:42] somebody is he don't heal up that kinda
[40:43] it's not how you buy this the only way
[40:45] you buy it is through submission the
[40:48] only way this kind of gold is bought is
[40:50] through humility
[40:51] so notice he says God's children is made
[40:55] up correctly on his word for they are
[40:57] living examples and the Word of God
[40:59] living through them the trial he said it
[41:03] comes to shake you to put you to the
[41:05] very bottom to see where you'll stand
[41:08] they tested tried every son that cometh
[41:11] to God and Joe went through the trials
[41:14] and tests and his children taken
[41:15] everything else taken the church members
[41:18] come accused him of being a secret
[41:20] sinner and tried to say everything
[41:22] against him but yet he wouldn't listen
[41:24] to any of it he knowed he had met God's
[41:26] requirements he know there's no need of
[41:28] Satan trying to tempt him he knowed it
[41:31] was the devil and as long as Satan can
[41:34] make him believe
[41:35] that his sickness was his God doing it
[41:37] he had job quit you know there's certain
[41:42] things that you can know that it's God
[41:43] doing it
[41:44] I mean Satan coming at you you can know
[41:47] that the sickness that you got coming
[41:50] you can know and say this sickness or
[41:52] maybe somebody at work is rubbing you
[41:53] the wrong way or somebody in church or
[41:55] whatever more and you can know hey wait
[41:57] a minute that's not my brother my sister
[41:59] that's not my boss that's not my husband
[42:01] that's not my wife that is the enemy
[42:03] that's one thing to know about it but
[42:05] it's also Nene it's also needful for us
[42:08] to know that Lord God I need you to also
[42:11] make sure that my life is in the right
[42:13] condition in conduct during this time
[42:19] that's where we need help but that's the
[42:23] very purpose of the trial to do reduce
[42:26] us from our strengths glory be to God
[42:32] anybody like to be told their weaknesses
[42:34] if you do I'll tell you to come on up
[42:36] here and we'll pray the line devil off
[42:38] of it because that's not true nobody
[42:40] likes to hear weaknesses nobody likes to
[42:44] have what you know how they always when
[42:46] I was going through the teaching thing
[42:47] constructive criticism I think some
[42:51] people man they just they need to have
[42:53] an office constructive criticizing is
[42:56] that right I mean they could be the CEO
[42:59] of the company that might be a good
[43:01] project man we can make apps and
[43:03] everything else and everything else
[43:05] constructive criticizers not what kind
[43:08] of school could we have well we
[43:12] definitely have one that God don't want
[43:13] to be in but when job one struck that
[43:17] revelation penny was not God he was only
[43:21] going through his trials to make him
[43:24] something
[43:24] it wasn't God doing it it was Satan
[43:27] doing it and the same thing today you'll
[43:29] try to tell you these trials and thing
[43:32] is your God trying to put punishment
[43:34] upon you it isn't so no sir
[43:37] it's Satan doing it and God permitting
[43:40] it to temper you to make you see if you
[43:44] are tied to this earth
[43:46] by the earth tears or whether your
[43:49] treasure is in heaven for where your
[43:52] treasure is there you are also that's
[43:54] right your heart is where your treasures
[43:56] are so as he said this very this very
[44:01] tempering us is to temper us it's this
[44:04] trial is to temper us and to make us see
[44:07] if we're tied to this earth by earth
[44:11] cares there's a lot more earth cares
[44:13] than just than just finances I want you
[44:17] to understand there's a lot more to
[44:19] earth cares than that earth cares goes
[44:23] so deep to understand that we're talking
[44:25] about even the vessel you're dwelling in
[44:27] we're talking about things we're talking
[44:29] about feelings we're talking about all
[44:31] of those things come along with earth
[44:34] cares you know it are even our treasures
[44:38] our treasures that let me just go on let
[44:41] me just move on it'll get there in the
[44:44] in the word temper itself I don't want
[44:46] to lose time here on the word temper
[44:47] notice I begin to look at this some
[44:49] weeks ago and looking at this temper and
[44:51] I know I've got people here that
[44:52] understand this a whole lot more than me
[44:54] so then maybe they can hold an a class
[44:56] after I'm done here tonight but they get
[44:58] over the part of it with tempering to
[45:00] temper something because brother
[45:01] Graham's elders these are only given to
[45:03] temper us and to temper something is to
[45:06] improve the hardness and elasticity of
[45:09] steel or other metal by reheating and
[45:12] then cooling it think you mean you can't
[45:17] do it any other way no it's got to be
[45:21] read it and who going into a trial
[45:25] coming out of a trial going into a trial
[45:28] coming out of a trial the good news is
[45:31] is that if you're heading out of a try
[45:33] if you are in the trial now you're
[45:35] getting ready to exit I don't know how
[45:37] long but you're on your way out and the
[45:43] good thing about it is if you're out of
[45:44] a trial you're getting ready to head
[45:45] into one kind of like it says you meet
[45:50] yourself coming and going
[45:53] so it's 2:10 for you now notice it's to
[45:56] improve the consistency or resiliency of
[46:00] a substance by heating it or adding
[46:02] particular substances to it
[46:04] so the steel or or whatever it is them
[46:06] that the different iron alloys or
[46:08] certain things they within themselves
[46:11] though they have the qualities that are
[46:13] within them that's needed to actually be
[46:16] able to serve or to perform certain
[46:18] duties or to be used as an instrument or
[46:21] something in that measure yet depending
[46:23] on what the purpose is that the person
[46:26] has in mind when they purchase the steel
[46:28] or the iron alloy or what have you there
[46:30] the purpose that it's going to be used
[46:32] for will determine the process that it
[46:35] goes through it will determine even how
[46:38] that they will calculate the heat and
[46:40] how they will pool it and what did they
[46:42] do it slowly or whether they do it
[46:43] rapidly it will all determine the
[46:46] purpose I don't think there's a piece of
[46:50] steel or pieces of iron that could talk
[46:54] do you I don't think there's a piece of
[46:57] steel so why in the world are they doing
[46:58] this to me answers why in the world am I
[47:02] going through this it's not up to him
[47:06] it's not up to the steel look I don't
[47:09] see the steel or the iron it's no more
[47:11] than just an instrument whereby that
[47:13] someone would have a desire or a purpose
[47:15] to actually come by and take that piece
[47:18] of iron or steel and shape it here's the
[47:22] common objectives of heat treatment to
[47:24] increase strength increase hardness
[47:26] improve toughness I'll pick up some of
[47:28] these in a moment improve machining
[47:31] which that machining is to be able to
[47:33] take raw material and cut it into a
[47:37] desired shape and size so it objective
[47:41] one of the objective is to be able by
[47:43] machining is to take the steel and
[47:46] there's an image there's a precise
[47:49] pattern and be able to stamp that right
[47:53] on so that's the desire for machining
[47:57] also for for mobility which is the
[48:00] capacity to be shaped to improve
[48:03] ductility or increased ductility
[48:06] to improve elasticity or the ability to
[48:09] change I may believe that God wants us
[48:11] to change that's the desire that's what
[48:15] the Spirit of God comes back in the
[48:17] service as he's moving on our lives and
[48:20] then it don't stop in the service it
[48:22] continues to go with us is that right
[48:25] we don't leave him on the doorstep a
[48:27] command Lord Jesus one mold shape
[48:30] continue to work in my life this isn't a
[48:33] name that claimant it's done when God
[48:35] brings his word across our life it
[48:37] requires us dying to ourselves if you
[48:40] recall even one of the things that the
[48:41] Spirit of the Lord had spoke to brother
[48:43] John here on Sunday when brother John
[48:44] was sinned when he was dealing with how
[48:46] that certain things would come about in
[48:48] our life certain things that we don't
[48:49] even ask for that come to our doorstep
[48:51] and those things mites might show up and
[48:53] one of the things that he mentioned he
[48:55] said pray unpeeled until that's exactly
[48:59] what the Prophet tells us in the
[49:01] revelation series and throughout he
[49:03] talks about of bitterness comes or these
[49:04] other things What did he say do get a
[49:06] cropping hole and grub it out wow that
[49:14] means it's going to take work even if I
[49:18] agreed with that word and there's things
[49:20] that that might be building up and then
[49:22] I sense it maybe Monday morning what do
[49:24] I do stay right in prayer why am i
[49:27] staying right in prayer because what God
[49:29] has said is where he is faithful to
[49:31] perform that word and that's why I'll
[49:34] stand on it that's my promise but I can
[49:37] be free glory be to God tempering
[49:42] tempering is used to increase the
[49:45] toughness of iron alloys particularly
[49:50] still on tempered steel is very hard but
[49:55] it's too brittle for most applications
[49:58] wow it's it's so hard but if it's
[50:01] untempered it's brittle and I don't mean
[50:06] we're going to break it like a frosted
[50:08] flake or something but it's brittle it
[50:11] cannot be it's not usable
[50:16] when I think of how that God works and
[50:19] moves and deals with our lives
[50:22] sometimes we wonder why there's some
[50:24] wide that and why that but yet God has a
[50:28] purpose within it all
[50:29] he knows the machinability he needs out
[50:32] of our life
[50:33] he knows the ductility he knows the
[50:35] elasticity he knows before mobility
[50:37] he knows the hardness that he needs out
[50:40] of our life he knows that Oh Lord I hope
[50:45] you don't leave me in this fire too long
[50:47] no he knows how long he he knows what
[50:49] he's trying to achieve in that time so
[50:52] I'm tempered steel is very hard but it's
[50:55] too brittle for most applications
[50:58] tempering is commonly done after
[51:01] hardening to reduce excess hardness now
[51:03] tempering is used to alter let me look
[51:05] at this definition of altar altar itself
[51:08] means to change or calls to change in
[51:11] character or composition typically in a
[51:14] comparatively small but significant way
[51:17] you know when you look at it I've been
[51:19] watching some different things upon this
[51:21] as I've been studying on for some time
[51:22] and you look at how that they'll even
[51:24] take certain things were they in a
[51:26] machining have taken the steel they've
[51:28] got everything to where they had had
[51:30] brought it to a certain place and then
[51:31] they stamp out an image of a of a knife
[51:33] and I was watching ones just on knives
[51:35] just that's one of those that I was
[51:37] looking at and you find that how that
[51:39] after they have taken it through a
[51:41] process of heating and cooling and
[51:44] heating and cooling and they're doing
[51:46] all of this because there are molecules
[51:49] in the way that the structure of things
[51:51] is within that particular steel that's
[51:54] there they want those to be aligned in a
[51:56] certain way there's a purpose that they
[51:58] have so they'll actually take them
[52:00] through even the temperatures that they
[52:03] allow they'll take them from a time
[52:05] where it is so hot and then all of a
[52:08] sudden they'll cool it down and then
[52:09] they'll put it in a deep freeze
[52:11] hey listen some of you and I have went
[52:14] from the fire we've cooled down and all
[52:16] of a sudden it feels like we've been in
[52:17] a deep freeze you feel like your prayers
[52:20] are not being answered you seemed like
[52:23] you hadn't felt God in a long time don't
[52:25] you're coming out of there his purpose
[52:29] was just to do what cool and get you
[52:31] ready for the purpose that he's serving
[52:33] in your life Laura he knows he's over at
[52:36] all will repeat oh god oh man I noticed
[52:41] this with hardness hardness and I'll
[52:43] just want to take these individually
[52:45] hardness itself is the quality or
[52:47] condition of being hard now we
[52:50] understand you know I think it's in the
[52:51] Word of God where Paul would tell
[52:53] Timothy endure hardness is that right
[52:57] he didn't say become hard he said endure
[52:59] it we can easily become hard but I'm so
[53:03] thankful that the Spirit of God can move
[53:05] over in renewal and remake us aren't you
[53:08] we could become hard and callous not
[53:11] even knowing it but yet the Spirit of
[53:13] God can come right by and tenderize us
[53:15] again aren't you glad for that but you
[53:18] see this hardness is not about so that
[53:20] we would become hard but it's to where
[53:23] that this hardness there is a certain
[53:25] level that they would need to take it to
[53:27] in order to resist mechanical
[53:30] indentations or abrasions that would be
[53:32] on the steel or there's iron alloy what
[53:35] it is that they're trying to get out of
[53:36] it the purpose will determine the
[53:38] hardness that it needs to be at so you
[53:41] understand when you look at somebody
[53:43] else and I may not have went through the
[53:45] exact trial that you went through and
[53:47] you haven't went through the trials the
[53:49] exact trial that I have went through
[53:50] that means nothing God has a purpose of
[53:53] what he's doing Paul told the church of
[53:56] the living god in Corinthians and
[53:57] Thessalonians
[53:58] on and on and on of how that the working
[54:00] of the Spirit of God the trying and all
[54:03] of those things come he said at the
[54:05] Apostles here and he's talking about how
[54:07] that God working in their life God
[54:09] worked in their life for a certain
[54:11] measure there are things of how God was
[54:13] working out in their life that was
[54:15] pertaining to them same way he works in
[54:18] you
[54:18] same way he works in me one thing about
[54:23] it the purpose that he's called us to it
[54:26] will come forth that's one thing for
[54:29] sure that Oh glory now in ductility
[54:36] when we're all gonna be pretty smart
[54:37] after this huh don't apply for you to
[54:42] agree though ductility to make pliable
[54:47] able to be drawn out like that of a wire
[54:52] so there's purposes there's need still
[54:56] for their iron alloys there's purposes
[54:58] and need for wire and those things I
[55:01] think of what it is it is it on the
[55:05] interstates right now whether they have
[55:07] replaced a lot of those in the medians
[55:11] right there and it was a young young man
[55:13] I think of the young man I don't know
[55:14] about 18 20 20 years old that designed
[55:16] all that where you have those the the
[55:19] steel or iron I don't know exactly what
[55:20] it is but you know how it has that
[55:21] little when you're driving down the road
[55:23] it looks like they're kind of sinking
[55:24] down to the grass and they have a little
[55:25] bit so that if there's an accident you
[55:27] know kind of catch and and so forth and
[55:29] it all of those things that had to be
[55:31] stretched all of those things had to
[55:33] have a certain ductility to it but yet
[55:35] that same thing has to have a certain
[55:37] toughness to it it can't you know it
[55:40] would be like just like a bungee cord
[55:41] right would where you go over any other
[55:44] Lane and then fly back see it can't do
[55:46] that
[55:46] well what determines how they've made it
[55:49] for the purpose its intended so this
[55:55] making Platteville in other words it can
[55:57] be shaped a toughness something that is
[55:59] strong enough to be able to withstand
[56:02] adverse conditions or rough or careless
[56:06] handling this ain't even about any about
[56:11] others handling us carelessly it's about
[56:14] us
[56:15] wearing sometimes that we've handled
[56:18] carelessly in our own lives of things
[56:22] but yet there's a toughness that though
[56:25] we may have handled things carelessly
[56:28] there's a toughness to be able to stand
[56:30] there who did this god it's better to
[56:36] say who's doing it God Christ in you and
[56:41] me the hope of glory strength the
[56:45] quality or state of being strong
[56:49] how maybe you'd like to write over a
[56:51] bridge where something's weak I said
[56:57] I'll tell you what I used to hate them
[56:58] wooden bridges in West Virginia we go we
[57:00] would go up the holler to visit
[57:01] everybody my uncle's they were driving
[57:03] them bridges British on them bridges
[57:05] they I know them bridges were they they
[57:06] were they were about you know from here
[57:08] to there then things looked about this
[57:10] wide though when we were riding in the
[57:12] car I could look out the door and I know
[57:14] I could see the creek you know what I
[57:16] didn't see anyone bridge you know they
[57:18] didn't have rails on them so you're
[57:20] going you went up the holler and you had
[57:22] to cross the creek everybody lived on a
[57:24] little place from the hill and across
[57:25] the creek right there I never liked
[57:27] those things at all but I know there was
[57:29] a certain certain level of support it's
[57:32] just the same way on bridges when they
[57:34] have built different bridges when I've
[57:35] studied on that here over the past days
[57:38] and things like that there are certain
[57:39] things that they have tested within
[57:41] those bridges and they have constructed
[57:43] them in a certain way the metal and
[57:45] everything else that they put in it and
[57:47] even what they are doing and the metal
[57:50] that is put in it is already determined
[57:53] for the purpose that it's going to serve
[57:56] I'm telling you right now that within
[57:58] your life the Holy Spirit in your life
[58:01] it is built within you to be able to
[58:05] stand as an anchor and I'm telling you
[58:07] within you you have within you the power
[58:09] to overcome you have within you the
[58:12] ability to surrender yourself and for
[58:15] Christ to shape and mold your life sure
[58:17] you don't see yourself the way you want
[58:19] to see yourself but remember God Himself
[58:22] is not working just looking at you he's
[58:25] working on your life by the vision that
[58:28] he already has so love you he doesn't
[58:31] see you necessarily as a work in
[58:33] progress although he is but he sees you
[58:36] and I as a finished product and that's
[58:38] why he can bring his word to you and I
[58:41] was such a strength and can bring his
[58:44] word with such a share it's why because
[58:47] his word cannot return back to him
[58:50] it cannot it will accomplish they many
[58:55] might have to women did the work and
[58:57] work and work and then test after test
[58:59] after test and trial after trial but it
[59:02] will bring forth what he has ordained
[59:05] and it will all be to his glory because
[59:10] you and I can say we can't say I yielded
[59:13] we say Lord thank you for helping me use
[59:15] you know what I needed glory
[59:24] tempering involves heating the metal to
[59:28] a precise temperature below the critical
[59:31] point and is often done in air vacuum or
[59:36] inert atmospheres that's all of these
[59:40] atmospheres where they just can't move
[59:43] this can't move I mean you know you've
[59:45] got a role before you the Red Sea at
[59:47] their back you just can't move you don't
[59:51] have no farting there's no other door
[59:53] there's not like a hey lean on that wall
[59:55] there will be an opening right there no
[59:58] those times when each and every one of
[1:00:01] us you face things on your job or you
[1:00:03] face things in other ways that you sit
[1:00:05] there and you look and you knew in five
[1:00:07] hours six hours I'm gonna have to get up
[1:00:09] and I'm gonna have to go and face it you
[1:00:11] are trusting the Lord but it still
[1:00:13] didn't mean that you enjoyed it or you
[1:00:15] liked it or you look forward to it but
[1:00:18] yet it was a time you're saying lord I
[1:00:19] need your strength again today Lord what
[1:00:22] help me in this situation I don't know
[1:00:24] how to approach this person Lord I don't
[1:00:26] know what to do in this situation Lord I
[1:00:28] need your strength help me Lord
[1:00:35] and he's hands-on he don't let you jump
[1:00:40] in the fire he puts you in it
[1:00:43] this tempering is not remotely like
[1:00:46] mechanical process and there's all of a
[1:00:49] sudden everything comes about and grabs
[1:00:51] joy up true and here joy let me go
[1:00:56] it picks him up and then it puts him
[1:00:57] down enough in the fire no no he's
[1:01:01] hands-on he's still old-school
[1:01:05] it's old-time religion it's old-school
[1:01:08] he still works on our act the same way
[1:01:11] he worked on the each and every one down
[1:01:13] through the ages he doesn't do it by
[1:01:16] mechanical Affairs he himself is present
[1:01:20] oh ma the temperature is adjusted
[1:01:30] depending on the amount of hardness that
[1:01:33] needs to be reduced so the temperature
[1:01:38] it's not everybody the same temperature
[1:01:39] the temperature depends on the amount of
[1:01:42] hardness what's hardness remember we're
[1:01:45] getting into a place to where that it's
[1:01:47] resilient not brittle that it's got to
[1:01:52] come for whatever the purpose is and how
[1:01:54] that God has such precision he knows how
[1:01:57] the Bible says what we're able to bear
[1:02:00] is that right he knows exactly where to
[1:02:04] bring you and I into that place to where
[1:02:07] that this hardness or this where we're
[1:02:10] actually able to take an impression and
[1:02:12] his life is continuing to move and in
[1:02:15] our lives being impressed as his life is
[1:02:18] moving through us and yet he also knows
[1:02:20] how to where our lives are not able to
[1:02:23] be abraded or abrasions of st. in that
[1:02:28] powerful God knows that he knows this
[1:02:32] hardness of what is needed in our lives
[1:02:36] he knows just how to heat it remember
[1:02:40] your tests and your trial was personally
[1:02:44] tailored
[1:02:46] just like mine is for me personally
[1:02:48] Taylor Taylor I can't give you my trial
[1:02:52] I can't give you my test I'll tell you
[1:02:55] this right here friends whether you
[1:02:56] believe it or not that over the years
[1:02:58] even even within pastoring if I could I
[1:03:00] would lift people's tests and trials and
[1:03:02] take them all on myself I don't say that
[1:03:04] for a hero it's just I don't like to see
[1:03:06] it I don't like to see in people when
[1:03:08] they're suffering and they're going
[1:03:09] through things but yet I realize if I
[1:03:12] were to sweep in and try to do if I
[1:03:14] could I would so mess up the program I
[1:03:19] would mess it up so so bad why because
[1:03:24] it's my human thinking of and my human
[1:03:27] compassion of it oh how we need our
[1:03:31] human compassion to be under the
[1:03:32] compassion of God oh my because remember
[1:03:38] human compassion with a hole healed
[1:03:41] everybody at the Pool of Bethesda but
[1:03:43] godly compassion excuse me pardon me
[1:03:45] excuse me pardon me pardon me why here
[1:03:47] was one person that's godly compassion
[1:03:54] notice he says it goes on while it
[1:03:58] varies depending on the metal type
[1:04:00] generally low temperatures will reduce
[1:04:04] brittleness while maintaining most of
[1:04:07] the hardness while higher temperatures
[1:04:10] reduce hardness which increases
[1:04:13] elasticity and plasticity but causes
[1:04:16] some yield and tensile strength to be
[1:04:19] lost so in other words what it comes
[1:04:22] down to is how to remove brittleness and
[1:04:24] yet make it so that it's easily able to
[1:04:28] be shaped but yet if it's deformed it
[1:04:31] won't stay in the deform state that's
[1:04:34] plasticity to be able to withstand
[1:04:37] deformity hook or repeat of God
[1:04:39] hallelujah now to think of how that even
[1:04:43] in our lives that things can come our
[1:04:45] way
[1:04:45] feelings can come our way other things
[1:04:47] can happen and even in the midst
[1:04:49] the tester trial that even our conduct
[1:04:52] is not superior I'll say Amen for all of
[1:04:55] you because within it then what is it
[1:04:59] even in the midst of it may be our
[1:05:01] attitude or our thinking or whatever is
[1:05:03] all out of sorts and out of life but yet
[1:05:05] God by His grace has so moved upon our
[1:05:08] life to prepare us even for that moment
[1:05:11] to where that even there is no deformity
[1:05:15] nothing can be retained he will bring us
[1:05:19] out of that glory be to God it is
[1:05:28] essential mine to heat the metal
[1:05:33] gradually I don't know about you but
[1:05:38] sometimes I've had tester trials and
[1:05:40] things are right on the dot they're
[1:05:42] coming right out at 2,000 degrees you
[1:05:45] have to then you've had others at me
[1:05:48] just who's trying to get hot it's
[1:05:54] gradual what is it it's about his
[1:05:58] purpose he knows what we need now I know
[1:06:05] in our flesh in our flesh we want to run
[1:06:10] from it a meshach Shadrach and Abednego
[1:06:14] we're not up there jump around say hey
[1:06:17] I'll go in the fiery furnace no but God
[1:06:24] was gonna make himself known in a
[1:06:26] greater way they didn't know that they
[1:06:30] were going to be delivered out of that
[1:06:33] fiery furnace but they did know we're
[1:06:35] gonna be delivered out of your hand
[1:06:37] one way or another they were standing on
[1:06:41] God's Word that furnace that they went
[1:06:47] into was not gradually heated when they
[1:06:49] went into it it was already heated seven
[1:06:53] times hotter whoa but in the hottest
[1:06:57] time that's when he made himself known
[1:06:59] to them like no other
[1:07:02] pareidolia
[1:07:04] oh my these are our promises this these
[1:07:07] are not print these are not battle
[1:07:09] stories they mend these are Testaments
[1:07:13] of Christ working in the lives of
[1:07:15] believers that you and I might receive
[1:07:17] comfort and patience from these
[1:07:19] scriptures they walked in their home i
[1:07:30] no doubt they had heard they heard God
[1:07:31] they prayed they talked to God they had
[1:07:33] a personal relationship with God but in
[1:07:37] there they walked in bound but in their
[1:07:42] the bands that was upon their life was
[1:07:45] loosed on their feet and on their hands
[1:07:49] they weren't able to do the things that
[1:07:51] they wanted to do they were not able to
[1:07:54] walk the way that they desired and
[1:07:57] wanted to walk but in that fiery furnace
[1:07:59] it moved away those bands now you
[1:08:04] explain this to me how did it burn the
[1:08:06] bands off of them didn't singe their
[1:08:08] clothes you tell me that the trials of
[1:08:12] God are not precise they are precise he
[1:08:18] knows exactly what he's doing when you
[1:08:20] can look at it over the times where I've
[1:08:22] been studying looking at this you can
[1:08:24] take how the arrangement would be in
[1:08:25] that metal but after it comes through
[1:08:28] the process of what it's designed to be
[1:08:30] and they're able to take a picture there
[1:08:32] and break it down of the structure of
[1:08:34] that material all of that was laying in
[1:08:38] it you understand what I'm saying the
[1:08:42] trial didn't put it in there the trial
[1:08:45] brought the arrangement of what was
[1:08:49] already there the trials not putting
[1:08:55] more in you
[1:08:56] the trial is bringing out of you what's
[1:08:59] already there
[1:09:00] Oh glory it's essential to heat the
[1:09:09] metal gradually to avoid the steel being
[1:09:13] cracked the metal has been held at this
[1:09:18] temperature for a fixed period how long
[1:09:21] well sometimes the trials are a day
[1:09:23] sometimes the trials are a week
[1:09:26] sometimes the trials are a month
[1:09:28] sometimes the trial is much longer
[1:09:34] sometimes there's been trials that we've
[1:09:37] go through that it isn't something that
[1:09:40] abruptly starts and abruptly stops
[1:09:44] sometimes there's things that continues
[1:09:46] its like residue lingers it keeps on
[1:09:52] lingering but yet God is faithful and
[1:09:56] bringing you through it it's a fixed
[1:09:59] period fixed period I've often said this
[1:10:03] many many times here in preaching a
[1:10:05] message even years and years ago of how
[1:10:08] that you take Paul and Paul could look
[1:10:10] at the Ministry of the Lord Jesus Paul
[1:10:12] himself was not there apart as far as
[1:10:14] walking with Him in his earthly ministry
[1:10:16] but Paul was privileged by divine
[1:10:19] revelation to understand the anchor that
[1:10:21] was within that life of what stood the
[1:10:24] test and all of the temptu trials and
[1:10:27] everything that he went through because
[1:10:29] Paul could ride it that he suffered he
[1:10:32] was tempted in all points such as we are
[1:10:35] yet without sin Paul could write of this
[1:10:39] of this of this greatness of this
[1:10:41] sacrifice our a blessed Redeemer
[1:10:43] becoming one of us and facing literally
[1:10:47] facing the very things that you and I
[1:10:50] would face yet without sin but then you
[1:10:53] take Peter and Peter who was right there
[1:10:55] Peter could right there in the book of
[1:10:58] Peter and he would write about but this
[1:11:00] beard being pulled from his face Peter
[1:11:01] would write about you know the treatment
[1:11:03] that he received
[1:11:04] Peter saw that but yet within both of it
[1:11:07] for both of them what was the the
[1:11:09] reality with
[1:11:11] is that the anchor itself held the life
[1:11:15] held the life it stayed steadfast in the
[1:11:19] midst of it so waiting until the residue
[1:11:26] of the trial is over to schedule to give
[1:11:29] a testimony
[1:11:30] oh you're forfeiting times of victory
[1:11:33] victory is not when we come out of the
[1:11:36] trial we have victory during the trial
[1:11:40] are you with me that's God's desire
[1:11:43] that's God's desire he supplies to us he
[1:11:47] has given to us of his victory we are
[1:11:50] his victory both say no I don't know
[1:11:56] about that what is that doing
[1:11:57] that's testifying of the light and
[1:12:00] faithfulness of God who dwells within
[1:12:02] you I don't know how he's gonna do it
[1:12:05] but he's bringing me through he's
[1:12:06] wonderful he's wonderful
[1:12:09] I don't know how he's gonna bring this
[1:12:11] all out work all this out but I know
[1:12:12] he's gonna do it
[1:12:13] as a matter of fact not gonna let me
[1:12:16] declare it right so he's able to stand
[1:12:18] as a high priest for what I'm confession
[1:12:20] because he's not the high priest of
[1:12:21] Ghana he's the high priest he is glory a
[1:12:27] fixed period in that amazing sometimes
[1:12:33] that people can look at other people I'm
[1:12:35] just filming that's not I want to talk
[1:12:37] about anybody else out there they're in
[1:12:39] animation you can look at this person in
[1:12:41] that person you could look at things and
[1:12:42] this person talks about their job and
[1:12:44] this person talks about their job and it
[1:12:46] amazing how you could look at something
[1:12:47] and there could be a tendency within the
[1:12:49] human Humanity part of it to think well
[1:12:52] I could do that I mean I mean you work
[1:12:58] in an office go hide in the cubicle you
[1:13:02] understand what I'm saying there's
[1:13:04] things that sometimes we look at things
[1:13:06] like that's just simple you just do this
[1:13:09] you see what the problem is you're too
[1:13:12] ascended you need to convince it
[1:13:15] you see this isn't like the precedent
[1:13:17] who walks into steel mill with his great
[1:13:20] suit from China and he walks in and hats
[1:13:22] on his hat and boy he's waiting to see
[1:13:24] how the steel workers are doing that guy
[1:13:26] in planning to get dirty he knows when
[1:13:29] he leaves there he's got steak and
[1:13:30] lobster and everything else waiting on
[1:13:32] him he know that he does not have to
[1:13:34] worry and contend about the heat and
[1:13:37] worried about do i duck when the steel
[1:13:38] beams flying over he don't have to worry
[1:13:40] about that so it's easy to make policy
[1:13:44] about things you don't know
[1:13:46] no this isn't a political convention
[1:13:49] this is a convention of the delegates of
[1:13:51] heaven it's easy you know like they say
[1:13:56] boots on the ground
[1:13:57] if boots have been on the ground and
[1:13:59] you've done what you're doing then
[1:14:01] they'll know certain policies don't work
[1:14:03] those of you that know that work even in
[1:14:06] the nursing home and things like that
[1:14:07] you know they want you to be able to do
[1:14:10] everything you know hey you guys can
[1:14:11] take care of one person the whole wing
[1:14:13] at ain't nothing to it just you know
[1:14:15] just spit the pills down to them catch
[1:14:17] the peel down there you see the types of
[1:14:19] things that take place there's no look
[1:14:23] at it it's that without any feeling
[1:14:25] within it oh god that's even another
[1:14:28] part of tests and trials that sometimes
[1:14:31] we get too big for our own britches and
[1:14:34] God has to reduce us down to a place to
[1:14:37] say wait a minute go poke your hole in a
[1:14:41] bucket of water and see if the whole
[1:14:43] stage there and just find out how big
[1:14:46] you are it's easy to look at somebody
[1:14:51] else's life and somebody else what
[1:14:53] they're going through and say that's
[1:14:54] easy buddy
[1:14:55] suck it up it's easy to do that but that
[1:14:59] is not the way of our Lord I'm talking
[1:15:02] about character I'm talking about
[1:15:04] condescension when those types of things
[1:15:08] happen you're proving a hardness that's
[1:15:10] brittle it's very damaging to the body
[1:15:19] let's let's let's look at the word here
[1:15:22] just a moment while we're on this when
[1:15:24] one member suffers
[1:15:26] we all suffer when one member rejoices
[1:15:31] we all rejoice unless you're not part of
[1:15:34] the body that comes with being part of
[1:15:39] the body when somebody comes over and
[1:15:41] steps on my foot
[1:15:42] guess who says I'll not my big toe
[1:15:46] my mouth says out how does my mouth say
[1:15:50] out because I have nerve endings in the
[1:15:52] bottom right there in my time it travels
[1:15:56] up to my brain notice all these systems
[1:15:58] working together it travels up to my
[1:16:00] brain and my brain sends out a response
[1:16:04] comes right out why I'm part of this my
[1:16:07] mouth brain the nervous system all of
[1:16:10] that is part however if I have my foot
[1:16:14] and my foots out here you could jump up
[1:16:15] and down on it all day if I had just had
[1:16:20] a prosthesis you could jump up and down
[1:16:21] on my foot all day you know why I'm just
[1:16:24] artificially connected come on somebody
[1:16:27] you see this is part God allows tests
[1:16:30] and trials why we are not to be
[1:16:32] artificially connected as believers we
[1:16:37] need one another as well preach whether
[1:16:44] we're on it a rough guideline nun
[1:16:47] noticed this a fixed period of time a
[1:16:49] rough guideline is one hour per inch of
[1:16:53] thickness who well it just depends on
[1:16:59] what he's trying to get done sometimes
[1:17:03] our thickness we're thick in certain
[1:17:06] places God says this needs to be
[1:17:15] a little thick in that area I want you
[1:17:18] to think of this I've heard the Prophet
[1:17:20] here today just saying with Joseph well
[1:17:24] Joseph being down in Egypt and as he was
[1:17:26] mentioning these things and the message
[1:17:28] three kinds of believers and I thought
[1:17:29] back even to the message Paul a prisoner
[1:17:31] of Jesus Christ brother Graham talks
[1:17:33] about how that he said Joseph here he
[1:17:35] was a believer he believed in the vision
[1:17:37] of what God had given him to wear that
[1:17:40] the sheaves were going to bow down
[1:17:42] before him he knew God had given him
[1:17:43] that vision but yet now once you look at
[1:17:46] this now even though that Joseph he was
[1:17:49] ordained for that and that purpose was
[1:17:52] in his life that was to be served but
[1:17:55] yet he still had to go through
[1:17:58] everything in Egypt and the Prophet says
[1:18:02] it like this in prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:18:04] what it was he said it was a little bit
[1:18:06] too much pride that was there see God
[1:18:12] picks up not great conglomerations he's
[1:18:16] able to look into the structure and say
[1:18:17] ooh that molecule and those things
[1:18:20] aren't aligning just right that that's
[1:18:22] not gonna serve that's not what I wanted
[1:18:24] for so what do we need we need a little
[1:18:26] bit more eat right now and then we'll
[1:18:30] let him cook what should we do should we
[1:18:31] put him right in the bucket right away
[1:18:32] no they need to just air cool on this
[1:18:35] one this isn't a gradual start and stop
[1:18:38] trial this is gradual you see there's
[1:18:43] other times where they'll stick this
[1:18:45] this steel this iron though they'll put
[1:18:48] it and what they'll do when they heat it
[1:18:50] to a critical point there's certain
[1:18:51] things that they're looking for and what
[1:18:53] they'll do is they'll touch it on a
[1:18:54] magnet because they want it they don't
[1:18:57] want to cool it so quickly that it loses
[1:19:01] the properties of magnetism everything
[1:19:06] is so precisely and God knows exactly
[1:19:13] what he's doing
[1:19:18] the thing that I thought that I can just
[1:19:20] say for me is Lord it's right here you
[1:19:26] know what you're doing and what it is
[1:19:27] that you desire to bring out of my life
[1:19:30] my burden yes it's for the whole body
[1:19:32] pray for the whole body but I cannot
[1:19:35] perform in you neither can you performed
[1:19:37] in me what is already there
[1:19:40] God must bring it out let me just finish
[1:19:45] this and we'll close a rough guideline
[1:19:50] is one hour per inch of thickness during
[1:19:52] this time the internal stresses in the
[1:19:57] middle are relieved and that's remember
[1:20:02] during one time this time of heating so
[1:20:10] the time of heating the internal
[1:20:12] stresses are relieved I think I'm
[1:20:17] starting to understand though the
[1:20:20] outward man perish the inward man is
[1:20:24] renewed I think I'm starting to see the
[1:20:32] metal is then cooled in still air you're
[1:20:37] loving
[1:20:46] let me read you just a couple scriptures
[1:20:51] notice how Peter places it I mean I may
[1:20:54] just kind of skip over just a little bit
[1:20:57] in verse 6 of first Peter 1 speaking of
[1:21:00] wearing you greatly rejoice we've kept
[1:21:03] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:21:05] salvation and verse 5 ready to be
[1:21:06] reviewed on the last time worrying you
[1:21:08] greatly rejoice where is our rejoicing
[1:21:10] that we are part of his coming there's a
[1:21:14] lot of everything else that looks bleak
[1:21:15] dismal and dark but the light as a rose
[1:21:21] our rejoicing is is that we know our
[1:21:25] salvation is nearer our deliverance
[1:21:31] isn't here though now for a season if
[1:21:38] need be who determines if we need be you
[1:21:41] know so it's it's not having a sign-up
[1:21:44] sheet for trials because none of us
[1:21:48] would do that nobody would do that
[1:21:53] voluntarily willingly go in the fire no
[1:21:56] because we don't even know we don't even
[1:21:59] see these needs in our life it's not us
[1:22:01] telling God God you know what I need
[1:22:03] more of this so put me over there who
[1:22:08] God says it's hardness just thing you're
[1:22:20] right this is telling me who art thou
[1:22:24] clay to tell the Potter who have formed
[1:22:27] thee how to form yeah well or do you
[1:22:31] know exactly no no it's just the measure
[1:22:35] the fixed period of time just even the
[1:22:37] temperature and we are placed there if
[1:22:40] need be you are in what's that word
[1:22:47] heaviness sorrowful now wait a minute I
[1:22:53] mean the me understand this I'm to
[1:22:55] conduct myself with joy admits my trials
[1:22:58] count it all joy right rejoice greatly
[1:23:03] but yet I'm pleased and you
[1:23:06] replaced if need be ye are in heaviness
[1:23:09] through manifold sorrows oh but I think
[1:23:13] there's something that we have to
[1:23:14] understand this is not sorrow in without
[1:23:16] hope this is not solving with I don't
[1:23:19] know what's going on I don't know
[1:23:21] it's sorrowing but out of this sorrow is
[1:23:25] gonna come forth growth we have a
[1:23:30] direction to know that's why that's why
[1:23:32] there's no contradiction in the word we
[1:23:34] glory in tribulations and yet here it
[1:23:38] says you're in heaviness greatly sad and
[1:23:42] sorrowful through variegated various
[1:23:45] testings and trying's well what
[1:23:50] variegation will have what form what
[1:23:52] color it depends on what he sees needs
[1:23:54] be verse 7 that the trial of your faith
[1:24:00] being much more precious than of gold
[1:24:05] that perisheth the trial the trial is
[1:24:12] what it's more precious than gold it's
[1:24:15] more sweeter than gold what kind of gold
[1:24:18] the gold that perishes because the trial
[1:24:20] itself does not produce perishing Gold
[1:24:22] in our lives it brings forth the gold of
[1:24:24] his christ-like character so the trial
[1:24:27] is more precious than gold who would
[1:24:31] trade gold for a trial
[1:24:39] we don't see that to be any we could
[1:24:41] look at that I don't see that to be
[1:24:43] equal at all but God's letting us know
[1:24:45] that our trial it's more precious
[1:24:51] because look gold itself can buy a lot
[1:24:54] of things gold itself can get you access
[1:24:57] to a lot of things is that right but yet
[1:25:02] it comes to an end it has a limitation
[1:25:06] but the trial is forming in us bringing
[1:25:11] forth that gold Christ's like character
[1:25:15] from our lives that is to be raptured
[1:25:20] he's doing it he's not giving it to us
[1:25:23] he's molding us
[1:25:32] though it'd be tried with fire might be
[1:25:40] found unto praise and honour and glory
[1:25:43] at the appearing of Jesus Christ this
[1:25:49] scripture very clearly declares how long
[1:25:52] the tests how long the trials how long
[1:25:55] must we go through how long must there
[1:25:58] be sufferings and times and things we
[1:26:00] come into how long until until until the
[1:26:05] finally it's ready to go into the mold
[1:26:09] what mold well we know the material is
[1:26:13] that christ-like character but what mold
[1:26:15] the body that he has prepared for us it
[1:26:21] must be shaped just listen to me
[1:26:23] just as the pyramid City is a pyramid
[1:26:26] you and I in our lives the ages are a
[1:26:29] pyramid the bride right the entirety of
[1:26:32] a bride and you and I as individuals are
[1:26:36] to be pyramids reflections are there
[1:26:40] going into that city it's not handed to
[1:26:43] us but as the Prophet tells us he said
[1:26:46] you must first be born again and when
[1:26:49] you are born again then all of those
[1:26:51] virtues come forth coming from our life
[1:26:55] otherwise we know it's peacock it's
[1:27:00] black bird trying to add peacock
[1:27:01] feathers so what must it be the divine
[1:27:04] nature on the inside and he brings us to
[1:27:07] what a crowning moment the achievement
[1:27:11] you know I just heard brother Brennan
[1:27:12] say today you know you hear about
[1:27:14] brother brand when your brother brand
[1:27:15] speaks to us in the church age book and
[1:27:17] he talks about how that the Lord Jesus
[1:27:18] Christ was his crowning achievement he
[1:27:21] talks about that in Christ the mystery
[1:27:22] of God revealed and then as I heard the
[1:27:24] Prophet say today I just just astounded
[1:27:26] me when he makes the statement and three
[1:27:28] kinds of believer he said God's greatest
[1:27:30] achievement is for a person to believe
[1:27:33] the greatest achievement why God does
[1:27:37] what he does is that we might believe
[1:27:41] you see there's things that God asked of
[1:27:44] you and I to be
[1:27:45] to trust him even earlier and there's
[1:27:48] things that he asked us even now to
[1:27:51] believe and to trust him and to know
[1:27:52] that I don't have to say Lord take me
[1:27:58] out of the heat right now Lord no he
[1:28:01] knows what we can say is Lord would you
[1:28:04] just give me grace right now maybe send
[1:28:08] down the Angels to fan a little bit
[1:28:10] because this test or this trial is quite
[1:28:13] a bit and he knows he knows when the
[1:28:19] tester trial is over there's angels
[1:28:22] Elijah there's angels to minister to you
[1:28:26] angels came and ministered to Elijah
[1:28:29] when he came out of that is that right
[1:28:32] what did they tell him rise when the
[1:28:37] Lord Jesus came down from the temptation
[1:28:39] there in Matthew 4 what did the Bible
[1:28:41] say angels ministered unto them at the
[1:28:47] end before going to Calvary before
[1:28:50] Pilate saw at the end angels came and
[1:28:57] ministered to you might be here tonight
[1:29:02] you you might be at that point where
[1:29:04] angels themselves maybe they are
[1:29:09] ministering to you you know sometimes
[1:29:11] you there's things that we go through
[1:29:12] with tests and trials and there's
[1:29:14] different things that we might feel like
[1:29:16] we've lost a little something but when
[1:29:18] we've gone through a test or trial God
[1:29:22] has brought us through it isn't of the
[1:29:25] Lord that we've lost we might have lost
[1:29:27] the thing that we've lost is more of
[1:29:30] what we needed to lose
[1:29:34] more of ourselves now the truth of the
[1:29:37] matter is we all speak up don't we Lord
[1:29:40] I want more of you I want more of you
[1:29:42] but it'd be like this room right here if
[1:29:45] this room was filled up with boxes all
[1:29:47] the way to the ceiling and you say I
[1:29:49] want more I want more he says well where
[1:29:52] am I gonna put but you see within our
[1:29:58] lives it's worth God by His grace the
[1:30:02] character being molded and formed what's
[1:30:05] it doing it's spreading out it's
[1:30:08] spreading out where one time your
[1:30:12] patient starts like this and he grows
[1:30:16] your temperance starts like this and
[1:30:19] then it grows all of those virtues are
[1:30:24] in you not nature given there can be
[1:30:28] people there naturally given the bent
[1:30:30] l's he said that's the problem with the
[1:30:31] tabernacle now there's two different
[1:30:33] kinds of faith but that water the Holy
[1:30:36] Ghost must make its way down to the
[1:30:38] foundation what did he cloth call that
[1:30:41] the new birth being born again and then
[1:30:45] from there the life you begin to grow
[1:30:47] begin to grow so Lord what must I do
[1:30:50] just keep surrendering to him he brings
[1:30:53] out every one of those virtues in our
[1:30:56] life and it's not where we're going by
[1:30:58] checklist check of manifested patience
[1:31:01] check temperance check virtue know it's
[1:31:05] ongoing
[1:31:06] it's called maturing tribulation worketh
[1:31:12] work works out brings forth patience I
[1:31:18] didn't get to it tonight but brother Ram
[1:31:20] tells us clearly he says a matter of
[1:31:22] fact he said there's no other way for
[1:31:23] you to have patience then by your faith
[1:31:26] being tried
[1:31:27] I thought patience was already in me it
[1:31:30] is the trial doesn't add anything to you
[1:31:34] the trial brings forth what's already
[1:31:36] there but it takes the trial
[1:31:42] to bring it forth say Lord just help me
[1:31:46] to stand still help me just to stand
[1:31:50] still Lord to be molded to trust you see
[1:31:54] the part of the trial is to trust him he
[1:31:57] knows what he's doing he knows the
[1:31:58] degree of the temperature he knows just
[1:32:00] the cooling process he know you know I'm
[1:32:05] glad aren't you and if he knows this is
[1:32:08] where our our trust must come our trust
[1:32:11] sale or my life it's not just a song I
[1:32:20] think of it our paths have crossed look
[1:32:24] at our paths across but who's to say
[1:32:28] that your path may not always be here
[1:32:31] mr. Smith who's to say that our paths
[1:32:34] were not always I'm not talking about
[1:32:36] leaving the Lord you understand god
[1:32:39] knows what he's doing in our lives
[1:32:41] he knows how he's preparing us in
[1:32:44] shaping us sometimes God will mold and
[1:32:47] make look if God took that long to mold
[1:32:49] and make John for six months of service
[1:32:56] six months of service who was the one
[1:32:59] putting in all the work God the Lord put
[1:33:04] in all the work for just a moment's
[1:33:07] worth of service think about the woman
[1:33:10] who cleaned out that barn nobody knows
[1:33:14] her name nobody knows her name but she
[1:33:18] felt on her heart to go clear out that
[1:33:20] barn and have a meeting there you say
[1:33:25] well brother Samuel cleaning ain't much
[1:33:26] I've tried it I might be a clean fanatic
[1:33:30] and a clean nut but you know what I get
[1:33:33] tired when you come to wiping down the
[1:33:34] baseboards and everything else and
[1:33:35] cleaning all that stuff your back hurts
[1:33:38] and everything else hurts no wonder you
[1:33:40] want to go out to eat afterwards
[1:33:43] sorry for setting you up brothers but
[1:33:45] you know cleanin ain't easy I mean to
[1:33:49] think about it you know I remember when
[1:33:52] I was in the college dorm you we every
[1:33:53] Friday man I told my roommate that I had
[1:33:55] I was in Friday mornings when I get back
[1:33:57] from morning class it's clean time I
[1:33:59] don't want dust bunnies all over this
[1:34:01] floor I don't want to moving all around
[1:34:03] I want this place cleaned up we're gonna
[1:34:05] clean it I'm helping you but you know
[1:34:08] how it is when you have that hard floor
[1:34:10] like that you know those floors that
[1:34:11] they have like at school cafeterias it's
[1:34:14] so hard to clean them things and keep
[1:34:16] them clean it just looks like they
[1:34:17] manufacture dust bunnies and all these
[1:34:19] other things and to think about how this
[1:34:21] woman came in there and she cleaned that
[1:34:24] place she took that a burden upon her
[1:34:27] heart from the Lord you know what she
[1:34:29] cleaned that place as if the Lord
[1:34:31] Himself was coming and he did come he
[1:34:34] did come to think of it how God prepared
[1:34:39] her you said brother Samuel what does
[1:34:40] that have to do with the tester trial
[1:34:42] for her to be yielded and sensitive
[1:34:44] enough for God to speak to her on
[1:34:46] something that she would not overlook
[1:34:48] and say what could that be God prepares
[1:34:52] he knows what he's doing
[1:34:54] sound up to me to figure that out it's
[1:34:56] just up to me to submit to it he knows
[1:34:58] what he's doing I should go ahead
[1:35:09] I'm so glad Lord you have it in control
[1:35:18] but what I'm more grateful for what what
[1:35:21] causes me to rejoice is to have that
[1:35:25] trust
[1:35:29] nor Jesus
[1:35:32] we never know we never know Lord test or
[1:35:37] trial or water rises we never know we
[1:35:39] never know Lord they angle that it's
[1:35:41] going to come we never know that
[1:35:48] Lord Jesus our confidence Lord using you
[1:35:54] as Paul could say to trust in ourselves
[1:35:57] was the sentence of death
[1:36:00] we are not trusting in ourselves not in
[1:36:04] our flesh but we are trusting in you
[1:36:08] that's our comfort Lord is in you
[1:36:12] I think of how the Prophet would speak
[1:36:14] of it in the message the comforter he
[1:36:17] said job was a man at all that he you
[1:36:20] had spoke to him about a burnt offering
[1:36:23] of offering up the burnt offering he
[1:36:25] said that's all that job had not making
[1:36:28] light of it but that's what was made
[1:36:30] known to him and Joe stood on what you
[1:36:35] had made known was the accepted way so
[1:36:41] in all of the test all was coming he
[1:36:46] knew where he was standing with you
[1:36:50] but it was through the tests to trial
[1:36:53] where job needed direction
[1:36:57] we've seen that Lord mentioned that Lord
[1:36:59] many times I'm so thankful that Lord God
[1:37:02] that you've never chose to hide the
[1:37:06] humanity of man Lord that's never
[1:37:09] bothered me as a matter of fact I can
[1:37:11] relate to it I'm so I'm so thankful that
[1:37:15] you didn't hide these things in the
[1:37:17] scriptures Lord and cover over the
[1:37:19] humanity I'm glad even in our day that
[1:37:21] you did not have the humanity of our
[1:37:23] prophet you allowed it things Lord to
[1:37:26] even be caught and recorded on tape even
[1:37:28] things that he would express of his own
[1:37:30] life of things that he himself was
[1:37:31] dealing with you allowed that and we can
[1:37:35] see those things Lord we can watch the
[1:37:38] Lord how alive our son of God with Lord
[1:37:41] move and coming into that maturity Lord
[1:37:45] how we thank you so much it gives us
[1:37:47] great hope Lloyd because we know that
[1:37:52] you are the same God and this word Lord
[1:37:56] God we are under yes maturing us Lord
[1:38:02] it's sheathing us it's molding us Lord
[1:38:06] perhaps right now there's things that
[1:38:07] you can are working Lord in each of our
[1:38:09] lives I believe that with all my heart
[1:38:11] Lord then Lord how our character Lord
[1:38:14] being molded Lord through trials we come
[1:38:19] and how we rejoice Lord in the
[1:38:21] ministering of the word and Lord as we
[1:38:23] feed upon your word but we realize Lord
[1:38:25] that the word itself is that we might
[1:38:27] have a direction and we have a faith
[1:38:29] within that word that you will lead and
[1:38:31] guide us all the way through the
[1:38:33] Scriptures tell us Lord Paul would be
[1:38:35] quick to tell the Corinthians and the
[1:38:38] Romans and different ones he would be
[1:38:39] quick to tell them that the examples and
[1:38:41] that we also ought to receive comfort
[1:38:44] and patience from the scriptures
[1:38:51] but how thankful we are that these are
[1:38:53] included for us it comforts us when we
[1:38:57] see of these things Lord God that our
[1:38:59] brethren our sisters glowing through
[1:39:04] trials as Hebrews 11 would call it
[1:39:07] trials of cruel mockings the Lord God
[1:39:11] how that you've brought forth from each
[1:39:15] of their lives just what it is that you
[1:39:18] purpose this is our confidence Lloyd
[1:39:25] help us sword many times the Lord God
[1:39:31] it's not a problem of being strong we're
[1:39:35] too strong too
[1:39:39] I think of how your profit in the
[1:39:41] message perfect strength three times
[1:39:43] three times he mentions for his own life
[1:39:47] I'm too strong I'm too strong I'm too
[1:39:51] strong for what God is calling for me to
[1:39:55] do
[1:39:56] Lord Jesus I thank you for that Lord
[1:40:01] that's the same thing Lord God that I
[1:40:05] can say from my life I'm too strong
[1:40:08] works was strong Lord
[1:40:11] but father you know you know if need be
[1:40:15] you know just what we need lord help us
[1:40:19] lord help us Lord enough to complain
[1:40:23] forgive us when we have complained Lord
[1:40:27] there's a part of that humanity Lord
[1:40:31] it might start out complaining but all
[1:40:33] of a sudden maybe a thought that will
[1:40:35] come and we will redirect it and begin
[1:40:39] to take in of that word and say but yet
[1:40:43] the Lord is on my side the Lord is my
[1:40:47] health
[1:40:49] Lord God you're bringing me through this
[1:40:54] when I come out of this Lord I won't be
[1:40:56] weaker as far as spiritually I'm gonna
[1:41:00] be stronger weaker naturally in my
[1:41:05] natural man I need to be weaker there
[1:41:07] but to be stronger in you help us Lord
[1:41:12] the wonder Paul when he caught that
[1:41:14] inspiration and it struck his heart and
[1:41:17] he realized what a blessing a blessing
[1:41:20] not but there that event of his eyes
[1:41:22] that he was glorying in his eyes being
[1:41:24] awful but Paul recognized that that
[1:41:26] coming and going in that trying and
[1:41:28] testing he realized that in the midst of
[1:41:31] it
[1:41:31] he was molding him it was making him it
[1:41:35] was keeping Paul in a place to where you
[1:41:37] could speak to him and using Lord God
[1:41:41] help us lord help us Lord Jesus that we
[1:41:45] remain in a place where you can speak to
[1:41:47] us and use a sword for your glory Lord
[1:41:53] we give ourselves to you Father for
[1:41:56] every need in every life that's here
[1:41:58] tonight you've gone for every need for
[1:42:01] every unspoken request the Lord for each
[1:42:03] part I'll pray father in the name of
[1:42:06] Jesus Christ that you would just touch
[1:42:09] them
[1:42:10] strengthen them in the midst of this
[1:42:12] time Lord maybe it's hot right now it's
[1:42:15] getting hotter but lord I pray that may
[1:42:18] the angels of God knowing that they're
[1:42:21] standing at attention
[1:42:24] lord give us the grease give us the
[1:42:29] grace to be able to go through but yous
