[26:11] just to rest as you said where two or

[26:53] Christ god bless you we certainly want
[27:02] to say some greetings to each of you we
[27:05] miss you and certainly just can't wait
[27:08] for the opportunity as it would allow
[27:11] for us to be able to start together back
[27:14] together again and we want to just turn
[27:19] our attention and our hearts to the word
[27:22] of the Lord tonight and just to see what
[27:25] the Lord would would have for us I
[27:27] believe that God knows what our needs
[27:29] are and so tonight as we would just
[27:32] begin to look into the word of the Lord
[27:34] I want to go back into begin into a few
[27:37] places that we were in last Thursday
[27:41] in looking at how where Paul is is
[27:45] expressing here in Philemon chapter one
[27:48] and verse one and Paul would write and I
[27:52] just want to read the first phrase of
[27:54] that Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ and
[27:59] then in acts 28 16
[28:03] this is where it records when they had
[28:07] arrived to Rome
[28:09] and when we came to Rome the Centurion
[28:12] delivered the prisoners to the captain
[28:15] of the guard but Paul was suffered to
[28:18] dwell by himself with a soldier that
[28:21] kept him then in verse 30 and Paul dwelt
[28:25] two whole years in his own hired house
[28:28] and received all that came in unto him
[28:32] preaching the kingdom of God and
[28:34] teaching those things which concern the
[28:38] Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence no
[28:42] man forbidding him amen may God bless
[28:46] you bless the reading of the word as you
[28:49] would have your seats I want to continue
[28:52] to look at this thought on a prisoner of
[28:57] Jesus Christ and when we think of this
[29:04] thought of it we recognize that where
[29:08] Paul is at and what Paul is speaking of
[29:11] when he would write this even in that
[29:14] personal letter to Philemon regarding
[29:18] uneasiness Paul would also have the same
[29:21] riding and declaration in the book of
[29:25] Ephesians which Ephesians was also a
[29:28] prison epistle one that Paul wrote while
[29:31] in prison in this time same with the
[29:34] book of Philippians the same with the
[29:36] book of Colossians same with that and
[29:38] within Timothy and you find that with
[29:41] within this that Paul had experienced
[29:45] being in prison already three other
[29:48] times he wrote of that in 2nd
[29:51] Corinthians when there were men who had
[29:54] come in among the Church of the Living
[29:56] God which it was known that there would
[29:59] be men that would come in those that
[30:02] were not really fully converted but they
[30:05] came in and they weren't lazy Paul
[30:07] called him workers but he said they were
[30:09] deceitful workers they had other
[30:12] intentions in mind he would say in
[30:14] another place their Grievous wolves they
[30:17] did not have the mind of the flock or
[30:20] the kingdom of God in in there
[30:23] and we we see that within this of how
[30:28] that these as it would be laid out
[30:31] within these times and Paul would write
[30:33] of this a prisoner of Jesus Christ even
[30:37] even though Paul himself was here in
[30:42] Rome and he was awaiting the the trial
[30:46] the court appearance just like if
[30:49] somebody you know today if you were to
[30:52] have a court appearance and you know
[30:54] there is a time that they give you and
[30:56] say well possibly by this time and you
[30:59] know you've seen things where there's
[31:01] been judges around us here in these
[31:04] localities where sometimes they've
[31:06] actually lost their job by voting
[31:09] because maybe they haven't moved the
[31:11] docket or the cases that have just
[31:14] started to pile up and we find that this
[31:17] here was a situation that Paul did not
[31:20] know how long that this was going to be
[31:22] it was not something very simply that
[31:24] you know his Paul had been transferred
[31:27] from Agrippa to Felix and these things
[31:29] you know he just went from one to the
[31:31] other and it wasn't like a day in
[31:33] between there was a little space of time
[31:35] but there was nothing like this right
[31:38] here where Paul was in a place of just
[31:40] waiting and he was waiting for that
[31:44] appeal that he had made unto Caesar and
[31:47] the very thing that what is so pressed
[31:49] upon my heart as the Lord was just just
[31:51] some weeks ago just pressing and looking
[31:54] at this is to see how that within the
[31:57] midst of this circumstance how the Holy
[32:00] Spirit so dealt with Paul's life in the
[32:03] writing of these prison epistles that it
[32:05] is so much within these that it so
[32:09] captures the very nature and the
[32:12] character and expression of Jesus Christ
[32:15] it so captures that it so captures the
[32:18] the capping of it and here Paul is
[32:21] waiting and you know there are things
[32:23] that I think within this that we can
[32:26] take such a lesson from this where it
[32:30] says Paul was waiting in that rented
[32:32] house and like we looked at it last week
[32:34] Paul himself was there
[32:36] and there was a soldier that was was
[32:39] keeping him the whole time these
[32:41] soldiers were actually some of the elite
[32:44] guard within that of Rome and Paul was
[32:48] considered though he was not a mal
[32:49] factor though there were things that
[32:52] Paul had not seemingly according to even
[32:56] the one that had placed him in this kind
[32:58] of a custody as though Paul was of a of
[33:00] a serious threat like has that of a
[33:03] malefactor as I said but yet it was
[33:05] enough to where Paul himself built the
[33:08] others going in common prison Paul would
[33:11] be kept here in his own hired house and
[33:14] with that of of a soldier where they
[33:18] were changed every four hours so you
[33:22] know within it there was not much as far
[33:25] as you could see within paul's of life
[33:27] that it would be a very personal it
[33:30] would be he would not be one who would
[33:32] be left to himself every four hours they
[33:35] were being changed out but these are
[33:37] things that I believe that we can look
[33:40] at that you know Paul's time in Rome was
[33:44] not a waste God never in the mid just
[33:48] say it like this god never wastes our
[33:51] time though we may waste it because we
[33:55] don't sense God's purpose for our life
[33:57] at the moment and this is something that
[34:01] I I just it's just to see that the will
[34:05] of God is is is so great and I believe
[34:09] for every heart and every life of which
[34:12] God's will is revealed and has been
[34:16] revealed it is such a precious thing
[34:18] that God would reveal his will even for
[34:21] a heart to come into repentance even for
[34:25] in sanctification that those are things
[34:27] that even with sanctification Paul would
[34:30] say these things every man ought to know
[34:32] how to possess his vessel unto
[34:34] sanctification for this is the will of
[34:36] God these are things that are before us
[34:39] it's such a value to a heart to a life
[34:43] that the will of God is such a value it
[34:46] means more than anything of this life
[34:50] it's things that when walking in God's
[34:52] will many can look at a life and say I
[34:56] don't know if I'd make that decision
[34:57] I don't know if I'd go that route why
[34:59] did you choose this or why did you do
[35:01] that but we recognize that the desire
[35:04] that we have in our heart is for the
[35:07] will of God and we recognize that within
[35:10] that we need his leadership even to
[35:13] prepare us for that moment for the next
[35:17] step for the next Junction we are
[35:19] resting in him that he would prepare us
[35:22] that we would have a willingness to be
[35:25] able to surrender to his will because
[35:29] here we find where Paul is writing and
[35:33] if I may just refer to this here in the
[35:36] book of Romans chapter 1 Paul has wrote
[35:39] to the Romans now this is years before
[35:41] Paul would ever get there
[35:44] it's well years before this letter is
[35:47] wrote and Paul would write this
[35:49] testimony and say for God is my witness
[35:52] whom I serve with my spirit in the
[35:56] gospel of his son that without ceasing I
[35:59] make mention of you always in my prayers
[36:02] making requests if by any means now at
[36:06] length I might have a prosperous journey
[36:08] by the will of God to come unto you for
[36:12] I long to see you that I may impart unto
[36:14] you some spiritual gift to the end you
[36:18] may be established that is that I may be
[36:21] comforted together with you by the
[36:23] mutual faith both of you and me now I
[36:28] would not have you ignorant brethren
[36:29] that oftentimes I purposed to come to
[36:34] you but was let hitherto that I might
[36:37] have some fruit among you also even as
[36:40] among other Gentiles I am a debtor both
[36:42] to the Greeks and to the barbarians both
[36:44] to the wise and to the unwise so as much
[36:47] as is in me I am ready to preach the
[36:50] gospel to you that are at Rome also for
[36:54] and I want you to catch these statements
[36:55] I am ready to preach the gospel to you
[36:58] that are at Rome also I'm not ashamed of
[37:02] the gospel of Jesus
[37:03] cries for it is the power of God unto
[37:06] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[37:09] the Jew first and also to the Greek
[37:11] for therein is the righteousness of God
[37:14] revealed from faith unto faith as it is
[37:17] written the just shall live by faith
[37:20] now we realize when we look at this here
[37:23] in in the book of Acts we we know that
[37:27] God when he spoke to Paul and he
[37:31] revealed himself to Paul remember how
[37:34] when Paul met him there on the road to
[37:38] Damascus Paul said Lord who are you what
[37:42] would you have me do and here Paul was
[37:46] so tired and so yoked with that of the
[37:50] religious of that day but here the voice
[37:54] the vadik's that speaks out of that
[37:57] pillar fire I am Jesus whom thou
[38:00] persecutors and we find that that
[38:03] revelation that Paul would have it would
[38:06] be a greater revelation than the rest of
[38:09] them would have although that they would
[38:11] all be partakers of the divine nature of
[38:14] Almighty God but yet Paul would have
[38:17] this revelation and God would continue
[38:19] to unfold to him that indeed that of
[38:23] Jehovah of the oldest Jesus of the new
[38:25] and it would continue to move forth to
[38:28] where Paul was ordained to take the
[38:31] gospel to the Gentiles as much as Peter
[38:34] was to take it to the Jews and we find
[38:37] that here when Paul remember here is
[38:40] Paul you know he begins to move as God
[38:43] would lead him into the different places
[38:46] and you find that Paul would move into
[38:49] the Gentile parts of the world in
[38:52] different places there in Asia Minor and
[38:55] other places you know Cyprus and other
[38:58] things and we know there were Gentiles
[39:00] that were there but every time that Paul
[39:03] came into those places remember there
[39:06] were two Jews that were withstanding him
[39:09] the Jews were stirred up against him it
[39:13] was the Jews that they they they could
[39:16] not stand
[39:17] and what it was was representative it
[39:19] was that life and they were so stirred
[39:22] they looked at it that Paul was taking
[39:25] away and trying to lead lead other Jews
[39:28] from that of the message of Moses or the
[39:32] law and it was quite on the contrary
[39:34] Paul was not trying to lead them away
[39:37] Paul was trying to show them that the
[39:40] fulfillment of the law is in Jesus
[39:44] Christ and he was trying to let her know
[39:46] that the life itself now has come what
[39:50] who was spoken of and have been
[39:53] prophesied to come hasn't become and now
[39:56] the Holy Spirit now is among us the
[40:00] spirit of the atonement but yet they
[40:03] would not receive that and we find that
[40:06] here Paul you know as he's coming in his
[40:09] different parts in the journey he comes
[40:11] here and he's in coming you know to
[40:14] Ephesus and remember Paul has been
[40:16] gathering almost we could say making his
[40:19] last rounds before going to Jerusalem
[40:22] and Paul makes this this declaration
[40:26] here in to do to that in Ephesus in acts
[40:30] 20 verse 22 and he said now behold I go
[40:33] bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not
[40:37] knowing the things that shall befall me
[40:40] there save that the Holy Ghost
[40:43] witnesseth in every city saying that
[40:45] bonds and afflictions abide me but none
[40:49] of these things move me neither count on
[40:53] my life dear unto myself so that I might
[40:57] finish my course with joy and the
[41:00] Ministry which I have received of the
[41:04] Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the
[41:07] grace of God and now behold and know
[41:10] that ye are among whom I have gone
[41:12] preaching the kingdom of God shall see
[41:15] my face no more
[41:18] and that's where many of the brethren
[41:21] the Saints you can just imagine it they
[41:23] were troubled at that statement you'll
[41:25] see my face and no more Paul knew he
[41:29] said I'm bound in the spirit you see he
[41:31] was a prisoner of Jesus Christ he just
[41:35] did not become a prisoner of Jesus
[41:38] Christ this was not a play on words when
[41:40] he was in Rome Paul was already a
[41:42] prisoner of Jesus Christ he had become
[41:46] yoked to the word by the spirits hey man
[41:51] Paul once had an absolute there he had
[41:53] an absolute of all of the the Pharisee
[41:56] teachings and all those things but Paul
[41:59] and on the road to Damascus Paul he
[42:02] found and met a greater absolute an
[42:06] absolute that was the end of all strife
[42:09] Paul met the Lord Jesus Christ after his
[42:12] death burial resurrection in a section
[42:15] he revealed himself to him and Paul
[42:18] turned loose of everything else and he
[42:20] was tied in a union to that of the word
[42:23] remember Paul himself for three years he
[42:26] searched out his experience he would not
[42:30] even for three years he would not
[42:33] proclaim anything but he searched out
[42:35] what happened on the road to Damascus
[42:38] that it must be tied into the word what
[42:43] was it speaking this is what we are
[42:45] restored to is coming back into that
[42:48] Bible faith where a man would know where
[42:50] he would stand with God it is not upon
[42:53] feelings or sensations although all
[42:56] those things can come with it but it's
[42:58] got to come to a place that a man or a
[43:01] woman it's founded upon Christ the solid
[43:04] rock and they know within their life my
[43:07] life has been changed it's not me making
[43:10] a difference its Christ in me that has
[43:13] come and here was Paul standing as a
[43:19] witness here I go bound in the spirit to
[43:22] Jerusalem I don't know what things are
[43:24] gonna be for me
[43:26] oh my what trust axe 2110 now here they
[43:33] come to some other brethren a new
[43:36] familiar here is a profit that comes
[43:38] here is pawpaws the profit to the age
[43:41] there can be minor prophets those
[43:44] prophets that arise up but let me just
[43:46] say this very clearly a prophet e a
[43:48] prophet in the New Testament is a
[43:50] preacher so nobody is going to tell me
[43:55] they're a prophet and they don't preach
[43:57] because that ain't scriptural come on
[44:00] somebody they're not a prophet in
[44:02] setting in church and well they don't
[44:03] preach but you know they're a prophet
[44:05] that is not scriptural are you with me
[44:09] now you see here when it comes into this
[44:12] place
[44:13] here comes Hagia bus he's moved in and
[44:16] the Bible says a judy and a certain
[44:18] prophet named Agabus and when he was
[44:21] coming to us
[44:22] he took Paul's girdle and bound his own
[44:25] hands and feet and said thus saith the
[44:27] Holy Ghost so shall the Jews at
[44:30] Jerusalem buying the man that owned at
[44:32] this girdle and shall deliver him into
[44:35] the hands of the Gentiles and here they
[44:40] write has Luke would write this when we
[44:42] heard those things both we and they of
[44:46] that place besought him not to go to
[44:50] Jerusalem then Paul answered no look at
[44:54] this answer what mean ye to weep and to
[44:57] break my heart for I am ready not to be
[45:03] bound only but also to die at Jerusalem
[45:07] for the name of the Lord Jesus this is
[45:12] God's purpose moving in his heart this
[45:19] is not the DNA of a man come on somebody
[45:24] this is not the DNA of Paul who was of
[45:29] the tribe of Benjamin this is the DNA
[45:33] that comes from the tree of life
[45:36] where the purpose of God means
[45:39] everything where a person can be so
[45:42] overtaken to say I'm now ready that's a
[45:46] question are you ready for the rapture
[45:49] can you say I'm now ready this is what
[45:55] Paul was declaring I'm now ready I don't
[45:58] have to wait till I get to Jerusalem I'm
[46:00] now ready
[46:05] and when he would not be persuaded we
[46:07] see saying the the will of the Lord be
[46:09] done
[46:10] now what Agra bespoke was the truth is
[46:14] that right the Holy Ghost came upon
[46:16] Angelus a true prophet of God he was not
[46:20] the prophet of the age but he came and
[46:24] the Holy Spirit moved down what he said
[46:26] was absolutely truth but notice this
[46:28] this is where it shows within the heart
[46:31] and life of an individual it's got to be
[46:34] so solid that your dependency is solidly
[46:39] resting in the purpose of God that has
[46:42] been revealed to your life think of
[46:45] these these that were gathered around
[46:46] Paul they were crying and they were
[46:48] pulling on him trying to persuade Paul
[46:51] don't go up Paul you don't know what
[46:53] waits Paul you know I'm telling you
[46:55] there was so much fear and scare that
[46:57] was gone all around there it took the
[46:59] grace of God to expel all of that to
[47:02] where Paul could say I'm now ready to go
[47:05] up to Jerusalem I'm ready to die you
[47:08] know what it was then the random tells
[47:09] us that what Paul had witnessed when he
[47:12] saw Steven and Steven take his last
[47:15] breath he said Paul it never left his
[47:18] mind
[47:19] and Paul was so determined that as
[47:22] Steven had sealed his life
[47:24] Paul was determined I'm gonna seal my
[47:27] life for the gospel I want to ask you
[47:29] tonight
[47:30] are you that determined that for you to
[47:33] seal your life for the gospel of Jesus
[47:35] Christ let me just say it like this this
[47:47] these statements are not things that
[47:48] came out overnight this is from growth
[47:52] and maturity which is a result of dying
[47:57] out Paul said I die daily
[48:02] these these portions of the word that
[48:06] are given to encourage you not listen
[48:08] we're not ignorant of this here was a
[48:11] life that here would put his heart and
[48:13] his life before God to die out daily the
[48:19] preparation that God would pray with wit
[48:23] would place and bring through a life in
[48:25] order that his desires that God's
[48:28] desires might be fulfilled through our
[48:31] life God has an achievement that he
[48:34] alone works out as he gains preeminence
[48:37] in our lives think of this here comes
[48:42] Paul you know he arrives here you know
[48:45] in in in Rome and let me just read this
[48:49] here in acts 28 here here is Paul and he
[48:55] wants in verse 17 he requests after now
[48:59] he's here he is he's he's there in Rome
[49:02] he's awaiting his appeal before Caesar
[49:05] to appear there he calls the chief Jews
[49:08] together then are there in Rome and he
[49:11] begins to speak to them and he says men
[49:13] and brethren though I have committed
[49:15] nothing against the people or customs of
[49:18] our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner
[49:21] from Jerusalem into the hands of the
[49:24] Romans who when they had examined me
[49:27] would have let me go because there was
[49:30] no cause of death in me but when the
[49:33] Jews speak against it I was constrained
[49:36] to appeal unto Caesar not that I had
[49:41] aught to accuse my nation of
[49:47] for this calls therefore I've called for
[49:50] you to see you to speak with you because
[49:53] that for the hope of Israel I am bound
[49:56] with this chain I was not simply talking
[50:00] about the chain that was upon his arms
[50:04] but the hope of Israel what was the hope
[50:07] of Israel the Messiah they meant the
[50:10] outpouring of that life which David
[50:13] would write by where a David would write
[50:16] let all Israel hope in the Lord hey
[50:20] Manny this was this was the expectation
[50:22] and notice when Paul would would write
[50:26] this this is so strikes my heart he said
[50:28] in verse 19 I was constrained to appeal
[50:31] unto Caesar not that I had aught to
[50:35] accuse my nation listen there in what we
[50:38] read within here what a readiness we've
[50:42] seen with Paul leading up to Jerusalem
[50:45] now here he is standing there before
[50:49] Felix standing before them and before
[50:52] the rest and Paul would say I appeal
[50:55] unto Caesar Paul he's letting it be
[50:59] known right here he did not appeal
[51:01] because of a vindictive reason it was
[51:04] not out of malice it was not out of
[51:06] hatred
[51:07] what a readiness this is the same
[51:11] readiness he witnessed in Steven when
[51:16] Steven could say lay not this sin at
[51:21] their charge this was the same readiness
[51:25] when our Lord and Savior when he hung on
[51:28] the cross and they were making fun of
[51:31] him they had spit on him they had
[51:33] rejected him and what did he say Father
[51:36] forgive them for they know not what they
[51:39] do
[51:39] that's readiness that's readiness amen
[51:47] Paul he had become so ready
[51:50] so yielded saw overtaken with the love
[51:54] of God such molding such training
[51:58] that he had received for this moment now
[52:03] let's look here let's begin to look by
[52:06] the help of the Lord into this life of a
[52:10] prisoner of Jesus Christ and as Paul
[52:13] would write here in the book of
[52:15] Philippians one of the prison epistles
[52:19] here
[52:21] Frank how Paul would would express in
[52:24] verse 1 Paul entomo theists the servants
[52:29] of Jesus Christ to all the Saints in
[52:31] Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with
[52:33] the bishops and deacons grace be unto
[52:36] you and peace from God our Father and
[52:39] from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my
[52:42] god upon every remembrance of you always
[52:46] in every prayer of mine for you all
[52:48] making requests with joy for your
[52:52] fellowship in the gospel from the first
[52:54] day until now being confident of this
[52:57] very thing that he which hath begun a
[53:00] good work in you will perform it unto
[53:03] the day of Jesus Christ what a character
[53:11] the first words that he would write in
[53:14] this letter of coming out has nothing to
[53:18] do with his circumstances it has nothing
[53:23] to do with Paul he's letting me know my
[53:28] prayers
[53:29] I've not ceased to pray for you and make
[53:32] requests with joy for what for the
[53:36] furtherance of the gospel in your life
[53:39] all what a lesson that is to be learned
[53:42] right here amen I'm talking about
[53:46] a ready life
[53:52] power without character is satanic
[53:57] it's alive that's to be lived life in
[54:01] humility here Paul this is we want to we
[54:06] find eternal life living for others Paul
[54:08] did not take the first few verses and
[54:11] tell us how bad it is I am I'm trained
[54:14] and there's a guard that relieves every
[54:16] four hours I want you all to pray for me
[54:19] very earnestly I need you he wasn't
[54:21] writing about that you see what it was
[54:24] it wasn't Paul in the front weld it went
[54:27] Paul before everything else
[54:29] it was Christ then others Paul was last
[54:34] that's an overcoming life Satan is the
[54:39] opposite Satan is me first and I don't
[54:42] care who comes after me or who I've got
[54:44] a walk off to do what I want to do that
[54:47] Satan's way but that's not God's Way and
[54:51] God Himself will not force his way into
[54:55] us he don't force his way God don't
[55:00] force his will upon nobody even when it
[55:05] has it's God's will for a life and that
[55:09] life can be where it's written in the
[55:11] will of God but yet God does not force
[55:14] that will because remember it's got to
[55:17] come on free more agency every man in
[55:21] every woman has got to make a choice and
[55:24] listen to me closely you're choosing
[55:26] does not stop you've got to choose every
[55:30] day and every moment of your life that I
[55:33] desire I'm going to do God's will
[55:37] you've got choices I've got choices
[55:39] daily that are put before us how we
[55:43] going to respond how we going to take
[55:45] this approach
[55:51] Paul said in verse 7 even as it is a
[55:55] meet for me to think this of you all
[55:57] because I have you in the heart
[56:00] in as much as both in my bonds and in
[56:03] the defence and confirmation of the
[56:06] gospel ye are all partakers of my grace
[56:10] you know Paul was letting him know we're
[56:12] in this together this is the very listen
[56:16] this is the very prophet of God that had
[56:19] received the inspiration and wrote about
[56:22] a body and would write if one member
[56:25] hurts they all heard if one rejoice we
[56:28] all rejoice he this was not just
[56:30] something that was wrote it was it was
[56:33] from his heart what was live Paul seemed
[56:36] that God would allow that to be unfolded
[56:39] that you and I could understand it
[56:41] because you see God loves to be
[56:44] relatable is that right and so hound
[56:49] that this would be where Paul was
[56:51] letting them know you're right here in
[56:53] my heart you're represented in in both
[56:57] my bonds and in defense and confirmation
[57:00] of the gospel because those that he was
[57:03] writing to in Philippi the Philippian
[57:07] Church remembered those who he was
[57:10] writing to they they themselves have
[57:13] been mourn witness of the gospel of
[57:16] Jesus Christ that had come to them
[57:18] through the ministry of Apostle Paul and
[57:22] Paul was letting them know as Paul would
[57:24] say in Ephesus Paul would say you know
[57:27] in the other places he would say it over
[57:29] and over that this grace in the book of
[57:32] Colossians what God has given to me it
[57:34] was a gospel that is given for you that
[57:37] you might fulfill the will of God he was
[57:41] letting to know were sharing together in
[57:43] this grace for God as my record how
[57:46] greatly I longed after you all in the
[57:48] bowels of Jesus Christ the innermost
[57:50] part of his life and I pray and this I
[57:55] pray that your love may abound yet more
[57:59] and more in knowledge
[58:01] in all judgment that you may approve
[58:04] things that are excellent that you may
[58:08] be sincere and without offence till the
[58:10] day of Christ being filled with the
[58:13] fruit of righteousness which are by
[58:16] Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise
[58:18] of God he's admonishing the believers to
[58:23] keep growing that the love of God would
[58:28] abound in you in all judgment that there
[58:32] would be a continual growing in their
[58:36] lives you see this was no different you
[58:39] read in the book of Colossians read in
[58:42] the book of Thessalonians first and
[58:44] second Thessalonians has been primarily
[58:45] the first book of Thessalonians Paul
[58:47] would open his letters of how then he
[58:50] himself had been praying and the prayer
[58:53] of his desire would be that the fruit
[58:55] would be made manifest in the life of
[58:58] the believers he would write how that
[59:00] you know the desire is that that life
[59:02] would settle in into your heart that you
[59:04] might know Christ back that of faith
[59:07] that of faith revealed and love in your
[59:10] heart he would write the desire that
[59:12] fruits might abound within your life
[59:14] that's what Paul was praying for you
[59:16] know what Paul realized Paul recognized
[59:18] that he was it could not be anything
[59:21] that was man handled it had to be God to
[59:25] do the work brother and sister one thing
[59:29] I realized I can preach to I'm blue in
[59:32] the face even just not my voice that
[59:34] makes a difference it's got to come the
[59:37] Holy Spirit into hearts that are
[59:40] receptive because God don't want anybody
[59:45] to serve him out of a their freighter
[59:48] they're scared or one or more there
[59:50] might be fear have to sit on your life
[59:52] to realize there's a real hell I tell
[59:57] you there's a real hell to go to there's
[59:59] a real happen to go to hell is real
[1:00:02] nothing is real but hell was not made
[1:00:07] for human beings it was made for the
[1:00:11] devil and his angels
[1:00:13] but I can tell you whatever kind of life
[1:00:16] you're living will show where your york
[1:00:18] to in your influence if you let the
[1:00:22] things in the world you're being
[1:00:23] influenced from beneath there's a pool
[1:00:26] going on a downward pool but if there is
[1:00:30] a love and a desire for the things above
[1:00:33] then brother there's where you got
[1:00:34] representation it's pulling from above
[1:00:37] you gotta pull to perfection oh yeah I
[1:00:44] think many times I had just you know
[1:00:46] thought about that many times I thought
[1:00:48] oh God has it been so long since the
[1:00:51] word hell has been said in the church
[1:00:54] I'm talking about churches around you
[1:00:57] know you say brother Samuel wewe
[1:00:59] shouldn't be preaching that let me tell
[1:01:00] you something there is a heaven to gain
[1:01:03] and a hat to lose hell is real it's not
[1:01:09] a joke
[1:01:10] and heaven is real the rich young ruler
[1:01:18] was a good boy he did everything and he
[1:01:22] kept all the commandments but he wound
[1:01:26] up in hell he wound up in hell because
[1:01:30] he left the world too much he had one
[1:01:34] thing when Jesus touched that one thing
[1:01:37] in his life he wasn't willing to get rid
[1:01:40] of it you know what it comes down to God
[1:01:43] touches things in a person's life and
[1:01:45] then they want to say I can't do it but
[1:01:48] I'm telling you God ain't asking you to
[1:01:50] do it God said I already have done it
[1:01:53] for you if you'll just accept it but the
[1:01:59] rich young ruler he had he went away sad
[1:02:02] because he had great possessions then
[1:02:07] the Bible said he lifted up his eyes and
[1:02:09] hail well that was free
[1:02:15] but verse 12 of Philippians 1 but how
[1:02:20] would you should understand brethren
[1:02:22] that the things which happen unto me
[1:02:25] have fallen out rather unto the
[1:02:28] furtherance of the gospel
[1:02:34] these are the same believers once you
[1:02:37] think of this now we can bring this
[1:02:39] right down into our homes these are the
[1:02:43] same believers he's writing to that in
[1:02:47] that city government men and when there
[1:02:51] was an uprising after a man began to
[1:02:53] lose money when Paul cast that demon out
[1:02:56] of that woman who was following them
[1:03:00] Paul had to wait till God give him
[1:03:03] permission to do it and when he did it
[1:03:06] though they seemed the loss of their
[1:03:08] revenue and their income and they went
[1:03:10] straight to the rulers and they took
[1:03:12] Paul and Silas and they threw him into
[1:03:15] prison but once again here was Paul and
[1:03:20] Silas they were in some very dire
[1:03:23] circumstances but the Bible said along
[1:03:26] about midnight this is after they'd been
[1:03:28] beaten they had already been striked
[1:03:31] they begin to sing praises unto God they
[1:03:37] begin to praise the Lord
[1:03:39] and you understand we know what to place
[1:03:41] these were believers that had a witness
[1:03:45] of how the power of God had come down
[1:03:48] when Paul and Silas had began to worship
[1:03:51] the Lord they would not allow the walls
[1:03:54] of the prison to hold their spirits in
[1:03:57] there but I'm telling you no matter what
[1:04:00] situation you're in
[1:04:02] don't let the situation hold you captive
[1:04:06] there is nothing should hold you captive
[1:04:08] as a son and daughter of God you've been
[1:04:11] set free I don't care how many
[1:04:13] cinderblock walls how many and bars or
[1:04:16] whatever more there is nothing that can
[1:04:19] hinder the word of Almighty God
[1:04:23] he let him know I want you to know
[1:04:26] what's happened because remember after
[1:04:30] all they could have been wondering God
[1:04:33] brought deliverance before in Philippi
[1:04:36] the walls come flying down and the
[1:04:40] Philippian jailer was led to the Lord
[1:04:43] and his house is that right along with
[1:04:46] many other Saints that accumulated but
[1:04:48] you see God doesn't always do the same
[1:04:52] thing the same way all the time but yet
[1:04:56] he's the same God you and I can look
[1:04:59] back and say well he opened the Red Sea
[1:05:01] so there's a need in my life he's the
[1:05:04] same God and I can say Amen for that but
[1:05:07] to see what God will do he'll always
[1:05:10] manifest his nature and his character
[1:05:13] the same way God is always the waymaker
[1:05:19] but you see why were they even in Philip
[1:05:21] I see it comes back to this place and
[1:05:24] Paul no doubt these things are coming
[1:05:26] back to them as believers why was Paul
[1:05:29] in that Philippi in jail it was more
[1:05:31] than just about a disturbance in the
[1:05:34] city
[1:05:35] God knew I gotta get Paul there because
[1:05:38] I've got a son of God right there that
[1:05:42] needs to hear this gospel and he needs
[1:05:44] to see the power of God that'll break
[1:05:47] the yoke of bondage about his life God
[1:05:50] knows what he's doing to get things in
[1:05:52] position and Paul's letting them know
[1:05:55] hey God a week
[1:05:59] but what's happened to me is for the
[1:06:02] furtherance of the gospel so that my
[1:06:05] bonds look how Paul writes of this so
[1:06:07] that my bonds in Christ he ain't talking
[1:06:10] about the trains upon his arms now he's
[1:06:12] talking about the bonds of love from his
[1:06:14] heart the bonds of Christ my bonds in
[1:06:18] Christ are manifest we're in all the
[1:06:24] palace and in all other places
[1:06:29] if you have an opportunity and you look
[1:06:32] to see where these hired houses are
[1:06:35] where they would have to rent out and
[1:06:38] stay there awaiting their court
[1:06:39] appearance you would find that they're
[1:06:42] not real real far from that of the
[1:06:44] palace but yet there is a great distance
[1:06:46] from that of the palace it's a very very
[1:06:48] small dwelling and remember now in this
[1:06:52] dwelling Paul has been receiving not
[1:06:54] just the chief of the Jews but after he
[1:06:56] had just spoke to the chief of the Jews
[1:06:58] that we read in the book of Acts
[1:07:00] remember they reasoned among themselves
[1:07:02] when Paul got into the Book of Isaiah
[1:07:04] the Jews didn't show up no more but
[1:07:07] remember at that time this is when Paul
[1:07:09] turns then to the Gentiles there had
[1:07:11] been Gentiles that had been warned
[1:07:13] throughout the other previous journeys
[1:07:15] throughout around but here in the midst
[1:07:17] of this time you're talking about being
[1:07:19] alone Paul was alone sure at times he
[1:07:22] would have been timotheus he would have
[1:07:25] at pride itis he would have different
[1:07:27] ones that would actually come in and
[1:07:29] room with him
[1:07:30] in that period of time but yet within at
[1:07:33] all think about how alone that he must
[1:07:35] feel how it would be so easy to get down
[1:07:38] on himself how easy it would be to
[1:07:41] complain how easy it would be to marmar
[1:07:44] there's no doubt that there one
[1:07:46] temptations all around you think the
[1:07:48] devil didn't try to show up and peck on
[1:07:50] Paul's shoulder and say hey if you
[1:07:52] hadn't opens your mouth you wouldn't be
[1:07:54] here if you had just said quiet and not
[1:07:57] appealed to Caesar you even know it you
[1:07:59] said it's yourself Paul they were going
[1:08:01] to turn you loose because they could not
[1:08:03] find any charge against you you know
[1:08:06] what I'm talking about there's some
[1:08:07] times where even you or me have looked
[1:08:10] at a situation we know it's the will of
[1:08:12] God but yet sometimes in the midst of a
[1:08:15] waiting when the midst of when we're
[1:08:17] waiting for the next move or the next
[1:08:20] Junction that's when the enemy can move
[1:08:22] in and begin to try and God will allow
[1:08:25] him to try that's the same way he did in
[1:08:27] the days of Noah Noah waited in the ark
[1:08:30] seven days it was on the seventh day
[1:08:33] that the rain came Noah thought day
[1:08:36] after day surely the rain is going to
[1:08:39] come but it did not come until God's
[1:08:42] appointed time
[1:08:43] no matter how much the enemy tried to
[1:08:45] attempt him Pat Noah knew where he was
[1:08:48] supposed to be at that time and I'll say
[1:08:50] not only for Paul Paul also knew this
[1:08:53] was God's will that had been unfolded
[1:08:55] for his life the same as it is for you
[1:08:57] and me when situations arise even though
[1:09:00] you and I can look at and say well maybe
[1:09:02] should I went this way or should I went
[1:09:04] that way but there's an absolute you can
[1:09:06] always come back to and say wait a
[1:09:08] minute I did not open the door
[1:09:11] wherewith I have walked through but God
[1:09:13] has opened this door and it gives you a
[1:09:16] peace and a comfort to wait on the Lord
[1:09:21] this is a prisoner of Jesus Christ and
[1:09:27] many of the Brethren in the Lord
[1:09:30] waxing confident by my bonds are much
[1:09:33] more bold to speak the word without fear
[1:09:35] now notice this in that of the palace
[1:09:38] the bonds of Christ they were not
[1:09:41] talking about Paul the prisoner of Rome
[1:09:44] that's not the bonds they were talking
[1:09:47] about this was the bonds that were in
[1:09:49] Christ that that reality that revelation
[1:09:53] that it's so gripped Paul's heart it was
[1:09:56] that which had affected the lives of
[1:09:59] servants the lives of different ones
[1:10:04] throughout Caesars house even as history
[1:10:07] would account even some of Nero's very
[1:10:10] family members were converted under
[1:10:13] Paul's ministry here's the end of the
[1:10:17] live of Philippians 4 let me just jump
[1:10:18] to it real quick now unto God and our
[1:10:21] Father be glory for ever and ever amen
[1:10:23] salute every saint in Christ Jesus the
[1:10:26] brethren which are with are with me
[1:10:29] greet you all the saints salute you
[1:10:32] chiefly they that are of Caesars
[1:10:36] household
[1:10:39] so it had not just went into the palace
[1:10:42] but all those in Caesars household
[1:10:45] servants all the different ones even
[1:10:49] family members now think of it Paul said
[1:10:53] I want you to know what's happened to me
[1:10:56] is happened for the furtherance of the
[1:10:59] gospel if Paul had not been here
[1:11:02] I wonder if Paul had said men when they
[1:11:04] go hurry up with this I'm sick and tired
[1:11:06] of being locked in my house I'm tired of
[1:11:08] this I want it
[1:11:09] you're not wanna I want to go I wanted
[1:11:11] this you know sometimes what we miss
[1:11:13] that we miss the blessing of God is
[1:11:15] because we complain too much at the
[1:11:17] circumstances we find ourselves in now
[1:11:20] listen it's not the sole part when we've
[1:11:22] really been converted it's not the sole
[1:11:24] part because you'll find yourself
[1:11:25] quickly repenting and retracting because
[1:11:28] you know it ain't the right attitude
[1:11:29] it's not the right take on it but this
[1:11:32] guy the flesh that of the Spirit the the
[1:11:34] flesh those that God gets weak sometimes
[1:11:37] he always wants his way wants to get out
[1:11:39] there but think of it within this time
[1:11:42] it was necessary that Paul would be
[1:11:44] right here no doubt then they covered
[1:11:47] here is a man that had went around and
[1:11:49] preached meetings though they weren't
[1:11:50] maybe real big meeting some meetings he
[1:11:53] had great audiences and things like that
[1:11:55] such as when he would peer before their
[1:11:57] men Athens in Greece and but many of the
[1:11:59] audiences of which Paul himself would
[1:12:02] preach too would be very small the Bible
[1:12:04] would say from house to house it was
[1:12:07] very small gatherings but nonetheless it
[1:12:10] would be gatherings that Paul could go
[1:12:12] to and freely fellowship with the people
[1:12:15] of God but in this particular
[1:12:16] circumstance right here it was not so
[1:12:19] much that easy but yet Paul opened up
[1:12:22] the rented house he was in and Paul
[1:12:25] would preached the gospel to those of
[1:12:27] the servants different ones of Nero's
[1:12:29] household that were coming in brother
[1:12:31] let me tell you something in order for
[1:12:33] the bonds of Christ to be made manifest
[1:12:36] it could not have been Paul telling them
[1:12:38] telling them who were coming in of the
[1:12:40] meager circumstances and I'll tell you
[1:12:43] it's been so hard today you know I had
[1:12:45] nothing to eat I had nothing because you
[1:12:47] know Paul he even writes in this letter
[1:12:49] about being hungry he would write I know
[1:12:51] how to be content but you see Paul did
[1:12:54] not put that out because why that is not
[1:12:56] the gospel but there were things that
[1:12:59] came along and Paul would be able to so
[1:13:01] surrender that he was not Paul that was
[1:13:04] touching the hearts of
[1:13:06] rose family and Nero service it wasn't
[1:13:09] that at all
[1:13:10] it was Christ who he was yoked to that
[1:13:13] was actually touching their life there
[1:13:16] was an impression of the very image of
[1:13:19] Christ that was being reflected through
[1:13:22] Paul's life and ministry let me tell you
[1:13:24] something you may not remember who
[1:13:27] preached what but as long as there's
[1:13:29] been an effect of the image of Christ as
[1:13:32] long as the Holy Ghost comes down and he
[1:13:35] impacts that life with his divine image
[1:13:38] as long as he comes in the meeting
[1:13:41] that's all that matters oh my sometimes
[1:13:49] the circumstances that we frankly would
[1:13:54] have erupted to complaint we frankly
[1:13:57] would have a right to ask what good is
[1:14:00] going to come out of this
[1:14:04] you know sometimes there's things where
[1:14:07] on every one of us
[1:14:09] get in tight places
[1:14:14] I'm talking about tight places that are
[1:14:16] not convenient or comfortable to the
[1:14:20] natural man then they're tight places
[1:14:23] where there be there's a tendency for
[1:14:28] that old flesh man to raise up
[1:14:32] but this is where is let me just just
[1:14:36] for sake of time let me just refer to it
[1:14:38] how did the message Jubilee year brother
[1:14:42] Brown would say it like this let me just
[1:14:43] refer to instead of read it he said you
[1:14:45] take a man or a person that says I'll
[1:14:48] tell you're going to God I used to cuss
[1:14:50] but I quit cussing he said that's what
[1:14:54] you did said another person said glory
[1:14:57] to God I used to be I used to drink so
[1:15:00] much but I quit drinking he said that's
[1:15:02] what you did that's what you did that's
[1:15:05] a moral thing you did you stopped or if
[1:15:11] you could only get that lined up with
[1:15:13] the power of God where a person said you
[1:15:15] know what Lord I'm sick of this life
[1:15:19] then it's more than a moral thing it
[1:15:22] becomes a god thing but you see to
[1:15:25] receive Jesus Christ is to receive his
[1:15:28] person is to receive him
[1:15:33] not an attribute of him but him
[1:15:37] and this is where then you find hearts
[1:15:40] and lives and people that you know you
[1:15:42] come into tight places on the job among
[1:15:45] family died in situations and here to
[1:15:49] see that where a person can testify of
[1:15:52] another one and say I'll tell you that's
[1:15:54] a real Christian I've seen them in tight
[1:15:57] places that's they're not in popular but
[1:16:00] I've seen them when the odds are stacked
[1:16:01] against him I've seen him when people
[1:16:03] have been pushing their buttons and work
[1:16:06] I've seen them in tight places and you
[1:16:08] know what there are Christian in tight
[1:16:10] places you see one one makes that the
[1:16:14] seal you're sealed the baptism of the
[1:16:18] Holy Ghost the seal of the Living God
[1:16:21] you are sealed unto the day of
[1:16:23] redemption
[1:16:25] it seals you on both sides coming and
[1:16:27] going are you with me now it seals
[1:16:31] coming and going you're a Christian
[1:16:34] through and through you're sealed by the
[1:16:36] Spirit of God amen Europe he'll be
[1:16:40] brother Benson he'll be christ-like
[1:16:41] today he'll be christ-like tomorrow
[1:16:44] Christ like the next day in the trials
[1:16:46] he's christ-like in troubles he's
[1:16:48] christ-like in hunger
[1:16:50] he's Christ's life in joy he's
[1:16:51] christ-like everywhere you see him or
[1:16:54] her they're christ-like for they're
[1:16:56] sealed by the Holy Ghost you see what I
[1:17:00] mean
[1:17:00] that's not your spirit
[1:17:07] that's not our spirit
[1:17:10] that's his spirit he gives us strength
[1:17:14] it gives us it empowers us
[1:17:19] because we can feel pulled this way feel
[1:17:22] pulled that way and let me just say it
[1:17:25] that even if there's something that said
[1:17:28] in what you might say might be right but
[1:17:30] it might be a little snarky how you said
[1:17:32] it the Spirit of God will pick that
[1:17:36] right up and bring correction to it in
[1:17:38] your life and you'll be going back and
[1:17:41] asking forgiveness not because of what
[1:17:43] you said but you'll say I said that
[1:17:45] wrong shouldn't have said that maybe it
[1:17:49] was the timing of it why because he's in
[1:17:52] control you could say well I got a right
[1:17:56] to that you don't know what they said
[1:17:58] you don't know what they did but
[1:17:59] remember the Spirit of Christ within you
[1:18:02] it rings out it's done a lot brother you
[1:18:05] won't get by it you won't be able to
[1:18:07] cross over it you've got to come back
[1:18:09] and line every part up with the word so
[1:18:14] circumstances
[1:18:17] if we really look at it right
[1:18:18] circumstances
[1:18:20] neither change or bind the Word of God
[1:18:23] that's anchored in the soul of a
[1:18:24] believer
[1:18:27] amen the seal shows coming and going the
[1:18:31] token shows coming and going this is why
[1:18:33] I love this quote out of enticing
[1:18:35] spirits brother Brown said you give me a
[1:18:38] preacher you give me a Christian you
[1:18:40] give me a housewife
[1:18:41] that's a Christian you give me a farmer
[1:18:43] or a factory worker that'll put God
[1:18:46] first in everything I'll show you a man
[1:18:51] that'll be successful in the spite of
[1:18:54] all the devil can put on him he seeks
[1:18:57] God first what is the depth of this
[1:19:01] seeking I believe this is what the depth
[1:19:03] of it is like David said here in the
[1:19:05] resurrection Psalm I have set the Lord
[1:19:08] always be for me it comes down where we
[1:19:13] set the Lord before our attitude we set
[1:19:17] the leavitt before our feelings we set
[1:19:20] the Lord before our opinions we set the
[1:19:24] Lord before all things why because the
[1:19:26] desire within us is to be pleasing unto
[1:19:29] him look what Paul wrote in 2nd Timothy
[1:19:34] 2:8 this is a prison epistle notice how
[1:19:38] Paul writes this concerning this time
[1:19:41] remember that Jesus Christ of the seed
[1:19:44] of David was raised from the dead
[1:19:46] according to my gospel wherein I suffer
[1:19:49] trouble as an evil evildoer even unto
[1:19:53] bonds but the Word of God is not bound
[1:20:01] there it be the God you see the word of
[1:20:04] God listen to me now the word of God
[1:20:07] would have been bound if Paul would have
[1:20:10] had a bad attitude if Paul would have
[1:20:13] said thank guys why don't they listen to
[1:20:15] me you know God will put you in
[1:20:17] situations where you're the one who's
[1:20:19] right
[1:20:22] I hope you listen to me now that got a
[1:20:24] little quiet God will put you in
[1:20:26] situations where you're absolutely right
[1:20:31] and when you're right somebody
[1:20:33] criticizes you somebody says something
[1:20:36] and God lets that test come to see how
[1:20:40] you're gonna handle it because you know
[1:20:45] it's easy come on now
[1:20:47] it's easy as Peter said to be buffeted
[1:20:49] for our faults somebody's a man you
[1:20:52] shouldn't have done this you shouldn't
[1:20:53] have said that but it's a different
[1:20:54] thing Peter would write for us to take
[1:20:56] it patiently when things that you've
[1:20:58] done where it's you've searched it out
[1:21:01] and yet
[1:21:03] you criticize within it you know if the
[1:21:05] tendency in the pool is to prove your
[1:21:08] point who is that that's a flesh man
[1:21:14] that's the flesh man always wants to
[1:21:16] prove his side so that I'm innocent I'm
[1:21:19] this I'm that and listen we all deal
[1:21:21] with that every husband a wife's a man
[1:21:25] glory to God we all deal with that but
[1:21:30] the Word of God is not bound
[1:21:39] even with her Roman centurion he
[1:21:41] realized there was no bound Binding of
[1:21:43] the word distance didn't matter
[1:21:47] distance didn't matter
[1:21:49] a man even in present circumstances the
[1:21:53] Word of God is not bound
[1:21:56] let me try to bring these things
[1:21:57] together
[1:21:59] therefore verse 10 under all things for
[1:22:03] the elects sake that they may also
[1:22:05] obtain the salvation which is in Christ
[1:22:07] Jesus with eternal glory
[1:22:10] it's a faithful saying for if we'd be
[1:22:12] dead with him we should also live with
[1:22:13] him if we suffer we shall also reign
[1:22:16] with him if we deny him he will also
[1:22:18] deny us if we believe not yet he abideth
[1:22:20] faithful he cannot deny himself
[1:22:24] the cow Paul would write this in second
[1:22:26] Timothy 1:8 be not thou for there
[1:22:29] ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor
[1:22:32] me of his prisoner
[1:22:34] but be thou partaker of the afflictions
[1:22:36] of the Gospel according to the power of
[1:22:38] God
[1:22:41] we have just a moment let's stop one of
[1:22:46] these that are going
[1:22:48] from Nero's house
[1:22:51] where y'all going today
[1:22:54] what temp are you going to today or when
[1:22:57] I going to a temple
[1:22:59] well where you going to service well
[1:23:02] we're we're going down here to this
[1:23:04] little hired house little hired house
[1:23:09] you mean that man that they've got a
[1:23:11] chain on him and on a Roman
[1:23:14] every four hours
[1:23:17] you mean that man that's a prisoner
[1:23:19] you're going to hear him
[1:23:22] you're going to listen to him
[1:23:25] now they would say yeah we believe
[1:23:29] that's God's a messenger to this hour
[1:23:33] think about how it would have looked a
[1:23:36] man in whom the government was against
[1:23:42] you did not look like a fitting
[1:23:45] circumstance
[1:23:47] it was not the beauty of because they
[1:23:50] didn't have the churches at that time
[1:23:52] they just had houses it was not even
[1:23:55] better than normal but to think even the
[1:23:57] people that would come there and to hear
[1:24:00] the gospel they themselves had moved
[1:24:02] beyond shame
[1:24:07] and Paul was not ashamed of the gospel
[1:24:09] and he would implore them don't be
[1:24:12] ashamed of the gospel nor of me his
[1:24:15] prisoner
[1:24:18] because many of the things that we look
[1:24:21] at now that's wrote in the book of
[1:24:23] Ephesians
[1:24:23] when Paul would write about husband and
[1:24:25] wife what Paul wrote there was so
[1:24:27] contrary to that of life in that day he
[1:24:34] would be considered a nut compared to
[1:24:37] that of society
[1:24:40] but don't be ashamed of the testimony of
[1:24:43] our Lord nor me of his prisoner
[1:24:45] he would write in Romans 8:28 which
[1:24:48] we've read from you know he would say we
[1:24:51] know that all things work together for
[1:24:53] good to them that love God to them who
[1:24:56] are called according to his purpose
[1:24:59] being there in that prison was not a
[1:25:02] good thing but look what God was doing
[1:25:04] out of it
[1:25:06] Ephesians 1 verse 11 he would write of
[1:25:10] that of being of the predestination of
[1:25:13] being chosen in Christ and he would and
[1:25:16] he would move to write this by the
[1:25:18] spirit in verse 11 in whom we have also
[1:25:21] obtained an inheritance being
[1:25:23] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:25:25] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:25:29] counsel of his own will
[1:25:33] this is trust remember as we were
[1:25:39] ministering that before
[1:25:40] Paul did not know remember I'm ready to
[1:25:43] go to Jerusalem and die he didn't know I
[1:25:45] was going to Rome he appealed to Caesar
[1:25:49] God didn't tell him I'm sending you in a
[1:25:51] room it wasn't until the angel of the
[1:25:55] Lord showed up right there on the ship
[1:25:58] and said fear not Paul that shalt stand
[1:26:04] before Caesar hallelujah
[1:26:08] girl repeater God you want a
[1:26:11] confirmation that was Juana what a a
[1:26:14] strengthening that was in that
[1:26:16] circumstance though that circumstance
[1:26:19] Paul could have been remembers we looked
[1:26:21] at it Paul could have kept on talking
[1:26:23] about it why did they lose why did they
[1:26:26] do this why did he do that why did he do
[1:26:28] that he could have been posting that on
[1:26:30] his Facebook day after day after day
[1:26:34] after day complaining but he didn't do
[1:26:37] that he didn't do that the prophet of
[1:26:42] God tells us that Paul was down in that
[1:26:45] ship dragging his chain and he was
[1:26:48] praising the Lord and he said about that
[1:26:50] time wouldn't go and Paul was worshiping
[1:26:53] the Lord about midnight he said the
[1:26:55] angel the Lord came in there
[1:26:57] and spoke to Paul I'm telling you on a
[1:27:01] testimony though the circumstances were
[1:27:04] undesirable but God met his child right
[1:27:10] in the midst of those circumstances God
[1:27:13] was working everything out after the
[1:27:16] counsel of his own will if I could just
[1:27:24] divert just for a moment in wrapping up
[1:27:27] here tonight
[1:27:29] remember John writes in Revelation
[1:27:33] chapter 1 a John who also am your
[1:27:37] brother and companion in tribulation and
[1:27:41] in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ was in the isle of Patmos for the
[1:27:48] word of God and for the testimony of
[1:27:51] Jesus Christ
[1:27:53] next verse I was in the spirit
[1:27:58] on the Lord's Day
[1:28:04] you and I would not know that dire
[1:28:07] condition conditions of this aisle if we
[1:28:11] didn't read about it
[1:28:14] brother branham gives us a little bit of
[1:28:16] things are in there you try to study it
[1:28:18] out in history you don't find much on
[1:28:20] patents Paul John did not make it a
[1:28:25] point to emphasize his circumstances
[1:28:29] this is talking about already life I'm
[1:28:33] talking about already life a life that
[1:28:36] is so yelled to Christ to where it
[1:28:39] begins to in more and more it's losing
[1:28:41] sight of self
[1:28:44] because he this was his testimony he
[1:28:47] knew why he was there but John didn't
[1:28:49] say I'm here because some guys disagreed
[1:28:51] with me but you know what they never
[1:28:53] give me a chance to talk they didn't
[1:28:55] even give me a chance to prove myself
[1:28:56] them guys are so wrong they shouldn't
[1:28:58] this was not how it was if that would
[1:29:00] have been John's attitude he would not
[1:29:02] have been wrote I'm here for the Word of
[1:29:04] God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ
[1:29:07] and we certainly wouldn't have had I was
[1:29:09] in the spirit and we wouldn't have had
[1:29:11] the Book of Revelations
[1:29:13] remember was not the revelation of st.
[1:29:16] John the Divine it was a revelation of
[1:29:19] Jesus Christ this is the one book that
[1:29:21] Jesus broke personally himself what was
[1:29:28] it circumstances
[1:29:33] think of how that Paul would write this
[1:29:37] let me just close Paul would write and
[1:29:44] we've referred to this many times you
[1:29:46] know it in second Corinthians 12 this is
[1:29:49] we're just talking about this the life
[1:29:52] that's been lived unless I should be
[1:29:55] exalted above measure through the
[1:29:58] abundance of the revelations there was
[1:30:01] given to me a thorn in the flesh the
[1:30:03] messenger of Satan to buff at me lest I
[1:30:07] should be exalted above measure for this
[1:30:11] thing I besought the Lord thrice but it
[1:30:15] might depart from me you know his eyes
[1:30:18] would come and go and he said unto me my
[1:30:23] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[1:30:29] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:30:34] most gladly therefore will I will I
[1:30:37] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[1:30:41] power of Christ may rest upon me that
[1:30:45] very thought the power of Christ you
[1:30:47] know what that speaks of it speaks of
[1:30:50] like the tabernacle and the tent of
[1:30:53] meeting set down where Christ comes to
[1:30:57] meet
[1:31:00] Paulsen Paul was not thinking God for
[1:31:04] the infirmities what Paul was saying
[1:31:06] I've asked God for a complete
[1:31:08] deliverance in other words it ain't
[1:31:10] coming back no more but it's come back
[1:31:12] and I prayed and it's got taken away and
[1:31:15] God let him know Paul I heard you I know
[1:31:20] your requests but my grace is sufficient
[1:31:27] it didn't mean that Paul didn't pray for
[1:31:29] his eyes no more what it meant is Paul
[1:31:32] would did not allow the infirmities and
[1:31:35] the situations in that of his life to
[1:31:39] stifle his life the attitude that we
[1:31:43] take in circumstances can either invite
[1:31:46] the power of Christ or it can keep it
[1:31:50] away that's what Paul's talking about
[1:31:54] what invites what invites the power of
[1:31:57] Christ not our power our our weakness
[1:32:01] invites his strength and I don't know
[1:32:06] about you but I think I can say for all
[1:32:07] of us I realize right now more and more
[1:32:10] Nord I need your strength I need your
[1:32:15] help Lord as I'm listening and greening
[1:32:19] and taking in over the word I find
[1:32:20] myself over and over looking back and
[1:32:22] say God help me help me Lord help me to
[1:32:27] die more to myself Lord Lord God give me
[1:32:30] grace Lord God help me Lord just so lay
[1:32:33] aside my will or God say brother Samuel
[1:32:41] you're kind of a little bit of it you're
[1:32:43] a little bit of a determined person a
[1:32:44] little bit of an organized person but
[1:32:46] that's not what the accomplishment of
[1:32:48] Christ is in my life
[1:32:49] that's him if I try to put that in
[1:32:53] anyway I'll get right in his way just
[1:32:56] like you or me in our temperaments and
[1:32:59] our makeups but remember it must be
[1:33:01] Christ fulfill it but we have to
[1:33:03] surrender we have to ask and ask God the
[1:33:06] Lord help me
[1:33:11] what a testimony theevans 3:1 for this
[1:33:18] cause i paul the prisoner of jesus
[1:33:23] christ for you gentiles i don't think i
[1:33:29] don't feel like i got words to express
[1:33:32] what's in my heart when I've looked over
[1:33:34] these things I said God how did Paul be
[1:33:39] moved by the Spirit of God here was a
[1:33:41] life that was already yuck to you as a
[1:33:44] prisoner but in these times would
[1:33:47] express the very life the very life an
[1:33:52] expression of that character and nature
[1:33:55] of Jesus Christ it would Express that
[1:33:59] the walk of a believer and Hera's Paul
[1:34:03] for this cause i paul a prisoner of
[1:34:07] jesus christ for you gentiles was Paul
[1:34:13] saying is something about me it was
[1:34:15] about his will for you it wasn't about
[1:34:20] what I wanted it's what he put in my
[1:34:23] heart
[1:34:26] no wonder Paul could write later on down
[1:34:29] in Philemon just a few verses below that
[1:34:31] opening verse one
[1:34:33] you would say yet for love's sake right
[1:34:36] into Philemon yet for love's sake I'd
[1:34:39] rather beseech thee beings such as one
[1:34:40] as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner
[1:34:45] of Jesus Christ circumstances not
[1:34:51] convenient circumstances that were not
[1:34:55] conducive or things that would been have
[1:34:58] been elected to be
[1:35:01] but as a believer
[1:35:04] or they're gonna let circumstances
[1:35:06] dictate our praise or they're gonna let
[1:35:11] circumstances dictate whether God can
[1:35:14] move or not the Word of God is not bound
[1:35:18] I'm not just talking about circumstances
[1:35:21] of where we're all in our homes and not
[1:35:23] able to gather here that during this
[1:35:25] period of time we've been in quarantine
[1:35:27] or however you whatever you want to say
[1:35:28] it stay at home water I'm not just
[1:35:30] talking about that I'm talking about in
[1:35:32] circumstances that are things that are
[1:35:35] not
[1:35:39] welcoming to that of the natural man
[1:35:45] circumstances as I said like Paul was in
[1:35:47] Paul was not in the wrong
[1:35:50] but even though Paul was not in the
[1:35:52] wrong and those who had accused him were
[1:35:54] but Paul said I didn't appeal to Caesar
[1:35:57] so that I could accuse my nation this is
[1:36:02] a heart that is full of the love of God
[1:36:07] this is what we want this kind of a life
[1:36:11] this to be a prisoner to be so tired in
[1:36:15] this manner is that what you want
[1:36:19] that's my heart's desire let's pray
[1:36:23] father Lord Jesus sometimes the Lord
[1:36:30] words it just just seemed to fail me
[1:36:35] Lord to capture these things Lord but
[1:36:40] yet Lord in my heart just so moved
[1:36:44] or God in looking upon Lord God the
[1:36:49] prison epistles but especially Lord as
[1:36:52] you had led me here in this of
[1:36:53] Philippians just seeing Lord God how
[1:36:57] that Paul Lord is expressing we see the
[1:37:00] expression this is not something that
[1:37:02] he's telling us do this do that no no
[1:37:05] this is an expression a life of a
[1:37:09] prisoner on display it was not Rome that
[1:37:14] we see we don't see Rome displayed in
[1:37:17] these verses of Scripture
[1:37:20] what we see is a display of a prisoner
[1:37:26] of Jesus Christ
[1:37:29] lord help us
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] help us to be so
[1:37:37] so bound so yoked to the Spirit of God I
[1:37:41] think of how your profit would word it
[1:37:44] and Christ the mystery he would preach
[1:37:47] that in the same message at the times
[1:37:50] that he would preach perfect faith how
[1:37:53] can overcome and right before he
[1:37:55] preached that of Christ the mystery he
[1:37:57] had preached Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:37:59] Christ and then kept drawing off of that
[1:38:02] inspiration I think of it your prophet
[1:38:07] would come back and he would refer to
[1:38:09] that message of Christ the mystery of
[1:38:11] God revealed as his seventh seal message
[1:38:15] a life over and over he would express it
[1:38:19] how it's a life that is yoked to the
[1:38:22] word not a life that you live yourself
[1:38:25] but Christ lives lord help us to yield
[1:38:33] help us Lord God we want to grow we want
[1:38:38] to continue to grow maturing Lord God
[1:38:43] becoming more yielded to where it's not
[1:38:47] about our opinions
[1:38:50] even in situations Lord that we could be
[1:38:54] absolutely right help us lord help us to
[1:39:03] have the right heart in those times it's
[1:39:08] very easy for our flesh for our feelings
[1:39:10] to be pulled in a manner as to try to
[1:39:13] prove our side of the point or to try to
[1:39:16] put ourself in a good light lord only in
[1:39:20] a do all we do in that manner it's only
[1:39:23] giving in to the flesh that's all it is
[1:39:27] I pray that you'll help us Lord God help
[1:39:30] us lord I pray from this that you spoke
[1:39:34] to us tonight that we might glean from
[1:39:36] this
[1:39:38] what God to not allow the circumstances
[1:39:43] to hinder your desire
[1:39:47] to work in Our Lives Lord even in the
[1:39:52] midst of this time that we've been in
[1:39:54] even in the midst of tests and trials
[1:39:56] that have been before it and if you
[1:39:58] tarry Lord in our lives tests and trials
[1:40:01] that will face if you tarry in this
[1:40:03] coming year until you come help us lord
[1:40:07] I pray help us or God at circumstances
[1:40:14] we will not allow circumstances to
[1:40:17] dictate
[1:40:20] but may we Lord look and say father what
[1:40:27] would you have me to do what's your
[1:40:28] purpose
[1:40:30] leave me Lord
[1:40:32] maybe Lord god there's someone rare
[1:40:34] right now maybe right there in the hold
[1:40:37] and a point Lord God that they maybe
[1:40:40] don't even feel Lord it seemed like
[1:40:42] maybe for a time that their Lord God
[1:40:44] that they've moved in a place where
[1:40:46] you've led them and you've opened the
[1:40:48] door but it's just in that time it's
[1:40:50] been like they seemed like all alone I
[1:40:53] pray God maybe they've taken courage for
[1:40:56] tonight and look back to you and realize
[1:41:00] Lord God when you open the door
[1:41:03] as you let them Lord into that door
[1:41:07] they're looking to you to guide them may
[1:41:10] they just wait on you Lord may they look
[1:41:13] to your Lord and ask Lord God that your
[1:41:15] purpose would be fulfilled in their life
[1:41:19] help us to die more to ourselves Lord
[1:41:23] that you might receive glory and honor
[1:41:27] Lord were not ignorant of the
[1:41:31] behind-the-scenes many times no doubt of
[1:41:35] how Paul himself would have different
[1:41:37] feelings things would come about but we
[1:41:40] don't read about that
[1:41:42] but we know it was still there the Lord
[1:41:47] God the same one who would write by
[1:41:49] inspiration and speak to us about
[1:41:53] mortifying the members of our body

[1:41:58] us he knew that by experience of what it
[1:42:04] was like when he felt down when he felt
[1:42:07] discouraged he knew what it was to be
[1:42:11] able to look to you and say Lord I know

[1:43:03] impossible River
[1:43:09] you think one for also body need
[1:43:17] mountain
[1:43:19] you can turn
[1:43:24] God specialized in
[1:43:28] [Music]
[1:43:29] influenced our impossible

[1:44:06] God specializes
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:28] and I believe there's so much we can
[1:44:30] learn from this the Spirit of God would
[1:44:33] want to teach us sometimes we look at
[1:44:37] situations things as I said that can be
[1:44:41] said this was done wrong this was said
[1:44:45] wrong times we look at the situation's
[1:44:48] and we're looking for things and how do
[1:44:50] I correct this Samuel how do I correct
[1:44:53] this they sent this wrong or they did
[1:44:56] this from sometimes we become vexed with
[1:44:59] trying to straighten out a situation
[1:45:02] when we should first of all pray and say
[1:45:04] God
[1:45:06] is this an opportunity that I need the
[1:45:09] love of God to temper my life a little
[1:45:11] more that's the first thing is being
[1:45:15] certain of God said Lord temper me out
[1:45:18] of this situation don't always look at
[1:45:20] it that it it's the other person well
[1:45:22] they're wrong don't always take that
[1:45:23] part but look at it closely look at it
[1:45:27] let God examine your heart in your life
[1:45:29] because God might allow that situation
[1:45:32] it can allow that to temper you to
[1:45:35] temper me to see just exactly what we're
[1:45:38] gonna do about it
[1:45:40] think of how that David when David
[1:45:44] walked out of the kingdom that day and a
[1:45:46] man spit on him and one of David's law
[1:45:49] young men to his sword and said shall I
[1:45:52] let that dog's head remain on him David
[1:45:54] said lay below the Lord told him to do
[1:45:56] that brother Adam tells us he'd just
[1:46:00] been talking to brother lavell this is
[1:46:02] the account he gives in Christ the
[1:46:03] mystery and here he is he said brother
[1:46:06] Vale came to him after a time and said
[1:46:08] how can you happen how can you let
[1:46:10] people talk about you how can you let
[1:46:12] him say those things about your brother
[1:46:14] branham Buddha Ram said not even
[1:46:16] thinking about what he had just said
[1:46:18] when they were eating lunch about David
[1:46:21] he said it came right out of my mouth he
[1:46:23] said let him alone the Lord told him to
[1:46:26] do that
[1:46:28] I'm talking about a readiness for
[1:46:32] readiness that is Yelp to the very
[1:46:35] nature and character of Christ or glory
[1:46:40] be to God
[1:46:43] this is their that's the kind of
[1:46:45] prisoners we want to be we want to be
