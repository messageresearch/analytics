appreciate the warm welcome acceptive Spirit want to say God bless you we had some special meetings in our area they're back home over Bible believers had four day meetings still going on so we were fellowshiping with different ones of the Saints over there in that area and different ones said to greet the church and send their own Amen it's wonderful to be part of a body so we want to say God bless you we just appreciate you appreciate brother browning and Trust the Lord will bless him where he's at I believe in North Carolina right which is a meeting so man we know God will use him has used in God bless you this morning let's go right to the word in this wonderful 8th chapter of Romans Romans 8 and we're gonna take the 11th verse down to the 19th verse we just asked for the leadership of Lord this morning the Bible says but if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you then he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen amen that's what the Holy Ghost is given for to be a sign in our hearts a witness a man a voice on the inside testifying who we are where we have come from who we belong to what kind of a life is in us and if we are children then we are heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen creation is groaning for you my friends my brother my sister creation is groaning for you let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord and and for the life that's in this word Lord if it was just a dead letter to us we wouldn't waste our time with it father but over and over and over again by your supernatural power father by the reality of your presence Lord by the clarity of your voice you have opened this word to us Lord and proved it to be the same yesterday today and forever and so Lord we're believing in you Lord we are your children your Holy Ghost on the inside bearing witness of who we are who our Father is Lord and so we want to exalt you this morning father above everything Lord even our own opinions our own preconceptions Lord any baggage that we might have carried into this place Lord every burden every hindrance Lord may be laid down at your altar I pray this morning and Lord we want to surrender ourselves to you and as we sang father give ourselves completely unto you father give ourselves away Lord that you could use a slore to be glorified in us I pray Lord this morning you would start with me father may it be the cry in every heart Lord start here speak to me father speak to my situation in my need and Lord just bring an encouragement if it's what I need Lord bring a rebuke if it's what I need but Lord whatever happens may it be your will father and your way that's our desire Lord as your believing children this morning we dedicate ourselves to you father and may faith rise in our hearts Lord that to omnipotence would meet in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you as you're seated and and just bear with me for a few moments there's a little bit to unpack here on this but I just want to take my time here at the beginning and explain to you kind of where I'm coming from and I've been been speaking to some young people recently and I and I just had a little thought in my heart on on bloodlines on the power of a bloodline you know and and you know that all nature every creature every everything on the earth has a certain life that's in it has a certain nature certain genetics a certain makeup you know that and certain characteristics that are passed down by blood and so that's something that the Prophet spends a lot of time on talking about the life of the blood the power of the blood and and you know I don't think that's just an accident that that was part of nature and part of creation but I believe that it's something that's very it's very core to the nature of God to the desire of God it was something that was important enough to God that it was one of the first laws that he ever established over the earth when he said let every seed bring forth of its own kind amen amen and that's why a cat will never have puppies and a dog will never have kittens it's a law right it's a it's something that has been put into nature and and so everything whatever kind of a life is that's in it if it reproduces itself if it ever brings something forth it will always bring forth of the same life amen so a dog will give birth to a dog and a horse will give birth to a horse and deity will give birth to deity amen amen and so God is interest and it's important to God to keep the bloodlines pure that's why I hey wait you have many things around the Christian faith that revolve around sexual purity and and keeping those things sacred it's not for it's not some man trying to control you but it's something that God has in his mind that he's trying to bring forth amen and so there's a great question there's a great concept or a great issue in Christianity that revolves around this and that question is what kind of a life is in you not what kind of a church identity you have or a social affiliation or or who your pastor is or what your family name is or any of those things but but what Christianity is asking what the Word of God is asking what God a man is trying to manifest in your life is what kind of a life is on the inside of you amen amen what kind of life is in you and we know that anyone who's born into this fallen world amen no matter what kind of a background they're from or what kind of a person they are all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God we are born in sin shaped in iniquity amen and so we have nothing in this flesh that can lay claim to anything beyond a beast nature that has fallen it's corrupt it is susceptible to sin amen but but thanks be to God has made a way amen that we could escape the law of this flesh and the law of this sin and that he has placed something on the inside of a Christian heart amen that that speaks of higher things it's a it's a call in our heart that says we came from something higher than the dust of this earth and it's corruption oh my hallelujah but but see we're living in a sinful flesh amen and that's where all the problems are and we know that it that so we find that it's not about a lifestyle or a culture or a law or rules and regulations it's about a life it's about a nature amen it's not just the actions of a sinner that are corrupt but it's the fallen nature on the inside that's what makes a sinner amen brother Bram said when you sin it's because you're an unbeliever that you do that because if you gamble he said.you you lie you steal those things are not sin amen but it's the results of sin it's the attributes of sin it's the characteristics of that life and that's because brother brown said that in you Wells a different spirit amen so what we need friends Amen it's not a it's not a Reformation it's not not not rehab Amen churches are not a place where we turn over a new leaf and amen and we tried to bring a five-step plan to to salvation and perfection you know but but a church is a place where we come to get our nature changed amen to to supernaturally amen take the laws of this flesh amen and submit them to the Spirit of God and it brings a nature change amen and that's the problem with religion and religious spirits and church affiliations many times because because what about grants a said religion is a covering is that right amen and one thing I've learned in my young life is that religion can hide a lot you can hide a lot of sin and a and a lot of hypocrisy and a lot of terrible things go on in this world hidden behind a veil of religion Amen and you can hide behind it and find your comfort behind it but there's nothing about a veil of religion that can do anything for you unless the life behind the name that you put out on the front of your church amen the life behind the name that we seeing in the name that we read about the life behind the name is what makes the demons tremble and it's got to live in you amen Oh hallelujah that's why we stand in defense of the Pentecostal experience amen even though the word Pentecost has become a dirty word around this message amen but I still believe in an experience Amen according to acts 2:38 that is to everyone amen it began without an ending it's to all times to all places to all peoples that's a direct quote Amen the Pentecostal blessings must remain upon the church because it is the Pentecost see it's not an emotion it's not clinging to an emotional experience it's not a work up or a culture Amen or or a fanaticism Amen or something about shouting or dancing or screaming but it is the life amen the light behind that Pentecostal experience the change of that nature on the inside is what is essential it is necessary Amen it is inescapable amen Oh hallelujah rather Bram said he's rebuking the church in this quote he says if you had to say you were Pentecostal it would dampen your spirit amen unfortunately that describes a lot of message churches I've been to and but he said that kind of spirit ought to be dampened amen you say it kills the spirit any spirit that could be killed by the name of Pentecost ought to be killed hallelujah that's right Pentecost is not an organization Pentecost is an experience that comes through all the born-again children hallelujah I believe that the true Church of God has always gathered under the reproach of the Pentecostal experience amen hallelujah that's all oh my it's never been the elite of this world or the dignified but Christianity is a religion for slaves and low lives and lowborn people amen they call them holy rollers and fanatics amen and emotional but under the reproach of that name is where God changes the fallen nature of this world into the substance of sons and daughters of God hallelujah even the Pentecostal organization today they've tried to wriggle out from under that mockery amen under the under the reproach of that and they've turned they turned the real experience of God into fanaticism and foolishness and it's a far cry from the book of Acts but there is a true church on the face of the earth amen Pentecost is more than a name more than an organization but it's a reality of a life on the inside that has changed in from creatures of this world to deity and flesh amen the real Pentecostal born-again amen and that's what it will take to overcome Laodicea that's what it'll take for the bride to take her position is the kind of power Amen that Peter had that that Paul had the life that makes the demons tremble amen oh my we begin to when you begin to study that early church and brother Brown said that spirits never die and you can take the spirit that's in you and you can compare it to what God did in Jesus day amen and you find your identification in their spirit amen and if we are nothing more as message believers than a bunch of quote quoters and a bunch of holy livers and a bunch of dress writers amen and a bunch of tradition keepers amen then we are nothing more than a bunch of Pharisees hallelujah but the true church of chav of God will always be found under the zeal and the power and the reality of the Pentecostal experience hallelujah under that reproach glory to God I will continue brother sister to preach and promote the baptism of the Holy Ghost until the coming of the Lord I know there's false teachers that want to put it back amen in some bygone day but it is still the prescription today it is the only thing that can take this fall in human nature amen and transform it into the kingdom of God it cannot be rehabilitated it cannot be learned it cannot be educated it's got to be killed a menace stripped away it's got to die daily so that the power of God the life of God on the inside can come forth a man hallelujah oh my the Holy Ghost produces manifested sons of God amen dead religion is only ever going to produce a bunch of Pharisees hey man there's a lot of people on this world that have bitterness against religion Amen they're there they're mad about religion mad at Christians and you can't even blame them amen because we're hiding a bunch of fallen nature behind our religious veil amen and it is no substitute for a new birth you must be born again hey man Oh hallelujah brother branham used the reves the type of Balaam and and Moses the false church and the true church amen and we find out that there's many people that can preach the Bible right they've got the right doctrine they've got the right understanding but they're missing that life amen and it's so close a man till it would deceive the very elect hallelujah and they had a Christ period that's deceptive it's not a pope on a throne Amen it's not some fanaticism it is a spirit that will come into a message Church and tell you because you're sitting in the right pew and hearing the right preaching and quoting the right quotes that everything's okay with you amen and you don't need a real experience you don't need to go to an altar a man that that's a for a bygone day Oh far from it brother Bob said we find that Moab was an it was an illegitimate Amen but it was just as fundamental as Israel was but Israel who had the true bloodline amen and my title this morning is it's in your blood it's in your blood but Israel who had the true bloodline had signs and wonders following them they had divine healing they had the shout of the King in the camp they had a smitten rock for their salvation they had a heavenly father feeding them from above they were having a glorious time amen and that's why many times you go to a Holy Ghost meeting and you hear people just whooping and hollering and carrying on and you wonder what it's what what's going on and you wonder what the reason is it's because it's because there's something in their blood amen there's something in that bloodline of legitimacy amen it's a reality to them it's not some old tradition or some dusty old doctrine or something that makes us a slightly better Church than the Pentecostals amen but it's a life on the inside and oh it's glorious hey man if we don't go by emotion but we have a lot of emotion Amen because we have so much reality and we have so much revelation amen oh I can't understand how somebody could know what we know and see what we see and just sit there with nothing in their heart to respond amen when every word of God that comes off the page just blows me up on the inside I cannot contain it friends amen there is something glorious about it amen because there's something on the inside of me that bears witness that I belong to this bloodline that this thread of redemption a man is running through my veins spiritually amen and I'm a part of it hallelujah oh brother Graham said they got the same altar the same God but one was wrong and one was right and the way that you tell which one is right and which one was wrong brother sister amen it's not about fundamentals it's not about preaching the right things teaching the right things because brother Bram said when it came fundamentally to the word both of them were right but one his motives were wrong he was trying to cut his his brother off from the line of promise that God had given him that's how you always tell the true church from the false vine is because you'll never take a true believer and take away the promise of God he'll never he'll never surrender he'll never compromise he'll never know never budge on one thing that God has given him amen and today the promise is still true that there's a Holy Ghost that is promised to you and your children and as many as our fathers God shall call it is still the truth brother sister I don't care how many preachers try to take it from you try to stamp it out try to quench the fire amen it is for the believer and every true believer will not compromise with that religious formal starchy spirit amen but we want the supernatural amen we want that pillar of fire that made the difference between Israel amoeba Oh a real God who heals and speaks and saves and delivers amen hallelujah oh another thing the prophet of Balaam was fundamental but the prophet Moses was identified by the characteristic of God not by doctrine but by characteristics by a nature hey man there was the pillar of fire supernatural light hanging over them there were great healings in their camp a supernatural God showing supernatural signs and they were staying exactly what the word a promise that God gave Abraham omi I exhort you brother sister this morning don't budge on God's promise amen don't get complacent don't get lazy and this layout of seeing confusion amen but hold fast amen to that to the power of this message Amen at all and believe in that pillar of fire believe that it comes to church on Sunday morning amen and he touch his broken hearts hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever his word never changed but people change churches change expectations change but God is just as powerful to save now as he ever was Oh glory to God amen hallelujah you're too late to tell me that God doesn't move anymore in Holy Ghost meetings hey man I heard the man say unfortunately oh why do people send their youth down a youth camps you know and get them all emotional and worked up and that doesn't do anything for them you're too late to tell me that wait a minute it was a Holy Ghost meeting at a youth camp where God called me to preach it was a holy goal few youths meeting a man where God filled me with the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost meeting when he delivered me from fear it was a Holy Ghost meeting when he's touched my life time after time after time that is able to change your life hallelujah to reality anybody who's ever experienced you can't take it away from them you can't talk them out of it nobody ever talked to me do it in the first place but it's the reality of a genuine experience with God something you can hold to something that will hold you when you can't hold yourself absolutely I know what I'm talking about this morning don't ever let anyone take away the promise from you the Holy Ghost what is it what is the Holy Ghost given for the Bible says that we are given all these great and precious promises we're supposed to cling to amen and of being these promises we have been made partakers of the divine nature of the divine nature so a born-again Son of God not just an emotional church member not just a screamer or a shouter or a dancer but they have been born into a bloodline amen amen that comes with attributes of a nature that is not of the earth but it is the nature of our Father in heaven hallelujah we are the sons and daughters of God the offspring of Jehovah partakers of the divine nature and that promises to you if you can believe it oh and that old sinful nature has perished forever if you've been born again that old guy that you were born with and you've drug him around and he's been a problem for you and tormented you a man he died hallelujah Amen hole can you just imagine friends maybe you got a temper maybe that maybe you got certain attributes in your flesh and you know how bro grams spoke of that cycle generation after generation how those things are handed down through the bloodline maybe you got a temper and you thought it was just you but come to find out your daddy had a temper and your granddaddy was a murderer and and all the way up the bloodline of back generation after generation of Rage and murder and temper and anger until it hit you brother sister hey man until it struck that Holy Ghost and and there's enough power in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that those things which have been soaked that law of the of the human bloodline that has been strong enough to hold true all the way back to Adam down to you but what the Holy Ghost is broken broke the cycle that's the power of the blood amen when you get this blood transfusion amen it forces out all human nature all human weakness all those things pass away and spiritually you've been grafted in to the lineage of God amen and the things Amen that the things that used to rule you rule you no more because you're no longer associated even with that name or that life Amen I know this flesh will rear its ugly head that's not what we're talking about today amen we're talking about your soul amen belongs to God there is a life on the inside that is more powerful friends amen more powerful than the law of this flesh glory to God even though it torments us but it cannot rule us Satan cannot have us we're not subject to it and the reason we don't have the victory many times is because we don't realize it and believe it not because it's not true but because we don't realize who we are Amen hallelujah the blood the bulls and goats could never atone for you could never break the power of that bloodline what do we have a kinsman three men a kinsman redeemer and the blood of that kinsman had a power in it oh my to to prove that you are his family to prove it he was the firstborn among many brethren amen hallelujah and there was the beginning of a new creation in God hallelujah amen oh you just think of that old name that you were born with hey man it's some of you young people carrying shame and carrying guilt and under such a burdened day today feeling bad about yourself and and feeling weak and feeling overcome and not realizing when God baptize you with the Holy Ghost that that old name and that old nature passed away forever and you're no longer known by that name and God doesn't see you by that name but you are known by the name of Jesus Christ because when you are born again you are married to Christ and call by his name and so when the devil comes around with a delivery of guilt or the delivery of sickness or delivery of bondage you can say return to sender hey that guy doesn't live here anymore but the person that's living here is known by a new name lorry to God we are identified in Christ Road Ram said not even sin is imputed to a genuine believer oh my one of these days we ought to believe this one of these days we got to get around to taking God at His Word when a prophet said Amen that he that born of God does not commit sin the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sin see you don't desire it Amen now to the world you might be a sinner but to God you're not we need the Holy Ghost we need the moving of the Spirit amen because that's what God is looking at not you or I are mistakes or our failures or all the things that were attached to that old name that thing's dead to God amen and you're living in Christ crucified in Christ and now it's not you doing the works but Christ liveth in you glory to God Oh Church Oh bride know your position amen I believe that that what that's what's holding everything back brother band said when the bride realizes who she is then the rapture can go and we're just about there brother sister the only thing lacking is for you and I to wake up and then realize who we are realize what the word is spoken about us and believe God for his word amen he has not called you sinful he has not called you weak he has not called you the disgraceful or ashamed but he has called you wholly accepted beloved Amen you are the bride of Jesus Christ amen you are in Christ brother Graham said when Jesus went to the cross he went there with you in him amen if there ever was a Eve inside of Adam then there was a bride inside of Jesus Christ and when he died you're so identified with him by the new birth that when he died died with him a manner when he rose you rose with him in victory and the power of sin was broken in him for you and for me and for everything that we have need of glory to God God had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female and it was all redeemed in that one body a man you see they are one the same word brethren said the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the bride can you imagine friends you are so one with Christ that the very word of this Bible that speaks of Jesus Christ speaks also of you you have a right to it you are an instrument of it it speaks of you Alleluia the true Church of Jesus Christ the bride he said her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her but she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect [Applause] hallelujah in fact in her is summed up and manifested the eternal wisdom and purpose of God amen this is not something brother sister that's out of reach this is not some presumptuous thing I know to the denominations it's a bunch of heresy amen it was just like when Jesus said I and my father are one they couldn't take it amen but the bride the true believer amen has a little bit of ambition about her to believe what God said about her hey man I know it seems so high but it's not high because it's the very purpose and the very wisdom and the very desire of God's heart from the beginning before there was a world God in his hearts uttered words and and I would took a prophet to look in the back of God's mind and realize the we are dealing with a God who has desired a family of his own and there is no power there is no hell there is no brain that will keep him from acclaiming there will be a bride and she will manifest the very attributes of God it must come to pass for it is his will Oh hallelujah brother Graham said Oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one hallelujah amen oh when and when when he came down from heaven said this is my beloved son and brother Brown said heaven and earth embraced God a man husband kiss but everything that was in Christ he has poured into the bride Alleluia oh my and we are in the embrace of a loving groom Amen who has who has who has attributed to us every word that was spoken of him amen hello all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church God and man together that was to be the super sign of the last days when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days hallelujah in the days of the bodies of the seventh angel the mystery of God the desire of God the purpose of God shall be revealed [Applause] everywhere that speaks of great speech of you hallelujah with a glory hallelujah the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride we have the attributes of Christ amen or whether you believe it or not it's true amen whether you feel like you can accept it or not it's true it is the desire of God the purpose of God amen it's for you to accept don't listen to the devil and all the doubts that he's feeding you amen you are the children of God these things are not beyond you it's in your blood it's in your blood it's in the lights it's on the inside it's all in the Holy Ghost has nothing to do with you or your ability or who you think you are but it's where you came from it's who your daddy is Rory to God [Applause] oh yeah I want to share a little story with you it might not mean to you what it means to me but to me it was powerful you know you know I was talking to my dad one day and I got a good dad I hope you got a good day but I got one of those dads where you think man if I could ever be half the man he is I'll be happy but it just seems impossible he's such a he's such a fine man you know and I admire him so much and one day I'm talking to my dad and you know I was feeling is just so bad about myself over some things just something not sinful things but just things in my nature and things of my character that bothered me you know just procrastination and trouble focusing you know those little things that just bother you and I'm just complaining my dad and I almost didn't tell him you know because I you know I look up to him so much I wanted to be proud of me I almost didn't say anything but I said dad you know I'm feeling this way I'm feeling that way I'm always dealing with this I think and you know what he said to me and like I said it might not mean to you what it means to me he said son I've always felt the same way [Applause] amen it's something kind of woke up on the inside and I said you know this didn't who I am that didn't come from nowhere it didn't come from no place but I came from somebody any men and if there's attributes in him that I admire a man then I got to believe that I can be like him because I'm my daddy son oh my that's why i speaking not robbery to call myself married to Christ hey because I know where it came from and the voice on the inside tells me whose son I am so I have to believe that if I let these attributes have their way amen it will result in a manifested son glory to God oh don't you love him amen and you find that these characteristics they don't come by working harder and trying more and striving in a greater way amen but you know when you well you're the most yourself when you are at peace when you begin to rest you know whenever I'm concentrating or thinking about something I'm little off lost in space somewhere lost in thought wow I start biting my nails and you guys do that you start biting your nails well and somebody say just stop doing that I would why don't you just quit biting your nails and but I don't realize I'm doing it I can't stop because you know it's when I shut off my mind when I shut off my thoughts and when I just go to rest and who I am there's a nature on the inside that just gets the Viton amen and I believe when a son or daughter of God begins to stop worrying stop fretting stop trying so hard stop trying to make themselves something they aren't and just rest on that Holy Ghost nature on the inside I believe if we would list more we could manifest more Amen I believe we just relaxed in his presence more those attributes would be manifested in a greater way I know it's simple friends but it's the truth we tried too hard we worked too hard we've got to trust in the life that's in us hallelujah amen everything that speaks of the groom speaks of the bride just think of the power of that friends that everything them in the Bible every precious saying every word of power that was spoken of Christ amen by a prophets message it's been given to you it's attributed to you you're of the same life amen so why don't we just talk about his attributes for a little while why don't we just fellowship it around you know one of the attributes of Christ is he holy amen amen just to think what a holy God that we serve and I believe a true holy life is not from trying to follow a tradition but it's from a revelation of how holy he is and that he has chosen to be present in us amen and that makes you a holy temple not because of the of the substance of this earth but because of a holy God on the inside he's so holy a man you know that he's holy you felt his presence and come before his throne many times in such a way where it's beyond the worship beyond the praise you get to where brother Branham said when he came into the presence of the Lord he said it and never gift he said it's happened since I was a little boy and I've never gotten used to it amen oh and that holy presence prophets fainted Amen they passed how they shriveled in fear in the holy presence of God amen but by a message we come to find out that that attribute of holiness is an attribute of this bride it's a powerful holiness for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him amen accepted friends he became sin that we might become his righteousness and so we are not a filthy people we have nothing to be ashamed of we are as holy as he is holy Road ran said you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of a son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in his blood and believes every word of God stands as though you never did it in the first place this is not forgiveness this is justification this is redemption this is a total restoration hallelujah you are not attributed to your sin and your past and your mistakes and your failures you are attributed to the holiness of God not because you deserve it because you are identified in here oh we got to take hold of it a man we don't see that sinless perfection in the flesh like he had but it come to find out that the sinless perfection that was in him is identified in us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are all by being a son or daughter of God we are justified never did it in the first place we are holy as he is holy without spot without wrinkle that's not for the future time that's not for that's not for heaven that well now we are in heavenly places and the way of God looks at you now is not through the filter of your faults or your sins or one spot Amen but you are unblemished in His sight and he has called you accepted in the beloved I know you didn't feel that way when you showed up to church this morning but it was true then it was true when you were down it was true why you were discouraged you were beating yourself up and the whole time what I'm telling you was true it will never stop being true a man any more than you could stop being your father's son or your father's daughter but because of who you are and where you come from and the life that's on the inside of you God can only see you as perfect hallelujah part of him a part of my savior a part of his word you know with another attribute of Christ he is eternal he is eternal remember everything that's spoken of him spoken of you and he is eternal he never had a beginning he never had an end the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh the Bible says this Melchizedek without father without mother I'm talking about you now without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God and a bite of a priest continually hallelujah amen that's what a prophet came to tell you he came to preach who is this Melchizedek and show you that in an eternal God was an eternal seed that never had a beginning we'll never have an end and he said you were sons and daughters of God before there was a moon stars were a molecule you are sons and daughters of God for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that were in God at the beginning before there was a devil before there was sin before there was weakness before there was pain there was a bride there were sons and daughters of God shouting for joy waiting to be manifested amen I don't mean to presume this morning but I was just imagining earlier back in the office and how that God maybe he took one of the Archangels aside and he said it all all Gabriel you know I want to tell you about something I've got in mind I got somebody in mind a first down there laodicea a man you know his name his name is gonna be William Gabriel said oh you mean oh yeah William you told me about him the one down in Jeffersonville no this one's in Sheffield amen he's a little bit taller he's a little bit darker but whoa wait till you see him any man hallelujah he's a gay but I got one of mine brother Joe sway and and he's got the I'm gonna put the the mark of the masterpiece on him and he's gonna have a natural peace and joy and being encouragement to his brethren and all you're gonna love it Gabriel winner when he that Matt then flat becomes manifested a man I got one a name in mind his name's gonna be Brian he's gonna be a big one hey man and I got a little lady in mind for him and they're just gonna go together so perfectly hallelujah amen Gabriel Sam oh it sounds so wonderful Lord but he said gay we'll just wait till I speak it the power will never hold it you are eternal as he is eternal long after sin and death are gone you will be when it's all over with when the pain the sufferings of this present time are no more we shall be glorified in him we shall be part of him we always were part of him Amen come to find out by this message I'm not the son of Brian Lucille Eriksen but I come from a long line of God and you come from the same lineage Alleluia that's where we come from that's where we're going that's who we are we got certain attributes certain characteristics that are not of this earth they are not of this natural world but another attribute of Christ he is supernatural and if he is supernatural so are his brethren amen saw his joint-heirs if he is supernatural you are supernatural amen hallelujah I know we make these things rare and uncommon but that's on us amen but but the thing is and come to find out it's in our blood to be supernatural to see the supernatural Bible said the thing that Jesus did all the things which aren't even written if they should be written the world itself could not contain the books that would be written behind Jesus Christ and he's the one who said you would do the greater works hallelujah amen you get quiet like you're wondering about it amen but you can wonder all you want to it's true and then it's the truth amen it's what the that's what a prophet taught us amen it's what a message came to reveal to us amen and we make these things on common we make them unattainable but I'll tell you what a prophet said he said if you've got the Holy Spirit what is the qualification what is the what is the the restriction he said if you have the Holy Spirit then you are a candidate for Association with the unseen world and the supernatural amen you don't have to be a prophet you don't have to be a soothsayer Amen you don't have to be a minister but if you have the Holy Spirit amen if you've been born again into this bloodline then you are a candidate for the unseen world and the supernatural because it has nothing to do with the natural amen but it has to do with a supernatural life that's in you hey man he said no wonder people can't believe in those things they've never come into contact they have nothing to believe with but that doesn't describe you amen you've got Christ the believer in you amen and you've got all the faith that you need to overcome the devil amen people say well I wish I had more faith I wish I had stronger faith if I had strong faith if I had faith and you know I could really do something for the Lord amen but just the act of saying that proves that you're believing somebody amen the problem is you're putting your faith in the devil and the very faith you're putting in the devil to speak words of doubt is all the faith you need you just got to put it in the in the in the Word of God amen and that faith will become omnipotent hallelujah it will change your circumstances when you begin to believe God's Word for you you are supernatural people hallelujah brother Graham said there's got to come a church again where the barriers will be broke and the Holy Ghost level right away amongst the people and when you do you will see the same signs and wonders that happen back there in them days say men a man when a prophet said that it was enough for me not to put the gifts back on the shelf not to put signs and wonders back in another day I believe the gifts are for the bride hallelujah amen and the but the problem is I know the reason we not seeing it is exactly what he just said we've got to let the Holy Ghost have the right away not our church order not our opinion not our idea our comfort zone but let the Holy Ghost lead the church and if we surrender to that life and that power then we would see the supernatural we would expect the supernatural it would become more common amongst us if we would if we would take our eyes off everything else amen and just look to Jesus look to his word hallelujah let the Holy Ghost have the by the way I cannot understand why people educated by this message would want to stomp out the moving of the spirit and somebody get a little excited and you try to tamp him down say now brother now sister we got to take it easy we got to be reverent you know oh my Amen when he wants to have her right away in the church he wants to have the preeminence and when a preeminent God becomes preeminent in his bride Amen then the government will come down upon his shoulders and we would see the supernatural works same signs same wonders same same supernatural the same sensation that's a direct quote hallelujah wasn't it supernatural when he changed your nature if you out of oh my anybody who's ever had a nature change ought to believe in a miracle a minute to think about how it never ceases to amaze me how God can take somebody amen and Alcoholics Anonymous in 50 years cannot reform a man they cannot make that man anything but an alcoholic they can keep him dry for 50 years and he's one drink away from sin amen but God in an instant in a moment in a blinking of an eye can take a sinful life amen and strip the things of the world from it and turn it into a son or daughter of God what a miracle amen then it's a small thing for God to heal you it's a small thing for God to deliver you it's only one of the minor benefits of salvation of redemption Alleluia if he's powerful enough to call you out of this world and keep you in a way that no man could pluck you out of his hand then he's powerful way to flick away the little devils that are bothering you those little imps of hell they're nothing before a supernatural God who has ordained of people to stand on the earth and overcome Laodicea an invincible army hallelujah for the Son of God Jesus Christ was not yes and no not sometimes yes sometimes no but if you're in Christ then in him is yay for all the promises of God in him are yay him amen unto the glory of God by attribute number four he is victorious [Applause] hallelujah the Bible says he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men amen thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world hallelujah amen Oh glory to God you are of God little children that's why you've overcome the wicked one because you are of God of his loins how there's reproduction you are the children of God hallelujah anyone who is in Christ is walking in victory I don't care what your experiences are what your thought about it if you're in Christ you are victorious amen as he is victorious all power that sin held over you was loosed from you it was abolished under the death of that old name and if you were in Christ you are no longer subject to hell Amen if you make a mistake that's one thing but one thing is for sure you do not have to swerve that devil you do not have to serve this flesh you don't have to be subject to its impulses you are children of God you are in Christ and he is the captain of our salvation he is the mighty conqueror and through him we can overcome I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me now the lujah Road Rebbe said I already have the victory oh no now I'm going to get the victory not I'm going to win the victory now we got a fight and we might win he said I already have the victory he is my victory [Music] he's the victorious one and you evidence of his victory he said the bride is his victory amen if he's called you out of this world and put the Holy Ghost in you and bringing out forth the attributes by the light of the message amen the attributes of Christ in you then we're already winning amen we already won we read the back of the book and spoiler alert you win we win we've won it was finished at Calvary there's no chance of defeat there is no hope so but it was finished for the believer at Calvary and we are resting in his overcoming power he said I'm an evidence of his victory he see he died for the purpose of bringing forth a bride that's why he died that's why he did it you think he'll fail and his purpose the one that was powerful enough to go into hell and take the keys from the devil amen and overcome the power of sin hell and the grave and death amen and rise up in victory Amen that mighty conquers not going to lose you he's not going to let you be plucked out of his hand no brother sister here all we rose in victory with him we were identified in Christ when he rose absolutely the truth amen you are his victory you are what he has at what he fought to produce to thank the evidence of his victory I was just up salmon fishing up there in Michigan a few weeks ago didn't catch one you know but I was marveling at his powerful fish you know and those they're just there's a power in them amen wanting to wanting to bring forth that's he live that that that desire to reproduce themselves it drives them up little creeks and rivers straight up waterfalls they'll climb things that people would have fought impossible nothing will hinder them a mint from getting to that place that they have in mind amen and bringing forth that next generation of the of that bloodline amen and forth of joy that was set before him Jesus endured the cross amen and overcome sin hell and the grave to bring forth the body believers yeah that are the issue of his loins they are the manifested attributes of God the children of God absolutely how could that how could it fail amen it is the great drama about which the world was framed amen the stage of the universe was set for Christ and his bride amen this great love story Amen it's whoa it's so engrained in the heart of God amen that there's nothing to do but fall back in the arms of grace and thank him that all of all the dusts of the world that you and I were in his mind a man that you and I were called to be his victory hallelujah oh and if we are as victory what could stand in our way there is no weapon that can prosper against this bride she cannot fail to reach the goal hey man I believe it I believe in eternal security that's too much grace for some people but that's the kind of grace that I need amen hallelujah can you imagine amen all the things that brother Branham preaching this message over and over again talked about your predestination your election your eternal security and even teachers around this message would reject that amen peanut brains oh brother Nathan that's me that's a direct quote brother Brad said some peanut brain out of some manufactured seminary somewhere can't see God's election but I'll tell you what we'll let you see your election amen the Spirit of God on the inside crying Abba Father and then a spirit that cries out amen a bloodline that speaks better things than that of Abel crying out saying I know where I came from amen and if I came from there I know I'm going back to there and there is no there is nothing of this earth that's going to shake me hallelujah hey man then we can do the impossible another attribute of Gov Jesus he walks on the water hey man he walks on water he walks on stormy seas he does the impossible and I marvel to think how that walking on the water is something that we refer to today as a metaphor for the impossible something that is out of human reach amen but I wish to remind you this morning that when Jesus called him Peter walked on the water to and as long as our eyes are on Christ there is no obstacle there is no way there is the storm that can take us under but every time we feel ourselves sinking under the weight of this Laodicean age all we've got to do is look to Jesus and he's beckoning you my child just step out in faith just take another step and you'll feel yourself getting higher when you should be sinking when you should be drowning you begin to rise above it all hallelujah oh my that means something to me this morning thinking about how I've been through some hard trials in this past year and we've had a rough time and my family but when I feel those waves get to rocking what it tells me I must be being rocked in the sovereign waves of grace hallelujah and there is nothing that's going to sink me because there's an anchor on the inside that's holding me when I can't hold myself gazed into the abyss and I know brother sister if it was up to me to hold on for myself I would already be gone but there is a power there is a life there is the nature of let me go and he will not let you go hallelujah Laurita go hey man I'm not mad I'm excited hallelujah the same Jesus who spoke to the storm said if you say to this mountain you say to this mountain that's because the attributes of storm speaking Mountain diminishing are attributes of you amen attributes of an overcoming victorious God is the attributes of a bride there's nothing that's gonna sink you brother sister you might as well stop being scared you might as well stop worrying you might as well stop letting the devil torment you and believe the Word of God it cannot change it will never pass away heaven and earth will pass away under your feet amen this earth Amen will pass away before you will pass away part of my savior part of his King part of his word attribute number five you love him - Amen you enjoying this hallelujah I love to find out what the word says about me amen attribute number five he reigns he reigns he rules brother Brett said we've got a kingdom and we have got a king and it cannot be moved and when there is no more world when there is no more politics when there is no more nations Oh can't wait God will set up his kingdom and the righteous will reign with him and those ones who have suffered will suffer no more amen Daniel 7 says the kingdom and dominions shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey Him amen oh he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even if I am sit with my father in his throne oh if you are in Christ that you reign with Christ you are called to a throne brother sister we are no longer called servants we are called friends we are called his bride absolutely the truth amen no wonder when we come to church with Amen and when we go about our day we ought to praise Him we ought to lift him up we ought to exalt him because the higher that he has exalted that higher you and I are exalted in him hallelujah Amen the greater that he is the greater you and I are for we are identified in our bridegroom that's absolutely right amen there's a there there's a whole race of people upon the earth Amen that's sing out allahu akbar amen and worship a god that they believe is great and the greater that they make Allah the lower they are amen no greater that they make him the lower database are shells but let me tell you the glory of Christianity amen though this mystery among the gentiles hallelujah that the higher that Jesus Christ is exalted the higher the bride is exalted in from the earth I will draw all men unto me hallelujah glory to God he humbled himself to come down to us amen and now that he is exalted he has exalted us in him absolutely amen I know I know what I'm saying brother sister the Bible says he doesn't share his glory with another he is a great and Unser passive God amen but we have this hope of glory Christ in you the attributes of God in you the bloodline in you joint heirs with Christ what do you think the word meant when it called him the king of kings what do you think it was referring to when they called him Lord of lords hey man it's the bride it's the son that God is a God called to reign with him when the sufferings of this present time are over there's a throne waiting for you and I amen I just trust a man that while we're here we could win a crown not for our glory but sold them when we get to that place we got something to throw at his feet amen and lift up our Redeemer lift up our king a man who has exalted ups far beyond what we deserve we didn't even deserve forgiveness but he went beyond forgiveness and has justified us and has made us one with him and granted us to sit in his throne and rule over the world he reigns and you reign oh he is high and lifted up and you are lifted up in him little bride we ought to praise Him hey man we ought to worship Him nobody can lift a man up like his bride amen amen nobody's nobody's complements nobody's worship nobody's praise means means anything like the bride a man when a man's wife begins to work Moe he begins to praise him and begins to say good things about it begins to love him amen publicly and vocally amen it does something to a heart of a man what does it do to God to see his people of his hearth amen whoa whoa whoa just worshipping him thinking him for his grace thinking it for his mercy Amen just humbly worshiping him for what he has done amen and if we have a message today that has brought us a further light it should bring a further praise amen the Bible said up there in the book of Revelation they were worshiping him old blessing and honor Dominion and power amen be unto God but when he stood up and took the book hallelujah then they sing a new song amen oh then we got to worship the bride there ought to be a not be a people on the face of the earth that would put us to shame with their worship ain't meant knowing what we know seeing what we have seen because when he took that book their song changed their worship change it took on a greater revelation because they said you have made us kings and priests unto our God we can worship Him like never before because we have been lifted up into the heavenly places of adoption and we are sitting as sons and daughters of God brother Branham said right now we are kings and priests ruling spiritually over a spiritual Kingdom offering up spiritual praises that are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ let's all stand let's all stay hallelujah brother sister it's time to recognize who we are hey man you know there's nothing about you that's different from any of the rest of his children we make ourselves small but you know you might be here in this place God just pooping on your heart touching you encouraging you dealing with you and and you in this place in your body and your life and the circumstances around you you're no different than Peter was when he came looking for him amen young man young women you're no different than any of those apostles when Jesus came their way and they didn't think anything special about themselves they didn't think there were anything exceptional anything great amen but when he came said follow me there must have been something about it when they took a step amen into that discipleship took a step into the footsteps of Christ it must have felt right it must have just there must have been something on the inside just echoing saying this is where I belong this is you know there's something about what brother Nathan is preaching it so it's so it's too marvelous to imagine that that the words that are spoken of Christ would speak of me but something feels right something feels correct something my heart's bearing witness that's nothing less than the then the spirit of son same in the spirit of adoption within you crying out for your father saying Lord I'm nothing I have no ability I have nothing to offer but I believe your word Lord and let that life on the inside oh let's make it our prayer Lord let that life on the inside come forth Oh God and may it ride all human nature all human ability all human fear and worry and attributes Lord and let the attributes of Christ that you've ordained before the foundation of the world be revealed in this vessel Lord I feel almost too humble to ask for it Lord but but yet your word has promised it you have desired it it has been your purpose and your wisdom before the foundation of the world Lord let us walk in it let us walk in the reality of who we are granted Lord Jesus I'm not on any ego trip I'm
