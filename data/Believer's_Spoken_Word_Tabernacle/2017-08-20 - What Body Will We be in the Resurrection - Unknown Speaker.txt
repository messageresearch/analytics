to worship You Lord Lord now we've come to the place where we're expecting you to speak to us Lord and I pray their God you'll anoint me Lord that you may be able to speak to the people encouragement and uplifting and strength and I pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen well you're standing if you could turn feed your Bibles to Genesis chapter 3 and I want to read verses 8 through 11 but I want to speak on this morning is something that you already know about I'm no doubt many of you already know and their Bible students of the Bible and maybe it might be something that would help the young people as well but I believe that it's something we can all glorify God in and what I want to speak on is in what body in what body shall we be in the resurrection y'all excuse me it must be a good message verse 8 and they heard the voice of Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden the Lord called unto Adam and sent unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told me to doubt was naked house now eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat may be seated in what body shall we be in it says they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden who's ever heard a voice walk before God came down every evening and walked with them there's men with them and cool of the evening and what body did he come down and walk with them he couldn't come down as just the great all eternal God in his in his presence and just walk with him that way but he actually walked with them and they heard him walking in the garden he was walking and as the often he for come down because God who he really is the title of the form he really is I'm telling you a man can never be able to comprehend that's why that he had to come down and flesh in the body of Jesus Christ so that man could finally touch God one day the Lord appeared to Abraham and the plains of Mamre Abraham was setting out in front of his tent and he saw three men come walking and when he saw them approach I believe that his attention was drawn more to one than the other because he said my lord if I found grace in thy sight come and tarry with me let me fetch a little water to sit under the tree under the shade here let me fetch some meat for you to eat and sup with me that was not that was God but not in the form of the great LOM he had to take a form a body to come down and be able to set with Abraham and talk with him and he took on at the often II form it's the often ybody to be able to come down and walk and set with Abraham and talk with parents me to Exodus chapter 33 I want to read verses 12 through 23 and Moses said unto the Lord see thou sayeth unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom that will send with me yet thou has said I know thee by name and thou has also found grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that I might know thee but I might find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is I people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and Moses says here and he said unto him if thou if thy presence go not with me carry us not a pence for wherein shout be knowing here that I and I people have found grace in thy sight is it not in the Dow has goest with us so shall we be separated I am thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou has found grace in my sight and I know thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I'll proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou Canas not see my face for there shall no man see me and live the Lord said behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put me in the cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand whilst I pass by and I will take away my hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen what kind of a body did Moses see when God passed by now there was a reason that he said he would not allow Moses to see his face this was speaking of a time to come when God would allow man to see his face but he looked and there was at the off and he body standing there that Moses saw he said what looked like the back parts of a man oh one day he came walking across the stage brush field to our prophet and he saw a man standing there and brother branham said looked it was on his face and he said the closest that he has ever saw was a Hoffman's head of Christ - depicting what he looked like turn me to Psalms Psalms chapter 27 verse 5 for in the time of trouble shall he hide me in his provision and the secret of his Tabernacle say hide me he shall set me upon a rock I really brand him read this scripture when he preached the message of the rapture and the time of trouble that is coming is the tribulation period and it said but will be hidden during that time in his pavilion the secret of his tabernacle then he said shall he hired me he shall set me up upon a rock that takes place when you receive Jesus Christ in the truth of this endtime you are in the secret of his Tabernacle in the secret what is the secret of his Tabernacle that he isn't dwelled in the third part of man his soul and in the soul you have a relationship with Jesus Christ and come to know him for who he is he reveals himself to you turns me to 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 and I want to read verses 1 through 10 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 where we know that in our earthly house of this Tabernacle if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens now he's talking to this tabernacle he's talking about is a body there's a secret to this tabernacle for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found nected for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burped not that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up in life now he that hath wrought us from the self same thing is God who also given unto us the earnest of the Spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord I was talking about this Tabernacle this is an earthly tabernacle says if this body be dissolved we've got a body waiting on us that was not made with hands and it said there's something in us that longs not to be unclothed meaning from this body but to be clothed with the new body to be clothed upon with a body that's unlike this body and that it's a perfect body but as long as he said we're in this body were absent from him before we walk by faith not by sight Amen I'll tell you what that is the Christians walk that's the key to to understanding the Christians walk that's the key to overcoming is knowing that we walk by faith we're not walking by understanding of reasoning and anytime that something comes to you to try to get you to begin to reason about things no all that is is the enemy trying to work in that reasoning gate of your spirit to try to trip you up because we walk by faith not by things we see but we walk by things that we do not see blessed is he that hath not seen yet believes we are confident I say willing rather to be absent from this body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to what he had done whether it be good or bad the scripture just told us we're looking for a new body a tabernacle not this earthly tabernacle but a tabernacle that's not made with hands home from the heaven that's the body that you will stand there in on that day not this body this mistake written written badi we won't stand there in this body but all those who do not have the earnest and he said the earnest of the Spirit who we have brought us the self same thing who has also given unto us the earnest of the Spirit those who do not have that will stand there in the very body they committed the sin in they won't be able to deny what they done because they'll be standing there in the body they done them I don't know about you but I got things that's in my memory that I would rather not have in my memory I got things that I've done that I wouldn't want anybody to know anything about sin corruption of that old man who I've already buried but his deeds still remained in my memory and it was in this body that those deeds were committed I'm glad I won't be standing there in [Music] I'm glad that I will have a body not made with hands a body that is metric oldest in the body that's never made a mistake I give glory to God for you young people to give your life to God in a young age and and never went out to taste of the world I give glory to God for you and I encourage you keep going forward but even in that you know you won't want to stand there at the body you're in now for this body you make mistakes and in this body this body is an imperfect body it grows old you'd be surprised how fast time passes by pardon me it seems like that it was only yesterday that I was a young man here in this church it doesn't seem like and there's there's something in me that doesn't feel old I know that this body gives me aches and pains and this body reminds me that I'm not a young 19 year old boy anymore well there's something in me that's still that same person it doesn't have to do with what I'm physically you're not physically able to do now it has to do it there's just something in me but when I look in the mirror I see a stranger that's that's not me that's not who I was I knew when I was a young man I was gonna lose my hair and when I got married I was 19 years old just a month from being 20 and I would tell my wife up when I look at him and I said he's still gonna love me when I lose my hair and she would tell me I didn't marry you for your hair and that was hard for me to understand that because I was proud of my hair I spent time combing my hair washing my hair and making sure it was just right she said when she met me she said you're the first person I have ever met that couldn't walk past his own reflection without checking your hair make sure it was in place we'd get off a roller coaster and I would look for a mirror somewhere so I can check my Hara maybe that's one of the reasons I had to lose it I was too vain maybe but that's a young man I remember that's who I remember that I am and I feel like that I'm still that young man just trapped in an old body but I'm looking forward to one day breaking free from these bars of all these walls of clay that has me bound I'm looking forward from breaking free from that thinking on those things I couldn't help but think about my dad he's already broke free from his box bought that house of play hallelujah we were helped been helping my mom to move into their new home and she said she wish dad was here and I thought the same thing to enjoy it but then I thought the what he's enjoying now is far beyond this world far beyond that new home that new house he's in a new house house not meet with hands I thought about that song there would be a song that would be son from the person who has crossed the river Jordan is on that other side and maybe looking over the banister time back at their level said I wish you were here and I thought if if he couldn't speak back to my mom though she said she wish he would been here to enjoy it he would say I wish you're with me to enjoy this home to rid me to st. John chapter 5 I want to read verses 24 through 32 29 verse 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life verily verily I say unto you that hour is coming now watch this he speaks of three resurrections in this scriptures the hour is coming so that's a time of Resurrection that yet coming and now is so that's a second time or another different complete different time of Resurrection when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they shall live so the one is he said is yet coming but there's one that's going to happen right then the end within the hour that he's there for the dead that word from the Old Testament that died under the blood of bulls and goats when Christ came forth from the grave they came forth to and they were glorified there with him and caught up with him into heaven but there's one yet coming that's the one we're waiting on that's the one word looking forward to is that resurrection that's yet coming that time yet when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear it shall live whereas the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself and have given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man Marvel not at this for the hour is coming now here's the third resurrection he talks about for the hour is coming in the which that which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice now the ones that are going to hear his voice in this resurrection will wait on right now are those who have received eternal life that have passed from death unto life and they shall not come into the judgment because they've already been judged here before they died and went on so when they come forth in that resurrection they're not coming forth in a state in which they can be condemned in because they will not come into the condemnation but these he's speaking of here into 28 verse Marvel not for the hours coming which all then in a degrade shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation that is the third resurrection the resurrection of all the ones who resurrect in this resurrection we're waiting on are the ones that we will be changed with and caught up together to meet Christ in there those are the ones we'll be with at the wedding supper and we'll be there in a body and we'll set there and we'll protect of the wedding supper the marriage supper of the Lamb oh what a time of fellowship that will be there's a picture of my mother has that she's had since I was just a young boy and it shows a table and it's supposed to be the table of the marriage supper of the Lamb it seems like it just stretches on and on and on and on in the picture somehow when they made this picture they made it in such a way that it seems like the table is never in meat maybe many of you have solved such a picture and I think of that and I think you know I don't care who was sitting around me maybe I said that when I was here the last time I don't care who's sitting by me I just want to be there and I know this brother branham said and I think I read the quote to you when I was here last and when you receive Christ there's a place for you at that table he said where you'll pull your feet up under it but in the general resurrection the third one that he's speaking of those people they will miss they're going to miss the rapture they're going to miss the Millenium they'll miss the marriage supper and they'll miss the time of the millennium because they will not come up until after the thousand years has passed then shall all the Dead come forth those that have done good unto a resurrection of life you said could it be those that's done good and yet don't make the rapture yes because they were not in Christ they never had that complete relationship with Jesus Christ remember there is a foolish virgin who was virgin only lacked the oil and there are those that the Prophet spoke of he said that when that resurrection takes place the general resurrection there will be those that come up that have done good to the bride and have been good to the bride and the members of the bride will step forward and say father they were good to us they were good to me and they'll receive eternal life there but there's others because all comes forth and those that have done evil they come forth and they stand there in the body that they committed the evil in even these ones that come forth that have done good and come forth the resurrection of life they are standing there in the body they lived in here and then we receive eternal life with those that have done evil they stand there in the body that they committed the evil in and they won't be able to point a finger at you because you will not be there in this body you will not be there in this form it will be a full of flesh but different than what we are now then then it will be perfect it will be glorified I love preaching about this so in case you couldn't tell the Librium says this animus of who is this Mikasa dick and I've read a lot through this message of who's this Melchizedek fine these are many things it's a good message you want to listen to a message after hearing this go listen to that one when the theophany Moses seen him Exodus 33 2 he wasn't the apne Moses wanted to see God he had heard his voice heard him talk to him seen him in the bush there as a big pillar of fire and he said who are you I want to know who you are Moses said if you'll let me see you I would like to see your face and he said no man can see my face he said I'll put my hand over your eyes and I'll pass by and you can see my back but not my face and when he did it it was the back of a man it was at the often II then the word that come to Moses I am that was the word the word came to Moses in the form of a pillar of fire and in a burning bush the I am as the word from the theophany he came to Abraham as a man under the oak tree now look there came a man who they ever had three of them sat down under an oak tree three of them and noticed after he talked to Abraham why did he come ever have been one with promise and the message of the coming Sun and also he was gods profit that was trusting God's Word calling anything contrary as though it wasn't see how perfect the word is the word came to the prophet see there was God and at theophany the Bible said the word come to the Prophet and here was the word in the theophany now you say was that God Abraham said it was he said his name was he he called him out on him now Genesis 1 you find out in the beginning element created heavens and earth in Genesis 18 we find out that Abraham called this person and they're set there and talked to him and could tell him the secrets of his heart tell him that Sarah was thinking behind him ever have said its ello him he was in it the often e-form you get it now we find out that he was then in the theophany form he called him Lord God lol now in Genesis 18 we find that it's true and notice Abraham there was three of them together but when Abraham met the three he sent my lord but when lot down in Sodom two of them went down their lot saw two of them coming he said my Lords she what was the matter the first place luck was not a prophet that's right neither was he a messenger of the hour so he didn't have any revelation of him lot not being part of the bride that Abraham is the type of Abraham and Sarah typed those who are going to receive a body change lot types those who are not going to receive a body challenge before company in that resurrection lot the see was not a profit that's right neither was he the messenger the hour so he didn't have any revelation of him it's exactly right lot called them lords could have been a dozen of them and he still said Lords but no matter how many Abraham saw it was still one Lord there is God this was the Melchizedek notice after the battles over Melchizedek served the victorious child communion think of that part of himself now we want to see here in the types here in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is part of Christ and after the struggle is over after you've done got yourself whipped out then when you partake of Christ and become part of this beam he serves us of himself that brings to light except you eat the flesh drink the blood of the son of man you have no life in you now we see the attribute sons of his spirit not enter into the ward form body but if he often he the body is subject to the word earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning to worry speaking about Christ in morph a body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek then later we never hear no more of Melchizedek because he became Jesus Christ no cousin ik was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypassed that you cook like Adam like me you became from the attribute of flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word now we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the work but look and clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you kept me word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down to here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and I will raise him up at the last days see you had to be first so in order to be able to know you have that theophany body you first must have been in his thoughts if you if the person was not in his thoughts predestinated bride of in these ages and they don't have a theophany waiting now listen to this then after you've recognized the very word of God was eagle food then you left the other thing you have been formed into a living image of living God you heard from your theophany if the certainly body be dissolved we have one waiting how do I know I have a theophany because I heard this word and I recognize it to be true because in the face of all that are falling away from this endtime truth and they're turning their backs on it and walking away and saying things against it we still stand quiet because it wasn't just some new thing that we did it wasn't just some new traction that we do it was a revelation well devil I'm gonna preach it anyhow [Applause] that's just old body testified we heard from our theology it wasn't just us trying out something new we heard from something that let us know this in time it was true and people can say well what about this this seems like a discrepancy no aside what about this what about the parts in the scripture which seem to be if you would have been standing there on the date when he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no part with him no life what would we have thought we look at that Scripture now we have understanding of that Scripture but they didn't have it then they didn't know and they weren't supposed to know until after Jesus was glorified then after he was glorified then they come to know what it meant they even when he served them communion they still hadn't caught the connection between except he deflesh the son of man and the communion they hadn't caught the connection he was until after where he was glorified that they got they received the earnest of the Spirit they couldn't receive the Holy Ghost until after Jesus was glorified and after you recognize the very word of God was eagle food you left the other thing and you know what I'm not going back to the other thing there I don't care how many go back I'm not returning back to that vomit I have received revelation that this is true and it goes beyond words and you know something just you don't have to be able to explain it in order to say I've received a revelation that is true somebody can come up to you and friends look some of them could come up and try to stump you this is the thing I have received the revelation that this is eagle food what's the difference between you and them you heard from your theophany that's why you know it's true not just because you heard it with these ears and understood it with this heart but because there was something of representation of you that was on the other side that's there waiting for you and it spoke to you there was a deep talk and a deep inside responded [Applause] hallelujah you heard from your theophany you say is that right brother Branham let's take a couple of Evil's and look at them for a few minutes there was a name a man called Moses everyone knows that a prophet is called the eagle in the Bible there was a prophet named Moses one day God called him and wouldn't let him go over to the land and he died up on a rock and the angels packed him away remember in Jude it speaks about the devil contending with Michael over the body of Moses why because he said the devil said I have a claim to all that dies under the blood of bulls and goats I am taking him captive there has not been a price paid for sin Michael wouldn't contend with him how did Michael just rebuked him and the Angels went ahead and pack Moses body away didn't don't argue with the devil don't try to reason it out with him don't even bother with it just go on because you know who you are why is this happening why is that happening why because you're in a body of flesh to be tested and there's times of sickness brother Adam said sometimes sickness comes on just to test your faith so that when you have loved that victory you to look back say nobody can tell me the spot so nobody can tell me he's not a healer because I have witnessed it by faith [Applause] there was another Eagle didn't even have to die he just walked across Jordan and God sent a chariot down and this roll of flesh he dropped it and rise and caught the everlasting prize eight hundred years later eight hundred years later on Mount Transfiguration here stood two men Moses body had been rotting for hundreds of years but here he was in such a form till even Peter James and John recognized him if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of God expressed here on earth you've got a body waiting after you leave this world their days was standing on Mount Transfiguration the theophany for they were prophets to whom the word came hallelujah this is a mess of questions and answers Co D book 6200 527 now here is another one the second is like this what manner of body were the wicked have in the last resurrection at the great white throne judgment that sinner will rise in the resurrection to be judged in a body that he has committed the sin in he'll have to stand the judgment in the resurrection resurrection is not a replacement it's a bringing up that which went down when Jesus raised from the dead he was the same body that went down he raised in that same kind of a body we rise in the same body that we go down in it's a resurrection not a replacement now the Bible says that we will be judged according to the sins done in the body even the wicked rises you'll be judged in that same body that he sinned the same thing now for the random speaks in another place that says you first must have a spiritual resurrection before you ever have a natural resurrection now they go down those that died here during this time in Christ they go down in this body that they've lived in but when that body comes up it's not replaced but there's something different about it there's gonna be something different about that body then let's read Saint John in Chapter 7 verse 37 through 39 now we've been studying about the theophany as the body you receive when you leave here if you die and you leave here it's a body that you hear from when you receive this to be true and it's a body that you will have but it's not the body you will stand into the resurrection it's not that can we put it this way it's not the complete body in the last days that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried and said if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which day that believed on him should receive where the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified Saint John 12 verse 16 these things understood not his disciples at first but when Jesus was glorified then they remembered that these things were written of him that they had done these things unto him so the disciples did not have complete understanding even while in Jesus was walking with them here on earth it wasn't until after he was glorified and they received the spirit which he said the Spirit will bring back to your remembrance everything that I've said unto you this look in st. John chapter 20 verses 14 through 17 when she dust said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus sent her to her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposed him to be the gardener she saith unto him sir if thou hath borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away and Jesus said unto her Mary she turned herself and saith unto Him rabona which means to say master and he said unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your God so here he is risen from the dead and he is in a body but that body has not yet ascended to the Father that body has not yet been glorified all it did was resurrect the body that he had died in but he had not a sin unto the Father yet he said touch me not but then later when he appears to them later and Thomas says if it's you Lord let me touch the nail scars in your hands then he allowed them to touch him cover me to Romans 8 chapter 16 I want to read 16 through 23 verse 16 the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us not to us but in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God all of creation is waiting for us to be manifested in a body for the creature was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who had subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body message of expectation brother Branham says now we think be for the grace of God to know that one time we were aliens cut off from God without mercy without hope Christ died for us in our stead bearing our reproach and sins in his own body and knowing someday that he shall come we do not know what we shall be like but we know we'll have a body like his for we shall see him as he is and father that'll be a glorified body free from sickness and sorrow and partings and death our spirits grown for that deliverance so now he's speaking about a glorified body Philippians chapter 3 first or to begin reading at verse 17 17 down through 21 brother and be follow us together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an example for many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ whose end is destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself so as he received a glorified body so shall we Romans 8:29 Romans 8:29 and 30 or whom he did foreknow he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brother moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified now those that have died and went on and are coming up in this resurrection we're waiting on they are in a theophany form now then they come back here to what to receive a glorified body and what is that glorified body it's this flesh except that this flesh the sixteen elements that make up this flesh the molecules of it they're out of order that's why we grow old that's why we get sick that's why we suffer that's why we have pain is because the the alignment of the molecules was thrown off when man fell just as the molecular structure of the serpent changed there was a lecture structure of man that changed because the Bible said that God said in the day you eat thereof that day he shall die no man has ever lived a thousand years Methuselah lived nine hundred and some years he was the oldest one ever but no man has ever lived one day in that day that were born in that same thousand years we die why because of the fall we were not meant to die we were not created to die but we're being restored back to the original this body is suffers now but it was not so at the beginning this body feels pain now but it was not so at the beginning this body gets sick but it was not so at the beginning so in the resurrection that molecular structure of the body is changed back to the way God created it and all the aging disappears all the things of the body being bent over crooked or whatever it disappears and what is it then a glorified body a body of flesh that doesn't grow old that doesn't get sick that doesn't feel pain that doesn't feel sorrow that cannot die an eternal body that theophany therein is waiting to be clothed upon with flesh again but a glorified flesh hallelujah all right I got just a couple of more quotes here man questions and answers one 1954 paragraph 107 he says those whom he called he justified those whom he justified he glorified and every redeemed person in this world this morning that's under the blood of Jesus Christ filled with the Holy Ghost past everlasting life and can you not perish it is already in heavenly places with Christ Jesus and shall never come into combination already redeemed isn't that wonderful seeing already redeemed setting in heavenly places now with Christ and glorified already glorified you say brother bill does the scripture say that Jesus said that or the scripture says that were the wid riders Paul he said those who he justified he has already glorified those whom he fore ordained he predestinated those who he predestinated he justified and those whom he justified he has already glorified what is it oh my excuse me already glorified then if we are filled with the Holy Ghost our fibers and beings are already been preserved in God there is a glorified body already waiting and you have to go to it as soon as this is over those whom he's justified he's all ready glorified so we already have a glorified body who's he talking about now those of us that are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord we have a glorified body what is it this body the molecular structure of its gonna change and when it does age fades all the signs of age is gone this body changes back into the perfect image that he saw you in about the age of 19 years old hallelujah thanks ash is one 1954 paragraph 263 just state the very Lord Jesus that was back there in the days of the Apostles is right here now and it's just winding up the end of the Gentiles a great move is going amongst the supernatural believers because we believe that God is here just think you're glorified bodies right here at the Tabernacle now the presence of the Holy Spirit which is your glorified condition your glorified in Christ right now those whom he justified he glorified and your own glorified body is standing near you right now in Christ to give you strength like a charge going into a battery the holy spirits the holy spirits in you it's to charge your body to give you new strength to heal you from sickness that you've got to make you well so while we're in this state there is something in order to give us charge like to charge into a battery to heal this body from sickness why because there's something there that's testifying of an unsick body there's something standing there is testifying of glorious glorious state that he has for us in what body in what body that's the body we're waiting on I love reaching on this subject I'll tell you what I didn't know exactly what I was gonna preach this morning when I was out I was kind of between two messages and I didn't know which one and when I got here I just was sorting through my folder and felt pulled to open this one up these notes as they begin to read the notes the devil begin to fight me in the back I believe he was reading over my shoulder my nose started bleeding back there I prayed God stopped it from bleeding so I could read over my notes did that same devil you tried to stop it from coming forth but I was determined I needed that the more I knew that the more he fought me the more I knew this is what God wanted I was not gonna give him glory I was not gonna give the devil door and I would give it glory to God are you ashamed I have nothing to be ashamed of this body tries to testify but my mouth was testifying to another body Hey [Music] let's say this song about the theophany what do you have on a team [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
