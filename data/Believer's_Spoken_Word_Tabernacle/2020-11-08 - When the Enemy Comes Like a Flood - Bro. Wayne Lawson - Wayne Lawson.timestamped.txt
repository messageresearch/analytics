[0:00] a couple of scriptures here um Isaiah
[0:03] chapter
[0:06] 59 we want to read from the 19th to the
[0:09] 21st verse very familiar to you I'm
[0:16] sure Isaiah 59 verse 19-
[0:23] 21 so shall they fear the name of the
[0:25] Lord from the West and his glory from
[0:29] the rising of the Sun for when the
[0:31] enemy come in like a
[0:34] flood the spirit of the
[0:37] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[0:40] him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[0:43] and unto them that turn from the
[0:45] transgressions and Jacob sath the Lord
[0:48] as for me this is my Covenant with them
[0:51] saith the Lord my spirit that is upon
[0:54] thee and my words which I have put in
[0:56] thy mouth shall not depart out of thy
[0:59] mouth
[1:01] noow the mouth of thy
[1:03] seed noow the mouth of thy seed seed
[1:05] sayeth the Lord from
[1:08] henceforth and forever
[1:11] more I also want to read Revelations the
[1:14] 12th
[1:16] chapter and the 11th verse I believe it
[1:24] is now of course if
[1:26] you're um reading here uh in the
[1:31] Revelation 12th chapter you're reading
[1:32] about a great battle going on in heaven
[1:34] between
[1:36] angels and then all of a sudden an
[1:39] Angelic battle becomes a human battle in
[1:42] the 11th verse it said and they overcame
[1:45] him by the blood of the
[1:48] lamb and by the word of their
[1:51] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:54] unto death we ask the Lord to bless his
[1:56] words you may be seated this
[1:58] morning
[2:00] I want to just take a few minutes today
[2:02] and speak to you on this when the enemy
[2:05] uh comes like a
[2:06] flood when the enemy comes in like a
[2:10] flood I um I think of the I think of the
[2:14] the promise of scripture I'm I'm always
[2:17] when I read the Bible I read the Bible
[2:20] with promise I I I'm I'm one that
[2:22] believes that if there is something in
[2:23] scripture and God makes a promise about
[2:25] something I want to know what the
[2:26] promises are uh that's where we gain our
[2:29] strength in our life is in the promises
[2:31] of the word of God and and there's
[2:33] actually two things happening here in
[2:34] Isaiah 59 he actually says that when the
[2:36] enemy comes in like a flood then he says
[2:39] the spirit of the Lord will raise a
[2:41] standard against us so there's two
[2:43] things he's talking about he's talking
[2:44] about how the enemy is coming and then
[2:47] what the Lord's going to do right uh if
[2:49] we're not careful many times we get
[2:51] stuck on the enemy coming and we look at
[2:54] that a great deal but we never want to
[2:56] forget that the enemy coming is only a
[2:59] proof that God is doing something in
[3:02] that time if you can if you can see the
[3:04] enemy's doing something then God is
[3:06] doing something in that moment of time
[3:08] it's just trying to identify what he is
[3:11] doing at that time uh when the enemy
[3:13] comes like a flood the prophet of God in
[3:15] the second Miracle will say this he said
[3:17] I'll raise a standard up against it and
[3:18] I believe the enemy is Dashing and God's
[3:21] here to raise up the standard now if we
[3:25] read this scripture in Isaiah 59 and we
[3:27] think about it as something in the days
[3:29] of Isaiah that's one thing but we know
[3:31] that Isaiah was writing about uh the day
[3:34] that we're actually living in and I
[3:36] think it's amazing when you start
[3:37] identifying that some of these
[3:39] scriptures are specific for the time
[3:40] that you're living in and Isaiah 59 is
[3:43] specifically speaking about your day
[3:45] it's it's it was written for this day
[3:48] when the spirit comes like a flood that
[3:50] God would then raise up a standard
[3:52] against him now uh when you when you
[3:54] when you think about this it's actually
[3:56] things that Isaiah wrote but also Paul
[3:59] wrote about them as well for when the
[4:01] enemy shall come in like a flood now we
[4:03] think about it when the enemy if you
[4:05] notice that it doesn't say if the enemy
[4:08] comes like a flood it says when the
[4:10] enemy comes like a flood so it's not so
[4:12] much of a suggestion that that that if
[4:15] this would happen that God's going to do
[4:17] something but rather he's telling you
[4:18] directly that the enemy is coming like a
[4:21] flood so there's an actual direct
[4:23] scripture that is telling you about the
[4:25] coming of the enemy now the prophet of
[4:27] God is going to identify that the
[4:29] believe the enemy is Dashing now now if
[4:32] you go back in the book of Thessalonians
[4:33] and read 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and
[4:36] you can read Apostle Paul would also be
[4:39] talking about this same period of time
[4:41] some of the things that Paul is speaking
[4:42] about about the Antichrist coming about
[4:45] the enemy approaching he's actually
[4:47] identifies it specifically Thessalonians
[4:49] 2 and veres 1-2 you can read the entire
[4:52] thing but notice what he'll say we
[4:53] beseech you Brethren by the coming of
[4:55] the Lord Jesus Christ and by our
[4:57] gathering unto him now we're not going
[4:59] to preach a sermon on that but you that
[5:01] study the message of the hour you
[5:03] understand that's the message of the
[5:05] hour the shout is the Gathering unto
[5:08] Christ and and Paul is predicting the
[5:10] same writer of first Thessalonians 4 is
[5:13] also the same writer of 2 Thessalonians
[5:15] 2 and instead of saying the Lord shall
[5:17] descend from heaven with a shout he's
[5:18] saying you'll be gathered unto the Lord
[5:21] Jesus and that you shouldn't be shaken
[5:23] in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit
[5:25] nor by word nor by letter as from us as
[5:29] the the day of Christ is at hand he said
[5:32] let no man deceive you by any means for
[5:34] the day shall not come except there
[5:35] cometh Falling Away first and the man of
[5:38] sin shall be revealed the son of
[5:40] predition who exalteth himself above all
[5:43] that is called God now just just want to
[5:46] just want to make a mention here how
[5:47] many knows what the prophet said about
[5:49] that that shall exalt himself above all
[5:52] that is called the word of God brother
[5:53] Ram said the word of God all that is
[5:55] called the all that is called God is 1
[5:58] John chapter 1 for in the beginning was
[6:00] the word and the Word was with God and
[6:01] the Word was God so brother Ram says
[6:04] what is happening is is in the end time
[6:06] that that Satan will exalt himself above
[6:09] the Vindicated word of the age amen
[6:12] above all that is called God and he'll
[6:13] sit there and show that himself he is
[6:15] God and remember not when I was yet with
[6:17] you I told you these things and now what
[6:20] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[6:21] his time the Antichrist now shall be
[6:23] revealed in his time how many knows when
[6:25] that was brother BR said when the first
[6:27] seal opened is when the Paul is talking
[6:30] about when the first seal opened now the
[6:32] mystery of iniquity doeth already work
[6:34] and who now will lth will let until he
[6:37] be taken out of the way that the wicked
[6:40] shall be revealed the seventh verse for
[6:41] the mystery of iniquity doeth already
[6:43] work only he who now lth will let until
[6:47] he be taken out of the way now that
[6:48] sounds like a a rhyme or a parable but
[6:51] it's not only he will let until he be
[6:54] taken out of the way there's actually
[6:55] two he's there right he will let until
[6:58] he be taken out of the way now the
[6:59] prophet teaches us that the tribulation
[7:02] period cannot come up on the earth as
[7:05] long as the bride is on the Earth
[7:07] because God will not let the tribulation
[7:10] strike his bride you know the bride of
[7:11] Christ will never go through the
[7:12] tribulation right amen so she she so it
[7:15] can't strike it so God is the one that
[7:18] lets until he be taken out of the way
[7:20] now it's amazing because the church is a
[7:22] feminis and designation right but in the
[7:25] scripture it's now calling you a he
[7:27] instead of a she because there's a
[7:29] marriage of the Lamb that is taking
[7:32] place in the bride and Paul himself is
[7:34] saying at the time of the revealing of
[7:37] the the man of sin the church will be
[7:39] identified as a he and listen to this
[7:42] when the when the devil is coming like a
[7:44] flood am me you already been married to
[7:47] the one that'll take you off of the
[7:49] earth before the enemy can attack listen
[7:52] friend the devil ain't sneaking up on
[7:54] God Amen Paul was telling you all the
[7:56] way back there that there's a day coming
[7:59] amen there's a there's a sin coming
[8:01] there's a there's a flood coming but
[8:03] don't worry the one that can raise you
[8:05] up amen has already been marri to the
[8:07] one and he won't allow it to happen
[8:10] until until she be taken out of the way
[8:14] until he be taken out of the way in
[8:17] second Timothy chapter 3 now that goes
[8:19] real deep amen I don't have time but it
[8:21] goes real deep when when he looks at you
[8:23] he's not looking at you then is he he's
[8:26] looking at he's looking at your
[8:27] representation your repres presentation
[8:29] is not you it's Christ who's in heaven
[8:32] amen and watch this this doesn't happen
[8:35] in just any day but he's talking about
[8:37] the end time and second second Timothy
[8:40] chapter 3 Paul again writing to Timothy
[8:43] this I know this also that in the last
[8:45] days perilous time shall come amen when
[8:48] the enemy shall come like a flood when's
[8:50] that latter days in the latter days
[8:52] perilous times shall come amen was Paul
[8:55] writing about his day he said he wasn't
[8:57] he said in the latter days in the last
[8:59] days that perilous times shall come for
[9:02] men shall be lovers of of of their own
[9:04] selves now I want you to watch I want
[9:06] you to watch the scripture be the lovers
[9:08] of their own selves have you ever seen a
[9:09] day like it today lovers of their own
[9:12] self Covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[9:17] disobedient unthankful Unholy without
[9:20] natural affection truce Breakers false
[9:22] accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of
[9:25] those are good traitors heady highminded
[9:28] lovers the pleasures more than the
[9:30] lovers of God having a form of godliness
[9:32] but deny the power thereof this is the
[9:35] sort that led uh that led captivity
[9:38] silly women made L now we counted what
[9:40] about 25 things there Paul is just
[9:42] naming one after the other what what I'm
[9:44] not just trying to read you something
[9:46] I'm trying to show you there's a flood
[9:48] amen one or two of these things would
[9:50] have existed in other ages he's telling
[9:52] you there's a flood of unbelief in the
[9:55] last days and all these
[9:57] things are coming at the same
[10:00] time and you think now when you're
[10:03] looking at this in you could begin to
[10:05] kind of get a little bit concerned but
[10:06] notice what he says ever learning these
[10:09] will be ever learning but they'll never
[10:10] come to the knowledge of the truth and
[10:12] as Janice and jambers withstood Moses so
[10:14] do these resist the truth men of corrupt
[10:16] Minds reprobate concerning the faith but
[10:18] watch the scripture but they shall not
[10:20] proceed no further Hallelujah for their
[10:23] Folly shall be manifest unto all men as
[10:26] theirs was also now look Janice members
[10:29] was was made manifest their Folly was
[10:31] made manifest and Israel didn't follow
[10:34] them so they did impersonate they'd come
[10:36] as far as they could come but they
[10:37] couldn't go no further do you see that
[10:39] there is a limit to how far the devil
[10:41] can go there's a limit to how much he
[10:44] can do with the church amen listen amen
[10:46] when when the devil went to job uh to
[10:48] God about job what did he do he asked
[10:50] him amen and God said you can touch him
[10:52] but don't touch his flesh and then he
[10:54] come back and said you can touch his
[10:55] flesh just don't take his life what was
[10:57] it it was showing amen that there's a
[11:00] limit on the devil of what he can do to
[11:02] the Church of the Living God God limits
[11:05] the
[11:06] devil the devil tell you he do anything
[11:08] he wants well you know he can't do
[11:10] anything he wants we have a Heavenly
[11:12] Father amen who is The Shepherd of the
[11:14] sheep F amen and if there's anything
[11:17] come your way God has already made a
[11:19] provision for you to overcome whatever
[11:22] the devil can throw at
[11:24] you amen I'm talking about a God that
[11:27] said when the enemy comes like a flood
[11:30] just don't fear little bride the spirit
[11:33] of the Lord will raise a standard
[11:36] against that
[11:38] devil amen 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse 8
[11:41] Peter talks about it be sober be
[11:42] dilligent your adversary the devil as a
[11:46] roaring line walketh about seeking whom
[11:49] he may devire now whom resist steadfast
[11:51] in the faith knowing that the same
[11:53] afflictions are accomplished among your
[11:54] brother that are in the world Amen now
[11:56] look's what he says amen your adversary
[11:58] the devil as a roaring line now if it
[12:00] was just your adversary that's one thing
[12:02] amen but you know that the Old Testament
[12:04] promised that if you obey the voice of
[12:06] the Angel he said your adversary will be
[12:09] my adversary now I I tell you that's a
[12:12] powerful thing when you when you look at
[12:14] if it's just you fighting the devil well
[12:16] that's one thing amen but but he said
[12:18] your adversary is his adversary now this
[12:21] contest is not between you and the devil
[12:24] this contest is between God and the
[12:26] devil it's up to you to be on which side
[12:28] of contest you're on amen amen I thank
[12:31] God today I'm on The Winning
[12:34] Side it ain't what I can do it's what
[12:36] God is done and the contest has already
[12:39] been won that day at Calvary he said
[12:42] it's
[12:44] finished then can I say this morning
[12:47] that the seven seal finishes it the
[12:48] devil is
[12:51] finished when the enemy comes like a
[12:53] flood now I'll tell you if any man here
[12:56] I don't know when he's
[12:57] coming when the enemy becomes like a
[12:59] flood I I think we can say it's right
[13:01] now don't you now and you got to be real
[13:03] careful cuz I'm fixing to pull you into
[13:04] something here amen and I'm not I'm not
[13:06] trying to trick you but I want you to
[13:08] see something cuz I got a lot of people
[13:10] saying to me brother Wayne when that
[13:12] short work comes brother Wayne when the
[13:14] Thunders are released when the Seven
[13:16] Seals when when the bride goes into her
[13:18] Ministry when this great climax comes
[13:20] when this great Rapture when this great
[13:22] Revelation when this great Revival comes
[13:24] do you see the mentality is saying amen
[13:28] that's what God's going to do but
[13:30] they're putting it off in the future
[13:31] somewhere amen but if we could only stop
[13:34] and see that the enemy is already here
[13:37] amen and when the enemy comes like a
[13:39] flood the spirit of the Lord is already
[13:43] on the scene raising a standard up
[13:46] against
[13:47] him amen when the enemy comes like a
[13:50] flood amen the prophet of God said I'll
[13:52] raise a standard and I believe the
[13:54] enemies a dashing yeah amen that's 1951
[13:58] 1962 brother Bram said the greatest
[14:01] battle ever fought when the enemy comes
[14:03] like a flood as he's coming today yeah
[14:07] so he puts the scripture of Isaiah 59 as
[14:10] a current scripture as he's coming today
[14:13] so that are in prison now 1963 brother
[14:15] man said it's a midnight hour it's a
[14:18] midnight hour right Matthew 25 what's it
[14:21] say midnight at midnight A Cry came now
[14:23] notice brother Ram reflects this to an
[14:26] American history lesson about minute man
[14:29] who were in the days of the
[14:30] Revolutionary War when Paul Riv remember
[14:32] he's a minute man he was ready and he
[14:35] jumped on his horse and he went riding
[14:36] through the streets and we all remember
[14:38] what he said the enemy is coming the
[14:40] British is coming the British is coming
[14:42] but brother randam and souls in prison
[14:44] said I am a Paul rever to you in the
[14:47] Midnight Hour I bet he was riding a
[14:49] white horse what you been he was riding
[14:50] a horse amen and he said this he said
[14:53] I'm not telling you he's coming I'm
[14:55] telling you he's here amen I'm not here
[14:59] today telling you the enemy's coming
[15:00] church I'm saying the enemy is here the
[15:03] enemy is here amen the enemy is all over
[15:05] he's everywhere but if that be true
[15:08] about the devil amen then I can tell you
[15:11] that God is here and his angels are here
[15:14] and the Revival of God is here when the
[15:17] enemy comes like a flood the spirit of
[15:20] the Lord shall raise a
[15:24] standard
[15:26] Hallelujah I tell you evil Spirits are
[15:29] working in people everywhere you can
[15:30] look around you don't have to be a a
[15:32] good reader just sit down at Walmart
[15:35] sometime neology pouring itself out amen
[15:39] evil spirits that's true working in the
[15:42] people listen hell has been turned loose
[15:46] brother Brom a a prophet of the age
[15:48] announced all hell turns loose in
[15:52] Junction of time he said when all hell
[15:55] turns loose yeah then all Heaven turns
[15:58] loose also
[15:59] and he ties that together when the enemy
[16:01] comes like a flood the spirit of God
[16:03] will raise a standard and these two
[16:05] forces has always showed up at the
[16:08] junction we're at the junction of time
[16:10] and Satan has come with all of his
[16:12] angels and the devil is attack him with
[16:15] all of his angels but at the same time
[16:17] according to Daniel 12 that Michael
[16:19] would stand up for the people of God
[16:22] them that were found written in the book
[16:25] amen listen I know you think there's a
[16:27] battle going on Amen but I want you to
[16:29] know that the great one has stood up and
[16:33] he's toen your side in this
[16:36] battle when the enemy comes now now you
[16:40] you know the thing about it is we can
[16:41] start putting a number on this because
[16:44] in Revelations the 9th chapter the
[16:46] scripture actually numbers your enemy
[16:48] right I know you can say it's a great
[16:49] multitude but Revelations the 9th
[16:50] chapter said there was 200,000,000
[16:53] demons in Revelation 9 said there was an
[16:55] angel fell from heaven who had the key
[16:57] the bottomless pit how many knows who
[16:59] that was it was the devil it's Lucifer
[17:01] right and he released hell from beneath
[17:03] and it filled the Earth as a smoke amen
[17:07] everything has been affected by it
[17:08] Revelations the n9th chapter and it's
[17:11] 200,000,000
[17:12] Chargers and brother said not
[17:14] 200,000,000 Horsemen they're not all the
[17:17] world he said there 200,000 demons there
[17:20] spirits and the spirits of persecution
[17:22] now we saw them attack the Jews didn't
[17:25] we we saw them shoot them with bullets
[17:27] we saw them burn them with with gas we
[17:29] saw gas Chambers we saw Mass graes we
[17:32] saw persecution like nothing before now
[17:34] why did they persecute
[17:36] them because they were
[17:38] Jews they might have been the best
[17:40] character the greatest people but
[17:42] something inside the German something
[17:45] inside the Italian wanted to destroy
[17:48] that Jewish seed right where did that
[17:51] come from well you can read in the Bible
[17:52] in Genesis the 3rd Chapter and God said
[17:55] there shall be
[17:56] enity between the woman seed and the
[17:58] serpent seed it'll always be there and
[18:01] youve seen it when Abel was killed and
[18:03] you've seen it when Joseph was attacked
[18:05] brother B said why did Joseph's Brethren
[18:07] jump on him in the field he said it was
[18:09] the devil trying to get it that Covenant
[18:11] he was trying to get it that seed that's
[18:13] why that Judas killed Jesus it was the
[18:16] same thing they're trying to kill that
[18:18] word but brother you'll never kill that
[18:22] word you'll never you'll never overcome
[18:24] the word because the word has the power
[18:26] of Resurrection it'll raise itself up
[18:30] from the
[18:31] [Applause]
[18:33] dead ah think about it turn loose on
[18:36] those Jews 200,000 demons go to the
[18:38] Feast of trumpets and you'll find out
[18:40] brother Mar says it's there now now many
[18:42] people and and I don't want to get deep
[18:44] in doctor you got a pastor but I do want
[18:45] to say this many people actually get
[18:47] into the ideas now that those 200,000
[18:50] demons that will cause tribulation in
[18:52] America they'll cause tribulation it's
[18:54] coming to the foolish virgin amen and
[18:56] they try to start applying that to the
[18:58] bride of Christ amen and and I
[19:01] understand that there is spiritual
[19:03] persecution going on right now I get
[19:05] that I get we're persecuted but not
[19:07] forsaken right amen the persecution of
[19:10] that is there amen but the persecution
[19:12] that you have is only the molding of
[19:14] your character it has nothing to do with
[19:16] the purging of your soul because a man
[19:19] that's born again his soul has been
[19:21] purged in the blood of the Lamb of
[19:23] almighty God and there is now no more
[19:26] sin in that man yes sir listen the
[19:29] church is not going to go through that
[19:30] persecution the blood of Jesus perfects
[19:33] the bride that's a quote the blood now
[19:35] now if you're if you're a student of the
[19:37] message and you have people read you and
[19:39] they say well what about these quotes
[19:40] and this but but in the Feast of
[19:42] trumpets 1964 brother bam turns a corner
[19:45] yeah in his teaching concerning what the
[19:48] church will go
[19:49] through and he changes it after that
[19:52] Feast of the trumpet sermon and said the
[19:54] trumpets are to the Jews but the
[19:56] spiritual revelation of the seals were
[19:58] coming for the bride amen is that right
[20:01] so what puts you in the Rapture is the
[20:03] force of God it's not the force of
[20:07] nature
[20:08] persecution now brother Bram says see of
[20:11] course after the seals are open brother
[20:14] bram's going to turn around in the
[20:15] second seal and he's going to tell you
[20:17] very clearly here's my Revelation go in
[20:19] the second seal here's my Revelation he
[20:21] sees it change from White Horse to Red
[20:22] Horse and he says it's Satan
[20:25] again he says it's the devil again in
[20:28] another form so watch The Devil again in
[20:32] just another form so when Satan comes in
[20:35] like a flood it's not it's not that he's
[20:37] a different devil right he's just taking
[20:40] different forms amen now y'all y'all
[20:43] y'all are students enough to know that
[20:44] there's three three connections that
[20:46] he's going to make political power
[20:47] demonic power and religious power that's
[20:49] what he's after all three of those
[20:50] conquering to conquer and he's going to
[20:52] he's going to hit them three phases
[20:54] right there and he's going to lead the
[20:55] whole world into an Armageddon through
[20:57] those three religious demonic amen and
[21:00] political that's where it's going we're
[21:02] going to see it happen and they're going
[21:04] to they're going to lead it but before
[21:06] that can happen the Bible said that he
[21:08] would come as a thief in the night and
[21:10] there would be a Rapture of a bride
[21:12] Hallelujah and she wouldn't be she
[21:14] wouldn't be going there now now if you
[21:16] think about this tonight then or this
[21:18] morning 200,000 demons is against the
[21:21] bride of Christ there spiritual attack
[21:23] it's a persecution and I just have to be
[21:26] very clear here sometimes people will
[21:29] say well I'd go down that church except
[21:31] for Samuel or I'd go down that church
[21:32] except for uh for the song leader I
[21:34] don't like the Deacon or something you
[21:36] know many times that's only a spirit
[21:39] that's against the spiritual genan seeds
[21:41] of
[21:42] Christ sometimes you're looking for a
[21:44] reason and really there is not really
[21:46] maybe a reason but there's a spirit on
[21:49] the person that's right is what the main
[21:51] thing is that's what's happening is it's
[21:53] a spirit now I don't I I I don't have
[21:55] time to get there so you forgive me for
[21:57] not having time to dig into that but I
[21:59] will say this to you sometimes you look
[22:01] for a reason why there's a contention
[22:03] and the only reason is is that there's a
[22:05] spiritual blessing on the
[22:07] individual uh I I've I've had to learn
[22:10] that hard through life and I don't mean
[22:11] that I just mean sometimes I've spent
[22:13] years trying to maybe make somebody like
[22:16] me to only realize they don't like me
[22:18] because I'm a Christian right and I and
[22:20] I corrected everything and I you know
[22:22] almost bow to the person trying to make
[22:24] amends with them and to only realize
[22:27] they don't want aend they want to
[22:28] persecute they want to hurt they want to
[22:30] destroy but it's the spirit of the age
[22:33] that we're in amen and the only thing
[22:35] you can do is just serve the
[22:37] Lord just serve the Lord with all your
[22:40] heart amen now notice this because amen
[22:43] I I I hate to say this to you this way
[22:45] but hell's going to be against
[22:47] you you won't have to do anything you
[22:50] won't have to start any wars this is an
[22:52] old Feud they hated your daddy they
[22:54] hated your grandpa's they hated
[22:56] everything in your spiritual genealogy
[22:59] and the devil's going to hate you he
[23:00] hates everything you stand for he hates
[23:02] everything that you are amen that Jesus
[23:05] himself said in Matthew the 16th chapter
[23:07] he said it like this he said the Gates
[23:09] of Hell will be against you amen the
[23:12] Gates of Hell will be against you amen
[23:15] do you know this the gates of hell is
[23:16] not today it's not against that Jesus
[23:19] Christ even was a Son of God it wasn't
[23:21] against it's not against Paul it's not
[23:23] against Peter it's not against James the
[23:25] gates of hell is against the word made
[23:28] flesh
[23:30] today I hope I hope I didn't lose you in
[23:33] that last thought I hope you're with me
[23:35] amen the show the Gates of Hell will be
[23:37] against it do you see that it's a it's a
[23:39] spirit that's against the church amen
[23:42] and the prophet of God said see It'll be
[23:44] against the spiritual revealed
[23:47] word it'll be against the spiritual
[23:49] revealed word amen what is it it's the
[23:52] revelation of the word in its season in
[23:56] Matthew the 16th chapter it'll be
[23:57] against the revelation of the word in
[24:00] its season do you can I can I can I can
[24:03] I maybe take some pressure off and
[24:04] saying this EP fisan chapter 6 verse 10
[24:06] to vers 13 Paul said this wrestle we
[24:10] doing this this war that we're having is
[24:12] not against flesh and
[24:14] blood it's not against flesh and blood
[24:16] it's against principalities and powers
[24:18] and darkness and spiritual wickedness in
[24:20] high places that's why he said to you
[24:23] take on the whole armor of God do you
[24:25] know right now you're in a battle now I
[24:27] don't have to tell you that you know
[24:29] that it's a spiritual battle more
[24:31] pressure than there's ever been on the
[24:32] end of age see but he says Paul says to
[24:35] take on the whole armor of God that
[24:37] you'll be able to withstand the devil in
[24:39] the evil
[24:40] day in the evil day that's your day
[24:44] that's the day you're living William
[24:46] brandom a prophet of God announc to this
[24:48] generation that Satan is the God of this
[24:52] age he announced to you you are living
[24:55] in Satan's Eden you see he's announcing
[24:59] he's letting you know this is the evil
[25:01] day if it's the evil day then we've got
[25:03] to take on the whole armor of God we got
[25:06] to know who the enemy is and we got to
[25:08] know what our armor is amen you say
[25:10] who's the enemy it's a battle the
[25:12] prophet of God said you got to know your
[25:13] enemy and you got to know your armor
[25:15] your armor is the word and your enemy is
[25:19] anything that reasons against the
[25:22] word anything that reasons against the
[25:25] word now you got to know your enemy by
[25:27] his attacks amen amen watch that the
[25:31] enemy will attack when anyone or any
[25:33] Spirit or any any person tries to
[25:36] disagree with the word of God that's
[25:38] your
[25:39] enemy you see and it might even be a
[25:41] person you love very dearly but if it's
[25:43] a voice of a person who's disagreeing or
[25:46] reasoning with a word that's the Enemy
[25:48] talking to you now I know sometimes we
[25:50] have a hard time Discerning that because
[25:52] if it's our family of course we want to
[25:55] just lean with them amen but there's a
[25:57] difference between between Divine love
[25:58] and compassionate love or or FAL love in
[26:01] a family sometimes family is wrong
[26:03] that's true amen sometimes they are and
[26:07] when it comes between the word and
[26:08] family you take your stand with the word
[26:11] can I can I preach to you a minute amen
[26:13] I want you to see that anything that
[26:15] disagrees with the word is your enemy
[26:17] now we have a hard time Discerning that
[26:19] at times and we think well we'll we'll
[26:21] we'll lean this way or we'll lean that
[26:23] way but a true bride got to stay with
[26:24] that word now I'll show you how Jesus
[26:26] did it and Matthew the 16th chapter I
[26:28] always thought it was amazing poor Peter
[26:30] he was on a roller coaster he starts out
[26:32] a as as Simon the son and then and and
[26:35] and when he gets a question who do you
[26:37] think I am he said thou Christ and he
[26:39] gets a name change and goes from Simon
[26:41] to Peter which is the Rock and then he
[26:45] he puts out an idea that Jesus being de
[26:48] he can't suffer on the cross Peter don't
[26:50] know how to understand how that deity
[26:52] could suffer he don't get it so he he's
[26:55] going to condemn the Lord and the Bible
[26:57] says he rebuke the Lord but the word had
[26:59] sent Jesus for the sake of the cross and
[27:03] Jesus looked at a man he just called The
[27:05] Rock and said you're the devil right he
[27:08] said you get behind me you offend me you
[27:11] see what he did he discerned the thing
[27:13] that was working on Peter Peter was a
[27:16] man who was a jean seek from the
[27:18] beginning but even when he said
[27:20] something that was off of the word the
[27:21] Lord rebuked what he was
[27:24] saying well glory to God we got to put
[27:27] on a shout and shoes this morning that
[27:29] means the word can rebuke you it doesn't
[27:32] mean you're a serpent seed it means
[27:35] you're correctable by the word of God
[27:38] when the enemy comes like a flood God
[27:40] will send the word to correct
[27:43] you thank God thank God thank God that
[27:47] the word can be controversial to our
[27:49] thoughts and our patterns and our ideas
[27:51] if it wasn't for the word we'd still be
[27:53] in the
[27:55] shook oh Lord I done think about think
[27:59] about this I I've been overseas brother
[28:01] Samuel and I I preached a big meet one
[28:03] time in India they wanted me to speak it
[28:05] it was a denominational meeting it was
[28:07] about 10 or 15 different denominations
[28:09] the guy put it together I don't know how
[28:10] many people there's a lot of people amen
[28:12] that it was a big call seeum inter
[28:15] denominational and the brother the guy
[28:16] that want me to preach it was supposed
[28:18] to be a message guy I I don't know where
[28:19] he was kind of felt like maybe he should
[28:21] have went to the upper room like Peter I
[28:22] don't know but but he got me in the back
[28:26] and he said look brother Wayne he said
[28:27] want you to preach he said but don't
[28:28] mention serpent seed don't mention
[28:30] Oneness of the godhead our baptism he
[28:33] said don't mention uh Malachi 4 or
[28:36] Elijah told me all these things he
[28:37] wanted me to mention did not mention and
[28:40] I looked at him kind of kind of chuckled
[28:42] I said well brother I sound like you
[28:43] need to preach instead of
[28:45] me he said no no I can't he said if you
[28:47] if I if you don't go out there and
[28:49] preach I'm going to be in big trouble I
[28:50] said well I I I'll do it okay I'll do it
[28:52] he said well I'm going to translate I
[28:54] said oh no you won't translate for me
[28:58] I said give me another translator there
[28:59] was a guy with me and they said they
[29:01] said brother Wayne he's the one that
[29:02] invited you I said well then he can
[29:04] preach but if he wants me to preach I
[29:06] got to preach what the word of God says
[29:08] this isn't a suggestion this is the word
[29:11] of God this is the age we're living in
[29:14] this brother Wayne what you do I'll tell
[29:15] you what I did I went out there and I
[29:17] started with serpent seed and I took it
[29:19] to the Oneness of the godhead and then I
[29:21] told him we knew that because of Malachi
[29:23] 4 and Elijah you say that was kind of
[29:26] contct it wasn't
[29:28] amen what it was was a word of God was
[29:30] bringing correction to a devil that was
[29:32] trying to suppress the word of God and
[29:35] any demon that don't want you to preach
[29:37] this message ain't nothing but a demon
[29:39] out of
[29:40] hell this message didn't come just to be
[29:43] contrary it came to put the bride in
[29:46] rapturing faith to give us an overcoming
[29:49] power now when I was done with that
[29:52] meeting you know what I did I I opened
[29:54] up the Altar and said anybody that want
[29:56] to know more about the truth I'm talking
[29:57] about stand to your feet and come down
[29:59] front right now and the whole Auditorium
[30:02] emptied out and the spirit of God people
[30:05] were fallen out demons were being cast
[30:07] off people were getting baptized the
[30:09] Holy Ghost the brother come to me and
[30:11] said brother Wayne I'm so sorry that I
[30:13] spoke to you that way he said God knew
[30:16] that I didn't have the courage to do it
[30:17] and sent you here to teach me a lesson
[30:20] that if a man will have courage in the
[30:22] word of God that the word of God can do
[30:25] a great work in the people listen we
[30:27] need some men and women amen that has
[30:29] courage for this message that is able to
[30:31] stand against every devil Hall well
[30:36] glory to
[30:38] God Amen you can't defend yourself
[30:41] without this word amen now Satan his
[30:45] success has been in
[30:47] reasoning has been in reasoning the word
[30:50] that's his success that's where he gets
[30:51] his success and Satan's eatting brother
[30:54] bam said he's had a marvelous success
[30:55] carrying out his threats by explaining
[30:58] away in every age the value of God's
[31:00] promised word for that age so you see
[31:03] you you see the enemy is to explain away
[31:07] the armor is the word I love this quote
[31:09] taking on the whole armor brother B said
[31:11] the whole armor of God is the baptism of
[31:12] the Holy Ghost with a word behind it
[31:15] yesall the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:18] with a word behind it so we're not
[31:19] fortified by doctor's degree or even by
[31:22] intellectual education amen but we are
[31:25] fortified with the baptism of the Holy
[31:26] Ghost
[31:27] to prove the word of God is truth amen
[31:31] isn't it amazing to prove the word of
[31:33] God is truth now putting on the whole
[31:35] armor brother R explains it of how God
[31:37] gives you your armor this is how he
[31:38] explains it he's going to tie together
[31:41] the armor of the Church of Ephesians 6
[31:44] with Isaiah 59 of what Paul says when
[31:47] the enemy or when Isaiah says the enemy
[31:49] will come God will raise a standard or
[31:51] he will give you the Armor of your age
[31:53] now just like the word in the beginning
[31:56] it was a spoken word the second time it
[31:58] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the
[32:00] third time it become a part of us with
[32:02] the Holy Ghost dwelling in us now God
[32:04] coming into man see first the word was
[32:07] spoke and the enemy tore it down then
[32:10] the word was made flesh he crucified it
[32:12] but now there's a difference in the word
[32:16] now brother sister that's a powerful
[32:19] statement coming from a prophet there's
[32:21] a difference in the word now you all
[32:23] know the quotes don't you where brother
[32:24] B says see this age is different he said
[32:27] this doesn't represent amen the upper
[32:30] room he said he said the the Pentecostal
[32:32] is represented that again this age is
[32:33] different and some people has taken that
[32:35] to mean that there's no more baptism of
[32:38] the spirit there's no more gifts of the
[32:39] Spirit there's no more grace there that
[32:41] that we've moved beyond the
[32:43] manifestation of the spirit in the
[32:44] church but the prophet is saying here in
[32:47] putting on the all armor the difference
[32:49] is watch what he says it is the word has
[32:52] become the church and the church is the
[32:54] word see the difference in this age
[32:57] there are scriptures for this age and
[33:00] the church has become those scriptures
[33:03] it's not just something in the Bible
[33:05] this morning it's your life that is
[33:08] being lived out in the age that you're
[33:10] living
[33:11] in all of God was poured into Christ and
[33:15] all of Christ was poured into the church
[33:17] you see what it is then God then God
[33:19] raises a standard and here's what he
[33:21] does he doesn't change the word he
[33:23] raises the standard by making the word
[33:26] real right you see in Isaiah he said
[33:29] behold a virgin shall conceive that was
[33:31] the word but when Mary accepted it it
[33:34] became more positive by coming into a
[33:37] virgin and that word saved the whole
[33:39] world after it come into the woman do
[33:42] you see this same man until this word
[33:44] comes from the Bible into the church
[33:47] it's not manifest yet but this morning
[33:49] this bride is the reality of the things
[33:53] that was written in the Bible in other
[33:54] words you are the standard of God in the
[33:57] age you're living in the devil can't
[33:59] take over because you're here the devil
[34:02] can't take over your family because
[34:04] you're here the devil can't take over
[34:07] the church because you're here you've
[34:09] got a right this morning to press back
[34:12] every de denomination idea until the
[34:16] spirit of God is released in the in the
[34:18] heart and the
[34:19] life W God took the word and poured it
[34:24] into the church I shall pour out my
[34:27] Spirit sayith the Lord in the last days
[34:30] with former and lighter rain shall it
[34:32] come oh think about it this ain't
[34:35] something coming to us the latter rain
[34:37] is rapturing Faith this message is the
[34:41] rapturing faith
[34:45] Hallelujah brother when you get to
[34:47] thinking about it amen what a what a
[34:49] time to live amen this is not then an
[34:52] intellectual word is your
[34:54] protection well get behind the word get
[34:57] behind the word it's not an intellectual
[34:58] word we're looking for that's not what
[35:00] we're after brother B says it'll have to
[35:02] be God's manifestation of the word in
[35:05] flesh God's spirit spoken word am
[35:10] brother a spirit spoken word
[35:14] hallelujah God
[35:16] Elohim takes his own word and speaks it
[35:19] and it comes back into the
[35:21] church God's spirit spoken word the word
[35:24] of God will raise a standard the word
[35:28] will be more
[35:29] manifested Hallelujah now that's God
[35:31] raising he's raising for years I wonder
[35:34] Isaiah 59 we I preached it as the flag
[35:37] and and that's a good that's a good
[35:38] standard that's a good way to see it we
[35:41] raised the flag but brother brandom says
[35:44] to raise the standard is to make the
[35:47] word more real see see what's going on
[35:51] is he makes it more positive now when
[35:54] Satan comes like a flood now I don't
[35:55] want to take any more time in that when
[35:57] Satan comes like a flood I believe we
[35:59] could say Isaiah 59 is today yeah amen
[36:03] amen amen Sunday morning amen after all
[36:05] this we've seen amen it's today is that
[36:08] right amen notice this Isaiah 59 now
[36:11] watch watch watch the what the first of
[36:14] this I don't know if y'all y'all May
[36:15] y'all may study this deeply uh it was
[36:17] years I never really caught what this
[36:19] next the first part of this are always
[36:21] when the enemy comes like a flood but I
[36:22] went back and reread this and I I had a
[36:24] good time with this part and so shall
[36:27] they that fear the name of the Lord from
[36:28] the
[36:29] West I got to look at that and I thought
[36:31] wait a minute when Isaiah wrote that
[36:35] that wasn't even a thought of
[36:37] America this Western Civilization wasn't
[36:39] even thought
[36:40] about but them that fear the name of the
[36:43] Lord how many knows what the name of the
[36:44] Lord is right it's the word
[36:47] interpreted is a manifestation of the
[36:50] name of God in your age that's why
[36:51] brother brandom says in the first seal
[36:54] that it wouldn't be until the Thunders
[36:55] that a new name would be revealed is
[36:58] that right in other words that's why you
[37:00] hear people say Jesus Jesus Jesus and
[37:02] they don't get nothing it's just like
[37:06] Elijah's Showdown on Mount carel you see
[37:09] brother B said they do a lot of holling
[37:10] but they don't get nothing Matthew 25
[37:13] same thing right five foolish five wise
[37:15] amen they're they're wise and foolish
[37:17] virgins the difference is one gets
[37:19] something right right but what did they
[37:22] have in their vessels they were full of
[37:24] oil they got from the word of the
[37:27] age them that fear the name of the Lord
[37:30] now watch from the West and his glory
[37:33] from the rising of the son now I'm not
[37:35] going to take a long time but I do want
[37:37] to say that Willam brandom said the
[37:39] reason he went to Tucson was to meet
[37:41] with them seven
[37:42] angels right right he had to go
[37:46] west to meet with seven angels to get
[37:49] the revelation of the Seven Seals now
[37:52] that's not just a man preaching some
[37:55] ideas that is for fulfilling Revelations
[37:58] the 10th chapter amen Revelations 10
[38:01] cannot be fulfilled at any other time in
[38:05] history but this day this scripture

[40:23] seals that he gave that book amen that
[40:25] he actually has that book and at
[40:27] sometime a prophet will come back and
[40:29] call the resurrection by that book but

[40:35] offered to somebody else amen after the
[40:38] seventh angel in Revelation 5 John

[43:59] pyramid God will raise the standard see
[44:01] It'll Get it'll get more in
[44:03] minority but it's going to greater power

[44:10] the ones that remain in it we see a
[44:12] greater power in
[44:14] it do you know that we've actually left
[44:16] the Pentecostal age and moved into the
[44:18] headstone of Christ direct quote signs
[44:20] of a time brother BR said we lift the
[44:22] Pentecostal age we are now coming like a
[44:24] pyramid now not a now but I mean like a
[44:27] pyramid there's got to be a Ministry in
[44:29] the church True Church of the Living God

[44:32] of Christ will fit right together
[44:35] perfectly right together perfectly watch

[44:47] it's going to move from Luther to Wesley
[44:49] to Pentecost he said then it'll move
[44:52] into the Perfection of the son of man
[44:54] when the husband and and the wife will
[44:56] be the
[44:57] selfs persons Hallelujah can you imagine
[45:00] that you're represented in heaven as
[45:04] Christ wonderful now to see it in the
[45:07] Bible I I love biblical truth right when
[45:09] the spirit of the enemy comes in like a
[45:11] flood the spirit of the Lord will raise
[45:13] a standard raise Ephesians chapter 4 for
[45:16] the perfecting the work of the ministry
[45:17] for the edifying of the body till we all
[45:20] come in the unity of faith and knowledge
[45:21] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[45:23] unto the measure of the stat of the
[45:26] fullness of Christ what's he saying when
[45:27] the enemy comes God will raise the
[45:29] standard to a perfect stature of Christ
[45:34] you're going to be in The Headstone see
[45:36] what he's saying leaving the
[45:38] principles and the doctrines and going
[45:41] to Perfection right amen do you know
[45:44] according to Hebrews chapter 11 all of
[45:46] the great Saints that's live for the
[45:47] last 2,000 years cannot be made perfect
[45:50] Without You
[45:51] amen the measure cannot be full when the
[45:55] measure is full that's perfect right
[45:58] amen it's perfectly full when the church
[46:01] becomes full of the baptism of the
[46:04] spirit not just in a measure but when
[46:07] the fullness of that which is Christ
[46:09] comes into the church she's at the top
[46:12] now watch watch watch the scripture go
[46:14] back to Isaiah 59 and let's read again
[46:16] and and let's read here in the uh let's
[46:20] let's watch this next verse in the 20th
[46:22] verse When the Spirit of the Lord shall
[46:25] raise us standard against him watch that
[46:27] 20th verse look what he's going to do
[46:29] see when the spirit of the Lord shall
[46:31] raise a standard so the enemy comes God
[46:33] does something what what he's going to
[46:36] do and the Redeemer now who is the
[46:39] Redeemer that's Elohim right that's
[46:42] Elohim or Christ it's God coming in the
[46:44] flesh of Jesus and he redeemed us but
[46:47] Our Redeemer Lives right right Our
[46:50] Redeemer Lives now watch the Redeemer
[46:53] shall come to Zion right how many knows
[46:56] who Zion
[46:57] is Zion is not a place over there in
[47:00] Israel brother man said when you see
[47:02] Zion in the scripture that is the
[47:05] bride see when the enemy comes Christ
[47:08] shall come to the bride he'll come right
[47:12] into the Bride Watch the next verse
[47:14] watch the 21st verse read the scripture
[47:16] it's beautiful reading as for me this is
[47:18] my Covenant with them now we're going to
[47:20] go to a covenant isn't that beautiful
[47:23] because abrahamic Covenant is Christ do
[47:25] y'all know Christ was given as a
[47:27] covenant to you real shortly let's just
[47:29] break it down he was given as a covenant
[47:31] remember brother Bram said a covenant is
[47:33] a beast he said laid between two people
[47:36] I make a promise you make a promise then
[47:38] we kill the Beast and split the body you
[47:42] take half I take half brother Bram said
[47:44] God did this with Abraham in Genesis 15
[47:48] but the Covenant was
[47:50] Christ God laid Jesus between me and you
[47:54] killed him at Calvary
[47:56] and tore the body and brother bam says
[47:59] God took the Corporal body to Heaven he
[48:03] said and gave you the spirit out of it
[48:06] then God's covenant with you is the
[48:10] spirit that was in Jesus Christ do you
[48:12] see then why you can never get in
[48:15] Covenant with God through education or
[48:17] through learning or through church
[48:19] membership your Covenant is his
[48:23] Spirit now when the enemy comes like a
[48:26] flood God by his Covenant shall come
[48:30] into the
[48:31] church my
[48:33] Lord y do y'all like prophecy do you
[48:36] love you love prophecy I love prophecy
[48:38] watch Psalms 102 read uh 13 to vers
[48:43] 16 amen no we we come to have a little
[48:45] church let's read this prophecy for Thou
[48:48] shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for
[48:51] the time of favor to time to favor her
[48:55] the set time has come I know I've read
[48:57] this to you but I want to want to just
[48:58] use it for a moment thou shall have
[49:00] mercy upon Zion for the set time has
[49:02] come for the servant shall take pleasure
[49:05] in her Stone so the Heathen shall fear
[49:07] the name of the Lord heathens right
[49:10] Gentiles in the west will'll fear the
[49:13] name of the Lord and all of the kings of
[49:15] the Earth are glory for when the Lord
[49:17] shall build up Zion he shall appear in
[49:21] his glory look at this when when enemy
[49:25] comes like a FL I'm going to build the
[49:27] church I'm going to raise a standard I'm
[49:30] going to build it up to the catstone and
[49:32] when the catstone comes it'll be Christ
[49:35] himself amen do you see that's the
[49:38] that's the capping of the church is when
[49:41] Christ himself comes upon the church
[49:43] amen it's written in Peter he said I'll
[49:45] lay in Zion a Chief
[49:47] Cornerstone amen now you say well
[49:49] preacher how far have we come well in
[49:51] this journey in this journey of the
[49:53] church how far have we come we come
[49:55] through Lutheran we've come through
[49:57] Wesley and we've come through Pentecost
[50:00] but look what Paul says in Hebrews 12
[50:03] but ye in the 22nd verse he said but ye
[50:06] are come unto Mount Zion that's how far
[50:10] you've come you've come you've left
[50:12] you've left the time of Moses and
[50:14] tradition you've left the church age of
[50:17] of legal and law and and churchianity
[50:20] and you've left the Pentecostal age
[50:22] you've come to the bride of Christ and
[50:25] to the city of the Living God the
[50:26] heavenly Jerusalem amen watch this unto
[50:29] the innumerable company of angels
[50:33] 200,000 demons can't number the Angels
[50:36] amen but to the general assembly of the
[50:38] Church of the firstborn which are
[50:40] written in
[50:41] heaven amen now now y'all y'all have to
[50:45] y'all have to as you read the scripture
[50:47] you have to think about this and I as a
[50:49] message preacher sometimes I think about
[50:50] this and I think look look at what Paul
[50:52] says the the age that I'm preaching the
[50:54] message the time that I've come we've
[50:56] come to Zion where there's a number of
[50:59] company of Angels at a junction of time
[51:00] angels have filled the air filled the
[51:02] atmospheres and I'm preaching to the
[51:05] Church of the firstborn see not the
[51:07] Pentecostals to the Church of the
[51:08] firstborn there's a difference in the
[51:09] days in the days of Pentecost the Church
[51:12] of the firstborn was in the upper room
[51:14] the Pentecostals were in the traditions
[51:16] of Pentecost amen look at the same time
[51:20] they were on the Earth but the Holy
[51:22] Ghost was in the upper room they had
[51:24] been raised up in the presence of God
[51:27] hallelujah now think of this because
[51:29] brother Randon says that their names
[51:32] were written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[51:33] do you know how Peter knew his name was
[51:35] there brother B said when Jesus came to
[51:37] him said who do you say that I am he
[51:39] said I say th the Christ the son of the
[51:40] Living God brother said the light struck
[51:42] the name and proved that his name was on
[51:45] the Lamb's Book amen the little woman at
[51:48] the well when the Messiah sign passed
[51:50] over her and she said I say that thou
[51:53] art the Christ brother B says it brues
[51:55] her names there you see what he's saying
[51:57] he's saying you're recognizing the age
[52:00] you're living in is the true reality of
[52:03] the Jean seed that's on the inside of
[52:05] you listen I think it's powerful that I
[52:08] get to preach to people that I know
[52:11] their name is already written in the
[52:13] Lamb's Book of
[52:17] Life glory amen it's prophesying like
[52:20] Joshua prophesied in his day he knew the
[52:23] children of God would inherit that land
[52:26] and today when I'm preaching to you I'm
[52:28] not thinking that maybe somebody some
[52:30] sometimes going to go there but I know
[52:33] there's somebody who's going to inherit
[52:35] the very promises that I'm talking about
[52:37] this
[52:39] morning what is it it's it's it's come
[52:41] to the place it's come to the place
[52:44] where we are ministering to people who
[52:46] are having their names written in the
[52:48] lamb Book of Life that's why it's not
[52:51] always just a Salvation message you're
[52:53] hearing it's why it's not always always
[52:55] see this is end time evangelism it's
[52:57] adoption time it's honing time it's
[53:01] polishing off the off the ministry of
[53:03] the church to
[53:06] Perfection wonderful God I don't want
[53:10] this to choke you but the prophet of God
[53:12] said what is it it's
[53:15] Elohim back in the
[53:18] bride praise God how far has it come
[53:21] that's it it's
[53:22] Elohim back in the bride amen can I say
[53:26] it the way brother Ram said invisible
[53:27] Union the same Jesus in Bride form amen
[53:32] amen we see him coming down and
[53:36] living among his
[53:38] people what is
[53:39] it now watch this I'm going to finish in
[53:43] this area right here let's look at this
[53:45] next verse of Isaiah 59 I want you to
[53:48] watch what
[53:49] happens and go back to Isaiah 59 and
[53:51] look at the verses
[53:54] here 19 I think it's
[53:58] 21 see he shall come and this is my
[54:01] Covenant with him sayith the Lord my
[54:03] spirit that is upon thee my words which
[54:06] I have put in thy mouth shall not depart
[54:07] out of thy mouth though out of the mouth
[54:08] of thy seed out of the mouth of the seed
[54:10] seed sayith the Lord from hence forth
[54:14] and forever more now now watch what he's
[54:16] saying the spirit of the Lord is going
[54:17] to raise his
[54:18] standard and look at his standard now
[54:21] he's going to make the word more real so
[54:24] scripture that are actually for your Day
[54:27] scriptures like of Isaiah 5 59
[54:29] Revelations 10 Luke 17 Malachi 4 these
[54:33] scriptures are going to be manifest at
[54:36] the same time the enemy comes like a
[54:38] flood but there won't be something
[54:40] that's just abstract from you but as he
[54:44] tells John you're actually taking the
[54:46] revelations and eating them in spiritual
[54:49] food and bringing them into your life
[54:52] this is the Covenant that he made that
[54:54] they will will actually be put in you
[54:57] now years ago I was preaching on the
[54:59] certain sound and the uncertain sound
[55:02] and in the certain sound message brother
[55:03] Bram will say something he'll say he'll
[55:05] say now there's a certain sound and he
[55:08] says if you repent and be baptized you
[55:10] shall receive the Holy Ghost so he said
[55:12] You shall do you see that you shall
[55:14] knock and it shall be open it's a
[55:16] certain sound if you do this happens and
[55:19] I got to studying the shallel bees of
[55:21] scripture if you like to study scripture
[55:22] that's pretty good shall be this shall
[55:23] be this shall be and and I I read
[55:26] Revelation 10 differently than I ever
[55:27] read it before because it actually says
[55:30] in Revelations 10 if John would take the
[55:32] book the first says take the book eat
[55:33] the book and watch the promise it shall
[55:37] be in thy mouth right so it's not just
[55:40] that he's going to eat something but by
[55:42] the eating of it it will actually be in
[55:45] his
[55:47] mouth the weapon that will destroy the
[55:50] Devil is
[55:53] naivy even in in thy mouth what watch
[55:57] this you actually have Atomic
[56:01] Warfare amen I I I know brother B said
[56:04] that when those scarecrows or when those
[56:06] when those crows fly over and he said
[56:08] you can't keep them from Landing you
[56:09] remember he said you can't keep them
[56:11] passing over said a farmer standing out
[56:13] there and crows fly over and he said a
[56:15] man run in got a shotgun started
[56:16] shooting at him he said he said what's
[56:18] that about he said well I can't keep the
[56:20] crows from flying he said but I can't
[56:21] keep them from Landing right right but
[56:24] man said that's like thoughts evil
[56:26] thoughts that come to your mind he said
[56:28] you can't keep them from passing he said
[56:30] but you can keep them from Landing you
[56:31] take the shotgun of scripture right but
[56:33] I thought it was amazing because when I
[56:35] started studying that I found that later
[56:37] brother B begins to say in the greatest
[56:39] battle ever fought he said we don't have
[56:41] a little 22 all right can I can I
[56:44] propose this to you we don't even have a
[56:46] shotgun he said but the bride has thus
[56:48] sayith the Lord and thus sayith the Lord
[56:51] is an adom Bond amen you don't you don't
[56:54] only can just get rid of them you can
[56:56] totally obliterate every thought that
[56:59] comes amen because you are having a
[57:02] possession of the word of God in this
[57:05] age do you see what it is ask for me God
[57:07] says ask for me in other words youen I
[57:09] know who you are I know your problems I
[57:11] know your issues I know your situations
[57:14] but ask for me this is my Covenant God
[57:17] made a covenant with you that's not
[57:19] about you it's not about your abilities
[57:22] it's not amen it's not according to what
[57:24] you can
[57:25] what you cannot do he said Abraham I
[57:28] have already blessed you come on Church
[57:32] we're not under any Covenant we're under
[57:35] an abrahamic Covenant and God said he's
[57:37] already did this for you watch this
[57:40] Covenant when it comes upon the church
[57:43] he's already said now as for me I make
[57:45] this Covenant with you in other words
[57:47] God made this as for me he says now
[57:51] you're going to be who you are you got
[57:52] the issues you got but can you imagine
[57:54] that God can claim you it don't matter
[57:56] where you're setting what situation
[57:58] you've done amen because we can come up
[57:59] with 100 reasons why that we can't
[58:01] defeat the Devil but God said that's for
[58:03] me now this is my Covenant Amen in other
[58:06] words I'm going to give you Christ and I
[58:08] made a covenant with Christ and when he
[58:10] comes into the church Christ will be in
[58:13] the bride and watch and he shall not
[58:16] depart out of thy mouth then this
[58:19] morning the spoken word will be given to
[58:22] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[58:25] no wonder Mark the 11th chapter said if
[58:28] you say under this mountain be thou
[58:31] moved and cast up it shall be done as
[58:33] you have asked it that's not just to any
[58:35] age but when the enemy comes like a
[58:38] flood the spirit of the Lord would come
[58:41] into the church and by the spoken
[58:45] word
[58:47] amen oh Church of the Living God
[58:50] hallelujah amen I don't know sometimes
[58:52] if we know who we
[58:53] are
[58:57] now can I can I tie can I tie scripture
[58:59] with something brother BR
[59:01] said in patma Vision brother B said
[59:03] Don't Fear Little Flock I'm with you
[59:06] amen he's talking about Jesus and he
[59:07] says all my power is yours my
[59:09] omnipotence is yours I stand in your
[59:11] midst I have not come to bring fear and
[59:14] failure we need to preach a meeting on
[59:16] that don't we I've come not to bring
[59:17] fear and failure but of Love courage and
[59:21] ability amen all power is given unto me
[59:25] and it's yours to use hallah you speak
[59:28] the word and I will perform it that is
[59:32] my Covenant and it can never fail
[59:35] brother B knew what he was talking about
[59:38] Isaiah 59 is the Covenant of the church
[59:41] that if you speak the word of God it
[59:43] will not fail watch this it's an
[59:46] abrahamic Covenant amen you said well
[59:48] brother Wayne is it to everybody it's to
[59:50] them that can take
[59:51] it amen who's it to everybody no it's to
[59:54] them that can take it amen to the saints
[59:56] were are at Ephesus do you see the ones
[59:58] that can take it in John he could take
[1:00:01] it the bride they can take it they can
[1:00:04] take the word you see they can take the
[1:00:06] land they can take their possession
[1:00:08] because it's the spoken word it's the
[1:00:10] Covenant of God with him now now if
[1:00:12] you'll notice this this is how Isaiah 59
[1:00:16] becomes Revelations the 12th chapter Now
[1:00:19] read the 11th verse of the 12th chapter
[1:00:21] with this in mind we're looking at end
[1:00:23] time battles
[1:00:25] amen but we're talking about Isaiah 59
[1:00:27] Isaiah saw this time Paul saw this time
[1:00:31] Timothy saw this time Willam brandom saw
[1:00:34] this time and more importantly God saw
[1:00:37] this
[1:00:39] time thank you
[1:00:41] Lord now in Revelation the 12th chapter
[1:00:44] it's moving from Angelic
[1:00:46] battles to human
[1:00:49] battles now do you think that God
[1:00:51] doesn't understand your human battles
[1:00:54] your human troubles he sees their
[1:00:56] trouble yes but watch what he says here
[1:00:58] in Revelation the 12th
[1:01:00] chapter and they overcame him by the
[1:01:04] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:01:07] their testimony and love not their lives
[1:01:09] unto death now watch what he says and
[1:01:11] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:01:13] lamb and the word of the testimony now
[1:01:14] I'm that guy that ask who are
[1:01:17] they right I got to ask it who are they
[1:01:21] now the Bible if you go back in the
[1:01:22] scriptures in Hebrews 11 it says they
[1:01:24] cannot be made perfect without us so you
[1:01:27] got to know who you are and what
[1:01:29] scripture in Hebrews 11 they are
[1:01:31] speaking about the ones down Through the
[1:01:33] Ages but when he says can't be made
[1:01:35] perfect without us it's speaking about
[1:01:37] the end time people us but when he comes
[1:01:40] to Revelations 12 and he said they
[1:01:43] overcame who's he talking about who's
[1:01:45] that they they're talking about that's
[1:01:47] not just anybody but there's somebody
[1:01:50] there it's not just a figment of
[1:01:53] imagination I remember when I was
[1:01:54] studying this I I went to it and I got
[1:01:56] to think about my childhood when I was
[1:01:58] growing up and I got to think about when
[1:02:00] I was a kid I remember having friends
[1:02:02] they can I say it openly I guess they
[1:02:05] were pot smokers and and and and and
[1:02:07] they were some paranoid guys man they
[1:02:09] were you been around people like that
[1:02:11] they sometimes they just get very
[1:02:13] paranoid over nothing you know and you
[1:02:15] can always tell when you come up to a
[1:02:16] house if somebody's a little bit using
[1:02:18] drugs and things cuz they're they're
[1:02:20] blinds they they all broke right in the
[1:02:22] middle where they they lift them up and
[1:02:24] look out side cuz anybody pulls up it's
[1:02:26] the cops I'm sure it's the cops out
[1:02:28] there you know and I remember as a kid
[1:02:30] being with some of my friends and they
[1:02:31] were always looking at the blind saying
[1:02:33] they're out there right they're out
[1:02:35] there and you go look in the window and
[1:02:37] they ain't nothing but trees out there
[1:02:40] but in their mind the trees are full of
[1:02:42] the cops and you drive down the road
[1:02:44] with them they they're back there they
[1:02:47] and you always like who are
[1:02:49] they who are they but it's in their mind
[1:02:52] that's all it's just somebody in their
[1:02:53] mind but when when God had John write
[1:02:56] this scripture they and he said they
[1:02:59] shall overcome that wasn't just in God's
[1:03:01] mind he wasn't some imaginary somebody
[1:03:05] he had somebody in his mind and they are
[1:03:08] you they are us amen you're in the Bible
[1:03:12] they shall
[1:03:15] overcome what does that mean throw down
[1:03:17] conquer destroy put underfoot you're not
[1:03:21] just going to make it you're not just
[1:03:23] going to crawl in you're not just going
[1:03:25] to barely get there you are going to
[1:03:28] conquer amen put underfoot every demon
[1:03:31] power in the age you're living
[1:03:34] in well glory to God Amen think about it
[1:03:39] think about the age this is this is not
[1:03:41] a bride just going to barely get in this
[1:03:44] message amen she's going to go home in
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:50] Victory and they overcame him the enemy
[1:03:53] that's raising up right right him the
[1:03:56] enemy that's raised it up the Antichrist
[1:03:58] Spirit do you see that not the devil
[1:04:00] with horns on it the spirit of the
[1:04:02] Antichrist that's revealed in this day
[1:04:04] they overcame him the devil and how did
[1:04:07] they do it by the blood of the Lamb amen
[1:04:10] I I know I don't have time to preach but
[1:04:12] I want to put it in your mind the blood
[1:04:14] of the Lamb that doesn't say the blood
[1:04:15] of a lamb and how many lambs had been
[1:04:18] sacrificed in the time of John thousands
[1:04:21] of lambs but he didn't say a l he said
[1:04:24] the lamb then there was something in his
[1:04:27] mind that the blood of the only begotten
[1:04:30] Son of God who wasn't the blood of a man
[1:04:33] he wasn't the blood of a Jew he wasn't
[1:04:35] the blood of a gentile but amen the
[1:04:38] Bible said that Mary conceived likewise
[1:04:41] that when the angel came to her and said
[1:04:44] thou had been favored of God remember
[1:04:46] and she said be it unto me according to
[1:04:48] Thy word brother Ram said what came into
[1:04:50] her amen was both egg and and life it
[1:04:54] was both male and
[1:04:57] female oh that was a creation in the
[1:04:59] womb of Mary friends that was a creation
[1:05:01] of almighty God in the wom that was not
[1:05:04] just the blood of any man it was the
[1:05:06] blood of almighty God Amen the DNA of
[1:05:09] God was in Jesus
[1:05:11] Christ
[1:05:12] GL Hallelujah I enjoy preaching to y'all
[1:05:15] y'all like to
[1:05:17] preach the Creator y'all y'all ever
[1:05:21] notice that's right when the name of God
[1:05:23] changed yeah right when the name of God
[1:05:25] changed was when the word of Isaiah was
[1:05:27] interpreted and manifested the name
[1:05:29] changed to Jesus isn't that isn't that
[1:05:31] beautiful went from Jehovah to Jesus
[1:05:35] being Jehovah has become Our Savior when
[1:05:37] male and female were created in the womb
[1:05:39] and come forth in life it was a
[1:05:42] manifestation of Jesus Oh My amen what
[1:05:46] happened in the beginning when God
[1:05:47] created and he created male and female
[1:05:50] in the beginning God did it and changed
[1:05:52] his name from Elohim to Jehovah
[1:05:54] and now he's changing it from Jehovah to
[1:05:59] Jesus ah Mary was impregnated with a
[1:06:01] word made manifest it was in her life
[1:06:04] the Creator the Conqueror the Overcomer
[1:06:07] was in her womb and her testimony to her
[1:06:10] friends was I have conceived of a virgin
[1:06:13] birth amen the prophet of God said when
[1:06:16] the first time that she told Elizabeth
[1:06:18] that story that Elizabeth believed her
[1:06:21] amen Mary's first convert was Elizabeth
[1:06:23] the first convert of Jesus Christ was
[1:06:25] Elizabeth amen John the Baptist
[1:06:27] converted his own mother from the
[1:06:29] womb amen Elizabeth Elizabeth believed
[1:06:34] the words of Mary you know why she
[1:06:36] believed it and she said Mary when you
[1:06:38] begin to testify the word of your
[1:06:41] testimony when you begin to testify to
[1:06:43] me she said my baby that's in my womb
[1:06:47] has been laying there without lie for 6
[1:06:49] months but when you said the name Jesus
[1:06:52] that baby leaked up with in
[1:06:56] me oh John had his first convert right
[1:06:59] there the thing that is in Mary is the
[1:07:03] Lamb of
[1:07:04] [Applause]
[1:07:07] God glory amen I got all my shout and
[1:07:11] shoes amen the lamb the blood of the
[1:07:14] Lamb that saves the sin of the world the
[1:07:17] one that can conquer the hell death and
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:20] grave was the word of Isaiah coming into
[1:07:23] the man estation Hallelujah and it was
[1:07:26] in Mary and look she
[1:07:28] testified amen amen I often I often
[1:07:31] thought it was amazing where she done
[1:07:33] her testifying that she done it right
[1:07:36] down there at the house of the priest
[1:07:37] she would have got killed for that had
[1:07:39] it not been a virgin birth right she
[1:07:41] wasn't fear she didn't fear for her life
[1:07:44] because she knew her testimony was
[1:07:46] true had that not been a true testimony
[1:07:49] the priest who was responsible to kill
[1:07:51] her for adultery was the one she
[1:07:53] testified to but he had to judge it was
[1:07:57] a virgin birth and because of the
[1:08:00] conversion inside of John's mother the
[1:08:04] prophet of God said oh if it could bring
[1:08:06] a baby alive in the womb of a mother
[1:08:09] what should the name of Jesus Christ do
[1:08:12] to the Church of the Living
[1:08:16] God God ain't gave us another name this
[1:08:18] morning it's still the name of Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ this message isn't another name
[1:08:24] it's the name of Christ manifested it's
[1:08:28] not Jesus outside it's Jesus
[1:08:31] inside Hall

[1:08:37] blowing across the church this morning
[1:08:39] and holy ghost power with reality of
[1:08:47] Truth the blood of the Lamb the lamb now
[1:08:51] you got to imagine something here The
[1:08:53] Blood blood of the
[1:08:55] Lamb Hallelujah and watch and by the
[1:09:00] word of their testimony then people in
[1:09:02] the end times going to have a word
[1:09:05] they're going to have a message to
[1:09:06] testify about but I want you to notice
[1:09:08] what Mary wasn't scared of she wasn't
[1:09:11] scared of that testimony yes she run
[1:09:13] down to the house of the man that would
[1:09:15] kill her for that testimony and gave it
[1:09:18] because she didn't have no fear I love
[1:09:20] how the end of this scripture read I
[1:09:22] love how it says in they love not their
[1:09:24] lives under death yes yes I love how it
[1:09:27] says that because the people that's
[1:09:29] doing this testifying ain't scared of
[1:09:30] dying right you know what they're doing
[1:09:33] they're winning this battle because
[1:09:35] they're fighting like dead
[1:09:37] men you ain't never had a fight on your
[1:09:40] hands until you fight somebody who
[1:09:42] thinks they're already dead they're
[1:09:45] fighting like somebody who has nothing
[1:09:47] to preserve they don't have nothing to
[1:09:49] gain they don't have nothing if if they
[1:09:51] die in the battle what difference does
[1:09:53] it make you see they're fighting with
[1:09:55] everything that's on the inside of them
[1:09:57] I pray God give us some men and women
[1:09:59] this morning amen that's not scared of
[1:10:01] the devil they're not scared of the
[1:10:02] testimony they're not scared of somebody
[1:10:04] making fun of them amen they're not
[1:10:06] scared of the teasing and the and the
[1:10:08] ridicule of this message but they're
[1:10:10] going to fight like people who have
[1:10:12] already died and gave their life for
[1:10:14] Jesus
[1:10:17] Christ Hallelujah my they love not their
[1:10:21] lives and they overcame prise god listen
[1:10:25] I I I know I know this morning that the
[1:10:27] devil has told you everything yeah I
[1:10:31] know he tells you every kind of lie and
[1:10:33] every kind of situation about your birth
[1:10:34] and who you are and where you came from
[1:10:36] but you know brother brandom said when
[1:10:38] God created me we and Bram I was before
[1:10:40] the foundation of the world and my
[1:10:43] spirit was conscious wasn't I wasn't
[1:10:45] conscious of anything he said he said
[1:10:48] but wait a minute Jesus told the
[1:10:50] disciples he knew them before the
[1:10:51] foundation of the world and PA said he
[1:10:54] chose us before the foundation of the
[1:10:55] world and brother R said some part of me
[1:10:58] or Orman Neville the rest of us all here
[1:11:00] Jesus Christ uh that that was in Christ
[1:11:03] before the world began can I can I just
[1:11:05] change names
[1:11:07] here amen now there was some part of me
[1:11:10] can I put my name in there there's some
[1:11:13] part of you there's some part of brother
[1:11:14] Samuel brother Brian Zachariah Karissa

[1:11:18] you that was in God before the
[1:11:21] foundation of the world Amen
[1:11:24] I mean listen to that there's some part
[1:11:26] of you that was there and brother ROM
[1:11:28] ties together John 17 with Ephesians 1
[1:11:31] and said here's the analysis of this I
[1:11:34] think the people today that are
[1:11:35] possessed with the spirit a part of
[1:11:37] those Angelic spirits that turned off of
[1:11:39] God never fa at the beginning and
[1:11:41] resisted the devil's lie in heaven so
[1:11:44] you resisted that lie there you're
[1:11:46] resisting that lie here and how are you
[1:11:48] resisting by the spirit of God that
[1:11:51] dwells in the church yes
[1:11:54] amen now God makes a covenant this is my
[1:11:58] Covenant my word shall be in thy mouth
[1:12:00] hallu you'll speak the word I'll perform
[1:12:02] it it'll be an atom bomb when you speak
[1:12:04] it'll be a spirit of word that will
[1:12:06] destroy the enemy it'll destroy the
[1:12:09] things that around you why Christ speak
[1:12:11] brother B will say it like this the Holy
[1:12:13] Spirit has one message just speak the
[1:12:15] word and go forward that's right don't
[1:12:17] cry there's the word speak it and move
[1:12:19] forward that's thus sayith the Lord
[1:12:21] that's the message of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:25] that's the message of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:26] until you speak the word you can't go
[1:12:29] forward right Moses is at the Red Sea
[1:12:32] until he speaks the word he can't go
[1:12:34] forward right the church cannot go
[1:12:37] forward until the word is
[1:12:39] spoken see until you speak the word you
[1:12:42] can't go forward until you say Satan get
[1:12:45] out of my way I'm a redeemed Son of God
[1:12:47] you can't go forward because you're
[1:12:49] worried about your past you're worried
[1:12:51] about the troubles you're worried about
[1:12:52] the situ ations you worried about but
[1:12:55] speak the word of God and just begin to
[1:12:57] move forward don't let that devil move
[1:12:59] you so brother way but but I'm waiting
[1:13:01] on the short work I'm waiting on this
[1:13:03] brother B said the move is on amen
[1:13:06] that's th sayith the Lord we are more
[1:13:08] than conquerors in him that loved us I
[1:13:11] can do all things through Christ has
[1:13:12] strengthened us amen you start putting
[1:13:14] that kind of thing in your mouth I can
[1:13:16] do all things anything that says you
[1:13:18] can't is a lie amen amen right right
[1:13:22] it's a lie right amen blessing I often
[1:13:26] often I think every time I preach
[1:13:29] anymore I get to thinking about it I
[1:13:30] like I like to get the whole
[1:13:31] congregation to help me preach I I like
[1:13:33] get get everybody turn to somebody and
[1:13:35] say hey the devil's a
[1:13:38] liar Li the devil's a liar Li you know

[1:13:44] how you do you know how to know when the
[1:13:46] devil's lying to you when he's talking
[1:13:48] to

[1:13:58] it's going to twist it that you can't
[1:14:00] and you'll never and you won't be able
[1:14:02] to but the Bible said we are more than
[1:14:05] conquerors through Christ who loved us I
[1:14:08] can do all things amen that if you speak
[1:14:11] the word if you speak the word of God
[1:14:14] this is not just written for Paul it's
[1:14:16] not just written for Abraham this is
[1:14:19] written for every seed of God in this
[1:14:22] generation
[1:14:23] there it is his Spirit his life is
[1:14:26] exactly what the word is this is exactly
[1:14:29] Jesus the word and when the spirit born
[1:14:32] Spirit-filled man in faith takes the
[1:14:34] word into his heart and places it upon
[1:14:37] his lip it is the same as deity
[1:14:43] speaking prise
[1:14:45] Lord he's a preacher you just don't know
[1:14:48] me very well you don't know my life can
[1:14:51] I can I read you a quote brother B says
[1:14:52] it like this
[1:14:54] concerning the same thing he said catch
[1:14:56] that the word comes into you if the holy
[1:14:59] spirit is in there it's as live as soon
[1:15:02] as it comes in and every promise is true
[1:15:07] therefore if you say to the mountain be
[1:15:09] moved and don't doubt in your heart
[1:15:11] because what you are deity speaking
[1:15:16] Hallelujah Lord praise God you believe
[1:15:19] it whatever you say shall come to pass
[1:15:22] if you will not doubt it right watch
[1:15:25] this now if you can get all the world
[1:15:28] breed out of you right now think about
[1:15:31] that all the world bread out of you how
[1:15:34] you going to do
[1:15:36] that let the Holy Spirit make you how
[1:15:38] you going to get the world bread out of
[1:15:39] you now think about that because there's
[1:15:42] some things that se seems to be undoable
[1:15:45] right right hybrid hybrid burst hybrid
[1:15:47] religion hybrid see the hybridization of
[1:15:49] seed right brother said that's the
[1:15:51] problem remember with the mule and with
[1:15:53] the the donkey amen that's the problem
[1:15:55] that's the problem with the mule right
[1:15:57] right the mule is the hybrid between a
[1:15:59] donkey and a horse you can't how how do
[1:16:01] you fix that but brother Bram says but
[1:16:04] watch the church got bred into by
[1:16:06] unbelief and doctrines down Through the
[1:16:08] Ages he said but the Holy Ghost comes to
[1:16:11] breathe the church back sir you see what
[1:16:14] he's doing he's coming to breed it back
[1:16:16] to breathe out now how you going to do
[1:16:19] it but by the Holy Ghost now think about
[1:16:22] it remember every every donkey can be
[1:16:24] redeemed there's a blood for a donkey
[1:16:27] but not for a mule right not for the
[1:16:29] hybrid there's no blood you can say
[1:16:31] you're under the blood but as long as
[1:16:32] it's mixed it's not under the blood amen
[1:16:36] you see then hybrid religion has no
[1:16:38] Authority or no power to exercise the
[1:16:41] spoken word of God but to them that have
[1:16:43] come under the blood and by the baptism
[1:16:46] of the Holy Ghost has got a new birth
[1:16:49] come on Church watch this it's a new
[1:16:51] birth he's talking about
[1:16:54] amen Lord now I I know I know that one
[1:16:57] of the big things in the message of the
[1:16:58] hour has been uh somebody that's
[1:17:00] illegitimate born whether they could
[1:17:02] even go in the Rapture and I thank God
[1:17:04] that brother bradam actually answered
[1:17:06] that question to Sister Mary Dalton and
[1:17:08] I'm sure you've read it here the people
[1:17:09] but he read that quote to Sister Mary
[1:17:12] Dalton I think Jim Dalton's mother asked
[1:17:15] brother random the question about the
[1:17:16] illegitimate birth and brother Bram
[1:17:17] wrote her a letter back and said sister
[1:17:19] dalon she said all of our births are
[1:17:22] illegitimate that through through the
[1:17:24] fall of Adam we're all hibrid in our
[1:17:26] birth and we're all illegitimate in our
[1:17:29] birth and we become legitimate Sons
[1:17:32] through the new birth amen amen is't
[1:17:35] that beautiful legitimate Sons and
[1:17:37] Daughters by the new birth in other
[1:17:39] words the new birth breaths out the call
[1:17:42] the New Birth dismisses the sexual
[1:17:45] desire the new birth it destroys
[1:17:50] it see if you can get it bred out
[1:17:53] Hallelujah you can get that baptism of
[1:17:54] the Holy Ghost it'll breed out that now
[1:17:57] I told you that to say this you think
[1:17:59] about you think about Samson in his day
[1:18:01] of War right and Samson's coming across
[1:18:04] the mountains and and and he's got a
[1:18:07] thousand Philistines on him and he finds
[1:18:10] the Jawbone of a donkey right come on
[1:18:14] church was no mu bone he picked up is a
[1:18:17] Jawbone of a donkey it don't say a
[1:18:19] donkey in the Bible I'm saying that for
[1:18:20] you young people amen but he picked up a
[1:18:23] a a Jawbone of a purebred animal right

[1:18:44] daughter of God and you can beat that a
[1:18:46] thousand
[1:18:47] Philistines it's the Jawbone of the
[1:18:50] church why did mo why did Samson find a
[1:18:53] Jawbone it was representing that there's
[1:18:56] coming a bride that by the spirit of the
[1:18:59] word that's coming out of her mouth
[1:19:01] she'll destroy every devil that's in
[1:19:03] front of her I don't know if you know it
[1:19:06] but the most powerful weapon you possess

[1:44:16] arise has God lost control he said no no

[1:45:00] edification is the spirit revealed word
[1:45:03] amen and it comes to lift up and
[1:45:05] identify the real son and daughter of
[1:45:07] God on the inside that's where our
[1:45:09] Dominion is at recognizing who we are in
[1:45:13] him and to recognize he's our big
[1:45:15] brother amen amen we we are one with
[1:45:19] Christ Jesus
[1:45:21] amen don't you love him oh my what a

[1:45:28] time for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:45:31] we're closer we're closer am we're
[1:45:34] closer I just appreciate how the spirit
[1:45:36] of God just taking it and identifying
[1:45:38] not putting promises out there that it
[1:45:41] keeps people looking way out there I
[1:45:43] remember one time I was fellowshipping
[1:45:45] with with a brother and he wanted to sit
[1:45:46] down and and ask me certain there was
[1:45:48] questions that and we sat down for about
[1:45:50] three or four hours at a restaurant and
[1:45:52] there were certain things and we begin
[1:45:53] to deal with that on the latter rain and
[1:45:55] when I begin to just working just right
[1:45:57] right through the the scriptures and the
[1:45:59] message and the brother himself he said
[1:46:02] I see that he said the way he said that
[1:46:04] I've heard it preached he said is that
[1:46:05] it's something in the future I said I
[1:46:08] said but see when you when you when you
[1:46:10] identify as something in the future you
[1:46:11] miss the blessing that's in that which
[1:46:14] is taking place right now because we
[1:46:16] don't need it in the future we need the
[1:46:17] latter rain right now that's what
[1:46:19] matures Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:46:22] that's what that what moves Upon Our
[1:46:24] Life to bring forth Sons and Daughters
[1:46:26] of God and we mature and we grow closer
[1:46:28] to him I'm just so grateful that God in
[1:46:31] this hour he has fulfilled his promise
[1:46:33] evening light in this hour amen that
[1:46:36] book the book has been taken amen and
[1:46:39] now that book itself that has been taken
[1:46:41] is placed within the heart of the
[1:46:42] believer we're looking in the scripture
[1:46:44] and not seeing things of the past but
[1:46:46] we're seeing what God did in the past
[1:46:48] that he's doing it right now it was
[1:46:50] wrote it was lived in Prophecy for this
[1:46:53] hour amen don't you love him I tell you
[1:46:56] that it's it's exciting and you see it
[1:46:58] that this this we're living in this time
[1:47:00] of where God would bring Sons and
[1:47:02] Daughters of God back to where it was in
[1:47:04] Eden where it's words word born spoken
[1:47:07] word sons that speak the word not under
[1:47:10] the authority of a of a blood of bulls
[1:47:12] and goats which Moses did but he had
[1:47:14] that Authority cuz God gave him that
[1:47:16] Authority but when God has given us this
[1:47:17] Authority that comes under the blood of
[1:47:19] Jesus Christ there's not a devil that
[1:47:21] can stand before that word that's spoken
[1:47:24] by a son and daughter of God my my we
