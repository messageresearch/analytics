[36:53] what a wonderful reality
[36:56] amen what a wonderful reality
[36:58] and we're going to let you have your
[36:59] seats here just for a moment
[37:05] just ask that uh different uh some
[37:07] different requests and so forth that had
[37:09] come in even while you all were praying
[37:12] up there and before
[37:15] thursday night i
[37:16] was trying to read the one request from
[37:19] sister ethelene
[37:20] and
[37:22] i read it as though there was a
[37:24] baby but i guess no matter how old a
[37:26] person is they're they're they're the
[37:27] mother's baby
[37:29] and so the individual was actually
[37:31] sister ethelene brother joseph their
[37:34] neighbor
[37:36] the young man was actually 20 years old
[37:39] and when they come home not sister
[37:41] ethelene
[37:42] but their neighbors when they came home
[37:45] they found
[37:46] the young man deceased
[37:48] so then
[37:49] thursday night everything you know was
[37:51] encased there with firemen and police
[37:53] and that happened just
[37:54] early in the evening so
[37:57] just wanted to make a correction on that
[37:59] and then there's no with that right
[38:00] there with sister ethelene there's some
[38:02] other quest that she had with family
[38:05] things like that is taking place and you
[38:07] know i just mentioned it like this and
[38:09] i'd say to all of us
[38:11] brother jack was preaching last week and
[38:13] ministering
[38:14] he didn't put that scripture in there
[38:16] but there's only so much you can go into
[38:18] in a time but i just i love the
[38:21] scripture where it says when my heart is
[38:23] overwhelmed
[38:25] lead me
[38:26] to the rock
[38:28] that is higher than i
[38:30] and i like how it says that lead me i
[38:32] need leadership
[38:34] lead me to the rock that's higher than i
[38:36] and then it immediately goes into the
[38:37] next scripture it says for thou
[38:40] hast been a shelter
[38:43] amen i rock
[38:45] is christ jesus
[38:47] he is our shelter and i just i was just
[38:50] um
[38:51] sent that you know to our sister and the
[38:54] different ones there i also want to ask
[38:56] that you would keep in prayer
[38:59] from brother mike wall's church there in
[39:01] washington dc
[39:03] there is a sister where she had went
[39:05] into labor
[39:07] the young young family
[39:09] and
[39:10] there was a condition that had come up
[39:13] and i guess was already there a tumor
[39:15] that was in her in her brain or in her
[39:18] head
[39:19] and um
[39:20] since the time of
[39:22] delivery
[39:24] she's
[39:25] she's not come to it's been been in a
[39:28] coleman it's actually been for for quite
[39:30] a few it's been over a week now
[39:32] so we've been praying and it's just
[39:34] i haven't mentioned it from the pulpit
[39:36] just simply because if i don't do this
[39:39] right here it's not that it's not
[39:40] important that i have to write things
[39:42] down and it's before me on my phone but
[39:44] i wanted to bring it before you if
[39:47] you'll just keep that in prayer there's
[39:48] still the husband is sitting right there
[39:51] and they're believing for a miracle
[39:53] the baby was just born
[39:55] and so they have two other
[39:57] children and from what the report was is
[39:59] that you know the doctors whether they
[40:01] you know maybe it was a condition right
[40:03] there with a tumor they just weren't
[40:05] even aware about that was in the head
[40:07] but i just asked if you'll just keep her
[40:09] her name is sister solace
[40:11] if you'll just keep her in prayer
[40:14] and uh would you do that
[40:16] amen and i just um
[40:18] just been praying for it i know churches

[41:22] they brought young children to him to
[41:24] the lord jesus
[41:25] that he
[41:27] should touch them
[41:29] and his disciples
[41:31] they didn't understand what was going on
[41:35] but those were the parents they were
[41:36] moved
[41:37] they wanted him to touch them
[41:40] and that's what every one of us as
[41:42] parents when we dedicate our children to
[41:44] the lord
[41:45] we desire he would touch them and
[41:47] there'd be touches multiple touches
[41:49] after that he'd just keep touching them
[41:51] in services and keep touching them
[41:53] through a long life
[41:55] amen
[41:57] so much so that i love when
[42:00] when jacob was standing there and
[42:04] he crossed the hands were crossed
[42:07] and i love the
[42:09] the inspiration where jacob speaks with
[42:12] in that moment
[42:13] he says
[42:14] may the same angel that redeemed me
[42:18] redeemed them also
[42:21] he knew he had confidence in his token
[42:26] that what the token did for me it'll do
[42:28] for them

[46:03] it's fine
[46:06] thank you
[46:09] god bless you
[46:12] i promise to the lord to do this
[46:14] testimony because
[46:17] when my wife got pregnant we went to the
[46:20] hospital after the second ultrasound
[46:22] exams
[46:23] and they said the baby had
[46:26] genetic
[46:32] right arm
[46:34] bend
[46:35] and the
[46:36] radius was shot
[46:39] at that time they asked us to make a lot
[46:42] of exams including the amniocentesis
[46:46] the exam consists to send a syringe in
[46:49] the mum belly to take the amnesty
[46:52] straight baby
[46:54] and other example negative
[46:57] i went by that time to the pastor and i
[46:59] spoke to him and he said do you believe
[47:01] that you can't do a miracle for your
[47:03] children
[47:04] i say yes i believe
[47:06] we pray that day
[47:08] we went to the hospital and they said
[47:11] we can have a normal delivery because
[47:15] baby my bleeding by the brain so that's
[47:18] why i scheduled a c-section
[47:22] and that day
[47:25] today i'm really happy i thank god
[47:28] thank you for your support for your
[47:30] prayers
[47:32] and that there
[47:33] because she has a
[47:35] low platelet level in her blood like a
[47:38] mom
[47:39] and i remember that day when she went
[47:42] to this world
[47:43] and they made a blood exam they say well
[47:46] the level of the planet of the baby is
[47:49] 100 000
[47:50] the normal range is between 150 and 180
[47:54] so they're gonna try to observe her
[47:56] if she need a transparent blood
[47:59] transfusion
[48:00] and the second day
[48:02] it was 105 000 per milliliter so a
[48:05] little bit less
[48:08] i uh sorry the first day when she coming
[48:11] it was 108 he made it test that day
[48:14] after it was 1-5
[48:17] second day was 128
[48:19] and the last day of the day when we
[48:21] went out of the hospital it was 149
[48:23] and i said thank god for that
[48:26] and there is a little thing after
[48:29] two weeks ago
[48:30] they called us to the hospital again and
[48:32] i said well
[48:33] we want to
[48:34] make another genetic test i said well
[48:37] there's something wrong with the baby he
[48:39] said no no no there's no real no
[48:41] it's just a we had a seminar about home
[48:43] because we didn't understand our kids
[48:50] exams
[48:51] and they ask us
[48:53] if we want to
[48:55] participate for a study with kent state
[48:57] university for some
[48:58] genetic disorder or something like that
[49:01] i said no i don't
[49:02] because i know
[49:04] uh jesus killed her
[49:07] so i really thank god
[49:10] [Applause]
[49:19] well praise the lord
[49:26] and so praise we thank god for that
[49:28] don't you
[49:31] just have uh the midst of
[49:33] everything i want to share just an
[49:36] update also with the building project
[49:38] very quickly um
[49:41] the
[49:42] i just
[49:43] just thanking the lord i tell you with
[49:45] that i'm glad that constantine gave
[49:48] gave us
[49:49] testimony
[49:51] just how that god has moved each step of
[49:54] the way you know it's like kind of like
[49:56] it says
[49:58] i don't know the song right now i can't
[50:00] think of the full lyrics but it says
[50:03] how god made a way it says i don't know
[50:05] how
[50:06] that you did it
[50:08] i don't know how but he did it
[50:11] and that's that's such a
[50:13] such a blessing to see
[50:15] how god how god has moved for that for
[50:18] that need
[50:19] amen
[50:20] i just want to brother brian can you
[50:22] give me that up there number number two
[50:25] for that fleece
[50:28] on the
[50:29] no on there switch it over on the scaler
[50:32] switcher
[50:44] i think i'm plugged in here
[50:47] there we go okay
[50:50] okay so i just want to do this here on
[50:53] this
[50:53] update what you see going on so that
[50:55] you're you're aware
[50:57] of these things the things we have was
[51:00] the with the three
[51:02] three different phases
[51:03] and i'll just kind of allude to those
[51:06] the first phase which we see out here
[51:08] right now where the concrete has been
[51:10] poured
[51:11] my goodness i'm thankful for that aren't
[51:12] you
[51:13] and it certainly made things a lot nicer
[51:16] for us and
[51:17] we just thank god for that
[51:20] the second phase that was and it's all
[51:22] all of it's kind of put together but
[51:24] just to kind of separate it and you'll
[51:26] see why
[51:27] but the second phase you've already seen
[51:29] two of the steps on either side there
[51:31] that's been placed in their
[51:33] steps
[51:34] here at this door and back there and
[51:35] then they're also going to place steps
[51:38] over there that are that are
[51:40] pre-made and the brothers elected going
[51:43] with that because
[51:45] so that those things sometimes where
[51:47] they've seen brother richie had
[51:49] inspected that and the brothers were
[51:50] also talking about it where sometimes
[51:52] the steps themselves you'll see them
[51:53] when they're attached and they end up
[51:54] cracking and breaking up and so if
[51:57] something happens with the steps we can
[51:58] always replace that
[52:00] um but we just that's where they elected
[52:02] it so the second phase was the steps um
[52:05] and there's you see those out there and
[52:07] it's also the railings and that's all
[52:09] being done through illyria concrete and
[52:11] the railings themselves
[52:13] what you see here on this step and what
[52:15] you see back there
[52:17] that's the same thing that will be
[52:19] on this whole setup out here is those
[52:22] railings so they're you know kind of
[52:24] like everything else they're kind of
[52:26] backed up and i think it's been at a
[52:28] month from whenever they measured it
[52:30] brother carlos you were here when they
[52:31] measured it
[52:35] okay
[52:38] okay so towards the end of the month or
[52:40] earlier those railings will go in
[52:42] and then um
[52:44] phase three that'll be where we put then
[52:46] the roofing over top of the ramp as well
[52:49] as over top of the area that we step out
[52:52] on uh to give us the protection and
[52:54] things like that from the rain and so
[52:56] forth so just so that you you see
[52:59] what's going on the first phase which
[53:01] was the concrete and that's what we had
[53:02] put before
[53:04] um and had to work on and that was the
[53:07] 14
[53:08] 800
[53:09] the second phase that was the stairs and
[53:11] the railings and having them do it
[53:12] that's seven thousand five hundred
[53:15] dollars and then the phase three brother
[53:17] richie has that estimated out but not
[53:19] with the metal roofing cost yet but
[53:21] that's four thousand just for
[53:23] uh the lumber
[53:25] and
[53:26] right now at this time this is a total
[53:29] before today's offering this is what we
[53:31] have taken in i i know that
[53:33] we may not be experts in math but we can
[53:35] look at that and you can say well that's
[53:37] 16 uh four almost and this over here
[53:41] just don't seem like it's lining up
[53:42] we're about nine thousand dollars off
[53:44] well
[53:45] just so you understand i wanted you to
[53:48] underst understand and be aware of it
[53:51] and the trustees as well is that
[53:54] within a project as we're going through
[53:57] that there is we have a savings but the
[54:00] savings itself is for those things that
[54:03] if something comes up that's completely
[54:05] unforeseen that comes along the way
[54:08] um you know i know we've talked about it
[54:12] different times there's been talks
[54:13] sometimes about sewers and they you know
[54:15] and that's never happened down through
[54:16] there yet but we just tried you know how
[54:19] it is in your own finances you try to
[54:21] have something to offset a rainy day
[54:23] fund and god and that through your
[54:25] giving this right here through your
[54:27] giving and your sacrifice and even with
[54:29] the savings that's there it allows us to
[54:31] keep moving with the project so things
[54:34] are being done and we're just as we're
[54:36] taking the offerings it just continues
[54:37] to
[54:39] go right back in there anything that we
[54:40] have to pull from there
[54:42] and then
[54:44] we have just a
[54:45] few more times going into the fall where
[54:47] we'll do the special offering and then
[54:50] as god with terry and just continuing
[54:52] upon our hearts that we just uh should
[54:55] be able to completely recoup that and
[54:57] continue to put back in savings uh
[55:00] because there's also some other things
[55:01] the brothers you'll see these some of
[55:02] these piles out here and um of rock of
[55:06] the stone and things like that and
[55:07] there's
[55:08] even in the midst of all of this
[55:11] there also you know that the property at
[55:13] times where this with the parking lot
[55:14] there's been a huge need for draining
[55:17] we that's why we haven't been able to
[55:19] put a
[55:20] you know concrete or black top down
[55:22] because you have to have drainage and so
[55:24] that's also they're going to be doing
[55:26] that from the corner back there and all
[55:29] the way out to the street to get that
[55:31] drainage and the neighbor over here next
[55:34] door gus who's been so so good to us um
[55:38] he he's been uh talking to
[55:41] brother richie here for quite some time
[55:42] and he said that he said if you do it he
[55:44] said i'll pay half the cost to get it
[55:47] done so
[55:48] he's because it's a need to that water
[55:50] coming it comes in like that and so we
[55:53] need to get it out there to the street
[55:55] and then as that's being done over here
[55:58] where that grass is you know
[56:00] when you drive out that service drive
[56:03] all of that's going to be graveled in so
[56:04] that the parking lot itself will be
[56:07] extended so we don't have to try to
[56:10] if you look out there right now and
[56:11] probably take some pictures you'd kind
[56:13] of wonder how do people park
[56:16] and we have had some individuals even
[56:17] over the past that you know they've
[56:19] parked over here you know in that grass
[56:21] area
[56:22] my goodness i mean you know you just
[56:24] sink you almost feel like you're in
[56:25] quicksand around here
[56:27] so we we just we thank the lord for that
[56:30] and i ask you just to
[56:31] continue to pray and pray may god richly
[56:34] bless you amen as you give as you've
[56:36] continued to give and amen it's it's

[1:03:21] amen would you turn with me to psalms 23
[1:03:23] thank you musicians
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:28] psalms 23
[1:03:38] i'm just going to begin reading here
[1:03:40] from verse 1
[1:03:42] and just
[1:03:43] drawing from this as
[1:03:45] as a background here
[1:03:48] the psalm of david
[1:03:51] the lord is my shepherd
[1:03:54] i shall not want
[1:03:57] he maketh me to lie down
[1:03:59] in green pastures
[1:04:02] he leadeth me beside
[1:04:04] the still waters
[1:04:06] he restoreth my soul
[1:04:10] he leadeth me in the paths of
[1:04:12] righteousness
[1:04:14] for his namesake
[1:04:16] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:04:18] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[1:04:22] for thou art with me
[1:04:25] thy rod in thy staff
[1:04:27] they comfort me
[1:04:29] thou preparest a table before me
[1:04:32] in the presence of mine enemies
[1:04:35] thou anointest my head with oil
[1:04:38] and my cup runneth over
[1:04:40] surely goodness and mercy
[1:04:43] shall follow me
[1:04:45] all the days of my life
[1:04:47] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:04:49] lord
[1:04:50] forever
[1:04:52] amen may the lord
[1:04:54] bless the reading of the word bless you
[1:04:55] as you're being seated
[1:04:57] i'd like to just speak on
[1:04:59] continue with that thought
[1:05:01] the lord
[1:05:03] is my shepherd
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:07] we were looking at here
[1:05:09] just
[1:05:11] a couple weeks ago
[1:05:13] and i the question that i posed
[1:05:16] within that
[1:05:18] the lord is my shepherd
[1:05:20] with is who is your king
[1:05:24] it's very
[1:05:25] very clear here david is writing under
[1:05:28] inspiration
[1:05:29] and david is declaring the lord is my
[1:05:32] shepherd
[1:05:33] and all these scriptures you can put
[1:05:35] together of psalms 23
[1:05:37] david is expressing in that very first
[1:05:39] verse the lord is my shepherd
[1:05:42] and i shall not want that
[1:05:44] he's my complete
[1:05:46] satisfaction
[1:05:50] that was also
[1:05:51] david was able to have an experience to
[1:05:54] the degree
[1:05:56] that god had given and allotted in that
[1:05:58] time because the perfect sacrifice had
[1:06:00] not come
[1:06:02] right
[1:06:03] but it was prophecy of what would come
[1:06:05] when the perfect sacrifice would come
[1:06:08] when the antitype of the type the lamb
[1:06:11] of god would come and the blood would be
[1:06:14] shed for the remission of sins to pay
[1:06:18] that sin debt that then
[1:06:20] the lord himself
[1:06:23] would be a would now come in to dwell
[1:06:26] in the hearts and lives of an individual
[1:06:29] then there's this this scripture becomes
[1:06:32] to the aphex or to the fulfillment the
[1:06:35] lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:06:39] to where there's no other desire but him
[1:06:44] and so when we see this i i mentioned to
[1:06:47] you
[1:06:48] uh
[1:06:50] that
[1:06:50] the
[1:06:51] when brother branham preaches the
[1:06:53] message rejected king and i mentioned to
[1:06:55] you before and i'll say it again
[1:06:57] just from where i'm we're drawing things
[1:06:59] from if you haven't
[1:07:01] listened to he preaches that twice the
[1:07:03] message rejected king
[1:07:05] and brother adam goes from preaching the
[1:07:08] message rejected king going right
[1:07:10] straight into preaching the adoption
[1:07:12] series and that's where the placement
[1:07:15] that we are called to in this hour where
[1:07:17] the spirit of god taking us fully into
[1:07:21] christ because we realize where we are
[1:07:24] at in this hour
[1:07:25] that it the call and the urn the
[1:07:28] yearning for of the even the earth is
[1:07:31] groaning and travailing as it says in
[1:07:33] romans 8 for the manifestation of the
[1:07:36] sons of god
[1:07:38] and we are here in this hour god has
[1:07:41] sent to you and i
[1:07:42] the message
[1:07:44] that message did not it's not been
[1:07:46] reflected from a seminary it has not
[1:07:50] been reflected and
[1:07:52] from from a man's mind remember those
[1:07:54] seven stars that are in the right hand
[1:07:57] and the right hand symbolizing the very
[1:08:00] power of god the godhead all of his
[1:08:03] strength all of his deity those stars
[1:08:06] are there not to emit their own light
[1:08:09] they are there to reflect his light his
[1:08:13] glory his power all that he is into the
[1:08:16] church of the living god
[1:08:18] and then
[1:08:19] by god's grace
[1:08:21] not anything that we have done
[1:08:24] to make ourselves but god in himself
[1:08:28] knows when he sends his word there's
[1:08:31] going to be a people though we were not
[1:08:33] just in darkness in our life paul said
[1:08:36] we were darkness
[1:08:38] but there's a there is a part within us
[1:08:41] a seed like that's buried in the earth
[1:08:44] that when that reflection of jesus
[1:08:46] christ is emitted in into this
[1:08:49] generation there is like a wick on a
[1:08:53] candle that is made to capture that
[1:08:56] light and display that light
[1:08:58] to display jesus christ as the same
[1:09:01] yesterday today and forever to serve the
[1:09:04] purpose of god in this hour and that's
[1:09:06] all the grace of god
[1:09:09] and so when we when we see that when
[1:09:12] brother adam was was speaking of this uh
[1:09:14] in the in rejected king and remember
[1:09:17] he's just come and i just want to lay
[1:09:19] this in he's just come from beyond the
[1:09:21] curtain of time where god allowed him to
[1:09:24] see beyond the curtain of time and when
[1:09:26] brother banham steps out from that and
[1:09:28] coming too he's he's remember he's he's
[1:09:31] laying there in his bed and he's saying
[1:09:34] i keep pressing keep pressing keep
[1:09:37] pressing and he says i'm more determined
[1:09:41] now
[1:09:42] than i've ever been
[1:09:43] and after coming back from that
[1:09:45] experience he says i can no longer be
[1:09:48] the same william branham you see every
[1:09:51] experience that we have with god it
[1:09:54] brings a further change in our life
[1:09:57] our further experience with god should
[1:10:00] in every service and and it should be
[1:10:03] something we desire just you know
[1:10:05] spending time with the lord and you
[1:10:07] don't have to confine it just to a
[1:10:10] prayer closet on your knees he he's
[1:10:12] there with you he wants he wants to have
[1:10:15] a relationship with you
[1:10:17] he wants to speak to you he wants to
[1:10:20] know you he wants us to to talk with him
[1:10:22] and to think of this of how that god in
[1:10:25] his mercy how that he would speak into
[1:10:29] our lives that experiences that would so
[1:10:31] affect us that would cause us to look
[1:10:34] beyond the things of the world and all
[1:10:36] the troubles and everything that's there
[1:10:39] before us i thank god for strength that
[1:10:41] comes by true holy ghost experiences
[1:10:45] and so i i start here this morning if we
[1:10:48] could and i want to look at a scripture
[1:10:51] out of first samuel 19 and and and and
[1:10:55] kind of compound on that point of who is
[1:10:57] your king but i want to compound it with
[1:11:00] this question this morning have you come
[1:11:02] under the headship of the word
[1:11:06] have you come under the headship
[1:11:08] of the word
[1:11:10] now headship itself i'm just going to
[1:11:12] read this definition headship is the
[1:11:14] position of head or chief or chief
[1:11:18] authority
[1:11:19] leadership
[1:11:21] or supremacy
[1:11:23] now first samuel 19 and verse 18 we're
[1:11:25] gonna break in here on on saul and david
[1:11:29] david's running from saul
[1:11:31] and here we find even you know the times
[1:11:34] in in the presence there of saul
[1:11:36] that saul and that evil spirit would
[1:11:38] come upon him and he would take that
[1:11:41] javelin and he tried to even to kill
[1:11:43] david many times
[1:11:45] and many things that we could you you
[1:11:48] know in the scripture that
[1:11:50] saul was in pursuit of david's spirit of
[1:11:53] jealousy it was an evil spirit a spirit
[1:11:56] of malice all of those things
[1:11:58] and and so when we when we break in on
[1:12:01] this this is where we're coming to where
[1:12:03] david himself has fled in verse 18
[1:12:06] if you allow me to read this it says in
[1:12:09] first samuel 19 18 so david fled and
[1:12:12] escaped and came to samuel to rhema and
[1:12:15] told him all that saw it done to him and
[1:12:17] he and saul went and dwelt and nailed
[1:12:20] and it was told saul saying behold david
[1:12:23] is at naoth in rhema and saul sent
[1:12:26] messengers to take david and when they
[1:12:29] saw the company of the prophets
[1:12:31] prophesying and samuel standing as
[1:12:33] appointed over them the spirit of god
[1:12:36] was upon the messengers of saul and they
[1:12:39] also prophesied and when he was told
[1:12:42] saul he sent other messengers and they
[1:12:45] prophesied likewise and saul sent
[1:12:48] messengers again the third time and they
[1:12:50] prophesied also
[1:12:52] then went he also to rhema so
[1:12:54] into the picture he's been sending
[1:12:56] messengers and when messengers are
[1:12:59] getting there to rhema they're coming
[1:13:01] under that anointing and they start
[1:13:03] prophesying
[1:13:05] so eventually
[1:13:07] if we could say it you know in layman's
[1:13:09] terms saul is not going to send
[1:13:11] messengers no more he's going to go
[1:13:14] so then the bible says in verse 22 then
[1:13:17] he went also to rhema and came to a
[1:13:20] great well that is sekku and he asked
[1:13:22] and said where are samuel and david and
[1:13:25] once said behold they be it nailed in
[1:13:28] rhema and he went thither to nail in
[1:13:30] rhema and the spirit of god was upon him
[1:13:33] also
[1:13:34] and he went on and prophesied until he
[1:13:37] came to naoth in rhema he stripped off
[1:13:40] his clothes also now down to his linen
[1:13:42] breeches and prophesied before samuel in
[1:13:45] like manner let me just stop on that
[1:13:47] when it says strip down to his clothes
[1:13:49] you realize what that is
[1:13:52] that's why wearing shorts is nakedness
[1:13:56] we'll just drop that in while while
[1:13:57] that's here
[1:14:00] hallelujah david was down to a loincloth
[1:14:03] remember stripped of stripped of his
[1:14:05] clothes now notice prophesied before
[1:14:08] samuel in light mammoth manor and laid
[1:14:11] down naked all that day and all that
[1:14:14] night and wherefore they say is saul
[1:14:17] also
[1:14:18] among the prophets
[1:14:21] now
[1:14:22] i want you to remember
[1:14:24] all of these messengers
[1:14:26] are not going
[1:14:28] to salute david or commend david
[1:14:31] remember saul does not know as far as
[1:14:35] that he was there to witness david's
[1:14:37] anointing
[1:14:39] but
[1:14:39] saul begins to recognize
[1:14:42] there is a favor that is about this
[1:14:45] young man's life
[1:14:47] as a matter of fact when you read on
[1:14:48] further in the scripture it was david's
[1:14:51] behavior his character that actually is
[1:14:56] what made saul to know
[1:14:58] he is the king
[1:15:02] so you see whatever takes place in
[1:15:05] secret will be made known openly
[1:15:08] glory be to god
[1:15:10] but but when we look at this and and
[1:15:13] this whole the whole thought within all
[1:15:14] of this stuff the lord is my shepherd i
[1:15:17] begin to just meditating upon many of
[1:15:20] these things and you know and and just
[1:15:23] seeing it and when you look at it he
[1:15:26] sends messengers and the spirit of god
[1:15:30] will go upon those messengers and
[1:15:32] they're there to take david and you know
[1:15:34] they don't come back with david saul he
[1:15:36] goes now saul's not going there you and
[1:15:39] i could look at it if we were to talk to
[1:15:41] saul on his way to rhema we would say
[1:15:44] this guy is of no good humor at all he's
[1:15:47] after david he's he's there to get him
[1:15:50] we would we maybe the way we would look
[1:15:52] at it and say how could the spirit of
[1:15:54] god come upon that
[1:15:56] and we look at how that he he's pursuing
[1:15:58] david he's after to take david they see
[1:16:01] the spirit that's upon him wants to
[1:16:04] destroy david
[1:16:06] right
[1:16:07] but he comes into a situation let's just
[1:16:10] say he comes into a service and the
[1:16:13] anointing of the spirit of god comes
[1:16:15] down upon saul and saul begins to
[1:16:18] prophesy just like everybody else
[1:16:23] and no doubt they can look and say you
[1:16:25] saw my praise the lord the holy ghost
[1:16:28] has come upon him he's a changed man
[1:16:33] but when it departs
[1:16:36] he's the same old saul
[1:16:41] he's no different
[1:16:43] so you see the holy spirit can come
[1:16:46] even in a life if a life has even not
[1:16:49] truly truly repented you can feel the
[1:16:53] spirit of god and it's a must that you
[1:16:56] do
[1:16:57] sense the spirit of god because it's the
[1:16:59] holy ghost that leads you to repent of
[1:17:02] your sins
[1:17:04] right
[1:17:04] but to recognize when the anointing
[1:17:07] itself and as that anointing is coming
[1:17:10] there saul you can read after this in
[1:17:13] other chapters he's still the same old
[1:17:16] saul
[1:17:19] brother branham remember with the
[1:17:20] message as we're talking about the
[1:17:22] headship we're talking about the
[1:17:25] anointing of the word of the holy spirit
[1:17:27] as we're referring back in the scripture
[1:17:30] that that though that in the beginning
[1:17:32] was the word and the word was with god
[1:17:34] and the word was god it that's what the
[1:17:37] holy spirit is it is the word of god the
[1:17:41] heavenly father coming into that life
[1:17:44] and setting upon the throne in our life
[1:17:48] not just something that we have an
[1:17:50] experience with and it leaves us when
[1:17:52] we're the same person no the holy spirit
[1:17:55] is come to bring a transformation in our
[1:17:59] life to where our lives become fully
[1:18:02] under the headship of the world in other
[1:18:04] words where christ has full preeminence
[1:18:07] in every minute detail of our life
[1:18:11] in other words we don't leave him at
[1:18:12] church and pick him up whenever we come
[1:18:15] and and you know put him back on that's
[1:18:17] not how we serve god that's not the
[1:18:20] headship of the word but the headship of
[1:18:22] the word is where the person of jesus
[1:18:25] christ has come and set down upon that
[1:18:27] life and it changes that life and that
[1:18:30] life is ordered by the headship of jesus
[1:18:33] christ he's preeminent
[1:18:37] brother iran deals with this and you're
[1:18:39] very much aware
[1:18:40] as uh bible readers are and even within
[1:18:43] the message but i'm just gonna lay this
[1:18:45] there are three realms that you and i
[1:18:47] are aware of that we live in we live
[1:18:49] flesh
[1:18:50] spirit and soul
[1:18:53] a person can have the anointing on their
[1:18:55] flesh
[1:18:56] and that doesn't change
[1:18:58] they can have it upon their spirit it
[1:19:00] doesn't change them
[1:19:02] but the holy the real new birth is where
[1:19:05] that saw on the inside
[1:19:07] that all that old nature that old soul
[1:19:10] dies
[1:19:12] and there's a new man that get raised up
[1:19:15] not not just a divorce a divorce isn't
[1:19:17] good enough
[1:19:21] devotee can't be just divorced
[1:19:23] because jesus will never marry someone
[1:19:26] who's got a living husband it's against
[1:19:28] his word
[1:19:30] are you hearing me that first husband
[1:19:32] that first nature has got to die
[1:19:37] is that right
[1:19:38] that's to where that then that he
[1:19:40] becomes the lord of our life
[1:19:44] now brother adam deals with this on how
[1:19:46] that the holy spirit he said it's got to
[1:19:48] come in the right order of the anointing
[1:19:52] because it can fall upon our flesh it
[1:19:54] could fall upon our spirit but but god's
[1:19:57] desire is that that word would fall and
[1:20:01] bring the transformation on the inside
[1:20:04] of our life this is why
[1:20:06] when you look
[1:20:08] uh
[1:20:08] all the way you can look in many realms
[1:20:11] of christendom and you see these things
[1:20:13] that is actually a fulfillment of
[1:20:15] matthew 24 where it says false christ
[1:20:19] would arise christ meaning anointed ones
[1:20:23] they would arise showing many great
[1:20:26] signs and wonders
[1:20:28] and they point to the signs and wonders
[1:20:30] as their vindication
[1:20:33] but if there but if the voice that's
[1:20:35] behind that signs and wonders does not
[1:20:38] speak according to the word it's not of
[1:20:41] god
[1:20:44] now i mean you know we thank god for the
[1:20:46] rain that we've had right i've done my
[1:20:47] natural rain
[1:20:49] yeah everybody's awake right
[1:20:51] i don't know what day it was this week
[1:20:52] but man i thank god for that rain that
[1:20:54] came
[1:20:55] the nice ring kind of cool things down a
[1:20:57] little human at first but you know what
[1:20:59] there's i have certain weeds that are
[1:21:01] growing on the edges of my property i
[1:21:03] have weeds that are growing in my flower
[1:21:05] beds that i have to go out there and
[1:21:07] pick out and underneath different trees
[1:21:09] and so forth i don't like doing that
[1:21:11] i wish that i could somehow control the
[1:21:14] rain and say don't water if you see a
[1:21:17] weed don't fall on it
[1:21:20] right
[1:21:21] look at me trains every one of you would
[1:21:22] like that same thing
[1:21:24] and if we had our way we'd go start
[1:21:25] putting buckets on where they could
[1:21:27] possibly be we'd have to cover
[1:21:28] everything
[1:21:29] but you see that's why jesus said the
[1:21:31] rain falleth on the just and the unjust
[1:21:36] the same holy spirit that can come down
[1:21:38] because man can't do that
[1:21:41] it's not a devil healing another person
[1:21:44] satan has no ability or authority to do
[1:21:48] that
[1:21:49] it's god
[1:21:52] is that right
[1:21:53] but you see this is why
[1:21:55] that even where the holy spirit coming
[1:21:59] you know bill the brahman said they can
[1:22:00] perform just as many miracles as the
[1:22:03] true gospel
[1:22:04] but it's by the word being here he says
[1:22:08] and that's what does it you see he says
[1:22:11] if the true spirit of god is there it'll
[1:22:15] direct it into the word not just one
[1:22:18] place in the word the entire word for
[1:22:21] the entire age now let me just let me
[1:22:23] just say it in this manner the scripture
[1:22:26] says that when the holy spirit is come
[1:22:29] the comforter when he has come and
[1:22:32] remember who is this comforter it's god
[1:22:34] himself it's the holy spirit it's the
[1:22:37] word jesus said i will not leave you
[1:22:40] comfortless i will come to you
[1:22:43] and this comforter says that he might
[1:22:46] abide with you
[1:22:48] there's no there's no way once he has
[1:22:50] come into that rightful place i don't
[1:22:53] care what test what trial what
[1:22:56] circumstance comes your way your flesh
[1:22:59] might get weak your spirit can get weary
[1:23:02] but you have one on the control tower on
[1:23:06] the inside who's there to give you
[1:23:08] strength and direct you through it all
[1:23:10] and say i don't know how it's all going
[1:23:12] to happen but i know in whom i have
[1:23:15] believed and i'm persuaded that he is
[1:23:18] able not i'm able he is able to keep
[1:23:21] that which i've committed to him against
[1:23:23] today
[1:23:24] so that's our confidence see our
[1:23:26] confidence comes back into the sacred
[1:23:29] sands of god's grace
[1:23:31] and let me tell you something you always
[1:23:32] you got to visit those sacred sands
[1:23:35] i i you know brother branham talks about
[1:23:37] when when here the you know the dreams
[1:23:39] and visions were happening about the
[1:23:41] oncoming visitation and the opening of
[1:23:44] the seven seals remember brother brahm
[1:23:45] did not know what was taking place and
[1:23:47] he's standing before his congregation
[1:23:49] there and he's speaking is this the sign
[1:23:52] of the insurers and brother graham is
[1:23:54] looking at things could it be and seeing
[1:23:56] all these dreams and visions and things
[1:23:58] beginning to come together and brother
[1:24:00] brahm says i must get away and i must
[1:24:03] seek the will of almighty god i must go
[1:24:06] back to the sacred sands to seek god's
[1:24:09] direction well what is the sacred sands
[1:24:12] that's your personal experience with
[1:24:15] jesus christ
[1:24:16] those are grounds can i say it that no
[1:24:19] devil can put his dirty feet on
[1:24:24] no devil can put his feet on those
[1:24:26] sacred sands
[1:24:28] and that's where we go we go to him
[1:24:30] we're relying on his leadership in our
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:34] and so with that being said
[1:24:37] knowing that every part of our life
[1:24:39] we need his leadership don't we
[1:24:43] we need it and you know even when the
[1:24:45] holy spirit has come
[1:24:47] uh it's not just so something we just go
[1:24:49] on autopilot but we become so aware
[1:24:52] and asking lord
[1:24:54] lead me and guide me and even when there
[1:24:57] have been mistakes or decisions or times
[1:25:01] that we've went off without really
[1:25:03] seeking his will and really praying
[1:25:05] about it as a believer we learn from
[1:25:08] those things
[1:25:10] we're corrected by the holy spirit on
[1:25:12] the inside
[1:25:14] right
[1:25:15] it brings a correction to our life
[1:25:17] because this is the promise that the
[1:25:19] spirit of truth will lead and guide us
[1:25:21] into all truth and he's still guiding us
[1:25:25] he's leading us
[1:25:27] that's what it is you know we're not
[1:25:28] we're not born again and all of a sudden
[1:25:30] mature overnight
[1:25:33] i pray god gives me grace of some things
[1:25:35] i've studied on for a few years to be
[1:25:37] able to bring those things but we do not
[1:25:39] grow up overnight there's a maturing
[1:25:42] that takes place in our life once we're
[1:25:45] born of the spirit of god just like the
[1:25:47] little baby little emma that we
[1:25:48] dedicated right here if god tarries
[1:25:51] there's gonna come a time here where
[1:25:53] brother constantine his wife and they'll
[1:25:54] have to start watching where she's
[1:25:56] walking and they'll have to start you
[1:25:58] know lending their fingers and she'll
[1:26:00] move from a walker to start doing other
[1:26:02] things you know all that part is as
[1:26:04] she's growing and developing and the
[1:26:07] things that shall be doing and walking
[1:26:08] and learning to walk all of that is part
[1:26:11] of growth and development and maturity
[1:26:14] and that's how it is in our lives as
[1:26:17] believers
[1:26:20] now
[1:26:20] with that i want to just you know bring
[1:26:23] it into this
[1:26:24] into this place when we deal with
[1:26:26] headship and it comes down to a question
[1:26:29] on who is your leader
[1:26:32] who is your leader it's very important
[1:26:34] to know who your leader is
[1:26:36] because remember there was a group of
[1:26:39] geese
[1:26:40] that you know when the geese began to
[1:26:42] swarm
[1:26:43] and going south to the you know to the
[1:26:44] rice fields there in louisiana that here
[1:26:47] came up a gander and this guy he took
[1:26:50] them clear over there to england
[1:26:53] maybe it's because they were canadian
[1:26:54] geese
[1:26:55] [Laughter]
[1:27:02] just a little just a little
[1:27:06] but you know they still don't know what
[1:27:07] to do once that that leader got off
[1:27:09] course and took him over there
[1:27:12] now that that leader looked the same as
[1:27:14] them
[1:27:16] they were hearing his hawk and he was
[1:27:18] you know he was he was assuming that
[1:27:20] position
[1:27:22] but look where it led him
[1:27:24] they couldn't need they couldn't get
[1:27:25] back over here
[1:27:27] because they didn't know what to do
[1:27:29] where did we miss the mark how did we
[1:27:30] get out of line oh i
[1:27:33] i'm so glad that the holy spirit as
[1:27:36] david said this is the beauty of
[1:27:38] headship of the word of god that he
[1:27:41] restoreth my soul
[1:27:45] let me just say this to you
[1:27:47] we need his restoration in our lives
[1:27:52] we need the new birth and we need his
[1:27:55] restoration each moment his leadership
[1:27:59] for every aspect of our lives that's why
[1:28:02] we are thankful for the mercy and the
[1:28:04] blood of jesus christ to know that we
[1:28:08] have an advocate with the father jesus
[1:28:11] christ the righteous
[1:28:14] that when we repent of our sins he is
[1:28:17] faithful
[1:28:18] and just to forgive us
[1:28:23] oh glory
[1:28:24] so who who is your leader now let me
[1:28:27] refer to just a few places in the
[1:28:29] scripture if i may hosea chapter 8 verse
[1:28:32] 3 and verse 4. i want you to notice how
[1:28:35] how hosea under inspiration would be
[1:28:38] moved to speak this by god
[1:28:41] now this is the lord speaking
[1:28:43] here in verse 3 it says
[1:28:45] israel hath cast off the thing that is
[1:28:48] good the enemy shall pursue him
[1:28:51] they
[1:28:52] have set up kings
[1:28:54] but not by me
[1:28:59] you're catching this
[1:29:01] they have set up kings
[1:29:03] but not by me
[1:29:06] i've not led them to do this
[1:29:09] this is what they've done
[1:29:13] now remember back to a few weeks ago
[1:29:15] we're reading that
[1:29:17] from the church ages god's desire was to
[1:29:20] raise up a king but it would not be
[1:29:23] that of just an earthly king there it
[1:29:26] was god's desire that he was going to
[1:29:28] come down
[1:29:30] as their king and pay the prize shedding
[1:29:33] of the blood and the and then the
[1:29:35] imparting of his life that was god's
[1:29:37] idea
[1:29:38] but satan
[1:29:40] knowing that
[1:29:41] he put it in the hearts of the people to
[1:29:44] get ahead of the plan of god
[1:29:48] the devil's a slew foot
[1:29:52] samuel i want to be inspired but you
[1:29:54] want to see where is your inspiration
[1:29:56] coming from
[1:29:58] and when you look at where it's coming
[1:30:00] from you can tell that by where is it
[1:30:03] leading you
[1:30:05] because let me tell you something
[1:30:06] friends any inspiration that comes from
[1:30:09] god will not take you away from god
[1:30:13] things can't be dressed up and says well
[1:30:15] the lord told me to do this the lord
[1:30:17] told me to do this if god leads you
[1:30:19] outside of his word then god is standing
[1:30:23] oh god forbid i say this but god would
[1:30:25] be standing as a hypocrite to his own
[1:30:27] word
[1:30:29] but god will never lead us
[1:30:32] against his word because he is the word
[1:30:38] that's why in all of our leadings and
[1:30:40] everything else we we just don't go up
[1:30:42] on a feeling of things we're leading or
[1:30:45] what we would see we want to know lord
[1:30:47] is this you
[1:30:51] i mean everything you know god deals
[1:30:53] with every one of us differently but
[1:30:54] even how god over the years would you
[1:30:56] know one one of the ways he deals with
[1:30:58] me is through dreams and there's times
[1:31:00] where i've seen things in a dream that's
[1:31:02] taken place in homes or you know and
[1:31:05] throughout within the church but you
[1:31:06] know brother samuel what did you do well
[1:31:08] i committed to god because i look at and
[1:31:10] say lord if that's of you and you gave
[1:31:13] me that dream then you will help me to
[1:31:16] see it when it comes to that time
[1:31:18] sometimes it's not being shown as to
[1:31:20] prevent something there's times where
[1:31:23] it's shown that god brings back and says
[1:31:25] see what i told you
[1:31:31] now i'm not saying he does that all the
[1:31:32] time but that just happens to be one of
[1:31:34] the ways that god deals with me
[1:31:36] is that right
[1:31:38] i mean god deals with you in a certain
[1:31:40] way i trust he deals with you in a
[1:31:41] certain way
[1:31:43] i trust it's been you know where it's
[1:31:45] not a strange thing to hear to hear that
[1:31:47] god would speak to me
[1:31:50] i talk about you because we're no
[1:31:52] different we are brothers and sisters in
[1:31:54] the economy of god
[1:31:58] have set up kings but not by me let me
[1:32:00] move on here in deuteronomy 17 14
[1:32:03] notice god is announcing not jumping
[1:32:06] back before they ever come into the land
[1:32:08] god is announcing
[1:32:10] of what will take place he says when
[1:32:12] thou art come into the land which the
[1:32:14] lord thy god giveth thee and shalt
[1:32:16] possess it and shalt dwell therein and
[1:32:18] shalt say
[1:32:19] i
[1:32:21] will set a king over me
[1:32:24] that sounds familiar
[1:32:27] because everything you remember in
[1:32:29] isaiah 14 satan says i will ascend
[1:32:34] it's always got the eye
[1:32:37] the eye you know syria had an eye
[1:32:39] problem
[1:32:41] but god fixed her eye problem
[1:32:44] he sent her some eyes to take away her
[1:32:46] eye
[1:32:48] and in those eyes came forth the breath
[1:32:50] of god
[1:32:52] but notice i will set me up a king over
[1:32:55] me like as all the other nations round
[1:32:57] about me i will set it up remember they
[1:33:00] have made set up kings but not by me
[1:33:03] in first time you're eight four now we
[1:33:05] get down into david and saul now notice
[1:33:08] here are the elders in verse 4 of israel
[1:33:11] they gather themselves together and they
[1:33:12] come to samuel unto rhema and they said
[1:33:14] unto him behold thou art old and thy
[1:33:17] sons walk not in thy ways
[1:33:20] now make us a king to judge us
[1:33:23] like the other nations
[1:33:26] now
[1:33:27] you know they might have some good
[1:33:29] reasoning and some good arguments and
[1:33:30] say hey you're getting old
[1:33:32] and your sons don't even they don't even
[1:33:34] walk they don't even follow the same
[1:33:36] truth that you're proclaiming
[1:33:38] so we need a king
[1:33:41] it might have sounded like good
[1:33:42] reasoning but what already shows when
[1:33:45] they got their eye on the other nations
[1:33:48] they were taking their eyes off of
[1:33:51] jehovah jireh
[1:33:53] samuel didn't provide himself
[1:33:56] god provided samuel
[1:33:59] god provided that leadership god gave
[1:34:02] them direction it was not men providing
[1:34:05] for themselves but god was providing for
[1:34:08] his people and that's the same way that
[1:34:10] god does in this hour god provides for
[1:34:14] us as his children
[1:34:16] we don't have to shift for ourselves we
[1:34:18] don't have to go about things on our own
[1:34:21] ability we can look to almighty god god
[1:34:24] wants us to trust him
[1:34:28] this request to be like the world you
[1:34:30] see it was like we've read in these
[1:34:32] scriptures it was the desire of the
[1:34:34] people it was a worldly desire
[1:34:37] because they were wanting to be like all
[1:34:39] the other nations
[1:34:41] we want a king like them
[1:34:44] well you see they're kings that they had
[1:34:46] it allowed them to live all sorts of
[1:34:48] life
[1:34:50] the kings that they had is why they had
[1:34:52] all sorts of abominations that were
[1:34:54] taking place that's why they worshipped
[1:34:56] other idols that's why there was all
[1:34:58] sorts of things that was taking place
[1:35:00] right
[1:35:01] you see the idols that were worshipped
[1:35:03] before they ever came in to the land of
[1:35:05] canaan remember there were things taking
[1:35:07] place in the land of canaan before
[1:35:09] israel ever got in there that god was
[1:35:12] able to say it's an abomination
[1:35:14] for man to lay with man
[1:35:17] it's an abomination for a woman to put
[1:35:19] on a garment that pertains to a man
[1:35:22] and god let him know the reason that i'm
[1:35:25] kicking out these inhabitants is for
[1:35:27] their abominable ways that's what their
[1:35:30] kings brought to them
[1:35:37] now notice this they were yet now once
[1:35:40] you remember
[1:35:41] when we read here in the scripture
[1:35:43] they let samuel know that samuel we
[1:35:45] don't got no problem with you
[1:35:48] you're a good guy you've never you never
[1:35:50] you know misused things and you've never
[1:35:51] taken advantage
[1:35:53] they couldn't lay a
[1:35:54] finger on that
[1:35:58] but they weren't rejecting samuel
[1:36:01] they were rejecting god
[1:36:06] but they let him know
[1:36:08] you know we still want his blessings
[1:36:14] we still want tongues we still want
[1:36:15] miracles we we still want all these
[1:36:17] blessings
[1:36:19] we we want all of that so don't mistake
[1:36:21] us there are certain things but you see
[1:36:23] god's not an extra value menu
[1:36:28] you need do we go and select what we
[1:36:30] want from him
[1:36:31] i'll take this and take this and take
[1:36:33] this you can deal with this but don't
[1:36:35] you touch that area of my life
[1:36:38] don't you touch that
[1:36:40] lord don't you go there
[1:36:43] hello somebody
[1:36:46] see that is why when they're asking
[1:36:48] samuel you say well if it's their desire
[1:36:51] and they're asking samuel because
[1:36:53] they're wanting the blessing of god's
[1:36:57] representative
[1:36:58] to bless what their desires are but
[1:37:01] samuel could say i can't bless your
[1:37:04] desires because your desires have not
[1:37:07] come from god
[1:37:10] and the word is addressing that worldly
[1:37:13] desire that's in their life but yet that
[1:37:15] worldly desire says i want a king
[1:37:21] they desired a king the bible tells us
[1:37:24] in the book of acts
[1:37:28] i tell you this is why it behooves every
[1:37:30] every person every life listen friends
[1:37:32] our life the desire is that every part
[1:37:35] of our life that god let my life match
[1:37:38] this word
[1:37:40] like brother graham said i don't care he
[1:37:41] said that my suitcoat matches my
[1:37:43] trousers but let my life match this word
[1:37:48] not my imagination but let my life match
[1:37:50] this word and if there's something
[1:37:52] that's out of line then quickly we
[1:37:55] repent of that and say god line me up
[1:37:57] lord
[1:37:58] with your word
[1:38:03] so they they desired
[1:38:05] a king
[1:38:06] this is why when brother branham would
[1:38:08] tell us
[1:38:11] to be careful on the desires of your
[1:38:13] heart
[1:38:17] because god will give you the desires of
[1:38:18] your heart
[1:38:21] balaam had desires
[1:38:24] god let him have his desires
[1:38:26] that's why
[1:38:27] with the word of god
[1:38:29] coming and speaking to our lives we want
[1:38:32] to have that openness to say lord
[1:38:34] evaluate my life
[1:38:37] if there's something that's out of cater
[1:38:39] if there's something that's out of line
[1:38:41] lord then let it be lined up lord god
[1:38:45] let it be lined up put me in desperation
[1:38:48] oh god to be lined up with your word
[1:38:50] because we want him enthroned in our
[1:38:53] lives
[1:38:56] i don't believe anybody i'm just going
[1:38:57] to go out here maybe you think i'm going
[1:38:59] on a limb i don't believe you have taken
[1:39:01] your time to come here this morning to
[1:39:03] be religious
[1:39:05] i don't believe that
[1:39:07] many pressures and and you know it can
[1:39:09] be how you're feeling in your body your
[1:39:11] mind or whatever sometimes it can hurt
[1:39:14] to even set on those pews i don't
[1:39:16] believe we've come here to be religious
[1:39:19] but i believe we've come here to have a
[1:39:21] meeting with almighty god
[1:39:24] [Applause]
[1:39:26] hallelujah we want him to be king
[1:39:29] not what i want what you want lord
[1:39:32] what do you want i want my desires to
[1:39:35] match your will
[1:39:38] hallelujah you see how they wanted all
[1:39:40] of that we still want the blessings we
[1:39:42] want the miracles we still want all this
[1:39:44] you know the scripture
[1:39:47] speaks in isaiah there were seven women
[1:39:49] in this day
[1:39:51] that would take hold
[1:39:53] of a man
[1:39:55] and they would say to that man
[1:39:58] give us your name
[1:40:00] this is what we're going to tell you
[1:40:02] we're the ones controlling what's going
[1:40:04] on
[1:40:05] you give us your name
[1:40:07] to take away our reproach but we're
[1:40:09] still going to wear our own apparel
[1:40:12] that's a scripture
[1:40:13] and eat our own bread
[1:40:15] you know what bread is bread is the
[1:40:17] staff of life
[1:40:20] it's a staff of life we want your name
[1:40:23] but remember his name is who he is
[1:40:27] what good does it do to have just a name
[1:40:29] tact on something if the life isn't
[1:40:31] there to vindicate it
[1:40:34] amen
[1:40:35] it's got his name is a person it's him a
[1:40:39] manifestation of his word
[1:40:43] it's the king of glory moving into our
[1:40:46] life but notice just give us your
[1:40:48] name let us be identified as christians
[1:40:52] or message believers and now you know
[1:40:54] that that'll that'll be so let me tell
[1:40:55] you something just to be identified
[1:40:58] around the message will never ever alone
[1:41:02] deal with sin nature
[1:41:05] we must be born again and that's why the
[1:41:07] message has come to lead us beyond just
[1:41:11] sensation to lead us beyond emotion to
[1:41:15] lead us beyond just the spirit of god
[1:41:18] coming down and we say wow wasn't that
[1:41:20] wonderful wasn't that great the holy
[1:41:22] spirit has come through the message of
[1:41:24] the hour to show us there is a deeper
[1:41:29] walk in jesus christ
[1:41:32] there's a real victory
[1:41:45] i want you to think of this
[1:41:47] here's the lord jesus
[1:41:50] walking here
[1:41:52] upon earth he's been
[1:41:54] walks out of the
[1:41:56] river jordan
[1:41:57] here the spirit of god descending in the
[1:41:59] form of a dove
[1:42:01] he comes down
[1:42:03] and he says this is my
[1:42:05] beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[1:42:09] uh oh here's a change now
[1:42:12] this is a change taking place
[1:42:14] here comes an abiding
[1:42:16] not just the spirit of god resting upon
[1:42:19] and pulling back
[1:42:21] now see it did that in the prophets
[1:42:24] but the prophets
[1:42:25] david the rest they
[1:42:28] were truly of the election
[1:42:32] and they had when david could say take
[1:42:34] not that holy spirit from me it's just
[1:42:36] like with the rest of the prophets they
[1:42:38] didn't they weren't going back and being
[1:42:40] the same people like saul was
[1:42:42] see there was even a difference within
[1:42:44] that
[1:42:45] but how that god had made a way now it
[1:42:49] would come for the abiding and the
[1:42:51] dwelling of himself
[1:42:57] the dove would come to the lamb
[1:43:00] now remember
[1:43:02] jesus life
[1:43:03] he was one of the most misunderstood
[1:43:05] people
[1:43:06] that ever walked upon this earth
[1:43:13] and here he was
[1:43:15] moving around here you know you have
[1:43:17] disciples coming to judas and then you
[1:43:19] have you know others that you know are
[1:43:21] not even named it just has part of the
[1:43:22] multitude of different ones but if
[1:43:24] you'll notice here in the scriptures
[1:43:27] let me read this in john chapter 6
[1:43:30] this is after here one of the times
[1:43:33] where the feeding of a multitude
[1:43:36] it speaks in verse 13 how they had
[1:43:38] gathered up the remaining fragments
[1:43:41] of what was there
[1:43:43] verse 14 it says
[1:43:44] then those men when they had seen the
[1:43:46] miracle that jesus did they said this is
[1:43:49] of a truth that prophet that should come
[1:43:52] into the world
[1:43:54] this is critical here in verse 15.
[1:43:56] when jesus therefore perceived that they
[1:43:59] would come
[1:44:00] and take him by force
[1:44:03] to make him a king he departed again
[1:44:06] into a mountain himself alone
[1:44:10] they were wanting to make him a king
[1:44:13] now we we could sit here and we can
[1:44:15] speak of it and say well he was the king
[1:44:18] he is the lord of glory that's come down
[1:44:21] but he
[1:44:22] himself
[1:44:24] makes the way for himself
[1:44:27] it is him coming into our life that he
[1:44:30] sets himself forward as king it's not me
[1:44:33] it's not you that makes him king it is
[1:44:36] not us taking him by force and this is
[1:44:39] going to happen it's not by force it's
[1:44:41] by surrender
[1:44:45] even though this word this king of glory
[1:44:48] is full of glory full of power
[1:44:51] it'll never work and operate in the
[1:44:53] right way unless we yield to him and his
[1:44:57] program
[1:45:01] because they're going to be just like
[1:45:02] saul anointing comes upon
[1:45:05] and then leaves off
[1:45:08] and listen friends
[1:45:10] i'm not against emotion
[1:45:12] that should be very obvious to you
[1:45:16] but neither
[1:45:17] do we put our stock in emotion
[1:45:22] see this is where we walk in a balance
[1:45:24] you know you get i don't even really
[1:45:25] want to get into that you have people
[1:45:27] that's all against emotion and they've
[1:45:28] got all their quotes and all this this
[1:45:31] listen let him be king
[1:45:33] stop trying to interpret the king's word
[1:45:36] and let the king's word be in power
[1:45:38] [Applause]
[1:45:42] hallelujah
[1:45:43] i mean
[1:45:44] how can you not be emotional when you
[1:45:46] begin to think about what he's done for
[1:45:48] you now you may not run you may not jump
[1:45:52] you might cry
[1:45:55] but there's something about it that it
[1:45:57] moves you because it's something we've
[1:45:59] all been moved in our emotions
[1:46:02] people tell me they're not emotional ah
[1:46:05] i've caught them different times of
[1:46:07] different things
[1:46:09] whether it's their soccer game or
[1:46:10] they're this or that oh i'm not that
[1:46:12] emotional you liar you are emotional
[1:46:15] it's just you're letting your emotions
[1:46:17] loose on the wrong things
[1:46:22] if there's one thing we ought to be
[1:46:24] emotional about it's the lord of glory
[1:46:27] who's in our midst
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:32] hallelujah let him have the uppermost
[1:46:35] seat
[1:46:36] just hearing brother ryan i'm here the
[1:46:38] other day lord i didn't know what i was
[1:46:40] going to do when i heard it because
[1:46:40] that's how i felt
[1:46:42] in revelation the reverend brother is
[1:46:44] preaching the liberal relations series
[1:46:45] part four i believe it's a part part two
[1:46:47] there and brother brahman says you know
[1:46:49] he's talking about being a jesus fiend
[1:46:52] he said you know when you're a jesus
[1:46:53] fiend you just can't get enough of jesus
[1:46:56] you know it's just something about it
[1:46:58] that you he said you start thinking
[1:47:00] about him and you he said somebody said
[1:47:02] they go to preaching about him and and
[1:47:03] the word starts being preached and
[1:47:05] something just stirs up within your life
[1:47:07] you start thinking about it what is it
[1:47:09] you're a jesus fiend
[1:47:12] and you've got to have your daily fix
[1:47:17] hallelujah
[1:47:18] come on friends we can be so addicted to
[1:47:21] so many other things sometimes we can be
[1:47:24] more addicted and dedicated to looking
[1:47:26] over the news and seeing what this
[1:47:28] political guy is doing and this
[1:47:30] political guy's doing let me save you
[1:47:32] the trouble they're lying like they did
[1:47:34] the day before and they'll be lying
[1:47:36] tomorrow but we have a kingdom that has
[1:47:39] come in power and that we should give
[1:47:42] our lives to
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:47] more interested in seeing this headline

[1:47:57] got to we got a reading app when's the
[1:47:58] last time that that has taken place
[1:48:01] when's the last time you've approached
[1:48:03] it in prayer oh i'm just trying to get a
[1:48:05] wake of a morning well what a thing to
[1:48:07] wake up to
[1:48:10] inflation and this and that and
[1:48:12] everything else wow that got to lift
[1:48:13] your spirits
[1:48:15] that ought to be encouragement for the
[1:48:16] day i'm sure when you get to looking at
[1:48:17] that you're wondering saying where's
[1:48:19] that devil at bless god i just read on
[1:48:21] inflation today i don't think so
[1:48:26] you think that we are who have the
[1:48:28] smartphones would be smarter
[1:48:30] than the phones
[1:48:34] come on friends every one of us can get
[1:48:37] into
[1:48:38] a habit
[1:48:39] but thanks be to god for the grace of
[1:48:42] god our king will not leave us that way
[1:48:46] he'll come and speak to us and because
[1:48:48] there's the headship of the word in our
[1:48:51] life we can say yes lord
[1:48:54] yes lord
[1:49:00] jesus could stand there in pilate's hall
[1:49:03] and you know they were talking to him in
[1:49:05] pilate's hall
[1:49:06] and asked him and he was a king he said
[1:49:08] thou says yeah
[1:49:10] he said my kingdom is not of this world
[1:49:12] but what the pharisees and the rest of
[1:49:15] them that wanted to make him king
[1:49:17] they wanted to put him in a position
[1:49:19] they were doing it not by god's desire
[1:49:23] and god's will
[1:49:25] they were doing it
[1:49:27] by their own will
[1:49:29] and let me tell you something just as
[1:49:31] much as the word
[1:49:33] caught what they were trying to do
[1:49:35] and slipped out of their grasp
[1:49:37] that's the same way he'll do
[1:49:39] in your life
[1:49:41] if you try to take the word and place it
[1:49:44] in an area of your life and you're
[1:49:45] trying to put it here and put it there
[1:49:48] jesus won't be manhandled
[1:49:52] jesus your lord i need you to take care
[1:49:54] of this you can't take him by force he
[1:49:57] will depart right out of your midst what
[1:49:59] must i do
[1:50:00] surrender
[1:50:02] i know it's very simple
[1:50:04] but it's surrender let me tell you
[1:50:05] something you know you and i couldn't
[1:50:06] even surrender in the right way unless
[1:50:09] he himself had surrendered in the garden
[1:50:12] he experienced that surrender that you
[1:50:15] and i have to go through
[1:50:17] that's what my king has done for me
[1:50:20] it's not somebody who gave me a list to
[1:50:23] do this and do that but he came down and
[1:50:25] took his own wires his own laws upon
[1:50:28] himself
[1:50:29] [Applause]
[1:50:30] though he were a son
[1:50:32] yet he learned obedience
[1:50:34] by the things that he suffered
[1:50:37] he experienced what it was
[1:50:40] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:50:42] done prayed that way three times knowing
[1:50:45] what surrendering is knowing what dying
[1:50:47] is
[1:50:50] to
[1:50:50] self praise the lord
[1:50:52] that god
[1:50:54] might have his way in our life
[1:51:04] they wanted a messiah you're familiar
[1:51:06] with these terms thinking of this
[1:51:08] world's falling apart again you hear
[1:51:09] these
[1:51:10] these statements
[1:51:12] the pharisees and them
[1:51:14] they want they want to know
[1:51:15] you know it's kind of like this
[1:51:16] political party gets together and
[1:51:19] we're going to stand on the floor we're
[1:51:20] going to act like we're enemies but
[1:51:22] we're going to go out as buddies
[1:51:23] afterwards we're going to act like we're
[1:51:24] different
[1:51:26] come on friends
[1:51:28] we're not kool-aid drinkers here we know
[1:51:34] but jesus
[1:51:36] when he's there among them they're
[1:51:38] testing him
[1:51:40] and to them they're looking at him and
[1:51:41] saying hey you ain't conforming to us
[1:51:44] hey
[1:51:46] hey you're not conformed you can't this
[1:51:49] this can't be
[1:51:51] they couldn't deny one miracle
[1:51:53] they couldn't deny one thing
[1:51:55] jesus going down and led by the spirit
[1:51:58] of god and that man who was raised up on
[1:52:00] the sabbath one of them who was raised
[1:52:03] up on the sabbath and goes down to the
[1:52:05] pool of bethesda you know many of the
[1:52:06] other places in the scripture and they
[1:52:09] wanted to take him
[1:52:11] because you violated the law
[1:52:14] the scripture also says jesus gives a
[1:52:16] parable he says that the son of man
[1:52:17] coming in this generation as the one who
[1:52:20] entered the marketplace and others were
[1:52:22] sitting around piping and he didn't come
[1:52:24] and dance according to how they wanted
[1:52:25] him to dance
[1:52:28] you see because the king does not march
[1:52:31] to the beat
[1:52:32] of the world
[1:52:35] the king of glory comes according to his
[1:52:38] word
[1:52:39] that's why it is not that we and i that
[1:52:43] can take the king and i'm going to set
[1:52:44] him here i'm going to set him there but
[1:52:47] it's got to be a yielding to his life
[1:52:50] and invite him that lord you would
[1:52:53] become king in my life
[1:52:55] now let me read this to you here brother
[1:52:57] graham's talking about out of hebrews
[1:52:59] chapter 10 and maybe this will come
[1:53:01] together a little bit here he says you
[1:53:03] know in hebrews 10 it tells us if the
[1:53:05] worshiper is once purged he has no more
[1:53:08] conscience or desire of sin the whole
[1:53:10] thing is gone from him
[1:53:12] you don't have to sin every day you
[1:53:14] don't have to do these things you do it
[1:53:16] because you willfully want to and the
[1:53:19] reason you willfully want to is because
[1:53:21] you never did die to yourself
[1:53:24] now what's he addressing
[1:53:27] where is the king
[1:53:30] is the king only on the flesh
[1:53:33] is he only in your spirit
[1:53:36] or is he seated in the throne of your
[1:53:37] life
[1:53:39] because once he sees sets on that throne
[1:53:42] that's his seal
[1:53:45] the world has passed away from our life
[1:53:49] is that right
[1:53:51] now he says when you die to yourself he
[1:53:53] said i know that scorching but it's good
[1:53:55] when you die to yourself then you become
[1:53:58] a new creature then those things are
[1:54:02] gone
[1:54:03] and if you try to act like you've got
[1:54:05] them before you have them it's like i
[1:54:07] said the other day like a black bird
[1:54:09] trying to put peacock feathers in his
[1:54:11] wings and you see i'm a peacock but he
[1:54:14] said it isn't that is something that he
[1:54:16] has stuck in his south it has to grow
[1:54:20] from the inside out
[1:54:23] [Music]
[1:54:25] it's not enough just to come and well
[1:54:27] i'll tell you oh my i've been to church
[1:54:30] here on on sunday or been to church on
[1:54:32] thursday and friends if all you're
[1:54:35] leaving is and there can be a refreshing
[1:54:37] there can be a oh my just i tell you the
[1:54:40] the presence of god just feels so
[1:54:42] relaxing it feels so resting but god's
[1:54:44] desire is that that would be that way in
[1:54:47] your soul
[1:54:51] so it's not walking back out into the
[1:54:53] world like saul did saul came under the
[1:54:56] anointing but he went right back out and
[1:54:59] he continued on the same way
[1:55:07] that is the way now watch how brother
[1:55:09] brad words this on the way back
[1:55:11] he said that's the way the holy spirit
[1:55:13] is
[1:55:14] it's not something you smear on
[1:55:17] or something like that
[1:55:19] it's a new birth
[1:55:21] you've got to be born again
[1:55:23] and these virtues of the holy ghost has
[1:55:25] to come from the inside out
[1:55:27] and when the world and sin and cutting
[1:55:30] hair and painting you can line
[1:55:31] everything else up comes out against the
[1:55:33] word of god it shows the holy spirit is
[1:55:38] not there
[1:55:41] it might be on the flesh and on the
[1:55:43] spirit
[1:55:45] but is it there
[1:55:46] meaning where it should be
[1:55:51] now let me say this
[1:55:53] forgiveness is a wonderful thing
[1:55:56] thank god for forgiveness that comes our
[1:55:58] way
[1:55:59] thank god that even
[1:56:01] as holy ghost-filled believers that when
[1:56:04] we
[1:56:05] do
[1:56:06] ask god for forgiveness it might just be
[1:56:09] for a thought passing through whatever
[1:56:11] as it comes our way thank god there is
[1:56:14] forgiveness
[1:56:15] but let me just say this to you
[1:56:17] because sometimes i've had things where
[1:56:20] where where you know and i'm in meetings
[1:56:22] and things like that where you know
[1:56:24] it's coming i just need a refilling and
[1:56:26] it's not a refilling of the holy ghost
[1:56:29] they need a feeling of the holy ghost
[1:56:32] they need an experience of the holy
[1:56:34] ghost because forgiveness itself is an
[1:56:37] experience are you hearing me
[1:56:40] but forgiveness that same way that that
[1:56:43] comes upon your life that you feel like
[1:56:45] wow that's gone from my life that's what
[1:56:48] god wants to do in your soul
[1:56:52] and it drives out all fear
[1:56:55] it drives out all fear of failures
[1:56:57] because you can't fail because god can't
[1:57:00] fail
[1:57:02] you're no longer tied to your family
[1:57:05] tree by the nature
[1:57:07] amen
[1:57:08] so it's not you making him king
[1:57:12] it's where we surrender
[1:57:14] and he takes that rightful position
[1:57:17] we don't want to have a worldly desire
[1:57:19] you realize somebody could take the word
[1:57:21] right here and they can take the word
[1:57:23] but have a worldly desire with it
[1:57:30] that's still continuing on
[1:57:32] in their same life in their same walk
[1:57:35] now listen
[1:57:36] let's go deeper
[1:57:38] because
[1:57:39] it's deeper than just not smoking and
[1:57:41] drinking and running around committing
[1:57:42] adultery and all those are all things
[1:57:44] those are all attributes of unbelief
[1:57:48] but god came not just to deal with
[1:57:50] attributes but to deal with the root
[1:57:53] cause
[1:57:56] you can still be free of all those
[1:57:57] things and still not under the headship
[1:57:59] of the word
[1:58:00] and that's god's working in your life of
[1:58:02] saying yes lord be it unto me but
[1:58:05] remember don't stop until he has become
[1:58:09] enthroned in your life
[1:58:12] don't just go to a certain spot and say
[1:58:14] well i'm pretty good i recognize god
[1:58:16] sent a message i recognize god this is
[1:58:18] the prophet you know i've had an
[1:58:19] experience with god a real experience
[1:58:22] with god does not allow you to settle
[1:58:24] down
[1:58:28] we're getting tougher now
[1:58:31] but when it's not us making him king
[1:58:36] it's him
[1:58:37] that declares
[1:58:39] he is king
[1:58:41] see this is where the scripture would
[1:58:43] say
[1:58:44] that
[1:58:45] he that's joined let me just refer to
[1:58:46] these scriptures here without reading
[1:58:48] them
[1:58:49] exactly first first corinthians 6 and
[1:58:51] verse 13 he that is joined to the lord
[1:58:54] is one spirit
[1:58:56] not two different people
[1:58:58] one spirit
[1:58:59] romans 8 16 said the spirit itself
[1:59:01] beareth witness with our spirit
[1:59:04] that we are the children of god
[1:59:07] so there's a witness with the holy
[1:59:09] spirit in our spirit
[1:59:11] we're the children of god i'm a child of
[1:59:13] god
[1:59:14] this is why when the scripture would say
[1:59:16] first john 5 6 this is he that came by
[1:59:19] water and blood remember i read this to
[1:59:20] you a couple weeks ago even jesus christ
[1:59:23] not by water only
[1:59:26] jesus was not just a good man who was
[1:59:28] born
[1:59:30] all of us came by water
[1:59:32] but there was a distinction here came
[1:59:34] one by water and blood
[1:59:37] a blood that could handle the sin
[1:59:40] question
[1:59:41] a blood that can deal with unbelief
[1:59:45] a blood that can remove every hindrance
[1:59:48] prepare ye the way of the lord
[1:59:52] and here it is the spirit that beareth
[1:59:54] witness
[1:59:55] because the spirit
[1:59:57] is truth
[2:00:01] now let me just try to
[2:00:04] move this into this point where we're
[2:00:05] looking on headshit
[2:00:07] this is where the danger becomes
[2:00:10] of taking man as your leader
[2:00:13] when i'm saying this man is your leader
[2:00:15] i'm not just talking about
[2:00:18] a man i'm talking about
[2:00:21] ideas of man
[2:00:23] i'm talking about our own ideas
[2:00:27] about things
[2:00:29] there's the danger
[2:00:31] of taking man as our leader
[2:00:34] god will operate now let's bring it into
[2:00:37] ephesians 4
[2:00:39] bringing it into other places of
[2:00:40] scripture god operates through man
[2:00:43] but it is not man leading man
[2:00:47] it is god
[2:00:48] leading his people
[2:00:51] through surrendered vessels
[2:00:54] it's god not man it's god
[2:00:58] he leads his people by his word
[2:01:02] i know we quote hebrews 13 8 that says
[2:01:04] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[2:01:06] and forever but the verse above that
[2:01:09] says what
[2:01:10] remember them
[2:01:12] that have the rule over you
[2:01:14] considering the end of their
[2:01:16] conversation
[2:01:19] but how is that rule
[2:01:21] that rule is not man ruling over man
[2:01:24] like you'll do what i say
[2:01:29] the people of god are not moved into
[2:01:31] position by force
[2:01:35] are you hearing me
[2:01:37] that's why the people of god you're not
[2:01:38] moved into position by of something
[2:01:40] being you know a force and hammering on
[2:01:43] this and hammering on that but there's
[2:01:45] how god works because the leader let me
[2:01:47] tell you something the leadership of the
[2:01:49] holy spirit
[2:01:50] is so much greater
[2:01:52] than our thinking about things
[2:01:54] can i give you a little example here i'm
[2:01:56] just listening here this morning and
[2:01:58] brother graham's talking of a sister who
[2:02:01] was getting ready to leave and go back
[2:02:04] home from the meeting she didn't feel
[2:02:06] she she wasn't going to be able to stay
[2:02:08] there any longer and the holy spirit
[2:02:10] said you remain at this meeting because
[2:02:12] you're going to receive a prayer card
[2:02:14] and you're going to be the third one
[2:02:15] that's called
[2:02:17] she shows up to the meeting brother
[2:02:20] billy paul they're giving out cards
[2:02:22] guess which one she gets
[2:02:23] number 97
[2:02:28] she looks at the card and says how in
[2:02:31] the world lord you spoke to me she knew
[2:02:34] that
[2:02:35] lord you spoke to me to stay here and
[2:02:38] not fly home
[2:02:40] and brother and i'm here in that moment
[2:02:42] he's directed by god he says now we're
[2:02:44] going to start and we're going to call
[2:02:46] up 10 and we're going to start with the
[2:02:49] last card 199 98 97.
[2:02:56] you say brother samuel why would god do
[2:02:59] that to break us out of our order
[2:03:04] he lets you and i know he's in control
[2:03:08] [Applause]
[2:03:11] the greatest control there is is when we
[2:03:14] realize i have no control over this but
[2:03:17] there is one who is here that's in
[2:03:20] control
[2:03:23] that's the greatest reality when i'm
[2:03:26] ministering in a meeting in a service
[2:03:28] when he comes down and all been my
[2:03:30] control everything there is gone the
[2:03:33] nerves disappear all those things
[2:03:35] because he steps down and begins to
[2:03:37] speak
[2:03:38] [Applause]
[2:03:41] hallelujah
[2:03:42] oh glory be to god
[2:03:46] so the prophet let me
[2:03:47] let me come down into this here
[2:03:50] the prophet could say
[2:03:52] and ask us the question
[2:03:54] god's chosen place abortion
[2:03:56] where am i going to take you to
[2:03:58] if i'm leading you somewhere where am i
[2:04:00] going to take you all right
[2:04:03] he said am i going to take you to
[2:04:04] branham tabernacle
[2:04:06] he said that's as much as fault as
[2:04:08] anywhere else
[2:04:11] why
[2:04:12] because it won those same spirits were
[2:04:14] there
[2:04:16] listen friends the spirits just so
[2:04:19] maybe this is a a wake-up call
[2:04:22] the spirits don't just remain out there
[2:04:24] in denominations
[2:04:28] the difference is
[2:04:30] we have
[2:04:31] the answer to the devil's question
[2:04:34] jesus christ very simple is the same
[2:04:38] yesterday today and forever
[2:04:42] sometimes problems take us maybe take
[2:04:44] our breath away like
[2:04:46] but remember
[2:04:47] remember remember who your king is
[2:04:51] your king my king has never lost a
[2:04:53] battle
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:55] there's been some of subjects that have
[2:04:58] let down on the word but the word's
[2:05:00] never been defeated
[2:05:03] never been defeated
[2:05:06] where am i going to take you he says
[2:05:09] i think about it he's not taking us to a
[2:05:11] church
[2:05:15] but he's taking us and pointing us
[2:05:17] to jesus christ
[2:05:22] brother brown could make that statement
[2:05:25] not for one moment do i bring a message
[2:05:27] that people might follow me
[2:05:29] or that i might build some organization
[2:05:32] but he said there's one true purpose and
[2:05:34] desire that i have had
[2:05:36] and that's to see a real relationship
[2:05:39] between god
[2:05:40] and his people
[2:05:43] that's the call
[2:05:45] of the hour
[2:05:46] is relationship
[2:05:49] a god who goes with you
[2:05:52] that god who speaks and he deals with
[2:05:54] your heart and your life to go with you
[2:05:56] let me let me try to bring this here
[2:05:58] down
[2:06:00] can i read this
[2:06:02] see brother branham praying god's chosen
[2:06:04] place of worship
[2:06:06] dear dying lamb
[2:06:09] may it never do that he's talking about
[2:06:12] become a denomination
[2:06:14] if i go in this generation may the
[2:06:16] people who believe this message
[2:06:19] never stand still
[2:06:21] for a denomination
[2:06:25] you'll die right in your tracks
[2:06:27] remember that he says the very hour that
[2:06:31] you mention
[2:06:32] denomination among you
[2:06:35] i don't care how sincere you are
[2:06:38] take man for your leader
[2:06:41] instead of the holy spirit to confirm
[2:06:44] this word
[2:06:45] that's the hour you die
[2:06:49] the genuine seed cannot because there's
[2:06:51] nothing left after the seed it's the
[2:06:53] same thing was back at the beginning
[2:06:55] it's the bride that fell into the ground
[2:06:57] to bring forth the corn of wheat again
[2:07:03] i want you to notice these words this
[2:07:05] as i was meditating
[2:07:07] my family and i we were
[2:07:09] on vacation a lot of this work this
[2:07:11] whole thing inspiration i'm just setting
[2:07:14] and we
[2:07:16] we were getting ready to watch a
[2:07:17] production on david and all of this
[2:07:20] some of them my family knows when we
[2:07:22] they started after this production
[2:07:24] started talking i just kind of i said a
[2:07:26] little quiet because
[2:07:28] i didn't dare take my phone out because
[2:07:29] i was wanting to start scriptures and
[2:07:31] quotes and everything as i said there
[2:07:35] but i was amazed at
[2:07:37] even how that the way that they went and
[2:07:39] even
[2:07:40] i think it was benjamin talking about it
[2:07:42] when we were sitting around he says you
[2:07:44] know it just wasn't something it was
[2:07:45] just surface levels because so many
[2:07:47] things today that they it's portrayed
[2:07:48] just as christians just surface level
[2:07:51] but they really went into some depth on
[2:07:53] things
[2:07:54] and one of the things that they had
[2:07:56] showed and i thought it was really
[2:07:57] incredible because this was already upon
[2:07:59] my heart what god was dealing with my
[2:08:01] heart on the lord is my shepherd
[2:08:03] you know you can't control when the
[2:08:04] anointing comes and all those things
[2:08:06] sometimes i just say god help me to
[2:08:08] remember it and i try to use my fingers
[2:08:10] as much as i can
[2:08:12] and getting things down and grabbing
[2:08:14] this quote and this scripture and god
[2:08:15] just keeps on compounding it throughout
[2:08:17] whether i'm sitting in my office or out
[2:08:19] so that flow was going on and i i said
[2:08:21] god
[2:08:22] maybe if you have have this for us then
[2:08:25] then then you you'll be the one to
[2:08:27] direct me and guide me
[2:08:29] and i'm i'm thinking of this quote this
[2:08:31] whole is something i was even meditating
[2:08:33] on where brother brown made that
[2:08:34] statement he says
[2:08:36] may the people who believe this message
[2:08:39] never stand still for a denomination now
[2:08:42] i want you to notice what he's mentioned
[2:08:44] stand still
[2:08:46] denomination and taking man as your
[2:08:48] leader
[2:08:51] all those three things are synonymous
[2:08:53] with one another
[2:08:55] because to dominate what is it to
[2:08:57] denominate
[2:08:58] this is what we believe and that's it
[2:09:02] not going on any further
[2:09:05] but we know the bible said when the
[2:09:07] spirit of truth has come he will
[2:09:09] lead and guide us into all truth
[2:09:13] it's a walk it's a journey it's a
[2:09:16] relationship
[2:09:18] it's a continual unfolding in our lives
[2:09:23] it's not just standing still
[2:09:26] as though that we've made it
[2:09:30] you can be backslid without even
[2:09:32] realizing your backslid
[2:09:35] backslid is to get cold on god
[2:09:38] and if the prophet himself could stand
[2:09:41] there and say even how paul could say i
[2:09:44] die daily
[2:09:47] it wasn't compromise but it's showing
[2:09:49] that where our lives are at and
[2:09:50] especially with the hour that we're
[2:09:52] living in it ought to be something in
[2:09:54] our lives that we're taking inventory
[2:09:57] and not out of fear but our desire is
[2:10:00] that the king of glory would have his
[2:10:02] way
[2:10:03] in our lives
[2:10:08] let me say this
[2:10:13] it can be very dangerous
[2:10:15] to take somebody else's idea
[2:10:19] the word of god
[2:10:21] we recognize
[2:10:23] that the word of god
[2:10:25] is our absolute
[2:10:28] the message that god has sent to us is
[2:10:30] an absolute
[2:10:32] and when that same life has come inside
[2:10:35] of us that's an absolute
[2:10:38] and what does it do it ties us to the
[2:10:41] word of god
[2:10:43] that no matter what comes here or there
[2:10:45] we're anchored not by our own strength
[2:10:49] we have not made the word by our own
[2:10:51] strength but we are yoked with the word
[2:10:56] by the holy spirit
[2:11:00] and we're taking him
[2:11:01] as our leader
[2:11:03] abraham said when you take man as your
[2:11:05] leader to confirm the word instead of
[2:11:08] the holy spirit that's the very moment
[2:11:10] you die
[2:11:14] can't be man's ideas
[2:11:16] it's got to be the holy spirit he
[2:11:20] confirms the word
[2:11:22] he confirms his own working
[2:11:26] in our lives
[2:11:28] this is why
[2:11:29] that with man's ideas there can be there
[2:11:32] could be many patterns
[2:11:34] that can be
[2:11:35] sent out before you
[2:11:37] well my dad did this or my mama did this
[2:11:39] sir brother and sister so and so do this
[2:11:42] don't get your eyes on brother and
[2:11:43] sister so-and-so
[2:11:45] because brother and sister so and so
[2:11:47] their hearts might be already on the
[2:11:48] turn away
[2:11:51] are you hearing me well i know so and so
[2:11:54] did this and and this seems to be okay
[2:11:56] you don't make other people your example
[2:12:00] and if you're wanting to wrestle with
[2:12:02] that and hold on to that you need to
[2:12:04] come back and look in your life and say
[2:12:06] wait a minute god you're dealing with my
[2:12:08] life where are my desires at
[2:12:12] are you with me we don't want to make
[2:12:14] excuses we want to invite the king of
[2:12:16] glory
[2:12:20] we want to make a calling and election
[2:12:22] sure is this all right
[2:12:26] we want to take our cues
[2:12:28] and our leadership
[2:12:30] from the holy spirit
[2:12:34] you catch what i said
[2:12:35] we want to take our cues and our
[2:12:37] leadership from the holy spirit
[2:12:40] not from culture
[2:12:41] not from somebody else
[2:12:43] we want to take it from the holy spirit
[2:12:46] we want to be in contact with him as he
[2:12:49] comes through the word
[2:12:52] let me just say it like this
[2:12:54] you see
[2:12:55] brother brown was not taking us to a
[2:12:57] church he was not leading us to a
[2:13:00] movement this message is not a movement
[2:13:06] man has tried to make it a movement
[2:13:10] man has wanted to set up camps around it
[2:13:14] are you hearing me now the reason every
[2:13:16] denomination has ever come about and
[2:13:19] brother bram says clearly like this and
[2:13:21] we can say amen to it it's because of
[2:13:24] the lack of the revelation of jesus
[2:13:26] christ
[2:13:32] this message is not a movement
[2:13:36] this message does not put limitations
[2:13:39] and say
[2:13:40] oh
[2:13:41] this is too deep of a situation
[2:13:44] this is a bad thing but the message
[2:13:48] is jesus christ the son of man revealed
[2:13:51] right here among us it's not books it's
[2:13:54] not tapes it's the veil taken off the
[2:13:57] seals taken off of jesus christ
[2:14:03] where the church has saw him and the
[2:14:06] church looked upon him
[2:14:08] and they wanted to take him by force
[2:14:15] but he slipped out of their grasp
[2:14:20] he won't be taken that way
[2:14:23] he will not come and yield and put a
[2:14:26] crown upon worldlyism upon worldly
[2:14:30] desire upon theology he will never set
[2:14:33] down upon that
[2:14:37] as long as saul is still alive you can't
[2:14:40] put the crown on his head
[2:14:44] are you hearing me
[2:14:46] as long as saul is still alive you can't
[2:14:48] put the crown on his head
[2:14:50] but when saul has passed away the
[2:14:52] unction of the holy spirit began to move
[2:14:54] him to hebron
[2:14:56] he brought a place of the fathers begins
[2:14:58] to move him to that place and they moved
[2:15:00] to crown david king first
[2:15:04] in hebron
[2:15:05] what took place in hebron
[2:15:08] elohim came down to visit abraham
[2:15:11] on the plains of memory
[2:15:13] it's the place of the fathers
[2:15:20] but you see not to a church
[2:15:23] not to an idea
[2:15:27] but it's to the lord himself
[2:15:31] this is why
[2:15:34] all of this gospel when it's preached
[2:15:37] in its purity
[2:15:38] it's redemptive power
[2:15:42] it will only take an effect on you
[2:15:45] if you believe it
[2:15:47] and receive it
[2:15:50] that's the only way it can work is if
[2:15:51] you believe it
[2:15:53] and you receive it
[2:15:55] let the king of glory ride in
[2:15:58] in
[2:16:02] power my it's just
[2:16:05] hard to find a place where to even to
[2:16:07] stop
[2:16:09] but the holy spirit is sent to be the
[2:16:10] leader of our lives
[2:16:15] see we don't want to take a portion of
[2:16:18] the word and we're taking this and
[2:16:21] the lord's the king god's the king he's
[2:16:23] the king of my life and our life is
[2:16:25] still deadly dangling with the world
[2:16:28] still up and down and in and out
[2:16:34] still everything else you see when it
[2:16:35] comes out of our life
[2:16:37] david was recognized
[2:16:39] as king
[2:16:41] by saul god had anointed him
[2:16:44] because of the character he displayed
[2:16:49] the holy spirit makes us more than just
[2:16:51] good moral people
[2:16:55] when the king himself has come down
[2:16:57] our lives are set on fire
[2:17:01] there's things where decisions and
[2:17:03] he becomes the very absolute
[2:17:06] of every part
[2:17:08] of our life
[2:17:11] it's not us
[2:17:13] that makes ourselves christians
[2:17:16] it's him
[2:17:19] david would also write
[2:17:21] the lord as my shepherd he would say
[2:17:24] we are the sheep of his pasture
[2:17:26] it is not us that have made ourselves he
[2:17:28] hath made us
[2:17:30] it's a working of the holy spirit that
[2:17:33] moves into our life it's christ forming
[2:17:35] himself in our life
[2:17:37] stay with me here i'm closing
[2:17:42] when you hear the holy spirit as it
[2:17:43] comes and these things that he has
[2:17:46] spoken
[2:17:47] to us even here this morning to bring a
[2:17:49] real examination in our lives
[2:17:52] i would implore you i would encourage
[2:17:54] you
[2:17:57] don't sit there in defeat
[2:18:00] oh brother samuel i haven't went deep
[2:18:02] enough
[2:18:03] this is the king
[2:18:05] calling to you
[2:18:06] to go deeper
[2:18:10] to where you you get tired of just
[2:18:12] having an experience of forgiveness
[2:18:15] over and over and over
[2:18:19] as brother branham describes it in the
[2:18:21] rejected king he said people have taken
[2:18:23] in the manner well i repent of it when i
[2:18:25] you know do wrong and i'm i'm i'm okay
[2:18:26] until i do it again but rem said
[2:18:28] something's wrong
[2:18:30] something's wrong
[2:18:31] it's not just you see this is this is
[2:18:33] what the working of the holy spirit
[2:18:34] comes to do
[2:18:36] is to bring about a real change in our
[2:18:38] life
[2:18:39] do we need forgiveness we do need
[2:18:41] forgiveness
[2:18:42] but you are made to live and walk in
[2:18:45] victory
[2:18:47] you were made to be an example
[2:18:50] a display
[2:18:52] everywhere you go
[2:18:54] in your homes
[2:18:56] and everywhere
[2:18:58] then i'm a christian
[2:19:00] i say here this morning
[2:19:03] don't try to take him by force
[2:19:06] but let him take a hold of you
[2:19:10] let him go deeper
[2:19:12] let the holy spirit go deeper in your
[2:19:14] life
[2:19:15] if there's things that
[2:19:17] you've got off a little
[2:19:19] you've gone off a little target there's
[2:19:21] certain things that's pulled your way
[2:19:22] that you know
[2:19:24] the holy spirit dealing with your life
[2:19:26] that you know what i've made some
[2:19:27] decisions that i didn't run by the king
[2:19:31] i didn't run these decisions by the king
[2:19:33] maybe the king has been trying to tell
[2:19:35] you and you wonder why does brother
[2:19:37] samuel keep ministering on this and why
[2:19:39] does this minister keep this and why do
[2:19:41] i hear that it's not brother samuel
[2:19:44] i don't go around and look and look for
[2:19:46] things
[2:19:47] you understand that
[2:19:49] i don't go around and look and say let
[2:19:50] me see who i can hit now
[2:19:52] we're here to minister the word
[2:19:55] we're here to be a blessing we're here
[2:19:56] to help
[2:19:58] but if there's something that what
[2:20:00] you've been as you're hearing the holy
[2:20:02] spirit deal with don't discount it don't
[2:20:04] put it off recognize that's the love of
[2:20:07] almighty god
[2:20:09] and his brother
[2:20:10] uh uh
[2:20:12] jack could minister and take that
[2:20:13] thought their rock is not like our rock
[2:20:16] let me tell you their king is not like
[2:20:19] our king
[2:20:23] their king don't care for them
[2:20:25] their king doesn't care if they're
[2:20:27] religious if they take this up and and
[2:20:30] they have you know an imagination of
[2:20:32] jesus and and they have pictures of
[2:20:34] jesus their king he doesn't care how
[2:20:37] many pictures of the prophet we have he
[2:20:39] doesn't care how many message books we
[2:20:41] have doesn't care how many quotes we
[2:20:43] know
[2:20:44] that king doesn't care
[2:20:48] but our king cares
[2:20:51] our king says
[2:20:53] what that messenger was set for
[2:20:56] was with the message for you
[2:20:59] he came all the way god came all the way
[2:21:02] from glory with you and me in mind
[2:21:05] god sent this message with you and me in
[2:21:07] mind
[2:21:09] and this message never came to turn
[2:21:12] our heads
[2:21:15] he came to turn
[2:21:17] our hearts
[2:21:20] that the king
[2:21:21] would take
[2:21:22] his
[2:21:24] rightful
[2:21:25] position in our life
[2:21:28] i'm i'm just i
[2:21:29] i just thank god for his mercy in this
[2:21:31] hour that i think that in a service in a
[2:21:34] time like this that
[2:21:35] wow what a moment that god
[2:21:37] is here to break back veils
[2:21:40] veils where satan would want to put up
[2:21:42] and
[2:21:44] saint would love to drive you away from
[2:21:45] here
[2:21:47] you do anything he can to get you away
[2:21:50] from the presence of god from the word
[2:21:52] of god that can help you
[2:21:54] and he would like to bring condemnation
[2:21:56] on your life things that he has led you
[2:21:59] to do
[2:22:01] and you've done them
[2:22:03] and then he'll turn around and say
[2:22:04] there's no hope for you
[2:22:07] and he's the one who's been the one
[2:22:09] inspiring and leading
[2:22:11] but there is one here this morning
[2:22:14] with grace
[2:22:16] he's here to inspire you even in your
[2:22:19] mind and in your heart right now
[2:22:22] to think back
[2:22:24] go back to what you was
[2:22:27] go back return back to what god's desire
[2:22:29] is for a real man for a real woman
[2:22:33] he wants to be the king in our life but
[2:22:36] not what we make him to be because we
[2:22:38] can make things and then we go out we're
[2:22:41] the same people
[2:22:43] do the same things
[2:22:45] and i say that this morning by the grace
[2:22:47] of god
[2:22:48] because there's a there's a king here
[2:22:50] not a king
[2:22:52] but the king amen amen
[2:22:55] that is here to bring change this
[2:22:57] morning
[2:22:58] amen
[2:23:00] he's here to bring a deeper experience
[2:23:02] and a deeper walk he's here to bring
[2:23:04] renewing in hearts that could sit here
[2:23:07] and say samuel i know i've had an
[2:23:09] experience would have passed from death
[2:23:11] unto life but maybe your focus has
[2:23:13] gotten a little bit off on things
[2:23:16] we have normal
[2:23:17] tasks of life don't we we have task of
[2:23:19] life things you have to do don't feel
[2:23:20] condemned about that
[2:23:22] but sometimes we can get we can get off
[2:23:24] track
[2:23:26] and our focus off in the wrong things
[2:23:28] and looking at this and looking at other
[2:23:30] things and god is standing there the
[2:23:32] whole time and saying i'm your provider
[2:23:36] i'm your keeper i'm your sustainer
[2:23:39] you don't have to go to anybody else's
[2:23:41] shoulder i'm here
[2:23:43] i'll pull you up to my bosom
[2:23:48] hallelujah he wants to be
[2:23:51] your king
[2:23:55] he wants to have the headship
[2:23:58] the preeminence
[2:24:00] of every decision in your life
[2:24:02] let me tell you how great our king is
[2:24:04] i love how brother brown will say this
[2:24:06] over and over and forgive me for
[2:24:07] continuing to take time but as it's
[2:24:09] coming
[2:24:10] he said what makes him so great to me
[2:24:12] is how he's willing
[2:24:14] to make himself so simple
[2:24:18] it's satan that wants to complicate
[2:24:20] things
[2:24:21] it's satan that wants to try to tinker
[2:24:23] with the simplicity that is in christ
[2:24:26] and make it far out it's not something
[2:24:28] that's hard or complex
[2:24:32] it's surrender
[2:24:34] it's yielding to you
[2:24:38] you might have to wrestle it out but
[2:24:40] there is god
[2:24:42] our king is there inspiring us to
[2:24:46] wrestle it out our king is there
[2:24:48] inspiring us in that portion of the word
[2:24:51] just as he did when he was there in the
[2:24:53] garden of gethsemane our king
[2:24:56] is here to inspire us
[2:24:59] to move into his word
[2:25:02] i think every one of us and you could
[2:25:04] say the lord
[2:25:07] i want your will yes
[2:25:10] i want to evaluate decisions that's been
[2:25:12] in my life
[2:25:15] maybe you can look in your life and see
[2:25:16] at one point you've been pretty fervent
[2:25:18] but what's happened
[2:25:20] what's happened you used to be really
[2:25:22] resilient about being in the house of
[2:25:24] god
[2:25:25] used to be really resilient about those
[2:25:27] things well you say brother samuel it
[2:25:29] doesn't make a difference if we come to
[2:25:30] the house of god or not it does if you
[2:25:32] can help it
[2:25:33] i know some of you are placed in
[2:25:35] different localities some of you you
[2:25:36] know the way things happen at different
[2:25:38] times but remember
[2:25:40] remember within all of this
[2:25:42] it's important when we come together
[2:25:48] getting a little quiet on this one now
[2:25:51] is he king or not
[2:25:53] the bible said forsake not to assemble
[2:25:55] ourselves together
[2:25:57] then you understand that's not brother
[2:25:59] samuel brother samuel's trying to get
[2:26:01] people here to preach to i'm not trying
[2:26:03] to get people here to preach to i'm
[2:26:06] trying to tell you
[2:26:08] that if that right there is something
[2:26:10] that
[2:26:10] you start making excuses for
[2:26:13] there's some things you need to really
[2:26:15] examine in your life
[2:26:18] and that's not to put you down you
[2:26:20] understand what i'm saying
[2:26:22] friends i love you i couldn't stand here
[2:26:23] and minister this
[2:26:25] but it's important that we look at it
[2:26:27] because if not then we take the message
[2:26:29] and say well i'm all right
[2:26:31] i'm okay
[2:26:36] we don't want to stand still
[2:26:39] we want him to be king in every decision
[2:26:41] that we make
[2:26:45] not patterning off of one another but
[2:26:47] following his leadership
[2:26:50] i thank god for there is other examples
[2:26:54] but for me and my house
[2:26:56] i'm praying and i'm asking god for
[2:26:58] leadership
[2:26:59] because every one of these
[2:27:01] young men that i have right here
[2:27:03] they're all three different
[2:27:08] remember when god
[2:27:10] the angel of the lord came to samson's
[2:27:11] mother
[2:27:13] he revealed the purpose
[2:27:15] for that child's life
[2:27:18] and the mother was praise god praise god
[2:27:20] which a mother would be glory to god
[2:27:22] there's a there's a child cutting the
[2:27:23] mother would be that way but the father
[2:27:26] taking his responsibility said ask that
[2:27:29] and ask that man to come again
[2:27:32] and the father asks of that man
[2:27:35] seeing that the child shall be this way
[2:27:38] how shall we order it
[2:27:41] see because the father is entrusted with
[2:27:43] leadership
[2:27:44] of that home
[2:27:46] the mother's excited she should be
[2:27:48] there's a baby coming praise god i'm
[2:27:51] expecting and the father said ask him to
[2:27:53] come again
[2:27:54] because god knows the secret that's
[2:27:56] bound up in that child's life and i want
[2:27:59] to be under the leadership so i guide in
[2:28:01] the right direction
[2:28:04] it's looking for the king of glory
[2:28:09] so we don't want to hang our heads i
[2:28:11] don't want to encourage you let's move
[2:28:15] on let's move
[2:28:16] don't don't don't don't don't continue
[2:28:18] in the same pathway if you've gone off
[2:28:21] track it's time to get back in step
[2:28:23] it's time to ask god to renew the vision
[2:28:25] in your life
[2:28:27] say lord
[2:28:28] let that word that word to be the
[2:28:29] headship and that shows
[2:28:31] whether that word is in its place or not
[2:28:35] let's pray
[2:28:38] heavenly father
[2:28:42] lord jesus
[2:28:45] lord with the direction
[2:28:48] this inspiration lord that you have
[2:28:51] lord
[2:28:52] given to speak with lord
[2:28:55] questions that
[2:28:57] cause
[2:28:58] us to reflect
[2:29:00] that we might give an answer
[2:29:02] amen not an answer as it were to you
[2:29:06] but an answer as though that lord we
[2:29:08] might be able to reflect
[2:29:10] upon our own lives
[2:29:12] of where are we

[2:30:16] purpose there's a plan there's an
[2:30:18] objective
[2:30:20] right here in this this service this
[2:30:22] morning is that lord there would be
[2:30:24] hearts and lives that would accept the
[2:30:27] grace and mercy of god and say lord i
[2:30:30] need a deeper experience
[2:30:33] and lord that wouldn't invite you or god
[2:30:35] to go deeper
[2:30:37] lord
[2:30:38] even for every every one of our lives
[2:30:41] lord
[2:30:42] we want lord a
[2:30:43] lord a deeper experience with you lord
[2:30:47] jesus
[2:30:48] we want to know you more lord
[2:30:51] father every every part in every area of
[2:30:53] our life
[2:30:55] oh god we we want you to have the
[2:30:57] preeminence it's not just something lord
[2:30:59] that we would say
[2:31:01] but god that would reflect itself in
[2:31:04] every decision
[2:31:07] that we make lord
[2:31:09] help us lord i pray god
[2:31:12] i don't trust my flesh
[2:31:14] lord i have no confidence in this flesh
[2:31:16] lord
[2:31:18] but my confidence is in you
[2:31:20] my confidence is the working of the word
[2:31:23] of the holy spirit in my life those
[2:31:25] sacred sands that's
[2:31:27] that's where i have confidence lord
[2:31:30] and we look to you lord
[2:31:33] father i pray this morning if there is
[2:31:35] one that's here
[2:31:37] the lord there they've realized
[2:31:40] it's just lord where they've tried to
[2:31:43] take and make you king
[2:31:46] by their own will
[2:31:49] by their own force
[2:31:51] instead of surrendering their will
[2:31:54] may they lord jesus lay down their life
[2:31:57] right now
[2:31:58] lay down their will may they lay
[2:32:01] everything down lord at your feet this
[2:32:03] morning
[2:32:04] like those lord that took off their
[2:32:06] garments and laid them up on the ground
[2:32:10] with the palm leaves and you came riding
[2:32:12] in
[2:32:13] lord it speaks of us willingly laying
[2:32:16] down our own lives
[2:32:18] that god that you might ride in
[2:32:21] in power and glory
[2:32:25] lord god you're the one
[2:32:27] who does the impossible
[2:32:30] things that are thought to be impossible
[2:32:33] lord you specialize in it
[2:32:36] just as lord i brother constance
[2:32:38] constantine lord i think oh god
[2:32:42] it's very fitting for that testimony to
[2:32:45] be given right here this morning
[2:32:48] of two things lord
[2:32:50] where they were standing here lord for
[2:32:52] prayer i believe it was sometime last
[2:32:55] fall december
[2:32:56] somewhere around that time lord
[2:32:59] but that deformity that they said was in
[2:33:01] that arm
[2:33:04] but lord when they went back
[2:33:08] sometime later
[2:33:10] there was no deformity there
[2:33:14] you moved on the scene lord
[2:33:18] and you made that which showed up as a
[2:33:20] deformity
[2:33:22] you moved on the scene lord
[2:33:25] to straighten it out
[2:33:28] then to see right here this morning lord
[2:33:30] is
[2:33:31] a condition with the blood but god to
[2:33:34] see how
[2:33:36] the lord that you have healed that
[2:33:38] little girl
[2:33:40] that little baby of that blood condition
[2:33:43] lord
[2:33:44] there's a real blood condition
[2:33:48] there's a blood that's greater
[2:33:51] than that blood that came lord by the
[2:33:54] first birth
[2:33:55] that lord jesus that god the blood that
[2:33:58] was shed and inside of that blood
[2:34:01] that blood cell
[2:34:02] there is a life
[2:34:04] the life that lord after the price has
[2:34:07] been paid can come back upon the
[2:34:09] worshiper lord and bring us under that
[2:34:11] blood to where
[2:34:13] we lose all our guilty stings
[2:34:16] where everything lord every worldly
[2:34:19] desire all the things of the world lord
[2:34:21] have fled away
[2:34:24] and it's you lord
[2:34:26] it's you
[2:34:27] the king
[2:34:29] in our lives
[2:34:31] lord
[2:34:33] every one of us are at different
[2:34:35] stages i realize that
[2:34:37] i realize lord here this morning there's
[2:34:39] lives that have not surrendered to you
[2:34:42] and lord that would be you calling to
[2:34:44] them

[2:34:46] but you calling them to a deeper
[2:34:48] experience
[2:34:49] lives that's had a real genuine
[2:34:51] experience with you and you're calling
[2:34:53] them to a another a deeper experience

[2:35:02] to recognize that lord all that you
[2:35:05] ask of us
[2:35:07] is that we would yield and surrender our
[2:35:09] lives to you
[2:35:11] let this word
[2:35:13] let it have an effect in our life
[2:35:16] granted lord i know there's hearts and

[2:35:37] and your desire
[2:35:39] is to bring a real change in their life

[2:37:38] let's let's take a hold let's take a
[2:37:40] hold up on almighty god this morning
[2:37:43] just as we worship
[2:37:45] enter into worship now
[2:37:48] you say brother samuel it's
[2:37:50] i don't even know what time brother
[2:37:51] samuel it's 1 30.
[2:37:53] it's past 1 30. and i know sometimes
[2:37:55] friends listen i know sometimes you have
[2:37:57] to go there's things that comes up you
[2:37:59] have certain things that press and you
[2:38:00] have to leave sometimes for a job you
[2:38:02] know that you know what i'm saying
[2:38:05] but if all we're doing is getting in a
[2:38:07] hurry to go out and eat at a restaurant
[2:38:10] and we're looking at time as though come
[2:38:13] on come on we've been here two and a
[2:38:15] half hours
[2:38:17] why don't we think that way about the
[2:38:19] things of the world
[2:38:23] why don't we respond that same way
[2:38:25] because those things don't have life
[2:38:28] how come we don't say come on two and a
[2:38:30] half hours here we've been fishing come
[2:38:32] on no anyone say that
[2:38:34] i'm not picking on fishing either
[2:38:35] because i've been fishing
[2:38:39] two and a half hours we've been playing
[2:38:40] this volleyball game no we don't say
[2:38:41] that we're not saying hey come on come
[2:38:43] on brother richard let's go let's go
[2:38:44] let's get another game going here come
[2:38:46] on i got no
[2:38:49] you see how subtle things can creep in
[2:38:53] and it's like we we get into such a
[2:38:55] place to where everything's just like a
[2:38:57] rush
[2:39:04] but he wants to be king
[2:39:07] he wants to be king
[2:39:11] hallelujah
[2:39:13] i didn't say that to condemn me i said
[2:39:15] just evaluate it you know you know where
[2:39:17] you're at there have been times in my
[2:39:18] family or i've we've had to leave but
[2:39:20] you understand what i'm saying
[2:39:22] i think we need if we're able to be here
[2:39:24] and to worship the things i
[2:39:26] say god i don't want to put you on a
[2:39:27] time schedule
[2:39:28] [Music]
[2:39:30] hallelujah
[2:39:33] probably everybody right now is afraid
[2:39:34] oh if i get up and leave
[2:39:35] no
[2:39:37] i trust we're more we're more mature
[2:39:40] than that
[2:39:41] but you understand that that's for us i
[2:39:42] can't examine god knows every one of our
[2:39:44] hearts
[2:39:46] right
[2:39:47] but i think it's so fitting to worship
[2:39:48] him
[2:39:51] i think about it
[2:39:53] that the world has put him out
[2:39:56] they wanted to grasp him and that he
[2:39:58] would anoint
[2:40:00] their denominational system
[2:40:03] but they couldn't lay hold on him
[2:40:06] they couldn't lay hold on the word
[2:40:08] but here he come
[2:40:13] and knocks on our heart
[2:40:15] and said hey
[2:40:18] if you open the door
[2:40:20] i'll come in
[2:40:22] amen
[2:40:25] where the world could not lay hold on
[2:40:27] him
[2:40:29] but a heart that's willing to open
[2:40:34] it can as solomon would speak
[2:40:38] of the bride where the bride
[2:40:40] would hold the king
[2:40:41] in the galleries
[2:40:44] the king
[2:40:45] would be held
[2:40:47] by her beauty
[2:40:49] her character
[2:40:50] her life
[2:40:52] [Music]
[2:40:54] well lady osea says i don't want him
[2:40:56] i don't want him ruling over my life
[2:40:58] i don't want him telling me what i can
[2:40:59] do in this i'm going to tell him what i
[2:41:02] want out of him
[2:41:04] but there's a bride that says lord yes
[2:41:08] be my king lord
[2:41:10] lead me lord
[2:41:12] direct me lord
[2:41:14] and he passes by our way and he'll speak
[2:41:16] to our hearts forgive me the lord
[2:41:19] forgive me lord and you know what it's
[2:41:20] doing it's laying hold but not out of
[2:41:23] force
[2:41:24] it's love that's constraining him
[2:41:26] [Music]
[2:41:28] it's surrender that's drawing him in
[2:41:30] that's
[2:41:31] a man
[2:41:33] after god's own heart
[2:41:36] holy beautiful
[2:41:40] hallelujah you love him this morning
[2:41:43] any wonderful
[2:41:45] glory be to god

[2:41:50] little bit just invite him in has he
[2:41:51] spoke to your heart personally you
[2:41:53] invite him in i i can't invite him in
[2:41:55] for you i can't invite whatever that
[2:41:57] need is in your life but he's here to
[2:41:59] minister to your life
