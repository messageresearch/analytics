[32:11] a lot of the life itself holds a lot of
[32:14] uncertainties and uh a lot of things
[32:16] that we have not expected and don't
[32:19] expect but what's what's important is
[32:22] that you know where you stand in him
[32:26] that's that's that's what's
[32:28] key and so we are just grateful to God
[32:32] for his Mercy in this hour that he would
[32:34] he would make known the path of life for
[32:37] us he would make himself known in this
[32:40] hour that he's still the same yesterday

[32:45] refuge amen he's all that we have need
[32:49] of in this life amen we just want to go
[32:53] to the Lord in prayer uh as we PR
[32:57] prepare to turn to the word tonight and
[32:59] um I just want to I know it's already
[33:02] been mentioned here on the when the
[33:04] requests were taken up regarding to
[33:06] continue to keep uh brother Carmelo in
[33:09] prayer I was there uh I was there this
[33:13] afternoon just right before they did the
[33:15] dialysis and was able to just to pray
[33:18] with him and to talk with uh with him
[33:21] and sister Carmen and so we want to
[33:23] continue to keep brother Carmelo in
[33:26] prayer
[33:27] um the Lord would just continue to
[33:30] minister to him he was in a lot of lot
[33:33] of pain I know others have been there
[33:35] and I want to say that uh that's that's
[33:37] wonderful when I as I heard that too and
[33:40] uh he has been in a lot of pain so you
[33:44] know we don't know we don't know is is
[33:47] it the time for for brother Carmelo only
[33:50] god holds that but the thing that we do
[33:53] know is this right here is that we look
[33:55] at you know
[33:57] where the heart the soul the life of the
[34:00] individual and you know just like as I
[34:03] told the family before I said you know
[34:04] we've stood and we've I for over the
[34:07] times in the years when I've went there
[34:09] to visit brother Carmelo and just to
[34:11] times just to speak with him and bring
[34:13] it around to a place to where
[34:15] that where as an individual just to have
[34:19] that peace with God and uh that's where
[34:22] that as in our lives we can we can ask
[34:25] for no more it's the word that we we we
[34:27] present by a witness in our heart in our
[34:30] life you know it's that's all that God
[34:33] asked of us to do and then if faith will
[34:35] take a hold and to believe and to take a
[34:39] hold of that well that's where we we
[34:41] rest in that word so we just ask that
[34:44] You' just continue to keep him in prayer
[34:47] and um that the Lord would just be
[34:49] merciful to our
[34:51] brother and uh also tonight I going to
[34:54] minister here with a prayer cloth on
[34:57] uh for for brother Brian Jr he has a a
[35:00] fever here that's uh come up again and
[35:03] you know he's been battling for it's
[35:05] been on and off for uh a few months and
[35:09] different things you know not knowing
[35:10] what you know is it sickness is it flu
[35:12] or is it what and so tomorrow morning
[35:15] they're going to do a CT scan and uh but
[35:18] I just you know when I received that
[35:20] there this morning and I just we're
[35:22] we're not going to accept
[35:24] anything you know we're we're going to
[35:27] stand on the promise of God you know and
[35:29] if nothing wrong with the CT scan uh
[35:32] that's not any weakness of Faith
[35:34] remember when uh Israel was to go into
[35:36] the land God could have just sent them
[35:38] on into the land but instead God said go
[35:41] ahead and get a CT scan go ahead and get
[35:44] the MRI and let's see let's see where we
[35:47] need to direct the prayers to so that's
[35:50] how when we when we go to get tests you
[35:52] know we we understand that when things
[35:54] come about you know we we're praying and
[35:57] we're looking to the Lord God is more
[36:00] than enough amen so we just want to hold
[36:03] our brother up in prayer and I ask you
[36:05] to join with me as we go to the Lord in
[36:08] prayer before as we get ready to turn to
[36:10] the word

[36:30] other requests that you have on your
[36:32] heart we've already made those known but
[36:34] we want to take everything before God in
[36:36] prayer and just ask the Lord to just
[36:38] move for these needs in a special way he
[36:40] knows how to do it you know he he only
[36:43] We Stand upon his word and we we the
[36:46] Bible said if two or three agree as
[36:47] touching any one thing it shall be done

[40:29] Shane sent an update to that today um as
[40:33] well and that you know with uh for
[40:36] brother joshu and sister Sharon we it's
[40:39] going to be a regular Church Fellowship
[40:42] dinner but we're going to have a table
[40:43] and have things there for uh just some
[40:46] housewarming gifts and what you would F
[40:49] on your heart uh to bring them so we'll
[40:51] have a table that's there it's an
[40:53] opportunity for us as a as a body of
[40:55] Believers some of of you went to the
[40:57] Gathering uh they had back in um the was
[41:00] it the end of December or the 1st of
[41:02] January I think over there in Cleveland
[41:04] for brother joshu some of you got a
[41:06] chance to go and uh but this will allow
[41:10] us as a whole uh assembly just to be
[41:13] able to uh have some time and just to
[41:16] not only fellowship with one another but
[41:18] also there with uh brother joshu and
[41:21] sister Sharon and I I just think it's U
[41:24] it's just lovely to have them here with
[41:25] us amen and um so in verse 13 of job 23
[41:32] we want to uh begin
[41:35] reading job said but he is of one mind
[41:38] and who can turn him and what his soul
[41:41] desireth even that he doeth for he
[41:46] performeth the thing that is appointed
[41:48] for me and many such things are with him
[41:53] therefore am I troubled at his presence
[41:57] when I consider I am afraid of him for
[42:01] God maketh my heart soft and the
[42:05] almighty troubleth me because I was not
[42:08] cut off before the darkness neither hath
[42:12] he covered the darkness from my face now
[42:15] remember those last three verses we read
[42:18] it's not God that has troubled him but
[42:22] God has permitted Satan to afflict joob
[42:27] I want you to think of this we can look
[42:29] at this within in this portion of
[42:32] scripture and we know that job doesn't
[42:33] come to this Revelation to the
[42:37] end and uh I'll let you be seated in the
[42:40] name of the Lord Jesus you know that you
[42:43] know that brother brandham remember
[42:44] brother brandham will take
[42:47] us and being what a privileged people we
[42:51] are in this end time to see how God has
[42:54] kept his word of promise
[42:56] promise he said that he would send to us
[42:59] Elijah the
[43:00] prophet and I want to say it like this I
[43:03] don't know for you maybe as I said
[43:05] before there's many other things I look
[43:06] at and I I've often many times I I just
[43:09] pondered when I would look at it of how
[43:11] that the prophet would tell us in many
[43:15] times you know brother Brandon would
[43:16] preach on job just specifically and then
[43:18] other times he would it would be
[43:19] interwoven through the message no matter
[43:21] what message you're listening to I know
[43:24] my redeemer liveth I want you to think
[43:26] of it in this way that sometimes when
[43:29] you read how brother Bram will say that
[43:31] even in the message I've heard but now I
[43:33] see it would say that it would seem as
[43:36] though that when brother Bram says that
[43:38] well brother brandham is saying that
[43:39] that glorious revelation of I know my
[43:41] redeemer liveth and he's really
[43:43] expressing that that that's something
[43:45] that job come to clear at the end and
[43:49] yet you say well it's in job 19 but I
[43:52] want to reme I want to remind you amen
[43:55] that not only did Our Redeemer rise that
[43:58] Easter morning but Our Redeemer has
[44:02] risen in the last
[44:04] days amen and you can see all the way
[44:07] through the Book of Job I I just some
[44:10] things keep bubbling over that I when I
[44:12] look through the Book of Job I see from
[44:14] Genesis all the way to Revelations I see
[44:16] the see the ages you see the seals you
[44:18] see all those things within all of that
[44:20] and how that when you recognize that
[44:22] it's God that has it all in control and
[44:25] I'm I'm grateful for that glorious
[44:27] revelation of Jesus Christ to us
[44:30] personally in this hour to know that
[44:32] he's got it all in control that he's the
[44:35] same he's the same God he's ever mindful
[44:38] of all that you and I have need of in
[44:41] our lives it wasn't it wasn't God as
[44:44] they was saying in these three verses
[44:45] that was troubling job but it was Satan
[44:49] that had gained permission and I want
[44:51] you to think of this you know we can
[44:53] look at it one way and say well how
[44:56] could job have thought that well
[44:58] remember job there was such a strength
[45:01] in Revelation that it so gripped his
[45:04] life till job knew the Hedge and the
[45:07] protection and the comfort that was
[45:09] about his life he knew his life was in
[45:12] God's hands he knew that there was
[45:15] nothing greater and there was nothing
[45:18] could take him away from God so to think
[45:22] and to look what has taken place what
[45:25] has happened where the his children are
[45:28] gone and all these things are happening
[45:30] and and to be able to look at it and
[45:32] realize that hey there is nothing that
[45:35] can penetrate the realities of God and
[45:39] truly in that of job's Soul job had it
[45:42] it was a type of what you and I would
[45:44] receive that is very true that
[45:47] Revelation that was there in job's heart
[45:50] no matter what could come and no matter
[45:52] the situation even when God would allow
[45:56] the Hedge to be relaxed and allow Satan
[45:59] to come in to begin to afflict job it
[46:02] could not separate job from his God and
[46:06] that's what's more important than having
[46:09] everything else we we all all of us like
[46:12] to have the everything go just right in
[46:14] our life we like to have things set just
[46:16] right in our home and all of us that's
[46:19] that's that's a part of us we and I
[46:21] believe I I want to say it like this
[46:23] even as Believers and as Christian s
[46:26] where the peace of God has touched your
[46:28] life you are lovers of Peace you love
[46:32] peace as a matter of fact the Bible says
[46:34] follow peace with all men the Bible
[46:37] would say live as peacely as you can
[46:40] because it's within your heart as a
[46:42] Believer you desire peace uh you know if
[46:45] you desire turmoil then you you might
[46:47] want to say Lord I I need a I I you know
[46:50] I I need a real visitation from The
[46:52] Prince of Peace himself but every life
[46:55] you desire that of a real of peace and
[46:58] so when job this would come about no
[47:00] wonder it would take him by surprise job
[47:03] even job did not have the understanding
[47:06] and the privilege that you and I have on
[47:09] this side of Calvary and with a word to
[47:12] be delivered to you and I and listen
[47:14] even though a word had laid here for
[47:16] Generations you realize the prophet
[47:19] would actually have to stand and in the
[47:21] midst of brandom Tabernacle address when
[47:25] even brother devil was in a car accident
[47:27] when the gun went off also in brother
[47:29] bram's face and brother Bram would have
[47:31] to address the congregation and says
[47:33] when things happen like this it doesn't
[47:36] mean that a person has sinned it means
[47:38] is this God is allowing a situation to
[47:41] take place to Tri us now I'll tell you
[47:45] if but it begins as we've said over and
[47:47] over for a Believer the first thing when
[47:49] anything comes along in our life I
[47:52] believe that not only it should be I but
[47:54] I believe it is the desire of a Believer
[47:56] we want to know where we're standing
[47:58] with God because we know as a Believer
[48:00] the Bible said he has freely given us
[48:02] all things and so we want to we always
[48:05] want to ensure that we are in that
[48:07] channel that the prophet called being
[48:10] justified in what you're asking for and
[48:12] to be able to stand there in the midst
[48:14] of this moment and say Lord I have stood
[48:18] upon your word everything that has been
[48:20] done I've followed your word if there's
[48:22] something that needed to be made right I
[48:24] have made that right Lord I've called
[48:26] for the Elders of the church I've been
[48:28] Anointed with oil confessed our faults
[48:30] Lord now I'm just Lord I'm standing this
[48:33] is your word that you gave us and I'm
[48:35] standing here Lord awaiting on the
[48:38] inspiration to drop for the word that
[48:40] you have given us and then we can stand
[48:43] there with a real a real assurance and
[48:46] that's uh when I look at this with job
[48:48] and where job is standing uh job is
[48:52] standing on on Solid Ground in his walk
[48:55] with God God but brother Brown tells us
[48:57] like this in I have heard but now I see
[49:00] he said but job had something wrong with
[49:03] him and he couldn't get the inspiration
[49:05] on him and it was worrying him anybody
[49:09] ever at Times wondered what's going
[49:13] on maybe only five of you ever worried
[49:16] that way I I mean I have what's going on
[49:19] sometimes in situations will take place
[49:21] what's happening what what's what's
[49:23] taking what's going on what's taking
[49:25] place you begin to examine your life
[49:27] whether it's the church whether it's
[49:28] family whatever you you begin to take it
[49:30] and examine your own life and so with
[49:33] job job was used to receiving
[49:36] inspiration from God now I don't know if
[49:38] job received inspiration daily I don't
[49:41] know if it was weekly or if it was
[49:43] monthly but at any point job had a
[49:45] connection with God where God would talk
[49:48] with him and the inspiration of the word
[49:51] would be given to job and So within it
[49:54] whatever that span of time and then then
[49:57] with what was taking place job could get
[49:59] no inspiration now I want you to think
[50:01] about this job actually would receive
[50:04] inspiration from God to be able to
[50:06] minister to others that were in the
[50:08] marketplace he would receive inspiration
[50:11] to minister to others that were around
[50:14] him God would release inspiration but
[50:16] for his own situation job had no
[50:20] inspiration at this moment and so
[50:23] because of that it was worrying him and
[50:27] look how brother Braham says this when
[50:29] you get in that kind of a fix that's
[50:32] when the enemy moves into every friend
[50:36] nearly you
[50:38] got now when we look at this of the
[50:41] thought I I'd like to speak once again
[50:43] tonight on that thought on why should I
[50:46] worry and we look at worry itself giving
[50:50] it it's actually to give away to anxiety
[50:53] or unease allow one's mind to dwell on
[50:57] difficulty or troubles to cause
[50:59] annoyance to to cause to feel anxiety or
[51:04] concern and no doubt maybe there's
[51:06] someone here tonight or some of us
[51:07] tonight that could look at that and say
[51:09] yep that's describing the feelings right
[51:12] now that could be going through me or
[51:14] it's describing feelings that have went
[51:16] through you because at some time or
[51:18] another we've all been worried or you
[51:21] can say concerned now I want to just say
[51:24] this right here tonight maybe before I
[51:26] make a step further that there is such a
[51:28] thing as a Godly worry you know when we
[51:31] look at it you would think a Godly worry
[51:33] how can that because worry would not be
[51:36] something that God would put on us but
[51:37] yet the prophet tells us that any Godly
[51:40] parent will have a Godly worry for their
[51:44] children they will have and so when you
[51:47] translate worry worry means concern now
[51:50] what matters when brother B say that it
[51:52] matters as to what a parent will do if a
[51:55] parent actually begins to take it so
[51:58] personal as though they're the ones to
[52:00] save them in other words they have got
[52:03] to be the ones to do the work and
[52:05] they've got to do and then then that
[52:06] worry it goes from being Godly to being
[52:09] ungodly because to be Godly worried is
[52:12] to go about it in the right way is to
[52:15] put it before God In Prayer to plead the
[52:17] blood over it and to say Lord help me to
[52:19] live such a life that will cause such a
[52:21] thirst Lord may you deal with them on
[52:23] their pillows at night Lord may you keep
[52:26] them Lord God keep them Lord from scars
[52:28] and things on their life may you Lord
[52:30] take a hold of their life may they come
[52:32] to know the same peace that you've given
[52:34] me Lord deal with them Lord you know
[52:36] their makeup you know how they're made
[52:38] up Lord you know Lord Jesus what it will
[52:40] take now father you're the same one
[52:42] who's got a hold of my life and I have
[52:45] got confidence in you you said that I
[52:47] could take this same token and have the
[52:49] confidence of what you've done in my
[52:51] life that you'll do the same miraculous
[52:54] Supernatural miracle in their life that
[52:57] you did in mine now that's taking it and
[53:00] keeping it as a Godly worry when we're
[53:03] praying over it but when it becomes
[53:04] something that we make exceptions and
[53:07] compromises and doing everything we can
[53:10] uh that goes outside of God's word and
[53:12] to where it actually begins to get us
[53:14] physically down then we've got to say
[53:16] wait a minute here it's moving from a
[53:18] Godly worry to ungodly youbody know what
[53:21] I'm talking about brother BR said even
[53:23] in the message he says that he had to
[53:26] catch himself because he saw the
[53:28] conditions of the world and how it was
[53:30] going and brother Bram said I have
[53:32] become I had become so worried he said
[53:34] that I almost had a breakdown two or
[53:36] three times and I had to realize and
[53:39] come back to what God had said in his
[53:41] word I mean who wouldn't be concerned
[53:43] you know if you're not concerned about
[53:45] your loved ones if you're not concerned
[53:47] about one another if you're not
[53:48] concerned about your brother and sister
[53:50] then then there's something wrong
[53:52] there's something a matter because there
[53:54] ought to be that desire on the inside I
[53:57] I don't believe that it's in any way
[53:59] that ifin our lives we just say well if
[54:01] they're predestinated they'll make it in
[54:03] and the reason you say brother samel how
[54:04] can you say it in that way because God's
[54:07] not flippant God himself when he
[54:09] predestinated us but he has made a way
[54:13] all the way God in other words you'll
[54:15] find that God was active to bring about
[54:19] what was needed to spark in our life
[54:22] that seed that he had swn there oh yeah
[54:25] so God just didn't say well if it'll be
[54:27] you know Cas sah sah that's not the
[54:29] attitude of God that's not the attitude
[54:31] of a Believer neither is it for you and
[54:34] I that I have to be the one and we get
[54:37] frustrated because we see I'm reaching
[54:39] out and they're going this way that that
[54:41] that's not of God either you you don't
[54:43] need to get frustrated with it just
[54:45] bring it right back into the word and
[54:47] say Lord I cast all of my cares upon
[54:52] you now my second Timothy 1:7 that's not
[54:57] even here in my notes but 2 Timothy 1:7
[55:01] For God now I want you to watch this in
[55:03] the scripture for God hath not given us
[55:06] the spirit of fear so anything remember
[55:10] fear and worry It Works hand in hand
[55:13] with doubt and so forth so if anything
[55:15] that would come in that way that would
[55:17] work Upon Us in that negative way that
[55:21] never came from God so he's not given us
[55:24] the spirit of fear fear is uncertainty
[55:26] fear is torment but this is the spirit
[55:29] that God has given us of power of love
[55:32] and of a sound mind notice the contrast
[55:36] one works to unsettle the other works to
[55:39] settle yeah this is so when we look at
[55:42] here in the scriptures of Romans 8:15
[55:45] for ye have not received the spirit of
[55:47] bondage again to fear but you have
[55:51] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[55:54] we cry Abba Father oh I'm so grateful
[55:58] for that aren't you amen I'm I'm
[56:01] grateful that not only can did he break
[56:03] the chains of sin and unbelief and doubt
[56:06] but I'm glad that he's still the same
[56:07] God that breaks the chains when fear or
[56:10] worry would want to go into such a way
[56:13] that it would actually affect our lives
[56:15] I'm grateful that God moves right around
[56:18] he gives us the strength to realize I do
[56:20] not have to operate in bondage to that
[56:22] of worry you say well why would that be
[56:25] because worry can affect our health
[56:27] worry itself can actually affect
[56:29] decisions you will make it will affect
[56:32] things in life and you know the enemy
[56:33] would love nothing more than to do that
[56:36] than just to plant a thought and then
[56:38] you start thinking upon that thought you
[56:40] dwell upon that thought I want you to
[56:42] remember every thought comes from a
[56:45] source every thought thoughts are not
[56:47] just random words that are flying in the
[56:49] air of people that all of a sudden had
[56:51] extra letters from a text or an email
[56:54] and they just show sh them out in into
[56:56] cyers space but every thought comes from
[56:59] a
[57:00] source and this is why the Bible said
[57:02] beloved try every Spirit try every
[57:07] thought you and I as Sons and Daughters
[57:09] of God we are given to Reign and Rule as
[57:13] Sons and Daughters of God by having the
[57:15] authority and jurisdiction over our
[57:17] lives to bring every single thought into
[57:22] judgment and I'll just tell you like
[57:24] this if there's a thought that's not
[57:26] willing to come to judgment and it seems
[57:28] like it's fighting it's very much so
[57:30] like that one of that person who had
[57:33] that robe appearing that would come
[57:35] there before those Believers and the
[57:37] believer said this seems very real seems
[57:39] very Supernatural it was a supernatural
[57:41] event but they said come and stand
[57:43] before Martin no sir that guy did not
[57:45] want to stand before Martin they said
[57:47] whether you want to or not you are
[57:50] coming to stand before Martin and when
[57:53] they brought him before Martin just as
[57:55] much as that robe supernaturally had
[57:57] appeared in the presence of Martin it
[58:01] supernaturally disappeared now it wasn't
[58:04] that Martin himself was anything but he
[58:07] recognized the authority of the word are
[58:09] you hearing me so you and I as a
[58:12] Believer we have an authority and matter
[58:15] of fact an admonition to bring every
[58:18] thought subject to The Obedience of
[58:22] Christ my I'll tell you when we will we
[58:25] will do that it will save us a whole lot
[58:28] of trouble so this of worry and how when
[58:31] we look through the scriptures of there
[58:34] of a discernment and we want to have
[58:36] that where the spirit of God will help
[58:38] us and give us discernment because when
[58:40] we look at you know many of you you
[58:42] think about even uh displacement you
[58:44] know you think think about having a cup
[58:47] and you feel that cup to the water to
[58:49] the brim with water now if I were to
[58:51] give you a handful of ice you would look
[58:54] at that and say Brother Sam hold on hold
[58:55] on hold on hold on careful I need to
[58:56] pour some of this water out well why do
[58:58] you need to pour some of that out
[59:00] because if I don't when you put that
[59:02] load of ice in there it's going to
[59:05] displace a lot of water that's in there
[59:08] because the ice forces it out and I'll
[59:11] tell you right now we can sit here we
[59:13] could join hands and say don't worry
[59:15] don't worry don't worry but there's one
[59:17] thing that God knows that you and I have
[59:19] need of more and more and more in our
[59:22] life we need more of the love of God
[59:25] because when we receive more of God's
[59:27] Divine love I'll tell you it's like
[59:29] taking you know that cup like that it
[59:31] might be filled with water but when
[59:33] God's love is coming down it brings into
[59:35] our life a
[59:37] displacement of worry it does amen
[59:41] that's real casting off is't it the
[59:43] Bible said perfect love casteth out all
[59:46] fear and I love that in the scripture
[59:48] that phrase casteth out it means to
[59:50] actually if I were to take this and just
[59:52] throw it and I don't care where it lands
[59:56] in other words I'm no longer
[1:00:00] worried don't you love the word of
[1:00:03] God now I want you to look at this I
[1:00:05] read this quote to you last week but I
[1:00:07] want to read it as we're looking at this
[1:00:08] of a of a spirit and how Spirits would
[1:00:11] come around in that of worry because
[1:00:13] remember job himself the Bible or
[1:00:17] brother BR tells us in three kinds of
[1:00:19] Believers and I've read this quote to
[1:00:20] you over and over but he said as long as
[1:00:23] Satan could make J believe it was his
[1:00:26] God doing it he had job
[1:00:29] whipped now that thought wasn't coming
[1:00:32] from
[1:00:33] God but and the thought itself job was
[1:00:36] standing against his friends that said
[1:00:38] you're a secret sinner job Knew by the
[1:00:40] word I've done everything that the word
[1:00:42] has asked for me to do I'm standing
[1:00:44] righteous but he could not understand
[1:00:47] why is this
[1:00:50] happening so Satan just takes a moment
[1:00:53] to interject a thought remember how
[1:00:55] brother Bram talks about cancer to me
[1:00:56] it's absolutely phenomenal when brother
[1:00:58] Bram will talk about cancer he said it
[1:01:00] starts out with a little bruised cell
[1:01:02] and he said through that little bruise
[1:01:04] cell then a little life enters in there
[1:01:06] and begins to live off of the
[1:01:08] bloodstream isn't it amazing how Satan
[1:01:11] is an opportunistic he'll take when
[1:01:13] bruising has come spiritually Even in
[1:01:16] our lives offenses and everything else
[1:01:18] and he will come in listen Satan doesn't
[1:01:20] care if you've lost a loved one he'll
[1:01:23] see that oh that's an opp opportunity
[1:01:25] time and he will move right in with
[1:01:28] something that's so contrary to that to
[1:01:31] do what try to work and hinder and bring
[1:01:33] us down is that right Satan he's and
[1:01:37] that's why brother Bam could say in
[1:01:38] greatest B fault he said Satan oh that
[1:01:40] vile enemy he said he he'll light right
[1:01:43] into a child he'll light right into
[1:01:45] anyone he don't care Satan doesn't care
[1:01:47] how beautiful the baby is he doesn't
[1:01:49] even care how bad the situation or maybe
[1:01:53] things of of what has gone through with
[1:01:54] the family Satan does not hold off at
[1:01:57] that time but he will try to find some
[1:01:59] sort of a little bruise or something he
[1:02:02] can move into to interject a thought and
[1:02:06] then we can just start dwelling on that
[1:02:07] thought and a boy after a time it's like
[1:02:10] a baby that starts developing in the
[1:02:14] womb right and it has different ways it
[1:02:17] gives birth in our life but I want you
[1:02:19] to watch how this of a spirit the true
[1:02:21] and false Vine brother Ram says now this
[1:02:24] woman she's standing near she has a real
[1:02:27] dismal funny Spirit watch how he
[1:02:29] describes this it's a spirit of worry
[1:02:33] and fearful she's all nervous and upset
[1:02:37] and she's bothered a lot with a nervous
[1:02:40] Condition it's about a condition of her
[1:02:44] body that she's worrying about she's
[1:02:47] planning on an examination at a clinic
[1:02:49] kind of a hospital clinic Affair for
[1:02:51] cancer it's a cancer that you're worried
[1:02:54] about so it isn't so much that she's
[1:02:57] worried about the clinic it's what test
[1:03:02] that she's going to be tested
[1:03:04] for and how that that in itself can get
[1:03:07] right you realize when there's certain
[1:03:09] diagnosis of charts I think listen this
[1:03:12] is just this isn't gospel it's just
[1:03:13] brother Samuel's thoughts but I think
[1:03:16] sometimes when some you know we have all
[1:03:17] this access to our medical records now
[1:03:20] you can get in if so and so has just
[1:03:22] tested you and done blood work you know
[1:03:24] you can get into your chart and if
[1:03:27] you're not careful you'll become the own
[1:03:29] interpreter of those results and you
[1:03:31] didn't even go to you didn't go to one
[1:03:33] Medical School you didn't go to one
[1:03:34] class at all and you're sitting there
[1:03:36] trying to read that that's true and if
[1:03:38] you're not careful your pro your
[1:03:39] appointment might not be for two weeks
[1:03:41] later but you have made adjustments in
[1:03:43] your own life just based on what you've
[1:03:45] read in that report and you're not even
[1:03:47] qualified to read that
[1:03:50] report that's so true but you see what
[1:03:52] it is look in this age so much
[1:03:55] information is given to us and sometimes
[1:03:57] friends sometimes the information we
[1:03:59] have I'm glad that there's certain
[1:04:01] things that we're able to access into
[1:04:03] and tap into and I think about you know
[1:04:05] the the the kids and things like that I
[1:04:07] remember when I used to have to go to
[1:04:08] the library and stay in there when I do
[1:04:10] reports and everything else and then it
[1:04:12] got to a place of my I can sit right
[1:04:14] there and I can have access to all the
[1:04:16] research that I need to do and bring it
[1:04:19] right in to the same channel but yet at
[1:04:21] the same time the Bible tells us that as
[1:04:24] that as Generations would go on we get
[1:04:27] smarter wiser and weaker and the
[1:04:31] information sometimes that we have that
[1:04:33] is at our fingertips the things that
[1:04:35] then we look at and think oh my oh oh my
[1:04:38] goodness oh oh could this be and yet
[1:04:40] then oh and you know we listen friends
[1:04:43] sometimes when a report comes our way
[1:04:45] listen don't ever let the devil try to
[1:04:48] wear you out for having any sort of a
[1:04:50] worry and you go get a test or the worry
[1:04:53] about well I don't know what this result
[1:04:55] listen you have a high priest who's
[1:04:57] touched by the feeling of your
[1:04:58] infirmities you can say Lord I'm not
[1:05:00] qualified to read these results but you
[1:05:02] already knew it was there and if there's
[1:05:04] something that's there you're still my
[1:05:06] healer if it's not you're still my
[1:05:08] healer Lord I am going to commit my life
[1:05:12] completely and this situation into your
[1:05:14] hands and if you find troubled then find
[1:05:17] find a brother sister somebody else
[1:05:19] around you husband and wife say hey
[1:05:21] let's go to prayer about this cuz we're
[1:05:22] not going to let this dominate our life
[1:05:25] so it should sometimes we do respond
[1:05:27] upon concerns now brother BR said in
[1:05:30] regarding to this woman you were praying
[1:05:32] before coming and it was revealed to you
[1:05:34] as you were praying that if you would
[1:05:36] come here and I would pray for you that
[1:05:38] they'd find no cancer one thing that she
[1:05:40] did that was absolutely the right thing
[1:05:42] to do was
[1:05:44] pray that was the right thing to do
[1:05:47] instead of worrying about it and you
[1:05:49] know going to this one going to that one
[1:05:51] going to this one going to that one oh I
[1:05:53] don't know and those things can be
[1:05:54] fearful Hey listen the word cancer
[1:05:56] itself it carries a tormenting Spirit
[1:05:59] matter of fact any disease or sickness
[1:06:01] to it it carries a tormenting
[1:06:04] Spirit but to see that with this right
[1:06:07] here that even when that itself that
[1:06:09] word could be mentioned but notice how
[1:06:12] this little lady did she went to God In
[1:06:15] Prayer friends I believe this with all
[1:06:17] my heart I have found this in my own
[1:06:19] life it's things that continually that
[1:06:22] even when I feel in a moment of worry I
[1:06:24] have to be reminded of this there is no
[1:06:27] other source I know that I appreciate my
[1:06:30] wife I love my wife her and I have
[1:06:32] wonderful Fellowship together but
[1:06:34] there's nobody that can minister to what
[1:06:37] I have need of when I am
[1:06:40] worried like the Lord now God can use
[1:06:43] her and he has used her many different
[1:06:45] times to minister to me even when I have
[1:06:48] been worried but I would say this right
[1:06:50] here do not become resting upon other
[1:06:53] people make the the Lord your
[1:06:55] Refuge because God knows what you have
[1:06:57] need of now this is where we we come as
[1:07:00] children of God in Mark 16:1 17 the
[1:07:03] Bible said these signs shall follow them
[1:07:06] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:07:09] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:07:12] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:07:14] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:07:17] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:07:20] the sick and they shall recover
[1:07:25] now I want you to think brother bam will
[1:07:27] take this scripture and remember he
[1:07:28] talks about Paul of how that Viper came
[1:07:31] up in that when Paul was getting
[1:07:32] firewood and that Viper came up and laid
[1:07:35] hold on Paul and the Bible tells us that
[1:07:37] Paul shook it off into the fire brother
[1:07:39] Brown will take that and he'll you know
[1:07:41] TI he'll bring it in with that of how
[1:07:43] that Paul was not going out to be a
[1:07:45] snake Handler but Paul was going about
[1:07:47] his what would be a task at that time to
[1:07:50] get that wood and he said what when that
[1:07:53] when that latched on that Viper remember
[1:07:54] how all the people to the island
[1:07:56] gathered around and they're just
[1:07:57] watching at him I mean looking at him
[1:07:59] you know and just waiting to see him
[1:08:01] fall over cuz they knew what a bite and
[1:08:04] what Venom that Viper had but Paul had
[1:08:06] shook it off into the fire now you know
[1:08:09] these are things when brother R will say
[1:08:10] it like this he'll take that of the
[1:08:12] Viper he'll take that and say when
[1:08:14] you're actually cooking your eggs he
[1:08:15] said and that grease pops out of the pan
[1:08:18] and it hits your it hits your hand he
[1:08:20] said and you quickly go and grab that
[1:08:22] bottle of I don't know what the stuff's
[1:08:23] called I don't really know how to
[1:08:24] pronounce it but whatever it is to put
[1:08:26] on that burn he said it's not the grease
[1:08:29] that burns you it's the fear that burns
[1:08:34] you figure that one out why don't you
[1:08:38] it's a fear that burns you what was it
[1:08:39] with Paul if Paul would allow that that
[1:08:42] that particular that serpent to have get
[1:08:45] to him and get in his mind Lord have
[1:08:47] mercy you'd read a different story is
[1:08:50] that right but it wasn't that Paul was a
[1:08:52] superhuman oh brother Samuel he was a
[1:08:54] prophet of God let me remind you the
[1:08:56] prophets were subject to like passion
[1:08:59] such as we
[1:09:01] are is that right you're in the line of
[1:09:03] duty something comes along like this you
[1:09:06] can say Lord you are my
[1:09:10] healer now notice they C in my name they
[1:09:13] shall cast out Devils what that tells me
[1:09:16] is there will be Spirits Devils it tells
[1:09:19] me that there will be encroachments of
[1:09:21] the enemy but God has commanded us us to
[1:09:24] cast him out and you know what that is
[1:09:27] that's acting just like him of what he
[1:09:29] did in heaven when Satan beginning begin
[1:09:32] to act up in heaven he cast him out he
[1:09:35] didn't ask him to leave hey hey Mr
[1:09:37] Lucifer do you think y'all could go
[1:09:38] ahead he cast him
[1:09:41] out and that's what this word cast means
[1:09:44] to cast out drive out send out to
[1:09:47] command or cause one to depart in haste
[1:09:49] and to reject with contempt and cast off
[1:09:53] for a away greatest batt ever fought
[1:09:55] Satan's Army brings diseases and God's
[1:09:57] Army is commissioned to cast them out
[1:10:00] there you are every time Satan throws
[1:10:03] any on you onto you God's Army is to
[1:10:07] cast him
[1:10:08] out so anytime any sickness or disease
[1:10:12] comes on you God's Army is commanded to
[1:10:14] cast him out now watch that's the very
[1:10:17] technique that God used Satan used the
[1:10:19] army of Destruction to disbelieve God's
[1:10:22] word and set him up a better Kingdom
[1:10:24] than Michael had and God cast him out
[1:10:27] God's method how many want to use God's
[1:10:31] method God's method is cast out the evil
[1:10:35] cast down reasoning cast down
[1:10:37] Superstition cast down Google I'm sorry
[1:10:40] cast down worry cast down diseases cast
[1:10:43] down sin
[1:10:45] amen yes you're here's how you can do it
[1:10:50] you're above it Resurrected in Christ
[1:10:54] Jesus setting in Heavenly places with
[1:10:57] every devil under your foot if he starts
[1:11:01] to stick his head in there that's the
[1:11:03] privilege you have as being a child of
[1:11:06] God filled with the spirit of God that
[1:11:09] every devil is under your foot
[1:11:12] Hallelujah it doesn't matter if he comes
[1:11:14] to stick his head in there that has
[1:11:16] nothing to do with it it's where you
[1:11:19] have authority to cast him
[1:11:22] out are you hearing me but in our mind
[1:11:26] sometimes we have that that thinking of
[1:11:28] casting out as instantaneously sometimes
[1:11:31] it
[1:11:32] is sometimes it is sometimes right where
[1:11:34] hands are being laid on it's cast out
[1:11:36] right while the preaching you realize
[1:11:38] right while the preaching of the word
[1:11:39] goes on there are devils that are being
[1:11:42] scattered well well the word's being
[1:11:44] preached unbelief is being cut away is
[1:11:47] that right diseases sicknesses being
[1:11:49] healed what is it we're battling Spirits
[1:11:51] that's why when we come here we are not
[1:11:53] not coming here to a picnic this is a
[1:11:55] Battleground it's a war we are coming
[1:11:58] here once again to declare in a war on
[1:12:02] Satan's
[1:12:06] kingdom noce he says you are dead and
[1:12:09] your life is hid what is dead you're
[1:12:11] dead to your senses you're dead to your
[1:12:13] conscience your own human will would say
[1:12:16] yes I guess I but you're dead to your
[1:12:19] reasoning dead to all those things and
[1:12:22] you are buried in the name of of Jesus
[1:12:24] Christ and raised with him and wherever
[1:12:25] he is there you are
[1:12:28] also he raised above every
[1:12:32] principality power is that right he did
[1:12:35] the Holy Ghost inside of you is not the
[1:12:38] third person of the godhead it's the
[1:12:40] same portion of the same God Who Rose on
[1:12:43] that Easter morning and he sent back the
[1:12:46] Holy Ghost you listen you didn't need
[1:12:48] the fullness you received your portion
[1:12:51] and your portion was a enough to whip
[1:12:54] every devil out of hell that portion of
[1:12:57] your inheritance was enough to overcome
[1:13:00] Satan's kingdom and you to stand
[1:13:03] victorious in this hour even as we read
[1:13:06] in this quote when your own human will
[1:13:10] would say I guess anybody ever have to
[1:13:12] battle with that human will anybody have
[1:13:15] to crucify him
[1:13:16] daily well I do I got both my hands up
[1:13:19] I've got to crucify that human will
[1:13:21] listen this is one of the reasons not
[1:13:22] only for Redemption that God become
[1:13:25] human become one of us but God himself
[1:13:28] he begin to experience the Bible said he
[1:13:30] learned obedience by the things that he
[1:13:34] suffered why because to obey the word is
[1:13:38] not always something that feels good
[1:13:42] neither is it something that is always
[1:13:44] going to be pleasing or comfortable for
[1:13:47] the flesh but to obey the word of God is
[1:13:51] greater than any sacrifice we could make
[1:13:54] with the flesh it's to obey the word of
[1:13:57] God and he learned obedience by the
[1:14:00] things that he
[1:14:01] suffered what was it
[1:14:04] nevertheless not my will thine will be
[1:14:08] done brother BR tells us there he says
[1:14:10] in Hebrews 5 he was heard even with
[1:14:13] strong tears and crying in that he that
[1:14:15] he had cried in that he had suffered and
[1:14:17] brother B said here he was contending
[1:14:20] with
[1:14:21] himself that shouldn't be no who do you
[1:14:24] contend with who do I contend
[1:14:27] with right this this right here on the
[1:14:29] outside this is not the deity this is
[1:14:32] not this is only like this this screen
[1:14:34] or this wall that's what this is it
[1:14:36] allows the invisible to be made visible
[1:14:40] Hallelujah right but I always you know
[1:14:42] think about what if we had graffiti road
[1:14:44] all over this wall well you could still
[1:14:46] project it same thing on now on that
[1:14:47] screen back there but it wouldn't look
[1:14:49] just right so our duty is Lord I want to
[1:14:52] keep this house this it's a past house
[1:14:56] but I want to keep my life such in a
[1:14:58] place to where the image of Christ is
[1:15:02] projected without
[1:15:06] compromise notice brother B says what
[1:15:08] happened to him one of them doubters got
[1:15:10] in heaven God kicked him out and what
[1:15:12] did he say to the soldiers that's raised
[1:15:14] in Christ how many of you Soldier
[1:15:17] Hallelujah when a devil comes along kick
[1:15:20] him out cast him out
[1:15:23] don't ask him to leave cast him out
[1:15:27] brother B tells us in 1965 ashamed he's
[1:15:30] talking about his own self he said I
[1:15:32] feel like it's got to a place with me to
[1:15:35] where I'm asking the devil would you
[1:15:37] mind to leave he said but that is not
[1:15:39] what God has called me to do God has
[1:15:41] called me to cast him out amen doesn't
[1:15:44] mean through indifference it does listen
[1:15:46] because devils are not cast out by cruel
[1:15:48] and indifferent living the way that
[1:15:50] Satan is overcome is by the love of God
[1:15:52] pulsating in our Our Lives
[1:15:54] amall is that right notice 1 Peter 5:7
[1:15:58] casting all your care this word care
[1:16:01] means anxieties and worries casting all
[1:16:05] your care upon him for he carth for
[1:16:11] you now watch how brother brandwood
[1:16:13] bring this he says in the message
[1:16:15] expectation he said you've got something
[1:16:17] on your mind that you're worried about
[1:16:19] you're upset I see something hanging
[1:16:22] near you you you're upset about
[1:16:24] something aren't you you're worried now
[1:16:26] I said be honest with me it's something
[1:16:28] you're worrying about here it comes it's
[1:16:31] concerning childbirth you're afraid of a
[1:16:35] miscarriage which being pregnant don't
[1:16:39] worry go and Jesus Christ probably what
[1:16:43] follow make you well he said let's say
[1:16:46] praise be to God to Jesus Christ let's
[1:16:49] give God praise like this the people
[1:16:51] glorify God now he said said goes on to
[1:16:54] say he's here to make well to heal to do
[1:16:56] all things the reason I kept holding on
[1:16:59] with the lady I try not to hold on those
[1:17:03] people too long if I see one thing I
[1:17:06] just let it go but the lady was stumped
[1:17:09] when I said she was worrying about
[1:17:11] something and I noticed then and I seen
[1:17:13] what she was worried about and I went
[1:17:15] ahead till her faith got confirmed how
[1:17:18] many of you are glad I know I'm thankful
[1:17:21] I'm glad that God just don't pass me on
[1:17:22] by but God will hold me right here
[1:17:25] amall I'm glad that God will take a man
[1:17:28] of God move him off his notes if need be
[1:17:30] hold me right here till my faith is
[1:17:32] Right Lord hold me right here Lord till
[1:17:35] everything is just
[1:17:37] right Glory he knows what what we're
[1:17:39] concerned about he knows what our
[1:17:41] worries and we're standing here not
[1:17:43] because we want to keep our cares but I
[1:17:45] want to cast on my care upon him for he
[1:17:50] carth for you notice he says sometimes
[1:17:53] you have to talk longer than others but
[1:17:55] of course that lightens brings the crowd
[1:17:57] down and may have to cut it off short
[1:17:58] and be reverent now he said all right
[1:18:00] lady talking to the same sister
[1:18:02] everybody be reverent you are blessed my
[1:18:05] sister don't you fear you only have
[1:18:09] faith now why would brother randam tell
[1:18:10] her this don't you
[1:18:12] fear because he knows that Satan is
[1:18:16] going to be right there to come back and
[1:18:18] try to poke it around again she sees a
[1:18:21] little something that's out of the way
[1:18:23] feels a little something that's out of
[1:18:24] the way with her pregnancy and
[1:18:26] immediately the enemy would want to move
[1:18:28] in and say it could be this ah it could
[1:18:31] be
[1:18:33] this now I don't think I'm the only one
[1:18:35] that that old sloot's tried to do that
[1:18:37] to that's right you are blessed my
[1:18:40] sister don't you fear you only have
[1:18:43] faith don't let nobody put nothing else
[1:18:48] in your mind you're going to be all
[1:18:51] right
[1:18:53] now let me just say if this if this was
[1:18:55] me which I believe many of us maybe we
[1:18:58] haven't been called out just like that
[1:18:59] but the spirit of God has dealt with our
[1:19:01] heart right in the midst of a service
[1:19:03] maybe you've been at prayer at home
[1:19:04] maybe listening to a message and the
[1:19:06] spirit of God has spoke like that right
[1:19:08] in our hearts right then don't turn
[1:19:10] around and turn to the Earthly worldly
[1:19:13] measures of carnal reasoning but brother
[1:19:15] Samuel I've got to have a test on her
[1:19:17] I've got to have this but you're not
[1:19:18] turning around and looking at it and
[1:19:21] going to entertain fear or doubt or I'm
[1:19:24] going to go and see what so and so says
[1:19:26] and I'm going to give I'm going to go
[1:19:27] check out and see what my my cousin's
[1:19:29] cousin you know who's a nursea a nurse
[1:19:31] Tech and see what she has to say about
[1:19:33] it why don't you just take it to Dr
[1:19:37] Jesus because even if nurse Tech so and
[1:19:40] so knows this and knows that it will
[1:19:42] never bring you peace but there is a
[1:19:46] place where we can go
[1:19:48] to and that's
[1:19:51] him that's even when you can't get a
[1:19:54] hold of brother Samuel you can't get a
[1:19:56] hold of nobody else you have an access
[1:20:00] 247 a hotline to
[1:20:05] Jesus yes sir now watch this in
[1:20:08] questions and answers part
[1:20:10] one brother bman I I want to just I want
[1:20:13] to just read this when we're looking at
[1:20:15] this of effects of how that Satan would
[1:20:19] desire just to take even certain
[1:20:21] circumstances of life and as we said use
[1:20:24] a circumstance of life to then interject
[1:20:28] worry and then ultimately to tear us
[1:20:32] down watch how brother Bram and question
[1:20:34] answerers 64 dear brother brandham my
[1:20:37] wife and I were separated she is suing
[1:20:39] me for a divorce she's not a Christian
[1:20:42] and I believe the message and I want her
[1:20:44] to be saved brother say ain't that
[1:20:45] really nice that's a real Christian
[1:20:47] spirit and believe what must I do we
[1:20:50] also have two boys and they signed their
[1:20:52] your name brother brother R's brother
[1:20:54] look let me tell you she's going to sue
[1:20:56] you for a divorce that's Satan you
[1:20:59] shouldn't do that but if you're a
[1:21:01] Christian and done nothing in the world
[1:21:03] to hinder that woman then it's Satan
[1:21:06] doing that he's only trying to tear you
[1:21:09] up now why would brother Bram say that
[1:21:11] because in order to minister the remedy
[1:21:15] if there's anything that man has done in
[1:21:19] not standing steadfast as he ought to as
[1:21:22] a Real Son of God he's got to be able to
[1:21:25] he's got to make that right in order to
[1:21:28] experience a real release in this hour
[1:21:31] come on friends this is why brother Bram
[1:21:34] says this brother Bram talks about it
[1:21:35] you know and he I I preach that message
[1:21:37] on he careth for you and dealing with
[1:21:38] principles of Deliverance remember
[1:21:40] brother Bram says he was up in
[1:21:41] Bellingham New York he said I had people
[1:21:43] come through the prayer line and they
[1:21:44] came through the prayer line and he said
[1:21:46] after they came out of the prayer line
[1:21:48] he said here they were he said the next
[1:21:49] day or two with the same condition going
[1:21:51] on in their life brother R said I
[1:21:53] thought what in the world is going on he
[1:21:55] said but what the angel of the Lord told
[1:21:57] me he said you bring those people up
[1:21:59] there and you have them to repent of
[1:22:02] what's wrong in their life brother BR
[1:22:04] said what it was this is very powerful
[1:22:06] he said what it was when they came
[1:22:07] across there in the presence of the
[1:22:10] Angel of the Lord it took the condition
[1:22:13] away but because they weren't right in
[1:22:16] their heart it allowed Satan to move
[1:22:19] back in wow wow brother Bram takes a
[1:22:22] whole month of 63 and he deals with this
[1:22:25] whole principle and he's even looking
[1:22:27] from previously in his ministry to
[1:22:29] understand why are the people unstable
[1:22:31] now why is what I want you to see is
[1:22:33] because if you're a Christian and done
[1:22:34] nothing in the world to hinder that
[1:22:36] woman then it's Satan doing that he's
[1:22:39] only trying to tear you up now watch
[1:22:42] this if she's one of God's elected
[1:22:45] she'll come to it if she's not she's not
[1:22:49] worth worrying
[1:22:51] about
[1:22:53] if you worry watch this if you worry
[1:22:56] it'll break down your health and that's
[1:22:59] what Satan wants to
[1:23:02] do wow he's working I know at you so you
[1:23:08] just commit the whole thing to God and
[1:23:10] go right on serving God just as happy as
[1:23:14] you can be God will take care of the
[1:23:16] rest of it now this going to be
[1:23:18] important I don't know what happened
[1:23:20] with this man but if this man ends this
[1:23:22] moment this service with a
[1:23:24] butt he'll carry this from now
[1:23:29] on he has to be able to accept God's
[1:23:32] word listen friends there's no greater
[1:23:35] remedy than the word of God I I I I
[1:23:38] don't believe we need listen I I
[1:23:39] appreciate other books I appreciate
[1:23:40] other things I'm not against brother BR
[1:23:42] said anything that helps is of God is
[1:23:44] helps is Godly but I look at it and I
[1:23:47] think Lord has put promise after promise
[1:23:50] and God in this generation would allow
[1:23:53] things like this to be recorded it could
[1:23:55] have stopped right after brother randam
[1:23:57] got done preaching but I thank God for
[1:23:59] these situations that are mentioned in
[1:24:02] here why for you and I to draw strength
[1:24:06] from because I'm not standing as as this
[1:24:09] man stood no doubt there's many of you
[1:24:11] is not standing in the same shoes that
[1:24:13] this man is standing in but we all have
[1:24:16] or are or will experience worry in some
[1:24:19] form or another and to remember no
[1:24:22] matter what it is Satan's objective is
[1:24:25] to try to tear you
[1:24:28] down why cuz if he can get you down in
[1:24:31] your Tabernacle in your spirit in your
[1:24:33] mind you're not effective that's
[1:24:36] right is that
[1:24:39] right oh my God will take care of the
[1:24:42] rest of it all that the father has given
[1:24:43] me will come to me get down on your
[1:24:45] knees look at this I'll pray with you or
[1:24:47] anything I'll pray over the matter and
[1:24:49] just say I always love this when when
[1:24:51] the prophet just gives us the words to
[1:24:53] pray just say Lord God I love her she's
[1:24:56] the mother of my children and say I just
[1:24:59] commit the whole thing to you Lord I
[1:25:01] want them saved you know I do but I
[1:25:03] can't go no further she's going to
[1:25:05] divorce me and I haven't done nothing if
[1:25:07] I have reveal it to me I'll go make it
[1:25:09] right I'll do anything then commit it to
[1:25:12] the Lord and just let it alone just let
[1:25:15] it alone go right on living just as
[1:25:17] nothing had ever happened and God will
[1:25:19] take care of the rest of it now if you
[1:25:22] ask ask me and expect me to explain how
[1:25:24] that happens I can't explain that but I
[1:25:28] do know this that I have experienced
[1:25:30] things that to me it's It's Supernatural
[1:25:32] of things that I have worried carried as
[1:25:34] burdens and then just in that moment to
[1:25:36] where it's been committed to him and and
[1:25:39] you just you feel a peace about it oh
[1:25:41] you you feel a you feel a I don't know
[1:25:43] how it's going to come out but hey
[1:25:45] there's a peace about this let me tell
[1:25:47] you I would rather have that peace than
[1:25:49] for God to come down and tell me this is
[1:25:52] going to happen this is going to happen
[1:25:53] this is going to happen why cuz I might
[1:25:55] get worried between that this is going
[1:25:57] to happen this is going to happen this
[1:25:59] is going to happen but if God deposits a
[1:26:01] fresh deposit of Peace regarding a
[1:26:04] situation what will it do it will
[1:26:07] dissolve or
[1:26:09] displace my worry that's so good yes
[1:26:13] sir yes sir now can I have just a few
[1:26:16] more
[1:26:17] moments watch this I want you to watch
[1:26:20] this effects here let me read a few
[1:26:21] scripture a few verses or out of the
[1:26:23] message quotes brother BR says you're
[1:26:25] suffering with many things 1950 one
[1:26:28] thing that you're real nervous you're
[1:26:30] weak and your strength well he said here
[1:26:32] it is it's a stomach trouble that you
[1:26:34] have now what's caused this sister is a
[1:26:38] nervous condition so she has a stomach
[1:26:40] trouble but the cause of it is a nervous
[1:26:43] condition now you see one thing about
[1:26:45] God God will not just give you and I and
[1:26:49] I'm grateful he won't just take care of
[1:26:53] what is it that's trouble because
[1:26:54] there's probably every one of us at
[1:26:55] times we've had certain things to Lord I
[1:26:57] need a real touch from you and sometimes
[1:26:59] what God touches Us in the infirmity in
[1:27:01] our body is not really the cause that's
[1:27:05] good right but God has a way to go down
[1:27:07] to what's causing it that's why brother
[1:27:10] Brandon would say over and over he carth
[1:27:12] for you he cares do you care in 1963
[1:27:14] brother Brandon would repeat these
[1:27:16] things over and over he says we know the
[1:27:18] Cure the answer is Christ but we've got
[1:27:20] to find the call cause of
[1:27:23] it we got to find the cause of it now
[1:27:27] watch he says what's caused this sister
[1:27:29] is a nervous Condition it's a peptic
[1:27:31] ulcer in your stomach it causes pains
[1:27:33] and souring of the stomach and unrest
[1:27:35] and sometimes you think you have heart
[1:27:38] trouble but that's not heart trouble
[1:27:40] you're talking about an MRI who yes
[1:27:43] sir quit worrying about that usually
[1:27:48] when you lay down you'll have that
[1:27:50] that's a gas on your stomach stomachs

[1:29:06] studying the message of the hour when

[1:29:10] and say how can it be for this one look
[1:29:11] I this word it comes to examine my
[1:29:15] life it's God ministering to our lives
[1:29:18] together collectively don't ever think
[1:29:21] that a minister is one who's up here and
[1:29:24] ministering to these sorry people down
[1:29:26] here God works with experiences in the
[1:29:29] man's life to be able to
[1:29:32] minister with
[1:29:35] compassion Lord You're an awful deep
[1:29:37] thinker aren't you sister got a weary
[1:29:40] Spirit too always worrying about things

[1:29:45] nervous upset watch this caused you to
[1:29:48] have acid in your blood which has give
[1:29:51] you arthritis
[1:29:52] wow wow
[1:29:55] wow now he didn't just say I'll tell you
[1:29:57] what that arthritis go take some
[1:29:59] ibuprofen take three of them drink lots
[1:30:01] of water with it make sure you take
[1:30:02] something on your stomach ain't nothing
[1:30:04] wrong with ibuprofen Motrin leave
[1:30:06] whatever it is but
[1:30:07] notice sometimes the things that we're
[1:30:10] treating are coming from a different
[1:30:15] Source we're saying God heal me of my
[1:30:18] arthritis God heal me of my stiffness
[1:30:20] God heal me of this and yet what's
[1:30:22] causing it is
[1:30:25] worry I tell you what you cannot there
[1:30:28] ain't no amount of money you could pay
[1:30:30] for this kind of MRI that's right
[1:30:33] Absolut well the devil ain't got a place
[1:30:35] to hide with
[1:30:38] this oh my let me let me finish out here
[1:30:40] Proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a
[1:30:46] strong
[1:30:47] tower and the
[1:30:49] righteous walk into it
[1:30:54] runthe and is safe yes sir the name of
[1:30:59] the Lord is who he is it's his word
[1:31:02] being revealed he is our source our
[1:31:05] Avenue of strength I don't want to just
[1:31:07] look at it when he makes himself known I
[1:31:09] want to
[1:31:11] run run into him that's
[1:31:15] right Isaiah 32:1 Behold a king shall
[1:31:18] reign in righteousness and princes shall
[1:31:20] rule in judgment and
[1:31:22] man shall be as an hiding place from the
[1:31:28] wind and a covert from The Tempest as
[1:31:31] rivers of water in a dry place as the
[1:31:36] shadow of a great rock hallelujah in a
[1:31:39] weary land now do you
[1:31:42] notice he didn't say and a man shall
[1:31:45] take away all of those conditions but he
[1:31:49] said this is what he'll be to you
[1:31:52] Hallelujah he'll be your covert he'll be
[1:31:55] your shelter when you're dry he'll be as
[1:31:59] rivers of water glory be to
[1:32:03] God oh my no wonder the prophet could
[1:32:06] say in letting off the pressure he said
[1:32:08] no matter what takes place Christ is our
[1:32:10] refuge and when we come to him we can
[1:32:13] let off the pressure you can quit
[1:32:15] worrying about well if I die what's
[1:32:17] going to happen to me what's going to
[1:32:18] happen to the wife what's going to
[1:32:19] happen to the husband what's going to
[1:32:21] happen to the children just come to
[1:32:23] Christ and let off the pressure all he
[1:32:28] give us all things all things are ours
[1:32:31] by Christ so just let the pressure off
[1:32:34] and the only way you can do it oh goes
[1:32:38] on to say somebody could give you a
[1:32:39] million dollars and it would build up
[1:32:44] pressure you'd be worrying I wonder if
[1:32:46] so and so they they're probably thinking
[1:32:48] I need to give them
[1:32:50] something
[1:32:52] they're they're probably thinking that I
[1:32:53] should I should what would that cause
[1:32:56] worry worry worry but in this incredible
[1:33:01] of what the Lord Jesus will give you
[1:33:03] will actually take away your worry
[1:33:05] that's right and as we can where we will
[1:33:08] open up and you let him be our source
[1:33:11] it'll displace worry in our life it'll
[1:33:14] be like a that those handfuls of ice
[1:33:16] cubes coming down in that cup and the
[1:33:18] water just going out and pretty soon
[1:33:19] when I hand you the cup you say well
[1:33:21] there's only a little bit of water in
[1:33:22] here well why is that because the ice
[1:33:25] cubes have displaced it oh I pray to God
[1:33:28] that there be such a such a filling of
[1:33:31] the love of God move down our life Lord
[1:33:34] displace every fear every worry every
[1:33:37] doubt every concern let it come down
[1:33:39] lord God and displace all of my
[1:33:43] worry you love him
[1:33:46] tonight the world goes to many different
[1:33:49] resources to let off their worry matter
[1:33:52] of fact the world drowns it right
[1:33:54] they'll go they'll spend money that they
[1:33:56] don't even have they'll go down and
[1:33:58] they'll do things to themselves and
[1:34:00] their bodies and they got to wake up
[1:34:01] tomorrow morning and face the same exact
[1:34:04] things right but there's a place you see
[1:34:08] as as I was telling the young people
[1:34:10] there on Friday we're not exempt brother
[1:34:11] Bram says pressure makes the good act
[1:34:14] this way makes the bad act this way
[1:34:15] makes the rich act this way makes the
[1:34:17] wrong act this way pressure itself he
[1:34:19] says it'll cause us to act out if things
[1:34:21] that we have to go and say forgive me I
[1:34:23] I didn't mean to say it that way what is
[1:34:25] it it's pressure but there is a place
[1:34:29] that you and I have access to and if
[1:34:32] you've never found him and let him
[1:34:34] become your place of Refuge to where
[1:34:36] that the worries about what are people
[1:34:38] going to think about me what is this
[1:34:40] going to be where you can come to have a
[1:34:42] place in Christ you've got a place to
[1:34:45] let off the pressure a place to where
[1:34:48] everything is settled it doesn't mean
[1:34:49] that we know what tomorrow holds and and
[1:34:51] this is going to happen and that that's
[1:34:53] that's not it that's not what faith is
[1:34:55] Faith is trusting God faith is
[1:35:00] now right now this is God's will for the
[1:35:03] moment I'm just going to abide in this
[1:35:05] moment and when the next step is shown
[1:35:07] I'll step there faith is now I'll stand
[1:35:10] there and I going to keep standing and
[1:35:12] I'm going to keep walking in his
[1:35:15] promises you don't you to love him yes

[1:49:23] glad I'm so glad to be in this city of

[1:49:30] the Lord so glad to be dwelling here
[1:49:34] Lord since you got a hold of my life I
[1:49:36] know there's other believers standing
[1:49:38] here tonight can testify of it that
[1:49:40] coming into this City of Refuge I don't
[1:49:43] I've never wanted to
[1:49:45] leave everything that I have need of all
[1:49:48] that I ever wanted that I did didn't
[1:49:50] even know how to put words to you're
[1:49:52] everything to me Lord It's not that
[1:49:54] pressures don't come our way but we've
[1:49:57] got a place in you
[1:50:00] Lord where we can let off the pressure
[1:50:02] you Lord Jesus how we thank you Father
[1:50:05] for your
[1:50:06] mercy I pray that if there's one Lord
[1:50:09] that's not experienced that
[1:50:12] release May they Lord recognize tonight
[1:50:16] there is a place of release for them
[1:50:19] Lord where they don't have to carry
[1:50:21] around the load of sin they don't have
[1:50:24] to look over their back but God they can
[1:50:27] stand in a
[1:50:29] place where the grace of God moves down
[1:50:32] and begins to lift all the burdens of
[1:50:36] sin to begin to lift all the
[1:50:40] condemnation and begin to
[1:50:42] reveal in a more greater way who they
[1:50:45] are always were as a son and daughter of
[1:50:48] God lord Jesus
[1:50:51] no wonder your Prophet could say when a
[1:50:52] man or woman has been born again by the
[1:50:54] spirit of God and he would say this as
[1:50:57] he was holding a little baby dedicating
[1:50:59] it at the altar he said when we have
[1:51:03] been born again we are more innocent
[1:51:07] than one of these
[1:51:09] babies that's the power of the blood of
[1:51:12] Jesus Christ being applied in her
[1:51:16] lifeall it brings back and reveals
[1:51:21] innocency it reveals Lord and the
[1:51:23] pressure is let off how thankful we are
[1:51:26] for it Lord I pray that God May there
[1:51:28] not be one Lord that would leave out if
[1:51:30] there's a worry and they're worried
[1:51:31] about tomorrow worried about this
[1:51:33] worried about that Lord may they valuate
[1:51:36] if they're not in you where they need to
[1:51:37] be then they should be worried but
[1:51:39] worried Lord and a concern to say Lord I
[1:51:43] want every part of my life even my big
[1:51:46] toe I wanted under the blood nothing out
[1:51:49] outside of the blood because under the
[1:51:52] blood it's
[1:51:54] safety it's safety like your Prophet
[1:51:56] said that howling of that Death Angel
[1:51:58] could come through there and he said
[1:52:00] that little boy would look up at his
[1:52:01] daddy and say daddy is it going to be
[1:52:03] all right yes son it's fine because we
[1:52:07] have done what Jehovah told us to do we
[1:52:11] have applied the blood but daddy I'm
[1:52:14] your firstborn ain't I yeah but but
[1:52:16] didn't it say that he was coming for the
[1:52:19] firstborn that's true my son but there
[1:52:22] is one you see that blood Hallelujah

[1:52:29] place so that you might live and go free

[1:52:35] house the Lamb's blood speaks
