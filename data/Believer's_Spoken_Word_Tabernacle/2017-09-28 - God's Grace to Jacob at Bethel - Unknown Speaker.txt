[Music] [Music] [Applause] glory be to God Alleluia amen are you thankful for that amen truly it is a song when God has done a a work in our life there's a song Amen that echoes from forth from our lives it's a song of victory you think of the scripture when it says in the Book of Psalms and then the inspiration of God moves upon Paul to write of where it speaks of the Lord Jesus said behold I stand in the midst of the church and declare my name unto my brother Amen not that word of declaration Aires a there is a hymn that is being sung and in the old times the way that as they write the scripture it was aware that there was a great victory that had been won then there was a song that went forth Amen hail to the mighty Conqueror amen and you know what it's not something that we're reading about our lives are the witness of it amen our lives declare indeed that he is the mighty Conqueror amen so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight we just want to look to the word of the Lord just look to God that he'll cos come and just speak to our hearts in a very special way tonight amen let's just go to him in a word of Prayer you got a need on your heart just put it there before him tonight know that God is mindful that God okay I could come right by and he he knows your thoughts he knows exactly what you have need of in your life he knows just how to say it so that you and I would get it and speak to the depths of our needs tonight he's that he's that kind of a god he's that caring is that mindful Lord Jesus Lord we just desire Lord here in these few moments that we have together Lord even in this time we've come to worship you and Lord we know that that time of worship it doesn't it doesn't cease Lord but father right through the word this is Lord kindly oh my our hearts Lord just it just moves to a to a higher level Lord because Lord is truly Lord as that word is coming forth Lord you would speak to our hearts Lord that's where we find Lord Jesus just joy and strengthen the encouragement and refreshing Lord from your presence Lord we pray tonight that you would just come Lord right down among this woman and Lord as we've sung the song tonight Lord and with needs upon hearts and lives Lord you know you know the words Lord you know Lord the questions you know every situation so Lord we just pray that you come tonight Lord I just want to get out of the way Lord the people here tonight Lord my brothers and sisters they want to get out of the way Lord so father we come together to submit ourselves Lord into your hands Lord for you're working here in our midst Lord that you might be glorified and minister to every life and every heart Lord we pray father Lord we just look to you now Lord we ask that you would have your way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Genesis 28 if we could we certainly covet your prayers for the that men's meeting that is coming up and just ask you would just keep us in prayer the Lord would just guide us and just direct us and brother John la Fontaine will be here on Sunday to minister the word of the Lord so we always just appreciate having brother John here with us amen verse 10 of Genesis 28 Jacob went out of there Sheba and went toward Iran and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the son was sent and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land were on thou liest to thee will I give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed and behold I'm with thee and will keep thee in all places whether thou goest and we'll bring the again into this land or I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to the Amen what a blessed consolation amen god bless you tonight as you're being seated thank god just bless the reading of the word I'd like just to speak to you just open up a little bit on a little thought God's grace to Jacob at Bethel and I want to just look over some things here that just was really just inspiring to my heart you find that how that that Jacob here when he is directed and sent forth by by his dad in that in the beginning part of Genesis 28 find that how that in the midst of it that you know there are things that that are set forth that's pretty clear when you you look at that in in Genesis 28 and verse 2 and how that Isaac tells Jacob where to go arise and go to Madonna rom to the house of Bethel thy mother's father and take the ax wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother there are things that God has written in his word he's already laid out a pattern and God is one he doesn't change patterns his pattern ever remains the same we we know there are things that God will will change and it becomes magnified from the old into the new but when you look at how that Isaac is is aware of this and we know that his mother has heard about Esau 'ls intention to to take his life but yet how that Rebekah you know has spoke to him go go to the land where my brother is out and Iran and take the wife she speaks to Jacob and Jacob gives him a charge and a commission these are not just words but it's God that is watching over Jacobs life and so when we look at it Isaac you know see Isaac is not just telling something that he's just read about but Isaac himself is giving of the experience of his own life because for him his bride his wife Jacob and Esau his mother Rebecca did not come from the land around there but she came from the land of of the kindred of the the kinfolk and so we find that this pattern you know you find that many times in God's Word sometimes we are we look for answers sometimes and we look right over the very things that God has right within his word because we find that that God has had a pattern and Isaac is letting this pattern Isaac's taking the word and he's guiding and his correcting Jacob on where to go and where to take a wife from and we find that when here Isaac the scripture lets us know of how that Isaac he sent Jacob away and you think of it how that here Jacob is sent away by Isaac and he goes away from the land where where he's been raised their land where he's been born and everything but now he's to journey back to the land of Haran and no doubt when you would think about that for a moment that was a great sacrifice that was a great price that was being asked of him to leave where he had always known but you know that's the same pattern that's been all the way down through the scriptures that God will require a separation and the separation that God will require is that everything that we hold dear to ourselves there can't be anything that can be placed before the Lord if the Lord Jesus said it very clear he said if a man is not willing to forsake father mother houses lands and other things he's not even worthy to be called my disciple so the Word of God demands a complete separation but when it demands or calls for that complete separation God is doing that to bring really the separation isn't so much from all of the people as it is for that self part that self-denial that we you and I are able to walk away and there's nothing else in our life that we desire more than what God is speaking to us and I believe that with all my heart that God in every age God has always any expects us to separate from everything that we hold dear in our life and if there's anything at all that we love more than him then we're not worthy to be his disciples we're tested on that you know friends that don't just stop we're testing on that if we will love our feeling if we will love our thoughts more than the Word of God but we've got to cast down all reasoning it requires us to make a stand many times against our own feelings about things and stand for the word of God but you with in at all the reward itself far exceeds the request bury the reward and the requester there's not even anything that's comparable the reward Farley far LC exceeds it find that how that remember Peter you know Peter and them were asking you know seeing that we have forsaken all we have left all and followed be in mark 10:28 I like how it reads it like this jesus answered and said verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands from my sake and the gospel's but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions my everything was going good until that latter part he shall receive with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life amen now look how the Prophet lays this out here when we we think of it Abraham he says in the message reproached for calls of the word Abraham the very word Abram means father of many and make him a father of Nations and Abraham heard the word of God Abram was a prophet and he heard the word of God and we admire Abraham for his holding to God's Word how that he separated himself from his kin folks how hard it was for Abraham he was brought up there now what's for the rain I'm dealing with the soul realm no he's talking about the spirit realm how hard it was for Abraham he was brought up there he come down from Babel was down there in the land of Shinar the Chaldeans in the city of Ur where all of his associates people and those he went to church with and everything but God said separate yourself what a horrible thing that was to leave all that he held dear everything that was real to him that he held dear and God told him separates yourself so it wasn't something that was it wasn't easy but everything that was real to him everything that was precious to Abraham God is calling him out of his comfort zone oh my oh my god is moving to Koli you know when you remember in the scriptures where it speaks in thee and the scriptures where God has has now come among the church and he's poured out of his spirit and the Bible says of how that they they sold what they had and and they brought it and laid it at the Apostles feet and the Bible says they had all things in common you know God's desire within I remember how many would look at that and say oh they made such a great mistake they had nowhere else to go but he wasn't a mistake God did not want you to become a communal thing where it becomes something of us for and no more where it becomes to where that it's just a focus about us and the focus isn't upon the Word of God and the gospel being spread God knows exactly what he's doing with the places that he places you and I you and I sometimes don't understand the ways that God would call in direct across no pathways and I don't want to say just sometimes we don't understand we don't know the fullness it's not things that you and I can't even figure out and make sense I've been many times it's later on down the Ray that you and I can look back and say Lord I see now why that you led me this way why you guided me this direction but in the time it just doesn't make sense but that is where faith comes in please can't explain faith in us and the faith understands faith simply trusts this is what he has said now notice how the Prophet will lay this out in power transformation he said see whatever it is that's what we want I believe it was David that said I'd rather be a doorman at the house of the Lord than to dwell in the tents with the wicked you see no matter what it is take my place sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you to take your position that God has called you to he says I'm sure you can read between the lines when I'm saying sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them and just take your position in Christ to where God has called you but what is God doing transforming you from what you are
