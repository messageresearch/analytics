[45:37] Lord in Jesus name
[45:40] amen and amen
[45:43] I want to as as preparing to turn in the
[45:46] word I want to go into the scriptures
[45:49] into Ecclesiastes
[45:51] chapter 8. and uh
[45:54] I want to just also mention
[45:58] um
[45:59] our sister Charlene she's going to be
[46:02] leaving here right after the service and
[46:04] heading back to
[46:06] South Africa so we just want to say God
[46:08] bless you we miss you
[46:11] men and we look for your return
[46:13] [Applause]
[46:17] things at times do not go maybe as we
[46:20] have planned but we know that if we can
[46:22] just say God what my plans are but you
[46:25] have plans and I give myself to your
[46:27] plans
[46:28] amen because God's plans we we might be
[46:31] disappointed in our own selves and this
[46:33] is for every one of us but we can when
[46:35] it all is said and done we can look back
[46:37] and say God how I'm so thankful that
[46:39] your plans were at work
[46:41] amen aren't you glad
[46:44] amen I also want to remind her this is
[46:47] uh
[46:48] brother George Smith will be here this
[46:50] coming Thursday
[46:52] to minister to us and we want to just
[46:55] remember that I also wanted to kind of
[46:57] clarify a point about
[46:59] um with the meetings next weekend with
[47:01] brother Wayne Lawson coming in
[47:04] um I really don't think I we should have
[47:06] to clarify this by now but let me just
[47:08] try to settle it so it'll be done for
[47:10] the future anytime there is a youth
[47:12] meeting
[47:13] let me just say it like this even if I'm
[47:16] not the pastor I'm going to be here
[47:21] I can walk down through here and say
[47:23] that
[47:24] you say brother Sammy but you're not a
[47:25] young person but I'm here pulling for
[47:28] him
[47:30] I'm here pulling for him and I
[47:31] understand if you've got a job or you've
[47:33] got something but I when I'm I'm coming
[47:36] here I'm coming here pulling for them
[47:39] and I also know God is here to meet all
[47:42] of our needs
[47:43] but I look at it like this to me you say
[47:46] Where's that in the scripture well
[47:48] David when he came up next to the battle
[47:50] before he ever put the slingshot in his
[47:52] hand the Bible said he shouted for the
[47:55] battle
[47:57] that's what the Bible said he shouted
[47:58] for the battle because David what David
[48:00] was looking at David did not even see
[48:03] the fear that was in the camp of Israel
[48:05] people who were ordained to be Covenant
[48:08] people that God himself in the midst of
[48:12] Israel that there wasn't a devil that
[48:13] could stand in their way
[48:15] because of God and that's what David was
[48:18] looking at when he shouted for the
[48:20] battle
[48:21] then as David got in there and he got to
[48:23] recognize
[48:24] these people are paralyzed with fear
[48:29] but David was a channel that welcomed
[48:31] God back in the camp
[48:33] David became a channel in that moment
[48:35] that when there was fear and there was
[48:37] doubt he became a channel that the
[48:39] supernatural could drop down
[48:41] and take that big giant that all the
[48:43] rest of them are looking at and
[48:44] trembling and and they didn't have the
[48:47] armor and David went out there and David
[48:48] said I'm not coming to you
[48:51] in my name all right I am coming against
[48:54] you in the name of the Lord God of
[48:58] Israel
[49:01] that's how I'm meeting you and this is
[49:02] how we meet every devil in the name of
[49:05] Jesus Christ for at the name of Jesus
[49:08] Christ every devil has to bow
[49:11] amen and remember the Bible says his
[49:14] name is called the word of God
[49:19] so when his word is being preached
[49:21] that's his name being magnified
[49:23] glory be to God
[49:26] so is that clear yes
[49:29] yes we want to pull on the gift of God
[49:32] there are needs that are here Among Us
[49:38] all of us
[49:39] and with with the young people this is I
[49:42] said to you you may not understand it
[49:44] but you know it's a burden that God had
[49:46] put on my heart for a few years because
[49:49] I see a need not just here I see a need
[49:52] in this area
[49:53] and God put that on my heart and that's
[49:55] why that's why that I'm doing it the
[49:57] pastor's around that I've contacted
[50:00] we've already I've already let that be
[50:02] communicated and they're here to support
[50:04] it and so with their young people as
[50:07] well so we just want to get behind what
[50:09] God's doing
[50:10] is that right that's what I want to do I
[50:13] want to get behind what God's doing this
