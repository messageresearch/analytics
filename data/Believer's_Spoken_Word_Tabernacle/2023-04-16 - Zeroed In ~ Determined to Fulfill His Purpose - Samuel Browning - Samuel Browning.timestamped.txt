[46:03] Timothy
[46:05] chapter 1 and verse 7.
[46:08] each and every one of you
[46:10] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[46:12] it's so good to be together this morning
[46:16] it's good to be in his presence
[46:20] amen
[46:21] it's just so precious because of what
[46:26] the Lord
[46:28] will do Among Us in his presence
[46:32] things that many times that we are not
[46:35] even aware that God is doing while we're
[46:37] in his presence
[46:39] but it's just we know that
[46:42] he's moving
[46:43] and I just want to I just want my heart
[46:45] I want my spirit I want my mind if
[46:47] there's any thought if there's anything
[46:49] that's in anything else I want to just
[46:51] lay it aside amen and I just want to
[46:54] move
[46:54] with his presence
[46:57] amen
[46:58] second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7.
[47:04] scripture said for God
[47:06] hath not given us the spirit of fear
[47:10] but of power
[47:12] and of love
[47:13] and of a sound mind
[47:17] be not therefore ashamed of the
[47:20] testimony of Our Lord nor of me his
[47:23] prisoner
[47:24] but be thou a partaker of the
[47:26] afflictions of The Gospel According to
[47:30] the power of God
[47:32] who hath saved us
[47:34] and called us with an holy calling not
[47:39] according to our works
[47:41] but according
[47:43] to his own purpose and Grace
[47:47] I really just want to lay on to that
[47:49] it's according to his own purpose and
[47:53] Grace
[47:55] brother Samuel I really wanted to be
[47:57] saved the only thing that could have put
[47:59] that desire in you is that was in you
[48:04] that was in you there was a longing for
[48:07] God
[48:08] and you didn't put that in you God
[48:11] didn't put that in you
[48:12] and there's nothing else that can truly
[48:15] satisfy that outside of getting fully in
[48:19] his presence
[48:21] amen but according to his own purpose
[48:24] and Grace which was given us in Christ
[48:29] Jesus before the world began
[48:33] but is now
[48:34] made manifest by the appearing of Our
[48:39] Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished
[48:42] death and hath brought life and
[48:44] immortality to light through the gospel
[48:47] whereunto I am appointed a preacher an
[48:51] apostle
[48:52] and a teacher of the Gentile so if
[48:54] you'll notice Paul in verse 11 he just
[48:56] he wasn't saying I've chose this
[48:58] occupation I've chose to do what I'm
[49:01] doing but Paul is saying because of what
[49:04] he has done
[49:06] how he has come by my way then he has
[49:11] called me to this
[49:15] amen this has all been unfolded amen may
[49:19] God bless you bless the reading of the
[49:21] word as you're being seated
[49:23] I want to just
[49:26] dwell here upon this thought here this
[49:30] morning and
[49:31] we'll just see how the Lord will just
[49:33] take it
[49:36] but I'm again looking at these
[49:37] scriptures even from last week when we
[49:39] were dealing with the quickening power
[49:41] and there's certain things I want to get
[49:42] to with a quickening power that I I know
[49:45] there's no way in the world I'll get to
[49:46] it today and maybe even maybe a few
[49:48] weeks down the road
[49:50] but I want to take this thought here
[49:52] upon this
[49:54] because when you think of the quickening
[49:56] power of God
[49:58] remember how brother Brown says it did
[50:00] not just come and Quicken their spirits
[50:03] but it quickened the mechanics which was
[50:06] that seed that word on the inside that
[50:10] makes the word live out through our
[50:13] lives because
[50:15] um it could have it could come upon the
[50:18] spirit but it can leave and there's no
[50:21] anchor there's no typos there's no
[50:23] conversion when it just comes upon the
[50:26] spirit
[50:26] but when it comes upon that of the soul
[50:29] and there is a seed of life there by
[50:33] virtue of his of the predestinated plan
[50:36] of God it will Express
[50:39] God in this hour
[50:42] and I want to just deal with this
[50:45] thought here on zeroed in
[50:48] determined to fulfill his purpose
[50:54] says it like this and the message
[50:56] absolute
[50:57] he says he had a purpose
[51:01] in Saving me
[51:03] see God God is a god of purpose
[51:09] God doesn't even call this meeting here
[51:11] together just to take up time in our
[51:14] week
[51:16] God hasn't called this just to occupy a
[51:19] certain and give us something to do or
[51:22] even to make us feel
[51:24] good
[51:26] that's not the purpose of it
[51:29] he had a purpose in Saving me he had a
[51:32] purpose in Saving you and I am
[51:35] determined by his will that's key
[51:39] I am determined not by my own will but
[51:42] by his will
[51:45] to do it
[51:46] not to add to it or take away from it
[51:51] and your brother Brian goes on he says
[51:52] I'm so determined just to remain with
[51:54] this gospel as long as I live by the
[51:56] help of God
[51:58] and here is Grace there were Millions
[52:01] dying in sin when he saved me who was I
[52:05] that he should say
[52:07] he had a purpose saving me and I'm
[52:11] determined to carry out that purpose
[52:15] he says I don't care it might be my end
[52:17] maybe pretty soon now but whatever it is
[52:19] I'm still anchored never changed it
[52:23] it goes on very similar statement in
[52:26] another message of the absolute
[52:29] but I want to read how he says it here
[52:31] as well he had a purpose in Saving me he
[52:34] had a purpose in Saving you and I am
[52:38] determined by his will to do his will
[52:45] remember what the will of God is the
[52:48] will of God
[52:50] is to be filled with the spirit of God
[52:54] the will of God is that his life would
[52:57] be on display
[52:59] through him by a real born-again
[53:01] experience and we understand just in
[53:03] that phrase just in that term born again
[53:06] it's not the same life continuing on but
[53:09] it is a new life
[53:12] that's why we say a new birth because
[53:16] it's not the old man reformed it's a new
[53:21] creation
[53:24] amen created in Christ Jesus unto good
[53:27] works I am determined by his will
[53:31] to do his will
[53:33] and that's the reason he done it and I
[53:35] don't know why he done it
[53:38] Hallelujah
[53:40] not to add to it or take from it as I
[53:43] recorded he said or said in Revelations
[53:45] 22 19
[53:46] he said don't do it if he is our
[53:49] absolute it cannot be otherwise there's
[53:53] no way for it to be otherwise he has got
[53:56] to be the absolute the last word
[54:01] and so when we when we see this not to
[54:05] add to or to take from I want to say
[54:07] this and just to drop this to start here
[54:10] this morning when we talk about a
[54:13] purpose the scriptures tell us that
[54:15] everything for everything there is a
[54:19] season
[54:20] and a time to every purpose under heaven
[54:24] and the purpose that we are in right now
[54:28] in this hour the anointing that is upon
[54:32] the Church of the Living God in this
[54:35] hour is the anointing of the eagle that
[54:39] characteristic is is reflected in the
[54:43] anointing of the Holy Spirit coming upon
[54:46] the people of God
[54:48] so it is a power that is moving that is
[54:53] lifting a people from the cares of this
[54:57] world
[54:58] it is an anointing that is moving and
[55:02] directing our thoughts from Earthly
[55:05] things to Heavenly things
[55:08] it is an anointing that is bringing a
[55:12] faith in our life to believe things that
[55:15] reasoning says it's impossible that your
[55:19] own mind cannot even be able to make
[55:22] sense of but it is that which is
[55:25] surrendered and it's God moving in a way
[55:28] by the anointing upon the word of God
[55:31] that there is a people that are standing
[55:34] like Abraham when Abraham was there in
[55:38] Genesis 22 and I know we speak of
[55:41] Genesis 22 and we say that was a type of
[55:44] Calvary and so it was but it was also
[55:47] remember what God did in the groom it
[55:50] was a testimony of what he was going to
[55:52] do in the bride that there would be a
[55:55] Seed of Abraham a royal seed that was
[55:59] included in the promise that would come
[56:01] to a place of maturity in Christ that
[56:05] they would be willing to lay down
[56:08] everything
[56:10] everything and walk with the promise of
[56:13] God and that's a people that's ordained
[56:16] for this hour that's a people that's
[56:19] walking in perfect Faith that's a people
[56:23] that's in position for perfect Faith to
[56:25] move into this is a people that is
[56:28] ordained for the ram himself to appear
[56:34] we're living in that moment we're living
[56:36] in this hour in this time
[56:39] and I say as a Believer down Through the
[56:43] Ages that has served the purpose of God
[56:46] because if they were a Believer what
[56:49] designated somebody as a believer
[56:51] because they said they believed May
[56:54] but it was because they served the
[56:57] purpose of God
[56:59] is that right how could they have served
[57:01] God's purpose without God revealing
[57:04] himself to them
[57:07] right
[57:09] I mean you know how it is sometimes when
[57:11] you try to either sisters you bake
[57:13] something new or brothers you're trying
[57:15] to work on something new uh you look for
[57:19] certain things so that you're not
[57:20] necessarily staggering around
[57:24] you want to have a certainty about what
[57:26] you're doing
[57:28] and to think that within this God
[57:30] himself God Alone is the one who brings
[57:35] certainty in the life of the believer
[57:39] to where our life walks with a certainty
[57:42] it's not a in other words it's not a
[57:45] certainty that's between me and my daddy
[57:47] me and my mama me and my wife or my wife
[57:50] and my heart it's not it's a certainty
[57:52] that's between me and God that if nobody
[57:55] else no matter what anybody else that
[57:58] there is a certainty in your walk with
[58:00] God that I've met God I know God and God
[58:03] is in control
[58:06] that's what God intended that it would
[58:09] be that personal in our lives
[58:12] and every purpose of God is served the
[58:16] believer serves the purpose of God in
[58:18] the season in time of his revealing
[58:21] that's what brings the certainty and
[58:24] they manifest the promise of that age in
[58:26] the days of Luther they manifested that
[58:29] of justification
[58:31] they live free from that Creed that
[58:34] Dogma that tradition of uh you got to be
[58:37] saved you got to belong to the church to
[58:39] be saved but an anointing of the spirit
[58:41] of God Came Upon Luther and when he
[58:44] nailed those 99 theses through the door
[58:47] let me tell you something one he was
[58:49] nailing to the door God had already
[58:52] nailed or made real in his life and the
[58:56] people in that hour lived the just shall
[59:00] live by faith they manifested that how
[59:02] did they manifest it by the anointing
[59:05] that was set forth for the hour the man
[59:09] anointing coming upon them that
[59:11] characteristic of the spirit of God and
[59:14] they like brother Ram tells us in the
[59:15] fifth seal they could not help but
[59:18] respond the way they did to the
[59:21] anointing
[59:22] many felt the anointing but it mattered
[59:25] what was in them was there something
[59:28] there to respond to be quickened to
[59:32] respond to the anointing of the hour
[59:36] so I will say this we are ordained in
[59:40] this season
[59:41] to the time of completion
[59:43] this is Harvest Time
[59:45] this is the time where the mystery of
[59:47] God should be finished
[59:50] this is the season of rapture this is
[59:54] what the Church of the Living God has
[59:56] looked forward to and if I can even say
[59:58] it this is what the prophets of the Old
[1:00:01] Testament have looked forward to
[1:00:04] the whole Bible is pointing and written
[1:00:08] and is declared for this hour
[1:00:12] that's right it's that's why in The
[1:00:16] Taking of the book and the loosening of
[1:00:18] the seals it is releasing this to the
[1:00:21] believer that we can look in here and by
[1:00:24] the spirit of God making these promises
[1:00:27] alive to us to the believer it brings
[1:00:30] faith in our hearts it brings faith in
[1:00:33] our life it produces a faith walk
[1:00:37] thank you Jesus and I'm going to say the
[1:00:40] purpose that we are in is rapture
[1:00:44] [Applause]
[1:00:47] purpose we're in for this hour that's
[1:00:50] what everything is is about that's what
[1:00:53] every decision this I'm talking about
[1:00:54] personal decision every decision is
[1:00:58] about Rapture it should be
[1:01:01] the purpose is Rapture and it's not
[1:01:04] Rapture in terms of a coming event but
[1:01:08] the Rapture is on now
[1:01:12] are you with me at the opening of the
[1:01:15] seventh seal Christ coming down and
[1:01:18] descending it is the releasing of the
[1:01:21] anointing for the Rapture upon the body
[1:01:24] of Jesus Christ and that anointing is
[1:01:27] the token is the Holy Ghost in his
[1:01:29] fullness it is the abstract to the title
[1:01:32] deed it is Christ himself he's the one
[1:01:34] that's announcing you if not a man a man
[1:01:37] was only the microphone that the mighty
[1:01:40] Angel announced the Rapture is on
[1:01:45] and that must be a manifestation in our
[1:01:48] life it's not a catching away of our
[1:01:50] mind where we can repeat quotes but it's
[1:01:53] a catching away where our soul on the
[1:01:56] inside has been caught away from the
[1:01:59] hold of the devil
[1:02:01] we're aware of authority as come and
[1:02:04] said take your hands off of him
[1:02:08] [Applause]
[1:02:10] brother Samuel you don't know my life
[1:02:11] let me tell you something the prophecy
[1:02:14] when Jesus rode into Jerusalem he was
[1:02:16] speaking even of his return in this last
[1:02:19] day he rode on the fold of an ass
[1:02:23] one that could be redeemed
[1:02:27] Hallelujah he wrote in in power how is
[1:02:30] he coming in power he's writing in in
[1:02:33] the lives and hearts of his people
[1:02:36] Hallelujah
[1:02:41] oh Lord
[1:02:43] let my will let my attitude let my
[1:02:46] thoughts let my all be like the Palm
[1:02:49] leaves that are laid down for you to
[1:02:51] move upon
[1:02:57] now I want to deal with this
[1:03:00] zeroed in and determined to fulfill his
[1:03:02] purpose
[1:03:03] because it's according
[1:03:06] to his purpose
[1:03:08] that we are saved and called
[1:03:12] it was not us seeking after God
[1:03:15] it was God who came seeking for us
[1:03:18] the son of man is come to seek and save
[1:03:22] that which was lost
[1:03:26] right just like when you have something
[1:03:28] that you hey Hey where's this at where's
[1:03:30] this at where's that at and where's this
[1:03:31] at my keys where's this at where's this
[1:03:33] at what they belong to you you're
[1:03:36] looking for what is lost
[1:03:39] right so the son of man
[1:03:42] the ministry of the son of man is to
[1:03:44] seek and save what is lost
[1:03:48] what you think of this here this morning
[1:03:50] his purpose in Romans 8 28.
[1:03:54] and we know that all things work
[1:03:57] together for good to them that love God
[1:04:02] and that's key you didn't say everything
[1:04:04] was good
[1:04:06] but it worked together
[1:04:09] for the good to them that what love God
[1:04:12] that's the key to them who are the
[1:04:16] called
[1:04:17] according to his purpose
[1:04:20] somebody say his purpose
[1:04:22] according to his purpose Ephesians 1 7
[1:04:26] in whom we have Redemption through his
[1:04:30] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:04:33] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[1:04:36] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[1:04:39] and proven so it's God unfolding himself
[1:04:42] to you and I verse 9 having made known
[1:04:46] let me just pause for a minute that
[1:04:48] unfolding to you or I is not a teaching
[1:04:50] it's a person being revealed
[1:04:54] I want to just make that clear it's not
[1:04:56] a teaching it's a person being revealed
[1:04:59] he is abounding toward us
[1:05:02] it's not a teaching it's a person that's
[1:05:05] being unfolded and being revealed
[1:05:08] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:05:13] his will
[1:05:15] I tell you friends that's a blessing
[1:05:17] because that in itself in verse 9 it it
[1:05:20] relieves us of our uh our stravings and
[1:05:26] laborings it brings it's an opening to
[1:05:30] the real rest of almighty God he reveals
[1:05:34] the mystery of his will so it's not me
[1:05:37] by my will trying to do his will
[1:05:40] [Music]
[1:05:41] are you with me
[1:05:43] Cain was a will worshiper
[1:05:47] he worshiped God by his own will
[1:05:52] but Abel worshiped God by God's will
[1:05:56] through his surrendered will
[1:05:59] that's why Paul can say in the book of
[1:06:02] Colossians that many in the how that
[1:06:04] they worship it is will worship they're
[1:06:08] willing something to God willing that
[1:06:10] God would receive something but that is
[1:06:13] not God's program God's program his will
[1:06:17] is that he would be the one that on the
[1:06:20] inside of us through a surrendered will
[1:06:23] think of it calvary how did Calvary come
[1:06:26] about nevertheless not my will thine
[1:06:30] will be done
[1:06:32] and that made a way for you and I to
[1:06:35] come to a place that we could surrender
[1:06:38] our will
[1:06:40] that his will might come fully in
[1:06:43] and that surrendering goes on
[1:06:45] notice the mystery of his will according
[1:06:48] to his good pleasure
[1:06:50] which he hath purposed in himself
[1:06:55] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:06:57] of times this is where we're at he might
[1:06:59] gather together in one all things in
[1:07:02] Christ both which are in heaven and
[1:07:04] which are on earth even in him right
[1:07:09] amen no now in which he hath purposed in
[1:07:13] verse 9 according to his good pleasure
[1:07:14] which he hath purposed in himself and
[1:07:16] that word purpose it deals with
[1:07:19] something that is placed before or set
[1:07:22] before or set forth in other words it's
[1:07:26] something that can be looked at it's
[1:07:28] exposed to view it's to come into a
[1:07:32] public view like that and this is I love
[1:07:35] this this is how it uses it here in this
[1:07:37] Greek word it uses it as like a body of
[1:07:40] one who is dead lies in state
[1:07:44] now follow me now
[1:07:46] brother Adam tells us in choosing of a
[1:07:49] bride he talks about when that love of
[1:07:51] God Is So struck the inner part of our
[1:07:54] life by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:56] what is it it's a dead man a life that
[1:08:00] is died to self but is alive to Christ
[1:08:03] and that's right brother Brown said you
[1:08:05] ever trying to do anything to a dead
[1:08:07] person
[1:08:09] you need to do anything to a dead person
[1:08:12] I say God help me to stay so dead to
[1:08:15] myself
[1:08:16] dead to my will
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:21] oh my so it's a purpose didn't know he
[1:08:24] purposed god Set this forth now let me
[1:08:27] hone in on this God set this purpose
[1:08:29] that he purposed in himself god Set this
[1:08:33] purpose forth as Paul said through the
[1:08:36] appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ God
[1:08:39] set it forth that he might dwell in man
[1:08:42] and have the preeminence the first place
[1:08:45] in man God and man were reconciled that
[1:08:49] then through that reconciliation God
[1:08:52] might reconcile the many sons and
[1:08:56] daughters that were already here
[1:08:59] are you hearing me the purpose God's
[1:09:02] purpose God's desire has always been to
[1:09:05] share
[1:09:06] eternal life with man
[1:09:08] when man fell he separated himself
[1:09:11] Listen by disbelieving the word of God
[1:09:13] he separated himself from eternal life
[1:09:17] is that right by disbelieving the word
[1:09:20] he forsook that of eternal life and so
[1:09:23] the only way that life itself the Tree
[1:09:25] of Life the only way man could ever come
[1:09:28] back to a place of being a partaker of
[1:09:31] eternal life it would have to be no
[1:09:34] other way outside of God himself
[1:09:37] manifesting himself in flesh
[1:09:42] and then for that then the purpose of
[1:09:45] God it's not that the purpose of God was
[1:09:48] stalled but God's purpose now is
[1:09:51] unfolding in a place now of redemption
[1:09:54] and because to all the heart purpose
[1:09:56] brother Brown would call it the heart
[1:09:58] purpose of God what would we say the
[1:10:00] heart purpose well the heart purpose of
[1:10:02] anything is the main purpose and the
[1:10:06] Heart purpose the Eternal purpose was
[1:10:09] that God was going to take a bride of
[1:10:12] his own choosing
[1:10:14] is that right and to think God himself
[1:10:17] think about how God would make himself
[1:10:20] known to Moses God would reveal himself
[1:10:23] there even in that Pillar of Fire but
[1:10:26] God changed there and now you know God
[1:10:29] came and he uh that he might dwell in
[1:10:31] man he went into spirit that he might
[1:10:33] dwell in man and God in Jesus Christ it
[1:10:37] was God acting in a man what he really
[1:10:40] was
[1:10:42] you want to know what God was want to
[1:10:45] know what the purpose that he had in
[1:10:47] himself it was God acting in a man what
[1:10:51] he really was
[1:10:53] Jesus Christ was God acting in a man in
[1:10:57] a man that's what he was
[1:10:59] so in other words as we said it was not
[1:11:02] a teaching it was Christ himself being
[1:11:06] revealed God was revealed in and through
[1:11:10] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:13] not a portion not a part but this was a
[1:11:17] moment of redemption
[1:11:20] down through the Seven Ages like the
[1:11:22] seven colors of a rainbow it's been the
[1:11:25] seven portions it's been God revealing
[1:11:28] himself but in the end time is where he
[1:11:32] steps forward and God veiled himself
[1:11:37] in a life that was Sanctified to his
[1:11:39] purpose
[1:11:41] and what was that all about that purpose
[1:11:43] was not to highlight brother Branham
[1:11:45] that purpose was to reveal Jesus Christ
[1:11:48] and let you and I know Redemption is all
[1:11:51] this is what belongs to you
[1:11:55] that's what it was all about what
[1:11:56] belongs to you not just at a church
[1:11:59] service but what belongs to you in your
[1:12:01] everyday life and love it's a victory
[1:12:04] it's a freedom it's a liberty
[1:12:07] yeah
[1:12:09] Moses seen the shape of his body right
[1:12:13] oh man that was God's glory being
[1:12:16] revealed what about now
[1:12:19] what about now
[1:12:21] oh his ground rate being revealed
[1:12:24] remember presence of God being revealed
[1:12:27] in a many-membered body
[1:12:32] well I don't know that's so-and-so this
[1:12:35] so-and-so be careful discern the Lord's
[1:12:38] body
[1:12:41] are you hearing me now he was acting in
[1:12:44] a man then Jesus but now he is acting
[1:12:48] through man that he is chosen for this
[1:12:51] purpose
[1:12:57] his purpose
[1:12:59] somebody say his purpose
[1:13:02] Ephesians 1 11.
[1:13:05] in whom also
[1:13:06] we have obtained an inheritance being
[1:13:10] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:13:15] of him
[1:13:17] who worketh all things after the counsel
[1:13:21] of his own will praise God Hallelujah
[1:13:26] sometimes there's things and I
[1:13:28] understand there's times there's things
[1:13:30] that just feel so chaotic
[1:13:32] but let me just tell you something
[1:13:34] nothing is out of God's control
[1:13:38] that'll take a situation that somebody
[1:13:47] and turn it right around for his own
[1:13:50] Glory you say how can you say that
[1:13:51] because God's purpose cannot be defeated
[1:13:59] Hallelujah you can't stop God's purpose
[1:14:03] [Applause]
[1:14:05] Satan has tried over and over dumb devil
[1:14:09] you can't stop God's purpose
[1:14:14] you can't because if you can stop the
[1:14:16] purpose of God you can stop God
[1:14:23] and stop and defeat God's purpose
[1:14:28] I'd say when the Hebrew children were in
[1:14:30] the fiery furnace it looked like defeat
[1:14:32] was upon them but they were right where
[1:14:33] they needed to be
[1:14:36] that's right and just like me or you
[1:14:37] nobody would have signed up to go to the
[1:14:39] fair fiery furnace
[1:14:41] but God to prove that his purpose can't
[1:14:43] be defeated he anointed that King
[1:14:47] heeded seven times harder
[1:14:50] he would have done that he was the guy
[1:14:52] pacing the floor after they did it but
[1:14:54] why did they have him because the spirit
[1:14:56] that was there that got upon him to
[1:14:59] anoint it to hate it seven times hotter
[1:15:02] but God allowed that to be to prove one
[1:15:04] faith that you cannot destroy my purpose
[1:15:08] for men the men who threw him in there
[1:15:11] died
[1:15:13] but while they was in there God came to
[1:15:16] him
[1:15:20] let me tell you God ain't afraid of the
[1:15:22] place God ain't afraid of the fire god
[1:15:25] ain't afraid of the water God's Not
[1:15:27] Afraid of the test or trap or
[1:15:29] tribulation he's just as much God
[1:15:34] Hallelujah
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] Hallelujah
[1:15:42] and when they came out that fiery
[1:15:43] furnace
[1:15:45] the hair wasn't singed
[1:15:49] have that stuff when I light the grill
[1:15:53] I get curled up
[1:15:55] but the steak's worth it but
[1:15:59] then when the hair sensed
[1:16:02] the one their garment wanting sins let
[1:16:04] me tell you something they didn't have
[1:16:05] some flame retardant clothing on
[1:16:07] they weren't dressed down there in
[1:16:09] yellow suits with yellow hats
[1:16:11] they weren't walking around in tin foil
[1:16:13] like walking around a volcano they were
[1:16:16] enshrouded
[1:16:18] with the power of God because why they
[1:16:21] were walking
[1:16:22] in the will of God by his will
[1:16:26] they had a greater protection and
[1:16:28] fortification all around their life
[1:16:33] Paradox why wasn't their clothes burned
[1:16:36] but yet the ropes that held their hands
[1:16:39] was burned
[1:16:42] somebody
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:48] when they were bound to it how can that
[1:16:50] be burned and yet their clothing wasn't
[1:16:52] burned
[1:16:54] it's plain to me how they could come out
[1:16:56] of the furnace and not smell like they
[1:16:59] had been in a fire
[1:17:01] oh yeah
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:05] Glory Glory
[1:17:07] well you know sometimes the way they
[1:17:09] fight fire is with fire
[1:17:12] [Laughter]
[1:17:14] whoo
[1:17:16] in whom we have also obtained an
[1:17:19] inheritance being predestinated
[1:17:21] according to the purpose of him who
[1:17:23] worketh all things after the council
[1:17:25] of his own will that we should be to the
[1:17:28] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:17:31] Christ
[1:17:32] you know there's nobody that can display
[1:17:34] the attributes of God
[1:17:37] like you
[1:17:39] nobody can display that he's a savior
[1:17:41] unless you've been saved
[1:17:43] nobody can display he's a deliverer
[1:17:45] unless you've been delivered
[1:17:47] nobody can display he's a Shepherd
[1:17:49] unless he's your Shepherd
[1:17:51] see you were made to display his
[1:17:54] attributes oh my that's why we're not we
[1:17:57] were not made just to read about it but
[1:17:59] it was meant to be an expression a
[1:18:01] relationship that we were ordained to
[1:18:04] reveal and to manifest the attributes oh
[1:18:07] my I wish I could just leave her and
[1:18:09] preach on that a minute our life is to
[1:18:11] display those attributes and brother
[1:18:13] Brown said your purpose here is to
[1:18:16] worship God you cannot worship Him
[1:18:20] correctly until you worship Him in
[1:18:22] spirit and in truth
[1:18:24] now I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going
[1:18:26] somewhere now in Ephesians chapter 3
[1:18:28] verse 9.
[1:18:30] and Paul would announce this was the
[1:18:33] burden that God had put upon his heart
[1:18:36] to make all men see
[1:18:39] and like brother Ben will pick that up
[1:18:41] over and over again and Christ the
[1:18:42] mystery all men won't see
[1:18:45] now when Paul said to make all men sing
[1:18:47] it was not Paul trying to exert and put
[1:18:50] humanly efforts in it but it was Paul uh
[1:18:55] yielding his human his human will to
[1:18:58] God's will let me give an example when
[1:19:00] times got hard in the in in in the city
[1:19:02] of Corinth it was a wicked and bad City
[1:19:05] and Paul those times were hard and Paul
[1:19:08] said I think I'm going to take a hotel
[1:19:10] in another city
[1:19:11] because this is bad
[1:19:14] he was ready he had already faced
[1:19:16] resistance are you hearing me now he had
[1:19:18] already experienced resistance but God
[1:19:21] came to him that night and said hey wait
[1:19:23] a minute I want you to remain here
[1:19:26] because I have much people in this city
[1:19:33] Hallelujah so even in the midst of this
[1:19:37] right here there were those that were
[1:19:39] ordained to life that even when the
[1:19:42] circumstances looked Bleak remember it
[1:19:45] would not be Paul that was making them
[1:19:47] to see it it was God is God coming down
[1:19:51] that's why it's all Supernatural
[1:19:53] are you hearing me now you could have a
[1:19:55] Bible study a month or Sundays and
[1:19:57] listen friends I'm not against Bible
[1:19:59] studies I'm not against those things but
[1:20:01] sometimes all we all that is done is
[1:20:04] more educating than in getting to the
[1:20:06] real purpose now I know I don't put no
[1:20:09] time limits on God you know if people
[1:20:11] are willing to meet and things like that
[1:20:12] but you understand what I'm saying that
[1:20:14] if I say all this pointing to and should
[1:20:17] point to one thing it's got to be a
[1:20:19] supernatural work between God and his
[1:20:23] people
[1:20:24] a man listen as much as I would want as
[1:20:27] a daddy I can't place that in the
[1:20:29] children I can't place it as a pastor
[1:20:33] I could put my human efforts in it and
[1:20:36] put myself in a grave
[1:20:38] God don't want my human efforts you want
[1:20:40] a scripture on that not by power not by
[1:20:43] might but by my spirit say it the Lord
[1:20:47] there's only one thing that'll move
[1:20:49] unbelief and that's the spirit of
[1:20:52] almighty God the presence of God coming
[1:20:55] down
[1:20:56] my mind to make all men see what is the
[1:21:00] Fellowship of the mystery oh the mystery
[1:21:04] what is the mystery the mystery is God
[1:21:06] Christ in you the hope of glory to
[1:21:08] understand the part our part
[1:21:11] our share our participation
[1:21:14] notice from the beginning of the world
[1:21:17] who hath been a hidden God who created
[1:21:19] All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[1:21:21] that now unto the principalities and
[1:21:24] powers in Heavenly places might be known
[1:21:27] by the church the manifold wisdom of God
[1:21:31] according listen now to the Eternal
[1:21:35] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[1:21:37] Jesus our lord
[1:21:39] according to what the Eternal purpose
[1:21:43] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:21:47] confidence by the faith of him
[1:21:51] now I want to deal with this word
[1:21:52] purpose here a little bit and I we're
[1:21:54] going to see where we where we move to
[1:21:56] on this because I've gotten more to go
[1:21:57] but I want to just lay this in and we're
[1:21:59] talking about the purpose of God in his
[1:22:03] purpose
[1:22:05] so not my purpose is his purpose
[1:22:08] if my purpose must be found in him
[1:22:12] if my purpose and his purpose aren't
[1:22:16] jiving together then we know who's wrong
[1:22:20] I'm wrong but my purpose is to be found
[1:22:24] in his purpose
[1:22:26] my purpose in life is not to take away
[1:22:29] from his purpose
[1:22:32] all right because my purpose is temporal
[1:22:38] but his is eternal
[1:22:40] and I want to we want to operate sure we
[1:22:43] have temporal things but we want to
[1:22:45] operate under the influence of the
[1:22:48] Eternal
[1:22:49] now here's the word purpose
[1:22:51] I love this
[1:22:54] and I'm promised I'm going to try to get
[1:22:56] not too carried away on this but I want
[1:22:57] you to catch this
[1:23:00] a purpose this right here according to
[1:23:01] the Eternal purpose this word right here
[1:23:04] it is the word that not only means
[1:23:07] purpose but it's the same word for shoe
[1:23:10] bread
[1:23:11] wow
[1:23:13] according to not just deal with me just
[1:23:15] be with me bear with me a moment
[1:23:17] and the shoe bread itself
[1:23:20] so let me just finish out this
[1:23:22] definition it's a setting forth of a
[1:23:26] thing
[1:23:27] placing of it in view
[1:23:30] the showbread so it's taking something
[1:23:33] and putting it in view
[1:23:36] so it's not hidden but it's in view
[1:23:41] now I want you to think of this because
[1:23:44] where this shoe bread and what it was
[1:23:47] just to give a little bit of a
[1:23:48] background it was 12 loaves of Wheat and
[1:23:51] bread it would be round like this and
[1:23:53] and it would be corresponding 12 of
[1:23:55] those loaves it would correspond to the
[1:23:58] 12 tribes of Israel
[1:24:00] so it had a connection with the tribes
[1:24:03] and these laws were offered to God every
[1:24:08] Sabbath and they were separated into two
[1:24:10] roads I don't want to get preaching the
[1:24:11] types but there's six here and six here
[1:24:13] and they were to lay for seven days upon
[1:24:17] a table and they were placed in a
[1:24:19] sanctuary in the front portion of the
[1:24:21] Tabernacle and afterwards of the temple
[1:24:23] so it was a purpose so here the Eternal
[1:24:27] purpose or the setting forth or placing
[1:24:31] into view or the the shoe bread that
[1:24:34] Eternal purpose what was purposed in
[1:24:35] Christ Jesus our lord so I'll just say
[1:24:38] it like this as the 12 loaves of bread
[1:24:41] were replaced on the Sabbath day it was
[1:24:44] placing those Loaves on his table when
[1:24:48] you read in the Scriptures it says his
[1:24:51] table
[1:24:52] it's not a man's table we are called to
[1:24:55] the Lord's table
[1:24:58] amen the Lord hath prepared a table for
[1:25:01] me
[1:25:02] not I prepared it do Lord have prepared
[1:25:05] a table for me
[1:25:07] in the presence of my enemies it was the
[1:25:10] placing of those Loaves on this table
[1:25:13] before the Lord that consecrated them to
[1:25:16] him so in order when the priest would
[1:25:19] make them they would make them there on
[1:25:21] the Sabbath day and they would bring in
[1:25:23] new Loaves and take those that were
[1:25:26] there and they would take them and they
[1:25:29] would eat the loaves that had been on
[1:25:32] that table for seven days
[1:25:34] are you hearing me that bread could it
[1:25:38] was only consecrated they went through
[1:25:40] all of the formulas doing this doing
[1:25:42] that fine flower all of that but it can
[1:25:45] only be consecrated when it was placed
[1:25:48] upon the table of the Lord before his
[1:25:51] presence before the Shekinah Glory of
[1:25:55] God
[1:25:56] now I want you to think this showbread
[1:25:58] when you hear the word showbread brother
[1:26:01] bran will call it shoe bread it's also
[1:26:03] called shoe bread but you notice it is
[1:26:05] the bread this is what shoe bread means
[1:26:07] it is the bread of his presence
[1:26:13] it is the bread of his face
[1:26:17] that's what shoe bread means the bread
[1:26:19] of his presence the bread of his face
[1:26:21] it's the bread can I say this the bread
[1:26:24] of his purpose
[1:26:27] amen so that bread now think of it here
[1:26:30] that think of it even how that God would
[1:26:33] pour out in every generation the hidden
[1:26:36] Manna to one a messenger that was
[1:26:40] ordained to receive that revelation
[1:26:43] and then there were those ordained to
[1:26:46] hear that Revelation and to receive it
[1:26:49] and walk in it
[1:26:50] Exodus 25 30 just so that we don't miss
[1:26:53] it here and thou shalt set upon the
[1:26:57] table of shoe bread before me always
[1:27:01] this word it becomes of his presence now
[1:27:04] and I want you to think upon this bread
[1:27:07] I wish I would have got the picture for
[1:27:09] you but just bear with me upon this
[1:27:12] showbread they were to put pure
[1:27:14] frankincense
[1:27:15] and frankincense speaks of divine
[1:27:19] service
[1:27:22] now I want you to think of this the
[1:27:24] Shekinah Glory
[1:27:26] the light of God coming upon the word of
[1:27:30] God is what reveals the purpose of
[1:27:34] almighty God let me just read a few
[1:27:37] statements here to you
[1:27:38] I don't have these posted there but you
[1:27:40] just have to bear with me the Shekinah
[1:27:42] Glory and the light of the Shekinah over
[1:27:45] the word and the word is a seed it
[1:27:48] brought forth the shoe bread to
[1:27:52] Believers only
[1:27:54] so it's the Shekinah ripening the seed
[1:27:58] bringing forth bread
[1:28:01] because what we're ordained to eat is
[1:28:03] not seed but bread
[1:28:06] is that right now the word of God is a
[1:28:09] seed and the seeds must be ripened by
[1:28:12] the presence of almighty God
[1:28:15] and when they are ripened by his
[1:28:17] presence then what we are partaking of
[1:28:20] is the bread of his presence
[1:28:23] it's the bread that reveals the purpose
[1:28:26] that we're called for
[1:28:28] you with me it's the bread of his face
[1:28:30] so it takes the word or the Water of
[1:28:33] Life to life in the sea now blood Ram
[1:28:36] goes on he says it like this it's all
[1:28:37] out of the thing and go God he said now
[1:28:39] breaking into the veil as we go through
[1:28:41] the veil and get into his presence where
[1:28:44] the word is not the Creed the word and
[1:28:47] in there seeing the Shekinah Glory the
[1:28:50] Shekinah the power the Holy Spirit
[1:28:52] shining upon the word bringing forth the
[1:28:55] promise it shows you're behind the veil
[1:28:59] so the word think of it now as the word
[1:29:03] as the promise of God the Shekinah Glory
[1:29:05] of God the Holy Spirit ripening the
[1:29:08] promise in our life taking a word God
[1:29:11] speaks to you and I a word a seed and
[1:29:15] you and I walk into the Shekinah Glory
[1:29:17] with that seed the presence of God will
[1:29:22] ripen that seed and make it live
[1:29:26] and what is it it then becomes the bread
[1:29:30] of his presence bread is the staff of
[1:29:33] life
[1:29:35] is that right now think of it here
[1:29:37] brother Brandon said I want you to think
[1:29:40] he said oh may we break Beyond the Veil
[1:29:42] to see who God Is Standing before you
[1:29:47] see who God is standing here before us
[1:29:51] the same Pillar of Fire he's veiled in
[1:29:54] human flesh notice he's not talking
[1:29:55] about history it's an announcement he's
[1:29:58] standing in human flesh
[1:30:00] oh he says what does the Shekinah do the
[1:30:04] shoe bread seed the word that we're to
[1:30:07] live on in this day by the promises the
[1:30:09] Shekinah Glory ripens that shoe bread
[1:30:12] brings it to pass makes it bread to the
[1:30:15] believer what has laid in the pages of
[1:30:18] the Bible year after year in the word
[1:30:21] for this age
[1:30:25] to every season
[1:30:27] there's a purpose
[1:30:29] through every time there's a season is
[1:30:31] that right there's a purpose notice this
[1:30:34] whole time he says here we are we are
[1:30:37] living in the time of Malachi 4 and what
[1:30:40] is that to do it's to turn the people
[1:30:42] back from the stumbling block to break
[1:30:45] down Traditions to reveal the bread with
[1:30:48] the Shekinah Glory to watch it ripen and
[1:30:51] produce just exactly what he said it
[1:30:54] would do it's the shoe bread for this
[1:30:56] age
[1:30:59] what are we talking about the purpose of
[1:31:02] God being revealed
[1:31:04] and God's purpose is not just something
[1:31:07] he's telling you but you listen when God
[1:31:11] told Elijah what to do Elijah in his
[1:31:15] weakest moment he ate the cakes that was
[1:31:17] made by by an Angel
[1:31:20] is that right and when he ate those
[1:31:22] cakes he went in the strength of that
[1:31:25] meal for 40 days
[1:31:28] I'm telling you we are not running by
[1:31:30] the strength of a Creed or a governor or
[1:31:33] a tradition it'll give out
[1:31:36] that's why you can't make this message a
[1:31:39] Creed and let it just stop with your
[1:31:41] mind let it just stop in your spirit
[1:31:43] with just agreeing with it you've got to
[1:31:46] die to yourself and become one with it
[1:31:52] Hallelujah then it become strength for
[1:31:55] the journey
[1:31:57] did it in making God empty promises I
[1:32:00] promise I'll not do this anymore I'll
[1:32:02] stop doing this I'll stop doing that but
[1:32:05] when it's in the word becomes rapid it
[1:32:08] becomes bread
[1:32:09] he said I am the bread of life
[1:32:17] the passion of Jesus Christ the bread of
[1:32:21] his presence the face of God revealed
[1:32:25] what did John see on the Isle of Palms
[1:32:27] he saw him
[1:32:31] what was it the bread of his presence
[1:32:33] the strength that he needed I'm telling
[1:32:36] you the strength to live and overcoming
[1:32:39] life it lays within the word of God it
[1:32:42] lays in the promises of God to help you
[1:32:44] clean up your life it lays in the
[1:32:46] promises of God
[1:32:48] but you've got to get zeroed in
[1:32:56] let me just say this
[1:33:00] I want you to think of this
[1:33:04] every Sabbath
[1:33:06] here they were
[1:33:08] 12 more lobes
[1:33:10] coming up
[1:33:12] and they would take those loaves that
[1:33:14] were there
[1:33:16] now
[1:33:21] I'm going to ask you
[1:33:23] what preserved those those loaves from
[1:33:26] corrupting
[1:33:29] help me now
[1:33:31] you sisters that make fresh baked bread
[1:33:33] and I'm not talking about the kind you
[1:33:34] buy from the store
[1:33:37] you know you bake it you better eat it
[1:33:40] right
[1:33:41] what a privilege
[1:33:45] right you know even you make ice tea you
[1:33:47] better drink it in a certain time coffee
[1:33:48] you better drink it in a certain time
[1:33:50] I'm asking you what kept that bread
[1:33:53] from spoiling
[1:33:56] what kept that bread that it won't know
[1:33:58] oh my we gotta eat this bread well you
[1:34:02] know just cut The Moldy piece off right
[1:34:03] there what kept the bread the shoe bread
[1:34:07] remember the purpose what kept it intact
[1:34:11] and not spillable spoiling
[1:34:15] what was it what was it that they have
[1:34:19] oh my brother Sammy they had super
[1:34:20] organic ingredients come on Church
[1:34:22] come on man
[1:34:24] I can agree they had it I could agree
[1:34:26] they had organic maybe they had organic
[1:34:29] but that ain't what kept it
[1:34:32] was natural ingredients but when it got
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:40] it got on his table
[1:34:44] what did it mean to be on his table it
[1:34:46] was a sacrifice
[1:34:50] glory be to God it was his presence that
[1:34:55] consecrated the bread it was his
[1:34:58] presence that kept molding us away from
[1:35:01] me
[1:35:02] are you hearing me now that's the same
[1:35:04] thing that keeps that whole Spirit of
[1:35:07] mold and complacency and starchiness
[1:35:10] away from your life what is it that
[1:35:13] keeps that man in check it is the
[1:35:16] presence of almighty God what is it the
[1:35:19] bread of his presence
[1:35:23] the shoe bread manna that is no longer
[1:35:26] just written where it's become light and
[1:35:30] light and power and glory and freedom
[1:35:33] and liberty
[1:35:36] the bread of his face
[1:35:39] the bread of his presence
[1:35:42] the bread of his purpose
[1:35:49] so there's an ongoing
[1:35:51] display in our lives
[1:35:55] because if that bread had been placed
[1:35:57] anywhere else
[1:35:58] it would have molded
[1:36:02] do you realize
[1:36:04] that's why
[1:36:05] and hear me out now
[1:36:07] that's why just to sit in the courts and
[1:36:11] hear the word and I believe in being Joy
[1:36:13] listen I get joy out of hearing the word
[1:36:15] of God but I know that my joy don't stop
[1:36:17] when I end
[1:36:18] are you hearing me my victory don't end
[1:36:21] when the Music Stops my victory don't
[1:36:24] let my victory my freedom my overcoming
[1:36:27] don't end when I get outside of church
[1:36:30] so it's not about I hope I can make it
[1:36:32] to Tuesday hope I can make it to
[1:36:33] Wednesday that's not a Christian Life
[1:36:35] let me just tell you you need to tell
[1:36:37] that devil and say I'm sick and tired of
[1:36:40] you robbing me of my privileges I don't
[1:36:42] have to live I hope so maybe so if I can
[1:36:45] hold on
[1:36:46] you can't hold on but you've got to have
[1:36:50] one on the inside of you that's greater
[1:36:52] than your will that's greater than your
[1:36:54] abilities because if not you can walk
[1:36:57] right out of a service like this and
[1:37:00] eventually you find mold in your life
[1:37:02] well I felt the prince of God nobody's
[1:37:05] denying that but it matters where it
[1:37:09] falls in your life
[1:37:11] remember the manna that fell out there
[1:37:14] they were to consume that Manna when it
[1:37:17] fell
[1:37:18] they took a golden Homer and put the
[1:37:21] manna that fell on the first day back in
[1:37:23] the holiest of holies
[1:37:25] the rest of the Manna after just within
[1:37:28] uh you know the hours of time it
[1:37:31] corrupted
[1:37:33] wow was there anything wrong with the
[1:37:35] Mana no it needed to get in the right
[1:37:37] place
[1:37:38] nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:41] come on Church well I've tried I've
[1:37:44] tried it's get the Holy Ghost it's got
[1:37:46] to be a real blue birth experience on
[1:37:50] the inside
[1:37:55] huh
[1:37:56] brother Samuel I'm tired of hearing that
[1:37:58] preach I imagine there were some people
[1:37:59] in Noah's day that got tired of hearing
[1:38:01] him not talk about rain
[1:38:04] but to me it's kind of comfortable to
[1:38:06] know where I'm standing
[1:38:09] because I'm also placed here as a light
[1:38:11] in this house to proclaim the Liberty
[1:38:14] that God has given to you that you don't
[1:38:17] have to live below your privileges
[1:38:20] come on friends you don't have to live
[1:38:23] below and let the limitations come in
[1:38:25] your mind well the devil said this well
[1:38:27] the devil said that when's the last time
[1:38:29] who says you got to listen to a liar
[1:38:32] everybody come on friends he's alive how
[1:38:36] do you know he's lying whenever he opens
[1:38:38] his mouth
[1:38:40] the spirit of God will never run you
[1:38:42] down he will bring conviction he wield
[1:38:45] you with your life he will call you
[1:38:47] through a higher walk
[1:38:49] he will tell you to stop living immoral
[1:38:51] he will tell you to put down cigarettes
[1:38:54] he will tell you to get off of the
[1:38:55] internet he will tell you those things
[1:38:57] why he's calling it alive
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:03] okay
[1:39:05] oh my mama
[1:39:07] so our lives it's an ongoing display in
[1:39:10] our lives just as they had to make
[1:39:13] bread
[1:39:15] every seven days and they would put that
[1:39:17] bread
[1:39:18] right up there
[1:39:20] now I'm not talking about getting down
[1:39:22] and discouraged
[1:39:26] but if down and discouraged leads you
[1:39:27] away from the house of God you need a
[1:39:31] deeper walk with God
[1:39:33] you wanted you saying you're living
[1:39:36] underneath the lights
[1:39:38] when it's cloudy outside it's cloudy
[1:39:41] when it's sunny glory to God it's sunny
[1:39:43] when it's raining Oh Me Oh My
[1:39:47] God come on friends we don't live and
[1:39:49] serve God by our feelings
[1:39:54] it's time to get to a place that we're
[1:39:57] beyond our feelings
[1:40:03] oh my so it's an ongoing display so our
[1:40:08] whole lives
[1:40:09] are the display
[1:40:11] of that shoe bread man of his face
[1:40:14] our lives are to be a reflection
[1:40:17] of his presence in all things
[1:40:20] remember it was what was hidden
[1:40:23] but it's a reflection in all things
[1:40:24] every one of us have our own walks of
[1:40:27] life
[1:40:28] places we come from we have decisions
[1:40:31] that are placed before us constantly
[1:40:34] is that right
[1:40:35] but the shoe bread man of which is the
[1:40:38] purpose of God
[1:40:40] that which gives us strength
[1:40:43] let me tell you
[1:40:45] if you're not feeding like you ought to
[1:40:47] be
[1:40:48] you're going to be weak

[1:41:28] kingdom of God and his righteousness let
[1:41:31] me tell you something God will come when

[1:41:35] shown through your life
[1:41:37] whoo What is it I'm talking about a
[1:41:39] bread with purpose in it a bread that
[1:41:41] when it's being ripened it takes a hold
[1:41:43] of our life a bread that gives
[1:41:45] leadership to us
[1:41:46] my mama
[1:41:49] it's 12.
[1:41:51] a number of horseshoe
[1:41:53] I want you to think of this
[1:41:56] positioned and placed in him
[1:41:59] and you know what it's not confined to a
[1:42:01] day I know they had to do it every
[1:42:04] Sabbath day
[1:42:06] but it's not confined to a day no more
[1:42:09] with a believer
[1:42:11] once you cross over into that Eighth Day
[1:42:13] once the New Birth has come
[1:42:16] once the Holy Ghost has come
[1:42:18] then you are living under the Feast of
[1:42:21] almighty God
[1:42:23] you're living by the strength of the
[1:42:26] shoe bread in your life
[1:42:28] in other words
[1:42:29] your life is the testimony and Witness
[1:42:34] of what a real Christian is
[1:42:38] you want to know what Jesus would do in
[1:42:40] this hour
[1:42:41] our lives are to display that
[1:42:43] wonder what Jesus would do on this
[1:42:45] situation
[1:42:47] wonder what Jesus would do here
[1:42:49] wonder how Jesus would raise his family
[1:42:51] wonder what Jesus would esteem to be the
[1:42:54] most important
[1:42:55] well whatever he did before he's still
[1:42:57] the same God
[1:42:59] is that right and if we're eating of the
[1:43:02] shoe bread word the bread of his
[1:43:04] presence
[1:43:05] it has the same effect on our lives
[1:43:12] let me just let me let me let me close
[1:43:14] with this here my I'll tell you
[1:43:17] sometimes I I just I hate the clock
[1:43:19] there's other times I love it there's
[1:43:21] other times I hate it and this is a time
[1:43:23] I hate the clock
[1:43:25] you say why because I feel like I just
[1:43:27] got lifted off
[1:43:33] but I want to say this
[1:43:37] that rightful partaking of his the bread
[1:43:40] of his presence remember his purpose
[1:43:43] according to his purpose
[1:43:46] as we're partaking of that word that is
[1:43:48] his purpose his life
[1:43:51] and it shows itself through our lives
[1:43:53] let me just I'm going to close with this
[1:43:55] thought here
[1:43:56] it's out of the message faith is our
[1:43:58] Victory if you haven't listened to that
[1:43:59] message you'd be a good message to
[1:44:00] listen to
[1:44:02] here I'm
[1:44:04] just drawing a lot from into that and
[1:44:06] throughout the messages of the absolute
[1:44:08] rising of the Sun and so forth
[1:44:10] but faith is a victory be a good one
[1:44:13] let me just say it this the purpose
[1:44:16] the purpose in your life
[1:44:19] or my life
[1:44:21] what we hold or esteem I'll say this
[1:44:24] what we hold our esteem is our purpose
[1:44:27] it shows
[1:44:30] see the shoe bread manna
[1:44:33] was hidden
[1:44:36] it was hidden
[1:44:38] the rest of them could not see that
[1:44:41] but only the priest
[1:44:42] who was separated
[1:44:45] could be a partaker of it
[1:44:48] and by being a partaker of that
[1:44:52] it was then if we can bring it to this
[1:44:54] point now
[1:44:55] it's reflected
[1:44:57] in our lives
[1:45:00] so it shows no matter what we say and
[1:45:02] you've heard brother Branham you've
[1:45:03] heard this statement over and over and
[1:45:04] it's not just statement brother Brands
[1:45:06] made but it's a common statement before
[1:45:07] all of us
[1:45:08] actions
[1:45:10] speak
[1:45:12] louder
[1:45:13] than words
[1:45:19] so whatever the purpose in your life
[1:45:21] whatever you do not what I say and I say
[1:45:23] well my purpose is to do this is to do
[1:45:25] that but remember
[1:45:28] it's his purpose and then we find our
[1:45:31] purpose in his purpose
[1:45:37] let me just close on this
[1:45:39] Bill REM said any of you know that in
[1:45:41] Olympics
[1:45:42] or any other athletic exercises no
[1:45:45] matter if you arrive first in the race
[1:45:47] if you haven't played the game according
[1:45:49] to the rules you're disqualified
[1:45:52] you have to play the rule right
[1:45:56] and that's the way it is with the human
[1:45:58] life
[1:45:59] you can't play the rules of the game of
[1:46:01] Life wrong
[1:46:03] and expect to win
[1:46:05] you've got to play it according to God's
[1:46:07] word and the purpose
[1:46:10] that you were brought here for
[1:46:13] now there's so many people
[1:46:14] that doesn't seem to have any kind of a
[1:46:17] purpose in life now watch out brother
[1:46:19] Brown describes this doesn't seem to
[1:46:21] have any kind of a purpose in life
[1:46:23] especially in the day that we now live
[1:46:25] in
[1:46:26] people just seem to think that all they
[1:46:28] have to do is keep up with somebody else
[1:46:30] boy I'll tell you if there ever was a
[1:46:33] time for that
[1:46:35] I mean you had to look next door to see
[1:46:37] what color they painted their steps now
[1:46:39] you just go on Facebook
[1:46:41] and they can Photoshop their steps
[1:46:45] it's all they painted them till green
[1:46:47] gotcha that was just a picture
[1:46:53] some of you'll get that tomorrow
[1:46:55] especially in this day that we now live
[1:46:57] in people just think that all they have
[1:46:59] to do is keep up with somebody else it's
[1:47:01] a rat race
[1:47:04] but Satan has designed it
[1:47:07] in the beginning
[1:47:10] he presented to Eve
[1:47:13] God won't mind
[1:47:15] God understands
[1:47:17] God really knows
[1:47:19] and then he raised her curiosity
[1:47:25] to look into it
[1:47:27] are you with me raise the curiosity what
[1:47:31] was it to get her to reach after
[1:47:33] something
[1:47:35] and yet she was in safe in God's
[1:47:38] Pavilion
[1:47:39] she had everything that she had need of
[1:47:41] right then
[1:47:43] all she had to do was wait on God's
[1:47:46] season
[1:47:48] that's all she had to do
[1:47:50] but see how Satan's desire is to try to
[1:47:53] reach for this
[1:47:54] reach for this listen friends
[1:47:58] you may not be reaching for sin
[1:48:00] you say well I'm not reaching for sin
[1:48:02] but I want to remind you of this the
[1:48:04] root money is the root of all evil
[1:48:09] and if everything that you're doing and
[1:48:11] sacrificing is for money
[1:48:14] you need to you need to get back in the
[1:48:16] friends of God
[1:48:17] either you've never been or you need to
[1:48:19] go fully into it
[1:48:22] are you hearing me brother Samuel that's
[1:48:24] strong well in this hour I know we're
[1:48:26] living in an age that really don't like
[1:48:27] to hear
[1:48:28] tough things but I'm I'm I believe I'm
[1:48:31] talking to believers who want to hear
[1:48:34] and if you don't sorry we'll give you
[1:48:36] earplugs the next time
[1:48:38] because I'm I'm going in a rapture
[1:48:41] and there are there are lives and hearts
[1:48:43] that this word is rapturing and catching
[1:48:45] away
[1:48:47] not just in a day coming but right now
[1:48:49] Moment by Moment by Moment by Moment by
[1:48:52] from Glory unto Glory unto Glory under
[1:48:55] Glory as I'm feeding on the bread of his
[1:48:59] presence
[1:49:00] foreign
[1:49:01] which is revealing the purpose of God
[1:49:03] for my life
[1:49:05] let me finish this quote
[1:49:10] I always have to keep up with somebody
[1:49:11] else with the Fashions of this world and
[1:49:13] with the enticements that the world has
[1:49:15] to give
[1:49:15] it's just like if you go to school and
[1:49:17] some of the little girls wear a certain
[1:49:18] little frock or dresses or whatever
[1:49:21] you'd call it all the ambition of the
[1:49:24] rest of that school has is to pattern
[1:49:26] after that girl
[1:49:27] with its hairdos or you know got to wear
[1:49:30] a certain certain style or you got to
[1:49:32] wear you know you got to wear everything
[1:49:33] in a certain way it's got to be it's got
[1:49:35] to be out right here you know
[1:49:38] wow that's cool who said it was cool
[1:49:46] I say that in a matter that we want to
[1:49:48] be careful what we're patterning after
[1:49:50] yeah
[1:49:51] yeah and I'm talking even to the young
[1:49:53] people
[1:49:54] because what you pattern after those
[1:49:57] Styles carry spirits
[1:50:01] are you hearing me now this is free
[1:50:04] it carries spirits
[1:50:07] who is it that would draw you and
[1:50:09] motivate you to want to be like somebody
[1:50:11] else out there
[1:50:13] God's given enough examples right here
[1:50:15] in his word God's given it if you can
[1:50:18] really say God my eyes I'm looking at
[1:50:20] the wrong thing I'm setting my ambitions
[1:50:22] on the wrong thing when you set your
[1:50:24] Ambitions and your sights on the
[1:50:26] patterns of this world you're missing
[1:50:28] God's purpose you weren't to be a dummy
[1:50:31] in a display of that of Satan Styles you
[1:50:35] were to be a display of the glory of God
[1:50:38] as a young person yes as a young person
[1:50:43] the Holy Ghost doesn't have any age
[1:50:46] limits on it
[1:50:48] and when I said a dummy I'm talking
[1:50:50] about a mannequin
[1:50:52] just so we understand
[1:50:59] some of the women see on television some
[1:51:01] sort of lady come out might as well say
[1:51:02] Instagram whatever
[1:51:05] insta book to Facebook whatever
[1:51:07] television some sort of lady come out
[1:51:10] and dressed in a certain fashion that's
[1:51:12] their ambition to dress and to act like
[1:51:14] that
[1:51:16] that's just about the limit of the
[1:51:18] American ambition is to get a new job
[1:51:20] or to get a raise in your salary and to
[1:51:23] get a television or a new car
[1:51:26] wow
[1:51:27] sell out time with God
[1:51:29] for things that are temporary
[1:51:32] things that you could turn around let's
[1:51:33] just talk about a new car drive it off
[1:51:35] the lot already lost thousands of
[1:51:37] dollars nothing wrong with a new car but
[1:51:39] if a new car if it's going to require
[1:51:41] you and keep you out of the prince of
[1:51:42] God where you can't pray and get before
[1:51:45] God and be in the house of God that I'm
[1:51:47] telling you that ain't God's will
[1:51:50] you'd be better off driving a car that
[1:51:52] you had to duct tape together and paddle
[1:51:54] around like Fred Flintstone and be in
[1:51:56] the presence of God I ain't saying that
[1:51:58] to be funny I'm saying it because it's
[1:52:00] the truth
[1:52:03] you know why because you can't even be
[1:52:06] free in your mind when you got things on
[1:52:08] your mind and the Bill's going to get
[1:52:09] paid am I going to be able to do this am
[1:52:11] I going to be able to do that it's traps
[1:52:13] it's what is it trying to do weigh you
[1:52:16] down
[1:52:18] and Satan said it's all right that ain't
[1:52:20] sinful but it's weighing you down it's
[1:52:23] taking away your meditation there's
[1:52:25] anxiousness setting in there's
[1:52:27] depression setting in there's tenseness
[1:52:30] setting in all these excuses come here
[1:52:32] what you're doing trying to keep your
[1:52:35] way from the shoe bread manna that
[1:52:37] reveals to you this is not your home
[1:52:44] this is not your purpose
[1:52:51] oh my
[1:52:55] wow
[1:53:00] no one only got two more paragraphs
[1:53:05] I just want to set this for a Direction
[1:53:08] because everybody's got Ambitions oh I'm
[1:53:11] I'm uh I don't have ambition no you just
[1:53:14] watch it
[1:53:15] you you watch the purpose whatever the
[1:53:17] purpose is whatever let me say this
[1:53:19] whatever is first in your life and
[1:53:21] whatever you value the most
[1:53:23] it'll show
[1:53:26] it shows
[1:53:32] let me say this those things brother
[1:53:34] Brandon said they may be all right
[1:53:36] but there's higher Ambitions in the
[1:53:40] human life than those things
[1:53:42] and Christians
[1:53:44] should set
[1:53:47] their affection on higher Ambitions now
[1:53:49] that's scripture
[1:53:52] let me make sure I'm reading that right
[1:53:54] and God should set the Christian's
[1:53:56] affections
[1:53:57] on higher ambitions
[1:54:00] no
[1:54:01] Paul never wrote it that way in
[1:54:03] Colossians 2. he says if you are raised
[1:54:06] with him
[1:54:07] if you're raised with him
[1:54:10] you set your affections
[1:54:13] on things above
[1:54:15] that may be where you've got to pray and
[1:54:16] say Lord there's some things that's
[1:54:18] pulling on me some wants
[1:54:20] but there's one want that I know that I
[1:54:22] need and that's you
[1:54:25] because I don't want my wants to become
[1:54:28] Shackles on my life when my prayer life
[1:54:31] is Shackled In My My Walk with You
[1:54:33] becomes paralyzed
[1:54:35] because what's what's happening it's
[1:54:37] paralyzing the purpose that God's called
[1:54:40] you for
[1:54:44] I think it would pay us all to set down
[1:54:48] and wonder why we are here in the first
[1:54:50] place
[1:54:51] ever who it was kind enough to bring us
[1:54:53] here
[1:54:54] we ought to consider
[1:54:56] and ask him
[1:54:58] what he would have us to do
[1:55:01] the purpose of his coming
[1:55:03] and to fulfill
[1:55:05] what he has purposed us for
[1:55:08] right I think that would be
[1:55:11] I don't just think once
[1:55:13] I think that every day Lord take my hand
[1:55:17] guide me this day Lord Jesus
[1:55:20] Lead Me Lord
[1:55:22] there will be decisions that will be
[1:55:23] placed before me that I
[1:55:25] I don't I don't trust myself
[1:55:28] but I'm asking you to be the influence
[1:55:30] Lord
[1:55:32] you know what is the next step ahead of
[1:55:34] me Lord I don't know
[1:55:37] but I want to feed on the bread of your
[1:55:40] presence
[1:55:42] of what is the real purpose of my life
[1:55:45] like when you get into that place you
[1:55:47] think this is where I belong
[1:55:49] this is it this is where I belong
[1:55:53] where in him
[1:55:55] in his presence
[1:55:56] in his presence
[1:56:00] now you know what if there's anything
[1:56:01] that Shackled you down and has got you
[1:56:03] away from the prayer the purpose of God
[1:56:05] right here this morning he's still the
[1:56:08] one to release shackles it may not be
[1:56:10] necessarily things that you could just
[1:56:11] shake off and you know put to the side
[1:56:13] like like this right here of my
[1:56:15] handkerchief but it might be things that
[1:56:18] what you've got to do
[1:56:19] is eat yourself and pray yourself
[1:56:23] free
[1:56:24] in your own life
[1:56:25] you say why would God do that because if
[1:56:28] God just lifted certain things from our
[1:56:30] lives we would turn around and get
[1:56:32] tangled right back in the same mess the
[1:56:34] next time
[1:56:35] is that right so God is a faithful
[1:56:38] father
[1:56:39] because remember he's got a purpose all
[1:56:41] of his discipline all of his correction
[1:56:43] all of his admonition he is here for the
[1:56:47] full nurturing and counsel of Our Lives
[1:56:50] and there's one thing that God desires
[1:56:52] is that we would serve his purpose
[1:56:57] I'd say Lord this morning if I've got a
[1:57:00] purpose that I'm putting up here and
[1:57:02] it's adding to the word of God or taking
[1:57:05] away from the word of God or making a
[1:57:07] word of God not that important or less
[1:57:09] I'd say Lord Jesus
[1:57:12] grant me Deliverance this morning
[1:57:15] Deliverance this morning because you
[1:57:17] know what it is it's all about us
[1:57:18] recognizing it
[1:57:20] sometimes we look and say I want to get
[1:57:22] right out of this but remember remember
[1:57:24] eating our way and praying our way to
[1:57:28] Deliverance because what will happen the
[1:57:30] word will give you wisdom and strength
[1:57:33] because you'll be faced with that test
[1:57:35] again
[1:57:36] you'll be faced with it again every test
[1:57:39] when we fail a test we will have to take
[1:57:42] it again
[1:57:43] we'll have to keep on taking it until we
[1:57:45] finally pass it how do I pass it with
[1:57:48] the pass over
[1:57:50] I pass it with his strength
[1:57:53] I pass it with his help
[1:57:57] I believe God I believe he's here
[1:58:00] I believe we've gathered right here in
[1:58:02] this presence
[1:58:03] and what a moment and an opportunity
[1:58:05] friends if the word of God if it's only
[1:58:08] been something that you've enjoyed and
[1:58:10] it's only fell on your spirit and you go
[1:58:12] right back out and live the same kind of
[1:58:13] life that you've always lived why don't
[1:58:15] you let God say Lord
[1:58:17] I need a real Deliverance in my life
[1:58:21] and you know what if you're not at that
[1:58:22] place of real desperation in your life
[1:58:24] with God you need to get desperate
[1:58:27] you need to say Lord Make Me desperate
[1:58:30] Lord
[1:58:31] because it would do you no good if
[1:58:33] you're not desperate it would do you no
[1:58:35] good
[1:58:35] but say Lord Make Me desperate make
[1:58:38] bring me to the place of desperation
[1:58:40] like you brought Jacob to
[1:58:44] as long as everything kept on going okay
[1:58:46] for Jacob Jacob was okay but eventually
[1:58:49] God started turning so things the
[1:58:51] countenance of his father-in-law turned
[1:58:53] against him Jacob started noticing
[1:58:55] certain things oh I'm not I I can't
[1:58:58] dwell here anymore I can't dwell there
[1:59:00] and God was calling him come back to
[1:59:03] Bethel
[1:59:04] come back to Bethel
[1:59:06] I say this morning
[1:59:09] let him be the Lord of your life
[1:59:11] if you've never received the Holy Ghost
[1:59:13] let it be here this morning let it be a
[1:59:15] real desperation upon your life but
[1:59:18] remember God will not come over
[1:59:20] unconfessed sin he will not come over
[1:59:23] and do a work when you're living in a
[1:59:25] way that you shouldn't be living
[1:59:27] but if you can stand and really from
[1:59:29] your heart say Lord forgive me and I
[1:59:32] make a declaration by his word by the
[1:59:35] strength of the bread of his presence
[1:59:38] Lord
[1:59:39] I'm going to live for you
[1:59:43] it's you that I want it's you that what
[1:59:46] matters more than anything else in my
[1:59:49] life
[1:59:50] when you can get desperate that way
[1:59:53] he'll come
[1:59:55] you say how do I get desperate ask God
[1:59:57] if it's not there say Lord think about
[1:59:59] it life and death it's got to be between
[2:00:01] life and death
[2:00:03] maybe here this morning maybe things
[2:00:05] that you've got entangled with certain
[2:00:07] things and you think man I just can't do
[2:00:09] what I what I used to do I can't do what
[2:00:11] I used to do man I used to be able to do
[2:00:13] this and used to build that well listen
[2:00:15] first of all I'm just going to say to
[2:00:17] you don't roll around in pity because I
[2:00:20] won't do you no good that that's another
[2:00:22] one of Satan's tactics to roll around
[2:00:24] and then we get to look and oh but
[2:00:26] right here this morning the first way of
[2:00:29] Deliverance is to recognize I need help
[2:00:33] I need help
[2:00:35] I need help I need God's direction for
[2:00:40] my life
[2:00:41] I need God to come I need that first
[2:00:44] part in my life that's what I need
[2:00:48] let's pray
[2:00:52] Lord Jesus
[2:00:55] oh Father
[2:00:59] Lord is here we are gathered
[2:01:01] you're under Lord
[2:01:03] the roof but I believe that we are
[2:01:05] gathered more than just under the roof
[2:01:08] of this building
[2:01:09] we have gathered Lord God
[2:01:12] under the revealed word of this hour
[2:01:14] gathered under your presence Lord
[2:01:18] Jesus it's not
[2:01:20] us that has brought us to this place
[2:01:23] that Lord you have led us you have drawn
[2:01:26] us Lord
[2:01:28] father you see Lord every need all
[2:01:31] throughout Lord there's needs throughout
[2:01:33] the building
[2:01:35] you know every Heart Lord
[2:01:38] father lives that Lord where there's a
[2:01:40] need of a real desperation Lord Jesus
[2:01:43] I pray that God that May there be Lord a
[2:01:47] desperation Lord in the hearts that
[2:01:49] would set in by your presence Lord
[2:01:52] pray that God that Lord for lives and
[2:01:55] hearts Lord that
[2:01:56] your God that don't know you Lord in
[2:01:59] that way
[2:02:01] that Lord just to know the word is not
[2:02:04] life
[2:02:05] but it's to know you
[2:02:07] Lord to where that it's your life that's
[2:02:10] on display in our life
[2:02:13] it's something Lord that starts in a
[2:02:15] very simple reflection
[2:02:18] that could be asked the life
[2:02:21] that I Live Now
[2:02:23] is that a life that I would have to try
[2:02:25] to explain to somebody
[2:02:29] or is there a life a testimony
[2:02:32] of a Christian that's on display
[2:02:36] the lord requires not even my speech
[2:02:42] but it's lived
[2:02:45] it's lived the world Lord will classify
[2:02:50] when they can see people on Sundays
[2:02:52] dressed up maybe shirt tied suit not
[2:02:55] stress
[2:02:57] whatever it might be
[2:02:58] they can classify all those are church
[2:03:00] people well they go to church
[2:03:04] the Lord
[2:03:06] we're not called to be church people
[2:03:10] that's not what a Christian is
[2:03:14] a Christian does Lord does go to church
[2:03:17] but a Christian Lord is not a church
[2:03:20] life
[2:03:22] Lord I know we've heard this over and
[2:03:25] over and over
[2:03:26] and I'm sure I'm sure
[2:03:29] oh God the effects Lord where it will
[2:03:31] take an effect as it has
[2:03:35] throughout the Time Lord
[2:03:38] my prayer father
[2:03:42] I don't want to see nobody miss it Lord
[2:03:45] I don't want to see him miss the joy
[2:03:47] that is right now
[2:03:48] the freedom
[2:03:50] the victory
[2:03:51] the Liberty
[2:03:53] that God you have made available
[2:03:57] right now
[2:03:59] Lord may be a son or daughter that's
[2:04:01] underneath Lord a cloud of darkness and
[2:04:04] dismal
[2:04:05] but father your voice would call out to
[2:04:07] him Lord
[2:04:08] and let them know
[2:04:10] I am your Liberty
[2:04:12] I am your freedom
[2:04:15] granted Lord I pray this morning
[2:04:19] father
[2:04:21] if there be any Lord that we can look
[2:04:24] down lord
[2:04:25] in our lives if there's anything Lord
[2:04:28] God that is
[2:04:31] caused us to be hindered
[2:04:34] decisions that we've made
[2:04:37] that Lord God is hindering
[2:04:41] hindering the Lord the purpose of God
[2:04:43] from being served in my life
[2:04:46] I would but
[2:04:49] if I could
[2:04:51] but

[2:05:09] may you grant the Lord God that
[2:05:14] that what's needed right now Lord
[2:05:18] to lead us Lord because we can never see
[2:05:21] that Lord that we're in a trap we can
[2:05:23] never see what's going on
[2:05:25] we could try to go from this to that to
[2:05:27] this Lord and it ends up being a more of

[2:23:15] [Music]
[2:23:19] that's my desire
[2:23:21] is that yours
[2:23:23] what I want to continue to humble myself
[2:23:28] you know Cain was able to Humble himself
[2:23:30] to a certain place but when the word
[2:23:34] spoke to him in another place Cain said
[2:23:37] no no no no my humility ends right there
[2:23:41] but you know humility itself is even
[2:23:44] when the word speaks to our life and it
[2:23:46] might go against the grain but we say
[2:23:48] Lord
[2:23:49] this is your word
[2:23:52] and you know the reality of it is is God
[2:23:54] does not come
[2:23:55] God the spirit of God does not work in
[2:23:58] condemnation
[2:23:59] he does not work to do that
[2:24:02] the word brings correction and the whole
[2:24:04] word of Correction
[2:24:06] is meaning restoration
[2:24:09] and healing
[2:24:12] he's not given us the spirit of fear
[2:24:15] but of Power of Love
[2:24:17] and a sound mind
[2:24:20] Lord I want more
[2:24:22] I only want more but even as I'm eating
[2:24:25] on this bread
[2:24:27] I want to humble myself
[2:24:30] if there's things that I'm eating on the
[2:24:32] bread and it points out things that's
[2:24:33] there in my life things that could be
[2:24:36] hindrances
[2:24:38] that's what the word has come to do to
[2:24:40] changes
[2:24:42] that's what we've come to the house of
[2:24:43] God isn't it that's what we give
[2:24:45] ourselves to the Lord as the Lord I want
[2:24:47] to be further changed I want to be
[2:24:50] changed because you know what one of
[2:24:51] these moments is going to be the final
[2:24:53] moment of change
[2:24:55] the same sweep that leads us right now
[2:24:57] to change will be the same sweep that'll
[2:25:00] move over us will change the very atoms
[2:25:02] of our body
[2:25:03] oh Lord I want to just I want to just
[2:25:06] take in that bread of his presence if
[2:25:08] it's something that's against my will or
[2:25:10] my wants Lord I want your will above my
[2:25:12] wants it doesn't mean I may not be
[2:25:14] disappointed but I want his will I'd
[2:25:17] rather be disappointed right now
[2:25:19] and then later down the line a day a
[2:25:21] week or whatever down the line I say
[2:25:23] thank you Lord for grace that gave me to
[2:25:27] go against what my will was and to
[2:25:29] accept your will
[2:25:30] right
[2:25:32] oh Hallelujah Heavenly Father
[2:25:35] Lord as we just Lord come into a moment
[2:25:38] right here Lord I
[2:25:40] just pray that you would just go with
[2:25:41] each and every one Lord
[2:25:44] more different ones Lord as we go our
[2:25:46] different ways
[2:25:48] Lord God for every need Lord that has
[2:25:50] been gathered here this morning in every
[2:25:52] heart
[2:25:53] Lord as we take the words and we lay
[2:25:55] into our hearts and allow the word to
[2:25:57] just comb through our lives Lord
[2:26:01] with just our desire is to be pleasing
[2:26:03] Lord
[2:26:05] Lord we want to just look in the mirror
[2:26:08] of your word
[2:26:11] and we're Lord we see our shortcomings
[2:26:14] we know it's your love that would make
[2:26:15] that known to us
[2:26:18] because it's your desire to do for us
[2:26:21] to move in our lives Lord
[2:26:23] we want to be Lord zeroed in
[2:26:26] and determined to fulfill the purpose of
[2:26:29] God
[2:26:30] distractions everything all around Lord
[2:26:33] to try to distract us and take us away
[2:26:36] that God
[2:26:37] thank you Father
[2:26:39] for your word and your presence this
[2:26:41] morning
[2:26:42] thank you Father for the encouragement
[2:26:44] that you
[2:26:46] give to us Lord
[2:26:48] like David said daily he loadeth us with
[2:26:53] benefits
[2:26:54] give us this day our daily
[2:26:58] shoe bread
[2:27:00] granted Lord God
[2:27:02] give us the strength Lord that we need
[2:27:04] Lord
[2:27:05] like Elijah going through the Lord the
[2:27:08] strength
[2:27:10] of those cakes
[2:27:12] that same strength he outran The Chariot
[2:27:16] of Elijah
[2:27:19] what God may we walk by the strength of
[2:27:23] the word
[2:27:24] the strength of your presence
[2:27:26] the strength of your own life
[2:27:28] be with your children Lord
[2:27:31] go with us as we go our separate ways
[2:27:34] and Lord may we walk with an expectation
[2:27:39] Lord expecting
[2:27:41] that God as we have been in your
[2:27:43] presence
[2:27:44] and to realize Lord we don't leave your
[2:27:46] presence when we leave this building
[2:27:48] your presence
[2:27:49] goes with us
[2:27:51] and we say like Moses
[2:27:54] if your presence doesn't go up don't
[2:27:57] carry me any further I don't want to go
[2:28:00] anywhere
[2:28:01] where your presence is not leading
[2:28:04] granted Lord we pray father in
[2:28:06] everything Lord for our desire
[2:28:10] is to glorify you is to Worship You Lord
[2:28:13] not just with hands that are lifted up
[2:28:15] not just with mouth lornev where we can
[2:28:18] sing the Praises of God
[2:28:20] but Lord to where that every
[2:28:23] part of our life is a worship
[2:28:27] unto you
[2:28:29] for we were once bound
[2:28:32] but we're now free
