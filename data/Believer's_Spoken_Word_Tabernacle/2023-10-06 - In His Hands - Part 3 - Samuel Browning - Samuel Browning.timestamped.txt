[33:13] in a word of prayer I had two prayer
[33:16] cloths here that brother Gomez had asked

[33:24] well Heavenly Father
[33:28] Lord as we're just so thankful for these
[33:30] moments that you allow us to have
[33:34] lord lord it's according to your word
[33:36] that we would gather together Lord with
[33:40] an expectation Lord a rest in our hearts
[33:43] that where two or three are gathered
[33:45] together in your name here you are in
[33:48] the midst of us Lord there's no greater
[33:51] request that we could have because Lord
[33:55] in you and with you all all things are
[33:57] possible it really doesn't matter the
[34:00] request or the need sometimes Lord my
[34:03] it's just Lord to our mind in our way of
[34:05] thinking we can look at it and we can
[34:08] see the limitations as far as in the
[34:10] humanity but God when we look to you and
[34:13] that's where we look as Believers Lord
[34:16] we look to you father and there is no
[34:19] limitations there Lord and Lord frankly
[34:22] as your Prophet Lord would quote that
[34:25] scripture that Lord
[34:27] if we can believe all things are
[34:29] possible and your Prophet would turn
[34:32] around in the Easter seal in 1965 and
[34:34] say and you as a Believer there's
[34:37] nothing impossible with you Lord we know
[34:40] that that is much deeper than just our
[34:43] flesh but we're coming to realize more
[34:46] and more that this guy that we take care
[34:49] of and pack around that's not the real
[34:51] us that's just like a screen that allows
[34:54] a picture Lord to be seen on Lord oh God
[34:59] truly Lord when we shake hands with one
[35:01] another and greet one another in

[36:58] to remind you as you're turning there
[37:00] that we'll have the communion service on
[37:03] Sunday and that will follow uh the
[37:06] ministering uh portion of the service
[37:08] and uh of course we'll give an
[37:09] opportunity for uh any lives any hearts
[37:12] that want to be prayed for or a heart
[37:14] that maybe wants to come to the Lord or
[37:17] uh however that God would work and and I
[37:19] told you I would try to be very mindful
[37:21] of the time we're going to try this like
[37:23] this this time I I can't promise that it
[37:25] would stay that way I'm just going to
[37:27] try and we'll just see how it goes and
[37:29] how how the Lord will will lead us
[37:31] there's a objective is so that it would
[37:33] try to be more convenient for everyone
[37:35] else as well so uh you just uh let's
[37:39] just be in prayer for that amen I I
[37:42] thank God for uh the communion Services
[37:44] what a wonderful time amen job 23 and
[37:48] I'm just going to read three vers of
[37:50] scripture and then we'll let you be
[37:51] seated I Just Want to Jump Right In on
[37:53] verse eight uh behold I go forward Ward
[37:57] but he is not there and backward but I
[38:00] cannot perceive him on the left hand
[38:04] where he doth work but I cannot Behold
[38:07] Him He hideth himself on the right hand
[38:10] that I cannot see him but he knoweth the
[38:13] way that I take and when he ha tried me
[38:17] I shall come forth as gold bless the
[38:20] Lord amen may God bless you and bless
[38:22] the reading of the word as you're being
[38:23] seated Lord I want to just continue to
[38:26] speak on this
[38:28] part on in his hands and I just want to
[38:33] really draw from that verse n where
[38:35] we've been looking at it in that part
[38:38] and I um this is to me when we look at
[38:42] it on the left hand and on the right and
[38:44] we have been stressing that that God in
[38:47] himself it's not it's all figurative in
[38:50] terms of his hands it's God being
[38:53] involved in every part as a matter of
[38:55] fact there's one of the Hebrew letters
[38:57] that as I was reading of this even a
[38:59] week ago it is present within every word
[39:03] of God because it represents that one of
[39:06] those words that represents God's hand
[39:09] and I believe I've got the word right y
[39:11] or Yad however you pronounce it it's
[39:13] present because God is present in every
[39:17] part of his word because he is his word
[39:20] there's no one can bring the word to
[39:22] pass but God and to even think of even
[39:25] in the time that we're living in and I
[39:28] just look at this of how that God would
[39:30] this would be portrayed and set forth
[39:33] here in verse n i I want to just say it
[39:35] in this way that God he's balanced in
[39:39] every one of his dealings with us and
[39:41] all things uh there are times where we
[39:44] look at it like we see out here today
[39:46] there's wet seasons and there's dry
[39:49] seasons and there's Seasons that come
[39:51] there that's just why there's such a
[39:53] time you know I sometimes we look at why
[39:55] is there like that little bit of a
[39:57] dusting of snow and up here up north
[40:00] they have what they call winter wheat
[40:01] and it's got to take that little
[40:03] covering of snow to kind of protect that
[40:05] seed and that moisture then to get down
[40:07] there so that that wheat will be ready
[40:09] for Harvest in the springtime and so
[40:12] there's always those things that
[40:14] sometimes that we may not understand
[40:16] what's the purpose and what's the need
[40:17] of it but every season itself there is a
[40:21] purpose that God has God has every
[40:24] appointed season and we see that that
[40:26] even when we look at that as God would
[40:29] unfold in tight there in uh in Leviticus
[40:32] and he would make known the different
[40:35] seasons or the different uh uh Feast of
[40:38] the Lord they would all come in the
[40:40] different seasons they didn't all happen
[40:41] at once but they all happened in their
[40:44] own season and we understand that that
[40:46] as we step back by God's grace and look
[40:49] at it that it we're not just seeing
[40:51] Feast of the Lord but we see Christ in
[40:54] every verse of the scripture we're
[40:56] seeing God being unfolded all the way
[40:58] through because the feast themselves
[41:00] they take into the entirety of the great
[41:03] program of almighty God and God laid it
[41:05] out in type of things that he's working
[41:08] and doing and I I want to just draw from
[41:10] this to kind of lay this background in
[41:12] here tonight in Psalms
[41:14] 31:5 I think this is the greatest thing
[41:17] that we can ever do into thy hand I
[41:20] commit my spirit thou Hast redeemed me
[41:24] oh Lord God of Truth what a powerful
[41:26] thing committal is yes sir you know when
[41:29] we commit something and that's probably
[41:30] the greatest struggle that we have
[41:32] within our humanity is to is to commit
[41:34] things because we have a tendency to
[41:37] worry you know I I've teased some and
[41:40] joke with some and I've said they might
[41:41] not call you for a prayer request they
[41:43] call you for a worry request could you
[41:45] help me worry about this and worry now I
[41:48] didn't say it to anybody this is close
[41:49] people to me that I just kind of tease
[41:52] you know uh but you know when I look at
[41:54] it there's times that we're prone to
[41:56] that that in ourselves we see that
[41:58] within our our Humanity but you know
[42:00] when we're looking at things so many
[42:03] times this is where our Victory comes is
[42:05] when we can really commit things to the
[42:07] Lord and say I'm not going to worry
[42:09] about that any longer and you know I've
[42:11] never been too big to say God help me
[42:13] get to that place to where I really can
[42:15] commit it because as long as I keep it
[42:18] God can't do nothing about it but when I
[42:20] can commit it and that means where I've
[42:22] surrendered it I'm not worrying about it
[42:24] I put it in his hands and you know
[42:26] friends listen that's not a work of
[42:28] Samuel that's not a work of you that's
[42:30] saying God help me come into that place
[42:33] this is your word and I'm not going to
[42:35] worry about it no
[42:37] longer and this is why brother Bram
[42:39] would say God is all God is just trying
[42:41] to find someone that he can get into his
[42:44] hands he's always tried to do that
[42:46] that's God's desire as we looked at it
[42:48] from a few weeks ago that God's desire
[42:50] is to have lives that he can get into
[42:52] his hands God just don't want there to
[42:55] be lives that you know that they can
[42:58] experience God's healing power but yet
[43:01] there's no life that comes from that as
[43:03] far as where their life becomes a real
[43:05] expression of him God's desire is that
[43:08] our life would truly be one of his
[43:10] handiwork I mean God set all the stars
[43:13] in place he set everything in its
[43:15] position that's where he wrote his first
[43:17] Bible and God put them all there and you
[43:19] know what they all are known by name
[43:22] there's not one of them you know you
[43:23] didn't lose any sleep wondering with
[43:25] that star stay in its place or would
[43:27] this one fall God's got them all there
[43:29] and they're all set in his time and
[43:31] they're all declaring a purpose and so
[43:34] that's the same way when God desires to
[43:36] get us into his hands and this is where
[43:39] you know with thinking of that then it
[43:41] comes down to us that for us to give all
[43:44] that we have to the Lord and I I think
[43:47] is once again I think these are precious
[43:49] moments in this time that you and I can
[43:51] have that real personal placing with God
[43:54] to speak to the Lord and just say Lord I
[43:57] want all of my life in your hands you
[44:00] know friends I've never stopped asking
[44:02] that I've never stopped there I've never
[44:04] just placed it and said well all of my
[44:06] life is there you you know I've been
[44:07] born again I want all of my life in his
[44:10] hand I want all my actions I want my
[44:11] thoughts I want everything in God's
[44:14] hands so even brother B says your
[44:17] reverence your respects everything you
[44:18] are just put it all in God's hands in
[44:21] Psalms 37-5 perhap this scripture will
[44:24] tie a little bit more into our our
[44:27] subject tonight as we go along verse
[44:29] five commit thy way unto the Lord trust
[44:33] also in him and he shall bring it to
[44:39] pass how do I commit my way unto the
[44:42] Lord It's committing my life unto him
[44:45] it's committing all that I am unto him
[44:48] it's placing it in his hands and when
[44:50] it's all in his hands this word commit
[44:53] here actually means to roll upon on one
[44:56] to roll so God is saying remember cast
[45:00] all your cares on me cuz I care for you
[45:04] so to put our our committal to put it
[45:06] upon the Lord he'll bring it to pass not
[45:09] I will bring it to pass not you will
[45:11] bring it to pass but he'll bring it to
[45:13] pass what will he bring to pass he'll
[45:16] bring to pass everything that you've
[45:18] committed to him God will bring it to
[45:22] pass all the ways everything that you
[45:25] commit to God God will bring it to pass
[45:27] verse six and he shall bring forth thy
[45:31] righteousness as the light and thy
[45:34] judgment as the noon
[45:37] day amen I tell you everywhere you look
[45:40] in the word of God you should see Jesus
[45:43] Christ amen and when you see him you
[45:46] should see yourself and when you see
[45:48] yourself in him you find rest yes sir I
[45:52] just say it in this way he'll bring it
[45:54] to pass amen
[45:56] I never can I just say it this way it
[45:59] isn't I know we say receive the Holy
[46:01] Ghost but brother Bram says it two
[46:03] different places in the message in the
[46:04] 50s then he comes around in future home
[46:06] he says I don't think you should say
[46:08] I've received the Holy Ghost he said
[46:10] it's the holy ghost that accepts
[46:13] you is that right how perfect is that
[46:17] it's God drawing us it's God dealing
[46:20] with our lives it's God all along and
[46:22] what's happening it's you yielding it's
[46:24] me yielding it's god making away for
[46:26] himself it's not me trying to get good
[46:29] enough it's God working to bring me into
[46:32] the position that I need to be and if I
[46:35] can just commit my ways to the Lord then
[46:37] he'll bring it to pass I say it just
[46:40] like this you're in that channel stay in
[46:42] that channel keep following him and God
[46:45] will bring his word to pass Hallelujah
[46:48] because there's not a man that he should
[46:50] lie
[46:52] amen hallelujah that's so good so here
[46:56] in the scripture I want to just move
[46:59] real quickly into that of verse 9 and I
[47:01] want to just draw one verse from here
[47:03] tonight or one word on the left hand
[47:07] where he doth work but I
[47:11] cannot Behold
[47:13] Him He hideth himself on the right hand
[47:16] that I cannot see him probably every one
[47:19] of us whether you like art or not or
[47:22] you've had to go through some place of
[47:24] some art museum or and there's something
[47:26] that you're able to look at a picture a
[47:28] sculpture you know even that we look at
[47:31] with
[47:31] Michelangelo it wasn't the whole public
[47:35] was standing there viewing him
[47:39] sculpted he got a chunk of marble like
[47:42] how brother Ronnie preached it when he
[47:43] was here and I like how Michelangelo as
[47:46] well as other sculptors make this
[47:48] statement that what they saw inside of
[47:51] that chunk of
[47:53] marble Michelangelo said he saw saw
[47:55] Moses other sculptors say whomever
[47:57] they're going to do and it says it was I
[48:00] was commissioned to release him from
[48:03] that chunk of
[48:04] marel that's exactly what God has come
[48:07] to do is to release us from all of our
[48:12] previous moldings Hallelujah shaping
[48:16] amen and he removes and he works in our
[48:18] life but let me just tell you this right
[48:20] here your work the work of God in your
[48:23] life is not a public show
[48:26] good preaching that's right come on now
[48:29] it's an individual work between you and
[48:32] God hallelujah If You're Expecting just
[48:36] when I show up to church God come and
[48:38] work on me it's a daily Moment by moment
[48:41] hour by our work as a matter of fact the
[48:44] greatest deal of work is what takes
[48:46] place with between you and God when
[48:49] nobody else sees hallu thank you Lord
[48:53] yes
[48:54] sir so you know I know sometimes I've
[48:56] been places where you know I can
[48:58] remember back in the days when you go to
[49:00] SeaWorld when that was still open and
[49:01] they would uh have those Lumber jaacks
[49:04] out there them guys with chainsaws would
[49:06] carve out of the wood you know whatever
[49:08] it was they made they Bears sometimes
[49:10] and other things then I've watched them
[49:12] over in uh whatever you call those days
[49:15] is it pioneer days at Vermillion mollow
[49:18] I've watched them carve out uh um out of
[49:21] the ice blocks you know they'll take
[49:23] things and and carve things out of the
[49:24] ice blocks and what or more they
[49:26] wouldn't want to see what I would carve
[49:27] out cuz I don't have that kind of a gift
[49:30] not only to see it but you know to to
[49:32] carve it out but I just want to say all
[49:34] of those we had Spectators watching us
[49:37] right but I want to say this to you
[49:40] tonight that even though here we are
[49:42] right in the midst of a body of
[49:45] Believers here we are in the midst of
[49:47] our family here we are in the midst of
[49:49] our job but God is doing a work in your
[49:54] life and God allows glimpses of that as
[49:59] he sees fit Hallelujah and as a matter
[50:02] of fact there's many glimpses about your
[50:05] life that you don't even see that's good
[50:07] pre but God allows somebody else to
[50:09] testify that's
[50:13] good yes
[50:15] sir so I want to deal with that actually
[50:18] that latter part of that that that that
[50:20] you know verse and I told you this is
[50:22] going to come forth well it's going to
[50:24] be more than three parts I take that but
[50:26] when we look at this and it'll be a lot
[50:28] with the left hand here and but I cannot
[50:31] notice what job said I cannot Behold Him
[50:35] that word behold is the word to see or
[50:38] perceive to look behold to prophesy to
[50:42] see as a seer in the estatic state in
[50:46] that realm of vision I can't Behold Him
[50:49] remember job was a
[50:51] prophet in other words he's working but
[50:54] I don't know what he's doing that's good
[50:56] preacher I can't see him right and
[50:57] remember that's what the prophet said
[50:59] was making job
[51:01] worry because that's how God spoke to
[51:04] job was by
[51:08] Revelation that's so good I want to just
[51:11] work through here just a moment in
[51:13] Ezekiel 1:3 the Bible says the word of
[51:16] the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the
[51:19] priest the son of busai in the land of
[51:21] the caldas by the river Jabar and the
[51:24] Hand of the Lord was there upon him now
[51:27] watch what happens and I looked and
[51:29] behold a whirlwind came out of the North
[51:32] a great cloud and a fire infolding
[51:34] itself and a brightness was about it and
[51:37] out of the midst thereof is the color of
[51:39] amber out of the midst of the fire but
[51:42] Sam what are you saying I'm saying
[51:44] unless even though Ezekiel was a prophet
[51:47] with the word of the Lord came the hand
[51:49] of the Lord and when that comes together
[51:52] then Visions begin to open then sight is
[51:56] given in the hand of the Lord so the
[52:00] spirit in Ezekiel 3:14 so the spirit
[52:03] lifted me up and took me away and I went
[52:05] in bitterness In the Heat of my spirit
[52:07] but the hand of the Lord was strong upon
[52:10] me at that time Ezekiel was to let them
[52:12] know that they had to take account for
[52:15] their own lives in verse 22 and the Hand
[52:18] of the Lord was there upon me and he
[52:20] said unto me arise go forth into the
[52:22] plain and I will there talk with thee
[52:25] and it came to pass in the sixth year in
[52:28] the sixth month in the fifth day of the
[52:30] month as I sat in my house and the
[52:32] Elders of Judah sat before me that the
[52:34] hand of the Lord God fell there upon me
[52:39] in Ezekiel 371 the hand of the Lord was
[52:42] upon me and carried me out in the spirit
[52:46] of the Lord and set me down in the midst
[52:48] of the valley which was full of Bones I
[52:50] I'm not going through all these passages
[52:52] but I'm just trying to make a point here
[52:55] here tonight that is the hand of the
[52:57] Lord there's a purpose when the hand of
[52:59] the Lord comes upon your
[53:02] life and the Hand of the Lord was here
[53:05] breaking forth in that realm that he
[53:07] says as job said he's working but I
[53:10] cannot Behold Him and Ezekiel didn't
[53:14] make this happen but Ezekiel was in a
[53:18] place that the hand of the Lord could
[53:21] come upon him you see that's what's
[53:23] important is being in a place that the
[53:25] hand of the Lord can come upon you
[53:28] that's why we want our lives lined up
[53:30] with the word of all that we can know
[53:33] Lord I Want My Life lined up with your
[53:35] word because when it's lined up with
[53:37] God's word and it takes his grace to
[53:40] help us and to direct us if there's
[53:42] things that's beyond our understanding
[53:44] or knowledge of it and when we're lined
[53:46] up we're in position for the hand of the
[53:49] Lord to move Upon Our Lives let me just
[53:52] say it to you like this if the hand of
[53:54] the Lord carried Ezekiel and showed him
[53:57] the valley of dry bones and showed him
[54:00] what looked like an impossibility where
[54:03] there would be Bones come together and
[54:06] not only bones but flesh and senu and
[54:09] muscle and then there would be life that
[54:11] would come into that body that same hand
[54:14] of the Lord is upon your life tonight
[54:18] has come upon this generation not to
[54:20] give you a vision of defeat but a vision
[54:24] of victory a vision to let you know
[54:27] you're more than a conqueror and you are
[54:30] his
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:34] workmanship Hallelujah yes
[54:37] sir
[54:39] Hallelujah BR says like this an
[54:41] impersonation of Christianity I love
[54:42] this quote said God likened the prophet
[54:45] to the
[54:46] eagle that would go into the makeup of a
[54:48] prophet he's a Seer and in the spirit he
[54:51] climbs beyond the emotion of the church
[54:54] he goes beyond the rhythm of the music
[54:58] he goes beyond the Clapping of the hand
[55:00] he goes beyond the joy among the saints
[55:03] he goes beyond all that what does it a
[55:06] prophet God brings him up into a realm
[55:11] alone alone then he opens his eye and he
[55:16] lets him look around and see things that
[55:20] is to come then he brings him back down
[55:24] among the members of the body to forell
[55:26] them of what is in the
[55:31] making so good are you hearing me yes
[55:34] sir to tell them of what's in the
[55:38] making these visions that I read to you
[55:41] even out of the Book of Ezekiel a number
[55:44] of them even with the valley of dried
[55:47] bones we understand that spiritually
[55:49] speaks of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[55:51] we're standing in that hour right now
[55:53] but that also speaks of the the house of
[55:56] Israel is that right think about how
[55:59] many how many years and years ago that
[56:01] was but a prophet and look Moses was
[56:04] taken up was he not he was caught up
[56:07] into the clowns that right Paul said I
[56:09] was caught up into the third heaven John
[56:11] on the Book of Revelation he got into
[56:13] the spirit and he saw the coming of the
[56:16] lord well did he see the coming of the
[56:18] Lord he saw the coming of the holy ghost
[56:22] in a bride body he saw the coming of the
[56:25] Lord he saw the climax of it all what
[56:28] did that it took God to raise up a
[56:31] prophet and open his eye amen well why
[56:34] did God get that prophet and open his
[56:36] eye it is not for the prophet's benefit
[56:39] that's for you that's for me why God
[56:42] sends a prophet is not to show off God
[56:45] sends a prophet to deliver a word to a
[56:49] predestinated people in that hour to
[56:51] announce to them the move is on and I'm
[56:55] working to bring my word to pass whether
[56:58] you feel it or not I'm still working
[57:02] amen amen BR said God he took Ezekiel
[57:06] far up he let him see 2600 years think
[57:09] of it a prophet is also a gift of
[57:11] knowledge no he's not just confined to
[57:13] that he like an attorney who studies the
[57:15] books and when you go to hire an
[57:17] attorney to plead your case he's only
[57:19] taking what he knows and you're paying
[57:20] him for what he knows to present your
[57:22] case before the judge I could preach on
[57:24] that but I've got to go now a gift of
[57:27] knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which
[57:29] goes up and finds out these things that
[57:31] are to come and brings them back down
[57:33] but they must compare with the Bible
[57:36] with the book if they're out of the book
[57:38] then then they're not received because
[57:39] the judge judges by the book you see so
[57:42] it must be on the
[57:46] word oh my God I could preach there for
[57:49] a minute too but I just I I got to go on
[57:52] you see because this is where brother
[57:53] Bram says prophecy is to be judged by
[57:56] two or three but nobody sets before a
[57:59] prophet God's already
[58:01] Vindicated what are you saying brother
[58:02] Samuel I'm not God as I've said it over
[58:05] and over for for years that God has not
[58:08] called me to take my time to try to
[58:10] prove and authenticate
[58:12] statements God himself has Vindicated
[58:15] this
[58:16] message you understand we got to
[58:18] recognize the devil at every one of his
[58:20] tactics Satan when love our time is
[58:23] precious the Bible said redeeming our
[58:26] time notice the word of God has been
[58:29] spoken before the foundation of the
[58:31] world I watch watch this now with the
[58:33] prophet it isn't that God speaks and
[58:36] says something to the prophet at that
[58:39] time it is the prophet catches what God
[58:43] has already
[58:46] said for the word was before the
[58:49] foundation of the world God spoke the
[58:53] word and it's laying look at that and
[58:55] it's laying way out stretched out in
[58:58] time and the prophet goes up and sees
[59:02] the time coming so it's only a gift of
[59:06] knowledge that he brings it down and
[59:07] puts it on paper and I Daniel understood
[59:12] by the
[59:13] books aren't you glad for the
[59:16] books amen notice this in Proverbs 29:
[59:21] 18 when there is no vision
[59:25] the people perish or become loose or
[59:30] naked this very word perish is the same
[59:33] word of what Aaron and them did when
[59:36] they presented the golden calf they made
[59:39] the people naked how by taking another
[59:43] way God provides the weding Garment God
[59:47] provides the robe of righteousness God
[59:49] himself has provided our wedding
[59:53] garment is that right and to deny that
[59:55] and turn away from it is nakedness and
[59:58] then one is left to their own devices
[1:00:00] they're left to their own reasonings oh
[1:00:03] friends we are a blessed people that
[1:00:06] we're not walking by our own reasonings
[1:00:08] anymore you know what that means that
[1:00:11] means you don't have to guess about the
[1:00:13] Holy Ghost God has made it real and sure
[1:00:16] in this hour God Knocking at Your Heart
[1:00:19] it's a sure promise you're included in
[1:00:21] it just open up and receive it
[1:00:26] where there's no vision the people
[1:00:30] perish so without a vision you know
[1:00:32] Visions leadership and God has given a
[1:00:35] clear leadership in his
[1:00:37] promise that's why you see when God has
[1:00:40] done something that is so promised in
[1:00:43] the word this message is not outside of
[1:00:45] the
[1:00:46] word if it was we wouldn't be for
[1:00:50] it but this is God's word as a matter of
[1:00:54] let me call it just like this it's the
[1:00:57] secret that God mentioned and declared
[1:01:00] in his word and he laid it out in Tights
[1:01:03] laid it out in Shadows and he laid it
[1:01:06] out even in Luke 17 among other many
[1:01:09] other places that even thus shall it be
[1:01:12] in the day when the son of man is
[1:01:14] revealed it's a secret Hallelujah and
[1:01:17] yet it's happening I mean our doors are
[1:01:19] not closed to anybody coming in here
[1:01:22] right our desire is Lord that all would
[1:01:25] know the same Liberty that God has
[1:01:28] brought into my life that they would
[1:01:31] know the Lord Jesus in the same saving
[1:01:34] Soul cleansing way that he has touched
[1:01:37] my life that he's a living reality that
[1:01:39] it's not it's not I that live in but
[1:01:41] it's Christ that liveth in
[1:01:44] me but it's a
[1:01:46] secret yet God has opened that secret
[1:01:49] amen but remember in the scripture where
[1:01:51] it says my people perish for a lack of
[1:01:53] knowledge
[1:01:54] and the next phrase of that is because
[1:01:57] they reject the
[1:01:59] knowledge what is the knowledge the
[1:02:01] knowledge of the truth what is the
[1:02:02] knowledge of the truth it's the person
[1:02:04] of Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ it's the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:09] word they reject that but oh I'm glad I
[1:02:14] I'm thankful that it wasn't nothing that
[1:02:15] I had anything to do with Brother Sam
[1:02:18] you had to make a choice but my choice
[1:02:20] reflected a choice that was made before
[1:02:22] the foundation of the world Amen
[1:02:25] are you with me you you say oh brother
[1:02:26] Samuel well what does that have to do
[1:02:28] because it's putting it all in God's
[1:02:30] hands if you take it and put it in your
[1:02:32] hands then you've got the rest of your
[1:02:34] walk in your hands but when you can see
[1:02:36] predestination the right way you
[1:02:38] recognize you're not here but accident I
[1:02:41] don't care what Mom and Dad if
[1:02:43] whatever's been told to you I was an
[1:02:45] accident you're not an
[1:02:48] accident even if the way that you came
[1:02:51] into this Earth may not have been a way
[1:02:54] that would have been celebrated but the
[1:02:56] seed itself Still Remains
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:01] true Hallelujah yes sir prise the Lord
[1:03:06] that's why the prophet could say it like
[1:03:08] this in six-fold purpose of Gabriel's
[1:03:10] visit to Daniel they're talking about
[1:03:12] this end time message there's a power
[1:03:15] and a vision behind it a word of God
[1:03:18] that's been revealed to get the church
[1:03:20] in order for the Rapture and the going
[1:03:23] home
[1:03:25] I'm grateful for the hand of the Lord
[1:03:29] God has showed even in think of it in
[1:03:32] this age we're living in we have went
[1:03:35] from horse and buggy right to automobile
[1:03:39] to airplane to Astron right there have
[1:03:42] been four stages in one
[1:03:46] age that's amazing yes sir and God
[1:03:51] promised there would come he let it be
[1:03:53] shown in in the natural that here where
[1:03:56] you had that of the astronaut where it
[1:03:59] escaped the hold of the earth they they
[1:04:02] they they were able to get into that to
[1:04:05] that rocket to get into that ship that
[1:04:07] shuttle however you want to say it and
[1:04:09] they were able to have the throttle
[1:04:11] power that was needed with the fuel that
[1:04:14] would be able to thrust it so that it
[1:04:17] would be able to escape the gravitation
[1:04:20] and be able to move beyond that of the
[1:04:22] earth and to look down on it wow and God
[1:04:26] in this hour yes he had promised an
[1:04:29] astronaut and God has supplied and that
[1:04:32] astronut is none under none other than
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ himself revealed in the
[1:04:37] message of Malachi 4 that he's the same
[1:04:40] God you say how is he revealed because
[1:04:42] he's not bound and Tied by the Creeds
[1:04:45] and dogmas of a man he's not held by the
[1:04:48] gravitational pull of a seminary or a
[1:04:51] Doctrine but it is that which has
[1:04:53] escaped all of those boundaries oh my
[1:04:56] and just as that word has been presented
[1:04:58] to you and I it's to announce to you and
[1:05:01] I the countdown and all is on and we are
[1:05:05] astronauts in him yes sir brother and
[1:05:09] sister we're not just escaping
[1:05:12] denominationalism we're escaping our own
[1:05:15] selves that's
[1:05:19] right greatest b f brother said God's
[1:05:22] calling Abraham's seed to se from seed
[1:05:24] taste feel smell here conscience memory
[1:05:26] reason affection to walk completely
[1:05:29] relying on
[1:05:32] God Lord I'm talking about astronauts
[1:05:35] who not going to be held down by
[1:05:36] memories of the failure not held down by
[1:05:40] reasoning not held down but released and
[1:05:43] free in
[1:05:46] God this is why when this message that
[1:05:48] we're under in Revelations 18 when it
[1:05:52] speaks of that great and mighty angel
[1:05:54] that came down and that strong Angel
[1:05:57] began to Proclaim Babylon Babylon the
[1:05:59] greatest fallen and then it goes on to
[1:06:02] say in verse four and I heard another
[1:06:06] voice from Heaven saying come out of her
[1:06:09] my people and be not a partakers of and
[1:06:13] receive don't be a partaker of her sins
[1:06:15] and don't receive any of her plagues
[1:06:17] brother BR says it clearly I I love this
[1:06:19] as it brings it into the Highlight that
[1:06:21] that messenger's voice not the human
[1:06:24] voice but God sounded it through a human
[1:06:27] vessel and that voice was so inclined
[1:06:31] with God that heaven echoed the same
[1:06:34] thing why because this message is not a
[1:06:37] message of Earthly origin it's a message
[1:06:40] of heavenly origin brother Samuel I
[1:06:43] thought we're in job 23 that's what I'm
[1:06:45] preaching on here tonight if you can
[1:06:47] recognize that it's we are not living
[1:06:50] under the means of an Earthly work you
[1:06:53] are Birth by Heavenly work of almighty
[1:06:57] God it's God bringing his word to pass
[1:07:00] and what he's doing he's not fumbling
[1:07:02] around and figuring it out as he goes
[1:07:05] That's you and
[1:07:06] me we figure it out as we go oh I got to
[1:07:09] go home deepo for this oh I better call
[1:07:11] brother so for this I got it overhead
[1:07:13] God ain't fumbling
[1:07:14] around though we may not see it or
[1:07:19] understand it he still working he's
[1:07:22] right on time
[1:07:25] [Music]
[1:07:28] that's good let me read that again in
[1:07:30] job 23:9 on the left hand where he does
[1:07:32] work but I cannot Behold
[1:07:35] Him we can't always see what God's doing
[1:07:39] right we'd like to let's just be honest
[1:07:42] like job we'd like to Oh Brother Samuel
[1:07:45] I'm not a prophet though I
[1:07:47] know but I want you to understand the
[1:07:50] prophet said once you've been born of
[1:07:52] the spirit of God you are our citizen
[1:07:54] citizen of two
[1:07:57] Dimensions he said now you have opened
[1:07:59] you have come into a place to receive
[1:08:01] Angelic
[1:08:03] visitations Revelation book of symbols
[1:08:06] for the spirit of God to come and reveal
[1:08:08] his word to you don't you realize it is
[1:08:10] not when you stand here and say oh
[1:08:11] brother so- and so preach that it was
[1:08:13] brother so- and so that revealed it it's
[1:08:15] God that reveals it it's God that opens
[1:08:18] understanding just like God catches the
[1:08:20] prophet up then opens his eyes that he
[1:08:23] can see the same way God does the
[1:08:25] messenger is the same way he does you
[1:08:28] and I and he does it just as we have
[1:08:32] need of
[1:08:36] it God don't always let us know every
[1:08:39] little step of the way kind of like you
[1:08:40] know you or me or somebody's planning a
[1:08:42] party for somebody else a birthday party
[1:08:43] like hey you got this you got that you
[1:08:45] got this you got that you got this and
[1:08:46] you're planning every step of the way
[1:08:48] God already has this already planned
[1:08:50] out but he's not letting you and I know
[1:08:53] every step of the the
[1:08:54] way God doesn't need our assistance he
[1:08:58] just needs us to be yielded in his hands
[1:09:01] amen because God has such a authentic
[1:09:03] way of proving his word that it must be
[1:09:06] him doing it through surrendered vessels
[1:09:08] so it's undeniable that's God it's
[1:09:11] undeniable when you can look and say
[1:09:13] it's God it ain't
[1:09:17] me oh my so think of it you know even
[1:09:20] how the prophet remember when brother
[1:09:21] Bram went to pray for that that that
[1:09:24] that little lady that was dying with
[1:09:25] that ureic poison she had you know was
[1:09:27] carrying a child and things like that
[1:09:29] remember that just a long story short of
[1:09:32] how that uh when brother Brandon have
[1:09:34] prayed for and the Lord went ahead and
[1:09:37] took her home remember brother brand
[1:09:38] told the Lord you owe me an
[1:09:44] explanation brother brah said don't ever
[1:09:46] say that to
[1:09:48] God he said God don't owe you
[1:09:52] nothing he said he don't mean nothing
[1:09:55] glory be to God he said he let he let me
[1:09:58] just sit and stew about it for a
[1:10:01] while oh my I'm glad those examples are
[1:10:04] included in there I'm real real glad BL
[1:10:07] Samu don't that trouble you no not a bit
[1:10:11] the humanity of brother bam don't bother
[1:10:13] me I only lets me see God more
[1:10:16] clearly are you with me that's the same
[1:10:19] way in you and me but sometimes we
[1:10:21] determine our Victory based on our
[1:10:24] Humanity in your Humanity you'll never
[1:10:26] be victorious but it's in Christ it's
[1:10:30] his spirit in you it's you in the inside
[1:10:33] that's the Overcomer that has to wrestle
[1:10:36] with yourself wrestle with your thoughts
[1:10:38] and bring this outer man into subjection
[1:10:44] constantly and God don't tell His
[1:10:46] prophets everything he
[1:10:48] does think about think about it if God
[1:10:51] would have told Jacob hey your boy they
[1:10:54] ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:10:56] liars I'll tell you where he's at he's a
[1:10:58] Prophet come on God told Samuel Saul
[1:11:01] you'll find you'll find your your
[1:11:03] donkeys over there God knows where
[1:11:05] they're at right God knew where Joseph
[1:11:08] was at right are you hearing me but what
[1:11:11] if he' had told Jacob that buddy he'd
[1:11:13] have been in Egypt to get him come on
[1:11:15] which one of you is a parent oh oh
[1:11:17] brother Samuel Jacob would have just
[1:11:19] said God you've got some bigger plans
[1:11:21] God didn't tell Jacob got a bigger
[1:11:28] plan oh boy sometimes I'd like to be in
[1:11:31] on them Secrets wouldn't it it don't
[1:11:32] mean that it would stop us from nail
[1:11:34] biting right right but you see it still
[1:11:38] requires trust and faith even when we
[1:11:40] don't know what's taking place is that
[1:11:43] right now God doesn't tell them
[1:11:44] everything but you know so when you
[1:11:47] think of this of how let me just read
[1:11:49] this how brother BR says and I've have
[1:11:50] heard but now I see I love this message
[1:11:52] he said job was a prophet in this day
[1:11:54] and the only thing God had done to job
[1:11:56] was always give him wisdom and his word
[1:11:59] and inspiration he could get no
[1:12:03] inspiration but he knowed all of his
[1:12:06] mechanics he had offered the burnt
[1:12:08] offering he had done everything he
[1:12:10] knowed to do was right that's what's
[1:12:14] important I I could probably ask all
[1:12:16] throughout this congregation who who
[1:12:18] desires to see God move in your life
[1:12:20] this is the very basis of where you
[1:12:22] check if you know know that you've got
[1:12:24] everything right as far as what God has
[1:12:27] showed
[1:12:28] you then you can stand waiting for
[1:12:31] inspiration on are you hearing me it's
[1:12:34] just like coming to be prayed for if you
[1:12:36] got sin in your life God will never move
[1:12:38] over top of that sin anything that's
[1:12:41] unconfessed that's why even in the
[1:12:43] giving of the Holy Ghost unless there is
[1:12:46] that part on the inside that really is
[1:12:49] dying and death to self that complete
[1:12:52] death it will never never
[1:12:54] come but let me just tell you something
[1:12:57] if he had to lead the first lamb to the
[1:12:59] slaughter what makes you think he's
[1:13:01] going to do you any different he had to
[1:13:03] lead me to slaughter he had to lead you
[1:13:06] you understand it goes back to what we
[1:13:08] said on Sunday God has never done
[1:13:10] anything that asked you to do that he
[1:13:12] had do
[1:13:13] himself that's that's why brother Bram
[1:13:16] could say when he came to the River
[1:13:17] Jordan to be baptized brother Ram says
[1:13:19] notice he was already the lamb
[1:13:24] right brother B says I wonder sometimes
[1:13:27] when the words going forth wonder he
[1:13:29] says when God is ready to pour out of
[1:13:31] his Spirit he said I wonder if it's
[1:13:33] because we're not being
[1:13:36] Lambs because the spirit of the dove
[1:13:39] will always come to the lamb Oh Brother
[1:13:42] Sam are you saying I'm not a lamb no I'm
[1:13:44] just saying sometimes you allow that
[1:13:46] wolf to rule over that right there but
[1:13:48] as a lamb you've got to recognize who
[1:13:49] you are and recognize what belongs to
[1:13:51] you and say God lead me to the slaughter
[1:13:54] lead me to the place that nothing else
[1:13:57] matters outside of
[1:14:01] you but he couldn't get a look at this
[1:14:04] but he couldn't get a word from God oh I
[1:14:06] love that this this is what I love not
[1:14:08] that he couldn't get a word from God I
[1:14:09] love this next part but the devil
[1:14:11] couldn't move him
[1:14:13] right he couldn't get a word no vision
[1:14:16] breaking no inspiration hey what's going
[1:14:18] on I don't know right I don't know hey
[1:14:21] but you're a prophet I don't know see
[1:14:23] added pressure you're a prophet you've
[1:14:25] helped me out before God's used you to
[1:14:27] help me out God's used you to show but
[1:14:29] what's he doing I don't know I don't
[1:14:31] know what he's
[1:14:33] doing but he couldn't move job off of
[1:14:36] the Revelation amen that he had in his
[1:14:40] heart given by God you understand what
[1:14:43] that was the right hand of God that in
[1:14:46] the midst of that time while the left
[1:14:48] hand is working the right hand David
[1:14:50] said upholdeth me
[1:14:54] Glory watch out brother BR brings us
[1:14:56] down to Everyday living there you are
[1:14:58] when you're prayed for you don't have to
[1:15:00] run back through a line or go let
[1:15:02] somebody else pray for you when you know
[1:15:05] you've done exactly what God told you to
[1:15:07] do see then wait for that channel of
[1:15:12] inspiration to open to you now I'm
[1:15:15] Healed and when it drops in there it's
[1:15:17] all over you don't need no prayer lines
[1:15:19] nothing else it's over it's been
[1:15:21] revealed to you
[1:15:30] oh my
[1:15:32] my Bri let if you would skip
[1:15:36] to there's a paragraph there it starts
[1:15:38] out with the
[1:15:39] word when no wait wait wait
[1:15:46] wait uh yeah go back up to the word
[1:15:48] where it says but but he alone talking
[1:15:52] of job here
[1:15:55] but he alone job knew he was right his
[1:15:58] pulsation of faith of hearing God's word
[1:16:01] speak to him he knew it was the
[1:16:04] truth he knew God's voice nobody could
[1:16:08] fool him on it for he knew it not even
[1:16:11] all of his
[1:16:13] friends quoting
[1:16:17] scripture but job knew there's a
[1:16:19] difference are you understanding me
[1:16:21] there's a difference between just
[1:16:23] written word and God's
[1:16:25] voice God's mind is his word is that
[1:16:29] right this is his will but it's not left
[1:16:32] open to interpretation Amen in other
[1:16:35] words God didn't put it in the hands of
[1:16:37] man for man to try to apply it the way
[1:16:39] he feels like he should apply it but God
[1:16:41] himself him he comes down and he shows
[1:16:44] us how to apply it that's why we're
[1:16:47] living in an hour whatsoever the son the
[1:16:50] father doeth that doeth the son likewise
[1:16:53] amen God opening and revealing himself
[1:16:55] showing you and I where to apply the
[1:16:58] word and how to apply it that's friends
[1:17:00] I just tell you as simple as I can say
[1:17:02] it we wouldn't even know how to cross a
[1:17:05] fence if God hadn't given us Grace in
[1:17:07] this hour
[1:17:09] amen the simplest of things that we
[1:17:12] could see would be so simple and yet it
[1:17:14] lays right there and God comes right
[1:17:16] forth and reveals it thank you Jesus
[1:17:20] watch this watch this statement he said
[1:17:22] watch something's revealed to you maybe
[1:17:24] contrary to what the people think watch
[1:17:27] what he says now I'm speaking in the
[1:17:29] line of
[1:17:31] prophets CU prophets are speaking the
[1:17:34] thoughts of God it might seem contrary
[1:17:37] to the thinking of man but remember a
[1:17:39] prophet is caught
[1:17:42] Beyond how many ever tried to see inside
[1:17:45] a circus or
[1:17:47] something you tried to see inside
[1:17:49] somewhere come on everybody in here has
[1:17:51] tried one time or another tried to see
[1:17:53] into something and we're sitting
[1:17:56] there and then you get one of the tall
[1:17:58] lanky boys you know and they get up
[1:18:00] there and they can you know a little bit
[1:18:03] more but you see a
[1:18:05] prophet is where the ring Master himself
[1:18:08] of the circus comes out gets a hold of
[1:18:11] him and lifts him up so a prophet ain't
[1:18:15] lifted up there by his own strength amen
[1:18:18] he didn't bring himself up there and he
[1:18:20] has to wait until God gets done showing
[1:18:22] him all he wants to show him and when he
[1:18:24] gets done showing him all he wants to
[1:18:26] show him he wants him to turn around and
[1:18:28] tell the others what he has saw and when
[1:18:32] that's told it'll have an effect upon
[1:18:34] the others
[1:18:37] am that's the power behind this message
[1:18:40] brother that's why it has a power behind
[1:18:43] it a vision behind it that's why it has
[1:18:45] an effect Upon Our Lives let me go on
[1:18:48] here when when it's God reveals
[1:18:50] something if there ever is a secret
[1:18:53] comes out from God to be know made known
[1:18:54] to the people it'll never come through a
[1:18:56] seminary it'll never come through a
[1:18:58] group of people never did it always will
[1:19:01] has and will through one individual a
[1:19:04] prophet Amos 3:7 the Lord does nothing
[1:19:10] except first he reveals it through His
[1:19:14] prophets right that is a powerful
[1:19:18] important
[1:19:20] verse God ain't going to work
[1:19:23] he ain't going to work out nothing
[1:19:26] unless he spoke it through His prophets
[1:19:29] and when God speaks it he is speaking of
[1:19:32] what is already a finished work I'm
[1:19:35] going to bring this to
[1:19:37] pass don't expect it to
[1:19:43] be Lord I want a lot of right-hand days
[1:19:47] the bulk of your journey is a left-hand
[1:19:49] Journey it's God working working working
[1:19:52] working working working brother Samuel I
[1:19:57] need rightand days just take a look
[1:19:58] around you're standing aren't
[1:20:02] you that's his right hand it's the power
[1:20:05] of God it's holding you in the midst of
[1:20:07] all the working if his life if your life
[1:20:10] was not in his hands you wouldn't be
[1:20:12] able to stand the first test the first
[1:20:14] trial the first little thing comes along
[1:20:16] oh I got a hang nail when I open the
[1:20:17] bathroom door I ain't going to come back
[1:20:19] to church no more first little thing
[1:20:21] comes along but because the right hand
[1:20:24] is upon your life there's one that
[1:20:25] anchors you and holds you stabilizes you
[1:20:28] through the midst of the storm through
[1:20:30] the test and trial but the left hand is
[1:20:34] working God does nothing except first he
[1:20:37] reveals it let me just try to bring this
[1:20:40] down I want to just drop this in here as
[1:20:42] we look at this because all that God is
[1:20:44] working out in your life and my life I
[1:20:47] want you to remember these three words
[1:20:49] God has spoken
[1:20:51] right God ain't going to take it back
[1:20:55] God ain't going to say oops I made a
[1:20:57] mistake I should have never spoken that
[1:20:59] over this generation nope God has spoken
[1:21:03] amen amen this word has come to a
[1:21:05] predestinated people it's no accident
[1:21:07] that's right that it's come across your
[1:21:09] life that's right are you hearing me now
[1:21:12] I want you to consider this look at this
[1:21:14] for our own lives Hebrews 2:8 thou Hast
[1:21:17] put all things in subjection under his
[1:21:19] feet for in that he put all in sub
[1:21:22] ection under him he left what's that
[1:21:25] word
[1:21:27] nothing brother brother Dave's the only
[1:21:29] one with
[1:21:32] me if I had some kind of token or treat
[1:21:34] brother Dave he was right with
[1:21:37] me he left nothing that is not put under
[1:21:41] him right key but now we see not yet all
[1:21:46] things put under him you may not behold
[1:21:50] it or see it but it's already
[1:21:54] done all of everything it's all finished
[1:21:58] in him when he said it is
[1:22:01] finished
[1:22:04] amen but here's what we do see and this
[1:22:06] is what important but we see
[1:22:10] ourselves no that ain't important right
[1:22:13] but we see Jesus right well what do but
[1:22:17] we see Jesus yes the mighty conqueror
[1:22:20] who conquered both the scene and unseen
[1:22:23] Realms we see him who paid the price for
[1:22:26] us and who rose again and sent back the
[1:22:29] Holy Ghost we see him who is the mighty
[1:22:31] conqueror we see
[1:22:34] him and that's where we're looking amen
[1:22:38] hallelujah where am I looking I'm
[1:22:40] looking at a battle that cannot be lost
[1:22:44] why cuz both of his hands was nailed up
[1:22:47] and I'm in his hands and brother let me
[1:22:49] tell you they had to keep up Moses hands
[1:22:52] but those men got tired and they let
[1:22:54] them down but not the hands of our Lord
[1:22:56] Jesus they are not let down brother it's
[1:22:59] still standing in a banner of victory
[1:23:04] tonight we see
[1:23:08] Jesus
[1:23:11] amen oh
[1:23:14] my you see the Bible says in Revelations
[1:23:18] 1:16 I'm I'm coming
[1:23:21] down and he had in his right hand Seven
[1:23:26] Stars now what's John seeing the vision
[1:23:29] of the mighty
[1:23:32] conqueror he's seeing the coming of the
[1:23:35] Lord coming right in his bride body
[1:23:40] calling a people out of every age for
[1:23:43] his name sake like Joseph was given a
[1:23:47] gentile bride so is Christ Hallelujah
[1:23:50] taking a bride and he and he has upon
[1:23:54] his vesture a name that is called the
[1:23:57] word of God what did they call Joseph
[1:23:59] zapan panel which means the revealer of
[1:24:03] the secret things Hallelujah he had in
[1:24:06] his right hand Seven Stars right hand
[1:24:08] power and authority these Messengers
[1:24:12] these
[1:24:13] stars have all the power and authority
[1:24:16] of the godhead behind
[1:24:18] them brother Samuel what is that a
[1:24:21] message a word word that cannot
[1:24:26] fail a word that has not painted defeat
[1:24:30] to you that's right but it's painted
[1:24:33] Victory this ain't a pie in the sky
[1:24:35] remember a prophet goes beyond even the
[1:24:37] joy of the Saints goes beyond the music
[1:24:39] goes beyond the Clapping of the hands it
[1:24:41] goes beyond your emotions and you know
[1:24:43] what brother Samuel what are you saying
[1:24:44] by that I'm glad because it goes beyond
[1:24:46] even the times that I feel down it goes
[1:24:49] beyond the times that even that I may
[1:24:51] not feel feel like it it goes beyond
[1:24:54] that this is a word that is not based on
[1:24:57] your feelings this vision is not based
[1:24:59] on your Humanity of whether you can make
[1:25:02] it come to pass this is thus saith the
[1:25:04] Lord your emotions God has called a
[1:25:07] message up and announced it to you and
[1:25:11] I if you could take it tonight I don't
[1:25:13] care where you're sitting at tonight if
[1:25:16] you could take whatever promise of God
[1:25:18] and you take a hold of that promise let
[1:25:19] it take a hold of you and you let that
[1:25:21] word it power and authority behind it
[1:25:24] let me tell you something friends it'll
[1:25:25] begin to move your thoughts right now
[1:25:27] it'll begin to divor cause you to
[1:25:29] divorce thoughts of doubt and defeat and
[1:25:32] skepticism if you can receive it this
[1:25:35] word has transforming power within it
[1:25:38] brother it'll lift you beyond your
[1:25:42] circumstances it'll let you see yourself
[1:25:45] Victorious but s you don't know the
[1:25:47] condition I'm sitting in right now quit
[1:25:49] looking at your condition you'll never
[1:25:52] get anywhere that's right if you'll look
[1:25:55] to him that's acknowledging you need
[1:25:57] help that's right I need help Lord amen
[1:26:01] he's my helper
[1:26:08] am and when I saw
[1:26:11] him I fell at his feet as
[1:26:15] dead and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:26:19] saying unto me now notice when the right
[1:26:21] hand came upon him there was something
[1:26:24] to be said fear
[1:26:28] not I am the first and the last I am he
[1:26:33] that liveth and was dead and behold I'm
[1:26:37] alive forever more and have the keys of
[1:26:40] hell and of
[1:26:42] death oh brother brandom could say it
[1:26:45] like that what is there to fear the
[1:26:47] Judgment that fell upon him at the cross
[1:26:49] at the grave and when he descended was
[1:26:51] for us he absorbed the full brunt of the
[1:26:54] wound of sin and there is therefore now
[1:26:56] no condemnation to them which are in
[1:26:58] Christ Jesus for aurity he is our
[1:27:01] attorney he is our judge he is both
[1:27:04] attorney and judge and as a judge what
[1:27:06] better what what come on Friends what
[1:27:08] better could you get he was a judge came
[1:27:11] down and became our
[1:27:16] attorney God became
[1:27:19] flesh and paid the price am amen can I
[1:27:23] say it like the prophet said it in the
[1:27:25] token case
[1:27:27] dismissed that's what this message is an
[1:27:30] announcement case
[1:27:33] dismissed if you allow the Holy Spirit

[1:28:11] yours as I stand in your midst I love
[1:28:14] this I have not come to bring fear and
[1:28:20] failure laid his right hand upon me I
[1:28:23] have not come to bring fear and failure
[1:28:26] brother samel I'm I'm feeling fearful
[1:28:28] listen the presence of God has not come
[1:28:30] to make you fearful and listen don't be
[1:28:32] afraid of the very thing you need to
[1:28:35] embrace the very thing that'll relieve
[1:28:38] you of fear the very thing then when
[1:28:39] fear wants to try to come into your life
[1:28:42] when doctor's reports and anything else
[1:28:43] come you've got a strength that'll put P
[1:28:46] fear back in its place and say you're
[1:28:48] Crossing on territory that's occupied by
[1:28:51] Divine love love there is no room for
[1:28:54] fear here get out what does that perfect
[1:28:58] love cast out fear it don't just ask it
[1:29:01] to leave it throws it out and I don't
[1:29:03] care where you land I don't care if you
[1:29:05] land on your head land on your nose land
[1:29:07] on your back it cast it out and that
[1:29:08] word cast out means you throw it behind
[1:29:11] your back and don't care where it
[1:29:13] lands I have not come to bring fear and
[1:29:16] failure but
[1:29:18] love and
[1:29:20] courage and ability
[1:29:23] won't you love him yes sir that's good
[1:29:28] let me end with
[1:29:29] this this point in thinking of our
[1:29:33] scripture
[1:29:35] tonight just because that God has not
[1:29:38] revealed what he is doing at the moment
[1:29:41] in your
[1:29:43] life around the bride think think of
[1:29:46] this to me this is overwhelming it
[1:29:47] really is to think about it of how God
[1:29:52] great our God is that he's
[1:29:55] working in individual lives amen now I
[1:30:00] don't know about you but to me when I
[1:30:02] tght school I wanted all the Ducks lined
[1:30:04] up in a row I don't want stragglers I
[1:30:07] don't want people playing in the
[1:30:08] classroom but how God has everything
[1:30:11] held right together where there's lives
[1:30:14] and justification sanctification and the
[1:30:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost God on Fret a
[1:30:19] bit you know why God's working all
[1:30:21] things
[1:30:23] after the counsel of his own will God's
[1:30:25] working think about it around the world
[1:30:29] the bride body is being brought into
[1:30:32] Perfection that's so good around the
[1:30:35] world believe in assemblies and in our
[1:30:40] individual
[1:30:42] life and God is working in your life
[1:30:45] working in my life listen friends as I I
[1:30:48] say it again I say it again by the word
[1:30:51] of the Lord no matter where you're at if
[1:30:53] God is working in your life stay with
[1:30:55] him and let him work it all
[1:30:59] out that's the
[1:31:01] trth don't get your eyes off of him keep
[1:31:04] your eyes on him he will continue to
[1:31:07] lead you all the way no matter what what
[1:31:11] what it is the vision is still in effect
[1:31:13] he's still working kind of like the song
[1:31:15] even when I don't see him he's still
[1:31:20] working amen
[1:31:23] right but BR would say it kind of like
[1:31:25] this and I
[1:31:27] just he talks about a dream that um
[1:31:31] brother Junior Jackson and you know
[1:31:32] brother Brown would put it like this he
[1:31:34] says now we don't he said there's been
[1:31:35] many dreams that brother Jackson has
[1:31:37] received he said of the Lord he said
[1:31:39] that is has come to pass he said but I
[1:31:41] don't know he said God's kept this from
[1:31:43] me it was when brother Jackson went
[1:31:45] clear to Louisiana when brother Bram was
[1:31:47] preaching him last few meetings he just
[1:31:49] woke up you know he woke up he seen the
[1:31:52] pillar of Fire coming in he he never
[1:31:53] been to the building at Life Tabernacle
[1:31:55] he just he saw a building the Lord
[1:31:57] showed him a building in a dream and saw
[1:31:58] a pillar of Fire coming in there and saw
[1:31:59] and heard thunderings going out and
[1:32:01] people were you know laying out on the
[1:32:03] ground and just you know giving their
[1:32:05] all to the Lord Brother Jackson at that
[1:32:08] time he got on a plane with his wife and
[1:32:11] they came down there said I don't know
[1:32:12] what's going to happen and brother
[1:32:13] brandham he just says it like this this
[1:32:15] is to me as a principle see brother
[1:32:17] brandom just because a dream itself is
[1:32:20] one of those things that just like no
[1:32:22] doubt there's others in here that's had
[1:32:23] dreams I've had dreams that that's been
[1:32:25] many times of an area the way that God
[1:32:27] has spoke to me with things in the
[1:32:28] church or things individually but I'll
[1:32:30] tell you any time there's been something
[1:32:31] coming I don't look at it it's thus
[1:32:33] sayith the Lord I just wait because if
[1:32:34] it's of God he'll bring it to pass and
[1:32:36] then he'll tap me on the shoulder and
[1:32:38] say this is what I showed you that's why
[1:32:40] he's worked with me but how brother
[1:32:42] brandham put that within a dream brother
[1:32:43] Bram once saying it was thus sayith the
[1:32:45] Lord but I this is something that's very
[1:32:47] important that with any word that's been
[1:32:49] given or anything and brother BR would
[1:32:51] say it like like this he says Dear God
[1:32:53] In Prayer just let me just refer to this
[1:32:56] dear God thou Hast kept it a secret from
[1:32:58] me about this dream what this means I
[1:33:00] don't know but if you shall visit us
[1:33:02] Lord prepare our hearts now for that
[1:33:08] visit oh wonderful
[1:33:10] wow I just think we can close on that
[1:33:13] part of
[1:33:14] it
[1:33:16] God has given a
[1:33:19] word that we never I just said like this
[1:33:22] I can I told you before I can remember
[1:33:24] sitting around with well I wasn't
[1:33:26] sitting around with Brother Ray and my
[1:33:27] dad then we Benjamin and I were playing
[1:33:29] with blocks on the floor not my Benjamin
[1:33:31] but Benjamin Ericson and
[1:33:34] um but they you know everybody looking
[1:33:37] look they've been looking for the coming
[1:33:38] of the
[1:33:39] Lord you'd hear you know I remember
[1:33:41] hearing a little boy where people
[1:33:43] thought man didn't think we'd be here
[1:33:44] either this year didn't think we'd see
[1:33:46] this year didn't think we'd see this
[1:33:48] year why because this is an end time
[1:33:53] message that God has promised and we're
[1:33:56] here right we don't know how many more
[1:34:01] moments that we have
[1:34:04] individually and collectively as the
[1:34:07] bride
[1:34:09] body but whatever God is doing and
[1:34:13] whatever it is that God is bringing to
[1:34:14] pass and it's his word that he's
[1:34:16] bringing to pass in our
[1:34:19] life I believe we all can join together
[1:34:21] with this tonight is Lord prepare my
[1:34:24] heart to be in a
[1:34:26] place for that inspiration to
[1:34:30] strike because one thing for sure this
[1:34:32] message is not a
[1:34:34] dream sir the Rapture is not a dream
[1:34:37] amen the Rapture is thus sayith the
[1:34:40] Lord and the prophet said the bride will
[1:34:43] be waiting on that Revelation amen she's
[1:34:47] walking under the effects of it now but
[1:34:50] there'll come a final quickening is that
[1:34:54] right so what do we want to do Lord let
[1:34:57] my heart be prepared for that
[1:35:00] moment and you know what he prepares our
[1:35:04] hearts when we don't feel it we don't
[1:35:09] see it we see not all things but we see
[1:35:13] Jesus amen amen and that's what's
[1:35:16] important is we see him the word because
[1:35:18] the word cannot fail amen don't you love
[1:35:22] him oh friends tonight commit thy way
[1:35:26] unto the Lord if you're when you look in
[1:35:28] your life be sure where you're standing
[1:35:31] and then when you're standing Look to
[1:35:33] Him Amen in those moments just like job
[1:35:35] I'm sure none of us are any different
[1:35:37] these are moments that the prophet said
[1:35:40] because job wasn't receiving inspiration
[1:35:43] it was
[1:35:44] worrying him anybody ever felt that way
[1:35:48] Lord I I'm just looking for an answer oh
[1:35:50] yes looking for an answer and it was
[1:35:52] worrying I I'm glad these these things
[1:35:54] are included in here that you and I can
[1:35:56] look at and say yep I'm I'm right on
[1:35:58] track I'm not an oddball it's right on
[1:36:00] track it doesn't mean that we welcome
[1:36:01] worrying but we just you know what God
[1:36:03] helps us to see you're still housed in
[1:36:05] this humanity and where he comes to help
[1:36:09] us to look Beyond this Humanity am
[1:36:14] that's why friends a message of Earthly
[1:36:16] origin could never have got us
[1:36:19] Beyond this right here
[1:36:22] it couldn't have got us Beyond it took a
[1:36:24] Heavenly message in this hour you know
[1:36:27] why it's time for Rapture that's right
[1:36:30] it's time for Rapture amen you love him
[1:36:34] let's pray
[1:36:37] father Lord I'm sure that throughout
[1:36:39] this building here
[1:36:41] tonight Lord that we have all been in
[1:36:45] those places and those moments even
[1:36:47] tonight Lord even tonight I I thank Lord
[1:36:50] as many times I stand and I preach
[1:36:54] sometimes Lord I stand and looking at
[1:36:56] things that we're presently
[1:36:59] Lord God seeing your
[1:37:01] grace Lord making yourself known to
[1:37:04] encourage us as your
[1:37:06] children experiences Lord that we passed
[1:37:09] through Lord I pray that God here
[1:37:13] tonight May Lord as we have just been
[1:37:17] graced by your presence for a few
[1:37:20] moments that Lord that we're are able to
[1:37:23] look Beyond of this realm and to Lord be
[1:37:29] able to look and to see the big picture
[1:37:31] now I Lord truthfully Lord I don't
[1:37:34] there's things Lord that even that I
[1:37:36] know you're working out in my life I
[1:37:37] don't see it I don't see it I don't know
[1:37:40] what you're doing there's things that we
[1:37:42] could Lord testify throughout this
[1:37:44] congregation Lord but father I think
[1:37:47] Lord what you've spoke to us
[1:37:50] tonight is to trust you that Lord when
[1:37:54] that Vision lord of the word has broken
[1:37:57] over our
[1:37:58] life it's things that Lord that you see
[1:38:01] the end from the beginning it's you
[1:38:04] working it out Lord Lord even this
[1:38:07] moment this moment it's a predestinated
[1:38:11] moment yeah Lord you would arrange
[1:38:13] things so particularly Lord even to move
[1:38:18] down lord to cause our our
[1:38:21] hearts to be inclined to your voice Lord
[1:38:27] that's what that's what we want Lord May
[1:38:30] every one of our hearts be
[1:38:32] inclined with your word
[1:38:34] Lord Lord I pray tonight Lord if there's
[1:38:38] one Lord outside of the fold if they're
[1:38:41] not even in that place of Journey May
[1:38:43] Lord it be a moment that God that they
[1:38:45] would
[1:38:46] see see you see what you have done for
[1:38:50] them what what you have made
[1:38:53] possible Lord God that may it grip their
[1:38:55] heart in conviction that would cause
[1:38:58] them to surrender to the vision of
[1:39:01] Calvary breaking forth over their life
[1:39:03] Lord surrender to the Mighty
[1:39:06] God lord I
[1:39:09] pray right here tonight Lord you've said
[1:39:12] it throughout the
[1:39:14] message that no matter Lord where that
[1:39:17] life is at in
[1:39:19] Journey May they keep walking with their
[1:39:22] eyes on you
[1:39:24] Lord May Lord it be that taking their
[1:39:27] the word that you're speaking Lord how
[1:39:30] could we even know unless Lord God you
[1:39:34] would speak to
[1:39:36] us they asked you on the day of
[1:39:39] Pentecost what must we do to be
[1:39:41] saved Lord many times we can rehearse
[1:39:44] those if we've sat Lord in a message
[1:39:47] church for years we can rehearse it
[1:39:51] sometimes lord it's where you help us to
[1:39:54] see the condition that was present in
[1:39:57] the heart of those individuals and that
[1:40:00] is Lambs that were led to the
[1:40:04] slaughter ready to die to their own
[1:40:10] selves not just want to remedy for the
[1:40:13] situation of the Sorrows they
[1:40:16] in but willing to
[1:40:19] forsake to lose as the scripture said
[1:40:22] their own
[1:40:25] [Music]
[1:40:26] life
[1:40:28] God I know you to be that
[1:40:30] personal I pray tonight Lord may we not
[1:40:33] be too
[1:40:35] big that Lord whatever it might be if
[1:40:37] it's a committal of a request may we be
[1:40:41] that simple to say
[1:40:44] Lord lead me to that place to where I
[1:40:47] can stop fretting about this problem
[1:40:50] stop worrying about it lord it's got me
[1:40:52] all worried but Lord
[1:40:55] God I'm going to give you thanks because
[1:40:57] you have answered every
[1:41:00] prayer in your own time there's been
[1:41:02] some prayers that I prayed that you
[1:41:03] haven't answered Abraham prayed for you
[1:41:06] to bless ishmail but you didn't answer
[1:41:08] it in the way that Abraham wanted it
[1:41:10] answered the Lord Jesus prayed let this
[1:41:13] cup pass from me I'm glad you didn't
[1:41:15] answer that
[1:41:16] prayer but you

[1:41:21] amen when it's lined up with your
[1:41:25] will Lord you've

[1:41:31] our lives where we can see you yeah Lord
[1:41:36] help
[1:41:37] us help us lord it's not an excuse but
[1:41:40] the Frailty of this flesh our spirit all
[1:41:44] of these things Lord as Abraham's seed
[1:41:46] we F the pool Lord to walk separate
[1:41:52] not to become bound and tied down by our
[1:41:55] five natural senses or five spiritual
[1:41:58] senses but to
[1:41:59] walk
[1:42:01] surrendered in obedience to the word of
[1:42:04] God lord Jesus we're not the achievement
[1:42:08] of any man no no our lives are not our
[1:42:11] own achievement that we've been able to
[1:42:13] get to this place no we're your
[1:42:16] workmanship we're your workmanship we
[1:42:19] are your achievement Lord that's it's
[1:42:23] you achieving in our lives what you have
[1:42:27] spoken oh father I pray tonight Lord
[1:42:31] God May Lord Jesus our
[1:42:34] prayer be just centered in that way with
[1:42:37] as the word
[1:42:39] Lord You Led disciples forth and you
[1:42:42] looked upon the field and you said pray
[1:42:43] and ask ye the Lord of harvest that he
[1:42:45] will send laborers into the
[1:42:47] vineyard Lord you are the Lord of
[1:42:49] harvest
[1:42:52] but you were letting them know what to
[1:42:54] ask they were going to be participants
[1:42:57] in that but they needed to ask you
[1:43:00] according to your
[1:43:01] will
[1:43:03] Lord we're not too big to ask you
[1:43:05] tonight Lord you didn't say we had to

[1:43:42] Revelation that's been given Lord in
[1:43:44] this hour not our own interpretation cuz
[1:43:46] that'll only that'll only confuse people
[1:43:49] but Lord God to hold you up cuz you said
[1:43:51] if I be lifted up Lord if there's one
[1:43:54] that needs to be exalted that's you
[1:43:56] that's the only one Lord that's the only
[1:44:00] one I think of like your Prophet when he
[1:44:03] Lord spoke about he was going to go talk
[1:44:05] to them who had that voice of healing
[1:44:07] magazine he said I think they're getting
[1:44:09] to a place they're putting too much
[1:44:10] emphasis on the man that God's
[1:44:13] using and not on Jesus
[1:44:16] Christ Lord
[1:44:18] Jesus it's you yes L when we look at in
[1:44:22] our
[1:44:23] lives that's what we see it's

[1:45:13] to reveal it to us now Lord I believe
[1:45:15] with all my heart if we we take this
[1:45:18] word we yield ourselves we give
[1:45:20] ourselves to this word Lord in praying
[1:45:22] over it
[1:45:23] Lord I believe God that you'll take
[1:45:26] us Beyond every barrier you'll take us
