TRANSCRIPT
========================================
our Bibles after a service like this we just close it up and just say well everybody was in the prince of God everybody got what they got no this is a time every meeting we have is where the Holy Spirit himself comes down and takes us like he did the disciples looks up on the field and said pray you the Lord of harvest that he will send laborers into the field because it's ripe for Harvest and brother Bram says he has placed us as partners with him and what does what does that mean that means that even as we leave from here I could have read you a quote here where brother Bram says when you go from church he says get your family together and have prayer he said do you just go from church and you don't go home and you don't pray you don't get the family together but get them together and have prayer if you haven't had devotions family altar get that together I encourage you to do that and not just within just that moment but listen friends it's a lot I I don't I don't my prayer is I don't want things to stay general for us I want it to be so specific it gets down to where we can take a hold of and say got it it's appliable so it's things where we sat down and I I've just I think I shared a little bit of this with you before when we come out of a service special services we've had Services we have I'll just start sharing things that God spoke to my heart I ask the boys what what is something that struck you right what struck your heart what is the thing hey what's a where's a what what's a scripture sometimes those things are just text to me and then we just go from there we'll go from there but still as we sit around and talk about it so it doesn't when we talk about sitting down with our family it doesn't mean that you've got to get the concordance out the Bible out and this out you lose them you lose them you have it has to come down in Simplicity and it's con it's it's application is everybody with me it's simple even as husband and wife there's nobody listen I got a I have a lot of a lot of fellowshipping with my brothers and sisters I've got a lot of got a lot of wonderful preacher buddies too but there is nobody that I love to fellowship around the things of God better than my wife oh man and fellowshipping of the things of the message of the hour and of the of the scripture the word there's nothing more precious than that and let me tell you something if we don't do it who is right if we don't win our children who will if we don't win our families who will that's right well brother Samuel that's God's responsibility I agree it is God who will give them the climax of the experience but God has entrusted you and I to be the source that wins them to the Lord and that winning to the Lord sometimes it comes in ways that we're not even thinking about it it starts out with just a little something here and there it may not even be maybe you've got a wayward hus Wayward husband maybe it's a wayward wife maybe it's a wayward son or daughter listen you you can't go right up to him and say hey let me tell you something let let me tell you this quote quote let me tell you this scripture scripture sometimes it just starts out with let me tell you what the Lord spoke to my heart is the Lord good hadn't the Lord given us a wonderful day that's right hadn't the Lord see it's showing he's the Lord of my life it's in simple simple things that they can see this guy has passion for what he believes this isn't something that just after church is over man it it's a passion now I'll say this it isn't that sometimes that we don't need to say just saying from my heart let me just kind a little bit good what's say honest confession is good for the soul this was a complaint in my household oh boy I got everybody sleeping man they awake now but this was my this was my complaint it it made its way through the gra Vine dad's devotion times turned into 30 minutes yeah you say well brother Samuel that shouldn't be a complaint I also have to be mindful there's other things that got to go on too but you know what I have found it's not about so much of that and the Lord's had to help me with that to where sometimes it's just dropping just a little bit I'll say this right here and that's it we'll just drop this maybe them speak a little bit maybe it's just discussion of of of some things things but because they've got school they may be got activities that they want to do too but there's just that little bit of time that says that through the whole cusp of the day Jesus is still the center right he's still everything in our lives amen amen he's everything you love him this morning amen amen I I believe you do I I pray that I pray I haven't brought any confusion to you I I just say that you know God leads you I try to give examples with things but God listen the same God that will lead me he'll lead you if you just seek after him he'll lead you and with things that I mentioned before about the smartphone and those things that were mentioned listen I'm not telling you to be a dictator don't you'll bring Rebellion out of your children it's love and trust and respect it's like this right here there's sometimes there's things or individuals that sometimes you know you got to take some time if I if I seen something going wrong if there's something I see going wrong maybe something I see a minister may be saying certain things I don't just go hey let me come right here that let's try to try to get I got to first of all try to build something up before I can ever begin to speak to them talk to them begin to talk to somebody and that's the same thing it is even with our children and with all is Lord give us a relationship Lord I tell you don't always pray Lord give me favor with my children with my spouse give me their heart Lord that can be guided it can be led by you is everybody okay you're probably sitting here saying I know what they're talking about that devotion time amen I love the Lord I want my tent I want our lives I want our assembly our doors are pitched to the glory of God when he moves on this I want to move when he says I want to move I want to move I just I just want to be I just want him in View and if something gets in the way excuse me move out of the way you're between me and the glory of God it's that simple in everything of our life let him be the first let him be the focus let him be in everything amen you love him let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you this morning and for your mercy and your grace once again to us Lord Lord I know in my heart Lord even of things Lord that not just Lord as I would study this but even Lord throughout it's find our hearts and our lives challenged by the word of God and Lord the very desire of our heart I trust that is with each and every one is Lord above everything else I just want to please you Lord I want to be pleasing to you father Lord I Thank You for Your Grace and your mercy that's to us I realize that Lord throughout a congregation Lord I I'm speaking Lord to those some that's already Lord they've raised their children and now they Lord have their grandchildren some their great-grandchildren others Lord are just just started and starting their families Lord some of us Lord in a we're all in different seasons but I'm asking you Lord that you would help every one of us that Lord through the whole part of the message today you were pointing us to a place that it's your presence in our lives individually that has an effect Lord and you're the one who teaches us Lord you show us how to apply the word in those times Lord help us Lord I don't Lord I don't want to be guilty of not trying I'd rather try and fall flat on my face than not try at all amen I'm asking you Lord that you would help us together I think not only Lord as a as a church body as a family but God every individual home if there's a father and a mother here Lord this morning that really has maybe not really consecrated their life maybe one has one hasn't maybe there's both but what a what a privilege this morning Lord that if they can just to see what you've done for them to see the love of God that's come down to make a way for their life that Lord that they can just in their own the very simple way surrender their heart to you and say Lord I want to give all of me to you Lord I want every bit Lord all every part of my life I don't want to walk by My reasonings or imaginations I don't want to walk by what what I think I want to walk by your thoughts Lord father I pray this morning would you guide us Lord help us Lord even in every individual home every one of our children Lord I think of our three children they're all they're different well they got a lot of there's similarities but there's differences there's even even different ways that I approach each one of them Lord knowing their differences knowing certain things and how certain things minister to them Lord that to me Lord it speaks of the material in the Tabernacle all the Tabernacle was not all one material it was different material but all of it coming together was an expression of the Living Word help us Lord you didn't ask me to figure that out for my children neither do you ask my brothers and sisters to figure it out for their own children you didn't ask Samson's parents figure it out but you came and you made yourself known and that's when manoah said teach us show us that we might order the child in the right way Lord I'm asking God for your grace for every one of us Lord May every Lord one of our homes Lord beginning right here Lord a challenge Lord God that father even in my heart in my life Lord is that this this assembly this church lord I can't make anyone neither do I want to make anyone do anything but Lord let it be that it's always you that is in view the glory of God is what is here Lord on display and where lives are pointed to that every heart Lord can have that same experience hand that reality when there's things Lord that we face in life that we don't know what to do there is a source for every question there's leadership by the spirit of Truth in this hour I wonder as our heads are bowed I wonder how many would say Lord It's a husband wife father mother son and daughter I wonder how many would say Lord grant that Lord in my life amen God bless you God bless you I got my hand up Grant that Lord I'm still here I'm looking to you father I need your leadership maybe there's things that you've got difficulties in your home difficulties you say but the same I don't know how to resolve it let's look to him let's keep the glory of God in view because there was absolutely no way for you and I to be made whole to be saved there was no way for Redemption no way for forgiveness no way out but the glory of God came down to where we were at brother Samuel do you believe that with all my heart I believe that that I know that to be a reality when I don't know what to do when I don't know situations even of things of how do I approach this with my son how would I approach this with my wife how do I how do I bring this out or even with the church how do I do that I Look to Him I Look to himen oh god let's go to him and let's let's finish Heavenly Father hearts Lord throughout this building I I pray that God that you'll bless them Lord I know it's been a little tough here this morning Lord through conditions to listen to heed but I pray that you would bless them Lord I pray that God that father as their hearts Lord have Lord been opened Lord with the desire of all things Lord my whole life with everything I want to be facing the glory of God Lord God that you would guide and direct every step of the way a responsibility that Lord we feel a burden Upon Our Hearts Grant it Lord father you're the Healer you're the one Lord who brings healing in situations Lord you bring healing Lord oh there's nothing too great for you for you to come Lord and bring healing Lord God may you I pray Lord in homes and lives hearts Lord may you just Lord I I pray have your way help us Lord help us Lord as we would even go from this place today may we start Lord with just even in the simplest of way of beginning to pray over the things that we've heard maybe Lord those are things it's already done but may we just Lord take that extra part talk about it talk about the things of God begin Lord to mention little things ask Lord of others our children sharing lord of the word of God help us Lord I pray Lord Jesus help us Lord May our tents always be facing you Lord help me Lord as a pastor help me Father help me Lord that it's you that they're beholding there's there's no greater desire Lord than it would be you that every life is beholding that God that every life and every heart sees is experiencing Lord that relationship between you and them oh God help us Lord help us Lord help me Lord as a father help me as a husband Lord help me father on many places in the scriptures thy children's children help Lord God every Grandpa every Grandma Lord whatever Lord name or title they would call themselves help them Lord oh God realizing a responsibility a precious moment Lord of time that we would have oh God help them to see they don't have to be Lord where they can spit out Lord scriptures and I don't mean that Lord in a rude way but they don't have to Lord be able to just name scriptures left and right and quotes left and right but talk about you you who is the passion of their life Lord granted Lord we love you father we love you Lord could we just take a few moments let's just stand and in your own way why don't you just tell him how much you love him how much you appreciate him how he's watched over our lives how he's guided us corrected us as a father when we're wrong he's helped us he's ministered to US helped us showed us how to apply the word in our lives oh my he's never rode us off for our mistakes but his grace is sufficient let's just take these few moments Lord Jesus we as a body we as a family kind of like Lord a time of devotion where we're all together we want to say thank you I want to say thank you Lord I'm so glad Lord God that it's not only Lord when I go through the Bible I'm so glad that through the message of the hour we see and we find this Lord God where you would Lord take moments Express these realities for our families for our homes and not just to say them but Express them help us to see it and help us to apply it Lord I realize this Lord for the parents Lord every one of us Lord there's things that Lord that are before us that our parents never had to look at my parents Lord they never even had to think about Lord a phones and tablets and internet they didn't have to think about that there's other ways and other things that they had to pray and and seek Lord but Father Here We Are In This Moment may you give us the wisdom give us the wisdom Lord with everything our children Lord as they Lord would go out Lord in school and workplace and other things Lord give us the wisdom Lord give us the wisdom in this hour we know it's kind of like Lord is it's telling the young people Lord on Friday night it's like a radio the radio itself is not bad but it's how it's used even how that Lord we talked about CD players of cars still have them it ain't the CD player that's bad it's how it's used the desires that's behind it so help us Lord I pray help us Lord in this age as parents Lord when things are all around us give us Lord the wisdom we need to be able to lead that our children Lord are able to grasp and to discern between right and wrong help us Lord I pray and thank you Lord for your grace to our lives thank you for your mercy thank you Lord Jesus you know one thing in the scripture I've always looked at when the Jews were come into a place when hmon had set the Trap and the time was dra near for them to be slaughtered in the Kingdom Esther you know how the How The Story Goes when she came into that moment and finally made known to the king of who she was her identity the plot that had been made by hmon remember the king said I cannot undo the words that's already been written in other words words I I can't undo the seeds per se that's already been swn I can't go back and take them out of the ground but here's what you can do this is what I love about it are you with me this is what I love how the king a principle in our lives he said but here's what you do you go tell your people to arm themselves and the day before that Slaughter is to happen you tell them to go through and take care of every one of them that were going to come and bring harm to you aren't you grateful that even though listen friends even through things we're not not to be careless people I believe there's a heart's desire to say Lord I want to do what's right but God does not put us in a place to say you've been wrong or you've been wrong or you he gives us an opportunity that we can arm ourselves and seow good seed and that seed that will counteract the effect of any bad seed that we some brother Samuel have you made mistakes many many many you could pull them to the side and ask them at different times how many times has daddy ever sat down and asked you to forgive him how many times has daddy ever had to sit
