verse I am my beloved me defender [Applause] here's mine my beloved mine is bad [Music] Alleluia amen you love him tonight a man it certainly is good to be gathered together here tonight and the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just want to say that we I know not everyone is here and different ones that were apart even in the meetings there this weekend but just such a on Sunday I wanted to make mention of it after looking and everything and just to see how that just such a concerted effort just everyone just coming together and I know brother Bill was mentioning it I wasn't there when the doors were opened on that fellowship hall even though they were late but just to see how everybody brother Bill's testimony was and it said he said there's no way I could have done that on my own he said but just to see everybody just come right together you know and I'll tell you that's a real that's just a real testimony and you know it's um it's something that the Lord just you know when God gives a burden yet it takes all within our hearts just you're standing behind that I believe that I know I was sure blessed this weekend I was sure blessed this weekend I I thank God for his visitation and the Lord just coming in just really speaking to our hearts and and perhaps some of you are kind of like me you after a few days you start feeling the effects of those things you know but it's it's good you see our body can fill it but yet what has been sown and what we've taken in all my it's it's priceless it's priceless for what the Lord has done and and so we just were so thankful to God for His mercy so thankful for all that different visitors had come and they brought their licks of fire I had mentioned to many of the pastors even on early Sunday morning had greeted many of the pastor's were different ones had come and just was thinking them you know for coming and being a part of the meeting and just so just so wonderful to be able to fellowship together in just so wonderful so we want to just look into the word of the Lord tonight and we certainly need his help we want to look in Exodus chapter 25 once again Exodus 20:5 and verse 31 when you say that when you have it just say you men and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold I wanted I want you to watch in the scriptures here where how what is first and what is spoken of what is what is in view here and thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same let's just ask the Lord's blessing in the word Heavenly Father Lord as we give of ourselves Lord hear Lord speaker and hearer together lord we've come Lord with a purpose and a desire and a heart to hear from you and Lord we know that that will take Lord truly a supernatural act from you O God Lord that you would comment and take the gift Lord that you've placed here in my life and Lord my desire is to move out of the way and Lord as the people Lord hear Lord of gathered their desire Lord is to also move out of the way and Lord to place all of the cares and worries of this life Lord before you because Lord we can walk in here with so many questions and not knowing what road to take or what decision but in your presence Lord you're the one that we want to influence our lives Lord so we know that Lord as we come in here Lord our purpose is that we leave out of your different people Lord that father we have a confidence that you are the answer for every need in every question in our life so we wait patiently upon you Lord for the Lord as you've told us be careful for nothing don't be anxious but wait on the Lord in heat renew thy strength Lord this is a promise to us and we Lord as believers we are looking to you even in those moments that we don't know the next step to take but we are waiting in you Lord father for your faithful Lord always to come at your appointed time Lord as you've spoken in your word and Lord we just love you we've gathered here tonight and we ask that you would have your way we just want to present ourselves Lord we don't have any any form or any Lord direction to give you but we stand Lord as vessels that are yielded to follow your direction Lord and you're leading tonight may you just come in a very special way Lord and just pour out of yourself the Lord in our midst tonight or God and speaking to hearts and lives Lord in a very personal way Lord we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless yous your being seated tonight want to look here at this once again a beaten work to display light and one of just in looking at how that it is set forth here you'll notice in the scriptures and just for sake of time I didn't read them but you'll notice that what is first and what is drawn here when it speaks of the the candelabras or the menorah and we know that it's a part within the in the tabernacle and all all of the parts would we see this all the way through the tabernacle with in the wilderness remember maybe for some that's a little new within the faith just remember that God's desire has always been to Tabernacle inside of man that the Old Testament is filled with many types and shadows wonderful types and shadows and that no matter where that you can look within the Old Testament and truly seeing it in its right light you'll see Christ to be the center of it there's certain things that you know I would say that probably all of us that are gathered here tonight there are things that maybe you can read or have read or even in your time when you look back at the Old Testament and maybe not seeing many of these things within their clarity but you know God has a time and God has a season for it and we know that when we look at it that they're very coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was not something that was just II as we say just dropped but he yet it was prophesied of the whole time all the way through from even from when in the very heavens themselves even as God wrote his first Bible there in the heavens it always in all things it is to speak of the Lord Jesus Christ and when I look at this this work that is mentioned here the first focus and the attention is upon this should make a candlestick of pure gold and then it begins to go through and it speaks that everything that's of that of this candlestick there's six branches that come out of it and then it lays that all of these parts in verse 31 his shaft his branches his bowls his knobs his flowers shall be of the same so in everything that we see when we look at this pure candlestick we're recognizing that this is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ God coming down and in in redemption to bring you an eye to himself and that our lives are completely completely his everything is to be completely his and I look at this when I I think of this when you see how that God spoke to Moses and he tells Moses remember in this vision he tells Moses regarding the vision that there were men that he had filled with his spirit God makes mention of this and Exodus 31 and then he he brings it back again in Exodus 35 and then it's mentioned again in Exodus 37 but God lets him know there are men that I have filled with wisdom and these these men that I have filled with my spirit to work in wisdom to work in understanding their to work also in all knowledge and all manner of workmanship so and all of the things that were done what God had showed Moses their God had opened this visions of Moses to show him what was there in the heavenlies but yet now to take what was now in a vision and what would be spoken it must come into manifestation and God Himself to think of this of how that God had men that were set aside that were able to enter in to that same inspiration not another inspiration but that same inspiration and what they would see and what they themselves would behold would be the same thing that Moses beheld they themselves were not able to take themselves there but notice God said even even in the midst of the vision when all was taking place within Israel God said I have filled them past-tense with my spirit you see God already seeing you and I even before the foundation of the world he he made a way knowing that you would want life you would desire life because you are part of him he already seen you as a matter of fact he sees you as a finished work but you see we need we need that same channel of inspiration that has moved upon our lives that you and I can begin to see ourselves even more clearly the way that God has always saw us because many things that we know about ourselves or have known and when we look at ourselves it's very easy for us in and in our in our first nativity and even have to being born again it's very easy to just think about all of the mistakes and all the failures but you see God is able by his Spirit to bring you an eye into that place to where we're operating the same inspiration of the Holy Spirit and this is where God has brought these individuals and you see and within it I want you to catch this here within it they themselves would have the wisdom here's what being filled with the spirit did it gave them wisdom it gave them understanding it gave them knowledge to work all manner of workmanship you and I both know that you and I cannot perform the Word of God and perform his will on our own but we need the Holy Spirit revealing his will to our lives and it's not you and I that's that's the one doing it we just simply become vessels that are yielded that he himself is the one who receives all the glory so when it's all said and done there is nothing that you and I can say I did this or I did that all we can say is I just happened to be standing here and he showed up I just happened to be here because it was in my arrangement but God has a rage that I would be here God arranged that you would hear this glorious truth you're ordained you are a part of it and it's the truth itself that came and sought you out I look at this of how this inspiration it moves within this time and I think of how that God moves down and he speaks through Peter of how that there were prophets men of old who were set aside and they themselves were moved by the Spirit of God the Bible says in Hebrews one I believe it's verse one it speaks of how that he spake how that God spake in the prophets to them and how that he was the Spirit of Christ Peter picks it up in 1st Peter chapter 1 it was the Spirit of Christ in them and it did signify one manner and how that Christ would come you see they entered in the prophets of old I want you understand me now how the prophets themselves did not pry themselves into these places they were ordained prophets they were ordained prophets they were predestinated by God and here that gift that would lay upon the earth the Spirit of God moving down and how that they were a part of that life they themselves would be moved by the Spirit of Almighty God that same inspiration the same honors in the beginning the same one who spoke in Genesis 3 that same spirit of God would move down upon these prophets and they themselves notice what harmony how in the world can you get a group of people in harmony it would be impossible for this man stop to match this man stop to match this man sloth to match this man's thought it would be impossible but remember the prophets were not speaking their own thoughts they were speaking as they were moved by the Holy Ghost they entered into that same channel of inspiration and notice all the way then all the way down through the scriptures we find that when Christ Himself he comes upon this earth God becoming flesh we find of how that he declares himself that he indeed was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the Proverbs were you with me he was there the whole time he matter-of-fact in his resurrection and Luke 24 he declares beginning with Moses he begins to declare all the way through it was me it was me it was me it was me oh my I want to just draw your attention to this tonight because when we look at things you know and we're looking at who should be and the one that is highlighted in our midst there should not be one that is even brought to that of equalness to the Lord Jesus Christ because let me tell you something there is only one who has redeemed you and I the one who shed his blood for us and every true life will point to that work of redemption in the Lord Jesus Christ never lift anybody into that place nobody in his in that place that place is reserved for him and him alone they men you believe that tonight so look at how that the scripture would even speak of this and and continue to highlight it in Exodus 39 verse 37 the Bible says the pure candlestick with the lamps thereof even with the lamps to be set in order and all the vessels thereof and they offer light but I want to draw your attention back to the pure candlestick with the Lance thereof notice it says these are lamps of the candlestick the candlestick is not of the lamps but the lamps are of the candlestick without the candlestick the lamps are nothing are you with me but it's the candlestick and the lamps belong to the candlestick here's lamps belong to him they are his lamps are you with me so we notice that within this the scripture says here in second chronicles 13 11 just a few verses of reference here and it says and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof the candlestick of gold with lamps now remember this candlestick is a pure gold it cannot be mixed with anything else it must be pure gold and the lamps belong to the candlestick you see it speaks this speaks in such detail that our life is not to be our own it's in our life is not to be about us but our life is to be about him we've been bought with a price if it wasn't for him we would be nothing we can clearly say as he said upon this earth when he walked here in a fleshly body that we can not do anything without him remember what he said he said the son can do it and can do nothing but what he see it the father doing and then that doeth the son likewise so without he were nothing but we've been bought with a price aren't you glad for that tonight amen and so we're being bought for a price there's a reason and it was not just something that you know sometimes where you go to a a junk store or whatever you call it you know and you look at this and you think hmm let me see here I don't know wonder what I could use this box for I don't know I'll just pick this box up and we'll just see I don't know I I who knows I mean I don't know I'll just put this with the other other 52 boxes of God what are you gonna use for a mile and I just put it there that is not the way that the Lord Jesus worked he knew what was in the pawnshop and he knew the potential that lay within his subjects when he came to earth he never came wandering or questioning would somebody feel sorry for me will somebody serve me he knew exactly what he was coming for and that there would be vessels there are vessels that are ordained for a purpose you realize that God has ordained your life for purpose and you and I are the ones coming into that place which is Paul declaring the mystery of Christ that it's you and I were already here we were we were ordained to be vessels of God but yet it had to be him come and redeem us and bring us unto himself and then he by his life in us empowers us and fills us and then it's him working through us so it isn't God wandering around with your life I wonder what I wonder what I wonder what I should do with him I wonder what I should do with her God is not doing that that's you and I but you see the sooner that we can realize and let our hands be taken off and tried to not perform it by our power our mind then God Himself can perform his perfect will in our lives God doesn't want our hands on it he did not redeem us and then say you know what I got you out of the pawn shop but I don't know if I can really use your now I don't know if I can do this so I'm gonna need your strength he doesn't need my strength he doesn't need your strength the only thing about our strength is to yield ourselves to him that he might perform his word through us think about this lamps of the candlestick now look at how look at how that the scripture goes on with this in Exodus 35 14 the candlestick also for the light and his furniture and his lamps whose lives are they his lamps so after his lamps they must reflect his life if they are a lamp and reflect something else they're not his limbs his lamps reflect him his lamps declare where he where the source and origin of their life is of numbers 4 9 the candlestick and they shall take a cloth of blue I look at even how they wrap them and cover the candlestick of the light notice cover the candlestick of the light not just the candlestick but the candlestick of the light because it is the candlestick that is lit first it is the candlestick itself of which the other lamps themselves would derive their own light without this candlestick of light there is no light now watch how that God would place this let's just kind of review this just a little bit in Exodus 40 verse 4 notice once again and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and light the lamps thereof notice who comes in first thou shall bring in the candlestick it's almost as though the candlestick is here and the lamps are coming in behind but it's altogether are you with me it's all together but what is the highlight the highlight is the candlestick so who's to be highlighted all the way through the candlestick so you mean there's not a lamp that's to be highlighted no No if a lamp is highlighted more than the candlestick it's not right you can see the people doing yet or it's that lamp that that lamp is not truly of the candlestick are you with me for every lap will truly maintain its position because every lamp realizes its life source is of him and it recognizes its purpose just like Paul knew his purpose is that right that's the same way it comes down to you and I notice this here in numbers 8 verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto Aaron and say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick it mattered how they lit this you didn't mattered it wasn't just oK we've got this candlestick we've got the menorah just you know Aaron make sure you you light it no no there's a way to light it remember God just not do things haphazardly God is interested everything that God does whether it's things spoken or whether it's actions it is prophetic it will always it always speaks of him and the way that he will do these things notice when thou lightest the lamps the seven laps shall give light over against the candlestick no glory in their own but they shall give light over against the candlestick so every true lamp will do what it will reflect Jesus Christ if a lamp doesn't reflect Jesus Christ it's not a true lamp but every true laughs their life it reflects it gives alive it gives witness over to the candlestick Christ the center of it watch this in verse three and Aaron did so he lighted the lamps there of over against the candlestick as the LORD commanded Moses now let me read this tree I don't think I didn't include this but I read it to you the last time we were together but RAM tells us like this in the Patmos vision he said the lamp was lit in a special way first the priests took fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of God so you could not take in a strange fire you cannot take in a different fire but it must be the same fire that came and consumed the sacrifice there on the brazen altar which speaks of the fire of God accepting and receiving the sacrifice as is mentioned in Isaiah 53 so that same fire of God now notice this it must be that same fire he said he lit what's this he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl the lap that was sitting on top of the bowl now remember when they were pouring in the oil they didn't go around pouring in the oil within each of the branches the branches get their life out of the vine is that right there is a bowl as it speaks in Zechariah 4 - as a Cariah noticed the bowl on the top thereof the Holy Spirit will notice when here the sacrifice is received the Bible says that there were they were in dude with power from on high the Holy Spirit came down as a witness that the sacrifice not only had been accepted but the Holy Spirit comes down to make them aware that they are included in the sacrificial offering mama what's this he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top the ball so you mean it makes a difference you mean it makes a difference on who you set forth first it sure does there ought to be one person that you identify first when you witness and that's the Lord Jesus Christ at the truth that ought to be that they are their identification and the witness is of the Lord Jesus Christ if listen friends if this message that has been truly revealed to us then it ought to have revealed Jesus Christ to you and I if it's something else and we've got the wrong revelation if the message that we're hearing all we can see is brother branham wrong revelation this message brings Jesus Christ to the forefront it does not highlight a man it does not raise up a man it does not raise up a church it raises up Jesus Christ in his original power and original glory hallelujah glory be to God in the highest you matters how its lit it matters how it's lit all things listen to me now all things ought to start with Christ nothing is to be ministered in the church except you'd be fairly vindicated by the scriptures is that right that's exactly what our prophet told us he stood for that is that right he stood for and over and over nothing should be preached unless it is vindicated within the Scriptures it's gets the right order it's the right order you see if it's not held that Christ is the center then things can start going off well I've got quotes for it you might have quotes for it but if Christ does not remain the center you're on the wrong path is that right it must highlight Jesus Christ it's not just about will to the center it's got to be word on top of word but you can't divide the word from the spirit it must be his life that's being expressed in whatever doctrine and whatever truth in whatever is minister it must highlight Jesus Christ to be the same if it's not somebody's lightning in the wrong order hello somebody over the sand I got quotes I don't care if you got quotes if them quotes don't highlight Jesus Christ to be the same yesterday today and forever you need to let the Holy Spirit take that evil spirit away from you that wants to take Jesus Christ from being the sinner whew Rory he then lit the second lamp from the flame of the first so it didn't go back to the altar now remember from the altar the flame is moved they lit the lamp up on the top then they moved there from that they moved in from the to the first lap then they're moving from the first lap to the second lap they aren't taking the fire from one lap to another it is the same fire of God that is moved down through the Gentile Church ages the same baptism of the Holy Ghost the same Living God coming and redeeming his subjects age after age time after time he is redeeming what belongs to him and he works through them hmm but remember he only works through a certain way it's got to be his provided way it can be any other other way it's got to be his provided way when it comes this provided way then he can work through that way amen the third lap received this fire from the second land has did the fourth receive it's from the third and so on until all seven lamps were burning this holy fire from the altar being passed from lab to lab is a wonderful type of the Holy Spirit in the seven church age 'as the original outpouring of Pentecost which outpouring came direct from Jesus on the mercy seat in doing his church throughout all seven churches showing forth perfectly you catch in that showing forth perfectly that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever the never changing God in his essence and his ways he's the same God now notice this light that King John's picks it up here in John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men I want you to listen to me just a moment here these there have been many prophets and different ones down through time where God had been able to reflect his light because the prophets themselves were being were reflectors of light but they were not able but I did not have the ability it was not that of the light where a man and women were able to experience redemption but we realized that they were gathered under that truth that was made known and they're a part of that truth and as it was gathered we were also realized that they were awaiting the fulfillment and coming of the Messiah they were gathered with that with that earnest and a lot don't you see that when the real coming of the Holy Spirit it does not make complacent people it does not make us come to a place where well this is it I have arrived it doesn't work that way when the real Holy Spirit takes residence within the heart of the believer it gives you up out of your natural senses it gives you a vision that's beyond this world you might have to live in this world we have to do things in this world but your life is not about this world your life is being lived for that other world that you have been born of been touched by been birthed into you are living here for that there so your life is no longer your own but here when the Lord Jesus comes now in him was life he was the very life giver himself the very one that had revealed himself to the prophets the very one the very spirit of God that had moved upon the prophets and they themselves would speak under that divine channel of inspiration of the true candlestick the Messiah who was to come they would express that but now when God Himself becoming one of us noticed the testimony in him was life and that life was the light of men now man already had light within themselves as far as in their spirit but it could come and go is that right he could come and go Redemption had not come forth to where that the very soul of man should actually be lit up there had not been a price that was paid it just comes back to that box I was talking about that box itself we could use that box for a lot of things but if it still hadn't been brought out of the prong shop it still is not solely in my possession but once the debt has been paid that thing which always belonged to me it's solely mine they understand what I'm saying after I get done using it here in this service and don't go back to the pawn shop it is mine I have purchased it so the use of it it doesn't leave come and go come and go but at the spirit of God abides to work through this you with me this because redemption has been paid and remember when the candlestick himself come on whom thou shalt see the spirit descend and remain the same as he the same as he walked the pure candlestick so notice in him was the light and the life was the light of men remember what it was that lightened the world in the very beginning when the world itself set in total darkness it was covered over but what lightened the world in the beginning was his word let there be light now you can look and say well then that was sunlight but remember the Sun is only a proud of his word his word is what gave light there in the beginning so what brought light to this chaos that now you and a half here we are walking in around upon this earth it was his word that brought light when that word became open when that word became manifest then it brought light to where there was darkness notice how the scripture speaks of his birth in Luke 2 verse 32 it says alike this is this is the this is the coming of the Lord Jesus a light to lighten the Gentiles lord have mercy you mean I couldn't light myself no you couldn't like yourself you mean I could never be good enough to wear that finally when I'm good enough God says alright I'll give you the Holy Ghost if that was so we would not have needed a redeemer but our Redeemer came this and now out of his side went forth the water out of his side went forth the blood and the Spirit of God that dwells within him that life that lightens you and I it's because of him who called us and sanctified us and it's him that likes you and I am without him we're not able to be lived don't you reload can't you see it so clearly that it must be him to light you and I up and he'll always come through his word if it's the word in the beginning that lit it up in the beginning then it's his word that is manifest and vindicated that lights things up him him a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of that people Israel notice what Jesus says concerning his self here John 8:12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life he that followeth me following him was much more than just knowing him in his physical journey here I want to dwell on that law tonight but it was much more than knowing him in his physical journey Paul came to a place to where could Paul could say I believe it's in first Corinthians 5 we henceforth we know no man after the flesh it comes to a place to where it had to know him by divine revelation but the promise is following on to know him you see friends it isn't God doesn't expect you and I to try to figure it out he just said follow me follow you yeah just put your foot every every place that I put my foot you put your foot right in that place right there but sometimes let me just preach a little bit sometimes we're so interested in getting to the back of the door it's like we want to walk on air to get there but he has a pathway there is an order to lighting the lamps and it must follow the pathway that he has given well I know what they used to teach in Sunday school and and in my old church or at this place you know they said that long all you got to do is just believe but remember there's more understanding that you're responsible for now it's more than just looking at those back doors and say I believe that's way out of here I really do little joy I believe that's the way out I believe if I go that way I'll get out of here but just believing don't get me there I've got to believe that that is the way and then I've gotta walk in every step that he has laid out every stage of grace I must walk in that to be called in justification as a dirty glass and then sanctified a glass that's cleaned up and then filled with the Spirit of God I've got to be lit the right way in matters there and how you light them up there could be a lot of errands at home my whole glorious God you know they work for people up they get them worked up and the Holy Spirit yet the Holy Spirit will come right down upon their spirit but you see it never results in a change life because listen to me the world goes down and deals with the depths of our life the word does not leave us in the condition if we are really receiving it it does not leave us in a condition in a bad condition but the word will work in our life it'll push back it'll separate the firm it's the word itself we'll go to work it'll put everything in order just as it ought to be see it's God has a precise order amen you love him as long as I'm in the world John nine five I am the light of the world see speaking of his earthly visitation in his corporal body as long as I'm here I am the light of the world well if you are his body then what could you say at this time if when he was here in his corporal body now if he is here and you have been baptized into his mystical body right representing here showing that body I am identified in that body that sacrifice there we are identified in his body right now so what is it it is ye are light in the heart here he is I am the light of the world but pure candlestick John 12:46 his purpose I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness what child Paul picks this up in acts 26 22 Paul here testifying before men having therefore obtained help of God I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come what's Paul saying I'm under that same inspiration where the candlesticks are lit in a certain way I'm in that same inspiration that still declares that Jesus Christ is the same in that same inspiration that he is the candlestick of pure gold is that right then what Paul preached every promise is yay an amen they said before I was with you in weakness and trembling which they call brother branham the lights the brother and will focus on that he says notice this great man all the languages he knew but yet he said he was in weakness and fear and great trembling lest lest it would be Paul that would stand before him Paul did not want their faith to be resting in his flesh Paul wanted their faith to be in the power of God you know why Paul was truly called of God to order it in the right way in that your desire even among your children your family you know what the confidence within your flesh you want the confidence in that Jesus is the center of this home Jesus is the center model even for different ones that you would pray for him and God would move upon your heart yet with it at all you don't want nothing within your flesh but they would rest you want it to rest in Jesus Christ to be so careful to say no I'm just your brother I'm just your sister I'm just your daddy I'm just your mama but he he he's the one you see what I'm saying it's not about what we can do even as young people when you look at things you look at daddy look at mama look at different ones around the church and and things like that it isn't power and strength it is in mind of war tell you what man brother Samuel just he can quote the scripture it it definitely what it is it's Christ and it was something that even I can remember back in my own life it was a mystery how is this lived how do they want to do this but yet I wanted to do this how is that it's because there's got to be a change there's got to be a change in here because this man does not pack the strength notice what Paul said in acts 26 23 continuing of how that he had continued with that same inspiration that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead Paul even speaking this same inspiration Moses and the prophets all pointed out how Christ should suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles now let's come back here just a few moments Exodus 25 37 and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof that they may give light over against yet so the lighting of these lamps if a lamp is truly lit in the right way it will give light over against the candlestick it'll give light over against him who is in the middle it will give light it will give witness you see it's a witness that is given the light whereby the lamp is lit gives witness that I am a Christian look at what I look at what Zechariah seen I think this is just tremendous they can't get away from this Zechariah for to hear Zechariah taken in a vision and he said unto me what see is that I said I have looked and I see seven lamps is that what he saw first no what did he see first and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so in this vision who desire I see first the candlestick so even in the true witness who'll is it that is to be reflected in shown forth the candlestick of pure gold the Lord Jesus Christ because listen friends once the revelation of Jesus Christ is so struck you'll recognize his lamps when you reckon listen because you'll recognize that his lamps are his lamps and you recognize that his lamps give light and substance from him to guide and help us on our walk are you with me but it's not the lamp first then the candlestick ooh now can't I'd only now it's not the lamp first than the candlestick it's the candlestick and his lamps thereof you see friends this is one of the main reasons where many people I don't say this critically or to demean where many have made the mistake they have exalted brother Branham first and they had exalted him above the Lord Jesus Christ they have wanted to make people know for sure this is the messenger this is the messenger the first thing is to get them to Jesus Christ if we've got if a real revelation burns within our heart then it ought to be Christ the candlestick listen if we can read the scriptures this is the words of the Prophet he said if you can read going back to Genesis and you don't see Christ in every verse of the Bible go back and read it again he didn't say keep going the same way now the order is wrong it's C Jesus Christ that is the whole every true messenger that has been down through time every believer the whole the whole of it is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ just looking at it here even today and whatever more over and over you type in the very part where brother Graham will say it over and over it's not the messenger it's not the messenger it's the message but yet if we're not careful there's other voices that want to portray to us and say every ordained minister will appoint for people to brother branham that's a line devil that is not the Spirit of God the Prophet himself said time and time again the Holy Ghost will always point to Jesus Christ but true ministry will always he's this as his folks his words will always point the people to the finished work of Calvary you see what that is that's men people messing around and they haven't ordered it the right way they're ordering in a different way that doctor the random appear in Jesus down here no that is not the right order that's the wrong order Bodrum said to do it like that is to make me Antichrist but to say that his spirit is anointing me then that would be right you see because of that way this is where you have many people that all of a sudden it comes to a stumbling and they've got their posts on the internet and this was set here and this was said there that's nothing but a bunch of chipmunk chatter you know I'm saying where people come and say hold of the RAM you know he said this here and he said that here what is it that you're trying to tell us what is it that you're trying to say I'm stood right here in this church in this assembly my daddy did the same thing I'm stood right here and I preached those things what was that that was chipmunk chatter we see that we recognize this was a man but it's who was portrayed through that vessel any man we recognize that it was Christ that spoke in this generation and that same Christ is speaking here tonight we can't help it when we read the message when we hear the message it has made this book a brand new book to you and I to where when we read it all we see is the pure candlestick you know that is caught up in the same inspiration glory be to God we thank God for the prophet in this hour God gave him this place but you and I have got a position we've got a place and we are responsible to see that this message who lives out through our lives may God help us may God help us to be faithful lamps that give light over against the candlestick to where when people come and they talk to you and they ask you what are you I'm a Christian yeah I know what church you volunteer I belong to the oldest church there is what churches that you must be Catholic well I'm original but I'm not Roman I'm part of that original body of Jesus Christ okay okay okay but yeah seriously what what church are you part of you see what it is they're looking at things they're seeing the way you're acting how you're conducting your life they know there's something different about you but your position is not in a church it's in Jesus Christ and so when they come and start talking to you here you start talking to him about the word you start talking to them about the scriptures where do you want to start where would you like to you know just let them talk and where would you like to talk I'll tell you what friends listen this message I love my Bible more than I ever did every day as I read it I to be able to sit down with different ones and you can sit there and just talk to them through the scriptures oh brother Sammy you can do that because you're a minister no no it's not just cause I'm a minister it's where that this light and this word it has highlighted Christ throughout here is that right and we understand listen God reveals to you what God has revealed to you don't worry that light is to shine through your life and yet God doesn't reveal things just for us to get built up but he's revealing it that it might be lived through us and then when some when it comes to witness and testify you're not speaking about theory you're speaking about yourself when you're talking about the word you're talking about yourself who glory be to God and behold with a candlestick of gold what did John see John said I heard a voice like a trumpet speak unto me he said I turned to see the voice that spake unto me and being turned I saw seven now listen now seven golden candlesticks but yet as we continue into the next verse and in the midst in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man he is in the midst of every age he walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he is the centerpiece of every messengers message and as he is the centerpiece of every messengers message is also the centerpiece in the life of every believer who receive that light you know what a centerpiece is sometimes you know they put such great things great centerpiece on the table to me the best thing outside of flowers be on the table I can for get the flour just put a big old turkey in the middle of it that's a great centerpiece for me or you know have a calf a cake get rid of the all the fur combs and everything else just put one of those glass cake covers with a three layer chocolate cake with frosting all around it put that right there or put an apple pie in the middle of it lattice or a crumble topping put one of those right there in the midst of it but you see what it is what does the centerpiece do it draws the attraction and everything else is just filler it becomes the focus it becomes what the eye is glued to it what is this and that's the way that Jesus Christ is in the life of a believer let me read this in closing Colossians 3:3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory he is our life but the RAM says who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks how meaningful are those words when viewed in the light of the scripture which describes him as Christ who is our life for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless gathering of the people as a corpse be jeweled and rest is still a corpse so the church no matter what her programs her gracious efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all do you realize that you are a wonderment not just to people around you you are a wonderment to the Angels remember the scripture I read to a few weeks ago where Paul said I think it was when a preacher on the dead of love I Oh what Paul said that we as apostles were made us as a spectacle unto the world that word spectacle means as a theater one who is acting out apart and here are you men here is a humanity that yet there's something deeper beyond our humanity it's not us acting out with the baptism of a Holy Ghost in our life it's Christ acting out through our lives down all yes sometimes we can get down listen to me when you've been born of the Spirit of God your soul has been sealed the light of the candle in your spirit might get blown out you might get down you might get discouraged but that flame that's seal on the inside it can never be removed but God Himself will move right down and he'll come down and wear a flame in our spirit remember the book of Proverbs the spirit of man is as a candle it can be blown out but God will come right back down and He will light our spirit again because we get weary sometimes we get down her brother bill speak of it right here when he was leading songs tests and trials and things come our way and it's true sometimes it seems like it's been it's went out remember the prophets standing right there when he said I was about ready to say what he was getting ready to say but you see the seal couldn't be broken the seal could not be broken and the Spirit of God moving by to relight that candle that flame mama and this very hour listen to this hears we close in this very hour he is walking in the midst of the last ages golden candlestick it's not all we see him back down the beginning no he was the center of every age he's the center Center what he was as he walked in the first age he is even now in the last stage Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's walking and you know what in the beginning the Bible says they heard the voice of God walking here he was walking how did they know he was walking in the midst of him they heard his voice his voice he was walking in the midst of them he walks in the midst of your life he's enthroned in the midst of your life it isn't that necessarily you're saying something out of here but it's a voice that's sounding his voice his life is sounding out so Christ Christ in our lives let's stand our lives has been pre-planned it's been ordained by God don't you think of these it's been ordained by God you and I come to this realization and yet it's becoming more real to us it must become more real to us it must become more personal it must become more of a substance in our life I want you to think of this scripture here let me read this I told you I just wanted to read a couple more before I close here as I am closing but no flesh should glory in his presence is there anything we can glory in I've done this I we haven't done a thing it's him but of Hilda are you in Christ Jesus who of God he is made unto us wisdom what wisdom do we have without him we have none he's made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption he's my wisdom he's my righteousness he's my sanctification he's my Redemption he's my all and all that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord so our lives we'll do our lives reflect as a believer as a Christian life our lives reflect the Lord Jesus Christ it reflects him he is our everything I think about it in this hour you and I we would have missed it maybe sitting here tonight you're not aware of all of these things of what God has done but yet you're aware of his presence you're aware of God speaking personally and your life just remember as the Holy Spirit is said that he lights the lamps in a certain way he had light up your life you will never he'll never go over your will but he works to bring our will in submission to his will and that's the same thing in every you can follow that pattern in every part of your life if God has a pathway for your life you'll light it up you may not see at the very end of it but if you walk in what he's opening up to you you'll get to the end what he has this is faith is to trust him if you don't know him in that way what a sublime opportunity to come to know him in that way let's bow our heads Lord Jesus you are the center Lord the center of it all Lord Jesus if we've missed that we miss everything Lord Jesus I pray Heavenly Father Lord in all of our lives our decisions everything that we do it is to reflect you not just when we talk of the word Lord of scriptures quotes but every when you our life everything it reflects you when you revealed to Moses Noah all of them down through time what you revealed to them that was Christ in that generation those that Lord that came under that message that was given and become part of that revelation they were ordained to be a part of it but Lord it was reflected in their life Christ the heart the center of that revelation because the ark itself that spoke of you you were there in the center of Noah's message you were there in Moses message Lord when we look back down through there every decision that would have been made Lord when we take it in a very simple simplistic way about the ark every decision that was made would have been about the ark lord help us may we Lord look at every decision maybe we not make decisions lightly [Music] whether it be positions that we take whether it be things that we do lo God may we'd not take it lightly but may we look and pass everything through and say will this hinder the purpose of Christ in my life or will it help to further it help us Lord Jesus because Lord it's that right there that causes us as your children to make decisions differently many times I'm speaking Lord to some that are here some that are not even here there's Lord things decisions they could have made decisions where some of them Lord would have made where they'd had never been around a church home whatsoever they maybe could have stream but they they didn't want that they wanted to remain where there's a fellowship of believers or to where that they turned down positions in a company where there could have been more money that they could have made but it was because you're the center Lord God I know there's been decisions that's been made all the way across here Lord God Lord many that no doubt I'll never know we'll never know among one another but that's how our lives are lived as believers Christ is our life and Lord when there's a decision that we've made that we say oh this this is infringing upon that reflection of Christ nor then we quickly coming right back into that place of purpose say Lord forgive me cleanse me Lord Jesus realign I don't want that reflection to be taken away but I want Christ to be so reflective decisions Lord that are made Oh God let it be Lord let it be said Lord Jesus from our lives that the decisions that we would make let us not make them hastily Lord but let us Lord God wait in prayer let us look to You Lord God I know sometimes the Lord were put on the spot sometimes there's a decision that we have to make the Lord led us at all times not knowing when that decision would come may we the Lord defer to your choice that in all things that Christ would remain first reflected fully in our lives in our families in our homes in this assembly Lord God Granite Lord Jesus for it matters how the lamps are lit may it always be you first grant in Lord and us last or Jesus we love you tonight Lord they appreciate your Lord how we thank you Lord God thank you for your mercy Lord thank you for
