[34:55] within our hearts
[34:56] that desire for reality desire for the
[34:58] living god
[35:00] it's actually that desire is what really
[35:02] what found us
[35:04] the branham brings it on down he said
[35:06] it's that eternal germ that was in you
[35:09] that's what found you
[35:11] you think about it
[35:12] if you with your phone if you don't have
[35:14] a sim card or nothing on there how can
[35:17] anybody find you
[35:20] so it's the sim card that allows you to
[35:23] be found
[35:24] it's a seat of god on the inside it's
[35:26] god's never lost sight never in any way
[35:31] of you or i but he came looking for us
[35:35] amen he came in the fulfillment of his
[35:37] word in this hour
[35:40] to look for you and i
[35:42] amen you believe that
[35:44] it's true
[35:45] amen this word
[35:47] is the only word that could take effect
[35:49] upon our lives and bring out
[35:51] what god had placed within us
[35:53] and it's him
[35:55] we're in due season
[35:57] amen we're in the season in a time

[40:16] there is no
[40:24] and no one else can touch my heart like
[40:29] you do
[40:33] for i can search for all
[40:36] eternity
[40:45] one more time
[40:47] [Music]
[40:56] and no one else can touch my heart like
[41:01] you do
[41:02] [Music]
[41:13] there is
[41:15] [Music]
[41:20] amen let's turn in our bibles to matthew
[41:23] chapter 9.
[41:27] so good to see
[41:29] each and every one of you and we still
[41:31] have
[41:31] different ones that are still recovering
[41:34] and we can't go up for his mercy and see
[41:36] different ones that's recovered and from
[41:39] different things that uh
[41:41] taking place in their body from covenant
[41:43] and flu from
[41:44] whatever it is i'm glad that the
[41:46] scripture still applies i'm the lord
[41:47] that healeth all
[41:49] thy disease
[41:51] when covett came along jesus never said
[41:54] uh-oh
[41:55] he never did that
[41:57] he said i got it covered i'm the lord
[41:59] that healeth all
[42:00] die diseases
[42:02] amen so i'm grateful for that
[42:05] and so we just want to
[42:08] look here into the word of the lord and
[42:09] just a
[42:11] part that just really inspired to my
[42:13] heart here as we look into these things
[42:16] in verse 35
[42:18] four verses of scripture here
[42:20] jesus went about all the cities and
[42:22] villages teaching in their synagogues
[42:25] and preaching the gospel of the kingdom
[42:28] and healing every sickness and every
[42:30] disease among them among the people but
[42:33] when he saw the multitudes he was moved
[42:36] with compassion on them because they
[42:38] fainted and were scattered abroad
[42:40] as sheep having no shepherd then saith
[42:44] he unto his disciples
[42:46] the harvest truly is plenteous
[42:50] but the laborers
[42:51] are few
[42:53] pray ye therefore
[42:55] the lord of harvest that he will send
[43:00] forth
[43:01] laborers
[43:02] into his harvest
[43:04] i want you to catch this in verse 37
[43:08] this response in 37 is based on a need
[43:13] as the lord jesus is looking in the very
[43:16] depth and notice what he says they
[43:18] fainted and were scattered abroad as
[43:20] sheep having no shepherd he's looking
[43:23] in a spiritual context there's a need
[43:26] for leadership
[43:28] and he's seeing it now he's already seen
[43:30] it designated it's sheep but they need a
[43:32] shepherd and notice how he follows this
[43:35] the harvest truly is plenteous
[43:38] the laborers are few
[43:41] pray ye therefore the lord of harvest
[43:45] that you may send for that he will send
[43:47] forth laborers into his harvest so
[43:50] god
[43:51] sees the need communicates the need and
[43:54] then he asked us
[43:56] pray about it
[43:59] pray about it
[44:00] this is the need
[44:01] this is what needs to be done i'm the
[44:04] one to do it but i won't do it without
[44:06] you praying
[44:08] amen i'd like to speak to you this
[44:10] morning the lord will help on our part
[44:13] in the kingdom
[44:15] may god bless you bless the reading of
[44:16] the word as you're being seated
[44:18] our
[44:19] part
[44:21] in the kingdom
[44:24] branham takes this in feast of the
[44:26] trumpets very opening
[44:31] statements
[44:33] yes the people let us bow our heads and
[44:35] he says lord on one occasion it was said
[44:38] by thy beloved disciples teach us to
[44:41] pray
[44:43] for when we catch sight of the great god
[44:46] of heaven
[44:47] we do realize how insufficient
[44:51] we are
[44:54] there's a lot that could be said with
[44:56] that statement when we can catch sight
[44:59] of the great god of heaven
[45:02] over and over as brother branham would
[45:05] speak to us in different places in the
[45:07] message and even giving us counsel in
[45:09] later times of the things that we are
[45:11] seeing the things that god is declaring
[45:13] the message that god
[45:15] has has brought to you and i that we
[45:18] might come to a living experience in
[45:21] jesus christ not a church experience but
[45:24] a living experience of the living god
[45:27] that
[45:28] reproduces the bible again in flesh
[45:32] and it's that's god's promise in this
[45:34] hour there would be a capping a
[45:36] culmination a finishing of the mystery
[45:40] of god which is the indwelling of the
[45:42] holy spirit in a life of a son and
[45:44] daughter of god
[45:46] many that could catch and see the great
[45:48] god they could see it and they would go
[45:51] off under impressions and other things
[45:54] but there's a great difference between
[45:56] an impression
[45:57] and inspiration
[45:59] because impression eventually wears off
[46:02] and we've seen that take place around
[46:04] the message impressions wear off after a
[46:07] while but there's a difference between
[46:09] impression and inspiration and when we
[46:11] can see the great god to really see it
[46:14] in in the light of what it is he says
[46:16] then we recognize our self insufficient
[46:19] now this is not meaning that we put
[46:21] ourselves down or i can't do this or i
[46:23] can't do that but we recognize that the
[46:26] god who is appearing and is making
[46:28] himself known that what god is doing by
[46:31] revealing himself to your eye it's god
[46:34] actually coming to let us know that i am
[46:37] the one who has come to do and to
[46:40] fulfill but i need you to serve in this
[46:43] part to recognize your weakness to
[46:47] recognize your insufficiency and to look
[46:50] to me in my sufficiency in order to
[46:53] bring past what i'm making known to you
[46:58] so he says so teach us to pray
[47:02] to teach us to pray lord in our hearts
[47:05] now for the things that would be
[47:07] beneficiary
[47:10] to thy kingdom
[47:12] and for thy servants
[47:15] you know the need of every person here
[47:18] so i would say it in this matter it's a
[47:22] when we look at this thought our part in
[47:24] the kingdom
[47:26] every one of us have a part
[47:28] and i
[47:29] we can speak of how that paul could
[47:32] write
[47:33] under inspiration in first corinthians
[47:35] 12 and speaks of how
[47:37] the same spirit that is divided and
[47:40] manifest with all there's ministering
[47:42] gifts there's nine spiritual gifts
[47:44] there's
[47:45] helps in the body all these things that
[47:47] are there but
[47:49] that's not what i'm focusing on here and
[47:51] that's not the inspiration of the
[47:53] channel of where i'm going this morning
[47:55] sure god has every one of those gifts
[47:57] but i'm
[47:58] looking at this in a manner that it
[48:00] comes down to each of our lives there's
[48:02] not one person sitting here this morning
[48:05] that i would go ahead and say and
[48:07] venture out that there's not one that
[48:10] would say oh i don't want to see any
[48:12] more of god in my life
[48:13] but on the contrary every one of us it
[48:16] is the desire within our lives to see
[48:19] more of god
[48:20] in our lives
[48:22] the desire is to see this word become
[48:25] manifest within our life
[48:27] that this word that god reveals to us
[48:30] remember there is a
[48:32] three-fold purpose to god and brother
[48:35] branham unfolds that to us god desires
[48:38] to make himself known and so god comes
[48:42] down and he makes himself known through
[48:44] flesh that's god revealing himself
[48:48] that's the first fold revelation is a
[48:51] necessity
[48:53] amen but it leads true revelation leads
[48:56] to the next phase which is preeminence
[49:00] it's to where the word then has
[49:02] oversight whatever god and please don't
[49:05] just limit it to the new birth though
[49:08] that is the foundation that is the
[49:10] necessity that's the ultimate but there
[49:13] must be a growing even from that part
[49:16] you see god did not bring about the new
[49:19] birth as though that we were just
[49:21] wandering out in the world and we're
[49:22] just walking around and you know just
[49:24] going about things and all of a sudden
[49:26] whammo it takes place no the spirit of
[49:30] god begins to deal with our hearts
[49:33] and he doesn't force us into anything he
[49:36] begins to draw on our hearts it might
[49:38] have been a billboard you read it might
[49:40] have been a pamphlet it might have been
[49:42] something that someone else said it
[49:44] might have been something in nature how
[49:46] god could speak through that but there
[49:48] had to be something that the spirit of
[49:50] god begins to get your attention he
[49:53] deals with your life but god will not
[49:56] repent for us the bible says we must
[50:00] repent but how can you repent if the
[50:03] goodness of god does not lead us into
[50:06] repentance god does his part to bring
[50:09] conviction we must do our part to repent
[50:14] is that right
[50:15] then the bible says that the blood it
[50:17] sanctifies but that is not something
[50:19] that it just we're standing and then god
[50:22] comes down and god just does it no it's
[50:24] us yielding ourselves our part is to
[50:28] welcome him and say lord
[50:30] my life all of these habits and
[50:33] everything that is standing between me
[50:36] and you i'm desiring these to be
[50:39] dissolved in my life if i've got to stay
[50:42] on my face day and night when i go to
[50:44] work i'm praying i want to be united
[50:48] with you that's doing our part
[50:52] god will not sanctify us just by us
[50:55] walking around and saying that's what
[50:56] needs to be done we first have to agree
[50:59] with the word but then our part is
[51:02] giving ourselves to the word that's been
[51:04] made known
[51:07] see we see how insufficient
[51:09] we are
[51:11] this is where it separates from just
[51:13] walking by a knowledge
[51:16] to walking then by divine revelation
[51:21] same thing when it comes
[51:23] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:26] only god can baptize
[51:29] only god can do that work
[51:32] is that right
[51:33] but he does it when a life is fully
[51:36] surrendered to him
[51:39] it's when that heart and you see it
[51:41] isn't always listen it isn't always
[51:43] together our mouth saying i surrender
[51:45] because sometimes the the whole part of
[51:48] the mouth can say surrender but god
[51:50] remember he's listening to our heart
[51:52] that's a powerful thing that's a great
[51:55] thing because sometimes we say things
[51:57] out of here but god looks down into the
[51:59] heart and god comes ministers to the
[52:01] heart
[52:02] sometimes we can say out of here oh i'm
[52:03] so insufficient i'm not able to do this
[52:06] i'm a failure but down on the inside as
[52:08] a believer a son and daughter of god
[52:10] that's what god comes to speak to
[52:12] because this natural man can't do
[52:14] nothing
[52:15] but it's the inside man that god comes
[52:18] to empower amen
[52:20] and when he shows up
[52:22] we recognize how insufficient we are but
[52:25] with that true recognition we submit
[52:28] ourselves to the living god that's right
[52:32] there before us and whatever he is
[52:35] asking of us and he's the one he comes
[52:38] and does the finishing work amen
[52:42] it's our part in the kingdom
[52:45] i read this
[52:48] i read this to
[52:50] you on thursday and this is where the
[52:52] thought
[52:53] originated from before we ever got into
[52:56] thursday's service just looking at some
[52:57] of these parts but i'm going to just
[53:00] read one quote and move from there in
[53:02] this thought our part in the kingdom
[53:05] i want you just to think of this in
[53:06] terms
[53:08] here's the lord jesus
[53:10] he's the capstone of the old testament
[53:14] what they were waiting on what the
[53:15] saints that were in paradise were
[53:17] waiting on he's the one that ezekiel saw
[53:19] the will in the middle of the wisdom
[53:21] he's the one that all of them the
[53:23] shadows spoke of him right there all of
[53:26] them all of the ages that was down spoke
[53:29] of his coming and it would come in
[53:32] fullness god would come in fullness and
[53:35] it had to come first in groom form
[53:37] notice who came in the garden it was not
[53:40] woman first it was man
[53:43] but the woman was already there but it
[53:45] took there a laying down in order for
[53:48] god to bring forth that hidden part that
[53:51] was in adam the whole time
[53:53] but adam had had to stand there in a
[53:56] fulfillment of god's word and that is
[53:58] the same way it it has been with that of
[54:01] the lord jesus to stand in the
[54:03] fulfillment of the word he fulfilled all
[54:07] of the parts
[54:09] that spoke of the bridegroom what he was
[54:12] supposed to do
[54:14] he finished it
[54:15] is that right as a matter of fact if
[54:17] when you look at the lord jesus he would
[54:20] even in speaking this in john the text
[54:23] that we read he speaks of it in this
[54:25] term i must finish
[54:28] the work that my father has given me to
[54:31] do
[54:32] now think of it
[54:34] god god could not could not do it
[54:36] without coming down in flesh
[54:40] you see the lord jesus here god coming
[54:43] down in flesh was now the example what
[54:47] they had heard about what even think of
[54:49] that that enoch hearing from his
[54:52] great-great-great-great-grandfather adam
[54:53] maybe in a coffee shop someday about how
[54:55] he walked with god now it's no longer
[54:58] just something you know enoch hasn't
[55:00] experienced but now thank all of those
[55:03] who are there they are witnessing one
[55:07] that has now
[55:08] manifesting what it was like inside of
[55:11] the garden of eden because adam was the
[55:14] first adam but the lord jesus is the
[55:16] second adam
[55:18] is that right then out of the second
[55:21] adam there comes a second eve there
[55:24] comes a bride that that is there and
[55:27] that bride will be and must be and let
[55:29] me just say is the manifestation of that
[55:33] second atom what is the second atom the
[55:36] quickening spirit amen
[55:38] is that right
[55:41] so within this
[55:44] the way that
[55:46] the bridegroom
[55:47] went about is the same way the bride
[55:50] will go about right
[55:51] just as the groom said i've not come to
[55:53] do my own will in other words
[55:56] coming here in this world and becoming
[55:57] occupied with things see that's a trap
[56:00] of satan to try to get us occupied with
[56:02] things out here
[56:04] that's a trap understand it's the trap
[56:07] right but you see the lord jesus when he
[56:09] came he's shown us what the reality let
[56:13] me say this the reality that the new
[56:15] birth brings in our life and the power
[56:19] that you and i have
[56:20] to be able to live in such a place of
[56:23] contact with god to where our desires
[56:26] and everything is culminated to see the
[56:29] work of god and the purpose of god not
[56:32] just for the in our in the economy but
[56:35] in our own lives
[56:38] in our own lives
[56:41] in our own lives our part our part in
[56:44] the kingdom
[56:47] think of this how brother brown made
[56:48] that thing help us to pray those things
[56:50] that would be
[56:52] beneficiary
[56:55] to thy kingdom well but simon i need
[56:56] things to be beneficiary for my family
[56:58] see
[56:59] ye
[57:00] first
[57:02] come on you can pull it with me
[57:04] and then all these other things notice
[57:06] before that he said your heavenly father
[57:09] knows what you have need of amen
[57:13] and there's things that god gives us
[57:15] sometimes that are even our wants
[57:18] they're not needs but they're wants
[57:21] can we get a witness on that
[57:23] so god unders god knows what's on that
[57:25] to don't let those things bypass you
[57:27] thank god as god knowing his care uh his
[57:32] his love and his care for our lives so
[57:34] think of it if we're focused upon that
[57:36] which is beneficiary to the kingdom then
[57:40] everything else within our lives
[57:44] everything will move right in place and
[57:47] in order as we're seeking amen to
[57:50] fulfill that part in the kingdom
[57:54] look at this with the lord jesus i
[57:55] referred i referred to this place
[57:59] on thursday evening we were talking
[58:00] about prayer and i just this is just
[58:02] stepping aside
[58:04] from that thursday service but yet i'm
[58:06] going to say it in this way it's very
[58:08] much much so focused around prayer
[58:12] okay i've got more to say on the
[58:14] thursdays but this is very much focused
[58:16] around prayer
[58:17] it came to pass in those days that
[58:19] speaking of the lord jesus he went out
[58:21] into a mountain to pray
[58:24] and continued all night in prayer to god
[58:27] you read through the scriptures jesus
[58:30] was very intentional in his prayer
[58:34] and if the groom had to be intentional
[58:36] the bride has to be intentional
[58:39] there's things that we we have to be
[58:42] intentional within our prayer life
[58:46] so over and over you'll find where the
[58:48] lord jesus he would go aside to pray
[58:53] watch how brother branham places this in
[58:55] the healing of jairus daughter
[58:58] he's referring back to this scripture he
[59:00] said just in the previous chapter
[59:03] we find one place there where the son of
[59:04] god spent so much time in prayer
[59:07] and if jesus had to spend much time in
[59:10] prayer to stay somebody say stay
[59:14] in fellowship with the spirit that was
[59:17] in him isn't that incredible
[59:19] you and i have experienced where there's
[59:20] a disconnect even in our own home but
[59:23] don't look at me strings
[59:24] you can eat at the same dinner table or
[59:26] whatever you just know you realize wait
[59:27] a minute we just it needs to be a more
[59:29] of a it needs to be a real connection
[59:32] that happens
[59:33] you understand this that's not evil it
[59:35] happens
[59:36] when you have to step away what do you
[59:38] do you step away and just have a
[59:40] connection focusing on one another
[59:43] right
[59:44] notice don't think of this that is where
[59:46] you and another person or me and my wife
[59:48] but think of this the spirit that was
[59:51] within him all right you know what it
[59:53] shows to me it shows i help i trust it
[59:55] shows to us that you and i can become
[59:58] disconnected when you're born of the
[1:00:00] spirit of god you can become
[1:00:02] disconnected from the influence of the
[1:00:04] holy spirit it doesn't mean you're going
[1:00:06] to go back out in the world
[1:00:08] because the riches have been burned if
[1:00:10] you've been born again there's no desire
[1:00:13] for the things of the world
[1:00:16] but who can get warm
[1:00:20] by a little fire
[1:00:22] right
[1:00:24] you have to feed the experience you have
[1:00:26] to feed
[1:00:28] stay notice stay in fellowship the groom
[1:00:31] in order to stay in fellowship to stay
[1:00:33] in harmony to stay in a channel to stay
[1:00:36] in a place of fellowship he had to stay
[1:00:39] in fellowship through much prayer with
[1:00:42] the spirit
[1:00:43] that was in him amen
[1:00:47] how much more he said do you and i have
[1:00:48] to spend in prayer and this is let's
[1:00:51] just be honest okay this is where satan
[1:00:53] battles us
[1:00:55] let's just be honest there's no there's
[1:00:57] no big eyes and little used there's no
[1:00:59] blue ribbons to be given out we're right
[1:01:01] here where the rubber meets the road
[1:01:04] said brother simon you're a pastor do
[1:01:06] you think satan doesn't didn't try to
[1:01:07] attack that
[1:01:09] brother about him over and over in the
[1:01:11] message influence voice of god in this
[1:01:12] last days on and on he speaks to us he
[1:01:15] says pastors
[1:01:16] don't you get yourself too busy that you
[1:01:19] can't
[1:01:20] get
[1:01:20] quiet
[1:01:21] before god
[1:01:23] to hear his voice
[1:01:26] i'm just going to speak very clearly
[1:01:28] that's why some things
[1:01:30] brother bram said a pastor acts low some
[1:01:32] things that seem like it's red light
[1:01:34] emergency ain't a red light emergency
[1:01:36] it can wait
[1:01:39] don't wait
[1:01:40] come on now all right that's why brother
[1:01:43] samuel i don't do a lot of
[1:01:44] fellowshipping out here all this and i
[1:01:46] don't because why
[1:01:48] i have a responsibility
[1:01:50] to receive from god and feed the flock
[1:01:54] and i can't feed you on my thoughts
[1:01:57] i can't feed upon things that even
[1:01:59] things that i can be looking at in the
[1:02:01] word i don't preach those things that
[1:02:03] are even coming to me at that moment
[1:02:06] wait for that inspiration and i believe
[1:02:08] that's what you want because man shall
[1:02:10] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:02:12] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:02:13] god and to know that there is a word for
[1:02:16] this season for this moment in our life
[1:02:19] anybody can open the bible anybody can
[1:02:21] quote a quote but we want to hear from
[1:02:24] god this morning amen
[1:02:28] anybody can put together a message and
[1:02:31] man put things together but there needs
[1:02:34] to be inspiration from the throne of god
[1:02:37] to meet the challenge of the hour and
[1:02:39] how is he meeting the challenge he's
[1:02:41] inspiring you and me to stand up on his
[1:02:45] word and take our responsibility and our
[1:02:47] part in the kingdom
[1:02:50] that's grace for you and i
[1:02:52] aren't you glad for that grace
[1:02:54] how much more do you and i have to spend
[1:02:56] in prayer much
[1:02:58] time in prayer
[1:03:00] if you only know what time and prayer
[1:03:02] meant
[1:03:03] i would just say it like this for all of
[1:03:05] us god help me to see that even more yes
[1:03:08] amen how about to see that even more
[1:03:11] what time in prayer amen
[1:03:16] much time and prayer now notice this
[1:03:20] sometimes when you're in prayer
[1:03:23] god changes the complete destination of
[1:03:25] different things that's going to happen
[1:03:27] i could probably highlight that
[1:03:28] sometimes
[1:03:30] sometimes we're praying in a certain
[1:03:32] direction and we're always in the will
[1:03:33] of god we're praying for healing we just
[1:03:35] don't know how healing is going to come
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:39] sometimes healing is on to the other
[1:03:41] side
[1:03:42] sometimes healing
[1:03:45] right when we stand on the other side it
[1:03:46] don't matter what they suffer with in
[1:03:47] this life it's gone
[1:03:49] when you stand on the other side right
[1:03:52] you've been delivered from this
[1:03:53] terrestrial into the celestial
[1:03:56] right and they're waiting on the
[1:03:57] glorified
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:00] sometimes healing comes
[1:04:03] by way of medicine
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:07] surgery
[1:04:09] sometimes healing comes
[1:04:11] miraculously
[1:04:12] the ego swoops down and picks us up
[1:04:15] all right right
[1:04:17] there's many different ways of how that
[1:04:20] healing can come and that's just healing
[1:04:22] that
[1:04:23] that even isn't included sometimes the
[1:04:25] things that we're praying about and we
[1:04:28] must always pray i believe in this
[1:04:30] manner that if
[1:04:31] it be thy will
[1:04:34] sometimes when you're in prayer god
[1:04:36] changes the complete destination of
[1:04:37] different things that's going to happen
[1:04:39] he said do you believe that there might
[1:04:41] be something fixing to happen and your
[1:04:42] prayer could change the whole situation
[1:04:44] now look at this statement here
[1:04:46] look at this statement well you say
[1:04:50] if god knows it's going to happen
[1:04:53] what would my prayer do
[1:04:56] now we're getting into the subject our
[1:04:58] part
[1:04:59] in the kingdom if god knows it's going
[1:05:01] to happen
[1:05:02] what good is my part in it
[1:05:05] you see
[1:05:06] this is this is a work
[1:05:09] of satan to try to take away from our
[1:05:12] part
[1:05:16] it's just like if a person says
[1:05:18] i'm predestinated i'll be there if
[1:05:22] you're predestinated you live like it
[1:05:24] that's right
[1:05:26] right god does not pull us through a
[1:05:28] pipe
[1:05:31] he did not pull us through a pipe
[1:05:33] and then say blessed is he that
[1:05:35] overcometh what did you overcome he
[1:05:36] pulled you through
[1:05:38] right right
[1:05:40] our part in the kingdom
[1:05:42] see all the way down through the
[1:05:43] scriptures we can fellowship abraham was
[1:05:45] predestinated oh no no no but look what
[1:05:48] their lives their lives are expresses
[1:05:51] out of a life that the revelation that
[1:05:54] came to them
[1:05:56] it took hold of their life and they were
[1:05:58] working to take hold of that revelation
[1:06:01] and bring it into fruition in their
[1:06:04] lives by the help of god
[1:06:07] is that right
[1:06:08] the bible said when it was revealed to
[1:06:09] know about the ark
[1:06:11] the impending judgment
[1:06:15] no one noah could not stand there and
[1:06:17] say ah come forth
[1:06:19] right right
[1:06:21] come on now there's a lot of things we'd
[1:06:22] like to say art come forth
[1:06:24] this come forward
[1:06:26] but sometimes there's things in our life
[1:06:28] that we can see and we see our
[1:06:30] shortcomings we can see the areas the
[1:06:32] cloud i need more of you and god brings
[1:06:35] you and i to a place of sincerity and
[1:06:39] desperation in prayer amen
[1:06:43] because anything that's given as a
[1:06:45] silver spoon you never appreciate it
[1:06:50] if god knows it's going to happen what
[1:06:52] what would my prayer do
[1:06:55] he said you remember when he was looking
[1:06:56] out upon the harvest he said the harvest
[1:06:58] is ripe laborers are few but pray ye the
[1:07:01] lord of the harvest that he will send
[1:07:02] laborers into his harvest in other words
[1:07:04] here's the amplified in other words pray
[1:07:07] to me that i will send laborers into my
[1:07:10] harvest which i'm just telling you it's
[1:07:14] such a needy thing
[1:07:17] well if you know it needs to be done
[1:07:19] lord go ahead and do it no no you've got
[1:07:21] a part amen that's right i'm telling you
[1:07:24] what needs to be done
[1:07:26] now you pray amen
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:30] i want you to think of it in this way
[1:07:32] the bible is one book right
[1:07:35] but there's the old testament that's the
[1:07:37] bridegroom
[1:07:38] there is the new testament which is the
[1:07:40] bride that which came out of the old
[1:07:43] testament that which came out of adam
[1:07:45] that which came out of him at calvary
[1:07:48] and now is being made up what is the
[1:07:50] bride of jesus christ what has the
[1:07:52] believers been down through the ages
[1:07:55] those that have been born by his spirit
[1:07:57] with his word in that hour have taken
[1:07:59] that word lived by that word become that
[1:08:02] word expressed that word and went to
[1:08:05] make up that part of the body for upon
[1:08:08] this rock i will
[1:08:10] build my church
[1:08:13] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:08:16] against it
[1:08:17] but we are partners in the building amen
[1:08:22] are you hearing me now
[1:08:25] peter said
[1:08:26] you add to
[1:08:28] your faith
[1:08:29] you had to
[1:08:31] you add to right
[1:08:33] you say well there must be the holy
[1:08:35] spirit that's true but we have to see
[1:08:37] the need for that to be added
[1:08:41] our part
[1:08:42] in the kingdom
[1:08:44] notice brother around the very next
[1:08:45] statement he says
[1:08:48] but part of it
[1:08:50] lays
[1:08:51] in human beings
[1:08:53] he said do you believe that do we
[1:08:55] believe that amen
[1:08:57] the kingdom of god lays within the human
[1:08:59] being now jesus said in one place
[1:09:02] i am the vine you're the branches the
[1:09:04] vine can't bear fruit the branches and
[1:09:06] the vine bears fruit god cannot bear
[1:09:09] fruit of his self
[1:09:11] it's got to take the church
[1:09:14] he says is that right it's got to take
[1:09:16] you branches to bear fruit
[1:09:18] and when you branches are yielded to the
[1:09:21] vine
[1:09:22] then fruit comes forth
[1:09:25] god wants
[1:09:27] your hands yes amen
[1:09:29] you want your eyes he wants your tongue
[1:09:31] you want your lips you want your ears
[1:09:33] want your hands and feet so he can bring
[1:09:36] forth fruit
[1:09:38] through
[1:09:40] amen
[1:09:41] i want you to think of this you've seen
[1:09:43] me give this example here dozens of
[1:09:45] times and i've done it in other meetings
[1:09:46] as it's come to me if i asked brother
[1:09:49] joy to put this coat on me
[1:09:52] and i stand here limp
[1:09:54] you know what i mean by lymph right
[1:09:57] good luck trying to get it on
[1:10:01] that's not yielding but yield it is i
[1:10:04] see the need for the joy could you help
[1:10:05] me put my coat on i see the need see now
[1:10:09] i see that need and i'm asking him to
[1:10:11] help me
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:13] so he comes up and he said put your arm
[1:10:15] right in here brother sam okay i got it
[1:10:17] right in there then he comes around this
[1:10:19] way so here here here let me let me just
[1:10:21] i know where that sleeve holds that let
[1:10:22] me take a hold of this right over here
[1:10:24] and i'll put it in there for you
[1:10:27] thanks
[1:10:28] he can't do it
[1:10:30] without my cooperation
[1:10:33] the word can't come to pass in our life
[1:10:36] without our cooperation
[1:10:39] amen
[1:10:40] we must cooperate
[1:10:42] with the word of god
[1:10:45] john 15 1 let me go to the scripture
[1:10:47] that brother branham is referring to
[1:10:49] here and
[1:10:50] use for a basis here for the next few
[1:10:52] moments
[1:10:54] jesus has said i am the true vine and my
[1:10:57] father is the husband
[1:10:59] now notice the my father is the husband
[1:11:03] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:11:04] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:11:07] that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it
[1:11:09] may bring forth more fruit so what
[1:11:13] so
[1:11:13] what is the
[1:11:15] um the deciding factor on whether a
[1:11:18] branch stays or whether a branch goes
[1:11:23] whether it's bearing fruit
[1:11:25] fruit
[1:11:26] in other words is it doing its part
[1:11:29] is it serving its purpose
[1:11:32] if it's serving its purpose now think of
[1:11:34] uh look here in verse two it's evident
[1:11:37] if a branch can be purged or removed
[1:11:40] it's not went all the way
[1:11:44] but there's necessary fruits for
[1:11:46] justification
[1:11:48] come on now
[1:11:49] there's necessary there's fruits for
[1:11:50] sanctification
[1:11:52] right
[1:11:53] and then it leads into the fruits that
[1:11:55] come forth from a life that is
[1:11:57] completely
[1:11:59] uh born in jesus christ
[1:12:05] see this is why
[1:12:06] it's been crucial in a person's life
[1:12:08] don't you don't look at one another
[1:12:11] right you let god deal with you
[1:12:13] individually
[1:12:15] and what god is dealing with your heart
[1:12:17] individually you respond to that word
[1:12:20] give yourself to it don't don't
[1:12:23] don't don't allow
[1:12:24] things to come up oh well you're not
[1:12:26] here or you're not there god doesn't do
[1:12:28] that
[1:12:32] within within a service like this or any
[1:12:34] other service there should be
[1:12:37] the effect of the word going forth
[1:12:40] that's not
[1:12:41] not doing the maturing for us but is
[1:12:43] speaking to us those things that we must
[1:12:45] need to give ourselves to
[1:12:48] that he might do it
[1:12:53] i want to go deeper
[1:12:55] i want to go deeper
[1:12:57] i want to go deeper
[1:13:01] now you are clean through the word which
[1:13:03] i have spoken so it's the word that
[1:13:06] brings cleansing right and
[1:13:10] no matter
[1:13:11] in our lives we know this this scripture
[1:13:14] it's the word that brings a cleansing in
[1:13:16] other words it's the word that comes to
[1:13:17] sanctify word that calls us into a place
[1:13:21] of cleansing this is why remember the
[1:13:23] holy spirit will never come into a dirty
[1:13:26] vessel
[1:13:28] people can receive anointings on their
[1:13:30] spirit and everything else but see it's
[1:13:31] the word
[1:13:33] that comes to cleanse that the word
[1:13:36] himself might come and dwell in
[1:13:38] i mean let's just face it there's places
[1:13:40] that you wouldn't go
[1:13:43] there's things that you you know hey
[1:13:45] listen listen listen
[1:13:46] uh you know
[1:13:47] when i was teaching school i had kids
[1:13:49] that would come around they want to give
[1:13:50] you cupcakes or water more i see what
[1:13:52] they did when they walked in my door
[1:13:58] no thank you
[1:13:59] don't even put it on my desk but i did
[1:14:01] it respectfully why i don't want that
[1:14:04] that's for me to do
[1:14:07] are you with me all right
[1:14:11] there's some things i understand brother
[1:14:12] behind me everything ought to be
[1:14:13] received and saint vacation and prayer
[1:14:15] that's right and i love it when i don't
[1:14:16] know about it especially in a restaurant
[1:14:18] or whatever more
[1:14:20] but when i know about it
[1:14:26] you see what i'm saying the holy spirit
[1:14:28] he will not come into a place
[1:14:31] that he has not made ready and prepared
[1:14:34] for himself
[1:14:36] but yet then even in our own lives daily
[1:14:40] service after service we know as we rub
[1:14:43] shoulders with the world
[1:14:46] hey brothers and sisters we can't live
[1:14:47] in a bubble we know that
[1:14:49] we can't go live in a cave right
[1:14:52] you know lock ourselves up in our houses
[1:14:54] and well i'm not going to have any
[1:14:56] contact with the world no we are in the
[1:14:58] world but we're not of the world
[1:15:01] there's things sometimes we hear that
[1:15:04] vex us
[1:15:06] things we see we didn't ask to see
[1:15:09] things we hear and we feel dirty and
[1:15:11] we're not the ones who did it all right
[1:15:14] but this is where we have an access to
[1:15:17] the washing of water by the word
[1:15:21] not only is the word come to you and i
[1:15:24] that it might bring forth to our life
[1:15:27] but that same word is preparing the
[1:15:30] pathway for himself to come so that you
[1:15:33] and i can stand there under the
[1:15:35] cleansing of the word and washing away
[1:15:38] all of those things that we might be
[1:15:40] able to stand there and ask for the
[1:15:42] things that he's asking us to ask for
[1:15:48] abide in me verse four and i in you as
[1:15:51] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:15:54] accepted to bear in the
[1:15:55] abide in the vine
[1:15:57] nor
[1:15:58] no more can ye
[1:16:00] accept ye abide
[1:16:03] in me
[1:16:05] verse 5 i am divine
[1:16:08] you are the branches no it's this is
[1:16:10] positioning now
[1:16:11] it's letting us know our part of the
[1:16:13] positioning
[1:16:14] he that abideth in me
[1:16:16] and i in him
[1:16:18] the same bringeth forth
[1:16:21] much
[1:16:22] fruit
[1:16:23] for without me you can do nothing right
[1:16:27] the speaking of in verse five this is a
[1:16:29] full work a life that has been fully
[1:16:33] moved into a place with god him abiding
[1:16:37] the person in the worshipper abiding
[1:16:40] completely in god and god dwelling in
[1:16:43] them it burned that life brings forth
[1:16:45] fruit for without me you can do nothing
[1:16:50] but we have a part to play yes amen
[1:16:53] simon what are you saying i'm saying
[1:16:55] that it's very intentional in our life
[1:16:57] of how we must give ourselves to the
[1:16:59] things that god is speaking to very
[1:17:00] personally in our lives
[1:17:03] there's things that out of a service
[1:17:04] here you come out of one service there's
[1:17:07] things that the joshua you could be
[1:17:08] praying about god has spoke to your
[1:17:10] heart
[1:17:10] there's things that brother and you
[1:17:12] could be praying about brother dave and
[1:17:13] you all get together and say no no this
[1:17:15] is what i'm praying because god is
[1:17:17] personal
[1:17:19] he's working personally in our lives
[1:17:22] maybe it's on how we're facing a
[1:17:24] situation and maybe it's not about a
[1:17:27] situation we're in it's because remember
[1:17:29] now let me just say like this even the
[1:17:31] tested trials the situations that we go
[1:17:33] through are not separated from the word
[1:17:37] being made manifest in our life because
[1:17:39] sometimes with tests and trials and
[1:17:41] experiences god uses them to keep us
[1:17:44] humble to keep us out of pride and
[1:17:47] looking to him and god will mold the
[1:17:51] character in our life through those
[1:17:53] experiences and then there's other
[1:17:55] things in our life that we can look at
[1:17:57] and god we begin to see in our life and
[1:18:00] we put ourselves before the throne of
[1:18:02] god amen
[1:18:07] maybe there's certain things that you
[1:18:08] wish you was a little bit more patient
[1:18:14] and you can go before the throne of god
[1:18:15] and say lord
[1:18:17] i want more patience added
[1:18:19] and not i want more lord i want more
[1:18:22] lord i need more lord
[1:18:27] let me show live in a place lord that
[1:18:30] i'm not affected my spirit is not
[1:18:33] affected by the things that goes on
[1:18:35] around me because as i said we do not
[1:18:38] live
[1:18:40] isolated from that but we must walk in
[1:18:44] this world
[1:18:45] and god there is a part that we have
[1:18:47] here
[1:18:48] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:18:50] forth as a branch
[1:18:52] and is withered and men gather them and
[1:18:55] cast them into the fire
[1:18:57] and they are burned
[1:19:02] if you abide in me
[1:19:04] and my words abide in you you shall ask
[1:19:07] what you will
[1:19:09] and it shall be done unto you
[1:19:12] can you read that verse of scripture
[1:19:13] with me
[1:19:14] if ye abide in me
[1:19:17] and my words abide in you
[1:19:19] ye shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:19:22] be done unto you amen
[1:19:27] there's some parts in that and that's
[1:19:29] what i want to work with on just just a
[1:19:30] few moments
[1:19:32] herein is my father glorified that ye
[1:19:34] bear
[1:19:35] much fruit so shall you be
[1:19:38] my disciples
[1:19:40] brother branham he picks up
[1:19:43] that same scripture that we've read
[1:19:45] looking upon
[1:19:46] the field
[1:19:48] seeing the need for laborers to go forth
[1:19:51] and the lord jesus
[1:19:53] speaking to
[1:19:54] the disciples
[1:19:56] i want you to pray
[1:19:58] that the lord of harvest he was the lord
[1:20:00] of harvest
[1:20:02] so he's telling them you need something
[1:20:04] to pray about this is what you pray
[1:20:06] about
[1:20:08] so you see
[1:20:09] reality
[1:20:11] is
[1:20:11] prayer
[1:20:13] is not something we're wondering what do
[1:20:14] i pray about
[1:20:16] god lets us know
[1:20:19] as he deals personally in our life the
[1:20:21] things that we're to be praying about
[1:20:25] i know there's a lot of needs there's a
[1:20:26] lot of needs and things that take place
[1:20:29] sometimes it seems like with the amount
[1:20:30] of needs and things that are all around
[1:20:32] but
[1:20:33] don't
[1:20:34] don't allow that
[1:20:36] to be the all
[1:20:38] right
[1:20:45] another word this is brother brown
[1:20:46] taking that same scripture we just
[1:20:48] referred to again of the harvest in
[1:20:50] other words you ask me to do just what i
[1:20:53] know
[1:20:54] that's got to be done
[1:20:56] but yet
[1:20:57] you got to ask me for it lord you just
[1:21:00] told me what i needed
[1:21:03] are you going to ask me
[1:21:06] but you know what needs to be done in my
[1:21:07] life lord let the transforming power
[1:21:10] lord what you spoke to me you know what
[1:21:12] needs to be done yeah but are you going
[1:21:13] to ask me
[1:21:15] all right
[1:21:17] are you going to do your part
[1:21:20] are you going to pray
[1:21:22] lord
[1:21:23] how am i going to work this in
[1:21:25] jesus spent much time
[1:21:27] in prayer
[1:21:28] see i would i would say this very
[1:21:30] clearly for each of our lives
[1:21:33] if we start and really evaluate
[1:21:36] and say lord
[1:21:37] is there some time that's gotten away
[1:21:39] that i need to
[1:21:41] buy back redeem the time
[1:21:44] if there's some things that i've allowed
[1:21:46] to encroach
[1:21:48] where i can redeem the time amen
[1:21:52] i'm speaking to all of us
[1:21:54] speaking to all of us
[1:21:56] said you have not asked you have out you
[1:21:59] have not
[1:22:00] because you ask not think of that
[1:22:02] principle here when the word's coming
[1:22:04] forth
[1:22:05] yes lord that's true and then we don't
[1:22:07] ask
[1:22:08] and then you get discouraged well i
[1:22:10] don't see it in my life have you done
[1:22:11] your part
[1:22:13] you see part of asking is obedience to
[1:22:16] the word
[1:22:18] that's part of the fear of the lord is
[1:22:20] to recognize and reverence him that
[1:22:22] speaking he knows what we have need of
[1:22:25] in our lives
[1:22:28] lord i don't feel like i'm growing have
[1:22:29] you been asking
[1:22:35] you have not because you ask not you ask
[1:22:36] not because you
[1:22:38] believe not that's a different part how
[1:22:40] the enemy wants to how things can be
[1:22:42] troubled in there because you believe
[1:22:44] not things that would like to try to
[1:22:45] hinder
[1:22:47] faith in prayer but i want to stay
[1:22:49] focused on this here this morning
[1:22:53] and i'm saying in this manner i'm going
[1:22:54] to read a few few statements here from
[1:22:56] the message
[1:22:59] how it's made so clear simple
[1:23:02] terms
[1:23:03] regarding john 15.
[1:23:05] and if you you recognize as a message
[1:23:07] believer
[1:23:09] that john 15 is a paramount scripture
[1:23:14] if ye abide in me and my words abide in
[1:23:16] you
[1:23:17] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:23:19] it is the theme and the thrust of what
[1:23:22] should be present as the manifestation
[1:23:25] of the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:27] a life that is abiding in him and he in
[1:23:29] him and them and they are in tune
[1:23:32] with the supernatural and they are
[1:23:34] asking those things that he is speaking
[1:23:36] to them
[1:23:38] notice so it's the vine i want you just
[1:23:40] to catch this part it's the vine that
[1:23:42] energizes
[1:23:44] or inspires the branch to ask
[1:23:46] or how would we know what to ask for
[1:23:48] right
[1:23:50] probably every one of you have sat down
[1:23:51] in a restaurant or sometime
[1:23:53] i i really don't like going to
[1:23:55] restaurants that i don't know you know
[1:23:56] that's just me by the time you'll never
[1:23:58] try anything new i know i know but
[1:24:00] sometimes you go into a place and
[1:24:03] you know you have to ask them what's
[1:24:04] good here
[1:24:05] that's their opinion
[1:24:09] i mean i like that kind of fish
[1:24:11] i may not like this i may not like that
[1:24:14] right you understand what i'm saying you
[1:24:16] go and what you're getting is their
[1:24:17] opinion
[1:24:18] all right
[1:24:21] but god's not giving us his opinion
[1:24:25] he's giving to you and i'm speaking to
[1:24:28] you and i what he desires to see come
[1:24:31] forth in our life
[1:24:33] this is where
[1:24:34] even bible scholars will go back in the
[1:24:36] book of genesis and say that god is
[1:24:39] repeating himself he's not repeating
[1:24:41] himself god is declaring
[1:24:44] what is to be done and god is looking
[1:24:47] for you and i the part in creation is to
[1:24:50] respond for what he's what he's calling
[1:24:53] for by us saying
[1:24:55] be it unto me amen
[1:25:01] brother braham tells us in power
[1:25:03] transformation that the the earth itself
[1:25:05] became a water garden of eden because it
[1:25:06] obeyed the voice of god
[1:25:09] the voice of god is the word of god
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:11] it's the will of god it's the trans
[1:25:13] within it it's the transforming power of
[1:25:15] god
[1:25:16] the earth itself being an ice was a big
[1:25:20] conqueror of ice
[1:25:22] but it obeyed the voice of god the voice
[1:25:24] of god held transforming power within it
[1:25:27] but it didn't transform it right where
[1:25:29] it was at
[1:25:30] it was transforming power a power that
[1:25:32] if that earth could yield
[1:25:34] it could bring it into a place as more
[1:25:36] that it yielded it brought it into a
[1:25:38] place to its position
[1:25:41] that's the same with our lives
[1:25:45] we see the transforming power of god but
[1:25:48] our part is yielding to them
[1:25:51] seeking after that praying after those
[1:25:53] things
[1:25:54] and what is it it's god drawing us
[1:25:57] into that place of position
[1:26:00] but the brahman talks about he says you
[1:26:02] know if we fail he says
[1:26:04] to see the power that god has placed in
[1:26:06] his people god is in his people
[1:26:10] and he speaks of the scriptures of how
[1:26:12] god was with his people one time when he
[1:26:14] walked on earth but now god is in his
[1:26:16] people a little while the world sees me
[1:26:17] no more yet you'll see me
[1:26:20] for i personal proton will be with you
[1:26:23] and in you to the end of the world i
[1:26:25] want you just to these are familiar some
[1:26:27] of these are very familiar pastors this
[1:26:28] is not deep
[1:26:30] but it'll bring out the depth of god in
[1:26:32] our life all right
[1:26:34] god dwells moves works in mankind
[1:26:40] god doesn't work through orders
[1:26:42] he doesn't work through organizations
[1:26:45] you say what do you mean by
[1:26:46] organizations those that have their own
[1:26:48] mind
[1:26:50] and god can't move according to his word
[1:26:52] but they have their own thoughts about
[1:26:54] god remember that was the religious of
[1:26:57] that day crucified the lord jesus
[1:26:59] because of their own thoughts
[1:27:02] they couldn't accept the manifestation
[1:27:05] of god
[1:27:06] according to his word right
[1:27:09] so god doesn't work he can't work
[1:27:10] through organizations i would just say
[1:27:12] it like this lord i don't want to be a
[1:27:14] know-it-all
[1:27:15] i don't want to have it all figured out
[1:27:17] i want to be looking to you amen
[1:27:20] he works through individuals god works
[1:27:22] in man god doesn't do the work today
[1:27:25] that's a powerful statement
[1:27:27] god doesn't do the work today
[1:27:30] he
[1:27:30] energizes or projects his spirit into
[1:27:34] men to do so for he said i'm the vine
[1:27:37] the vine don't bear fruit ye are the
[1:27:40] branches that's a very important
[1:27:41] statement god doesn't do the work today
[1:27:44] he energizes or projects his spirit now
[1:27:47] let me just say this
[1:27:48] it is very important and you hear it
[1:27:50] preached across this pulpit you hear it
[1:27:52] through the message of the hour that it
[1:27:54] must be god to do the work amen is that
[1:27:58] right but listen the scriptures in the
[1:28:00] book of psalms except the lord build the
[1:28:03] house they that labor labor in vain
[1:28:07] but it didn't say don't do no labor but
[1:28:09] labor according to the inspiration that
[1:28:13] god is giving amen amen
[1:28:16] glory be to god
[1:28:18] it's laboring under the inspiration of
[1:28:21] him who holds the blueprint and he's
[1:28:24] able to release the inspiration for our
[1:28:27] part as a lively stone that's part of
[1:28:30] this temple
[1:28:35] see it's that same inspiration
[1:28:37] that sets the word in motion
[1:28:39] it's the same inspiration that ezekiel
[1:28:41] saw
[1:28:42] where when the when when the living
[1:28:44] creatures were lifted up the wheels were
[1:28:47] lifted up on the earth see the wheels on
[1:28:49] earth reflected the living creatures
[1:28:51] there's all the tank of the holy spirit
[1:28:53] working through the ages so whatever
[1:28:55] characteristic it was reflected through
[1:28:58] earth
[1:29:00] so the whales responded to that
[1:29:02] we're the wheels
[1:29:04] i said we're the wills
[1:29:06] hey the words walking in shoe leather
[1:29:09] we are the wills
[1:29:11] amen so it's the same way as a composer
[1:29:15] the director
[1:29:16] and the symphony all coming together
[1:29:19] right
[1:29:20] right not somebody in the symphony back
[1:29:22] there you know as a violinist i think
[1:29:25] the composer here
[1:29:26] the composer should have wrote this for
[1:29:28] this time
[1:29:29] he should have done this
[1:29:34] your violinist you've got your part
[1:29:36] but your part is is to heed to the
[1:29:38] director who's in the spirit of the
[1:29:40] composer when you heat to that then the
[1:29:42] compo the spirit of the composer moving
[1:29:44] through the director moves through you
[1:29:46] and it's all one great big symphony
[1:29:49] and what becomes out of the symphony is
[1:29:50] the same inspiration that hit the
[1:29:52] composer that then has revealed to the
[1:29:54] director and come out to uni
[1:29:57] it was a mouthful lord
[1:29:59] but you understand we're not living by
[1:30:02] bread alone amen
[1:30:05] the brandon will make this statement
[1:30:06] again
[1:30:08] he says
[1:30:09] he says he has jesus has no eyes tonight
[1:30:12] but mine and yours on earth he has no
[1:30:13] hands but mine and yours he has no voice
[1:30:15] but mine and yours
[1:30:17] and he is the spirit in us and we are
[1:30:20] the branches to bear fruit
[1:30:23] as
[1:30:25] he
[1:30:26] energizes us
[1:30:28] so i'm not working by my own energy
[1:30:31] god hasn't asked you and i have to when
[1:30:33] you energize yourself no no he says
[1:30:35] you're the branch but i will energize
[1:30:37] you i will project my spirit i'll let
[1:30:40] you know what you need to be praying
[1:30:43] about and give yourself to
[1:30:45] because as you give yourself what i'm
[1:30:47] actually declaring to you this is my
[1:30:49] desire that i want to see fulfill and
[1:30:52] express through your life back to me
[1:30:55] do you realize what the rapture is all
[1:30:57] about it's where the full desire has
[1:31:00] come into full fruition and now there's
[1:31:03] a bride standing on earth and the
[1:31:05] bridegroom is attracted to the word that
[1:31:08] he sees made flesh in the life of the
[1:31:10] bride
[1:31:13] hallelujah
[1:31:15] when attracted to the realm on the
[1:31:18] mountain with abraham
[1:31:20] the almighty god
[1:31:22] energized
[1:31:23] abraham
[1:31:25] i'm telling you you could have never
[1:31:26] read what you read in genesis 22 back in
[1:31:29] genesis 12. it was there but you
[1:31:31] couldn't read it there
[1:31:33] what happened energizing after
[1:31:35] energizing after energizing sure there
[1:31:37] were failures sure there were
[1:31:38] misunderstandings but abraham kept
[1:31:41] walking under the energizing of the holy
[1:31:44] spirit and eventually what god knew was
[1:31:47] in him the whole time
[1:31:49] became manifest in genesis 22. amen
[1:31:52] that's the same for you and me
[1:31:55] you hear me
[1:31:56] i said that's the same for you and me
[1:31:58] abraham had to do his part
[1:32:01] god said i need to show this type but i
[1:32:04] can't do it
[1:32:05] i need you
[1:32:06] all right
[1:32:08] let me just stay with
[1:32:10] as he energizes
[1:32:12] somebody say they're with me as he
[1:32:15] energizes
[1:32:17] you think of scriptures right now i can
[1:32:18] do
[1:32:20] all things
[1:32:21] through christ who
[1:32:22] strengtheneth me
[1:32:24] energized
[1:32:27] we're not talking about the bunny we're
[1:32:28] talking about eagles
[1:32:32] the battery power man wears out after a
[1:32:34] while we're talking about supernatural
[1:32:36] holy ghost power
[1:32:40] my notice he energizes i'm just going to
[1:32:43] refer to a few places in these quotes
[1:32:45] and move to wrap this up notice he
[1:32:48] energizes
[1:32:49] the the vines to bring forth fruit he
[1:32:52] pours his energy
[1:32:54] into us
[1:32:57] he energizes the vine with his life
[1:33:01] so that if the need and the purpose of
[1:33:04] the hours to bring
[1:33:06] apples if that's the kind of tree it is
[1:33:09] the energy that's coming forth
[1:33:12] from the vine
[1:33:14] they're apples
[1:33:16] right right and if the branch
[1:33:19] is ordained as an apple branch right
[1:33:22] well how do i know if i'm an apple
[1:33:23] branch get into the shekinah like
[1:33:25] aaron's rod did
[1:33:28] amen it manifests and declares what it
[1:33:31] was the whole time
[1:33:32] the shekinah did not make it an almond
[1:33:34] brass it was always an almond breath the
[1:33:37] shekinah only revealed here's a branch
[1:33:40] there's nothing there for just a dead
[1:33:42] dry stick but in the presence of
[1:33:45] almighty god in one 24-hour period
[1:33:49] hallelujah
[1:33:50] button blossom and bore almonds
[1:33:56] that's tremendous that's what god does
[1:33:58] by the new birth
[1:34:01] and then as we continue to grow and bear
[1:34:03] fruit sometimes we're still looking for
[1:34:04] that but it blossomed almonds in 24
[1:34:07] hours
[1:34:08] right right well i know i'm speaking to
[1:34:10] some veterans sitting around here we're
[1:34:11] still lord i tell you i want that same
[1:34:14] kind of experience no that experience
[1:34:15] was necessary for you now to wait in
[1:34:17] patience and believe and stand on his
[1:34:18] word
[1:34:19] right
[1:34:20] sometimes you mean you have to wait for
[1:34:21] a season right
[1:34:23] you gotta i mean you you can't go out
[1:34:24] there right now and say man i like some
[1:34:26] good old apple pie right now i'd like to
[1:34:27] have some but you can't go out there and
[1:34:29] you can't just go out and say you know
[1:34:30] i'm gonna go up to miller's today and go
[1:34:32] out there and pick apples it's not apple
[1:34:34] picking time
[1:34:35] you got to wait for that season right
[1:34:37] and for that season what you and i are
[1:34:39] looking for like two apple crisp apple
[1:34:41] dumpling apple pie
[1:34:44] somebody's got to go and they've got to
[1:34:46] trim those trees they've got to
[1:34:47] fertilize those trees they've got to
[1:34:49] care for them and while you and i are oh
[1:34:52] look at these wonderful things in the
[1:34:54] spring all the blossoms around my house
[1:34:56] those trees are out there blooming
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] there's a work that's going forth in
[1:35:02] that season that's right
[1:35:05] it's a silent work but nothing
[1:35:07] nonetheless it is a work
[1:35:11] it's not necessarily a public show
[1:35:12] because it isn't
[1:35:14] happening all at once but it's
[1:35:17] god is changing me
[1:35:20] little by little
[1:35:23] right
[1:35:29] and if we're branches we are energized
[1:35:32] with jesus christ you know reproduce
[1:35:34] the life
[1:35:36] of jesus christ
[1:35:42] i'll just stop there
[1:35:44] if i keep i keep going here we'll
[1:35:48] i thought
[1:35:49] or would just be on this today and then
[1:35:52] but god comes and he energizes
[1:35:56] and how does he energize us
[1:36:00] by his word
[1:36:04] don't misunderstand me god does not
[1:36:06] energize us
[1:36:08] by music
[1:36:12] god does not energize us it doesn't
[1:36:14] matter if it's a slow song a flat song
[1:36:16] that does not energize by music
[1:36:19] god does not energize us by our feelings
[1:36:26] but god energizes us
[1:36:28] by his word amen
[1:36:33] jesus said it like this in john 15 7 if
[1:36:36] you abide in me and my
[1:36:38] words
[1:36:41] rhema
[1:36:43] now logos logo says the concept is the
[1:36:46] thought
[1:36:48] it holds the mandate
[1:36:52] scholars
[1:36:53] bible readers
[1:36:55] can tap into and look at logos oh that
[1:36:57] makes sense oh that looks good boy i
[1:36:59] really like that
[1:37:02] but rhema is is that a woman which the
[1:37:06] holy spirit
[1:37:08] can reveal
[1:37:13] and it's that word that revelation
[1:37:16] that word when god speaks so personally
[1:37:18] to you and to me
[1:37:20] that's god energizing us
[1:37:23] this is why in this hour the urgency
[1:37:26] was needed not for a student to compare
[1:37:29] verse to verse brother branham tells us
[1:37:31] that and we see it he said it's got to
[1:37:32] take more than that all right
[1:37:35] he said it'll take more than knowing the
[1:37:37] greek and the hebrew he said we don't
[1:37:38] need that
[1:37:40] that's what he said
[1:37:41] what we need in this hour see the call
[1:37:43] in this hour was for
[1:37:46] one from the throne to issue fourth
[1:37:50] divine inspiration
[1:37:52] revelation
[1:37:53] he says it will take an operation of the
[1:37:55] holy ghost and that's what has opened
[1:37:58] our eyes
[1:38:00] and the same god that's opened our eyes
[1:38:02] to make this alive and real not just oh
[1:38:05] the message is so good oh i just really
[1:38:07] enjoyed the doctrines i no no no because
[1:38:09] a person can enjoy the doctrines and
[1:38:11] still not be a partaker of the life
[1:38:14] are you with me they can they can agree
[1:38:16] with it oh i agree with that oh i see
[1:38:18] this i see that but see seeing it here
[1:38:20] is not seeing the kingdom
[1:38:23] there's times at first we have to look
[1:38:25] at it
[1:38:26] and things that but it takes god and
[1:38:28] operation of the holy ghost
[1:38:30] to unfold these things to us
[1:38:32] and make it real
[1:38:35] is that right
[1:38:36] it doesn't mean that we understand
[1:38:38] everything
[1:38:41] but it means we know in whom we have
[1:38:43] been amen
[1:38:44] we know it's god who's present we know
[1:38:47] it's a living god
[1:38:49] that leadership has come to the church
[1:38:52] of the living god for our lives
[1:38:54] and these are things that you and i are
[1:38:56] are being inspired by god see the word
[1:38:59] as we're coming to the house of god it's
[1:39:02] the word
[1:39:03] the revelation of the holy spirit
[1:39:05] speaking to our lives personally now let
[1:39:07] me just i told you i was stopping and i
[1:39:09] meant that
[1:39:10] just just to close it in this part here
[1:39:17] but when i would say this right here
[1:39:19] when we are even preparing to come to
[1:39:21] the house of god
[1:39:23] if we can see the value
[1:39:25] of not just in that moment but even
[1:39:27] throughout the week and at different
[1:39:29] times
[1:39:30] lord jesus
[1:39:31] guide the man of god amen
[1:39:35] and not only guiding him but lord let my
[1:39:37] heart be prepared
[1:39:41] because
[1:39:43] you know satan's always after
[1:39:44] distractions
[1:39:46] he's always out sunday morning
[1:39:48] thursday evening through the week
[1:39:51] he's out
[1:39:53] to try and the pressures and things are
[1:39:55] all around us but let me say this to you
[1:39:59] see the value of just slipping away to
[1:40:01] say lord
[1:40:02] there's things that i know
[1:40:04] i can see in my life but there's things
[1:40:06] that you see
[1:40:08] that i have need
[1:40:12] let me be so inclined
[1:40:14] to where when the word of god the rhema
[1:40:17] word the spirit of god coming down and
[1:40:20] energizing that inner place that it
[1:40:22] finds a place to dwell in my life you
[1:40:25] see that word now it goes with you
[1:40:28] and you're praying over it
[1:40:30] maybe god reveals to your life
[1:40:32] you need a deeper walk
[1:40:34] you need more of this need more of that
[1:40:37] you see in your life and to see it's not
[1:40:39] always about us praying just saying i
[1:40:41] see this neither i see this shortcoming
[1:40:43] we do we should pray about those things
[1:40:45] we see things within our own self we see
[1:40:47] i see certain flaws and i see this and i
[1:40:49] see i see this
[1:40:52] listen god doesn't come to cut them out
[1:40:54] of our flesh but living in his presence
[1:40:56] will give us grace to discern
[1:40:58] and manifest an overcoming life of those
[1:41:01] things
[1:41:04] if there wasn't anything to overcome
[1:41:06] then how could the manifestation of
[1:41:08] overcoming power manifest itself through
[1:41:10] you
[1:41:12] but there are things that we must
[1:41:14] overcome
[1:41:15] there's a part that we have to play and
[1:41:17] i'd say god may we come into these
[1:41:19] places and really the prayer as we're
[1:41:22] coming into your lord
[1:41:24] speak to my heart let me know as it were
[1:41:26] you looked upon the fields and said pray
[1:41:28] to the lord of harvest that he will send
[1:41:30] laborers in the vineyard lord help me to
[1:41:32] be so sensitive that i can see what it
[1:41:34] is you're drawing my attention to amen
[1:41:37] think of it the disciples could have
[1:41:39] been standing right there and they were
[1:41:40] they were standing right there and
[1:41:41] they're just wow man look at the field
[1:41:44] but see when jesus takes a hold of
[1:41:46] something
[1:41:47] he lets him know do you really see it
[1:41:50] it's kind of like a picture
[1:41:52] do you really see it
[1:41:55] see when they seen it he let him see
[1:41:57] there was a need
[1:41:59] and this is something i need you to pray
[1:42:01] about
[1:42:02] i'm going to do it that i need you to
[1:42:04] pray
[1:42:05] i need you to ask me to do it so
[1:42:07] whatever your need is
[1:42:10] ask him
[1:42:12] he said ask the father anything in my
[1:42:14] name
[1:42:15] and i
[1:42:17] might do it
[1:42:18] i feel like doing it for what
[1:42:21] i will
[1:42:23] do
[1:42:27] sometimes how i feel like i've been
[1:42:29] asking for a while
[1:42:34] knock
[1:42:35] and it shall be open to you
[1:42:38] ask
[1:42:39] if
[1:42:40] that has been inspired to you it's
[1:42:42] energized you it's energized you to go
[1:42:45] to prayer
[1:42:47] energize you to ask god see the holy
[1:42:49] spirit comes to energize a life
[1:42:52] seek for the holy ghost
[1:42:54] seek to be sanctified
[1:42:56] seek after these things
[1:42:59] it's our part
[1:43:01] in the kingdom
[1:43:03] you love him amen
[1:43:04] i'm gonna say lord i want to do my part
[1:43:08] i want to do my part
[1:43:10] let's pray
[1:43:14] lord jesus
[1:43:17] thank you lord for your mercy
[1:43:21] thank you
[1:43:22] lord for your great
[1:43:25] just very personal personal grace to our
[1:43:28] lives

[1:43:33] the expanse lord
[1:43:35] those that are gathered here those that
[1:43:36] are more streaming by way of internet
[1:43:38] those that lord would archive this later
[1:43:40] on
[1:43:42] i just pray and i ask o lord jesus
[1:43:46] the lord may we
[1:43:48] just lord seeing
[1:43:51] that necessary part lord that lays of
[1:43:54] the kingdom that lays in us
[1:43:57] that these things that you have you make
[1:43:59] known to us
[1:44:00] is that we might take these things lord
[1:44:03] and pray
[1:44:05] and pray with faith and faith
[1:44:09] it's a revelation faith is a settlement
[1:44:12] this is what god has said
[1:44:14] he's not asked me to bring this to pass
[1:44:16] but he asked me to pray and to seek
[1:44:19] after this
[1:44:21] lord
[1:44:22] i don't know what the needs are
[1:44:25] i know some needs lord but
[1:44:27] you come in such a personal way
[1:44:30] now i pray god may there be such a stir
[1:44:36] such an energizing of the holy spirit to
[1:44:39] the branch
[1:44:40] that maybe that branch has
[1:44:42] not even come to repentance
[1:44:45] may they be energized this morning lord
[1:44:47] to repent of their sins
[1:44:50] energize to be baptized in the name of
[1:44:52] jesus christ
[1:44:54] energize lord god
[1:44:57] or a sanctified life lord
[1:45:01] energized oh god
[1:45:05] to receive the holy ghost
[1:45:08] surrender everything may they move by
[1:45:10] that inspiration that energizing that's
[1:45:14] coming forth in this moment
[1:45:18] father
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:20] grant it lord may they
[1:45:24] they move within that lord
[1:45:26] for each of these for the other needs
[1:45:28] that are present
[1:45:31] lord things that
[1:45:33] we can evaluate and see
[1:45:35] in our lives
[1:45:37] and lord
[1:45:39] we just don't want to
[1:45:40] come to you when we
[1:45:42] are just seeing things lord in our lives
[1:45:45] but
[1:45:45] you also lord want to just stay in that
[1:45:47] place of prayer
[1:45:50] but you've told us lord even as things
[1:45:52] that lord we can come to and i know
[1:45:53] throughout this congregation there's
[1:45:55] things lord that in every life maybe a
[1:45:58] person could say lord
[1:46:00] i don't want
[1:46:01] i don't want to be loose with things
[1:46:03] lord i don't want to be loose with my
[1:46:04] time
[1:46:07] and lord you're interested in that
[1:46:11] these things require a sincerity in our
[1:46:13] life and really getting sincere before
[1:46:15] you and lord some of these things as we
[1:46:18] look and we ask you for right now
[1:46:21] it doesn't lord all of a sudden
[1:46:24] bud and blossom and come forth almonds
[1:46:26] right here in this moment but help us
[1:46:28] lord
[1:46:30] to have such patience because it's
[1:46:32] impatience we possess our souls
[1:46:35] to be patient lord and patient meaning
[1:46:38] standing steadfast in the word of god
[1:46:40] that's been spoken to us lord and asking
[1:46:43] for that word to come to pass in our
[1:46:45] life oh god sometimes when we're asking
[1:46:47] for the word to come to pass in our life
[1:46:49] lord it's through those times when we
[1:46:51] really get before you that we recognize
[1:46:54] lord that there's more of us that needs
[1:46:55] to be emptied out lord that more of you
[1:46:58] might come into place oh thank god for
[1:47:01] the goodness and the grace and mercy of
[1:47:03] almighty god that leads us to these
[1:47:05] wonderful precious places lord
[1:47:09] in prayer
[1:47:10] that we can lord
[1:47:13] experience that release
[1:47:17] and growth

[1:47:20] takes place in our life
