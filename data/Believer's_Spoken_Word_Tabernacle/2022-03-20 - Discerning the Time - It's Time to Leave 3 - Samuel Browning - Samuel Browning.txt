that you desire into consecration into surrender into deliverance oh god into uniting oh lord jesus just lead us we pray father in jesus precious name amen amen if you just turn with me in the bible to psalms 86 god bless you sir i certainly appreciate song service musicians and just hearing hearing your worship back there as well and just really really enjoy that so much i want to remind you also that the meetings that we had planned with uh brother berry those are just going to be those are postponed i know we made the announcement on thursday an email has went out concerning it the facebook post etc and so we'll just keep you up to date on when we can reschedule that and get that in we want to just continue to remember the brothers and sisters there um in ukraine and uh for the berry i've got some different videos just snippets of things um pictures where they've met with them in poland but he's putting together an entire video and i believe it'll be on their website so we'll get that information to you and so if i forget that sister roseanne you have to remind me my wife i know that i can send that out because when i say something and sometimes i just get off and i forget about it but also sister linda cavillo we want to also continue to remember her in prayer you know she's experienced different setbacks but as we were there the other day and just praying with her and i just just began to just speak just speak to her once again on the atonement and then just just taking that part on jonah and jonah was in the belly of the well all of the surroundings he had he called them lying vanities that's that's how i said every one of these situations i said the doctors say this is normal and this is you know these things can happen i said but all of this is lying vanities and we're not going to look we're not going to look there and i said we don't have to look over to jerusalem because that that temple of the living god he's right here among us right here in this room right now the angel of the lord is right here and so we just want you just if you just even throughout the day and at times when she comes to your heart i know you have been you've been holding up in prayer and i just told her i said the church is just praying for you i said we're standing with you and and you know she's standing there real strong you know sometimes when there's setbacks and things like that you you watch you're looking and the things i was praying for is god don't let her get weak in her spirit like strengthen her lord give her resolve and courage is to keep pressing on there and so she has that resolve and we just want to keep praying amen and holding it before the lord in prayer amen let's look here in the word in psalms and i want to just read these scriptures here verse 1 if we we could a little bit of a lengthy reading but verse 1 david a prayer of david bow down thine ear oh lord hear me for i am poor and needy preserve my soul for i am holy oh thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee now if you notice david is not purporting his own holiness but he recognizes his holiness comes from god in whom i'm trusting be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul for thou lord are good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou willed answer among the gods there is none liken unto thee o lord neither are there any works like unto thy words all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god alone teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth and unite my heart to fear thy name amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i want to go and read just another passage of scripture here in matthew chapter 16. the bible says in verse 1 here that the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven he answered and said unto them when it is even you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red in the morning it will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh you hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given unto it the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed now when we recognize that in this time i want to continue the thought on discerning the time and it's time to leave and when we consider this of where we're at in this in this moment the spirit of this age is a spirit of uniting you know you find that that within nature itself there is always a uniting together before there's a flight like when the geese are getting together before they head down to the the rice paddies in louisiana there's always a gathering going on you find it in the fall you'll find the birds and when they come together uh in great flocks and here they are you'll hear them chirp and you'll just see them it's just many many amounts of them that are they are all together and there's a uniting that's going on in preparation for that flight and god in his infinite wisdom and mercy that even within nature because to realize that nature itself it testifies of god and how that god would so place that there to where one of them of the geese and among the robins and so forth the ducks and one of them is a leader and you know with that leader it's something that you don't have to tell the rest of the geese you don't have to tell the rest of the ducks it's just it's just something that is that is given science calls an instinct but like how brother banh said it he said i call it god because it's it's not something that is explained but it's just it just drops it's simple they they don't care if his feathers is is not as good as the rest of the feathers but what it is they can catch that that this drake in terms of the geese that this is the one that that we're to follow and and we need and we need to follow and to be led by this so anytime there's a migration you recognize that there is something that begins to move together these animals together in preparation for that migrating so before it ever takes place there's a uniting and then through that uniting then that migration takes place so it's not anybody just finding their own way but god has provided leadership by his grace brother brown would say it like this he's talking about a uniting taking place and he says they are coming to the battle of armageddon and that's exactly what they'll do they're uniting for that right now that's why we got the u.n and everything we have the western world's uniting against the eastern world communism and so forth it's all uniting together the churches are uniting together everything seems to be uniting it's uniting themselves together and all and all the while this uniting of nations and signs that we see was prophesied in the scripture earthquakes in diverse places and bringing the world together bringing the people together churches are being brought together but while all of that uniting is taking place and remember within that uniting there is a focus and there is a power that is moving to bring people together in a like-mindedness but while that is going on among politics among religion among world systems among nations there is another uniting that's taking place and that uniting is what even we want to look at even even to fellowship around here this morning and because there's there's two powers at work within the earth you have that of satan and we have that of god it's two spirits that that's at work and you think of it that how the holy spirit is calling a bride out of the church into divine fellowship under the blood of jesus christ and and now the satan is also we can say it the unholy spirit he is gathering people together by education theology by science he's uniting them together so there are two achievements that are coming forth in this hour the bride of jesus christ is the achievement of the holy ghost in this hour where the word of god has been sown for a revival now remember the bible is very clear to tell us that there is a mora a former rain and there is a laddering the latter is a maturing rain a ripening rain a harvest rain but in order for that harvest rain to come there must first be a former amora or a sowing rain so there must be seeds that have been sown so right now we are living in the time of revival we are living in a time to where as brother madam would put it that communism even in this nation the seeds he said have been sown before and how that even the seeds for romanism seeds for catholicism the seeds for the world council of churches all of these seeds have been sown seeds of denominational working and now there is also been a seed that has been sown in this hour for the bride of jesus christ to come forth now what seed is that that has been sown it's a seed wherein that the entire word of the bible has been planted all the way from genesis to revelations and remember by the word himself coming down and speaking that word and announcing and unfolding to us that this is the time this is the season it's a time of harvest time remember that when we look at the time of harvest harvest time is a time where wheat and tares have grown together but now in the time of harvest it's where the wheat and the tares begin to actually reflect what was always in the roots so it's a time of separation it's also a time of gathering we're living in a time of advancement and achievement look at how science how science itself the parallel between science and between god within this hour where science would have the horse and buggy and that would be typified by the message of justification in this hour there would also then be that of of the automobile which would be typed as that of wesley's message of sanctification through the blood then we find the airplane another mode notice what every one of these are are modes of transportation they are means to take you from one place to another and every one of them even with the airplane now that got off the ground it is that in itself was a type of pentecost where the supernatural begins to come back among the church of the living god but here in this hour according to his word that god would visit the church and just as they would put a man in space an astronaut god himself and brings down the astronaut that has already been there on the throne of god the whole time the same lord jesus in the form of his word comes down as the entire holy spirit and visits the church of the living god because we are not to be confined by the atmosphere and the realms of this earth but we are to be caught away in a moment and a twinkling of an eye we are to move into that astronaut jesus christ by the blood of jesus christ now it's a uniting that's going on brother branham would go on to say god is uniting his pride she's coming together from the east and the west and the north and the south there's a uniting time that's going on right now i think it's absolutely and just marvelous i'm always amazed at it it's it's not something that uh you know that that that new to us but it's i'm always amazed you know you watch how god will come right around and whether it's someone could step right in here and you'll find a continuity that is taking place right around the bride of jesus christ around the world a few weeks ago just as i walked out of the pulpit here i have a text from the brother daniel o'forey and just as we had just finished ministry he said my goodness he said the same points those very same things is what i just finished ministering this morning as i stood there last week you know ministering there with brother jonathan martin there and bible believers and just you know feeling pressed to the lord and i took you know a collection of messages here that i ministered and just to take points out of that and it was just messages that i just had preached on a sunday and just feeling to come back into that and brother jonathan told me he said everything he said when you begin to minister he said it was an amen coming to everything that had already been spoken here the past three weeks you know you say brothers tell me what are you trying to say i'm saying that the same holy spirit the way that he worked with paul and peter who had never met one another when they came together they were preaching the same thing because they were in contact with the same holy spirit i tell you it's god declaring the book of acts is not a group of people that are under the control of man they do not need programs sent to their mailbox it is not man trying to bring a uniting and man saying preach on this and preach on this there is the presence of the living god right here among us that's directing us according to the needs of his children i'm telling you the bible says the eyes of the lord roam through and fall throughout the earth and god shows himself strong on the behalf of his children you see there's a uniting that's going on and coming together from north west south and so forth he says she's uniting for the rapture it's god's getting her ready what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody says she's uniting herself she's getting ready she is the bride she's uniting herself with her bridegroom and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and that uniting is taking place just exactly according to john 14 where he said he that believeth on me the same works that i do shall you do also amen it's the same life being made manifest now notice where we're at because we're talking about the rapture we're talking about the rapture of the church of the living god to know that that is the promise in this hour that is upon us that is the promise that all have looked for and waited for they have longed for this time to come now notice what takes place here because in this uniting for rapture notice the saints themselves are the very ones who are dead in christ they rise first and when they rise then we unite with them and as we unite with them you see when they rise we unite with them because when the bride gets there to him remember he will not set his foot upon this earth the bible said we meet him in the air is that right so the dead in christ shall rise first not all the dead the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment and a twinkling in an eye brother brahman says the ones that's living that's uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that and it all comes together and makes one great union of the uniting going on affair now when we think about uniting with the word you know you cannot unite with the bible come on you cannot unite with the bible we can carry it around but you cannot unite with the bible but you can unite with the word i'm talking about the person of jesus christ and when that uniting takes place then that word on the inside begins to identify itself it identifies the experience in our life in the word you see because any experience that has to go outside of the word is not a true barrenly born again experience but a real experience from god is the spirit of truth baptizing us into the body of jesus christ and he said the spirit of truth will lead and guide us into all truth what does the spirit of truth produce it produces a life of truth whereby that it reflects this word in action now when we look at this this uniting it's a real culmination in this hour that we're living in iran would tell us communism has to rise all these things has to rise the church has to unite itself nations out there in the world council of churches and the bride has to unite itself under the word of god now this is very key here let me just drop this and the bride has to unite herself under the word of god in order to do that god has sent down the heavenly sign and things to prove to the church as he has to the nation now in second timothy chapter 4 verse 7 pardon me just a minute paul says it like this i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness and the crown is not something that goes on your head but that is a new body that is the body that peter said you have a body reserved in the heavens right it is that of the celestial is that right so here at the crown of righteousness see that that's a crowning notice which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing so the very thing of his appearing it is of his own presence his life even now think about it down through the ages the holy spirit has been appearing in his word and manifesting that word to each of the seven gentile ages is that right we find that time to where uh the space of time to where god would let daniel know all of those junctions and points of time but within that was a mystery that paul would write about the mystery of god the hidden mystery that was not revealed to them and that hidden mystery was where that christ himself would take a bride it was a bride that was given before the foundation of the world just like it was with we understand this with joseph when joseph was in exile or he was rejected he he took a gentile bride is that right so here we find that in this and it is time jesus remember he had said upon this rock i will build my church so the appearing of what we're we're looking at even right now we are witnessing the appearing of the lord you see the appearing and coming brother man will differentiate and put the difference within those words he appearing right now is a sign of his coming he's appearing in his church in the form of the holy spirit showing that it's him because man cannot do these things it's the holy spirit that's doing it so it takes the peering the appearing recognizing the appearing recognizing that grace and may being made ready for the coming of the lord you see all of those that have they have fallen asleep and they are resting there and they are awaiting that promise of the rapture they they have been looking for this moment they lived according to the word that god gave them in that day it was it was something that so gripped their hearts and their life they lived by the appearing of god and they came into the fellowship with jesus christ by the holy ghost now notice within this preparation of the hour there's many many many types within this because the scriptures themselves holding there of the types and everything as we said before the bible itself was written for this day it was written from this moment because this bible it is not stories it's not of just it's not a collection of past events it is prophecy this is a book of prophecy in many times when you find that the prophets themselves they would speak there would be a prophesying that would go out but then you find in many other lives that though they didn't say anything out here but their lives was a prophecy of what would come to pass in the lives of others just like in this hour with rebecca rebecca's life she did never prophesied but her life prophesied that there would be a bride come in the evening time that would be stirred to go to the waters of life oh my so all of these things that that lay in here they speak even of this hour so there's a preparation for this hour in the bible in in hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 the bible says this is very important without faith it is impossible to please god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith now to think how that god god here he announces judgment is coming upon the earth but notice within the midst of that the judgment is coming god has seen the very heart of man the wickedness and seeing all the violence seen everything that's going on and and notice but before judgment can come god gives a message of mercy now the message itself when many of them would hear noah preaching the message that there is rain coming and there's going to be a deluge that's going to come that you're not going to be able to escape it now when you consider what it says in the scriptures regarding that time of noah the bible calls those waters prevailing waters is that right you tie that into the book of revelations and it speaks of the great that sets upon the waters which is a multitude of people so hear these spirits working in the earth and notice with them waters it was already spoken the waters were going to rise so that if a person could go to the highest point on earth the waters would cover even the highest point you say what are you saying it doesn't matter you could be of the highest highest moral person but that does not lead way to escape the prevailing waters of judgment good morality is wonderful but there's only one place of safety and that's in the blood of jesus christ because those waters are prevailing waters come on friends we're living in a time where people have withstood certain things and now they go along with it where we have homosexuality in the churches and everything else one time where things were stood against but what is it it's prevailing waters that are present and are trying to encroach your waters are joining together think about what it did in the days of noah there was that of a joining together but in the midst of that time what i want to focus on is god made a preparation because before god does anything he gives ample time he gives a lot of warning a lot of warning before judgment god sent a voice and he warned the people to flee from the wrath that was to come the bible identifies noah was a preacher of righteousness and think about it how he stood there in the door of the ark and he spoke that message you see we're living brother brown would say it like this we're living in the hour of preparation we're living when you're preparing the people to believe all things so god himself is the one who is present preparing his children to believe all things not just some of the promises but to believe all things that's an achievement of god that produces itself in the life of the believer and he says we believe that the message of the day the preparation time is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever so what is that preparation that preparation is the baptism of the holy ghost it's god made provision within this hour that there would be a preparation made for the children of god to be able to escape that which is coming upon the earth now when you you consider this here and you look at it his coming the bible identifies that his coming will be as a thief it tells us to watch and be ready and yet this is the mystery it's a secret work because a thief doesn't announce when he's coming right he doesn't announce hey i'm going to show up at this particular day and this particular time that's not a thief that's a robber but a thief comes in a manner of unexpectedness right now that that announcement that he said i'll come as a thief in the night he was not saying that it would be unexpected to the believer this is why paul could write and he would say you are not children of the night you are children of the day he would write that you would not be ignorant of these things that are coming upon you see god has made a way through and by that preparation of the holy spirit it's a secret work yet it is open before all it's a secret work but yet it's open before all you see when you consider it his coming as we look at that it comes as a thief a thief in the night it speaks that there would be of an unawareness and an unpreparedness a time that would that would catch people by surprise but you see god knows that even within our lives you and i could not be found ready and for that moment if god himself in his grace did not did uh give to you and i a sign in this hour and begin to deal with our lives to bring us into that place of expectation you and i would not be ready we would be like the rest you say what are you saying because to recognize as we begin to look into these things the world itself even the church world different ones they can talk about the rapture but they fail to recognize remember the migration that there has to be a uniting with the word first before there ever is a uniting with the dead in christ and then there is a going to meet him in the air so all of these are necessary successions here or folds or things that must take place it's a secret work yet it's open before all now let me just let me refer back to that scripture that we were reading when we look at look at psalms 86 verse 11 david said teach me thy way o lord and i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name now to think this is david you know as he's praying and and he's asking god the grace of god teach me and that which is taught lord that i will walk in your truth and unite my heart to fear thy name there must this is the uniting that must take place and must go on is that the heart itself must be united to god it's not enough just to know his word is that right the bible said the devil believes and he trembles that's not enough but it's to know him is life is that right and when you know him that's life it doesn't mean you can explain everything in here but when you know him who is life then there is a faith that comes into your life to be able to stand upon his word and to recognize his voice and say i don't know how but i believe it and i know i'm a part of it and you're able to stand there now listen we're not drifting from noah noah had faith there was a faith that had raised within noah's life by faith noah himself had received a message from god now that same that same faith that moved within noah and noah's heart is the same faith that would move within the hearts of all that would be a part of that working that was taking place and would enter into the ark now when they think of this in this time because we're talking about the preparation that god has made the uniting taking place before that of the change of the body first thessalonians 4 16 says for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god so we recognize that all three of these it all all three take place while he's descending but all three of them they are they are three distinct happenings three distinct folds that are taking place and the shout notice it's the lord himself this is not this is not a a man's message this is the lord himself descending with a shout and that is the message that is calling to get the people together to get them ready amen for that great event of the rapture the matter of fact that's even what's taking place right now the rapture is not something we're looking for the rapture is something that you become a part of by the holy ghost because the rapture is a catching away i tell you if you're not called away from the world right now if you're not caught away from worldly habits right now if you're not cut away from the world you're not part of the catching away that's going to take place there but there's a provision there is a power that is present the lord himself to catch us away in rapturing grace right now that makes us ready for that moment oh glory be to god i'm grateful for that there is rapturing grace right now for those that are sick in their body to catch us away from sickness there is grace to catch away from depression come on church there's grace here to catch away from anxiety there's grace here that moves to catch us away you say why how can you say that because the lord the lord himself is present right here among his children according to his word it's not the corporal body but it is the entire holy spirit that is right here in the church of the living god he's anointing our faith with divine inspiration that is being poured out in this hour oh brother oh my what a time to move in this hour what a time to move in this hour a time to move on in to the word of god as the word is right here before us you see uh when we look at and you consider even this preparation that's taking place you think about the ministry of brother branham they're a malachi 4. so forth remember signs and wonders that took place unparalleled are you hearing me signs and wonder it was a promise behold i send unto you elijah before that great and dreadful day of the lord right we know there's two parts within that there was a john the baptist part and then here a last day why there must be a calling back to the original sacrifice calling it away from churchism traditions of man and calling it back to the original altar of god where the altar of god has been forsaken but there is come a repair to the altar of almighty god the truth that was scattered has been assembled in this hour and the power of god has come down among the church of the living god in this hour it's god vindicating his presence it's god coming down vindicating his word it's god coming down and expressing his love that every promise he made that you and i are partakers of that promise i tell you right now if you're sluggish at all i'd shake myself this morning i'm not talking about tiredness in your mind i'm talking about if there's anything that's holding you back from the every promise of almighty god i would shake myself this morning and i would accept that anointing of the holy ghost to move down and let that word be made alive and real in my life the lord himself who is this among us the lord himself is that right many scriptures we could go into that tile that together revelations 10 1 and on and on we can go but notice this as it speaks in revelations 19 7 because with all the signs and wonders that are done if there's not a message that comes behind that then it's not of god because the signs and wonders are to get us to stand still and hear the message many of them followed jesus for the loaves and bread and they were filled naturally but when you begin to speak except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood they couldn't stand it the bible said they said this is a hard saying john chapter 6 verse 66 this is a hard staying saying who can understand this and many of his disciples are you hearing me they were disciples up to that point they could say we are following the message we are following that of the lord jesus the messiah but you see the word continues to open what was the word doing the word is declaring its authority who it is that's present and when the word declares its authority it will reveal those that are following are they really part of that or not are you hearing me we're not talking about just quoting the message we're not talking about just quoting the doctrines we're talking about coming under the life and the headship of the word talking about a preparation here all right there's a preparation going on let me tell you something this preparation that noah received let me tell you there was many boats that was being built in that hour many boats that was being built there was many men that were good shipbuilders are you hearing me now but notice noah's build was not built where it was close to water but god had him build it on dry land why because noah's message was not something that had to work things up but it was a message that when he stayed with that word the water would come to that ship it would lift it up i tell you that's why the preaching of the word when will stay with the word the same holy ghost who is the word and david he'll come to that word he'll come and lift that word up that's the same way in your life he comes to lift up his word he kind of looked at knowing so what in the world are you doing building a boat clear out here but the difference with noah's built it was god constructed they could have sat there and debated with noah all day didn't matter noah kept on working he knew what god had called him to do is that right oh my you know there's probably no doubt there were people in that day that wanted to try to tell noah you turned the corner here wrong or you done this wrong but noah said i know where my instructions come from sometimes noah could say there's things that are said that i myself don't even understand but i'm following the revelation and the unction of the holy spirit oh my what was happening it was a place of safety that was there in the unseen but now becoming visible and tangible oh god help us think about this in revelations chapter 19 the bible says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready that could not have happened in any other age it couldn't have happened but in this age the announcement the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready so in order to make herself ready all the other types that are given in the scripture like esther there has to be a provision that is made that she will actually declare that she is part of the bride by submitting to the word that's given in that hour as the word will deal with her life just like it dealt with esther's life and she will become adorned with that same glory to go in before the king oh my you see she's retaking and she is receiving what has already been given to her now i want you to catch this very closely because sometimes i i'm just gonna just kind of drop back into a different gear sometimes we this is where we really need to evaluate in our own lives that we're not just coming to hear a sermon i didn't come here to preach a sermon i'm not looking for things to put together i'm not looking for things to put together i i want to move by that inspiration that god has given within this hour that's what we want to do god knows the needs of what we have need of in this hour but but sometimes i wonder if what we do is we hear it but then we don't even act upon the word you see nothing can come if you never act on it you must first believe it i can't preach on this today but in order for a miracle to take place you first must believe the word and then you must act on the word and then the miracle will follow it you can sit here and believe it but if you don't act on it there's no miracle going to come look at the woman the little woman widow of zerepath remember the word spoke to her it said bake me a cake first she had to believe the word she had to act on the word and when she believed it and act on it then the miracle came and the mill bell never ran empty the cruce of all it never ran dry why there was a miracle follows believing and acting on the word of god and noah was believing the word he was acting on the word of god what was noah doing he was preparing for a miracle to take place oh glory be to god in the highest notice in verse 8 of revelations 19 i'm trying to hurry and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine line and clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints you see what sea is adorned in it speaks of how the bridegroom himself looks and looks upon her because remember that fine linen of the righteousness of the saints is a reflection of the same adornment that he wore the word made flesh and that same adornment there is in her life what is that of the fine linen it's the son of man in flesh once again it's the same power the same glory the same living god and to her was granted that she should be adorned in the fine linen which is the righteousness of the saints oh my we are not failing a creed we're not failing a tradition we are veiling the living god in our lives oh don't look at these badger skins but look at the glory that is behind the badger skin on the inside oh my it was the same glory that was originally spoken there by moses but once that revelation went forth out of moses it went to its destination which is there behind the veil where has this word made its way it makes its way into our soul it's not there under our arm it's not a picture on the wall that word is to become flesh this message was an announcement the bride is coming and the announcement is she is now here and he said to me this is what he said blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb now the marriage supper of the lamb but you see in order to get to the marriage supper you got to have the wedding garment in order to have the wedding garments you got to have an invitation and in order to have an invitation you had to have your name on the guestbook are you hearing me now i mean if you show up to a wedding they say i wasn't expecting you you know right away you you ask them that they need help in the kitchen you might be able to be there they might say we'll see if they've got any leftovers but you see in order there's an invitation that must be given remember the gentleman who shows up the man who shows up in the parable and he shows up and here the lord of the wedding there goes forth and said hey he noticed him without a wedding garment all said how did you get in here friend he knew him friend as a church member he knew him he was acquainted with him but how did you get in here he didn't have on the wedding garment because the wedding garment is what neutralizes all the differences what is the wedding garment it's that fine linen what is that fine linen in that wedding garment it's the baptism of the holy ghost brother it neutralizes all these things all the differences that you and i could have the differences in our makeups and everything else but the baptism of the holy ghost moving down in the word it brings a oneness a gathering a unity with one mind one purpose one heart but we're called into the marriage supper of the lamb now remember the shout that we read that's the message going forth the living bread together the people together unto him not gone into a church but gathering the people unto him the word in a uniting that's what we're reading about then comes the voice of the archangel that voice of resurrection that moves down to call forth the dead in christ just like it stood there that day and called lazarus forth in that hour and then that in itself leads to the trump of god remember what a trump is it is an assembling together so every one of these junctions is an assembling or a uniting and that trump of god is an assembling to meet him in the air to go to the wedding supper so while the tribulation is taking place upon the earth for three and a half years and israel receives her visitation the bride is caught away in the palace in a wedding supper with him then he slips away and he makes himself known to that of the jews is that right he reveals himself then he slips from there comes back up and there is an assembling there in revelations 19 whereby that the faithful and chosen ride with him and come down here to the earth for the battle of armageddon oh my i wish i had some time to preach here this morning oh my what a privileged friends that we are called to in this hour but don't don't don't let that privilege and opportunity pass you by take full advantage of this moment it's god's grace that's given to you and i you might say well that seems awful hard you're dealing with this and dealing with that but that's god's grace it's grace that is present to correct us when we're wrong it's grace that comes that you and i can be led into a place of real fellowship with him notice these are the true sayings of god united so here are these true sayings of god this is how the the the bride of christ is united with him by the holy spirit she's receiving she's coming under that word she's coming under that word you know how when god begins to deal with the life and god will speak through that life and he'll convict you of your sin and let you know you're a sinner there has to be a coming under that promise that i am a sinner and i need a savior and as you keep walking with the word then the word will point out that you need a complete deliverance you need a sanctifying and the blood is present to cleanse you what has to happen you must come under that what's happening you in your life we are being reduced to fully come under the word then the word will speak to you and i and he will deal with us and say with the right thinking and just agreeing that's not enough but there's got to come a reproducing of that life to where it is christ on the inside reflecting his life what is it now there must be a coming under that word so it is a uniting with that word because no man just runs out on the street and grabs a woman that says you're going to be my bride if he does you'll be reading about him in the paper of course he'll be with all the rest of them in the paper anyhow and i'm not making a lot of that but you understand what i'm saying there is a progression right so this is why that that that that to the bride of jesus christ this rap this revelation of the rapture it is revealed to her by the grace of almighty god this is not what men have sent around and drummed up but this is god in his grace you and i would not even know nowhere to go in the word of god in this hour listen brother madam sent right there and told us in the message the rapture he said the holy spirit comes in we wouldn't even know where to look at in the word he said but the holy ghost gets a hold of the promises and he begins to lay out the picture of the hour and identify where we're at it is an operation of the holy ghost oh my so faith notice what faith itself it is that which is revealed because faith is a revelation it's something that's been revealed to you like like with abraham where it was revealed to him and when it was revealed abraham called anything contrary as though it was not when it was made known it didn't matter what it was are you hearing me now it doesn't matter where you're sitting at i don't care what even is in front of you i don't care what it is that you might see in your life i don't care how big the devil wants to make that mountain that mountain shall become a plane there's nothing that can stand in the presence of almighty god you let the pulsation of the holy ghost begin to pulsate in your heart that i am the lord i am the lord i am your redeemer i am your deliverer i am your healer i am your all in all you let him begin to pulsate in your life like that you'll watch that mountain it will fall in the presence of the lord god almighty it doesn't matter what it is in your life if it's a less devil it shall become a plane it doesn't matter what that is that's there before you there is a god that's here to take that mountain down what do i do speak to that mountain speak to that mountain hallelujah be plucked up and removed to yonder sea we're not worked up we know exactly where we're at hallelujah well i don't know if i'm worthy or not it's not about whether you feel worthy or not he has made you worthy and what he's asked for you to do do it hallelujah you want water in the vessels go fill them up you want wine go fill them up don't question it just do what he said do the bible's true you repent of your sins and you're baptized in the name of jesus christ you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost don't let the devil confuse your mind you stand right there on that promise because there's no confusion it isn't that god made a promise that he can't keep but the enemy's one to tell you a lie and tell you that it's not for you he's trying to hold things up in your mind and imagine oh i'm preaching now he's trying to hold imaginary thoughts in your mind and things before you but there is a presence of a living god right now you are under his wings you have authority to cast it down right now and pour your heart out and receive ye the holy ghost this revelation it has prevailing power in it you remember what we read in the opening chapter there psalms 86 david didn't say i'm mighty and strong he said i'm poor and needy in other words god you're my strength david already said the lord's a strength of my life no secret about it is that right so was his own strength saul did what saul wanted to do when saul wanted to do it saul had a real religion of convenience every anytime this is convenient okay or something comes up oh my goodness where's samuel uh something comes up here oh my goodness where's the pastor at oh my goodness where's the what about jesus what about jesus i i don't mean to i don't mean to hurt nobody's feeling but i'm not your holy ghost i ain't your holy ghost this ain't nicholas i can be victorious as long as i got brother samuel by my side you are victorious by the blood of the lamb you are victorious by the indwelling power of the holy ghost you've got the strength of almighty god within you that you can say i can do all things through christ that strengthens me that's right we might get weak once in a while and we might join our faith one to another you might say brother samuel i'm a little weak right now could we join our faith together and that faith be appropriated there absolutely we'll stand on that but let me tell you what we are doing together we are taking your mountain we are taking what belongs to you and god gives grace for that moment oh my it is a revelation to the bride of jesus christ a prevailing power of even when thoughts of doubt could swirl around your mind it's a prevailing power it'll direct you right into the word of god there's a prevailing power when the enemy says you're not gonna make it but there's a prevailing power that raises up on the inside i've already made it because christ jesus made it for me and i am accepted in the beloved i am united with my bridegroom oh my we're talking about access here this morning it's a prevailing power that when sickness or whatever it is that would try to come your way let me tell you friends we don't i'm not making light of one sickness i'm gonna make a lot of depression i don't make a lot of anxiety i don't make a lot of none of those things when the spirit of god is calling those things out he's not making light of it but i think in this hour that we need to take down what satan is trying to exalt and show this is powerful and i've got people under this i think we ought to hold up the banner of the old rugged cross i think we've got a message in this hour where the cross has come into view we've got a message with power to defeat amalek we've got a message that's able to drive back every darkness of devil and every demon out of hell we've got a message of divine glory and power don't take back on nothing we lift up the hands we hold up the hands what are you saying we're holding up this revealed word of the lord jesus christ because this message that god has sent is the message of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah it's not what you can explain it's what you can believe they couldn't explain what jesus was saying i'm quoting out of the message rapture i think it's very fitting they couldn't explain it but they believed it many of them walked away they made a decision at that moment i can't walk with this no more because what this guy's saying there's things i'm finding in the bible that's contrary come friends y'all understand when jesus said except you know i've quoted this to you when he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you they could have taken scripture in leviticus 16 and said what about this but you see to discern the times is to discern who it is that's speaking to you because god himself is the interpreter of his own word he interprets it by bringing it to past and where they could have reason within it but you see even though the elected couldn't explain it they believed it what showed in their life the actions that came out of their life it showed that they really believed what was made known to them well i'll tell you just like this when we look at i've got to skip a few things you see there's that place of safety that god has made known to us in this hour and that's that place of safety that's under the blood of jesus christ you see the bible in this hour when we we talk about coming under the headship and the authority of the word just to think about it in this way if there were those in that day that could have said well i don't want to be in judgment i don't want to be under judgment but i don't want to get on noah's boat if you were going to be saved from judgment you had to walk past noah come on somebody it wasn't noah that saved them it was god saved them they wouldn't have known the judgment was coming but god found one man upon the earth that wasn't overtaken with the things of the world and god revealed himself to that man and there was a message of grace that came forth is that right now think about this here you see we're living in a time can i have a little bit more time well you know hey listen y'all don't mind waiting 45 minutes to get in a restaurant come on now you don't mind well hey it's no problem at all we'll just sit around but let's just let's just have a little time right now just give me just a few more moments isaiah chapter 4 verse 1 in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away thy approach see women are churches seven women there have been seven gentile ages and seven women will take hold upon one man who is that one man the lord jesus but notice they're telling him what they're gonna do we're going to wear our own apparel we're going to eat our own bread in other words believe our own what we want to believe and but when this was one thing we want to be called by your name to take away our reproach they realize if they're called by his name then then the reproach would be lifted but in order to be called by his name his name is his life made manifest and when his life is made manifest his life is the garment is the wedding garment is that right you see it's a clothing that comes upon that of the soul to be enshrouded with the blood of jesus christ we'll eat our own bread we'll believe what we want to believe but only let us be called by thy name that's impossible but it shows you in an hour in a time think about it where we're living in this hour and we're living in the time of ladies which is people's rights and the emboldenness to be able to even stand right in the face of the word and say this is what we want we'll take this this this and this but you give us your name but god don't operate that way god don't operate that way god does not come down to where we're at we must come to where he's at oh my you see they they want everything but they reject what brings a great certainty of the gospel of jesus christ they reject life but notice verse two i always like going to the let's go to this this next part this is where i'm identified verse two in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel now remember this is speaking not only of israel when israel receives that in the 144 000 but remember this also speaks of the bride of jesus christ in this hour jesus said you are the vine or i'm the vine you are the branches is that right remember when israel went astray in the book of psalms he would speak i will rise up my servant the branch and through that branch life would be restored and to think in this hour how that christ himself would move down through his word to call out a people for his name's sake and that his life would so be preeminent in the lives of the people that they would be identified as the branch of the lord the same characteristics of the lord jesus may manifest in a bride body oh my you see we're living in the time of the fulfillment of god's word of that branch that channel that god had prepared for himself in this hour oh my think of that we're living in the time as the prophet would go on to say where the entire holy spirit visits the church of the living god making god in human flesh when we're in a time where the word has been gathered up and the truth has been laid out before you and i vindicated the path of righteousness that has been laid out then god vindicating his word to bring such a certainty within the body of jesus christ you see there's a gathering that's going on it's a gathering that was promised in genesis 49 10 the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a law-giver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be in ephesians 1 10 in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ so this is the hour of preparation this is the hour of calling into the body of jesus christ by one spirit we are baptized into one body now look at this here just in closing when you take the scriptures in this hour that appoint to this time of the lord himself the bible gives it gives as we were looking at some weeks ago some background conditions that were taking place it says as it was in the days of noah talks about the conditions that was going on then it says as and also as it was in the days of lot you see those two it would be a compounding of things that would take place the most vilest of times but remember when we look at that time of lot because i want you to think of this redemption is two parts it's a coming out of and a going into see to come out is only halfway but you must go fully in two there's two parts to redemption israel came out they were brought out of egypt but they had to go into the promised land is that right we to come out of the world but we're to go into christ right this is why when the bible would say in revelations 18 of that that angel that comes down that lightened the earth with great power and glory that ministry of the third angel there in revelation is the ministry of this hour the ministry of the son of man that identifies that babylon is fallen come out of her my people and be not a partaker it goes on and on i don't have time to read that but there is a coming out of and are going into you see let me just say it in this way there's many that have come out of organizations but they've never went fully into christ there's many that's come out and learned the message but they never went in and did what the message said do the message is not doctrines the message is not teachings the message is christ then the message is get into christ what did the early church what did they call for they were introducing the people to introduce them to jesus christ to get into christ now remember paul went up there in the book of acts acts chapter 19 and he got around some believers listen they were believers are you hearing me but you see because there was a longing a call a hunger a desire for more truth god seen that knew right where they were at and god sent that so they could walk in more truth they could have said we've got the scrolls we've got all of this but you see god himself sends his servants with a message and that message just like with philip and the and the eunuch the ethiopian eunuch he read the writings of isaiah but he couldn't understand them and notice philip said do you understand what you're reading he said how can i except some man teach me it was not philip that it delivered understanding but philip was filled with the seed of life of the holy ghost the one who spoke through isaiah and philip was able to stand there under inspiration and that man who pondered who wondered remember he was a eunuch and here he came under the word of god look at him he said look i don't need to wait to get baptized there's some water right here what's stopping us see when the word was revealed he discerned the time what it meant for him it's not and it's not enough just to discern god sent a prophet why did he send a prophet why did god make this word no why did he shake that promise before this generation god was not taking up time god is not taking up time this morning god is announcing his presence and his desire that you and i would be fully united with him hallelujah that's god's desire the gathering shall be unto him and paul went up there paul began to hear him he heard and heard what they were talking about and paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed notice because you don't get the holy ghost when you believe since you believed paul said over ephesians 1 ephesians 4 in whom after you believe ye also trusted and were sealed with the holy spirit of promise after that you believe because remember the coming of the holy ghost is a miracle the baptism of the holy ghost a new birth is a miracle is that right that's what jesus look at it in john 3 it's a miracle so how can the holy ghost come he said the father will send the holy ghost in my name and the spirit of truth it reveals jesus christ it's the testimony of jesus christ and he speaks his word and what does it do it raises faith in the living word of god what is it the spirit of truth moving on your life to lead you into christ himself have you received the holy ghost since you have believed and what did they say we don't know whether there is a holy ghost but paul said how were you baptized paul knew there was limitations in the truth that they had not that the truth was limited but they were limited by the truth they had are you hearing me that's why the word itself there has to be an opening and an unfolding of the word of god in this hour and he begins to speak to them and let them know that not only was jesus here the true passover lamb the lamb that was offered up but he was there to make an announcement he was offered up already he's rose from the grave he's ascended on high and he sent back the holy ghost and i've got it and it's for you brother they received the holy ghost and a sign showing it when paul said that they were to be baptized in the name of jesus christ they got up and they were baptized in the name of jesus christ that's a work of the holy ghost who is it it was god gathering his children unto himself [Applause] are coming out and are going into he called lot out is that right think of these two parts in the scripture he calls lot out of sodom there's a calling out calling out of sodom but there's also a place to go into calls out of sodom and into the safety of the ark it's a compound compound event a coming out of and are going into i want you to think of this when god spoke in genesis 7 verse 1 and the lord said to noah come thou and all thy house into the ark where i have seen the righteous before me in this generation there wasn't one drop of water could fall until they got in the ark they sat in that ark there and it was on the seventh day when the first drop started to come but the call didn't come from outside the call came from inside the ark see god speaks to you on the inside it's the holy spirit that comes by and says it says it like this it says the promise of the holy ghost is for you brother branham takes that it's that statement he says you go to start feeding on that promise he said you start feeding that white dog on that promise the holy ghost is for me he said you watch what takes place in your life are you hearing me so many times we come in we come to church and we hear and we leave and do nothing i mean we're getting quiet now we were shouting earlier that's all right but it's what we do with the word that we're hearing it's got to be something that strikes our heart now friends that's where it has to go to it's it true we have it's a green you open the channel of your mind and let the seed of the word coming down there must be an agreeing but it's got to be coming into our heart if there if all we're doing is agreeing with it it'll show there's no stability there's nothing that continues on within our life or in and out and up and down that's not what god's desire is for you god's desire is for a real victorious life now come on let's just put the devil on notice that squirmish little feeling or whatever more that that ain't god that ain't god that's doing that that's his presence and the enemy's getting nervous the enemy gets nervous in those times because he's being uncovered but it's a time to really to let our life really be united with almighty god that no we've come out of the world but it's got to be that where it come where there's a dying out in our life a real surrendering to our life not just something we say yes i believe it but something that we begin to act upon and begin to give our lives to it it's something that we want oh brother samuel if i could sit down and counsel with you you can counsel with me a month of sundays it'll never do it until you're ready to die come on friends you don't need brother samuel you need the holy ghost it isn't me you need well if i only had words from you it in brother samuel that can straighten out your life it's jesus christ that can do it it's jesus christ that can spring you out of the traps you're in this is why david said teach me teach me lord and i walk in it i unite my heart to fear thy name samuel what are you saying i'm saying friends listen god isn't god god doesn't want us to he's not calling us to be or we become like monks or something but god is calling us to our lives or on fire we're living for his coming we're ready for his coming i'm telling you right now if you would have to say when if the lord were to come this minute and you would have to say hold up i've let some things creep into my life that shouldn't be there then right now is a time to take care of that it's a time to attend to those things it's not a time to put it off and you know how people are saying well i'm waiting for california to fall in the bride won't be here sorry the bride won't be here i'm waiting on the first bomb the bride won't be here i'm waiting on this to happen the bride won't be here you must discern the time it's the presence of jesus christ right here among us discerning our hearts pouring out his life bringing conviction on lives i tell you i'll tell you how it concerns me because when the voice came in from the inside of the ark it called for noah to enter it was a work done in silence done in silence yet it was open before everybody and when noah got inside the ark no one never closed the door god closed it there's only so long of mercy while the bride is still here there's still mercy on there's still blood are you hearing me now there's still blood that's here that that door of mercy is set right before us jesus said i am the door are you hearing me you say well i know that jesus is the door remember there were two preachers that went down to sodom and they remember people couldn't even find the door come on now we've had a billy graham and oral roberts right oral roberts has carried a message to the pentecostals right brother graham called it a message of mercy billy graham carried a message right but remember it could not it could not reveal the door they staggered to find the door but you see abraham out here abraham wasn't even in sodom abraham was outside of sodom and outside of sodom he received the one that had spoke to him visited him in lights visited him in dreams visited him in visions he now received that visitation before his tent door and the door was revealed the way was opened you say what what are you saying preacher i'm saying or the way is open that door you you'd be like this i could say it like this if somebody if you you were blind let's say you were you were blind and you were you know somewhere else back there in the in in the building and here we have let's say we have the cross right up here because that that's what you're trying to get people to is back to the real reality of calvary is that right come on that's what this message reveals is the real reality of calvary and the resurrection power of jesus christ but imagine a person that was blind you and i hey we were blind the bible said that that would thou would have had thine eyes anointed with isaf brother joy let's say you were back there and i said brother joy make your way to the cross you could stumble all the way through here see i know the cross is up there somewhere you're stumbling but if i come back there and i get you by the hand and i say come with me we're going to the cross you've got a set of eyes that's able to lead you to reality come on now a prophet is a seer it's a set of eyes it lets light into the body so that we might find our way back home back to calvary that's what this message did it led us back to a real relationship with jesus christ we couldn't have found our way but god rich in mercy he came down in darkness he lighted the way and led us back home led us to a real experience led us to a place that we can be certain of god a place in christ hallelujah think about this think about it those animals come into the ark think about it monkey looked over at mama camel took camel notice they came paired male and female that speaks of the uniting in this hour they received a call to come in but the conditions of time people ate drank were so busy and they might have had legitimate excuses so i've got a family to raise i've got this i've got that they were so busy the bible says until they didn't even know it until the fight came listen friends there's witnesses here and i'm a witness to i am a personal witness of this you put god first in everything and everything god will see you through but if you put anything ahead of god it'll never come out right it's got to be god first you put his word first it's not about whether you feel like it or you put his word first if he said be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins repent and you shall receive the holy ghost don't let anything stand in your way put it first if there's things that's crept into your life this is god's grace to say you know what let's get it right back in order where it needs to be are you hearing me because we're living right here in the coming of the lord we're living right here in this time we're living in a time that at any moment and that should be the joy of the church of the living god at any moment at any moment i'm looking for my loved ones to appear at any moment i'm looking for brothers and sisters to appear at any moment i'm looking for him oh yes sir i'm looking for him there is a promise because just as they were united with the word in their day and i'm united with the word you're united with the word we've got a promise that they shall appear to us it's not going to be an appearing to everybody no it is an appearing to that of those who are ready to go and when we see them we know our change is on its way oh my we're living in this hour right now a gathering unto christ oh i i don't have enough strength to preach it hard enough you know when i say hard enough for the grace that's given in this hour there is no devil too big that god's not bigger there's no habit too great that god's not greater hallelujah we're not handling a partial gospel this is the full gospel of jesus christ the lord himself right here among us what do i have to do believe it and act upon it watch the miracle take place oh my i tell you i want to be ready i want to be ready anybody else making plans to go oh my i'm not packing up i'm unpacking that's one thing i hate about trips is packing my wife always gets on me she says you ain't packed yet when i get ready to go on the treatment you know i'll get that i said i'll get that later i said the only thing i'm i'm concerned about i'm going to make sure every one bag i want to make sure i got i want to make sure i got my bible in my briefcase if i got to wear jeans i'll wear jeans but i got to go buy clothes but that's the one thing i want to make sure of she said you ain't paying i hate packing now i know that ain't very spiritual i know that but i don't like packing i don't like carrying a lot of clothes i want carrying a lot i just want i do you know what it is you want you want to get ready to go but she knows you you got to get ready to go you got to fly through you got to leave at this time you need to make sure if there's iron there's shirts and ties on you you need to allow yourself plenty of time so you're not rushing around here and forgetting things well i usually do it you know about midnight the night before you know and sometimes when i think the best and i'll get it ready but this ain't packing up this ain't packing up this is seeing what you can get rid of get rid of this get rid of that get rid of this how do i know what to get rid of it's like when i went to get we went up to canada one time the time a few years ago in september and my wife you know would give me a wake-up call she said honey you're gonna have to pack sweaters i said sweaters it was 80 degrees here sweaters i had t-shirts you know i mean shirt you know you're going she said and your thicker sport coat she said because it's already snow on the ground and it is below freezing i'm about ready to cancel but you know what i had to do i had to start well i'll take this out take that and that was one of your first few times that i did pack it for a forehand take this out take this out take that out i just you know what had just rearrange everything put the sweaters in put the shirts in put the put a big coat in there put a sock hat on there all those things it's what was needed and see god in his grace comes down and lets you and i know hey let's get rid of this you ain't gonna need that hey we can get rid of this right here you ain't gonna need that what's happening as a bride she surrenders everything why does she surrender cause she's so in love with him that he could say hey get rid of this difference you ain't going to need this difference on the other side thank you lord hey get rid of this bitterness you can you don't have to carry that with you you ain't going to need that oh i don't want that bitterness anyhow what's he doing he's dealing with things that you and i can unpack and release we can cast our cares on him because he cares for us it's a time to unpack it's a time to lay down our life it's a time to be made ready let's bow our heads lord jesus lord has just oh god just standing lord just hearing you lord as you would just give words lord of utterance and direct us and speak to our hearts father i pray god right here this morning lord i know lord there's needs lord i know there is we don't come here lord without having needs upon our lives and lord there is such diversity of needs lord among us and lord i know i am persuaded lord i'm sure you know of every need you know of every heart lord that's gathered here and father you are so mindful lord when we can just take a glimpse and see that lord like it was the lord in the days of noah to know that god that that was prophecy for the hour and the time that we're living that there would be a place of safety that we can come into lord father that the pathway into the blood of jesus christ would be revealed the pathway oh god lord where it speaks that it would be a day lord that's not day or night but in the evening time there would be light lord to show us like the example of that man who was blind but would be led be led to calvary be led to the true atonement be led to the true relationship oh god we know that if it wasn't for your mercy lord we couldn't have found our way none of us lord father it took you coming to us lord lord how you come personally within a service i love that lord i love how you come so personally how you would speak to our hearts you would take lord lives by the hand that lord god that could be in need maybe it's in darkness needs to come to light it needs to come to victory you would take a hold of their hand may they lord put their hand in your hand let your need and lord lead them into a place a full deliverance lives that are in need of healing need of a touch from you lord father god howl that you would move down and you would lead us you would speak to us lord jesus i first of all i just want to say thank you thank you lord you care you care you care so greatly so lord the question isn't if you care we we know you do we see that but now the question comes do we care do we care do we care lord enough to as these examples you gave us in the scripture where a life was willing just to submit their lives to come under like the bride coming under the headship of the word lord god what it is that you're speaking to our hearts personally and dealing with our lives lord god i pray right here this morning [Music] lord if there's one that doesn't know you in that way lord i'm certain this morning that god you're here to move to minister to that need may you lord god i pray lord just just encourage him lord strengthen the lord may they move and act upon that word if they're here lord and they're not ready to go may lord i pray not only lord that they [Music] would believe but may they act upon the word because lord truly this rapture that's upon us it's going to be one of the greatest miracles to take place [Music] lord jesus [Music] i'm reminded how your prophet would tell us there are many miracles lord healing of the body many many different miracles deliverances opening of the red sea lord there's many things that we don't have to just speak about in terms of looking back through the bible but we see the same god of the bible right in our midst where miracles have and are taking place lord the greatest miracle is when that life can be so surrendered to you to where they're willing to let down all of their will they're willing to die out to their selves lord like it said in isaiah that we read today that lord they come to a place that they're not anymore telling you of what they will do and what they want you to do but to where they come to a place to surrender for what you are asking of them lord god when they begin to act upon that word believe it and act upon it then lord god there is a supernatural working of the power of the holy ghost that'll move down in that life oh god it'll bring a transformation that'll change them from death unto life it'll be a passing from death unto life it will no longer be the same man but it will be a new man on the inside a new creation and that is the greatest miracle lord i ask right here this morning that god may you come for each of these needs there's needs lord of deliverance i'm asking lord that you'll come because lord these people they did not come to hear a sermon today they didn't come to hear that lord they come to hear from you [Music] lord god even of needs that they've had on their heart that maybe when the text was read they could look at it and say well it don't seem like maybe the way the text is going but i know that god's in control god knows my need god's able to take a hold of that gift and that life because after all that gift was placed here for me and god will step down and use that gift to speak to my life speak to my need i don't know how it's going to happen but i believe that it's going to happen lord god now lord as your children lord you've ministered to our lives now lord god we lord jesus not only want to believe it we want to act upon the word lord god we want to act upon that word father granted lord jesus granted father [Music] hallelujah amen hallelujah glory be to god hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus hallelujah glory be to god thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord amen hallelujah oh glory be to god well friends let's let's let's surrender it all to you let's surrender it all i've just been pondering meditating upon that for weeks brother branham would say that like a little girl where he says you know little girl a little lady getting ready to be married and he said she's coming into that place of uniting he said she just surrenders everything she just so in love with him it don't matter he no matter what it would be that he would ask or he would require she's willing because she loves him [Music] she wants to be united with him it's a love affair it's not a law it's a love affair that's taking place you see it's like a it's a great migration see the spirit of god moving and dealing with our lives to bring us [Music] from where we are to where we need to be oh my let's just let him move here [Music] let's let him continue to move amen if you need prayer this morning we're here to pray with you if you want the holy ghost he's here this morning glory be to god hallelujah hallelujah glory be to god blessed be the name of the lord if you need strength he's here this morning as the strength given if you need a touch in your body he's here this morning oh blessed be the name of the lord oh hallelujah let's just let god have his way let's let god have his way hallelujah i wonder what the rest of the camels and the rest of the monkeys and the rest of the lines wonder what they could say as some of these lions were walking past i wonder where they're going but you know it was happened in such a silence a secret work it was something that had been already taken place they didn't even notice it same way with the people who was in the world it was it was taking place and they didn't even realize it brother branham stands in the message of desperation he says friends we need to be careful he said because the god who is passing among us if we're not careful he'll pass right through us and pass right by but i want to say pass me not or gentle save me pass me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry lord while on others thou art calling but oh jesus don't pass me by hallelujah oh what a great moment what a great opportunity right here this morning amen let's just let go and let god have his way amen paul go ahead and sing something for us [Music]

to god oh my don't you love him oh blessed be the name of the lord what comfort it gives to us in troublesome times troublesome hours but all what a comfort it is to us as believers to know in whom we have believed and we are persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed against that day oh what a place of safety what a place where we can have real joy where david said now is my head lifted up above my enemies and i shall offer up sacrifices of joy i shall worship in the house of god david what do you have to be worshipping about i'm beholding the beauty of the lord and i'm inquiring in his temple he's revealing himself to me and in a uniting it's a surrendering i'm saying lord jesus make me more like you oh glory be to god it's a work that's taking place a secret work yet it's before all you say how can it be before all before your family before your co-workers but it's a secret work because it's going on on the inside and it's transforming your life being changed from glory unto glory unto glory friends we're not just changed one time we are changed one time by the holy ghost whereby we are new creatures but in that presence we are being changed from glory unto glory unto glory we are being maturing matured by life we're not the same people that we were a year ago we're not the same people we were a month ago we are being changed in his presence oh glory be to god in the highest what comforted this hour what comfort and what a blessing the greatest comfort is is to where your heart is in such a place you love him it's about him said such a uniting this taking place he said you don't have to beg people to pray right you don't have to beg him to come to church this is his exact words he said they're just sowing love with him see it's
