of you and you know sometimes throughout I I get in trouble up here when I start calling out names even when it's during special services I walked over last Sunday evening after Brother Kyle Nicholson was sitting there from Brother Paul's and I walked over and I said Brother Kyle I looked right at you brother I said and I just didn't even I didn't even mention your name I said forgive me ah brother Samuel don't worry about that but I tell you I want to just say it's so good to see each and every one of you am to me these are the highlights of my week not that not that I would come and to minister I just love being here with you I loved last weekend my it was just so just so refreshing amen and the word of the Lord that God spoke to us and so we just want to say we love you and uh if we could let's just go to him in a word of prayer and we certainly want his guidance here Heavenly Father Lord we just want to say that we love you we appreciate you Lord and we lord just are so thankful God that you have allowed us Lord to where that we can gather together here this morning brothers and sisters of like precious Faith Lord there's one there's one goal there's one desire that we would have and that is Lord we want to see you Lord our desire is to stand there Lord that our lives would be on that moment Lord of The Rapture to be changed Lord from Mortal to immortality our hearts Lord are longing Lord for that moment moment Lord oh God may you just Lord once again this morning may we take a another step higher Lord may you come and just speak Lord to our hearts what we have need of Lord there's things that you've laid on my heart through study and meditation prayer but Lord it will take you to bring it it'll take you to put it all together Lord I'm asking Lord that the same inspiration that dropped with just the simpleness of the thought I want to follow you father that's the greatest privilege that I've ever had Lord is to be led by you father as Sons and Daughters of God that's a privilege Lord oh God may we just lay aside Lord now all of our thoughts and lay aside of all the cares of the world because we can't solve them right now anyhow but I believe father that you can give such an assurance Lord you can give an answer you can give us peace Lord in every area and over every decision now may you just come I pray Lord be the speaker and hearer may you minister to every need those that are even not able to be here this morning would you just minister to their needs Lord I hear that Lord with sister Michelle and the foot Lord you know the battle that's been there Lord where times that infection Lord has wanted to travel from the foot up the leg and Lord how that you've intervened Lord time and time again and we're just asking for your mercy once again Lord that you would move Lord for our sister move for the other needs some Lord that oh God that you see Lord not here this morning Lord I just ask that you would move for their needs Lord we pray in a special way come and Lord help us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen musicians and the songs My just wonderful um Psalms 127 and uh I just want to read through that scripture or that chapter Psalms 127 a song of degrees for Solomon except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it and except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain now notice in all in both of these parts of this scripture unless it's the Lord who's building it unless it's the Lord who's keeping the city now I certainly believe that and I believe we agree together that he is the author and the finisher he's the one who is who builds his church he said Upon This Rock I will build my church and I certainly believe I believe we do together that he is also the the one that directs us on areas that need to be kept and without him we would be in a heap of trouble and we certainly need him verse two it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep that's connected with that first verse Lo children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth and happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them as I've said before I've got a quiver on my compound bow that holds six arrows and I've got a quiver on my crossbow that holds three seems like my quiver was three they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate if the Lord would help us here this morning I'd like to speak on the family and godly order of the home may God bless you and bless the word as we're being seated I sometimes uh you uh can really wrestle sometimes the way that the thought itself originally comes um and I just maybe a little insight here and you just have to take my word for it that sometimes it's the thought of it that and how that it comes and how that the Lord will drive and direct the thought and actually doesn't end up being the title but it ends up being the underlying theme within it and though the title itself is The Godly order of the home because we're going to deal with a lot of things with order Blueprints and things like that but there's the word that I don't know how extensively that I'll go into it here this morning but a word that has just been moving in my heart and that's the word of passion uh because anything that we uh there's there's something that every one of us are passionate about and you know you just if we we sit down and we we talk about it and I just as I was fellowshipping with a brother here the other day on the phone and uh just uh some things are being shared and some things and I said you know it's one of those things that as we set and we talk it's it's something that you know you can talk a little bit about this and you could talk a little bit about this and let me just use example with um with brother Joey and sometimes where brother Joey's been here and I've come out of the office and in the earlier parts of the hunting season and I come out sometimes to catch him when he's coming out of the woods and and you know I'll ask him you seeing anything back there or you know what's going on you know and uh and then you know we'll go from talking about deer CU we we both like deer hunting and then it'll get around to uh talking about the Lord and it isn't something that we've had to program and brother Joey says oh now the alarms went off we've spent 10 minutes on deer hunting and now it's time to talk 20 minutes uh on the things of the lord it's just it's natural to gravitate to those things because within it all there's a lot of things that interest that we might have and a lot of things that we can even have passion about but if the very source and what would be the center of our life if the passion is not the things of God then the order itself is wrong and so we all we want we know that that with the passion itself it's uh it's something that we certainly uh know that we must have and I I believe that a passion itself it'll it'll certainly come from an absolute um but I wanted to read this this statement that brother Bram makes here within a home and as he says this in the life story and he's talking about his from his own home he says home is not the house it's the order of the house that makes the home that's what makes home no matter if it's a shanty whatever it is if the order is right on the inside and godly it's more of a home than if you had a palace somewhere right said I'd rather live in a shanty and be happy than to live in a palace and be unhappy and I think that we can we can agree to that we might want different things and look at things but to realize that uh no more than it's the suit that makes the preacher it's not the home itself or the house that actually makes it home there can be many houses themselves it can be a house that might be very attractive on the the outside and the way it looks but it might be very cold on the inside and so the very thing itself that separates and what really makes it a home is that of the order and that it's Godly on the inside aside everything else from the cares of the world and and of this life and we aside everything else from the cares of the world and and of this life and we we work to keep it in a place like that that is a reverence that a place that God will come and speak to our Liv lives because there is a value in our hearts that goes beyond just this life and what we see we realize this life is really not about this life this life is about that life that's coming and so to capture that and to see that how within a household and I I think to set it in this manner here that if we look at in our lives and I I would say this like as Sons and Daughters of God that we uh recognize that it's something that God the way that if God would spend such uh such detail on order within his house Paul would write of it in Timothy God would send his prophet in this hour and speak to you and I even on things within Church order and things that you know I was not even aware of until I I stood there and the brother was taking us through uh the brandom Tabernacle there and we spent about two hours with that brother and they were talking about some things that when you hear Brother Bram talking about not talking in the sanctuary and other things like that you come to find out that those things were going on when the when the Tabernacle itself even when things first were being built and went on for a period of time but there were adjustments that were made there and those were things I didn't know I didn't know about but you see what it was is there's adjustments of things that brother Bram himself he began to see and begin to make and begin to Value remember because you know how it is if if we're just talking about every sort of thing before you come into the house of God you can't just come into the house of God and turn on a switch uh those are things that you know there's a preparation I just had a individual share with me here the other day and say you know I see and I note a difference when there is a moment that I can just have on some instrumental music and just have some prayer before I enter into the house of God there's a difference and I I believe we've come here for with a real desire we listen we've not just come here just to fill a block of time we've not just come here just merely because it's a duty we've come here to receive from God we we want we want our lives as it were it's like updates on your phone that sometimes they need to be done in order to prevent bugs that are there in order to prevent uh security breaches and other things I believe that's what the spirit of God comes to speak to our lives because there is a continual building and a growing that's going on on it isn't so much of of ourself that's being built it's actually us being torn down so that he might be built up in our lives so you have except the Lord build the house and that's why when the spirit of God comes and deals with our life we're here together that we want to grow in the things of God I my heart's desire is that God himself that his life would just growing in my life in our lives together and so this is where it comes in to accept the Lord build the house they that labor labor in vain unless God comes and he is the one speaking to our hearts and there's something in our life that just surrenders to him and don't try to figure it out Just Surrender and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and I'm just going to lay upon that Lord I'm going to lay myself before you in that area that you've spoken to me so personally until that that area I see God flowing through my life that's how God builds his church and that's also how the holy spirit will warn Us in the gates of our life and helping us to see that there's some gates that we need to kind of pick up on there's encroachments of the enemy there's things that's out there and unless God keeps the city my it would go I mean it could slip right under the cover as the prophet told us in the first seal he speaks of that Antichrist Spirit he said as far as in our smarts he can out do any of us but he said there's one that he cannot outdo sir and that's the Holy Ghost what a comfort that is to us as Believers So within that of a household for God I certainly believe that not only uh we look at it for this this place here but I believe in a household for God Even in our own homes we look at it that there's three things I just want to mention it'd be a place where the holy spirit is always welcome I think that's up there on the slide a Place separate from Sodom a place where preparations are made to leave this world so that's the whole that's the whole purpose of what's going on inside of our household where the holy spirit is always welcome amen amen it's separate from Sodom and it's a place where preparations are made to leave this world brother Brandon when he walks back into the Tabernacle in the time of dedication he says I certainly deemed this one of the highlights of my life to be in the Tabernacle again this morning to see its beautiful structure and the Order of the children of God setting in his house today and it goes on to say and I always wanted to see a place correctly in order and for God to worship with his people and we can only do that not by a pretty building but by a consecrated life is the only way we can do that so it's it's not I mean we appreciate the structure I believe with all my heart that uh we want to do the very best that we can do not only to keep it up but in any way of what we can do because I certainly believe that whatever if there's things we do or we don't do it speaks of what we think of the Lord sure does brother Bram himself when he talked about the way the Tabernacle went and not in the building of and things like that he says it shows what they thought of the ministry so it's very important the things that we do I he not talking about himself but he's talking about the ministry that God has given and so I think it's very important that we understand that there's things that it's it's that the value that we have and I'm thankful that God's given us a place I remember back in the days when we had to pack things up and pack and pack them and take them down I remember stretching speaker wire into different uh rooms in order for people to be able to hear over there on G Avenue we had people sitting in the nursery the car the I remember that and I remember having to get there sometimes the other church was a little later getting out and that's okay I mean and that we're renting from and we'd have to get in there and you know carrying the speakers putting them on the the post and the stands and I think you know brother brother Elmer Dalton he welded those stands that we had and made him to fit in that building and then we had wires and some of you remember that we had wires and running it and then after the end of the service wonderful service well you had to have strength to take them big speakers down and pack everything up I'm really thankful that God's given us a place that when there's a burden on our heart to have a meeting we don't have to ask somebody and say you think we can have Friday night or Saturday night I think it's a blessing that God has given us a place where we can have have Services when we want to and even be able to host meetings and let others and invite others to come in I think that's a great blessing it's not to make us something but I look at it if God's given us something then let's use it for the kingdom of God so as he said the only way we can do this is not by a pretty building but by a consecrated life so I really I think as we can hone in upon that and and to understand there are are blueprints anytime you do any sort of building you know there's there's blueprints you've got to go by um you know those have to be approved those drawings got to be approved by the city and or Township whomever it is that you're going by and then then you have to abide by those blueprints you you can't get blueprints approved downtown at the city of Lorraine and then you have an approval for a ranch and then all of a sudden you decide you know what I think I'd like to make a Colonial House twostory it don't work that way or to say you know what I think you know what we're going to do we're going to change and move the garage from this side to this side no you got to stay with the blueprints that's been submitted and I'll just say say it like this God has not asked you or I to come up with the blueprints that's been sometimes that's been the problem down Through the Ages where they've taken something out of the scripture and said this is the blueprint but the problem is it don't line up with the rest of God's word that's right you see if we if we even take a scripture let me give you an example like the Pentecostal say well you know here it was when the Holy Ghost fell they spake in tongues and they want to take that scripture and make it absolute the problem with that you might have a scripture but it doesn't hold continuity with the rest of the scripture and God's thought is not something that is broken into pieces it is a continuity yes sir so a blueprint God himself sets us sets the blueprint for you and I brother bam when he would speak marriage of the Lamb 1962 he says we have have the material on Earth to make the bride ready yes amen and that material is the word that material is the spirit of the Living God and so when we think of that blueprint I want to just read this to you out of 1 Chronicles 28:9 because the Psalms we read it's speaking it's an expression of not only that to Solomon I love that a song of degrees there's we I believe there's higher Heights in God and thou Solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect perfect means complete that's what perfect means because you can't be perfect I can't be perfect than myself but we want to be complete you say well what do you mean by complete that means that when I'm conviced and conviction comes and I'm wrong I want to be complete and say Lord forgive me I don't want to give no place to the enemy that's right and with a willing mind for the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek Him He will be found of thee but if thou forsake Him He will cast thee off forever now watch this take heed now for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it I don't know about you but I always find this incredibly interesting when God is calling us to do something he follows it and with an admonition be strong and do it it lets you and I know it's going to take more than just our human resiliency our human strength because even as the book of Isaiah said even the youth will grow weary even the youth will faint so even though young people people have such strength and man stamina and you know are able just to go and uh but yet God says even in this part your human strength alone is not enough to achieve the purpose of God and to stand that so good it's going to take his strength moving behind your strength and God wants to use your strength as a young person he wants to use the stamina that's why the Bible say said what a blessing it is for the Youth to Bear the the uh the Yoke in their youth Hallelujah right it's a blessing for that to take the strength and to have that stamina but yet we want to make sure that it's under the strength and the governance of almighty God be strong and do it so what a what a charge for Solomon then David here's what I want you notice this in verse 11 then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern and he gave him the pattern of all of these things go down to verse 12 and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of all of these other things and so the pattern itself this was not something that David it had been become like you know well Mama thought this and daddy thought this and we'll just put this together and we'll we'll see what no David what he was passing to Solomon was something that had been revealed to him by the spirit and what he was admonishing Solomon is Solomon you've got to have the same experience what God has given me you yourself must receive this pattern and it be revealed to you by the spirit that this is absolute don't cut any Corners don't make any adjustments to it just stay with it even when it seems like it doesn't make sense stay with it amen why because if you build a house and you don't build it according to the blueprint you're going to have to tear it down and start all over is that right so it's got to be built according to the blueprint First Kings chapter 10 now let's let's just make kind of a Quantum Leap here to this place of here is Solomon and here's a here is Solomon after uh the house of the Lord has been built 7even years in building the house of of the Lord and then he built his own house which was 13 years in building it I want you to notice though I want you to notice the priority that Solomon himself his priority was upon God's house first his own house second am are you hearing me he didn't build his own house and say well once I get my house built then I'll focus on the house of God sometimes the things God asked us to do do not make sense our order of because our order of thinking is is that let me get rid of this and let me get out of this and let me do this and then I'll serve God you got to come back to realize why is the mess the first place that it is you don't get out of a mess or out of a situation by resting on the arm of flesh on your own abilities on your own way to figure things out because that's what happened in the first place you've got to put God first and when God is first then God can bring everything else around the way that it ought to be yes sir so here here is Solomon and notice the Queen of Sheba from from such a distance the Bible speaks that she's heard of what's taking place and the Bible says it like this and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all of Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built now think about remember brother Trevor was he was uh who was he talking to was he talking to you about you're a house Builder and you're saying I'm a house Builder and and you know you think about and he said okay he said so where's the where where's the fruit where's the fruit remember he was preaching on that in the morning of the all alone so it it's same things that this wasn't just something that was said but what was said it it was something that moved in her heart of the testimony of others that had been there and so it wasn't just something of the imagination it was a reality so when these people were expressing this of what they witnessed what they saw taking place she came and she saw it right and I believe I believe we believe together that serving the lord it's something where it ought to be listen the token the life of God the Holy Spirit the love of God all the same is something that should show coming and going it shows in office life it shows in school life but Sam what are you saying I'm saying that we don't take off or just uh take off serving God and hang it up for Sunday or hang it up for Thursday but serving the lord I'm saying this in a in a manner you catch it serving the lord Lord is a life inside of you where you are giving yourself daily to his will not your own will the reality of the Gospel is that our lives brother Bram says in Statue of a perfect man he said God's burden for my heart and what's upon with this message is to build powerhouses of the Living God powerhouses isn't always how we think about things it's Walking In step with God's word it's putting God first in everything verse five now watch this and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants so she's seeing all this and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cup bearers and his Ascent by which he went up under the house of the Lord there was no more spirit in her this is what I want you to catch she was there and she saw the display of the wisdom of Solomon in the courts of the king but the wisdom of Solomon was not confined to just the courts of the king it wasn't confined to when service was just going on it wasn't confined just to Solomon but Solomon by yielding to the Lord that wisdom itself it came down and it had an effect to wear even the meat on his table what they're eating and partaking of in their home Hallelujah is so Hallelujah yes sir what we eating and partaking in the home even the way that the position iing of the servants God is interested in see details speak of God God is in every little aspect of it even the attendance of the servants even the apparel even the clothing what they wor it showed whether they had received the wisdom of God or not and not just received it you see it would be one thing listen what if she said what if the Queen of Sheba it comes and where she sees somebody going along maybe they've got on the right a power apparel here they are holding the right meat but it's just like there's something about it it's just not right in their Spirit there's like a complaint there's like a a critique there's like a man I don't like all this I don't like having to wear this I don't like having to do this and I don't know why Solomon thinks all this is so important and all of these things even if they wouldn't have said it out here it would have picked it up oh yes oh yes because your life you know these quotes your life your life your testimony speaks louder than any words is that right look at this did to her there's no more spirit in her my I I think if there's anything in this hour that if there ought to be and is any lives in any people upon Earth to where others can see they don't have to go out to Colorado Springs Colorado to know what a family is they can look and see there are families that are founded upon the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour I'm asking you to pray for me right now because these are things that when we as we speak on them and burden there's a lot of things i' I could just I would love you to stay here for hours because there's a lot more of things to unpack with us but we can only begin one Journey at a time and I mean that in a manner that we're all here to grow you see when we've come to hear the word of God this is not about you're wrong you're right this is not listen if that's how you're hearing the message you're hearing it completely wrong we're here the prophet said over and over to take inventory of our own lives hallu yes sir anybody ever heard of the story of the emperor new clothes you know what that was they sold here they they came to this individual just in case somebody Haden and they they wanted to tell them all these wonderful clothes the clothes you got on to that Emperor and nothing and Men you ought to see these clothes and we're going to sell these clothes to you and we're going to make them and I'm going to make this outfit for you and everything well there wasn't nothing and here you have the emperor walking out there naked and he's he had clothes on I tell you friends let me just let me just say the reason that I I mention I say that it's easy your life my life could look ever so Godly if you compare it to Lady OA but you're not comparing it to the right thing we're not to get adjusted in this world it's to take that word and say God if there's things how God deals with our Heart Lord my life I see it's not lining up Lord but I want my life to be lined up it's an individual Affair amen oh my then there was no more spirit in her you see that in order that whole home was ordered and operated by the wisdom of God that's so good oh my now as she goes on to say I I just got to skip a few of those things she says how be it in verse 7 I believe not the words until I came and my own eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame which I heard happy are thy men happy are these thy servants you mean the wisdom of God could bring happiness in the home yes that's good yes if it's handled in wisdom that's right the wisdom remember the wisdom that Cometh From Above I'm quoting James now the wisdom that Cometh From Above is pure full of Mercy right is that right that's why when the prophet when he labors in the token message and takes that latter part and labors within the home he says apply it with confidence apply it with an understanding apply it he said that there would be an atmosphere that would be created that they would fall into happy happy oh my you see we're living in an hour in a thing where you know I'll just say Satan the God of this evil age it's everything about and the things that is supposedly set forth to be happy it a making nobody happy there's more Depression more anxiety more suici side among young people oh yes that's true and you know I'm just what I've looked at was the the statistics over it if I can get the word out over the past couple years over in places in what we would call affluent communities oh yes oh yes Perry Ohio is one of them and they can't figure out what's going on with the middle school that's right that's right you know I'm thankful to God that God has given us Grace in this hour but we want to receive that Grace amen because let me say this to you as parents and every one of us as brothers and sisters God has entrusted you and I you might be the person that puts the meat on the table maybe I'm the person who Bears a cup maybe another person is a person who serves something else pulls out chairs no matter matter what it is whatever part whatever purpose you have to play Let the wisdom of God flow through your life as a father as a mother as a husband as a wife say Lord don't ever be ashamed Lord we need your [Music] wisdom they were ring around the gift of God how many knows brother Brown will say that word over and over rallying brother Brown let me just read a few of these quotes before I as I move on brother Bram talks about how they he says you know in the days of Solomon was a golden age for Israel because all the people with one Accord rallied around the great gift that Solomon had from God he said I wonder what would take place tonight if all the churches in the United States would rally around the gift that God has give us that is the Holy Ghost God's gift what if all the churches would break down their barriers and would rally around the great gift of Godly brotherly love and the baptism of the Holy Spirit it would be the greatest defense this nation could have it would be better than all the scientists and atomic bombs and so forth that they could invent that's what God wants us to do how many want to do what God wants you to do amen all of us in our different denominations now we're not in different different denominations but to understand every one of us are diverse and different your makeups are different every gift in the body is different we are different and I don't mean that in a negative way like she's different I don't mean it like that but it's to recognize one another as brothers and sisters rallying around this great gift of God which is the holy ghost that comes with power and manifestation and demonstrations of his presence God's wisdom coming down then there would not be one cruel word spoken against any move of God we'd all be one one great big bundle of Godly love that's what it's going to take for the church to go in the Rapture oh yes that's good I want you to think of this scripture in in Proverbs 16:7 I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but this scripture here and you're probably reading it as I'm talking but every one of us you've got enemies and this just so you understand now I'm not trying to bring up bad memories but I this is what I want you to understand you're always going to have enemies but it's what are you going to do about it cuz the Bible said love your enemies pray for them that do despitefully use you I mean that part of the scripture that wouldn't be hard if we don't have no enemies it wouldn't be hard to pray for somebody who despitefully uses us if they didn't despitefully use us we just glory to God Amen Lord then it comes down on our part we're like o I think I need to pray about that before I pray about that I need the discernment I really need discernment remember we want to follow the blueprint but watch this watch this in Proverbs 16:7 when a man's way please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him how many know that within Israel that when Israel came in the land there' be times when the enemies would get stirred up what what was it called the en what was it that caused the enemies to get stirred up and come over it's when man's ways were no longer pleasing God and God would allow the enemies to rise up that's right so when a man's ways please the Lord it isn't God saying now I'm going to go in and I'm going to change the heart of that enemy God can do that but there is a principle that's right here that when things arise like this we in our lives just like when you go to a doctor you tell the doctor symptoms right you tell them symptoms and then they hear your symptoms listen to your heart do all these other things then they make a diagnosis based on symptoms so I I know that maybe a lot of things right now it deals with uh and I hate to say it because I know there's real doctors out there but sometimes things are just treating symptoms instead of really getting down to what's the root of the problem and see sometimes where God is at God is making things known as far as symptoms but if all we do is just say well this symptom is being made known and I need an AED to take care of this when a symptom you see a symptom and God's making it known say Lord help me to look deeper Lord because that symptom is only something that's coming out from a different cause well that's just the wisdom of God for us to be able to look so when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him prise the Lord hallelujah that's why when things rise on the job consider are my ways pleasing the Lord I don't have to wonder and say well I wonder I can come right I come right back to the blueprint and say have I varied off of the blueprint and really begin to seek God lord where has there been a varying because this is your word when a man's ways please God he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him or or you can become the Donut King and donut Queen yeah trying to appease him ask Israel how far that's gotten you you see these are principles within God's word I I I know God can change hearts of people's lives but to understand this what took place brother Bram says in the days of Solomon he said he goes on in the next quote all the nations feared Israel instead of trying to make war with them they brought in peace offerings they were not afraid so much of their man they were afraid of that God that they were in unity with it's like in the The Six Day War how many testimonies when you you read of that and hear of mosha Diane and all them with Israel listen friends these are not just Fly by Night things God said he'll stand with Israel is that right and to think of how that even when Israel did not not I I say this respectfully and by numbers did not have a chance but you have that to where there's Egyptians I believe it was or syrians forgive me right now they got out of their tanks and ran away because they saw the pillar of fire Hallelujah I'm telling you you don't have to fight your own battles if you put God first God will fight your battles Hallelujah hall hallelujah God will make your enemies be at peace and bring peace offerings that's not just applied to a father to a mother that's of a home right that's in school that's among young people that's among their all of us right wow we could preach on that one for a little bit but let's let's let's go I want to just say the next the other the part of what it brought this reality there in that home it brought a confidence it brought an assurance and it brought a stability look how brother Brandon words this in 1959 Queen of Sheba he said every traveler would come by that's Pastor Israel would say oh you should go up there and see those people they're just as bold as they can be they know there's not a flaw about their religion that's the way we want to believe it there's nothing wrong with the holy spirit it's a perfect gift of God to the church amen now think of what the early church it was the same thing the early church did when the Holy Ghost fell the Bible tells us in Acts 2 also comes over in Acts 4 that they sold all of their possessions and they had things in common they had singleness of heart now remember brother brandham himself a man challenged brother bandham on that particular scripture and said that was the biggest error and the biggest move that the whole that the early church made and brother BR said how can the Church of the Living God be led by the spirit of God and make an error like that he said well brother brandom look what happened they didn't have no homes to go back to when trouble came do you see what this was actually speaking of is when our lives to be so dedicated and devoted to God to where I'm not going to be tied down by anything of this life I may have to work I have a job but my job is not going to be my owner I will not be subservient and allow the world the riches and anything of this world to control my life amen are you hearing me I'm not going to allow that to happen oh brother Samuel you just don't understand remember what I said before I cannot labor and preach on this this morning but many times the way that we try to solve problems is we go about the arm of Flesh well I'm just going to get myself out of debt so I'm going to work work work work or work wait a minute you didn't get yourself out of debt by obeying the Lord or get yourself in debt by B obeying God too many scriptures that's so good that didn't happen just by doing so you're not going to get out of debt by doing it on your own you've got to come back to the scripture seek ye first the kingdom of God now I realize when I say things like this that's where it gets down to whether or not you actually trust God and believe it or not that's good yes sir but it you know it's a choice friends look look the only thing I can do I I preach the word there's going to be an elect there's going to be a bride I believe listen I preach as everybody is going I stand I pray pray I labor within that manner I refuse to leave hoof behind you might say brother Samuel why are you ministering like that why don't you just let me alone listen if you're here you're a part of this assembly and God lays the burden to bring this word you are part of this and the burden lays on my heart I long to see lives and hearts that'll stand there on that day I trust that I'm there when every one of you and I get to hear you walk before the throne glory be to God hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah I get excited now watch this first Corinthians 11:1 notice what Paul said now remember they were bold this was something that was exemplified they were bold there was no flaw in their religion you know there's something about it a confidence an assurance a stability that even as a young person that brother B said you're getting ready to take a chemistry test he said slip in there of a morning and say dad while we're over the breakfast would you pray for me this morning he said you watch if it don't turn out better God will take things like that cuz let me just tell you something I hated chemistry now I don't mean to offend nobody else and you know my other son over here this guy can pick this stuff apart left and right and everything that was not my forte my forte was geology I loved rocks if it was science and all that right there but this is what I'm trying to tell you is that there's things that you will face in life that chemistry itself will seem like a peanut but it will be the experience of what God did for you on a chemistry test that'll help you when you have another test in your life when you have another situation it is training and teaching them and putting the order that if we we look to the Lord Jehovah is our strength he is our Heth he is our stabilizer 1 Corinthians 11:1 Paul said be you followers of me that means imitators even as I also am of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you so not just of the word but even the ordinances even my ways even all of those things so not just keeping word but you saw the word exemplified before you but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God see how that wisdom is supposed how God has ordained for it to travel down God has ordained for it in that way now I want you to watch this there's a message if you haven't listened to it in a while there's actually a couple I'd like you to listen to but one I'd like you to listen to it's only about 27 minutes long but what house will you build me I'd like you to listen to that that I've been I've been I've went over that and over that and over that but not just recently but but before but I want you just to to listen to that just take it in be good to something you listen to and talk about husband and wife reflect on with family but I want you to watch how brother brandom here is speaking regarding brother Green's appointment in coming there to Arizona cuz remember brother Perry green moved from Texas to Arizona now watch he said is I I want I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother green several times speak and I certainly was influenced as he brought the word of the Lord to us and so humble about it what an example that was set for all of us I know sometimes we have our favorites and I know sometimes our favorites we want to spiritualize it but really God has a diversity God has a diversity and just so you understand deciel level has nothing to do with the an anointing I mean I I am who I am you know brother Trevor is who he is and brother Nathan brother Brian every one of we're all different I I you know the way that I study I go about things it's different from somebody else I I just can only be who God has made me to be right same thing for you if you're not then you're you're you're an impersonator man but you know when you think about it it ought to be something to where we ought to be able just to be a able to receive from the Lord remember brother bam text us there and why and why people are so tossed about he comes to the end of that message and he's talking about the anointing of the spirit of God he said that the anointing itself is supreme power and control and he spoke of how that when the Lord Jesus read it and set down precious words proceeded from his life if you really consider it most of the preaching of the Lord Jesus it certainly was not like me he was sitting down and he wasn't sweating right that's right that's scripture is it not but sometimes our minds our ideas of it's got to be now listen well once again we might have our certain preferences but we need to make sure we're not just looking at the vesture on the outside because let me just tell you something your your life your soul cannot feed on emotion that's a direct quote your soul feeds on the word of God 100% is that right I mean I I you know I can say it I I'm emotional but it don't feed on emotion it feeds on the word of God how did we get here I certainly was influenced as he brought the word of the Lord to us and so humble about it now watch he says I don't get the word from the Lord is maybe it would come in Revelation as it's been sent now this is what brother green said I don't get it as it's been sent but I like to stress upon what has been said like when Paul wrote something in the Bible I come here to stress upon what he said I have no message only just to stress on what's already been said from the Lord said that's remarkable for a young fell to say that I'd say Amen there many many more young fellas could take advice from this and stop trying to correct the Prophet come on now stop trying to say that you know this is his opinion and this is this round I'm not going back to denomination Sorry God has given a message where his thoughts have come down to you and I so notice what brother green said my position is to stress what's already come says it twice now if that's the position there at brother Perry as the pastor CU really any other Ministry we don't have any other message to preach than the message that God has given us us that's not been manhandled and to stress means to give a particular emphasis or an importance to a point statement idea that's been made in speech or writing now I'm asking you as parents what do you stress on oh brother Samuel my job no no you misunderstood what are you stressing to be important oh brother Samuel my child's education I can preach on this CU I got three boys my child's education but what about their soul what about their soul they might be the smartest CEO might end up being this and being that but whatever you stress as important listen friends we can't say one thing and do another that's right that's called confusion it's what we stress that that's important now I believe I believe in our children I believe they ought to I believe in you know our kids getting good grades as far as when I say good grades I believe they ought to try I believe there's everything they ought to put forth within their school but I am not living just for them to get through college right we got quiet we I'll come out here and preach then I'll come down there if I need to that's not what we I'm living about God is a provider you realize when God called me away from my job to stand here and take this post you realize even of everything that there and I'm not saying this to look at me but everything that had to be forsaken oh yeah an insurance plan right come on now things that if you ask me how my boys going to get to school and how's this going to be and how's that going to be I could tell you I don't know how but I know what he told me he said if you keep your heart and your mind centered on me I'll take care of everything you have need of hallah not everything I want just what I need and I want to go on record He's been Faithful he has been faithful but once again sometimes it's the way we think about things and we stress about it man I wish I could spend more time on this some you're like come on keep going keep going move on you see your kids my kids my boys too I can preach on these things not only because of my boys but I've been here I've went through I've went through this is school I knew what it was like to come to midweek service have to go home and then I got to take a test the next morning I know what that's like your friends I'm not trying to put rules and governance I'm saying what are we stressing what are we stressing you say well that don't mean very much watch oh yes it'll start with just a test oh yes and then over and over it'll eventually carry on in the adult life I'm too tired I'm too weary I can't do this I can't do that why it's because of what was taught back there that's right wo we got a little quiet there but that's all right it's all right I know where I'm standing stress and it's what we stress on I wonder if Solomon did Solomon just stress on certain parts in the word was it certain things that he just stressed on or was it all of it let me tell you what kind of material Solomon went with Solomon himself did not just pick any material to put into the building but Solomon himself even chose things of that of the Cedars of Lebanon he chose that of gold you know these are things that had to be brought in to the land of Israel he chose things of materials that really displayed what he thought of God Amen brother that's so good watch what brother Bram says in the message one this is all the way through the message brother BR said I don't believe there's any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and God they'll bring up children in the world make them illegitimates give them cigarettes whiskey play cards in their side drink liquor before them you know what I never understood I never understood why parents that could stand there and swear in front of their kids and would get on their kids for swearing I thought this is the it's a this nonsense they would get on their kids for smoking cigarettes and they smoked them they would get on their kids and for drinking and they drink I don't know about to you but that seems like confusion to me no matter how loyal they are to their marriage vows that's sexually that's flesh but there's a spirit in there that Spirit of a sinner Papa and Mama no matter how loyal to their children will come well you say I know men and women that don't teach their children that and wasn't Christians the very thing of not leading them to Christ was the wrongest thing they could ever do besides the other not to lead them to Christ now he didn't say lead him to Sunday school I believe Sunday school is good he didn't say lead him to youth meeting I believe youth meeting is good he didn't say just lead him to church that's good but lead them no don't just drop them off lead them it's leading in every facet of Life leading through every stage leading through every season everybody with me amen watch this in Psalms 128 verse one I just want to make sure my mic didn't go out Psalms 128 verse1 how many want to be blessed amen blessed is everyone that fearth the Lord that's reverence him that walketh so walketh in his ways not not just see the reverence will translate into action watch this verse two for Thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee that is so good how many remember when Israel God rebuked him for worshiping ba remember that you remember what ba what they started doing they started worshiping ba and calling out that our crops are failing we can't figure out what's going on so we got to find a god we've got to find a book something on fertility we've got to find a God why you know why they needed to do that they had forsaken the ways of the Lord and they started to have to scramble to try to compensate in other areas but let me tell you something there's nothing that beats the plan of putting God first nothing nothing even compares to it there ain't nothing you can put on the table nothing compares to fearing the Lord and walking in his ways is that how you feel amen notice verse three thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house thy children like Olive plants round about thy table this speaking of Life behold that thus shall the man be blessed that fearth the Lord that is so good I'm not going to read Psalms 1 we could read that but I you understand where it says that regarding that man his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law he doth meditate day and night but I just say it in this way everything that we do it's a choice even when the word comes forth even from times of counsel back there whether it's back there on the phone it always comes down to it I don't make decisions for nobody these are choices that we make you don't make choices for me we all have choices to make and that's is why that within the choice every one of us have the choice as to what you want to see in the church you have a choice as to what you want to see in your home and in your life you have a choice of that that's what you choose well Brother Sam I want to see remember brother B says we can only not by a pretty building but by a consecrated life Lord I want to see more of you in the church then ask God to say Lord I want to see more of you here first amen am this is where it begins this is where it begins Revival begins in a personal way amen God moves in a personal way Lord I want more of you is that right right can I have just a little bit more time notice this in Ephesians 6:4 the Bible said fathers provoke not your children to [Music] wrath Lord have mercy I got to go on I'm not going to preach that part but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord that right there the first part of that verse it kind of sometimes can depend on what season of Life your children are in yep not saying that there's always an exception for it but sometimes as they get older and you know when they get to certain ages I mean I mean they've told the world how to spin and and this is how things just you know they they my you know and and of course if we're not careful as parents we end up like Jacob putting on a coat of many colors and get in trouble for that I can't preach on that today it's true Jacob's Brothers you know they had issues with Jacob but Jake I mean with Joseph but Jacob didn't help that either I said Jacob didn't help that either that's true are you with me he didn't help it that's he didn't help him why you say that because even Prophet told us down there when when when Joseph was in that prison house he said he felt like he was a great guy so these are these are things that we we stay on a tight when it's on it and we jump off here and apply it over here but to understand that there's things that even in that oh how we need God's grace I I don't want to lay on that the to this morning but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord right I want to ask you to raise your hand but how many of you and I I want to just give an example I thought this is a good example of how that when you're taking and we're talking on the things of the Lord you know when you have a Bible study and you talk on the things of the Lord I believe if there's anything we should be talking about with our families it should be on the things of the Lord now once again I'm going to go ahead and say it because I think I have to qualify it is that it doesn't mean that your house is a monastery that you know you don't have to say that canest thou pass the salt shaker to me and where every single conversation is I've got to have a scripture got to have a quote that's not we're talking about that's not that's not even life that's not even life and you there's no there's no substance to it that's not wisdom flowing but notice when is a time to talk about things like brother Ram's talking about with his little little kids right here now I want you to let me read this to you so you see where brother Ram's talking about doing Bible study my he's not even talking about doing it around the table what what's what he does he said every evening when I'm home in the message Elisha the prophet after everything's cleaned out I take my girls and give them a Bible study I put them in the car wow Bible study in the car I love this it breaks down all formalities you see it puts things friends so that we realize it's part of our life that's what God that's what it is to serve the Lord he is our life and right around wife and baby and I give them questions like who was Elijah what was he right quick them little six-year-old 8-year-old girls say tishbite yep I'd say how do you know that how could you tell if you'd meet him today what kind of man was he oh he was a hairy man had leather around his loins little Rebecca and Sarah would holler out just keep drilling that into their minds well brother Samuel I don't want to force nothing down him you think the world is doing that yes sir that's right do you think the world and school is all of a sudden pulling back no I don't want to put my agenda I don't want to are you kidding me right the world through every Avenue our kids have certain things even as I told some of the young ones with with the children and things right now I said look you're already there's things that you will have to approach at a much younger age than what I did from the time that I were married I went from the big old bulky you know cell phone you had to have a red wagon behind you to pull it behind you then you go to these little smartphones we have now sometimes I think they're smarter than us but notice just keep drilling that into their minds drilling it constantly that's what you do to your children mother brother BR says quit running around all over the city and gatting about now that that part right there can be interpreted let let let this part be what's what's the most important give your children Bible lectures and things that's the thing to do he goes on he says all these societies and post and all these other things you see sometimes the busyness within our life if we would sit down and say how much of this is really edifying Christ in the life of our child in the life of our home even in your life if we just would evaluate that he said I believe I've heard my expression of you heard my expression of women preachers he said I might have to crawl back on it but every mother is a preacher God gives her a little congregation at home to preach to just keep going you get it first and go right with your children notice you get it first and then go right with your children Brother Sam me what are you saying listen I'm saying that the things that God even has spoke to you today in church talk about them right right those are things that'll start even a a Bible study those are things you don't have to go and say well I got to study this out no just talk about what God is doing right now in your heart what God's doing in your life because listen it's between you and the Lord that's your experience between you and God nobody can talk about that like you can and just fellowshipping on those things right there and watch God's presence watch the enrichment in your home watch how his life just flows through it don't have to be something way extravagant out here it's just make him aart and if there's things that God's dealt with your life let me tell you there's times I've gathered we our family's been gathered right around there in the living room and so our time then for devotional I just have to tell them hey look there's some things right here what was what was what we heard ministered here or this was said there or did you hear this right here and I heard brother BR say this or something but I'm calling their their attention to it in a manner to say this is where we need to pick it up this is how I feel God dealing with my heart this how God dealing with my life amen you see what it is it's all Al as I've told them as young men I said you're going to be leading homes one day right oh yes you're going to be leading homes you'll be husbands you'll be fathers and you got to lead that home and everything has to come back to it's coming back to the word of God it's not what we're trying to search brother Samuel I'm not a preacher you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a preacher just just just be a believer who loves God more than anything else and God will give you the wisdom that you have need of when you need it yes sir you'll do it man on man oh man where does time go see some of you didn't know what time was you having such a good time now that's psychology right there notice let me read let me let me try to close this out here and here some time ago brother Bram said I was reading an article where there was a home and five boys was born in this home just really hone in on this their oldest one got old enough to go to the Navy and off to the Navy he went the second one followed the next one until all the whole five went away to the Navy So a family with five boys one oldest went to the Navy second end up all of them went to the Navy there was no Marines sorry brother Carlos or navy men in their family the mother and father couldn't understand just why these people these boys everyone wanted to go to the Navy there was a combing investigation hope it wasn't a senate committee made of this and come to find out in the bedroom wow bedrooms are important aren't they wow yeah yes sir bedrooms are they not the off limits of token application they're under this roof are you hearing me this is not your little domain you put whatever color siding you want on outside of your room oh brother Samuel and come to find out you see friends lot brother Trevor was preaching on these things the Lord was taking him on that of alone that part of being alone is not Godlike when Jesus went to get alone he didn't mean alone to himself he went to get alone apart from all the cares of life and get into the presence of his father is yes sir all right now in this bedroom there was a beautiful big picture hanging up there of a big ship sailing on a quiet calm sea and it so impressed the boys as they went to bed at night looking at this picture it was on their mind to sail that quiet soothing sea and along the morning when they Rose the first thing they could look at was the ship making her way through the quiet calm sea and it impressed the boys so that each one become a sail so they went to bed looking at it they got up looking at it you know what that reminds me of in the Tabernacle they had the light the lamps and trimmed them in the morning they checked on them in the evening they offered the lamb in the morning they offered the lamb in the evening I'm going to open my day with Jesus I'm going to close my day with Jesus because he is Alpha and Omega there may been some things in between but he is Alpha and Omega amen now watch what brother Brown says if a picture of a ship will impress boys to become Navy men Sailors of the sea what art the picture of the Lord Jesus Christ do always have the right thing before your children bring up a child in the way that it should go bring it up teach it right it'll certainly won't depart from them I think there's no greater picture I love the Hoffman's head of Christ i i i there's something about having that picture in your home oh is something about having the picture of the pillar of fire God had his picture taken with us something very important about that brother brandham mentioned those things brother Bram speaks of you know even our Bible having our Bible open it's important that it's more than just a picture on a wall but our lives every each one of us are to be an example this goes beyond just father and mother and all of us today when we talk about about a home we're talking about a church we're talking about a family we're talking about every one of us that every one of us listen every one of us our lives are influencing someone else and if there's anything at all if there's anything that would be out of order if there's anything from our lives I am so thankful that God is mindful enough to say hey let's get this back in line so the wisdom of God can and flow through your life as I intend for to do I'm grateful that's what this that's what the ministry and the word when preaching here and dealing with this with on families and things like this and by God's grace I plan to do this every month these are things that are very important everything's important there's not but you understand we can fly so high up here in Revelation but if they don't come down here and shoe leather we're missing it we're missing it we it this this gospel God came these things that God shows us that's God letting us know his love his care concerning our lives let me just say this if there's been anything that has been a hasb been I can give you quote after quote where the Prophet said Let It Be A has been and start fresh right here amen that's one thing you you find from the presence of the Lord is as we come to him there's things that God deals with our life and there's Corrections that can be made I want to receive this Grace amen I want to walk in this Grace amen these are things right now to order our lives and let me just say this maybe you look and and this word these are things I'm just speaking to you from my heart sometimes there's things I've realized over the years from when I first started to Pastor sometimes the enemy can come and just haunt people when I go to start preaching on families let me just tell you something you're not getting Stones thrown from Brother Samuel if there's anything that's condemning you that ain't the spirit of God he don't condemn come on now he convicts that's good yes sir the Bible when the Bible says all scripture is given by inspiration for reprove correction reprove and rebuke I love the word correction the word correction there means healing restoration wow that's what correction is That's So Good so correction is not you're just we're wrong but correction says look this is where we're not hitting the Mark here's the Mark we're supposed to hit let's get there so we fix our eyes on the Mark we need to be aiming towards I say God I want my eyes because what means more to me than anything is this Rapture amen that means more to me than anything what means that that life I want to see that life I want to see it in every life and every heart just where there's just such a as I said that word today such a passion between you and God it's something that that it's just a it's just boiling up in your life to where when you're outside of these walls it don't end when Music Stops it don't end when Church stops you you take the things and Lord you spoke to me Lord you ministered to my heart and to know he's right there to walk with you he doesn't stop back there at that door he doesn't stop at that door he don't just stop out here at the end of the parking lot he goes with you amen that's right amen and you can take that word in your life thank you Lord and for every every home to be built oh it first starts here with him building your life right let him build let him build let him make his home in your life how do I do that just surrender surrender it to him surrender it all to him give it all to him let him build himself in you and like Solomon he built the house of the Lord in seven years then he started on his own house this is what's important because if I can get this right here if this is under his influence then he'll help me know what I need in my house if I this house is under his influence then the other things in my house will be just where they need to be you love him yes sir amen God bless you amen could we just have a word of prayer together and I know we're not shaking hands one another but maybe as families are sitting next to one another brothers or sisters if you uh I mean brother to brother obviously everything respect respectful but could we just lay hands on one another would that be all right and let's just offer a word of prayer because we are we we're a family we are a family as a church we are family we are family we are a body of Believers and I believe there's healing in the house of God I I believe there's healing in homes and families I I'm looking at things that God is doing and will do Heavenly Father Lord this is Lord the very burden Lord of our lives and our hearts Lord is that oh God in every part of our life Lord it would be Lord a a Godly order how could we know how to order it without you revealing the blueprint to us Lord so father I pray God knowing that my brothers and sisters we are standing
